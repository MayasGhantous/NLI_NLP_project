  one year they made it so all the kids had holidays the same week and ski slopes were crazy crowded . 
  then they changed it back to half of the country 1 week , other half of the country next week . 
  prettiest one in my town is [ celjski dom ] ( http://urosperich.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/celje-celjski-dom2.jpg ) . 
  ugliest would be [ this thing ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/@46.2263157,15.2668792,3a,75y,266.16h,88.11t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sr3vx1odcdskhjvqlu2ej6q!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=sl ) our a [ bus station ] ( http://www.izletnik.si/mma/celje_avtobusna_postaja/2016012909330770/mid/ ) . 
  no idea . 
  someone could come up with a new one . 
  our maybe we could be the first ( ? ), 
  country with two official anthems !, 
  sporting events are the most common events to hear our anthem and it 's not the type of an anthem to hype you up which is something i like . 
   in any case , i prefer one about peace than about slitting throats . 
  sport events or no . 
  durrr i do to . 
  i 'm sure no one inspires to be a good neighbour while playing a football or basketball match ... 
  even if civil union or registered partnerships are equal by law to marriage it 's still discriminatory to not allow seme sex unions to be called marriage . 
  it 's better than no rights at all but still discriminatory . 
  same sex couples can get married here the same way as other couples but because they ca n't adopt their definition of marriage is still not equal . 
  it 's not ? 
  it 's just not a typical inspiring anthem . 
  i like it . 
  even though i sometimes wonder why it was chosen as the national anthem because the lyrics are so uninspiring for sport events . 
  italians always get so hyped singing their anthem and i feel like joining peace corps after listening to ours . 
  russian anthem is the best anthem . 
  sometimes bbc world , bbc earth a lot of times . 
  hahaha, 
  huh ? 
  marriage does n't have to do anything with religion . 
  i mean you can have a church wedding but primarily it 's a legal thing done by a civil authority . 
  we say ' \u017eivita na koruzi ' - ` they live on a corn ' . 
  do n't ask me why coz i do n't know . 
  crowded , that 's what it is . 
   tiny ass country 11million + population ok ... 
  i do to . 
  i usually hit an upvote in that case if i did n't already . 
  you can see parents sitting on the sides and up on the 2nd floor and later dancing with their kids . 
  it 's not obligatory to attend this . 
  we have vocational programmes * lower vocational education ( npi ) - lasts 2 years , you only need to finish 7 out of 9 years of elementary education or finish adapted elementary education to get into these . 
  this is considered the lowest secondary education . 
  it 's basically to provide a basic secondary education and profession even for those who are n't mentally , phisically or in any other way capable of finishing other levels of education . 
  you can get professional eduction in wood processing , assisting in construction technology , assisting in biotechnology , assisting in technological processes , transforming textiles . 
  * secondary vocational education ( spi ) - lasts 3 years , you need to finish elementary education or npi . 
  you can get a profession such as administrator , seller , hotelier , gardener , florist , nurse carer , mason , carpenter , drywall constructor , ceramist , electrician , toolmaker , car repairman , hairdresser , chimney sweeper , forester , butcher , heavy construction machinery operator ... you can continue with 2 years of vocational technical education after finishing spi and after that you can get into tertiary education . 
  * secondary technical education - lasts 4 years . 
  you can get professions such as economic technician , kindergarten teacher assistant , gastronomic and tourist technician , health care technician , cosmetic technician , horticultural technician , construction t. , environmental t. , electro t. , computer t. , chemistry t. , ... and lots more . 
  basically technician professions . 
  these schools have been gaining in popularity a lot because after you finish it , you 're left with a profession . 
  after finishing gymnasium , you have no profession at all . 
  you can get into all professional bachelor programmes after finishing this or write an exam from an aditional subject at matura exam to get into some academic bachelor programmes . 
  * gymnasiums - these are considered as general education . 
  only students with good grades in elementary school are supposed to attend this schools . 
  there are different types of gymnasiums . 
  regular one , classical gymnasium ( main class is latin , more history and philosophy , less biology , chemistry and physics ) , sports gymnasium ( for students with high athletic potential ) , euro-gymnasium ( learn more about europe and languages ) , technical gymnasium , economic gymnasium and art gymnasium . 
  there 's also a few catholic gymnasiums ( though you do n't have to be catholic to attend ) and waldorf gymnasiums . 
   are there some careers , ( i 'm thinking pedagogy in particular ) , that are considered `` vocational '' in your country that are not in the us ? 
  i do n't know what 's considered vocational there . 
  the only ` pedagogy ' profession you can get with secondary education is kindergarten teacher assistant . 
  for everything else you need tertiaty education . 
  preschool education ( as in kindergarten teacher , not assistant ) is the only professional bachelor study programme in pedagogy field , the rest are all academic bachelor study programmes . 
   is there less of a stigma about it in your country ? 
  there 's a bit of a stigma for lower and secondary education programmes as you need to do real bad in elementary school to not have an option to attend secondary professional education or gymnasiums ( if we do n't consider students from adapted elementary education - students with special needs ) . 
  also because they 're mostly schools for immigrant population . 
  american proms are for students only , our graduation dance is done infront of parents and teachers and we dance quadrille , waltz , tango and similar . 
  we have dance classes throughout the last year . 
  the only simliarity is dancing in a ballroom . 
  there 's nothing american about it ? 
  probably a bit more than czechs . 
  you 're the least germanic of germanic nations . 
  really ? 
  everyone here is taught about celts . 
  my city was one of the major towns of noricum . 
  no , nothing like that here . 
  like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj4ymmplews ) . 
  edit : that 's graduation dance usually held around march . 
  then at the end of a school year there 's a [ graduation parade ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjitm82l7hy ) . 
   just give back triest excuse me ?? 
  well i know plenty . 
  even my neighbours deep in the countryside of styria . 
  one of them have a vegan farm and always have plenty of visitors which i assume are vegan as well . 
  idk percentages though and it 's possible that vegans are over represented in my area . 
  who knows . 
  [ primorje dialect group ] ( https://youtu.be/eane5etcnt4 ) and indian/pakistani accent . 
  idk why people dislike it , i think it 's so funny . 
  greece for sure . 
  then italy . 
  and then uk . 
  i generally go with ` you are what culture and values you were raised in ' . 
  you can live in japan but if you 're raised in portugese culture and values you 're more portugese than japanese . 
  this is a very debatable topic . 
  is that 450 $ ( x2 = 900 $ ) ? 
  that 's not even a lot for a city like prague . 
  that 's pretty much minimum even for a village like ljubljana . 
  there 's a thing called ` key giveaway ' at the end of school year where the winning 4th grade from a previous year makes up games in which 3rd graders compete in to win the key . 
  ( also a thing at the end of elementary school ) . 
  [ example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvadv_qybfg ) then there 's a graduation parade where students dance quadrille in city centers accross the country . 
  it has spread to other countries as well in recent years . 
  [ example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qosopu4y58w ) some classes also do pranks on their class teachers . 
  it does here , that 's what i 'm saying . 
  how many times do i have to repeat it ? 
  it does here , that 's what i 'm saying . 
  vacation here translates to ` po\u010ditnice ' . 
  ` po\u010ditek ' means ` rest ' .
