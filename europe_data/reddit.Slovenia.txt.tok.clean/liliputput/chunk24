  that means a weak of doing nothing . 
  travelling to the us would be called ` potovanje ' - travelling . 
  i loooove those designs !, 
  7 years living there has rubbed on me a well : / though i find mb way way way way way way times infinity more arrogant . 
  ljubljana is love . 
  mb can piss off . 
  if you even read my comment you would n't have to assume i 'm from ljubljana . 
  so n is red and s is yellow ? 
  they just leave a parcel at your doorstep if you are n't home ? 
  postmen here deliver in the morning when most people are out . 
  they leave a note if you have anything you need to pick personally like packages , stuff you need to sign . . 
  our post offices have turned into [ mini-supermarkets ] ( http://images.24ur.com/media/images/360x240/mar2017/b73596db33_61901607.jpg?d41d ) ... 
  apparently postmen now even sell tools while delivering mail . 
  as a slovenian i know how most people say the name of our capital . 
  it 's ljubljana . 
  the only people that call it lublana are people from ljubljana and area . 
  i am well aware historically speaking ljubljana was lublana , but it 's 2017 and it 's been ljubljana for quite a while now . 
  it 's the same as people claiming we call celje cele in celje but in reality no one does . 
  why exactly is it sad i do n't know italians call it like that ? 
  is it sad most austrians do n't know we call graz gradec , klagenfurt celovec , villach beljak , zollfeld gosposvetsko polje ? 
  that argument holds no water at all . 
  and no , most slovenians do n't avoid lj 's . 
  it 's ljubljana , not lublana . 
   oh good , if you 've never heard of it or witnessed it , it must not exist . 
  in my 27 years of exsistence i have never witnessed anyone turning nationalist hearing a word laibach and much less lubiana that most do n't even know . 
  you must hang out in some really weird circles to know people that do . 
  get rid of your arrogance . 
  idk , i 'm fine with this one , but i would n't mind changing it to green , lighter blue and white colour scheme as it was suggested years ago . 
  i would miss this coat of arms though so i hope it would be incorporated in the new flag . 
  vacation here means spread out on the beach for at least 7 days . 
  no one goes to the us to do that . 
  us is a travel destination , you go there to see things . 
  well , they have to take care of people outside of the ambulance as well , so that they , you know , do n't end up inside the ambulance . 
   but lubiana and laibach can bring up some nationalist ideas in some people . 
  never witnessed , never heard of something like that happening . 
  lubiana means nothing at all . 
  i do n't know either but to be fair , i 'd be concerned also if they put it next to my house . 
   how good is cell coverage in slovenia ? 
  [ pretty good ] ( http://www.telekom.si/pomoc-in-podpora/teme-pomoci/pokritost-in-dostopnost/pokritost-mobilnega-omrezja ) , except in some deep valleys and mountains . 
  and sometimes too much forrest blocks it as well as is the case at our weekend house . 
  i have to run around searching for signal . 
  at some spots i get nothing and then i move 10m and get perfect lte . 
  and people and animals still live !, 
  can you believe it ?!, 
  to our environmentalists defense , there really are plenty of bird and other animal species living in that area where they want to build a wind farm that are endangered . 
  but there are so many protected areas and protected species here we 're running out of space where to put stuff . 
  oh there was so much stuff about this on tv here a few years ago . 
  round tables during prime time and all that . 
  every time they want to put it somewhere someone complains and it ends up on news . 
  they put those very bumpy short narrow ones in a village i drive through because of a school near by and they had to remove them because of noise as well . 
  that and environmentalists caring for birds and other animals . 
  that 's why we have 2 , yes , only 2 windturbines in the whole country . 
  you ca n't build anything here because everything is a horrible pollutant and environment changer , then you want to build something that does n't pollute ( except for noise ) and you ca n't build that either . 
  everything . 
  from building new factories to building new highways to building wind farms . 
  every sort of development is hindered by people who are unwilling to change their surroundings . 
  we have tons of civic initiatives going on . 
  edit : they 're not allowed to build a road because of butterflies . 
  not very much . 
  even christmas is not my thing . 
  i do it for the presents and dinner with my parents :p i see catholic traditions as catholic traditions , not as slovene traditions . 
  food , i 'm not really into this heavy type of food , i do sometimes crave ajdovi \u017eganci with sour milk . 
  i follow tradition of hiking regulary and i 'd love to have a beehive and a hayrack . 
  it used to be f1 , now it 's more motogp and mxgp . 
  there 's also a bit of speedway but it 's not on tv , so not as popular . 
  gauda , edammer , trapist , ementaler probably . 
  i do n't know , i probably can but my mind does n't register it anymore . 
  i do n't care . 
  but they could at least learn how to pronounce ljubljana . 
  it ai n't that difficult to pronounce j 's as y 's . 
  when i was a kid , all through the 90 's and early 00 's . 
  earlier than that as well , but you know , i was n't alive back then . 
  my family usually camped in novigrad and kor\u010dula . 
  i guess it was popular decades ago . 
  you 'll still see an old lady with one in church every now and then but it 's rare . 
  yes , camping in croatia or slovene coast was a norm . 
  it used to be mostly slovenes , austrians and germans in camps . 
  for sure . 
  i 'm a huge fan of leibniz biscuits . 
  only amongst close relatives and very bestest of friends . 
  i really know very little slovene music , especially what 's on the radio right now . 
  i like stuff from dan d , like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysyzyi9japg ) , [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1ay4a34dcc ) [ ( original ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjzryu0geog ) and [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc7bzdjnsd4 ) . 
  big foot mama - [ led s severa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exmotec3e5g ) orlek - [ ko so lipe cvetele ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knepwinaqte ) stuff by [ vlado kreslin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpaxusi2tmw ) zmelkoow - [ bit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpta5i0rk2e ) tinkara kova\u010d - [ veter z juga ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zthjfj3uhao ) and for some reason [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpju5ep2zxy ) is always stuck in my head . 
  i love lebanon . 
  i do n't like balkan/se european music part of the culture . 
  i can not stand it . 
  even \u010devapi ca n't make that music barable . 
  dancing in a circle in a weird posture looks so awkward . 
  i also agree with u/itsacaragor about roma culture . 
  [ just ~ ~ no ~ ~ nein . ], 
   k\u00e4sekrainer horror !, 
  bosna is a sausage ??? 
  we saw a food truck in vienna that had bosna written all over it and we laughed because we thought it has something to do with bosnia . 
  student food is very cheap here . 
  it 's subsidised . 
  in mb you can even get sandwiches for free . 
  probably [ \u017eemlja ] ( https://www.hofer.si/fileadmin/_processed_/7/1/csm_34662_zemlja_kakslo_okus_tradicije_ret_01_dpd-1_dd13aafff5.jpg ) or [ kajzerica ] ( https://www.hofer.si/fileadmin/_processed_/2/a/csm_34661_kajzerica_kakslo_okus_tradicije_ret_01_dpd-1_15dce2b489.jpg ) with [ poli ] ( http://c2157932.r32.cf0.rackcdn.com/deal_119354_popup.jpg ) . 
  i was talking about [ this ] ( http://www.globalimportexp.com/images/cache/large/pionir/pionir_negro_original_100_l.500.jpg ) . 
  people here love french cars . 
  clio has been the most popular car for a long time .
