  and i see tons of peugeot partners and suv 's . 
  if they were shit , even if they 're cheap , people would n't buy them . 
  they 're probably good value and quality for price . 
  hungary still has negro . 
  you know the drill . 
  one country in ee = whole ee . 
  punto 's are ( were ) considered the worst possible cars here . 
  taste is not equivalent to quality . 
  i find food in other countries tastes worse than food i get here . 
  it does n't mean our food our their food is better quality . 
  it 's what i 'm used to . 
  very rare . 
  there 's probably less than 200 of them . 
  we never had a lot of jews . 
  that 's not a viral video . 
  i have never seen that one . 
  [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqqvejypgle ) was viral and became a meme . 
   yes , you can . 
  for example , if you get a tourist visa you can legally enter then simply never leave , therefore becoming an illegal immigrant . 
  the op was :  why are illegal immigrants deported if they try to enter the eu legally . 
  they are n't illegal if they try to enter legally . 
  they become illegal if they exceed their allowed stay . 
  that 's logical but that was n't asked in the op . 
   if they believe you 're entering the country to work i 'm pretty sure they ca n't deport you solely on their hunch . 
  but i guess they can deny you entry . 
  if you know all the answers to your questions , why are you asking then ? 
  ski flying finals in planica . 
  what does he have to do with this ? 
   why are illegal immigrants deported if they try to enter the eu legally you ca n't be illegal if you entered legally . 
  if an airplane carrier allowed you to get on an airplane without a proper visa ( if you need one ) , then they screwed up and have to get you back and they have to cover the costs . 
  if you do n't need a visa to enter whatever country you landed in then i do n't know why you 'd get deported . 
  you can enter illegaly and ask for ab asylum , then they ca n't deport you but can decide that the country you were last in was safe enough for you to ask for asylum there . 
  that 's just not true at all . 
  being a refugee does n't mean you 're poor . 
  your money does n't magically disappear when your rights are violated . 
  i think it 's not ` recognized ' in most eu . 
  i know that insurance does n't cover it in most , if not all eu . 
  it 's probably a new kind of procedure , not yet tested here or something , idk . 
  or maybe because it 's not ` adequate ' . 
  someone from a medical field should know how this goes . 
  the last case with the girl form mb , insurance decided to cover it . 
  so looks like he 's now on a whitelist . 
  sure but more nationwide or areawide than local . 
  like collecting clothes , construction material , etc. 
  for people whose houses burnt down . 
  usually companies help with renovation for free . 
  stuff like that . 
  we also collected money for one ( or two ? ), 
  kids with feet deformities who wanted a surgery with dr. paley in florida . 
  our national health insurance does n't cover it because his technique is n't officially recognised yet , or something like that . 
  people here complain as if we have the longest lines in the world . 
  [ ours ] ( http://www.slovenia.si/fileadmin/dokumenti/misc/grb.html ) is very simple .

  hello ? 
  he used to be a model . 
  and you 're still going ... on and on and on . 
  you just listed one pro in your previous answer : cheap . 
  get over it , some people like to travel by bus . 
  i do n't know why you expect other people to feel the same way as you . 
  some people chose cycling as their way of travelling long distances . 
  i 'd never do that but i do n't think they 're insane . 
  jesus christ , you 're really nitpicking here now . 
  a simple topic has turned into you nagging about bus travel . 
  a lot of people chose public transport as a way of travelling . 
  a lot . 
  sounds like you do n't have much experience in more adventurous and slow pace travelling . 
  it 's ok if you preffer to travel ` in style ' , but to call every one else insane is a bit much . 
  maybe to you , obviously not to everyone . 
  curtains do . 
  most people take care of their sweatiness one way or another . 
  it 's not like you 're in a bus 45 hours straight . 
  i traveled by bus in tunisia for 3 days all the way down to douz in a bus without air con . 
  i survived . 
  obviously bus is n't the most comfortable way of travelling but it has it 's pluses , like every other way of travel . 
  lots of people travel by public transport . 
  buses nowadays have air cons ... 
   white bread that looks like this we call that toast . 
  so pretty !, 
  jesus christ , how clogged up are your motorways ? 
  and people here complain if it takes them 10 min longer than usual to get somewhere . 
  am i ? 
  i love road trips . 
  if i had time and money i 'd chose bus/train/car over airplane everytime i go somewhere . 
  i 'd probably chose to ride on local roads instead of highways as well . 
  houses looked kind of like [ this ] ( https://www.rogatec.si/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/%c5%a1mitova-hi%c5%a1a-avg.04.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://www.podezelje.com/pics/maxi/a55ef6ec3cf7cd61865efff7d4f16c46.jpg ) . 
  some houses were smaller , some bigger . 
  these examples are for small farms . 
  people who made money making wine had [ these ] ( https://www.rogatec.si/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/vini%c4%8darska-hi%c5%a1a.jpg ) kind of houses . 
  then they had [ these kind of barns ] ( https://www.rogatec.si/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/img_1310.jpg ) to store equipment in . 
  it was kind of like a hayrack/barn mix . 
  we had one like this but way bigger and back in the day they kept pigs , crop , wine , a tractor ... in the bottom part and in the upper , wooden part , they stored hay . 
  idk if they ever had cows , but probably they did . 
  smaller version of that were [ pigstalls ] ( https://www.rogatec.si/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/100_0006.jpg ) . 
  then they had [ hayarcks ] ( https://www.rogatec.si/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/toplar-foto-tomo-jeseni%c4%8dnik.jpg ) for hay , corn , to store exuipement . 
  [ album ] ( http://imgur.com/a/8txol ) of different types of hayracks . 
  the wealth of a farm was usually measured by how big the hayrack was .

  we call them polish toilets .

  farm tourism is very big here .
