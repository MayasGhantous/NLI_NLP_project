  i guess for ny that would be times square , paris would be somewhere around eiffel tower and other squares , but what 's in la ? 
  if i google ` los angeles ' i mostly get la skyline , hollywood sign and santa monica pier and random neighbourhoods . 
  i have a relative who 's been living in australia since the 60 's . 
  he 's married to a german . 
  i like [ primorje / slovene littoral dialects ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eane5etcnt4 ) , some more than others . 
  i 'm baffled over why people care about a passport colour : / i agree with someone else , it 's the stamps i miss . 
  what else ? 
  well if you live alone with only your benefits that would be very very difficult . 
  but there are some sneaky people who make it work . 
  unemployed people get around 295 $ here . 
  if you volounteer you get some extra , depending on how much you work , maybe 100 $ extra . 
  not sure . 
  if you have kids you get more . 
  i think 222 $ for the eldest child and 193 $ for every next child . 
  you can also get subsidised rent and emergency social benefits ( for paying old bills , buying new basic apliencees ... ) . 
  you can get this per month or per year . 
  you can get maximum ~ 1500 $ per year for a single person and max ~ 4400 $ for a family . 
  there are some rules for receiving emergency benefits such as needing to spend them in 45 days and you also need to show receipts . 
  you can also ask red cross or karitas to help you with bills . 
  i had a coworker who worked for a minimum wage that said , she 'll never work for a minimum wage again because she can live just about the same with all the benefits . 
  this is just theory , i do n't know how it really works . 
  i was confused coz , how could anyone know his mistress ? 
  is that a french thing to not be secretive about it ? 
  you can probably count sikhs here on fingers of one hand . 
  i do n't think many people know about sikhism and i do n't know what they 'd think they are . 
  edit : [ this ] ( http://val202.rtvslo.si/2013/12/mehtab-singh-indijski-sikh-v-sloveniji/ ) is ( was ? ), 
  the only sikh here . 
  he says he was accepted very well . 
  yes ? 
  that 's what they are , immigrants . 
  i do n't think they would just drop their real nationality and consider themselves slovenes anyway . 
  i know i would n't . 
  but if someone consideres themself slovene , i 'd consider them that myself as well . 
  was n't she his teacher in high school ? 
  she 's like 25 years older . 
  i can see plenty of other books on that list . 
  when i was in school our letters looked like american ones . 
  but we were never given practice sheets like that . 
  the teacher just wrote a letter on a black/whiteboard and sometimes in your notebook . 
  in later grades , 4th and on i think , we were taught cursive . 
  and we were encouraged to write cursive from then on . 
  at first we had to write with pencils and later with fountain pens . 
  left handed kids had [ this kind of pens ] ( https://www.kopija-nova.si/documents/kopija-nova.si/large/21992.png ) . 
  our teachers are ` vaccined ' against anything uniformed . 
  kindgarten teachers are n't allowed to give out copies of colouring books to kids because that limits creativity . 
  edit : 1 . 
  [ here it is . ], 
  ( http://www.zalozba-izolit.si/uploads/gallery/plakat3.jpg ) this is the kind of letters we were taught when i was in school . 
  7 with a dash . 
  1 with a slope . 
  mine too !, 
  i do n't even count how many times i have read it anymore . 
  i decided i 'm gon na start collecting the books in different languages now . 
  thank you , that 's an interesting fact . 
  tkam is one of my favourite books why would someone downvote you ? 
  mexicans would love it here then, 
  yea , pretty much the same as here . 
  just swap serbian fo slovene . 
  op sounded like like russian classics is all you read lol, 
  [ the one and only ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7gfnagyes8 ) ( not really , but there 's too many to list ), 
   winning eh , sometimes . 
   d\u00fcrrenmatt we had to read die physiker for matura exam . 
  i loved it . 
  teachers have a bit of freedom what to choose , but there are guidelines . 
  it 's kind of like this ( this may be old but it 's stil around this lines ) : * sophocles - antigone/oedipus rex * a few bible stories * cervantes - don quixote / boccaccio - the decameron / shakespeare - romeo and juliet / hamlet * linhart - ta veseli dan ali mati\u010dek se \u017eeni / kreft - kranjski komedijanti * pre\u0161eren - krst pri savici * tolstoy - war and peace / dostoyevsky - crime and punishment / stendhal - le rouge et le noir / flaubert - madame bovary * jur\u010di\u010d - deseti brat / kersnik - jara gospoda / tav\u010dar - viso\u0161ka kronika / slovene realism short prose * gogol - the government inspector / ibsen - ghosts / wilde - salome / chekhov - the cherry orchard * cankar - hlapci / za narodov blagor / kralj na betajnovi / pohuj\u0161anje v dolini \u0161entflorjanski * world novel of 19th or 20th century by choice * grum - dogodek v mestu gogi / od ivana preglja do cirila kosma\u010da * bulgakov - the master and margarita / kafka - the trial / camus - the stranger and additional 1 or 2 works by choice in every year this is for home reading . 
  there are also other works or excerpts they do in school . 
  really ? 
  why ? 
  what about slovenia : russia 2010 qualifiers ? 
  haha greece, 
  oh those were the times of pavel nedved . 
  do you even do any other sport other than skiing and ski jumping ? 
  ( football ) the one i remember the most was slovenia : yugoslavia on euro 2000 . 
  we were leading 3:0 until 67th minute . 
  then 6 minutes later it was 3:2 and another 7 minuntes later it was 3:3 . 
  and yugoslavia had a player less . 
  though in my memorry we were leading till the last 6 minutes lol . 
  i 'm not even sure what usual temperatures are anymore . 
  they fluctuate too much . 
  it was around 16 - 20 \u00b0 c here today . 
  i guess that 's normal . 
  i have heard from commentators while watching skiing world cup that the snow in the us is diffenet . 
  that 's all i know . 
  i have only skied in the alps . 
  i 've been to the sahara desert in tunisia and egypt . 
  it was hot as i immagined but also dry so not that difficult to survive . 
  comming out of an air conditioned hotel in douz was a bit of a shock though . 
  parades are for acceptance by society , not only legal acceptance . 
  besides , they 're fun . 
  why ban something fun ? 
  when lgbt + become widely accepted , parades will go away on its own . 
  equal in every way . 
  [ yes ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ofihgwa.jpg ) this does n't show even smaller subgroups though . 
  a saying here is `` vsaka vas ima svoj glas '' , meaning : every village has it 's own voice/dialect . 
  that 's what i found . 
  i ca n't find any actual numbers , but they 're protected . 
  i think this year they start june ~ ~ 19th ~ ~ 26th and end on september ~ ~ 4th ~ ~ 1st . 
  it 's always ~ ~ mid june ~ ~ 2nd half of june - around 1st september ( depending on what day 1st september falls ) . 
  edit : other school holidays are : * autumn holidays : 1 week - end of october/beginning of november * new year holidays : ~ 1 week - christmas day - january 2nd ( 2.1 is still school free day ) * winter holidays : 1 week - 2nd half of february * may 1st holidays : 27th april - may 2nd ( may 2nd is still work/school free day ), 
  i met some french girls who were blown away that people make cookies at home and have chickens in their backyard .
