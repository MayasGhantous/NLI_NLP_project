  ok ... that is a whole other level of bizarre . 
  prekmurje , bela krajina , the coast ( kras , gori\u0161ka brda included ) . 
  heck , thinking about it , what even is slovenian culture we all have in common apart from avseniki , bees and potica ? 
   maybe slovenia if they want people here are getting wet . 
  i am very aware of other nationalities posing as syrians . 
  i worked in a camp during the wave and from what i have heard there were a lot of tunisians , egyptians , maroccans and others trying to apply as syrians . 
  even some bosnians . 
  that 's why they later started employing actual syrians , afghanistanis ... as translators to analyse their accents . 
  in early days of the wave , before they limited entry to only syrians , afghanistanis and iraqis ( if i remember correctly ) we even had refugees comming to us complaining that majority of other refugees are n't syrians . 
  but is it syrians ? 
  or is it other migrants ? 
  i doubt they keep track of nationality of criminals . 
  or do they ? 
   all but the newer/bigger ones look like time capsules from the 90s . 
  that is a perfect description !, 
  we supply pyrenees with bears . 
  there 's this one bear name pyros , that we gifted to france in 1997 . 
  he 's very dominant and has a very strong libido and is probably a father , grandfather ... of almost all the bears in the pyreness born in the last 20 years . 
  so in 2006 we sent another bear , balou , his sponsor was gerard depardieu , to help diversify bear population . 
  french people did n't like him and tried to get rid of him . 
  he was shot once , but he survived . 
  in 2014 he was struck by a lightning and died . 
  he impregnated a female bear just a few days before his death . 
  last year we sent anoter one , goiat , to hopefully diversify population . 
  chat as in cat in french or chat as in english for small talking ? 
   european green lizard , i have seen one of those and thought he escaped from someone 's home . 
  i 'm just reading our forums and apparently wild cats can mate with domestic cats and it 's not rare that they do . 
  edit : i should have read the whole thread before repeating what people have already said . 
  huh , i wonder if i have ever seen one , thinking it 's a normal cat lol . 
  they look like fat domesticated cats . 
  every third tick here is infected with something . 
  we have the highest rate of tick-borne diseases in the world - . -, 
  haha like some sort of a mythical creature . 
  most have n't even seen one in the wild . 
  i think spar here is the most reasonable price-quality-variety wise . 
  i quite like mercator in celje for everything but meat . 
  i like the way the store looks after it has been renovated . 
  and when i lived in ljubljana i mostly shopped in maxi since i lived close by . 
  but yeah , it has been going down since the whole debacle with agrokor . 
  tu\u0161 supermarket has always been shit , even after the renovation it seems off . 
  but regarding neighbourhood shops , when i still lived in celje , i preffered tu\u0161 over mercator by a long shot . 
  i like hofer 's quality , but it always seems messy and cold . 
  jager and eurospin are just lowest of the lowest . 
  edit : mercator now has lobsters in a small tank . 
  i very much doubt it anyone buys them , so what 's the point ? 
  i think it 's horrible . 
  like mini mouse racoons !, 
   sheltopusik yes !, 
  i knew it had a different name but i could n't find it !, 
  yea that 's where we got it from . 
  it 's definitely one of the oldest dishes we have . 
  i googled spar scotland and it 's completely different than whan we have here . 
  we mostly have interspars which are big supermarkets in malls . 
  i 'm aware of 1 spar but it 's still bigger than what you have . 
  then we have spar city which are little shops in the old city centers and they 're good quality . 
  interesting to see the difference between countries . 
  i 'd say mercator interspar e.leclerc * tu\u0161 hofer lidl jager eurospin, 
   in 2014 , a camera trap in the hluhluwe -- imfolozi park captured a large spotted genet riding on the back of two different buffalo and a rhinoceros . 
  this was the first time a genet was recorded hitch-hiking . 
  [ 41 ] wow !, 
  that 's almost more disgusting than fire salamander . 
  i remembered after i already posted . 
  no , it 's a dormouse . 
  sqeeeel !, 
  we have [ these guys ] ( http://c8.alamy.com/comp/a4kwcy/european-dormouse-siebenschlfer-glis-glis-europe-a4kwcy.jpg ) . 
  sad to say , but some people eat them . 
  [ no lie ] ( http://www.rtvslo.si/news-in-english/slovenia-revealed/dormouse-hunting-is-an-important-slovenian-tradition/323873 ) . 
  [ slow worms ] ( http://cdn1.arkive.org/media/06/062851cb-db0f-4d65-843c-e7298127d151/presentation.large/slow-worm.jpg ) are also legless lizzards but a bit different to the one in the photo . 
  we call them ` slepec ' which kind of mean ` blindy ' . 
  idk why , they 're not blind . 
  one of this worm things once fell from a tree directly on my friends head . 
  they 're so yucky . 
   seeing a hedgehog was exciting for me the first time wow haha i think [ dormouse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dormouse ) is something you do n't have . 
  they are real !, 
  i found out about them from [ robert irwin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8m-kthvtxa ) . 
  i do n't mind snakes but if i saw this in the wild i 'd probably throw up . 
  edit : [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legless_lizard ), 
  [ there 's quite a bit of them . ], 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_bison#reintroduction ), 
  i think [ this ] ( http://www.thereptilezoo.com/images/content/leglesslizard3.jpg ) things are bizarre . 
  they 're not very unique though . 
  it 's been known for decades ? 
  since they indroduced them back into the wild after all the wild ones ~ ~ went ~ ~ ( wtf ) died . 
  this is a talk about work during high school , not during uni . 
  i know no one that worked after school in high school and i still do n't and i 'm in contact with many high schoolers . 
  one of my classmates worked over weekends and that 's about it . 
  others only worked during summer . 
  summer job and weekend job is student work , i think that 's pretty clear . 
  it is pretty well known those dog food brands are the crappiest thing you can feed to your dog . 
  i hear good things about krka . 
  revoz ( renault ) has a very bad reputation . 
  they struggle to find people willing to work for them . 
  it 's illegal to work if you 're under 16 , after that , you can get summer jobs ( very common ) or weekend jobs ( less common ) . 
  no one works during school year apart for work practice at a comapny , that depends on what kind of school you go to . 
  those are paid . 
  i do n't see how any kid would have time to study and go to work after it . 
  beside , they 're still kids , they need free time . 
  scb languages , german , tagalog and somewhat japanese ( spoken only ) . 
  dutch is pretty easy to decipher as well sometimes if it 's written . 
  i ca n't get past those choking sounds when it 's spoken though .
