  what are you on about ? 
  the eff is a legal abortion for men ? 
  no one can force a woman to abort a baby if she does n't want to . 
  do you know what legal means ? 
  because it 's not his body ? 
  yea ... no . 
  you can have croatian istria if you give trieste back to slovenia . 
  and forget about the isonzo valley . 
  mushroom picking is very popular in slovenia . 
  most popular mushrooms are boletus ( porcini , rough-stemmed bolete ... ) , chanterelles , parasol mushrooms and others . 
  and of course truffles . 
  i 'm not too keen on mushrooms so these are the ones i know . 
  most popular dish is definitely mushroom soup . 
  we also eat eggs with mushrooms and fried parasol mushrooms . 
  edit : also pickled mushrooms . 
  most people pick their own mushrooms so they 're not widely available in supermarkets , except for button mushrooms , shitake and a few others . 
  because istanbul is gorgeous . 
  also true that serbia 's population is significantly smaller . 
  and their budget ... which has to be taken into account . 
  serbia has more than novak ... 
  when i said i 'm from slovenia those who did n't know slovenia thought i was from sweden . 
  idk , does it sound similar or what ? 
  never did they confuse us with slovakia . 
  weird . 
  but i was surprised how many knew of us . 
  apparently there 's a lot of travel shows about slovenia in japan . 
  well there are a lot of japanese tourists here . 
  yes , yes i did . 
  said the italian ... 
  belgians are the worst drivers . 
  not sure wether you wanted big cities or small cities are ok as well . 
  here 's a few slovenian cities .

  sounds similar to the system in my country . 
  except that it 's free here . 
  which is n't all that good because many do n't take studies seriously as they do n't have to pay anything . 
  plus we get subsidised meals . 
  have you considered studying somewhere in europe where tuition is free ? 
  it 's free for all eu residents in my country . 
  for full-time students , that is . 
   veeeery expensive how much is `` veeeery expensive '' ? 
  lol, 
  there should be a subreddit for this . 
  it would be awesome to see dorms around europe , would n't it ? 
  is uni not free in lithuania ? 
  how much on average is one year ? 
  can you enroll at any age or is there a limit ? 
  wow , that really is a bad dorm o_0, 
  i 'm pretty sure that was slovenia ... 
  what ? 
  who ever said anything about him being his own person ? 
  get out . 
  unmarried births have been a norm in slovenia for years . 
  it was n't unusual even three decades ago . 
  some things are more self-evident than others . 
  i meant region of ex-habsburg monarchy and greater german reich . 
  how much of your own history and history of the region do you know ? 
  so you 're representing a minority of theology students . 
  there 's nothing wrong with your post , it 's a good post , i just think you should have pointed it out as that part of your post does n't represent `` regular '' students . 
  i find it hard to believe many non-theology students attend these masses , so it 's only fair to point out you 're representing theology students , not general students . 
  because we usually do n't go to church . 
  especially not on week-days . 
  what ? 
  a regular wednesday of a slovenian ** theology ** student in an off-year . 
  i 've been out of school for a while now . 
  but even back then we had a `` european village '' project . 
  it was divided between regions/cities . 
  every school in a region/city got a european country ( not only eu ) to make a project on . 
  we worked on it for a whole school year and then around europe day we had stands in the city center to present `` our '' country to locals and other schools . 
  we made famous landmarks out of cardboard , cooked/baked traditional dishes , handed out little flags danced traditional dances etc. 
  during the school year the whole school would learn about that particular country . 
  we had theme days , made traditional food at a household class , did traditional woodwork and other art stuff etc. 
  we got a new country each year . 
  [ link to photos ] ( http://www.celje.info/mladi/evropska-vas-2013-v-celju-eu-si-ti-foto-in-video/ ) no idea what they learn about eu in particular today . 
  it 's illegal but decriminalized . 
  meaning you ca n't be punnished for selling yourself but you will be punnished for procuring . 
  we have `` apartment/private prostitution '' and `` exotic club prostitution '' . 
  you wo n't find prostitutes on the streets . 
  they 're usually brought in as `` exotic dancers '' from romania , hungary , ukraine , moldova , dominican republic , thailand etc. 
  they work in night clubs and as said before , if it 's found out they 're forced or arranged to prostitute there will be legal actions against procurers/madams . 
  private prostitutes call themselves `` sellers of love '' . 
  you live in a weird place then . 
  it 's certainly not like that in the rest of the `` east '' . 
  i have an alpine dachsbracke !, 
  uh no ... you just pulled that out of your poopie hole . 
  we eat normal ham and cheese pizzas in the east . 
  no heavy topings . 
  margeritas are popular as well . 
  never heard anyone wanting lots of meat on a pizza . 
  you get what you get . 
  and i get the same kind of pizzas near the italian border . 
  uh , no ? 
  men and women are equal in slovenia . 
  meh , peope do n't even get married in slovenia . 
  we learnt from the best , our northern neighbours . 
  your coast is so well protected , it 's invisible .
