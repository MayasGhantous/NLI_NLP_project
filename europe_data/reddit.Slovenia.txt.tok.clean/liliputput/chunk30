  it was soft jelly in this almost flat plastic and we then used that plastic to pour in plaster and make dinosaur shaped things .

  not to give you any ideas , but you could probably invade us in an afternoon . 
  i have also heard of the onion packs . 
  also sliced potatoes on your feet while you 're sleeping to get rid of a fever . 
  lol . 
  officially not much . 
  homeopathy has just recently been officially decriminalized . 
  before , a doctor could lose a licence . 
  people widely use herbs in forms of tea though . 
  we have a saying `` za vsako bol , travca raste '' which means - for every sickness there 's a ` grass ' ( herb ) . 
  honey is also very important . 
  chiropractics are used , so are other kinds of healers , easpecially bioenergetics . 
  there 's tons of ` energy points ' around the country . 
  and some people actually believe this things help . 
  years ago , i remember there was this thing on tv about sleeping in a cave , probably connected with bioenergy , but i 'm not sure . 
  there 's [ this russian healer guy ] ( http://www.maksimosipov.com/en/ ) who 's supposed to be one of the best healers in the world that works here . 
  i remember when my uncle had a cancer , they tried every available alternative medicine option . 
  they planterd tons of aronia and visited many bioenergetics . 
  my mom also believes in a ` tapping technique ' : / . 
  she goes to some meetings like once a year and supposedly there 's quite a few people there . 
  but i have never seen her use it . 
  [ like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu0lexeq-80 ) . 
  lol [ kind of relavant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwv5zlyod2m ) translation : `` if tina maze misses 1st place by couple of millisecond , she 's still very good . 
  but if we missplace a cyclon path by less than 50km , everything is wrong . '', 
  there 's tons more , i 'll continue next time you make a daft ` joke ' . 
  what ? 
  theres tooooooooons of space between a joke and an insult . 
  it was just a bimbo statement . 
  there was nothing joke like about it and you know it . 
  sure , they would n't say it 's cruel to give that name to a child though . 
  that 's not how you use sarcasm ... 
  really ??? 
  if lulika was a name in norwegian , i would n't go and say that 's a cruel name to give to a child just because it has a weird name in slovene . 
  that 's just stupid . 
  gaber is n't funny either because i had no idea a similar word in serbo-croatian has a weird meaning . 
  gabor , a hungarian name still is n't funny now that i know it means ` an ugly person ' . 
  idk , [ kranjska gora ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=bohinjska+bistrica&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjssq7w4tbtahvnqpokhrrscz8q_auicigb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=638#tbm=isch&amp;q=kranjska+gora ) maybe . 
  [ strmec ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=bohinjska+bistrica&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjssq7w4tbtahvnqpokhrrscz8q_auicigb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=638#tbm=isch&amp;q=strmec ) , not exactly a town , just a settlement . 
  what is a prison gang ? 
  i do n't see how saying ` xx is a cruel name to give to a kid ' is a joke . 
  but what do i know . 
  especially since it 's a pretty normal name here without any sort of a bad meaning . 
  i 'd understand if a name in question was tit or something completely weird , like severina . 
  you almost ca n't run out of pretty french towns . 
  and ... people are supposed to become botanist before giving names to their kids or what ? 
  hornbeam is also hardwood , also known as ironwood . 
  everything is possible with you people . 
  no , my name starts with 's ' . 
  you have so many prettier towns than that . 
  we speak slovene , not croatian . 
  no one even thinks of what a name sounds in croatian . 
  it 's pretty idiotic to look at foreign names like that . 
  better run to that finnish family about to name their daughter rauha , because it sounds similar to raufnk which means chimney . 
  because jasen is such a special tree . 
  not to mention ru\u017ea . 
  sounds like `` ru\u017ean '' . 
  yea because people consider what their names sound like in some random language ... 
  your name probably sounds like ` butthole ' in some random african language . 
  how terrible !, 
  why would that be cruel ? 
  it 's a tree . 
  yep . 
  ajda - buckwheat , klementina - clementine , jagoda - strawberry , jelka - fir , vi\u0161nja - tart cherry , zarja - dawn , luna - moon , tisa - taxus bor - pine , brin - juniper , svit - dawn , gaber - hornbeam , lev - lion , maj - may and so on . 
  [ i like it ] ( http://images0.zurnal24.si/slika-_original-1308042391-71091.jpg ) . 
  18-22 , sunny , with slight wind . 
  preferably with a 90 % humidity ? 
  personal stuff is for after school . 
  we have civic education in ethics class though which mentions multiple religions . 
  i experienced quite a few in japan . 
  the worst one was 6 . something . 
  no one even budged . 
  and i was like o_o ok . 
  i have n't been there at night , but during the day it seems ok . 
  very peaceful with lots of young families . 
  i was a bit apprehensive going there for the first time but it was n't any different than any other neighbourhood . 
  i was a kid back then so i can only speak from a child 's perspective . 
  it was great . 
  absolutely great . 
  my parents managed to buy an apartment in the city , buy an old house with quite a bit of property , tear it down and build a new one which we used as a weekend house . 
  i spent every weekend there , at my cousins or at my grandmas . 
  my grandma had 2 cows and barn cats . 
  she sometimes had little calves and i would spend my days with them laying in hay . 
  we went camping to novigrad in croatia every year and skiing a lot . 
  every now and then i went on holidays to ba\u0161ka in croatia for 2 weeks which was organised by the city i lived in . 
  you did have to pay , but it was cheap because the city has a house thingy there . 
  i also had some health issues i so went there for free twice . 
  there 's a lake near my city , around 7km from where i live and me and my friends would rollerblade or cycle there almost every day in the summer . 
  even though there were no mobile phones , parents did n't worry . 
  other days we went to the pool . 
  mcdonalds was a place to celebrate birthdays in . 
  but i wanted to be different so i celebraited in dairy queen . 
  i also remember watchig a lot of mtv and german viva . 
  and buying bravo magazine . 
  my first concert was the kelly family in 1998 . 
  as a kid i was n't really aware of the scale of a war going on so close to us . 
  we had quite a few bosnian refugees come to our kindergarten and later school and i 'm stil friends with a few of them . 
  as u/pp86 already mentioned , we got shares . 
  my parents let me decide which ones i wanted ( stupid ! ),
