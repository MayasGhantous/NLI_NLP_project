  and i wanted the ones that had santa in a commercial . 
  they were n't any good . 
  but years later , i think i was around 13 , i sold them and bought myself a first digital photo camera . 
  most people i know have fond memorries of the 90 's . 
  all in all , i would do it again . 
  i still do n't know how they 're different than just putting n + j and l + j as seperate letters together . 
  anyway . 
  but are they any diffrent ? 
  or what 's the reason they 're seperate letters ? 
  i just checked . 
  huh ? 
  why ? 
  are they any different than just putting n and j or l and j as seperate letters together ? 
  we only have \u010d , \u0161 and \u017e in our alphabet . 
  we also have accented vowels * \u00e1 , \u00e0 * \u00e9 , \u00e8 , \u00ea * \u00ed , \u00ec * \u00f3 , \u00f2 , \u00f4 * \u00fa , \u00f9 but we do n't write accents on them so they 're not extra letters in our alphabet . 
  dialects have other letters like \u00fc in prekmurje dialect for example . 
  d\u017e , nj and lj are n't alphabet letters . 
  never but i had sips since i was little . 
  it 's not sometimes , it 's always . 
  radio si has a combination of slovene , english and german news . 
  radio capodistria is in italian and mmr in hungarian . 
  we learnt in school that celje and la\u0161ko are closest to literal language today . 
  me being from celje , i 'd say la\u0161ko is closer as they havel less accent . 
  but then with daily and permanent migrations from villages around it 's all starting to mix again anyway . 
  really ? 
  i have never heard of that . 
  : - / maybe a regional thing . 
  any sort of indian curry , falafel , sushi , katsu curry,

  though fire burning is a pagan thing , it 's mostly asociated with worker 's day today . 
  there are speaches and celebrations , people go hiking , go to the coast or to the spas . 
  may 1st and 2nd are work free days . 
   is there a time of day or week when pretty much everything is closed ? 
  naah , just major holidays , like today , christmas , easter , new years ...  can you easily get basic supplies , like milk or common groceries in the middle of the night ? 
  nope . 
  you can get water and stuff at 24/7 gas stations . 
  not every gas station is 24/7 though . 
   can you get food at some sort of restaurant ( fast food or anything ) at night ? 
  nope . 
  some stands like kebab stands are usually open a bit longer on friday and saturday nights but definitely not whole night . 
   do bars close at a set time where you live ? 
  yes . 
   are stores that are open late more like convenience stores , with small selections and high prices , or large stores like walmart ? 
  they all close by 9pm . 
  there are no set rules on opening hours so every mall/supermarket has their own . 
  but usually mon - fri malls open at 9am and close at 8 or 9pm . 
  same for saturday , though mall in my city opens at 8am . 
  sunday they open at 9am and close at 3pm . 
  smaller neighbourhood markets usually open earlier . 
  the one i go to opens at 7:30 am and closes at 8pm during week days . 
  on saturday it closes at 5pm and sunday at noon . 
  in the summer they have longer working hours and close at 9pm mon-sat and 3pm on sunday . 
  lidl opens at 8am and closes at 8 or 9pm . 
  and on sundays it opens at 8am and closes at 1 or 3pm . 
  years ago we had a referendum and decided all stores should be closed on sundays and holidays but the law was never put in force . 
  is maja an old-ish ( not that very old ) name making a comeback ?
