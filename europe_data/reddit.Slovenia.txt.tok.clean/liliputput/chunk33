  [ schengen borders code : systematic checks of eu citizens crossing external schengen borders mandatory as of today ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/news/schengen-borders-code-systematic-checks-eu-citizens-crossing-external-schengen-borders_en ) though in the text it says `` eu citizens who are crossing the eu 's external borders '' . 
  idk . 
  i believe schengen is deemed as external border here as they 're regulated by eu . 
  even before this change you as a eu citizen could be checked at any border crossing if they deemed necessary . 
  you can also be id checked in your own country . 
  what has a boarding pass got to do with you being an eu citizen ? 
  and yes , schengen is a border free zone , not eu . 
  there are new rules in place since april 8th , stating everyone needs to be checked entering and exiting , eu citizens included . 
  i also do n't know why asking where you 're from is a ` no-no ' . 
  malta is a schengen state , bulgaria is n't . 
  and everyone else that is not them . 
  the worst we have are `` za otroke '' ( for children ) and they 're against gay marriage and adoption . 
  they wear yellow hats and bring kids to their protests . 
  they 're mostly old people and a few church going families . 
  we never had anything against neither lj nor mb . 
  we 're not 2nd , we 're 3rd . 
  ` eternal buttmad ' is just mb . 
  latest reports are 90 or 92 plus a teacher and his son . 
  no , i think they 're a breeding hot spot for mould and bacteria .

  only in the winter though !, 
  i hate that i have to dry my clothes outside in the summer because water where i live is super hard and no softener helps . 
  and my drier lets out way too much heat to be used in summer . 
  i 'm waiting for this one to break so i can get the one that does n't heat up . 
  but it 's by gorenje and they last forever . 
  that 's the best job ever !, 
  better than counting cars by colours we had to do in geography class . 
  haha me to . 
  with an old fat husband . 
  i do n't know anyone who uses it except for politicians , journalists and those who want to sound smart commenting on political stuff . 
  she seemed pretty offended by my idea . 
  i still think something around those lines would be good . 
  doing service and at the same time figuring out if profession you want to choose is good for you . 
  in my opinion , professions such as teachers , nurses etc. , everyone who deals with people need some sort of a sift to get rid of everyone who 's shit in dealing with people/kids . 
  and it obviously should be done before they apply for college , waste our money and their years of study . 
  optional social service . 
  coz i said it could also be used as kind of a pre-test for those applying to certain universities such as medical professions and education . 
  idk how exactly it went but a certain woman was pretty adamant that my idea is utterly stupid , saying she and her friends already had enough schoolwork and that , for example , helping people getting around in hospitals would not help students decide in any way . 
  that 's possible . 
  no , but if it has to happen , then gender neutral . 
  i would also welcome an alternative option of service to society . 
  the last time i suggested this in slovenia subreddit , i was attacked that it 's a stupid idea . 
  getting a bit too ` attacky ' now . 
  why thank you . 
  yea , it 's not a question for reddit users . 
  there is no common etiquette for the whole world . 
  very difficult to judge when you understand the language . 
  you ca n't judge how your mother tongue sounds either . 
  i think it should be asked to those who do n't understand it . 
  i think pancetta is raw and lardons are smoked . 
  and lardons may be any sort of fatty meat cut into pieces . 
  idk . 
  lardon definition probably deffers from country to country . 
  you forgot pancetta , it 's also a good substitute . 
  same . 
  sitting on cold floor with give wolf to your bum . 
  to be fair , driving with an open window can give you bells palsy . 
  tested personaly . 
  same goes for ac or a fan blowing in your face . 
  yes , i 'm pretty sure . 
  well , idk if it 's technically a mass , but they pray and stuff and bless the food . 
  also in may , a mass is held every single day . 
  to me americans make really rounded whiny sounds compared to english of british isles . 
  you sound so american . 
  pretty much the same here . 
  it used to be paid well , but now it 's paid shit so most people who join are those who could n't get a job anywhere else . 
  there are of course also those who are just really interested in military stuff . 
  they make good goulash here . 
   what is your opinion of your military ? 
  nothing really . 
  i sometimes see them running , the green they wear is ugly . 
   do you know any soldiers ? 
  what made them join ? 
   do you think the allocated budget is about right ? 
  probably not . 
   if shit hit the fan and there is war on your country 's soil , do you trust your army would do its job ? 
  definitely not . 
  ew , as a carbonara lover , even i 'm offended by that photo . 
  though i use parmesan instead of pecorino romano and bucatini instead of spaghetti . 
  but i think bucatini are ok to use . 
  we have those ticket things too . 
  but if there is no line it 's usually turned off or they tell you you can come forward without a number . 
  even some mcdonalds places have that system . 
  you order food and get a number . 
  then when your number appears on a screen you can go and get your food . 
  is n't that table manners everywhere ? 
  it 's normal to wait until everyone is served before eating unless those waiting tell you it 's ok to start eating without them . 
  at a bigger event you wait util everyone at your table has food , but you do n't have to wait util everyone at every table has it . 
  i agree . 
  no reaction is better than the most witty reply someone can come up with . 
  it 's like you 're talking about slovenia . 
  some time ago there was a segment during a sunday tv talk show about solving spats between neighbours . 
  a tree hanging 10cm over to your land - lawsuit . 
  wanting to put up a different fence - lawsuit ... 
  yep , it 's a holiday here . 
  17th april , easter monday is a day off for everyone . 
  i 'm not religious so i 'm speaking out of memorries here . 
  on easter saturday you gather [ easter food in a basket ] ( http://kozjansko.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/images_slike3_dscn1675.jpg ) .
