  you cover it with a nice kitch napkin . 
  kids have their own little easter baskets . 
  you take them to a local church or a [ cross ] ( https://s1.mojalbum.com/15320681_15320940_15432774/kulinarika/blagoslov-velikonocnih-jedi-pred-horelom-v-zrecah.jpg ) where a short mass is held and they bless food in those baskets . 
  then you go home and in my case , the whole family gathered at my grandmas , cousins , aunts and uncles and all and we ate stuff from those baskets . 
  then everyone would take leftovers and eat them the next morning . 
  that 's all . 
  i 'm not aware of any traditions on easter monday so i do n't know why it 's a work free holiday . 
  edit : easter bunny also brings little gifts to kids ( eggs , chocolate bunnies , oranges , easter themed candies , money , t-shirts ... depending on family ) and hides them under bushes . 
  i 'm not a kid anymore but i still get these presents from my mom , aunt , uncle and grandma ... : / easter traditions in other parts of the country may be different . 
  [ easter tl ; dr ] ( http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/going-to-grandparents-house-vs-leaving.jpg ), 
   i 'm an atheist , i 'm neutral to slightly irritated when it comes to easter . 
  i do not like the part when everyone you meet greets you with '' \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435 ! '', 
  ( `` christ is risen !, 
  '' ) , and you are supposed to answer with '' \u0412\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0443 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435 ! '', 
  ( `` indeed risen ! '' ) . 
  i 'd just go ` aha ' . 
  no , my world has green , yellow and red . 
  well rome is a bit of a different thing . 
  i have never seen a sign like that here . 
  maybe i just was n't paying attention , maybe those signs are only in churches frequented by tourists . 
  porkamadona is used a lot . 
  our swear words are weird so we have to steal them from other languages ,, 
   maribor / styria - eternaly buttmad about being second , annoying hey now , maribor is not the whole styria . 
  celje politely steps away from mb insanity . 
  they annoy me as f * ck . 
  makes me puke just reading his name . 
  the difference is the law and the reason why one crossroad has a traffic light and the other does n't . 
  obviously there is no need for a traffic light so you look left , right and left again . 
  when it 's clear you go . 
  idk why that 's important . 
  nyeh , i still would n't do it . 
  it 's there for a reason and there is no reason for me to walk over at red light . 
  it 's only a minute wait . 
   exactly my point !, 
  sorry but i do n't get your point here . 
   are you seriously debating sexuality is taught and not just innate ? 
  in a childhood , yes . 
  if an adult man sees breasts and first thing he thinks is ` sex ' , well , i think there 's something wrong with him . 
  hiding female breasts from kids , teaching them they 're only to be used in a sexual matter is teaching them all the wrong things . 
   see where i 'm going with this ? 
  nope . 
   if you go somewhere where there are other couples sexing it out , here we go again ... 
  there 's nothing ` sexing it out ' about going topless . 
  female breasts are just rounded , saggier male breasts . 
  why do n't you find male breasts ` sexual ' ? 
  they have nipples , they are used for sexual arousal . 
  they 're just flat . 
  is it a common place for a car to speed over at a red light ? 
  i guess you ca n't expect people to obey traffic regulations if you do n't either . 
   would you make out with your bf/gf in a bus , or go topless ? 
  how is the beach any different ? 
  are you really comparing a bus to a beach ? 
  a beach is there for relaxation , it 's somewhere you go to get a tan and take a dip in the sea . 
  you obviously wo n't do that with clothes on . 
  a bus is a transport sistem to get you from place a to place b. 
  you do n't take your clothes off doing that . 
   wrong . 
  source : i 've been a kid . 
  also , i used kids as an proxy example to get a point across . 
  i am a sexually active adult and i still find sexually provocative displays and behaviour in public places indecent . 
  so someone taught you that kissing/showing love and breasts are a sexual thing ? 
  that 's a shame . 
   balls are just balls and vaginas are just vaginas too , but people do n't go around showing them off . 
  because they do n't feel comfortable doing so . 
  you should n't cross at the right light . 
  will it kill you to wait a minute for the green man to turn on ? 
  nope , but a speeding car might . 
   going to a church , dress appropriately that sort of thing . 
  i think that 's a us thing . 
  there is no special attire to wear in a church here in slovenia . 
  sure , it would be weird to wear a bathing suit but shorts and a sleeveless shirt are fine . 
  the only thing i find annoying is littering !, 
  pick up your crap and put it in your backpack !, 
  weird is everyone who does n't . 
  i 'm on a road to get somewhere , not to die because some weirdo finds traffic regulations stupid . 
   young couples : please do n't go topless or make out in the beach , there are little kids . 
  so what 's wrong with kids seeing nipples and people kissing ? 
  do n't sexualise them . 
  they 've no idea about sexual stuff . 
  besides , breasts are just breasts . 
  stop looking at them as a sexual object . 
  it 's the same here . 
  and after 2 years you need to attend a class on how to react on slippery roads , sudden obstacles and similar . 
  it looks like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1lytyiyavi ) . 
  there are more execercises . 
  i think the class lasts around 8 hours . 
  or [ this ] ( http://www.cracked.com/blog/robert-evans-investigates-truth-behind-salamander-brandy/ ), 
  that 's all i have to say . 
  always sounded very russian to me . 
  a mix between serbo-croatian and russian , i guess . 
  yea , it says it 's from slovakia ... 
  what ? 
  it 's schnapps , not tea . 
  and no tatras here ... 
  it 's still a lot better than [ our combination ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7mruz4m1tk ) few years ago . 
  i heard he went back to being a man . 
  supposedly conchita was just a stage thing . 
  in our case , [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7mruz4m1tk ) ... 
  i do n't think yodeling is traditional in romania . 
  forgot ` boring as hell ' .
