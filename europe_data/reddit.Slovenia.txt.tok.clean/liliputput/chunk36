  we 're not taking about people trying to speak literal language . 
  even if they try to speak literal , prekmurci do n't . 
  from my experience la\u0161ko does speak the nicest slovene , celje has a bit of an accent but it 's still a lot better than what comes from the mouth of prekmur\u010dani . 
  i 'm not sure but i think it 's based on lower and upper carniolan . 
  however , i have heard many say that today , it 's celje and la\u0161ko area ( styria ) that speak the closest to standardized slovene . 
  some time ago there was a huge billboard with boobies in ljubljana . 
  that describes are perfectly ... hm . 
  community gardens ? 
  i 'm sure those things are common in most of europe . 
  best of both worlds sounds better :p, 
   beer/vodka vs wine  potatoes vs pasta  butter vs olive oil  ordnung vs mess  toned down vs loud  coconut vs peach culture based on that , i 'm not exactly sure where we belong ... beer and wine potatoes and pasta butter and olive oil ordung and mess toned down unless when on wine or beer coconut culture, 
  i use that one a lot as well . 
  pretty sure places like ibiza and some greek islands and similar are way more known and popular . 
  they 're annoying . 
  bad represantation of \u0160tajerska . 
  i can only immagine shit we 'd be in if mb was a capital . 
  it would n't be nice . 
   which i think is the only island in slovenia . 
  those sneaky italianos !, 
  mmmm and ` motovilec ' !!!, 
  so much goodies in spring !, 
  nope . 
  at least being our neighbours is n't a reason . 
  i cheer for italy in football but that 's about it . 
  and it 's not because we share a border . 
  i do n't feel any particular connection to any of our neighbours . 
  i cheer for whoever i like the most out of those two countries . 
  we have [ kurenti ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5sfkzdrtdg&amp;t=272s ) and [ poka\u010di / ora\u010di ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mltfvcjogga ) . 
  wild garlic is huge here . 
  there 's lots of it in a forest near my house and everytime i drive thought it , it smells so good . 
  my mother goes crazy picking it . 
  sometimes noobs will pick the wrong thing and poison themselves . 
  there 's warnings on tv every year . 
   spargelzeit a thing here too . 
  there 's an area where wild asparagus grows and people flock to pick them and italians , as usual with other stuff as well , come with vans to pick every possible thing , that 's why we need laws how many kg of stuff can one person pick ( mushrooms , chestnuts , blueberries ... ) . 
  how do you take a shower or bath ? 
  or do you believe santa recognises you by your own specific smell ? 
  it 's common sense , it does n't have to be put in a law . 
  it is !, 
  it 's just a mistake , it happens . 
  nope , you fixed the first one into italian . 
  um , the first one is french , second one italian . 
  m\u00fcller has it . 
  i do n't know where you got that from and what that has to do with anything but it 's wrong . 
  maybe serbs and croats but we certainly do n't have anything against them . 
  [ capitol ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/united_states_capitol_-_west_front.jpg ), 
  i do n't think there 's a more paranoid nation than us . 
  maybe v4 countries . 
   90 % + slavic christian we do have a high percentage of immigrants though . 
  that 's a totaly diffent bread . 
  edit : but the one on op 's photo looks like one . 
  bread they use here at doner kebab at city hall in celje is definitely nothing like lepinja . 
  [ you sure ? ], 
  there are even sub groups in sub groups . 
  i think it would do good if there was more than steaks and bbq and other dishes already available in other restaurants . 
  i mean it would probably do good with only that as well but it would be silly to miss an opportunity to offer some new food . 
   december / gruden ( ? ), 
  frozen earth is usually clumped together . 
  wrong . 
  smallest : [ 10 cents ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/sl/7/73/kovanec_010.jpg ) . 
  i remember a couple years ago bosnia and slovenia were playing and majority of supporters on the stadium were bosnian . 
  uh excuse me , but most of the country is not . 
  i would n't even consider romania to be on the peninsula unless you draw a straight line . 
  then  50 % of it is . 
  there 's also movieland , aquapark and safari park . 
  i do think it was discriminatory they banned you , or rather did n't accept you , based on your nationality . 
  someone needed to tell them what they 're doing is wrong but you could have done it in a better manner . 
  can you not ?

  where does that travelling thing come from ? 
  old stories ? 
  they stay put here . 
  they do n't move anywhere . 
  probably daily . 
  lots of old albanian and bosnian women wear them . 
  sardinia is my fave . 
  our turkish coffee came from bosnians who prepare it a bit differently . 
  i have heard of various ways to prepare it . 
  even from turks . 
  everyone i know boils water with some sugar and adds coffee after the water boils . 
  then boils it again . 
  i took a different approach and put sugar and coffe in warm water , then boil it . 
  after it boils , i boil it once more coz i hate that foam on top , which i guess turks and bosnians find necessary . 
  everyone loves my coffee . 
  it 's free , unless you study part time , then it 's 1500-4000 $ per year , depending on the course . 
  part time studies are for those who begin a course when they 're 26 or older , those who were n't accepted to regular studies but do n't want to wait another year or those who have a regular job and ca n't attend classes every day ( usually those with an established career ) . 
  part time courses are usually only held in the afternoon and only few times in a week so most students have regular jobs and can pay for their studies from that . 
  what ? 
  it 's a typo , calm the fuck down . 
  it has nothing to do with grammar . 
   grammar  * is the way in which words are put together to form proper sentences . 
  * and no , it 's counts of cilli and surely you knew ulrich well enough to know the way he was . 
  there . 
  greek island culture . 
  i want to wake up in my little stone cottage , a stone throw away from pretty sea , stumble into my little boat , go fishing , grill a fish for lunch , go into town and play board games with other old greek men and then in the evening sit on the stairs and watch people passing by with a grin on my face . 
  do n't know about that , but the habsburgs inherited all the cillis estates which made them the most powerful family and vice versa would happen if cillis inherited whatever was signed with inheritence agreement . 
  still , thank god . 
  if you want mineral water , who does anyway , you 'd say you want radenska , which is a brand of mineral water and a synonym for it .
