  people only drink mineral water with home made wine ( spritzer ) . 
  noricum coins were minted in my city . 
  area around celje was 1st settled in neolithic and bronze age by the hallstatt culture . 
  then it was settled by taurisci , a gallic tribe , around 300 bc . 
  it was known as keleia . 
  noricum coins were minted here . 
  then the romans came around 15 bc and renamed it to celeia . 
  it got its first city rights under the name ` municipium claudia celeia ' in 45 ad . 
  it was also known as * troia secunda * or ` second troy ' . 
  there 's a roman road going through it , connecting aquileia and pannonia ( roman province ) . 
  it was a very known rich roman city with then famous temple of mars . 
  counts of cilli dying before the hapsburgs . 
  they had a contract between the two , that whichever family outlives the other family , inherits everything from the other family . 
  so if hupsburgs died first , counts of cilli would get everything hapsburgs had and would rule the lands . 
  but a bimbo hungarianm l\u00e1szl\u00f3 hunyadi , assassinated the last of cilli 's , ulrich ii , in belgrade which meant the end of the whole family .

  i have a feeling it 's the same person over and over again with multiple personalities . 
  it 's kind of odd there 's so many slovene bimbos on here compared to other countries . 
  none . 
  i think this was the deadliest terror attack in europe .

  water here is very hard . 
  if i did n't dry towels in a dryer it would feel like wiping my body dry with sand paper . 
  and no , vinegar does n't do shit . 
  or simply barbie . 
  nope , people here rather live in rural areas than cities . 
  it varies from region to region and within regions depending on landscape . 
  it 's best to just drop the yellow man randomly on the google maps . 
  i 'll try to gather some photos , it 'll take some time . 
  it 's semi popular here because it 's the only fastfood restaurant we have . 
  if you do n't count kebab stands , horseburger ( only in ljubljana ) , one other burger stand ( hoodburger - only in lj ) and one burger king .

  footbal : saudi arabia - . - how can we be good at everything but the most popular sport ? 
   this one is a real rivalry between the two greatest alpine skiing nations on earth .

  i do not agree with that !, 
   when ~ ~ we ~ ~ kosteli\u0107 's used to be good at skiing i remember sweden 's anja persson was ~ ~ our ~ ~ their biggest nightmare .

  the most protection they get is [ this ] ( http://siol.net/media/img/fd/43/afc1aab84049a01d9f6b.jpeg ), 
  we do n't have trams . 
  on the buses there 's plexi glass or plastic behind them but nothing on their side . 
  googling it now , i guess some do have plexi glass on sides as well . 
  in ljubljana city buses , no , because you get off at the back of the bus . 
  in the little buses in the city i used to live in not many people use buses so you can get off in the front and yes , people usually say ` bye ' or ` thank you ' when they get off . 
  i do n't think i have ever ridden an inter city bus but i think that people do say ` bye ' and ` thank you ' . 
  when going on a bus trip you say it everytime you leave a bus for a longer period ( like going sight seeing , hotel etc. ), 
  but usually not when the bus has a ` pee stop ' . 
  really ? 
  what does that look like ?
