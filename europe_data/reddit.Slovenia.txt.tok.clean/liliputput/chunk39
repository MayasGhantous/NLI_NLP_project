  that 's not true at all . 
  i know many people who watch it on tv . 
  it 's broadcasted regulary . 
  jakov fak and teja gregorin were pretty popular few years ago . 
  lebanese people use those and others a lot . 
  i always thought they 're acting bimbos . 
  like it 's some sort of a teen thing . 
  you mean schwa ? 
  there definitely is . 
  i do n't think you can say those words without it . 
  like over here we have words like ` smrklja ' , ` zvrst ' , ' \u010dvrst ' and ' \u010dmrlj ' . 
  and many shorter ones . 
  you say them like ` sm\u0259rklja ' , ` zv\u0259rst ' , ' \u010dv\u0259rst ' and ' \u010dm\u0259rl ' . 
  what he wrote , we 'd say like ` st\u0259r\u010d p\u0259rst sk\u0259rz k\u0259rk . ', 
  i ca n't believe [ this one - alenka bikar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feujtujodko ) is in politics . 
  not a pretty face though imo . 
  [ eva irgl ] ( https://www.sds.si/sites/default/files/styles/politician/public/politicians/big_eva-irgl.jpg?itok=p7ubtjhf ) is by far the prettiest . 
  to bad she 's believes in shitty things and she 's a part of a shitty party .

   donnchadh \u00d3 laoghaire his name sounds like it wants to choke you when you say it . 
   the neverending story nope nope nope nope . 
  nope . 
  that 's one of the creepiest things i 've seen as a child . 
  i still shiver whenever i see pics of it . 
  yep , i 'd say amerika 1st , zda second . 
  no , it 's despicable that they 're asking for permissions . 
  when they do it without telling anyone , no one even notices . 
  i have seen quite a few of them in maribor and have heard no complaining from mb and we all know all they do is complain when they do n't like something . 
  they might not have been refugees , but what else could they have been ? 
  they were somali and afghanistani from what i could tell . 
  and this was just twice when i went shopping to europark . 
  so-so . 
  i have 310km to vienna and 318km to venice . 
  that 's less than 200 miles . 
  you can certainly do it as day trips , it 's just ~ 3 hours . 
  but it 's not something you 'd want to do every day or even every weekend . 
  huh ? 
  where did you go to school ? 
  all the schools i know had the same schedule . 
  edit : did you go to high school after they added obligatory warm lunch ? 
  idk how you managed to be done by 2:15 if you had a 50 minute break and 8 classes . 
  i 'm to lazy to calculate it . 
  start at 7:10 or 8:00 45 minute classes 5 minute recesses 20 minute snack/lunch break end of school 13:10 , 14:00 or 14:50 . 
  that 's for high school . 
  coz i ca n't immagine eating it with mince meat . 
  icky . 
  i have never ate burek with anything else but cheese . 
  * [ gumitvist/elastic game/chinese rope jump ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3h-1b2yyos ) was one of the most popular games . 
  * [ kdo se boji \u010drnega mo\u017ea / who 's afraid of a black man ? ], 
  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke16kveo9qk ) - black man is meant as a boogeynan , not a black guy , just to clear that out . 
  one kid stands on one side of the gym/playground and the rest of the class on the other side . 
  then the conversation goes like : ` who 's afraid of a black man ? ', 
  ` no one ! ', 
  ` but what if he comes ? ', 
  ` then we run ! ', 
  ` where ? ', 
  ` to the other side ! ', 
  they start running towards eachother and the ` boogeyman ' tries to catch as many as he can . 
  those that he catches are then his helpers and this goes on until they 're all boogeymans and there 's no one else to catch . 
  * [ gnilo jajce/rotten egg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv1imiubkki ) . 
  kids sit in a circle . 
  one of the kids has a ball or a piece of paper crumbled into a ball and goes around the outside of the circle saying : ` i 'm carrying a rotten egg , i 'm not giving it to anyone . 
  whoever looks back/peeks , gets a slap on the back . ', 
  while saying that , he drops the rotten egg behind someone 's back . 
  the kid that gets the egg then has to catch the dropper before the dropper sits into his place . 
  if he does n't catch him , he 's the one carrying a rotten egg now .

  * [ zemljo krast/stealing land ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duutvqoygyo ) . 
  kids draw a circle and then partition it on however many players there are . 
  everyone picks a country to name their ` land ' . 
  one of the kids holds a stick and says : ` i 'm stirring , stirring with a stick and i throw it into ( pick a country ) . 
  and then i 'm not sure how the rest goes . 
  i 'm old .

  i mean this is a really difficult topic and i agree with you , especially on the effect on young people , but should we stop racial profiling on the expense of safety ? 
  this is not only keeping us safe , but them as well . 
  and how exactly do we know he was always stopped because of his colour ? 
  i have never been stopped by police but i know plenty who have been stopped multiple times . 
  and it certainly was n't because of racial profiling , they 're all white . 
  it comes down to multiple factors . 
  as a white person living in vast majority white country i obviously have a very difficult time stepping into shoes of non-white people . 
  i also think everyone is reposnsible for their own actions . 
  if someone is so easily manipulated into criminal behaviour , then he should face whatever punishment he gets . 
  do police stop random people walking the streets in whatever country you 're from ? 
  i 'm guessing the netherlands . 
  by law , they can do that here in slovenia but i have never seen or heard of anyone being stopped randomly . 
  thanks for this answer . 
  do people think racial profiling by police is justified considering crime statistics ? 
  they are often joked about because of that r - koho\u0161ki slovenci . 
  after a short google research , there 's more to carinthian dialects than koho\u0161ki slovenci . 
  til . 
  i 'm really trying to distinguish some words but it 's impossible .
