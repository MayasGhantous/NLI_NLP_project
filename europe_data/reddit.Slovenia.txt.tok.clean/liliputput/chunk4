  only the english version does , not the original one . 
  no , ours is about peace ... 
  why are people surprised ? 
  even british newspapers are quite prejudiced against eastern europeans . 
  and i said what ? 
  it 's not really a recent thing . 
  we had 23 in 1991 which is still lower than some have today , 13 in 1995 , 7 in 2000 and so on . 
  some are still in high school at that age . 
  that means they 're financialy dependent on their parents and it interrupts their education . 
  though i agree that once you start uni getting pregnant is n't that weird . 
  it would be interesting to see statistics for a younger population . 
  12-18 maybe . 
  socioeconomic factors probably , family stability and education . 
  openess about sex , contraception availability , those kind of things i guess . 
  oh sorry , bimbo me : / i did n't read it completely . 
  you 'd need to find adolescent abortion rates .

  edit : [ here you go ] ( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s1054139x14003875 ), 
   adolescent fertility rate is the ** number of births ** per 1,000 women ages 15-19 . 
  we are turkish airlines , we are globally yours !, 
  singing - national anthem it 's not really god for slovenia . 
  literal translation from slovene ( \u017dive naj vsi narodi ) is `` long live all the nations '' . 
  idk why , but english translation is `` god 's blessing on all nations ... '' . 
  phew !, 
  it 's markel . 
  i though it said merkel . 
  huh ? 
  no , we have none of those here . 
  albanians are who i 'm talking about . 
  perfume sprayer , plastic zipper , air-bag ( though the invention was n't accepted because it was way ahead of its time ) , hp-35 , boeing 747 ( kind of ) , cosmonautics ( kind of ) , `` neighbourly envy '', 
  no , we have it . 
  my mom usually uses it as a sort of cake spatula . 
  i would chim in a certain nationality of migrants we have here in slovenia that share the same mentality . 
  that country that has better pizza than you . 
  you speak shit . 
  only south west part is on the peninsula . 
  our cuisine is nothing like balkan and medierranean cuisine and slavic language has nothing to do with balkan peninsula . 
  i struggled to find a good meal in italy . 
  the worst pizza i ever had was in verona . 
  playing a sport in school without any rules is n't the same as playing a sport professionaly . 
  did you even took a loot at the map *, 
  who plays futsal ? 
  it was n't really amateurs but a research group that has been recording temperatures over there for 3 consecutive years prior to measuring that one . 
  nope . 
  way off .

  2nd part is even better . 
  [ music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7gfnagyes8 ), 
  and that comes after an accordion . 
  keep blabbing shit . 
  and since you 're unable to comprehend simple rules , or rather unable to admit you 're wrong , i went ahead and typed `` eurovision '' in google . 
  here are the rules from their official site :  the basics : * all the entries and singers are picked by the participating broadcasters . 
  ** these are the members of the ebu that take part in the eurovision song contest . 
  ** why ? 
  because at the eurovision song contest , it is broadcasters rather than countries that take part . 
  for example , in the uk this is the bbc , in germany it 's ndr , in sweden it is svt and so on . 
   excerpts from the rules : * a maximum of 46 active ** ebu members ** shall be allowed to participate . 
  active ** ebu members ** from a maximum total of 26 countries shall compete in the final . 
  there shall be six guaranteed places therein : the host broadcaster , five ebu members from france , germany , spain , italy and the united kingdom . 
   why does kosovo not participate ? 
  kosovo can not take part in the eurovision song contest because they are neither an ** ebu member or associate . 
  **  why does australia participate ? 
  the eurovision song contest has been broadcast in australia for more than 30 years . 
  the australian broadcaster sbs is an ** associate of the ebu ** and in 2015 , to mark the 60th eurovision song contest , was ** invited ** to submit an entry . 
  in 2016 the broadcaster asked to be a part of the eurovision song contest again . 
  the ebu reference group , the governing body of the eurovision song contest , voted unanimously in favour of australia 's participation . 
  it is yet to be decided whether australia will become a permanent participant in the contest . 
  -  i should not have expected an understanding of how the eurovision is supposed to work from a person in the balkans , of course . 
  1st of all , refresh your knowledge of geography . 
  2nd of all . 
  that sentence certainly does n't give any refference to the `` voting bloc '' whatsoever . 
  and 3rd of all i did n't mention anything about intelligence , but you did , and that definitely implies what you meant with that idiotic statement . 
  voting bloc ... as if other countries or areas do n't have `` friendly '' countries . 
  as if england does n't give ireland points every year and vice versa . 
  as if ireland does n't give plenty of points to poland and lithuania every year . 
  as if ireland does n't get points from sweden and norway on yearly basis . 
  looks like someone is just a tad bit butthurt over who knows what . 
  my country rarely gets to the finals and you 're talking about a voting block ? 
  who exactly ? 
  dear god . 
  who even cares . 
  it 's a damn eurovision . 
  i 'm done . 
   i should not have expected an understanding of how the eurovision is supposed to work from a person in the balkans , of course .
