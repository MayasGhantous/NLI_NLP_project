  i honestly do n't know any other carinthian than tina maze and one of my friends . 
  [ carinthian dialect ] is divided into 6 ( 7 ? ), 
  subgroups . 
  i know that rem\u0161nik and me\u017eica dialect sound quite different . 
  tina maze speaks me\u017eica dialect . 
  [ her accent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfedenjngjs ) does sound a bit german i think . 
  it definitely has a unique rythm . 
  [ these austrian carinthian slovenes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwp24w4omfw ) ( whatever this dialect is ) , sound very german . 
  they have that typical funny r. [ bla\u010de / vordeberg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbnzau8ms9e&amp;t=1s ) is part of gail valley dialect . 
  and then [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3gewnw3aus ) from brdo ( egg ? ), 
  is also part of gail valley dialect but sounds different to me . 
  they both have lots of loan words and sound very german in some parts . 
  but other parts sound more like upper carniola dialect rather than carinthian . 
  not surprisingly since those places are closer to uc than carinthia . 
  the only thing i found about rosen valley dialect is [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8znb1gycmi ) . 
  they have that funny r. sounds german . 
  all in all , they sound weird . 
  i 'm asking in general , not about slovenia . 
  this kind of accusations need proof not emotional stories that someone felt he was stoped because he has darker skin than average . 
  that sounds great , will have to do a roadtrip . 
  thanks !, 
  do they experience these things ? 
  are there any official statistics ? 
   rovte where 's that ? 
  not funny , but [ resian dialect ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xpbfbbhtcq ) sounds like blabbering to me . 
  i only understood maybe 5 words she said . 
  holy ... so we can expect that one day we 'll make fun of you for being small . 
  this raises a question what systematic privilage do white europeans even have over non-whites ? 
  ( as it is assumed by finish newspaper ) . 
  is that even a thing ? 
  how exactly am i more privilaged over my black neighbour ( if i had one ) ? 
  all the laws are the same for us and we have all the same rights . 
  in that case , most of us are horrible . 
  what the heck ? 
  of course . 
  of.course . 
  i ca n't find official stats . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/novosti/hrvatska/clanak/id/318022/ovo-je-tuzna-slika-hrvatske-u-2016-godini-manje-nas-je-od-42-milijuna-a-cak-840-tisuca-graana-nema-za-hranu-i-grijanje ) site says there 's 4,2 million of you lovely people . 
  you mean for watching or participating ? 
  if we do n't count football - skiing , ski jumping , handball , basketball , hockey and so on . 
  judo is pretty popular in my city . 
  it 's center-right . 
  we do n't have any right wing populist parties ( edit  yet . 
  carnivore people also have to supplement b12 a lot of times . 
  myself included . 
  i mean the percentage of vegan/vegetarian people is still a loooooot lower than meat eaters , my situation with vegan neighbours is obviously uncommon , but i think vegans/vegetarians are n't a rare thing here . 
  if you live in the countryside and have a garden and some fruit trees it 's not that difficult to live without meat in the summer unless you really love \u010devapi parties . 
  while i was studying in lj , i knew quite a bit of vegans , even some raw vegans . 
  once you know one vegan and he/she introduces you to their circle of friends , you suddenly know a lot of vegans . 
  no idea , but i 'd say quite a lot . 
  i live in the countryside and 3 out of 4 of our closest permanent neighbours ( not weekend houses ) are vegans . 
  other neighburs are quite heavy meat eaters . 
  one have quite a well known vegan farm and they always have tons of visitors . 
  vegan food is available everywhere . 
  though i do n't think there 's much variety , especially in fresh fruit and vegetables section as you can mostly only get seasonal veg and fruits . 
  right now strawberries , blueberries and other seasonal food is poor quality and expensive . 
  i thik if someone wants to have a good varied vegan diet , they need to move to some tropical place with variety of fruit and veggies availabe throughout the year . 
  people here would go public about it . 
  put pressure on the system and insurance . 
  if that fails , people donate money to cover treatment abroad . 
  lol . 
  really ? 
  and marija novak . 
  i 'm younger than that :p we had those 1 week ' \u0161ola v naravi ' thingies each year . 
  they still have these . 
  1 year we had swimming , 1 year we had skiing and other years we did different activities depending on what c\u0160od we went to . 
  i remember we went to c\u0160od se\u010da and went canoeing to a fish farm . 
  we learnt tons of stuff about sea animals and ate green algae salad . 
  we also learnt about olives and olive oil . 
  another year we went to carinthia where we did stuff in the woods and illegaly crossed austrian border on purpose . 
  we also had multiple day trips to various educational trails . 
  my school did n't have a garden but i know they have it now . 
  i remember we did a lot of gardening in kindergarten though . 
  yes , some ( most ? ), 
  schools have gardens for planting stuff . 
  not like schools need to teach kids how to plant , parents do that . 
  everyone has a garden somewhere . 
  kids also plant things in kindergarten . 
  i really do n't know why anyone would assume i 'm stupid . 
  it 's pretty offensive . 
  edit : by imprecise i mean 1 cup of flour is 128 g. sometimes recipes call for more or less of that amount . 
  i know you can also use 1/4 , 1/2 etc of cup , but it 's less precise than measuring for example 140g on a scale . 
  some recipes call for very precise measurments such as potica . 
  you make a wrong measurment and everything goes to hell . 
  i just ca n't come up with a good response to such a blatant poor assumption . 
  are you me ?? 
  i even need an exact number of apples my mum wants . 
  1kg of apples does n't do it for me . 
  yep , it 's so imprecise . 
  that 's why i think most ` cup ' recipes i use , taste weird or are weird texture . 
  a few more would n't show :p, 
  i do n't get this . 
  are your nursing homes , kindergartens ... run by the church ? 
  catholic church pretty much does nothing here , except run karitas . 
  which is badly run anyway . 
  measure them of course . 
  the cup thing is ridiculous . 
  it 's how i imagine kids cooking . 
  sorry , i did n't read your full op , now i feel like a bimbo .
