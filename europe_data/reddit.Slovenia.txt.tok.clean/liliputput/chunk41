  yugoslavia was n't a satellite state nor a ussr state . 
  what do you mean nomads ? 
  ours stay put on illegaly occupied land . 
  would love for them to ` nomad ' to the uk . 
  ours are a bit different from the rest . 
  they do n't beg on the streets but they do drive unregistered broken down cars or , on the other extreme , brand new bmws , audis or mercedes ' without licences , own guns , threaten people . 
  you know , stuff like that . 
  they also get shit tons of benefits , up to 3000 $ a months has been revealed . 
  yet they still live in squalid conditions and demand everything for free . 
  never had a single job . 
  someone has to bring you food and other stuff , no ? 
  8 out of 10 trucks here are foreign . 
  also , try being on a highway to the beach or work for millions of europeans . 
  people going north to south and people going east to west . 
  we got them all . 
  shit tons of romanian and ukrainan white vans . 
  the only people that drive in gb are those who are gon na spend money in the gb . 
  most cars here just drive through . 
  we also have road tax . 
  i think it 's around 60 $ + ~ 30 $ for an annual car check up ( do n't know what you call that in english ) and 10 $ administration cost . 
  hmm ... 
  i 'll have to go and smell haha, 
  the saying here goes `` vsaka vas ima svoj glas '' . 
  in literal translation that would be `` every village has it 's own voice '' . 
  which is pretty much true . 
  due to being under various empires throughout history and having lots of hills , people in the past from different regions did n't hang out much thus pretty much every village developed their own dialect . 
  our national tv is currently showing series about our main dialect groups . 
  edit : [ a map ] ( http://bos.zrc-sazu.si/c/dial/ponovne_sla/p/02_2_osnovna_karta_jpg.jpg ) of dialect groups and subgroups . 
  edit2 : their are variations in subgroups as well . 
   especially through the mountains where the roads are very narrow with hard turns i love those kind of roads . 
  they tire you out but at least they 're not boring . 
  we have a fair share of cow dung smell here as well : /, 
  that 's because you 're not a transit country . 
  hellooooo not every styrian is from maribor . 
  celje is styria too !, 
  i think he 's from carinthia . 
  i know they complain about roads a lot but every road i driven was ok . 
  they are windy and narrow but , well , fuck geography and people who refuse to give land to make a highway . 
  ca n't see you have to pay . 
  does strasse = road in german ? 
  street is a road but not every road is a street . 
  they are a bit better , definitely not the best . 
  it also depends on the part of the country . 
  then list some . 
  they do n't . 
  huh , we do n't have any fruit and veg shops in my part of the country . 
  albanians , bosnians , roma sell them at the open market . 
  i remember as a kid there was a bosnian stand that sold fruits and veggies in my neighbourhood but it closed . 
  i do n't know of any albanian sla\u0161\u010di\u010darna . 
  there are some albanian ice cream stands but people only buy there if nothing else is available . 
  probably something flat . 
  i do n't think there 's many books of all of our history in english . 
  [ this one ] ( https://www.amazon.com/land-between-history-slovenia/dp/3631628773 ) is the only one i could find . 
  i ca n't tell you wether it 's good or not but it 's pretty much the only one . 
  all i know is that aspartame is e951 which i try to avoid but i do n't go out of my way . 
  they have all been approved for use so that 's all i care . 
  there are 2 religious shows every sunday morning on our national tv . 
  * [ ozare ] ( http://4d.rtvslo.si/arhiv/ozare ) , a 5 minute show with one person speaking his thoughts . 
  i think the speakers can be of any religion , but i may be wrong . 
  * [ obzorja duha ] ( http://4d.rtvslo.si/arhiv/obzorja%20duha ) a 30 min show which is supposedly a show about big world religions and religious people . 
  edit : there 's also a sunday mass once a month . 
  so so . 
  more in smaller towns/villages . 
  at least in my part of the country . 
  ice cream nowadays is mostly sold by confectioneries ( ? ), 
  rather than albanian ice cream stands . 
  those albanian ones are so fake tasting and people preffer taste over 10 cents . 
  albanian bakeries . 
  tons of albanian bakeries . 
  nope . 
  we have good relations . 
  ( that 's not british english ), 
  my fave is that one where thery do this weird hand genstures . 
  when i first saw it i thought she was having some sort of a fit . 
  then i kept watching and i thought maybe she has tourette 's or something similar . 
  and then i turn the tv on a few days later and a completely different woman was doing the same thing . 
  i feel like american english does n't have an accent . 
  it 's plain . 
  winnetou is my dad 's favourite . 
  i have n't read the books , even though we have them at home , but i did watch the series with my dad when i was little . 
  multiple times . 
  my dad still watches them every now and then . 
  of course we do . 
  we learnt about kurdistan , kasmir , tibet ... in geography . 
  oh my gosh this is gold . 
  i need to start using more american english . 
   questions should relate to europe or european subdivisions . 
  / ... / european subdivisions are for example asking germans about germany , or asking germans about non-german things etc. 
  i think this should be discouraged . 
  country specific questions should be asked in a countries subreddit . 
  you can do [ kayaking and cycling ] ( http://www.podzemljepece.com/ ) in an abandoned mine here . 
  among tons of other things like [ kayaking ] ( http://www.eurotrek.ch/website/var/tmp/image-thumbnails/20000/27794/thumb__header-slider/euroaktiv-kajak-soca-12.jpeg ) , [ ziplining ] ( https://www.socarafting.si/mma/bovec%20zipline%20new%20ziplines%202/2014092216495212/youtube/mid/ ) , [ white river rafting ] ( http://www.lifeadventures.si/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/soca_white_wather_rafting_slovenia.jpg ) , [ canyoning ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1bisdgmczs ) , [ paragliding ] ( http://www.placestoseeinyourlifetime.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/top-10-paragliding-sites-slovenia-photo-by-robert-kovacs-740x500.jpg ) ... you know , stuff like that . 
  i do n't know how extreme it is since i have n't been yet , but it sounds nice . 
  idk if it will be open by the time you 'll be in europe , they 're planning to open [ trbovlje chimney ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biahxddtplc ) for tourists . 
  hello !???
