  and all those japanese ones like pokemon , naruto , dragon ball-z , full metal alchemist , bleach , death note , one piece ... 
  it 's just an indication someone 's immune system is weakend . 
  i do n't think anyoe has any particular thought about it . 
  here as well . 
  we apparently even have a team playing in austrian league . 
  austrian and german league are supposedly the strongest in europe . 
  prepositions and articles . 
  i think they are . 
  lindsey vonn looks very american to me . 
  so does young robert redford . 
  their facial structure is different to what we 're used to here . 
  that just does n't ... work . 
  i 'd feel more foreign in kiev than in paris . 
  but neither of them feel like different part of the world . 
  it 's not eastern/western divide , it 's cultural divide . 
  frankfurt and barcelona are just as different as kiev and amsterdam . 
   it somewhat feels familiar if you are from western europe already . 
  and it does n't if you 're from east ? 
  freising as well . 
  you have enough fat people already . 
  it did n't ( that i know of ) . 
  i never said it did . 
  but it was more important to us , politicaly and culturaly than ljubljana . 
  it is quite a bit different than the rest of italy . 
  if nothing else , it 's very interesting for tourism . 
  it 's sad do see how italy does n't give a shit about such a beautiful city . 
  and graz . 
  both were more important to slovenes than ljubljana . 
  edit : trieste did n't have slovene majority . 
  slovenes were only a quarter of its population , but it was a city with highest slovene population . 
  i 'm very pro voluntairy euthanasia . 
  mental ilnesses included if they , themselves can sign it . 
  of course , it would need a lot of regulations . 
  there have been some talks about it here in the past but nothing since . 
  i think it would easily pass a referendum if there was one . 
  i feel like most people are in favour . 
  no one wants to watch their loved ones suffer . 
   35 hours a week of job searching . 
  uh , that 's almost a full time job . 
  if you do that , you kind of do deserve to get paid . 
  kind of . 
  how do you even search for a job 5 hours a day , mo-su ? 
  you really think people do n't do that here ? 
  you really think someone can go decades without having a job ? 
  coz i know people like that . 
  once you play dumb long enough they do n't give a crap if you do n't send 2 or 3 job applications a month . 
  people get their basic bills paid , heck , social services are even replacing windows in their ( not owned ) apartments and renovating their bathrooms . 
  we had that too lol . 
  japan and especially korea produce good movies and tv shows . 
  cultural differences are definitely a factor . 
  and they 're made in english . 
  hollywood also gives shit tons of money for world-wide marketing . 
  and the fact that we already browse american internet sites which definitely have more hollywood than anything else ... 
  true that . 
  lol . 
  what can i say about my town of 48000 then ? 
  numerous handball players in our national team . 
  numerous football players in our national team ( not that that 's an achievement ) , one of them just signed for mls . 
  basketball player in nba . 
  numerous athletes on olympics , 6 olympic medals and one ( that i know of * ) paraolympic medal . 
  i do n't care about superbowl . 
  yes . 
  it 's celebrated nation-wide . 
  the biggest carnival is held in [ ptuj ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsvfwur1mra ) . 
  schools have mini carnivals where everyone dresses up in something and there 's usually music in the gym . 
  we also eat [ krofi ] ( http://static1.ringaraja.net/uploads/slo/articles/5223/large/dedd92eb3ebad157917f541c9994308c.jpg ) ( krapfen in german ) . 
  kids ( and adults * ) dress up as indians , chinese , gypsies , etc. . . all those things that would be considered racist in the us . 
  i once went as a japanese . 
  we had the coldest january in years . 
  it was constantly under 0 \u00b0 c. 
  it was snowing beginning of january ( around 20cm where i live ) and the snow only melted yesterday because temperatures went above 0 and it was raining . 
  there 's still patches of snow on the ground though . 
  they also put some tablets in that supposedly clean the water . 
  i traveled around japan for three months and nothing really shocked me . 
  maybe because i already knew a lot about japan ? 
  everything was pretty much as i expected . 
  i did n't understand the concept of ` culture shock ' until i went to china later . 
  china . 
  spitting out chicken feet bones and spitting in general . 
  letting kids shit on the street , stuff like that . 
  same as you . 
  i think of muslim countries . 
  when you say oriental rug , i think of persian , turkish ... rugs . 
  yes , i had to google his name :p, 
  i mean , it 's a toast . 
  everyone 's a pacifist when they 're drunk . 
  so is tito . 
   ole gunnar solskj\u00e6r i only know the dead ones and ole gunnar solskj\u00e6r , ski jumpers , skiers and ola vigen hattestad . 
   christoph waltz . 
  his mother was also slovene . 
  and goran dragi\u010d . 
  and whoever watches spanish basketball , luka don\u010di\u010d . 
  she 's retired . 
  he 's dutch . 
  they only know how to speed skate . 
  of course everyone knows it . 
  they start learning it in kindergarten .
