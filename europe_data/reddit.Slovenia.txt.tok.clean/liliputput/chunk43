  by the end of 1st grade everyone definitely knows it . 
  you can get a sticker . 
  i have it and do n't get commercial mail . 
  animal and nature conservation is very big here . 
  every time they want to build something there will be tons of environmentalists and just ordinary people being vocal about it . 
  i 'm starting to think this is some sort of a scam . 
  why would all of a sudden so many people want photos of people around the world as a gift for their loved one ? 
  it 's weird . 
  not influenced by that either . 
  since countries around the world decided that balkans is ex-yu and sometimes a few other countries . 
  belgrade new year = best new year . 
  if you 're drunk enough you can even semi tolerate turbofolk . 
  what ... 
   folk music in all balkan countries naah , our folk music is not influenced by oriental melodies at all . 
  hahahaha yes !, 
  how could that skip my mind ?? 
  i really coulnd ' t find the right words . 
  they 're made for you to learn about things in nature about nature lol . 
  made mostly for schools but anyone can walk them . 
  there 's lots of info boards on these paths and learning activities . 
  bigger groups can hire a guide . 
  we went on a lot of paths like this with school . 
   do forests typically have well marked trails ? 
  if there 's a hiking destination somewhere around it , then definitely , tons of it . 
  we love hiking . 
  love is an understatement . 
  edit : we also have ~ ~ ` learning paths ' ( ? 
  ) ~ ~ educational trails .

  i 've no idea what this would be called in english . 
  well it depends on a region , climate and all that . 
  there are around 950 plant species in our forests . 
  71 are tree species ( 10 conifer species ) . 
  [ here 's a map ] ( http://www.zgs.si/fileadmin/zgs/main/img/ce/gozdovi_slo/karte/mesanost_gozdov.jpg ) of conifer trees share .

  most of the forest looks like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/gozd_volcjipotok_1.jpg ) . 
  [ example 2 ] ( http://www.geopark-idrija.si/uploads/_images/574c01aa7e549b56db751d6cc5eefaca.jpg ) , [ example 3 ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pj1stuhxlwc/tkgj6lko10i/aaaaaaaaduy/cswh6urhpoi/s1600/pot+na+pohorje_2+%25284%2529.jpg ) . 
  most common trees are beech , spruce and oak . 
  we also have [ larch forest ] ( http://www.solcavsko.info/knjiznica/les/gorski/macesen/velike/macesnov_gozd.jpg ) on higher altitudes . 
  [ inside ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6vu_xq4_ydq/vcgjix1irki/aaaaaaaaxno/t3hqcmxze4m/s1600/dsc_1872%2bpom.jpg ) . 
  in the karst area they look like [ this ] ( http://www.gozd-les.com/novice/sprehod-skozi-gozd-november-2016 ) . 
  most common trees are oak , black pine and chestnut . 
  also sumac tree . 
  around javornik and sne\u017enik , you 'll find forests like [ this ] ( http://www.slotrips.si/sis-mapa/skupina_doc/slo/galerija/1326833745_9979_img_0510.jpg ) with european hop-hornbeam , turkey oak and durmast oak . 
  then there 's pokljuka forest with 97 % spruce trees and a lot of bog .

  our forsts are home to all 3 europe 's ` big 3 ' - bears , wolves and lynx . 
  also lots of deer , foxes and all those common animals . 
  it should be written in a side bar that country specific questions should be asked elsewhere . 
  jose adalberto benito alvarez rivera for jesus and agnieszka pakulski for mary . 
  we have sociology and philosophy as a subject in gymnasiums and some vocational high schools . 
  yea , that 's what i heard as well . 
  some were sick after it . 
   hmmmm , ~ ~ polish ~ ~ slovene pavement ... ftfy, 
  here as well . 
  and hungarian . 
  but for poland it 's mostly big foreign companies that have production in poland that have a bad rep. polish granola and m\u00fcsli is good . 
  lol few weeks ago they [ salted the streets ] ( http://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/psi-podivjali-zaradi-nepricakovanih-priboljskov-v-obliki-prsuta-na-sezanskih-cestah.html ) here ` by accident ' with salt used to cure prosciutto with little proscuitto pieces still in . 
  yea , theoretically it could . 
  only if abortion would pose less risk to the woman and her future motherhood than further pregnancy and birth . 
  but at 39 weeks that 's kind of not possible anyway . 
  and i do n't think hospital comission would allow it . 
  i mean who would abort a 39 week old fetus ? 
  i 'm sure even the most hard core pro-choice activists would be against it . 
  i think of a pope . 
  edit : and adam ma\u0142ysz . 
  early abortion , i think up to 12 or 14 weeks is an easy procedure . 
  the longer the woman is pregnant , the riskier it gets . 
  we do n't have an upper limit on abortion and the last time a woman died from abortion complications was in the 80s . 
  are you sure ? 
  an italian woman who was infected with zika virus had to have an abortion here because she was n't allowed to have one in italy . 
  edit : i guess she was 5 + months pregnant . 
  abortion in yugoslavia was legalized in 1952 . 
  the law we have today has been in effect since 1977 . 
  abortion can be performed til week 10 , which is pretty low and i 'm surprised it 's that low . 
  after 10 weeks of pregnancy it 's up to a hospital commission whether they allow it or not . 
  edit : read up about it . 
  up to 10 weeks of pregnancy you do n't have to write down a reason for abortion , after 10 weeks of pregnancy you have to have a reason but it can be pretty much anything . 
  financial troubles , family troubles ... anything . 
  the only thing is that procedure is permitted only if a risk on life and health of a pregnant woman and the future of her motherhoodof is less dangerous as a continuation of pregnancy and later birth . 
  so the longer the woman is pregnant more risky abortion becomes . 
  there is no upper limit of when abortion can be performed but i 'm positive they would n't perform an abortion on a healthy woman 7 months pregnant with a healthy baby . 
  aparently a lot of women come here to have an abortion after a legal limit in their country . 
  edit2 : underage women do n't need aproval from their parents for an abortion . 
  but girls under 16 need a prescription for a morning after pill . 
  was there a [ dog chasing them ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3grsbr0eyyu ) ? 
  boars are little , well not so little , shittheads . 
  especially mamma boars . 
  we have lots of them where i live . 
  i 'm always on a lookout when walking my dog in the woods . 
  they cause a lot of damage on crops and grass as well . 
  one of [ our bears ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1393228/bear-cub-medo-walked-familys-garden-slovenia-refused-leave.html ) that was sent to a sanctuaty in romania was bullied to death by one of your bears :(, 
  my parents live in a house surrounded by fields and forrest and have animals visiting them all the time . 
  nothing out of the ordinary lives there though . 
  deer , hare , foxes , hedgehogs , birds , wild boar , stuff like that . 
  at night when you 're driving to the house those shiny eyes can be quite creepy and you need to be careful not to hit something . 
  a fox once left a dead rabbit infront of our house , was probably scared in the morning by our dog .
