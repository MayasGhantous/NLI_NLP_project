  deer eat everything in our garden so they 're not loved . 
  there 's deer infront of our house almost every morning . 
  some villages in the south are regulary visited by bears . 
  we even had a bear in the tivoli park ( central ljubljana ) once a few years ago . 
  edit : the ljubljana bear , named ro\u017enik , was later [ illegaly killed and skinned ] ( http://www.rtvslo.si/okolje/novice/zalosten-konec-za-medveda-roznika/205116 ) in austria . 
  i was in london once , sitting outside of a hostel and a fox casualy walks by looking at me . 
  no one was making up numbers . 
  we did have a week of around 10000 people a day . 
  a month was an overestimation which was quite obvious but the numbers were still high . 
  kind of unfair to say it was badly managed , not entirely our fault when we were getting people unanounced in the middle of nowhere . 
  no one could have prepared for that . 
  no one even thought it 's gon na be in numbers like that . 
  we had capacity for around 2-3000 to stay over night . 
  slovenia was the one that called that first meeting , no one was talking about managing anything before that . 
  even though hungary was under same shit for months beforehand . 
  though their peak numbers were way lovers as ours . 
  once the numbers went down and they stopped sending people unanounced things became way better . 
  but those few hectic days were unbelievable . 
  10 buses left , 10 buses came . 
  they did n't even have time to clean the beds and pick up all the damn bread and milk people just scattered around . 
  volounteers were n't of much help at all those days . 
  they came and wanted to do everything they wanted to do . 
  some were even mad once volounteer organisations told them they have to register beforehand so that they can be managed . 
  it came down to some dangerous situations because of some volounteers . 
  so 9999 is less bad than 10001 ? 
  what camp were you at ? 
  i worked in various camps from october till end of april when they shut them down . 
  i know how it was . 
  it was a mess . 
  october and november were very difficult months . 
  we had around 8000-12000 of them daily around 20th - 28th october if i 'm not mistaken . 
  it does n't matter if we had 5000 come in a day or 12000 . 
  it was still a lot and a very difficult situation to handle . 
  especially since it was a very wet winter . 
  i will never forget the smell of those tents . 
  so cut your crap with downplaying what happened here . 
  i ca n't find better statistics by day than [ this ] ( http://www.vlada.si/fileadmin/dokumenti/si/projekti/2015/begunci/160202_migranti.pdf ) . 
  [ police page ] ( http://www.policija.si/index.php/component/content/article/190-mejne-zadeve-in-tujci/79439-aktivnosti-policije-v-zvezi-z-aktualnimi-migracijskimi-tokovi ) does n't work for some reason . 
  it was ~ october through ~ april . 
  if you 're not aware , we had 10000 people comming in each day . 
  that 's the crysis he 's talking about . 
  before the ` wave ' majority of people here said refugees should be helped . 
  during the wave and all the shit that went down , majority changed their mind . 
  you were n't here to experience it . 
  everything in the country revolved around the migrants . 
  you try to take care of that many people when countries after you only accept a few thousand a day and people keep piling up in those tents in the middle of winter . 
  it 's really nice criticizing from up there , far away from all the rumble . 
  and to answer your stupid question , we agreed to accept as many as they assigned us to . 
  we never said we wont . 
  all the countries were assigned a fair number according to their abilities . 
   but it did for about a week a week ? 
  more like a month . 
   if he has to come , then i 'd implement an idea i saw a few months ago - do n't acknowledge him , do n't give him attention , act like he 's not even here . 
  carry on with everything as if it 's just another day . 
  let him rant on twitter if he wants , but i 'm not giving him the attention he so desperately craves . 
  that will surely make him reconsider his visit ... 
  i remember an add a few months ago , looked like comic book-ish writing that said something like `` kaboom '' . 
  wtf ? 
  of course it 's gon na be ` kaboom ' if you put adds like that next to a highway . 
  if someone could prove they severely hinder road safety , maybe . 
  i personally do n't even notice them while driving . 
  lol, 
  cars : skoda they do n't look as czech as they used to . 
  i hope that poor pup is ok . 
  no one 's worse than him . 
  no.one . 
  only bimbos . 
  fyrom is way too long to say . 
  it 's macedonia for me . 
  i love russian folk music !, 
  [ probably this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqwpdy3fz9c ), 
  annoying . 
  we had an irish guy come to our class in elementary school a few times a year and that 's about it . 
  there 's enough teachers here that we do n't need foreign ones . 
  idk about uni level but looking at the list of professors and lectors , 3/10 are native english speakers . 
  we cover a lot , but because of that our knowledge is not very deep . 
  of course i 'm speaking about an average student not interested in history enough to read history books on his own . 
  one of the biggest flaws of our school system and curriculum is that we learn very little of our own history . 
  holy , do you need a montaneering equipement for that ? 
  in recent years , [ the ice storm ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/photos-of-ice-storm-in-slovenia-2014-2 ) for sure . 
  [ another set of photos ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/02/13/slovenia-ice-storm-photos_n_4776228.html ) . 
  it damaged more than half of our forest . 
  as a consequence we now have a bark beetle epidemic which will ruin even more . 
  our beautiful [ pokljuka ] ( http://sporthotel.si/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/pokljuka_zima_1-1.jpg ) forest is in great danger . 
  thousands of people were without electricity for days . 
  a train line did n't run for weeks because of ruined cables . 
  i live in an area not greatly affected but i have never seen anything like it . 
  i had to take a generator to my parents because they were without electricity for days , would have been over a week without a generator and could n't get to their house with a car because the road had 10cm of ice on it . 
  i put a generator on sleds and almost went down a steep hill a few times . 
  my dog did . 
  a sound of falling trees comming from the woods was scary as fuck . 
  branches kept snaping and the trees kept falling . 
  edit : after all the ice melted , we had huge floods . 
  we had to ask for international help especially with generators . 
  we also had quite a lot of devestating floods in recent years . 
  what ? 
  italy has a population of 60 milion and russia has a population of 145 million . 
  i 'm from slovene styria or lower styria . 
  idk what my cultural region would be . 
  definitely not adriatica .
