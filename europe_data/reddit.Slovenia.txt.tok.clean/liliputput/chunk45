  considering he 's talking about russia , i think he means ex-ussr and satellite states . 
  should ask op what he means by eastern europe . 
  the problem here are n't towns built in hills but everything in between . 
  if i wanted to cycle from my house to the train station , which is only ~ 3km away , i do n't think there 's 200m of flat road in between . 
  there 's a few very steep hills to combat . 
  our villages and settlements are very dispersed ( idk how it is in portugal ) so very few people live close to the train stations . 
  our geography is not friendly to commuters on bicycles . 
  very very common as a sport in spring and summer . 
  for commuting - common in ljubljana . 
  the rest of the country , outside of bigger cities and far east is way too hilly for that to be possible unless you want to come to work soaked in sweat * and dead tired . 
  shit . 
  i 'm gon na be beaten twice as much when i become slovene for downplaying importance of hiking . 
  i mean i would still say she 's fluent , just not c2 level . 
  my suspicion is also that she mostly talks to barron and her parents and does n't go out much . 
  who knows . 
  did we mention we like hiking ? 
  we like hiking . 
   cars i drive i will be spying for you !, 
  they care just as much as people around the world care . 
  it 's an inauguration of an american president . 
  switch melania with some other random woman and it would be trending as well . 
  i love their culture and love for their land . 
  it 's sad to see them go though all these troubles like alcoholism and poverty . 
  i 'm a bit agitated about them always complaining abour cultural appropriation but deep down i understand them . 
  they were slaughtered , humiliated , opressed and now people use their sacred symbols as fashion . 
  idk , maybe austria and germany . 
  i 'm just too familiar with them . 
  edit : i have some german family in essen and frankfurt and they 're all weird . 
  malta is so beautiful . 
  i advise you to avoid rumors in general . 
  especially try to refrain from spreading them . 
  it does no good . 
  not many people care . 
  the eff are you on about ? 
  the last article , which was posted a few days ago about her meeting the ambassador says they spoke slovenian . 
  the ambassador and his wife visited them at the trump tower and their property in florida and flown in trumps airplane . 
  she was asking how things were going back home . 
  her son also speaks fluent slovene and yes , she did visit slovenia years ago . 
  donald met her parents in bled . 
  her parents bought them a candle made in slovenia for their wedding and donald and melania wanted a candle made by the same company for their son 's christening . 
  which measured and weighted the same as barron did when he was born . 
  her accent is thick , tickest accent i have ever heard and her sentance structure makes it clear she still thinks in slovene before speaking . 
  which makes me think she speaks slovene very ofter . 
  \u017dganci is ours . 
  and croatian . 
  borovni\u010dke are just very widespread here and have been for centuries . 
  it 's our tradition , do n't think it 's a tradition in many other countries . 
  you really thought we 're the only country that loves to hike ? 
  forest coverage - we 're 3rd in europe , why would you think there 's no other country that has more forests ? 
  60 % is n't that much . 
  karst - like what ? 
  why would you think we 're the only ones that have it ? 
  we were among the first to start discovering it though and we 're probably somewhere at the top by number of caves per sq/m mushrooms grow everywhere . 
  everyone has them ? 
  it would be more appropriate to ask who does n't have them . 
  maj , junij , julij and avgust are safe months . 
  that 's why my grandma made me sleep by an [ oven ] ( http://www.peci-keramika.si/media/fotogal/slike/__v300/134/krusna-pec-z-zapeckom-pecnice-dunja-2-barva-201.jpg ) . 
  sit on cold floor and you 'll get a wolf in your ass . 
  you got ta count in disparity . 
  capitals and big cities tend to be more developed than the rest of the country in countries like this so it does n't give a good picture of how developed the rest of the country is . 
  have you been to the countryside as well or just the big cities ? 
  i have never been to ukraine so i do n't really know what it 's like over there . 
  i am so very sorry !, 
  i do n't know whether to upvote this or not but i upvoted for all the lovely years you had together . 
  interesting !, 
  that other guy has a [ museum ] ( https://www.rtvslo.si/tureavanture/novice/video-vrata-je-odprl-prvi-avtostoparski-muzej-pri-nas/338782 ) in kanal . 
  are you that hitchhiker dude from kanal ob so\u010di ? 
  wow that looks so much like a cat that was in love with me when i was little . 
  i do n't know whos cat it was but it came to our weekend house every friday when we arrived . 
  she did n't try to be petted by anyone else but me . 
  she kept wiggling around my feet and jumping on me and trying to be pet . 
  i adore cats but that cat we freaky . 
  in the morning she would wait in front of the door for me . 
  she did n't ever enter even if they were open . 
  one day she just never came and i have never seen her again :( her name was monika . 
  do you mean all animals or pets only ? 
  if pets only then : [ karst shepherd ] ( http://services.dedi.si/dediserver/res/media/image/24733/maximum/700?1286871838 ) there are other breeds of dogs that originate in present day slovenia but are considered breeds of other countries . 
  if you meant pets only , stop here .

  holy ... that 's funy . 
  i want that . 
  alpine dachsbracke as well . 
  i have one . 
  he 's so sweet but has a huge prey drive . 
  he does n't care about snacks , he does n't care about toys , all he cares about is sniffing around . 
  it looks like tyrolean hound but on shorter legs . 
  sounds like an sds voter . 
  you can keep him wherever you are . 
  poorer country ... . . switzerland mountainous ... ... hungary, 
   it 's quite small population : 173,699 ok . that 's ... quite a bit larger than our 2nd biggest city . 
  what if you do n't have enough money to pay the bill ? 
  i know we 're talking about luxembourg , but still ... 
  from what i can remember it 's chewy . 
  it 's been so long since i tried it though . 
  i do n't know if it was tripe that i did n't like or the soupy thing it was coocked in . 
  we have another dish , literally translated into ` beef stomach in sauce ' and i love that . 
  our tallest one is 89m ... yeah . 
  4th tallest building was built in 1933 . 
  no i do n't think mine uses garlic . 
  i do n't remember tasting it .
