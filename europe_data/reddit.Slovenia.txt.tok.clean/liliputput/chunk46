  that 's tripe alright !, 
  it looks like it will suck to your mouth like octopus . 
   we are a country with least gender inequality in the world . 
  still does n't mean women should be respected any less . 
  unless you want to go down that list . 
   babo v kuhno !, 
   meritocracy that . 
  i find it silly that equality statistics include statistics about how many women work/don ' t work in some fields . 
  we are different biologically , we have different interests and different strengths . 
  if men do n't find enjoymen in working with pre-school kids and women do n't find enjoyment in mining that has little to do with systemic inequality . 
   too respected please explain . 
  that kind of thinking just sounds completely wrong to me . 
  so you think we should respect them less ? 
  like what ? 
  they 're very common here . 
  [ ajdovi \u017eganci ] ( http://images.24ur.com/media/images/640x338/apr2011/60648007.jpg?ba85 ) . 
  it 's like buckwheat polenta . 
  looks disgusting but it 's so good once you get used to the taste . 
  it 's usually served with sour milk or mushroom soup . 
  just had this for lunch yesterday . 
  we have that too , but it 's [ more saucey ] ( http://www.220stopinjposevno.com/uploads/1/5/0/1/15016780/5111988.jpg?460 ) . 
  i hate it . 
  i think it 's called tripe soup in english and quite common in other countries as well . 
  looks like what we call [ pre\u017eganka ] ( http://en.londonbeginnings.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/07/best-comfort-cook-slovenian-cooking.jpg ) here . 
  cumin is a very important ingredient in ours . 
  it 's ` ha and em ' here . 
  maybe also ` ha in em ' . 
  yea to me as well . 
  that 's why i love it . 
  i love indian accent . 
  it kind of sounds like they have all sorts of speech impediments : / though some south american countries are even worse . 
  oh shoot , i forgot about these two as well . 
  scratch what i said in my op . 
  not an expert on it . 
  ~ ~ i just know what i see on tv , which is not much . 
  but from what i can see it 's horrible . 
  they ca n't go without using scb languages . 
  it 's always about serbs and bosnians and i just do n't find it funny . 
  someone else may have more knowledge on real commendy not this poop . ~ ~ ( ignore ` you know who ' ), 
   kalcete , fajhten what do these two mean ? 
  if we leave out the obvious ones like kimono , \u0161pageti ... and words with german or italian origin then knjiga ( book ) supposedly originates from chinese * k ` uen * which means ` roll book ' ( ? ) . 
  some say it originates from a norse word for ` note ' - * kenning * and some say its origin is an assyrian word * kunniku * which means ' a seal ' . 
  if it 's the only thing you get the medals in ... sure . 
  very big . 
  both summer and winter olympics . 
  people usually complain about not much diversity in showing different sports on our national tv . 
  olympics is an opportunity to learn about sports that are not well represented in your country . 
  we 've goot another one on our hands r/slovenia, 
  what ? 
  deport them where ? 
  paralel universe ? 
  [ niet - lep dan za smrt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjzryu0geog ), 
  [ verboten ] ( https://www.aktivni.si/media/cache/upload/photo/2013/06/21/natalija-verboten-tg_1_galleryimage.jpg ) was a pop singer here once upon a time . 
  yea . 
  the fuck was i thinking ? 
  i just did a literal translation . 
  sorry about that . 
  nope . 
  ours also has state funding for private schools or something similar . 
  last year constitutional court said private schools have to be funded with state money . 
  no idea . 
  stem has been pushed for around a decade now . 
  non-stem programs like humanities and economics are looked down upon . 
  our programs have different amounts of free spaces for students to apply to each year . 
  so students apply to programs they think they 'll have a highest chance of getting accepted to . 
  the biggest excess of students applying to a program is on agrft ( academy of theatre , radio , film and television ) , particulary on ` stage acting ' program . 
  usually the excess is around 1000 % . 
  they only offer 12 spaces and have a very strict entrance exam ( they still produce shitty actors though ) . 
  next in excess is dental laboratory prosthodontics ( offer 15 spaces , ~ 500 % excess ) . 
  kinesiology ( 30 ; ~ 500 % ) , physiotherapy ( 30 ; 300 % ) , sports training ( 30 ; 300 % ) , painting ( 15 ; 250 % ) , interior design ( 30 ; 250 % ) , preschool education ( 55 ; 230 % ) ... ( data for 2016 but it changes every year ) . 
  i ca n't find data which program has the highest absolute number of applied students and ca n't really be bothered to look through all of them , but you can find it [ here ] ( http://www.vpis.uni-lj.si/ ) under ` prijave 1 . \u017eelja . 
  but we do have one of the strictest laws and we were among the first , if not first ( ? ), 
  to forbid smoking in enclosed spaces . 
  they 're continuously raising prices on cigarettes and emplementing new laws . 
  wow , only now ? 
  we have a ban on smoking in enclosed spaces for ages now . 
  they even proposed a law to forbid smoking outside in front of restaurats/cafes/bars if there 's any sort of barier , like pots or parasols , around it . 
  cifra ali grb - number or coat of arms, 
  same here . 
  cifra ali grb - coat of arms or number . 
  yes , we sure can !, 
  at least 3-in-1 . 
  yes , because it 's not socially acceptable . 
  no it 's not . 
  they even cover their books and manga with paper so no one knows what they 're reading on subway . 
  or they use fake book covers . 
  if it was socially acceptable they would n't do that . 
  we could n't wear shoes in high school either . 
  a teacher could actually send you out of a classroom if he/she saw you wearing same shoes as outside . 
  gym shoes were ok . 
  idk , it does n't seem like a dramatic effecr to me . 
  it seems pretty common . 
  my girlfriend who watches some american vloggers ( no comment on that ) says she often sees kids wearing shoes on every possible furniture . 
  maybe she just watches weird family vloggers . 
   it takes the little banana anus out you mean that brown butt plug ? 
  i 'm gon na try later today . 
  edit : i gave you both an upvote . 
  i do n't know what kind of a butthurt twat would give you a downvote . 
  what the heck is going on with downvotes on this sub ? 
  krofi here .
