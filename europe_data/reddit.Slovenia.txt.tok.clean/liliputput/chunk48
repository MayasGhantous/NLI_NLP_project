  very weird , small houses , bad roads , modeled by scandinavian neighbourhoods . 
  had a bad rep at first , but eventually people like actors and artists started buying them . 
  one of our ex presidents and a few other politicians live there as well . 
  it 's definitely nothing flashy . 
  ** borut pahor ** owns 3/4 of an apartment in ljubljana [ ( somewhere on this road - cesta v mestni log ) ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/place/cesta+v+mestni+log,+1000+ljubljana/@46.0360445,14.4866511,528m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x47652d3f929afaaf:0x69de745bb05999d1!8m2!3d46.0363054!4d14.4874837 ) worth 176.000 $ , renault 4 , a few stocks and a few thousand cash .

  some other article says , pahor has around 366.600 $ worth of properties .

   but young people nowadays are starting to use sophisticated names more and more . 
  better than 3 letter dog names they 're using here ... 
   there was not a lot of diversity on the gene pool imagine micro states . 
  especially islands . 
  like malta and iceland . 
  berbers can be blonde and blue eyed as well . 
  i know what you mean though :p, 
  but the heck is lut ? 
  no , it 's not a thing in styria but it 's most probably true :p, 
  what ? 
  i have never heard of that nor anything similar . 
  i really would n't find anything interesting . 
  all my known ancestors from one of my great grandmothers side of my family are from a radius around 50km ( 75km to be safe ) from where my parents are from ( 25km from where we currently live ) , going back to around 15th century . 
  popular names back then were nikolaj , bla\u017e and joannes . 
  that 's all i know . 
  safe bet would be all my ancestors from all sides of my family are from this area as well . 
  sure , it would be fun knowing all their stories , but it 's too much of a hassle to find them out . 
  they did n't even use last names centuries ago . 
  yea , sorry , in that aspect i agree with you . 
   since i do n't want my house bombed wait what ? 
  what 's wrong with corsicans ? 
  marija is the [ most common female name here ] ( http://www.stat.si/imenarojstva/sl/firstnames ) . 
  however , a vast majority of marija 's are old . 
  it fell out of top names in the 70 's . 
  it was still # 1 name in the 60 , but in the 70 's it fell to 22nd place . 
  52nd place in the 80 's , 80th in the 90 's ( anamarija - 75th ) , 108th from 2001-2015 ( anamarija - 104th ) . 
  it was n't in top 100 in 2015 .

  tbh , he does n't strike me as stupid . 
  that does n't mean he 's right though , most of the time he 's not . 
  he has issues . 
  it 's best to not reply to him . 
  triggered !, 
  i like our flag but i would n't mind a change . 
  i would like to keep the symbols on our coat of arms though ( triglav , sea and rivers and stars of counts of celje ) . 
  there have been lots of talk about changing our flag years ago . 
  one of the ideas was to incorporate green instead of red . 
  some people are against it , i personaly do n't mind . 
  green is our national colour and it represents our country very well . 
  we have one of the lowest migration rates in europe . 
  idk what you 're on about . 
  it is the same person . 
  same as thecandle as well and who knows how many other accounts are his . 
  no doubt about it :p, 
  nope , not really . 
  but the white ones are european . 
  well according to google we have between 800-1000 spider species . 
  especially interesting are mountain [ ( example ) ] ( http://hribi.net/slike5/dscn48728193455.jpg ) and cave spiders . 
  we have quite a few endemic species . 
  most common spiders for example are [ araneus diadematus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/araneus_diadematus ) also known as garden spider or cross spider and [ argiope bruennichi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/argiope_bruennichi ) also known as wasp spider . 
  the most `` poisonous '' one is [ cheiracanthium punctorium ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cheiracanthium_punctorium ) or yellow sack spider . 
  i do n't think black widow is present here , but they have tons of them in croatia . 
  edit : link, 
   this one it 's photoshopped because is already dark outside how the heck is it dark outside in italy when there 's still day outside in slovenia ? 
  it 's their hair . 
  what the heck ? 
  they look so fake . 
  they look so british . 
  send your food safety inspector to their bakeries and you 'll never set a foot in one of them again . 
  why downgrade if you can upgrade ? 
  that 's not sane . 
   lol , yes they are . 
  just as distantly . 
  idiotic but what else can someone expect from you . 
  those are farm houses . 
  [ map of types here ] ( http://www.o-4os.ce.edus.si/gradiva/geo/naselja/tipihis.jpg ) as seen [ here ] ( http://www.o-4os.ce.edus.si/gradiva/geo/naselja/kmecka-hisa.htm ), 
  i think that 's venetian architecture . 
  someone correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  i do n't know if only [ houses with fancy windows ] ( http://static.primorske.si/foto/highres/old/a3/a33c249e-5279-4969-ae7a-fd2e0abe2c42.jpg ) count as venetian or this as well . 
  thousands is not a lot ? 
  2000 teens in france alone . 
  not a lot ? 
  if only a fraction of them attempt an attack , that 's a lot . 
  yea , every next person in a household gets less . 
  but the base is 292 for a single person . 
  though , thinking about it ... my friend who lives with his parents and is currently working part time + volounteering gets however much he makes working part time + benefits to fill in 374,48 $ . 
  or 456,39 $ , i 'm not sure . 
  both of his parents work and earn around an average . 
  how does that work ? 
  why do you get so little ? 
  of course if you live with your parents you get less if you 're up to 26 years old . 
  nothing else will reduce it . 
  if you work part time and your wage does n't reach 292 $ , you can ask for benefits up to that sum . 
  that 's a bit far stretched . 
  minimum pension is 480 $ . 
  while that 's not a lot , saving for a bottle of wine for months is comepletely unrealistic . 
  you can get cheap bottle of wines in lidl and hofer and if you live in the countryside , for free from your neighbours .
