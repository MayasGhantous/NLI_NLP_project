  no , i checked , it 's 292 $ . 
  that 's the minimum you get . 
  you can also do volounteer work and get extra . 
   welfare for unemployed people is 260 $ per month . 
  is n't it around 290 $ ? 
  and more if you volounteer . 
  are you going to the doctors for mental issues ? 
  it was a jab at his constant use of ` ethnic estonian ' if you ca n't tell . 
   * ethnic * estonians ftfy, 
   with a photographer 's eye for amazing high views of the city for ljubljana , the obvious one is from the castle but also from a terrace on [ neboti\u010dnik ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/place/neboti%c4%8dnik,+1000+ljubljana/@46.0530128,14.5033627,132m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x47652d61e9490d01:0x82b47a4bddf514a9!8m2!3d46.053164!4d14.50357 ) . 
  here they do n't speak , coz they do n't speak slovene , they just signal and when you say you wo n't donate , they keep pushing . 
  i honestly do n't know . 
  i would never want to be in a position to make that decision . 
  even in a group of 100 . 
  i 'm sorry i did n't give you a proper answer but it 's a really tough question . 
  however , i guess i 'm leaning more towards ` no ' . 
  i love those little hayracks !, 
  over here you leave a city bus at the back . 
  but on intercity buses , you 'll usually say something to the driver when leaving . 
  i did n't know that either . 
  celje or cilli in german . 
  it was the same ( still is ? ), 
  here . 
  usually on trains . 
  they handed out notes and then came back to get them those notes back and take whatever bimbo people donated . 
  it was usually some blonde old woman . 
  sometimes they also ` collect signatures ' for whatever made-up organisation . 
  they 'll give you a paper and signal you to sign it . 
  after you sign it , they will point on other signatures ( which are fake ) and 30 $ written next to it , as if someone before you donated 30 $ and try to convince you to donate them money . 
  that one is probably my favourite ever taken of ljubljana . 
   more specialisation , earlier . 
  i think early secondary school ( 12yos ) would be a great opportunity . 
  but what 12 year old knows what he/she wants to do when they 're older ? 
  i even had trouble deciding when i was 18 and changed my course after 1 year at uni . 
  art , music -  agree with that . 
  we have it same here . 
  if it was just theory , then fine . 
  i would also add p.e to the list . 
  you can keep the subjects , just do n't grade them . 
  what 's the point ? 
  some people just are n't very artistic/athletic . 
  the usual organised foreign beggars on streets . 
  in my school some teachers would send you out of a classroom if they saw you wearing shoes . 
  especially in the wet months/days when everyone else was wearing slippers . 
  stepping on a wet spot is horrible . 
  and of course entering a gym with shoes you wear outside was a big no-no . 
  a slovene paraglider landed on a mine in bosnia few years ago . 
  he survived but an outcome was n't good as you can immagine . 
  it 's really sad . 
  they 'll never be able to get rid of all of them which just hinders development of tourism . 
  so pretty !, 
  does she have a bit of an underbite or it 's just this pic ? 
  [ here 's one ] ( http://www.vreme-slo.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/vreme-celje.jpg ) of a castle and a the town bellow . 
  other than [ upper castle ] ( http://www.celje.si/sites/default/files/styles/photo_gallery/public/cards_gallery/stari_grad_4.jpg?itok=5axdufln ) and a museum and perhaps [ a lake ] ( http://www.celje.si/sites/default/files/styles/photo_gallery/public/cards/smartinsko_jezero_za_web.jpg?itok=dzjufax9 ) nearby , there 's not much to see and do . 
  the museum is quite nice though . 
  there 's a part of the museum called ` city under a city ' where you can walk on a [ roman road ] ( https://www.slovenia.info/uploads/mesta/cities-celeia-celje.jpg?1479817728713 ) . 
  [ another shot ] ( https://www.slovenia.info/uploads/mesta/cities_celje_square.jpg?1479817625824 ) of the city , this time of a train station ( in front ) and celjski dom ( on the right ) . 
  celjski dom ( celje house ) used to be called ` german house ' . 
  it was built by local germans as an answer to slovenes building [ narodni dom ] ( http://www.celeia.info/upload/fck/image/narodni_domjpg ) ( national house ) . 
  it 's probably my favourite building in slovenia . 
  no not hotels but in all elementary schools and some high schools here you need to wear slippers . 
   not another party vacation that sounds like slovenia , tbh . 
  if you said you wanted to party , i 'd discurage you to come here . 
  check out so\u010da river area . 
  there 's tons of stuff to do around there if you 're into extreme sports . 
  you do n't need any prior experience . 
  will you be able to hire a car or will you rely on public transport ? 
  i always encourage people to hire a car so that they can travel around the countryside . 
  i watched [ this thing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maosomvoj0k ) and some british guy mentions it 's weird that slovenes say ` hello ' and ` bye ' when entering and leaving a doctors waiting room . 
  apparently doing that in the uk would mean you have mental issues . 
  edit : uk , it seems like you 're the weird ones . 
  edit 2 : greet everyone you pass when hikinh . 
  here as well . 
   you do it anyway very important . 
  just slip off your shoes as soon as you come in so that they do n't have time to tell you you do n't have to . 
   take off your shoes when going indoor as you do in majority of european countries . 
  like what kind of a location ? 
  you get a variation here in slovenia you can easily travel between . 
  lakes , rivers , mountains , hills , sea ? 
  we need more info . 
  he 's not a troll . 
  he has issues . 
  i 'm not gon na say mental issues , because his problem may be of neurodevelopmental nature . 
  it does n't excuse him being an idiot though . 
  beautiful !, 
  i feel like every 4th house has a bernese here . 
  my relatives had one . 
  his name was ben . 
  they had to put hum down because he had a twisted stomach . 
   ban private schools . 
  i do n't think private schools are currently a problem as we have so little , but yea , no more . 
  i do n't think they should be funded by taxpayers money either . 
   split the primary school ( 7-15 ) from now 1 system with 2 internal variations to 2 different systems . 
  what good would that do ? 
  i 'm really interested . 
  does that division mean you have to decide on your career path after you finish elementary school already ? 
  or can you do , for example , medicine at uni even if you attend ` the art route ' ? 
  1st , assasement of everyone applying into faculty of education . 
  i mean assasement of their capability of working with kids and their ** ability to teach ** . 
  good grades are n't enough .
