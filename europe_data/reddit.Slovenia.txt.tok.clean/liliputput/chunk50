  3rd , no schools with only 2 pupils . 
  yes , we have a school only 2 pupils attend . 
  4th , less books , better books , same books for everyone . 
  5th , more practical learning . 
   farmer = seljak haha seljak is a derogatory loanword as well . 
   all those very scripted `` reality shows '' . 
  are those on vox ? 
  i remember seeing them in the past and thinking what the eff ?? 
  there 's also one with a judge or something like that . 
  it 's both a derogatory term and a farmer here . 
  what 's your word for a farmer there ? 
  farmer ? 
  nope , we definitely did n't have a local one . 
  i know it had trump on it . 
  kmetija - the farm .

  well , yes . 
   was the apprentice or the celebrity apprentice ever broadcast internationally ? 
  i think apprentice was . 
  i remember seeing it somewhere . 
   does he own properties in your area ? 
  no , but they offered him neboti\u010dnik in lj , or that is a rummor . 
  he did have a line of crystal stuff made by steklarna roga\u0161ka though . 
  i think it falls under first two points . 
  i have n't seen toy commercials on tv since i was a kid . 
  have you ?

  i better see you waving our flag !, 
  i just know that toys and anything kid-related ca n't be advertised . 
  * encouraging children to purchase products or services by exploiting their inexperience or credulity ; * encouraging children to convince their parents or others to purchase products or services ; * exploiting special trust children place in parents , teachers or other people ; * unjustifiably showing children in dangerous situations . 
  not me , but i 'm gon na watch . 
   and other wealthy and expensive places such as tokyo i thought tokyo and the whole japan was cheap when i was there .

  with a [ trailer ] ( http://www.towbarswales.co.uk/wpimages/wpa23d1f21_05_06.jpg ) or a [ van ] ( http://www.unuk-transport.com/vlacilci3_htm_files/komb1.gif ) or a company you bought it from delivers it to you . 
  when we need to fix the road that leads to our house ( it 's a plublic dead end road ) we get gravel from our local municipality for free . 
  they also leave extra for any aditional stuff that needs to be done . 
  how can you even rank a whole university when there can be huge differences in quality among faculties and programmes . 
  that 's some interesting statistics !, 
  i 'm surprised though that hawaii are bigger !, 
  i know what you were trying to imply :p it 's relative but funny when a country huge compared to us says they 're small . 
   germany is so small ok, 
  it 's ... a joke . 
  i suddenly started getting downvotes . 
  is it not noticable ? 
  or are people salty ? 
  it 's probably swedes . 
  i 'll have to write that thing down !, 
  i hope i do n't miss something . 
  so poor !, 
  iceland . 
  finland too flat , sweden too smug , norway too poor , denmark too flat . 
  we have [ one of those ] ( http://www.ir-rs.si/sl/drive_in_lekarna/ ) too !, 
  you sure do carry a lot of baggage . 
  counts of celje probably . 
  it 's why we have those 3 stars on our coat of arms . 
  because he 's interested ? 
  is being interested in something not important enough to ask about it ? 
  republika makedonija or just makedonija . 
  wow, 
  i was watching lasagna recipe on youtube . 
  lasagna pasta , canned ~ ~ tomato ~ ~ bolognese sauce , pasta , sauce , pasta , sauce , pre-grated cheese . 
  and she was so proud of herself lol . 
  why would anyone even come up with an idea of a video recipe for that ? 
  [ same here ] ( http://podbrezje.si/coppermine/albums/userpics/normal_koledniki%20-druga%20sk__1024x768.jpg ) apparently . 
  oh no , is that a blackface or just a dirty king since he brings coal lol ? 
   this has seen a revival in past few years actually !, 
  that 's good . 
  i like traditions . 
  lol , the article i was reading was probably from 2011 then . 
  nothing that i 'm aware of . 
  it 's a normal working day . 
  edit : googled it . 
  on the evening before , people bless their house with holy water and that church smoke thing and write 20 + g+m+b +11 on the front door frames . 
  not sure how common this still is . 
  maybe in some areas . 
  past traditions : the last holy bread ( poprtnik ? ), 
  was put on the table . 
  a night before was called ' a bright night ' so a light/candle had to be on in the house throughout the night . 
  in \u0160kofja loka area , children left out boots and pots outside , similar as on st. nikolaj eve , for the three kings to leave them gifts . 
  in gorenjska ( oberkrain ) they believed that chicken who got a bit of [ poprtnik ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=poprtnik&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=638&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjsj6fvva3rahxdm1akhwt-ajiq_auibigb ) on this day , will not be taken away by foxes . 
  why would someone downvote this ? 
  i see , that 's a very good question . 
  but yeah , try to find people who do n't understand english . 
  like someone french lol . 
  it 's kind of difficult to judge english since we all understand it . 
  you 'd have to ask someone who does n't understand it to get proper results . 
  obviously non-native english accents do n't sound like english . 
  that 's self explanatory . 
  out of native english dialects , 2nd one sounds the weirdest . 
  idk if he characterized it too much but it just sounds ridiculous . 
  the rest are fine , but i 'm also familiar with different english dialects so you know , i know they 're english . 
  edit : chinese one sounded more like how someone from somewhere in africa would sound . 
  japanese was quite off . 
  fancy . 
  especially when you compare it to american english . 
  3 and 6 maybe . 
  4 is plain stupid . 
   luxembourg err i do n't know i 've never been there nice bank accounts .
