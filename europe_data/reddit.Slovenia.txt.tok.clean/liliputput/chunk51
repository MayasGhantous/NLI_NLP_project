   that might be the case of your nation . 
  it 's not . 
  do n't listen to him . 
  he 's one of those people that would need a disclaimer next to his name . 
  i 'm always optimistic . 
  oh my gosh is n't that a song from american horror story - asylum ? 
  creepy . 
  yea , looks like it 's an old [ karanthanian name ] ( http://www.behindthename.com/name/gorazd/submitted ) . 
  i 'm personaly a fan of [ ** valuk ** ] ( http://www.behindthename.com/name/valuk/submitted ) . 
  that is a really badass name . 
  it really should become popular . 
  on the other extreme , i found a name \u0160\u010denedrag ... 
  i also think ** boris ** is a very manly name . 
   prad\u011bd does that mean great grandfather in czech ? 
  were you ? 
   difference : ~ ~ 3396 m ~ ~ 3446 m, 
   highest altitude : station 5 , mt fuji , japan ( 2300m ) why did n't you climb ? 
  ljubljana is quite a bit more expensive than wroclaw . 
  kotor should be quite a bit cheaper .

   a little bit too small 17 million population  small ^ small ^ small ^ small ^ small, 
  do n't bother . 
  he always thinks his opinion is truth and nothing but the truth and gets way to salty in arguments . 
   and estonian sounds as much like hungarian as slovene sounds like manx that is just pure wrong . 
  estonian and hungarian are related . 
  slovene and manx not at all . 
  to someone who does n't have contact with both hungarian and estonian they may as well sound very alike . 
  idk where he got turkish from though . 
  i 'd connect turkish and albanian . 
  what about israeli , with that chocking sound ? 
  not once did someone think i 'm russian . 
  i get everything else . 
  most of the times something germanic , probably because of ` ja ' . 
  only western part of the country has an italian accent . 
  i heard a mixture of portugese and russian a few times , some say german . 
  idk . 
  when i say slovenia , they mostly just say ` oh , sweden ' . 
  no , i 've been mistaken for everything from spanish , french , german , swedish ... 
  it 's the language that confuses them . 
  though i do n't know how they 'd mistaken it for those languages . 
   the most interesting law i 've heard of is a law in illinois , usa . 
  hairdressers have to undergo a training for recognizing victims of close relationships violence . 
  that 's an interesting idea . 
   it could be a `` south vs north '' thing . 
  i do n't think so . 
  we do n't talk about salaries here either . 
  though it 's slowly changing . 
   krystijan whoot ? 
  i know a kid named cassper . 
  yes , 2 s 's . 
  but it 's the same as \u017dan . 
  why different spelling when we already have a name that it 's pronounced the same way . 
   people have very good knowledge of ` geography ' as in where things are not in my experience . 
  we learned major/important countries of each continent , major rivers/lakes/seas / mountains etc. 
  we had to know types of soil , vegetation , climate etc. 
  of every continent . 
  geography of slovenia was the hardest , jesus christ . 
  i had it on matura . 
  you got a map of a random small section with only small rivers and streams listed and needed to know major cities/towns in vicinity , type of soil , what kind of an industry they have etc. 
  hmm weird , i guess you 're right . 
  i was under an impression it was around 40000 . 
  but i guess it was difficult to count since majority got free tickets . 
  so who knows . 
  i 'm pretty sure the killers had more . 
   the candle oh my god , is that you ? 
   dick cheney bulge i did and holy shit dick !, 
  if that 's your thing ... backpack is another way to go . 
   look down to meet the gaze of the grinning goatman standing below them . 
  ^ grinninggoatman ^ grinninggoatman ^ grinninggoatman i will never be able to look down from anything from now on ... 
  that 's alright . 
  about the pants , try none , only sandals with socks . 
  nothing more functional than that when hiking . 
  it was a joke about czechs and hiking . 
  why downvotes ? 
   when hiking please do n't . 
   jump on you back and force you to carry him until you die of exhaustion . 
  haha we have a similar one but he 'll confuse you with weird sounds , kidnap you and tickle you to death . 
  god of summer , sun , fire , sky , thunder * and lightning , god of fertility and ruler of a world 's mountain . 
  he 's a son of some god . 
  he has gold hair and gold arms and was born with horse ears . 
  he lives on jutrovo in deveta de\u017eela ( 9th land ) and rules over world 's mountain on which he has a palace with a fountain next to which stands a golden apple tree . 
  he travels the sky in his golden chariot . 
  he did 12 good deeds so he 's considered slovene heracles . 
  he has a four eyed dog and a brother named trot who help him with his heroic actions . 
  his weapons are lightning , hammer , ax , bat and/or sword . 
  his enemy tries to steal his belongings/wife/sister / herd . 
  when kresnik beats his opponent rain or golden wheat starts to fall . 
  his oppononents are three headed pegam , vouvel or ses/queen of snakes , but also vedomec who he fights over world 's mountain . 
  kresnik cheated on his wife with daughter of queen of snakes . 
  name ` kersnik ' is an appellative , his real name was a tabu . 
  once his wife found out he cheated on her , she called him by his real name and he died . 
  ** \u010cate\u017e ** ( singular ) / \u010cate\u017ei ( plural ) - appear in east and west slovene mythology . 
  they are creatures , a bit shorter than human , but they can change their height as they wish . 
  they live in the woods , mountains and swamps . 
  they look like old bearded men with horns . 
  their upper body looks human but their boddom part of the body looks like a goat . 
  they are stupid but sneaky . 
  they like to scare travelers and foresters or make weird sounds to seduce people and make them lose themselves in the wild . 
  after that they kidnap them and tickle them to death .
