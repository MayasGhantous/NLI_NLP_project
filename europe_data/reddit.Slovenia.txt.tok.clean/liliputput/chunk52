  they like to steal grapes and get drunk . 
  they are similar to old slavic leshy/le \u0161iji / lesniki , tutelary spirits of the forests but are also similar to old woodland gods such as pan , satyr and faunus . 
  ** kurent ** - god of unrestrained pleasure and hedonism [ ** zlatorog ( goldenhorn ) ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goldhorn ) - a white chamoix or alpine ibex who ruled triglav ( highest slovene mountain ) .

  edit : i have also found [ this ] ( http://www.slovenskamitologija.rs/index.html?latinica ) . 
  i guess it 's about slav mythology , but i think it 's only available in serbian . 
  ah , i see , i understand now . 
  very similar to how it is here . 
  just that it 's all under same university and faculty here . 
  university of ( name )  faculty of education  uni programmes & professional study programmes pre-school education falls under professional study program and elementary school education falls under university program . 
  students who went to vocational high schools can only apply to professional study programs and gymnasium students can apply to all . 
  sort of , mostly among teenagers . 
  scooter or [ tomos ] ( http://www.tomos.si/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/standard_04.png ) is often a present for confirmation and it 's really the only motivation they have to go to church . 
  motorcycles , i guess they are . 
  it 's often a topic in spring when they start comming out because some of them drive dangerously and they drive car drivers nuts . 
   chief hired by the school to create menus for the kids is n't that a standard in most countries ? 
  we have nutritionists that make menus . 
   there should be some system to give both sides more individual assistance in order to help them either out of the slump or keep them interested . 
  that 's easily fixable though , assuming you do n't already have this , which you probably do and you 're thinking of a better system . 
  over here we have before or after class hours for those who perform better or worse than average . 
  those who excel in certain subjects can also get support from a teacher of that subject ( eg . 
  extra things to study at home , but those are not assassed with tests ) . 
  these things are really up to schools and teachers to offer . 
  in my school you could get one to one lessons with a teacher if you asked and some classes like math , physices , slovene had before school help . 
  you can also get learning aid with a special teacher in school and additional support through social services at home . 
   if you are a good student in elementary school you really do n't need to study much at all , and so you never learn how to study , until you realise that you 'd now need the skill in which case it might be too late . 
  that unfortunately happens probably everwhere . 
  capable students falling through the system and becoming underachievers . 
   like actually learn , not just go thru the subject and expect the pupils to figure out all the `` whys '' at home . 
  that 's probably the biggest difference . 
  the rest you described is practiced to different degrees in other countries as well . 
  well yeah , but is it high school or do you attend it after you finish high school ? 
  we have ` pre-school education ' vocational schools but you can only be a kindergarden teacher assistent after finishing that . 
   4 ( preschool ) to 5,5 ( secondary school ) years do n't you have a bologna system ? 
  what 's a teachers school ? 
  you ca n't even be a kindergarden teacher here without a uni degree . 
  you do n't need a masters though . 
  depending on the year you need quite good grades to be accepted . 
  especially for pre-school education . 
  yea , i noticed haha . 
  average flat size is around 80sqm . 
  71sqm in city areas and 89sqm in rural areas . 
  around 61 % of people live in single-family detached houses , 36 % in buildings with 3 or more flats . 
  average single-family detached house size is around 96sqm ( weekend houses and vineyard cottages are counted in , so actual houses people live in are a bit bigger than that ) . 
  around 78 % are owned houses/flats . 
  [ houses in ljubljana ] ( https://www.nepremicnine.net/oglasi-prodaja/ljubljana-mesto/hisa/ ) [ flats in ljubljana ] ( https://www.nepremicnine.net/oglasi-prodaja/ljubljana-mesto/stanovanje/ ) [ houses in rural areas - ljubljana area ] ( https://www.nepremicnine.net/oglasi-prodaja/ljubljana-okolica/hisa/ ) [ houses in rural areas - savinja valley ] ( https://www.nepremicnine.net/oglasi-prodaja/bocna-hisa_6031010/ ) [ coastal area houses ] ( https://www.nepremicnine.net/oglasi-prodaja/juzna-primorska/hisa/ ) our real estate market outside of ljubljana is pretty dead . 
  so a lot of houses being sold are in dire need of renovation . 
  same here !, 
  psychology probably . 
  sociology and geography as well . 
  hmmm ... good question !, 
  i have no idea .

  edit : added gymnasium exams . 
  not unintentionally . 
  there 's a few people who learn slovene in japan . 
  of course . 
  though not everyone . 
  people here are moving out of cities not into cities like in most countries . 
  so you really get a variety of people . 
  old farms that have been in families for decades tend to be more of what you describe . 
   russia the heck ?? 
  there 's [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdi0irmstx8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=28 ) , [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doucltkj8e0 ) and [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxx8xuhw_q4 ) . 
  there 's a second christmas day ?? 
  what ? 
  26th here is independence and unity day . 
  yea , i think it 's that one . 
  i do n't think there 's any traditional dish here apart from potica . 
  in my family we eat different things every year . 
  usually something with chicken and potatoes . 
  never even heard of that . 
  i know there 's one friday in the year when some people eat fish . 
  nope . 
  can confirm . 
  i just say ` happy holidays ' because it includes all 3 . 
  well um , kind of difficult not to . 
  all my closest family lives within 30km . 
  i do n't have any close family abroad . 
  i have some extended family living in germany and switzerland which i do n't really know since they 've been living there for decades but most of the old ones have moved back to slovenia and now also live in my area . 
  the furthest known slovenian relative ( extended family ) lives around 120km away . 
  as far as we could check back ( to around 16th century ) , all of my ancestors lived in this area where i live now . 
  safe to say , people here do n't move much . 
  we had it in school . 
  not just for christmas , but on random weeks as well . 
  in elementary school it sometimes had to be handmade gifts or 2nd hand things . 
  christmas eve . 
  but apparently , by the border with italy , they celebrate on 25th . 
  mostly christmas dinner is on the 24th , we open presents on 24th and then on 25th we visit other family members and friends . 
  i think dolomites and julian alps . 
  not biased , of course not . 
  [ na bo\u017ei\u010dno no\u010d ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta3df9qa8yg ) it 's a sample song of some german song . 
  [ bela sne\u017einka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtkhblagzzi ) [ novo leto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvot_fd-9au ), 
  it refers to european values , as you said ` tolerance , chivalry and solidarity ' . 
  football in slovenia used to be way way way more popular among immigrant descent population . 
  it was considered a ` yugo ' - sport and there were n't that many slovenes in our nt , but i think more young slovenes are nowadays deciding to practice football . 
  on the other hand , i think only sabahudin kova\u010devi\u0107 is a son of immigrants in our ice hockey nt . 
  everything i 've seen of turkey i loved .
