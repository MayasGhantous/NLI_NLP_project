  you got serious attitude and education problems . 
  wow getting a bit agitated here ? 
  who said anything about you ? 
  calm your titties child . 
  eu borders are n't closed ... 
  it 's countries themselves that decide on whether they 'll close the borders or not . 
  you returned thousands of refugees to austria and other countries . 
  you invite them , you take care of them . 
  do n't shift the burden onto other countries . 
  i think it 's pretty clear . 
  because ours are n't fake . 
  whiter adult teeth are in general less healthy than yellowish teeth . 
  natural colour of enamel is yellowish , not white . 
   the quality was also not that bad . 
  what ? 
  it 's the shittiest quality you can get . 
   afaik we do n't allow the entry anymore . 
  great , tell them to come and then close the borders when you ca n't handle them anymore . 
  other countries will take care of them , right ? 
  i 'm not saying israel is n't safe , but slovenia is most definitely safer . 
  it 's like they took all the crime and multiplied it by 100 or something . 
  unless they count nagging all the time as a crime . 
  one obvious reason is a big muslim minority . 
  compared to us - you can get here on foot . 
  compared to russia - europe is more densly populated , easier to travel between places , better weather for travelling . 
  compared to china - way easier to get to europe , no reason to attack china really . 
  i checked it and it seems horrible . 
  it shows us as one of the least safe countries in europe . 
  like what the heck ? 
  even israel is safer on that map . 
  edit : but if you check under country profile we 're 4th after norway , switzerland and denmark . 
  a site that sloppy with their data is n't really good imho , no matter their popularity . 
  moldova has medium hdi the rest have high or very high hdi . 
  most have very high hdi . 
  ( school ) slippers . 
  i would be down with czechland . 
  i like it . 
  i hate the new one . 
  i will never say it . 
  we use a short version , \u010ce\u0161ka , which is fine , but the english version just sounds horrible . 
   skiing season i starting [ yippy , yippy yay ! ], 
  ( https://media.giphy.com/media/12ulfhpf05ielo/giphy.gif ), 
  others have already listed so many . 
  i have n't seen lotto yet . 
  when i was a kid playlife , killer loop and original marines were super popular . 
  i think they belong to benetton ? 
  you are right . 
  seeing an american saying ` football ' i 'd think of american football . 
  we all know what soccer is . 
  no one associates these tv shows with suburbs . 
  we watch them because they 're funny and what else are we supposed to watch ? 
  the jokes translate well because we 're all just very familiar with life in the us . 
  us is a hub for these type of shows . 
  japanese and korean dramas have n't reached our tv 's yet and south america produces soap operas . 
  whatever you watch there , we watch here . 
   that 70s show a show who has n't ? 
  homelessness has been on the rise in most european countries . 
  edit : it was also much worse 15 years ago . 
   it 's not as bad as in the post-communist east . 
  as someone from ` the post-communist east ' , i can tell you it 's much worse in france than it is here . 
  ski jumping and skiing in winter . 
  no doubt . 
  year round basketball and handball . 
  a lot of visibly homeless people . 
  people sleeping in cardboard boxes in the middle of the street . 
  people living on benches in a park in shinjuku . 
  makeshift homes under bridges . 
  things you do n't see here . 
  i especially did n't expect it this bad in japan . 
  what 's the situation like with 90 's street kids ? 
   i thought the guy was autistic in all honesty , you saying that makes me think you 're an idiot . 
  aw , i always thought it comes from ` boja ' - colour . 
  because of , you know , [ bojan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6lmh-bsaic&amp;t=110s ) . 
  i do know that and i wanted to correct him but then i google it and [ 1 ] ( https://www.rtvslo.si/tureavanture/glej-ga-sloven-c/ursa-iz-skotske-kjer-vlada-ljudem-z-nizkimi-dohodki-placa-tecaj-joge-ali-racunovodstva/364071 ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.delo.si/svet/evropa/nestabilnost-je-nekoc-izvirala-iz-irske-danes-prihaja-s-skotske.html ) and [ 3 ] ( https://www.dnevnik.si/18765 ) left me in a bit of a doubt . 
  they need lectors . 
  perfect !, 
  though i 'm now wondering if it 's * iz * or * s * \u0160kotske ... : / maybe both are correct . 
  united kingdom - zdru\u017eeno kraljestvo , it sounds weird . 
  i do n't think i have ever heard anyone say the 're going to zdru\u017eeno kraljestvo . 
  they just say england or scotland or say the places they 're going to . 
  not wales though , coz who goes to wales ? 
  homeless here means not having a permanent address or not living in proper conditions ( insecure ( fear of evicition , domestic violence issues ) or inadequate housing * ) . 
  it does n't necessarily mean not having a roof over your head . 
  some people have a room rented or are staying with relatives but are considered homeless . 
  i had a homeless coworker who was staying with a friend , had a job but statistics ran him as homeless because he did n't have his own address . 
  the number of homeless people has been going up in recent year due to the past crisis . 
  especially among younger population , women , and foreigners . 
  years ago when you thought of homeless people you thought of middle aged drunk men , foreigners , druggies or those who just decided for this lifestyle . 
  homeless women were pretty much unheard of . 
  most homeless are ` invisible ' homeless , meaning they have a roof over their head but do n't have a permanent address or do n't live in proper conditions * . 
  there are n't many * visibly * homeless in my area . 
  they do n't beg as we have an adequate support system for them . 
  there are however foreign beggars , usually organised groups . 
  in ljubljana , you 'll find some homeless people smack in the city center , on the pre\u0161ern square . 
  they usually sit on a bench by the pink church with flasks , singing or talking loudly . 
  most of the time they cause no trouble , but sometimes they 'll get into fights among themselves . 
  there 's also this woman on a wheelchair begging for coins on \u010copova street . 
  i do n't know her story but i heard a bar infront of which she begs has a room for her where she sleeps . 
  ljubljana also has an organisation for homeless called [ `` kralji ulice '' ] ( http://www.kraljiulice.org/ ) which means `` kings of the street '' . 
  they write and sell a newspaper on the streets of ljubljana with the same name .
