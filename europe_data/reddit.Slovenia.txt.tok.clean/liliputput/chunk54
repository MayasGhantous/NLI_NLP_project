  they also offer organised tours around ljubljana , led by homeless and ex-homeless people . 
  there 's also plenty of organised foreign groups of beggars in lj . 
  currently they 're dressed as clowns , selling balloons . 
  how do clowns fit into a christmas market ?? 
  i have n't heard of people sleeping in cars , though i 'm sure homeless do sleep under the stars in the summer . 
  but we do have shelters and other organisations that take care of them . 
  i have been to countries where homelessness is an issue . 
  i was especially shocked by situation in japan . 
  edit : added some more info . 
  i know , i was trying to make a joke but was too lazy to phrase it properly . 
  that 's what i was wondering ... 
  it sounds funny in slovene but a lot of names sound funny in another language . 
  edit : or ` ki ' . 
  stela and stella are used here . 
  \u017delezo = iron here as well !, 
  pronounced as ' \u017eel\u00e9zo ' . 
  forest = gozd . 
  poor ?? 
  i would befriend him/her immediately . 
  they are more common as pet names . 
  i have a cat named odin at my grandmas . 
  i always think ` how sad ' when i hear her name and wonder if it 's a common name in norway and if she was made fun of . 
  from what i can find on the internet , ronja is a pet form of veronika and roxana in russia but it was rarely used in scandinavia before ronja r\u00f6vardotter . 
  it 's also related to hebrew name ronia/ronya . 
  i work with kids a lot and some names trully make you gasp . 
  currently i 'm working with a kid named cassper . 
  yes , with two s 's . 
  he 's not even super pale . 
  zala comes from rozalija . 
  we really do n't have much slovene names unless you dig in for those old slovene names no one has ever heard of . 
  i only added valuk because i think it 's kind of a cool name and could be used today . 
  i know and i 'm confirming . 
  very common here , though mostly for 30-50 year old women . 
  it 's a super masculine name in my book lol . 
  kjetil as well . 
  maybe ronja , though ronja ( ronja r\u00f6vardotter ) is a popular childrens book here and according to our statistics office , there are 98 ronjas here . 
  du\u0161iti here . 
  stress on 1st i. du\u0161a - soul du\u0161iti - to choke, 
  oh , i 'll take your word for it . 
  kaija is a dimunitive of catherine/katarina . 
  kaja or kaia in other languages . 
  visvaldis seems to be a cognate of vsevolod , which is slavic . 
  * alja\u017e ( m ) - derived from a surname * bor ( m ) - pine tree . 
  could be a shorter version of boris * gaber ( m ) - most probably from carpinus , a tree . 
  less probably , a pet name for gabriel * iztok ( m ) - derived from old slavic word ` istok ' meaning east * gaj ( m ) - meaning grove , or from latin name gaius * svit ( m ) - dawn * brin ( m ) - juniper * gorazd ( m ) * lan ( m ) - flax * maj ( m ) - from may the month or a male version of ` maja ' * valuk ( m ) - old carantanian name meaning ` wolf ' * mojca ( f ) * zarja ( f ) - dawn * tisa ( f ) - taxus there are tons of diminutive slovene names though . 
  edit : etymology, 
  no czech can survive in the mountains . 
  you 'd lose day 1 . 
   sure , but is n't that a recient development . 
  no idea , but i do n't think so . 
  marriage is not really important here . 
  a lot of people do n't get married at all , therefore have different last names , and it 's been like this for decades . 
   and not all that common ? 
  i do n't know how common it is , but no one thinks twice about it . 
  i do n't know why changing a last name would mean inequality . 
  you have multiple options , most people do n't really care about last names . 
  my friend kept her last name when she married and added hew husbands last name a few years later . 
  she now has both . 
  how exactly ? 
  you either poor it into the water bottle or fill the palms of your hands with water and then drink it that way . 
  do you think people touch tap with their mouth or what ? 
  in primary schools and kindergartens tea without sugar is also always available in the kitchen . 
  i literally do n't know any slovene family that celebrates on the 25th . 
  i did n't even know that 's a thing . 
  but i 'm from the eastern part . 
  are you from the west ? 
  is that an italian influence ? 
   where do people usually obtain their trees ? 
  it 's a mix . 
  a lot of people have plastic trees , they also sell real trees . 
  you can also get them in pots and replant them in nature later . 
  people who own woods sometimes cut their own trees . 
  nope . 
  we have [ similar things ] ( https://www.visitljubljana.com/sl/obiskovalci/ljubljana-in-regija/informacije-za-obiskovalce/pitna-voda-in-javni-pitniki/ ) with potable water in ljubljana for people to drink from in summer months though . 
  in the offices , hospitals etc. 
  we have [ these things ] ( http://mmc.bolha.com/3/image/201505/201997/aparat-za-vodo-_57b447936bccf.jpg ) . 
  in scools you just drink directly from tap . 
  not really . 
  some schools may have a school club in which they release a ` newspaper ' thingy a few times a year maybe . 
  again , as with other extracurricular activities , it 's not a school thing here . 
  you do this activities after school . 
  putting ornaments on a tree is not really a lot of work . 
  it 's usually kids who do it . 
  and our trees are usually smaller than yours . 
  by tradition , the tree is up until `` presentation of jesus at the temple '' ( i had to google that lol ) on february 2nd . 
  of course , not everyone follows these dates . 
  especially young families now set up a tree earlier for the kids . 
  we are pretty diverse in every sense . 
  far eastern part of the country probably does n't have much in common with the western part . 
  some areas by the croatian border have some similirities with croatian regions , koro\u0161ka ( carinthia/k \u00e4rnten ) is very austrian like , karst region again , has their own custums , so does gori\u0161ka brda , coastal area and so on . 
  we 're a hilly and mountanous country with a diverse landscape , have neigbouring countries belonging to 4 different language groups and we were under a rule of many different countries/empires/whatever , so same as with dialects and accents , customs did n't travel much . 
  we celebrate on the 24th . 
  idk how it is in other families but probably similar to mine . 
  cook a special dinner , set up a christmas tree while cooking if you have n't already ( traditionally you set it up on the 24th ) , eat dinner , open presents . 
  on the 25th we visit family . 
  that 's a parody of some sorts , right ? 
  gospod ( mr ) , gospa ( mrs ) , gospodi\u010dna ( miss ) . 
  gospodi\u010dna is n't used often though . 
  we use 2nd person plural to adress politely/formaly . 
  not sure where it comes from but probably ` gospoda ' - nobility , city folk .
