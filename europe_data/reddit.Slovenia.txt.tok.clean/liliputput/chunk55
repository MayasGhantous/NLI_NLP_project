  i just ca n't wait to see her . 
  she 's a beauty . 
  i ca n't wait for raiven 's song . 
  she participated last year and [ her song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcjngytkbf8 ) was infinity times better than that crapity-crap we sent . 
  i had to dig deep to find it but i 'm not sure if it 's the most popular one . 
  top 40 does n't have a single slovene song . 
  [ nina pu\u0161lar - to mi je v\u0161e\u010d ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serniaexkzi ) . 
  someone correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  there are probably some names and last names you ca n't chose , but you can try ? 
  not really . 
  you ca n't change your name if you 're being prosecuted . 
  over here and probably in most other countries , women do n't have to change their last name . 
  you can keep yours , you can take your husbands , you can have both , you can both have both or your husband can take yours . 
  or you can both pick a whole different last name if you wish . 
  yea , i just kind of automatically connect that genre with finland , do n't know why lol . 
   the kooks , franz ferdinand , kaiser chiefs . 
  are you kidding ? 
  very . 
   the white stripes they 're american . 
  again , please refrain from commenting on my comments . 
  please refrain from commenting on my comments with usless answers . 
  lol . 
  ** kras  karst ** is probably the only one . 
   within temptation i thought they were from finland lol  venga boys hahaha, 
  those i guess . 
  edit : if you meant famous beyond our borders . 
  why would you talk to strangers ? 
  it rarely happens but if it does , agree , nod or somthing and get the hell out . 
  i think of italian alpine ski team , like dominik paris , manfred m\u00f6lgg , verena stuffer , peter fill , christof innerhofer , denise karbon ... also carolina kostner . 
   lloret del mar really ? 
  it 's a shithole . 
  i still do n't know how anyone would connect corporal punishment and standing to greet a teacher . 
  corporal punishment is a punishment for doing something bad , standing up is showing respect . 
  that is a cute one !, 
  zaseka is almost always in a shape of a pig in supermarkets . 
  you mean something like [ this ] ( http://www.mesarstvo-cadez.si/data/upload/gorenjska_zaseka_brez_glutena.png ) ? 
  we call it zaseka here . 
  it 's basically smoked or fresh minced bacon . 
  wikipedia translates it as bacon jam , but that looks very different than what we have here . 
  it 's really good on toasted rye bread with a bit of garlic rubbed on . 
  i 'm gon na pull out that [ eurostat study ] ( http://www.rightly.eu/britons-ugliest-europeans-claims-study/ ) ( ca n't find an official results page ) that says we are :p, 
   that sounds like the 50s and corporal punishment . 
  really ? 
  it 's just standing up and saying hello . 
  how do you draw a paralel with corporal punishment ? 
  in winter , wearing whatever kind of a hat our ski jumping/alpine skiing team is wearing that year . 
  and [ these shoes ] ( http://www.naprostem.si/uploads/news/picture/120554_spikecross_3_cs_black_lr_lo_52107.jpg ) . 
  the trend of this shoes has been going on for years . 
  nope . 
  just standing up when teacher enters , say good morning and then sit down . 
  [ this one as well ] ( https://roamaboutmike.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/100219_plushenko.jpg?w=620 ), 
  hahaha what the heck ? 
  at least they do n't wear women 's purses like some japanese men . 
  danish all have the same kind of backpacks . 
  italians have those 90 's invicta backpacks . 
  you can even combine # 1 and # 2 . 
  they occupy mountain huts for days , even more than a week . 
  those remote huts that are only meant for a one night stay . 
  no one here has a little man purse ? 
  what the heck is a little man purse ? 
  lol, 
  do n't forget a scarf and fancy mustache . 
  there 's no videos but we get pics of them saving ducks , other kinds of birds , finding dogs and returning them to owners ... [ 1 ] ( http://www.zurnal24.si/policisti-resili-kanjo-clanek-190063 ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/vceraj-psicka-danes-kanja.html ) [ 3 ] ( http://svet24.si/clanek/novice/slovenija/5836b277deebc/fantje-v-modrem-niso-le-strah-in-trepet ) firefighters as well . 
  we have a page that shows all the emergencies happening around the country and i always laugh when it says they 're saving a cat somewhere . 
  there should be a video of someone pulling a dog from a swollen river in bosnia ( or serbia ? ), 
  from a few years ago . 
  go read a book . 
  if you do n't know what an accent is , because obviously you have n't got a slightest idea about linguistics , it 's your problem . 
   what about it exactly ? 
  same sex marriage and adoption . 
   what was this about ? 
  was it not advertised enough ? 
  [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovenian_archives_law_referendum,_2014 ) . 
  referendums of this sort are n't advertised here . 
  there were debates about this on tv , but it 's not a topic people , especially young people are concerned about . 
  it 's not a pressing issue , or an issue at all and not something we need a referendum on . 
  it was just wasted time and money . 
  referendum was suggested by sds , the biggest fail of a party , despised by normal people . 
  it 's very very low here , mostly because we have referendums about silly stuff . 
  * law on marriage and family relations : ** 36,38 % ** . 
  majority of people do n't care enough about this issue or think it 's silly to have a referendum on it . 
  * referendum on archives : ** 11,74 % ** . 
  majority did n't even know what this shit was about . 
  * legislative referendum on family law : ** 30,31 % ** . 
  again , most people do n't care and/or find it silly that people 's rights can be voted on . 
  * parliamentary election , 2014 : ** 50,99 % ** . 
  * presidential election , 2012 : ** 47,68 % ** . 
   me speaking slovenian with an accent would mean the accent is incorrect , as in it could be better . 
  there is no correct accent in slovene as there are multiple national aceents . 
  i do n't speak with a different `` intonation '' , i speak with an accent . 
  again , accent is more than intonation . 
  seriously , instead of pointlessly blabbing incorrect things , go and read about it . 
  dear effing god . 
  one language can have multiple accents . 
  languages do n't have only intonation differences . 
  there 's tons of content about this in books and on the internet . 
  until you have some proof of a linguistics degree and a high position among linguists i 'll take the word of experts . 
  and common sense . 
   if i speak slovenian and have an accent despite perfect grammar - it is incorrect . 
  what ?
