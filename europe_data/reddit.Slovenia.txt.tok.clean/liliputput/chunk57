  i 'd put gori\u0161ka brda as the most * charming * . 
  but tnp always works . 
  it 's a thing around slovenske konjice , probably extending to \u0160entjur , \u0160marje ... 
  i do n't know if it was n't a thing before or i just did n't notice it , but i think it 's only been going on in recent years . 
  but this shit is everywhere . 
  in villages where multiple people are celebrating a round birthday , you 'll see signs saying `` round village '' and then small speed limit signs with all of their ages . 
  i think it 's horrible and needs to stop . 
  if there 's a hill-billy area in slovenia , this is it . 
   http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/slovenia judicial system - moderate risk police - low risk public services - low risk tax administration - low risk customs administration - not a significant risk public procurement - risk ( black market of services was a thing here until a few years ago ) etc. 
  how you concluded corruption is a huge problem based on that , is beyond me . 
   https://nicholascharron.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/sir_qog-1.pdf ca n't find anything on slovenia . 
   finally , opinions i have read from peoples over the internet . 
  opinions are not facts . 
  read what i wrote before . 
   ofiranje what region is that from ? 
  we do n't have it . 
  thank god , i already find this dolls and mlaj ridiculous . 
  \u0160ranga is also worth mentioning but i have no idea how it goes . 
  looks like ` koline ' we have here . 
  just that we do n't have a specific date when to do it . 
  but it 's done in the winter , obviously , because it 's cold . 
  also pigs need to be killed in the stalls by a professional with a specific gun so that they do n't suffer . 
  never heard of any poisoning . 
  there 's a dinner after , with meat from the pig , [ roasted pig liver ] ( http://www.cesnar.si/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/jetrca.jpg ) is the main dish . 
  feminists not likey . 
  that indeed is bizarre . 
  imagine hiking around and stumbling uppon 100 swedish adults jumping like frogs in a circle in the middle of a forest clearing . 
  :( that poor baby . 
  all it wants is a feast of nice juicy grass . 
  did n't it began to be a problem only when americans found out ? 
  or to be more precise when sjw charade began ? 
  when someone in a village is celebrating a birthday , usually a round one , or 18th birhday , fellow villagers will put up signs with his/her picture and a sign with however old that person is turning by the roads . 
  they will also put up a ' [ mlaj ] ( https://beta2.finance.si//pics//cache_ml/mlaj1-xx.1399574593.jpg.o.240px.jpg ) ' - usually a tall spruce trunk , at their driveway , but sometimes other things , like [ this ] ( http://www.matejzalar.si/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_20160320_164724.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://arhiv.gorenjskiglas.si/images/20131107/131109914-p_1.jpg ) as well . 
  sometimes people will steal speed limit signs for this purpose and give it to the person celebrating as a gift . 
  they also put [ this ] ( http://vesoljedaril.si/templates/trgovina/images/izdelki/1841_1.jpg ) , [ example 2 ] ( https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-amsj7xv3ke8/u0q0apexzhi/aaaaaaaabbi/ml_bujk2vco/s400/2014-04-01+10.04.32.jpg ) , kind of creepy shit on their driveway . 
  when they come to put up a ` mlaj ' , they 're accompanied by music bands or at least accordion players and there 's lots of drinking and singing involved . 
  i have never heard of this ? 
  any source ? 
  surely there are countries in our vicinity that are more corrupt than we are . 
  i would say , out of our neigbouring countries , only austria is less corrupt . 
  the thing here is that corruption is being talked about all the time . 
  all.the.time . 
  even with topics that have nothing to do with politics . 
  news about music - someone will throw in something about corruption . 
  news about sport - someone will throw in something about corruption . 
  it 's a daily topic of conversations and thrown entirely out of proportions . 
  people like to compare us to somalia . 
  media outlets , as always , have lots to do with this sentiment . 
  we 're a small country , as people like to joke , ` everyone knows everyone ' . 
  nothing stays hidden , everything comes out eventually . 
  even ` small ' instances of corruption are talked about at a round table . 
  the only problem is that insitances of corruption that happen are not being dealt properly due to poorly written laws . 
  everyone finds loops around them which results in them not being properly punished . 
  huh ? 
  what 's a protest song ? 
   because i was always there mostly for skiing and i do n't like that heathen !, 
  sure . 
  there 's been people living here for decades that do n't speak the language . 
  that . 
  with so much passion and poise . 
  but someone here once told me majority hates their anthem : / . 
  weird . 
  it 's one of my faves . 
   cash is still the standard way of paying something in europe no it 's not ? 
  unless you see germany as the whole europe . 
  italy , croatia , austria and germany are the ones i visit the most . 
  i have also been to montenegro , hungary , slovakia , czech r. , poland , the netherlands , belgium , luxembourg , france , spain , uk and greece . 
  and turkey if that counts . 
  italy and montenegro are my faves so far . 
  i do n't have a least favourite one . 
  i usually preffer countries with pretty landscape . 
  a few of the countries lack in that field , but they have other nice things to offer . 
  i really want to visit iceland and malta . 
  aldi , or hofer as it 's called here , is not a * classic * * supermarket . 
  ours has a various selection of brands . 
  the purpose of ` deposit ' for a shopping cart is not so that they do n't get stolen , but so that they are returned to the ` parking space ' or whatever that 's called . 
  why would anyone steal a shopping cart ? 
  you can also get a plastic token to insert it into the slot . 
  ~ ~ it is a grocery store . ~ ~ reading other comments , i guess it is a supermarket . 
  there is no bagger in any of the supermarkets/grocery stores here . 
  people are capable of putting stuff into bags themselves . 
  hofer and lidl are very specific stores . 
  our other grocery stores are not like that . 
  it sounds different than any ` british ' accent i heard so far and i watch a lot of british shows . 
  but i 'm not an expert , so maybe it 's just me . 
  there 's a bit of speedway and increasingly popular motocross . 
  are you sure ? 
  i think it sounds quite a bit different . 
  especially intonation . 
  he 's trying to speak a ` british ' accent but it 's very noticable he did n't grow up there . 
  everywhere . 
  we do n't have specific areas for specific incomes . 
  there 're wealthy people in ugly apartment blocs , city centers , in the countryside , wherever they prefer . 
  but then again , we do n't have much super wealthy people . 
  summer - anywhere from 15-40 \u00b0 c , but usually from 26-34 \u00b0 c. 
  we get around 20 days of temperatures over 30 \u00b0 c. 
  in hottest years even way over 30 . 
  we get tons and tons of storms . 
  you can expect a thunderstorm with lightning any day . 
  hail is common .
