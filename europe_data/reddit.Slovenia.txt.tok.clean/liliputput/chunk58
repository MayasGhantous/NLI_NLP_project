  ljubljana is the wettest capital in eu , not because it constantly drizzles but because when it rains , it pours . 
  autumn - it can be very rainy , floods happen . 
  it 's sometimes very dreary , overcast and unpleasant . 
  sunsets are usually really nice at this time of the year . 
  winter - i remember when we had -20 \u00b0 c , but nowadays it 's getting a lot warmer . 
  i think on average day temperatures are anywhere from -5 to +5 but it can get up to +15 \u00b0 c. 
  we had around 30 consecutive days of temperatures above 0 \u00b0 c 2 years ago in december/january ( or last year ? ) . 
  in the cities we get snow maybe twice a year , 3 is pushing it . 
  but when i was a kid we got a lot more . 
  spring - everything turns super green . 
  it usually rains quite a bit so floods are common . 
  you can still expect some snow but it can also be very warm . 
  all in all , weather is a mess . 
  we eat those too . 
  or with wallnuts . 
  with either sugar or fried bread crumbs on butter . 
  or buckwheet \u0161truklji with cottage cheese . 
  apparently we have over 80 types of \u0161truklji . 
  i wonder in what way they 're diffrent to ours ? 
  made from different things ? 
  i mean the name would indicate a specific type of \u0161truklji . 
  pick one . 
  surely other types of \u0161truklji are just called \u0161truklji or have other names . 
  like spaghetti bolognese is spaghetti with only one type of a sauce . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%a0truklji ) , though obviously not a reliable source , suggests zagorski \u0161truklji are different but closely related to ours . 
  zagorski \u0161truklji ai n't a thing here . 
  i mean the name clearly says so . 
  it 's a version of \u0161tuklji from zagorje . 
  i personaly have never ate them nor heard of them . 
  i did n't even know gratinated \u0161truklji exsist . 
  we have other kinds of \u0161truklji . 
   zagorski \u0161trukli no idea what that is . 
  it 's not something we have here . 
   okay , povitica is slovenian and only slovenian finaly . 
   dipped in chocolate are you now claiming chocolate as well ? 
  he explored the origins of potica . 
  did you read the book or how do you know ? 
  there are ways to connect with croatian ethnologists other than going there . 
  if they had any proof of potica originating there , he 'd probably go there . 
  from what i can find about potica on the internet , it 's inspirations are some italian and austrian types of bread . 
  which means it was n't brough here but it developed over time . 
  i tried to find any info of first mention of povitica in croatia and could n't find it . 
  in fact , i ca n't find much about it anyway . 
   if there was proof , it would 've already gotten a geographical indication of origin label . 
  that 's not how it goes . 
  many national dishes around europe do n't have a label yet . 
  probably from biscotti . 
  how can it be native there when it 's native to nw * part pf slovenia ? 
  there absolutely is proof , dr. janez bogataj has done an extensive reasearch about potica and its origings . 
  no one said you 're claiming \u010devap\u010di\u010di and burek , i said it would be the same thing if we did . 
  food brought to a country from a different country is not native even if it 's widely used . 
  if potica is croatian , the whole ah empire could claim eachothers food . 
  it does n't go like that . 
  but it 's not . 
  that 's like slovenes saying \u010devap\u010di\u010di and burek are slovene because they 're so common . 
  yea it 's called povitica there because potica used to be called povitica here and still is in some villages . 
  belokranjska povitica for example , which is a similar thing to something uskoki brought here from croatia , is a very different dish to potica . 
  it 's more like burek . 
  [ it is ] ( http://www.domacedomace.si/blog/kratka-zgodovina-potice-na-slovenskem/ ) . 
  even the name suggests it . 
  poviti = to wrap . 
  i have no idea what would make you think it comes from any sort of a polish thing . 
  it 's just stupid . 
  no , i 'm pretty sure potica is exclusively slovene . 
  i do , on this sub and r/europe . 
  our posts and comments often get downvoted for no apparant reason . 
  and our posts get nowhere near as many upvotes as posts about other countries , even very similar posts . 
  coz they stole it from us :p, 
  i could eat it every day . 
  my mom also makes [ potratna potica ] ( http://www.pekarna-strnad.si/fileadmin/izdelki/potice/potratna.jpg ) . 
  very delicious and moist . 
  they 're called lin\u0161ki pi\u0161koti here , so judging by the name they originate in linz . 
  very common . 
  it 's very hard to get rid of a regional accent . 
  sometimes news have to add subtitles for very thick accents/dialects . 
  of course newscasters speak literal slovene , but some still have a noticable accent . 
  both accents and dialects are seen as a positive or at least a very normal thing here so there is no demand of getting rid of them . 
  as long as you do n't come in directly from digging up potatoes or cleaning a barn , i think you should be fine . 
  you can also get chanterelle mushrooms here sometimes . 
  not always , in season . 
  yea , i have seen that . 
  they added this after a ` fancy ' renovation . 
  considering this pizzeria/restaurant is in the middle of a very very [ ruaral area ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/@46.3002727,15.5024495,3a,75y,291.03h,88.72t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sp0smodbd34qto-pdos8rtq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) , this is just silly . 
  the owners , or managers at least , of this place , are a gay couple that organises very fancy weddings , so , you know , got ta be fully fancy . 
  i think he meant public toilets . 
  \u0160tajerska or [ pohorska bunka ] ( http://www.slovenia.info/en/recepti/pohorska-bunka.htm?recepti=9152&amp;lng=2&amp;redirected=1 ) ( pohorje is a massif in styria ) is a smoked , dried meat . 
  that is a specific topping as well . 
  no , no it should n't . 
  that 's just silly and makes no sense . 
  majority of languages have accents . 
   domino 's , pizza hut ew , do n't you have normal pizzerias ? 
  idk , i think every pizzeria has their own toppings for pizzas that are n't standard . 
  classic pizza is ham , cheese , pelati and shrooms . 
  sunny side up egg extra topping is very popular . 
  i guess a topping specific to slovenia would be [ savinjski \u017eelodec ] ( http://www.slovenia.info/en/dozivetja-nakmetijah/zgornjesavinjski-%c5%beelodec-pri-s.htm?dozivetja_nakmetijah=7391&amp;lng=2&amp;redirected=1 ) [ this ] ( http://www.penzion-kracun.si/en/food/restaurant-viola/#lightbox/1/ ) is a menu of a pizzeria very popular in my area . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.osmica.si/ponudba/pizza/ ) is a menu from one of the pizzerias in ljubljana . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.socakobarid.com/en/pizzeria-kobarid/ ) and [ this ] ( http://www.pizzeria-rustika.si/en/our-offer/pizza/ ) are menus of pizzerias in a town close to italian border . 
  yea , that \u0160entjur . 
  i fully agree with you both on mb and lj . 
  mb is annoying , they 've gotten ` dialect power ' in recent years .
