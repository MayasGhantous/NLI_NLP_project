  especially with filip flisar and klemen kosi . 
  they think they 're funny ... lj dialect of young people is horrible with all the loan words and street lingo . 
  thankfully i only know normal lj people , with normal accent/dialect . 
  i do n't mind ljubljana accent at all . 
  i do n't like mb accent . 
  ick !, 
  slovenske konjice , \u0160entjur and area in between sounds ` hill-billysh ' . 
  primorska accent is the best one . 
  i think accent is just part of a dialect . 
  accent is intonation , the way you pronounce words , dialect is different words for same thing , different endings to words etc. 
  that 's called an accent . 
  no , i mean * accents * . 
  accent is part of a dialect . 
  when i speak literal slovene i have a different accent than someone from a different part of the country . 
  accent reffers to phonetics and phonology of speech ( sounds , pronounciation , ... ) , dialect is an entire system . 
  in the us , for example sounthern accent is an * accent * not a dialect . 
  there 's also [ natura 2000 ] ( http://www.natura2000.si/index.php?id=45&amp;l=1 ) protected areas . 
  same language can have multiple accents . 
  google says it 's been present since 1995 and they have around 100 members , 30 of whom are active . 
  but what 's the difference with any other poster , let 's say a living room poster ? 
  no , and i personaly think it 's silly the way us worships them . 
  pizza of course . 
  tons of food that 's so common we do n't consider it foreign anymore . 
  yep , it means the same here . 
  my favourite is [ this ] ( http://www.gorenjka.si/en/category/rice-chocolates/ ) bali rice chocolate ( i did not know it 's called mamm in english ) . 
  i recommend it if you can get it somewhere . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.mojacokolada.si/ ) a store with mostly slovene boutique chocolates . 
  idk if they 're any good . 
  i hear berryshka is good . 
  where do they steal it from ? 
  we once bought a whole suitcase of cheap knives , spoons , steak knives etc for 15 $ , it was new . 
  they said that we 'd pay more than 200 $ if we bought the same thing in the store . 
  of course we knew it was cheap stuff . 
  the funny thing is , they came in a car wit hungarian licence plates but they communicated in one of the scb languages . 
  do they give out cards saying they 're deaf and they 're collecting money for their association ? 
  we have plenty of non-slovene gypsies doing the same thing here . 
  ours are too lazy . 
  they give out cards saying they 're deaf or somethig similar , they demand a signature and then money . 
  or they just kneel infront of the store begging , some pretend they have no legs . 
  there has been plenty of talk about this things in recent years because most of them belong to arganised groups and all the money they get from people is taken away by the leader of their group . 
  there are also cars with hungarian licence plates ( they may not be hungarian gypsies ) driving around the countryside selling stuff . 
  like pillows , knives , drills etc. 
  they usually target old people because old people are naive . 
  * every now and then we get stuff in news about few of them being expelled from the country for aggressive begging . 
  i was interested more about why is the government doing nothing about the problem . 
  what about race dogs like galgos , lurchers , podencos and greyhounds ? 
  is there anything being done about them ? 
  we have a few associations that bring them here from spain and ireland and i was shocked reading stories about them . 
  i love graz . 
  i tell everyone to visit it . 
  basic treatment is included yes . 
  although you have to pay for white fillings , amalgam fillings are free . 
  white fillings are free for visible teeth in front . 
  edit : braces and cleaning for minors are free . 
  latvia ai n't good at all . 
  they 're 35th on fiba world ranking .

   the serbian government and the romanian government neither of them are in schengen . 
  they only need to protect their border . 
  hungary has to protect others as well . 
   not only that , but it is n't individuals , like me and you . 
  it was several eu leaders . 
  from merkel to luxembourg 's fm . 
  until there 's a law prohibiting fences , they 're individual opinions . 
   let 's be honest and realize that orban is a populist . 
  he 's a rusophile and has a bad influence on hungary . 
  neither mine nor your opion metters . 
  it 's on hungarians to decide who 's ` best ' for their country . 
  there is no law against any fences . 
  what some individuals think does n't metter . 
  every country has the right to protect their borders . 
  and schengen countries have a duty to protect other countries . 
  is there a reason why you keep mentioning western europe and not eastern europe ? 
  24th is still a working day here , so we set up a christmas tree in the afternoon , make dinner , eat a lot , watch tv and open presents . 
  we do n't do anything special on christmas day excpet for visiting family . 
  i have never heard of christmas wheat and none of the holy evenings and i was raised catholic . 
  not very active though . 
  wow , now it 's clear you have some major issues . 
  you have problems . 
  serious problems . 
  so you think the only buildings we have are dwellings ? 
  you 're embarassing yourself . 
  we also have dunaj ( vienna ) , majland ( mailand is german for milano ) , bene\u010dija ( veneto ) . 
  that was n't the question . 
  i wonder why not haha, 
  i know pretty damn well , i do n't need to google definitions . 
  either you did n't read the title , or you do n't know what a dwelling is . 
  uh , no ? 
  majority ? 
  why would majority buildings be communist buildings ? 
  world did n't start after ww1 .
