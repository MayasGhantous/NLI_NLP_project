  they are ugly , but they do n't take ugliness away from some of our cities : /, 
   and the entire post soviet/communist block i 'm sorry , but we 're definitely not ugly . 
  : / jesenice looks terrible driving by on a highway . 
  hello ? 
  that is right , yes . 
  we take top 5 , so the 6th most beautiful would be hmmm ... hard to choose . 
  i like italian dolomites , the rest of italy is very nice as well . 
  so # 6 is probably italy . 
  # 7 iceland and montenegro . 
  # 8 scotland maybe ? 
  hard to choose . 
  unless she was super old , very doubtful she was slovenian . 
  it 's a rare old women 's name .

  marriage and cohabitation union are pretty much equal here . 
  1,14 $ for 1,5 l. 
  people still go on holidays beside owning a ` weekend house ' . 
  these places are mosty used as weekend getaways here . 
  very common . 
  it 's either somewhere in the countryside , often with a vineyard or an apartment/caravan/house on the croatian or slovenian coast . 
  in my area , even people who already live in the countryside often also have a vineyard cottage . 
  most of the time these places are fully livable . 
  a large fraction of houses in a settlement where we have a weekend house are weekend houses . 
  nop . 
  nothing official . 
  [ ljubljana ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_3415521735&amp;feature=iv&amp;src_vid=kjz0bqqlhco&amp;v=06wz3pce-ae ) has one .

  [ lego figure of hamlet maybe ? ], 
  it 's bad because it 's ruining orangutan and other animal 's habitats .

  raise your hand if you do . 
  italian anthem is 2nd best after russian one . 
  how much does rent cost ? 
  over here it 's 27 $ a year for a single grave , 96 $ for a quadruple grave , 24 $ for a cremation grave , etc. 
  there is n't . 
  cremetion is ... popular i guess . 
  i do n't know any numbers , but there 's no taboo ar anything about creamation nor a casket . 
  i do n't think i have ever been to a casket burial though . 
  but it still happens . 
  this is what cemetery 's look like : [ 1 ] ( http://kraji.eu/pictures/korosko_savinjska/slovenske_konjice_z_okolico/slovenske_konjice/cerkev_sv_ane/dsc_8065_slovenske_konjice_cerkev_sv_ane_big.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.smlednik.si/e_files/content/pokopali%c5%a1%c4%8de.jpg ) , [ 3 ] ( http://360-zale.si21.com/pokopalisca/prezganje/01_prezganje.html ) , [ 4 ] ( https://img.rtvslo.si/_up/drown/photos/2013/12/11/110191_47658_zale2_show_main.jpg ) , [ 5 ] ( https://img.rtvslo.si/_up/upload/2011/10/28/64831421_pokopalisce2.jpg ) . 
  how often they visit them really depends on people . 
  some every week , some once a year ... we celebrate day of the dead on november 1st so around that day most people bring [ ikebanas ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=ikebana&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=638&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjcgpfj-a3qahwg7rqkhy2vaksq_auibigb#tbm=isch&amp;q=ikebana+za+1.+november&amp;imgrc=_ ) and grave candles . 
  usually also on the deceased birthday , death anniversary , wedding anniversary , you know , days like that . 
  in spring people usually plant new flowers and clean the graves . 
  impression does n't equal class though . 
  i do n't know about serbia , but there 's no class here . 
  but that 's not what op is talking about . 
  of course people are more impressed with more succesfull people . 
  not here ? 
  no one gives a shit what your profession is . 
  we 're all equal . 
  no one is expected to act differently because they earn a bit more money . 
  i think i should seek refuge in finland . 
  family gatherings here are usually quite sociable with dancing and lots of catching up . 
  i just do n't fit . 
  i only have money in my wallet after visiting my grandma , my parents or my aunt . 
  currently i only have some coins . 
  it 's janez novak here . 
  pro-choice of course .

   [ donald ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgosrctwpiu ), 
  janez for male and perhaps mojca or ur\u0161a for female . 
   one of the but nice try , bimbo . 
  what ? 
  [ @_o ] ( http://www.ubeadquitous.com/5/whatever-gif-tumblr-13.gif ), 
  no , it 's 46,6 km . 
  * we have the oldest vine in the world . 
  * despite occupying less than 0,004 % of the world 's surface , we are home to 1 % of of all known living species and 2 % of known living continental species . 
  * we have the highest cliff on the adriatic sea . 
  * karst was named after slovene kras . 
  we have more than 10000 registered caves and around the same number of unregistered caves . 
  * slovene is one of the most archaic languages in europe and in general and one of the most diverse in terms of dialects . 
  * we have tons of world class extreme athletes . 
  reinhold messner , the worlds best climber once said that `` the slovenians are the very best climbers in the world '' . 
  edit : beekeeping and honey making is very important here and has a long tradition . 
  we have 46km of coast . 
  swimming lessons are mandatory in school . 
  we were n't ussr , but have a fair share of similar buildings . 
  never heard of khrushchyovka , i did n't even know these buildings have names . 
  ours look a bit different though , judging by google pics . 
  tons of people still live in them . 
  they 're good quality , nothing wrong with them . 
  majority of them have been renovated or are being renovated . 
  there 's young people , old people , poor people , rich people living in them . 
  they certainly do n't have a bad * rep as it seems is the case in some other countries , except that they 're quite ugly . 
  it 's just another type of a building you can live in . 
  the neighbourhoods are n't depressing at all , as someone wrote . 
  there 's tons of old names not in use anymore . 
  on a list of most popular names of all times ... 
  female - marija , ana , maja , irena , mojca , mateja , nina , nata\u0161a , barbara , andreja . 
  ... only ana is in top 10 today . 
  maja and nina are a little bit less popular but still in use . 
  marko , andrej , peter , mojca , mateja , nata\u0161a , barbara , andreja were popular 2 , 3 , 4 decades ago . 
  marko has been changed to mark , that name is on a top 10 list . 
  edit : i missread the question .
