  you are right . 
  that would be a tiny car . 
  why would it be weird to have winter tires on all the time in a country where snow can be expected any day in the winter ? 
  that sign means obligatory snow chains . 
  nothing . 
  we 're lonely . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.slovenia.si/slovenia/state/slovenia-in-the-world/ ) a list . 
   you wo n't be able to buy the slovenian highway sticker in hungary they are sold at every mol petrol station . 
  make sure your car is not higher than 1,3 m on the front axis * . 
  if it is , you need to inform them when buying a slovene [ vignette ] ( https://www.dars.si/dokumenti/3_vinjete/new%20vignette%20classes.jpg ) , because you need a different vignette in that case . 
  if you have a normal car , no need to worry . 
  edit : after buying it , check if it was punched on the correct date . 
  then stick it on your windscreen as per instructions on the sticker ( left upper corner of the windscreen ) . 
  it 's not valid if it 's not stuck on your windscreen . 
  save the receipt just in case . 
  you need to have your lights turned on 24/7 . 
  speed limit in built up areas is 50km/h . 
  90km/h in non built up areas , 110km/h ( someone correct me if it 's 100 . 
  amzs says 110 , other sites say 100 ) on dual carriageways and 130km/h on motorways . 
  there are signs on every border crossing . 
  in multiple languages . 
  smaller , bigger signs , even a few km before reaching a border . 
  [ example 1 ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/@45.919305,13.6214715,3a,37.5y,132.75h,93.95t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s_cgvcjrcs_5nyp0z5dyncw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=sl ) , [ example 2 ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/@46.5969838,16.4614336,3a,37.5y,229.33h,84.88t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sjryg0mjhxq9wcr_spl6d2g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1?hl=sl ) . 
  this excuse is getting old . 
  people just are n't looking at the signs nor informing themselves before driving to another country .

  i just know that there was a pagan shrine to \u017diva , goddess of life and fertility , on bled island before they built a church there . 
  i also read hitler and himmler wanted to build a shrine to odin to eradicate christianity . 
  they also wanted to build a bridge to the island . 
  probably [ this ] ( http://www.lolzhumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/funny_pictures_going-to-grandparents-house_11270.jpeg ) minus money , of course . 
  anna veith * :p,

  no , ferragosto is just a few days holiday around assumption of mary on august 15th . 
  it has stretched to a whole month now . 
  it 's also a thing in northern areas of italy where it 's not as hot as in the south . 
  you were talking about ferragosto which has nothing to do with heat and humidity . 
  and yes , i know weather gets crazy there in august . 
  some people may not mind though . 
  i know what ferragosto is , i 'm slovene . 
  all of europe is crowded in august . 
  yea , the heat could be a problem but it can get very hot in most other countries as well . 
   into history , culture , art . 
  i would go with rome . 
  interesting !, 
  did not know . 
  hahahaha . 
  i can just immagine candle aka . 
  kontaktnicenter doing that thinking everyone understands him . 
  counts of celje/cilli , probably . 
  they were one of the most powerful families in the region and had an agreement with the habsburgs that those who live longer inherit everything from the other family . 
  unfortunately ulrich ii was asassinated in belgrade by l\u00e1szl\u00f3 hunyadi . 
  he was a last male of the family so counts of celje died out . 
  all of their property and estates were * then given to the habsburgs who then gained a lot of power and ruled over slovenian lands . 
  the course of history could have been different without that hungarian blood thirsty bimbo . 
  barbara of celje is a direct ancestor of modern european royal families . 
  it 's a pretty divided opinion .
