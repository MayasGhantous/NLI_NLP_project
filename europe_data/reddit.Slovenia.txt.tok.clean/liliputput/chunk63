  i do n't think many people ` hate ' it but rather see it as something that should n't have happened . 
  there 's also quite a few of yugo-nostalgics . 
  what about [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fosmeo_osxq ) ? 
  this is my all time favourite eurovision song , it 's the only one i remember beside abba . 
  and the girl is very pretty . 
  is she still active ? 
  no , no and no . 
  absolutely no . 
  is n't it weird in polish ? 
  sounds so harsh . 
  duda means dummy/pacifier here . 
  just a very weird name altogether . 
  no , but supermarkets have been pushing it for years . 
  and there are some halloween themed parties . 
  i think no one comes close to [ maja keuc ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuxwad3g7zi ) . 
  we have very very very very very very few beautiful famous women . 
  that 's her name ? 
  haha . 
  got ta learn that slovalenian !, 
  i always say , it matters not where you were born in , but a culture you were raised in . 
  that does n't mean you have to be assimilated to be accepted , but respecting a nation , its laws and customs while of course , acknowledging your/your parents/grandparents home nation if you will . 
  we have tons of 2nd , even 3rd generations here who do n't consider themselves slovene , so i do n't see a reason for us to consider them that either . 
  but we also have plenty who do , and to me they 're no different than other slovenes . 
  eh , angel , chill , it was a joke . 
  i 'm pretty sure everyone , even those who have n't been to greece , know corfu . 
  now it 's you who 's a dick . 
  uh , we are somewhere at the top of the list for out of wedlock children , nearly 60 % in 2014 , and a vast majority of women here work full time once kids turn a year old . 
  i do n't know a single stay at home mom . 
  unlike in the netherlands where it 's normal for women with kids to only be employed part-time . 
  it 's definitiely not a ` central-east european ' thing . 
  neither is a wage a gap .

  edit : link problems , ca n't put them into text . 
  those that do n't speak slovene do n't usually consider them slovenes anyway so there is no reason for us to consider them slovene either . 
  those that do , speak normal slovene and there 's plenty of them . 
  urgh , i do n't think so . 
  acting like you 're part of us is what 's important . 
  i know plenty of 2nd and 3rd generations who you 'd never know that their ancestors are n't from here . 
  heck , i even have them in my family . 
  and they 're as slovene as they get . 
  if someone told them they 're not slovene because their dad/grandfather was n't born here , even though he lived here since he was 5 , would piss me off . 
   the social norms regarding family life and working woman must further liberalise if countries like germany , italy and basically all central-east europe wish to achieve sustainable birthrates . 
  what do you mean with that ? 
  i 've been to one . 
  and only . 
  edit : and several croatian ones , a few in greece , a few in italy and a few in japan . 
   the first two are in greece btw no one knew that . 
  my favourite one . 
  lucky . 
  we have name days . 
  they 're not at all celebrated . 
  st. stefan , st. martin , st. valentine are the most known ones . 
  the rest not really . 
  in my family , i 'm the only one that gets some attention , i always get money from my grandma , which is fine with me . 
  the old tradition says that name day has to come after you birthday on the same year . 
  obviously no one gives that tradition much attention . 
  lol he did n't even notice :p, 
  over here it 's `` you better ask someone sober to drive you because there 's cops everywhere '' day . 
  not really . 
  depends on what part of croatia he 's from . 
  yes , it 's big here . 
  it 's the day when must turns into wine . 
  traditional dish is roasted goose , red cabbage and ` mlinci ' . 
  slovene istria has a different traditional dish , but do n't know what it is . 
  they dring refosco . 
  it 's also the day when they introduce a new ` wine queen ' and in maribor they christen new wine . 
  [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pkzau7fxaa ) lanterns here are made on st. gregory 's day on march 12th . 
  it 's the day when birds get married , aka slovene valentines day . 
  he asked for religious songs sang in church . 
  interesting . 
  it 's the same here in elementary school . 
  you 're with same classmates throughout your schooling on that school . 
  exceptions are smaller village elementary ` branch schools ' that only offer lower classes of elementary schooling . 
  often time kids of different ages and different grades will be in the same class but of course , following programmes appropriate for their age . 
  then once they reach certain grade ( i think 4th or 5th ) they 'll start going to a bigger school ( home school of their branch school ) in a bigger village/town . 
  once you 're done with elementary school , you pick a high school based on how good/bad your grades were and based on what you 'd like to do after high school . 
  high schools are only in bigger towns/cities . 
  so you get completely new classmates . 
  gymnasiums emphasize academical learning , so it 's for students with better grades . 
  though we also have sport , economic , technical , art and classic gymnasiums which emphasize academical learning in their respective fields . 
  vocational schools emphasize learning a profession but some of them still emphasize academical learning quite a bit . 
  you need quite good grades to get accepted into few of them . 
  3 year vocational schools are usually for those with lower grades . 
  they offer very basic professional learning , hairdressers for example . 
  you 're with same classmates all 3 or 4 years of high school as well . 
  since high school system is already seperated into schools by different abilities , classes are n't aditionaly divided by abilities . 
  completely different than here . 
  kindergarten : 11months - 5/6 years old elementary school - 5/6 years old - 14/15 year old high school - 14/15 year old - 17/18/19 year old . 
  elementary and high school are mandatory here . 
  what do you mean by ` segregate ' and ` community ' ? 
  do kids have same classmates throughout their primary and secondary schooling ? 
  do all the villages have high schools ? 
  i see . 
  i had to google grammar and comprehensive school differences . 
  i think different systems and schools we have around europe do n't translate well into english . 
  so this thread is a bit confusing . 
  what we have here are ` gymnasiums ' , ' 4 year vocational schools ' and ' 3 year vocational schools ' . 
  i do n't think i 'd be able to keep a straight face . 
  they 're doing it with the power of god . 
  [ girl on the left ] ( https://youtu.be/7na9qb28zs8?t=78 ) knows it .
