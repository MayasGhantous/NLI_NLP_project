  [ slovenija moja de\u017eela ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlukmcj_xxw ) - `` my country , these are her beauties . 
  my country , we are her people . 
  the beauty of the land is her reputation , her people are her name . 
  proud name . '', 
  this song was written in the 80 's and was meant as a tourism add but apparently people responded with emotions and drive for independence . 
  [ slovenskega naroda sin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkyt8adgtgu ) - it 's about a man who lived in the mountains and when he left to go abroad , mother gave him a red flower ( probably red carnation ) and father gave him rosemary and said : wherever you go , remember you 're only the slovenian nation 's * son . 
  and then it talks about difficulties and sadness being away from home . 
  [ zelena de\u017eela ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9mlmqtbmug ) - it talks about green land , this is where love is , this is home . 
  [ ko so lipe cvetele ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knepwinaqte ) - it 's about youth and dating . 
  chorus translation : `` when linden trees were blossoming and it was a beautiful may , we went for a walk in the grove * . 
  when linden trees were blossoming and it was a beatiful may , on a bench , i promissed you paradise . '', 
  [ v dolini tihi ] ( https://youtu.be/giot4noabl0?t=45 ) - it talks about a sad girl whose boyfriend left her , she 's leaning on a window sill in an evening twilight , in a small village , in a quiet valley . 
  and of course , [ golica ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7gfnagyes8 ) - translation : taratataaaaa-taratata , tara . 
  tarararata tarararata tarararata ta , tarararata tarararata tarararata ta . 
  tarararata tarata ratata ta ... 
  because i do n't want to get killed ? 
  or fined . 
  it just seems wrong to me . 
  i do n't see many people jaywalking at a red light anyway . 
  i do n't remember the last time i saw one . 
  you will see some people jaywalking on smaller streets with not much traffic and no traffic lights though . 
  which annoys me because there 's usually a zebra 50m down the road . 
  i do n't think we have anything like that . 
  we only say '' \u010din '' or `` na zdravje '' , but someone who 's a more avid drinker than me may correct me . 
  we do have a song though that is sang at different celebrations . 
  rough translation : as many as there are ( wine ) drops , as many years god give us to live . 
  hey , o hey , o hey our world ( ? ) . 
  whether she 's old or whether she 's young , every girl likes a boy . 
  hey , o hey , o hey our world . 
  one who frowns is not worthy of our company . 
  hey , o hey , o hey our world . 
  rough translation : and at last , friends , let 's raise our glasses . 
  we became brothers ( friends ) because we think good in our heart . 
  long live everyone who 's good . 
  it 's a last stanza from a toast , same toast our anthem is from . 
  anyway , neither of these are really usable in your case . 
  did you hear me say smart people ca n't be popular or what ? 
  you 're leaving eu not the continent ... 
  hawaii ( let 's pretend it 's a country , i do n't want to say usa ) or japan if i did n't have to work . 
  we already grow olive trees ... 
  i have to say , slovenians probably were n't a bit sad about his death . 
  but really , people here believe in all sorts of shit . 
  hmmm interesting !, 
  i love bechamel . 
  imma try it !,

  i do n't know how close to the original it is though since i never had it before . 
  i die when i see people frying eggs on olive oil . 
  lard with cracklings is the only way to go . 
  i little bit of transfat wo n't kill you . 
  right ? 
  no , sorry austria , we take colorado . 
  we 're even paired with colorado based on some other map posted on another subreddit few days ago . 
  pumpkin seed oil . 
  i know it 's used in austria and slovenia , maybe a few other countries . 
  i 'm always shocked when people eat salads with olive oil instead of pumpkin seed oil . 
  olive oil on tomato and cucumber ?? 
  is n't it just toasted sandwich with ham and cheese ? 
  we have fried cheese as well . 
   leberk\u00e4se that 's a thing here as well . 
   whenever i 'm abroad , only whitebread i find is this one . 
  i have never seen that . 
   rises in this . 
  same here . 
  lol i ca n't immagine a baby named pablo . 
  filipinos are far from conservative . 
  gay and transgender are everywhere around there . 
  it 's just that church has way too much power there . 
  huh ? 
  kaj ma to z medvedi drugod po evropi ? 
  i doubt statistics like that exsist . 
  i 'm pretty old and i think we did all of these bar lessons for non-swimmers in my case . 
  i 'm not sure though . 
  spain and france are n't the only countries ... other countries have more brown bears than we do . 
  stork is common in lots of countries . 
  we even have it on our 1 cent coins . 
  brown bear is found in many countries ... 
  there are so many liams here as well . 
  kristina and nina are pretty common everywhere .

  i 'm only gon na list those that are in use . 
  the human fish i guess . 
  it is found in a few other countries but i think this is the prime location . 
  black human fish ( proteus anguinus parkelj ; parkelj = krampus ) is only found in slovenia . 
  there 's also other cave creatures that are only found here . 
  we have more than 850 endemisms . 
  we also have lots of birds , some of them pretty unique . 
  we have chamois . 
  edit : alpine ibex is something that lives only in the european alps . 
  we start swimming lessons in kindergarten ( 4-5 year old groups ) . 
  then in elementary school : 1st grade - school can organise swimming lessons ( not obligatory ) 2nd or 3rd grade - 20 hours of swimming lessons 5th grade `` school in nature - swimming '' ( 1 week school trip to the coast , croatian coast or one of the spas ) . 
  6th grade - school has to check swimming abilities of students . 
  7th - 9th grade school has to organise swimming lessons for non-swimmers . 
  occasional swimming sport days . 
  high school : school has to organise swimming lessons for non-swimmers . 
  also occasional swimming sport days . 
  but of course , not everyone in the older generation knows how to swim . 
  i guess swimming is not very popular as a past time activity , except in the summer . 
  when i was in elementary school , i knew more people that attended after school swimming than after school football . 
  well i personally do n't see any sarcasm in those answers .
