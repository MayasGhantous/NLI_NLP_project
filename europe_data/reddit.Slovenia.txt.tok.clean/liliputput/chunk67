  i 'm aware someone can have multiple hobbies/activities therefore can have different friends/cliques . 
  it 's a pretty organic thing . 
  i 'm also aware not everything in reality is the same as on tv , but when it 's such a big ` stereotype ' it 's obvious it 's based on some real thing . 
  what kind of a school did you go to ? 
  no sport events ? 
  i 'm very sure our curriculum has mandatory sport days . 
  even mandatory swimming and skiing week in elementary school . 
  we had tons of other school events and we all loved them because it either meant no school or at least less school . 
  are you saying you do n't form [ groups ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/uio27/are_american_high_school_students_really_divided/ ) and/or that there is no bullying ? 
  it 's not just 80 's movies . 
  i never watched those , i 'm not that old . 
  difference here ( in slovenia at least ) is that you 're assigned a class in 1st grade of elementary/high school and you 're with that same class , same people throughout your schooling on that school ( unless you fail ) . 
  it 's not like in the us where you 're with different people at every subject you take . 
  so your community is your class , not the whole school . 
  we do n't form groups ( jocks , cheerleaders , nerds , weirdos , emos etc ) like you do in the states . 
  perhaps that 's why we also have way less school bullying than you do . 
  your class are your friends . 
  of course you can make friends with people in other classes and grades as well . 
  most of our schools do n't have mascots . 
  my elementary school did . 
  and we do n't really do ` school spirit ' the way you do . 
  the biggest competition between schools is how well they perform in state exams and different subject competitions . 
  sports here are organised by local clubs as an after school activity . 
  same goes with music/language schools and other things such as scouts . 
  we do have school team sports but not on the same level as in the us for reasons described before . 
  speaking for my elementary and high school and other schools i know , we had plenty of school events . 
  everyone who played an instrument , sang , had a band , did any sort of a dance etc. . . could participate . 
  we had school concerts , we had bands come and play for us for certain events such as shrove tuesday , we had school plays , just many different things . 
  we have a thing called ` key exchange ' at the end of a school year in which 3rd graders ( high school ) / 8th graders ( elementary school ) compete for a key one of the current 4th/9th grade classes ( i guess they 're called seniors in the us ? ), 
  won last year . 
  so senior class that holds the key prepares various games in which juniors ( ? ), 
  compete in to win ` the key ' . 
  note : grades here are divided into classes ( example 1st grade is divided into 1a , 1b , 1c ... etc ) . 
   but do schools in your country do anything to come together and celebrate your community ? 
  what do you mean by a community ? 
  a community here is a whole city . 
  i do n't think any school can bring a whole city togeter . 
  we do have school concerts , choir concerts that anyone can attend but why would someone who does n't have anything to do with that school do that ? 
  edit : i have to add , there is a form of a competition or rather rivalry among schools ( mostly gymnasiums ) in the same city or sometimes a region . 
  they ` compete ' in which school has better performing students and better school life ( concerts , extracurricular school trips , school exchanges etc. . . ) . 
  there are 3 gymnasiums in my city , 2 of them had rivalry which one 's the best one . 
  do n't worry , estonia is a baltic state to everyone but him . 
  really ? 
  how old are your grandparents ? 
  even mine , who are around 80 did the yearly summer migration to the sea . 
  you mean , taking what 's ours that you took from us ? 
  you know styria is a region here , right ? 
  ummm a diatonic button accordion ? 
  or wine . 
  or both . 
  they usually go hand in hand . 
  same here . 
  and do n't sit on the floor or you 'll catch a wolf in your ass . 
  exactly , an industrial city does n't belong in that kind of a setting . 
  i do n't wish his kind uppon any country . 
  religion and politcs have to be seperate . 
  almost every building in [ jesenice ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/@46.4287923,14.058946,3a,75y,0.66h,96.34t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1slnosvl-8gcg5_wmjcm_fya!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  it 's such an eyesore . 
  right next to a highway as soon as you cross the border . 
  awww it 's a baby [ trbovlje chimney ] ( http://www.had.si/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/trbousk-raufnk-trboveljski-dimnik-fotografije-03.jpg ) . 
  france pre\u0161eren is a very big figure here . 
  8th february , the day he died , is a cultural holiday and a day off for everyone . 
  there are plenty of others as well whose works we study in schools . 
  but i do n't think we have a special oppinion about them . 
  no , i didi n't know he was slovene before i heard him speak . 
  he has a very very distinct accent . 
  [ the walk of peace ] ( http://www.potmiru.si/eng/ ) [ kobarid museum ] ( http://www.kobariski-muzej.si/eng/ ) i think that 's about it . 
  so\u010da valley is a great place if you 're into ww1 . 
  edit : i guess there 's a bit more : [ park of military history ] ( http://parkvojaskezgodovine.si/en/ ) [ military museum tabor ] ( http://www.vojaskimuzejtabor.eu/en/index.html ), 
  over here it 's just sweet , not minty : - /, 
   both are definitely slavic accents no shit, 
  no he does n't . 
  i knew he was slovene the moment i heard him speak . 
  ge has a heavy accent , i do n't know exactly from where , bud definitely around ljubljana or north . 
  someone from maribor would have a different accent . 
  never heard any serb or croatian with that accent . 
  i 'm pretty sure you could . 
  our languages have accents on different parts of the words , different way we say certain letters etc. 
  i could tell immidiately [ this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhz_8ofvaba ) is slovene . 
  and i think [ this woman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stxdjt-oinq ) sounds complety different . 
  but i do n't know if someone not familiar with these languages could differentiate between the accents . 
  well ... christmas season is comming . 
  not a year goes by without home alone movies on tv here . 
  english accents here differ from region to region though . 
  primorska , maribor , koro\u0161ka and some regions in gorenjska have a very distinguished accents . 
  but are your candy canes sweet or minty ? 
  i think us candy cane are actually mint , those we get here are sweet . 
  you just in general do n't know how to behave in the mountains . 
  czechs also occupy mountain huts for weeks without leaving . 
  those huts that are meant as a shelter for one night . 
  me too !, 
  was n't it about not shaving underpits ? 
  mmmm looks good !, 
  what 's that orange thingy ? 
  carrots ? 
  hoooooooo shreded turnip , mashed potatoes and blood sausages < 3 winter is comming !!, 
  some specialist have long waiting lines but my personal experience is good so far . 
  i had some ` problems ' when i was a kid . 
  nothing life threatning , nothing that bothered me in any sort of way but it was weird and never seen before so they 've done all sorts of tests on me . 
  they really went all out and i got lots of hospital days away from school coz hospital school aint real school .
