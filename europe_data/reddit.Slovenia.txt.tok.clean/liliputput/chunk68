  last year i had bells palsy . 
  i called my personal doctor who told me to come in immidiately . 
  since bells palsy can have some serious causes , i was a priority case and was took into the office immidiately . 
  she then reffered me to maxillo-facial department and they hospitalised me as soon as i got there . 
  i was in a hospital for 5 days and got all sorts of treatment including facial massage every day . 
  so good . 
  after a week i looked as if nothing happened to me even though all my initial tests were really bad . 
  i 've done some research on the internet and in some countries ( us and canada , idk about europe ) you get no treatment at all so some people are left with permanent droopy face . 
  so i really ca n't complain . 
  when i was a kid my dentist thought i was alergic amalgam dental fillings so i got white ones for free :p, 
  that 's what you get when people think they 're entitled to everything the same second they come up with an idea . 
  and when they believe in every conspiracy theory and every fairly tale story about how things are in other countries . 
  then you read the comments on reddit and it 's the same thing everywhere , except people in other countries have some reason and patience . 
  one that i know from the top of my head is an old tv series [ bojan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6lmh-bsaic ) . 
  and [ ma\u010dek muri ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cvgd4suwhy ) the rest i had to google . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.film-center.si/sl/film-v-sloveniji/filmi/po_tipu_filma/102/animirani/ ) a list of some newer ones . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vygpluwa20g ) is a first slovene animated feature film from the 1998 . 
  and [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzkx633or4i ) a history of slovene animation . 
  they 're all creepy . 
  not minorities of course . 
  immigrants . 
  my friend is a kindergarten teacher . 
  she 's seen some job listings where they count speaking albanian as a plus . 
  spring is fine , i love spring . 
  maybe : on the ` what season will be tomorrow ' side of the alps . 
  german probably in some fields . 
  albanian if you 're a teacher . 
  that 's krv\u00e1vica , not krvav\u00edca !, 
  lots of floods , lightning strikes , hailstorms , storms with high winds ( other than burja ) , torrential rain , fires , we had a tornado once , landslides , and the most epic of all the disasters was the ice storm that paralized the country for a week and ruined more than half of our forest and we now have problems with bark beetles because of it . 
  people here think austria uses those airplane thingies to get rid of hail so all the hail then ends up here . 
  hahaha . 
  jeez , people here believe every conspiracy theory someone comes up with . 
  werent those from ambrus strojans ? 
  and drnov\u0161ek moved them to some house in ljubljana ) , so they 're not in ambrus anymore . 
  [ elka is dead ] ( http://svet24.si/clanek/novice/slovenija/551e2ee125058/agencija-za-civilno-letalstvo-kmalu-samostojen-subjekt ) and apparently they get [ 13000 $ ] ( http://siol.net/novice/slovenija/druzina-strojan-naj-bi-od-drzave-mesecno-prejemala-13-tisoc-evrov-video-199418 ) a month ... 
  i think it 's considered healthier because it 's leaner . 
  but yeah , poultry , unless you buy it from a local farmer or grandma strangles a chicken for you , is fed with antibiotics . 
  but then again , so is beef and pork . 
  it 's just another type of meat here . 
  i have never seen a whole turkey , there 's only sliced turkey steaks and ground turkey . 
  and turkey breast salami . 
  i would n't say any sort of meat is more popular than other . 
  i think turkey steaks are mostly used to make schnitzels . 
  oh it did ? 
  i have n't heard about it . 
  but it was probably a lonely incident . 
  * no division into groups here . 
  there 's no popular kids , no nerds , no jocks , no bullies , no victims . 
  we 're all the same . 
  and i like it that way . 
  at least that 's how it was in my school . 
  however , i know some lower education schools have huge problems with , i do n't know how to say it nicely , some non or barely slovene speaking population of students or even non-students threatning other students . 
  * clubs are different from school to school . 
  debate clubs are very popular . 
  my school also had a photo club , history club , unesco club , english theatre club , choir , then there were those who led and participated in all the school events , i do n't know if it was a club or what . 
  there was also a vocal group of 8 guys . 
  this clubs are usually not advertised and are small , a teacher can invite you if they think you might be interested . 
  they 're usually not very set clubs either . 
  one year they exsist , another year some new club comes along . 
  * i do n't think we had that . 
  our class president had some school wide meetings . 
  i know some ( elementary , probably high schools as well ) schools , had this `` parliament '' thing where kids debated all sorts of things . 
  * prom , or ` matura ' dance is a very very big thing in year 4 of high school ( valeta at the end of elementary school ) . 
  we have dance classes throughout the year . 
  1st part is very formal , organised by school , families attend . 
  we dance quadrille , all sorts of walzes and other classical dances . 
  [ video 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emsmyccpomu ) , [ video 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj4ymmplews ) . 
  we have a dinner with our family . 
  then 2nd part is informal which means we go to clubs . 
  at the end of school year we also have a parde in the streets of the cities . 
  [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qosopu4y58w ) . 
  this thing has now spread to other countries as well , but it was invented here almost 2 decades ago . 
  edit : matura dance has a long history here . 
  it 's been going on since the 18th century , so it 's not something that we took from americans . 
  * we also have a ` matura ' trip in year 4 . 
  some are organised by schools ( travel agencies send them offers and then school and students decide which one they 'll go with and where they 'll go ) but some schools leave everything to the hands of classes . 
  most go to spain or greece . 
  malta , montenegro , tunisia ( was ) , italy and probably some others are also among choices . 
  it 's definitely more common to take a dog to the mall in austria than it is here . 
  at least in graz . 
  i find that so nice . 
  all the dogs i 've seen were well trained . 
  i think it 's forbidden here . 
  oh fuck , that looks pretty scary . 
  autumn - on the foggy side of the alps . 
  summer - on the stormy side of the alps . 
  winter - on the ` where 's the frickin ' snow ??? ', 
  side of the alps . 
  shut up !, 
  you has santa !, 
  yes , it 's ljubljana . 
  i 'm not from ljubljana , though i lived in \u0160i\u0161ka while studying , but those are the only two enighbourhoods that ever had a `` bad '' reputation so they 're the only ones i could name . 
  i like french , italian , greek , portugese , russian and icelandic . 
  i dislike albanian , turkish , spanish , romanian , danish and hungarian . 
  no offence to anyone . 
  that 's the infamous \u017dabjak . 
  it 's only one place . 
  a village , not villages . 
  no , we do n't even have any bad neighbourhoods in our cities . 
  fu\u017eine and \u0160i\u0161ka kind of had a bad reputation in the 90 's because they housed mainly bosnian , serbian and croatian immigrants/refugees who sometimes , not often , got into fights so everyone believed they 're a hotbed of crime .
