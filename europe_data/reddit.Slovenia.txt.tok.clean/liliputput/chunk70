  only then will he come out of the cave with his army and with a new weapon bring to the world new values , prosperity and peace . 
   moko\u0161 and veles and perun . 
  do n't try to steal our joke , croatia !, 
  yes . 
  we keep wine , potatoes , onion and preserves in . 
  austrians keep their women in their basements . 
  haha . 
  next time i 'm in italy imma try that . 
  and don corleone \u02c7 just to see their reaction . 
  i 'd spit in their face . 
  i 'm kidding !!!, 
  i 'd pretend i do n't understand them and continue in english . 
  i 've had mormons trying to talk to me in slovene . 
  they were pretty ok . 
  no , they do n't . 
  it 's us who try to speak croatian . 
  factories that need qualified and quality labour definitely have a better chance in europe . 
  but i do n't see big sewing factories ever comming to europe . 
   but the biggest advantage asia has over europe is the sheer amount of workforce . 
  and cheap labour at that . 
  that 's why factories are moving there . 
  not that popular here . 
  m\u00fcsli is more popular but stil not that popular . 
  [ these ] ( https://trgovina.mercator.si/market/brskaj#categories=14535589;offset=0; ) are cereals and m\u00fcsli we have here . 
  we also had fruit loops few years ago but i have n't seen them recently . 
  i tried them and do n't really understand why anyone would like them . 
  it 's pure sugar with no special taste . 
  i sometimes get grancereale m\u00fcsli and i eat nestle cini minis as a snack without milk . 
  cookie crisp is n't that bad either . 
   but hey still ( i guess ) healthier than this . 
  at least that 's actual food , not bird food . 
  are dutch open to foreigners ? 
  because all the dutch i met , in slovenia and abroad , were very eager to chat . 
  even on a rafting boat down the so\u010da river and outside toilet facilities in a camp , they kept chatting away . 
  i always wonder how people still fall for it . 
  i think tupperware was something similar years ago . 
  erm . 
  harbalife ? 
  there 's also roma people , usually with hungarian licence plates , in my area at least , going around houses selling various things from tools , knives , pillows etc. 
  they say it 's worth houndreds of $ but you only have to pay 20 , 30 , 40 etc $ . 
  haha . 
  uf , there 's lots . 
  reading old books is really weird sometimes . 
  turkey - beuatiful architeture , very nice coast , i love istanbul , will definitely return . 
  i only visited djerba and that central strip . 
  ( gabes , gafsa , tozeur , qibili , douz , medinine ... ) it was my first time in an arab speaking country , first time in a desert and i was a kid so i was impressed . 
  hotel stars do n't match hotel stars here . 
  a 3 star hotel we stayed in one night probably would n't even be alowed to operate in europe . 
  if you have a blonde female in your group , she might feel uncomfortable there . 
  egypt - it was an all inclusive resort holiday , i wish we travelled around a bit though . 
  i do n't know when it will be safe enough to return . 
  japan - i long to go back . 
  i just wish i could travel there every year . 
  china - beijing . 
  dirty , smelly , weird , people with bad manners , people impressed by white people . 
  all in all , weird . 
  but i still would return . 
  good food . 
  philippines - ok . manila is horrible . 
  huge income disparity . 
  people are weird . 
  sure , they 're smiley , but they seem sketchy . 
  a lot of guns . 
  i honestly do n't know why some people praise filipinos and philippines so much . 
  the beaches i 've been to were n't that special but i guess there are better ones in the country . 
  please go . 
  take time and visit other places as well . 
  do you not have police undercover ? 
  cameras ? 
  witnesses ? 
   regensburg viktoria rebensburg and puzzles ( i know , ravensburger ) always instantly come to my mind . 
  nuremberg is great . 
  ca n't they arrest them for scamming people ? 
  what are they selling then ? 
  and why ? 
  yea , weird hair-do and sandals with socks . 
  that 's so czech . 
  yea , they definitely have it in maribor . 
  i just bought it yesterday . 
  cherry coke and some other stuff as well . 
  we also use ` czech ' for anything of bad esthetic or poor quality . 
  or at least we used to . 
  example : that stove is so czech . 
  meaning it 's ugly and/or bad quality . 
  ah so very very beautiful and peaceful . 
  and then you move a bit and ... [ hoards of tourists ] ( https://www.google.hr/maps/@42.6418468,18.1061332,3a,75y,244.02h,84.08t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sf0gm_0bw79wksgxhxneglq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) :( are they gon na film got this year ? 
  i missed it 2 years ago . 
  hahahaha this made me giggle . 
  i love google maps on ski resorts . 
  does google maps cover any in norway ? 
  like [ this ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/@46.2430231,13.8378545,3a,75y,94.4h,78.63t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1szhyqzzeqnjcbqtaapydihq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=sl ) where you can ` ski ' on google maps . 
  i was waiting for more inspiration on what to post but i guess everyone 's already asleep . 
  we do n't have any cool buildings to offer , i do n't know if these count as cool , but this is what you get . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/place/triglav/@46.3779259,13.8386974,3a,75y,302.42h,103.8t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-zsufbtwrtsk%2fvfrzct554ti%2faaaaaaaaz54%2fluiibhojxlm0ldvyhacy8m0qbidiqcdfqclib!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh4.googleusercontent.com%2f-zsufbtwrtsk%2fvfrzct554ti%2faaaaaaaaz54%2fluiibhojxlm0ldvyhacy8m0qbidiqcdfqclib%2fw203-h101-n-k-no%2f!7i9728!8i4864!4m5!3m4!1s0x477a890cabbb95f9:0xcabdad5f5e0304c3!8m2!3d46.3791994!4d13.8339168?hl=sl ) is a path to triglav , our higest peak . 
  i think people who climb this are cool . 
  it gives me virtigo just by seeing it on google maps .

  though some danish guy told me danes think that temperatures around 13 \u00b0 c are perfect to swim in . 
   i use to love getting the meatballs . 
  just make them from scratch .
