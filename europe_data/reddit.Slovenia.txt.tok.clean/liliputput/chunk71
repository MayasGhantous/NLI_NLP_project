  you 'll never think of ikea frozen ones again . 
  we always make fresh soup noodles , but pasta very rarely . 
  weird . 
  you do n't know [ sunquick ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=sunquick&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1242&amp;bih=580&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjnxzdz2b_pahvrbsakhbg-afyq_auibigb ) ? 
  i thought it was popular all over the world . 
  it 's what we call syrup and i do n't know what it 's called in english . 
  concentrated juice ? 
  you put a bit of the syrup and mix it with lots of water to get juice , or flavoured watter , whatever . 
  i like sunquick because it 's not as sweet as other syrup . 
  i do n't really like any other kinds of meat than plain meat . 
  i do n't eat a lot of cold * cuts and sausages either except for before mentioned poli sausage every now and then . 
  i still eat it sometimes , but just not very often . 
  i added some more stuff to my original comment . 
   but you wo n't find root beer or dr peppers . 
  e.leclerc has those . 
  at least here , so i 'm sure it does in france as well . 
  nooooo the only way is with lard with cracklings . 
  * peanut butter - it 's sold but not very popular . 
  i do n't like it . 
  * jam/jelly/preserves - jam and marmelade are very popular for breakfast . 
  we do n't have jelly . 
  compote is also very popular . 
  it 's one of those things people prepare end of summer/autumn for winter months . 
  most popular home made jam/marmelade are made out of plum , apricots or peach . 
  * ready to eat meals - ew . 
  i do n't know anyone who eats this . 
  maybe students . 
  there 's a few options in the stores , like [ this ] ( http://pogrejinpojej.si/image/cache/data/piscancje_roladice_v_omaki_s_svaljki-960x526.png ) . 
  i think the only pre-made frozen thing people sometimes buy are [ cmoki/knedli ] ( http://www.pekarna-pecjak.si/sites/pecjak/files/cmoki%2cjagodni_0.png ) ( dumplings/kn \u00f6del ) and svaljki ( gnocchi ) . 
  i also sometimes buy [ \u0161truklji ] ( http://www.pekarna-pecjak.si/sites/pecjak/files/struklji%2c%20sirovi_0.png ) . 
  but these things have to be cooked , not thrown in a microwave . 
  * common breakfast items - jam , marmelade or honey with butter on bread , cold cuts and cheese on bread , [ poli salama ] ( https://trgovina.mercator.si/market/img/cache/products/5133/product_medium_image/00451698.jpg ) , various kinds of p\u00e2t\u00e9 , eggs , bell pepper , tomato , things like that . 
  * cereals - definitely not as common as in the us . 
  i sometimes eat nestle cini minis , plain corn flakes or oats . 
  also [ \u010cokolino ] ( http://cdn.podravka.net/repository/images/_variations/c/3/c3baa102ef485169ae942f31200e0f29-product_view-312723b40d9f9426445562ad749c10ea.png ) . 
  since you 're canadian and most probably a hockey fan , [ an\u017ee kopitar ] ( http://lifestyle.enaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/anze_kopitar_060712.jpg ) ate \u010cokole\u0161nik ( similar to \u010cokolino ) from stanley cup . 
  * common beverages - i buy coffee powder and tea bags . 
  that 's it . 
  sometimes i 'll buy sunquick when i want to add some flavour to tap water . 
  we have a lot of different flavours of ` concentrated juice ' ( ? ) . 
  elder is very popular . 
  we call it ` syrup ' , i 'm not sure what it 's called in english . 
  people also make elder syrup at home . 
  we also have nectar juices . 
  they were super popular when i was a kid . 
  especially peach and strawberry . 
  and we 'd put [ whipped cream ] ( https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xpf1/t51.2885-15/e15/891323_1408623962746428_1196591887_n.jpg ) on top . 
  [ fructal ] ( http://www.fructal.si/ ) is the main brand that makes them . 
  [ cockta ] ( http://www.cockta.eu/sl/ ) is a slovene version of coca cola . 
  very popular , more natural but i think sweeter than coke . 
  * common condiments - spices , mayo if i 'm making pasta salad . 
  japanese soy sauce , mirin and some other japanese things . 
  ketchup , mustard , sour cream ... usual stuff . 
  * when it comes to pasta do you buy dry pasta/canned sauce or make from scratch ? 
  - i usually buy dry pasta , sometimes fresh . 
  canned sauce i only buy tomato pasta sauce and i put tons of parmigiano-reggiano on it . 
  i make other sauce from scratch . 
  there 's nothing easier to make than pasta sauce . 
  * common alcoholic beverages ? 
  none . 
  i do n't drink . 
  i guess wine is the most common here as probably every second famiy makes its own wine ( a bit of exaggeration maybe , but a lot of families do ) . 
  beer is also popular . 
  and then various kinds of schnapps . 
  [ borovni\u010dke / blueberry ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wvpqhjphowa/udhv73xvg5i/aaaaaaaajz4/u_9ymibb_ok/s1600/img_2179.jpg ) being the most popular . 
  people also make this and other kinds at home . 
  * smoked meat is very popular . 
  i do n't eat much of it though . 
  smoked ham is a must for easter . 
  edit : added some stuff . 
  good atmosphere here means singing and chanting in unison , something that sends shivers down your spine . 
  watching a marching band and cheerleaders does n't do that to me . 
  most of our sporting events are very family oriented , with exception of [ maribor - olimpija ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-yn-lbytc8 ) derbies and football matches with a few foreign clubs known for their ultras . 
  ski jumpings finals in planica is probably the biggest yearly sporting event here . 
  [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1llrmsdpea ) and from [ another angle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdoncttlhsa ) . 
  atmosphere on national [ basketball ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2wqsezmcyg ) games is usually very nice and loud . 
  it depends on importance of the game . 
  the last few eurobasket qualification games were pretty aweful . 
  but the opposing teams were n't special enough to attract bigger crowds . 
  the crowd looked more fit for a theatre . 
  basketball fans in europe are way louder and way more passionate than those in the us which can be confirmed by everyone who played here or went to a game . 
  turkey , greece and serbia are especially known for the atmosphere . 
  [ hockey games ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlemnt6dg2e ) can be great as well , especially when they roll golica . 
  obviously we do n't have a 80.000 people stadium , that would be a waste of space . 
  american football matches look more like a carnival , very commercial , organised , show offs of indivuduals . 
  ours are more passionate and uniting . 
  what about trieste ? 
  it was on the news here last year , 2 years ago they want to seperate and become a new monaco . 
  did you watch news of all european countries to make such a conclusion or are you basing your assumptions on british media only ? 
  1/50 countries . 
   i am not really keen on seeing what goes into the leberk\u00e4se , but it is delicious still . 
  same with what you call extrawurst , but we call [ poli ] ( http://www.adna-commerc.ba/media/com_eshop/products/resized/3838977085501-500x500.jpg ) . 
  one of my relatives is a butcher , he said if people ever saw what goes in , they 'd never sell one sausage again . 
  i never make it at home . 
  when i eat a burger outside , i order the one with steak slices , letuce , onion , tomato and bbq sauce or with brie , arugula , tomato and bbq sauce . 
  that is great !, 
  bookmarked !, 
  but we do n't have those kind of bread here !, 
  we make rissoles with pan baked potatoes and buttered corn . 
  soooo very good .
