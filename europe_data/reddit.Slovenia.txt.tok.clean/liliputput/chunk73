  why have a pickup truck then ? 
  we ate that a lot too . 
  nope . 
  it 's imported . 
  we do n't have anything simiral except for ` filana paprika ' . 
  but spain and portugal are only 2 out of 50 countries in europe . 
  the rest do n't have much connections with them . 
  maybe france . 
  first thing that comes to my mind are soap operas . 
  and then music . 
  i have pretty neutral feelings about south america . 
  there 's plenty of slovenes in argentina , bariloche specifically and even 3rd generation tries to preserve slovene language and culture . 
  aparently they 're pretty influental in that part , especially in mountaneering and skiing . 
  i 've seen quite a bit of reports on them on our national tv . 
  that we were under iron curtain . 
  that ` eastern europe ' or slavic europe is one cultural , musical , culinary , etc. 
  entity . 
  that our culture is same or at least similar to serbian , bosian ... culture . 
  everyone i know thinks of baltic as a geographic position , same as iberia , apennines , balkan , scandinavia ... 
  i have never heard anyone reffer to ireland as a ` geographic feature ' . 
  they 're always talking about a country . 
  i do n't think we have anything like that here . 
  we do n't have many rich rich . 
  and those who are , are n't public anyway . 
  you ca n't get rich in entertainment industry , we 're too small . 
  why does everyone seem to have sarma looking things , even hungary , except for us ? 
  [ \u010cufti ] ( http://www.recepti-kulinarika.com/images/cufti.jpg ) with mashed potatoes or [ spinach ] ( http://bamamanjam.zemljak.si/wp-content/uploads/blogger/--68dyolhrok/uk1lmtyhsri/aaaaaaaaabs/0pfuaffz4ya/s1600/cymera_20131003_104547.jpg ) with mashed potatoes and sunny side up egg . 
  i like diversity of landscape and the landscape itself . 
  as long as it 's not on my walls and curtains !, 
  immagine a stain that shit would live on my wals when i smack it . 
   densely populated that 's a nice thing ? 
  it 's kind of nice looking . 
  but not if it 's hanging on your curtains !, 
  lots !, 
  i make sure all the windows are closed in summer if we have lights turned on in the evening . 
  mosquitoes , flies , moths , grasshoppers ( those disgusting huge ones as well !, 
  ) , spiders , daddy long leggs , wasps , those small-ish black beetles , one night i had a toad hop in through the door . 
  i once had a random cat eating my dogs food from his bowl while he was sleeping on a couch few meters away . 
  i would n't be surprised if a deer walked in one night since we leave the door open often in the summer . 
  i do n't need more photos of that shit !, 
  ya 'll need to post some warnings before posting anything centipede like !, 
  perhaps he was the i **** that banned me . 
  well ... 
  i was banned for `` scientific racism '' , whatever that may be , because i quoted a research . 
  i 'm pretty sure mods are for minorities . 
  not that i 'm not . 
  lipica . 
  akhm !, 
  we gave a lipicanec to queen elizabeth . 
  it 's clearly ours . 
  turkish airlines is one of the best airlines in the world . 
  and ataturk airport is great . 
  no , not here . 
  people just do it as an excercise . 
  it may be religious for some , but who cares . 
  not here . 
  well there 's one bbq place , kralj \u017eara ( king of bbq ) , so that 's the closest thing . 
  even if it 's not against the law , it 's againts our social norms and values . 
  it 's also a security risk . 
  on shrove tuesday/halloween masked adults are not allowed into public buildings . 
  it 's common sense . 
  imo it means fitting in without ` deviating ' far from average but still preserving your culture to some point . 
  so somewhere in the middle between full assimilation and no-intergration . 
  it means you follow the laws and social laws of the country you 're in . 
  pulling a prayer rug in the middle of a street would be a no-no . 
  wearing a niqab and a burqa is a no . 
  wearing a hijab and similar is ok . salwar kameez , dishdasha , kurta , izar ( i had to google this , so pardon if anything is wrong ) in public is a no . 
  also learning and respecting a language , history and traditions of a country is a must . 
  but you know , all of this is debatable , it 's not a legal term . 
  you 're thinking of assimilation . 
  i remember thomas the tank engine but it was creepy , did n't watch it . 
  kurba . 
  a few others i listed are american as well , i think . 
  sorry it 's a bit of a long list :p there 's more of course , but i ca n't remember them right now . 
  edit : [ magic school bus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oondf4g_hgw ) this one was probably my favourite . 
  i also had computer games .

  so many kids without helmets o_o this would qualify for an enraged public and fierce debates on our tv during prime time . 
  yea , when you 're at home . 
  what if you 're outside ? 
  you 're gon na look for public toilets to drink ? 
  or do you always carry bottles of water with you ? 
  i think you just have a fetish for sprinkling water :p, 
  so i qualify ? 
   or dance sm\u00e5 grodorna on midsummer 's eve . 
  doing ** that ** in public is a real rite of passage !, 
  i have a hard time finding normal water in austria . 
  they have a whole isle of sprinking water and a few bottles of normal water hidden in a corner . 
   complain all the time even though everything is fine check . 
   be the most patriotic person but do n't consider yourself a patriot check . 
   drink ~ ~ beer ~ ~ any kind of alcohol multiple times a week . 
  ~ ~ even at work ~ ~ check . 
   go hiking and eat a brettljausn or a kaiserschmarrn at a h\u00fcttn in the mountains check . 
  though we eat different kinds of food in hutts but ` narezek ' and ' \u0161marn ' are eaten regulary at home . 
   be active in the nature and do sports check . 
   be melancholic about our ~ ~ great ~ ~ history check . 
  [ this ? ], 
  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dllo85zsuk ) wth ? 
  we have [ something similar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjmykhky2ls ) but with youth choirs only .
