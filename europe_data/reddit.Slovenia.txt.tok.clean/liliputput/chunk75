  my family loves picking blueberryies . 
  they pick buckets of them every picking season . 
  i do n't mind . 
  blueberrys with sugar on top , delicious !, 
  it 's also a good brain food . 
  very , very , very . 
  there 's not enough very 's . 
  at least in the part where i live where we have abundance of mushrooms . 
  we do n't look for our cultural identity in serbia . 
  it was brought here during yugoslavia . 
  we have plenty of serbian and bosnian immigrants here that brought it here and still practice it . 
  it 's like saying britain looks for cultural identity in india and pakistan because imigrants from over there brought their culture with them . 
  we have our own culture that is vastly different from serbian one . 
  there is no wall between slovenia and italy . 
  western part of slovenia took quite a lot of italian culture as it was part of it for quite some time . 
  you could say the same about parts of northern italy and southern italy . 
  the culture in those two is different . 
  there 's also doughnuts covered in chocolate filled with vanilla . 
  those are n't good . 
  and trojane also has a blueberry filling . 
  i think . 
  where do you think the name comes from ? 
  rex was a dog from an austrian tv show . 
  everyone and their mother once had a dog named rex . 
  kung fu panda was great . 
  that 's also one of the rares ones i watched dubbed . 
  i did n't know that many countries dubbed . 
  horror !, 
  definitely subtitles . 
  only kids animated movies get dubbed . 
  not your english !, 
  english of spanish people in general lol . 
  your english does sound like you have a speech impediment . 
  is n't there a movement in trieste to gain independence ? 
  i do n't expect any country to be a shithole like some do . 
  i watch youtube videos , i read articles online , i know that even places like grozny are made to look nice . 
  why would it be boring ? 
  it does n't mean i do n't enjoy a country i visit , it just means that i know what to expect before i go . 
  i 'm not one of those who visits a country they just heard of and does n't learn about it on the internet . 
  i 'm also never disappointed by a country . 
  18.000 orphans or 18.000 kids in state care ? 
  i believe it 's the latter . 
  none . 
  i do n't underestimate countries and i come prepared . 
  we do n't have much orphans here . 
  those that by some unfortunate events become orphaned usually go to relatives or they are put up for adoption . 
  there were 9 adopted kids last year , 15 adopted by one of their parents partner and 11 adopted from abroad . 
  there are far more people ( around 600 ) on a waiting list to adopt , than there are kids to adopt . 
  ** edit ** : we have 3 youth homes ( [ 1 ] ( http://www.mladinski-dom-mb.si/ ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.mdj.si/ ) , [ 3 ] ( http://www.malci-beliceve.si/ ) ) for kids who temporarily ca n't live with their parents ( parents incapable to provide for their kids , destructive family , educational carelesness , alcohol abuse in family , sexual abuse or suspicion of it , running away from home , learning difficulties , housing problems , neglection , hospitalization of a parent/parents , etc ) . 
  these homes work based on a `` family education model '' . 
  kids are divided into heterogenous groups of max . 
  10 , mixed by gender , age , complexity , interests . 
  each group has 2 , sometimes 4 `` group parents '' . 
  all of the groups are autonomous and have their own rules . 
  in one of the youth homes , each group lives in a seperate apartment but they all live in the same building . 
  in other 2 youth homes , each group lives in their own house . 
  they live as they were a family . 
  kids go to different local schools , except in one home , where they have an internal school that can be visited by kids from outside the home as well . 
  capacity of all three youth homes combined is 122 . 
  all of the homes are for kids up to age 18 , but they provide facilities ( apartments ) for late teens as well . 
  we also have around 700 care families that take care of around 1000 kids . 
  reasons for a child to be put up in a care family are same as with youth homes . 
  ** edit 2 ** : i think eu is in the process of deinstitualization , which means providing help to families before they reach the critical point and placing as much kids in foster care or a similar programe as possible . 
  no , you 're # 2 , we 're # 10 ( 2013 world data ) , which is still good imo , considering the opt-in system . 
  we 're # 1 in heart transplant by a long shot . 
   ** language ** , culture and history are three things that connect people . 
  do n't you agree ? 
  no i do n't . 
  language connects you to your own nation , not to other countries . 
   this is a weird question . 
  do you feel more connected to germanic speaking countries just because you speak a germanic language ? 
  do you have exchanges with germanic countries just because they 're germanic ? 
  this was my original comment . 
  i still do n't know what you 're trying to prove here if you agree that language group is not something that connects people but culture and history does . 
  we have an opt-in system . 
  people are againts opt-out because of lunatics who spread conspiracy theories . 
  [ slovenia is a democratic republic ] ( http://www.us-rs.si/en/about-the-court/legal-basis/ ), 
  first you say you feel more connected to germanic language group , then you say you do n't feel as connected to switzerland than to finland which does not speak a germanic language . 
  so it 's not language that connects you but history , relations and proximity . 
  that 's the point . 
  someone from poland will definitely feel more connected to lithuania and germany than to for example fyrom . 
  logic . 
  at least 18 countries in europe have opt-out systems . 
  but they probably get stressed . 
  it 's not a nice thing using animals for entertainment of idiots . 
   places like private forests or the use the natural rescourses like forest berries by citizens is pretty restricted . 
  no not really . 
  image of yugoslavia was completely distorted in western media . 
  heck , most still believe we were part of ussr . 
   well ... yes ? 
  the langugae and culture are simliar compared to for instance polish . 
  talk is about language groups not geographic proximity to one another . 
  you 're just contradicting yourself now . 
  no poland . 
  you slavic , you must feel closer to russia . 
  exactly . 
  language has little to do with how much in common you have with someone . 
  it 's relations and history that counts , which is usually , but not always * connected with geographic proximity . 
  so you feel closer to someone in , for example , switzerland than to , let 's say , someone in finland , because they belong to the same language group ? 
  that 's just weird .
