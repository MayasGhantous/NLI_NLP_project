  language , obviously . 
  culture , it depends . 
  but idk why you 'd feel closer to someone just because they belong to the same language group . 
  the intouchables and the hunt are the ones i remember the most and i love them . 
  i watch a lot of foreign films , not just european but i usually forget about them soon . 
  i did n't like blue is the warmest colour . 
  probably everyone that has seen it feels the same way . 
  this is a weird question . 
  do you feel more connected to germanic speaking countries just because you speak a germanic language ? 
  do you have exchanges with germanic countries just because they 're germanic ? 
  just my own . 
  i can never get tired of it . 
  and sardinia . 
  people used to watch those 2 decades ago , i guess . 
  now these competitions do n't even air on tv . 
  no one cares anymore . 
  at all . 
  no chinese and israelis ? 
  they 're percieved as the worst here . 
  go on , share stories . 
  i have a feeling we 're the only country without stag parties . 
  i assume only well educated/cultured ones have ever heard of us . 
  it should stay this way . 
  i would love a free wifi sign !, 
  never heard of it before but good to know !, 
  til !, 
  is radler called something else in english ? 
  in france i know it 's called panache . 
  they probably just thought it 's what it 's called everywhere . 
  ordering fully in german is a dick move though . 
  idk who drinks it , it 's disgusting . 
  who does n't know what radler is ? 
  i ordered ice coffee in bratislava and got hei\u00df coffee haha, 
  they 're the biggest cheapskates , rude and do n't respect anything and anyone . 
  my friend that worked in a hotel said they take everything they can from a hotel room , even lightbulbs . 
   kosovars they 're not tourists if they sell sladoljed . 
  since we do n't have any party destinations nor stag destinations , i 'm not gon na say brits . 
  when they 're not drunk , they 're pleasant . 
  israelis , if you consider them european . 
  i took a photo of a pidgeon in venice eating trash on the floor next to a trash bin . 
  or maybe it could be because the land is not yours . 
  why would you go to dubai with kids if you want on-site facilities with activities ? 
  what 's your point ? 
  have you never been to a resort hotel in greece , egypt , turkey , tunisia ? 
  well i 'm glad . 
  you 're always welcome here . 
  those twats posting idiotic comments are just trolls . 
  italians are very popular tourists here . 
  lol , you 're a tad bit too butthurt , go take a shower or something . 
  because we 're such sunshines !, 
  wow , i think it 's me who hit too close to home . 
  yes , it really hurts me you 're black ? 
  but honestly ? 
  who said you 're black ? 
  and why ? 
  it 's not a thing a here . 
  hahaha . 
  looks like celje licence plate . 
  i will be on the lookout !, 
  but honestly , probably your eastern neighbours :p btw i deleted that gif as it was n't supposed to go under this thread . 
  at least they 're cute , petrol is cheap , you do n't noise polute this stunning country and you can keep that chinese infested trieste . 
  slovenia : those who have better pizza than you . 
  everyone 's a land stealer to you . 
  and you 're a land stealer to everyone . 
  everyone . 
  everyone . 
  something to consider :p, 
  they do . 
  even someone from a non-germanic speaking country can notice that . 
  no , they just use different names to hide their true identity . 
  a lot of nationals of other countries lied that they 're syrians . 
  a lot of people who did n't know each other before , grouped together and pretended they 're family because families had certain priorities . 
  it happaned many times that when they called the names they listed , no one showed up because they made up their names on a whim . 
  it 's fine . 
  google translate to slovene says 86 % * would like to stay * in spain , not that they do stay . 
  ** italians ** - non parlo inglese , loud , unorganised , chill , romantic , always dressed nice , still a lot of fascists by the border ** croatians ** - thieves ** hungarians ** - who ? 
  bad truck drivers ** austrians ** - nationalists , punctual , everything is great and works well in austria , old fashioned , religious, 
  are ski jumpers like janne ahonen and matti hautam\u00e4ki popular in finland ? 
  really ? 
  i know quite a bit of people who went on a erasmus to spain but no one stayed : / i also know people who went to other countries and no one stayed there either . 
  that number seems pretty high to me . 
  but who knows . 
  do you have any page with the statistics ? 
  really ? 
  that 's like an hour and a half drive . 
  it 's really not that much . 
   centralized database this . 
  i have no idea why they did n't have this during the wave last year . 
  every country had it 's own database , so one could be named ahmed habibi in serbia , muhammad baghdadi in croatia and yusef al arifi in slovenia and no one would know . 
   i 'd ask all member states to provide ( from their army/navy/etc . ), 
  ships or men also this . 
  i do n't know why it has n't been done already . 
  we could help them financially and in other ways i guess . 
  and those cities would be more like countries in a country . 
  idk , it 's a silly idea thinking about it . 
  this whole thing realistically would probably never happen . 
  china has plenty of empty , newly built ghost cities . 
  so i 'd make a deal with china . 
  edit : this is mostly a joke . 
  idk what i would do .
