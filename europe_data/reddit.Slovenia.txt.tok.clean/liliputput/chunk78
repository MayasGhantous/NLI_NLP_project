  attended a wedding , a few christenings and a few funerals . 
   do you ever say a prayer , meditate , etc ? 
  no , never did  whether or not you go to a church/mosque/temple etc. 
  or not , do you perceive yourself as ... agnostic atheist  what is your general perception of religion ? 
  i do n't mind it as a personal thing . 
  i believe if it gives hope and courage to others and if it helps them go through life , then good for them . 
  i do mind when people try to mix it with politics and when they do n't understand some people just do n't believe in things they believe in and that we do n't need to live our lives based on what they believe in . 
  huh ? 
  italians in netherlands or italians in italy ? 
  and why ? 
  my experience is that they go out of their way to help you . 
  out of all the countries i 've been to , italians are the best . 
  i have a book , i have n't read it yet though . 
  i did n't know there 's also a movie . 
  i 'll watch it , perhaps it will give me more desire to read the book . 
  if you ask a slovene , not at all , if you ask a tourist , very . 
  really ? 
  never heard of it . 
  slovenia and slovakia are the same thing afterall !, 
  after a person dies , family decides whether they want to cremate the body or not . 
  i do n't think i have ever been to a non-cremated funeral but i 'm pretty sure the funeral goes the same way . 
  with catholic funerals , they bring the coffin/urn to a small building infront of the cemetary ( like [ this ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=mrli%c5%a1ka+ve%c5%beica&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1242&amp;bih=585&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjotyljtehoahwecswkhfjpdf0q_auibigb#imgrc=_ ) usually a day before so the people can come and pray or just say goodbye and pay their respects . 
  the next day , close family and friends again gather in the same building a few hours before the funeral and welcome other ` guests ' . 
  people also bring [ ikebanas ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=ikebana&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1242&amp;bih=585&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjt7vwutuhoahwqhjokhxbmdsgq_auibigb#tbm=isch&amp;q=ikebana+za+grob ) and [ cemetery candles ] ( http://ninainvalentin.si/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/800x600/e5c3f25dbe2a3021345b55270d5894a1/f/i/file_2_6.jpg ) which they leave by the coffin/urn . 
  they also donate money to the family and/or pay for the upcoming memorial masses . 
  then the priest , altar servers and other people who help with the funeral come . 
  people form a line , close family is in the front , behind the funeral people and the coffin/urn . 
  they then carry the coffin/urn to the church where they hold a short goodbye or a full mass . 
  depending on the wishes . 
  then they go to the cemetery . 
  in the villages , if the path where they carry coffin/urn goes by the road , people traveling in cars stop to pay respects . 
  at the cemetary there 's a speech and usually a few musicians , choir singers , guitar players , trumpet players . 
  they then lay the coffin/urn into a grave . 
  people then grab a flower and throw it in the grave . 
  after the funeral , close family and friends go have a lunch together . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etvgae4akig ) is funeral with state and military honors and our president giving a speech . 
  i could n't find any good videos of ` normal ' funerals . 
  take out all the religious stuff and you get an atheist funeral . 
  i 'm not super knowledgeble about funerals so maybe someone can correct me . 
  edit : forgot to insert a link, 
  google translate lied yet again, 
  does n't that just mean godfather/godmather ? 
  at least that 's what google translate says :p, 
   `` weird house windows '' ? 
  any additional insight on that one ? 
  they open in a weird way . 
  i think that 's what he meant . 
   tacky stuff in gardens my neighbours have : * home made very colourful steel slide * home made very colourful steel carousel * huge wooden very colourful barrel turned into a kids playhouse * huge very colourful steel [ wind rattle ] ( https://travelslovenia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/spicnik-vineyards-wind-rattle-1007x989.jpg ) * [ mini hayrack ] ( http://zelenikras.si/si/imagelib/magnify/default/nastanitve/turisticne_kmetije/znidarjevi/znidarjevi-3.jpg ) ( at least it 's wooden and not colourful ) with a bunch of old farm equipement hanged on it , a statue of stan and olio and a statue of a turtle next to it * huge home made steel colourful lookout tower * huge christmas lights in shape of a raindeer hanging on their house throughout a year, 
  that 's for sure how it goes here . 
  the person is usually already in some sort of a relationship with you . 
  usually a sister/brother or a cousin , sometimes a friend , aunt/uncle your own godmother/godfather ... so you 'd never reffer to them as ` my son 's / daughter 's godmother/godfather ' . 
  oh look , we have something in common . 
  what 's up with all the downvotes ? 
  does someone just go through and downvotes every single comment ? 
   nationalism is not about feeling superior , it is a feeling of pride and belonging to one 's nation . 
  i would define that as patriotism . 
  i guess that comes down to different definitions of nationalism , which there are too many of . 
  do you really want prople to feel superior to other people just because they were born in a different country and grew up with a different culture ? 
  coz i do n't . 
  now put yourself in a positon of inferior . 
  how does that feel ? 
   today that we need nationalism again . 
  i think you 're thinking of patriotism . 
  no one needs nationalism . 
  yea , volounteers not part of an experienced group are really not much help . 
  it 's really nice you want to help , but if you want to help in situations like this , join an organisation in your area like sniffer dogs teams , red cross or civil defense . 
  quaran teaches what you want it to teach you . 
  there are as many interpretations as there are people who read it . 
  most people who read it , read individual surahs instead of reading the whole thing and making a conclusion at the end not while reading it . 
  yes , they 're called vineyard peaches here . 
  hard to say because i have a complete package . 
  landline phone : 1000 minutes to all slovene networks tv : 235 tv channels and 42 hd channels * internet : 100/20 mb/s , optic fiber mobile phone : unlimited calls and unlimited sms to all slovene networks and 3gb of data that 's 60 $ . 
  what they stand for is good , but how they do it is not so good . 
  i see it more as regression because it 's just dividing people instead of bringing them closer . 
  awesome !, 
  if i want to change my nationality and/or ethnicity , i just change the last few letters of my last name :d, 
   arches national park wow that looks awesome !, 
  i have heard so many good things about utah !, 
   historian michael allen described him as `` the vilest individual in the vilest organization ever known '' wow . 
  til . 
   globo\u010dnik did n't even think of himself as slovene . 
  it 's hard to deny it when your last name ends with - nik . 
  wow , i never knew someone can have such strong feelings for cosmetics . 
  [ this ] ( https://cookeatandsmile.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/57.jpg ) because people , regions , landscape , accent , attitude ... everything differs so much is tough to put everything and everyone into one picture without stirring a bunch of arguments . 
  [ this ] ( https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/v8mrwxvgtae/0.jpg ) because it 's one thing every slovene identifies with , whether he likes that kind of music or not . 
  bode miller : yay !, 
  how 's anna fenninger doing ? 
  i hope she has a great comeback this year !,
