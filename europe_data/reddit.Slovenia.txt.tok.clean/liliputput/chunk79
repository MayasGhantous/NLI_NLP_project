  i love that we beat you in quarterfinals in sofia despite volleyball not being popular at all as a professional sport here :p, 
  if i put football aside , which is popular everywhere , i 'd say ** ski jumping ** is # 1 , followed by ** skiing ** . 
  unless you count hiking , because that 's by far # 1 . 
  basketball and volleyball are pretty popular everywhere . 
  then there 's sports that are popular in certain regions/towns ( obviously also elswehere but on a smaller scale ) . 
  ** judo ** for example , is popular in celje , ** handball ** is popular in celje and velenje . 
  celje is also a hub for ** athletics ** . 
  ** hockey ** is popular in jesenice , ** cross country skiing ** is popular in areas where the tracks are easily accessible . 
  we have really good results in ** sport climbing ** , so i guess that 's also popular somewhere . 
  also ** kayaking ** and ** canoeing ** on rapids and all sorts of ** cycling ** . 
  ** motocross ** is gaining popularity after tim gajser won the world championship . 
  then there 's also extreme sports , we 're big in ** mountaineering ** and everything else that 's got to do with mountains . 
  we 'd say `` ni da ni '' . 
  which means we do pretty much everything . 
  idk how financing by the government goes , but i have a feeling it 's not financed much . 
  our financing in ski jumping and skiing ca n't compare with austria and especially us for example . 
  the whole team probably gets the same amount of financial support as lindsey vonn . 
  i would n't be reluctant at all to bet they get even less than she does . 
  so financing is pretty much in the hands of parents and sponsors . 
  yep , quite common here , it used to be more common . 
  chao is more popular . 
  we only have [ one ] ( http://www.tnp.si/national_park/ ) but we have a highest percentage of natura 2000 protected areas . 
  if you ask me , the whole country is a national park :p [ list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protected_areas_of_slovenia ) of all protected areas . 
  edit :  one of my favorite things about the area i live in is being a few hours away ... a few hours here means you 're in another country . 
  it 's an underground canyon , so yes . 
  kind of like grand canyon of caves , on a smaller scale of course ,, 
  in slovenia we had [ zvotorepec , trdonja and lakotnik ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/sl/e/e6/zvitorepec,_trdonja_in_lakotnik.jpg ) . 
  it was a very popular comic book in i think , 50s , 60s and 70s . 
  maybe because you do n't know what happened to a child until the child returns ? 
  until you know where your child is , you 'll do anything to find it . 
  you 'll post pics and alert as many people as you can . 
  you wo n't just sit and hope he/she will return later in the day . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're trying to imply . 
  are you saying there 's no missing kids in slovakia or at least less than what amber alert says or are you saying that missing kids are not a problem in slovakia ? 
  ` missing kids ' does n't mean they were all abducted . 
  most missing kids go missing because they run away . 
  and most of those who run away also return . 
  in 1443 house of habsburg and counts of celje signed an agreement on succession in case one of the families goes ` extinct ' ( no male descendants ) . 
  unfortunately ulrich ii of celje was killed in 1456 in belgrade so the line of counts of celje became extinct and habsburgs inherited everything . 
  i like to think that if it was vice versa and habsburgs died firts , the course of history would be different . 
  this is a legit question . 
  as someone who works with kids i 'm really interested in this . 
  we learnt about the system in slovenia in my social pedagogy class . 
  we do n't have much orphans here , most are just temporarily away from their parents for different reasons ( social instability , behavioral , emotional problems , hospitalised parents etc. ) . 
  they 're taken to ` youth homes ' . 
  this homes work based on what we call `` family education system '' . 
  that means kids are divided into groups/families , mixed by age , sex and complexity . 
  maximum 10 members . 
  they are led by 2 , sometimes 4 educators that work as their ` home parents ' . 
  in 2 homes , groups are completely autonomus and live in seperate houses , not in the same building . 
  in one of the homes , groups are autonomous and live in seperate apartments but in the same building . 
  one of the homes has an ` internal school ' and kids in other 2 homes visit local schools . 
  i assume you do n't have those classic style orphanages most people think of when they hear that word in hungary either . 
  that 's why i was taken back by that word . 
  edit : and ofcourse , there 's also foster care . 
  you disagree with internationaly acclaimed abduction/missing * alert system that works so well in many countries ? 
  why would it lie ? 
  do you think they just post random kids pics or what ? 
  haha . 
  do you still have orphanages in hungary ? 
  it 's amber alert . 
  amber alert is never wrong . 
  it 's a child abduction alert system mostly used in the states and according to wikipedia , 17 european countries . 
  please . 
  celje and la\u0161ko speak a * clean slovene with the same amount of influence from the countryside as everywhere else . 
  definitely cleaner than ljubljana . 
  the countryside was more influenced by celje dialect and ` standard ' slovene spoken in schools than vice versa . 
  there should be a disclaimer * in the sidebar for everyone to ignore this guy . 
  no , the closest to standard are celje and la\u0161ko . 
  no , that 's why i said we 're out . 
  we 're out then . 
  2 comforters because you always fight if it 's only one and one always ends up uncovered . 
  also , some people are hot during the night , some cold , with two , you can have 2 different thicknesses . 
  lame, 
  * [ dormouse ] ( http://www.slovenia.info/pictures/cuisine/1/2008/pol%c4%b9%cb%87jaobara[1]_183108.jpg ) in a few regions in the south . 
  * chicken gizzards in soup of fried . 
  i like them fried as a snack in front of tv . 
  * [ vampi ] ( http://www.220stopinjposevno.com/uploads/1/5/0/1/15016780/7070785.jpg?496 ) - tripe soup * pigs feet , snout , tail or pigs ears in sour soup or ri\u010det ( barley soup ) - very rare . 
  * beef or pork tongue . 
  usually smoked . 
  * beef brain with scrambled egg ( you ca n't get beef brain in stores anymore since bse but you can get them at local farmers ) edit : i also notice [ this ] ( http://www.pretehtajte.si/content/img/17b3f_zolca.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://images.24ur.com/media/images/640x338/aug2011/60733609.jpg?d41d ) in stores . 
  i think it 's called ' \u017eolca ' and it contains meat and some also vegetables but i do n't know how it 's made . 
  very popular in slovenia as well . 
  there 's no christmas without tatarski biftek . 
  we do that too with leftover pancakes . 
  it looks like [ this ] ( http://carnitasmexican.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/pork-rinds.jpg ) . 
  it 's a thing in lots of countries . 
  i think it 's called ` pork rinds ' in english . 
  but ours are more light and puffy compared to ` pork rinds ' i googled . 
  i have never seen them in stores here . 
  you can get them at local farmers or at the thing we call `` pig fair '' . 
  no , except for a layover at atat\u00fcrk airport , but it 's very high on my list . 
  i 've been wanting to go for years but i 'm afraid it 's too unstable right now . 
  i know there 's very little chance of anything happening while i 'm there or me being at a place of terror attack , but i just do n't want to risk it . 
  ** austria ** - i like shopping trips every now and then and visiting christmas markets . 
  ** croatia ** - my croatian cello teacher from when i was a kid ** hungary ** - who ? 
  ** italy ** - food and nice people . 
  i like that we took your pizza and made it better . 
  please put him on ignore . 
  lol .
