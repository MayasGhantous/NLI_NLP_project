  i love the sound of sigur ros , i do n't think you you need to know what they 're saying , just listen . 
  it 's beautiful . 
  most of these are old , you could say classics now lol . 
  i do n't know who 's famous right now .

  sure . 
  besides uk music , i like zucchero from italy . 
  i like stromae from belgium and maitre gims from france . 
  i like nightwish , h.i.m , children of boddom , apocalyptica from finland and sigur ros from iceland . 
  probably lots more that i ca n't remember right now . 
  when i was younger i watched german viva tv and liked a lot of german artists . 
  jews are virtually non exsistent here so it 's hard to judge . 
  idk exactly how many jews live here as different sources say different things . 
  i guess around 300 . 
  i have never heard of any anti-semitism . 
  even one incident would blow up here and would be in the news for weeks to come . 
  people are generally more inclined towards support for palestine , so you 'll hear negative comments directed towards israeli politcs , but that 's about it . 
  hi mr. !, 
  this is such a good opportunity !, 
  what 's your western union account number ? 
  i will deposit money asap . 
  fast reply is appreciated . 
  you blow your whole day in school . 
  school in slovenia starts at 7 or 8 am . 
  and we 're done by around 2pm . 
  younger kids earlier of course . 
  n , central and s america are all on different tectonic plates . 
  europe and asia are on the same tectonic plate . 
  it would make mor sense calling europe and asia `` eurasia '' than calling n , central and s america `` americas '' . 
  and nigeria with their kingdom of princes . 
  that 's the worst kind of weather . 
  it 's surprising you do n't have more suicides . 
  hahaha trust me , you find daisies like this in serbian music as well . 
  so much simpler in cities . 
  city gas . 
  and it 's cheap . 
  hobs are either gas , induction or electric ceramic or a combination gas/induction or gas/electric and ovens are electric . 
  electric ceramic hobs are shit . 
  induction hobs are on the rise because it looks cleaner than gas . 
  when people renovate their kitchen nowadays they usually pfreffer induction over gas . 
  or half/half . 
  i 'd go for half/half . 
  we still have a lot of wood burning cook stoves in the countryside like [ this ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=vgradni+%c5%a1tedilnik+na+drva&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi394at57boahxkvbqkhecgd1uq_auibigb#tbm=isch&amp;q=%c5%a1tedilnik+na+drva ) . 
  never alone though . 
  it 's always gas/electric stove and this . 
  people do n't use wood burning stoves in the summer so electric/gas stove is needed . 
  is n't that just austrian ? 
  we all have kn\u00f6dels . 
  and everything else u/slusny _ cizinec said . 
   what 's the best food , drink or practice your country adopted from your ** colonies ** ? 
  one i hate the most is that whole ee/slavic part of europe has the same culture and food . 
  wtf ? 
  there was a question on here , some time ago , about what cuisine people like/dislike . 
  and some people were mentioning `` slavic food '' . 
  wth is `` slavic food '' ? 
  and what the hell is slavic culture ? 
  we have nothing in common with , let 's say , ukrainians . 
  british english . 
  but since we 're more exposed to american vocabulary and spelling , i think most people use a mixture . 
  [ example 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17lhh2ikzns ) [ example 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khv0m5jxszc ) i am so sorry you have to listen to this . 
  `` cigumigu '' is just an expression for bad music . 
  oh well , you have a point . 
  i do n't think any * whole country * in the world has such a climate though . 
  they 're still part of a european country . 
  i think it fits what op was asking . 
  apart from what everyone else gets , we get a lot of serbian and bosnian `` cigumigu '' . 
  i ca n't stand it . 
  i walk around my neighbourhood and all i hear is this music comming from the bars . 
  so everyone 's suggesting their country , i might as well throw slovenia in . 
  you do n't have to stay in the city for a whole week here . 
  you can even combine it with another country . 
  you can do a day/two and a night in ljubljana . 
  christmas decoration is great and unique . 
  visit one of the caves , lakes , maybe piran or another town . 
  lake bled and bohinj can be quite magical surrounded by winter fog . 
  there 's very little chance of snow , but you might be lucky . 
  if you 're christian or even if you 'd just like it , they have live nativity scene plays in postojna cave every year . 
  that could be interesting . 
  i definitely recommend a road trip around , if you come here in summer or winter . 
  as said , you can also visit other towns in neighbouring countries . 
  graz in austria is very lovely year round . 
  venice is not far either , you could do a day trip there with prince of venice . 
  if you ca n't distinguish between rounded mountains and pointy mountais and between a double cross and stars then perhaps ask a child to explain those differeces to you . 
  i completely agree . 
  i love budapest way more than prague . 
   i do n't know why , but scandinavian pancakes are just something other than cr\u00eape and what other countries call pancakes . 
  they are glorious . 
  i have tried them and see no difference with pancakes we make here . 
  so what 's the supposed difference ? 
   traditional danish cuisine is underrated everywhere , except denmark . 
  i think every country with lesser know cuisine thinks the same . 
   please , do tell us more about these ( sometimes ) free meals o_o this is so very uniquely slovenian , i ca n't imagine this in a other country !, 
   ... basicaly like every student university mess anywhere . 
  what ? 
  also austria in winter sports . 
  student meals are subsidized . 
  so you can get some things like sandwiches for free in a lot of places in lj and mb . 
  other , proper meals , cost up to around 4,5 $ . 
  every restaurant that offers subsidized student meals has special student menues .
