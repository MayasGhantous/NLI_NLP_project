  i think you 'll be able to decipher some . 
  this is some of the works we go through in 4 years . 
  we only do excerpts of some works . 
  we have `` mandatory home reading '' . 
  this differs from school to school , teacher to teacher and year to year but there are some guidelines . 
  these are the most typical ones in recent years : year 1 : stories from the bible , sophocles - oedipus the king or antigone , something by shakespeare or cervantes - don quixote , linhart - ta veseli dan ali mati\u010dek se \u017eeni , 1 book by choice year 2 : pre\u0161eren - krst pri savici , flaubert - madame bovary or dostoevsky - crime and punishment or tolstoy - war and peace , kersnik - jara gospoda , tav\u010dar - viso\u0161ka kronika , 1 book by choice year 3 : oscar wilde - salome , cankar - hlapci , grum - dogodek v mestu gogi , pregelj - matkova tina , pre\u017eihov voranc - boj na po\u017eiravniku or samorastniki , kranjec - re\u017eonja na svojem , kosma\u010d - tantadruj , world novel of 19th or 20th century by choice , camus - the stranger , 1 book by choice year 4 : 1 book by choice and final exam literature picks ( different every year , 2016 - feri lain\u0161\u010dek - lo\u010dil bom peno od valov and tolstoy - anna karenina ), 
  they are controlled since the beginning of migrant wave last year . 
  i do n't know about train travel but if travelling by car you will for sure see military patrolling and checking cars . 
  southern border at least . 
  i would assume crossing the border on train would be similar . 
  i still do n't see how that 's hate speech . 
  just an opinion some may not agree with . 
  if she acted upon that hate , that may become hate speech . 
  thanks for the photos . 
  could n't immagine it without help . 
  bread with cold cuts , cheese , butter and jam/honey , nutella or p\u00e2t\u00e9 . 
  tea or coffee for drink . 
  also m\u00fcsli with milk/yogurt , hot dog sausage , \u010dokolino or some sort of a breakfast pastry . 
  on the weekends at grandmas also possible pancakes/schmarrn or any kind of \u017eganci ( usually corn \u017eganci ) with milk . 
  edit : forgot sunny side up eggs , scrambled eggs and soft boiled eggs . 
  maybe this is a que for double flair suggestion , if that 's even possible . 
  saying you hate something , is not hate speech at all . 
  anywhere from 25-35 \u00b0 c. 
  it gets even colder . 
  even bellow 20 \u00b0 c. 
  and of course hotter . 
  we get over 30 days with temperatures higher than 30 \u00b0 c. 
  and up to 10 days over 35 \u00b0 c. 
  the highest officially measured temperature was around 41 \u00b0 c. 
  it can get very humid after storms . 
  and we get a lot of heavy storms . 
  i was about to write you 're delusional until i read you live in cyprus . 
  this whole thing is bizzare . 
  anyway , you need an id or a passport on you at all times . 
  german borders are quite heavily patrolled . 
  edit : germany / austria border . 
  aparently not all the borders . 
  we have [ that ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=jetrna+pa%c5%a1teta&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjh98ez8z_oahwclcwkhxsndi8q_auibigb ) too , among with other types of p\u00e2t\u00e9 's . 
  it 's a very popular breakfast thing . 
  we have [ roasted livers ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=pra%c5%beena+jetrca&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewismok58z_oahwg_ywkhrdwdr8q_auibigb ) as well . 
  no no no . 
  baklava is completely different . 
  baklava is only made out of nuts and filo pastry and then topped with honey . 
  best breakfast ever !, 
  i like it very thick . 
  thick enough for the spoon to stand in it . 
  i love the new \u010dokolino plus . 
  it 's layers of poppy seed , cottage cheese , wallnuts and apples . 
  and very , very , very thin layers of dough . 
  [ prekmurska gibanica ] ( http://images.24ur.com/media/images/640x338/apr2011/60650381.jpg?2e96 ) . 
  i refused to try it for years because it 's ugly , but then i did and now i ca n't stop eating it . 
  ti to resno ? 
   not many here care , why would anyone outside care ? 
  apart from those who had to take a short detour . 
  3000 ni ` many ' . 
   thousands  ), 
  not many here care , why would anyone outside care ? 
  apart from those who had to take a short detour . 
  would n't that be a breach of privacy ? 
  what a good argument . 
  no , as far as i know , only spanish speaking world considers north and south america as one continent . 
  the rest of us see it as two different continents . 
  we have it too . 
  it 's also a character in famous childrens books/movies about kekec . 
  though that [ pehta ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jolic9swnga&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2385 ) is a lot less scary , but still scary . 
  st. martin is a very popular holiday here . 
  it 's the day when must turns into wine . 
  consequently we drink a lot of wine on that day and there 's a lot of police on the roads . 
  we eat [ st. martin 's goose , red cabbage and mlinci ] ( http://www.220stopinjposevno.com/uploads/1/5/0/1/15016780/7580690.jpeg?458 ) . 
  meh , we do n't have this kind of division here . 
  house price depends on the size , location and the state the house is in . 
  old abandoned houses in the countryside are cheap . 
  newly built houses in the cities are more expensive . 
  people here tend to live in the same house throughout their life so most they do is built an extention to the house if needed and renovate the facade and balcony railings . 
  edit : [ link ] ( https://www.nepremicnine.net/nepremicnine.html?d=197&amp;p=1&amp;n=2&amp;r=5&amp;s=13 ) as you can see , there 's not a lot of luxury houses . 
  most with high prices come with a lot of property which brings the cost up . 
  ours is accompanied by parkeljni or krampus ' and angels . 
  he gives out oranges , dried fruits and chocolates . 
  and if the kids were naughty , they get a twig from parkeljni . 
  i 'm not sure if these are unique to slovenia , but the way we celebrate them might be unique . 
  we celebrate round birthdays , like 20 , 30 , 40 etc. 
  50th , or ambraham as we call it , is especially huge . 
  usually people rent a venue and invite everyone they know . 
  in the countryside people also hang up signs and balloons infront of the house to notify people that someone will be celebrating a birthday there . 
  brave ones steal speed limit signs ( ex . 
  round 30 speed limit for 30th birthday ) and put them infront of the house . 
  recently i started to notice they also put out this weird creepy hand made life size doll that sits infront of their house and if there 's multiple people celebrating birthdays in the village they put a `` round village '' sign somewhere in the village . 
  we celebrate silver , golden and diamond wedding anniversarys . 
  on may 1st and some other occasions ( birthdays , christening etc. 
  ) , people in villages put up `` mlajs '' ( singular mlaj ) . 
  it 's an old pagan tradition but i think the meaning in those times was differt . 
  mlaj is a very tall spruce tree . 
  they cut the bottom branches and only leave the branches on top and they decorate the trunk with ribbons and sometimes slovene flag . 
  we have a lot of village parties . 
  we call them firefighter parties because they 're organised by local firefighters . 
  the main theme of all of these is a lot of wine , also beer , harmonica , meat , singing and dancing , weird games and short plays/sketches . 
  we call it sveti nikolaj or miklav\u017e for short . 
  i think it 's the same pretty much everywhere in europe . 
  it 's certainly the case in slovenia . 
  25th is reserved to visit family if you wish so .
