  why do you think eastern and western europe would have a different peeing culture ? 
  that 's not the point i 'm trying to make , but ok . 
  you forgort winter sports rivalry with austria . 
  relative, 
  obviously everywhere . 
  # 1 ** spain ** # 2 ** croatia ** # 3 malta # 4 ** belgium ** # 5 ** portugal ** # 6 usa # 7 ** france ** # 8 ** austria ** # 9 estonia # 10 slovenia [ source ] ( http://www.irodat.org/?p=database ) edit : countries in bold have opt-out system , could n't find info for estonia . 
  over here we have opt-in system . 
  less than 1 % of people have a donor card . 
  but in case of death almost 80 % of relatives agree with donating organs of the deceased relative . 
  we are members of eurotransplant . 
  we have most tranplanted hearts per capita in the world and and we have very good results in liver tranplantations . 
  blood donations are very popular . 
  we have never ran out of blood . 
  sometimes hospitals have blood donation days . 
  students have specific blood donation days , some companies as well . 
  over the border in austria you get payed around 20 $ for donating * blood . 
  please do n't listen to this guy . 
  his views are more often than not very distorted . 
  recent thing about transgenders and toilets . 
  so weird . 
  why you making such a fuss about it ? 
  from what i can see on google maps , i think other buildings around there are way uglier . 
  nope , not really a thing here . 
  from american chain restaurants we only have mcdonalds , 1 burger king and 1 subway . 
  that 's it . 
  no other chain restaurants . 
  there 's a lot of places that offer american style burgers nowadays though . 
  but i would n't really call them american style restaurants . 
  most simple style restaurants here offer things like pizza , pasta , schnitzels , calamari , chicken or turkey in natural or mushroom sauce and similar . 
  it changes . 
  there used to be a lot of german shepherds , golden retrievers , labradors , english cocker spaniels , toy poodles , yorkies , shi-tzus , pekingese , maltezers and west highland terriers . 
  then for some time beagles were very popular . 
  now you see mostly mutts , pugs , french bulldogs and from bigger breeds bernese mountain dogs , boxers , staffies , pit bulls , huskeys . 
  there 's also a lot of rescued salukis , greyhounds , whippets and similar breeds . 
  reminds me of [ maximarket ] ( http://www.mladina.si/media/www/slike.old/clanki/200431/maximarket_display.jpg ) ( also a shopping mall ) and [ cankarjev dom ] ( http://www.fg2015.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/cankar2.jpg ) attached to it . 
  such a horrible eyesore . 
  i 'm honestly worried they 'll never get rid of this shit . 
  everyone hates it . 
  the whole square ( republic square ) was declared a cultural monument of exceptional national importance because it 's where they declared independence . 
  how embarrassing . 
  kindergarten is now in the dorm itself . 
  they also get +10 subsidised meals . 
  i think uni of maribor and uni of primorska offer family apartments as well . 
  there 's a a lot of ugly ones . 
  [ this horrid thing ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/@46.2265453,15.2668454,3a,75y,246.25h,88.9t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1shovq3vgo9p0mnoepl3isha!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  i do n't exactly live in the city but i did go to school here as i live around 30km away . 
  my favourite is [ celjski dom ] ( http://www.jurekralj.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/jkw5473.jpg ) . 
  it was built for the german comunity so it used to be called `` german house '' . 
  it 's not in the greatest shape but i heard they will start renovating it this year . 
  i used to love [ raku\u0161ev mlin ] ( http://www.radioantena.si/img/gallery/photo/ra_68335739-d80a-44e9-ae2a-b019df91092e.jpg ) but as you can see there was a huge fire so they demolished it . 
  it was a huge abandoned industrial building , an ex steam mill and then home to druggies and a playground for youth for years . 
  well that 's good to know . 
  no , it says they ca n't on their website . 
  that 's a +2 graduate programme . 
  i think you should be looking into undergraduate programmes . 
  i ca n't help you on which programme is better since i do n't study there . 
  perhaps contact [ student council of economic faculty ] ( https://www.facebook.com/studentskisvetef/ ) and ask them for advice . 
  also note that you will have to prove your knowledge of english if english is not your native language . 
  you need a cerf b2 level/toefl 79/ielts 6 . 
  hahahahahaha oops . 
  will correct :p, 
  fluor is recommended . 
  our water is n't extra fluoridaded . 
  most waters have 0,03 - 0,05 f/liter . 
  maximum measured is 0,08 - 0,09 f/liter . 
  we do n't have fluoridated salt . 
  we have 212 ... go figure . 
  our smallest only has around 360 people . 
  i had a few e-pals from the philippines . 
  it 's free for eu people and a few others in slovenia . 
  [ faculty of economics in ljubljana ] ( http://www.ef.uni-lj.si/en ) is good . 
  there 's a lot of portugese erasmus students here . 
  you get subsidised meals , which means you get to eat for super cheap . 
  anywhere from 0,00 $ to 4,37 $ . 
  but as far as i know , foreign students who are n't a part of an exchange programme ca n't get a subsidised residence in student dormitories . 
  i think you can get a room in secondary school dormitories but i 'm not sure . 
  but apartment share rents are n't that high . 
  you can get it for 150 $ . 
  native : slovenian . 
  the only foreign language i 'm fluid in is english . 
  i can get by in germany , austria ( switzerland ? 
  idk ... ) , croatia , bosnia , serbia and montenegro . 
  a little bit less in japan , but i 'd manage . 
  i studied german for a year and french for 2 years when i was a child . 
  and then i studied japanese and tried korean . 
  i 'm also pretty good in tagalog , but it 's such an easy language i think everyone could semi-learn it in a week . 
  no , it 's for national trains and international trains . 
  yes , most dogs i 've seen here did n't wear a muzzle either , you just need it with you i guess . 
  i think taking a train is the best option . 
  maybe break it down so it 's not just one long journey but a few shorter ones . 
  but you know your dog best so you know how much he can handle . 
  i know i would n't even dare take my little idiot on a 5min train ride . 
  he 's a barking little jerk afraid of everything . 
  good luck !, 
  i think it was when we got pop tv which was in 1995 . 
  i do n't remember much before that . 
  i just know we had those old us cartoons like tom and jerry and others . 
  i remember fresh prince of bel air , full house , step by step etc. 
  later on i was i fan of er , chicago hope , 3rd rock from the sun , friends and others . 
  there 's really too much to list .
