  do they ? 
  i did n't know that . 
  over here smaller dogs need to be in a cage or on an owners lap . 
  bigger dogs need a muzzle , be on a leash and lay by the owners feet so that they do n't disturb other passangers . 
  i 've seen plenty of people travelling this way . 
  on the slovenian railway site it says transport of animals to and out of is not allowed in norway , finland , great britain , ireland , northern ireland , spain ( dogs are allowed in a sleeper coach ) , portugal and morocco . 
  in germany and belgium dogs with a muzzle and on a leash are allowed . 
  i guess it 's best to contact railway companies in the countries you travel through but it seems it would n't be a problem taking a dog on a train from germany to italy if he 's used of a muzzle , people and staying still . 
  how is your dog heath wise ? 
  considering his age i 'd rather opt with a train journey where he can probably stay with you , rather than being packed in a cage in the luggage compartment on an airplane . 
  we used to have a lot of american cartoons ( looney toons , road runner ... ) . 
  we had oprah , dr. phil , dr. oz , ricky lake , jerry springer , stuff like that . 
  we have ellen now . 
  anything gordon ramsey . 
  and i guess that 's about it . 
  storage wars and other things like that are on nat . 
  geo , discovery channel , tlc , disney , etc. 
  and of course a bunch of american tv series . 
   do n't be loud , do n't be obnoxous well ... he will be in italy . 
  used for both hello and goodbye in slovenia . 
  might be different at the coast because they have the most italian influences but probably not . 
  no , just grilling . 
  in your op , you 're asking about europe , not the uk . 
  you are going to europe , but you 're going to 9/50 countries . 
  all i 'm saying is , you need to specify what countries you 're interested in because every country has different laws . 
  no need to get all pissy about it . 
  because every country has different laws , that 's why . 
  you 're only going to the uk , not the whole europe so it 's pointless to be asking about the whole continent . 
  just specify you 're asking about uk or go to the uk subreddit . 
  when there 's a celebrity anything in slovenia , majority of the so called celebrities have never even been seen before . 
  yep . 
  i do n't remember kerry katona but i remember natasha hamilton because i used to fancy her . 
  erm , i do n't really know . 
  i do n't know if we even have these sort of celebrities . 
  we have [ salome ] ( http://www.slovenskenovice.si/bulvar/domaci-trac/foto-salome-skozi-leta ) . 
  she 's a transgender from croatia but she lives here . 
  [ more photos for you ] ( http://www.slovenskenovice.si/bulvar/domaci-trac/foto-salome-se-je-slekla-na-domacem-otoku ) . 
  then there 's [ this ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=toma%c5%be+miheli%c4%8d&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjhijxazufnahufnxqkhcvtdgyq_auibigb ) guy . 
  i think he 's just gay not transgender . 
  he used to be a part of sestre , a drag group that represented us on eurovision . 
  [ these two ] ( http://www.zurnal24.si/ana-in-tibor-bosta-zibala-clanek-266947 ) were in big brother . 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.zurnal24.si/zlatko-predstavil-zeno-clanek-146873 ) is an annoying `` rapper '' . 
  really annoying . 
  that 's about it i guess . 
  i do n't know if they 're still relevant . 
  edit : forgot to attach links . 
  did you have to post that ? 
  at least we have enough caves to hide in shame . 
  he sure looks like a ciganovi\u010d in that photo : / edit : whoops . 
  it 's the grubni\u0107 guy that looks like a ciganovi\u010d . 
  kind of both do . 
  the only one i have heard of is nives celzijus . 
  but do n't know what she looks like . 
  will click on it now . 
  she was in attomic kitten . 
  that is so nice !, 
  huh ? 
  another one of those stupid questions . 
  i do n't care . 
  and i do n't care about ronaldo but i do like seeing how very into the game he is . 
  he looks really depressed when not doing ok and really happy when doing ok . 
  so i would be happy if portugal wins . 
  ask yourself this . 
  do you want indigenous cultures of africa , asia , south america etc disappear ? 
  i bet not . 
  so why would you want european cultures to disappear ? 
  why do we try so hard to preserve cultres in other parts of the world but do n't care about european cultures ? 
  are we less important ? 
  obviously it would take decades for cultures of bigger countries to be completely gone but not so long with smaller countries . 
  your comparison with the us is just so very bad that i 'm not gon na comment on that any further . 
  erm no they do n't . 
  looking at someone does not equal staring and it especially does not mean you think bad about them . 
  everyone knows poland is racist . 
  i 'm sorry if poland is so backwards in this , but most people here do n't give a shit if a black person walks past them . 
  we had plenty of black students here during yugoslavia and they were never viewed bad . 
  yes . 
  that . 
  nothing special i guess . 
  we do n't have many anyway . 
  piran has a black mayor and no one bats an eye about it , not about his skin colour anyway . 
  there 's some women from dominican republic that work as erotic dancers . 
  i do n't think anyone has a special opinion about them . 
  nothing new ... 
   i mean a rendition of the alps ? 
  that common heritage of france , italy , germany and austria . 
  akhm ... back to the topic , i like euro notes . 
  but i would n't really care if they changed either . 
  each eurozone country could design their own notes , like the coins , no ? 
  i never remember to vote . 
  i 'll try to remember from now on . 
  once i was in a hostel somewhere in asia and an american dude asks me where i 'm from . 
  then he takes me to this polish guy and says `` look , he 's from poland ! '', 
  and then smiles encouragingly . 
  yea ... so what ? 
  as if we 're supposed to be best friends or something because we 're slavic ? 
  there were some other europeans there as well . 
  that would kill me as well . 
  if you have a freezer and a fan , just freeze bottles of water and put them in front of a turned on fan . 
  that 's what we used to do . 
  i do n't know anyone who craves a schnitzel and fries in a 30 \u00b0 c weather .
