  any i especially do n't know anyone who 's eager to cook something like that in that kind of heat without air con . 
  yes , sometimes it 's necessary but most of the times people just eat something lighter . 
  like a tomato , bell pepper , cucumber and onion salad with lots of vinegar and pumpkin seed oil to dip your bread in . 
  na\u0161e vasi so najlep\u0161e . 
  i may be a bit biased , but yes to ljubljana . 
  and i 'd do kor\u010dula instead of hvar . 
  typical is that there is no typical . 
  there are new houses , old houses , pretty houses , terrible houses , white houses , bright red houses . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/@46.3174625,15.4799687,3a,75y,211.39h,77.07t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sepngzxdyv4pyrz89m8hvtq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) is a random small village in the eastern part of the country . 
  wikipedia says population is 594 . 
  this kind of small villages are very common here . 
  even smaller ones , more like settlements rather than villages where 2 cars can barely meet and there 's a few houndred meters between the houses . 
  safe driving test is awesome , i 'm thinking of doing it again . 
  also , young drivers need a `` young driver insurance '' which is quite a bit more expensive than the regular one . 
  1st aid class and exam = ** 85 $ ** health check up = ** 40 $ ** road and traffic regulations class and exam = ** 60 $ ** then you need a minimmum of 20h with a driving instructor in a driving school . 
  20 hours is usually for those who had a driving licence but was taken for them . 
  1st time driver in ljubljana needs 40 hours on average . 
  1 driving hour with an instructor is around ** 24 $ ** , cheaper if you take it in a package of 10 , 20 , 30 etc hours . 
  30 hours in a driving school i went to , was 660 $ . 
  i have heard of people needing 200 hours and more . 
  then , when your instructor thinks you 're ready , he or she will apply you for a driving exam with an official examiner . 
  that costs an additional ** 15 ** $ . 
  if you do n't pass , you 'll need additional hours with your instructor and additional exams so the cost will go up . 
  so if you 're an average driving student in ljubljana and you need 40 driving hours , the whole thing will cost you around ** 1100 $ ** . 
  edit : this is a cost if you pass everything on 1st try , which is kind of rare . 
  edi2 : after 2 years of having a drivers licence you need to do a `` young driver - safe * driving '' theoretical and practical class but there 's no exam . 
  this class is done at a driving park and teaches you how to react in dangerous situations such as slippery road , sudden obsticle on a road etc. . . 
  this costs ** 125 $ ** . 
  as everything else , this is an obligatory test or you wo n't get your licence extended . 
  it 's mostly popular with teens . 
  scooters are one of the reasons kids still get confirmation done here . 
  because scooter is a popular gift . 
  they usually use them to get to the train or bus station to go to school . 
  i rarely see adults using them . 
  there was plenty of talk about it a few months ago . 
  my impression is that majority ( edit : maybe `` most '' is a more suitable word ) want it legalized . 
  there was talk about legalizing it but it 's such a dificult topic and so much to be done around it , it will take a while . 
  things have been quiet lately though . 
  i thought so : /, 
  you 're so sad . 
  the question is `` what sort of criminals are considered `` the worst '' in your country ? '', 
  not `` what sort of crimes are discused mostly '' . 
  i am positive other countries do n't constantly talk about pedophilia , do they ? 
  and you 're just blabbing in the wrong direction . 
  if you go and ask random people what sort of crime they think is the worst , i am pretty damn sure most will say pedophilia and very little to none will even think of bringing up `` tycoons '' . 
  i have never witnessed or heard about racims against black people . 
  no one gives a shit about black people . 
  there 's not many of them here anyway and those who are are well integrated . 
   yes , slovenia . 
  the locally dubbed `` tycoons '' realistically take the cake for `` most hated criminals '' , at least judging by the people 's electoral choices and constant bitching . 
  that 's because that 's all that is in the news all the time . 
  why would we bitch about things that are n't constantly in the news ? 
   i do n't remember many people giving e.g. 
  catholic church priest pedophilia scandals a second thought publicly . 
  yea , there 's a proof you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  everyone shits over catholic church for pedophilia scandals . 
  it 's one of the biggest arguments againts them . 
  if not the biggest . 
  thank you !, 
  very well explained !, 
  i have actually stumbled upon a pedophilia subthread on some psyche forum once . 
  it was kind of sad to read their posts . 
  most of them were considering suicide to prevent themselves from doing harm to others . 
  erm , do you expect any european country to not put pedophiles on the top spot ? 
  what ? 
  in slovenia , firefighters are very well respected . 
  we have professional and volounteer firefighters . 
  pretty much every village has volounteer firefighters and a lot of the kids are members . 
  joining firefighters is like joining scouts . 
  they have weekly excercises . 
  of course , kids do n't participate in case of emergencies but they are just being trained through play . 
  people are never reluctant to donate money to volounteer firefighters . 
  police on the other hand are not so well respected . 
  they are seen as those who just wait in the bushes for people who speed . 
  i do n't know whether this is a general opinion , or just an opinion of those loud idiots who always comment on the news portals . 
  i certainly do n't share this opinion . 
  well it does get up to 36/37 , about once a year even more . 
  26 is quite chilly . 
  in winter , we usually keep an inside temperature at around 24 . 
  so 25/26 in summer is appropriate in my apartment * . 
  putting it on 17 and then going outside in scorching heat is dangerous . 
  air conditioning is not very common but not out of ordinary in slovenia . 
  they are getting way more popular now because summers are getting way hotter . 
  we have it at home and turn it on when it 's 30 + outside . 
  and we never set it lower than 26 or 25 . 
  that 's plenty cold in the summer . 
  it 's advised that the difference between outside temp . 
  and inside temp . 
  should n't be more than 4 \u00b0 c. 
  so what stance does the uk have on ttip ? 
  is it true they want to block a democratic vote or is that just a rumor i heard ? 
  my question is , if they do decide to leave , before they go , can they still vote on things like ttip even though they 'll be leaving and it wo n't concern them ? 
  pony is comming back !, 
  it 's definitely not a lot . 
  you can get by for less if you need to save , but that would mean your diet would n't be very good and varied . 
  it 's easier to get by in the summer if you have a garden though . 
  food prices in germany and slovenia are about the same . 
  bankomat, 
  in slovenia a single person gets around 300 $ . 
  that 's enough if you live with someone who pays the bills but not otherwise .
