  you can ask the social services to pay the bills for you though . 
  and they do . 
  they cover all the nesessary and basic bills . 
  you 're also exampt from paying into the national health system and the `` extra '' health system . 
  you have to be active at seeking a job . 
  at my last work , a woman who was getting a minimum wage said she will not try to seek a job anymore because life with a minimum wage is not any better than living on benefits . 
  edit : if you do a certain amount of hours per week of volounteer work , you can get extra 150 $ a month in benefits . 
  be careful . 
  he might put you on a do-not-travel-list for some reason or another . 
  brave scotsmen !, 
  dear god !, 
  even [ so\u010da ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/so%c4%8da ) reaches those temperatures in summer and it 's considered super cold . 
   15-20 degrees o_o we do n't consider sea swimmable until it 's at least 20 \u00b0 c. 
  it usually gets to around 25 \u00b0 c and during a heat wave it can get up to almost 30 . 
  quite popular in slovenia . 
  we have 2 kinds of scouts . 
  `` taborniki '' , that roughly translate to `` campers '' and `` skavti '' who are a catholic version and are based on robert baden-powell scout movement . 
  but you do n't have to be catholic to join skavti . 
  according to `` taborniki union '' webpage , 20 % of slovenians are or were once members of the union and skavti webpage says they have around 4500 members . 
  * 1st aid class and exam . 
  * medical exam . 
  * traffic and road regulations class and exam . 
  * minimum of 20 practical hours of driving in a driving school ( average in ljubljana is around 40 hours ) . 
  * passing practical driving exam . 
  * after having a licence for 2 years , `` young driver '' practical class where you learn how to response in dangerous and critical conditions . 
  well i do n't know anyone who is considering getting a gun ( apart from hunters of course ) . 
  that makes me think they do n't believe everyone should have a right to own a gun either . 
  there 's no country in the world where discrimination among people does n't exsist . 
  i have also noticed a superiority vibe in his comments . 
  it 's best to ignore him . 
  i have never heard people reciting bible verses or mentioning god in everyday life like they do in the us . 
  i think majority of church goers have never even read the bible . 
  years ago here was a case of a family wanting to home school their kids because they did n't agree with public school system and wanted to teach them bible stuff . 
  people were enraged . 
  but what exactly counts as christian conservative over there ? 
  edit : [ this group of people ] ( https://www.facebook.com/za-otroke-gre-646841078755940/ ) can be considered christian conservatives i guess . 
  they mostly fight againts gay people 's right to adopt . 
  mostly with lies . 
  exactly . 
  countries he cycled through are n't exactly known for their human rights records . 
  yea , i guess shop owners can always claim they just like toads . 
  i still think something needs to be done about it . 
  lol if you 're that guy that someone linked in another post that cycled from netherlands to singapore , that 's a bit weird comming from you . 
  how is that legal ? 
  why do n't local authorities do something about it ? 
  i think it 's quite terrible : /, 
  iud is free here . 
  that 's all i know . 
  not sure if it would be free for someone not from slovenia . 
  i think it depends on your insurance company , if they 're willing to pay for it . 
  i know an italian woman had an abortion here a few months ago because it was past xx weeks that they allow in italy , but whether she had to pay or not , i do n't know . 
  edit : i do n't know how national insurance works in italy , but over here if it 's not free here , they 're not gon na pay for you to have it done somewhere else . 
  if the treatment is not available but there are other options with same results , they 're not gon na pay . 
  if the treatment is not available here and it 's crucial for your well being , they 're gon na pay . 
  so if italian national insurance is anything like ours , you 're out of luck . 
  but iud is not expensive anyway . 
  some schools offer it as a 3rd foreign language among others like french , spanish and italian . 
  i noticed some schools , especially elementary schools are now also offering chinese or japanese . 
  not a lot , a few . 
  when i enrolled to high school i actually signed up for a `` russian class '' which ment we 'd get russian as a 3rd foreign language instead of informatics in 2nd year . 
  idk what happened , but we did n't get it at the end . 
  russian is not very popular . 
  most that decide to learn it , learn it for business reasons . 
  as for your side question , as a holiday destination , not popular at all . 
  never heard anyone say they 're going to russia for holidays . 
  backpacking through russia is more popular , especially transiberian railway , but i think caucasus and - stan countries are more popular . 
  looks similar yes . 
  eastern part in slovenia has traditional potato \u017eganci , called d\u00f6doli . 
  but they 're not made like strapachka . 
  she 's played by keisha castle-hughes , i remember her from whale rider . 
  no idea what that is , it looks just like polenta . 
  also , blood sausages are found in lots of countries . 
  they 're just made of different ingredients . 
  i think most countries use pig blood but they use different grain . 
  some use rice , some barley , some buckwheat ... 
  mislim , da je [ tole ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/@46.2417925,15.2643143,3a,75y,5.51h,77.41t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s6ecoklnfjavdnnxuc41ncg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) . 
  we eat those in `` sour soup '' and `` obara '' . 
  my fave would be [ krvavica , pur\u00e9e and shreded turnip ] ( http://s8.mojalbum.com/11876578_17508889_19384399/kosilo-2/kisla-repa-pire-krompir-krvavice.jpg ) . 
  i also like mushroom soup and [ \u017eganci ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=%c5%beganci&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewivt9ub1knnahvblcakhvz3cgwq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643 ) and [ \u0161truklji ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=%c5%a1truklji&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiqh72x1knnahuldsakhqapbjcq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643#imgrc=_ ) . 
  polenta is italian , not romanian , made in many countries . 
  i would disagree with poor condition of our cycling paths . 
  have you seen it in other countries ? 
  there may not be as good and as plenty as those in denmark and netherlands but are far from bad . 
  they are a copy-paste denmark model . 
  as for lack of daily cyclers - it 's kind of difficult to cycle to work every day when you live quite a few km 's from the city with plenty of hills inbetween . 
  slovenia has a more rural population than a lot of other countries , which means cycling to work is not really an option . 
  how do you distinguish between a responsible person and a responsible person that will one day suddenly go ku-ku and shoot a bunch of people ? 
  apple , kitchenaid , blendtec , weber , timberland , carhartt , the north face , ralph lauren , tommy hilfiger , levi 's ... 
  what 's `` germanic '' about estonia ? 
  `` sunny side of alps '' ( though it 's more like rainy , foggy and stormy side of alps ) and `` hidden gem/pearl '' . 
  armenia and france have a long relationsghip . 
  a lot of armenians if france and a lot of armenians in lebanon . 
  sure , waiting lines are long for non-emergencies but 'm pretty satisfied so far . 
  i had bell 's palsy and had to stay in a hospital for a week , got shots , pills , facial massage , electro-therapy , all daily and was completely fine in a bit over a week . 
  while in other countries ( canada and us that i know of ) you get pretty much no treatment at all and many are left with a permanent droopy face . 
  chicken laws ? 
  does any country have chicken laws ? 
  lol ? 
  i live in an apartment building in a city and people who live in a house next to my building have chickens . 
  yea , but i never heard anyone calling the rest of the bosnians '' \u0160vedi '' .
