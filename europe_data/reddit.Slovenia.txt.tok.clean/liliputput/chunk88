  what ? 
  never heard . 
   why is that ? 
  no idea , it 's always been like that . 
  probably because at 26 you 're expected to have a job which would mean you ca n't attend full time classes . 
  though with high youth unemployment today , that 's often not the case . 
  part time classes are usually organised end of the week/weekend if there 's enough people that enroll . 
  and it 's a bit more flexible than full time . 
  but if you enroll when you 're 25 , you can study full time even after you turn 26 . 
  also , parents are obliged to financially support you if you study full time until you turn 26 beacause they receive `` parental allowance '' . 
   so how many hours a week would you say are spent in class and how many working on homework ? 
  no idea about this either . 
  it probably depends on the programme . 
  i 'd say it would be anywhere between 30-40 . 
  it also depends on professors . 
  some do n't really care if you attend their class or not and some wo n't let you take an exam if your attendance is n't 90 % or higher . 
  practical classes , lab etc. 
  are usually obligatory . 
  there 's really no homework . 
  you have to do an occasional project , essay , reflection etc. 
  but it all differes from professor to professor , programme to programme ... 
  no , it 's quite important here . 
  most undergrad are 3 year courses . 
  some are 4 ( law and special ed for example ) some are 5 ( pharmacy ) and some are 6 ( veterinary and medicine ) . 
  full time study is free , part time costs around 2500 $ - 4000 $ for 1 school year . 
  some programmes * are not available to study part time . 
  you can repeat a year or change programme once . 
  if you fail more than once , or want to change programme more than once , you have to take a break for a year or enroll part time . 
  if you decide to start studying after you turn 26 , you can only study part time . 
  you ca n't choose between courses ( there are some electives though , depending on faculty and programme ) . 
  each programme comes with a list of core-curriculum courses you have to do each year . 
  you need 60ects ( credit points ) to complete a year . 
  every course is asigned ects 's depending on how much study time you need to master it . 
  1 credit point = 25 - 30 hours of studying . 
  edit : one school year is 2 semesters . 
  we have exams at the end of each semester . 
  we have a month study break at the end of each semester and that 's when most of the exams are . 
  some courses may have aditional small tests during the semester , but most just have one big exam at the end of a semester . 
  some have both oral and written and some just oral/written . 
  if you did n't manage to pass the exams in those two exam breaks , there 's also an exam period at the end of august and september . 
  you usually can take one exam 3 times . 
  after that , you need to write a request to the commision . 
  edit2 : since everyone is describing student life , i 'll add it as well . 
  over here you can choose between living in a student dorm or renting a room/apartment . 
  student dorm rents are subsidised and range from around 55 $ - 120 $ per month . 
  there are various kinds . 
  older students , special need students can get a single room in a student apartment but most rooms are shared between 2 . 
  usually there are 3 rooms per apartment . 
  one apartment shares a kitchen and a bathroom . 
  there 's a special dorm for student families with little kids . 
  you can rent an apartment or a room privately . 
  you can get a subsidy for that as well , as well as a higher social support/higher scholarship if you write that adress as your permanent address ( not really sure how this goes ) . 
  most of the times , people rent rooms that are rented specifically to students . 
  as a full time student you also get other benefits such as subsidised meals . 
  that means you can get really cheap meals in most of the restaurants around multiple towns ( prices range from free to around 4,5 $ ) . 
  for example , mcdonalds - any kind of burger/tortilla/mcnuggets 6/chicken 3 + fries + drink + salad + apple for 2,07 $ . 
  it 's completely normal to have a dryer . 
  i live in an apartment so it gets way to hot in the summer to use a dryer , even with an air-con . 
  we have clothes drying ropes on the balcony and a foldable wall thing in the bathroom . 
  we could also use that clothes horse thing people already posted but there 's currently no need . 
  people who live in houses usually have something like [ this ] ( http://www.makom.si/images/product/large/132800.jpg ) outside . 
  we learned more about the mayans , incas and aztecs than north american natives . 
  not much . 
  just basic things . 
  these things are mostly covered by projects . 
  i turned it off midway through . 
  it was just so boring and pompous . 
  only a few carriages are gendered in japan . 
  and that 's only in rush hour . 
  i only seen it once during my 2 month stay there . 
  no , no one cares about it here . 
  we heve seperate restrooms for men and women and unisex restrooms for disabled people . 
  i do n't think anyone would give it more than a second thought if a male walked into womens toilet or vice versa . 
  except in a petrol station because people are just a bit more sketchy there . 
  i really do n't know why this is an issue in the states . 
  yes . 
  a lot of schools , bot not all . 
  they do n't `` give '' it . 
  they do n't get to keep them . 
  i doubt they do in denmark . 
  but it 's free to use while they 're enrolled in that school . 
  a certain parliamentary party wanted to buy tablets for each and every elementary student in the country . 
  that 's around 205.000 . 
  obviously they 're delusional . 
  [ we children of bahnhof zoo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdied1sl0m0 ), 
  not being able to differentiate between chinese/japanese/koreans . 
  they all look very different to me . 
  even the way they dress is a lot of times different . 
  it 's like saying spaniards and swedes look the same . 
  no , just way too long . 
  it 's kind of fun though . 
  like a big , long festival . 
  accompanied by flag waiving * , cheering , coordinated clothes and all . 
   le chat , le chien why ? 
  hi tommy and sam !, 
  or max and sam . 
  or max and tommy .
