  alright , so i gathered data from different sites because there are no official numbers for slovenia . 
  according to these sites 57 % of people have a pet . 
  25 % of these have more than one pet . 
  more family members = higher probabilty they have a pet . 
  70 % of at least 4 member families have at least one pet . 
  in 2011 there were 223.260 registered dogs . 
  which is quite a bit more than children til age 9 . 
  there are most probably more cats then dogs ( outdoor farm cats ) but i do n't know the number . 
  other popular pets are fish , birds , hamsters , quinea pigs , rabbits . 
  those kind of animals no idea about names . 
  rex was a very popular name for dogs especially german shepherds years ago ( after kommissar rex ) . 
  also lord , piki/pika ( spot ) , ta\u010dek / ta\u010dka ( paw ) , aron , max , floki , \u010capi ( chappy ) , medo ( bear ) , ben , ron/rona , ajka , lajka ... 
  i think people are more original with names nowadays . 
  pretty much everyone in slovenia who lives in a house or has a weekend house/cottage . 
  there are things like [ this ] ( http://www.sensa.si/media/cache/upload/photo/2011/05/05/vrticki_lightbox_image.jpg ) in every city for those who live in apartments . 
  you can buy or rent a small property and have a garden there . 
  i live in an apartment and have a small `` garden '' on my balcony . 
  i grow herbs , tomatoes and chillies . 
  my family has a weekend house where we have a field and a garden . 
  we grow corn , beans , peas , tomatoes , potatoes , peppers , onion , garlic , celery , carrots , eggplants , cucumber , different kinds of squashes , herbs , cabbage , spinach , various kinds of salad , brussel sprouts , broccoli , kale , okra , asparagus etc. 
  naah , no stigma here in slovenia . 
  pretty much every village has it 's own dialect and it 's almost impossible to get rid of the accent without a coach . 
  even some public figures speak with an accent , it 's part of a regional identity . 
  far eastern part , by the border with hungary , has such a different dialect that we need subtitles to understand them . 
  edit : [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5ivxc6f5ta ) is a radio show that talks about slovene dialects in this episode . 
  there 's a mistake though , there 's 48-50 official major dialects ( the number is way way higher when you start counting minor dialects ) , not 32 as he said . 
  for the last sentence he said to ask a slovenian to translate , i only understand '' ... . too much ... . . 
  hurts . '', 
  slovenia : it 's automatic . 
  no need for an accountant . 
  mark twain is often on the lists of `` home reading '' books in elementary schools in slovenia . 
  everyone knows tom sawyer and huckleberry finn . 
  poe is also known . 
  others are not well known except for moby dick . 
  very similar to what we have to read in slovenia . 
  a bunch of classics . 
  slovenia there are general guidlines but schools/teachers can choose between a few choices . 
  for `` obligatory home reading '' we had to do : * stories from the bible * sophocles - oedipus the king/antigone * linhart - ta veseli dan ali mati\u010dek se \u017eeni * cervantes - don quixote/shakespeare - hamelt/romeo and juliet/king lear * pre\u0161eren - krst pri savici * kersnik - jara gospoda/jur \u010di\u010d - deseti brat * tav\u010dar - viso\u0161ka kronika/cvetje v jeseni * dostoyevsky - crime and punishment/flaubert - madame bovary/tolstoy - war and peace * oscar wilde - saloma/chekhov - cherry orchard * cankar - na klancu/martin ka\u010dur * cankar - hlapci/za narodov blagor * od preglja do kosma\u010da * grum - dogodek v mestu gogi * sartre - no exit/camus - stranger some of other works we were taught about in school , full or excerpts : * homer - iliad/odyssey * vergil - aeneid * sappho , catullus , horace * dante alighieri - divine comedy * petrarca , buonarotti * boccaccio - the decameron * tobia lionelli * folk poetry * eduard peti\u0161ka - ancient greek myths and legends * moliere - tartuffe , the imaginary invalid , the misanthrope * jenko - tilka * goethe - the sorrows of young werther * byron - childe harold 's pilgrimage * pushkin - eugene onegin * lermontov - parus * leopardi - * heine - lorelai * zola - l'assommoir * gogol - the overcoat , dead souls * stendhal - red and black * honore de balzac - pere goriot * strindeberg - miss julie * ibsen - nora * gogol - the inspector general * garcia lorca * proust - combray * joyce - ulysess * kafka - transformation * thomas mann - death in venice * vladimir bartol - alamut/al araf * ionesco , beckett , garcia marquez , szymborska * france pre\u0161eren , kette , murn , cankar , zupan\u010di\u010d , gradnik , kosovel , grum , pregelj , pre\u017eihov voranc , kranjec , kajuh , hieng , smole and a lot of other slovene poets/writers / ... * and others then in 4th year , we have prep for final exams . 
  books we have to read are diffent each year . 
  this year they have to read tostoy - anna karenina and feri lain\u0161\u010dek - lo\u010dil bom peno od valov . 
  in the past they had to read stuff like nathalie sarraute - childhood , durrenmatt - the physicists , ibsen - the pillars of society , etc. . . and of course , a bunch of slovene works . 
  for english final exam we just had easy books . 
  that year we had the curious incident of the dog in the nightime , look back in anger and some poems . 
  i know nowadays the have to read the catcher in the rye . 
  yea , libetarianism . 
  need to google the difference between libertarianism and classical liberalism . 
  i guess libertarianism is a new form of classical liberalism ? 
  that 's not being `` liberal '' . 
  liberalism is based on equality . 
  they 're the oposite of that . 
  edit : oh , you 're talking about classical liberalism ? 
  as in `` liberty '' ? 
  no need to be a dicky . 
  i misunderstood you . 
  simple as that . 
  way to liberal ? 
  i do n't like that you 're overly nice . 
  it just seems so fake . 
  and that you 're so proud of the us . 
  i mean it 's nice to be proud of your country , you should be , but you 're just over the top . 
  we definitely get hard pasta in slovenia but we cook sauce from scratch . 
  except maybe tomato sauce , we buy that . 
  or in the summer we make batches from home grown tomaties . 
  yes ? 
  every day ? 
  sometimes we 'll order a pizza or something else for dinner . 
  it 's more common for students to eat outside as we have subsidized student meals . 
  i mean eating outside is not a luxury ( it would be if you ate outside everyday ! ), 
  as you can get really good food for a good price here but we usually eat outside on special occasions , when we meet our friends or when we go on a day trip . 
  rarely will we go eat outside just for the sake of it or because we 're too lazy to cook at home . 
  there are other kinds of hedgehog in europe than a western european one . 
  southern white-breasted hedgehog and northern white-breasted hedgehog . 
  a part of my country is coloured green , i live in the grey part and we have all three breeds of hedgehog that live in europe . 
  you 'll see plenty of dead hedgehogs on the roads and plenty of live ones in the gardens . 
  so hedgehogs can be find everywhere in europe . 
  it 's getting more and more popular in apartment buildings in slovenia , not as much in houses , as heatwaves in the 30 's are not uncommon anymore . 
  slovenia - apart from mandatory health and retirenment and disability insurance : * extra health insurance ( for things that are n't covered by national health insurance . 
  pretty much everyone has this . 
  it 's free for unemployed people , kids and students . 
  it costs around 25 $ a month if i 'm not mistaken . 
  * car insurance ( mandatory by law ) * buildings/home insurance * extra travel insurance ( insurance in case of emergency in eu , egp , australia and some other european countries is covered by national health insurance ) those are the ones almost everyone has . 
  then there are some others . 
  * accident insurance ( mandatory for schoolchildren . 
  old people usually have this too . ), 
  * insurance in case of unexpected death . 
  * extra resort treatment insurance ( you have a right of spa treatment after injury or specific disease that is covered by national health insurance . 
  usually 1 - 3 weeks . 
  how much depends on your injury / disease . 
  this insurance gives you a longer treatment . 
  * credit insurance * liability insurance * crops insurance * animal insurance * extra retirenment and disability insurance ( plenty of people have this one too . ), 
  i wo n't ever forget sitting infront of a hostel in the middle of london when a fox casually walks past us . 
  is there a border between `` eastern '' and `` western '' europe or why do you think there would n't be any hedgehogs in the `` eastern '' part ? 
  brown bear , wolves , lynx , boar , deer , hare , beaver , doormouse , jackal , fox , wildcat , otter , stoat , weasel , polecat , ibex , chamois , hedgehogs , frogs , dolphins etc. . . normal kinds of animals . 
  bears are commonly seen near and even in villages , there was even a bear in a central park in the capital . 
  we 're a family of 4 and have 3 cars . 
  it 's not a luxury but it 's expensive . 
  2 cars per family is the norm . 
  old couples usualy have 1 car between the two . 
  most people live in the countryside so it 's a necessity . 
  very strong in slovenia .
