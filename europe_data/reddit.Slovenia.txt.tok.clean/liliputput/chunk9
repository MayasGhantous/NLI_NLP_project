  it 's usually eaten for dinner . 
  is it something that can be brought from germany to slovenia or does it have to be eaten fresh ? 
  i have some germany family in essen and i want to ask them to bring it to me . 
   baumkuchen that looks goood !, 
  what is it ? 
  eee no , it 's eaten all over ex-empire . 
  i just had it for dinner today . 
  have you seen powerty in the us ? 
  are you sure you have that in hungary ? 
  homeless kids , living in tents ? 
  coz we sure do n't . 
  they should mind their own business . 
  they have nothing to do with europe . 
  surely that has to be the case with most countries . 
  it 's 2017 . 
  that 's why this question is so odd , beside the fact that a handfull of people would be so interested in tax return forms to know what they look like in other countries . 
  nothing will beat the tax return one . 
  i was confused for a while after reading that question . 
  i think the problem why people react negatively and have a perception of overdiagnosis is because people just self diagnose themselves . 
  if you ever read youtube commens you see people throw diagnoses around like it 's nothing . 
  child does n't speak much at age 3 ? 
  child runs around ? 
  adhd !, 
  you like to organise your stuff ? 
  ocd !, 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  official diagnosis is credible and should be respected . 
  i do n't know how it is elsewhere , but it 's difficult to get a diagnosis here and i 'm sure it 's the same elsewhere in europe . 
  i know this does n't answer your question but i just wanted to throw this in . 
   if those picked someone the results would look much different . 
  i hope so !, 
  i honestly do n't think those polls have any credibility . 
  at least i hope so . 
  who in their right mind would support him ? 
  i feel like they only ask old people . 
  do you know anyone who has been questioned for one of these polls ? 
  i sure do n't . 
   rihannaland imagine an island full of rihanna clones . 
  i love rihanna . 
  she 's one beautiful woman . 
  we are the main exporter of non-eu workers in eu . 
  i am pretty sure you can brand most of them as slave workers , they all get paid shit . 
  we issue work permits to pretty much everyone who asks . 
  more often than not , subcontractors in slovenia are non-eu foreigners themselves . 
  i have no idea if it 's so easy to open a business for foreigners here or what . 
  i did n't get much into grammar , but for basic understanding of conversations it was n't hard to get into . 
  i also studied a bit of japanese in high school which has sov structure i think . 
  slovene has svo but it 's very flexible . 
  i used to have some e-pals from philippines and picked up tagalog/taglish . 
  did n't really learn it as i did n't put any effort in it but it 's probably one of the easiest languges ever and super easy to pick up . 
  i never tried speaking it , but understanding written conversations was very easy . 
  it is a thing with me :p realistically , i 'm never gon na move . 
  if janez jan\u0161a ever wins elections , i 'm moving . 
  iceland maybe ? 
  scotland ? 
  some little greek island ? 
  no , never . 
  trailers usually . 
  cars like [ this ] ( http://media.citroen.si/image/65/6/mosaique_variantes_face_xtr_berlingo_multispace.196656.159.jpg ) are also popular in slovenia . 
  citroen berlingo specifically . 
  they 're mostly used as family cars but it 's easy to transport bigger things as well . 
  i 'm proud of my countrymen and their achievements . 
  we excell in a lot of fields considering our size . 
  speciffically in sport . 
  one of the top news on rtvslo.si right now is taborniki ( scouts ) taking a shelter in a fire station during a storm yesterday ... 
  mashed potatoes with schnitzel ?? 
  who cooks for you ? 
  baked yes , that 's probably more common as french fries at home . 
  but in a restaurant it 's usually fries . 
  i like lara gut , that 's it . 
  probably schnitzel and french fries . 
  oh yeah , i do n't doubt that at all . 
  i 've been to greece before . 
  the other user was pretty appalled by the fact that kids would see boobs and ` learn about sex ' too young . 
  there was a greek redditor some time ago that insisted it 's not ok for women to go topless in greece . 
  women going topless is completely ok here . 
  full nudity probably not so much . 
   lars is swedish and holidaying in spain . 
  he took his id card issued by a bank with him - in sweden , it 's accepted as proof of identity . 
   but lars could get into trouble if the spanish authorities want to check his identity , because the only valid id documents they recognise are national id cards and passports issued by the swedish authorities . 
  i do n't think so . 
   pesek = doggie uh , no , i 'm pretty sure it 's damjan [ p\u00e9sek ] ( http://www.prevozklemen.com/media/images/pesek-za-dvorisce.jpg ) , not [ p\u00e8sek ] ( http://www.aler.si/modules/uploader/uploads/news/pictures_news/kit.jpg ) . 
  edit : or not , idk . 
  but i have never heard of p\u00e8sek as a last name . 
  edit 2 : i was trying to find a video to see if his last name is ` doggy ' or ` pebbles ' but could n't find it . 
  found [ photos - warning !, 
  graphic ] ( http://www.zurnal24.si/galleries/gallery-55803/?page=1 ) . 
   it 's good enough for airports and other border controls within schengen . 
  [ it 's not ] ( http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/entry-exit/eu-citizen/index_en.htm ) . 
  only valid documents for travelling in eu are id cards and passports . 
  whales and sharks can be seen in scotland as well . 
  great white sharks and whales have been seen in the adriatic quite a few times . 
  edit : [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-zeno0747s ) a humpback whale named janez in piran bay and [ a whale shark ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otxaqnr69ds ) . 
  edit 2 : of course i would n't plan a trip to the adriatic to watch whales and sharks , they 're not that common . 
  edit 3 : there are 30 species of sharks in the adriatic . 
  there was a great white shark attack near vis , croatia in 2009 . 
  it 's not negative at all . 
  but it 's not positive either . 
  it results into very non-practical when you have to cross the border , does n't it ? 
  do n't you have a wallet with a bunch of slots to stick your cards in ?
