yeah communism , lenin , stalin here no good , literally hell . 
  move on . 
  maybe they should ship them to usa, 
  there will be almost more refugees then slovenes anytime soon then, 
  there can only be west-east to divide rich regions from poor regions / s, 
  why would serb sing this tho ? 
  dude , look at some facts before you start writing nonsense in threads . . 
  here it goes again . . gib back trst, 
  soon the albanians will overtake everyone here if it goes the same way, 
  / thread, 
  kurba + some serbo-croatian curses, 
  our flag is basically flag of [ carniola ] ( https://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/kranjska ) with coat of arms on it . 
  i think they have n't heard of spanish reconquista and inquisition, 
  i 'd say austria and croatia , maybe czech rep. and hungary too . 
  that austro-hungary empire tho, 
  i think it 's fine because there are lots of forests and hills nearby so you can just hike there and chillax , but yeah city really looks depressing, 
  slovenia the only correct one, 
  count in kounigsberg, 
  that 's just awkward, 
  yeah we really are bastards, 
  oh thank you for explaining . 
  are turkish nationalists = neo-ottomanists or is this different ? 
  slovenia breaking the curtain, 
  how can we take care of refugees if we ca n't take care of our own people ? 
  at least we gave you the minority stauts . 
  there ai n't a sign of slovene minority in trieste officially ( i may be wrong , but last time i checked there was n't any ) so please . 
  edit : my bad , trst has official slovene minority, 
   my ancestors would probably spit on me , but fuck them , they 're dead . 
  european country ? 
  same in slovenia , most people choose german and the minority picks french, 
  yeah , i read somewhere that he had a special hate for poles so that would just salt the wound . 
  he would be mad as hell . 
  i 'd tell bismarck that in the future , poland would have most of the eastern prussia . 
  same goes for slovenia , mostly worn by younger generations . 
  i am slovene , so i got ta say janez . 
  trst - never forget . 
  just a bit of southern part , but most is not in balkan . 
  so you think slovenia should be part of the balkan ? 
  well they can still do the same thing what russians did back then . 
  but then ww3 starts, 
  well yeah some are just dumb and nationalistic , but most that i met are actually very nice . 
  at least where i 'm from . 
  what what the fuck ? 
  * why not slovene ? 
  restore former holy roman empire and expand it ? 
  niiice . 
  the colors come from historical region called [ carniola ( kranjska ) ] ( http://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/kranjska ) . 
  those colors were before that pan-slavic thing . 
  and make the country look like [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_of_greater_austria ), 
  what about slovenia ? 
  * puppy eyes *, 
  slovenia stronk once again, 
  more like illyrian kingdom , yeah ? 
  but but , slovene history . . carantania & carniola stronnk and relevant, 
  1453 never forget too ? 
  amm hello ? 
  oh the mighty triglav, 
  emperor city more like it . 
  gib constantinople back !, 
  but really , your kebab is very delicous . 
  it is , it 's just that you sound like a neo-nazi with all the race thingy thing . 
  inb4 italy not in western europe anymore, 
  people just do n't know that much of yugoslavia 's communism so they 're just putting it in the same basket as soviet union : /, 
  yugoslavia never was behind the iron curtain . . 
  1593 best day m8 , [ here 's why ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_sisak ) edit : slovene people into relevance !, 
  constantinople , never forget, 
  fine , we take gorica, 
  first part is awesome , it talks about our pagan ancestors resisting christians and battling them . 
  preety awesome if you ask me . 
  [ we have ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_baptism_on_the_savica ), 
  what does spain have to do with this ? 
  oh damn croatia , maybe we have one . 
  richer than poortugal ^ / s edit : butthurt downvotes lol ? 
  seeing many minorities , this map lacks slovene minority in austria then, 
  conquest = / = colonization and it does n't show colonization inside hre, 
  and i forgot neanderthal mb, 
  slavic maybe https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/principality_of_lower_pannonia, 
  as someone said here , austria have 3 traditional minorities . 
  slovenes in southern carinthia and croats and hungarians in burgenland . 
  when jorg haider was alive he was strictly against bilingual sings in carinthia and he was removing them and he made some tensions . 
  ironically enough he died in a car crash under sign . 
  after that carinthians got signs back , where minority is greater then 10 % i think, 
  rip bilingual signs in carinthia ? 
  there 's a difference that those german turks immigrated and choose germany meanwhile armenians did n't have the same option in ottoman empire . 
  yeah i think that `` windisch '' was born after ww1 when carinthian slovenes wanted to distance themselves from slovenes . 
  and sorry but these people in videos make me sick . 
  yeah haider was a dick-head . 
  about slovene speaking territory , i think that 100 years back that was more or less slovene speaking territory , klagenfurt may have been more german then slovene tho, 
  many slovenians have surnames of german origin , it 's nothing weird here , but they 're mostly adjusted to our alphabet . 
  epic song with epic background story, 
  i think he 's greek, 
  not if we anschluss it, 
  martin krpan , peter klepec , ... and the great general maister !, 
  got ta love bajadera , they 're so good . 
  this was made about 100 years ago , you have to take that in account, 
  triest and klagenfurt to carniola and the dream is real, 
  celtic stronk !, 
  this is sad , do you know who might be behind the attack ? 
  which organisation ? 
  i do n't know where you live , but from where i come from we have some great historical heritage to be proud of .
