  men do have lots of advantages , i never denied that . 
  however so do women . 
  you have however failed to mention that part though and have just been concentrating on how bad the poor women have it . 
   maybe some day you 'll be strong enough to acknowledge that you received some unfair advantages in life . 
  it 's not your fault no one is blaming you , just accept the damn facts this is why people , including a majority of women , are not feminists . 
  the patronizing , self congratulating , holier than thou sense of superiority over the unenlightened that a lot of you have . 
  seriously , if feminists sexists attitudes were n't driving people away from it , the self righteousness of their advocates surely would . 
   those women would n't even be working if it was n't for feminists whining fighting for their rights . 
  well mission accomplished in that case . 
  why is it still around then ? 
  seems awfully unnecessary . 
  or maybe they didnt like me because they are sexists and i called them out on their hypocrisy in regards to a of issues , i mean who can tell , it 's not like i was there so you probably know better what went on right ? . 
  oh please , you ( since you seem to be a feminist ) talk about toxic parts of masculinity when it comes to people telling jokes to each other . 
  it 's almost impossible to anything without it being labelled as toxic masculinity . 
  to clarify , its not talking about womens issues that i had an issue with it was that when he talked he game a distinct impression of grovelling . 
  i dont care who it is or what they are talking about , if they suck up and self flagellate as much as he did i lose all respect of them . 
  i 'll freely admit i discriminate against people with no spine . 
  now , i did n't watch the video you posted because i do n't have 45 minutes to waste so i 'll allow for the chance that it 's different than the other one i watched but i doubt his character and demeanour changed between the two recordings . 
  yes , quite often actually . 
  maybe it 's a bit self centered but i just have such a pleasant sounding voice i can not help myself . 
  it 's just that good . 
  dont give reddit too much credit , i 've dealt with enough feminists in real life before i ever heard of reddit to know i want nothing to do with them or it . 
  i try not to align myself with sexists movements so if i have to define myself in this regard i prefer to say i 'm egalitarian , not a feminist . 
  and yes that guy , i think i 've seen his tedx talk , very painful to watch . 
  kept wondering why , when they took away his balls they did n't show mercy and finish him off right there and then instead of letting him go on trough life as a cuckold . 
  very sad . 
  i like it how you define sexism as a `` collection of attitudes that deride anything feminine '' yet you fail to include a mention of a collection of attitudes that deride anything masculine . 
  i should have been more clear , i do n't think women are whining and refusing to do anything , i think feminists are whining and refusing to do anything . 
  this and feminism being the most successful social movement ever can be true at the same time . 
  anecdotally i know plenty of hard working and successful women , none of whom wants to touch feminism with a 10 metre pole . 
  the reason why they are successful today is that they did n't bitch and moan about how tough they have it , they worked harder and better than everyone else so today they get their partnerships and management positions . 
  for what its worth , feminism has already won , in what we could loosely define as the west , women are equal . 
  and considering that for any disadvantages remaining women today have plenty of advantages to balance those out i fully reject your claim that men ( leaving aside your unnecessary inclusion of race ) have it generally easier in life than women . 
  seems like a pretty open and shut case if it would actually be brought in front of a court . 
  if it isnt it just leads me to think that there has to be a good explanation for it and that it just isnt being accounted for . 
  it it so easy . 
  if someone thinks that they have great ideas but arent able to put them forward because they are not the part of an old boys club , there is nothing stopping them from forming their own club to try and get those ideas trough . 
  with a majority of the voting block potentially on your side it would be foolish to not take take those ideas straight to the people . 
  show some leadership , go out on your own and build something new if the old is broken as you see it . 
  and the world not being fair is the exact reason women should just try harder . 
  the time they spend complaining about how someone should help them out so they can get ahead is the time someone else is spending actually doing work that will get them ahead . 
  true , these days they just want to \\ #killallmen but at least they arent blatantly racist any more . 
  if breaking trough existing parties is tough there is always an option of forming their own party . 
  we have a new party here almost every election and they do reasonably well ( better then some well established interest parties ) . 
  saying that there are too few female leaders because breaking to the front of the pack is hard is no excuse . 
  and then there were those that were holding campaigns to [ shame men into enlisting ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_feather ) . 
   t 's weird to suggest that the eu is somehow biased against men when most of it 's leaders are men !, 
  we should probably give women the right to vote then so that they can vote all the men out of leadership positions . 
   it is better to ran according to the limit than run over a child . 
  agreed . 
  though at the speed limit the more expensive car is much safer for everyone involved so the prudent safety measure should surely be to lower the speed limit for the cheap cars . 
  in the interest of safety of course , would n't want any children to get hurt . 
  since they are probably driving better and safer cars it does make sense . 
  slovenian serbo-croatian english german french ( poorly ) and once i get my french up to a decent level , i 'm going to start on russian . 
  shit that 's right . 
  i guess subconsciously i still have n't gotten over the switch from v10s to v8s . 
  but yeah , i meant that turbo v6s sound like ass . 
  probably still sounded better than the new v8s . 
  [ banana equivalent dose ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banana_equivalent_dose ) ( not joking )  a banana equivalent dose ( abbreviated bed ) is an informal expression of ionizing radiation exposure , intended as a general educational example to indicate the potential dose due to naturally occurring radioactive isotopes by eating one average sized banana . 
  one bed is often taken as 0.1 \u00b5sv , however , in practice this dose is not cumulative as the principal radioactive component is excreted to maintain metabolic equilibrium . 
  the bed is only an indicative concept meant to show the existence of very low levels of natural radioactivity within a natural food , and is not a formally adopted dose quantity . 
   for example , the radiation exposure from consuming a banana is approximately 1 % of the average daily exposure to radiation , which is 100 banana equivalent doses ( bed ) . 
  the maximum permitted radiation leakage for a nuclear power plant is equivalent to 2,500 bed ( 250 \u03bcsv ) , while a chest ct scan delivers 70,000 bed ( 7 msv ) . 
  a lethal dose of radiation treatment is approximately 80,000,000 bed ( 8 sv ) . 
  a person living 10 miles from the three mile island nuclear reactor received 700 bed of exposure to radiation . 
  we need some new shit to go down anyway . 
  ever since the cold war ended spy movies have been shit . 
  a joke or a likely usage scenario . 
  i 've done the same things with batteries before , plugged them in , did n't check if i plugged them in properly and in the morning my phone is dead . 
  with a phone , it 's an inconvenience , with a car , well now i cant get to work . 
  slightly more serious . 
  and it came about because clarkson left and the show became too boring for bbc . 
  [ hello , and welcome to the big fat quiz of the 80s . 
  the 1980s are almost an unrecognisable decade , dominated by a divisive tory government , riots , strikes , unemployment , tension in the falkland islands , and a royal wedding . 
  * so much has changed * ] ( https://youtu.be/d1jbstcvdrs?t=41s ), 
  how about [ these kind of people ] ( http://reason.com/blog/2014/12/16/profs-have-stopped-teaching-rape-law-now ) . 
  or as noted later in the article , these kind of people  safe spaces are an expression of the conviction , increasingly prevalent among college students , that their schools should keep them from being `` bombarded '' by discomfiting or distressing viewpoints . 
  with the above in mind . 
   emma hall , a junior , * rape survivor * and `` sexual assault peer educator '' who helped set up the room and worked in it during the debate , estimates that a couple of dozen people used it . 
  ** at one point she went to the lecture hall -- it was packed -- but after a while , she had to return to the safe space . 
  `` i was feeling bombarded by a lot of viewpoints that really go against my dearly and closely held beliefs , '' ms. hall said . 
  ** so apparently she is a `` rape survivor '' . 
  by her own admission she didnt retreat into a safe space because it reminded her of her trauma but because she was feeling bombarded by a lot of viewpoints that really go against her dearly and closely held beliefs . 
  i 'll repeat that . 
  she had to retreat into a room with cookies and play dough because she heard something that she disagrees with . 
  if a dissenting opinion triggers you , you 're not fit for a debate , college education , or adult life for that matter . 
  no , it says that the `` safe space '' is for ** anyone ** that found the ** debate ** too upsetting . 
  debate . 
  in university . 
  with university age people . 
  so upsetting that they need to retreat in a room with cookies and play dough . 
  [ nyt : in college and hiding from scary ideas ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/opinion/sunday/judith-shulevitz-hiding-from-scary-ideas.html ) a nyt op ed on a similar matter . 
  a choice quote from the article  the safe space , ms. byron explained , was intended to give people who might find comments `` troubling '' or `` triggering , '' a place to recuperate . 
  the room was equipped with cookies , coloring books , bubbles , play-doh , calming music , pillows , blankets and a video of frolicking puppies , as well as students and staff members trained to deal with trauma . 
  the future is in the hands of people with the emotional stability of two year olds . 
  nice , a portable stargate !, 
  slightly wider . 
  if someone that has studied anatomywould drop in and drop some hard numbers that would be great but until then ; between two adults of the same height and age , but one with a slightly wider bone here and there i doubt the difference in weight in their skeletons would be a couple of percent the most . 
  and if a couple of percent of your bone weight is enough to send you into overweight territory then that person was too fat in the first place and needed to lose some weight anyway . 
  that photo and all those complaints about mannequins .
