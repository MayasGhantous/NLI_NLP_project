   new people by the law but we are lacking nurses , doctors , policemans also , at least when it comes to doctors , some people do n't want to retire , so the young doctors could be employed . 
  or they do n't offer enough spots for students to specialize in certain sector . 
  media report we do not have anough doctors , but in reality goverment doesnt provide jobs for them . 
  they are selling our biggest companies to foregins at a very low price which is a big loss . 
  and our goverment does n't * know * how to improve the economy and lacks of business strategy . 
  that 's a big negative side . 
  i do n't think reforms had a big impact on the daily life . 
  i think they would be very offended if they hear they are labeled as pop group . 
  they are more in electronic-industrial-experiment genre . 
  it looks like in slovenia we almost do n't have dialects : / actually we do have them around 45 and a person from the west will have a lot of difficulties understanding someone from the east . 
  simple [ map ] ( http://www2.arnes.si/~gljsentvid10/oseb_stran/slovenian_dialects1.png ) of slo dialects, 
  someone posted a new link to data with new data . 
  we are already behind the czech republic .

  we like to think we are different , other nations/people disagree and try to prove us otherwise . 
  slovenia feels the same . 
  best tactic , i agree . 
  also wear what you wear in the desert . 
  god will help isis to achieve what 's best for them . 
   feminist logic . 
  we have a crazy feminazi in finland whose said that women who sleep with men are traitors to their gender ... 
  there is a big difference between feminist ( gender equality and mutual respect ) then feminazi who hate men . 
  i do not support them and they do n't anything good to society and relationship between genders . 
   they live in a rape culture ( in western countries , where such thing does not exist ) it does exist , especially in the usa [ photo ] ( http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/23/5/enhanced/webdr07/enhanced-28158-1411464589-2.png ) http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/a-third-of-male-university-students-say-they-would-rape-a-woman-if-there-no-were-no-consequences-9978052.html http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/10/28/york-university-hockey-teamtweets-on-rape-racism_n_6061228.html and many more . 
  read or follow everyday sexism ( there is also a good book on this ) and you will see things that happen in real , everyday life . 
  i would classify myself as a feminist , but i do n't see anything wrong here . 
  nobody forced her to do that . 
  what 's more natural than human body ? 
  i do n't see anything wrong with boobs on tv . 
   put a finger in her ass and vagina . 
  that is serious sexual assault . 
  also she can get genital disease ( not std ) , but infection due to whatever was in rapist hands . 
   court didnt deem that serious enough for jail time . 
  we have a big problem here . 
  no matter if it was finnish or somali or whatever , that is very serious . 
  it means they do n't understand you can not put fingers in a stranger 's ass/vagina if they did n't allow you to do that . 
  next time it will be full rape . 
  female , 24 , working in an office ( administrative work , accounting ) - net salary : 970 $ - bills ( mobile , insurance , parking ) : around 75 $ - gas : 30 $ - going out/food : 150 $ i live with my parents and they buy food for me . 
  i put rest of the money on the saving account , so i will buy an apartment next year . 
  spain , portugal , italy , greece , croatia , albania , montenegro , slovenia - south-west part, 
  what does - means ( for slovenia it 's -2.1 % ) ? 
  70 % central european 30 % balkan . 
  i think it was for graphic bienale or something similar involving art . 
  we had this in slovenia a couple years ago . 
  in many locations . 
  [ nsfw boobs ] ( http://irena.blog.siol.net/files/2009/09/boobies.jpg ), 
   the crime is called jaywalking we have high fines if you jaywalk too . 
  america is n't the only one where this is a crime . 
   are laws against physical aggression that fearsome ? 
  maybe he did n't want to hurt another person . 
  but why is it racists ? 
  i mean , i do n't have any trouble with the immigrants who respect the law . 
  also a lot of these immigrants are perfectly healthy young men who are capable of working . 
  except the ones from war zones ( which running away from that area is understandable ) , i think we could help them in africa by teaching them economy , how to run bussiness , etc , not just giving them food and money aid and guns . 
  that 's how africa could develop . 
  also trouble is many people come from countries where crime rates are high . 
  they wo n't change their mind or how to react when they live in west europe . 
  our 42 km of coast says otherwise . 
   but then this is true for any industry . 
  forcing women ( or men , children ) is far worse . 
  it does a lot more damage . 
  mental health problem and std . 
  also if a girl gets pregnant they are forced to get abortion ( many of them ) and have trouble later in life if they want to have children . 
  if they do have a child ... what about the child ? 
  where is he/she going to end ? 
  it 's really not that easy as if you would have to work in a factory or clean the house . 
  you know violating someone 's body in worse way and taking their dignity away . 
  some of these girls are very young . 
  also what if a girl is n't able to have sex and they force her to ? 
  it hurts like hell ... mar more than someone would slap you . 
  and then the social stigma , it 's far worse if someone is labeled as a whore/sex worker than ` was forced to work in a factory ' . 
   do n't tell them to stop claiming the illyrians as their ancestors , stupidity is strong with these ones . 
  i first hear of this one . 
  nobody claims we are 100 % , maybe that they lived here . 
  mostly people claim that we are venets or celts if they can not accept that we are slavs . 
  also hungary is not balkan . 
  bookdepositry.com no taxes free shipping , 
  catalans are far worse . 
  we call it ` french salad ', 
  dial\u00e9kti\u010dnomaterial\u00edsti\u010den - longest word ne , da , je , etc - shortest words , we have a lot of them ; also could be s/z , v , h/k, 
  that is true , but a lot of kids are overweight when they are younger and in their teenage years they lose weight . 
  i think we got the high score , because of older generations . 
  i rarely see fat young person, 
  which country ? 
  what kind of hairstyle is ' i like anal ' ? 
  i can not imagine anything . 
   i think grouping the entire plethora of offenses together does what you describe . 
  having degrees would change the argument to `` is it degree x of rape ? '', 
  from `` is it rape ? '' . 
  which is an improvement . 
  but that 's all rape . 
  there are no x degrees of rape . 
  if i say ` no ' , no matter what i wear , how much i drank , that means no . 
  it 's forced . 
   because lying to get laid should not be treated the same as spiking someones drink and having your way with their unconscious body . 
  well i agree with you . 
  she should check . 
  it 's not like she was bound , beaten etc. 
   are there different degrees of rape ? 
  in this story , i do n't think it would be called rape , more like sexual assult or scam to get sexual advances .
