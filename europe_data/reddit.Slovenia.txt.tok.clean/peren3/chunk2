  1 % change in the cpi or euro area 's hicp , is inflation . 
  disinflation is inflation going from 3 % to 1 % in a period of time . 
  it means that the inflation rate is going down . 
  deflation means a negative change in a price index , e.g. 
  a hicp of -0,2 % . 
  they 're all technical terms with well defined meaning . 
  no need to involve `` keynesianism '' or whatever . 
   and by the way , i do not see a problem with negative inflation , apparently we have managed to overcome the keynesian problem of `` stickiness of wages '' . 
  you are mistaken . 
  sticky wages is precisely the reason we see double digit unemployment in countries like greece and spain . 
  during a recession firms tend to lay off workers instead of lowering wages . 
  the state of eurozone unemployment is basically the empirical evidence sticky wages are a very real phenomenon . 
  see e.g. 
  truman bewley 's book - ` why wages do n't fall during a recession ' for answers as to why . 
  i do n't want to be pedantic , but asset values , which can have `` speculative value '' technically do not having anything to do with gdp , which is wages and profits , which is what the news is about . 
  not only that . 
  their [ plans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generalplan_ost#phases_of_the_plan_and_its_implementation ) did n't envision a bright future for the balts, 
  `` special zone established after ww2 '' what are you talking about . 
  it 's an oblast of the russian federation , it 's russian alright . 
  states can default ; default just means non-payment . 
  but there is no legal status of bankruptcy for them . 
  yeah , i know the feel , i do it too . 
  i buy on amazon.de , amazon.com and amazon.co.uk depending on the prevailing exchange rates lol, 
  it 's due to the exchange rate . 
  an euro was 1,4 dollars in 2014 or so . 
  now its around 1,1, 
  bankruptcy does n't even exist as a legal status for sovereign countries . 
  you can default all you want . 
  but people will still sue you 10 years later , like argentina recently settled their debts after it defaulted in 2001 . 
   what happened next , is that european banks got rid of the debt because they were rescued with european member-state money . 
  from that point on , greece owed this money to european member-states ( some would say tax-payers ) . 
  thats not what happened . 
  nobody wanted to loan greece anymore money and they would default to mainly to private creditors , pension funds and similar institutions across europe . 
  eurozone member states together with the imf then lent greece money via esfs , most of that money was used to repay the previous creditors and the rest to keep greece afloat while it reforms to become a functioning state . 
  noone needs to ask the imf for loans , it 's a voluntary institution . 
  if greece was n't mismanaged there would be no need for the imf to step in . 
  you 're way off mark with regards the imf . 
  it is them that want to haircut greek debt while the eurozone countries want to keep it as is with maybe lower interest rate . 
  it 's like that . 
  ministers and so on are there behind the speaker . 
  nominal/real distinction only makes sense when applied to growth rates , that is between two data points in time . 
  when comparing gdp levels at a single date , it 's incoherent . 
  maybe you mean gdp adjusted for purchasing power parity , you have a similar story : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00114&amp;plugin=1, 
  you 're wrong . 
  get any dataset for europe for say 1970-2000 . 
  [ e.g. 
  ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;idim=country:ita:fra:esp&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_kd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:ita:fra:esp:deu:gbr&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) italy started stagnating roughly a decade ago . 
  before that it was competing with france , uk and germany . 
  data collection of national accounts across the eu is standardized , it 's called esa 2010 . 
  eurostat has the same data as your statistical office , it is from there that eurostat gets the data in any case ; or any other entity , including imf . 
  so you ca n't really get better data than that . 
  garbage data . 
  it 's not true . 
  see : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00001&amp;plugin=1, 
  the red bar includes corporate taxes , which is a direct tax . 
  taxes on labour , the pink color in the pie charts , is not that different from western europe . 
  interesting , particularly the tltro 2 . 
  the borrowing conditions on tltro 2 being as low as the deposit facility means ecb might lend to banks at negative rates . 
  i believe no other central bank went negative with lending . 
  japan , switzerland and sweden are all only negative on the deposit facility , ie . 
  the banks ' cash at the central bank - the lending to the central bank . 
  which means banks will give back less than they borrowed from the ecb initially . 
  they need a new cartoon on their website , and replace the inflation monster with the deflation monster . 
  [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6pvx625jcs ), 
  '' ... decide the bank 's ** fiscal ** policies for the coming months ... '' the guy is clearly clueless , he does n't understand what the word fiscal means . 
  and he mixes tltro 's and qe , which are different . 
  shit article, 
  i do n't think roosevelt thought the soviets would be us ' enemy . 
  he had leftist leanings and was wary of the british , since the british empire was still a thing back then . 
  here 's a quote of how he thought about stalin :  i just have a hunch that stalin is not that kind of man . 
  harry [ hopkins ] says he 's not and that he does n't want anything except security for his own country , and i think that if i give him everything i possibly can and ask nothing from him in return , noblesse oblige , he wo n't try to annex anything and will work with me for a world of democracy and peace . 
  ecb 's is -0.3 % . 
  swedish riksbank is -0,5 % . 
  the point is anyway not about interest rates , but exchange rates vis-a-vis your trading partners . 
  while , say swedish , polish and czech currencies depreciated against the euro , and can float around depending on the strength of their economies the finnish one can not . 
  https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=hvn on this graph you have the finnish and swedish real exchange rate vis-a-vis germany . 
  you can clearly see where lies the problem . 
  i think 0 , since they 're not in the euro , and the esfs and esm are euro area institutions . 
  see : http://www.esm.europa.eu/about/governance/shareholders/index.htm, 
  ecb obviously . 
  surprised noone mentioned it . 
  central banks usually have to report to national parliaments , or finance ministries . 
  the fed reports to the congress . 
  some finance ministries , i think uk 's , specify their inflation targets . 
  new zealand finance minister , i believe , can sack the governor if he misses the inflation target set by the government and so on . 
  the ecb is responsible to noone , makes it 's rules as it goes along etc. 
  because afghanistan is n't a country in a state of war , like syria or iraq . 
  us flew their nuclear bombers in a similar fashion recently . 
  he sounds like he has genuine rhotacism . 
  these are forecasts, 
  they voted them the most : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/nsdap_wahl_1933.png, 
  i 've read . 
  the researchers in the video respond to the arguments by the committee . 
  the arguments seem pretty weak to me : https://estoniaevoting.org/press-release/response-national-election-committees-statement/ is there any other counterarguments , because i genuinely thought e-voting was a good idea until i came accross this thread . 
  there would need to be a rule that assigns the string of text to a voter . 
  hence if you knew the rule you would know the voters . 
  so someone would have to know . 
  i loved this show, 
  the brrd allows bad banks to be created as far as i know . 
  it does n't allow bailouts of banks anymore without first going through equity , subordinate debt and so on up until deposits up to 100k euro .
