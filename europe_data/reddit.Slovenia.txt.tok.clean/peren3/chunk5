  i do n't think anyone forced france to intervene in foreign conflicts . 
  i should have wrote default , not bankrupt . 
  my point was n't about law procedures , there are none for sovereigns . 
  someone in this thread pointed out what 's the procedure for us states . 
  they do n't get bailed out by the federal government . 
  puerto rico defaulted on august 1 , it is n't a state i know , but it was n't bailed out . 
  municipalities default and do n't get bailed out . 
  my point is that it is n't obvious that you need surveillance over budgets even in a currency union , and something more akin to the us would be much better than what is currently going on in the eu . 
  i 'm aware . 
  whats your point ? 
  you 're right to make the distinction . 
  i meant bankruptcy as in argentina 2001 , not as official bankruptcy law . 
  many countries have bankrupted this way many times . 
  why not ? 
  i think it 's feasible . 
  us states can do whatever they please , they can go bankrupt and do n't get bailed out , and they share the dollar . 
  us municipalities go bankrupt regularly . 
  besides , countries have the imf to bailout it 's members if it 's needed regardless of currency used . 
  there even is a no-bailout clause in the eurozone , but was conveniently creatively reinterpreted for the greek case . 
  the whole idea of the maastricht treaty was way off . 
  countries should do whatever they want with their budgets , but they should not be bailed out if they go bankrupt . 
  they made the same argument in / r/economics https://www.reddit.com/r/economics/comments/3t5pm4/study_finds_honesty_varies_significantly_between/ i agree , i do n't think its a well controlled study . 
  [ genocide against italians , after ww2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foibe_massacres ) [ as well as expulsion of italians after ww2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istrian_exodus ) and a massacre of slovene nazi collaborators after ww2, 
  i think it 's a joke on how small slovenia is , but i 'm not sure . 
  its not very funny either way . 
  it is n't meant to stop migration . 
  but to control it so they come at designated places . 
  instead of them going randomly across the so called green border . 
  not germany , but austria : http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/13/us-europe-migrants-iduskcn0rc0gl20150913, 
  in a very abstract model that 's true . 
  but governments ca n't really change the price level with a decree unlike the nominal exchange rate . 
  while wages can be lowered by decree , domestic prices ca n't . 
  and it is the relative price levels of the domestic vs foreign sector that are crucial . 
  in any case , iceland in 2008 or argentina in 2002 show that external devaluation works much better , as in say greece or latvia since 2008 . 
  in this graph , you can see the real exchange rate of 2 similar countries , finland and sweden vis a vis germany . 
  https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=hvn you can think of the real exchange rate as the relative competitiveness of a pair of countries . 
  what you see is that sweden 's exchange rate moves around due to them having their own currency , while finland remains fixed . 
  if finland had their own currency , they could devalue , and make themselves more competitive overnight . 
  while right now , to accomplish the same feat , they need to lower their prices , wages , etc aka internal devaluation . 
  even finnish economists and politicians are admitting now that adopting the euro was a mistake . 
  saying that euro has nothing to do with it is delusional . 
  pretty sure that inflation spike in the data was due to the vat rise . 
  greece has been in deflation for a while . 
  saying a nation lost people due low birth rate is pretty ridiculous . 
  birthrate is what it is , there is no normal birth rate to compare it to . 
  did not work in japan . 
  no , it 's 4 years  . 
  in former yugoslavia it was something like this : you wen to elementary school for 8 years , which you finished when you were 14 year old then you went to a high school , i think that 's the equivalent , which lasted from 14 year old to 18 . 
  these high school types were mostly for lower ranked professions , similar as what he said , bakery , welding , hotel staff etc. . if you wanted to continue to university level studies when you were 18 , you had to go to special high schools called gymnasiums , it was not possible otherwise . 
  a pension fund can not be a payg by definition , it would be a contradiction in terms . 
  payg is a method of financing without having a fund . 
  the first pillar of your pension system is payg , the other pillars people pay into funds , as is common in europe . 
  now i do n't know the proportion of pensions coming from each pillar but this is besides the point , maybe the 1st pillar is small . 
  [ link ] ( http://euracs.eu/summaries/summary-the-netherlands/ ), 
  is this info false ? 
  http://euracs.eu/summaries/summary-the-netherlands/ it says there : `` state old age pensions are financed according to the pay-as-you-go ( payg ) system : today 's contributors finance the pension payments made to the retirees of today . '', 
  or from [ here ] ( http://www.pensioenfederatie.nl/document/publicaties/english%20publications/nederlandse_pensioensysteem_engelstalige_versie.pdf ) : `` as in many other european countries , the dutch pension system consists of three pillars : the state pension ( aow ) , the supplementary collective pensions and the private individual pension products that each person can arrange for him - / herself . 
  together these three pillars determine the amount of pension that a person will receive when he/she retires at the end of his/her working life . 
  risk sharing , effi ciency and collective schemes are key characteristics of the 2nd pillar system . 
  the dutch state pension ( aow ) benefi t that is paid to people aged 65 and older is funded by contributions that are paid by people younger than 65 ( the so called pay-as-you-go system ) . 
  pension rights are accrued during working life . '', 
  if it 's false then fine, 
   it does . 
  it does n't . 
  the first pillar is payg as in rest of europe . 
   they do n't . 
  people pay for their own pension . 
  that only happens in chile . 
  european countries have some sort of payg system . 
  in japan quite a few life insurers went bankrupt due to low interest rates . 
  they have a long experience with 0 % interest rate policies . 
  i 'm just interested in the legal aspects of the whole thing . 
  what argument will hungary use and so on . 
  and what are the consequences if they fail in the lawsuit . 
  x for example , if you export it like say saudi arabia , hence a higher y. 
  for the us , it meant less m , therefore higher y. 
  they 're renaming the english word for their country not the name in their native language . 
  the english speaking world can not have that problem , since their english name is their native name . 
  i 'm interested in this as well . 
  since [ article 78 \\ ( 3 \\ ) ] ( http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-the-functioning-of-the-european-union-and-comments/part-3-union-policies-and-internal-actions/title-v-area-of-freedom-security-and-justice/chapter-2-policies-on-border-checks-asylum-and-immigration/346-article-78.html ) is pretty clear . 
  and the lisbon treaty does n't foresee unanimity voting for migration or asylum issues . 
  thanks , did n't know the history of schengen and that it was separate from eu . 
  you forgot italy . 
  it was used for purposes of domestic politics , imo , as an `` argument '' to keep up her open door policy . 
  because she has some trouble convincing her partners in the coalition . 
  it 's completely unrealistic . 
  singapore and hong kong should be probably excluded for statistical reasons . 
  they are city states and this introduces a bias , since the hospital is always very near to whatever happens and this improves various health related data . 
  be it accident mortality , mortality at birth etc. 
  eu 's own yeltsin, 
  chf is swiss franc ; i wrote about that . 
  find me a source that confirms swedes are taking out loans in euros . 
  most countries have most loans in their domestic currency . 
  in eastern europe chf is a popular currency as well , however . 
  also most banks are privately owned , not owned by `` countries '' . 
  and location does n't have much do with anything . 
  the swedish krona is already floating , just like the uk 's pound . 
  i do n't think swedes are taking out loans in euros . 
  denmark has it 's exchange rate pegged , however . 
  they did in the past .
