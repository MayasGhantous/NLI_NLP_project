  that is why it was outlawed . 
  i think the uk had an overdraft facility until 1997 . 
  no , its for the whole eu . 
  `` overdraft facilities or any other type of credit facility with the european central bank * or with the central banks of the member states * ... '', 
  neither sweden nor the uk borrow from their central banks . 
  they can also exit the eu , obviously any sovereign nation can do whatever they want . 
  that 's besides the point . 
  budget constraints are constraint . 
  you either pay the debts with taxes , or through money printing/inflation . 
  in both cases real purchasing power goes down . 
  it 's relying on refugee 's spending the money they are given is what is meant . 
  poor people have the highest marginal propensity to consume , and what they spend is someone else 's income , on which taxes are paid . 
  also any refugee that gets a job will put money in the budget . 
  monetary financing of budgets , aka money printing , is illegal in the eu . 
  read article 123 of the lisbon treaty , of which sweden is a signatory , [ link ] ( http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-the-functioning-of-the-european-union-and-comments/part-3-union-policies-and-internal-actions/title-viii-economic-and-monetary-policy/chapter-1-economic-policy/391-article-123.html ), 
  `` after the crisis had started , the debate about common insurance mechanisms became intertwined with one about transfers . '', 
  common banking insurance * is * about transfers , and only about that . 
  it did n't go `` intertwined '' with it . 
  oil is flooding you with cash . 
  40 years a slave, 
  amazing fact , did n't know . 
  napoleon screwed continental europe . 
  that is the point of ppp , to revalue the gdp figure to differentials in the price level , that is inflation . 
  economic projections are useless that far into the future . 
  they ca n't even forecast a year ahead . 
  this should be called extrapolating a trend . 
  the only projections worth their name are demographic , and even there it 's not easy . 
  pic related , imf forecasts for greece : http://blogs.independent.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/greece-imf.png, 
  finally germany does some fiscal stimulus in the ez !, 
  eu will likely mean more brain drain , not less . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshtableaction.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=tec00001&amp;language=en 500 bln $ less than france , 600 bln $ less than uk . 
  but yeah , this disparity will likely increase due to france and uk population rising much faster than italy in the future . 
  meh , france/uk is n't that much different than italy on most metrics except nukes . 
  people tend to forget that italy is a debtor to themselves in the same way as japan . 
  most of italy 's public debt is owed to residents of italy , so their debt is just an intra-italy transfer . 
  unlike greece . 
  we even have a memorial to napoleon . 
  i do n't think any other country has one outside of france . 
  others tend to hate the guy .

  would be better to compare the russian invasion of georgia rather than chechnya . 
  in 1994 , indeed morale and the state of the russian army was shit . 
  why do you think it 's an european problem ? 
  it 's a german problem, 
  you screwed yourself with the refugee 's . 
  why when they are knocking on your door you scream `` muh solidarity '' , but when they were knocking on italy 's door it was an `` italian problem '' . 
  see : http://www.thelocal.de/20110411/34307, 
  read this article : http://www.thelocal.de/20110411/34307 if refugee 's used to be an `` italian problem '' , as germany said . 
  it 's now a german problem , like orban said . 
  it 's pretty cowardly to do an u-turn and demand solidarity now , just because you are being swamped . 
  do n't think so . 
  croatia has been in recession 2009 , they never came out of it . 
  do n't know why , maybe someone from there can explain . 
  central europe is n't a strictly geographic notion , but more so a cultural one . 
  noone refers to central europe in this way as it is referred in the article . 
  otherwise all eu countries would rank equal . 
  i know there are significant differences in bankruptcy and commercial law between eu states . 
  do n't know much aout the rest . 
  acquis is n't that detailed . 
  anyway , read here what the index is about : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ease_of_doing_business_index, 
  just fyi , the doing business index is not about economic growth . 
  but about various legislation , like bankruptcy law , how easy is to start a business , contract enforcement , etcetc . . eu does n't have much to do with this . 
  the euro functions very similarly to the gold standard . 
  countries need to devalue internally by slashing wages etc - your standard austerity package , instead of devaluing the currency and regaining competitiveness that way . 
  see how the real exchange rate of sweden vs the exchange rate of finland behaved : https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=hvn, 
  it 's much more complex than that , read up on `` double irish '' and `` dutch sandwich '', 
  you can , you can do whatever you want . 
  so can germany , they can stop giving aid to countries they do not want to . 
  i do n't see the problem here . 
  eu never was a federation, 
  that is fiscal redistribution , apparently not enough for you . 
  why do you want so much other countries money anyway, 
  4 bln is about 2,6 % of your gdp , so it 's far from `` measly '' or `` lousy '', 
  there 's a similar story in slovenia . 
  in total 73.000 entered the country , while 48.000 left it , which means many disappeared . 
  gott erhalte franz den kaiser , the anthem of austria-hungary !, 
  you are n't making any sense , what does anything you wrote have to do with productivity ? 
  the correct diagnosis for russia 's economy is it 's classic dutch disease . 
  it 's mostly due to most commodity prices collapsing lately , and the sanctions . 
  i do n't think they had any bubble . 
  he should have said slovenia will collapse , not the eu . 
  it 's more correct . 
  more like , slovenia will collapse . 
  probably just a generation not `` a few '' . 
  at least for say estonia , lithuania , v4 minus hungary . 
  check how fast some ee countries are catching up : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00114&amp;plugin=1 also worth noting is how fast italy and greece are catching down to eastern europe  . 
  there is a problem of south versus north here as well . 
  in slovenia , we are mostly recording net immigration rather than emigration . 
  they are mostly from former yugoslav republics and assimilate very well . 
  i think people paint a too bleak picture of ee in this thread . 
  there are vast differences between ee countries . 
  they should rather sanction countries that arm and train the jihadis , the `` moderate '' beheaders - the us and the saudi 's for example . 
  `` historically belonged '' is always used for the various `` greater '' [ insert nation ] projects . 
  they could say poland historically belong to be part of russia and part of germany etc. . 
  this argument can be used for landgrabs liberally , which is why it 's bullshit . 
  `` liberation of iraq '' . 
  it was an invasion , and an invasion on fabricated grounds at that - the wmds . 
  un is n't a club of democracies and it 's job is n't to export it , it 's a club of sovereign nations , whatever their political system might be . 
  where is the link between barrel bombs and war crimes in what you pasted ? 
  a war crime is a well defined concept in international law .
