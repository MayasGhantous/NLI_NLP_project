i can already see how this will only create an army of new bureaucrats and not an actual army . 
  eu ca n't even reach any agreement on protecting it 's borders against migrants . 
  how could we come to any agreement when to use an army ? 
   that 's a weird comparison in this context i just compared 12 years before and 12 years after ( today 's anniversary ) . 
   an economy which is pretty down , will ** typically ** grow proportionally faster . 
  true , but there are also countries like moldova , ukraine , serbia that were also beaten hard and are below or just at the 1990 levels for different reasons . 
  majority of countries somehow manage to recover , but some even after 25 years not . 
  that 's 25 years of 0 or less growth . 
   but i guess that was the whole point of your post . 
  nope . 
  i pick data 12 years before entering the eu and 12 years after . 
  you know 12-12 . 
  and su officially ended 26.12.1991 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dissolution_of_the_soviet_union  slovenia was already out of recession in 1992 not true , 1993 was out of recession . 
  i really do n't care if you take me seriously or not . 
  i think redditors here have high enough iq to evaluate if this numbers are of any interest to them . 
  you can do your own analysis and publish it here instead of nagging . 
   if you ca n't control for variables well enough , you should n't present the statistics , or at least mention that it is hugely flawed . 
  what is wrong with you ? 
  i can do with data whatever i want , i do n't care if your feelings are hurt . 
   and it is n't a valid argument for ** ` eu is bad ' ** . 
  this is your assumption , because i did not state this . 
  i simpy used the bold function in order to distinguish numbers in some logical way ( it would be hard for eyes to see through columns of data without ) . 
  let 's pretend that soviet union and collapse never happened . 
  edit : you people have no idea how hard transition from collapse of su was for some of these countries . 
  2008 was joke , if you compare to crisis in 90 's in some of these countries . 
  lol , why not ? 
  with your logic i could n't compare anything , because there would always be some other factors . 
   all 10 countries grown a lot , some slightly faster : poland , estonia , slovakia , czechia and some a bit slower : hungary , latvia . 
  here is the list of gdp per capita growth of mentioned stated 12 years before joining and 12 years after joining eu . 
  ** bolded ** is the period with higher growth . 
  gdp per capita : ** 1992-2004 ** | ** 2004-2016 ** : cyprus : ** 28 % ** | -9,6 % czech republic : ** 31,2 % ** | 19,3 % estonia : ** 89 % ** | 31,5 % hungary : ** 38,7 % ** | 11,7 % latvia : ** 90,5 % ** | 45,5 % lithuania : 32,3 % | ** 54,6 % ** malta : ** 38,4 % ** | 16,4 % poland : ** 62,3 % ** | 46,7 % slovakia : ** 53,4 % ** | 43,6 % slovenia : ** 55,5 % ** | 9,2 % source : http://www.tradingeconomics.com ps : ** well done lithuania ** , you are the only new member that grew faster . 
  ** sorry cyprus , bad luck . 
  no kebab for geneva . 
  yeah , it 's true . 
  i 've notice the same type of behaviour ( more rural thinking mixed with some conservative religious beliefs ) in many other diasporas from ex-yugoslavian countries that migrated after ww2 or 90 's war . 
  it should be the other way around . 
  erdogan should be sued for trying to supress freedom of speech and creativity . 
  i 've just checked my attic ... 
  i am very disappointing , no pictures , some wooden boards , old magazines , dust and a few spiders . 
  my ancestors suck - i should start collecting some paintings and hide them away . 
  yeah , sure . 
  you should also try to write armenian , it 's not that hard : hhnunhtnnhh , nhhnun nhnhnnthhnn uhnhtuuhnhnnh huun . 
   why inflate the numbers ? 
  why not ? 
  i mean everybody does this for one reason or another . 
  well done !, 
  i hope you did n't mix up . 
  it 's more important to russians , because every year they send vip ( high priests & top politicians ) to this event . 
  russians love this ww events and we get free publicity . 
  hint : russia is mentioned in the title . 
  people like to eat cheap meat everyday and that 's the only way to meet the demand and make some profits . 
  i knew i saw this somewhere and i did some googling . 
  i finally found it !, 
  it appears this is saucer which separated from the stardrive of [ uss enterprise ( ncc-1701 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_enterprise_%28ncc-1701%29 ) . 
  trump is the answer , 
   wars in western europe have not occurred simply because of the huge costs involved for little benefit . 
  that is not true . 
  wars occur when the economy goes to shit and the people then find scapegoats ( internal or external ) . 
  no wonder someone lost his temper . 
  maybe [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hypmw4yd7sy ) piece of music would suit the auditorium better . 
   has a modern major conflict ever been affected by confiscation of firearms ? 
  sure , to some extent embargo on selling weapons help to lessen the intensity of a conflict , but nobody can realistically ban weapons from entering the war zone . 
  in conflict zone there is a huge demand for weapons and if you limit the supply , prices will skyrocket and thus black market will find it 's way to bring the weapons in . 
  but also people can still use machetes , clubs , improvised explosives , ... if they are highly motivated . 
  for instance in genocide in rwanda 1 million people were mostly murdered with machetes and clubs . 
  my guess is that portugal is not on their wishlist of countries to live in . 
  your country should invest more in recognisably in middle east and africa . 
  you might be right of course . 
  but albanian is so different language i have hard times to believe this connection makes any sense . 
  i am just wondering how come we are not connected to hungarian , german or italian language since we share our culture for more than 1000 years . 
  i do n't know how they compute this , but i would not be surprised if slovenian is also connected to japanese language in their models . 
  please check the original source . 
  mistake was done while translating it from ukrainian ( the words are very similar and easy to confuse ) . 
  and there are only 2 mil of slovenes . 
  i can not comment on albanian similarity to slovakian language and how this research was done . 
  yeah , i agree . 
  i believe this chart has some mistakes . 
  slovenia has population of only 2 mil ( and very small minorities in other countries ) and circle of speakers is as big as of larger nations ( serbia , slovakia , croatia ) . 
  i found this mistake and i am no expert on this matter , but i am not sure if this chart is to be trusted at all . 
  ** edit : found original source . 
  translators did mistake when translating slovenia and slovakia . 
  so albanian language appears to be connected to slovakian . 
  i do n't know , it still makes no sense to me  ** http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/mysliwiec/23578286/21144/21144_900.jpg, 
  or we let the poor people to die of famine and war , while protecting our borders . 
  if you ca n't provide for you or your children having more is not going to solve things . 
  resources are limited - arabs , africa , india will learn this the hard way . 
  this story is like chemtrails . 
  certain people will believe it no matter what . 
   the problem is debt increase true . 
  the real problem is taxation that needs to be increased year over year in order to service the debt increases . 
  remember people will start to hurt when their disposable income shrinks and wo n't be able to live the same standard of living as they used to do . 
  at the same time as government is expanding ( wasting money on useless jobs & projects ) the real problem occours : private sector get taxed more ( the real productive part of the society that is financing the country ) and become less competitive in the market which in the end brings the need for government to borrow and finance it 's own apparatus from the future income . 
  it 's a vicious circle of taxing our unborn children for the rest of their lives in order to support easy living today . 
  if anybody thinks they ( our future generation ) will just take the bill is out of his/her mind . 
  country could theoretically raise tax to 100 % on everything ( vat , income , capital gains , tariffs ... ) , but revolt will prevent this from happening as explained by the laffer curve . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laffer_curve either way average guy will lose his money , job , house , security . 
  lol , making economic projections +40 years in advance . 
  good luck with that . 
   erdogan asks rhetorically : `` so how will you deal with refugees if you do n't get a deal ? 
  ** kill the refugees ?
