  yes please . 
  european : uk , it 's the one that stands most out of mostly `` boring '' tricolours .

  we pretty much invented , defined and popularised the term yugonostalgia , so yeah it 's safe to say that people feel a special type of connection towards yugoslavia . 
  then you have slovenian nationalists who are all about `` karantanija '' a duchy from the middle ages located in what is now austria where slavs lived and had a very intriguing system of choosing their duke , which might have influenced the oath of office in us . 
  contemporary with karantanija , there was a vassal state of carniola that encompassed most of current slovenian lands , just that we know almost nothing of it , other there being a big rebellion together with croats , after karantanija and carniola got subdued by bavaria , lead by ljudevit posavski , who 's remembered by having a street named after him . 
  other than that you have few crazies , the most well known being our opposition leader , who has few years ago during his short stay in prison wrote a book called kingdom of noricum , which he presents as some kind of precursor to slovenia , while historically speaking the proto-slavs have n't even moved from their marshes , and the kingdom was actually celtic . 
  agreed on best . 
  i 'd maybe add drnov\u0161ek as a president to the best list . 
  as a pm he was ok , but as a president he was pretty chill . 
  as worst , let 's add marko natla\u010den to the list , he 's almost as bad as rupnik , but at least he did n't changed his allegiances or names as rupnik . 
  seriously , he went from leon , to lev to leo . 
  and from slovenian to serbian , to italian to german . 
  also jan\u0161a is obviously very divisive , if you ask one of his cultists , he 's the only good leader , but monthly polls do consistently rank him as the least popular party leader . 
  actually , iirc , it only applied for the contested lands in `` slovenia '' , that is : krain , kaerenten , styria and istria , not all their lands . 
  also hapsburg 's were smart , marrying all around europe , while ulrich iii ( i think ) was really stupid , jailing one of his sons and what not . 
  it would never actually happen . 
  ljubljana was fist mentioned as such ( luwigana ) around 1200s . 
  same goes for my city quarter of \u0160i\u0161ka , which at least wikipedia claims was first mentioned in a peace treaty between hre and venice that was signed at the `` old church '' , the ancient village centre of \u0160i\u0161ka . 
  before ljubljana existed , there was a roman town named colonia aemona iulia tribu claudia , which was supposedly established in 55bc . 
  it was on the other side of ljubljanica , from the historic medieval centre of ljubljana , and was in medieval times used as a quarry . 
  before that there were pile dwellings around the ljubljana marsh , where the oldest wheel , around 5000 years old , was found . 
  the part of \u0160i\u0161ka i live , on other hand , was only built around 1950 's , so yeah while both my city quarter and city proper , have long history my actual surroundings do n't . 
  i think it 's more popular in rural areas . 
  most ( urban ) teens usually party , by buying a sixpack of beer and few bottles of wine and maybe something a bit more stronger , then go to either banks of ljubljanica river , sit on benches in tivoli park , or in front of national and university library , or probably the most popular , just bum around metelkova , a squat turned into various clubs , bars and stuff with large open areas , where you can just hang out and only go to a `` bar '' to get another beer . 
  but in rural areas , what we hear makes the movie project x ( honestly have n't seen it ) seem tame . 
  they mostly do n't meet up in a house , but in barns or something else , either owned by the family of one of the people , or just abandoned , and drink all of the `` good '' home-made stuff . 
  the result is one of my favourite slovenian youtube video : [ jaj\u010dnica frgelovo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naoypa-8uim ) a video so surreal , yet it still feels so natural , that it could be used as a definition of slovenia and slovenians as such . 
  only heard of it through popular culture and other people on the internet ( obviously americans ) referring to it . 
  but i 'm also the least sports person i know , and i do n't even go on various hype trains , when one of our athletes is doing good and winning all of the stuff . 
  only sport i kind of follow/ed is ski jumping and flying . 
  i mean in terms of nationalism , xenophobia , populism and all those things . 
  i mean i get that orban is bad , but sometimes , the answer is voting against your political beliefs and voting fro more centre-left party . 
  but then again , i honestly do n't even know which parties are other than jobbik and fidesz , those are two `` boogeymen '' that slovenian press likes to scare us with , either in terms of cutting even that little rights that slovenian minority has , or in terms of our right wing parties turning more and more towards orban ... 
  the first elections are presidential elections this december , and it seems , that pretty much everyone has given up and accepted the fact that our current president and instagram superstar will win another term . 
  so it really depends on who 'll even run against him . 
  in local and parliamentary elections , i 'll probably vote for `` zdru\u017eena levica '' - united left - if they 'll still exist . 
  because as so many other left-wing parties they 're mared by in-fighting , specifically on the question , should they remain an electoral coalition of three separate parties ( of which one is de-facto leader , and other two are more hanging on ) , or should they join up into one party under the name united left . 
  ironically they 're all for it , or rather the one that had most trouble with accepting this was the most influential , where the big part of the member rebelled against this and wanted to remain separate . 
  other two are both for unification , but one of them , the smallest member and the least influential , is demanding some specific terms of joining , which might mean that it will fracture of . 
  i 'm kind of disappointed by all of this , but on other hand it was almost expected and because they 're closest to my political convictions , i 'll be still voting for them . 
  sounds similar to the current mayor of ljubljana . 
  well i in generally support any independence demands of smaller nations , especially if they want it . 
  stuff like catalonia , basque , kurdistan , and scotland is there as well . 
  maybe because i 'm also from a small nation , who only recently became independent . 
  i know about the history of monarchy and scotland , but i 'm a hard republican , and just ca n't get any reasoning with keeping monarchy . 
  especially , because i feel that staying in the commonwealth is n't really going full independent . 
  additional devolution and or , federalisation of uk would probably be the same result as independence within commonwealth . 
  i 'll probably be downvoted , but i hope that in near , rather than far , future uk as a whole or as independent states will become republics . 
  oh okay , that makes sense . 
  you know , i was all for independent scotland , until you ( your government ) said , that you 'd stay in commonwealth , and not become a republic . 
  then what 's the point ? 
  either go full republic , or do n't go at all . 
  hopefully this changed since then . 
  welp you 're [ wrong ] ( http://bos.zrc-sazu.si/cgi/a03.exe?name=sskj_testa&amp;expression=kurec&amp;hs=1 ), 
  that 's so not true . 
  you 're either trying way to hard to be contrarian towards americans , or are just stupid . 
  i can name few of them . 
  first of kurac/kurec has etymology in cock , that is rooster . 
  then you have things like [ `` rjava dolgonoga cipa '' ] ( http://www.kpss.si/o-parku/narava/zivali/gospodarji-neba/pevci/rjava-cipa ) ( i felt it can also have dolgonoga in it ) which literal means brown long-legged hooker - a sentence that you 'd expect a pimp to say , not an ornithologist . 
  honestly i do n't know what 's happening . 
  i mean i 've read what 's happening , but ca n't really make sense of it . 
  the way i see it , macedonia wants to make albanian the second language , given that there are areas with large albanian minority or even majority - supposedly there was n't the census made , since the 90 's . 
  and people who may or may not be gathered around vmro are against it , as they fear this will lead to death of macedonia , or federalisation or even union with albania ( ? ) . 
  from what i 've gathered it seems like a politician with a shady past is trying to get propped himself up with fanning the nationalist flames . 
  it 's very populist . 
  and people calling for help from trump and claiming that soros is somehow behind this ( is there a thing that soros is n't behind ? 
  ) , makes me feel it 's just same populism that 's popular in so many countries , and the people are being played by corrupt politicians . 
  i hope that macron ( or nayone lese ) beats le pen in second round . 
  and based on history , that once time papa le pen got into second round , chirac , who most people utterly hated at that point still won with the largest margin ( or something ) . 
  and for germany , i really hope for a pure left coalition with spd , die linke and greens . 
  but i fear that it will either be another win for merkel , or another grand coalition between spd and cdu , just with roles reversed . 
  if you start in \u0160kofja loka and you drive to poljanska sora valley and continue all they way up to gorenja vas and then just continue on to get to the crossroads for cekrno via kladje , but decide to just continue alongside sora still , you 'll get into \u017diri , which is a pretty nice little `` town '' if you want to call that , and then still continue on still following sora you 'll eventually after few kilometres of really interesting sightseeing ( especially the `` gorge of sora and matja\u017e 's caves ) you 'll get to rovte a dispersed village on top of a hill with amazing vistas that range from triglav through most of kamni\u0161ko-savinjske alps and more . 
  then you can return through logatec , or what i like to do , turn to zaplana , to cut few kilometres off and continue to vrhnika and back to ljubljana . 
  i like to do this trip with my bike at least once a year , and i highly recommend it . 
  you can do it with a car as well . 
  and if we 're talking dialects , i always felt that dialect from cerkno sounds like a black tongue of mordor or something it 's completely indecipherable and really guttural . 
  they started as centre-right , well you could even say centre-left as they were once called social democratic party of slovenia ( which abbreviated into sdss ) , anyway the point being ever since the founder was almost `` deposed '' by the current president back in 94 , the party drifted more and more to the right . 
  i 'd say they 're starting to edge on right wing populism . 
  few years back when there actually was a `` quasi '' right-wing populist party in form of slovenian nationalists , they were n't that populist , but then again the sns was n't really a fully right-wing party as it also saw our socialist history under yugoslavia and especially tito as a good thing . 
  but even back then a lot of nationalists saw them as controlled opposition , so they still preferred sds . 
  even more telling is the fact that , few years ago sds ( that is our main right-wing party , and largest party by membership ) was exposed to be working with members of blood & honour in one smaller local branch . 
  but that did n't really hurt them at all . 
  it might actually helped them , as they were vindicated as the true nationalist party compared to sns who was , as i said all over the place , and built their nationalism on slovenian and in turn socialist victory over the nazis . 
  while sds always saw the `` revolution '' as the worst thing to happen to us and wanted to rehabilitate the collaborators . 
  again this started as a pretty decent thing , just demanding that they deserve an actual burial , instead of being scattered in various holes and caves around slovenia and through time became just constant `` reheating '' of past events and trying to denounce the partisans and paint the homeguards ( domobranci ) , who might start as voluntary `` town watch '' , but soon transferred first into italian backed militia and after italian capitulation into gestapo backed police force under nazis . 
  as to why they 're supported : this is part of the reason . 
  admittedly partisans did few really dishonourable stuff back in the wwii , but come on that was like 70 + years ago , and they were n't the only ones doing bad things ; i mean the whole thing , that is all the `` revolutionary violence '' both during and after wwii is more or less a footnote of actual wwii atrocities and violence . 
  and sds is aware of that , because once in a while they 'll tell the public , that if nothing changes they 'll report all these atrocities to the rest of the world , and then international support for slovenian left would plummet or something . 
  but obviously they do n't because it 's wwii , everything we did in it , every other nation did , and to a way larger and more brutal extent . 
  but people here really like to hold grudges . 
  so stuff that happened in wwii , still affects our politics today , as those collaborators that survived passed their grudge to their children , and those to their children and so on . 
  other than that , the current leader of the party janez jan\u0161a was once a edward snowden-tier whistleblower in the jla ( yugoslavian people 's army ) . 
  and when he was imprisoned for it , and tried in serbian , this was one of the `` last drops '' that sparked the protests , that set in motion slovenian movement for independence . 
  and during the actual war for independence he was the minister for defence , so he and his cronies like to think themselves as liberators . 
  and as i mentioned before the predecessor of the party - sdss was actually in the winning coalition of parties that passed the declaration of independence and see it through . 
  and i think that 's also one of the parts that go into reasons why people support it . 
  but the main reason why it 's supported is , at least i believe it is , cult of personality around janez jan\u0161a . 
  again when he was imprisoned as a whistleblower , entire movement was formed around the demand to free him . 
  he was seen as the martyr of slovenian nationalism/independence movement .
