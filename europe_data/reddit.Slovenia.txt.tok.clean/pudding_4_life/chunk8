  but how will i know what the migrants are up to and how sausage is called in different languages ? 
  i never realised italy is more eastern than austria or slovenia . 
   the disruptive force of globalisation , the rise of populist nationalism , and the decline of traditional work [ reminds me of this ] ( http://imgur.com/r/thesimpsons/cir7tvc ), 
  i have read it and i cant seem to piece together what the message is . 
   `` highlight the uk 's environmental impact on the lives of black people locally and globally '' or  `` whilst at london city airport a small elite is able to fly , in 2016 alone 3,176 migrants are known to have died or gone missing in the mediterranean . 
  what is ti now ? 
  is the environment or immigration ? 
  is global warming racist ? 
  are black people forced to sit at the back of airplanes ? 
  slovenia can into nordic ? 
  the line has spoken . 
  we european slovenes dont care for your savage balkan slovenes anymore . 
  you know what they say : one tank a day , keeps the russian away . 
  shhhh . 
  be cool , guy . 
  dont blow the cover . 
  but what if they make a deal they cant refuse ? 
  but we are all still only `` communist rich '' . 
  i would shit my pants if at night i came across a felled tree and some 20 hooded guys around it . 
  and this guy is german , he probably had to read a lot about national socialism . 
  for 3 post you say that its worn for religious reasons , but its not religious . 
  how can that be ? 
  one thing can not be religiously prescribed and not be religious at the same time . 
  unless there is some lost in translation going on , i really dont see your point , or neither do you . 
  the shoes thing was a example , an illustration if you will to prove my point how to deal with it , but i guess i cant really make you see the point . 
  the cross and crucifix were on point , but i can not reason with someone whose main point is that a religiously enforced attire is not really religious in nature and we all should just ignore it . 
   i 'm asking how the hell you gon na prove that somone wears it because of their religion ? 
  you ask them to take it off . 
  normally nobody gets upset about that , as in taking off the shoes in other houses . 
  if they refuse and dont give a decent `` secular '' explanation you know something is up . 
  also people are not as stupid not to know that a certain clothing is religiously mandated . 
  what you are suggesting is basically looking away from the issue . 
  like saying its not a cross , its a t neckless , or having crucifix on the wall and saying its a sculpture . 
  people can still wear what they want in private , but in public life there should not be privileges for some . 
  he might have problems with the last one . 
   hijab is not a religious symbol or a religious clothing it 's just a clothing worn for religious reasons islam orders its not a religious symbol , but its worn because of religion . 
  makes sense . 
   anybody can claim that they wear it because they want to and you ca n't make them remove it because you have no way of proving they wear it because of religious reasons . 
  that is some , dont ask dont tell solution you got there . 
  so we treat it like a ordinary clothing item ? 
  so it shouldnt be a problem is a employer asks her not to wear it ? 
  basically like when i go to someones house and they ask me to remove my shoes . 
   it 's just a clothing worn for religion reasons . 
  you ca n't prove that it 's worn as a religious attire if the person denies it . 
  we all know its religious , but if we say its not its not ? 
  so basically a `` buy one ak , get grenade for free '' kind of deal ? 
  whats an average r/europe redditor ? 
  blessed be the virgin mary for giving me a day off . 
  not until we get a map of european maps production . 
  [ closes thing to making you spagetti . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw-bu6keeuw ), 
  i am pretty sure the rest of continental europe has only access to season 1 not just the east . 
  europe doesnt have enough problems , so we are importing other ones . 
  season 1 only . 
  at this time and point it seems like people need protection ** from ** the turkish government . 
  how is israel one of the top foreign aid recipients ? 
  [ youre just peanut butter and jealous ] ( https://youtu.be/zmtibicncqk?t=26s ), 
  i can see why kuwait would pay the us , after all they liberated them form sadam husseins occupation . 
  as for saudi arabia being a western puppet , i dont know . 
  during the 1973 oil crisis they made it very clear they would use their oil supply as a way to blackmail the west . 
  technically , piemont was the first country to be invaded by napoleon . 
  oh , right that whole thing . 
  so the moral of the story is dont poke the swiss . 
  so this is then basically the opposite of the diary of anne frank ? 
  switzerland not so neutral after all ? 
  trieste maybe ? 
   buildings in palmyra are from the romans . 
  the romans were european . 
  there 's the connection to the sub . 
  isnt that stretching it a bit thin ? 
  we dont include local news ** from ** europe ( which is fair enough ) , but we will from the middle east because europeans lived there a 2000 years ago . 
  also every other user could make the same argument and / r/europe would become r/world . 
  at least be honest enough and make the connection with the current refugee crisis and not some historical claims every territorial irredentist would make . 
  as in `` trieste is slovene because slovenes lived there . '', 
  sounds douche-y does n't it ? 
  damn it , now i fell bad for this being an asshole post . 
   fetches a higher price per kg which makes it easier to move . 
  this sounds like its taken from a csi episode and like you are talking about cocaine . 
  john paul ii was decent , benedict was/is a interim pope , but still not in the same rank as alexander vi or stephen vi . 
  i think that his `` refugees welcome '' statements have made a lot of people second guess him . 
   if a woman has the physical capability i think this is the main problem with women as frontline soldiers . 
  it even says it in the link . 
  backpacks and equipment are heavy , missions are long . 
  if a woman ( or any candidate for that matter ) can keep up with the standards , great . 
  but we should not lower standards just to appear political correct and progressive . 
  i dont know why , but this map is making me uncomfortable . 
  it does seem like an upgrade of the `` call brussels '' thing from some time ago . 
  but all of the european countries are represented in the council of europe + other non-europeans . 
  so it is the most `` european flag '' europe has . 
   what would happen to the `` flag of europe '' then ? 
  probably it would still be considered the `` flag of europe '' . 
  i represents europe now , and the meaning if symbols is hard to change . 
  but i dont think the council of europe will dissolve , as it is more of a un of europe with more prestige than actual power . 
  and again it was the british who were against that . 
  to be honest , basically anything can be turned to suit someones agenda . 
  actually , this will hide it from them . 
  pretty much , the way i see it : for erdogan there is no turkey after erdogan . 
  i read a couple of years ago the rebuilding and construction in chechnya is way of legitimizing the ruling authorities and pacifying the population . 
  newer = better . 
  yeah , i have no idea what those names are or what they entail , but i will take your word for it .
