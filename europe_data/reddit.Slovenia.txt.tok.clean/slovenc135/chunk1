does n't seem like it . 
  european values seem to adapt to muslim values rather easily . 
  how on earth does that make it better ? 
  actually , fuck better ... how is this not exponentially worse ? 
  wait , this needed defending ? 
  what 's the counter-argument ? 
  migrants from violent countries simply stop being violent just because they cross the border into eu ? 
  it does n't matter what you meant , but what you conveyed . 
  that was most certainly not your original point . 
  you 're just trying to twist it into that now . 
  and you 're dead wrong again . 
  muslims ** love ** to be lumped together with other muslims , so stop pretending like this somehow `` hurts '' them . 
  these belgians man . 
  they 're dangerous . 
  that 's a textbook strawman argument . 
  muslims already lump themselves under their religion without any help from me . 
  you on the other hand are lumping us together with certain other nations because we share a brief history with them . 
  according to * your own * logic it would be better to lump us together with [ yourselves ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_germany ) as we share a * far longer * history with you than we do with the people you are trying to lump us together with . 
  i dare you to break those down by nationality . 
  you 'll find that none of them were actually slovene . 
  but nice try throwing us all in the same basket . 
   you know that generally speaking that everything on the east side of the late iron curtain is eastern europe . 
  except it 's not . 
  especially not here . 
  maybe in your country if you 're being ethnocentric . 
  it 's a good thing i 'm not from [ eastern europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:europe_subregion_map_un_geoscheme.svg ) then . 
  oh right . 
  completely forgot about them slovenes that keep blowing up airports in germany . 
  why are you surprised ? 
  some of us have been warning people about this for over a decade and we keep getting ridiculed . 
  how much worse does this shit need to get before people pull their heads out of their asses and realize that something needs to be done before it 's too late ? 
  this is what pisses me off the most . 
  legal immigration is not easy and these fuckers are essentially cutting the line . 
  not just that but they are trying to open the door by force and on top of everything demanding preferential treatment . 
  could n't agree more . 
  i 've heard leftists argue that certain other human rights are above free speech . 
  they are not legitimate war victims from turkey though and as such have no right to enter europe * on the basis of seeking asylum * . 
  they 're free to go through the same legal process everyone else has to go through if they want to migrate to europe though . 
  this deal would screw over every legitimate migrant who had to bust their balls for years in order to stay in europe legally . 
  as soon as you take them out of turkey they are not refugees anymore . 
  they are all migrants . 
  no amount of mental gymnastics that will twist this . 
  what about the ones that made it all the way to sweden in the past year ? 
  it 's a shit deal that would n't reduce the number of migrants in europe by even a single one . 
  even worse , it would give turkey an even greater incentive to send as many as they could towards europe . 
  someone 's worried about afd . 
  you ran out of arguments so there 's nothing left for me to refute . 
  oh please tell me how the world works !, 
  i 'm really interested in what a citizen of the world 's bankrupt country has to say about it !, 
  no , just amused at how butthurt greeks get over something that they have no business in . 
  bully mentality at its finest . 
  you are more balkan than all ex-yu countries combined . 
  so you have rights but they do n't ? 
  balkan mentality at its finest . 
  who cares lol . 
  greece is even poorer than us now . 
  so do they have the right to veto your internal economic decisions , because they might affect them ? 
  if so then go ahead . 
  you named yourself greece because you have every right to . 
  nobody else had any say in that , just like you do n't have any say in what macedonia calls * themselves * . 
  but you see , it is not a false analogy and you have no authority to override that . 
  much like you have no authority in determining someone else 's name . 
  name calling ? 
  but it 's your formal and official name !, 
  what ? 
  you do n't like it when others call you something else ? 
   do you even know what are you talking about ? 
  yes  do you even know why they built all those kitschy statues ? 
  does n't matter . 
  statues do n't determine your name . 
   do you even know that they are using the name to alter history ? 
  then that should be condemned . 
  but it does not prohibit them from using any name they like . 
  deal with it . 
  no problem mr. osman . 
   being slavs doesnt give them the right to falsify history . 
  sure it does n't . 
  but they can still use any name they want . 
  or maybe you 're fine if everyone suddenly decided to start calling greece osmania ? 
  why not right ? 
  according to your argument we have the right to rename you internationally . 
  i did n't say they were n't . 
  being slavs does n't take away their right to be named whatever they want . 
  it was directed more broadly anyway . 
  it boggles me how the international community ( mainly journalists ) will listen to greece rather than macedonia , regarding their name !, 
  it 's like telling people your name is billy , but then chad comes along and tells everyone your name is dickface and then everyone starts calling you that . 
  insane . 
   fyrom no . 
  call them ** macedonia ** . 
  at the very least they have earned the right to their own name . 
  they also deserve to join both the eu and schengen . 
  where exactly is the dilemma ? 
  it 's pretty clear to everyone that she fucked up and now others are forced to clean up her mess . 
  it 's not even arguments . 
  it 's an endless self-congratulatory circlejerk . 
  nobody except maybe orban says what needs to be said . 
  it 's amazing how far some people will go to sabotage their own country . 
  why are belgians so violent ? 
   sweden not interested in muslim opinions , sorry . 
  yes , he wants them to be replaced by the peoples of the middle east .
