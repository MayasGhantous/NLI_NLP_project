  `` we would become the legal protector of the slovenian community in austria as defined by article 7 of the ast . 
  we would also correct the mistake made by the demos government , which failed to carry out this task , '' he added . 
  nsi has also issued a public statement . 
  the president and the vice president of the party , ljudmila novak in jo\u017eef horvat , expressed their concern about the discrimination of the slovenian minority . 
  `` it seems that we are returning to the horrors of the hitler era , '' said horvat and added that the party has demanded an urgent meeting of the foreign affairs committee and the committee for slovenian abroad . 
  novak has also warned that the government must try to contact austria 's federal government and demand the protection of the slovenian community in carinthia . 
  the european mp patricija \u0160ulin , a member of the sds , also described the proposal as completely unacceptable and a gross violation of the ast 's article 7 . 
  `` i support the efforts of the national council of carinthian slovenians , which calls either for german to be removed from the proposed constitution or slovenian to be added as the second state language in ethnically mixed municipalities , '' she wrote in her public statement . 
  at the same time , she called on the slovenian government to do whatever it can to ensure that the proposed constitution is withdrawn .

  look at all those flares . 
  for the uk it was never about leaving the eu . 
  it was about bringing it down by setting an example and causing a domino effect . 
  that is why they delay any aggrements as well . 
  just waiting for the french elections or whatever they may see as the possible `` breaking point '' which brexit clearly was n't . 
   although the number of carinthians who identify themselves as slovene has declined from about ** one-third ** to less than ** 3 percent ** over the past century seems like they are n't far off from the desired 0 % .
