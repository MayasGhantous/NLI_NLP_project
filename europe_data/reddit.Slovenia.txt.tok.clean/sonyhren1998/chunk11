  i could swear that this has been posted two times already . 
  against . 
  [ council of europe worried about slovenia 's asylum rules ] ( https://www.google.si/amp/www.politico.eu/article/council-of-europe-worried-about-slovenias-asylum-rules/amp/ ) [ council of europe calls on slovenia to reject some amendments on migrants ] ( https://www.google.si/amp/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/iduskbn1502jn?client=ms-android-samsung ), 
  following immense international pressure . 
  supplies though ... 
   god bless the austrians . 
  but it was the polish hussars who dealt the decisive blow . 
  well if what you are saying is true they definitely do n't represent the majority . 
   deep hatred for italians . 
  false . 
  nobody * hates * italians . 
  and rest assured there is no * deep * hatred for them . 
  had a good laugh.thank you sir . 
  times have changed . 
  visegr\u00e1d group here we come !, 
  anyone ? 
   former yugoslav country , the first one to break away and the only one to do so peacefully . 
  macedonia managed to get away fine as well . 
   european areas with strong nationalist tendencies * strong * is the word open to interpretation here . 
   quite frustrating that they could easily understand what we were saying in croatian , but we could not understand a word they were saying . 
  imagine how the monolingual native-english speaker must feel nowadays . 
   ** that you were part of the austrian empire holds little to no value in this discussion . 
  ** yes , you were part of yugoslavia and that 's a huge reason why you 're considered a part of the balkans . 
  yet the fact that we were part of yugoslavia matters . 
   `` the concept of yugoslavia , as a single state for all south slavic peoples , emerged in the late 17th century and gained prominence through the illyrian movement of the 19th century . '', 
  i do n't get the point you are trying to make with this citation . 
   iceland is a nordic country even though it 's way the fuck away from the others geographically . 
  finland is both a north european country and a western european country , even though it 's geographically to the northeast . 
  wow . 
  how come you know so much ? 
  geographically it 's a stretch since you 're at the very edge , ** but historically you 're part of the balkans and ai n't nothing you can do to change that . 
  ** i guess you mean just yugoslavia . 
  before that we were under austrian rule for far longer . 
  so i certainly do n't think we are historically part of the balkans . 
   ** southern ** end of what 's considered ** central europe ** . 
  ~ ~ most sane , most prosperous country in the balkans . ~ ~ very small . 
  name of it 's capital is beautiful . 
  ftfy, 
  one could say you provided us some * alternative facts * to spice it up . 
   gib back capodistria was trieste not enough for you lot ?!, 
   hateful comments on youtube what do you mean ? 
  rest in peace . 
  oh , so even hungary is central europe by your standards but not slovenia ? 
   ** i 'd more likely exclude ** moldova and ** transylvania from the balkans and respectively into ** eastern and ** central europe . 
  but slovenia is totally balkani . 
  ** lol . 
  two things : 1 . 
  there is no such thing as `` balkan culture '' . 
  even if there was , we would n't be included . 
  reported as misleading . 
  it is pretty popular now that we are good . 
  otherwise it was popular just among the fans . 
  the last year 's success of our ski jumpers brought a lot more people into it ( including me ) . 
  but now that they have n't been performing as good as before the popularity is dropping again . 
  i think we are quite polarized on the subject . 
  on one hand people are happy for her , happy for us . 
  being the first lady of the united states of america is ... well , it does n't get any bigger than this i think . 
  on the other hand there are those who refuse to take pride in it . 
  they say something in line of her not deserving it since she is just a wife of someone who happened to become president . 
  to put it nicely . 
  i guess that in the latter group of people there are those who genuinely dislike trump , his policies , what he said etc. 
  and see her becoming the first lady as of secondary importance to this . 
  millions of people died in europe for different nations ( flags ) and since nobody has died for eu one it makes it good thing . 
  something that can be creditted for bringing peace for the time being . 
  or nobody died for this flag since nobody really believes in it - is willing to lay his life for the idea of european union . 
  i do n't know how to feel about this post . 
  melania trump is now officially the first lady of the united states of america . 
  the rest of media 's attention was focused mostly on sports . 
  ski jumping and handball . 
  so public sector and welfare ? 
  what comes under government spending ? 
  i think he is implying the `` surrender monkey '' joke . 
  i 'm wodering about this as well . 
  same goes for moldova and northern part of ukraine . 
  mods !, 
  [ from the thread in / r/mapporn where i first found this map . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/5p9dsr/travel_advise_of_countries_by_the_french/dcpi0h2 ), 
  please note that i only know recognised a word or two and what those type of maps usually say . 
  would appreciate if someone corrects me . 
  my shot : green - normal vigilance . 
  yellow - increased vigilance . 
  orange - travel only if necessary . 
  red - travel not advised . 
  europe is not a single isolated entity in this world so i am sure posts like this are fine . 
  same would apply to the inauguration thread . 
  yes . 
  no other explaination . 
  forgot to add in the title : this is a cross-post from / r/mapporn . 
  beautiful shots !, 
  sendvid . 
  really ? 
  andy murray is british , then . 
  germany , the democratic leader of the western world . 
  how times have changed . 
  itt : people who read the title and took the article as genuine . 
  love caspianreport . 
  very in-depth objective analysis . 
  as always . 
  [ i got the same as he did . 
  how ?
