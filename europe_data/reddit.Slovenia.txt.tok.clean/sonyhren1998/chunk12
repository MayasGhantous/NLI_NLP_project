  our state media still does n't have a mobile-friendly website so here you go :  #slovenia to send protest note to croatia due to mussels  the minister expects the tensions to continue  15 . 
  april 2017 ob 13:09  ljubljana - mmc rtv slo  slovenia is going to send a protest note to croatia due to the expansion of the croatian mussel farm in the piran bay , announced foreign minister karl erjavec on friday . 
   the expansion of the mussel farm into the middle part of the bay was approved by the croatian government , although upon signing the arbitration agreement the countries had agreed to refrain from taking one-sided action until the arbitral court gives its verdict about the border dispute . 
   the farm in question has been located in the bay of piran since 1998 . 
  it has spread several times in the past but this is the first time that the farm has obtained official approval of the croatian government , explains the slovenian foreign minister karl erjavec .
