  `` this goes to show what the croatian government does not seem to understand : that the arbitration agreement is still valid , '' argues erjavec , who believes this action will cause unnecessary conflict . 
   slovenia has always responded to such deeds through diplomatic protest notes , the last time in february . 
  the minister expects the tensions to continue if the court of arbitration does not manage to reach the final decision on the border issue as soon as possible . 
  moreover , such one-sided moves could prejudice the settlement of the border in terms of its location .

  at first i was like `` fucking rude , why does this have so many upvotes who would post this ? '', 
  then i saw the flair - ukraine . 
  edit : a typo . 
  today , 9th of december in the year of our lord 2016 winds of war swept across / r/europe . 
  what at first seemed a friday morning like any other was anything but that . 
  the continent was shaken by the news that [ / r/france declared war on / r/de . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/5h9cyw/la_guerre_m%c3%a9m%c3%a9tique_nest_pas_une_invention/ ) this immediately raised concerns in / r/belgium who responed by [ calling in their allies acros the channel . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/5hcv4w/please_stand_by_us_in_our_time_of_need_i_implore/ ) this however did not deter / r/de from their [ reanactment of schlieffen plan . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/belgium/comments/5hdc3m/dont_mind_me_just_driving_to_france/ ) heavy artillery barrage has been going on ever since and has laid utter devastation on both sides which are now putting all their resources into what we may now call total war . 
  i ask all respective parties for immediate ending of all hostilities . 
  peace shall prevail !, 
  after constant bombardment and numerous other nations getting involved , peace has been reached next day on december the 10th in the year 2016 of our lord . 
  [ / r/france has announced they have agreed with / r/de to cease all hostilities and suppress those who still have flame burning in their hearts . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/5hj55n/la_guerre_prend_fin_the_war_ends/ ) indeed , it was over by christmas .

  in retrospective , what is your take on the whole panama papers thing ? 
  in my opinion it was a made up event by the western media and ever since then we have been living in an alternative reality where trump is president of usa and fake news are a thing . 
  good job .

  why is it justifiable for the anglo-saxon and american media to perform a coup 'd ` etat in russia federation under the pretense of some quasi rights and freedoms while at the same time the same people are persecuting edward snowden ( god knows what will they do to him , should they get their hands on him , these so called protectors of human rights ) and continued operation of guantanamo prison . 
  why was there nothing of what we are seeing now ? 
  why did n't other powers express their concerns into the leadership that failed to live up to their promises ? 
  you are drowning in the shit you created . 
  cheerio !,

  abba is shit . 
  we do n't but seeing other post major events during this millenia i will go ahead : 2004 - ascension to the european union 2007 - adoption of the euro, 
  he is viewed surprisingly nostalgic and romanticly by some despite him beong openly hostile towards slavic peoples . 
  i support and like the idea of european nationalism . 
  the rest not so much . 
  i wanted to point out that we have sizeable bosniak minority . 
  lol , i do n't know . 
  maybe we should poke them a bit . 
  damn . 
  frankenstain-esque creations like this one possible because of the whole `` multi-culturalism '' policy . 
  revolting . 
  yeah . 
  serbo-croatian and bosnian . 
   seems like everyone over here spends more time on there phone than actually socializing with other people . 
  kids rather spend the day gaming and using social media . 
  but using social media is socialising with other people . 
  it 's a non-issue , really . 
  i look forward to the day when i will be able to be plugged into the vast internet 24/7 . 
  at the moment the main problems are food and water consumption , sleep and releasing my bowels . 
  that is of course if school/job and other necessary activities are taken out of the question . 
  define nationalist . 
  the one you provided seems reasonable . 
  that 's a stupid question . 
  who would n't defend a part of his nation that rightfully belongs to them . 
  now , if it was meaningless oversea territory and i was an autistic sperg , i would rethink my chances . 
  standard slovene is based on based region of dolenjska ( the best region of slovenia , it is true ) . 
  the reason for that would be because the father of slovenian language primo\u017e trubar ( he wrote first two printed books in slovenian in 15th century ) was from here . 
  [ obligatory .

  yes , us 's leads the information age and we are quite frankly lagging behind . 
  ave maria !, 
  [ make sure they do n't pay you a visit . 
  deus vult extra hard today .

  i deus vult all the time except when eating and sleeping .

  yes , people cheered and paid great attention to euro 2008 when croatia was doing really well . 
  that is so petty . 
  something i would expect in the balkans but even here people cheer for croatia if we go out or do n't qualify . 
  multi-kulti . 
  at the moment ? 
  on the surface ? 
  solidarity , justice , live and let live , work to live come to mind . 
  underneath ? 
  decadence , immorality , cunnigness , manipulation . 
  i will take the right to participate in this thread because the countries that have adopted euro had their own currencies before and they are very well remembered here . 
  smallest : [ 1 tolar ] ( http://www.joksankolikot.net/kolikot/slovenia/2_001-tolar-1999.jpg ) largest : [ 10 000 tolars ] ( http://mmc.bolha.com/3/image/206443/207012/slovenija-10-000-tolarjev-1994-ivan-cankar_58877dc0b4461.jpg ) i miss those days !, 
  how fast we forgot that currency . 
  there was some nostalgia for it right after the adoption of the euro and i remember getting small calculator ( converter ) to our home by mail to help with the adoption . 
  now nobody cares . 
  i even had some coins that i did n't exchange for the nostalgic value lying around ( for their price to go up in the future , maybe , heheh ) , but that has been lost as well . 
  here is to hope that it was a sacrifice for greater good . 
  or you know , stay at the top ? 
  at the moment it 's probably ski jumper peter prevc despite his not so good season . 
  so , just football . 
  i hope [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xoqvhjth.jpg ) is edited . 
  46,6 km coming through . 
  i like our beach . 
  yeah , it 's just one . 
  a nice one , nonetheless . 
  but i also like croatia 's . 
  for me driving 15 , 20 minutes to the city is about normal . 
  driving about 45 minutes to one hour to the capital is a bit long and going on for 4 hours to travel half the country or going to holidays is the most i can take . 
  lol . 
  who is gon na give clay ? 
  [ this is europe we are talking about .
