  rarely i see a military truck on the road . 
  yeah but the chancellor has more power than the president . 
  i shit you not i have actually seen one woman walking aroung here dressed all in black robe . 
  as quick as she came , she also dissappeared . 
  never seen one in real life . 
  i completely understand the situations you described . 
  i myself happened to give an unusually long stare when i saw him . 
  still do sometimes . 
  of course . 
  which country are you from ? 
  yeah , but who was the worst ? 
  we break eggs by throwing coins at them . 
  brussels and rome , too . 
  the same safeguards that exist against trolls and other imaginary creatures . 
  i can name two more series that are known internationally . 
  un gars , une fille ( it 's from canada , but the original is in french ) and versailles . 
  fair points but i must say , and i mean no offence , that i am very dissapointed in you french . 
  tv series versailles went from first couple of episodes being half english half french to being completely english . 
  and the whole series is more or less based on real events , or rather characters and they all speak english . 
  immersion ruined . 
  also a french movie about napoleon starring gerard depardieu is in english as well . 
  but could n't he just assume we do n't care about it ? 
  you do n't see me spamming americans what they think of champions league results . 
  this is what i hate about americans . 
  they come asking shit like this for which they know is not a thing anywhere outside their country . 
  and not only that but they do n't ask if anyone knows about the thing in question in a nice and polite manner . 
  no , they assume everybody knows about it ( because ` murica , i guess ) . 
  whay do you mean ? 
  same as here then . 
  figured it was perhaps different in switzerland who is not part of the european union . 
  was there any control over them in switzerland ? 
  or did they just walk around as they pleased ? 
  similair thing here how nobody wanted to stay . 
  one of them even asked if we have roads . 
  i 'm not judging those people or anything . 
  after all , when hungary started putting up a fence it seemed a bit extreme to all of us . 
  fast-forward a couple of months : slovenia built one as well . 
  what 's even more : austria did the same . 
  very much necessary . 
  especially in germany . 
  in fact in the light of recent events it would n't be unreasonable to increase the presence in the countries they are in already and maybe even in new countries if they allow it . 
  but on the other hand , we do n't have them here so it is easy to judge others now . 
  maybe i would feel different if they were in the country i am from . 
  which country are you from ? 
  that 's disgusting attitude to your own language , man . 
  i would wet myself . 
  european . 
  i do n't really care . 
  why should i ? 
  they are yet to make an impact in international football . 
  you conviniently left out all other adjectives . 
  :d but to be honest man do whatever you want , i say . 
  if people want to have them , let them . 
  not without very strict regulations , of course . 
  just do n't be like some americans who go about making a big deal out of it screaming it 's a right to bear arms and what not . 
  guns suck . 
  they are stupid and unnecessary . 
  old-fashioned too . 
  flag of the eu . 
  no one , really . 
  but if i have to answer then i would say i would like to see recreation of the state of slovenes , croats and serbs . 
  [ yeah , really . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/d42nz1hl.jpg ) dude , literally every other person from every country has it that way ( left = hot , right = cold ) . 
  not a historical figure . 
  not at my place . 
  my best guess is it is to honour the republican fighters during the civil war . 
  will try to look for some more info . 
  edit : yeah , it is named after the yugoslavs who went to fight on the republican 's side during the spanish civil war . 
  edit_2 : source : [ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslav_volunteers_in_the_spanish_civil_war] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslav_volunteers_in_the_spanish_civil_war ), 
  it is n't other place or figure but it is naming after a foreign event that comes to mind . 
  spanish fighters . 
  we are pretty good at football for our size . 
  russia on the other hand . 
  are you illiterate ? 
  i just said that we can thank americans that we do n't speak german today/aren ' t part of germany/austria today . 
  you do realize americans swept in and made sure we can thank them today that we do n't speak german , right ? 
  `` thank you '' for what ? 
  it is not like i rode for free . 
  two biggest cities . 
   as a german on reddit it 's really funny to be accused of betraying our past and having become a leftist rabble that does n't deserve the name germany anymore by american wehraboos while at the same time being accused of being stupid nazis by ** eastern europeans . 
  ** you # $ % $ , you . 
  you could just drop a nuke , would prefer that . 
  any war is scary . 
  rebellion . 
  the way i remember it as security across europe was on higher level of awareness that time . 
  that 's why they stopped him . 
  but the reason he was shot was because he raised the gun and he was only later indentified as the culprit . 
  all of it . 
  mostly as part of school excursions . 
  same as germans , apparently . 
  training starts when zlatan says so , for example . 
  w as for wien , right ? 
  pizza . 
  pomfrit . 
  [ weekly thread on / r/europe . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5w97gd/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20170226/ ), 
  that 's actual here as well . 
  not just wolves , though but wild animals in general . 
  [ some people have even chimped out and vandalized public buildings . 
  gauda .
