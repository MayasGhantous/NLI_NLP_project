  is this interrogation ? 
  land of the free , home of the brave . 
  ah , yes . 
  / r/askeurope would n't be the same without anericans . 
  a slovene sees a man in the forest where there are bears . 
  he tells that to the man who replies : `` molim ? '', 
  ( croatian for `` excuse me ? '' ) . 
  slovene says : `` nevermind , carry on . '', 
  something like this if my memory serves me right . 
  i could n't find the original on the web but found a similar one while looking . 
  a slovene , a croat and an austrian are sitting at a bar in saudi arabia . 
  they are drinking beer which they smuggled in . 
  all of a sudden police bursts in and arrests the men . 
  their punishmet : 20 strikes with a whip . 
  `` the executor '' reads the judgement and says that they each have one wish . 
  croat goes first : `` tie a pillow on my back !, 
  '' , he says . 
  after 10 strikes the pillow is destroyed . 
  next goes the austrian : `` tie 2 pillows on my back ! '' . 
  does n't help either . 
  when it 's slovene 's turn the perpetuator says he can have 2 wishes ( because why not ) . 
  slovene says : `` strike me 40 times ! '' . 
  the executor is astounded but asks him what his second wish is . 
  he says : `` tie the croat to my back ! '', 
  oh god . 
  it implies their stupidity . 
  we have the same joke for policemen . 
   luxembourger do people identify as them ? 
  or just as germans or french ? 
  why would he throw the brit out ? 
  another one !, 
  does this explain high aids rates ? 
  the way things have been lately i do n't dare make predictions for one year ahead . 
  let alone 100 years . 
  add [ this ] ( http://muzej.rlv.si/si/ ) to the list . 
  we have no such thing here . 
  at least not that i would know of . 
  paris 's catacombs are interesting , though . 
  but i guess you already know about them . 
  not very . 
  there are 2 guys who enjoy it . 
  they are the commentators . 
   according to trump there is your problem . 
  edit : could it be ~ ~ op ~ ~ trump meant [ this ] ( http://www.bt.dk/udland/svensk-politi-optrevler-sadistisk-netvaerk-af-paedofile-maend ) ? 
  [ the first time this sub has dissapointed me . 
  ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/96ab/production/_87017583_030098572-1.jpg ), 
  i was answering to your question if we have something similair in our country . 
  that a country at one point gets small enough for it to not be possible to be split up by separatists anymore . 
  it does n't get any smaller than this . 
  would be easier to help if you described what interests you . 
  edit : [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/s5q2kt_bxho ) is a video about things to do/visit/eat in slovenia that i really enjoyed and from what i could tell so did the visitor . 
  you knock on wood if you do n't want for something to happen . 
  met people from rovte . 
  it was hard to understand them when they spoke in dialect . 
  it is funny to me because it seems perhaps like dolenjsko nare\u010dje was taken to extreme . 
  the name especially . 
  people from other ex-yu countries tease you with it . 
  yes , they do . 
  it is like in the picture you submitted . 
  a flag of municipality , flag of republic of slovenia and an eu flag . 
  second this . 
  unless op repharaphrases it so that by subdivisions it means `` central europe '' , `` eastern europe '' , scandinavia etc. 
  i feel like it would kickstart the economy . 
  something a tad radical , that could just work well . 
  if it does not we can scrap it anyway . 
  worth a shot . 
  i am going to be honest with you here , mean no offence ( checked the spelling online so that i wo n't trigger that guy ) , though . 
  i had no idea you existed until not so long ago . 
  i learned about you online where people were `` joking '' ( bashing turks , basically ) that they support independent kurdistan , thus triggering the turkish people . 
  since then i remember seeing news about turkish soldiers executing kurdish indepentists , i can now also recognize your flag and know the region kurdish state claims as their own . 
   there 's a really reeeally salty guy on here who reports every post which has `` americanized '' grammar . 
  pack it in \u0ca0_\u0ca0 props to the lad . 
  keep up the good work . 
  we are a few but righteous . 
  please do correct me if i make mistakes . 
  i try my best but as a non-native speaker i struggle with less known examples . 
  that land was later sold , right ? 
  i 'd rather not . 
  you 've always been superior to us in that regard . 
  trieste a city which had slovene majority and was the city with highest slovene population . 
   no other words needed . 
  please elaborate . 
   1 ) robert surcouf , a famous french corsair , talking with a british officer after capturing his ship , the kent :  british officer : `` you french fight for money , while we british fight for honor . ''  robert surcouf : `` sir , a man fights for what he lacks the most '' . 
  i have seen that in my school textbook . 
  british officicer was replaced by russian sodier and robert surcouf by napoleon . 
  we have one for our municipality and learned it in school as well . 
  [ here is my answer from another thread . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5pfy9o/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20170122/dcr9ubg ) you really should go to the country related subreddit ( / r/slovenia in this case ) with this . 
  same goes for all other one-country specific type of questions . 
  edit : a typo . 
  lay off game of thrones , mate . 
  the last stronghold of catholicism . 
  volkswagen cars are quite popular here . 
  hell , it 's our family 's car . 
  it is associated with ` german quality ' . 
  ford cars , on the other hand , are less popular and i do n't happen to know what people 's general opinion on it is . 
  well he was n't president either . 
  ~ ~ regarding president of the republic of slovenia : ~ ~ best : janez drnov\u0161ek ( president ) worst : alenka bratu\u0161ek ( prime minister ) edit : see child comment .
