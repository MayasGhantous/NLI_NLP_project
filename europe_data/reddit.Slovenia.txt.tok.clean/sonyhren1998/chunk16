  [ holy shit !, 
  are you me ? 
  damn . 
  us again . 
   what do people value ? 
  we try to look up to countries like switzerland , austria , germany and i guess scandinavian countries as well . 
  the values those countries have in common are order , efficiency , low corruptability and some others i ca n't think of right now . 
  those i would say are the main things archetypal slovenian would value . 
  some of those qualities we posses already some are hopefully yet to be achieved . 
   what quirks do they have ? 
  no idea . 
   what is the national mood ? 
  the national mood right now and for the last couple of years is extreme dissatisfaction with the government . 
  that is occassionaly broken for a short period whenever our sportsmen do well . 
   what are the politics ? 
  do n't know myself . 
   are the people particularly religious ? 
  not really . 
  according to this data from 2002 , 58 % of people declared themselves of catholic faith . 
  i do n't know how that compares to other countries . 
   what is the relationship between the youth and the elderly ? 
  distanced . 
  like they do n't acknowledge each other 's existence . 
   what are the national past times ? 
  hiking . 
  definitely hiking . 
   what are the people most proud of ? 
  nothing . 
  even though we have a lot to be proud of for a country our size . 
   what are they most ashamed of ? 
  nothing crosses my mind . 
  maybe [ this .

  [ youtube trending slovenia begs to differ . 
  pretty much nobody knew about her . 
  i remember coming across her by accident when browsing the vast internetz . 
  it went something like this : listen to mac miller -  find out about [ donald trump song ] ( https://youtu.be/74tfs8r_smi ) -  type his name into google ( knew nothing about him back then but figured it must be someone important considering songs being made about him by artist like mac miller ) -  check out his wiki page -  see who he is married to -  figure that that name sound kinda slovene-like -  learn about melanija knavs . 
  seemed cool enough . 
  had no idea it would go down like this , though . 
  damn . 
  [ just type `` juncker funny '' in youtube . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/v2qrarlze-o ), 
  ah yes , i 've seen this on tv here in slovenia . 
  a company went or was about to go bankrupt so people organized themselves and are now leading it . 
  i think you would get more responses if you would describe what `` worker cooperatives '' is . 
  [ i do n't know . 
  but based on this it is boobs .

  i use slovenian if possible . 
  i was surprised when i found out how many words derivate from german language are still commonly used in common language . 
  example ( english - official slovenian - common slovenian - german equivalent ) : time - \u010cas - cajt - zeit there is even slovenized italian curse word : porkamadona . 
  i see one from my room 's window . 
  it is next to the red cross . 
  and in general i think it can be seen at official buildings ( [ municipality building ] ( http://kraji.eu/pictures/gorenjska/cerklje_na_gorenjskem_sencur_z_okolico/sencur/obcina_sencur/dsc_0072_sencur_obcina_sencur_big.jpg ) ) and events ( [ government making a statement ] ( http://www.sloveniatimes.com/modules/uploader/uploads/aktualno/podobe1/cai32jqwaaaid3w.jpg-large.jpg ) ) . 
  what ? 
  did you read what i wrote in the body ? 
  it happened to me that i picked sloven\u010dina instead of sloven\u0161\u010dina when picking language . 
  / r/ireland . 
  according to 4chan americans poop in the stores . 
  he means sea access . 
  spanish weather means temepratures well above 30 \u00b0 c. 
  you lot complain when it gets hotter than 20 \u00b0 c. 
  never did . 
  that us and slovakia are very similair countries . 
  we do n't have any jokes about jews , though . 
  / r/france, 
  lately i play victoria 2 . 
  so you are asking not about people 's opinions on tank deployment in europe but about posts regarding the topic in / r/europe . 
  correct ? 
  if so , i do n't mind . 
  i mean that subreddit is for things related to europe so i do n't see a problem . 
  not the highest resolution but it is a small town and [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/74ktsv4.jpg ) is the best one . 
  i 'm very ignorant of my country 's politics but from the unavoidable media attention etc. 
  i can gather that it would be either janez jan\u0161a ( right wing politician ) or milan ku\u010dan ( retired left wing politician and ex-president ) . 
  i learned about him from [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/74tfs8r_smi ) song . 
  4chan , i think . 
  croatia - i enjoyed my holidays there so i guess i like their climate , beaches and other things that go with that . 
  the people we interacted with were alright as well . 
  austria - i guess an average slovenian appreciates the way their country is ran . 
  i especially like the mountain towns ( few houses , which are similar to the ones we have , beautiful mountainous landscape ) . 
  italy - the country with one of the richest histories right next door . 
  makes for a nice trip . 
  or so i have been told . 
  hungary - hmmm ... 
  they do n't cause any trouble . 
  they are there , doing their thing . 
  `` beating a dead horse . '', 
  that is the latest one . 
  i would suggest you to go to / r/russia with this . 
  from what i have seen they will be glad to help . 
  triglav national park . 
  edit : [ some things to keep in mind . 
  ] ( http://www.tnp.si/experience/c202/ ), 
  circa a month in croatia and a couple of hours in austria and italy . 
  shit , you are right . 
  you woud be surprised how many people name their kids/change their names because of the spelling , not the sound . 
  do n't plan on having children but french jean sounds like a nice name . 
  what was it about japan that shocked you ? 
  i know one person who has on multiple occassions clearly stated he is an atheist . 
  - why is there no santa claus in australia ?
