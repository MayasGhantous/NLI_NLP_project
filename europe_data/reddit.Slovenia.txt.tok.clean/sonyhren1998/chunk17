  - because it is too dangerous . 
  you will likely get a heat stroke inside that costume . 
  [ obligatory ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ), 
  reported . 
  predv\u010deraj\u0161njim : day before yesterday pojutri\u0161njem : day after tomorrow car : slang used by youth for someone who is cool . 
  kinder egg . 
  in general ? 
  - yes . 
  ( we have hot ( but not too hot ) summers and cold ( but not too cold ) winters . 
  so it is a nice balance . 
  lately ? 
  there was basically no snow last winter + summer was exceptionally warm . 
  the wildlife , though . 
  / r/europemeta, 
  older people . 
  one of my grandmothers has seen it for the first time in her life just a year ago . 
  the other grandmother and grandfather have n't seen it and when the topic is brought up they say they do n't really care or understand whole thing about people going to the sea . 
  yeah ... to be honest it just does n't make sense to me . 
  stars , some blinking ... what ? 
  what 's the point of that paragraph that it made someone post it in askeurope ? 
  if you are not too bothered too explain . 
  we are prepared : https://1d4chan.org/wiki/post-apocalyptic_roadmap/slovenia, 
  what have i just read ? 
  navy seal copypasta , i would guess ? 
  came here to mention \u017dabjek . 
  this applies or has applied to me/us as well . 
  not `` just discovered '' but still : [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5kac5cocuk ), 
  yes , but not always . 
  only when there is an official event like someone 's birthday or something would you exchange two kisses with a person . 
  but never man-man or woman-woman . 
  edit : wrong name . 
  what is the third video about ? 
  was just thinking about that today . 
  anyway , here are a couple , some of them same or similar to ones others have already posted : i will use op 's formatting . 
  while looking for better explanations i came across [ this website ] ( http://www.omeidl.com/greek.html ) that also explains the origins of the phrase . 
  * [ predmet ] mi je \u0161panska vas * ( [ subject ] is a spanish village to me ) : something you do n't understand even the slightest bit . 
  * mar govorim kitajsko * ( am i speaking chinese ? 
  ) : used when somebody does n't understand what you are saying . 
  * varno kot \u0161vicarcska banka * ( as safe as swiss bank ) : obvious . 
  * to\u010den kot \u0161vicarska ura * ( as punctual as swiss watch ) : speaks for itself , again . 
  * naredil se je francoza * ( doing the french ) : same as op says for `` doing the swede '' - to pretend you are dumb . 
  * kaditi kot turek * ( to smoke as much as a turk ) : to smoke a lot . 
  * jaz sem pa pape\u017e * ( and i am the pope ) : when somebody is saying something unbelievable . 
  * jih je kot rusov * ( there are as many of them as there are russians ) : said when the number of people is higher than usual . 
  sweden . 
  no , no such thing . 
  that they ( finns ) really like their personal space.i have this stereotype about them from the picture of them waiting for the bus with about a meter distance between each other . 
  we went to croatia and i remember that we completely unexpectedly came across a family from the same village as us , back home . 
  edit : grammatical errors . 
  it is the same here . 
  a cheeky croatian appears out of nowhere . 
  honestly even if it is a cent ( a penny in your case ) i 'm not going to leave it . 
  nobody would `` let me go '' if i was a cent/penny short so why should i give it away ? 
  ** natural diversity ** what i mean by that is that for a small country that we are , we have alps in the northern western part of the country , sea in the southern western , plains in the north east and kras ( not sure how it is called in english ) in south east . 
  it is true that in slovenia you can go from skiing in the mountains to swimming in adriatic sea in a couple of hours . 
  ** cultural heritage ** from natural treasures to cultural ones . 
  here the most prominent one is out great poet france pre\u0161eren . 
  he is great source of national identity and `` provider '' of lyrics for slovenian national anthem zdravljica ( translates to `` a toast '' in english ) . 
  linguistic speciality : i 'm not sure if this counts as `` cultural treasure '' but slovenian language is one of the few in the world that still uses duality . 
  i 'm mentioning it because it 's funny how all of you are having threesomes , foursomes etc. 
  while here two persons participate in sexual intercourse . 
  iii . 
  ** sports ** i have to mention it because for a nation of 2 million people we are quite successful so far . 
  some of the more known sportsmen and sportswomen are an\u017ee kopitar ( hockey player ) , tina maze ( retired skiier ) , peter prevc ( currently the best ski jumper in the world ) , goran dragi\u0107 ( basketball player in the nba ) ... 
  the list could go on but here are just a few i hope some of you will recognize . 
  edit : grammar and formatting . 
  a question for those people who have the option to choose their native language in addition to english in video games . 
  do you prefer to play in english or in your native language ? 
  do you think it is possible to ban ads being placed by the road , on buildings etc. ? 
  is this already the case in any of the eu countries ? 
  do people in yoyr country still get a lot of commercials in their mailboxes daily ? 
  here very much so . 
  just now i emptied our mailbox and it was nothing else but circa 5 commercial paoers which were a vit crumbled since the postman barely managed to get it in . 
  anyway , the point is that i threw those commercials straight into the bin as do some other people so how is it economically feasible to be sending people commercials that most often get thrown into the trash without reading . 
  and is n't that quite bad from environmental persoective , even if the paper gets recycled ? 
  sorry for the poor wording of tge question . 
  here , in slovenia there has been an increase of seers ( not sure that is the correct word ) operating on tv in the last few years . 
  basically people who have their tv shows in which they receive calls where people are asking them to tell them their future . 
  that usually means health , money or relationship stuff . 
  there is quite a few of them here and it does n't look like they are going away anytime soon . 
  does the same apply to your country ? 
  nine out of the last ten questions have been asked by 2 users . 
  should there be a rule against this ? 
  do people swear at each other ? 
  show hand gestures to other drivers ? 
  act tough on the road ? 
  master race , \u00fcbermensch , undesirables , untermensch and all that . 
  surely things like that do n't just go away , right ? 
  i feel like this is starting to show itself now that there is crisis and germany is doing really well while the majority of the other countries struggle more . 
  you often hear claims like `` be more like us , you lazybones '' and similair . 
  i wonder if we are ready to desist that type of reasoning and preserve each country 's respective indentity in face of the aryan onslaught . 
  i would choose france . 
  it actually came to it during the napoleonic era when illyrian provinces were established . 
  the people were for the first time in history allowed to use slovene as the official language . 
  now that it is over and i look back i remember seeing banner in the city 's main square saying something like : `` immigrants welcome !, 
  '' , `` no to nazis . '', 
  if i remember correctly ( it has been a while and it has been since taken down ) . 
  what is your opinion on things like this ? 
  back then i did n't really think but now i think it was kinda odd they spread that banner out in the place they did because it could be misonderstood as if the whole city agreed on the issue . 
  here is an excerpt from an interview :  are you homesick ?
