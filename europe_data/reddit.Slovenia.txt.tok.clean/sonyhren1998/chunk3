  yet the communists are parading in the media . 
  they have no right to demand anything . 
  tremendous read . 
  thanks for sharing . 
  when you have friends like the usa and the uk you do n't need enemies . 
  yup , eurobots are working extra hours tonight considering the number of submissions connected with russia . 
  i do n't think it as as effective as [ this ( potentially nsfw ) ] ( https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-slnjykrmmsi/veyvwbhanei/aaaaaaabt10/mkjtdg353vg/s1600/dead_german_makes_good_signpost_russia_1942.jpg ) . 
   the thing your rant is not addressing , is the fact that germany has fair election , and russia does not have fair elections . 
  it 's not a rant and please do not try to belittle my comment like that . 
   also , merkel has n't poisoned anyone with polonium , not did she have anyone shot . 
  that is , to your knowledge . 
   she also does n't control most of the german media . 
  who does , then ? 
  because somebody does . 
   i would also be fine with the russian media endorsing a candidate in my country , if those media outlets were n't literally owned by a dictator who kills his opposition , journalists , diplomats , anyone who undermines his regime . 
  merkel 's net worth is estimated to be 11.5 m $ . 
  putin 's net worth is estimated to be 200b $ . 
  source for those estimations ? 
  and as i said before , russia internal affairs are none of our business . 
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- what business of ours is it what kind of elections russia has ? 
  not so long ago a german journalist died in a car accident in germany . 
  not long before that accident he came out saying something along the lines how they are told what can be written and what ca n't . 
  i am sure you heard nothing about it but please be more careful with the accusations you are throwing about in the last pharagraph because what you accused me of goes both ways , i am afraid . 
  to the people saying russia is devoid of rights of freedom to expression , that it is being repressive to the opposition etc. 
  : a man , who nobody knew who he has yesterday just had a couple of thousand people in russian major cities rise up in his name and those people were gently reminded of their place by the honourable gentlemen of the russian police . 
  what 's more ; there seems to be somewhat of an overwhelming presence of anglo-saxon and american media on russian soil right now . 
  is that not enough ? 
  this man is being openly declared as the possible next president by the anglo-saxon and american media . 
  imagine if there was a russian sponsored coup in germany where angela merkel has been in charge for more than a decade and if frauke petry was being portrayed as a suitable replacement as a head of state by the russian media sources . 
  we are going about portraying ourselves as champions of democracy , some basic freedoms and feel like we are holier-than-thou to about every other country while at the same time taking use of practices that were seemed as accepted hundred years ago when for example german empire supported vladimir lenin and another revolution , after the october one failed . 
  that did not backfire at all . 
  and neither will this . 
  right ? 
  the fact that people think a man like him can be a president of russian federation is a clear sign of the terrible state western spy agencies have found themselves in . 
  a man like him would n't last a day as the head of russian state . 
  the terrible lack of understanding of the russian people and the way russia works is being displayed here baffles me . 
  not something i would expect from bb fucking c . he is as domesticated as a dog . 
  well i only saw `` protesters '' get carried away appropriately and yet there seems to be an uproar . 
  according to some sources that man died later in hospital due to fractured spine if i recall correctly . 
  so , euro style competition format but instead of knockout stages it 's a league system . 
  that 's what happens when balkan is in charge . 
  in b4 : `` s-s-s-lov-akia , right ? 
  '' , `` russia with a stamp , of course he would say that . 
  '' , `` putin 's cock sucker '' etc. , etc. 
  in response to [ this . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/61na27/russian_police_taking_down_protesters_in_moscow/ ) there are two sides to every story . 
  they have 7500 nuclear missiles ? 
  `` keine '' is german for `` no '' or `` zero '' , right ? 
  bremsen activated . 
  lol . 
  you sound like bbc . 
  in my defence : everything that goes against anglo-saxon and american alliance is either marked as conspiracy , swept under the rug or countries turning a blind eye . 
   do you seriously think that germany will take the mantle of the heaviest opposition to putin ? 
  the german public wo n't be too happy having to help during direct confrontation either . 
  what ? 
  am i missing something ? 
  was i not clear that i am proposing a transeurasian pact between eu ( that means mainly germany but also france as the two biggest powers with uk out of the picture ) and russia and thus - subsequently - countries that already fall under russia 's sphere of influence ( kazakhstan , tajikistan etc. 
  etc. ), 
  i think we would fall under germany 's sphere of influence . 
  edit : or rather ; their already highly present influence would increase drastically but that does not mean our surrender to a foreign power . 
  merely adaptation to geopolitical shocks that were created by the powers i mention in the post . 
  edit_2 : and while i am generally no fan of either of the two countries ( germany and russia ) and am all up for all peoples living in symbiose the fact that i am proposing this now merely shows the gravity of recent developments . 
  i understand it is comforting to believe that from romanian perspective . 
  but please do see what i said :  a military confrontation with russia which even if we would come out on top would leave our region in utter devastation , set back decades while others would remain virtually unharmed . 
  unless you think russia would n't put up a fight . 
  edit : also ; from which country 's military ministry did you get that opinion from ? 
  i make my claims on historical events and a bit of common sense ( i like to believe so anyway ) . 
  redirecting attention - check taking things out of context - check light hearted humour in this serious situation - check pop culture reference - check ah , yes . 
  the fact that two brits were first to respond merely confirms my claims . 
  welcome to 2017 : when brainwashing is easier than ever before . 
  checking some more sources one is surprised that all the outlets reporting from the scene are either anglo-saxon or american ( bbc , guardian , economist ) and just how out-proportionally well covered the event is . 
  why do we care about russia 's internal affairs , again ? 
  if only . 
  it was meant to be a discussion . 
  excuse my ignorance , then . 
  can you provide some source or something where the official stance of japanese government is declared ? 
  neither am i. i meant people in general . 
  there is an outcry both from the government officials and from the public for turkey to admit the genocide of the armenians yet no one bats an eye to japan . 
  i guess it 's because japanese victims were the chinese , the country which is ruled by communists and we all know our hegemon the us of a does not like those type of people . 
  paid provocateurs . 
  in one video i have watched putin has been very confident regarding his export of national resources required for heating . 
  does he really not believe there is a possibility of making them obsolete ? 
  will he chimp out , if done so ? 
  edit : [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/xdqdyt0b-1e ) is the video . 
  surprise anschluss .

  macedonia , damn . 
  they have good healthcare system according to a similair map i have seen on here and now this . 
  we suck . 
  how do you know that man was unemployed ? 
  why does this have so many upvotes yet so few comments ? 
  there should be a police guard in front of the place . 
  yeah . 
  i ca n't eat this . 
  it 's too much . 
  try harder . 
  [ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/betteridge's_law_of_headlines] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/betteridge's_law_of_headlines ), 
  why so black ? 
  this is getting absurd .
