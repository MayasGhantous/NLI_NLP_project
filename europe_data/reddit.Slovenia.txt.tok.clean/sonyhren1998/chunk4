  thanks for that , did not know . 
  am i the only one who finds it kind of ironic that they are against so called globalization and countries coming together internationally yet they seem to have no problem havig meetings with wilders , le pen , petri . 
  ave maria !, 
  jews and israel . 
  wait he is dead ? 
  madela effect all over again . 
  talk shit , get hit . 
  was n't slaugtering sheeps as offering a christian practice ? 
  why would you do that ? 
  it 's about the same thing , though . 
  [ here .

  why does this man get so much of media 's attention ? 
  what made you think that ? 
  french truly produced some great people . 
  chopin was already mentioned but the likes of descartes , voltaire and curie . 
  it seems that 's all they got on us . 
  we are too small and irrelevant for anything else to be noticed , it would seem . 
  first one , definitely . 
  second one is too ridiculous to get any reaction . 
  depressing , i would imagine . 
  sorry about that guys but [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/v50wbc5.jpg ) is higher resolution . 
  it 's a rule to draw them like that . 
  fascism and communism , it would seem . 
  edit : [ nevermind . 
  oh , do n't get it wrong . 
  if you drive through a gipsy village you can see the houses mentioned previously and shipping containers , wooden shacks all in a couple of hundred meters . 
  you can also see a huge pile of metal . 
  instead of attacking me , maybe you should n't eat everything media feeds you with . 
  get bent , city-dwellers . 
  never has there been a more glorious period for the people who despise the behaviour of those from country 's capital city . 
  i 'm pretty sure dandlions are n't called flowers here either . 
  take tulips for example . 
  similair here but not that luxurious . 
  you can see big , nice houses but not mansions . 
  so flower as a whole is flower but the top thing is also flower ? 
  [ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/betteridge's_law_of_headlines] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/betteridge's_law_of_headlines ), 
  til you can see bbc lozalized . 
  i have no idea . 
  it would depend on what gets classified as a `` terrorist attack '' . 
  at about 5:20 we have a young woman casually describing herself as a communist and offering the viewer some alternative facts about a made up story of a violent attack by the group the documentary stigmatizes from the beginning as a * far-right * , * extremists * , it 's members as * racist * . 
  the young woman ( wearing a nice adidas tracksuit ) seems to be doing it for attention purposes . 
  and that 's what she got indeed for i can not phantom i live in a world where calling oneself a fascist or a nazi is suicide and demonized beyond belief ( rightfully so ) but calling oneself communist goes by without notice . 
  and the last time i said polls are irrelevant and should be ignored i got downvoted . 
  [ we have it the same as the germans . 
   far-right documentary ah ... 
  as two other users have pointed out for their respective countries same applies here . 
  flower translates to ro\u017ea not cvet . 
  that would be the thing at the top . 
  edit : but then again if in context for example : `` flower of youth . '', 
  would be * cvet * . 
  maybe both are correct ? 
  fair enough . 
  that multiculturalism has been tried and is actively failing in front of our eyes . 
  unless you see as the need to have armed police or soldiers on the streets as a sign of things going well . 
  song is about the sack of rome in 1527 in which 189 swiss mercenaries held their ground and defended the papacy . 
  holy shit , man . 
  just the day before yesterday i have been watching [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssnxsydj9uo ) documentary from bbc about them . 
  highly recommend . 
   most are aware that the ` battle of hastings ' took place in 1066 , and that victory fell to william the illegitimate , with harold taking an arrow through the eye . 
  but what else ? 
  for those who did n't study history beyond high-school , this programme provided many answers . 
  it dilated upon the events leading up to the conflict . 
  we learnt about william 's precarious upbringing , his claim to english sovereignty and its temporary thwarting . 
   then ; what came afterwards ? 
  an amazing insight into the forcible transfer of land titles that saw 95 % pass from anglo-saxon possession into the hands of the normans . 
  it must have been a terrible , terrible period for our ancestors . 
  nobles became dependants , yeomen became slaves . 
  the reversals were unimaginable , on a par with the kind of ` ethnic cleansing ' recently witnessed in former yugoslavia . 
  england was at this time a mainly rural economy and culture , so despite the fact that normans were outnumbered perhaps 100:1 , once the royal hierarchy was suppressed , anglo-saxons became a pushover . 
   i was amazed to learn that the normans themselves were descendants from the very vikings who were still terrorising england at the time , having settled in france a century or two before . 
  a rebellion in the north of england saw an estimated 100,000 succumb to sword and starvation . 
  they did n't do retribution by halves in those days . 
   yet finally , after william died - mortally injured when his own obese belly was gashed open by his saddle - he was abandoned by his backers and left to be stripped by scavengers who even took his clothes . 
  how were the mighty fallen . 
  later , when an attempt was made to give him a decent burial , it was found that he would n't fit into his sarcophagus . 
  attempts to force him resulted in his already-putrescent abdomen bursting open and stinking the ceremony out . 
   there was a great deal more to this fascinating programme that left me with very mixed feelings about my ancestors and their treatment of each other . 
  i did n't know whether to hate the normans or crow over the saxons , not knowing whose blood flows in my veins . 
  some of each , i suppose . 
  and maybe a bit of roman too . 
   well researched and highly recommended . 
  there 's not enough of these tremendous programmes on tv today .

  that applies mostly to the media . 
  flair checks out . 
  it looks amazing !, 
  good on you neighbours . 
  terrorism itself is almost a non-problem . 
  it 's the way media reports on it that 's the real bitch . 
  all i am saying is there is nothing surprising here . 
  nothing to be outraged about . 
  why should n't they be allowed to conceal their casualty ratio ? 
  and how do we know media is not misleading us ? 
  this is something every country in history has done . 
  i 'm so tired of this . 
  has to end . 
  this is getting ridiculous . 
  was there response from n. sturgeon ?
