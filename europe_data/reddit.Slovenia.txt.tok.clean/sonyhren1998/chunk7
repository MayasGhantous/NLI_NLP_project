  diaspora is real . 
  yeah , but he asked quite politely . 
  was he instructed to say the phrase `` weapon of mass destruction '' a certain number of times ? 
  this is amazingly cute . 
  i hope he was n't too mad after . 
  no special event or anything that made me post that . 
  simply wanted to share with you this bad-ass anthem . 
  germans eventually found their way in . 
  stronk edit : #slovenian ~ ~ century ~ ~ fiveminutes # ~ ~ superpower ~ ~ stablecountryby ~ ~ 2030 ~ ~ 2100, 
  we have been reminded yesterday . 
  so you argue that balkans reach into central europe ? 
  and this one is wrong why exactly compared to yours ? 
  fucking guardian . 
  god !, 
  you can have only one installed . 
  [ as promised . 
  there are no nationalities on the internet . 
  maybe bitdefender is the best antivirus program but what has romania got to do with it ? 
  i hate it when people try to drag nationalism into the internet . 
  just as i find americans claiming reddit toxic to the whole internet community i feel no different about this . 
  trojan horse inside europe . 
  i do n't even know what to report this as . 
  i will debunk your argument with a map tomorrow . 
  da da , the almighy google has it all right . 
  what is this shit ? 
  people actually advertise this commie shithole . 
  not a common held opinion , considering how small it is , it would seem . 
   you can really see the war in ukraine ** was ** was no joke it is still going on . 
  do n't be a wehraboo . 
  sorry for my first post then . 
  you should have included it in the title , though . 
  not so long ago this feature used to be seen as a joke . 
  and it was english voice to english text so yeah . 
  did n't expect for it to be good . 
  you mean voice to text translation ? 
  is that reliable ? 
  never use it myself . 
  you do realize not everybody understands dutch ? 
  edit : voice-to-text translation confirmed as decent by op . 
  how was the data gathered ? 
  by checking if there was a fb group demanding independence ? 
  are secession movements registered somewhere ? 
  active ones ? 
  catalonia . 
  period . 
  define `` secession movement '' , please . 
  seems to me some people really enjoy at the thought of seeing europe break up considering the spam of these type of maps on here . 
  the fucking savages we are . 
  we have been through this before and are n't the only one .

  red parts in slovenia are serbians . 
  not as fast or as scenic as the norweigan version , but still nice . 
  looks like kebab . 
  why is eu interfering , even ? 
  macedonia is not an eu mem and i think we should n't be playing a policeman . 
  looks terrible . 
  the clouds are rather dark , too . 
  is that edited ? 
  like some color correction or something ? 
  [ this ] ( http://m.imgur.com/uufvcnt ) is what we had yesterday . 
  never looked at it that way . 
  interesting observation . 
  average slovenian would be a decent , hard-working man . 
  not the dominant type of guy but the one who keeps to himself . 
  a bit submissive , even . 
  does n't talk about his problems . 
  when i think of austria i think of a weird middle aged perverted male who is full blown racist and sadist . 
  thinks he is better than others and is in general full of himself . 
  there is still a communist party ? 
  and it ranks third ? 
  gold-worthy . 
  til there is a town called gorizia right next bo nova gorica . 
  why is there a fence ? 
  because of the railroad ? 
  does n't go well with the spirit of eu 's open borders . 
  is there a chance the cities will merge in the future ? 
  seems a bit odd considering he conquered parts of today 's italy . 
  or is it a statement that corsica belongs to italy ? 
  consequences of the great casualties of the soviet union in ww 2 . 
  [ why not link the image directly ? 
  what have turks got to do with communism ? 
  edit : credit to / u/trax1 : meanwhile in czechoslovakia three men talk in a cell about the reasons why they got imprisoned : - they locked me up because i always got to work late . 
  they accused me of being a western saboteur . 
  - i got locked up because i always got to work early . 
  they accused me of being a western spy . 
  - i got locked up because i always got to work on time . 
  they accused me of having western clocks . 
  must be humbling seeing that every day . 
  amazing . 
   neil degrasse tyson is that guy legit ? 
  he is on / r/iamverysmart all the time . 
  high unemployment rates . 
  people are moving to germany , ireland . 
  we are doing surprisingly well considering all the media attention to people moving out . 
  although the map data is 2001-2011 . 
  thanks for the follow-up . 
  is there a danish minority living in the mentioned area ? 
  i do n't dig the design . 
  even worse then . 
  a handful of people with the ability to modify the data which millions use as a go-to source of information .
