  it 's bbc . 
  of course they are going to say that . 
  i will believe it when i see russian government say it . 
  clearly no evidence can be produced . 
   the lack of sophistication also seems at odds with the kremlin 's reputation for being a master of disinformation and media warfare . 
  it 's like two bullies trying to exonorate themselves by saying the other is the devil . 
  edit : [ could n't help myself . 
  [ image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/n1jj23u.png ) instead of a link to a subreddit where there is a link to twitter . 
  ah , yes . 
  wikipedia . 
  the ultimate beacon of truth and knowledge . 
  not like anyone can write what he wants . 
  you linked an image . 
  they do n't invade other european countries . 
  invasion of another country is never acceptable . 
  it 's just the was you said it as if one was acceptable . 
  lol, 
  that was wholesome . 
  top notch banter . 
  austria has also been meddling with rights of slovenian minority lately . 
  there was a similair video where people gave their opinions on europe and it 's position in the world . 
  ca n't find it right now . 
  anyone else ? 
  poland too !, 
  there are a lot of europeans on that sub , though . 
  first you have 28 countries that are members of the eu sorted by alphabet ( slovenian , bite me ) then you just have the rest of the countries in europe , excluding the micro-states . 
  absolutely not . 
  i 'm sure there are plenty of americans who claim irish heritage subscribed to / r/ireland . 
  hell , even i am subscribed . 
  but when it comes to non-english subreddits things are different . 
  sure , there are posts in english but i myself could n't keep up with it so i eventually unsubscribed from all other countries 's subreddits except for the irish and the uk 's one . 
  so yeah , i think the vast majority of subscribers are speakers of the language if not natives ( / r/de for example ) . 
  ... is right below the column which it represents . 
  either help yourself with the flags or with the text . 
  one or the other . 
  looks good but with polish subtitles and in general poland-related stuff most of the video went by me . 
  what is really funny is that in the light of recent events/news i ca n't even tell whether this is a joke or not . 
  flags are exactly below each column . 
  but yeah , i see how it gets weird next to the text . 
  are you serious ? 
  why does it bother you if i posted an updated version ? 
  bollocks . 
  i do n't know how i 've missed that . 
  yeah . 
  almost 20k subscribers with population of 300k . 
  there 's a good chance one of your school mates is a redditor in iceland . 
  slovenians on europe-related subreddits are the worst , i swear . 
  seriously ? 
  some of them do n't have own subreddits . 
  i have added flags and all european countries ( excluding micro-states ) instead of just the ones that are in the european union . 
  those images explain [ this map ] ( https://i.redd.it/7ygaeyqwxftx.png ) to people who are n't from countries of ex-yu . 
  3323 subscribers as percentage of population of 10\u00a0553\u00a0843 people makes it 0,03 .

  get this 4chan-level photoshop away from here !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ russian ^ ^ ^ ^ ambassadors ^ ^ ^ ^ are ^ ^ ^ ^ dropping ^ ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ ^ flies ^ ^ ^ ^ recently . 
  on a more serious note : rest in peace . 
  whether you think they are in europe or not they are welcomed in this sub . 
  fun fact : the manager of the team whose player was abused was fired from a slovenian football club nearly a year ago because of racist slurs after he was recorded saying : `` gledaj idiota crnog ! '', 
  ( you black idiot ! ), 
  because the player in question celebrated a goal even though his team was n't winning . 
  here we go again ... 
  modern slaves . 
  lol he made the news . 
  i do n't think much would change in the example you provided . 
  both czechia and slovakia are in the eu , v4 . 
  czechs did not ( yet ) adopt the euro currency , unlike the slovaks so there are some differences where an agreement would have to be reached . 
  i 'm pretty sure people would stop confusing us with slovakia then , so yeah , there is that . 
  [ we went throught this before . 
  ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5n5jwz/borut_pahor_president_of_slovenia_and_his/ ), 
  yeah , `` the center '' does not sound nearly as badass as `` the north '' or `` the south '' . 
  what can you do . 
  hahah , i guess it could be seen as such to a foreigner but here it is something completely normal . 
  they even come to schools and perform . 
  i have only seen it [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/cvvd-9azd1m ) before . 
  the actress who voiced the green dinosaur died ~ ~ not so long ago ~ ~ . 
  edit : her name was [ judith barsi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/judith_barsi ) and she died in 1888 actually . 
  it was not so long ago that i have seen bunch of people caring about her death that made me believe it was recently . 
   carnival time in the oldest slovenian town . 
  the carnival is a traditional event in ptuj , rooted in pagan mysticism with ethnographic characters and topical satirical carnival masks . 
  every year between candlemas and ash wednesday , there is a season of pust . 
  kurent is the most important ethnographic character of pust that chases away the winter and everything that is bad , but attracts spring , happiness and a good harvest.for the residents of the city and its surroundings the masking is a part of their identity , part of a personal mantra , mystical bond and escape from the everyday life . 
   carnival is a series of events in three sets artfest , etnofest and karnevalfest . 
  all the life is taking place around the traditional carnival masks and original fantasy characters . 
  kurentovanje is a unique event with many ethnographic and carnival parades during days and nights , carnival promenade and presentations of ethnographic characters , concerts , dances in masks and much more . 
  carnival hall , our concert center , invites thousands of masks enjoying their entertainment in rhythms of live music . 
  this year 's 57th kurentovanje will be held from 17 to 28 february 2017 . 
  thanks for a new wallpaper !, 
  it 's pat and mat . 
  how would you go about making v4 countries do that ? 
  pat in mat iz a je to . 
  nope . 
  are there any new non-american cartoons on tv anymore ? 
  all i remember is tmnt , winx club ... 
  was czechoslovakia the ultimate cartoon producer ? 
  i guess i should change it to : `` and from people who are n't from sweden but know more about it than people who are from there . '', 
  the comment section has been overrun by people from what seems like the opposite spectrum that was present here befre it reached the front page of this subredddit . 
  what do you mean ? 
  at the time i wrote that comment the top comment was from a guy from norway saying something avout the countries that chose israel as the biggest threat to world peace . 
  i never said that it is only americans who have issue with mass immigration .
