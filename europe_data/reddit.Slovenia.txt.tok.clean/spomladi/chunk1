  they only indoctrinate kids in madrasas , right ? 
  no , yugoslavia was very encouraging about people moving to the western capitalist countries , all that parasites in charge needed was convertible currency , which they got via remittances . . 
  the legal immigrants that singapore gets and the illegal immigrants that we ( eu ) get are worlds apart . 
  singapores immigrants do better in school than native population ( oecd pisa - below ) , whereas here it is the opposite , and let 's no even start on drop out rate , employment rates for non eu , criminality ... https://www.reddit.com/r/slovenia/comments/5gw93u/oecd_programme_for_international_student/ we should learn from singapore , as in no illegal immigration .

  this is such bullshit , at least separate eu migrants and people coming from outside eu . 
  europoors : in 2015 , the activity rate of mobile eu citizens was 4 pp higher than that of the nationals , indicating greater labour market participation for this group of migrants . 
  in 2015 , the activity rate of non-eu citizens amounted to 69.8 % ( a decrease compared with 70.5 % in 2014 ) . 
  there is an opposite trend amongst mobile eu citizens , for whom the activity rate increased from 81.3 % in 2014 to 81.6 % in 2015 . 
  `` others '' in 2015 , the unemployment rate of non-eu citizens was 18.9 % . 
  in 2015 , the highest unemployment rates for non-eu citizens , with around one out of three active non-eu citizens , were reported in spain ( 32.9 % ) , greece ( 31.7 % ) , sweden ( 29.3 % ) and france ( 25.4 % ) .

  article ** germans detect hand of russia as political cyber war escalates ** bundestag hack heightens fears moscow is seeking to influence next year 's elections the moment german mp hans-christian str\u00f6bele discovered his electronic data might have been raided in a 2015 cyber attack on the bundestag is seared on his memory . 
  if the initial attack on parliament 's lower house sent shockwaves through the german political and intelligence establishment , it has since become apparent that its implications could be far worse . 
  claims from the cia , the us intelligence agency , that it has `` high confidence '' russian hackers tried to influence the us election in favour of donald trump have boosted fears that moscow is targeting next year 's german polls , when chancellor angela merkel is standing for re-election . 
  german security officials have said last year 's assault on the bundestag 's computer network was also carried out by russia-backed hackers seeking ammunition for electoral meddling . 
  earlier this month , ms merkel warned that there were signs of internet-based attacks and misinformation campaigns coming from russia that could `` play a role in the election campaign '' . 
  the government has reacted to the bundestag attack with a complete overhaul of the parliament 's computer systems . 
  but it is also throwing its weight into increasing defences against cyber warfare more broadly , in response to a rising numbers of attacks and the threat of escalation -- such as the possible sabotage of government institutions and utilities such as power plants . 
  the defence ministry has stepped up its electronic warfare capabilities with the creation of a new 13,500-strong cyber unit , due to be fully operational by mid-2017 . 
  berlin 's concerns are shared with other eu states , notably france , which holds a presidential election next year . 
  eu officials fear europe could be more vulnerable to interference than the us because of its wider political and economic connections to russia , significant russian-speaking minorities in some countries including germany and president vladimir putin 's support for rightwing populist parties across europe . 
  stefan meister , a russia expert at the german council for foreign relations , says that as in the us , cyber attacks could be combined with social media manipulation and political support for the russia-friendly populist and eurosceptic alternative for germany party . 
  `` russian interference in german politics has already started , '' says mr meister . 
  `` every country has the right to promote its interests in another country . 
  but russia has a programme that includes grey tactics and illegal tactics . '' the federal verfassungsschutz , germany 's domestic intelligence agency , has accused russian secret services of backing the hackers responsible for the bundestag attack . 
  the agency blames the breach on a group of hackers known as apt 28 , which european and us intelligence officials regard as moscow-backed . 
  us officials have said the same group , and a related one called apt 29 , hacked the democratic campaign offices ahead of the us presidential election and copied thousands of files . 
  these included emails from hillary clinton , the defeated democratic candidate , which were later also published on wikileaks . 
  wikileaks also recently published sensitive german government documents on us-german intelligence co-operation , which officials fear may have come from the bundestag hack . 
  the interior ministry says germany needs resilient computer systems to withstand attacks , effective intelligence work and citizens that are aware of the potential dangers , including the risk that stolen information could be used to influence opinion . 
  but there is wide concern that the population remains insufficiently prepared . 
  mr str\u00f6bele , an opposition green mp , says he has increased his own security , including using encrypted links for sensitive phone calls . 
  the precaution only works if the person on the other side of the call does the same however . 
  `` colleagues have also taken precautions . 
  but not enough in my view , '' he says . 
  thomas de maizi\u00e8re , interior minister , has warned germany must be ready for attacks from all sources , including private organisations and criminal groups as well as states such as russia and china . 
  last month , for example , an assault on deutsche telekom caused network problems for 900,000 customers , with officials citing criminals among potential suspects . 
  thyssenkrupp , the steelmaker , which disclosed this month that hackers who stole sensitive data were likely to have been based in southeast asia , said bluntly : `` it is currently virtually impossible to provide viable protection against organised , highly professional , hacking attacks . '' mr str\u00f6bele , who takes a critical view of western as well as non-western intelligence activities , argues that us as well as chinese and russian hackers pose a risk to germany . 
  but government officials say the threat from russia is of a different order because of its suspected state backing , sophisticated interaction with the media and social media and apparent clear political purpose . 
  stephan mayer , the parliamentary interior affairs spokesman for ms merkel 's ruling cdu/csu bloc , sums up the fears , warning : `` it is russia 's intention to destabilise the german government and so weaken our democracy . '' cyber attacks , including `` the kind that in russian doctrine '' are called hybrid warfare , now `` belong to normal daily life '' , warns ms merkel herself , adding : `` we must learn to manage this . '' ***** germans vote for merkel !!, 
  i am slovenian and and i am trying to undermine your trust in msm and in eu `` democratic institutions '' ... 
  please do n't give russians all the credit !, 
  `` right '' `` journalists '' `` report '' and `` explain facts . '', 
  cat was pretty feel-ly . 
  here is the whole paragraph from may 's speach :  we all know the stories about the human rights act . 
  the ** violent drug dealer who can not be sent home because his daughter -- for whom he pays no maintenance -- lives here . 
  ** the robber who can not be removed because he has a girlfriend . 
  * the illegal immigrant who can not be deported because -- and i am not making this up -- he had a pet cat . 
  * hopefully they will disprove the part of the robber and the illegal immigrant . 
  tl ; dr : in any event , schauble continues to believe that a complete collapse of the currency union is unacceptable for germany , as the newly reconstituted deutsche mark would be considerably more valuable than the euro ; seriously damaging germany 's export driven economy . 
  if you really want to see how useless the illegal immigrants are you should look at oecd pisa studies about school achievement . 
  ( look at my history for a link ) . 
  eu had a same report about recent called ( something like ) europe schooling/future . . ? 
  also the best data , and the easiest ( because they are in english ) to find is employment data for uk where certain migrant groups are completely useless . 
  eu also has employment data for native born , foreigner from eu , and third county immigrants ... oecd again has a lot of data ... 
  if you really want much better data i suggest looking at employment numbers , because when it comes to crimes - data is fuzzy , hard to get , some countries have stopped collecting data on nationalities , religions ... 
  great tax rates . 
  publish the tax rate of eu bureaucrats . 
  exactly , because us companies are repatriating it to us . 
  secondly , this was shillarys position : [ `` hillary clinton hints at giant , trump-like giveaway to corporate america '' ] ( https://theintercept.com/2016/06/27/hillary-clinton-hints-at-giant-trump-like-giveaway-to-corporate-america/ ) , so basically the same . 
  almost hilarious :  there is another defect to the european union that can not be remedied . 
  it is made up of democracies . 
  that is a requirement for membership .
