more young people to stem fields !, 
  ^ ( sorry , i waited years to say something mean to them . ), 
  what would a socialist report on refugees be without a nazi reference snuck in ? 
  because macaron is no food . 
  slovenia : got ta be ww2 . 
  maybe turkish raids come close . 
  istria : [ uskok war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uskok_war#aftermath ) . 
  seems istria was basically a training ground for the carnage that was 30-years war . 
  probably , but just in case : false independence , actually a german/italian condominium . 
  fascist government that managed to plunge the country into an ethnic and civil war in a matter of weeks by being horrifically and needlessly brutal . 
  `` allies '' who behave like occupiers , whose idea of counter-insurgency is burning and killing everything , and who promote resistance groups in order to further destabilize the country . 
  war that descended into an endless spiral of massacres and counter-massacres and which ended , fittingly , with one more huge massacre . 
  some 8 % of population dead . 
  that 's quite a lot of reasons to hate that period . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ljhl7/ this has all the makings of a meme . 
  actually my source was a family friend who was in kurdistan in a doctors without borders mission , but ok , i guess he might have got the wrong impression . 
  but wtf at the reason for fgm . 
  just wtf . 
  i guess those places need more schools . 
  ehh , i moved in the middle of the worst phase of our `` border conflict '' ( cabinet rop/jan \u0161a i , podobnik bros. 
  etc. ), 
  and anti-croatian sentiment was at an all-time high . 
  plus slovenia was just getting into eu and the right wing had pipe dreams of importing workers from slovakia instead of ex-yu . 
  but i got ta give credit to regular slovenes . 
  except for few isolated incident when village idiots tried to start fights , i never had any problem with anyone because of my nationality . 
  absolutely no , but rules are meant to be enforced afaik . 
  think of it as an initiation rite . 
  if you manage to wade through all the bureaucratic bullshit without becoming an asshole , you have proven yourself worthy of belonging to the local community . 
  unlike that `` too many spaghetti '' guy , who 'll remain on the margins of society for life . 
  pilsner urquell , dark pls . 
  i could live on that beer alone :d, 
  not sure if it 's from `` conscript '' or `` new kid on the block '' though . 
  right . 
  my lame joke has failed , gentlemen , sorry for wasting your time . 
  originally from ~ ~ croatia ~ ~ mordor . 
  i waited two months to get temporary residence . 
  once i got it , i had to go through all the paperwork to extend it every six months . 
  the banks would n't give me limit , the cell-phone operator would n't give me any other option than pre-paid . 
  and every border i wanted to cross , i had to wait in the crowded line for `` non-eu residents '' . 
  i am an idiot . 
  it 's how this chuck norris ends his video . 
  `` hungary is a bad choice - \u00c1sotthalom is the worst . '', 
  it 's not like there has been a hundred years of low-level warfare , with periodical flare-ups , over kurdish question . 
  \u00c1sotthalom is the * worst * . 
  they cut clits off like there 's no tomorrow . 
  i have no illusions about kurds . 
  i just want them to get their country so that the region can have one less problem . 
  croatian refugees in the 90 's were getting no money at all . 
  okay , let 's look from the perspective of my native country , croatia : * serbian - perfect * bosnian - native-level * montenegrin - like i was born with that language * slovene - almost perfect * italian ( maritime border ) - aaaalmost perfect , but i ca n't practice it in daily life * hungarian - `` gula\u0161 kerem . '', 
  and that 's it then , right ? 
  assad is the last of the old arab-socialist guard , is n't he ? 
  i was against the overthrow of gaddafi from day one , it always seemed to me like something that would backfire epically . 
  seriously , why did they remove him in the first place ? 
  but maybe he 'd have a successor . 
  this way his country simply disintegrated . 
  that 's [ johanna s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%b3hanna_sigur%c3%b0ard%c3%b3ttir ) . 
  she specializes in girl/girl and striptease . 
  and then everybody 'll call croatia a fascist country , pulling out of dustbin stadium swastikas , op storm and ww2 . 
  okay , vu\u010di\u0107 actually made me lol with that `` the eagle has fallen '' quote . 
  for those who do n't know , he was referring to [ this scene ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lff1cbdqnoa ) . 
  [ norway ] ( http://www.freeones.com/html/n_links/nanna_gibson/ ) [ finland ] ( http://www.freeones.com/html/a_links/anna_sucks/ ) [ greece ] ( http://www.freeones.com/html/v_links/vannah_sterling/ ) [ iceland ] ( http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-02/02/xin_4120206020855406156838.jpg ) [ ireland ] ( http://www.freeones.com/html/m_links/mary_jane_monroe/ ), 
  right . 
  [ here you go , auntie angela ] ( http://www.freeones.com/html/index_prof.shtml?country=180&amp;profession=p ) . 
  maybe . 
  and maybe not . 
  and that , children , is where the gypsies come from . 
  muh colonialism, 
  [ even more , mate , even more . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0w_asypf0g ), 
  there are two countries they want to swarm into : germany and sweden . 
  out of 15000 people who crossed into croatia , just one family asked for asylum . 
  up until now , every incident happened only when someone tried to stop refugees from marching on to germany . 
  so why should croatia use army against people who are just passing through ? 
  omg , a jewish right-wing party has a ~ ~ propaganda machine ~ ~ think tank !, 
  intolerable !, 
  1 ) this guy seems like a random idiot , like one of those street preachers that everybody avoids in a wide circle . 
  2 ) `` europe is old and decrepit . '', 
  yeah , yeah , we all know that , people have been repeating the same shit since hesiodus , like , 3000 years ago , and we 're still here . 
  3 ) `` send them , or we will send our armies to you '' . 
  um , the best weaponry money can buy , the experience of repelling multiple islamic invasions and even conquering the whole world , and 450 active nukes ... yeah , i do n't think you really want to do that . 
  all your border crossings on austria are now belong to syria . 
  deal with it , ti gorenjski pizdun . 
  solving refugee crisis . 
  he said croatia is not in state of war , that army is still under control of mod , and that nobody wants shooting on the border . 
  and why would turkey honor these agreements ? 
  because otherwise we wo n't let turkey into eu ? 
  shit wrapped in tinfoil , popularly known as vilibor . 
  they are not letting it spiral out of control this time . 
  recently a group of idiots proposed introducing the fascist salute into the army . 
  the right-wing president cut that shit off without even blinking . 
  militia movement strong , down with illuminati , stay clear of tap water and never take off your tinfoil hat . 
  milanovi\u0107 carefully calculates his every move . 
  the only problem is that his calculations are usually wrong . 
   pobit \u0107u vas sve  pobi\u0107u vas sve spot the difference . 
  2/10 not pathetic enough do you think the righties will ever succeed in expanding it with the second verse ( the * god help our land , god help all slovene world * one ) ? 
  not good , i 'm tone deaf . 
  now this just begs for a citation . 
  twelve years in slovenia and i 've still never been there . 
  i need to fix that and soon . 
  border troops were under kgb command and one needed to pass selection to be conscripted into them .
