  something like this is not supposed to happen in our free and independent croatia ! '', 
  one of the pensioners notices tu\u0111man crying and approaches one of the policement in the escort : `` can you tell me why is our president crying ? '', 
  policeman pulls out the baton and starts beating him : `` because of you , motherfucker , because of you ! '', 
  meeting of truth in ljubljana , never forget . 
  but yeah , we love you . 
  we also hate you . 
  but we both love and hate you less than we love and hate croatia . 
  i would call you `` worst friends '' . 
  it is made of gender and income equality . 
  there , there , it 'll be okay . 
  here , have a slovenia-shaped cookie . 
  you 'd be surprised how little that matters there . 
  if refugees can do it so can we , right ? 
  it 's amazing how some people consistently choose the most stupid option available . 
  i already left croatia and i do n't intend to go back . 
  the events of last couple of years only confirm my case . 
  my grandpa fought fascists and risked his life to unite my home region with croatia ; there 's no way in hell i 'm going to take orders from the same fascists . 
  at first my emigration was only for economic/educational reasons . 
  but unless something drastic happens with croatia and its people , i 'm going to keep considering my own homeland as a political basket case . 
  damn , this is depressing . 
  okay , then do it as it was always done : rent a hall , open your house if you want your precious safe space . 
  you ca n't just sit on public property and say : `` this is safe space now , no dissent allowed . '', 
  so much sisu in one post . 
  i like it . 
  i 'm okay with that . 
  on the other hand , if you and a couple of your friends stood in front of my business and harassed customers , that would be overly pc . 
  is n't that the guy that refused to follow orders to stop the russian tanks in kosovo by force ? 
  the `` i will not start the wwiii for you '' guy ? 
  well , talk about looks can be deceiving . 
  citation sorely needed . 
  ira , eta , baader-meinhof , rz , fatah , pflp ... all left-wing . 
  i 'm seriously curious , what were germany/usa/australia trying to gain by hosting all those usta\u0161as ? 
  while i was on vacation in mostar my apartment was literally next to a mosque , the top of the minaret was parallel to my window . 
  i did n't wake up once because of the morning prayer call . 
  oh yeah , i did notice it when i arrived , but after two days it became just another background noise , like church bells . 
  i was in budva once , some 15 years ago . 
  i found the old town amazingly beautiful , almost a smaller version of dubrovnik , but the drawback was that it smelled of piss literally everywhere . 
  okay ... 
  if we are generous and take that slovenia exists since 1918 , then it 's been : * one undeclared small border war ( 1919 , against austria ) * one world war ( 1941-45 , mostly against wrong slovenians ) * one undeclared small war of independence ( 1991 , against yugoslavia ), 
  well , serbia and croatia fought one ( 1 ) single war before 1914 . 
  up until then it always somehow turned out you were on the same side . 
  10k refugees that could n't wait to get repatriated in a country of a billion people / 1m refugees that never want to go back in a country of 80m people . 
  yup , totally the same thing . 
  being sent into a faraway country that is a colony of your ally / sneaking or violently breaking through multiple borders to get to another faraway country . 
  totally the same thing . 
  a total war that kills a fifth of your country 's population / not being able to find a well-paying job in kosovo or algeria ( does n't apply to those from actual war zones ) . 
  totally the same thing . 
  and i 'd really like to know how far were polish refugees allowed to wander from their camps . 
  and how much trouble did they cause to the locals . 
  america has been just about to become great again for about 50-60 years now . 
  was genocide , was n't holocaust . 
  again , holocaust is genocide of jews in ww2 . 
  that does n't mean nothing else happened . 
  hey , just the visit to auschwitz has haunted me for a while . 
  especially the window with cut-off hair , combined with a sudden chilly thought `` my great uncle 's hair is somewhere there too . '', 
  holocaust is , by definition , the genocide of jews , that happened concurrently with a ton of other massacres and crimes . 
  do n't think for a second i do n't appreciate all of the victims of nazism . 
  half of my family , from both slovene and croatian side , died in mauthausen and auschwitz for being relatives of partisans . 
  my grandparents still have their photos and documents . 
  nobody is stopping you from remembering those victims too and raise awareness about them . 
  but leave holocaust alone . 
  okay , the only two peoples that were singled out for extermination were the jews and roma . 
  slavs were getting killed a lot , but they were generally supposed to become slaves to germans . 
  about communists - well , no one was forcing them to stay communist . 
  and i do n't know if homosexuality was considered to be a lifestyle choice or not back then . 
  in any case , among tons of people that nazis killed jews have a special place and rightly so . 
  only roma can claim a similar place , but let 's be realistic , most people would n't bat an eye if tomorrow they started killing gypsies . 
  please tomislav , do n't give speeches again . 
  you 're embarrassing yourself . 
  because it 's the only time in history a country developed a full fledged industry meant just for killing a particular ethnic group . 
  just googled the guy and ... * facepalm * jeez , and i thought our politicians were a mess . 
  oh no , i 'm not saying that , it just makes it easier to see why would catholics/nationalists support * their * terrorists despite them causing only mayhem ultimately . 
  because compared to those dicks , even ira looks like a bunch of saints . 
  edit : by the way , did n't the government give them pretty much a free pass to fuck shit up for years ? 
  unlike uda/uvf , which were just [ plain evil ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/shankill_butchers ) . 
  he 's such an idiot , pure cringe comedy . 
  hey czechs , remind me , why exactly did you vote this guy into office ? 
  do n't know , could be . 
  what i know is `` rjuti '' explanation , or that it comes from `` rujno vino '' ( although it seems to me that it 's actually in reverse , that `` rujno vino '' comes from `` rujan '' , like `` september wine '' ), 
  nope , it 's good . 
  etymology : * sije\u010danj - probably from * sje\u0107i * - to cut down ( trees ) * velja\u010da - probably from * velji * - bigger ( as in bigger , longer days . 
  it 's very archaic ) * o\u017eujak - either from * la\u017e * - lie ( as in lying , changeable weather ) or * laziti * - crawl ( the grass `` crawls '' up from the ground ) * travanj - from * trava * - grass * svibanj - from * svib * - dogwood * lipanj - from * lipa * - linden * srpanj - from * srp * - sickle ( the `` harvest month '' ) * kolovoz - from * kola * + * voziti * - to drive a wagon ( the month for transporting the hay away from fields ) * rujan - from * rjuti * - to roar ( archaic ; alludes to deers roaring during their mating season ) * listopad - from `` list '' + `` padati '' - the falling of leaves * studeni - literally means `` the cold one '' * prosinac - either from `` prositi '' - to beg ( because of advent traditions ) , or from `` prosinuti '' - to flash through ( because of winter solstice , the shortest day of year ), 
  who says europe ca n't grow them back ? 
  i can tell what worked for the balkans . 
  basically you need a strong and educated elite that promotes nationalism . 
  now , there are several problems even with that . 
  first , that was pretty much what arab socialism/nasserism/baathism attempted , and those ideologies are now discredited . 
  second , those elites would have to be educated in the west , and our universities are right now big on pos-modern post-colonialist post-everything bullshit that is n't of much help with engendering civic pride and is basically validating their worst tendencies . 
  third , even with that it would be a long and arduous process , with many setbacks . 
  i 'm talking centuries . 
  ultimately , nobody can do it for them but themselves . 
  or relearns toughness . 
  seems i have a bad english day . 
  whatever , i 'm not editing the comment , let it sink . 
  i guess the trouble is in english being neither mine nor yours first language . 
   ( it 's cheaper , less efficient , and impossible to attempt to ` marshal industry for war ' as in the past ) this sentence made it sound like * marshaling industry * was * cheaper * than the other option , while being at the same time both less efficient and impossible xd . 
  but okay , i got what you intended to say . 
  for about 3000 years now , if i 'm not mistaken , everybody and their mama is trying to come to europe . 
  so please tell me the news here . 
  there is no tragedy , there is no apocalypse , we wo n't crumble , we 'll do the same thing we always did : adapt .
