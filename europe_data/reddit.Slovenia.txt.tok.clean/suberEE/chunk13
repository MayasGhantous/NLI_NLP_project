  we 'll never completely get rid of it , we can only keep on destroying the most dangerous factions as they appear . 
  how about this ? 
  an all-union anti-isis task force , meant exclusively for preventing their attacks and breaking up their internal infrastructure , to be disbanded as soon as the threat ceases to be acute ? 
  yeah , that mahdi business sounds kinda shia . 
  i wo n't say hiroshima , so i 'll say dresden . 
  i 'm so goddamn delighted . 
  i 'm jumping in joy . 
  edit : / s, 
  israeli-palestinian war is quite ongoing . 
  bosnia is a frozen conflict , and it 's just a matter of time before it flares up again . 
  it 's actually worth reading . 
  no pro-putin propaganda , and this guy knows what he 's talking about . 
  that 's right , glorious rakija does n't turn white when diluted . 
  and who in their right minds puts water in rakija anyway ? 
  can confirm . 
  those areas are quite easy to spot though : houses look like shit , often unfinished , but there 's a mercedes in every courtyard . 
  what 's it with mountain tribes always being all aggressive and everything ? 
  i mean , on croatian side the effort was being led by herzegovinians , who are pretty much catholic montenegrins all things considered . 
  nah , it means frontier too but quite early it came to mean `` country '' too ( bela krajina , kninska krajina etc. ) . 
  today krajina is also archaic , the modern word is pokrajina, 
  [ kosovo is bulgaria !, 
  which basically means `` land '' . 
  who 'd ever guess that name would appear more that once ? 
  because how else would you get ripped off by vodafone ?

  forget it , there is no way to fence off the bosnian border . 
  i guess they just got bored electing presidents every other year . 
  well , good for you . 
  i 've read more than enough posts about those pesky , inbred , racist , bible-thumping , gun-toting southerners who are shame of america and did n't change a bit since civil war . 
  well , in the balkans we turn that music up to 11 . 
  i do n't always pick trash , but when i do , it 's european . 
  do you like rednecks ? 
  i said effective . 
  and peshmerga are kurds too . 
  i could say the same about veneto , you know . 
  especially if we 're talking latin america . 
  so , basically , the church owns schools and all expenses are paid by the government ? 
  i 'd make that deal . 
  damn good deal . 
  we have a similar arrangement here in slovenia ( government pays for 85 % of expenses , the rest is financed by church and tuitions ) , but they can only enrol a limited number of students at school director 's discretion . 
  otherwise they must n't discriminate by religion . 
  ( on the other hand , slovene catholic schools have two obligatory masses a year , which pushes away muslims , and since we basically have no militant atheists , the problem solves itself . 
  for now . ), 
  goddammit america , how dare you back the only effective anti-isis force in the region ? 
  think of your allies !, 
  who finances those schools ? 
  so here we have three french guys arguing over how higher education is organized in france . 
  if that is n't telling ... 
  :p fixed that for you . 
  why not ? 
  i know a bosnian serb girl named edina . 
  ( granted , she was born during glorious brotherhood and unity ^ ( tm ) , but still . ), 
  in spring of '91 hdz ( croatian ruling party ) deliberately provoked an incident in east slavonia , which caused the rebellion of serbs in that area - it was relatively peaceful up to that point despite the tension . 
  then they killed the local police chief , who was desperately trying to calm the situation . 
  when your goal is to rally the ethnic majority behind your party , a bit of bloodshed goes a long way . 
  arguing whose march is superior and more melodic . 
  does n't get more german than this . 
  pretty much , yeah . 
  they based much of their legitimacy on them liberating the country . 
  ww2 in yugoslavia was usually explained like `` people 's liberation war ^ ( and socialist revolution ) '' . 
  check my post above , i found those books . 
  second battle of kosovo and great serb migration ( aka getting removed by kebab ) . 
  why , that 's count k\u00e1roly khuen-h\u00e9derv\u00e1ry , viceroy of croatia between 1883 and 1903 . 
  his long reign brought some much needed investments into croatian industry . 
  he was also trying hard to destroy any kind of croatian autonomy , rigging elections , jailing political opponents or destroying their careers , trampling on freedom of press etc. 
  he liked croatia so much that , when emperor visited zagreb once , he took pains to bring a trainload of hungarian dirt to cover the railway station and the town square with , so that his majesty would n't set his noble foot on croatian soil . 
  of course he was also trying to introduce hungarian as the official language , and when parliament did n't approve of it , he did it anyway in state institutions by decree . 
  he was so beloved that he stepped down only after he caused a full-scale rebellion with his dictatorship . 
  but the worst part is this : since croats universally hated him , he decided to ally with serbs and pit them against croats . 
  yeah , that 's right : the `` ancient croatian-serb hatred '' is in a good part his fault . 
  ^ ( revise trianon ? 
  over my dead body . ), 
  yeah ? 
  worse than 1689 , 1915 , 1999 ... ? 
  i 'm just surprised nobody mentioned ~ ~ sljadoljed ~ ~ ice cream . 
  i 'm just saying islas malvinas . 
   yes yes i know , but i meant the yugo before milosevic started messing with the army . 
  my istrian grandpa was a partisan and later jna officer , until they retired him in ' 68 . 
  according to him , what happened was that suddenly his superiors started asking him about his nationality , he responded croatian , and then in a matter of weeks he was retired with no explanation . 
  that was after the whole declaration controversy , and i 'm quite sure i found in a book that the secretary of defence ljubi\u010di\u0107 deliberately started removing croats from the positions of responsibility , since they were `` politically unreliable '' . 
  i do n't have it here at the moment , i 'll check when i get home . 
  edit : ok , found two explanations . 
  the first one is the one i mentioned , from ivo goldstein 's [ croatia : a history , p. 223 ] ( https://books.google.si/books?id=psxjde4myo4c&amp;pg=pa223&amp;lpg=pa223&amp;dq=nikola+ljubi%c4%8di%c4%87+jna+croats&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ljatkkguqo&amp;sig=jakuel6-ypoog9uo64yhblixkxc&amp;hl=hr&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cd0q6aewbgovchmipeudwpuzyaiv5ypych1jfqgo#v=onepage&amp;q=nikola%20ljubi%c4%8di%c4%87%20jna%20croats&amp;f=false ) . 
  ( tbh i remembered this book being better sourced , but my friends who study history say that goldstein is usually reliable , so let 's assume he did n't pull this one out of his ass . ), 
  the other one is from tito in tovari\u0161i ( tito and comrades ) by jo\u017ee pirjevec , p. 536 . 
  he says it was because of a personnel reshuffling during the preparations for founding of territorial defence :  in june 1967 the marshal [ tito ] replaced the secretary of defence [ general go\u0161njak ] with a serb , nikola ljubi\u010di\u0107 , although he [ go\u0161njak ] kept the position of deputy supreme commander . 
  however , his substitution did n't ease tensions and intrigues in the army , among other things because it became apparent that nationalism was steadily dripping into partisan nucleus of the jna , which worried the `` yugoslav-oriented '' personnel . 
  ( because of infighting , which was often result of personal conflicts and affairs , 38 generals and 2400 officers were expelled from the army in 1968 . ), 
  - * translation and comments mine - suberee *, 
  no hard feelings from me . 
  i just hope it wo n't happen again , at least as long as i 'm alive . 
  [ one does not simply drive a tank through slovenia . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ten-day_war ), 
  we are talking about cca . 
  year 1100 , there were no turks at that point . 
  what actually happened is that croatian king died without a direct heir , so his brother-in-law , king ladislaus of hungary , laid claim to the vacant throne . 
  at the same time , a part of croatian nobility elected an alternative king , peter sva\u010di\u0107 . 
  ladislaus decided to press his claims , invaded croatia , there was a battle , king peter got killed and that was it . 
  that was in 1097 .
