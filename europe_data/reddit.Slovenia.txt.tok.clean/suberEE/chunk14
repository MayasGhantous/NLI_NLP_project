  what happened next is a bit of a mystery . 
  ladislaus died without being actually crowned as the croatian king . 
  the first hungarian that was crowned was koloman in 1102 . 
  nobody really knows what was happening in the meantime . 
  croatian historians liked to wave a paper named pacta conventa , which stated that croatia remains an independent kingdom in personal union with hungary . 
  of course it turned out to be a forgery . 
  hungarians claimed that their right to croatia was `` the right of sword '' . 
  like i said , nobody really knows, 
  at least you apologized and offered reparations . 
  plus that verse `` sa lov\u0107ena vila kli\u010de ` oprosti nam dubrovni\u010de ' '' is pure montenegrin awesomeness . 
  is that serbia proper or sr serbia with vojvodina and kosovo included ? 
  because if it 's sr serbia that stagnated , then serbia proper had to have positive growth . 
  we tried it twice with catastrophic results . 
  no thanks .

  five years of war , spillover to neighboring countries , ethnic cleansing and a small genocide , much fun , recommended .

  nah , the anniversary of that one is in three weeks . 
  that 's pindjur , the proof that the macedonoid race is superior . 
  so , basically , serbia proper was the only region in yugoslavia that had positive economic growth during the 80 's ? 
  fuck that , i 'd ragequit too . 
  did i do it right ? 
  he 's one of the guys that would like the independence day to be on may 30th ... the day the first hdz dominated parliament went in session . 
  that 's the only true independence . 
  hdz is croatia . 
  hdz is love . 
  hdz is life . 
  how many of them are actually from albania and how many are from kosovo/macedonia ? 
  such is life . 
  i do n't know about dangerous but disgusting they are . 
  thus spoke fox news . 
  therefore it 's quite possible that the refugee crisis is nearing its own end .

  roma usually eat regional ( not strictly local ) food with a twist . 
  so here they offer mostly balkanic dishes ( \u0107evapi , stuffed bell peppers , baklava ... ) with some hungarian influences ( goulash , roasted chicken wings ... ) . 
  not really . 
  those who had no problem with them in the first place eat at the restaurant , those who hate them pretend they do n't exist and that nothing happened . 
  business as usual . 
   russian is a drunk mans speech , i 'm sorry . 
  not so much as czech . 
  we have awesome cuss words . 
  shame on you , sweden . 
  shame , shame , shame on you . 
  well , they are oppressed . 
  a couple of years ago the local romani union decided to open a restaurant , primarily in order to combat unemployment among roma . 
  the backlash was fucking incredible . 
  people were protesting , complaining that a restaurant on that location would disturb the peace ( the posh caf\u00e9 just across the street apparently is n't a problem ) , claiming it would become a crime hub , writing hateful messages on the building where the restaurant was supposed to be ... thankfully our mayor was smarter than that and the restaurant got finally opened . 
  guess how much trouble was there with that restaurant since ? 
  that 's right , nothing . 
  ( if you ever come to maribor , make sure you get a lunch at their place . 
  it 's called romani kafenava , it 's dirt cheap and their goulash is divine . ), 
  someone could do a politological analysis of student unions as the democracy gone awry . 
  here in slovenia they are n't so deep in the sjw yet , they 're too busy profiteering off student labor . 
  almost nobody actually votes on student elections , yet the student union , which has it 's own government list ( seriously ) still finds it necessary to block the alternative electoral lists from participating through some bureaucratic loopholes they created themselves . 
  they even literally bribe students to vote for them . 
  it 's incredible . 
  the best thing about living in slovenia is that this kind of injustice is virtually unheard of , for now . 
  we do it the good old-fashioned way : slovenes mildly oppress other ex-yugos , other ex-yugos mildly oppress albanians , everybody oppresses gypsies and everybody snitches on everybody . 
  like the 20th century never ended . 
  basically , they do n't allow ukip to give speeches on the premises . 
  can you tell it in spanish ? 
  out here the theory is that a lot of sds ( our section of epp ) gets a lot of its votes from pensioners , who do n't have anything better to do than vote anyway . 
  i do n't know why , but pretty much any person that grew up under communism has their mouth full of lead . 
  i know very few young people with bad teeth . 
  there 's only one explanation possible : * communism ruins teeth !, 
  just like balkans !, 
  i do n't see many avars walking around here . 
  do you ? 
  meet the new boss , same as the old boss . 
  what 's with epp members that their fanbase is so loyal ? 
  i 'd definitely start brushing teeth more often if i found out i was part brit . 
  there , there . 
  i can get you more ice cream if you want . 
  that 's the price you pay for being a superpower .

  the impression after only a couple of hours in berlin was that it 's still two conjoined cities . 
  ( i might be crazy , but i preferred east berlin . ), 
   [ w ] ithout consideration of `` traditions '' and prejudices , it [ germany ] must find the courage to gather our people and their strength for an advance along the road that will lead this people from its present restricted living space to new land and soil , and hence also free it from the danger of vanishing from the earth or of serving others as a slave nation . 
  -- adolf hitler , mein kampf or ,  in an era when the earth is gradually being divided up among states , some of which embrace almost entire continents , we can not speak of a world power in connection with a formation whose political mother country is limited to the absurd area of five hundred thousand square kilometers . 
  -- adolf hitler , mein kampf let 's also say , if they wanted the right to self-determination for all german-inhabited regions ... well , maybe they should n't have lost wwi . 
  bad things happen to countries that lose wars , just look at serbia . 
  i do n't recall bush mentioning in his campaign that he 's going to go to war . 
  hitler , on the other hand , never hid that his foreign policy goal is to grab clay . 
   the reason left wingers in general defend islam is because we try to be inclusive in our thinking and therefore try to compromise with muslims . 
  that 's a [ sheldon compromise ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gt1daj0qbla ) though .

  yup , people still eat them . 
  in fact there is an event every autumn dedicated to hunting and cooking those little , furry , tasty critters . 
  usually there 's very much more than enough of dormice in the dinaric alps , but the winter before last was pretty catastrophic with all the glaze ice and their population declined a lot subsequently . 
  * palm * ** is ** * dlan * as the inner surface . 
  now i checked and the word for that part of hand would be * \u0161aka * ( cro . ), 
  / * pest * ( slo . ) . 
  now , the problem is it means * fist * too , in fact when people hear the word they 'll think of fist first . 
  so it seems that there would be no 100 % satisfying translation for * hand * / * d\u0142on * . 
   people often say exactly what they think . 
  they do not want to be impolite but honest .
