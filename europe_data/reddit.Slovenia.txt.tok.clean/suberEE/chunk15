  ( constructive ) criticism is considered a central part in improving oneself and others , particularly in work life . 
  so being criticized or criticizing someone is not uncommon . 
  yeah , i heard from a lot of people who worked in mid-eastern countries that lying is more acceptable there than saying unpleasant truths . 
  i really wonder why is that so . 
  it would also be helpful to directly write that any version of `` inshallah '' is not an acceptable answer in germany ( that would also make it a lot easier for all of us who come from southern countries ( \u25e1 \u203f \u25e1 \u273f ) ) . 
  how do you say `` handshake '' ^ i 'm ^ too ^ lazy ^ to ^ google ? 
  in slovenia it 's `` stisk roke '' , although the word for `` palm '' is `` dlan '' . 
  wo\u0142och also comes from the same indo-european root as welsh . 
  so ... how are your sheep ?

  what the hell is with greece ? 
  in croatia i 'm a pinko , in slovenia i 'm a centrist , in netherlands i guess i 'd be literally nazi . 
  yeah , could be . 
  it 's all organized , those crafty jews have made a plan for world takeover by controlling media centuries ago . 
  just read protocols . 
  ( for pete 's sake of course this is / s ), 
  leave it to the guardian to make umberto eco sound like a shallow and senile ivory-tower professor . 
  i 'm a great fan of his opinion pieces because they 're usually amazingly argued , honest and humorous . 
  whoever wrote this simply cut out all of the argument and left only provocations and phrases without any significance . 
  fuck guardian , srsly . 
  not only are his songs the epitome of shmaltz , but he also has the gall to claim that [ this guy ] ( https://youtu.be/f2sn0lvzqns ) ca n't sing and would never have a career if mi\u0161o did n't tell him how it 's done . 
  meanwhile , mi\u0161o does n't even sing at his concerts , he just stands there with his hands raised . 
  awful choice . 
  beef curtains are labia minora . 
  bloodclaat is rasta menstrual pad . 
  now that albania is into europe , serbia is into china . 
  of all the cities in the world , they recommend the fridge . 
  croatian , serbian , bosnian , montenegrin , slovenian , english , italian and veneto . 
  so , four and a half . 
  he was trying to be funny and failed miserably . 
  definitely not me . 
   tiny slovenia this is really starting to remind me of [ ricky gervais in gta4 ] ( https://youtu.be/spfdsjvcklc?t=2m6s ) . 
  i mean , the way papers report on us you 'd think we were pinhead tiny . 
  it 's \u0160o\u0161tanj , what 's there to preserve ? 
  i guess rubbing alcohol is speech now . 
  you mean the guy who was inspiration for general turgidson ? 
  right wing fetishizes the 50 's , left wing fetishizes the 60 's . 
  the answer is at least a partial yes .

  eating out in london could become affordable and we ca n't have that !, 
  please . 
  where would all that coke for american noses pass if you were n't there ? 
  i do n't know about spain , but here they mostly sell it . 
  everything changes , the only thing that stays the same is poll ratings of epp members . 
  not everybody is christian , dude , but everybody likes a holiday , 
  1 november is all saints , 2 november is day of the souls . 
  all saints was secularized into day of the dead during the tito era and stayed that way . 
  source : 8 years in religious education . 
  why ? 
  the price is the highest amount people are still willing to pay . 
  has been that way since before money was a thing . 
  they only discovered it now ? 
  i 've known for years that nutella in italy has nothing to do with nutella here . 
  dude , i would n't really write that all over the internet in your place . 
  not if it 's good . 
  plus you are n't supposed to mix different sorts . 
  red wine and coke is called bambus in croatia and it is the principal way for highschool kids to get blind drunk . 
  when i was 16 i drank two bottles of that shit and barfed all over the place . 
  i liked shogun 2 . 
  i 'm a sucker for both european feudalism and sengoku period , plus  our men are running from the batterufierdu !, 
  shamefur dispray !, 
  but how much could they actually use them ? 
  serious question . 
  because in urban combat there are some simple way of dealing with indestructible tanks . 
  either you just wait them to pass or you use landmines . 
  you wo n't destroy it but you can render it immovable . 
  you wo n't destroy it but you can render it immovable,

  turkey is protected . 
  kim has ten nukes , russia is closer to ten thousand . 
   you 're ferrying them [ we all are .

  [ surprisingly , no ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/1hq39g/iama_sonarman_on_a_nuclearpowered_us_fast_attack/cawr9ih/ ), 
  we do n't have many jokes about hungarians either . 
  those that we have mostly make fun of your language . 
  same shit as my example . 
  but that 's why there are always so many problems around free speech . 
  as long as we can debate and reason with one another all is chill . 
  but that does n't account for echo chambers and the fact that people want action , not deliberation . 
  it could have turned out much differently if hungarian revolutionaries were n't so hardcore nationalist and if they accepted that slavs and romanians wo n't just roll over and obedienty turn into hungarians . 
  this way they were encircled by enemies from start . 
  free expression means a person can say anything and another person can say anything back . 
  example of free expression : a : `` gay is okay . '', 
  b : `` you 're a moron , gayness is obviously the worst thing ever . '', 
  example of lack of free expression : a : `` gay is okay . '', 
  b ( arrests person a and prosecutes him for spreading gay propaganda ) no idea about japan . 
  apparently my grandpa , who was the local party secretary , always used to say when nobody was listening : `` fuck communism of beggars . '', 
  i 'd really like to see what would happen if all those parties actually listened to their members . 
  nah , nationalism is not the same as tsarism , and even if it was defeated in 1917 it came back strong with stalin . 
  you do n't spit in the well you drink from ? 
  eh , no , not really . 
  ibsen is required reading in highschools here , while grieg is ... not required listening , put it that way . 
  we are white , so they ca n't be racist towards us . 
  we are christian , so they ca n't be islamophobic towards us . 
  we are n't third-world poor , so they do n't need to be all care and welfare to us . 
  we are n't rich , so they do n't need to take our economic and social problems seriously .
