  pro-russian oligarchs would n't really be a boon to moldova either . 
  i doubt anything could be at this point . 
  and why should we care about who runs the country as long as he 's running it for our benefit ? 
  after reading about his character and directing methods , i 'd say it 's friedkin who needs an exorcism . 
  but okay , i can see what 's the problem with nuclear plants , they are the safest but when shit happens it happens big . 
  i 'm more thinking about blocking railway upgrades , especially since electrified railways can be powered completely on renewable sources . 
  but nooo , and why ? 
  because petrol company would lose money . 
  same thing with electrical cars . 
  a city of 100 000 inhabitants and one single charging station . 
  out here they successfully forced the industry to filter their exhausts , yet the air is still polluted enough that my bike becomes literally sticky in two days time . 
  i doubt that 's all because of smokers . 
  [ too late , everybody 's already scared ] ( http://www.romaniajournal.ro/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/laura-codruta-kovesi.jpg ), 
  croatia is what you 're looking for . 
  if a canadian could do it , why not a real american ? 
  agreed . 
  it 's human dumbness at its finest ( says i while lighting my umpteenth cigarette today ) . 
  but i ca n't shake the feeling that this complaining about smoking outdoors is a first world problem par excellence . 
  i mean , i lived in times and places when empty canisters and beer cans laying around on streets were the most visible pollution , and empty heroin syringes were an environmental factor . 
  can i just ask you where are you from ( you have no flair ) ? 
  'cause i 'm right now in ljubljana , the most-heavily-smoking city of [ one of the most-heavily-smoking countries ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_cigarette_consumption_per_capita ) which somehow always gets praised for its cleanliness and beauty . 
  i just think that smoking is the least of a problen when it comes to pollution and landscape . 
  drain on public health is where the damage is . 
  but all that smoke is still going to exit the house and pollute your fresh mountain air . 
  or even worse , imagine someone smoking on his porch and blowing the smoke in your general direction . 
   clean , healthy air sorry , could n't hear you over that truck noise . 
  okay , so why not simply ban smoking altogether ? 
  indoors is already banned , what 's the use of continuing with charade ? 
  brexit will only be incentive to leave too . 
  says an american after grenada , panama , or iraq . 
  the hypocrisy , it burns . 
  i 'm familiar with that survey . 
  i also come from istria , which is a bilingual area where both ethnicities in question did their best to kill each other off less than a century ago . 
  strangely enough , the tensions pretty much vanished into thin air once politicians stopped emphasising differences and rivalries between ethnicities . 
  we are all still aware who 's italian and who croatian , but there is no open animosity , and it will stay that way until the powers that be start stirring shit again . 
  and everything would be just dandy if srpska could join serbia . 
  yet you are an officer , you 're from this region and you know very well that one look on the ethnic map shows that it 's impossible to do without removing a lot of kebab . 
  you sure you want it all over again ? 
  i totally do n't understand what you just wrote . 
  it seems to me that you are the one who argues that it just happens . 
  i say that people in positions of power - the ones that shape politics - escalate the rivalries and hatreds between groups for their own political or personal gain , usually with disastrous results . 
  that 's what identity politics is . 
  and please do n't tell me that it 's inevitable . 
  only a few years - hell , months - before wars in yugoslavia started , nobody could imagine that happening . 
  and sorry for godwin , but i 'm pretty sure holocaust was everything but inevitable . 
  identity politics is playing up those rivalries for political points . 
  it 's harmful because it 's divisive , and in extreme cases leads to war . 
  since i was born in yugoslavia i think i have a pretty good idea of its dangers .

  we , of course , wo n't go into how luther tampered with the text of the bible to fit his preconceptions , which is another main reason why catholic church did n't want to translate any further than vulgata . 
  let 's also not mention how both bible and qur ` an are full of contradictions , which is why there is any clergy in the first place . 
  how do you reconcile `` turn the other cheek '' with `` two swords are enough '' ? 
  or `` eye of the needle '' and `` with me are riches and honor '' ? 
  or `` fight those who believe not in allah '' and `` to you your religion , to me mine '' ? 
  it is truly right and just , our duty and salvation , always and everywhere , to make shady deals with fascist regimes , organize paramilitaries and participate in organized killing . 
  spain is always an exception . 
  i mean you guys had a relevant anarchist movement that even managed to gain power at one point , that 's a distinction you share only with ukraine . 
  well , you see , there are a couple of verses in qur ` an that [ forbid forced conversion ] ( http://www.alim.org/library/quran/ayah/compare/2/256 ) , [ war of aggression ] ( http://www.alim.org/library/quran/ayah/compare/2/190 ) and [ killing of innocents ] ( http://www.alim.org/library/quran/ayah/compare/5/32 ) . 
  that does n't really stop isis from doing all three , does it ? 
  people twist and turn religion to suit their needs all the time . 
  i mean , buddhism is supposed to be about getting rid of one 's desires , [ and yet ... ] ( http://g04.a.alicdn.com/kf/htb1qoxsjfxxxxakxfxxq6xxfxxxt/-10-chinese-brass-sleep-happy-laugh-maitreya-buddha-ru-yi-money-bag-rich-statue-.jpg ), 
  islam is half a millenium younger too . 
  i know this opinion is very much hated by anyone , but i really think islam has the exact same problems as christianity around 1500 . 
  that 's why it 's necessary to shrink the living space , is n't it ? 
  that comes after fried chicken and roasted potatoes . 
  maybe it 's time for another coup ? 
  with this tempo you 're soon gon na be another pakistan .

  so brits , after you leave europe , will you join australia ? 
  it will .

  guilty, 
  latvia just calls for a 20 min house remix .
