  cyprus , australia , bulgaria . 
  cp6uja wants to be anastacia ? 
  cyprus is good . 
  or it seems so after all the blandness up to now . 
  ( but i choose to believe it 's good . ), 
  it 's quite a decent song otherwise . 
  i guess since so many poles went to britain , they started wearing red coats . 
  france ? 
  come on , sounds like any song ever . 
  c'mon bulgaria , christmas is not coming another seven months . 
  useful . 
  italian song hits every san remo clich\u00e9 : wordy , not sung but kinda recitated , emozioni , vento , separazioni , overproduced , cheesy . 
  good god . 
  netherlands is like that band from back to the future . 
  but it somehow ended up completely devoid of funk . 
  now you know why we left yugoslavia . 
  the guy is american and the book is basically a compendium of distortions and conspiracy theories .

  papal state was annexed by italy in 1870 . 
  the pope kept the long face until 1929 , when mussolini re-established vatican by lateran treaty .

  born in paris , raised in britain . 
  she 's europe personifie ... wait wat ... * dragon school * ? 
   the vatican is a separate country thanks to benito . 
  is there anything that guy did n't fuck up ? 
  nobody actually uses those invented words . 
  i guess your standard language is moving towards north serbian speech , which is much closer to croatian . 
  i do n't know how to explain right now since i 'm not home , but just compare the language in newspapers from 60 's and from now . 
  oh yeah , actually i wanted to post the version by jobim , but this was the only one with a brazilian enough slideshow . 
  brazil how would we live without thee ? 
  without you what would we drink ?

  you fucked us over in carinthia . 
  celovec rightful slovenian clay . 
  did n't know that form is used in print . 
  [ normally i see the regular \u0431 form everywhere ] ( https://sr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%a1%d1%80%d0%b1%d0%b8%d1%98%d0%b0 ) . 
  considering i can understand russian , as opposed to hebrew , that development 's very convenient for me once i get enough money to visit israel . 
  oblast = normal region . 
  krai = huge uninhabited region republic = reservation for non-russian ethnicity autonomous okrug = reservation for siberian natives autonomous oblast = reservation for jews federal city = civilization, 
  serbia is like a character from wizard of oz ... a country without heart . 
  i only started it calling serbo-croatian the day they invented montenegrin language . 
  i mean , who are we kidding . 
  * croatian : policajac bosnian : pendrek-efendija * croatian : inspektor bosnian : ma\u0161ala pendrek-efendija, 
  funnily enough , i started understanding certain croatian dialects only after learning slovenian . 
  we 'd rather be poor and irrelevant than have anything in common with serbs !, 
  [ * grabs heart * ] ( http://www.vecernji.hr/media/cache/4f/c1/4fc1890a40b93c730b26bdc25a4889b2.jpg ) on the other hand , you do n't have to worry about that . 
  croatian idea of a divergent path is to try to make croatian as similar to slovenian as possible . 
  on the other hand , serbian language is moving towards croatian , to sond fancier i guess . 
  ultimately , everyone from vardar to triglav will speak slovenian . 
   gvo\u017e\u0111e the beautiful , ancient , poetic croatian word that was thrown into trashbin because serbs use the same word . 
  sometimes i wonder if balkans can get any more stupid . 
  one does not simply expropriate from church . 
  gauloises : guaranteed heartburns since 1910 . 
  otherwise , how do those regulations apply to rolling tobacco ? 
  heh , i know exactly what you are talking about , since i lived in [ this area ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/80889437.jpg ) in my highschool years . 
  on the other hand , [ this is the landscape ] ( http://s2.pticica.com/foto/0000946350_l_0_4nrpbz.jpg ) that 's perfect for me , which really recharges my batteries ( since i grew up there ) . 
  that 'd be 106 cm , or 3 ' 6 for you barbarians, 
  move to slovenia . 
  at 188 i 'm the second tallest guy in my circle of friends . 
  the tallest guy is montenegrin . 
  did you get any of this from [ this guy ] ( http://www.index.hr/images2/davor-domazet-loso-hrt.jpg ) ? 
  so flat ... 
  i mean , how do n't you get depressed from all that monotony ? 
  oh , you 're from lithuania . 
  oh no , we have at least one . 
  one of my university classmates has a jewish grandmother . 
  this is all greek to me . 
  he did n't really spell out which is the right way towards communism , and in his works and letters he advocated both reformist policies ( where appropriate ) and violent revolution ( where necessary ) . 
  unlike leninists later , he believed there 's more than one way towards communism . 
  but that 's not the only thing about him that later communists grabbed , oversimplified and turned on its head . 
  for example , i found this while digging through wikiquotes :  neither of us cares a straw for popularity . 
  a proof of this is for example , that , because of aversion to any personality cult , i have never permitted the numerous expressions of appreciation from various countries with which i was pestered during the existence of the international to reach the realm of publicity , and have never answered them , except occasionally by a rebuke . 
  when engels and i first joined the secret communist society we made it a condition that everything tending to encourage superstitious belief in authority was to be removed from the statutes . 
  [ does n't really fit with this image , does it ? 
  ] ( http://www.mij.rs/sw4i/box/image.jpg?imageid=257&amp;thumb=1 ), 
  apart from these i highly recommend notorious ( she was absolutely amazing in that movie , a must-watch ) , gaslight , europa '51 and murder on the orient express . 
  you actually pronounce all that ? 
  oh you mean back then when they bordered [ tibet ] ( http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18pefyttaq6i1jpg/original.jpg ) ? 
  ah yes , belmondo , the ultimate guy for douchebag parts . 
  best actress of all time . 
  so subtle , yet so powerful . 
  yeah ? 
  i ca n't be the only one that rates [ her ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/37/f7/b8/37f7b88e7b7c9ac65e47c2fb79aac9ce.jpg ) as more than comparable . 
  i was confused about a ton of things but scantily clad women were never among them . 
  if a chick was hot i got an erection , that 's it . 
  most probably .
