  it 's not like they started killing you immediately . 
  is that supposed to make it better somehow ? 
  `` oh yeah , 8000 people were killed , but they were all guys so they do n't count . '', 
  i 'd be more than happy if they claimed they 're bosnians with a * n * and stopped with that revanchist bullshit that can only lead to another stupid war . 
  enough is enough . 
  same as above . 
  if it was n't for that dumb entity as an institution , your place of birth would be more than awesome . 
  but the entity , holy crap , do you have anyone in the politics that is n't an immense dick with identity crisis , obsessed with proving to everybody that he 's a bigger serb than the next guy ? 
  such crap gives you all a bad reputation in the whole region , serbia included . 
  and that 's a shame , because bosnian serbs that i know are by a large margin decent people . 
  if you 're one of those remove kebab fleg-and-rifle \u010detnik apologist assholes that seem to infest srpska even more than fascists infest croatia , then fuck you right back . 
  otherwise sorry . 
  mladi\u0107 did nothing wrong !, 
  those were all heavy armed mujahideen killed in a fair fight !, 
  it was a false flag operation !, 
  jasenovac , never forget !, 
  and fuck snsd . 
  and fuck srpska in general . 
  yeah , i do n't know if you ever read any dutch literature in translation , but let me tell you : it gets butchered beyond recognition . 
  hmph . 
  out here you can easily live for years , maybe even decades , while speaking only english , and everyone will bend over backwards to accomodate you because it 's such a cool and stronk language . 
  but just dare to speak croatian in public . 
  if it was n't for your flair it could be any ex-yugo country . 
  i did n't say `` unskilled '' . 
  just the presence of a large population starving for work drives all the wages down . 
  my hometown currently has 18 % unemployment . 
  this is employer 's paradise : everyone , skilled or not , is trying their hardest to sell their labor cheaper than the next guy . 
  you do n't even have to pay your employees regularly , people are so desperate for jobs that they quietly accept not being paid for months if it means they can keep the job , because they * wo n't * find another . 
  oh , sure , there is a percentage of those who do n't accept slavery and sue their employer , but that means they get laid off instantly and that courts can not even process the amount of lawsuits for mobbing , wrongful firings and withholding wages , which means most of those lawsuits end with statute of limitations expired . 
  since we all know how easy it is to avoid taxes once you have a company of any size , employers do n't even need to worry about the cost of unemployment benefits , the employees pay for that . 
  as a bonus : if you employ immigrants , it 's even better for you as an employer , because you can always take away their passports and arrange for their expulsion once they start complaining about not getting paid . 
  there is nothing better than to have a large heap of desperate people out of work . 
  germany currently has a labor shortage . 
  importing a couple of millions of future unemployed people solves that nicely . 
  air violin ftw, 
  they realized their fertility rate is lower than japanese , panicked and decided to import a ton of refugees from countries with high fertility rate . 
  ca n't lose cheap labor supply that easily . 
  [ we were more into murder ballads . 
  ] ( https://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/ro%c5%a1lin_in_verjanko ), 
  nobody really knows . 
  there 's a saying here `` izginiti kot obri '' - to disappear like avars . 
  they were likely never a cohesive tribe , instead they were more like a large group of warriors riding for their khagan , game of thrones style . 
  once the khaganate fell apart , there was nothing left to keep avars together . 
  bring back samo 's kingdom !, 
  they fucked a lot . 
  and this map does n't show population density . 
  fuck that . 
  if i 'm killing myself , at least i wan na do it with style . 
  we are talking about year 900 , mate, 
  nah , it still exists , you can check on foreign ministry website, 
  i ca n't imagine a worse humiliation for a country . 
  sauerkraut + blood sausage + roasted potatoes = happiness . 
  it 's not even a real consulate , just a honorary one . 
  you ca n't get any papers done in it . 
  coming to think about it , i 've never seen it open . 
  jeez , not again . 
  pandering , like appealing to prejudice of a group of people in order to score political points ? 
  well that implies those prejudices exist in the first place , which then implies that classical greeks did not consider macedonians as greeks for chrissakes . 
  anyway , you shifted the goalposts ( first we talk about ethnicity , then about kingdoms ) , you did n't really disprove my main point - that ancient macedonian ethnicity disappeared and that nobody can claim continuity with them any more than with hittites - you suck at debating and yeah , it is pointless to continue . 
   ** people ** currently living in italy are descendants from the romans , the greeks from ancient greeks ( the ancent macedonians being part of the ancient greeks -  alexander the great being part of an ancient greek dynasty the argead ) your words , not mine . 
   part greek obviously not greek enough for demosthenes and his supporters , yet enough to fuck with modern macedonians . 
  okay , so their ruling dynasty had greek origins . 
  what 's next ? 
  bulgarians are actually germans , because their kings in 19th century were of german ancestry ? 
  i 'm saying , ancient macedonian * people * were not considered greek , they lost their identity through history and there is currently no state that can claim to be continuation of ancient macedonian state . 
  okay ? 
  not greece , not macedonia . 
  never , but they 've always been either makers or reflection of public opinion . 
  especially in a democracy , such as athens . 
   and yet they show no such feeling in regard to philip , although not only is he no hellene , not only has he no kinship with hellenes , but he is not even a barbarian from a country that one could acknowledge with credit ; -- he is a pestilent macedonian , from whose country it used not to be possible to buy even a slave of any value . 
  - demosthenes , * philippic iii * ** tl ; dr ** : ancient macedonians as schr\u00f6dinger 's greeks , hellenic only when convenient . 
  that macedonia does n't even exist anymore . 
  good , carry on . 
  thus wrote washington times . 
  same shit as far as we are concerned . 
  they used to be the rightist party , but they changed their name when being right-wing stopped being cool . 
  [ well ] ( https://youtu.be/fgjrjy2xc0c ), 
  [ and yet ... ] ( http://www.uravnotezenost.si/ ), 
  tell me about it . 
  my favorite thing about berlin is that it 's basically two adjacent cities with transformation happening quite literally in the middle of the road . 
  if i could german , i 'd immediately try to get myself a job in west berlin and a flat in east  . 
  loved that city . 
  because it 's fun to see divergent paths of pieces of a former country . 
  same as why ex-yugoslavian countries are still grouped together . 
  the other day , while i was carpooling , somebody said to me that i pronounce * l * like a southerner would . 
  i curled up in a ball on the backseat and hysterically cried the rest of the ride . 
  thirteen years i 've been living in slovenia , trying to fit in , eating schnitzel and roasted potatoes every sunday and this is what i get ? 
  make ajvar not war, 
  it is a very positive name : slav-lover happyson . 
  off the top of my head i can name only one example where difference between hard and soft sound makes an actual difference in meaning : * \u0111ak * ( schoolboy ) vs. * d\u017eak * ( sack ) . 
  although i have never heard anyone actually use the word * d\u017eak * . 
  to be fair , serbs also make fun of those who [ overdo the difference ] ( http://youtu.be/-qnpip8s96i ) . 
  i think you are talking about north korea here . 
  kgb founder , main prosecutor at moscow trials ... wtf polan, 
  true . 
  but it does n't change the fact that antiziganism is real and that it fucks up the precious few opportunities when romani actually try to do things the way that mainstream society considers acceptable . 
  i collected them all . 
  i still think of that as the greatest achievement of my life . 
  i do n't know , i always find on the bust station a couple of guys or girls squatting right next to the bench . 
  i live in eastern slovenia tho .
