   parliament can open parliamentary investigation with an absolute majority ( 301 ) . 
  parliament discusses proposal in 1 month . 
  following the completion of discussion , parliamentary investigation can begin in parliament with a hidden three-fifths ( 360 ) vote in favor.following the completion of investigations , the parliament can vote to indict the president with a hidden two-thirds ( 400 ) vote in favor . 
  this essentially means one-man rule disguised as parliamentary democracy . 
  this is much bigger than anything orban or kaczynski have done yet . 
  and it definitely does n't fit in eu . 
  they were never going to get in . 
  i do n't even know why did n't they reject the application outright . 
  turkey is a mess , unstable and unevenly developed , but even if it was n't , it would shake up the balance of power inside eu by sheer population . 
  do n't . 
  there are some sources hinting at croatian army soldiers being sent to bosnia and switching insignia to hvo at the border . 
  nice to hear that . 
  do you really want to pay reparations for ethnic cleansing of germans ?

   yugoslavia { { disputed } }, 
  of course he was , but i think it 's common knowledge that a huge chunk of serbs live outside serbia . 
  tesla , for example , has nothing to do with serbia . 
  he was born in military frontier , which is today croatia , educated in austria and spent most of his life in usa . 
  this equalization between ethnicity and state simply does n't work in central-eastern europe . 
  is franz kafka a czech or german writer ? 
  am i croatian or slovenian ( i was born and raised in croatia , i shitpost on / r/croatia , but i live in slovenia and write stories in slovenian ) ? 
  why should he be listed under serbia ? 
  he visited it once , for a couple of hours , in his entire life . 
  i mean , nobody lists einstein under israel . 
  there is no way in hell trump listened to all of this . 
  which part of croatia ? 
  we dinaric guys really kick the average up . 
  i 'm 1,87 / 88 ( depending on the weather ) and i feel puny compared to guys from gospi\u0107 . 
  apart from what / u/bomko said , i think the gap is mainly due to the fact that we millennials are the first generation in slovenian history that was raised in liberal democracy and social capitalist economy . 
  our parents , although mostly well-intentioned , still tend to think in the terms of the boss always being right and the state being exclusively responsible for providing work and driving economy forward . 
  that has a depressing effect on entrepreneurship and thus economic growth . 
  things are changing , though , slovenia today is a very different country from the one i moved in 14 years ago . 
  are we bringing the gap soon ? 
  i do n't know . 
  if shit does n't hit the fan and few really necessary reforms are pulled through , we might overtake spain , or even italy in few decades . 
  we 'll probably never be another netherlands or sweden , but , personally , i would n't even like that . 
  viva l'italia , auguri !, 
  ( but trieste is still ours , eh ), 
  those criteria were dropped later in the war . 
  they were happy to pick up untermenschen into ss once they started running out of aryans . 
  it 's like slovenia : looks like the west on surface , but dig a bit deeper ... 
  it would be phlegmatic .

  he already does , but he 's not a fanatic . 
  what he does , he does for power , not salvation . 
  we need to keep that in mind and not play into his propaganda ( which does n't mean appeasement ) . 
  our donald is so cute :3, 
  or how much of that money is wasted on bullshit . 
  in the parlance of american founding fathers democracy meant what mob rule means to us ( they were almost all members of colonial gentry ) . 
  apparently it stuck . 
  you really think all of this bullshit has anything to do with anything except erdogan trying to become dictator of turkey ? 
   but i killed a cat in brasov just to watch her die  when i hear that distant yowlin ' i hang my head and i cry, 
  can confirm , am slovenian military bot . 
  long live unstable governments !, 
  consequences stayed though . 
  i 'm from maribor and every time it rains a bit , those dumbasses from duplek have their cellars flooded . 
  i 'm not saying you 're wrong . 
  the animosities definitely accumulated over time , and there were tons of ups and downs in croat-serb relations . 
  what i mean is , if i had to point a finger and say `` this is when it first started '' , it would be khuen 's rule . 
  it 's absolutely true that croat-serb coalition dominated the croatian politics in the years leading up to ww1 . 
  nevertheless , it was even before that caolition was formed , in 1902 - therefore under khuen - that first serious croat-serb clash happened . 
  a croatian serb daily , srbobran , published a horribly chauvinistic and provocative article by nikola stojanovi\u0107 , `` serbs and croats '' , which literally contained this paragraph :  that combat has to be led till the destruction , either ours or yours . 
  one side must succumb . 
  that side will be croatians , due to their minority , geographical position , mingling with serbs and because the process of evolution means serbhood is equal to progress . 
  that was not the first provocative article srbobran published . 
  khuen , who was otherwise very keen to employ censorship , let this newspaper publish provocations for years . 
  anyway , the most extreme croatian nationalistic party , the pure party of rights , grabbed the opportunity to organize anti-serb riots in zagreb . 
  again , khuen was oddly reluctant to employ police and let the mob run wild for two whole days . 
  i think this speaks enough about his methods and intentions . 
  on the other hand , those riots launched the career of stjepan radi\u0107 ( who publicly called for rioters to stop destroying serb property ) and galvanized liberal opposition among both serbs and croats , which ultimately led to formation of croat-serb coalition . 
  possibly the worst thing he did was pitting serbs against croats in order to secure serb support . 
  i 'm pretty convinced that 's when the big hate started for real . 
  anyone else here builds houses the way we do ? 
  illegally , preferably on a floodplain , and then keeps a low profile until mass legalization ? 
  well you 're not particularly knowledgeable . 
  and islam is few centuries younger and it 's a completely different religion anyway , so ... 
  i do n't really think a change can be forced on islam , it has to come from within . 
  hopefully , what we 're witnessing may even be the death throes of hardcore islam . 
  then why is there still debate about creationism ? 
  okay , if one 's still paying taxes in his come country then he should vote . 
  as our friends across the pond says , no taxation without representation . 
  but at the moment i do n't pay any taxes in croatia , and in fact the only connections that i still have with my home country are some family and emotional bonds . 
  i do n't think that 's enough . 
  but okay , we have different opinions and maybe someday we 'll go out and vote about them . 
  the beauty of democracy , 
  that 's where r/accidentalrenaissance came from . 
  depends on which sort of christian/jew arre you . 
  i told you , because there 's nothing at stake for them . 
  they do n't live there . 
  because i believe it should n't be so . 
  for example , current croatian president ( who is already extremely unpopular ) won because of diaspora votes . 
  why the hell can some australian douchebag , who 's only been in croatia as tourist and who thinks being a croat means being an usta\u0161a , influence the events in a country that he does n't even live in in that manner ? 
  and if i 'm opposed to him voting , then it would be hypocritical if i reserved that right for me . 
  i do vote in slovenia , tho . 
  `` and i would just like to remind you of your democratic right and duty to vote in today 's elections . 
  go to the booth and vote for the party that 's aligned with your worldview , which is of course ** christian ** and ** democratic ** . 
  god bless you . '', 
  and , how did it feel ? 
  now , you see , that 's something i 'm opposed to .
