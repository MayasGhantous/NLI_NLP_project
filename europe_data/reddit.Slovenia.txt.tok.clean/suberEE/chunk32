  i have lived in slovenia for 14 years now , but since i 'm also a croatian citizen i have the right to vote in croatian elections . 
  but why would i do that ? 
  i do n't live there , i 'm not completely current with political events in croatia and even if i were , they do n't affect me directly . 
  that 's why i do n't vote . 
  i think permanent residence is more important than citizenship when it comes to voting rights . 
  too bad no government anywhere agrees with me . 
  they tried that in ukraine , did n't work . 
  which party do they vote for ? 
  do they still believe there 's only five years left til armageddon ? 
  bravo !, 
  bwahahahahah \\* wipes tears \\* oh , god bless you, 
  are you implying ep is hell ? 
  it dies n't sound like waltz when it 's running . 
  disappointing . 
  i think it 's obvious enough without being explicit . 
   can i be half serbian half polish ? 
  of course you ca n't . 
  half-breeds are traitors waiting to happen , everybody knows that . 
  imagine if serbia and poland went to war , on which side would you fight ? 
  what you need to do is let inferiority complex consume your life , and play up your polishness to the point of jingoism , support every nationalistic idiocy and generally make an ass out of yourself , hoping that maybe , maybe that will bury your wrong blood cells . 
  also the place that raised the [ funkiest man croatia has ever known ] ( https://youtu.be/fnpvpefg_8y ), 
  he 's already been put away for life , twice ? 
  okay , if france wants to burn loads of money for a symbolic gesture i guess it has the right to do so . 
  [ cut the balls ] ( https://youtu.be/80x0pbcv_t4 ) ( i was slightly disturbed when i talked in english with some exchange students and when they told me i sound like \u017di\u017eek without sniffing and lisp ), 
  is it possible that we all picked it up from germans ? 
  nobody said they were n't nationalists . 
  they 're atat\u00fcrk 's party after all . 
  hopefully you 'll grow up 4 or 5 years in . 
  if you did n't vote akp , you have nothing to apologize for . 
  we are aware that gollum and his slaves speak , at best , for their own voters only , and it 's difficult to tell how many of them still support him after all this dickery . 
  those who do would n't apologize anyway . 
  i do n't know what you 're talking about , cause the famous slovene inventor 's name was miklav\u017e teslo . 
  i do n't know about police , but i have some media connections . 
  if it 's scandalous , then it needs to be a scandal . 
  we actually did consider that option once her father started raising the bride price . 
  tell me about it . 
  suberee 's mom md follows a facebook page `` natural childhood '' in order to have a good laugh and/or outrage . 
  it 's insane how many posts there are in the vein of `` my kid should be vaccinated against tetanus soon , how to avoid it ? '', 
  in case you do n't know what tetanus looks like , here 's a [ nsfw ] ( https://asiseeit2000.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/neonataltetanus.jpg ) image . 
  and you can get it from something as simple as stepping on a nail or cutting your finger . 
  it would be just a place on the map if my mate did n't marry a kyrgyz girl . 
  [ i bet it looked like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vo5gwak.png ), 
  oh , you sweet summer child ... 
  wow , you can actually see the corridor on this one . 
  thus spoke bloomberg . 
  make complaining about jokes great again !, 
  nah , i upvoted you . 
  i took a few puffs the other night after a long while , and all it did was reminding me why i stopped : wooziness , hunger and stupidity are definitely not what i consider fun . 
  i 'll rather stick to coffee and cigarettes . 
  at least when i die from cancer , i 'll die sharp . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  croats fought the whole damn war with needles in their arms , that 's why they won , those softies serbs were only drunk all the time . 
  that 's because you 're from koper . 
  here in styria highschool kids binging on borovni\u010devec until they start vomiting black is a regular occurrence . 
  in celje it even happened that they left a girl passed out on the street in winter , because they were afraid they 'll get in trouble for underage drinking . 
  my mom received her in hospital with body temperature 34,9 \u00b0 . 
  a couple more hours and she 'd be dead . 
  well , we did recently have that guy who beat somebody up to death and streamed it live , so ... 
  it 's not a rarity , but it 's very expensive for a lunch ( it can easily reach 10 $ ) , so people prefer to go elsewhere . 
  i mean , you can easily find places that offer a full meal for 5 $ . 
  thank you , i 'll look for it . 
  jesus christ , that thread is a fucking trainwreck . 
   up until the 15th century there also existed christian timariotes i did n't know that . 
  not that i do n't believe you , but do you have any further reading ? 
  well , it 's not like they had a choice . 
  [ blood tax ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/devshirme ), 
  the problem with eastern europe is that regulations are messy and overbearing , and regulators are so worthless that at time it seems it 's only worth starting a business if you 're a crook . 
  i do n't see how to fix that without politics . 
  you mean , way back in middle ages as vassals , or do you mean mercenaries or as janissaries ? 
  because ottomans did n't really allow muslims in their army until after serbia left . 
  but it does n't even have to be turks , serbia was at some point at war with all of their neighbors except romanians , afaik . 
  he said , at this rate . 
  a miracle could happen and we could elect some capable politicians for a change . 
  communists who support private enterprise . 
  some communists . 
  is there anything similar in serbian history ? 
  because that letter sounds like something serbs would do . 
  * percentage of parliamentary seats held by women * hungary : 20,7 % in 1990 , 10,1 % in 2017 romania : 34,4 % in 1990 , 13,7 % in 2017, 
  okay , i have eaten a steak a few times . 
  there are [ various degrees of doneness ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jrifrd4.jpg ) , and if you ask me all of them are legit . 
  i like them medium-rare , my grandpa eats them only well-done . 
  but putting ketchup on your steak , if you are in a really good steakhouse , is just awful . 
  no , not that , i mean while they 're still serving their sentence . 
  sorry if that was n't clear . 
  hey , we have that tradition too !, 
  i just did n't know it has a name . 
  please , tell me that you also take care to buy a car bigger than your neighbor 's . 
  because there are people who agree with [ this guy ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39152562 ) , as unbelievable as it seems . 
  the reasoning is they forfeited their right to have a say when they committed the crime . 
  makes sense to me . 
  if you refuse to play by the rules you should n't define them . 
  they 're not official anywhere . 
  ouch . 
  edit : in my defence , i was drunk and sleepy when i posted that . 
  there 's 100 % chance of that . 
  everybody who lived back then is ancestor of everybody living today . 
  let 's celebrate the glory of the glorious slavs did i get it right ? 
  she 's just staying out of his personal bubble , it 's completely normal .
