   an internet paper expressing personal traits and basic physical info . 
  so , you can just write that you 're a panicky asthmatic with flat feet and you wo n't be called in ? 
  duh , everything on the wrong side of the channel is eastern europe . 
  i 'm enough of a cynical bastard that i find the whole sucettes thing funny as hell , as well as gainsbourg being in general amazingly scummy . 
  i mean , he sent france gall on eurovision with a song about her being his puppet . 
  he made a song about incest with a fitting music video starring his own daughter . 
  he made a paedophilic album . 
  he made another album about farting . 
  he made a reggae version of marseillaise that could only be more unpatriotic if he said `` aux armes , bla bla bla '' . 
  he made a song that consists basically of one three-minute orgasm . 
  i mean , you have to admire that . 
  plenty of people pose like they do n't give a fuck , but he , [ he actually never gave a fuck about anything ] ( https://youtu.be/yq7mqgsek0i ) . 
  and to top it all off , he was a terriffic songwriter . 
  what a guy . 
  merci , monsieur gainsbourg, 
  kra\u0161ki pr\u0161ut wins anyway . 
   the erc website does n't make mention of is contributiont proof-read , damn you, 
  grilled little turds made of minced meat with spices and sparkling water . 
  they taste divine if done right and awful if done wrong . 
  we usually eat them with lepinja , onions and ajvar and/or kajmak . 
  shit , now i realized i never ate \u0111uve\u010d in my life . 
  \u010cufte or \u0107ufte ? 
   do you understand what i mean by it ? 
  lemons and tomatoes , i.e. 
  sourness is not everybody 's thing , and sauce makes the dish simply a bit more rounded . 
  it 's quite understandible , do n't you think ? 
  no idea why * du * is with capital d , we write * ti * with a capital letter only when referring to god . 
  i do n't speak paprikash , is that a ring of schitzels with mashed potato in the middle ? 
  this is zombo.com . 
  welcome to zombo.com . 
  you can do anything . 
  anything you want , in zombo.com . 
  welcome . 
  but why vienna ? 
  it 's does n't belong to italy , in fact it never has ( just like dubrovnik ) , so do you call it by its italian name instead of its proper , german name ? 
  and btw : http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/ragusa_ ( enciclopedia-italiana ) /, 
  why do you call vienna be\u010d when it 's actually wien ? 
  where is the border between serbia abd montenegro ? 
  where people stop fucking your mother and start fucking your father . 
  much \u010dojstvo , very juna\u0161tvo . 
  [ best national anthem of europe ] ( https://youtu.be/gptpjmdtofk ) . 
  [ this guy ] ( https://youtu.be/iiptvxsdpqy ), 
  therefore croatia , never one to be upstaged , now does the same thing to serbia . 
  communism was defeated by capitalists driving bigger cars , having more stuff in supermarkets and listening to better pop music . 
  these jihadist morons seem to explicitlly reject all that . 
  what will it take to defeat their idea ? 
  cool , i guess that means food , beer and whor ... em , night-life stay dirt cheap for the foreseeable future . 
  yes , italian is very big on `` s '' and `` z '' sounds . 
  `` sbabadabuzzi '' is already better . 
  i wonder why . 
  of course it is , we learned it the last time this photo was posted . 
  [ czs vopilec ] ( http://rebrn.com/re/the-fearsome-czech-navy-2537757/ ), 
  ah shit , i forgot i have slovenian flair in / r/europe . 
  but that 's what we did , right up until 1868 . 
  because in a-u we had two bosses and we could keep switching alliances in order to remain autonomous . 
  franz josef was never the brightest bulb in the chandelier , and with years he only became dimmer and more stubborn . 
  to everybody 's dismay , he lived a long and quite unhappy life . 
  he eats only fresh fruit , abstains from alcohol and sex , sleeps properly and avoids all stress except when his grandpa comes home late at night from a whorehouse , blind drunk and starts preparing barbecue . 
  we could stop being a kingdom and become just a bunch of counties in hungarian republic . 
  our resistance to magyarization was mostly based on the fact that we were n't hungary . 
  let 's say china . 
  china . 
  china china china . 
  china , and then china . 
  china china china china china china china , i love china . 
  china china china china and also my china . 
  china china . 
  china . 
  china ? 
  china !, 
  i thought everybody in the world had a smartphone by now . 
  i mean people in some places are still dying of plague but it seems even they can at least post a snapchat of their bubons . 
  you mean [ his serene highness prince schwarzenberg and duke of krumlov ] ( http://img.reflex.cz/img/3/article/1500639_riha-prezident-volby-v4.jpg?v=4 ) ? 
  no shit . 
  who 'd ever guess that intelligence agencies spy on people ? 
  well you got rid of vietnam , that 's something . 
  what will you say when your child asks you why did n't you invest in eastern turkey ? 
  like in austria !, 
  because a civil union made between heterosexuals outside of church is also legally called a marriage . 
  but only kjv , other bibles are satan 's work . 
  they just renamed `` partnerska skupnost '' in `` partnerska zveza '' and made it equal in rights and obligations with a marriage . 
  basically it 's same-sex marriage in everything but name . 
  edit : except for adoption , it seems . 
  even though your queen is also your head of church ? 
  the thing is , technically it 's not a marriage but a `` partner relationship '' . 
  what 's new is that it 's made completely equal with a regular marriage , including the right to a ( civil ) wedding . 
  this particular slovenian guy is a native speaker of croatian . 
  unlike england , we have separation of church and state . 
  that 's * easy * . 
  * simple * is * jednostavno * . 
  we are sorry , but the top half is unavailable at the moment . 
  would you like an albania instead ? 
  yeah , basically . 
  our dukes could n't enforce their rule far from their seats , we were simply too primitive . 
  everybody was shmall back then . 
  this map sucks as far as western balkans is concerned . 
  [ this one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/map_of_the_western_balkans_around_814_ad.png ) is much better . 
  it 's wrong to talk about bosnians , serbs and croatians back then and think those terms mean the same as today . 
  identity back then was an entirely different beast than today . 
  people identified with all sorts of things , their region , their ruler , their tribe , and , most strongly , their religion .
