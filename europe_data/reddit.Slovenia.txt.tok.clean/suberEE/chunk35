  but , except religion and blood relationships , all those identites were very weak and unstable compared to today 's national identities . 
  sadly , because tribal organization dissolved in bosnia much earlier than , say , montenegro , it is impossible to know what tribe ancient bosnians belonged to . 
  they called their language `` slavic '' or `` our language '' , they knew what religion they belonged to ( catholic , orthodox , later bosnian church ) , and , at least since 12th century , they knew they live under bosnian ruler . 
  but all that , i repeat , does n't sum up to modern national identity . 
  the same thing is valid for medieval serbia and croatia too , but , unlike bosnia , they built their national identities earlier than bosnians - and those were built mostly around religion and region , and in many cases remained unclear until 20th century . 
  i 'm sorry if this came out confused , i 'm typing this on my phone . 
  truth be told , we do n't know if there was any group that called itself bosnians back in 814 . 
  what is for sure is that bosnia as a state ( and , therefore , bosnians as ethnicity ) started developing for real with ban kulin , way later , in 12th century . 
  as for dynastic links with serbian rulers - who gives a shit . 
  hungary-croatia was ruled by french , czech and lithuanian dynasties and we never became either french , czech or lithuanian , and they for sure did n't become hungarian . 
  okay , fair enough . 
  i 'll even give you that constantine porphyrogenitus wrote some places in eastern bosnia and herzegovina as part of serb lands . 
  but drawing in western bosnia as part of servia is just disingenuous . 
  first , borders in the balkans back then were n't defined at all . 
  second , at that point western bosnia was almost uninhabited , and people who lived there were for all intents and purposes outside of reach of any ruler . 
  third , we literally have no idea what tribe did the people there identify with , if they identified with any . 
  [ this map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/map_of_the_western_balkans_around_814_ad.png ) shows the political situation in 814 much better . 
  name checks out . 
  does it ? 
  servia seems to be everywhere except serbia . 
  can we ship them all to america and colonize the island with irish football fans ? 
  not where i lived . 
  the place was called `` ku\u0107ica '' , and `` spas za mene '' was what you had to yell in hide-and-seek when you reached ku\u0107ica in order to win . 
  my mom is a paediatrician . 
  based on what she observed with her patients , such abuse of the system is widespread , especially in rural areas . 
  okay , so in slovenia state is very generous to single mothers . 
  many couples , in order to take advantage of that , never register their partnership and keep different official addresses . 
  most of these kids actually live in families that are normal by all measures except official status . 
  i mean , wilders 's hair is enough reason for him to be put away . 
  not this shit again . 
  if that counts as newspeak , it 's a new kind : words do n't get butchered , meaning behind them does . 
  ok , let 's use eco 's checklist . 
  i include not only trump peronally but also the movement he 's the mouthpiece for . 
  1 ) cult of tradition - seems so 2 ) rejection of modernism - check 3 ) action for action 's sake - not sure 4 ) disagreement is treason - check 5 ) fear of difference - check , check , check 6 ) appeal to a frustrated middle class - check 7 ) obsession with plots - check 8 ) continuous shifting of rhetorical focus - lol , check 9 ) life is permanent warfare - looks that way , but i 'm still not sure 10 ) contempt for the weak - check !, 
  11 ) everybody is educated to be a hero - we do n't know yet 12 ) machismo - goddamn check 13 ) selective populism , anti-parliamentarism - yes , check 14 ) newspeak - too early , we 'll see . 
  so , for now it 's 9 of 14 . 
  not bad , trumpettes , you stink of mussolini . 
   147 you 're being [ too generous ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/disenfranchisement_after_the_reconstruction_era ), 
  needs to be fixed . 
  1 ) the officer is french , so the flag should be white . 
  2 ) italian grenadier should be fighting on the troll side . 
  3 ) latvian grenadier should be looking on the other side , just in case russia tries something . 
  4 ) bugarian soldier should be giving a coup de grace to the greek one and * enjoying it * . 
  but at least the spanish soldier was obviously just awoken from siesta , that one is correct . 
  i do n't get the first one .

  the cartoon version was made by probably the greatest slovenian cartoonist of all time , miki muster . 
  that scene in tibet when huge professor calculus smashed haddock with an umbrella while yelling `` checkmate ! '', 
  left me confused as a child . 
  oh yes . 
  slovenia : [ bojan ] ( https://youtu.be/k6lmh-bsaic ), 
  what 's the point of having parents if they do n't raise your kids while you work ? 
  the main character 's double sprung from the earth and flew away by his ( her ? ), 
  hands , and you ask what 's wrong with it . 
  nope , does n't ring a bell , although it apparently also aired on italia 1 , which i watched religiously as a kid . 
  of anime , me and the other kids watched lupin , sampei , detective conan , kenshiro , holly & benji , superauto mach 5 , dragon ball , pokemon ... and also , for some reason , charlotte and sailor moon :d, 
  the mole . 
  but that name does n't suit him . 
  i 'll just leave [ this ] ( http://img.datator.cz/tmp/1/17/175/17546e4560e66dd38ad826dfbed45cc0.jpg ) right here .

  of course , my dad fought against them for a few years . 
  nope , never seen . 
  people used to call me and my brother lolek and bolek - i was thin , grumpy and dark-haired while he was little , chubby and blonde . 
  these threads give me such a nostalgia trip . 
  i want to be a child again . 
  oh yeah , i spent a good part of my childhood watching this on italian tv . 
  ( why the hell did i always think this was canadian ? ), 
  this one is town because it got town rights in the middle ages . 
  that included the right to elect their own leaders , right to build walls , right to have guilds and to hold fairs and so on . 
  a town also had jurisdiction over surrounding villages . 
  it 's hard to erase the memory on that status , so it 's still a town in common parlance , although administratively hum has n't been one in a long time . 
  not the same hum . 
  voice actors ? 
  croatian : asterix , obelix , \u010cudomix , poluautomatix , vrhovnix , tamburix , metuzalemix , abecedix . 
  there are a lot of different serbo-croatian translations , but one ( i forgot the translator ) replaced those puns and references with ones familiar to our public . 
  it was a work of genius . 
  we used to have some really good comic translators . 
  the only time i was in osijek was some 10 years after the war and there was still much damage back then , so yes . 
  i do n't know how it is now . 
   slovenia 19 not surprised , considering we have only one proper airport . 
  back then tito was stalin 's closest ally . 
  notice how quickly after cominform affair were the greek partisans defeated ? 
  that 's because tito cut off support to an essentially stalin 's war . 
   slovenia russia and america are equally unpopular here , so i guess it was a question of the sample . 
  edit : i see this was asked after trump was elected . 
  i got ta say that trump is overwhelmingly * despised * here , way more than putin , so it probably had some effect on the result . 
  u/yuyuhunter is actually the great inquisitor .

  eu flag , french version, 
   they recently lost ethnic serb regions in bosnia and montenegro those regions were never part of serbia . 
  in 1913 serbia conquered north-western third of macedonia to great bulgarian dismay . 
  since then a new ethnicity developed there who called themselves macedonians , to even greater bulgarian dismay because they considered them bulgarians . 
  not many .
