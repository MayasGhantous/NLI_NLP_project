  carry them out if that 's what it takes . 
  good luck . 
  try increasing it . 
  although this pressure would already bend most other governments, 
  forget it , history as taught in bulgaria is the absolute bottom . 
  mythomania in slovenia is already ridiculous , in croatia it 's head-aching , in serbia it defies belief and all of us together ca n't hold the candle to bulgaria . 
  that 's election of a party leader . 
  pm is appointed , and then confirmed by parliamentary vote , which becomes important once the party who wins the election ca n't form the government because nobody wants to form coalition with it ( see the netherlands after the next elections ) . 
  and how is european parliament elected ? 
  do you directly elect your prime minister in greece ? 
  does the parliament in greece vote on confidence for every individual cabinet member ? 
  oversimplification . 
  democratic party covers so much terrain they definitely represent american left too . 
  in few words , time to learn german . 
  `` to throw out of office '' means something different in czechia . 
  referendum was already initiated , but they passed the decree anyway . 
  at this point it does n't matter anymore . 
  it wo n't be easy . 
  it took us three weeks and 65 injured people to get rid of one corrupt mayor . 
  but it can be done . 
  the most important thing is not to let it go . 
  [ the manure can be thrown out only by pitchforks .

  bring them out , lads . 
  salutes from [ maribor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%e2%80%9313_maribor_protests ), 
  and that was exactly the period in which ukraine lost crimea and donbass . 
   oleh tatarov , ** deputy chief of the ukrainian interior ministry 's main investigative directorate under yanukovych ** , claimed in january that '' [ t ] he theory we are looking at is the killing was by unidentified persons . 
  this is an official theory , and the unidentified persons could be various people , a whole host of them ... it could have been motivated by disruptive behavior , or with the aim of provocation . '', 
  he then claimed the cartridges and weapons used in the shootings were not police issue . 
  ca n't get a more credible and objective source than him . 
  because there is no uncontroversial definition of europe . 
  to you your posturing , to us our smugness . 
  edit to your ninja edit :  you have to think you are better than the rest says an american . 
  ah , you 're not even trolling , you 're like that naturally . 
  okay , good to know . 
   everything major europe has done was in lockstep with the us . 
  there is no way we are enemies like russia and china are 1 ) why should china be our enemy ? 
  2 ) otherwise i agree with you , now please tell the same thing to your administration . 
  um ... [ yes ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/centre_of_europe.jpg ) ? 
  i do n't know if you 're trolling or what . 
   lol where are the europeans reacting towards russia . 
  they invaded a sovereign european country 2 years ago and still causing problems in the ukraine . 
  http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/12/19-sanctions-russia/  also , who did you just call up to send thousands of troops and tanks to your eastern border to secure it properly . 
  the us . 
  yes . 
  before trump became president and before it started looking like he 'll do a 180 \u00b0 on foreign policy metters . 
   also , is the us financing right wing parties across europe ? 
  no its russia . 
  what are you currently doing about this direct threat to your elections ? 
  [ sorry for not doing stupid shit without thinking , like trump . 
  it obviously means nobody cares ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/europe-russia-hacking-elections/ )  or , where is the reaction towards china that is systematically trying to acquire technology by buying european companies in specific sectors ? 
  are their intentions hostile ?

   its not even in the same ballpark .

  maybe the best one . 
   the great sorcerers of the medicine split up the chest like an orange and into it they put the new heart ( carefully , with their fists closed , as though they return fallen sparrow to his nest ) , by scalpel they separate light from darkness in the turbid core of the retina , they cast spells , move the immovable , pull miracles on people , but again , even they can not bring me back my taken nineteenth . 
   never again . 
   but damn , at least i had twentieth . 
  twenty-first . 
  and some other twenties and thirties . 
   not like those boys whose photos framed in black i find every day at the last pages of the newspapers . 
  they were left somewhere in nineteenth . 
  in love . 
  playful . 
  confused . 
  they did n't get to separate their tin soldiers from the tin bullets , which were planted in their pockets by the godless evil old men . 
   no , brother cain , do n't call me in the field . 
  do n't lure me , it 's in vain , to walk through the mine field , my sinful olive-green brother . 
  put another volunteer on the trenches of your incompetence . 
  hang another target on your cardboard bastions . 
  there are no mine in this war of ours . 
   i know , that 's not how it goes . 
  burdock of treachery catches everywhere . 
  some hooligan 's going to stick it to my back , passing by , tapping me on the shoulder , allegedly friendly . 
  i thought about that . 
  who am i going to betray when it all comes to just the two of us ? 
   and , i 'm sorry , but i 'm too old to betray myself once again . 
   so , fuck off jna . 
  it was enough .

  i think srebrenik was actually built by hungarians .

  they are also the reason why slovenian coat of arms has those three stars .
