  maybe you would , if you did n't celebrate so much that one battle you lost . 
  say what you will , islamic world always seemed to be pretty big on personal hygiene . 
  `` and how will presidential system stop terrorism ? '', 
  `` why , with ~ \u273d ** magic ** \u273d ~ ! '', 
  one person said something racist , title makes it sound as it was the whole crowd . 
  seems the last five generations of slovenian graduates all moved to austria . 
  credit goes to bora \u010corba, 
   we have a brand of wine named teran , which croatians want to run away with . 
  if they do , they will cause the whole world to sell wine under that name . 
  the teran dispute pisses me off to no end . 
  you see , teran is characteristic of istria . 
  whole istria , the croatian part and slovenian part . 
  so however this dispute gets resolved , it will be unfair . 
  croatia wins , slovenian istrian producers of teran lose the name of their wine . 
  slovenia wins , the same thing happens to croatian istrian winemakers . 
  while croatia does n't want slovenian coastline , there is this border dispute in istria , which happened because in yugoslavia the municipalities on the border wanted to cut costs and joined some paperwork ... which allowed both ljubljana and zagreb to interpret as it suited them at the moment . 
  meanwhile , who got the shorgt end of the stick ? 
  we , who lived close to the border , who knew how irrelevant the whole dispute is , and who had to deal with non-stop traffic jams every time our governments decided to bitch again . 
  it 's not enough that we , who ended on the croatian side of the border , were cut off from the nearest bigger city ( koper ) , from our local hospital ( izola ) , from the place where we used to go for coffee ( portoro\u017e ) . 
  our governments just absolutely had to use us as pawns for their idiotic dick-measuring contests and to stroke their fragile egos . 
  god , how i wish ljubljana and zagreb just left us istrians alone . 
  it 's a meme . 
  we say it to mildly annoy italians and because of warm and fuzzy yugonostalgic feelz . 
  slovenians are at first very reserved by balkanic standards , which makes them seem very uptight and cold . 
  but oh , once they get drunk ... 
   ... oh , and it 's a balkan country , right ? 
  this is gon na trigger somebody . 
  okay . 
  find a place in ljubljana because it 's in the middle of the country and everything is two hours drive at max from there ; you can also look around the city a bit , but it is n't as pretty as usual in winter . 
  for a trip to austrian-baroque times , look at old part of the town ; ljubljana castle has been freshly redecorated and it 's very much worth a visit ; for alternative/subculture stuff , find metelkova . 
  obligatory recommendation : bled . 
  when people say slovenia is cute they think of bled . 
  nearby is another super-pretty place , bohinjsko jezero . 
  it 's less hyped , but as amazing . 
  postojna cave is also close to ljubljana , it 's indeed spectacular . 
  if you are willing to ride a bit longer , check the upper so\u010da valley for another breathtaking mountain scenery ( narnia irl ) or piran for our own little slice of italy . 
  a plave which is not as well-known but has incredible scenery ( natural bridges and all ) , find rakov \u0160kocjan . 
  it 's not as easily accessible as the rest of the places i mentioned , though . 
  and i must do a bit of advertisement for eastern slovenia , since nobody ever comes here : ruins of celje castle and charterhouse \u017di\u010de , old town in ptuj and logarska dolina . 
  i hope i helped a bit , 
  you are not completely wrong , but you are exaggerating . 
  a lot . 
  are you looking for nature or culture ? 
  the problem is , with all its flaws , us was better at being the boss than basically anyone else . 
   cbr.ru russia denies it 's currency reserves are close to depleted . 
  we do n't have mass shootings every first tuesday . 
  i hope so . 
  fuck me if i know . 
  i really do n't get what trump wants to achieve by turning against eu . 
  why is it inevitable ? 
  they can easily arrange to divide europe , fuck china and divide the spoils fraternally . 
  i think you may get sued for child support anyway . 
  i do n't really know , i do n't have kids and if one happened i 'd take responsibility . 
  every time someone posts something in vein , a men 's rights warrior appears out of woodwork and starts talking about men 's reproductive rights and financial abortion . 
  mark me words , they 'll come . 
  inb4 `` male reproductive rights '', 
  okay , and when did king of east francia become king of germans , or king of romans ? 
  because the emperor would be crowned three times , as king of germans/romans in aachen , king of italy in pavia and ( holy ) roman emperor in rome . 
  no , it was already hre . 
  otto i was crowned emperor in 962 . 
  til there were welfs who were n't the same welfs who beefed with hohenstaufens . 
  let 's say you 're a citizen of slovenia . 
  you get arrested for something in burkina faso . 
  there is no slovenian embassy in burkina faso , but there is a french one . 
  you can ask for consular protection from french embassy by the right of being a citizen of eu . 
  i 'm not french , i 'm just shitposting from a safe distance . 
  i 'm croatian-slovenian . 
  i know that in one case , a mafioso with croatian and bulgarian citizenship was wanted for something abroad . 
  croatia also , by constitution , must n't extradite their own citizens , and it also ca n't simply revoke citizenship . 
  so they revised his process of gaining citizenship , found a random irregularity , declared his citizenship null and void , and extradited him . 
  laws can be changed . 
  i do n't know if it 's necessary though , because there must be some loopholes to revoke his citizenship , especially since he 's a citizen of poland too . 
  okay . 
  the guy 's a brilliant movie director and very knowledgeable about films . 
  he earned his place in film panels . 
  what france should do is let him sit on that panel , and then arrest and extradite him to us . 
  i 'm glad that you liked it here , but you need to know that metaldays , overjam , metelkova and similar are just one side of the medal . 
  there is another slovenia that is n't so visible , which is very reactionary and conservative even if not that religious . 
  that slovenia twice prevented gay marriage via referendum . 
   catholics are the majority . 
  are they ? 
  catholics were 72 % in 1991 , 58 % in 2002 , and we do n't know their percentage in 2011 because they conveniently did n't collect that kind of data in the census . 
  that 's called hippocratic oath , and i thought it was used everywhere . 
  i looked up his tiramis\u00f9 recipe . 
  just ... why ? 
  ** istrian \u017egvacet ** you need : * 500 g/1 lb of chicken wings , thighs and/or drumsticks * with * bones and skin * olive oil * one large onion , chopped * 1 glass of dry white wine * 1 can of pelati * salt , pepper * marjoram and/or thyme heat the olive oil in a large saucepan and add chicken . 
  you need to fry it until it starts sticking to the bottom of the pan . 
  then add onion and continue frying until onion starts sticking ( remember , first chicken , then onion ) . 
  next add pelati and leave on slow fire until they reduce and start sticking to the bottom of the pan . 
  then add wine , salt , pepper and marjoram or thyme and wait until alcohol evaporates , at which point it is ready to serve . 
  the trick is in burning chicken , onion and pelati * juuust a bit * . 
  real masters know how to make it look as dark as beef goulash but without it tasting burnt . 
  but it tastes really good even if it 's red . 
  it should be served with [ fu\u017ei ] ( http://www.chasingthedonkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2837554114_8312cac7e3_b.jpg ) , but if you ca n't find that pasta i suppose penne could do the trick as well . 
  hm , national . 
  the thing is , slovenia consists of three very different regions . 
  littoral was always under heavy italian influence , prekmurje was part of hungary until 1918 and the middle part was more or less oriented to austria , so even cuisine developed differently in each part . 
  i do n't know if there 's any dish which is really `` national '' , that is , traditional for the entire country . 
  but if you want typical foods , [ sure , we have a lot of them ] ( https://www.slovenia.info/uploads/publikacije/en/okusiti_slovenijo_2013_ang_web__pub.pdf ) .
