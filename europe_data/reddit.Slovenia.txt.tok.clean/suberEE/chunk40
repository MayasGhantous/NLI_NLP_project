  you sure ? 
  at the moment serbia is practically a single-party state , there is no opposition worth mentioning , plus polls give a clear edge to nikoli\u0107 . 
   \u010ceska your * \u0161 * dropped a caron , here you go : \u02c7, 
  sometimes i wonder the same thing . 
  it looks like it would be cool if my town still had a large german minority like it had until 1945 , but then again , those same germans could n't wait to welcome hitler . 
  all europeans are equal , but some are more equal than others . 
  blood sausages best sausages . 
  i respectfully disagree . 
  so that they do n't make the same mistake over and over again . 
  like serbia , for instance . 
  and hopefully not last . 
  especially now that upcoming us leadership seems to be openly hostile towards eu . 
   given we have the biggest military in europe active personnel : france 222.200 , germany 186.450 , italy 176.000 , uk 169.150 aircraft : france 395 , uk 278 attack helicopters : france 293 , uk 285 mbts : greece 1.354 , poland 926 , cyprus 482 , romania 437 , germany 410 , spain 343 , uk 227 aircraft carriers : italy 2 , uk 1 nukes : france 300 , uk 225, 
  til taiwan is not a state . 
  let 's put it this way . 
  it 's the musical equivalent of surstr\u00f6mming . 
  now imagine it with [ this orchestration ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpoi-awnd9m ) . 
  or sung [ this way ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyfxtrtiybk ) . 
  yes . 
  [ velika planina ] ( http://www.velikaplanina.si/home ) . 
  we have normal relations . 
  our friendship in 1991 should n't be overstated , and neither should our current issues . 
  despite our fm being a jackass ( foreign policy has never been slovenia 's strong suit ) , there are no unsolvable problems and no deep-rooted animosities other than the usual small neighbourhood rivalries . 
  in fact , i can tell you from observation that the political discourse in slovenia has grown a lot less xenophobic and anti-croatian than it was back when i moved to slovenia , 14 years ago . 
  basically , while our relations are a bit worse than dano-swedish , they are nowhere nearly as bad as serbian-albanian , for instance . 
   i 'm reasonably certain west russia can not join nato . 
  trump would never say that . 
  he 'd say something like : `` nato . 
  i love nato . 
  i say nato is old junk . 
  russia ca n't join it . 
  \\* shrug \\* ca n't join it . '', 
  was n't there a minor scandal when it turned out all our bees were dying ? 
  for people who could n't afford a yugo . 
  in otger words , waste resources on criticizing wastefulness . 
  sturgeon 's law . 
  the more crap you publish , the more quality stuff will sneak through . 
  what 's your opinion on pi\u0142sudski ? 
  but they earned it through hard work and taking risks , so everything 's cool . 
  is / s really necessary ? 
   are you a communist ? 
  chill down mccarthy, 
  central asian stans are still very pro-russian . 
  the mainstream moderates were quite happy with death squads back then too . 
  no , i 'm the last person to say that , because communist rule was , culturally , one of the best period central-eastern europe ever enjoyed . 
  im just saying that writing about communist themes does n't make you soviet . 
  lem was very much polish . 
  he wrote in polish , his literary style is primarily based on polish literature . 
  that 's like calling vladimir bartol ( he wrote alamut , the novel assassin 's creed is based on ) an italian writer , because his themes were militarism , power of propaganda , collectivism etc. , all of which are related to fascist italy . 
  edit : just for clarity , he was born in trieste , but he wrote exclusively in slovenian . 
  not really , no . 
  how come all plagues miss poland ? 
  they do , mostly . 
  this `` border dispute '' is just an opportunity for politicians to engage in dick-measuring contest whenever their popularity slips . 
  with each passing year people give less fucks about it . 
  who 's getting biha\u0107 and sanski most ? 
  who 's getting mostar ? 
  who 's getting vitez and kiseljak ? 
  who 's getting srebrenica ? 
  you know damn well you ca n't split bosnia without ethnic cleansing .

   controversial so what ? 
  yeah , i noticed from the very beginning that we 're not talking about the same thing at all . 
  maybe it 's the `` is europe empty '' part that made it seem to me that it was about abandoning land completely and not just about not making it prosperous . 
  also because the original article is about a village beind abandoned , not just poor . 
  my point is : who are the bulgarians who stayed in bulgaria ? 
  where did get their name from ? 
  where did they get their state from , and i talk about medieval state , the one that had access to three different seas ( hue ) and the one that left enough of an imprint that you did n't all assimilate into turks ? 
  bulgarians , as a nation as it is now , only exist because old bulgarians moved from the steppe , settled in the balkans and amalgamated with pre-existing slavic population , which again , moved from behind carpathians and amalgamated with pre-existing roman population and so on . 
  so , again , regarding what u/nhorfr said :  that 's how europeans did it , right ? 
  we built our nations by abandoning our homes , going to more successful nations , and settling there instead . 
  that 's exactly what we did . 
  we built our nations by abandoning our homes in woods or swamps or steppes , went to more successful nations and settled there instead . 
  since the fall of roman empire , that 's how france , spain , united kingdom , italy , slovenia , croatia , bosnia , serbia , montenegro , bulgaria and turkey came to be , and i probably forgot to mention some . 
  none of them would exist in their present form without immigration , so naturally there would be no wealth and societies to build . 
  ( also , mention of 500 years under turks : check . 
  you guys are like a broken record . ), 
  okay , maybe i 've overslept the last decade or something , but is n't m5s supposed to be eurosceptic and alde super pro-eu ? 
  my thesis is that [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5mwi1l/dreaming_of_europe_the_last_young_man_left_in_a/dc6xcwv/ ) is a crock of shit , because yes , that is how we did it . 
  aw fucking hell , i double-posted and then deleted both my comments . 
  shit . 
  anyway , to continue in the same vein , how many bulgarians are there living around azov sea ? 
  [ lol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/migration_period ), 
  i can handle that . 
  before i moved to slovenia i thought it was basically germany from stereotypes , then i had to face the fact it 's just balkan lite . 
  i 'm talking about 1853-1877 period , after commodore perry forced japan to abandon that policy . 
  [ basic course of finnish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh63n0gyvxm ), 
  the government has more important stuff to do , like banning abortion and crowning jesus . 
  but seriously , why the fuck did n't they do to japan the same thing they did to china ? 
  they started the same way , gunboat diplomacy , unequal treaties and such , but once meiji era kicked off they just kinda gave up . 
  [ i saw her that night ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25644409-i-saw-her-that-night ) by drago jan\u010dar . 
  fantastic , complex novel about ww2 . 
  dude . 
  i do n't want you to protest and suffer . 
  matter of fact i 'd be happy if eu and russia were equal partners . 
  but as long as putin stays the boss nothing will change . 
  russians will end up in jail for dissenting , cold war will go on . 
  we ca n't get rid of putin for you . 
  as for oligarchs , did anyone send extradition warrants ? 
  and ?
