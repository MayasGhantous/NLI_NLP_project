  stuff of national importance ( nuclear power plant , highways , railway , port , parts of construction industry ) remain owned by state . 
  the rest was sold off piecemeal , in order to prevent tycoons to rise up and to allow time for small entrepeneurs to emerge . 
  some companies were returned or compensated to pre-communist owners , mostly church . 
  note that it did n't go exactly as planned . 
  there was quite an ugly period when socialist monstruosities folded which brought to a temporary astronomic unemployment . 
  state-owned companies often serve as slush funds for their managers . 
  tycoons emerged anyway . 
  our long-term growth rate is quite meh . 
  the great recession lasted for untolerably long here . 
  but at least we avoided the societal collapse russia and the rest of ex yugoslavia went through . 
  i slipped a bit on ice yesterday .

  some of them , on the other hand , develop an identity crisis and start getting so much in touch with their roots that they become a self-parody . 
  for example , look at redditor kontaktnicenter . 
  he 's a 3rd generation ( repeated for emphasis , 3rd ) serbian immigrant to slovenia . 
  he regularly annoys users at r/serbia with his turbo-nationalist and completely retarded opinions . 
  guys like him were the first to start shooting when shit hit the fan here in the 90 's . 
   most of the people here are men - though aid agencies say there are significant numbers of teenagers among them , some of whom would be classed as unaccompanied minors . 
  of course . 
   but desperate migrants say they will wait it out until the border opens they might want to start learning serbian in that case .

  it 's when you hear somebody speaking and you do n't immediately think `` ah , he 's from that part of the country '' .
