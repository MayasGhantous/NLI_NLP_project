  in that case , jews would have nowhere to go except usa or the continent that tried to exterminate them within living memory . 
  it 's pretty understandible that people get touchy in that situation . 
  every day is a good day for #freedom, 
  chocolate , please . 
  this year was really sad , i need a bit of happiness now that it 's ending . 
  it 's still hilarious . 
  italians have never trusted their government , and what little good will there was evaporated after tangentopoli . 
  it turned out reality was much darker than anyone 's worst imagination . 
  and then to stuff yourself with goose/turkey as soon as clock shows midnight . 
  deal . 
  but you must upload a video of it to liveleak as proof . 
  a signal is a signal is a signal . 
  brace yourselves . 
  what 's the police doing , is there any intensifying of the search efforts or extra precautions ? 
  if i 'm not mistaken you 're still in state of emergency , and if daesh is up to anything now is the time to get them surrounded . 
  what is this ? 
  i stopped following ac after black flag because their system requirements became too damn high . 
  you 're right . 
  fixed . 
  what about modern ussr game ? 
  find the rare people wishing to help you , evade nkvd and break through fortified borders . 
  splinter cell would have nothing on it . 
  one is ancient delicacy of venetian aristocracy , the other is mindless cash grab by milanese hacks . 
  and you 're right , it 's memetastic . 
  you got it backwards . 
  [ the question ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/5fzqps/referendum_attenti_a_come_votate/ ) is `` do you approve of compulsory insertion of fruit coated in sugar syrup , known as candied fruit , into the recipe of christmas cake commonly known as pandoro ? '', 
  this is a question of human dignity , people, 
  you can buy me pandoro instead . 
  i completamente agree . 
  but if we are ready to make the necessary sacrifices , pandorism will prevail in 2016 !, 
  the `` yes '' side wants to make the dough tougher and to liberally add multiple kinds of colourful confectionery to it . 
  the `` no '' side wants the things to stay as they are now : soft , easily breakable and covered with lots of sugar . 
  candied fruit . 
  wow , 400 words and not a single one makes sense, 
  [ oto pestner ] ( http://www.cd-cc.si/pic/galerija//y2015/m02/6195-60-let-vse-najboljse-6195//g1.jpg ), 
  not much , because i do n't have a lot . 
  for what it 's worth i regularly go for coffee and baklava at their restaurant , does that count ? 
  german spies have been ridiculously useless for ages . 
  http://www.cracked.com/article_20771_5-attempts-at-espionage-that-seem-too-dumb-to-be-real.html - check # 4 and # 2 . 
  where are you from ? 
  yes . 
  that 's the problem , i 'm not denying that . 
  and even bigger problem is that those who do go against the grain do n't even get sympathy or help from the majority , because we all learned to watch our backs when dealing with them . 
  tbh i do n't thibk we 'll ever reach a solution . 
  thumbs up . 
  i said it before and i 'll say it again : while it 's undeniable that romani tend to shun assimilation and usually choose to stay on the margins of society , discrimination and refusal to give opportunities does n't help at all . 
  read the article . 
  it 's quarterly growth . 
  exactly . 
  the term you 're looking for is representative democracy . 
  a republic is a country which elects or appoints its head of state for a fixed term . 
  a monarchy is a country where the position of the head of state is inherited and has no term limits . 
  sweden , the netherlands , the uk , australia and new zealand are monarchies and representative democracies , but not republics . 
  this `` republic '' definition i only found in texts from the usa , and i think it 's just the way some radical republicans try to discredit democrats . 
  we do n't buy that in europe . 
  shit you 're right , how come i never noticed that the united kingdom is a republic ? 
  but please , do oust cerar at the next elections and bring jan\u0161a back . 
  why have a pm that does n't do anything ~ ~ at all ~ ~ stupid and lets the markets do their thing , when we can have an angry , corrupt , wannabe-orban dickhead who insists on avenging grudges dating to maria theresia and who likes to keep his country in state of perpetual crisis ? 
  i remember in 2003 when me and my mates all intently watched their performance on eurosong because we all made bets whether they 'll make out or not . 
  they did n't . 
  we were 14 at that time . 
  fake and gay . 
  no , umm , fake and ... not gay . 
  straight . 
  i mean ... 
  that 's rich coming from an american . 
  \u266a imagine there 's no heaven ... \u266b, 
  we pretend she does n't exist . 
  edit : so my brother 's gf once watched tv when melania was talking about how she grew up in communism and poverty and how she loves america etc. , and at one point mumbled `` shut up bitch , you 'll draw attention to us . '', 
   slovenia , homeland of melania trump ah for fuck 's sake . 
  can everyone pls go back to calling us tiny ? 
  there was no theory . 
  israel is a major western ally in the area , but it 's not a part of nato or any formal alliance and is fiercely independent . 
  i genuinely wonder what would their opinion be on permanently stationing nato troops inside their country . 
  ( i 'm pretty pro-israeli otherwise . ), 
  but [ `` kraj ' '' ] ( https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/reconstruction:proto-slavic/kraj%d1%8c ) did mean `` the end '' in proto-slavic ( and it still does in serbo-croatian languages ) . 
  thus `` borderland '' . 
   illirians ( present day italians ) wat, 
  i heard once that hrvat means `` landowner '' . 
  gr\u00fcezi it is . 
  while it 's very clear that there 's only one thing that can reverse this trend and save our welfare states , i doubt much people would be willing to do it . 
  i 'm in my late 20 's now and , how things are going , i do n't see myself having kids for another 15 years ( at which point my newborns would probably have three heads with half brain or something . ), 
  kids demand huge sacrifices and make life miserable for no immediate reward . 
  today , we are able to avoid having them . 
  so we use that ability . 
  what would israel say if nato asked them nicely to use one of their airbases ? 
  `` damn those muricans and their understanding of history and geo ... oh , it 's executivemonkey . 
  okay then . '', 
  or * zdravo * if i suspect the person i 'm greeting supports olimpija . 
  bring back old viennese etiquette , i say . 
  did n't know that . 
  thanks . 
  so ... their relationship will be sapphic ? 
  [ this never gets old . 
  there were huge [ interal differences ] ( https://chnm.gmu.edu/1989/items/show/671 ) tho . 
  you know , riding on a high horse and pretending we are above that bullshit when the world still runs on bullying helps nobody . 
  those graphs would look much different without kosovo . 
  maybe you had an exception as an officer . 
  but my parents remember the `` odd-even '' system very well . 
  yes , it depended on license plates .
