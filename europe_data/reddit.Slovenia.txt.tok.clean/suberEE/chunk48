  jna took over the training center of territorial defence , people were protesting and a tank ran over one of them , right in front of my highschool . 
  there 's a small military ceremony in that place every year . 
  it looks like they have the next election in the bag ( although here everything can change in a matter of weeks ) . 
  i know i 'm not supposed to say that , but this does draw some parallels with the reformation . 
  european wars of religion also started at the moment when papal prestige was at its absolute lowest for [ similar reasons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pope_alexander_vi ) . 
  the saddest/dumbest thing about the helicopter incident is that the pilot was a slovenian guy . 
  anyway , yugoslavian army did try to break out the barracks and to capture border crossings and airfield in co-ordination with additional units coming in from croatia . 
  but it was executed incredibly poorly . 
  it should be studied in war schools as an example of how not to execute a military operation . 
  tanks were sent in without infantry support , there was no air cover , soldiers were coming from republics which sympathized with slovenia * and * they were n't told what they 're exactly doing , and - wait for it - the whole action was planned on the premise that slovenians wo n't fight back . 
  incredible . 
  so , naturally , when they did fight back all went to shit really quickly . 
  out of some 20 000 yugoslavian soldiers who participated in the action , 190 were kia or wia , but 4 944 were captured by slovenian forces . 
  that 's 25 % of whole yugoslavian manpower captured . 
  in ten days . 
  nuff said . 
  my dad was a signal officer in the war , and part of his job was to listen to any radio communication he could catch , including ham radio . 
  so one day he listened to this conversation : `` so how is it on the serbian side ? '', 
  `` fuck it . 
  i 'm in some cave near plitvice , it 's cold and wet . 
  what about you ? '', 
  `` i 'm still in petrinja , been on patrol yesterday . '', 
  `` really ? 
  i 'm from petrinja too . 
  how is it there ? '', 
  `` could be worse . 
  you are from petrinja you say ? 
  where did you live ? '', 
  `` i lived ... [ describes the location ] . '', 
  '' ... holy shit !, 
  i know you , you went to my school . 
  what the hell are you doing among \u010detniks ? 
  you were always a normal guy . '', 
  `` truth be told , i have no idea . '', 
  dumbest war ever . 
  i 'd just use this opportunity to say that the town still is n't completely repaired and that its area is among the very poorest in croatia . 
  right now not much is being done , because the political parties prefer to keep the city a monument to destruction in the open , so that they could score cheap political points before every election . 
  but that situation ca n't last forever , so when croatia finally gets a capable government ... pls invest in eastern croatia , thank you . 
  oh yeah , and there 's also that one russian opera singer in ljubljana who 's even married to a slovenian guy !, 
  shit , that explains everything, 
  nah , just your regular sds-voting , croatia-hating-yet-spending-every-summer-on-croatian-coast village idiot . 
  like hell we are . 
  this is bait . 
  do n't bite the bait . 
  either that , or reporting of them increased by 700 % .

  anyway , according to cro wikipedia , this is hiav `` stra\u0161ko '' , produced in factory `` torpedo '' in rijeka in ' 91 , and it was supposed to be used as an apc . 
  i would n't say anything if things like that did n't happen with papacy too , all the time . 
  and yet cavour did n't abolish it . 
  italy today seems to me quite a normal , secular country . 
  i do n't know , i just think that having a small theocratic exclave in topkapi palace would be better than having a situation where a movement crazy as isis can claim to be legit because there is no supreme authority to condemn them . 
  ok , serious question : was it really necessary to abolish the caliphate too back then ? 
  because i imagine the situation in the sunni world would be much simpler if there was a responsible and controllable religious head . 
  and [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/givgujj6rxu ) is a worthwile film on the topic , from a bit earlier era , when you could n't consult google in case of doubt . 
  granted , it 's only about art forgery , but even so it demonstrates nicely how even experts ' opinions can be totally worthless . 
  what 's needed is genuine critical thinking , ca n't emphasize that enough . 
  we should 've sticked to `` on the sunny side of the alps '', 
  that distinction distinction goes to italy ( who else ? ) .

  no , sorry , this is just sadism .

  his party won the elections , democratically elected head of state offered him mandate to form government , he formed coalition with nationalists that gave him parliamentary majority and parliament confirmed his mandate . 
  the same system works in practically every european country today . 
  the scary thing about hitler 's rise to power is precisely that it was a democracy legitimately electing a tyrant .

  the thing is , there are two slovenias . 
  one is the one tourists visit and find cute . 
  the other is the one out of pretty much anyone 's sight ; it does n't really even appear in media much . 
  one is urban , the other is rural . 
  one is secular , xenophile and liberal , the other is catholic , xenophobe and conservative . 
  the outcome of any elections just boils down to which slovenia will go to the polls in greater numbers than the other . 
  and they hate each other 's guts . 
  [ two slovenias collide on reddit  ( https://i.imgur.com/uhmvdal.png )  - we have different histories , true . 
  but do you still wear carniolan folk costume , feast zeleni jurij , sing old folk songs ? 
  that 's the heritage that , apart from awakening at some events , has no relevance in the life of an average slovenian . 
   so , how would you describe the difference between the life of an average slovenian and a bosnian in slovenia ?
