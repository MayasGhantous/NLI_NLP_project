  you know , at first i thought gotovina basically admitted his guilt by going into hiding . 
  but then i found out what hdz did to bla\u0161ki\u0107 . 
  for the uninitiated : croatian `` patriotic '' officials basically sabotaged his defence in order to make him the scapegoat for hdz criminal policies in bosnia . 
  yeah , with such support i 'd hide too . 
  i think that you will have to get off your high horse once something goes off in germany . 
   i find it worrisome that all the top-voted comments are racist rants with a `` we have to take action '' mindset , while the best mindet is , of course , `` keep calm and die proudly '' . 
  i 'm not saying we need to expel muslims or invade syria , in fact , i think that 's exactly the thing we must n't do . 
  but we ca n't just let killer groups run around the continent and massacre people every few months . 
  the `` move across the ocean '' model ? 
  it 's too early to say that . 
  at some point in 70 's in really looked like communism is winning . 
  [ hilarious guy . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vres6clmj-8 ), 
  ahh , just like bad old times . 
  it 's not an official policy , and good folks that boycot you are the same good folks who insist on completely open borders and europe shutting up and taking the explosions , because colonialism . 
  i do n't boycot you . 
  i just do n't like jaffa cookies . 
  i 'm an immigrant myself . 
  once fascists get rid of arabs , they 'll come for me . 
  are you on some kind of pills ? 
  because you should be . 
  so we can as well show everybody they 're right . 
  well , since i live almost literally next to the route immigrants take to get to austria , i can confirm : we are n't letting them in by the millions anymore . 
  okay ? 
  i ca n't magically make the millions that are already in disappear . 
  and then al qaeda would be the boss again . 
  or something else would sprout . 
  we wo n't go far with wishful thinking . 
  there is no `` their own lands '' , they have their outposts in fucking nigeria and uzbekistan . 
  they want the world . 
  they 're like commies , containment wo n't work . 
  germans tried that in yugoslavia in ww2 . 
  any partisan that got caught was killed , any family that produced partisans had somebody sent to camps as retaliation , any german casualty meant ten local hostages shot . 
  despite all of that , the number of partisans was only growing the whole war . 
  or vietnam . 
  so much emphasis on body count and vietcong was never even close to giving up . 
  brute force by itself does n't win ideological wars . 
  it 's hearts and minds , especially minds . 
  i just do n't know how . 
  but do they want the change ? 
  i mean , some obviously do , those that started the facebook revolution and arab spring , but is there enough of them ? 
  because the whole shabang got taken over by islamists very quickly . 
  it 's kinda late for that now . 
  that 's a horrible option , because then isis could present itself as freedom fighters against oppressive west and consequently become even stronger . 
  any other ideas ? 
  now imagine the surprise when it turns out that invasion is aimed at kurds , not isis . 
  so an obscure terrorist group takes over a patch of desert and founds a dystopian genocidal state . 
  then its leaders , who are true believers in an apocalyptic cult but still quite smart , declare a caliphate and declare war on the whole world . 
  it can be presumed that the powerful and rich countries in the west , who have the means to literally vaporize them , wo n't be too happy about such a development . 
  buz wait !, 
  not everything is so bleak !, 
  western countries have an achilles ' heel : well-intentioned but clueless youth , who do n't have a slightest idea about the situation on the ground , but who are wery well-informed about western history of colonialism and feel intense guilt over it . 
  such people are truly allah 's gift . 
  they will always recognize signs of that horrible , horrible colonialist and orientalist attitude if their governments ever decide to actually do something about caliphate 's crimes . 
  they wo n't have any idea what islam is , but they will still feel the need to protect in the name of righting the wrongs of colonialism , so they 'll be easily buy the story that isis ' interpretation of islam is the correct one , and then obstruct denunciations of it because they would be islamophobic . 
  they wo n't know that arabic unity is an illusion , that people in the middle east identify more with their countries than pan-arabism , that syrians are sneaky assholes in iraqi eyes and iraqis uneducated hicks to syrians ( and all of them less than human in kuwaiti eyes ) . 
  they 'll think all those divisions are purely the consequence of the western divisive and exploitative tactics . 
  they 'll feel , somewhere deep inside , that isis is righting the wrongs their colonial ancestors committed . 
  that properly intervening against them is just revival of colonialism . 
  that the west should take any beatings isis dishes to it , because everything is the west 's fault , after all , and it 's only just for the colonialists to suffer a bit . 
  all those people need is a little reminder of what their grandfathers did . 
  so they published that video that mentioned sykes-picot . 
  they said that because they knew what effect it would have on people like you . 
  they need more than just suicide bombers or cannon fodder . 
  they need * enablers * . 
  stane sever should be up there too . 
  * ( this is my best attempt at translating the [ top comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/croatia/comments/4beojq/najve%c4%87i_skandal_u_povijesti_hrvatske_vojske_na%c5%a1i/d18rwv8 ) by / u/nedokazan from the equivalent thread on / r/croatia . 
  there 'll be loads of mistakes , sorry in advance . 
  ) * first things first , when they were deciding about refurbishment of mig 's , experts , technicians and pilots from croatian air force ( caf ) were all against giving the job to romanian aerostar and in favor of ukrainian ukrspetseksport , since they were extremely dissatisfied with the refurbishment that romanians provided the last time ( especially with the responder and radio-equipment ) . 
  mod and council for defence both concluded that the ukrainian offer was one million euros cheaper ; that their production line for refurbishment of mig 's was in operation , unlike the romanian one ; that they had 5 mig 's ready that croatia wanted to purchase ; and it was concluded that they even had more spare parts . 
  refurbishing 40-years-old aircraft which are out of production so that they could guard croatian sky was a stop-gap measure , which hdz ministers ( including a three-year sdp mandate ) were postponing from 2000 to 2012 . 
  * romanian side did not complain about the results of the procurement . 
  * second , since it was a business worth 20-odd million euros after all , there were all sorts of `` lobbyists '' . 
  the only two journalists that seriously follow the air force , denis krni\u0107 and kre\u0161imir \u017dabec from eph , wholeheartedly rooted for the romanian firm . 
  on june 6 2013 session of the parliamentary council for defence , the opposition deputies gave their blessing for the procurement . 
  minister kotromanovi\u0107 [ said on the session of the council ] ( http://obris.org/hrvatska/velike-vojne-nabave-pred-ocima-odbora-za-obranu/ ) that some people in mod were dismissed because of lobbying and pressure from both sides , and that he reported the pressures and lobbying to the ministry of the internal affairs ; he mentioned journalists too . 
  croatian generals association , carried by \u017dabec , published this `` exclusive affair '' - which jutarnji list , as is their good old custom , pulled out the dustbin and falsely called exclusive - already in the summer of 2014 , with the same accusations of corruption , accomodating the ukrainians and bad refurbishment . 
  ve\u010dernji list also published the story . 
  [ kotromanovi\u0107 then explained ] ( http://obris.org/hrvatska/ako-dorh-utvrdi-da-sam-pogodovao-dat-cu-ostavku-i-ispalit-cu-si-metak-u-glavu/ ) both in front of the national council for tracking the implementation of the anti-corruption strategy , and in a press conference held in mod , that he dismissed several people from mod because of lobbying and pressuring , and that he passed the accusations of croatian general association to state attorney , showing him documents and witnesses according to whom everything was done transparently and lawfully . 
  third , mod declined to receive and sign receipt for any airplane until detailed check-up by caf pilots in ukraine and zagreb . 
  they noticed some defects , and the aircraft were returned to be further worked upon . 
  only after receiving green-light from caf pilots and technicians did mod receive the mig 's . 
  fourth , in december 2014 . 
  [ hdz called for a session of the parliamentary council for defence ] ( http://www.vecernji.hr/hrvatska/remont-mig-ova-u-ukrajini-obavljen-transparentno-i-po-zakonu-978717 ) , citing accusations of bad refurbishment . 
  kotromanovi\u0107 , chief of staff of the croatian armed forces , commander of the caf and test pilots all testified that there were problems with the refurbishment , but that it was still better than romanian job . 
   - the same , identical problems were seen in romania too . 
  i performed 41 flights on six aircraft in ukraine ; it was impossible to do more because of war . 
  the problems are real because the aircraft are old ... as a pilot , i had a lot to complain about both in romania and ukraine , the romanian refurbishment gave me grey hairs , and the problems are not significantly smaller even now - actually , they are smaller for 4.5 million euros , which is the price of this refurbishment . 
  the times are to blame , the engineering , us , them , but it 's the goal that matters , and that it to keep the combat aircraft and air transport protection capabilities - explains brigadier selak . 
  fifth , on july 16 2015 , after croatian complaints and delay caused by war in ukraine , [ mod finally received the last , 12th mig from the ukrainians ] ( http://obris.org/hrvatska/kompletirana-eskadrila-borbenih-zrakoplova-hrz-a/ ) . 
  ukrspetseksport gave a contractual guarantee on 24 months and mod , in accordance with the contract , charged the ukrainians with 3 millions hrk of penalties for delays in the transfer of first 10 aircraft . 
  pilots expressed satisfaction with refurbishment ; they were quoted that they have `` 7 to 9 flight-ready aircraft every day '' and that [ `` all aircraft on aircraft stands are action-ready '' ] ( http://obris.org/hrvatska/nova-eskadrila-ima-aviona-nema-pilota/ ) . 
  mig 's were scrambled twice for interception actions in croatian air space , and they also trained and performed flyovers on the military parade on august 4 , and over knin on august 5 . 
  besides that , they were used every day for pilot training , for training in zemunik air base , for target practice in military drills in slunj etc. 
  sixth , mod , kotromanovi\u0107 , pm milanovi\u0107 , chief of staff brigade general lovri\u0107 , the long-term defence plan , and even president kitarovi\u0107 planned to get to decision of buying new airplanes in 2016 ; that airplane would begin entering service in 2019 , and more significantly in 2021 . 
  ** since the hdz-led patriotic coalition cut the `` communist abomination '' of defence budget for 387 million hrk ( or 8 % ) and announced in forecasts for the next year that the budget will keep dropping even with better growth of gdp , it is obvious that kitarovi\u0107 and patriots decided to disband the caf fighter squadron ** and to impress us with us-made light helicopters . 
  ** what is the role of jutarnji list , that eternal government bulletin ? 
  ** well , just as it was when brki\u0107 needed support ( * `` hero brki\u0107 carried a wounded ... ) or hasanbegovi\u0107 a whitewash ( * `` hasanbegovi\u0107 's maternal grandfather saved a jewish woman from usta\u0161e concentration camp '' * ) or to sling mud at orepi\u0107 for karamarko 's profit ( * `` he hid artillery diaries and deliberately harmed gotovina 's defence in haad '' * ) , ** another exclusive story on the front page and centerfold will do the job ** - kotromanovi\u0107 will get blamed for everything , even if he was the first minister since gojsko \u0160u\u0161ak who actually cared about his department , who cleared up a whole lot of the mess he inherited , [ who saved 141 million hrk on the acquisitions and used them to finance new acquisitions ] ( http://www.jutarnji.hr/dajte-meni-da-cistim-vase-skole-i-bolnice-/1198859/ ) , who finally made croatian navy missile-capable , who organized the biggest number of military drills since 1994 , who stopped the cutting of the defence budget , finally organized the army reserve , reformed the military academy and renovated its finances and organizations , who equipped the army with german self-propelled howitzers , organized a parade , laid down a new coastal patrol craft , sent the navy on a mission outside adriatic ... ? 
  kotromanovi\u0107 is not mother theresa . 
  the guy finished vocational school and got an express diploma in journalism and management in less than a year .
