  they are hunting enemy combatants . 
  it 's not a murder if they 're armed enemy units who shoot back at you . 
  good guy verhofstadt, 
  was n't that the name of the square once upon a time ? 
  [ the sole reason why allies won the ww2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77u1es6nflu ), 
  also the lighthouse of europe . 
  also never the biggest , never the most powerful , but the best, 
  i know that feel . 
  what , you want them to risk hagia sophia becoming a museum again ? 
  preposterous !, 
  beats me . 
  but it does n't matter anyway , because it was linguistically/culturally croatian . 
  this genetic stuff is fun to look at , but ultimately irrelevant . 
   most west part ( istra ) were formaly inhabited mostly by slovenians . 
  not true . 
   and so both sides understood and contented themselves and reached an accord and put their signs on the demarcation , and to the one and the other side the charters were written in latin and ** croatian ** language , while the lords kept copies in german language . 
  mate , you have the worrds like shellfish or jellyfish . 
  whoever invented those had no clue about marine biology . 
  you mean the one where the crusaders paid their ship fare by attacking hungary ? 
  they did n't , they wore normal italian uniforms . 
  partisans called them `` white guard '' because the bolshies in the command whacked off to russian civil war . 
  oh , we 're going to appeal to barthes ? 
  okay , i 'm game . 
  it 's not that the painting represents nationalism . 
  it 's that you , as a watcher , see nationalism in this painting . 
  your post above is not about overbeck , but about dashingrainbow . 
  this is fun !, 
  of course , let 's put aside that barthes said nothing about allegory , which is explicitly meant to convey an author 's extra-textual idea . 
  if partisans were the bad guys , then croatia should do what good guys usta\u0161e did , which is give istria and dalmatia to italy . 
  it has nothing to do with you and everything with neo-usta\u0161as being loud and annoying . 
  direct democracy is amazing in theory and has a nasty potential to be a total shitshow ( kinda like communism , come to think about it . ), 
  i lost faith in it after our mayor ( who got elected on direct democracy platform ) organized a consultation with neighbors about replacing a crossroad with a roundabout . 
  it was awful . 
  participants simply refused to listen to any reason , disregarded any data that was presented to them and just kept screaming about random shit that had nothing to do with the issue ( or the mayor , for that matter ) . 
  i know that there is a certain xkcd comic used to reply to posts like this one , but people are fucking dumb . 
  okay , poles , please explain why the hell is he so unpopular in poland . 
  from the outside it seems this guy does everything right . 
  under him you managed to avoid the economic meltdown , keep up a healthy growth rate , lower unemployment via gastarbeiter work and become a respected country inside the eu . 
  plus he 's as likable as it is possible for a contemporary european politician . 
  so what 's the catch ? 
   there are plenty of successful alternatives examples please . 
  chill out , mate . 
  maybe i just had a crazy teacher . 
  everybody normal called it `` bubamara '' too . 
  i vaguely remember `` bo\u017eja ov\u010dica '' being forced upon us kids in the 90 's . 
  because serbs say `` bubamara '' , therefore it 's absolutely haram to say that . 
  oh yeah , counting blood cells solves everything . 
  my identity , for example , became much clearer to me once i realized half my ancestors were from croatia and half from slovenia . 
  how did i get a slovakian-sounding surname is anyone 's guess , tho . 
   i think given time wounds will heal that 's why it 's high time for another war . 
  otherwise [ such scenes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_unrest_in_bosnia_and_herzegovina ) could start happening again , and in srpska too , and we ca n't allow that , can we ? 
  some politicians might even lose their jobs for god 's sake . 
   last i checked , fbih controls drvar , bosanski petrovac , bosansko grahovo regions in which serbs are over 90 % majority . 
  now that the refugees are back , yes . 
  at the time lines were being drawn that area had a solid bosniak majority ( and was basically uninhabited ) . 
  ofc . 
  not everyone is for drugs . 
  i personally never really had fun on drugs , they either make me bored or annoyed . 
  you 're underestimating them . 
   the croatian area to croatia no thanks . 
   serbs generally want this segregation , why ? 
  third time is a charm ( 2013-ongoing ), 
  yet nd will win the next election anyway . 
  serious question . 
  how come you immediately after havel elected the anti-havel ? 
  what deal ? 
  so how much did they put aside for bribes this time ? 
  i agree . 
  at least as aryan as globocnik . 
  ( or as we say in the balkans : a turkified guy is worse than a turk . ), 
  because this time it could work . 
  we have the dutch on our side . 
  brits love to be invaded by the dutch . 
  well , i know that my great-grandfather got burned alive in our local version of lidice , so i 'm aware of german coin methods ( and i absolutely ca n't understand people who spread that `` civilized nazis '' myth ) . 
  what i wrote was more a potshot to people who hide their islamophobia behind anti-terrorism and advocate methods that are unsettlingly similar to nazi methods . 
  in barnier 's general direction ? 
  and if the worst comes to worst , we can always dust off those old seel\u00f6we plans . 
  total and utter decadence . 
  luckily putin to save the western civilization . 
  make homophobia great again . 
  edit : do i really need to write / s ? 
  of course i do . 
   archaeologists believe that the town was home to some 350 people and dates back to between 4700 and 4200 bc . 
  impressive . 
  hey bulgarians , and how old are those tunnels ^ tm that lead to romania ? 
  and brutish . 
  no negotiating with terrorist , bomb their desert shithole back to stone age o wait they were n't muslims shit disregard post, 
  [ the guy who led the operation ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/horst_b%c3%b6hme_\\ ( ss_officer \\ ) ) went mia during the siege of k\u00f6nigsberg . 
  [ the guy who organized it ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/karl_hermann_frank ) was captured , tried and hanged in prague . 
  [ the guy who ordered it ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/adolf_hitler ) killed himself in a bunker in berlin . 
  why is this downvoted ? 
  what is with those two circonscriptions in the center of france that always vote commie ? 
  any particular reason ? 
  easier said than done . 
  [ sure , here you go ] ( https://m.imgur.com/4swegi1 ), 
  this explains why russians wanted to deport you all . 
  it 's just like ww2 , which usa won alone with other countries providing a bit of backup and moral support . 
  you can even replace usa with ussr and it would still work . 
   in albania , there 's even a branch of islam , the bektashi , that explicitly drink alcohol and eat pork . 
  mystic soldiers ?
