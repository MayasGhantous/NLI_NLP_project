  i take issue only with iq map , and with the source and therefore with the methodology . 
  because that 'd mean the average guy in equatorial guinea is of 8-9 years mental age in adulthood , which frankly i find unbelievable . 
  those maps i can easily find the source for . 
  so what 's the source for your iq maps ? 
  and are you * suuuure * iq tests really measure iq and not , for example , education ? 
   strong , sensible leaders , not nutjobs and crazies . 
  forget it . 
  macron will fail , people already expect too much from him . 
  no matter what he does , he ca n't fix something in five years that 's been seventy years in the making . 
  and once he fails , it 's over . 
   look at the iq data below 70 : mentally retarded so we have almost a whole continent of people where the average guy is mentally retarded . 
  i 'd say there 's something wrong with the map . 
  [ why would he go back from argentina ?

  tea and crumpets . 
  i just looked at that gallery he posted . 
  jesus christ , that 's so schmaltzy it 's actually unhealthy . 
  dude whacks off on aristocracy and gentlemen with stiff upper lips while ignoring that they were an utterly tiny segment of society and that he 'd more likely choke on coal dust in some mine than walk on the strand with a shiny top hat . 
  he 's the kind of guy who 'd call for ban on zola 's novels because it 's degenerate to write about the life of proles . 
  just write 16 kids and get on with it . 
  here 's for future reference : slovenian pm miro cerar has two children , daughter eva and son miha . 
  president borut pahor has one son , luka . 
  remind me again , what 's your opinion on independence of kosovo ? 
  wtf is that supposed to mean ? 
  oh , is that it ? 
  please count the columns in the pics you sent me . 
  i , personally , like my stuff looking clean and square . 
  i furnished my room in the style you hate so much . 
  seriously , dude ? 
  you 're going to refute my point that regular people lived in shitty houses with pictures of a royal bungalow , hotels , churches and high bourgeoisie houses in the town center of a seaside resort ? 
  of course they looked good , but unless you were born in a high class family you 'd never see the inside of one of those . 
  you tell me i do n't understand the culture back then , but it seems you forget how much of a class division used to exist . 
  quite frankly , i do n't find it that beautiful . 
  it 's just a building . 
  every town center is filled with those , and they all look the same . 
   i do n't think you understand culture we used to have in europe . 
  i think you actually do n't understand it . 
  for , like , 90 % of people , [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/kme%c4%8dka_hi%c5%a1a_v_poto%c4%8dah_1951.jpg ) was the maximum fanciness they could afford . 
  while factory owners built those buildings with fancy facades , their workers lived in [ these houses ] ( http://industrijskapespot.si/images/vurnikovo%20naselje%20vir-pokrajinski%20arhiv%20maribor.jpg ) that are just as dull as today 's buildings , and on top of that , roughly the size of a chicken coop . 
  i personally would , but you do n't have to . 
  you can even have a retro building for all i care . 
  but please lay off the fucking columns and apsides , it 's not a church . 
  i live in a commieblock in maribor built in '80s and i 'm so glad to live there for the exact same reason . 
  now , when you think that our first choice when moving to the city was an old art nouveau building in the center that looked very pretty from the outside - but was icy cold inside and the roof was leaking ... 
  oh god i hate those . 
  they just scream `` i have money but no taste . '', 
  yes . 
  do n't ever touch a slovene 's wallet . 
  ( the problem was also that at the time we had 20 % unemployment in maribor , that people were fucking sick of everything , and that 70 % of fines collected would go to the company that installed those cameras . ), 
  the last violent demonstrations here were almost five years ago . 
  i 'd really like to see what the hell were those from economist intelligence unit reporting . 
  unrelated to original topic , but ... whaat ? 
  intensity of internal conflict in slovenia 2/5 ? 
  what internal conflict ? 
   first of all ; they 're more used to violence than western europe just fyi : i do n't even lock the doors of my apartment in the night . 
  it 's * that * dangerous here . 
  this fucking trope invented by a guy who could n't even bother to check if the person his vampire protagonist is based on is really from transyvania . 
  and it just ... wo n't ... die . 
  ( yes , i just linked to tvtropes . 
  your tears only make my shoes shinier . ), 
  i swear there 's some harmful radiation coming from the alps . 
  nah , do n't exaggerate . 
  we even managed to squeeze 250m of planica into the country . 
  my pet conspiracy theory is that he was actually slovenian . 
  think about it : * from monfalcone * wannabe german * did one relevant thing in his life and then sank into obscurity * eventually committed suicide . 
  emm , no . 
  we already had to kick out a common army twice in the last 100 years . 
  i just knew it would be this guy . 
  yeah , you forgot the obvious winner .

  ljubljana castle funicular is four meters longer . 
  nah , better not to give them an excuse to escalate the situation . 
  keep calm and rearm on . 
  nice,

  you were supposed to just throw the ring into fire , not to wear it . 
  [ that 's easy ] ( https://www.playboy.si/media/cache/upload/photo/2008/01/24/pahor-big_i607x500.jpg ), 
  we have ten fingers . 
  better ? 
  okay , if you finally do the reasonable thing and leave everything east of virovitica-karlovac-karlobag line to its fate . 
   article 13 . 
   ( 1 ) everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state . 
   ( 2 ) everyone has the right to leave any country , including his own , and to return to his country . 
  note how the article does n't give the right to * enter * a country . 
  the poor quality of the photo makes it seem like these soldiers have no face . 
  even if you are n't a muslim or a turk ? 
  in that case , do n't mess with women from croatian littoral . 
  an acquaintance was a drinking man who hit his nagging wife once . 
  once . 
  because that same night he woke up to her smashing him with a dough roller . 
  before he managed to wake up properly and recover from hits , she already ran and locked herself in the kitchen . 
  he started kicking the door , yelling that he 's going to break the door and beat the shit out of her . 
  she just said : `` come on , do it . 
  but remember : sooner or later you 'll fall asleep again . '', 
  that was enough to convince him not to ever pull that shit again . 
  does it matter ? 
  i think boroevi\u0107 was a pretty cool guy . 
  he stopped italians and did n't afraid of anything .
