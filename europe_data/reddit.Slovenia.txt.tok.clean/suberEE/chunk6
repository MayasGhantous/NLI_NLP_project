  he committed a hundred sins ( conflict of interest when a rich russian took him to lo\u0161inj on a private jet ) , oversights ( tidying up of the property list , peregrine radar station ) , faults ( complaints about crodux 's fuel ) , stupidities and setups ( to prgomet and most party during the government negotiations ) . 
  he ran some things haphazardly , on the premise that `` everything our allies want to get rid of is good for us '' . 
  he also had a capable team in mod that cleared quite a bit of mess , both legal and financial . 
   at the beginning of my mandate i noticed that 878 million out of a billion hrk were registered as secret funds . 
  today that number is less than 70 million . 
  but that he killed caf , that he damaged it intentionally , that the man who * sent brigadier selak to perform 41 flight in ukraine just to make sure the jets are ready for handover * , that such a man is new sanader - even jutarnji ca n't sell that to croatian people . 
  besides , when jutarnji government brochure writes that this is * the greatest scandal in croatian army * , somehow this gets forgotten : * s-300 missile system , worth half a billion hrk , that was never seen by anybody * general zagorec 's diamonds and hundreds of millions used to buy weapons on illegal market in 90 's , and * final verdict in `` truck '' affair of then-minister of defence berislav ron\u010devi\u0107 ( hdz ) . 
  what we are seeing is the old , tried formula : criminal , * me * ? 
  * you * are criminal . 
  i do n't know what you consider conservative muslims . 
  the fact is that radical left and jihadists share a common enemy , which leads to idiocy like [ this ] ( http://www.secularism.org.uk/news/2014/10/nus-votes-against-motion-on-iraqikurdish-solidarity-citing-islamophobia ) . 
  you dropped an arm . 
  here , have a new one \\ \\, 
  but this time we wo n't let anybody in !, 
  i 'm pretty sure a wave of kurdish refugees are unavoidable . 
  sooner or later , eu will give erdogan freedom to deal with ypg the way he sees fit . 
  isis would be stupid not to seize that opportunity . 
  as kurds say : `` no friends but the mountains '' . 
  a friend of mine recently went to moscow and all he had to say was : `` decisively too many people '' . 
  he 's been to london for a couple times already and never had that complaint . 
  make your own conclusion .

  nothing easier . 
  i wonder if anyone actually uses those letters . 
  ah yes , the one made by a croat , i heard it was excellent . 
  no beck 's for you !, 
  too late , it 's happening . 
  yeah , / u/panonia , where were you in ' 91 ? 
  why do n't you just fuck off right to serbia , if you do n't like the patriotic government ? 
  well , i do have a pretty retarded book that claims whole india is populated by serbs . 
  your former enemies needed you as allies against their former friends . 
  dude , everybody knows that . 
  i 'm also a croat , and the arrival to balkans is even a part of our national mythology ( five brothers and two sisters , `` since 7th century croats breathe here '' and all that jazz ) . 
  everybody also knows that no churches were built on balkans before christ . 
  i 'm sure / u/panonia was making a sarcastic joke about that dick-measuring contest about who was here first , when it 's totally irrelevant now . 
   certainly not true . 
  slavs arrived in se europe in the 6th and 7th centuries . 
  albanian ancestors predate this by millennia . 
  that was the joke . 
  i hope . 
  it was , but it was also the time when youth - especially urban - genuinely started identifying as yugoslavs first . 
  i never met a person who was young in the 80 's that was n't shocked at how things turned out . 
  almost everybody believed that such hate belonged to distant past . 
  why are you still sitting and playing on computer ?

  for reason in revolt now thunders , and at last ends the age of cant !,

  the process for joining the party was basically this : `` hey , you 've been a great student and we see you are making nice progress in your career , so obviously you are a good and responsible citizen . 
  we would really like if you joined the alliance of communists . '', 
  `` umm ... 
  i do n't know , i do n't consider myself mature and aware enough ... '' `` what , do you have any problems with the party politics ? '', 
  answer a : * `` no , of course not ! '', 
  * `` great , consider yourself admitted ! '', 
  answer b : * `` uhm , now that you mention it , there are some policies that i do n't really agree with ... '' * `` that 's cool , that 's just what we need , a fresh perspective . 
  we ca n't follow the times without internal criticism . 
  so , see you at the next meeting , right ? '', 
  ( i know one guy that was at a managerial position in his company without being member of the party . 
  one single guy . ),

  we do n't really care about them , they do n't really care about us .

  to a ceremony in memory of russian prisoners of war in ww1 who died in an accident while building a road in that area . 
  it 's not like we 're making an alliance with them . 
  a friend of mine who studies slavic languages once said macedonian sounds to him like a serb trying to speak bulgarian and failing . 
  observer mission . 
  interesting , thanks, 
  she aggravated it , though . 
  they understood it as an invitation and she did nothing to dispel that myth . 
  was n't it fun . 
   shameful well fuck it , this may well be the point where they abandon all that honor bullshit . 
  and it took them a hundred years . 
  if we consider the size ... 
  you mean , don quijote ? 
   he pronounces the chancellor 's name like the english word `` angel . '', 
  toppest of all keks . 
  oh stop with that cult of personality , spiegel . 
  you 'll make mutti blush . 
  no , and i do n't know anyone that did . 
  maybe it 's different in us , but such things just do n't happen here in slovenia . 
  i mean , here it 's not uncommon for people to be unpaid for months ( happened to my father , he quit and sued , the trial still did n't begin after three years of waiting and statute of limitations will expire in another three years ) . 
  so sorry for being cynical about `` keeping workers happy '' . 
  it is n't , but good luck convincing people to sacrifice their hard-won working rights in the name of competitiveness . 
  can we all just agree that american politics does n't have much in common with european ? 
  no we ca n't . 
  he means devolution . 
  they did n't go far enough . 
  afaik they all still have minimum wage , right ? 
  that needs to go . 
  their retirees still get their pensions from the state ? 
  they should n't . 
  there are safety at work regulations there , right ? 
  all of that must disappear .
