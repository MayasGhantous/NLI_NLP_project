  what do you think about italian communist party back then ? 
  i do n't have enough info , but it seems to me they were not regular communists since they broke with moscow , more close to pre-blair labourists than eastern bloc parties . 
  not to mention it appears they were the only party in italy that was n't massively corrupt . 
  who are these people and why should i care about what they have to say ? 
  if commies are associated with terrorism , less people will vote for communist parties . 
  do n't forget commies were quite close to winning elections in italy in the 70 's .

  yeah , i know what you 're talking about here , and we did study the philosophical aspects because they 've influenced literature . 
  i just could n't understand your first post . 
  also , every word is actually greek . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  no , really , what ? 
  i studied postmodernism as a part of my literary theory course and i absolutely do n't remember any focus on `` describing people '' .

  reputation matters . 
  like rome in 600ad . 
  not really subjugated , they managed to rid themselves of direct ottoman influence in the meantime and oscillated for several decades between ottomans and hungary . 
  for example , ten years before the fall of constantinople they fought on christian side in the crusade of varna . 
  they were only definitely subjugated in 1459 . 
  i imagine it was just a decision of momentary convenience .
