  they 're humans just like everybody else . 
  funny , but the name is actually of the ~ ~ greek ~ ~ byzantine origin , and it has to do with antonina , wife of belisarius , who liked to fuck everything that moved . 
   now this wantonness kept growing worse and worse until it had become an unspeakable scandal , and though people in general , observing what was going on , kept silence about it , yet a certain slave-girl named macedonia , approaching belisarius in syracuse , when he had conquered sicily , and binding her master by the most dread oaths that he would never betray her to her mistress , told him the whole story , adducing as witnesses two lads who were charged with the service of the bedchamber . 
  [ ... ]  and when antonina heard of this , she nourished her anger against him secretly , in order that she might , when occasion offered , display the hatred she bore him . 
  for she had the ways of a scorpion and concealed her wrath in darkness . 
  so not long afterwards , using either magic or beguilement , she persuaded her husband that the accusation of this girl was unsound , and he without delay recalled theodosius and agreed to hand over macedonia and the boys to the woman . 
  and they say that she first cut out all their tongues , and then cut them up bit by bit , threw the pieces into sacks , and then without ado cast them into the sea ... 
  so it first became `` to make a macedonia out of someone '' , then `` to make a macedonia out of fruit '' , and ultimately it became the word for fruit salad .

  it does n't even have to hurt . 
  my parents spanked me rarely , and now that i think about it i never really felt any pain stronger than when you accidentally hit an object while walking . 
  what really hurt was the wounded pride . 
  speech , huh ? 
  how about when a brat curses out his parents in front of people , just to see how far can he push ? 
  do you sit down in front of and tell him that he could have put it nicer and give him an opportunity to answer with `` go fuck yourself '' ? 
  or do you give him a nice moral smack ? 
  i got a smack .

  the us was sympathetic towards preserving yugoslavia , but it did n't care enough to do anything about it - they were busy trying to reset their relations with the ussr . 
  eu was , as usually , divided . 
  germany supported breakup , because of some weird internal political reasons . 
  britain and france supported unity because of nostalgia , but apparently that drive was n't strong enough to compel them to make a move . 
  and ussr , well ... it had much bigger problems at that time . 
  so yeah . 
  international community neither understood what was going on , nor it cared . 
  there 's no chance they 'd step in the first year or three .

  [ this video ] ( http://www.raistoria.rai.it/articoli/la-scarpa-di-kruscev/11034/default.aspx ) seems to be the real deal . 
  as for why yugoslavia fell apart , the cia report from 1990 put it best : because there was no more political will to keep it together , either inside yugoslavia or outside of it . 
  ( people sometimes blame germany because they recognized croatian and slovenian independence `` too quickly '' but let 's face it , independence would happen with or without recognition . ), 
  there was an [ good thread on / r/askhistorians ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/64i9f6/how_did_the_balkans_become_the_region_of_europe/ ) on the similar topic recently . 
  an interesting theme in that thread is that ethnic conflicts and bloodshed are n't anything characteristically balkanic - that they 're , in fact , profoundly western in their attempt to achieve social order and harmony through uniformity . 
  lol , are you seriously trying to say that slobo did n't appoint his own chief of intelligence ? 
  are you trying to say genocidaires became an unit of serbian police without anyone in the state noticing ? 
  lmao  cry all you want bosnian . 
  was he or was he not the head of intelligence service ? 
  who put him into that position ? 
  who kept him there even when it became clear he 's arming paramilitaries ? 
  who let those same paramilitaries cross into serbia and become part of police ? 
  your fucking president , that 's who . 
   but people did know in the 80s that communist party in yugoslavia would implode . 
  which is why like a quarter of population worked elsewhere , outside of the country .

  in mussolini era and immediately after ww2 italian movie industry had crappy noisy cameras and shitty mics , so it was easier to film the movies as if they were silent and then to dub the voices and sound effects . 
  since they soon started working with international casts and the dubbing industry became really skilled , they continued doing it even when it was no longer necessary . 
  some directors , like fellini and pasolini , even used it for artistic effect .
