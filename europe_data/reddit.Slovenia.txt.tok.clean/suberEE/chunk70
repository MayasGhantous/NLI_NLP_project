  you can try . 
  if you 've got something to offer you 'll be accepted . 
  ( try finding at least some kind of job first , that makes it all much easier . ), 
  would i be welcome there ? 
  or will i be an outcast ? 
  are people generally welcoming ? 
  that 's something that did get worse since the human flood . 
  the panic - justified or not , it does n't matter - did n't calm down yet and it 'll take time for things to get back to some kind of normal . 
  but if you do your job and take efforts to socialize with locals and fit in , you 'll be mostly accepted . 
  there 'll always be some people who 'll hate you for what you are , though . 
  and fitting in is not easy . 
  is europe `` closed '' ? 
  ( i 've heard that from several people ) 4 . 
  are there any countries accepting immigrants ? 
  it 's closing for illegal immigration . 
  legal immigration is working as usual . 
  could be . 
  it 's just that compared to pretty much all south slavic languages ( except macedonian ) you pronounce everything really slowly . 
  skilled and charismatic actor , and that 's to be respected . 
  total dumbass otherwise . 
  other south slavic languages sound russian to you ? 
  czech strikes me as slower and more sing-songy . 
  same here , and when it stopped working they switched to \u017deljko debeljko who eats kids . 
  bonus scare because there was an actual guy called \u017deljko who visited us sometimes . 
  that book is also popular in croatia . 
  i remember it from when i was a kid , she was so cute \uff08 \u03a6\u03c9\u03a6 \uff09, 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's spread all over balkans , since it 's very generic , originating from `` grandma '' . 
  everyone has two grandmas . 
   what about kau\u010di\u010d ? 
  that name is actually quite funny , it sounds like `` small couch '' . 
  it exists , but it 's very rare . 
  i 'm pretty sure that all surnames i mentioned that are rare are of slovenian origin . 
   babi\u010d sounds more croatian . 
  ] ( http://www.mladina.si/93287/izvori-priimkov/ )  how common are - \u0161ek and - nik lastnames ? 
  not common . 
  you can be almost positive that someone with - \u0161ek or - nik does have someone from slovenia in his ancestry . 
  on the other hand , i think - nik surnames are also present in ukraine . 
  best . 
  cake . 
  ever . 
  the thing is , they 're basically the cake nazis . 
  rude and overworked staff , guests ' comfort is the last priority . 
  but i forgive them everything and always go back because of that fucking cake . 
   we maybe share a few with croatia . 
  went and [ checked ] ( http://forebears.io/croatia#surnames ) . 
  i took the top 10 slovenian surnames on - i\u010d and checked their frequency in croatia , and i found this : kova\u010di\u0107 ( 6th most common ) zupan\u010di\u0107 ( very rare ) bo\u017ei\u0107 ( common ) kav\u010di\u0107 ( very rare ) klemen\u010di\u0107 ( rare ) petri\u0107 ( common ) pavli\u0107 ( somewhat common ) ur\u0161i\u0107 ( very rare ) toma\u017ei\u0107 ( very rare ; toma\u0161i\u0107 is quite common ) babi\u0107 ( 5th most common ), 
  to see if there 's anything unusual with it .

  do you need a nice landscape to have a good shit ? 
   they have n't discovered toll booths in slovenia yet !, 
  we used to have them , but we discovered a better way to take italians ' money . 
  yeah , he was literally tearing apart his own bus seat to annoy me . 
  you can guess what a mild-mannered and intellectual person he was . 
  the epilogue of that story makes me fiendishly happy . 
  he got into a fight on new year 's eve and ended up with some light injuries . 
  he went to the police , who told him they ca n't do anything until he gets a medical certificate for his wounds . 
  he waited for three weeks , the idiot . 
  all his wounds and bruises healed in the meantime . 
  and guess who was the doctor he eventually went to ? 
  my mom . 
  who keeps a photo of me on her work desk . 
  so after she told him she ca n't give him any certificate because no injuries are present anymore , she proceeded to ask him : `` also , why are you messing with my son ? 
  do you think that 's funny ? '', 
  according to her , he was bright red , squirming on his chair and muttering something about it `` only being a joke '' . 
  delicious . 
  he never spoke to me again . 
  i do n't remember exactly , maybe she was even from prekmurje . 
  but my comment was tongue-in-cheek . 
  the girl in question was kinda alternative/artsy/weirdo , so , as usual , it was down to what kind of person she was and not her nationality . 
  i 'm pretty sure that this stereotype , which is pretty prevalent in ex-yugoslavian countries , has much to do with hungary being economically more advanced and less religious than most of balkans , plus actual emancipation of women came earlier . 
  you 're not the only one with that stereotype : swedish , german , czech and slovenian women are all stereotypically considered horny/slutty . 
  notice the pattern ? 
   definitely not true . 
  unless you mean prostitutes , who are paid to pretend to be horny , so idk if that counts truth be told , the admittedly limited interactions with hungarian women that i had did n't do much to dispel the myth . 
  for example , my then-girlfriend had a hungarian friend , whose first thing to ask her when she found out we 're a couple was : `` so are you guys into threesomes ? '', 
  goulash , paprika , csardas , gypsies and horny women . 
  yes . 
  as an immigrant from `` the south '' i had my run-ins with xenophobes . 
  examples of what pissed me off the most : * a guy was tearing chunks off his bus seat and throwing them at me , while telling me `` why do n't you just fuck off back where you came from ? '', 
  * my girlfriend 's dad searching through her stuff and refhaing me to stay over with her for a weekend , because `` croats are thieves '' . 
  * kurc the gleda * = the dick is looking at you !, 
  [ explanation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtboxvjdrrk ), 
  well ... we have none . 
  yes , i know someone who 's been questioned . 
  they call by phone , ask for age and education and then ask who would you vote for and how would you rate certain politicians . 
  the problem is that always about 30-40 % answer `` do n't know '' or `` no one '' . 
  if those picked someone the results would look much different . 
  i actually fear the next election . 
  we just managed to get out of the economic slump , for the first time since i came here there seems to be genuine optimism about the future , and who leads in the polls ? 
  because people here are fucking stupid apparently and ca n't let king of betajnova remain without his throne . 
  i 'm not sure if you 're just trying to deter him from immigrating , but i 'm a first generation immigrant and i 'm doing just fine . 
  podga\u0107e - under panties, 
  and were happy about it . 
   ritoznoj : ass-sweat to top it off , they produce wine there, 
  okay , britain did n't , switzerland did n't , netherlands did n't , but the rest pretty much all did . 
  being a benevolent absolute ruler was all the rage back then . 
  yeah, 
  oh poor you , and we 're the route for any , khm , tourist going to italy from the east . 
  sr\u010dek - little heart ljubi ( m ) / ljubica ( f ) - loved one mucek ( m ) / mucka ( f ) - kitten mi\u0161ek ( m ) / mi\u0161ka ( f ) - little mouse piki ( m ) / pikica ( f ) - no friggin ' idea , i guess it 's supposed to be a cute word for dot ( i feel a bit nauseous now . ), 
  you did make some actual mistakes .
