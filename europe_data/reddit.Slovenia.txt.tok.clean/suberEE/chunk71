  * to mean * is * zna\u010diti * ; * upu\u0107ivati * means * to instruct * , * to give directions * , * to send ( a letter ) * . 
  another big mistake is `` ako znao bih '' . 
  the position of enclitics in serbo-croatian is a very complex issue and i 'm not sure if i can explain it properly , but [ here ] ( http://maryati.tripod.com/myhome/croatia/wordorder.htm ) you have a solid introduction . 
  if you have access to jstor , [ here 's another good article ] ( https://www.jstor.org/stable/24599873?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents ) . 
  and last , * in english * is always * na engleskom * . 
  ( this is actually a common mistake for slovenian speakers , since in slovenian it 's said * v angle\u0161\u010dini * ) . 
  the rest , like word order , is somewhat awkward but not strictly wrong . 
  hey , no worries , i 'm a native speaker of croatian and i have no idea how accents are supposed to work properly . 
  ( my area has only the stress accent , and it 's under heavy influence of italian language ) . 
  yup . 
  a year or so ago there was a scandal when it turned out that forest administration somewhere in notranjska employed bosnians , took away their passports , kept them in inhumane living quarters and did n't pay them for their work . 
  and that was n't the first time something like that happened . 
  vegrad , while it still existed , also did similar shit . 
  thank you !, 
  i do n't need to ask what did they go through , suffice to say that my dad witnessed an elderly german tourist have a complete breakdown at the mention of word stalingrad . 
  did you study ww2 tactics in your officer training ? 
  and do you think there are any lessons to be drawn from german coin tactics/strategy in ww2 ? 
  yes . 
  apart from nepotism and cronyism , we have a big problem with regulatory agencies colluding with entities they 're suppised to regulate ( for example , safety inspectors announcing their visits , tax offices turning a blind eye to factory bosses not paying their workers ' social/health contributions etc. ) . 
  in worst cases it even went so far that companies ( state owned at that ) used slave labour without anyone doing anythibg before the press got whiff of it . 
  where did your relatives serve in ww2 ? 
  you can also say in which unit if you know and are comfortable with sharing , 
  yes , in fact that 's how i got slovenian citizenship . 
  we called it * zabajon * , from a similar italian cream ( although , according to wiki , italians also put wine in it . 
  we did n't do that . ), 
  absolute rule by a hereditary king i guess . 
  like almost every country in europe in 18th century and saudi arabia today . 
  `` pa\u010d '' in slovenian , used the exact same way . 
  we actually do , we produce whole 5 barrels a day . 
  do n't worry . 
  you 've worked long and hard to become a superpower drama queen state . 
  unfortunately , yes . 
  especially among the older generation there 's still the idea that mentally ill people are either pretending or should be put away from `` normal '' people . 
  it 's getting better , though , the younger generation seem to get it 's just an illness like any other . 
  the peace . 
  hardly ever anything really important or dramatic happens here ( and when it does , it 's about natural disasters ) . 
  we have criminally low crime rate and we 're too small and unimportant to catch the eye of anyone powerful . 
  it 's very cozy once you think about it . 
  yeah , similar here . 
  it 's more about the generation gap than simply him being goofy . 
  well , the adolescent department in ljubljana that i was in was the most liberal out of them , so it 's probably due to that . 
  there is also a clinic in \u010crni vrh where they keep , among others , the criminally insane , so they 're , naturally , very strict . 
  do you have a link to that thread ? 
  my doctor was a veteran of psychiatry , very experienced . 
  he always knew exactly when i needed comfort and when i needed to have my bullshit cut . 
  nurses were a bit more of a mixed bag , but they were all very helpful and understanding . 
  we were suposed to talk to them if we had any problems ( doctors were quite overworked so we were n't supposed to bother them too much outside of therapy sessions ) . 
  and they genuinely liked working there , which was visible in their attitude towards us . 
  the worst was our social worker . 
  not only she looked like nurse ratched , but she was also ice cold and not too bright . 
  she had a session a week of `` social skill training '' , which was a total waste of time . 
  actually , quite a lot of different therapy sessions were a waste of time . 
  what really helped was being treated like a human , not like a freak or victim , and being surrounded with other people with issues who understood what i was going through . 
  i was actually pretty lucky that the staff there was so good while i was in ( they had quite big turnover , i think none of the docs that were there back then works there anymore ) . 
  i was in one for six months and it was cool . 
  as for details , i could write a novel about it ( in fact , i probably will ) , so just ask what interests you . 
  yes , lots of them , since there was a war in the 90 's in these areas . 
  experiences vary . 
  i met the full spectrum , from people who were genuinely glad to have saved their own skin and tried their best to start a new normal life , to entitled assholes who bullied locals and used their refugee status as leverage to get special perks . 
  it 's hard to say what the best experiences were , since we did n't even think of okay people as refugees , we pretty much accepted them as our own . 
  the worst was probably my teacher in the 1st grade . 
  she was n't even supposed to be my teacher , but she blackmailed the school into hiring her as a refugee from vukovar . 
  then she tried to have a model class of 20 pupils who were all exactly the same , learned the same material with the same speed and where nobody stuck out , because she was still fruatrated from teaching in the refugee camp . 
  of course , it did n't work that way ( i , for one , could already read and write ) , so she bullied mercilessly everyone who did n't fit the average . 
  nobody could complain , because that was croatia in '97 and vukovarians were untouchable back then . 
  neo-nazis and antifa : one face , one race, 
  slovenia , never one to be upstaged , put a barbed wire too . 
  refugee crisis , because suddenly there is a barbed wire between me and my grandma . 
  also , there is ( or rather was ) [ new idria , california ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_idria,_california ) , named so because it was a quicksilver mine town like the original idrija . 
  which is , coincidentally , the same thing we say when someone sneezes . 
  [ \u041d\u0443 , \u0437\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443\u043c ] ( https://youtu.be/g6r9pjhhu4m ), 
  cool , we like new arrivals !, 
  you know where to find us , we 're just east of czechia, 
  ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046504/?mode=desktop&amp;ref_=m_ft_dsk ) sorry for linking such an old movie , but slovenian movir industry simply is n't very good . 
  there is no conspiracy , there 's just power . 
  powerful countries get away with things . 
  did anything happen to the us for invading iraq ? 
  did anything happen to china for occupying south china sea ? 
  without invasion somebody else could 've bought that oil . 
  china , or russia , or france for example . 
  ( but iraq would n't have sold it . 
  they 'd be stupid to do that . 
  look at saudi arabia , all of saudi oil is the property of saudi aramco . ), 
  truth be told , did america start any war since 2003 ? 
  primary school : 7 years italian , 5 years english secondary school : english and german , plus i took russian as an optional subject . 
  that was in 2011-13 . 
  in 2008-2011 , pm was pahor . 
  tax loopholes and looser labour laws , i reckon . 
  i guess it 's not in riyadh . 
  you mean , [ parkelj ] ( https://radioprvi.rtvslo.si/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/p11.jpg ) ? 
  figurati . 
  how patronizing . 
  do n't worry , we know foreign things and people . 
  in fact we were at times on the verge of extinction because of those . 
  let 's not forget that we were always surrounded by larger and more powerful countries that often tried to assimilate us . 
  most of our history was a struggle to preserve our identity . 
  now that we are on our own we 'd like to left alone for a while . 
  tens of kilometers ? 
  i 'm afraid not ( otherwise we 'd be empty ) , but you can find places that are 5-6 km away from the next building in the alps and dinarides . 
  that one 's on the swiss .
