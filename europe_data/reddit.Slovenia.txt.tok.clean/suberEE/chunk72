  it 's not completely wrong , but croatia is very diverse and the kajkavian area is culturally very close to slovenia . 
  ja , ja , none taken . 
  in the name of the faculty of arts of ljubljana and the whole country , i sincerely apologize . 
  we have integrated science classes ? 
  i heard they fuck men . 
  yes there is , but it 's highly flawed , especially in civil law . 
  courts are impossibly slow and many civil cases remain unsolved when the statute of limitations expire . 
  there is a lot of collusion between labour and safety inspections and businesses they 're supposed to be inspecting . 
  seems nobody is making sure that the businesses are paying mandatory pension and health plans for their employees , so if they stop paying it you 're fucked , nobody even gives you a notice that the payments are overdue . 
  such stuff . 
  the situation does n't seem to be improving , but at least it 's not deteriorating . 
  do they still air 2001 space odyssey every new year night ? 
  definitely [ slovenija ] ( https://youtu.be/wzo3vy-qhjy ) by buldo\u017eer . 
  a while ago our foreign minister , karl erjavec , was quite a meme . 
  he grew up in belgium and apparently learned slovenian as a second language ; consequently his r sounds somewhat like h. also , he was a member of every government since 2004 , both in left-wing and right-wing coalitions , and he comes off quite clownish . 
  so the internet rechristened him kahel ehjavec ( kahla means potty ) and photoshopped his goofiest faces onto all kinds of movie posters with r 's swapped with h 's . 
  you can just google `` kahel ehjavec '' for the whole gallery , but here are some fine examples : [ 1 ] ( http://www.joker.si/mn3njalnik_oldy/uploads//monthly_10_2008/post-3687-1224743859.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.rtvslo.si/_up/photos/2008/09/15/u-60189_hambo_show.jpg ) [ 3 ] ( http://i31.servimg.com/u/f31/11/71/34/93/pathio10.jpg ), 
  i 'm not completely sure . 
  some years ago a bunch of brits bought houses in prekmurje . 
  the general reaction was pretty much `` senpai noticed me ! '', 
  in total they 're quite less disliked than bosnians . 
  there are more serbs in slovenia with higher education , and there is a fair share of serbophiles . 
  uncivilized peasants from backwards shithole who are destroying our culture and taking our jerbs . 
  you know , standard xenophobic spiel . 
  and since they 're the most numerous , they take the largest share of hate , to the point that `` bosanc '' is synonymous with `` dirty immigrant '' . 
   there'a no need for reformation . 
  the people wanted complete independence from austria-hungary and that 's it . 
  not really . 
  even in 1917 trialism was seen as preferable to breakup . 
  ( [ may declaration ] ( https://sr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9c%d0%b0%d1%98%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b0_%d0%b4%d0%b5%d0%ba%d0%bb%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%86%d0%b8%d1%98%d0%b0 ) )  bosnia of course . 
  not to mention herzegovina . 
  oh my god . 
  just no . 
  i did n't change my opinion on poland . 
  i do think , on the other hand , that their government is absolute crap . 
  i think i know a millionary ( do n't know for sure , have n't seen his tax report ) . 
  he got rich by being manager of a quite large meat company . 
  the problem is he killed the wrong person . 
  franz ferdinand was a famous slavophile and he had some good plans of reforming austria-hungary to satisfy the slavic demands and turn it into a modern country . 
   austria-hungary wrongfully annexed a part of serbia that has been previously under a 400 year long torture by the ottomans which part ? 
  most liked : british most disliked : albanians or bosnians ( immigrants ) , gypsies ( minority ) best integrated : probably croats worst integrated : gypsies, 
  well i put sugar into water , bring it to boil , remove from heat , add coffee , mix it up , put back on heat until foam starts forming , remove it , put back again for a bit more foam , remove it again and then it 's ready to drink . 
  so i guess it 's exactly half way between czech and bosnian turkish . 
  our nobles were mostly german , so the majority of them left slovenia for germany after 1918 ( when slovenia joined yugoslavia and when nobility was abolished ) . 
  the very few that remained are just normal citizens . 
  that is the case for basically every standard language . 
  our standard language is , for example , * based * on lower carniolan dialect , but it 's enough to hear one sentence from some lower carniolan person to notice they are n't speaking standard . 
  yes , of course they can . 
  look at the swedish . 
  that reminds me of certain vegan acquantances of mine . 
  no coffee , no cigarettes , no alcohol , but smoking weed in massive amounts is apparently completely ok . 
  if i 'm having a coffee outside : latte in the morning , macchiato in the afternoon , espresso in the evening . 
  i drink them while sitting outside in a caf\u00e9 , relaxing and chain-smoking . 
  at home it 's turkish coffee with a bit of milk . 
  i think i 'm a fairly typical coffee drinker for slovenia . 
   we learned from last time . 
  this alone disqualifies you from joining the balkan brotherhood , sorry . 
  as a consolation prize , you are always welcome to leave some of your monies in istria ( we have truffles !, 
  upper carniola - stingy . 
  and mean . 
  and do n't have feminine gender in their speech . 
  lower carniola - church-going cryptofascists , they drink [ some horrible concoction that 's supposed to be wine but really is n't ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cvi%c4%8dek ) . 
  and gypsies . 
  inner carniola - they exist ? 
  styria - styrian ikebana : when you come out of the pub with a wide array of various knives stuck in your back . 
  and drunk . 
  prekmurje - gulyas , d\u00f6d\u00f6li , gibanica , gypsies and unintelligible dialect . 
  but what if you go full benito again ? 
  there 's still a bit of organic waste in foibe from the last time . 
  different people , different fetishes . 
  did you even read my post ? 
  nevermind , here it is again , expanded and translated :  it was n't an issue of croatia wanting to leave but what they would have taken with them and what they would have done with serb citizens \u0160to bi u\u010dinili sa srpskim gra\u0111anima ? 
  no idea . 
  i do n't know if they would catch on either , one of the main reasons for biking is staying fit . 
   would have done with serb citizens compared to what happened because they rebelled , nothing . 
  those two that i know of seem to be doing fine , but they do run a risk of being mistaken for gypsies . 
  depends where . 
  a lot in flat cities like ljubljana , much less in cities on hills . 
  you can get tap water in slovenian restaurants without problems and for free . 
  it 's just impolite to order tap water only . 
  slovenj gradec is the only place there that 's somewhat livable . 
  drava or me\u017eica valley are what i 'm talking about . 
  and i 'd rather not live somewhere on pohorje or kozjak , considering they actually get cut off from the world when it snows . 
  sure , you can buy pizza-burek anywhere . 
  in 15 years that i lived in slovenia there 's been only one chase that i remember . 
  anyway , since we have a ridiculously low crime rate , no media expects anything happening so they 're never there to cover it live . 
   there 's way more than just a valley there . 
  true . 
  there 's another valley . 
  you want my take ? 
  i live in a country whose whole population is smaller than brooklyn 's . 
  its length by latitude is 248 km . 
  you can easily drive through the whole country in four hours . 
  in this small country , you have a region that 's been under heavy italian influence , another one that 's been a part of hungary for most of its history , and the region in the middle that 's been divided into two regions . 
  people are actually very different in each one of those regions . 
  they speak dialects which are almost mutually unintelligible , they eat different food , different music is popular in each of those regions and their cities are laid out in a manner so different that by looking at them you 'd never say they 're in the same country . 
  they have different concepts of time and punctuality and they have different ideas about quality of life . 
  that 's diversity . 
  what 's understood as `` diversity '' in those polls and articles is not diversity at all . 
  they think of it as a state of affairs where all manners of different people with different cultures live mixed up one with another , where no culture is dominant .
