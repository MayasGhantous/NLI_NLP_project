  all the other patients were appalled . 
  that actually happened in a place near ljubljana . 
  anyway , thanks . 
  most people are bros , but those who are n't are super annoying . 
  if we do n't count the larger part of my family in croatia , i have relatives in france . 
  croat in slovenia . 
  that we 're thieves . 
  it 's not just in the media . 
  the father of my ex actually went through her wallet because `` he 's a croat , they steal '' .

  yes . 
  the main street in ljubljana is called slovenian street , and quite a lot of towns have a slovenian street or slovenian square . 
   zagreb has three streets named after the city itself , zagreb avenue ( ex ljubljana avenue ) , zagreb street and zagreb road ... 
  this , on the other hand , is unheard of . 
  usually the streets named after towns are the streets that lead to that town ( vienna street leads towards vienna , trieste street towards trieste and so on ) . 
  yes , but not as much as you . 
  fiction takes up most of my reading time , 
   2 ) in former yugoslavia , is the way you talk defined by your ethnicity or your country ? 
  for example : do bosnian croats talk like croats in croatia ( ethnicity ) or like their bosniak neighbours ( country ) ? 
  by geographical area , but dialects do n't even follow borders . 
  [ map ] ( http://www-gewi.uni-graz.at/gralis-alt/2.slawistikarium/bks/dijalekti_brabec-hraste-zivkovic.jpg ) , sorry for eventual headache . 
  edit : [ a more readable map ] ( https://forum.unilang.org/viewtopic.php?t=44652 ) for \u0160tokavian dialects . 
  without \u010d and \u0161 it would look swedish . 
  it 's not to be laughed at .

  do you cook it before use ? 
  my parents insisted it must be cooked , despite the tag `` cooking not needed '' on the bag . 
  that is , back when you could still buy bagged milk , i have n't seen it in years . 
  you still have milkbags ? 
  or in italian . 
  well , they are supposed to be dumb . 
  i liked it . 
  better than almost anything by sir walter scott . 
  and of all that we spent the most time on fucking madame bovary . 
  or to keep it simple : france pre\u0161eren and the baptism on the savica . 
  2-5 customary kisses . 
  yeah , as far as i understand it , it 's a question of geology . 
  for example , you live in a fluvial area where everything turns into mud when it rains . 
  i lived in the karst area , where the rock substratum is porous , which means all the rain immediately leaks down into ground . 
  it 's never really muddy where i 'm from , so the doormats do n't suffer that much . 
  well , the doormat is not there just to look pretty . 
  some houses have slippers for guests , but not all , and keeping shoes on is preferred to walking around in socks . 
  i know i was weirded out as a kid when my mates who moved from the continental part took shoes off before entering our flat . 
  yes . 
   austria was n't really in the colony game * khm * bosnia * khm *, 
  for the first 23 years , the next 52 years congo was a normal colony . 
  well , it 's not really `` my '' culture since i 'm from the coast and people who do that are from inland , but taking off shoes while entering my apartment even if i do n't have slippers to offer . 
  i 'd rather clean my floor after you leave than smell your fermented feet . 
  unless you 're from istria/littoral . 
  then you can be unexpectedly visited by family members , friends and neighbours . 
  hey , ours is a drinking song too . 
  it 's even written in the shape of a wine glass , and the original text has seven stanzas , which is about the amount of glasses you can pour out a wine bottle . 
  oh , doubtlessly , there 's no shortage of arrogant asses here . 
  but dickhead tourists and dickhead immigrants are not exactly the same thing . 
  true story : a local woman from an italian family came back to the town after few years of working in trieste . 
  of course , in the meantime she became super urban and totally italian , so she demonstrated her fanciness to her relatives and neighbors by standing on the porch and stepping on a rake so that they were bouncing up and down , while smugly repeating `` ma che cos ' \u00e8 questo ? '', 
  then she stepped a bit too hard , smashed herself in the nose and shouted `` au , jebemti grablje ! '', 
  quite frankly , arrogant in the same way as croats/bosnians/serbs / montenegrins who come to slovenia and refuse to learn the language because `` everybody understands them anyway '' . 
  what i think about them ? 
  that their citizenship should be revoked , that 's what . 
   ca n't we just call it shtokavian languages and everybody goes home happy ? 
  you know what ? 
  i 'd actually support that . 
  because spoken \u010cakavian , especially of the [ istrian ] ( https://vimeo.com/43207355 ) and [ island ] ( https://youtu.be/rishxrvnyeq ) varieties , are often unintelligible to a \u0160tokavian speaker . 
  same goes for [ kajkavian ] ( https://youtu.be/-vb8ql2ntcw ) . 
  it 's ridiculous to claim those are just dialects of croatian language , while serbian standard is supposed to be a completely different language although it 's 99 % intelligible . 
  ( on the other side , fuck me if [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/xt6yas64xb4 ) is the same language as they speak in belgrade . ), 
  i have nothing against calling the standards by their countries ' names , by the way . 
  but the most honest name for the macrolanguage would be \u0160tokavian . 
  perfect drink when you get home after a cold and wet winter day . 
  go on ... 
  it 's cool , that 's how i got slovenian citizenship so it would be hypocritical from me not to support it . 
  i do n't feel any emotional connection to the eu . 
  i support it for purely pragmatic reasons : it has more pluses than minuses , it gives this continent its last chance to be independent , and it gave us phone calls from other eu countries without roaming fees . 
  it is pointless to talk about communism before zimmerwald conference , since that was roughly where the split happened ; before that only a rather amorphous workers ' rights movement existed , which usually called itself `` social democrat '' and which was pretty irrelevant everywhere except in germany , sweden and finland . 
  ever since then socialists were the moderate left , communists were the extreme left , and anarchism tanked into obscurity . 
  except in spain , but you know ... spain . 
   when he discovered that his lover jagodja had an affair with his man-servant mabruk , he had both of them sentenced for theft and treason and hanged by a drumhead court-martial and their home villages destroyed . 
  this peters guy seems nice . 
  and we 'll never be roooyals ( roooyals ) , it do n't run in our blood , that kind of lux just ai n't for us , we crave a different kind of buzz . 
  do n't you know you should n't drink foreshot moonshine ? 
  italy has no minimum wage laws . 
  you forgot max von sydow . 
   if you look at slovene actors in slovenia , we have no acting talent whatsoever . 
  radko poli\u010d does n't count ? 
  yup . 
  istrian italians speak venetian and i grew up surrounded by them , so i picked it up . 
  it has its own iso 639-3 code , so i guess it 's now officially a separate language . 
  and yes , it 's quite distant from other dialects , and it 's actually closer to slovenian standard than croatian . 
  although there is another croatian dialect , \u010cakavian , which is distant enough from standard croatian and has its own literary tradition , so i guess it will be recognized as a language too sooner or later . 
  somewhere around zero .
