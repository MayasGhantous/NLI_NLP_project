  my town used to have one of the larger ghettoes in this area in the middle ages , but all the jews were expelled in 1497 . 
  also , lower styria was annexed by germany in ww2 , and you know what that meant for any jew that was still here by then . 
  how does rejecting a war declaration work ? 
  `` lalala , i do n't hear you , you 're not at war with me , lalala ! '', 
  well , it was both , was n't it ? 
  since there was no formal slovenian government , the only reason for collaboration was anti-communism , so at least bela garda had killing fellow slovenes as main reason for existence . 
  it has to do with my pen name . 
  croatian , serbian , bosnian , montenegrin ( we in the western balkans are all born polyglots ) , slovenian , kajkavian , macedonian , italian , venetian , english , russian . 
  ( funnily enough , i have no trouble understanding macedonian but i understand at best 50 % of spoken bulgarian ) . 
   and probably istro-romanian , never heard it [ time to fix that ] ( https://youtu.be/g272i5t55zs ), 
  i know , i used to live amongst them . 
  they 're way more common than it seems from tromostovje . 
  instead of writing an essay , i 'll just link to the most slovenian video in existence . 
  nsfl [ part 1 ] ( https://youtu.be/naoypa-8uim ) [ part 2 ] ( https://youtu.be/k-oyppxykoa ), 
  exact same shit . 
  they still talk how slovenia is the only country atill in transition and about old commie networks of power and udba and so on . 
  they 're like a broken record . 
  ww2 in slovenia was more a civil war than anything else . 
  most of the fighting was between partisans ( communist resistance army ) and `` bela garda '' ( generic name for various anti-communist , collaborationist formations ) . 
  it 's still a touchy subject here . 
  it took me a while to realize the difference between croatian `` poginuti '' and slovenian `` poginiti '' . 
  `` poginuti '' in croatian means to be killed in a battle or accident . 
  `` poginiti '' in slovenian is used when an animal dies . 
  ( now imagine when i started telling people that my grandma has `` poginila '' . ), 
  4 km , 20 min by bus, 
  breakfast after waking up , depends on when work starts . 
  usually around 7 . 
  it usually consists of bread with meat paste , or porridge , or scrambled eggs . 
  it 's not very big . 
  morning snack ( malica ) is around 11 or 12 , eaten at work . 
  a lot of people bring a sandwich or yogurt with them , others go to the nearest fast food . 
  lunch is the biggest meal , usually warm . 
  it comes immediately after work , around 15 or 16 . 
  dinner around 20 . 
  most often it 's leftovers from lunch . 
  fast food is rather big , burek and yogurt is at this point a staple in slovenian food . 
  there 's quite a lot of kebab and mcd 's around , but i do n't think they can compare with amount of burek eaten . 
  i guess most people go to restaurant once a month or so . 
  after four beers only love remains . 
  i definitely would . 
  kreisky was the jew-hating jew , was n't he ? 
  current leader : ** miro cerar ** , pm since 2014 . 
  i credit him for not impeding the economic recovery . 
  that guy basically does nothing , whatever issue arises he takes his sweet time to think , and by the time he reaches any decision the issue has passed . 
  in rare cases he decides swiftly , it 's the wrong decision , but that 's par for the course for slovenian leaders . 
  for starters , he considers orban a role model , and there are some similarities between them . 
  jan\u0161a esentially lives off his reputation as the person who kick-started the 1989 revolution and led the slovenian army in the war 1991 . 
  but he also massively enriched himself by smuggling weapons , created a deep state while dm and broke the constitution when his military intelligence service arrested and planted evidence on a police agent who investigated his machinations . 
  he only avoided jail by obstructing the court process so long that statute of limitations expired . 
  once he became pm , he governed by formenting divisions in slovenian society , rousing xenophobia and taking loans everywhere , which made the eventual recession that much worse . 
  in the meantime , he made a corrupt arms deal with patria which brought him to court again . 
  while the trial lasted he became pm again and it took violent protests to remove him . 
  he was eventually condemned to two years of jail , which he managed to avoid by getting elected to parliament . 
  all in all , he 's the face of corruption in slovenia . 
  at the moment his party leads in the polls . 
  god help us all . 
  best leader : i would n't say we 've had any exceptionally good leaders since independence , i 'd say the best of the lot is ** janez drnov\u0161ek ** , pm 1992-2002 and president 2002-07 . 
  he was a moderating influence throughout all his career , and his tactic of broad coalitions led to some surprisingly stable governments and era of economic progress . 
  i 'd say the strategy of his cabinet of not allowing wild privatization and keeping the economy under state control was the right choice , and slovenia entering nato and eu so quickly goes to his credit . 
  i also liked his humble image of the first citizen , without pomp or extravagance . 
  that 's not to say he 's without fault - he sometimes pushed some ill-advised laws for political points ( such as student labour law ) and he was rightly criticized for taking alternative therapy on state expenses once he found out he has cancer . 
  but all in all , i 'd say slovenian reputation of an ordered and relatively wealthy country is his work . 
  i know almost nothing about both those places except that lebanese women can be seriously good looking . 
  i do n't speak french , and i do n't know enough about how life in france looks like ( except for paris , which is about the last place on earth i 'd move to ) . 
  impossible . 
  for starters , every holy roman emperor had to come to his crowning with an army . 
  then , normans , arabs , byzantines in the south ... 
  did you have any peasant revolts ? 
  we spiced our life here with them from time to time . 
  visegrad four - poland , czechia , slovakia and hungary, 
  austro-hungarian era , from 1867 to 1914 . 
  47 long years of economic growth , stability and harmless bickering between clericals and liberals . 
  lol, 
  not slovenia either . 
  the whole resettlement idea is , quite frankly , stupid . 
  refugees did n't go on that trip to end up in poland , they want germany or sweden . 
  so even if v4 accepts the refugees , they 're going to take the first opportunity to escape . 
  it 's already happening in , for example , estonia . 
  in this situation where could force v4 , by sanctions , to accept the refugees , but once they escape the only things that will remain are ruined intra-eu relations and a big pile of wasted money . 
  so i 'm on their side . 
  quotas are the wrong solution . 
  trump is nsfw by default . 
  hercegovina is the southern part of b&h , although its northern border is not really clear . 
  [ map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:herzegovina_location_map_simple.svg ) it was a different administrative unit in ottoman empire and there are some cultural differences between bosnians and herzegovinians . 
  well , my mom followed her on facebook and was spamming me with her stuff for months , so i kinda developed an allergy to her  . 
  but otherwise it would probably be her too , yeah . 
  [ the melania * ] ( http://s1.freebeacon.com/up/2015/12/trump99.jpg ), 
  i 'm not really crushing on any celebrity , especially local . 
  i 'm just a hard guy to impress . 
  but apart from that ... fuck it ... as much as i dislike her and her life choices and her husband , i got ta admit the melania looks good . 
  the rare ennobled slovenes used `` pl . 
  '' , as shorthand for `` plemeniti '' ( noble ) . 
  it was used the same way as `` von '' in german . 
  taxes . 
  i 'll answer for croatia since i was n't in slovenia yet back then : * [ e.t. 
  - tek je dvanaest sati ] ( https://youtu.be/eckzv7ch88a ) * [ dino dvornik - afrika ] ( https://youtu.be/hmnmzpbajbg ) * [ ilan kabiljo - kad nema ljubavi ] ( https://youtu.be/u_eoy-drfi4 ) * [ nina badri\u0107 & emilija koki\u0107 - ja sam vlak ] ( https://youtu.be/kvhaeaxxefq ) * [ i bee - \u0160umica ] ( https://youtu.be/oezvrlbnvgg ), 
  sure , but i like to think that i 'd try to make an alliance with at least some neighbors so that i have my back covered . 
  considering how paranoid you are about security of your country , i do n't think it 's working . 
   yea do n't make assumptions based on reddit talk or street talk . 
  take a look at interviews and initiatives .
