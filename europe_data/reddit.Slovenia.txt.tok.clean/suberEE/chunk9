  by [ referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatian_constitutional_referendum,_2013 ) , what 's more . 
  [ i know , i just tried to make it sound even worse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ass ) . 
  what is a thread be without this ? 
  i had to google it to find out that you were eating ass . 
  how many are slavic ? 
  yup . 
  slovenian industry lives on bosnians . 
  perfect employees . 
  they do n't show up drunk , they put in effort , they are [ cheap ] ( http://www.delo.si/ozadja/migrantski-delavci-v-sloveniji-zivljenje-na-robu.html ) and if they start complaining you can always [ expel them ] ( http://www.zurnal24.si/delavce-izgnali-iz-drzave-clanek-83056 ) . 
  somewhere between 5-10 % in the whole country . 
  but it varies a lot depending on the town . 
  for example , jesenice and velenje have the most bosnians . 
  there 's much less of them in eastern slovenia . 
  yeah . 
  it would be a reasonable assumption  . 
  there are also probably some slovenes who did n't answer for some reason ( `` i am a citizen of the world '' , or plain old mistrust towards buraucracy ) , but i doubt they 're that numerous . 
  the thing is , slovenia has seen a lot of immigration ever since the 60 's and it picked up * a lot * in the 2000 's . 
  one of the things that i noticed and that did n't end up in census is that there 's a massive number of macedonians here now . 
  for a while i 've been studying in ljubljana with a girl from a smaller macedonian town , and working in maribor with a guy from the same town . 
  it 's that big . 
  edit : another thing that could swell up that number is `` yugoslavs '' , those that entered a mixed marriage in slovenia and their kids . 
  there was n't really a war here , so such people did n't have to pick a nationality and could afford to say `` fuck you '' to all that ethnic bullshit . 
  what goods come out of gaza strip ? 
  there is not much of a market for diy missiles . 
  they were and still are surrounded by enemy countries that twice insidiously invaded them ( and a third invasion was only prevented by israel attacking first ) . 
  some of them even harbor militant groups that claim the fight will last until israel is no more , which is something people who went through an extermination attempt within living memory take very seriously . 
  the one concession israel made backfired horribly , and gaza strip is now run by hamas who does nothing but extort its inhabitants and provoke israel into bombing them . 
  after almost 70 years of such bullshit , can you really blame them for doing their thing and not giving a fuck what their enemies think ? 
  it 's not a nice thing to do , people indeed suffer because of it . 
  but at this point it 's completely understandible that israelis are looking for self , palestinians be damned . 
  the pupils of this junior high are quite funny . 
  she used to be cuter . 
  it was `` register census '' which means that the census workers did n't go door to door . 
  instead they used data from official register . 
  now , when i was getting my id they did ask me my nationality and religion for statistical purposes , but i could decline giving answers . 
  now i do n't know if not enough people answered or if it was for some other reason , but they did n't publish data about ethnic and religious structure of population . 
  2002 is the most recent year for which we have such data . 
   could well , yeah . 
  at that time there was quite a lot of official xenophobia here . 
  people were anxious . 
  i do n't know about bosnians , but about 30 % of inhabitants have some version of serbo-croatian as their mother language , according to the census of 2002 , the last one that collected that type of data . 
  that 's pretty much the only real , official measure of how many people were from the south at that point , since they did n't collect any data about ethnic identity on municipality level ( except for the official minorities - italians , hungarians and roma . ), 
  7 % claimed their native language is bosniak . 
  on the other hand , some 7 % of population was born in b&h ( that , of course , does n't include those that identify as bosnians , but were born in slovenia ) . 
  coincidentally , some 7 % of inhabitants were also muslim ( which does n't account for bosnian croats and serbs ) . 
  you can check the data [ here ] ( https://www.stat.si/popis2002/si/rezultati_obcine_prebivalstvo_dz.htm ) . 
  til . 
  i know a girl from kyrgyzstan that studies in a larger siberian city . 
  of course , she goes to her uni and back by bus . 
  once i told her it seems to me an awfully long ride , and she answered : `` it 's just three days , it 's not that bad . '', 
  nuff said . 
  an old guy dies . 
  on the last judgment they decide he was just in the middle between good and evil , so he would he allowed to choose between heaven and hell . 
  so first he decides to take a look at heaven . 
  it 's quite empty , everybody is in white , walking around , singing praises to god . 
  ` quite frankly , it seems boring ' , thinks the guy . 
  then he goes to see hell , and to his surprise , he finds out there is a huge party . 
  disco music is blaring , people are dancing around , beer is being poured in amazing quantities . 
  incredulous , the guy asks the first devil that passes by : `` how come you have it so good ? 
  i was told all the time hell is horrible . '', 
  `` oh , it used to be horrible , '' answers the devil . 
  `` but then a fat guy without his left leg arrived , took a couple of loans and we 've been living large ever since . '', 
  ( explanation : tito was quite fat , and before his death his left leg got amputated . 
  it was always quite known that yugoslavian economic success was owed to tito taking loans everywhere . ), 
  *** ( d\u017eemal bijedi\u0107 , pm of yugoslavia 1971-77 , died in a plane crash . 
  he was a bosniak , who are steretypically seen as rather dull . ), 
  what were the last words recorded by black box in bijedi\u0107 's airplane ? 
  ( in thick bosnian accent ) `` let me drive a bit now . '', 
  once upon a time there were two brothers . 
  when the war came , each one of them joins a different army : the older one joined the fascist usta\u0161as , the younger one joined tito 's partisans . 
  many years later the brothers meet again . 
  the older one comes to the meeting in a designer suit , driving bmw , with a golden watch on his wrist . 
  the younger one comes on foot , dressed in an old jacket , unshaven and destitute . 
  `` what happened ? 
  '' , the older one asked . 
  `` ah , immediately after the war everything started going bad . 
  everytime i tried to get a job , or ask for a credit , they 'd run a background check , find out that my brother was an usta\u0161a , and reject me . 
  how about you ? 
  i see you got yourself quite well-set . '', 
  `` oh yes , i always got everything i needed . 
  everytime i was looking for a job or asking for promotion i mentioned my brother was a partisan . '', 
  damn , one of the better yugo communist jokes is in the same vein , also untranslatable . 
  why did tito never bring de gaulle to yugoslavia ? 
  because the acclamations would be * tito i de gaulle ! * . 
  ( which sounds the same as * tito ide gol * = tito goes around naked . ), 
  ooh , one from when milka planinc was pm : why did they cover the beograd-zagreb highway with corn ? 
  so that the goose can find her way back home . 
  this is [ stane dolanc ] ( http://images3.kurir.rs/slika-724x489/stane-dolanc-1374159922-341081.jpg ) , yugoslav ( secret ) police boss and tito 's left leg during his last couple of years . 
  anyway , one day his personal cook finds a turtle in his garden . 
  he catches it thinking : `` this will make a perfect soup for comrade dolanc . '', 
  he brings it into the kitchen , pulls out a knife and attempts to sever its head , but it turns out to be almost impossible : the turtle , being scared , never pulls out its head far enough , and each time the cook swings his knife , the turtle pulls its head back into its shell . 
  dolanc 's adjutant sees the cook struggling . 
  `` leave it to me '' , he says , taking the knife into his right hand . 
  then , all of a sudden , he stinks his finger into the turtle 's butt , turtle springs its head out of the shell , and he quickly cuts off its head . 
  `` that 's amazing '' , says the cook , genuinely impressed . 
  `` but how did you learn this trick ? '', 
  `` what do you think , how do i tie dolanc 's necktie every morning ? '', 
  i heard this one in croatia in the 90 's : president of the republic of croatia , supreme commander dr. franjo tu\u0111man is walking around zagreb , of course with a police escort . 
  he notices poverty everywhere , unemployed people gathering in front of job agencies and poor pensioners rummaging through trash to find something edible . 
  deeply touched , he starts crying : `` oh , it 's so sad to see all these poor people struggling for existence .
