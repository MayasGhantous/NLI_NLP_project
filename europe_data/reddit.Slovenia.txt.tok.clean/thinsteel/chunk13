  flair up !, 
  i 'm a simple man . 
  i see a kitten , i upvote . 
  it was in the same fridge in that ( really small ) supermarket . 
  i once bought fake cheese accidentally . 
  was n't too pleased about it . 
   milk is a generic term for all kinds of white beverages no , actually , it is n't . 
  from wikipedia :  milk is a pale liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals . 
  this sounds like a pretty good definition to me and i 'm sure most people would agree with me about that . 
   then we 'd have to forbid margarine too ] only if it was marketed as `` sunflower butter '' . 
  yeah , you guys think you have your own letter for that , when in truth , you are just misusing \u03b2 . 
  you can look at it from the evolutionary perspective . 
  instead of reproducing , unproductive members of society remove themselves from the gene pool , creating a lithuanian master race in the long run . 
  i may be missing something , but the guy in the photo is aleksandar vu\u010di\u0107 , the current president of serbia . 
  he 's corrupt and seems to be very disliked by serbian redditors . 
  i guess one of them enjoyed making a post that calls him a lower life form . 
  people like me ? 
  how would you know anything about my views ? 
  but anyways , making up some ridiculous beliefs and attributing them to people you do n't agree with so that you can dismiss them as stupid , hysterical illiterates does sound very comfortable indeed . 
  seems like a useful technique for the intellectually lazy . 
  that 's the joke . 
  i hope it makes you feel good about yourself , being that much smarter than that stupid and illiterate `` average redditor '' that only exists in your head . 
  they wo n't really be waters anyway . 
   we 're also not on a fault line ... it 's all safe on that front too but what 's to stop foreign powers from creating a fake earthquake ? 
  from this image , i can easily infer that the author opposes glorious pis . 
  then please explain to me how the free market will take care of millions of people who do n't have any marketable skills and do n't even know the language . 
  and why you think those people wo n't turn to crime if they are allowed to lived in europe but do n't have any legal way to support themselves here . 
  this has nothing to do with race . 
  you sound like you want honduras tier crime rates . 
  you are correct , of course . 
  alexander the great was a macedonian , not a greek . 
  [ i 'd rather not .

  we can , you know , stop * our * societies from turning into societies where such things happen . 
   quake . 
  yeah , right . 
  wake up , sheeple !, 
  do you seriously think that the heating radiator , the telegraph and the periodic table of the elements were invented in soviet times ? 
  that is like , your opinion , man . 
  to be fair , julius caesarescu was a great romanian leader . 
  according to that page the `` controlled '' page gap is only 2.4 % . 
  he does make a really good joke from time to time , but most of the time his show is just worthless political propaganda . 
  because defending free speech is somehow altright . 
  sounds like a nice guy . 
  yes . 
   but even if you raise the salary , younger people wo n't be willing to move to a smaller place i really doubt that . 
  javascript , but with a syntax error on the second line . 
   my mum was present , so it was above board or maybe your mum was in on it . 
   you shouldnt call her a pig i agree . 
  she looks more like a horse . 
  apparently he ones tweeted this  i believe that homeo-meds works for some ppl and that it compliments ` convential ' meds . 
  they both come from organic matter ... now i suspect he 's retarded . 
  she does n't react at all . 
  it 's like they 've made an effort to make it as unintuitive as possible . 
  dentristry is n't needed as often if you do n't spend your days eating deep-fried mars bars . 
  just typical british teeth . 
  also parents who ca n't control their children . 
  remove . 
  well they could n't use \u00e4 because that is n't even a real letter and they did n't use sch because come on , really ? 
  three letters for a single sound ? 
  sounds like an exciting profession . 
   165 mt abbreviating meter that way is just atrocious . 
  alcohol lowers your inhibitions , it does n't just make you do random stuff . 
  if someone does something like that , no matter how drunk that person is , you can be sure there is something wrong with them . 
  it means they enjoy making other people suffer , even though they may control themselves and not do it ( at least in a way where they can easily get caught ) when sober . 
  yeah , i never claimed that terrorism is a likely cause of death or that it is rational to fear it . 
  i just wanted to point out that / u/slusny _ cizinec made a ridiculous argument . 
   they do n't shit in the street wait , are you saying my stereotypes about british tourists are wrong ? 
  well if you do n't take drugs ( ones that can cause death ) , then you are much more likely to die in a terrorist attack than from a drug overdose . 
  too soon ? 
  ca n't tell if sarcastic . 
  ah , so that is the freedom that our american brothers keep talking about . 
   also interlinked economies would strongly avoid wars they did n't the last time . 
   were caught bribing the judge stop lying please . 
  the polls consistently show that large percentages of muslims in the uk have extremely illiberal views . 
  for example , in [ this poll ] ( http://www.populus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/download_pdf-131206-policy-exchange-poll-of-muslims-living-apart-together.pdf ) : * 86 % said that that their religion is the most important thing in their lives . 
  * 57 % disagreed ( 40 % strongly disagreed ) with the statement `` one of the benefits of modern society is the freedom to criticise other people 's religious or political views , even when it causes offence '' . 
  * 28 % agree with the statement `` if i could choose , i would prefer to live in britain under sharia law rather than british law '' * 51 % personally agree with interpretation of sharia that says that a muslim woman may not marry a non-muslim . 
  * 43 % personally agree with interpretation of sharia that says that a muslim woman can not marry without the consent of her guardian . 
  * 31 % personally agree with intepretation of sharia that says that muslim conversion to another religion is forbidden and punishable by death . 
  * 61 % personally agreee with intepretation of sharia that says that homosexuality is wrong and should be illegal . 
  * 53 % would prefer that muslim women choose to wear the veil . 
  the part about them thinking our society is corrupt and immoral is something i assume based on their illiberal views , strong adherence to islam and what i know about islamic beliefs . 
  i also got that impressions when listening to numerous muslims talk in various debates and interviews . 
  but i do n't have any hard data on this , so it is really just my opinion . 
  about muslims sympathizing with terrorism , poll results vary widely and depend on how the question is asked , but polls often show higher support for terrorism than one would hope . 
  for example , in the poll i linked to above , 7 % agreed with the statement `` i admire organisations like al qaeda that are prepared to fight against the west '' . 
  in [ this poll ] ( http://pewresearch.org/files/old-assets/pdf/muslim-americans.pdf#page=97 ) , 15 % of british muslims said that `` suicide bombing of civilian targets to defend islam '' can sometimes be justified . 
  9 % said that it can rarely be justified . 
  the local muslim man is likely to have extremely conservative , illiberal views that are incompatible with our values and he is likely to think that our society is corrupt and immoral for not adhering to his views . 
  a significant percentage of local muslim men also sympathize with these attacks . 
   that are radicalized by fringe elements of their religion for starters , we could recognize that those elements of their religion are not so fringe . 
  there always were and always will be people who are not deterred by punishment . 
  the law ca n't work 100 % . 
  the countries that have this happen to them are usually the countries with large , poorly integrated muslim minorities . 
  the main reason why the uk has such a minority is that pakistan was their colony . 
   if you 've got a source on corbyn saying that , i 'd be much interested in reading it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgj1phewifq, 
   i drink 4-5 glasses/cans a day  but everything has changed of course it has , you 've become an alcoholic . 
   trieste , italy ** triggered **, 
  it looks really unremarkable .
