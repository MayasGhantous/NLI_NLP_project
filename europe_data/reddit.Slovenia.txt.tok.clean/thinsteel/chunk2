  so a kind of brainwashing campaign ? 
   to learn some basic skills on which you can improve if a time comes , when you will be needed, 
   on a table [ like this ?

  if he is n't leading you , then you obviously are n't a part of the free world . 
  could be gay pair adoption . 
  god i hate beer snobbery . 
   most famous of which probably is a. hitler not only him , but a significant percentage of german wwi soldiers . 
  militarism was widespread in german society after the war and there were huge paramilitary organization like the stahlhelm . 
  yes , because talking about helping the kids on reddit will be much more helpful than merely assigning blame . 
   sure lots of young men and women die in a terrible fashion and civilians get bombed it 's only natural that noobs get pwned . 
  a few armenians went for a walk in the desert and got lost , hardly a genocide . 
  needs more jews . 
   is sterilized at age 16 so not euthanized at birth ? 
  why would you let the parasites feast on the nations body ? 
   we do n't really have the climate to make these you do n't have the climate to grow tomatoes either . 
  has n't stopped you from growing wattery tomatoes and selling them all over europe . 
  well , it has a positive view of cats so there 's that . 
  nothing compared to the salt in england if they vote to leave . 
   your picture looks a lot better it looks okay on its own , but it really clashes with that building on its left . 
  generally the higher the density of people , the more they live each other alone . 
  it would be more convenient for many users if you deleted that . m from the url . 
  you mean [ like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfjvbxnmsnk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=98 ) ? 
  i 've heard that used in slovenian too ( dav\u010dna oaza ) . 
  edit : slovenian wikipedia calls it that , so i guess that 's the proper word to use in slovenian language . 
   even though some linguists still reject a genetic relationship , most scholars accept that baltic and slavic languages experienced a period of common development . 
  beekes ( 1995:22 ) , for example , states expressly that '' [ t ] he baltic and slavic languages were originally one language and so form one group '' . 
  [ 8 ] gray and atkinson 's ( 2003 ) application of language-tree divergence analysis supports a genetic relationship between the baltic and slavic languages , dating the split of the family to about 1400 bce . 
  that this was found using a very different methodology than other studies lends some credence to the links between the two . 
  [ 9 ] it always amuses me when people make linguistic claims just because they feel they are better than their neighbors and thus could not possibly be related to them in any way . 
  it annoys me to no end that journalists in slovenia routinely use the phrase `` dav\u010dna nebesa '' ( meaning literally tax heaven ) instead of the proper translation `` dav\u010dno zato\u010di\u0161\u010de '' , thus introducing a phrase that makes no fucking sense into our language . 
  english was also taught in schools in yugoslavia , just not as much as now . 
  there may have been regional differences , but i know for a fact that both my parents had english in school . 
  [ i 'll just leave this here . ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balto-slavic_languages#common_grammatical_innovations . ), 
  actually , they can not into existence . 
  along with slovenia , croatia , albania , moldova , belarus , the uk and ireland . 
  i seriously doubt that 50 % of turks or russians are proficient in english . 
  this has as much to do with population size as it does with gdp per capita . 
  for example , there is plenty of countries whose gdp per capita is lower than slovenia 's , but they also have a much larger population . 
  it 's called a tax * haven * , not a tax * heaven * and definitely not a tax paradise . 
  i do n't know what 's the true color of the river in this photo , but rivers [ can have that color ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=so%c4%8da&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjtg6rf8ddsahugoxqkhdw_aceq_auibygc&amp;biw=1268&amp;bih=632 ) . 
   denk is a far left populist movement  they are openly in support of erdogan that does n't seem like a leftist position, 
  and it does so using [ human quantum energy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radovan_karad%c5%bei%c4%87#fugitive ) . 
  but is n't that rightful french clay anyway ? 
  it is pronounceable to a slavic speaker , but it looks like someone bumped his head against the keyboard when written down . 
  but anyway this was just the last straw . 
  germans confirmed barbarian hordes . 
   jij that 's it . 
  i refuse to believe this is a real language . 
  or he could say that in order to piss the polish off , like the rest of us do . 
  he was just making a joke , man . 
  based on my stereotypes about iceland , i assume it 's because most of the island is a god forsaken uninhabited mountainous wasteland with no decent roads . 
  so having flights from one end of the island to the other might be cheaper than building roads or railway between them . 
  albanians are famous for their [ blood feuds ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gjakmarrja ) . 
   this includes owning property and germany is a country where renting is much more common compared to owning your house as long as owners of those houses are private citizens and are not foreigners , that does n't change the average wealth . 
  what are you talking about ( forgive me for living under a rock ) . 
  i doubt it 's cheaper relative to average salary . 
   admittedly rather biased sounding http://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/vasternorrland/valdtog-12-arig-flicka-2 use google translate , it does a relatively decent job on this page . 
   everyone who can play ~ ~ football ~ ~ water polo goes south ftfy, 
  she is among the large group of women i would fuck , but not among the much smaller group of women i would masturbate over . 
  ^ shamelessly ^ stolen ^ from ^ taboo, 
  united kingdon of england and wales when ? 
   do n't underestimate yourself you do n't know she 's underestimating herself , you have n't seen her . 
  you are invalidating my slavic experience .

   the shape of the head is so unique that it is . 
   and beautiful looking i think your sense of aesthetics might be broken . 
   bear dog is it in any way related to manbearpig ? 
   if you caught a 12 yo toddler if i saw a 12 years old toddler , i 'd blame mother nature . 
  this dog looks like he 's wearing makeup . 
  [ karst shepherd ] ( http://www.petpaw.com.au/breeds/karst-shepherd/ ), 
  the smug face on the dog in that photo tho . 
  yeah , no one except you would say germany is eastern europe . 
  but be my guest , use words based on how things `` seem '' to you instead of their widely accepted meaning . 
  just do n't be surprised when you have trouble communicating with people . 
  also , is [ the uk ] ( http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_alcohol_report/profiles/gbr.pdf?ua=1 ) western enough for you ? 
  it 's actually because of those countries ' neutrality . 
  which is also why they are n't in nato . 
  but that looks like it 's trying to push the opposite agenda , if any . 
  rounding error ? 
  there is no rounding error . 
  this are the exact results of a vote , not a poll that attempted to measure public opinion . 
  the name means new town ( could also be city , since we have the same word for both ) . 
  but the word mesto can also mean place . 
  [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zwthnevsay ) is more scenic . 
  not really . 
  if they used the same color scheme for both then distinctions between the countries would be less visible . 
  partly . 
  they are also generally more risk taking and more prone to alcoholism . 
  at the same time it means that men will spend a substantial portion of that time being dead . 
  look at lithuania . 
  the trick is being on strike all the time . 
  way less stressful than working . 
  you actually keep track of every second ? 
  this statistics is about exercising at least 2 hours a week , so that would be six 20 minute jogs a week , so one almost every day . 
  and jogging for 20 minutes is way more effective than walking for an hour ( unless you walk very fast , which most people do n't ) . 
   mostly due to those ridiculous gloves which are designed to maximise knockouts that is n't true for amateur boxing , though . 
  and way more people compete in amateur boxing than professional . 
  being out in the city , walking , is n't really exercise comparable to something like running . 
  well sweden did n't really need to be included .
