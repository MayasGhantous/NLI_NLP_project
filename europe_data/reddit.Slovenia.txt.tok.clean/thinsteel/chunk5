  how drunk are the people in this video ? 
  also cold and dark . 
   ukraine is n't in the eu though until 2004 , neither was poland . 
  slovenia ( a former yugoslav state ) actually had a much better economy than poland in the early 90s . 
   those little runts i 've read that as `` those little cunts '' at first, 
   who i 've heard described as `` literally trump , just more moderate and with a left cloak '' so , literally like trump , just completely different ? 
  why are you assuming it was really just the cream ? 
  why is your minister of national defense personally engaging in combat ? 
  this comment deserves to be higher . 
  i agree , that bullshit is incomplete . 
  you are actually people with greek ethnic origin who have adopted a turkic language and an arabic culture . 
  did you mean `` resistance is futile '' ? 
  or am i missing your point ? 
  \\  trying to annoy your team mates in cs : go you know this makes you a bit of a cunt , right ? 
   what would be the argument for slovenia being western europe ? 
  i am not claiming that it is part of western europe , it clearly is n't . 
  i was saying that it is only part of eastern europe if you divide europe strictly into western and eastern . 
  when people do that , it is usually along the cold war borders which is n't really as relevant as it used to be . 
  even if you want do that , you have a problem with yugoslavia , since it was n't aligned to any side ( it was not a part of the warsaw pact , but was a part of the non-aligned movement ) . 
  since the cold war is over and europe changes culturally from south to north as much as it does from west to east , the cold war division is n't the best way to define european regions . 
  it is more useful to divide europe into northern , western , central , eastern , southern and southeastern , like [ this ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:europe_subregion_map_world_factbook.svg ) . 
  in this division , slovenia is usually placed into central europe . 
  i guess you could find some arguments for calling it southeastern europe ( i.e. 
  the balkans ) , but not eastern europe . 
  only if you define eastern europe as `` not western europe '' . 
  the music in this video is the [ alpine folk music ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volksmusik ) , though . 
   stand too close to you on the train and live with their mothers are you sure sure you are n't confusing us with southern europeans ? 
  do you guys also get annoyed by bad australia jokes ? 
  what about cellar jokes ? 
  or pointing out that mozart was actually german ? 
  of course it 's sweet ( i 'm not advocating putting pineapples on a pizza , btw ) . 
  this . 
   and often better that really depends on the quality of the tomatoes your are using . 
  a [ shit-rectangle ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bpxf5tv.png ) . 
   the suggestion that arabs = turks is a good one it really is . 
  i 've ones written ( on another account ) something like `` are n't you guys basically arabs ? '' . 
  had two turks replying me with walls of text in no time . 
  they could also buy an [ already made sauce ] ( https://www.amazon.co.uk/barilla-tomato-sauce-basil-400g-x/dp/b004bfjjzc ) . 
  aww , we love you . 
  this must be the best response to this copy pasta i 've seen so far . 
  he is clearly being sarcastic . 
  while you , on the other hand , are a paragon of tolerance and would n't ever form stereotypes about an entire nation . 
  we are not annoyed by someone saying our country is small , we are just annoyed by croats constantly repeating the same old jokes over and over again . 
  u wot m8 ? 
  do they ? 
  i thought everyone just finds it funny . 
  nah , we are just happy that they acknowledge our existence . 
  slovenian nation is a huge attention whore . 
  it may just be a map from some alternative reality . 
  there is still czechoslovakia on it and yugoslavia , but the latter is missing vojvodina which appears to have gained independence . 
  also , hungary is split in half for some reason . 
   but he claimed that it was the official insigina of the croatian armed forces he actually claimed that it was `` official symbol of the ** unit ** in croatian army '' , not croatian army as a whole . 
  so that would appear to be a blatant lie on your part . 
  that they are really serbs , just pretending really hard not to be . 
  incidentally , we are not actually annoyed by being called mountain serbs , because we know we are not serbs and just find it silly . 
  macedonians in this thread are saying that they are not offended by being called serbs either , which makes sense , because they are not serbs . 
  what really annoys them is being called bulgarians , because they are some kind of bulgarians . 
  what is their problem with breaking spaghetti ? 
  it 's the sensible thing to do . 
  or the british . 
  i would guess not , but you probably can pay his sister to provide sexual services . 
  that would be much more effective than mountain serbs . 
  can confirm the one for poland . 
  very effective when i want to trigger poles on reddit . 
  do you seriously believe that the person who has created the logo did n't realize the resemblance to the ss logo ? 
  he was actually half croat and half slovenian . 
  according to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslav_partisans#composition ) , the serbs were the largest ethnic group amongst the yugoslav partisans and the croats were the second largest , but none of those groups was over 50 % . 
  yugoslav partisans were of all yugoslav nationalities . 
  none of the nationalities accounted for over 50 % of partisans . 
  the serbs and the croats were the two largest ethnic groups , but they are also the most populous of the yugoslav nations . 
  thank you . 
  do you hate snowden or something ? 
  graham who ? 
   just call them what they prefer ... and move on well , when talking to them in person i probably would call them what they want , out of pure self interest . 
  frankly , i do n't have the energy to deal with any hissy fits they might throw if someone addressed them the wrong way . 
  but i am not sure this is the right thing to do . 
   out of respect well the thing is , if someone insists i call them something like `` two spirit '' or `` gender gifted '' , that makes me respect them less . 
  and by demanding i call them something ridiculous like that they put me in an awkward situation and thus show the lack of respect for me . 
  it 's similar to how i would think about a fanatically religious person . 
  as long as they keep their faith private , it 's none of my business , but if they demand that other people modify their behavior or their language to conform to their beliefs , than that 's a problem . 
  i do n't think someone demanding to be called `` two spirit '' is any better than demanding to be called something like `` the chosen one '' . 
   yes , they indeed force you to at minimum address the person in his prefered gender since nyc recognizes 31 different genders . 
  i find it quite bizarre that you can be fined for not pretending someone 's delusion is true . 
  this is n't a bridge , it 's just a road that goes along the side of a hill . 
  do you live somewhere where there are no hills or something ? 
  i bet the [ mayor of kiev ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vitali_klitschko ) would beat both of them though . 
  you should listen to [ this ] ( http://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-48-prophets-of-doom/ ) . 
  calling the anabaptist cult in m\u00fcnster freaky is a real understatement . 
  that would fit right in with the [ history of m\u00fcnster ] ( http://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-48-prophets-of-doom/ ) . 
  which of the things he has done so far were anti-democratic ? 
  some of his executive orders seem insane to me , but i do n't see how they are anti-democratic . 
   why do n't you guys rebel any kill trump anyway ? 
  because trump is n't acting in an anti-democratic way and likely wo n't be in power in 10 years . 
   guys at r/de and r/the _ schulz can be quite funny and talented while creating memes so , do they never post here ? 
  cause i 've seen plenty of schulz/mega memes here , but none of them were funny . 
  but marion , on the other hand , is a an attractive young female . 
  that increases here meme factor by 300 % . 
   i am that weird , schuldigung i bet you are also subscribed to / r/ketchuphate , you sick bastard . 
   i mean , we could n't give less of a fuck about you guys it 's rather curious that you comment in / r/europe then . 
  so it does n't actually take any energy ( if you ignore friction etc ) to move a boat from one level to another .
