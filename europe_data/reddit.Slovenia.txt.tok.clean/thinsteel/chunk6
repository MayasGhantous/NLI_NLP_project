  very unintuitive , but true . 
   actually having ~ ~ shit thrown at him ~ ~ his corruption exposed ftfy, 
  the removal process may take a few centuries , though . 
  well if he does n't understand your bulgarian then it clearly is broken . 
  i do n't see a problem here . 
  but not all yugoslav languages are serbobosnomonteatian i hercegovian . 
  does n't matter , the referendum would be held in switzerland anyway . 
  no one is interested in what the people of liechtenstein think . 
  iirc bulgarians also do that , at least in [ this series ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1909015/ ) . 
   `` austrias greatest achievement is making the world believe hitler was german and mozart was austrian . '', 
  i 've hard another version of that , with beethoven instead of mozart . 
  and all caps do n't help either . 
  you 're wrong . 
  ukraine is weak . 
  it 's feeble . 
  also the 4th reich, 
  yes , i 've ninja edited it . 
  and man , did you respond quickly . 
  according to [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5qvw33/new_french_presidential_poll_le_pen_25_fillon_22/dd2m71y/ ) she is actually less likely to win in the second round if she runs against macron than if she runs against fillon . 
  now you 're pushing it . 
  the stuff about shellfish and pork is just an arbitrary dietary requirement , while homosexuality is an abomination before god . 
  there is a difference . 
  meh , he has nothing on steve ballmer . 
  you can just go to google maps , zoom into some random place , click `` what 's here ? '', 
  and then get the full address [ here ] ( http://www.addressesandpostcodes.co.uk/address/25zzjj8j/flat-4-74-dartmouth-road-london-nw2-4ha.html ) . 
  takes about a minute and the addresses will not tend to be from one place . 
   key eu figures have already stated that the aim is to punish the uk source please . 
  but why would she enjoy meeting mass murderers ? 
  does it make her royal twat wet or something ? 
  can we stop this shit already ? 
  the sub is just absolutely filled with some random bullshit lately . 
  and one of their bad teeth may break of and stay stuck in your flesh , causing a sepsis . 
   sex-shy austrian until he gets into his basement , that is . 
  the quotes in this article made me loose some of the respect for amnesty international . 
  i agree that the prison systems in europe are better than that in the us , but you know as well as i do that there are other factors that cause the very high murder rates in the us . 
   i hope it 'll be your father/mother/brother / friend that gets killed i agreed with your previous comment , but wishing a death of a close family member on someone because he disagrees with you is really excessive . 
  you would actually find several of those in slovenian , if you included the dialects and the archaic words : denar , novec , para , penez , gro\u0161 . 
  also one that is not mentioned in the map , but is used in italy according to [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5qczk3/the_origins_of_the_word_money_in_various_european/dcyazjx/ ) : sold . 
  or montenegrins . 
  but they 'd probably be too lazy to act on it anyway . 
  at least we do n't steal clay from all of our neighbors . 
  [ yes . 
  ] ( https://www.kulinarika.net/recepti/3098/mesne-jedi/ljubljanski-zrezek-po-domace/ ) it 's basically cordon bleu . 
  some of the women in your photo are manly as hell . 
  cats are cute even when they kill . 
  oh , you mean `` ljubljanski zrezek '' . 
  also rivers ( rafting etc ) . 
  cevapcici are not a slovenian dish , although we do eat them often . 
  wtf is a lubianska ? 
  why not ? 
  if your seniors are anything like ours , they will optimize their purchases so that the price will always be rounded down !, 
  well that 's just a very large pile of rocks , of course it 's gon na last . 
  an odd comment in a thread about nazism . 
  there were at least two crucial circumstances that allowed the nazis to get in power and that are missing now : - there was a huge number of people extremely committed to the far right political ideas and eager to use violence . 
  violent clashes between the communists and the right wingers were common ever since wwi . 
  in 1932 , the sa numbered 400000 men and would have been able to start a civil war . 
  - the establishment at the time ( the industrialists and the army ) was sympathetic to the nazis since they viewed them as preferable to the communists . 
  it looks nice . 
  does the humidity cause any problems ? 
  the fuck happened here ? 
  i am not claiming that the banks will move to frankfurt or any other city . 
  i do n't have enough knowledge about the workings of london 's financial industry to have an opinion either way . 
  it seemed to me that / u/geoffgbiz was claiming that the banks wo n't move because the people who work in them love london too much , and i was responding to that . 
   we all are born free but we still have responsibilities to our fellow humans and to our descendants . 
  the english translation is especially shitty . 
  slovenian one is a bit better , but the content is meh in any case . 
  of course . 
  because if any law anywhere in the world differs from the french laws , that country is literally saudi arabia . 
  france has the best and 100 % correct laws and that 's why its citizens should have the right to break any laws in other countries as long as the things they do are not illegal in france . 
  what happens when a french citizen does something something in some other country that is illegal there , but not in france ? 
  you seem to be certain and uncertain about it simultaneously . 
  when the general population has extremely low teen pregnancy rates and there is a minority culture in which teen pregnancy is considered perfectly normal and expected , it is reasonable to assume that that minority may be the reason for high teen pregnancy rates . 
  i completely agree . 
  i also find it strange that they did n't include ages below 15 . 
  and you are dreaming if you think that rich successful people in finance value london 's culture over money . 
  looks like poland is still the jesus of nations . 
   what will be next maybe cameron will come back into power and perform black mirror season 1 , episode 1 . 
   the worst countries for drinking during pregnancy from that image i can tell that ireland is the best country for drinking during pregnancy , but i ca n't really see which ones are the worst . 
   greece is not in the balkans now that 's just ridiculous . 
  wait , poland and croatia are leaving the eu too ? 
  illuminati conspiracy to prevent brexit confirmed . 
  there 's no tariffs because the uk is a part of the eu . 
  it 's the uk that wants out of this relationship . 
  why would you want to spend a week on a train ? 
  sounds like torture to me . 
  no , this is where we pile on the hipsters . 
  no it wo n't , it shows weakness . 
  a strong man does n't need to know how to do his laundry , he can get his mother to do it for him . 
  why would they hate him ? 
  i mean , he is annoying and all , but ca n't they just ignore him ? 
  [ maybe if you get rid of the skulls .

  in this photo he 's closer to purple . 
  well , you were probably in the town of bled , and this picture is taken from the opposite side of the lake . 
  there are huge difference in costs of labor between countries . 
  even inside the eu , you have an average net salary of about 2500 eur in sweden and about 400 eur in bulgaria . 
  i very much doubt that mechanics in bulgaria charge anywhere close to $ 100/h . 
  the cost of parts , on the other hand , is more or less the same everywhere . 
  even at the time when croatia seceded from yugoslavia , parts of croatia which had a majority serbian population wanted to secede from croatia . 
  that 's what croatian war of independence was all about .
