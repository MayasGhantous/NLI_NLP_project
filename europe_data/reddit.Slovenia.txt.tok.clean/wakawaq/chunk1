what about shkoder ? 
  from my limited knowledge of albanian history , i thought that shkoder was constantly the centre for political , democratic change, 
  who knows what the eu is gon na look like in 2035 ... 
  surprised to see the czech republic with such a relatively low unemployment rate . 
  [ josh widdicombe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=p4g2mdlonwg#t=281 ) already hilariously suggested a similar idea . 
  this track got me so hyped !, 
  main discussion doing on at [ r/soccer ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/2f9ey1/i_made_a_series_of_regional_european_football/ ), 
  interesting that royal league thing . 
  i know what you 're saying , yeah . 
  hey guys , i posted this thing over at / r/soccer but i figured you guys would also appreciate it . 
  i first got this idea during the world cup when i made [ a fictional world cup division i ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/292ula/what_if_there_was_a_fifa_division_i_world_cup/ ) along with a [ division ii world cup ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/293ma0/since_making_division_i_world_cup_was_such_fun_i/ ) . 
  later on i decided to try a similar thing on a club level and being from slovenia , i made [ a 24-team league from ex-yugoslav nations ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/2dqfer/i_made_a_list_of_the_24_teams_that_would_make_it/ ) . 
  since i had a lot of fun in the process and decided to make some more . 
  24 teams seemed like a bit much so for my next project i opted for 16-team leagues . 
  what i did was , i took the [ uefa country coefficients ] ( http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/country/index.html ) for the 2013/14 season to determine the number of spots every nation gets . 
  the number of clubs from each nation is a result of math and i had nothing to do with the decision which teams got a chance to participate . 
  clubs qualified through their 2013/14 domestic league result . 
  all clubs and flags are in alphabetical order . 
  some leagues are simply geographically based , some are taken from various political organizations ( [ guam ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guam_organization_for_democracy_and_economic_development ) , [ v4 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visegr%c3%a1d_group ) ... ) . 
  i tried to include as many nations as possible ( sorry turkey , armenia , israel ... ) excluding the top leagues 'cause i just thought it would n't make much sense to make some franco-german league or sth . 
  but i am open to suggestions and will be happy to create a league of your choosing  give me your thoughts on who 'd win and who 'd be relegated . 
  what do you think , could these leagues succeed irl ? 
  i apologize in advance for any mistakes . 
  if you see any please let me know so i can fix them . 
  yes . 
  lazarat , an outlaw albanian mountain town produced around 900 tons of cannabis every year until [ the cops raided it ] ( http://www.vice.com/read/lazarat-albania-cannabis-axel-kronholm1 ), 
  why is finland so bad at football compared to other scandinavian states ? 
  excellent reply , 
  england , right ? 
   we have a pretty unique baseball culture here too interesting . 
  27th team according to [ ibaf ranking ] ( http://www.ibaf.org/en/world-ranking.aspx?type=1 ), 
  you do n't call it soccer , do you ? 
  romanian league , 18th place . 
  from my perspective ( 30th ) , you seem fine :d, 
  lol , but seriously , seriously ... 
  is football football closing the gap on the first two ? 
  or are they safely in their throne of the top two sports ? 
   field hockey the dutch have some really unique sports preferences . 
  like that speed skating where you 're best in the world for reasons unknown to me ; maybe you can enlighten me . 
   we do n't even go straight into group stage ffs which eastern european country does ? 
  do n't say that . 
  steaua beat ludogrec yesterday . 
  but i guess you meant the national team in which case , yes . 
  is the rivalry between romania and bulgaria a thing ? 
  i 'll start with my country : 1 . 
  football ; making the world cup in 2010 was insane . 
  people were cheering on the streets and it was fantastic . 
  basketball ; goran dragi\u0107 is probably everyone 's favourite athlete here . 
  hosting the european championship was unforgettable . 
  i 'm gon na go with hockey although handball is very close behind ; the national team made it to the olympics despite the entire country having only 2 or 3 serious clubs . 
  oh , and an\u017ee kopitar . 
  handball was huge in the early 2000 's but now the clubs and the national team are not as good as they were . 
   western europe, 
  any particular reason ? 
  i think everyone gives the edge to the czechs . 
  any slovenian comrades that wish to come to my aid ? 
  i really ca n't decide who 's slovenia 's most & least favourite neighbouring country ... 
  i 'll start for slovenia . 
  * [ rtvslo.si ] ( http://www.rtvslo.si/ ) is the webiste of the national television . 
  it also provides some news [ in english ] ( http://www.rtvslo.si/eng ) * [ delo.si ] ( http://www.delo.si/ ) is the website of the best daily newspaper . 
  that fact about french in switzerland is mentioned in the video above . 
  as far as my problem with german goes ... 
  it 's usually the other way around , right . 
  like twenty-one in english makes sense cause first there 's 20 and then there 's the 1 . 
  but in literally translating 21 from german means oneandtwenty . 
  same goes for slovenian language . 
  hmm ... 
  i ca n't say i do . 
  i remember being excited when john green called us the world 's most underrated country , though, 
  slovenia - we react like when you 're in school and the teacher uses you in an example and your shy and proud at the same time . 
  not exactly media but i remember when [ slovenia 's flag ] ( http://i295.photobucket.com/albums/mm153/_b4g3r_/southpark_slo.jpg ) was featured in south park or when in ali g in da house says to an ugly girl : ` go back to slovenia ' . 
  we all knew about that . 
  like , wooow , slovenia mentioned in sth relevant ? 
  no waaayy . 
  i 'm wondering what 's the tallest in croatia . 
  [ working link ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/ugljevikpp.jpg ) also : before the bosnian war on the top of chimney with big white letters was written ` tito ' , in memory of communist leader of former yugoslavia josip broz tito . 
  during the war text was rewritten , so now is visible a serbian symbol , the serbian cross . 
  take the train from ljubljana to zagreb and you will pass by it . 
  i was hoping for some shitty pic from a phone of a lighting striking a tower and i got your life story . 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  i read the whole thing . 
  i 'm not mocking you . 
  it 's too bad you stopped photographing . 
  if you have any pics online , i 'd love to see them . 
  for slovenia it 's [ the chimney ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/termoelektrarna_trbovlje_in_sava_img_2581.jpg ) of the trbovlje power station . 
  it 's also the highest chimney in the whole of europe as far as i know . 
  it 's so high so that the fumes do n't get trapped in the valley during those cold inversion months . 
  surely you took some photos during all those storms , right ? 
  wow , that was one big referendum . 
  mostly regrettable decisions though . 
  umm ... economic sanctions on putin 's wife cousin 's son or sth like that . 
  that oughta show them !, 
  well , using the actual word would have been nice and fair . 
  they may have done it indirectly but these declarations must serve to improve relations amongst people and nations . 
  so avoiding calling srebrenica for what it is , is cowardly and does very little for the people . 
  well , allowing people into the un base would have been a start . 
  i know that is a difficult task when you have limited resources but when the alternative is genocide ... 
  is belarus all hot chicks & soldiers ? 
  also , why is the celebration today , when wikipedia states :  independence from the soviet union - declared 27 july 1990, 
  so what is going on now at cern ?
