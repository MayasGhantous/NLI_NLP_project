you australians really mix up the countries , do n't you ? 
   unless slovakia puts them in prison or if poland reopens its polish concentration camps . 
   i just put in `` germany should '' into google.co.uk and got the same autocomplete . 
  i got `` germany should have won ww1 '' and `` germany should have won ww2 '' . 
   but we 're going to hold a grudge about it forever i can definitely believe that , knowing that you still hold a grudge about the battle of kosovo , which happened in 1389 . 
  and there 's this thing called common sense , which tells us that extrapolating some data about a society 24 years into the future and calling the results a fact is silly . 
   the fact that by 2040 , 40 % of retired people will live in poverty ladies and gentlemen , we 've got ourselves a clairvoyant !, 
  cause we do n't want to talk about putin and brexit all day , obviously . 
  i agree that terrorism is not a serious threat to europe , but if the percentage of muslims keeps growing they could become a serious political force at some point . 
  and they are , in general , way more conservative than the rest of the population . 
  if you applied that standard universally , you would have to consider every great civilization to be savage , racist , etc. 
   except all these parties that are winning on anti islam stances also hold yes , and they are winning only because all the other parties avoid anti immigration positions . 
   well according to a small part of / r/europe ftfy, 
   try to get this by breeding conventionally , for example do n't show that to people who are already sceptical of gmos . 
  you seem to be assuming that we can produce an unlimited amount of solar panels . 
  but why hunt badgers when you could be guarding prisoners ? 
   to have the strenght to stab several persons in a row [ that 's no problem for an ustasha ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jasenovac_concentration_camp#mass_murder_and_cruelty ) . 
   roman salute you mean the [ german salute ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=german+salute&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjv5-rgi7fmahwio5okhuxsbzmq_auibygb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=655&amp;dpr=2 ) , right ? 
  this must be the best comment i 've ever read on reddit . 
   probably just because you ca n't tax computers the way you can tax people oh , so that must be why no automatization is going on in europe . 
  be strong eastern ukraine !, 
  sure because uk and denmark are absolute monarchies / s. 
   i do n't like our current prime minister at all , but i can always get behind the king would you start liking him if he became a king then ? 
  or did you mean that you could get behind the current king ( as the use of the definite article would suggest ) , in which case i fail to see how that can be an argument for monarchy in general . 
   some want habsburgs they want [ this guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_ii_of_spain ) to rule them ? 
   for most of the world romania is just another poor excommie country and if it was an absolute monarchy it would be known as one of the most backward places in the world . 
   ` russian speakers ' why the quotes ? 
  there are large numbers of russian speakers in ukraine and the baltic countries . 
  yup . 
  [ this is how that comment makes us feel . 
  thanks , but it is n't a natural disaster , just a bit unusual . 
  i guess that 's even more unusual . 
  does it usually even snow there in the winter ? 
  spoken like a true remover . 
  i assume that portugal has contributed funds and spain has n't . 
  i have first read the beginning of your post as :  poles are fickle and usually bear little relation to reality it was quite confusing . 
   for alcoholics , regular people preferred i though those were synonymous in russia . 
  you sound like you need to need to see a doctor . 
   undesirable speech is not covered by freedom of speech ftfy, 
  i 'd say the one who does n't support prosecuting people for expressing their political opinions has the moral high ground . 
  oh my god that sounds terrifying !, 
  is that what happens when you let gays adopt children ? 
  you hug your friends ? 
  what are you , some kind of hippie ? 
   also no way you 're changing the language that 's used in the mosques i do n't know , man . 
  europeans have been known to be willing to go through [ quite a lot of trouble ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thirty_years%27_war ) to change the language used for worship . 
   now we croats are known not to be very good with humor damn right . 
  it seems like the only jokes you are able to tell are about the size of my country . 
  more of an academic and a terrorist . 
   our king that sounds a bit medieval , do n't you think ? 
   unreliable way depends on how you do it . 
  if you hit a wall at 150 km/h , there 's no way you 'll survive . 
   ** zhe ** probably has extra ones ftfy, 
  it would be even more practical if you all voted for one party . 
  then the space in the parliament could be used with perfect efficiency . 
  given that the seats are arranged in a completely ridiculous way , i 'd say the room is probably awkwardly shaped as well . 
  it looks like some architect was rebelling against the notion of symmetry . 
  well , it will make the london transport system more diverse . 
  i suppose khan considers that in itself to be an improvement . 
   telling caller israel does n't exist . 
  a bit bold from someone living in `` belgium '' . 
  it 's a good thing you 're going in the summer . 
  in the winter , it can get very depressing . 
  there are still steelworkers with jobs in the uk ? 
   anything mean or anything you do n't agree with . 
   jewish  studying literally twenty kilometres away from a concentration camp now that 's just asking for it . 
  and they 've probably only taken him in order to [ harvest his organs . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/organ_theft_in_kosovo#.22yellow_house.22_in_albania ), 
  well , you must admit that he did find a very subtle way to let us all know he is a mac user . 
  if you think you have a better chance of getting your money back from some private insurance company or a fund 40 years from now , you are deluding yourself . 
   if the west goes to syria , we 'll have another iraq for the next 20-30 years and if we do n't , we 'll have a continuation of syria for the next 20-30 years . 
  unless , of course , one of the sides manages to massacre everyone else . 
  oh , i have completely missed your point . 
   even if something goes bad not much would happen to the merchandise you think not much would happen to some piece of electronics you are ordering from china when it crashes at 1000 km/h ? 
   and the distance was long enough ( ~ 380mi ( 611km ) ) from los angeles to san francisco that traditional hsr 's time was pretty long it would be about two hours , so the entire trip from la to san francisco would probably be faster with a hsr than with an airplane in practice . 
  according to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high-speed_rail#market_shares ) people usually choose a hsr over an airplane when the hsr travel time is less than four hours . 
  the roof frame is probably still wooden . 
  apparently they 'd rather have a dedicated place for that . 
  and they have a right to build such a place and to not have it burned down . 
  the hypocrisy , right ? 
  whether it 's pirating content or downloading leaked nudes of celebrities , redditors are fine with it , but as soon as there 's a slaughter of innocent people , they 're all up in arms about it . 
   the uk would likely defend ireland if it were attacked but what if it was attacked by the uk ? 
   humour is good for the morale it might be if it 's actually funny . 
  this image is just pathetic . 
  what you wrote could be true for some kind of a meme response , but this image is just weak . 
   it sounds very similar to how they pronounce their word for `` me '' not really . 
  the slovenian word for me is `` jaz '' , and people mostly pronounce it as `` j\u0259s '' ( with a schwa ) in everyday life . 
  maybe you are confusing it with serbo-croatian ? 
  in serbo-croatian , the word for `` me '' is `` ja '' , and it is pronounced identically to how slovenians say yes . 
  or maybe you have heard some dialect of slovene language where the word for `` me '' is `` ja '' - i think that is true for some slovene dialects , but i 'm not sure . 
   i can clearly see that only cities/towns over 50k are showing up not really . 
  in slovenia , for example , you can see ko\u010devje and postojna . 
  both have about 10k people . 
  a guy frustrated with his height detected . 
   is it just because the ss ca n't watch them all the time ah , the ss . 
  fighting terrorism since 1925 . 
  that 's some outdated thinking you have there . 
  nowadays , if your thoughts are not 100 % pc , you are literally hitler . 
  do levi 's usually last longer than that for you ? 
  mine usually wear out in less than a year .
