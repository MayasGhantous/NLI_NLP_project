  i was using it to ridicule the anti-intellectual attitude displayed in some of the preceding comments . 
   if you really think that people from 16 year old think the same like adults i agree they do n't , but i also think you may be overestimating how rational and responsible a typical adult is . 
  google is not a person , you know . 
   because presidents are elected for 5 years someone is bound to still have a guillotine stashed in the attic , no ? 
   and even had to miss the birth of his child for the job was there a fashion emergency ? 
   not only are slovenians the tallest we are about average european height . 
  the tallest in europe are the dutch and the montenegrins . 
  they are , on average , quite a bit taller than we are . 
  not necessarily . 
  a woman might actually want to wash different colored clothes separately and then iron some of them after they are washed . 
  i , on the other hand , just throw them all in the washer , then hastily put them on the radiators after the washer is finished and i 'm done with it . 
   i have plenty of russian friends well clearly you should stop trusting them after reading / u/williampz 's comment . 
   he is . 
  looking at his post history , i see no reason to believe he is a shill . 
  why are you so sure he is ? 
   do you know that the poles invented triathlon ? 
  they take a walk to the pool , swim a few laps and take a bike back home . 
  we have that exact joke about gypsies . 
  and it is confirmed once more that eesti can not into . 
   like this one \u0446 , i can imagine that it 's something like sh , ch or similar . 
  in slavic languages that use latin script it is written as c and it is pronounced like the first sound in the german word `` zeit '' . 
  i guess you would write it as tz in english . 
  your post has reminded me of [ this story ] ( http://anyportinastorm.proboards.com/thread/3338/slovenian-follies ) and it 's so bizarre that i just have to share it . 
  well honestly , a country whose language is not a lingua franca any more should have no problem finding english speaking diplomats . 
  i think he was saying that paris is now the beirut of the west , not that paris is now worse than beirut . 
   there was even a planned `` battle '' between the two groups with weapons at an agreed time and location nice to see them assimilating and adopting british customs . 
  you ca n't expect men to sacrifice their lives based on pragmatism . 
  no , just amused by your ridiculous language . 
  as any true slovenian patriot will tell you , slovenians are not slavs but veneti . 
  anyone who doubts that has clearly been fooled by evil communist propaganda . 
  black does not mean without sugar . 
  it 's actually based on weight and height . 
  wow . 
  you sound like a commenter on a news website . 
  16 mbit/s for 30 eur/month here . 
  fucking romanians . 
   or braindead ~ ~ sheeps ~ ~ sheep, 
   40 years ago women smoking were total rebels is that actually true in portugal ? 
  cause it sure as hell is n't here . 
  which part of greece ? 
  this does n't seem to be true for [ athens ] ( http://www.holiday-weather.com/athens/averages/ ) . 
  not if you intention is to trigger the french . 
  ca n't you buy groceries with all the money you have saved by evading taxes ? 
  well he was a war criminal and a dictator , but also a very capable leader . 
   estonia is not any more nordic than other baltic states stop it , you 'll make little eesti cry . 
   two genocides in a century two ? 
  i wonder what percentage of poles agree with his statement . 
  i assume not that many . 
   he has to grab a dead baby 's penis and trim it and then suck it . 
   currently living in lyon , it does blend in nicely in the surroundings i think the word `` nice '' should be avoided when talking about that monstrosity . 
  you forgot republika srpska . 
  for me , that one is the hardest to tell apart from russia . 
  now you need to think of auto-correct as a non-native speaker . 
  a valid question . 
  also , why is n't op murdered yet ? 
  the story we are talking about here is placed in belfast , though , and that is n't in the balkans . 
    `` dictators '' why the quotes ? 
  they actually were dictators , even if some of them were better than some of the alternatives . 
  same here . 
   fools he was clearly talking about [ this guy .

  not sure if trolling or just retarded . 
  if there 's a thread about brexit , there 's bound to be a comment like that , and often more than one , just not necessarily voted to the top . 
  or just , you know , get good at it . 
  it is still very hard to find good programmers . 
  now , i 'm not going to read the article , but if what you say is true , this title is really misleading . 
   joke about an atheist travelling to belfast [ that 's actually an anecdote . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfsd4sqbbky ), 
  nothing . 
  it just feels like it would be natural to also rape the livestock if you are already raping and killing everybody . 
  wait , they still are n't allowed to rape the livestock ? 
  the debt would be amazing , though . 
   most people over 30 have very good knowledge of serbo-croatian language from our shared past in yugoslavia that number should be at least 40 . 
  people who are 30 now were five years old when yugoslavia disintegrated . 
  i 'm 30 and most people of my age know a little bit of serbo-croatian , but are far from having a `` very good '' knowledge of it . 
  the headline in the top right gives you an idea about the age of a typical reader . 
  i guess french man is the new florida man . 
  some top notch trolling right there . 
  well , he has spotted a western spy , he needs to do something . 
  is albania the latvia of the balkans or something ? 
  what slovenian beer are you referring to ? 
  major slovenian brands are generally considered to be mediocre . 
  i 'm pretty sure rex was a german shepherd and not a kangaroo . 
  that 's just an insane level of warmongering . 
   i too use my ability to break timespace , when i sit in the bar , and bang suddenly i am back at the home of next morning , some mystical way this has only happened to me twice , but i hear it 's a much more common occurrence in russia . 
  which photo ? 
   we all lived together fairly peacefully during ottoman occupation with christians being the underclass , of course . 
  you sound like you would just love history shows on the discovery channel . 
  i have n't , i 'm merely talking about its reputation . 
  i can live with my country not being famous . 
  well at least it is n't famous for being shit . 
   decadent luxury [ that 's an understatement . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/presidential_complex ), 
   veterans are not happy what , all five of them that are still alive ? 
   guy sounds like he has issues well actually , all hungarians * sound * like they have issues . 
  the name is actually way older than united states of america and was first applied to the continent now known as south america . 
   mountain serbs now you 're just [ trolling ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4zimr3/former_prime_minister_of_croatia_zoran_milanovi%c4%87/d6wjf2v ) me , are n't you ? 
  i assume those are kajkavski ? 
  to me , they sound exactly like prekmurje slovenian dialect . 
  if i heard someone say those sentences here , i would be certain he 's a slovenian from prekmurje .
