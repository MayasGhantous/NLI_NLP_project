  i have learned serbian cyrillic in an hour or so to learn ( some of the characters are the same as in latin alphabet , some are the same as in greek alphabet and serbian cyrillic is a lot simpler than the russian one ) . 
  i 've spent about a month in serbia since then and i still read it like a first grader . 
  i think it would take quite a lot of practice for me to achieve a normal reading speed . 
  sure , because obviously all germans are nazis . 
   wikipedia is not relevant , anyone can edit yes , but if someone adds some false information , anyone can correct it . 
  overall , wikipedia is very accurate . 
  by the way , the page that / u/alas7er has linked agrees with you numbers of poles in iceland and norway . 
   once again following me around constantly trying to get on my nerves that 's some paranoid thinking right there . 
   and just as normal as having a `` german '' one . 
  why put `` german '' in quotes here ? 
   i would n't want anything bigger than a smart [ these ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canta_ ( vehicle \\ ) ) seem to be popular there . 
  your first image reminds me of [ this sex scandal ] ( http://anyportinastorm.proboards.com/thread/3338/slovenian-follies ) . 
  which is , incidentally , the most bizarre sex scandal you 've ever heard of . 
  there is one slovenian breed that i know of , the [ karsts shepherd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karst_shepherd#/media/file:kra%c5%a1evec.jpg ) . 
  but of course , the glorious german shepherd is much more widespread here . 
  you sound like a miserable person . 
  the uk would probably just opt in and then try to prevent the project from moving anywhere . 
  uk stronk, 
  the people who did this are probably not capable of deconstructing arguments . 
  they also need to remove any copper that is out in the open . 
  eliminate the pull factor for gypsies . 
   this is even worse than the racist attacks this statement is complete and utter bullshit . 
  but if poland is a jew , then why were there polish concentration camps ? 
   really good in a supremely trashy way now i want to try it . 
   posting ultrasound pictures of the foetus i 've had a pregnant teacher who has once brought ultrasound pictures of her fetus to class and showed them to everyone . 
  i thought that was quite bizarre . 
  like , jesus christ , lady , i do n't think you are supposed to show me pictures of your insides . 
   and seems to be in good health seems to be , you have no idea if he actually is . 
  that 's the spirit !, 
   st. louis will be our next detroit . 
  is n't st. louis already one of the [ shitholes of ameirca ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_united_states_cities_by_crime_rate_\\ ( 2014 \\ ) ) ? 
  the un is just trying to not hurt your feelings . 
  but the truth is , you can not into . 
  nah , it 's eastern europe . 
   pretty much what we have here as well in most of europe , really . 
  i live just south of austria and we respect each other 's personal space here . 
  is that a really subtle 1/32 joke ? 
   it 's quite people for people to be unable to understand lol, 
  it 's 30 % of the average salary , that 's much less than half . 
  god , the amount of self righteousness in this comment section is overwhelming . 
  i 've always wondered what 's up with that `` handy '' shit . 
   they blew magazine after magazine on full auto , no rifle shoots straight after that do you mean it does n't shoot straight immediately after shooting full auto , due to thermal expansion , or can shooting full auto for too long permanently damage the rifle ? 
  honest question , as i do n't know anything about guns . 
  yes , but the stronger the military is , the less likely it is for that last resort to be needed . 
  that first quote is downright disgusting . 
   the western media and we are influenced from that but / pol / told me it 's the other way around !, 
   you can be a muslim without adhering to the particularly sketchy parts yeah , but then you probably do n't wear a burka . 
  wow , they even included this [ normal guy ] ( http://images.taboola.com/taboola/image/fetch/f_jpg,q_80,h_125,w_150,c_fill,g_face,e_sharpen/http%3a%2f%2fcdn.taboolasyndication.com%2flibtrc%2fstatic%2fthumbnails%2fcf02e1772a1b1030c70838197c11a6b8.jpg ) who knows that one weird trick . 
  not really . 
  people who own real estate do n't . 
  they 're also g\u00fclen supporters , i 'm sure . 
  your comment makes no sense , mate . 
  the post i was replying to was mentioning her as an example of a good looking brit , so i assumed she 's considered attractive there . 
   bonnie wright [ this woman ] ( http://brasizemeasurements.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/bonnie-wright-bra-size.jpg ) , seriously ? 
  she would n't be considered good looking anywhere outside of britain . 
  edit : sorry for editing the post to something completely different , have n't realized you have already replied . 
  why would an austrian need to ask that ? 
  austrians ride kangaroos every day . 
  a family friend has hanged himself with a shower hose . 
  he has joined some cult a year or so before committing a suicide , so it may have been connected to that . 
   and physical work while its 35 grades in the shadow kinda sucks out your will to live intelectual work in a hot environment does to . 
  it makes me incredibly irritable and anxious , feeling just plain miserable . 
  fortunately my former coworker with a weird aversion toward ac has switched jobs now . 
   otherwise you could n't explain the difference between , say , spain and portugal , or italy and croatia well , about a half of croats live in eastern croatia , which resembles hungary more than italy . 
  it looks [ like this ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@45.2789384,18.8554454,3a,75y,39.89h,76.22t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1se1uglqe0r8momqcmcektnw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) . 
   15c or colder is ideal 20c is superior, 
   ashamed to look at his wife i know that british women are not famous for their beauty , but is it really that bad ? 
  you could always go watch a public execution . 
  edit : apparently 19 people here like public executions . 
   and we will have to finally forget about cultural protectionism and the preservation of outdated 19th century terminology concerning identity and culture the problem with that is that our culture is objectively better . 
  you can tell by the fact that people from other countries are migrating to europe . 
  they do that because western culture produces societies that are better to live in than , say , middle eastern or african ones . 
  montenegrin confirmed . 
  you may be on to something . 
  i have n't seen any erdogan apologetics here for a while now . 
  you can be racist against white people in general , but you ca n't be racist just about one ethnicity of white people . 
  i 'm not your chief , friend . 
   eu ai n't uniform either and neither are the us , russia , india or china . 
  does anyone feel commonwealth over their own nationality ? 
   a check you probably meant a receipt, 
  from you comment it would follow that emea profits are only 0.25 % - 0.5 % of global profits , which i find very unlikely . 
  that , sir , was a * fine * case of whataboutism . 
   what about people injured playing extreme sports or regular sports , really . 
  you can easily injure yourself playing , for example , football . 
  and i 'm not even talking about the american one . 
  do you think diseases that people with healthy lifestyles inevitably get as they age are cheap ? 
   and dont forget , some of these people may die when their offspring are still in school - moving some expanses to society by paying them ( half ) orphan related welfare yes , but many more of them will die right around the retirement age , saving the society a cost of paying them a pension for 20 years . 
  complaining about downvotes on * someone else 's comment * . 
  that 's some next level downvote whining right there . 
  pastafarian attack on charlie hebdo when ? 
  i 'm sure such blasphemy against the noodly one warrants a retribution . 
   and dumb people are likely to choose a radical ideology dumb people are more likely to not care . 
   stronk i came here to say this . 
   why are all images linked like this : it 's the first time i 've seen this , but i 'm guessing that mumbo-jumbo is the actual png data , [ base64 encoded ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/base64 ) . 
  so if you base64 decoded that text and stored the result into the file with . png extension , you would get a png file . 
  edit : [ here 's a wikipedia article about it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/data_uri_scheme ) . 
   is it just the inherent superiority of the slovene ? 
  that goes without saying . 
  i think that 's the best wall joke i 've heard . 
   iwo jima is staged , as well as the flag on reichstag those two are presented as photographs of people raising flags and that is indeed what they are , even if those people were posing for the photos .
