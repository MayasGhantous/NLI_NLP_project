   and i am sure every german citizen has done it twice do n't you dare destroy my stereotypes . 
   finland 's trade with russia has collapsed mainly because of russia 's economic problems but are n't those problems in part due to sanctions ? 
  til 3 % of greeks are delusional . 
  i was n't commenting on whether he is right , though . 
  i was commenting on him being an obnoxious asshole , so examples of state controlled doping programs would hardly be relevant , do n't you think ? 
   so , it looks to me like a systemic punishment ( banning the whole team ) is appropriate in the case of systemic , state-sponsored violations yeah , but by punishing the whole team you are also punishing all the individuals within that team . 
  and it is possible that some of those individuals have n't participated in the systemic violations . 
  i understand that people disapprove of the actions of the russian state institutions and would like to see them punished . 
  but when they are willing to disadvantage individuals regardless of their personal guilt in order to achieve what they see as justice , i find their stance on the issue selfish and immoral . 
  that 's a poorly written article . 
  when one sees that photo , the obvious question is `` what the hell is that monstrosity ? '', 
  and the article does nothing to answer that question , except for saying it 's a plane-airship hybrid , which does n't tell me ( and i guess most people ) anything . 
   your flags are so similar glorious panslavic colors . 
   moderators can and will remove posts at their own discretion if it 's apparent that no one died in your submission now there 's a grim subreddit . 
  top notch trolling . 
  9/10 , would rage again . 
  this must be the least attractive title i 've ever seen in this subreddit . 
  yes , and looking at the map , i 'd say the percentage of people who have answered yes is correlated with how threatened the people feel their country is . 
  i assume it 's mainstream media . 
   ppl please do n't do that . 
  so we are adding arbitrary restrictions not related to the job to make recruiter 's job easier ? 
   senior justice writer that 's comedy gold . 
  but so is everything about shaun king . 
   basically anyone who has experienced disadvantages because of the colour of their skin so we can also call white people who have been attacked or bullied by black people because of their race people of color ? 
  it does happen , you know . 
  tribalism goes in all directions . 
   you do n't get to act outraged well , some people act outraged so apparently they do get to act outraged . 
   the experiences of people of colour are completely valid does this sentence actually mean anything ? 
  how can an experience be `` invalid '' ? 
  well , people dying as a result of their actions does go well with their `` no justice , no peace '' chants . 
   and anyway , what have gays done to you ? 
  i suspect the lgbt lobby is trying to interfere with his precious bodily fluids . 
   but packed full of tourists and really bad truck drivers . 
  you are assuming that the value that a worker produces ca n't be negative . 
  also horribly unpractical . 
  it must be a huge pain in the ass if you actually need to find something on that site . 
  the fuck are you talking about ? 
  i think the two of you are talking about two different events . 
  you are obviously talking about the sale of the mobile devices division and / u/jaaval seems to be talking about the time when nokia got into partnership with microsoft and changed its strategy from symbian/meego to windows phone . 
  then your views are profoundly anti democratic . 
  you should work on your reading comprehension . 
   or maybe it 's bloody war and oppression those are n't natural disasters , you know . 
  so , you know that arresting journalists is supposed to be wrong , but you kind of like it because you disagree with some of those journalists ? 
  it was also extremely painful to write symbian apps . 
  it was an outdated os and needed to be replaced eventually . 
  they had plans to replace it with meego , a linux based operating system that would have some degree of source code compatibility with symbian ( it used the same gui toolkit ) , but they did n't develop it fast enough . 
  they have only released one meego device , the n9 , and that was after they have switched to windows , they did n't market it well and it was only available in a few markets . 
  it did receive great reviews , though . 
  if you think that 's bad , you clearly have n't visited slovenian countryside .

   in the us , there are murder-suicides seemingly every week , where a guy kills his wife and then himself that 's one of the most common forms of murder here too , it 's just usually not done with a gun . 
   a minority among other minorities there happens to be 25 % of this particular minority , though . 
  yeah , but the state does not make them black either . 
  people who dismiss the problem of children adopted by gay parents being bullied are arguing that the state should put the children into a social position that is harmful to them , and do so without their consent . 
   i am sorry , maybe it is because of your broken english , but i fail to understand you . 
  just fuck off with your passive aggressive bullshit . 
  the sultan is merciful . 
  well that 's a bunch of bullshit . 
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_balkan_war ftfy, 
  he probably means terrorizing kurdish civilians . 
   albania and the other slavs u wot m8 ? 
   and now everyone see what they are capable of you mean the weakest coup attempt in history ? 
   its stratically choosing the lesser evil which is erdogan right now this sounds exactly like the reasoning of the people who have made hitler chancellor . 
   and what about putin ? 
  and in america they are shooting negroes . 
  yeah , and that was all because he planned it much better . 
   a really bad , awkward landing if you fall off the horse that sounds like it could be deadly . 
  i 'm guessing it would take massive balls to publicly speculate that erdogan staged the coup right now in turkey . 
   49 % of them voted for erdogan . 
  yeah , that still leaves 51 % who did n't . 
   at least 2x17 he looks like he could be 25 ( but he definitely does n't look 17 ) . 
   you can see it even on this subreddit , where posts calling for the genocide/expulsion of european muslims are often highly upvoted show me a highly upvoted post calling for genocide of european muslims . 
  and i do n't think you can find a highly upvoted post that calls for expulsion of muslims who are here legally , either . 
  yeah , but you would n't be sending us your best . 
   as they are outside of the glass so the heat the take from the sun stays outside yes , they do that . 
  and if you do n't have them , you can achieve something similar by putting a blanket over you window on the outside . 
  now i 'm wondering how much does that monstrosity cost . 
  it 's much heavier than wood so it has that going for it . 
   port-u-gal !, 
  port-u-gal !, 
  port-u-gal !, 
  yeah , chanting our country 's name is n't really something we do in europe . 
  you forgot to say you are extremely touchy . 
  i assume many germans did , because they got all their news from nazi propaganda . 
  we get everything from -20 to 40 here . 
   it will turn greenish later on if the gypsies do n't find it first , that is . 
  it 's quite obvious he 's joking . 
  i would n't even call that trolling . 
   he could ** n't ** care less ftfy, 
   as for the turks who oppose him , maybe you guys should have been a bit more vocal a part of turkish society has been [ very vocal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gezi_park_protests ) against erdogan . 
  what erdogan is doing is despicable , but the turkish guy you have at work is not responsible for it , no matter what his opinions are . 
  it would sound horrible if an englishman tried to pronounce it . 
  you are a despicable human being . 
   one criteria for the police nowadays is being `` a good muslim '' do you have a source for that ? 
  i knew those mountain germans could n't be trusted . 
  bad-ass ? 
  they look gayer than eurovision . 
  of course , just like you ca n't be an atheist and a jew . 
  to be fair , you do get to write it , you just do n't get to be taken seriously afterwards . 
  well , he was representing you all .
