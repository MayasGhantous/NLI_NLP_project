  but paul is because of jesus . 
  i 'd say hungary . 
  they 're the only ones of our neighbors who have never tried to steal our clay . 
  ^ ( or at least we perceive it that way ) but we feel closest to croatia . 
  and we have most respect for austria . 
   i just think that making it mandatory would anger some politicians i agree with you , but i do n't think it would be just politicians . 
  in my country , at least , it would cause a huge public uproar and it would open up all kinds of historical wounds that we currently consider healed . 
   why would it be ? 
  because why the fuck should 440 million people be forced to learn the language of 66 million people when there is another language that is far , * far * , more useful to know and that many of those 440 million people know already ? 
   if everyone in europe agree to learn french/german and spanish , there 's no need for english really . 
  yeah , but then we 'd need to learn three languages , and we 'd still be worse off than just speaking english . 
  this would give a huge boost to euroscepticism in all the countries where the dominant language is n't german/french/whatever . 
  seriously , if your aim was to dissolve the eu , this would be a great move . 
  you made an account just to post this ? 
  are you shilling for the slovenian tourist board ? 
   you 're just spouting more hate no . 
  he 's insisting on holding people accountable for their actions . 
   i 'm no expert good . 
  otherwise , he 'd have to ignore you . 
  can i get a source for these numbers ? 
  i 'm not implying you are making them up , i 'm just curious . 
  do these numbers represent public opinion before or after euromaidan ? 
  since [ a huge majority of people in donetsk and luhansk have voted for janukovych ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_presidential_election,_2010#/media/file:%d0%94%d1%80%d1%83%d0%b3%d0%b8%d0%b9_%d1%82%d1%83%d1%80_2010_%d0%bf%d0%be_%d0%be%d0%ba%d1%80%d1%83%d0%b3%d0%b0%d1%85-en.png ) , i think it 's safe to assume they were n't too happy about euromaidan and it may have changed their attitude towards the rest of ukraine . 
   keep getting killed on their own land , defending it from outside aggression they keep getting killed in parts of ukraine they do n't live in , trying to impose their will on the people who do live there . 
  now , it 's true that the people who do live there are also supported by an outside actor that has its own interests at heart and whose actions are illegal . 
  of course , people who disagree with you must be a part of a `` brigade '' . 
   they have to take this stance to be fair , they only have to take this stance if their aim is to keep catalonia a part of spain against the will of the catalan people . 
   because anything you write is just a way to make yourself feel better or make others think better of you of course it is . 
  what other purpose do you think it achieves ? 
  the victims and their loved ones could n't care less about the thoughts of some random guy on the internet . 
  yeah , but you do n't have the will to even attempt to use force to stop them from leaving , so it does n't really matter whether they have the will or the power to separate violently . 
   so that amounts to what ? 
  spelling `` colour '' wrong ? 
  no , spelling `` color '' right . 
   europeans already learn to speak english with american accents too nah , we just learn to speak it without a british accent . 
   in my country we have coexisted with large carnivores long before the eu , thank you your country is also almost completely unpopulated . 
   i think it 's a lack of empathy according to jonathan haidt , liberals actually score higher on empathy ( on average ) than libertarians and conservatives . 
  so i guess you may be right . 
  none of those three reasons are actually racist . 
  oh , i did not mean to talk about antisemitism at all , my comment was meant to be about the no true scotsman fallacy . 
  i must have quoted the name by accident , i guess it just happened to highlighted when i clicked reply ( i do remember googling the name ) . 
  sure , as soon as they stop being idiots . 
   andy borowitz ah , so they are not * true * americans , right ? 
  no , i would n't throw a hissy fit about it , why would i ? 
  i do find your patronizing tone a bit annoying , though . 
  i do n't think that will stop bosnia , once they ( hopefully ) fulfill other criteria . 
  i think that a more important reason is that we do n't see you as european , and that many european nations have historically seen you as the enemy , and that is still a part of our folklore . 
  and they 'd behave [ like this . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/yjnz8xpnoto?t=30 ), 
  you forgot shitlord . 
  but why did n't pahor get a kiss ? 
  you 're just salty cause you can not into . 
  in these clips here , i could n't . 
  i may be able to tell croatian and serbian apart in some cases , if i heard some word i know is different or pronounced differently in each language . 
  they seem to have used the same language for bosnia , croatia and serbia . 
  is this some kind of mistake ? 
   the people who do this kind of stuff are usually not so smart i 'm not so sure about that . 
  ted kaczynski ( the unabomber ) , for example , is very intelligent . 
   and more often than not end up hurting the things they try to protect well , what else do you expect ? 
  the environment is complicated and the environmental activists are usually simple . 
  that 's suspiciously specific . 
  what kind of shit-hole county are you supposed to be to let a cult kill 10 people a day for half a millennium . 
   automatic beating , no negotiation . 
  [ like this ] ( https://youtu.be/5uzu58n-sso?t=72 ) ? 
  when i went to school , `` quietly slipping back into class maybe 2 minutes later than the others '' certainly would n't have been tolerated if it had happened on a regular basis . 
   which is obviously ridiculous sexual abuse of infant goats is a serious matter . 
   which is obviously ridiculous sexual abuse of infant goats is a serious matter . 
   thats btw the kind of `` criticism '' that you 're trying to defend . 
  is your point that this comment of yours should be illegal ? 
  wrong . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xomt3brjxoo ) is what happens when you put xtc in the drinking water supply . 
  is that cat on sedatives ? 
  you sound like a really unpleasant person . 
  just letting you know . 
  wait , even if you rape your enemies to humiliate them ? 
   pda does this stand for `` public display of affection '' ? 
  it was n't immediately obvious to me and i assume it is confusing for some other people too . 
  how ** dare ** you lump gender fluid together with trans or queer . 
  gender fluid people have the right to their own , unique and beautiful identity . 
   it 's terrible for social cohesion having some city areas plagued by street crime is even worse for social cohesion . 
  flawless logic . 
  can we into mitteleuropa too ? 
  ah , the sweet , sweet romanian tears . 
  i did n't mean just the economy . 
  kosovo and ukraine have other problems , too . 
  germany , of course . 
  which slav would n't want to live in the land of adidas and bmw ? 
  well , i guess it 's still better than ukraine or kosovo . 
  but it does include many latin and greek characters . 
  just because i own a dog , that does n't make the dog human . 
  to be fair , they fed cows their own brain , repeated that until the cows developed weird diseases , and than fed * that * to the commoners . 
  you are delusional . 
   chechnya was also full of warcrimes done by russia great whataboutism . 
  it only seems unlikely because muslims are a small minority in most of europe . 
  if their percentage keeps growing and if they keep rejecting liberal values , as they do now , it will eventually become not only likely , but inevitable . 
   that 's some wicked reverse-feminism nah , these days , that 's considered to be just regular feminism . 
  also full of racists , nazi sympathizers and people who believe in crazy conspiracy theories involving the jews and the downfall of the white race . 
  and , i assume , a lot of trolls posing as one of the above . 
  in many cases , that 's true . 
  but if you look at some one who looks like a typical southern italian , you can be fairly sure he is not a pole or a brit .
