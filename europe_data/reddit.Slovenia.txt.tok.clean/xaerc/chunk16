  i 'm guessing that would be much more work . 
  good thing or not , it does show a certain level of superiority . 
  it 's shameful , really . 
  i mean , japan and korea i can understand , but fucking thailand !, 
  i doubt rubbing oil on your skin will protect you from that . 
  i was n't objecting to the first sentence . 
  i assumed the word could be used like that in polish . 
  i know i would use the word `` kurba '' like that in my own language . 
  but i doubt they are equivalent in this sentence in the comment i was replying to  i would like to fuck this woman of course i could be wrong , since i do n't know polish . 
  this would n't make much sense  i would like to whore this woman, 
   dying i assume you meant * drying * ? 
  kurwa means whore , not fuck . 
   i doubt this strongly . 
  here 's a quote from one of the perpetrators :  we are not killers . 
  we are defenders of the prophet , we do n't kill women . 
  we kill no one . 
  we defend the prophet . 
  if someone offends the prophet then there is no problem , we can kill him . 
  well you ca n't exactly expect the device to be able to cut branches as thick as an arm , but not be able to cut your arm of if you put it into the device . 
  sure , you could have some computer vision system that would detect whether something is a branch or not , but that is setting the bar a little high , do n't you think ? 
   not everybody gets that distinction though , like the terrorists who attacked their office they did n't do it because they do n't get the distinction . 
  they did it precisely because charlie hebdo was making fun of their religion in a way that they consider blasphemous and worthy of death . 
  they probably would n't attack the magazine if it was just making racist cartoons about french muslims of northern african descent . 
  looks simple and effective . 
  cheeky bastard . 
  better than mountain germans . 
  pretty nice . 
  why do n't you want france to have a public healthcare system ? 
  do you hate the french or something ? 
  of course it does . 
  also people riding camels . 
   how can russia kill us lithuanians if we ** have already killed ourselves ** [ ftfy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_suicide_rate ), 
  ok , i 've overlooked that . 
  but still , the minimal distance between kazakhstan and mongolia is less than 40 km . 
  a tiny part of it is in europe , but the majority is in asia . 
  it borders china and mongolia , for fuck 's sake . 
   instead of circlejerking good gulen i 've never seen anyone say a single good thing about gulen on this sub . 
   however , see willy brandt for a passionate and successful german politician i know nothing about willy brandt , but i really doubt he was as passionate as hitler . 
  pretty sure / u/latvis has enough bitterness in his life as well . 
  also cold and dark . 
  and no potato . 
   severly cut down to size sometimes literally , [ like this .

   but what 's the point when they get interrupted again by our island of palagru\u017ea now the solution to that is rather obvious , is n't it ? 
  palagru\u017da rightful slovenian clay !, 
   besides none of them are even close to entering yet i hope you are trolling . 
   maybe not right away , but when the losing side gets over it i 'm sure you 'll get over it soon enough . 
  why did you guys stop ? 
  i was really enjoing this . 
   10 years nobody really has any will left for it i 10 years , a lot of leave voters will be dead anyway . 
   the wurzels wow , that 's almost as bad as slovenian volksmusik . 
  and i am sure no germans ever voice their opinion on their country 's interior politics although they have no idea what they 're talking about , and refuse to be educated . 
  well there is lots of brazil ( rightful portugal clay ) . 
   dc + + that still exists ? 
  but he sold millions of copies . 
  if you read through op 's comments , you will see it was not a joke at all . 
  no , actually , you love sex , but you know that 's because you are a sinful being and you feel devastating shame about it . 
   will increase until all hell breaks loose nice one . 
  it is also full of christ-killers . 
   what catalonia is proposing is little more than rebellion sure , if you see catalonian people merely as subjects of the kingdom of spain . 
  he never claimed they did . 
  there 's a difference between writing a comment from an obscure reddit account and publicly calling in a way that may actually provoke someone to act on it . 
  it was also phrased as an opinion , and not as a direct call urging someone to act on it . 
  it sounds different if you put in `` in the name of allah '' , but that is because people are being killed in the name of allah every day . 
  for having an opinion different from yours ? 
  you sound like a despicable person . 
  of course he has considered it , it 's just that he thinks of it as part of spain and not a real country . 
   ok , why do you think they do this ? 
  what reason does a muslim person have to burn a car ? 
  if muslims are responsible there must be a reason behind it . 
  ok , why do you think they do this ? 
  what reason does a nazi have to kill a jew ? 
  if nazis are responsible there must be a reason behind it . 
   why would one pick a hotel in a ghetto ? 
  easy access to cheap prostitutes , i guess ? 
  but two empty sets have equal cardinality . 
   google `` south hill '' and you 'll get the idea .

  is n't yous also used in north eastern usa ? 
   it is really greater bielefeld in that regard how can one nonexistent entity be greater than another ? 
  wow , you 've managed to call him racist without even hearing him mention any race related issues . 
   slovenia : :( not having seen any slovenian movies is actually a good thing . 
  ok , i think you are trolling . 
  if so , you are really good at it . 
   i do n't like to generalize people and yet you like to assume that if someone dislikes glenn greenwald it must be because that person is a sam harris fan . 
  yep . 
  this is why we need nazi mods in the relevant subreddit . 
  so , this cartoon is like polandball , except not funny or cute and pushing an agenda in a pretty unoriginal way . 
  when people are telling you that they are annoyed by the repetitiveness of your jokes , it 's more reasonable to assume that your sense of humor sucks than that theirs does . 
  do you actually believe that us politicians want a war with russia ? 
  no , it 's just that people in those countries are all germans . 
  i understand that , i just did n't think it was fair to raise suspicion about an article without making even the slightest effort to inform yourself about it . 
   i will admit i did n't even bother reading the article then maybe you should n't be trying this hard to discredit it ? 
  you mean [ like this ] ( https://pics.onsizzle.com/jesus-fucking-christ-jesus-f-king-christ-2618146.png ) ? 
  i do n't know what you 're getting at . 
  the english have never had anything but love for the irish . 
  eesti can not into nordic ? 
   then we should bill the serbian government for all expenses they cost us why not make mexico pay for it while you 're at it ? 
  shhhh , you 'll summon / u/collectiveindividual .
