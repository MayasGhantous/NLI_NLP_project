  well , they are embassy personnel after all . 
   where you 're country is language !, 
  maybe , but you ca n't say the same about greece . 
   carry on brexiting yeah , this gave me a good laugh too . 
  people are either with you or against you , and people who are against you all support brexit , right ? 
  your butthurt never ceases to amaze ( and amuse ) me . 
  please keep it up . 
  it may not be an `` official '' term , but according to wikipedia it is  still the most widely accepted term for the archipelago apparently everyone outside of ireland calls it that . 
  they are n't , but they do n't have dark brown hair ( as is typical for southern european people ) either . 
  my guess would be that 's because many of them dye their hair . 
  edit : another possible explanation is that those are averaged photos . 
  some of the areas on the averaged photo that you classify as hair were n't actually hair on all the input photos . 
  they were either background or skin on some of them . 
  since both background and skin are typically lighter than hair , that contributes to lighter average color . 
  i completely agree . 
  simon ostrovsky 's coverage was excellent . 
   i would not call it civil war i would n't call annexation of crimea a civil war either , but the conflict in donbass is clearly a civil war , even though one side is supported by a foreign power . 
   it may be something good except in this case it clearly refers to death of those people . 
  seriously , when people say that the death of those people is karma , it is really unambiguous what they mean . 
  your stance on this is just ridiculous . 
   taking a musicians life is going to change the world for the better definitely . 
  get rid of that damn noise . 
  nah , hanging just does n't seem appropriate for a monarch . 
  i think one of [ these ] ( https://assets.merriam-webster.com/mw/images/gallery/gal-wap-slideshow-slide/top-10-words-from-peoples-names-guillotine-251@2x.jpg ) would be way more fitting . 
  actually the raf has killed tens of thousand of german civilians in three years . 
  yes , but ifvs are cooler than trucks . 
   in the winter , roads are 14 degrees off the optimal angel to collect solar power . 
  in the summer they 're 62 degrees off optimal the angles on the page you have linked are measured from vertical . 
  a horizontal road is 90 from vertical , so that is 76 degrees off optimal in the winter and 28 degrees off optimal in the summer . 
   them with the electricity they produce so , not heat them at night and early morning when the temperatures are the lowest ? 
  you could just make the trucks hybrid and use the solar power to replace some part of the fuel consumption . 
   world 's first solar road opens in france : it 's ridiculous ~ ~ ly expensive ~ ~, 
  it was taken over by an illegal military organization that was supported by a nato bombing campaign . 
  except crimean people are not a phone . 
  they have a will of their own . 
   potential anschluss jokes aside damn , now you 've ruined all the potential anschluss jokes . 
  but why invest in places like the us when you can invest in [ eastern poland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knk7dredg3i ) ? 
  you 're talking to a mountain german , they do n't do jokes . 
  you should read moscow-petushki . 
  apparently the packaging contains another more detailed map with the borders we do n't agree with . 
  but i agree it 's not a big deal . 
  could be . 
  or it could be a german flag , you decide which is more likely . 
  it 's a actually unusually good for a google translate translation . 
  til `` swedish '' is actually a dog breed . 
  must have something to do with your 3500 $ average salary . 
   typical fascist tactic it is n't limited just to the right wing . 
  it comes up all the time when discussing russia and the ukrainian crisis . 
  my god , is that thing ridiculous . 
  it could be a redneck way of saying `` wake up '' . 
  man , you really need to calm down and accept that ireland can not into mountains . 
  their mountains are actually mountains . 
  those are hills , not mountains . 
  yeah , you 're right . 
  my initial comment was meant as a joke anyway , but then some people took it seriously , so i decided to troll a bit . 
  cheers !, 
  but who are you to decide whether they should suffer ? 
  you are only created in his image , you are not yourself ** god ** . 
  if ** god ** created them so that they should suffer then that is how it should be . 
  their suffering pleases the lord . 
  of course i have . 
  it 's called prayer , dipshit . 
  also lol at amsterdam being ranked the second safest in europe . 
  it actually has [ the highest murder rate in western europe ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/30/new-york-crime-free-day-deadliest-cities-worldwide ), 
  well yeah , but he was also his own father , but at the same time , he was not . 
  so you could say it 's complicated . 
  again with the arogance . 
  i 'm sure he 'll be happy to discuss his intentions with you before he condemns you to eternal hellfire . 
  it would also make them a wretched abomination . 
  no , you do n't understand . 
  yes , it 's true , divorce is a sin , but making children with three biological parents goes directly against how ** god ** intended ** life ** to be created . 
  it 's the arrogance of it that is just incredible . 
  a child is supposed to have ** one ** father and ** one ** mother , goddammit !!, 
  what 's next , people having children with dogs and horses ? 
  well the polish concentration camps were pretty effective , so i have trust in you . 
  except it 's roughly 1 gram per 1000 people per day . 
  would n't really make much of a difference with your 300 billion debt . 
   https://postimg.org/image/7n8xl2zlb/ now i finally understand [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/1myqy5yeld0?t=85 ) . 
  when people ca n't tell the difference between spelling and grammar , you really ca n't have faith in humanity . 
  did you ever doubt you can break international law if you have if you have enough power and money ? 
  it would be far less relevant without nukes . 
  i thought that in hellenic tradition , getting fucked by a man was considered a normal part of growing up and not gay at all . 
  [ problem is , balls is very big . 
  they said make sex with anyone .

  you forgot the glorious [ superfeger ] ( https://www.amazon.de/vileda-126504-superfeger-teleskopstiel/dp/b003bua8k8/ref=sr_1_4?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1481708774&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=besenstiel ) . 
   genetics do n't make culture if you were n't aware i agree , but the language alone does n't either . 
  you have centuries of shared history with the arabs . 
  the majority of people in your country practices an arab religion . 
  even your popular music sounds [ like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajkhqnzkh2s ) . 
  and what do you have in common with , say , kyrgyzstan ? 
  my guess would be not very much . 
  you really need to accept that your culture is more arabic than it is turkic and let go of this `` turkic '' delusion , 
  i think he is slovenian and not just living in slovenia . 
  that 's different . 
  becoming pretentious while living in france is really just integration . 
  are n't you guys basically arabs ? 
   funny cause you sound just like one of the people i like to accuse of being putins trolls . 
  ftfy, 
  where did you see him claim there were muslim ghettos in all the european countries he 's been to ?
