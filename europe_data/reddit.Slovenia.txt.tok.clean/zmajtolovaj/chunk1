  mushroom gathering is often ( in jest ) reffered to as `` slovenian national sport '' . 
  so it is popular , but it 's also regulated : one person can pick up to 2 kg of mushrooms per day , must use knife to avoid damaging the micelium , must use baskets that allow the spores to spread . 
  most common mushrooms : parasol mushrooms ( macrolepiota ) , porcini ( boletus edulis ) , chanterelle . 
  dishes : used in soups , as rice/pasta toppings or mixed in omlettes . 
  yup . 
  got ta watch out for them , less they wander off into dragon lairs ,

  edit : blood/kri is in another place - 5th stanza,

  if i remember the numbers correctly from our classes : in early stages of forest development there are cca 10000 trees/ha and when the trees are fully grown its 150-200 trees/ha . 
  also matching the number of taken down trees is trivial , since new generations of trees usually plant themselves ( unless you want to run a specific mix of species ) .

  heavily forested areas in slovenia ( [ map ] ( http://www.zgs.si/fileadmin/zgs/main/img/ce/gozdovi_slo/karte/gozdnatost_ko.jpg ) ) are where settlement was n't really feasible in the past - either hilly/mountainous areas or karst terrain with no water sources .

  i 've never heard of putting raisins into mi\u0161ke , guess i 'll have to try it sometimes . 
  anyway , i 'll take \u0161traube / flancati over mi\u0161ke anyday . 
  it 's a term used in forest care and management : [ pic ] ( http://www2.arnes.si/~opoljanelj/projekti/gozdna_pot/3_fazegozda_datoteke/image002.jpg ) in slovenian we have as many words for forest as eskimos have for snow :d, 
  go\u0161a or more correctly go\u0161\u010da is also a part of the forest in its younger developmental phase ( diameter of trees less than 10 cm ) . 
  they would probably bring them up from southern states , since a great deal of the muslims ( and by that i mean almost all of them ) in slovenia come from bosnia . 
   polka is a little cheesy though :p i mean `` na golici '' is okay , but otherwise the whole oberkrainer-style music is getting on my nerves , 
  keywords off the top of my head , since i 'm too lazy to do links : caranthania , prince 's stone ( kne\u017eji kamen ) , freising manuscripts , counts of celje , battle of sisak , primo\u017e trubar , jurij vega , jo\u017eef \u0160tefan , janez vajkard valvasor , isonzo front . 
  what is even worse is that being patriotic is often hijacked by people that like to claim that the only defining time in slovenian history was from the beginning of ww2 and throught the time of yugoslavia and that nothing that happened before mattered . 
  we have like you said history that streches back to 500 ad and we should be prouder of it than we are .

  in short : austria : we were in their empire for the longest time , then decided to split away ( after ww1 ) , then they occuppied us and decided that we were germans ( ww2 ) , after ww2 got most of our territory back italy : lived side by side with venetians troughout history , italians decided we were italians and that we desperatly needed their language ( ww1 and ww2 ) , after ww2 got most of our territory back ( trst je na\u0161 :'( ) hungary : were in their empire , mostly ignored eachother , occasionaly beat turks back together , in ww2 they decided to occupy us , but left after the war ; now we mostly ignore eachother . 
  croatia : on friendly terms most of the time , nowadays mostly bickering over where the borderline should go ( they believe that they need more sea , we disagree ) so basically we get along fine , as long as noone is trying to take away our stuff , 
  blame the church when something goes wrong , how very slovenian . 
  by your logic we should have had goverments comprised only of sds/nsi/sls , since voters get pushed into voting stations right out of the church . 
  have you seen the recent polls regarding the support of the goverment ? 
  it 's the lowest since elections ( they managed to piss off just about everybody this year in one way or another ) , and do n't pretend it 's the churches fault when the supporters ca n't get their shit together . 
   if the far-left party who proposed this law were pragmatic . 
  see , if they did that they could n't pretend that there are roving packs of clergy roaming the countyside chanting `` for the emprah '' in search of gays . 
  we already have same sex civil unions . 
  since 2005 . 
  like i said to someone else : the law failed becasue they tried to change the law that regulates traditional marriage and families instead of fixing the civil union law . 
  had they done that noone would be as upset as they were . 
  ah , muh enlightenment , everyone else ignorant . 
  last time ( 2013 ) the `` pro-gay '' side made up a bunch of stuff as campaign went along so this goes both ways . 
  by the end of it they were acutally saying that `` traditional families '' are actually worse than gay ones , that husbands are drunks that beat their wives and children . 
  the law failed becasue they tried to stick their fingers into the law that regulates traditional marriage instead of fixing the civil union law . 
  had they done that noone would be as upset as they were . 
  not really since last time it was much closer .

  like someone else said , they 're not taking anthing away , just giving more rights to homosexual people . 
  the issue ( imo ) is that they are taking a law that was n't written with homosexual people in mind , changing only a fraction of it ( i think a sentence or two ) and calling it a day ( and denying that ambiguites may arise ) . 
  and same sex unions are already legal in slovenia . 
  the political left fast tracked the law without much of a discussion hoping it would slip past unnoticed but it did n't . 
  the law that allows same sex unions now is n't perfect ( it should be improved in some areas ) , but it 's still better than the purposed changes ( which are a bit slap dash and leave a lot to interpretation ) . 
  first time i hear of the rome one , but google says that it 's a `` covert saying '' that woman went to the hospital or into seclusion ( usually a separate room , when childbirth was a taboo ) and she wo n't be back anytime soon , like the pilgrims that went to rome . 
  or basically any major infrastructure project in slovenia . 
  lindybeige video on that topic : [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn9ijcz5il8 ), 
  from what i 've seen the snow here ( slovenia ) comes in waves , but i have n't seen any research done on this , so it 's purely anecdotal . 
  usually we have some snow by the start of december ( starts in oct/now , but that usually lasts for a day or so ) , which gets melted by christmas ( white one was like five years ago or so ) and then snowfall in january , usually with heavy snowfall at the end of the month which remains to the first half of march . 
  they were banned , i think . 
  and gay civil unions are allowed in slovenia for some time now and the law was passed under a conservative goverment . 
  well last time the children adoption thing swung the vote against , but now as far a i know this is n't involved as far as i know . 
  imo this is all just cheap point scoring since : a ) there is alread a law in place allowing gay civil unions ; b ) the left political parties in goverment did didly squat for every other issue ever since they got in ; c ) majority of slovenian populace do n't give a shit about gay people unless it 's specificaly brought to their attention ( like this referendum and it 's turnout is gon na be like 20-30 % ), 
  but you forgot to formulate in the bankrupcy downtimes and goverment switches when they replace their top men :p,
