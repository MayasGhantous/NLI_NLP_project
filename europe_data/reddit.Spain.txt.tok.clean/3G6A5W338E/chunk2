  a valid opinion . 
  but i 'm not sure it belongs in the story text . 
   spain 's economy is already bad , without catalonia it would become a very poor country . 
  correct . 
   the worst part though , is that real madrid and barcelona wo n't play in the same league . 
  without discussing whether or not that 's correct , it is irrelevant . 
  of all the things , why would anyone care about that ? 
  i have to assume you 're joking around . 
   fervent nationalism , or in your case * regionalism * , has never led to anything good . 
   when it comes to your province 's name catalonia is n't a province . 
  catalonia is an autonomous community of spain , and a nationality by its [ statute of autonomy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_statute_of_autonomy ) . 
  calling us `` a province '' is outright rude and very offensive . 
   also , if i say catalu\u00f1a , as it 's called in spanish , the language ** spoken ** by everyone in spain , * it 's because i want to . 
  * i never had any doubt about it . 
  and it 's not ** spoken ** but known . 
  i 'm fluent in a few languages , but i speak catalan , so do millions . 
   you 're asking for consultation ** after having being riled up by ** opportunist leaders taking advantage of the crisis . 
  way to put another unrelated opinion into my mouth , derail the discussion , and insult the catalan people while at it . 
  but i 'll humor you , since you insist so much . 
   ** you 're being fooled ** by leaders who want catalu\u00f1a for themselves and their corrupt businesses . 
  you 're basically saying the catalan are idiots , easy to manipulate and that 's why they voted a parliament of 2/3rd for consultation which presented themselves as such in their electoral campaigns . 
  you might as well say we must not be allowed to vote at all and must be ruled 100 % from central spanish government , elected exclusively by the rest of the spanish populace , who unlike us are intelligent enough to be entitled to their own opinions on how catalonia should be run . 
   it 's no wonder that before the crisis catalan will for independence was around 30 % . 
  ikus13 , you 've expressed your opinion , but for the rest of you : some events : * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_statute_of_autonomy#2005_draft * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_statute_of_autonomy#legal_challenge_.26_the_catalans.27_response * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_catalan_autonomy_protest * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_catalan_independence_demonstration * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_way and some polls on independence over time to line up with the events : * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_independence#studies_on_public_opinion and while at it , some background by the grassroots organization that has had a major role in the process to bring support for independence where it is now from the 15 % or so it used to be before the whole deal with the new statute of autonomy : http://catalanassembly.org/resources/ http://catalanassembly.org/road-map/ and there 's also this [ excellent post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2b47ae/angela_merkel_spoke_out_against_the_independence/cj25qu9 ) by / u/viktorbir . 
   because not everyone in europe speaks english while everyone in the uk is assumed to speak english . 
  everybody in ireland speaks english , yet , for some , irish is their first language . 
  and the eu recognizes that , because ireland respects the differences among its populace . 
   you 're fighting for the eu to acknowledge catalu\u00f1a as a separate nation from spain altogether . 
   the thing is that you hate spain , and everything it stands for , absolutely false . 
  do n't put opinions on my mouth , specially ones that are completely unaligned to my views . 
  i do n't have any problem with spanish people other than those that spit on our culture , which include those that deliberately choose to say `` catalu\u00f1a '' in an english conversation ( spanish name for catalonia , imposed in catalonia as the only official name during franco 's dictatorship and many prior periods of unrestrained hostility against catalan identity , language , culture and customs ) , rather than catalonia ( english name ) or catalunya ( catalan name ) . 
   and you 're not really fighting for catalan to be acknowledged as an official language in the eu . 
  nope , i certainly am . 
  again : do n't put opinions on my mouth , specially ones that are completely unaligned to my views . 
   and then you act all offended when spain denies the possibility of enabling further advances of catalan independence . 
  we do n't even know if we want independence or not ; but we 're gon na figure out , either by 9th november in our consultation , or by the early elections that will be held should spain prevent the ( non-binding ) consultation . 
  spain just does n't want catalan opinion on the issue to be polled ... which is ridiculous ( and unacceptable ) . 
   besides , ask yourself this : does everyone in spain speak catalan ? 
  how about galician ? 
  or basque ? 
  how about spanish ? 
  yes ? 
   then spanish should be ** the only ** official language of spain in the european union . 
  does n't follow . 
  why , exactly , again ? 
  why waste money on irish translations when everybody who speaks irish should be able to speak english ? 
  ( and so on ) because irish native speakers prefer to speak their own language , and as a large ( some 130k ) group of eu citizens , it 's natural for eu to accommodate this people and offensive for spain 's central government to block each and every attempt of the catalan government for requesting this for catalan ( 11.5 m ) at eu . 
   spain applied for the one with the most speakers clearly . 
  so they did back in the day ... but since then , all they 've been doing is block each and every petition from the catalan government , so that catalonia is n't able to even * request * catalan to be an official language in eu . 
  as one of its ~ 11.5 m speakers , i 'm not amused . 
  this is n't , of course , the only [ attack on catalan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/valencian_language_controversy ) ... 
  an autocracy is very efficient at conducting changes . 
  ... is what he might have meant to say ? 
  since what people want does n't seem to matter to him . 
  note that catalonia has higher chances to actually vote yes : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalonia_independence#studies_on_public_opinion correct me if i 'm wrong , but it does n't look that way for scotland . 
   i also like the . cat tld which is supposed to promote the catalan language , although the only site i know that uses it is https://crypto.cat and that one has a catalan version of the site , so yay . 
  there 's of course elpuntavui.cat , ara.cat , vilaweb.cat and plenty other sites you have n't heard of because they 're less interesting from an outsider standpoint than crypto.cat  . 
   even if only a few hundred thousand people speak maltese , it is an official language in the eu . 
  catalan is spoken but some millions , and is not , because spain does n't want it to be . 
  specifically , they 've blocked every attempt from catalonia on having catalan gain recognition in eu . 
  if i wanted to destroy the catalan identity , culture and language , i 'd be acting the way the spanish government is . 
  current pp government bad , but the other bipartisan party , psoe , does n't really do any better when they 're in power . 
  after what happened with the [ estatut d'autonomia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_statute_of_autonomy ) , the catalan populace is finally convinced that there 's just no hope of continuing existence of the catalan people as such while still under the rule of spain , leaving independence as the only option left to preserve our identity , language , culture and customs . 
  saved your comment ... high reusability value , 
   next year , the catalan way , about 1,6 m people holding hands in a 400km human chain . 
   whole human chain is photographed at ground level and available online , so anybody can verify that claim . 
  furthermore , there 's videos of helicopters covering the length of it . 
  1.6 m people is no joke . 
  yes , it would happen . 
  but only after exhausting options . 
   start a war against catalonia catalonia has no military . 
  who 'd they start a war against ? 
  the unarmed catalan people ? 
  would they execute the elected catalan parliament president , like franco did with [ lluis companys ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lluis_companys ) , so that he is n't lonely as the only incumbent democratically elected president in european history to have been executed ? 
  that 'd be political suicide for the party ruling spain , and would also have international consequences . 
  yup . 
  if it 's 99 % as bad as the fud goes , it wo n't be that bad . 
  we 'll manage . 
   if you want to make spain smaller , then you 'll have to let me vote too , because i 'm spaniard and it affects my country . 
  as a catalan , allow me to reinstate something very important : we 're holding a poll on independence , that is , basically , on not allowing spain to determine catalonia 's future . 
  if we want you and the rest of spaniards to determine catalonia 's future , we 'll vote no . 
   you want that all of spain should be allowed to determine catalonia 's future ? 
  as a catalan , allow me to reinstate something very important : we 're holding a poll on independence , that is , basically , on not allowing spain to determine catalonia 's future . 
   she did n't speak out , as the title says . 
  yup , way to conveniently alter the title to suit somebody 's views . 
   we ( the german government ) defend the territorial integrity of all of ( european union ) member states , which is something completely different from the independence of a region but once that territorial integrity has already been broken , i wonder what her tune will be . 
   the majority do n't want independence . 
  how is it not democracy ? 
  that 's an example claim that you wo n't be able to make if the catalan people is polled ( in november or in elections substituting for it ) and independence happens to win . 
  but yes , meanwhile you can continue to call yourself * democratic * and at the same time to claim * the majority do n't want independence * against [ actual opinion polls ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalonia_independence#studies_on_public_opinion ) while saying that we should n't be allowed to be officially polled on precisely that ( covers eyes , ca n't see , ca n't see ! ) . 
  the catalan are used to it and are n't bothered with it anymore ( we found a way to stop that nonsense forever ) . 
   the catalonians are n't catalonians whatever they say . 
  they are spaniards . 
  that attitude ( spain/world not respecting our identity , language , culture and customs ) is a strong factor why we 're rallying for independence . 
   i do n't see why such a vote should be illegal if it 's nonbinding . 
  there 's one reason they 're opposing it so strongly even if it 's non-binding . 
  up until just a few years ago , popular polls put opinion at around 15 % for independence , and whenever the topic was brought up , they 'd ridicule it as an unpopular extremist opinion . 
  they still pretend it 's minor , although polls by newspapers and such show this has changed and independence would win : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalonia_independence#studies_on_public_opinion if the poll happens at all , even if non-binding , spain would no longer be able to claim that independence is unpopular and negotiations for independence supported by the expressed will of the catalan people would follow . 
  so they 're trying hard to prevent ( read : delay ) that . 
  it will still happen , however .
