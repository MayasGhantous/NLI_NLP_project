it depends . 
  but mostly i would n't too . 
  well , in spanish we say `` prefiero morir de pie que vivir de rodillas '' , i don \u00b4 t know if there is something like that in english but it will translate as `` i 'd rather die standing than live on my knees '', 
  yep , in spain the same . 
  only more when the service is excellent . 
  i think that you will find more russian minorities in the south of spain , near the beaches , 
  nobody expects the spanish lifts concentration !, 
  double decker bus as scale ... yep its british . 
  wait , pirates in the mediterranean ? 
  what year it is 1600 ? 
  yep , i think that the old santa barbara sistemas made our leopards , g36 , mg4 and usp 9mm . 
  but a few years ago it was bought by general dynamics so i don \u00b4 t know if we should call it spanish anymore ( now it is called general dynamics european land systems-santa b\u00e1rbara sistemas and is still based in madrid ), 
  the radiation of the nuclear bombs isn \u00b4 t as persistent as it would seem . 
  just look at nagasaki , they didnt abandoned the city , they rebuild it afterwards . 
  the problem would be a mutual assured destruction scenario , with huge amounts of nukes that would heavily damage the atmosphere . 
  if the alternative is giving it to the west , then yes . 
  they burned moscow to win against napoleon . 
  they destroyed their own territories to win against hitler . 
  they will nuke their fields to win against us . 
  especially if they think that they have no chances of winning in conventional warfare . 
  in case of a ( at first ) conventional war , i suppose that the next step after defeating the russian troops in the baltic countries would be invading their territory . 
  this time it would be completely different because of many reasons . 
  first of all , this time russia won \u00b4 t be bigger than their enemy in the war . 
  if the nazis decided to advance so fast was because russia had far more resources and citizens so , at the long run they would had the upper hand . 
  and russia won \u00b4 t be able to focus in only one war front , because i suppose that you and canada would attack from the other side . 
  there won \u00b4 t be a conventional war . 
  the icbm are mostly defensive weapons , focused in destruction and area denial . 
  they will blackmail us with them and once the nato troops invade russia they will launch them ( in their territory ) . 
  i highly doubt that we will launch ours if it is for defensive purposes , because that will trigger the `` mutual assured destruction '' . 
  there is nothing more dangerous than cornering a country with hundreds of icbms . 
  or free healthcare , but who needs free healthcare when you can buy some new f-22 with that money . 
  oh ... yeah it seems so , 
  thanks ! , those notes were taken at class so i needed to write them fast , but i can actually do it a bit better , maybe tomorrow i could update this . 
  [ just some notes from my first circuits class in my university ] ( http://i.imgur.com/h2l15vb.jpg ), 
  now i feel like we should make and spanish song about belgium , just to compensate it . 
  a bit . 
  any tips ? 
  we also celebrate the columbus day , but we call it the `` d\u00eda de la hispanidad '' . 
  there is a parade performed by the spanish armed forces , and an airshow made by the spanish air force 's aerobatics team , the patrulla \u00c1guila . 
  we have together chistmas and new year \u00b4 s day . 
  and for the rest of our holidays it depends in which part of spain you live . 
  in madrid for example they celebrate the 2nd of may meanwhile in valencia we celebrate the 9 of october . 
  do you have some sort of strange fetish with music and hispanic culture ? 
  of course , nobody expects the flemish spanish song !, 
  i just wanted to say an example for a conventional missile with huge range , and the tomahawk was the first thing that came to my head , i was a bit motivated at the end , 
  does the `` que viva espa\u00f1a '' count ? 
  the problem is that artillery is defenseless , especially against the air force , where the nato dominates . 
  and you aren \u00b4 t being realistic if you believe that a russian artillery battalion with material and resources to launch an attack on a nato member will be able to go through belarus looking for a good spot to shoot without finding nato opossition . 
  the only mobile artillery with enough range to shoot from russia ( or belarus ) to warsaw is the scud . 
  and that is because it launches tactical ballistic missiles . 
  we also have them , with enough range to shoot at moscow . 
  the are called tomahawks . 
  and the european air defense systems ? 
  did they dissapeared ? 
  and the russians can only have a part of their air force in the border without being suspicious . 
  satellites made intelligence something easy to achieve . 
  this would not be georgia or crimea kind of stuff . 
  edit : oh , and that kind of war won \u00b4 t have only one war front , especially when alaska is at only 80km . 
  how is russia going to bomber warsaw without air superiority ? 
  the government tried to make one , from the ebro ( one of the spanish greatest rivers in the northeast of spain ) to castell\u00f3n , valencia , alicante , murcia , almer\u00eda y barcelona . 
  but a bunch of people said `` fuck you !, 
  we don \u00b4 t have enough water '' , the building cost were `` strange '' as fuck , ( they went from 3700m $ to 4100m $ and they didnt even started building it , so yay ! , corruption ) and , according to the eu , this aqueduct was extremely poor designed because they didn \u00b4 t thougt of the environmental consequences ( even more corruption !, 
  we still need the nice red uniforms though ... 
  could we get something for being first ? 
  ^ maybe ^ some ^ jobs ... 
  c1 english , b1 german , spanish , valenciano ( basically a catalan dialect ), 
  uff , that doesnt look right , too brownish . 
  spanish chorizo , just try it . 
  yay , something to be proud of !, 
  we don \u00b4 t need that , at least in spain . 
  marihuana is legal for personal use and you can even grow it in your own property . 
  you can \u00b4 t sell it or consume it in public . 
  i guess italy was using the lira all this time ... 
  well , after the spanish civil war they took the 75 % of our gold reserves [ ( which where at that time the 4\u00ba largest in the world ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_gold ) as payment for their advicers and their equipment and thanks to that , and to the absence of the marshall plan in spain due to our dictatorship , we had a really bad time . 
  [ some of our elders even decided to fight against the soviet union with the nazis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_division ), 
  this . 
  glorious european football master race . 
  for spain i would say the late 2000s . 
  there were so many moments there . 
  alonso 's f1 championships , the football worldcup and eurocups , rafa nadal , the 2006 basketball worldcup and the awesome players that are in the nba right now like the gasol brothers , the real madrid-bar\u00e7a rivalry becoming even more important worldwide , including one of the best teams of all times like guardiola 's bar\u00e7a , etc. . . 
  ( serious question ) would you put the queen elizabeth ahead of the charles de gaulle just because of its size ( that is what makes it a supercarrier ) , even though it uses conventional propulsion , has a similar aircraft storage ( up to 40 aircraft ) , and doesnt even support catobar ? 
  [ do n't forget the publishment of the first spanish grammar book ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gram%c3%a1tica_de_la_lengua_castellana ), 
  yes , a rule `` by the best '' where only those with enough knowledge would govern . 
  and oligarchy shouldn ` t be a ( big ) problem if we came up with a good and periodic `` electoral system '' regulated by exams , like the ones that the state workers take actually , , but adapted for politics ( or at least thats what i want to believe ) . 
  i would like to see an aristocracy ( like plato suggested ) but adapted to modern times . 
  i 'm all in for making spanish the primary language but , we already call the usa `` estados unidos '' and in spanish when you have a plural acronym you duplicate the letters so it finally forms eeuu which is basically usa in spanish , sorry . 
  ( but if you still want to make spanish great again i wo n't mind :p ), 
  \\  implying that british expats wo n't give our points to uk . 
   it sounds like a russian doing a racist impression of spanish while being strangled to death . 
  [ god bless polandball . 
  relevant flair :\\ ^ , 
  do n't believe that article , it 's full of bullshit like `` the f-15 is the last plane designed for air supperiority '' . 
  well , i guess the f-22 was designed as a bomber then . 
  furthermore , the author has a huge boner for 4 gen aircraft and rates plane according only to their dogfighting abilities , bvr combat seems to be nonexistant . 
  and almost all planes are upgradable , just look at the u2 , it 's just that the `` lack '' of funds after the coldwar has halted the evolution of air combat , so we continue using dated aircraft due to the minor demand . 
  7/5 with br\u00e9zhnev . 
  at least for valencia ( where i come from ) that map and source is wrong . 
  here the separatist movement is n't a part of the pa\u00efsos catalans . 
  it is it 's own different thing ( just like the baleares one , which is represented in the source , but not in the map ) . 
  furthermore , [ that map seems like it 's representing the parts where valenci\u00e0 is used , rather than the separatist movements .
