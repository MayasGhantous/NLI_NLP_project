   just for the welfare ? 
  lol . 
   sounds like a ponzi scheme seems the kind of thing someone intoxicated by propaganda would say . 
  it is not a european expression , talk about losing your essence ... 
  i do not see that any group will dominate so that germany stop being what it is in a long time .

   we here in america have a culture that 's extraordinarily effective at assimilating immigrants within a generation or less , not really , ever heard of `` no irish need apply '' ? 
  does not seems good integration to me . 
   yet parents in countries with zero parental support give birth to plenty of babies . 
  and live in bad conditions . 
   noone needs kids to retire jobless offspring can not support their parents . 
  well , let 's not forget turkey . 
  there 's enough tension with them for real motives to need to add to the fire . 
  reports to the public are not report to administration of justice , and these are done once the perpetrator is really convicted , or they would be worthless . 
  and the ethnicity has little to do except because people that discriminate make hard to go forward . 
  because syria is not a totalitarian regime ... as for the rest , it shows you 're talking on pure prejudice . 
  guess what , immigrants in switzerland are a selected group , they do not have to follow the same distribution of crimes as the population of which they 're extracted . 
  that 's should be statistics 101 . 
  of course they 're younger that the average resident , and that does have a very positive correlation with crime . 
  young adult , not adolescent . 
  http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/legal10b-eng.htm is an example . 
  the range from 18 to 24 causes nearly six time more homicides than those over 60 . 
  unfortunately it is not relative to population size , but it looks similar of those i 've seen on paper . 
  edit : found a relative distribution http://www.allcountries.org/uscensus/139_homicide_rates_by_race_sex_and.html, 
  first table : it omits both age and sex . 
  swiss are taken on the whole , including babies , children and women , and people of old age that have a lower criminality . 
  immigrants are mostly adult , often young which is when human males are most aggressive . 
  oldest immigrants tend to return to their countries . 
  second table : that their countries have a high level of crime is not the same than they will do the same in their destination . 
   luxury seekers claiming asylum just like eastern europeans trying to get out of their country until 1989 ... 
  when iq tests were started , they applied them to immigrants from europe , eastern european jews had catastrophic numbers . 
  now their descendants are amongst the most affluent and cultivated of usa citizens . 
   eu insists and then they 'll sell out . 
  swiss are armed . 
  then until you catch the perpetrator you do not know citizenship, 
   vastly higher crime rate define . 
   why would you assume that her parents are good citizens ? 
  at a minimum presumption of innocence . 
   because it sure does n't show in their daughter . 
  because she did an adolescent thing ? 
  you see , adolescents do a lot of things their parents dislike . 
  in switzerland that is usually a swiss . 
   italy and greece send all their migrants and refugees north . 
  they 're not theirs , they are migrants and refugees that go to northern countries because they reckon these are more able to help them . 
  that they have to go through italy or greece is an accident . 
  what you wrote expressed a belief , and i decided that discussing with such believer is useless , or , in your words , i chose that to be true . 
   we 're rational , sentient beings capable of choosing the ideas we hold to be true . 
   in fact i think catholicism is one of the most disgusting . 
  i do n't share that perception , except when it affects catholics in vicinity to protestants . 
  protestantism seems to exacerbate the defects of catholicism . 
  you did not understand . 
  my frenchiness has not to do with citizenship . 
  only with the fact i did grown in france . 
  it was there . 
  it is only there were no muslim to be affected at first , and until some muslim did not get over the top exhausted by the continuous hostility , nobody talked about muslims . 
  i mean it in the sense that if i could identify which individual you are , what you 've written here is enough to discard you as a fine human . 
  what matters , in my regard , is that they did it . 
  western rulers opposed constantinople , do you know ? 
  now , yes the constantinopolitans that fled the ottoman conquest helped the west renaissance . 
  unwillingly . 
  wel , you `` tu quoque '' - d denying you did . 
  pegida is enough , if you were honest , something that i have no proof you can ever dream to be even if you cared . 
  no to what you want to say . 
  my people did not do raids in your country . 
  did i imply anything else ? 
  what i imply is that if i knew you i would not chose you as an associate if i can avoid it . 
  real people are rarely rational , most of those that claims so do it in fact for irrational reasons and do irrational acts . 
  like i do not justify israelis that murder baby palestinians when i say i understand their motivation . 
  afaict , you are not really criticizing , it is just a tactical way to deceive people . 
   how stupid can you be [ ... ] infinitely . 
  it shows that you have a very comfortable life and no understanding of real human beings . 
  your ancestors were not the best of people . 
  if there were justice , you would not even exist . 
  how to describe what they did ? 
  maybe :  year after year , generation after generation , for centuries , your ancestors went plundering europe until europe developed defenses against your evil . 
  is that fine ? 
  the west knew , it was against . 
   what exactly did they pioneer without even having access to the telescope ? 
  why it is then that a lot of star names are arab ? 
  none of that is specific of islam . 
  your ignorance is specific of you . 
  * gender apartheid still exists in northern europe , the americas , and non muslim part of asia and africa . 
  * oppression of people of other faiths has been the norm before even romans established christianity as their official religion . 
  * imperialism ? 
  rome is not known in your country ? 
  ever heard of alexander the great ? 
  china and the qin ? 
  * colonialism is what european empires did to the peoples they dominated , as a concept it is not applicable to islam expansion . 
  * slave trade has existed in the open until the end of the xix century ; in the usa they even needed a civil war to end slavery . 
  and a lot of people there are still resentful of that . 
  protestantism has killed a lot of germans , as the wars it created killed a good third of the population of the time , 60 % in in some regions . 
  islam was much more tolerant for most of its history . 
  else there would not have been so many christians in the middle east . 
  it was mongols and turks that were , even , or especially , before contacting islam , murderous to the point of genocide . 
  it is not that you are not too . 
  the discrimination of muslims is prior to their presence . 
  and neo-nazis have existed before they came in germany , so go to hell . 
  i did not chose to be `` french '' , just like i would not have chosen to be a black african , or a slanted-eyes asian , had i been one . 
  no , because of their acts . 
  else they would be unnoticed .
