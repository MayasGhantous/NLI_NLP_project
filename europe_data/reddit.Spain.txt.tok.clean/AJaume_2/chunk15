   but most politicians are thinking more about how they can sell the solution to their constituents - and realizing they ca n't . 
  mostly because they fed them with crazy ideas that inflated their egos . 
   in 1469 , king ferdinand ii of aragon married with queen isabella of castille , uniting both kingdoms and uniting all of the catholic spain . 
  but grenada was still under boabdil ( abu ` abdallah muhammad xii ) rule , even if in a subordinate position . 
  the others i knew . 
  well , if i needed proof that you live a very comfy live , i only have to look to greece . 
  imports from subsidiaries with transfer pricing so their value is not fully recognised in the producer country ( so less taxes there ) . 
  like in seat produces the intensive labour parts of a car , and send it to germany where it will integrate an expensive vw car . 
  same process with other countries in the east . 
   since the german export/trade seems to be balanced within the eu , this is actually not bad at all . 
  that on the whole germany-reu is balanced does n't mean every country is doing fine , in fact some are in bad shape as a consequence of the previous years of imbalance . 
   i 'm not sure some currency problems will make the history books . 
  when it devastate the functioning of whole countries , yes , it will . 
  now some time some of the consequences take the pole position , like the french revolution , but the heart was currency mismanagement . 
   could you please stop with the bullshit ? 
  9,2 % is far from being `` truly horrible '' if you really believe that go take a class in ~ ~ economy ~ ~ ** dehumanisation ** . 
  as i 've just written to / u/bristlerider , you need to be unemployed for a few years , so to get perspective . 
  no , that would be the nairu , because rulers privilege the money holders to the workers . 
  what you mean is frictional unemployment , and it should be under 2 % . 
  now if you think that one in eleven to be unemployed is fine , you need to be unemployed for a few years , so to get perspective . 
  i rather remember it was decided to differentiate from french flag , as both used at the time the bourbon 's flag , taking the colors of the catalan flag , with the bars separated to make them easier to see at a distance . 
  i do n't understand : unification 1469 de facto 1516 de jure 1715 as until grenada fell in 1492 , it was surely not even under one monarch , so why 1469 ? 
  in its majestic equality , the law forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges , beg in the streets and steal loaves of bread . 
  anatole france . 
  afaik , the money is no longer accounted in the starting account , or your pocket , from the whole day you transfer it , so no interests accrued no matter how little to you , and neither it is accounted at destination . 
  for one individual transfer it is rather insignificant , but if there are millions , that 's a whole different business . 
  in the age on internet and mobile connectivity , that should not be as necessary . 
  ps : a cheap phone could be provided to everybody . 
  yes , that 's part of the scientific method . 
  did you know ? 
  the barbarian in you shows . 
  you do understand that nothing that existed before you is in fact yours , except by the protection of the state as in fact otherwise anybody else are equally in their power to claim it their property ? 
  the teachers are not filtered for their ideology . 
  get that in every religious schools . 
  get out your bubble . 
   the rule of survival of the fittest prevail , with the strongest economies having the leading say in how the bloc is run , as we have seen they did not care about the people more dependent in greece , why should i trust that at all ? 
  you 're so dumb it 's laughable . 
  live amongst people that do not pay for a police to fend delinquents , an army to avoid plundering expeditions , that do not maintain a healthcare service so when you 're acutely ill you 're treated in a fast and efficient way . 
  if you care about your kids , that provide a school that is not ideologically directed by other people , and which teachers qualified , provide for good communication , protect property titles , provide an impartial judicial system , etc. 
  and all at the minimal price that maintains the quality of all that . 
   they share one important thing though , and that is to steal money from people ( aka taxation ) . 
  then paying for goods and services is theft . 
  probably that wig is a follower of ayn rand , author of atlas shrugged . 
  there are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old 's life : the lord of the rings and atlas shrugged . 
  one is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes , leading to an emotionally stunted , socially crippled adulthood , unable to deal with the real world . 
  the other , of course , involves orcs . 
  if you do not understand that a triangle has three angles , no . 
  business is everything on competition they say , that if you 're not competitive you will be expelled , etc. 
  and then you come and claim it is not competition . 
  the bailout were not given to the weaker countries , but to the members of their own countries to maintain their internal order . 
  if greece devaluate , the outstanding part of the debt will rise , then there is the problem that all contract in greece are denominated in euro , and if only greeks living in greece were concerned , the government might get away with an unilateral redenomination , but since many are by non greeks , that may live outside of greece , like vulture funds , they will go to international arbitrage courts that might not agree with greece government . 
  that would be a mess . 
  what greece should have done is not entering the euro , as , as it set , it is a russian roulette unworthy to play . 
  some time you do not need to look at the whole thing to understand that it is a con . 
  and if it is a breach of the law to give information on ttip or its sibling tpp , then they fall in the secret laws category that has no place in a democracy . 
   you cant feed 7-8 billion people otherwise . 
  that is already false . 
  no need to look at the rest of your rant . 
   that could have been avoided had they adjusted domestic laws that were n't a part of nafta . 
  that 's on them . 
  of course , put the blame on the victim . 
  mexico has always had a strong corruption and you expect that laws will be changed to benefit the common people ? 
  you are living out of reality , or are dishonest . 
  maybe the two . 
  yes , it would be a negative sum game , but some people , high in the economical ranks , would make big profits , and greeks would be extremely damaged , as exiting the euro is not equivalent at all with entering it . 
  wanting to profit no matter what the damage . 
  modern corporations are managed by people that are criminals . 
  they do not care about anything but what they take , they produce something useful only when they can not avoid it . 
   that 's why ~ ~ a lot of people ~ ~ ** all criminals ** think grexit would be preferable . 
  so you 're a scammer . 
  nice to know beforehand . 
   a byzantine emperor . 
  is a christian . 
  an attempt to ensure big corporations have no real opposition . 
  it is not for free trade but for captive trade . 
  this is my conclusion from what i 've in various economists that have looked at it . 
  talk about marginalizing ... 
   making icons of holy figures is bad . 
  then  they think they are disrespectful, 
  if you need that you are beyond repair . 
  why ? 
  nazi germans claim to be the voice of germans , similar to terrorist muslims , but are a much greater proportion of germans , than terrorist muslims are of muslims . 
  tell that to americans ( north and south ) . 
  two rather serious , in a way , journals of the usa : ny times and washington post . 
  two fish-wrapping paper providers : ny post and washington times . 
  well , while not a member it is physically inside , as it is surrounded by eu countries , except liechtenstein but since it is sandwiched between switzerland and austria , and rather small . 
  just like what is in your stomach is not inside you . 
  what a crazy system . 
  if that is so we must not allow private interest to rule any bank . 
  but , no that was not really what was at play , at least not at the start . 
  note also that the bank would keep functioning for clients , simply management would be sacked , and of course judged , and share-holders would lose their shares , unless they assume full , unlimited responsibility . 
   anti-darwinism is n't really that big a thing in europe , as far as i am aware . 
  so , but let it to these stubbs to bring it here if they find enough fools . 
  i 'm not sure of that . 
  afaik , it is public money saving private interests . 
  in the case of banks they should have let them fail , and nationalised them . 
  as things have been , they took 41 billions from unemployment funds and gave 41 billions to banks . 
  those so called billions of aid are not going through us , so they 're a fiction , an excuse to indebt us without ever having provided a profit . 
  yes , i know , but let it to time for that to turn relevant , in a niem\u00f6ller way . 
  in spain , the jews were ordered to convert or go away , then those that converted found that the `` cristianos viejos '' did not trust them no matter what .
