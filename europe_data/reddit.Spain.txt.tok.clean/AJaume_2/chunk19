  meaningless . 
   everyone who votes for sd realize just what a bunch of nazis they are , if they ever come into power . 
  if they vote sd , they are nazis . 
  fully dumb nazis , no matter what , they would never understand that they 've just destroyed everything that made sweden a good country to its people . 
  the lack of understanding of human being is staggering . 
  btw when you write :  and not try to murder people from a different religion ( ironically the same religion of the continent you 're running away too ) it does n't make sense to me . 
  to start , there no reason the religion of the victims was a motivator , second neither africa nor asia are single religion continents , and third , if religion was a motivator it is not ironic that they 'd hit at people of the religion that is the same they wanted to run away . 
  no , if they were higher , then you would not waste it so much . 
  so out of 22 millions tons in 500 millions people , 15 millions are from 65 millions people . 
  pretty wasteful , it seems to me . 
  i reckon there are some variance in the quality of the sampling . 
   shops save up on vat that they 'd have to pay from their own pockets if they donated the food . 
  sounds absurd but apparently it 's a reality . 
  the vat is a tax paid by the last buyer , it does n't matter whether they give it or destroy it . 
  i rather doubt it . 
  unless the uk specialize in buying excessive quantities of nearly expired foods . 
  if any mexican writes here , the probability that that mexican is not from spanish or other european descent is rather thin . 
  to me , it seems that 's a fragment from the spanish tradition of the reyes magos , that went to adore the new born jesus , they 're three that come from asia , africa and europe . 
  the zwartzepieters look a lot like the pages that accompany the kings , as these are charged with giving sweets to the kids . 
  the pages of baltasar , the african king , are black . 
  as far i am concerned , mexican are white . 
  some may have precolumbian ancestors , but so does chuck norris . 
  forgot to say , how many japanese are here ? 
  +1 i looked at some of the titles on the side , and read one , it is some kind of pure ayn-randism or worse . 
  +1 mainly macro blog is permanently open in my computer . 
   a recent eurobarometer poll showed us that immigration is now the most pressing issue amongst ~ ~ europeans . ~ ~ unthinking automata . 
   we do n't differentiate between indians and pakistanis . 
  both are just generic asians to us . 
  because they were part of the british empire before independence and then partition . 
  so you are another one of those imbeciles that do not understand tax code , and crave money so much that they will help any criminal to flee justice if they bring some money . 
  sorry , or not , i hit intro too soon . 
  since the conflict between ecuador and an oil company in 2006 . 
  which has less people in prison and lower reincidence ? 
  oh , another wit-free individual . 
  learn to read , will you ? 
  note that here in spain they cut help for unemployed in some 41 billion euro . 
  austerity , they say . 
  and gave 41 billion euro to banks ... 
   i 'm aware there 's a lot of corruption there , but i do n't think that translates to the rest of europe . 
  in politics , that position is negligent . 
  no need to keep discussing . 
  with that wide open door in the defense there is no way to resist . 
  oh , and specialists in a field work ? 
  i was not aware that felipe gonz\u00e1lez was an energy expert . 
  there no need for it to be widespread , it is enough that those few that understand what is in play be . . should i remind you how many people in this subreddit claim that in fact every greek is corrupt , was corrupt an will be corrupt , and they vote on that . 
  i live in spain , and let it be said , the number of corrupt members of the ruling party is staggering . 
  why should i not think the same is operative in the rest of the world . 
  is it corruption when people that were in a committee that supervises an industry go to work in that industry after their tenure ? 
   isds is non-controversial . 
  to you . 
  i see them rather as a tool to entrench the decision of corrupt governments , so when they 're evicted , the cancelling of these decisions is too expensive . 
   that 's frankly more than enough time to understand it . 
  and buy enough of the opponents . 
  do you believe documentaries to be just like what you see on tv ? 
  no , an hour of film needed maybe hundred of hours to achieve what the author intended . 
  now , that author might be honest or not . 
  here we see something which cause we ignore , presented as done by `` new european residents '' , which is a convoluted way to say immigrants , even if it fits to young people , and use the term `` gratitude '' , which is unwarranted , so no , i would not trust the source . 
  well , if these people are not to live confined , they need some money . 
  probably they 'd be fine with a three stars hotel and the difference of cost in money . 
  well , once seen , it is evident that liveleak is a reality distortion operation . 
  such an eu would be worthless . 
  the true road to serfdom . 
  so , pure bullshit . 
  they are pro efta , but the efta was not attractive to most people and stagnated , so the uk entered the pre-eu to pervert its purpose and turn it into efta . 
  because you 're aware that cameron want to erase the '' ** ever closer union ** '' words from the treaty ? 
  daisy-cutters are very significant . 
  pure torygraph manipulation . 
  they do not want people to understand the benefit of being part of the eu . 
  let me say that the telegraph is a vanity thing . 
  and of course propaganda . 
  oh , a german ... 
  well , you say salary , which i understand mean someone in the roll of a business , the example is for a free-lancer or autonomous worker . 
   but can you please stop calling us racist for not wanting to deal with this shit when we still have that choice ? 
   before muslim fundamentalism , it was arab nationalism . 
  and since it clashed with the interest of the western powers , these did try to squash arab nationalism , and like israel against the plo helped hamas because they were `` religious '' , they helped the most backwards of arab states , like saudi arabia . 
  sans blague . 
  you really do not know how ignorant are people . 
  everything needed was known at he start , as they are what is needed when you are not an optimal currency area , since the euro is first and foremost a political project . 
  as for germany at present , they could make it sure the workers got more money to spend . 
  because they were ignorant of the need of water when in a very hot climate that is different from what they 're used to ? 
  that would have been a good thing . 
  very good in fact , except it would reduce the power of abusers like you . 
  at present i see it as a negative act as it damages more people than those that are benefited . 
  you see after the plague at the end of the middle age everybody was richer . 
  who care about the dead , is n't it ? 
  this game is negative sum . 
  do n't worry , it 's quite usual , i did got a downvote for adding the information that the last case of diphtheria in spain had been in 1987 , after that it got positive , but still ... 
  well , the bad part is that unless you are at the top , exiting only makes thing worse . 
  he is , in part , and the guilty enjoy life while the common people suffer . 
  why not ? 
  they 're still homo sapiens . 
  because if they got it wrong , the association of his name and aspect with a crime would be too easy to find for imbeciles that would never discover that he was in fact innocent even if the real perpetrator has been found and condemned . 
  so you are an unthinking robot . 
   some confirmed scumbag says who ? 
  i dare say that many ceo have done more harm and still are revered by you . 
   i do n't want to . 
  that 's a pretty good reason for me . 
  just like if you were crazy . 
  it 's the same rationality as saying i did not want to turn so i rode over him . 
  as far i am concerned the guy ** is dr strangelove ** , as he is as deeply crazy even if in a different way .
