   many eurozone countries would rather be in an monetary union with germany we are , it is not profiting us . 
  yes . 
   only that germany 's surplus within the eurozone is getting lower and lower . 
  well , when you run your buyers into the ground , you can expect them to stop buying from you . 
  another data point about why portugal is so poor . 
  i 've seen quite a few posts were people were speaking in uninformed ways about greece exports , and since i remembered there was a web where that kind of information was available , i looked for it , found it , and while the data are from 2 years ago , i reckon they will still be useful . 
   the u.s. media goes over its own head to dismiss any racial motives ( often with the help of the police ) . 
  that same police that treat exquisitely aggressive and armed white people and kill unarmed and pacific non-whites ? 
   when were n't they impartial regarding the referendum ? 
   that 's what you 're implying at least . 
  i understand it rather as did the tories complain beforehand of the referendum ? 
  the fragments are equivalent to bullets , so it would withstand them . 
  well , i do not care very much about that independence . 
  capitalism is not synonymous with free market . 
  student is a temporary stage in life . 
  when that ends , you will be a worker , unless you are so wealthy as for your individual efforts to be irrelevant . 
  so what ? 
  the turkish state is basically a typical fascist state . 
  worse , in it the two main forces are military fascists and religious fascists . 
  that 's gives very little to people that do not fit their narrative . 
   i do n't want dictatorship of one class . 
  you want the dictatorship of the other class , of which you think you are part . 
  and you are not someone that decides what is or not democratic . 
   what democratic mandate has the eu commission for this stuff ? 
  properly speaking , no less than you . 
  do you have the data as csv ? 
  that way it would be possible to reorder them to analyse the behaviour of parliaments . 
  to tranquilize the public in order to it to agree to policies that are not necessarily in their interest . 
  i remember that here in spain , when people were claiming that we were into a building bubble , the government used to claim that it was not , as the market never gets it wrong , and it would be wrong to interfere . 
  you , apparently , need to spend a long time out of a job for you to understand . 
   a ll over europe i hear of farmers protesting they ca n't make a living the exporters and the farmers are different agents . 
  in the time of the great starvation in ireland , people died of hunger while the exports of food went on . 
   [ exports in famine times ] ( http://ighm.nfshost.com/learn/about-the-great-hunger/#exports_in_famine_times ) throughout the entire period of the famine , ireland was exporting enormous quantities of food to england . 
  in ireland before and after the famine , cormac o\u2019grada points out , `` although the potato crop failed , the country was still producing and exporting more than enough grain crops to feed the population . 
  but that was a `` money crop '' and not a `` food crop '' and could not be interfered with . '', 
  it saddens me to read how you misunderstand and misestimate the problem . 
  and saying employment is of little importance to people is not something i can see as reasonable , when i see many people searching in garbage bins . 
  please , explain . 
  no need for conspiracy when dealing with wolves . 
  when hearing snake oil sellers it is the best one has to do . 
  blah blah blah . 
  afaik , his experience there was the basis of 1984 . 
   `` cwrw according to [ wiki ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/appendix\\:welsh_pronunciation ) the `` w '' sounds like `` oo '' in `` good '' , so an anglicised spelling would be cooroo . 
  the cult of free markets says nothing is to be done by government , free markets will provide . 
   it 's because he had worked as one . 
  as one what ? 
  on ordinary articles , however i think in some instances they publish signed articles , but afaik not from their own staff . 
  well , you want skilled immigrants , whose education you have not paid , so to me you are a robber . 
  and when i say paying for an education lets not forget that to get an engineer you need to start with many babies . 
  people like you would kill all of those not useful to your purposes . 
   i do n't agree with the conclusion that any country that 's not greece can develop the greek problem . 
  it is a unique and rather extreme case . 
  oh happy you . 
  any money spent on your education was wasted . 
  just like the interpretations given in germany to christianism in the past and present in fact . 
  and of course it is racism . 
  pure racism of he worse kind on earth . 
  what does that mean ? 
  that greece is an extreme case is irrelevant when the problem is that as soon a country develop a problem , it will balloon like an avalanche . 
  delusion . 
  then it is a club that is not worth to adhere . 
  it has some relevance , as it is , if claims are correct , over a 10 % of regional gdp that goes out , and often disappears . 
  but at present there is no catastrophic circumstance in rest of spain that catalonia and majorca are not suffering too . 
  anyways that would not be why i 'd side with independence . 
  because economy is not a zero sum game ? 
  you would not believe how many times i 've heard that saying when it was people like me , rather poor , that had to pay . 
  now people appreciably richer claim it is not applicable because it is their turn to pony up the money . 
  note also that that 1 % would be if greece never managed to recover . 
  as for other countries , they are not in an economical catastrophe produced by bad rules . 
  would you refrain to help someone in a car that has crashed because the driver has been reckless ? 
  when i say '' ** no country ** '' without adjective it is because it '' ** no country ** '' . 
  oh , the no true scotsman defense ... however i 'm referring to people at upper management level , they still have wages , and they are still subject to income tax . 
  the recent change means that the reduction in taxes for them is bigger than for the lower levels . 
   i do n't like the pp , but the attitude that it 's impossible for anything good to happen from a pp government seems absolutely insane to me . 
  we are not really speaking of that . 
  and i do not trust that this is a really good decision . 
  once bitten twice shy . 
   hidden its true economy figures 15 years ago . 
  something that would be irrelevant were it not because of the utter craziness imposed on euro-governance by the germans . 
   but you can only blame the past for so long . 
  i take it you never suffered a maiming wound . 
  i did , a very minor one , some forty years ago at present , and i can guarantee you that is a very annoying thing . 
  you use it , assume your responsibility . 
  i take it you would never be a genuine blood donor , because maybe someone has hemophilia and giving blood to them would be a waste . 
  and then finns claims not to be fascists . 
  whatever you get it is 100 % more than you deserve . 
  which says everything about your greed . 
  which country are you from ? 
  iceland controlled its currency . 
  they might have been forced to cut on imports ^ 1 to the level of exports ^ 2 , but otherwise they were fine . 
  ^ 1 afaict unneeded imports except for fossil fuels and a limited range of products . 
  ^ 2 products they had in excess to their needs . 
  and the debt is at the highest it 's ever been , while at the start of the crisis the ratio debt to gdp was better than germany, 
  -1 as far i can understand what you wrote . 
  ever closer union ? 
  do you remember ? 
  then there is the fact that a monetary union needs transfer or it is damaging to the associates . 
  there was no bleeding . 
  you are a very dimwitted individual to insist on that metaphor . 
  or squarely dishonest , your choice .
