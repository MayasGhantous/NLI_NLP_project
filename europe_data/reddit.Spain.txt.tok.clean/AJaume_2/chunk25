  probably he means that the younger generation finds that all the claims of civilisation are kabuki play , and they take refuge in what they perceive as their only honest helper . 
   civilized people make good democracy , democracy doesnt make civilized people . 
  that explains you and quite a few other in europe . 
   nazism is equal to liberal democracy nazis was born in a democracy . 
  i doubt it very much that greece is significant in that perception . 
  you should look for the results ten years ago . 
  moldovans can get romanian citizenship and then move freely . 
  edit : it is the territory where volga germans lived that can not reunite , the individual can . 
  are you aware of volga germans ? 
  they can not reunite with germany but they can get german citizenship . 
  because money is the only thing that matters . 
  the euro would not matter if there was not this imposition of austerity . 
  that 's why i wrote '' ** if they were honest ** '' . 
  anyways , the economy do not rise because of austerity . 
  were they in a plane at 7000 + feet and shooting from a military rifle ? 
   companies and private organizations have spontaneously created currencies before . 
  they were not managing a country economy . 
  printing is the easy part . 
   you 'd only need to get hold of one rifle to wipe out all the marines on the plane . 
  and if the plane is flying pressurized , the plane too . 
  and the austerians have only been wrong . 
  well , if they were honest , which is honestly not something i can be sure . 
   while the first one showed growth , we can easily relate it to tourism not that much , as the last data are for 2q , tourism season is mostly 3q . 
   tax revenue is what builds hospitals that birth their workers , pays the teachers that educate them and builds the roads they drive to work on and it 's something they do n't like paying . 
  it seems that some people do not like to be reminded of that as you were at -6 . 
   if they 're taking money out the costs of goods goes down and exports rise i 'm not sure to understand you . 
  taking money out is like imports , except it brings nothing . 
  exports might rise , but the money out cancels most of it . 
   they 're structural . 
  only in the sense management in spain is incompetent . 
   lot of people would not be to happy about this post since when happiness of readers mattered ? 
  there are a lot of hive post that are very annoying , never seen you protest them . 
   the boys would be in their early eighties could be late seventies, 
  complete democracy does not equal to referenda . 
  the world of popper is not the world where we live . 
  did the politicians said they intended to get the country into unpayable debts ? 
   if people vote for politicians who choose borrowing over taxation to fund public services and benefits is a fallacy , they borrowed to finance big projects , most of them useful to the business class . 
  public services and benefits are already paid by the people . 
  many europeans are goose-steppers . 
   ya does anyone in greece actually pay taxes . 
  of course , just not those that decide the borrowing . 
   ye all retire way too early as well with full government pensions from 50 . 
  that is a lie . 
  the effective age of retirement in greece has been over the age of retirement in germany in the oecd data i 've found , except for 2010 , 2011 and 2012 where it is a little under it , perfectly explainable given the unemployment level , if you 're 60 yo and lose your job you will not get another , so ** if you qualify ** the reasonable decision is to retire . 
  from oecd : http://www.oecd.org/els/public-pensions/ageingandemploymentpolicies-statisticsonaverageeffectiveageofretirement.htm, 
   remember vacuum cleaner ban over 1600w ? 
  so you are a dumb individual that lack understanding . 
  every intervention since the end of the dictatorship has been in the direction of suppressing workers rights . 
  i would say that that is real political bias . 
  i would concede it if people decided that the structural part to change is the part of employers . 
  but i doubt it very much . 
  so no . 
   then is it the fault of the loaners for giving the money they asked for ? 
  fact is , yes . 
  the term moral hazard refers to lenders no less tan borrowers . 
  afaict , greece paid a premium on her loans , that premium can rationally be considered an insurance against default , so banks calling to be paid in full are being dishonest . 
  these people should try to live outside their air conditioned offices , and look at the real life where people seek the highest return on investment , and that means that an awful lot will send their money where , in the past , returns were solid . 
  so an italian will rarely invest in spain or portugal , but uk and germany . 
   why is his wife a redhead ? 
  northern africa was invaded by vandals ^ 1 and other german tribes at the end of the western roman empire . 
  then during the muslim period of spain there might easily have been redheads and blonds individuals going from al-andalus to al-maghrib ( both men and women , it is said that abderrahman iii was a blond blue eyed individual , and to play the part of a moor he tinted black his hair or beard ) , then there were the expulsion of the moriscos in 1609 . 
  add slaves from eastern europe , and the probability of redhairs and blonds is quite high . 
  then there are tints . 
  ^ 1 andalusia is supposed derived from vandal , as vandals came from there . 
  in spain we have a similar situation . 
   and then you wont have missed vat payments or tax avoidance . 
  missing them is a feature , not a bug . 
   more seriously , if the account is empty and with no perspective of filling it , it is irrelevant that there is any e-banking ( note that to most people that would be an additional expense ) . 
  i 'd be honored to be one rather than the corrupt individuals that presently rule spain . 
   opposite of the statist policy you 're complaining about . 
  i 'm no complaining of a statist nature . 
  i said that it was worthless . 
  invoking godwin rule does not equate knowing its meaning . 
   prevents the operation of rival browsers note that most people are not able to do these things by themselves . 
   economic realities political realities , or power relations as that is basically the same . 
  no , the right wing label ( btw , did you see that i wrote ( lib/con ) ? 
  the con is for conservatives ) . 
  i was just reminding the other that in europe liberal is a right wing movement . 
  you must have a very comfortable life . 
  i 'm sorry , whatever that wig says is just another iteration of arbeit macht frei . 
    `` shut up , slaves . '', 
  is what in real terms / u/visvis is saying . 
   no it 's not . 
  he 's saying that it 's more productive to do something than to complain about it . 
  this ai n't rocket science . 
  of course , as long as it is what is needed , if you disregard complaints then the probability of getting the right solution tends to zero ( not that i think you 'll mind a solution that went through killing millions ) , funnily that disregard is one of the things attributed to the soviet union . 
   and nobody here is talking about slaves except you . 
  i do not like euphemisms . 
  people who have to take whatever is given to them are not free , so they 're slaves , even if they 're not aware of that . 
  they 're not structural , that claim has been used to cut rights from workers no matter what was the situation . 
  for one thing , in europe liberal is right wing . 
  note that it is not sooner , but for more days , in conditions that are counterproductive to learning . 
  note also that 15 yo kids do 1050 hours per year in spain versus 856 in finland . 
  might be , i 've not looked the numbers , but there are about ten percent of spain population , so not that impressive . 
  sarcasm , i hope . 
  to people like me , what i said is the truth . 
  i reckon that it does not affect you and so you are fine with it . 
  typical ( neo/paleo ) ( lib/con ) pabulum . 
  simply the lack of air conditioning makes it crazy to keep kids in overcrowded rooms . 
  in these physical circumstances it is next to impossible to teach .
