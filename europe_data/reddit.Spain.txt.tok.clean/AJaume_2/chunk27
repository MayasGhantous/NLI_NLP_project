   his mindset to europe . 
  is already here , as we have seen recently in what was yugoslavia . 
  and too in the war that ravaged many countries in europe from 1939 to 1945 , as it is not that far away . 
  most europeans have a christian cultural inheritance , and since the middle east is next door , that affect us very directly . 
   the only meaningful measure when discussing the process of isds is average . 
  well , i 've no choice but to disagree , it may be the only thing we can know , but the fact that we can not know before is enough to me to refuse such instances . 
    i believe i remember you said you did a thesis on somthing related to the cap discussing with iggelkoten . 
  that is some time ago so i may misremember . 
   that 's right . 
  but not as part of an mba . 
  thanks for the correction . 
  so you do not understand the meaning of corruption . 
   i never did an mba . 
  i believe i remember you said you did a thesis on somthing related to the cap discussing with iggelkoten . 
  that is some time ago so i may misremember . 
   i 'm just saddened that you decided to try and make comparisons that were n't valid in the slightest to put forward your argument , instead of actually making argument yourself . 
  and i , that you do not seem to understand that average is not the same a a sure thing , if you throw two dice a big number of times the average is 6 , but in any cast it will be from 2 to 12 . 
  sorry to hear that from you / u/savannajeff , since in many cases have agreed with your comments , but on the other side i must remember that , from what i got from some of your comments , you did an mba , which to me is like entering a cult like scientology and on business matters makes you unable to think neutrally . 
  as i said , ** before ** you do not know the cost . 
  that is enough to me . 
  on average russian roulette is harmless . 
  so what ? 
  can you say what the cost will be before starting it ? 
  pay a million now , get it back in ten years , if ever , as a limited liability corporation can dissolve when it has no more money than its capital . 
  never trust the money-seekers . 
  judicial processes can be expensive , moreso for poor countries like romania . 
   if the government signed off a paper saying `` we will change the laws for you '' , then that government is corrupt . 
   if a ** corrupt corrupt ** government signs off a promise to sell you a parcel of land and allow you to develop a project , it should either follow the promise or pay you heavy damages . 
  so in fact i reckon you are corrupt too . 
  is that a joke from a sadist ? 
  and there are 2.5 acres in one hectare . 
   but on a more serious note , how do you think the land that are now the usa ~ ~ siberia ~ ~ became part of the usa ~ ~ russia ~ ~ ? 
  they politely asked the locals to join their country ? 
  everything bad in what you wrote is the doing of people like you . 
    french , italian , spanish , portuguese and greek population are against his politic  because the entire population of those countries do share the same opinion with their finance ministers . 
  i ca n't say i understand you . 
   a big moral positive in this is that you can treat your human enemy as things like never before , and we all know than humans at the top of peeking order have never have much problem with that . 
  you do not civilise barbarians with high technology , much less military use technology , on the contrary you reinforce their barbarity . 
  the corn laws had nothing to do with the famine . 
  ireland exported food at the time . 
  i 've read quite a few economists and they say that this is false . 
  these laws were as far as i can tell irrelevant to the issue . 
  nobody believed that something like srebrenica killings was possible in europe . 
  it happened . 
  now of course there can be some cosmetic arrangement in order to avoid evident damages to the unwary . 
  kind of rob a million from someone , you will be persecuted , rob one euro/dollar from a million you 'll get away untouched . 
  no , it is you that try to twist the issue . 
  you knew perfectly what i meant . 
   obviously , nobody is expected to starve . 
  out of sight out of mind . 
  the reality is the profiteers do not care at all if people starve and die . 
  are you aware of the great hunger in ireland ? 
  there was food enough for every body , but thousands died . 
  the hypermarkets are not paying the full bill , if it does n't happen that the evade taxes . 
  penny wise pound foolish is an old saying . 
  so a snake oil seller using sophistry . 
  any way , as far as iq distribution is what * i * mean , that holds . 
  as iq distribution is symmetric and so median and average coincide . 
  you need to be fired so the profit of your corporation rise . 
   do they also have the right to destroy other peoples ' property ? 
  people in the upper level of management do it everyday . 
  i 'm aware they 're , usually ^ 1 , more subtle and you are not able to understand it . 
  ^ 1 attacking iraq that was not related to the attacks to new york wtc in 2001 is of course not subtle . 
   stuff like this is why no one likes the french . 
  oh the fun . 
  get better information about the world , the real world not the one people that live in air conditioned office claim . 
  if memory does n't fail me , in other instance they stopped all the truck and looked at the content . 
   if i can save 30 euros a month on food , i 'll do it . 
  it 's only natural . 
  and then when you find yourself in a trap , do not protest . 
   this week in ** anti- ** france and economic nationalism . 
  the real issue . 
  lack of value ? 
   notice that the word job was not used once in that article . 
  did you notice the word `` refugees '' in the title ? 
  usually refugees are not allowed to work . 
  left and right have mostly a relative value , so while in europe obama and most of the democratic party would in the right , in the usa they 're the left . 
  most comparisons of healthcare costs in europe and the usa put the usa at twice europe . 
  iirc the usa public system costs about the same as in europe , the rest is the private system . 
  comparisons gdp-wise of course . 
  some wig that has taken to downvote you . 
  maybe because of your username . 
  as the greek situation demonstrate beyond doubt , as long as germany is germany , it is crazy for a country that is not germany to subject itself to rules that damage it . 
  in this moment , if my country was not already inside the euro i would not want to enter it . 
  i suspect you are another victim of innumeracy . 
  you 're confusing samples with sets . 
  if you live in western europe , going to university is mainly a matter of your individual talent . 
  if you get a serious disease , it does not mean you have to sell your house to live . 
  you usually can take vacations over two weeks . 
   printing money does n't create inflation . 
  at the zlb . 
   because krugman criticized the euro . 
  not so much as he said that the solution is something that smash the economic rents of a lot of people in europe ( and a lesser number outside ) . 
  that 's no hyperbole . 
  to individuals like you people matter less than one cent . 
  note that most of what was badly done in greece got a lot of help from countries like netherlands , luxembourg , and others . 
  in fact it would have been nearly impossible without that help . 
   such a thing happened centuries ago between the cities and countryside , people adjusted . 
  because there was a state that in more or less good ways ensured some cohesion . 
  now , saying `` people adjusted '' is an extremely despicable thing to say .
