  local adults cyclists , at first sight a cycling club as they wore all the same equipment , skipped a red light that gave pass to walkers . 
  so the real question is when will the local people integrate ? 
  do you mean some [ honorary consul ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/consul_\\ ( representative \\ ) #honorary _ consul ) ? 
  do you understand that they 're basically business people and not real diplomats ? 
  note that when i write not real diplomats that does not mean they have not a useful function . 
  edit link format error, 
   and will you ? 
  after reading and seeing how eastern countries are , i can no longer apply to them the presumption of innocence . 
   i highly doubt that any of ** spaniels ** will die for states neighbouring with russia . 
  nice , another detail of your great culture . 
  why should we chose your side ? 
  the real link is that anti-communism was justification for every backward islamic movement to be helped , with resources and training by the usa . 
  in israel hamas was favored to counter the plo . 
  then let 's get out of nato asap . 
  no need to spend money we direly need for ourselves . 
  there was the western european union , but the petty interests killed it . 
  afaict , the uk could not allow a real eu military force independent of the usa , so it was useless . 
  why should my country help your country in its dispute with russia ? 
   i would not call it minor . 
  additionally they do n't even ask their own people if they want the `` refugees '' do n't expect them to ask other goverments . 
  hundred of thousands of people over millions of square kilometers is minor . 
  note that western countries people were not asked if eastern countries were to be admitted into the eu . 
  at present , now that i know you as you are , my vote is no . 
  i was not referring to emissions ( of carbon dioxide ) but to the fact that they are a rival as electricity producer . 
   yeah , catalonia was an independent self governing democratic place in the 12th century ... where did i say democratic ? 
  nowhere . 
  for sure it was as much democratic as the english kingdom . 
   no , it was a bunch of independent feudal kingdoms until they all got gobbled up . 
  catalonian is as much of a country as yorkshire is . 
  catalonia was never multiple kingdoms , but multiple counties from the carolingian empire that went independent when the supposed protector was unable to defend them . 
  no county gobbled the others , they accorded that the count of barcelona would be the new sovereign as the king of france had abandoned them . 
  so polish workers abroad are unable to save , mostly unbelievable , or unwilling to maintain their families in poland . 
  the reference to spain is to show how much that can be . 
  if i understand you , all poles abroad forget their families in poland and have no intention to come back . 
   and most , if not all of those money do not reach the general population . 
  so corruption is rampant and you never vote a good party . 
   how much gdp can 3 milion people create in 10 years , more , less than eu gave us ? 
  how much money do they remit to their families ? 
  usually emigrants have the intention of returning , and they send money to their family while they work abroad . 
  and they can amount a lot , for spain in 1946 it was 21 % of all of its current account income . 
   this is against the austrian constitution which is not the european constitution . 
  austria may not have an army , that does not preclude an eu army . 
   never a country . 
  never an independent political nation . 
  for values of country , independent , nation and political of your imagination . 
  the fact on the ground is that in those years there were people that ruled themselves there . 
   almost half of the eu is a net contributor ... and the whole east is a net recipient . 
  if they are not willing to help with minor tasks , ... 
   catalonia has never been an independent nation never is a very long time , from about 987 to 1137 catalonia was independent . 
  then she entered in a dynastic union with aragon , in which both countries kept their institutions , the corts generals being the reunion of the two parliaments when needed . 
  edit s/institution/institutions /, 
  not much , i hope for sure . 
  if the central government try to destroy the catalan economy , they 'll get a much worse problem as catalonia is the source of 25 % of exports . 
  if unemployment in catalonia surges because of '' * madrid * '' policy , newly unemployed people that came from other spanish regions might go back to their place of origin . 
  that 's up to 2 millions individuals . 
  and add them to the millions already unemployed . 
  the election on 27 of september is for the regional parliament , that will determine the regional government , so fully legal . 
   nope since i like cheese and other dairy products , just raw milk to drink is horrid . 
  that is typical of lactose intolerance , the yeasts that turn the milk into cheese consume the lactose , lactose tolerance is only relevant when directly consuming the milk . 
  you see , your work is not that necessary , when you do not work , somebody else does . 
  the uk had up to 250 % of gdp debt in the past . 
  that why historically high tax scandinavian countries are poorer than historically low taxes mediterranean countries ... 
  some 15.6 millions people in the uk are at risk of poverty , against 11.2 millions in france , since both have a similar population , i 'd think france is better . 
  most references to social mobility i 've seen say that the uk is the worse of western europe , that it is much better to be born in france than the uk if your parents are from the poorer parts of society . 
  i 'd think france is better . 
  maybe you have lactose intolerance , i think about 16 % of people in the uk have that . 
  would any part of belgium stop being eu if the flemish independence parties had their way ? 
  sometimes it happens that a part of a municipality gets independent of the rest , do they get booted from their country too ? 
  not a problem for the people since they already apply them . 
  spain has not even opt-outs that might cease to be applicable , like would be the case for scotland . 
  the only ** real ** problem is how to distribute the votes in the eu institution . 
  catalonia would deserve the same as a country like denmark , rest-of-spain would be like poland . 
   more that left/green brand that tends to think it 's liberal . 
  i doubt it very much they think of themselves as liberals in the european , original , sense . 
  i think your sources are too usa-centric . 
   who makes decesions like this ? 
  people that profit from the status quo . 
  oil , coal , nuclear . 
  the debt is the result of the fiscal deficit produced by sending the money of the taxes to madrid and then having to wait for them to send them back , if ever . 
  note also that debt is not really a problem as japan has debt over 200 % gdp , the uk , france , canada or belgium debts are of similar size as that of spain . 
   catalonia has no entirely distinct culture from the rest of spain . 
  there are a lot of similiarities . 
  and some differences . 
  is like saying that netherlands is germany , as it fulfills the same similarities and differences . 
  or the scandinavian countries should be one country . 
  12.6-11 = 1.6 so roughly the offspring of the one-percenters . 
  of course some may go out , to consolidate experience , getting to know new markets and so on . 
  and no , those that remain do not go to 700 to 1880 $ a month jobs , they go to 2500 + jobs . 
   they 're not synonyms . 
  liberalism is about protecting liberty while laissez-faire is about not intervening , they are opposites when intervening protects the rights of individuals better than doing nothing . 
  so you are unaware of the meaning of [ synonym ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/synonym ) . 
  to be sure i suspected that before my first response . 
   liberal is not primarily an economic term , and in particular it 's not a synonym of `` laissez faire '' . 
  well , i disagree . 
  probably because your sources are more limited . 
  liberal in everyday life where i live means generous , unmeasured . 
  but in politics it means the same like in the rest of europe : opposed to state intervention . 
  for historical reasons , in the usa it ended meaning opposed to the established classes and so willing to have the state to act to protect the less fortunate . 
  to finish : liberalism is synonymous with laissez-faire : look at : http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/liberalism?s=t, 
  since a few years after the death of the dictator , there has been a strong investment in development of poorest regions that reduced the need to go to catalonia , madrid or basque country .
