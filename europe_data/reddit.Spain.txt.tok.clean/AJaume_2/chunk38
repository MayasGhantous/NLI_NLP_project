  much less ten ** s ** in plural , which at a minimum would be 20 . 
  and you can go to a racist country to flee a murderous country . 
  edit : s/fly/flee /, 
   this is the key distinction why islam is stuck in the bronze age . 
  you 've just displayed your ignorance , mohamed lived in the vii century , very into iron age . 
  as for the rest , it is pretty much projection from your part , and could be perfectly said of christians , especially protestant sects . 
    islamists are incurable individuals that will do anything , including harming themselves , to achieve their dreamed purity . 
   fixed  keep lying to yourself . 
   `` xenophobic '' movements , or rather movements who are fine having a discourse about reality , reality ? 
  you use that word without understanding it . 
  reality is that xenophobes are incurable individuals that will do anything , including harming themselves , to achieve their dreamed purity . 
   winning the lottery implies it it a rare occurrence . 
  implies lack of merit . 
  in spain eta terrorism used france as a sanctuary , a base , and a training ground in spite of the border being monitorised , because we did not enter schengen until 1995 . 
   what will happen when the syrian war is over and those syrians/refugees/whatever that did n't manage to integrate will be asked to leave ? 
  those that did not integrate would be amongst the firsts in wanting to go back home . 
   so actively limiting searches on certain browsers but not others is neutral ? 
  what are you saying ? 
  all browsers are equally capable of search as that is not their function . 
  you are mixing browsers with search engines , and the law affects them all no matter that the media may not be aware of them . 
   as for your condescending tone , fuck you . 
  well , many people do not understand net neutrality , you do not seem apart of them . 
  you 've just demonstrated your ignorance of what is a browser and a search engine . 
  those are not opposed terms . 
  probably you do not understand the concept of net neutrality . 
  until real resources are exhausted , no . 
  what you say is part of why i think neoliberalism is wrong , the only actor big enough to ensure that people have fruitful opportunities is the state and neoliberalism opposes that . 
   it 's too dangerous to give money to people that consider themselves your enemies . 
  well , climate change is a strong reason to end our dependence on oil . 
   he said that we need to just kill all muslims in the war zone since they love allah we would be doing them a favor . 
  they would be with their god so it 's a win/win . 
  not much different from those that claimed `` caedite eos . 
  ( kill them all , god will know his own ) . 
  i do not think that is acceptable . 
   ~ ~ religion ~ ~ thinking makes bad people do bad things . 
   edit : or at least justifies it . 
   though it has yet to be seen , it 's most likely that the attackers came posing as refugees , as isis said they would . 
  how did they got the weapons and explosives ? 
  well , i tend to think likewise , but i know that people can be deceived . 
   turkey is a muslim country that had a secular dictatorship imposed on it by europeans for a long time . 
  mustapha kemal was as turk as anyone in the turkey of his time . 
   a job that could n't be replaced you should have majored in engineering . 
  oh , an optimist . 
   the machines ( people who run the business ) can fund the benefit system . 
  somehow i feel that is not precisely what these people have in mind . 
   if they were to leave spain would lose almost 20 % of its economic output in one fell swoop , which might be enough to push it back into financial crisis . 
  a part of the debt is from catalonia . 
  so the damage would not be as extensive . 
  catalonia is fairly expensive . 
  however those that like going to provence , or the rest of southern france , might like it . 
  there are borders , even if soft , between usa states , not between albany and manhattan . 
  there is no reason to think life is fair if we do not make her so . 
  you do understand that you sound like an isis spokesman ? 
   i do n't even understand your point , and you would never be able to understand it . 
  probably not , so everywhere we have to be careful , but germans know they have the seeds inside and so must be even more careful . 
  do you think there should be a border between manhattan and albany ? 
  if there is no border then there is a commonality of laws . 
  yes , especially when you know that is not limited to a few individuals . 
  and observe that it is not dependent on real acts , but only on claims . 
  free speech as understood in the usa is claiming flat earth is real . 
  and then people like you think isis is backwards . 
  and the aca can be ro\u013aled back by states , as it seems it will be in kentucky after the election of a gop governor . 
  and the aca can be ro\u013aled back by states , as it seems it will be in kentucky after the election of a gop governor . 
  average as in arithmetic mean or as median ? 
  so you lack the capacity to understand the most obvious things : it is not the catalans that would expel anyone , it is the people that come from the rest of spain that have the ** right ** to go where there are from . 
  so they would have the right to their pensions from the spanish state . 
  they have paid . 
  it is their right . 
  to cite your words :  see people ? 
  they ca n't even see anything wrong with that ? 
  because you have no problem with robbing people . 
  well , in the eu it is the same , as small countries get a much bigger representation in the institutions . 
   since thet do n't consider themself spanish are they going to grant citizenship to all the non-spanish ? 
  just like italians , is any non spanish individual always accorded italian citizenship ? 
  what matters more is that residents from rest of spain will be accorded citizenship . 
   they also want to keep receiving spanish pensions , but of course they wo n't contribute to the fund anymore . 
  they have paid into them for a long time , and about a third are as spanish as a castilian ^ ( 1 ) . 
  and as time goes , the missing part will be paid by the locals . 
   and no , they do n't want an army . 
  they will be protected by spain and france already !, 
  who is to attack them ? 
  spain or france ? 
  ^ ( 1 ) so they can go back to their birthplace as soon as they want . 
   a catalan-eta situation not really probable , [ terra lliure ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terra_lliure ) was never much . 
  ireland and malta , i think . 
  well , maybe the uk . 
   gdp is also not that accurate to determine a nations ' wealth , there are better measures for that . 
  is that not what the author ague when mentioning that government services are valued at cost instead of market price ? 
   all those european government services are measured at cost of production , while equivalent u.s. services are measured at ( much higher ) market cost . 
  is it any wonder that u.s. gdp looks higher ? 
  slovenia is both in eu and nato . 
  tory politics are good for men , it seems . 
   what exact courage ? 
  he said ** what everyone already really knew was going on since like the 90s . 
  **  the way he went about it was traitors and more to do damage than shed light . 
  ** i hope to see him be prosecuted and hanged as one . 
  ** [ la verit\u00e9 , guy b\u00e9art ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja3hnz5kq34 ) . 
  reform is not what is needed . 
  what is needed is that workers get paid their real input instead of the plus value going to capital . 
  your reforms are simply ensuring misery for the generations of the future .
