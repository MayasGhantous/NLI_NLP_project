  so what ? 
  britons have been very vocal in proposing that capital is to be favoured over workers . 
  i daresay that this is the kernel of the uk opposition to the rest of the eu countries . 
   because the slaughter , nepotism and corruption perpetrated by the revolutionaries after their rise to power was really good anyway . 
  because the antirevolutionaries were not murderous , nepotists and corrupt . 
  how many irish died in the great starving ? 
  i do not know what you are talking about . 
  maybe you refer to wars , these tend to be pretty murderous , just ask the usa when they decided capriciously to attack iraq in 2003 . 
   napoleon [ ... ] caused a lot of wars . 
  rather the monarchies of europe did not want the french revolution to be successful , and by their attacks on france made napoleon the unavoidable leader . 
  ever heard of general ironside ? 
  should i remind you that the usa were born from a revolution against a supposed oppression that was much lesser than the one suffered by russians ? 
  i hope it is sarcasm . 
  that 's why they want to get out of the echr to set ** british ** human rights . 
  should i need to say that is true of most people in the world ? 
  having to assume responsibility for one own decisions fills most people with fear . 
  the reason is because capital part in gains has grown without comparison to workers part . 
  britons have nobody but themselves to blame for that . 
  i do not see that the su was a real free leftist system , it had many external negative inputs . 
  now if you look at italy under mussolini or germany under hitler or spain under franco you can see genuine right wingers getting what they want , without external interference , except for hitler when he expanded beyond its borders within europe . 
  liberty is a leftist concept , against the right wing concept of unrestricted power . 
  the right to have a private property is only valid in a functioning society , as otherwise the way to acquire property is too often plunder . 
  and note that slavery was not ill considered by right wingers . 
  people deprived of liberty and turned into private property , a definitely right wing position . 
  afaict , right wing ideas are anti human rights . 
  well , or rather bad , this is history , and quite recent . 
  he is a right winger , who would expect him to care about human rights ? 
   apparently you can not be racist against white people / s in xix century usa , irish were not considered white . 
  so being racist against irish people , like with nina ( no irish need apply ) signs , was not being racist against white people . 
   there is a narrative in western european media that eastern europeans are supposedly barbaric and uncultured . 
  no need for that , simply reading / r/europe what eastern europeans write is enough . 
   and hungarians never knew that they choose hitler and pol pot in one person orb\u00e1n might not be hitler and pol pot but only because of lack of resources . 
  hungarians knew very well what kind of politicians he was before the last election . 
  does n't represent me ? 
  shot can mean chupito in this context . 
   afghanistan was required . 
  in the late 1970s ? 
  i 'm not talking about the attack after 2001 , that was a late consequence , not the source . 
  the usa went into iraq because of hubris by bush and co. 
  the rest is consequence of the dislocation . 
  as for syrians coming to europe ? 
  well european countries are quite nearer than the usa . 
  you do understand that a lot of the present problems are the product of the usa intervention in afghanistan and middle east ? 
  that they ** created ** groups highly trained in terrorism and helped them create the logistics to provide them with whatever they need ? 
   if you want to see what happens when you accumulate so much debt check japan - https://www.sovereignman.com/trends/japan-projects-to-spend-43-of-tax-revenue-just-to-pay-interest-on-the-debt-16338/ . 
  43 % of their tax revenues goes to paying debt . 
  and this number is likely to go higher which will slow their gdp growth more and more . 
  that link has all the appearance of a scamming operation . 
  and on general principles , it is impossible that japan is paying 43 % of its tax revenue in interests . 
  that would require japan to tax some 80 % of its gdp . 
  no , simply their behaviour is different . 
  euro area economy has behaved worse than the usa , that 's why i say all of them have been damaged . 
  andorra never had her own currency but used spanish peseta and french franc , vatican and san marino used italian lira . 
  monaco used french franc . 
  montenegro and kosovo used the deutsche mark due to their unstable situation . 
  and if you think that portugal is well , let me wish every of your health recovery be as successful . 
  all of them . 
  for the boss , not the worker . 
  the reason lies in the idiotic rules of the euro governance . 
  rules that would sink any country beyond a minimal size . 
   a second generation immigrant or foreigner who was non-jewish would meet no resistance in the third reich providing he was n't gay or roma , so why the false equivocation ? 
  so you 're fine with the jewish persecution , i gather . 
  afaict , there were no significant immigration in germany in those years . 
  anyway it is not a false equivocation , that does the tell on you , simply these people have a rationale for their behaviour that is just as despicable . 
  there are less that 350000 icelanders , that 's about the size of valenciennes . 
  the jews were dispossessed of citizenship after hitler came to power . 
  so they were like second generation immigrants , or foreigners . 
  those that never integrate . 
   and it is also politicians fault that they decided to make decisions against ~ ~ people 's ~ ~ ** criminals ' ** will . 
  there is always a minority that will disagree with any elected government . 
  they caught him in flagranti , that 's probable cause for the judge to allow listening , and to get register of last calls . 
  you forget that sweden population and economy is nearly twice finland ones . 
  my understanding is that it applied to the central banks of the euroarea only , as they would emit euros , if they do not emit euros then not . 
  i might be wrong . 
  123 is only for euro countries . 
  it is still a bad article . 
  budget ceiling is an idiotic idea . 
  its purpose is to disadvantatge the worker classes respect to money holders . 
  in france and southern europe there have been political parties that called themselves socialist or communist , those that went with socialist were those that proposed social democracy . 
  people did not feel confused in my experience . 
  taxes too low on houses plusvalue . 
   the bible is said [ ... ] by some , and other say that any guy can read it without any preparation and act according to his individual reading . 
  that is protestantism in case you are not aware . 
  in germany they warred so to kill a third of the population in the past . 
  you moved on because you were profiting from the murders that happened . 
  i 'm only saying that if the people that say the division is good would have been the dead , that would have been fine , as thing are they were the killers . 
  do you think that killers do not deserve to be killed in legitimate defense ? 
   it would be impossible to get ~ ~ a fair ~ ~ ** an unfair ** agreement for both sides if every single bit of it had to be debated at every step . 
  maybe you would be happy to have your country ruined because a foreign power thought it good for them . 
  sure . 
   the brits who are as always , deep down , pursuing that `` balance of power thing , '' which is probably a good thing . 
  now if the only people to die pursuing that `` balance of power thing '' had been british , maybe that would have been good . 
  the tea party is not a political party . 
   i really do n't know what happened in the middle east back then and why extremism took over , anticommunism . 
  it is much easier when you 're young . 
  unless it is recent , post present poland founding , immigrant minorities , they are strictly poland citizens , and as such have their rights no matter what happens in other countries . 
  learn history . 
  the former workers will have unemployment subsidies , is n't it ? 
  and they 'll still be covered with healthcare , their kids will still be able to go school , etc. 
  europe has a more direct role in that .
