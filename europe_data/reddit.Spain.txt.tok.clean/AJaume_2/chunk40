  are you sure ? 
  if it is https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3q9gbd/belgium_army_base_attack_masked_gunman_opens_fire/# it has no flair i can see . 
  correction , now i see it , at the opposite side of the screen , a little misleading i think . 
   of course , leftist governments have a huge potential for idiocy just as well . 
   venezuela is my absolute favorite . 
  well , i think that what is happening in venezuela is very similar to what happened in chile , in which the middle and upper class sabotaged the economy to sink a leftist government . 
  note that the nationalisation of copper mines , which started before allende , was not reversed by pinochet . 
   but they are n't catholics , right ? 
   then why is spain so much more liberal ? 
  usually they come from western africa and they speak french or english , languages of their former colonisers , so they go there . 
  then in spain the work situation is not good . 
  simple answer , yes . 
  not directly but who cares . 
  at the opposite side of the mediterranean sea . 
  because killing them is worse ? 
  at present genetic testing is very primitive , and prone to too many errors to be trustable . 
  then it opens a lot of problems in privacy , as your genes are shared with your parents , since there is a substantive part of the population that believe that genes are the exclusive determinant of behaviour , that makes it easy to them to discriminate on this basis . 
  because some bring them along , with not that rare accident that gets the press excited . 
  however if they do not bring them , anti-immigrants go on saying that they 're all men , etc. 
  they do not see it as backwards , look at the usa , the tea party . 
  as a kid in france in the 1960 's , elementary school was separated , a wing for girls the other for boys and playground separated by an over 2 meters high wall , in the small town where i lived , i thought it strange as school should prepare for adult life when men and women live together . 
  and today in spain there are private schools that deal only with boys or girls . 
  it happens that some protest that can not be more extended , and other that this still exists . 
   what i do n't get is why these traditional countries keep their traditional values when they obviously do n't work . 
  because they see it as it is people that do not follow them that sink the country . 
  i read once that in xix century france , the age of marriage was quite over the life expectancy at birth . 
  and that people waited to marry until a baby was on her way . 
   people lost sympathy for those . 
  that nobody has an absolute majority , so any post-electoral coalition is legitimate . 
  if they wanted the paf to be the government they 'd vote it , they did not , they do n't . 
  we are here commenting on that thanks to a hungarian refugee called [ andr\u00e1s gr\u00f3f ] ( http://www.cgdev.org/blog/self-interested-approach-migration-crises ) , now with the name andy grove , co-founder of intel , the corporation that started the microprocessor revolution . 
  wrong , we do not have enough with the vote to say that , what you could say is that the voters did not want any of them to be ** the ** government ** by themselves ** , they may perfectly be fine with them in the government as long as another party can temperate them . 
   stop making them up for your own agendas . 
  because  69.1 % want psd , cds/pp and ps to join up and form government . 
  is your agenda . 
  i only noted that the paf was not the absolute preference , so the rest is free to pact between them . 
  i do not say that people wanted that people wanted that ps and be and pcp were to make a government . 
  that is a possibility open by the law and the fat they have the majority of parliamentarian votes . 
  from what you write , 63 % do not want a coalition of psd & cdspp as their government . 
  casanova is not spanish , but rather italian , or catalan or galician/portuguese , in spanish it would be casanueva . 
   there is no citizen who would want this , only governments and companies who can profit off this . 
  will this law ` overwrite ' any existing laws about net neutrality ? 
  private profits are more important than people rights . 
  and any new law overwrite previous laws if it conflicts with them , unless the old law is of constitutional rank , or like treaties . 
   nairu is a pretty mainstream idea . 
  which does not makes it correct . 
  economics is in a state similar to chemistry in xviii century at the best . 
  basically people that brandish nairu presuppose that inflation is caused by employment , while , at the same time that is , friedman and others clearly say that inflation is a purely monetary phenomenon . 
  one of the two propositions has to be wrong . 
  and as demonstrated in the usa rising employment has not raised inflation . 
  so nairu is not a general statement that is always valid . 
   onventional economic theory says there is something called the natural rate of unemployment . 
   that means a percentage of the population is always unemployed unless you make ` fake ' jobs for them ( as is done to some extent in france and was done in the uk in the 1960s and 70s ) . 
  nairu and the phillips curve are as true as astrology . 
  the jobs are not fake , just they are not profitable to the wealthiest part of the society , so they do what they can to ensure unemployment do not go down , like rising interests rates . 
  a ghetto implies a minority , czechs are the majority . 
   voluntarily lol . 
   the state us the people . 
  you do not get that ? 
  they always want to put a positive spin , else people would not agree to pay twice for the same thing . 
   why are you undermining the role of public regulators ? 
  i fail to understand you . 
  those that undermine the public regulators are not the public , that is us , in case you miss the equivalence , but the providers that want us to pay twice for the same service . 
  we the people ** have paid ** for clean water , if they can not deliver , they must go out of the business . 
  it is not acceptable that they use unclean sources of water , or whatever is the question . 
  if you do not get it , you are to be disregarded as someone that does not understand what is good . 
   but have you tougth about if the state 's claim on them is legitimate ? 
  in case you 've missed it , the state is us the people . 
   but what i was told first-hand is that the isps are pretty pissed that they have to pay for the infrastructure , it 's expansion and stability all alone . 
  ** we ** pay them . 
  full stop . 
  why do you not inculpate the people that want to end the neutrality ? 
  it is done usually in fact . 
  it is in posterior reference that the dead perpetrators are exluded, 
  so they vote for both zeeland and limburg ? 
  what you mention is not net neutrality . 
  net neutrality is when no isp can charge a different price for whatever distinction it makes on the data it transmits or the users it connects , nor which providers are concerned . 
  where will you get the money to pay for that ? 
  because i suppose you know that the uk and other northern countries are always criticizing france for they high level of taxes which is why she manage to have more kids . 
   what representatives ? 
  those to the state parliament . 
  that does not make it not democratic , since when most parliaments vote , the decision is approved by a majority , of which many voters are from zones where you can not vote . 
  people from zeeland do not vote the representatives of friesland , nor of limburg . 
   voted on by people he did n't and could n't vote on . 
  like people of your country , and of course yourself , have not voted romanian government . 
  if he takes one refugee it is like the country were taking 80 millions and you know that , l that 's why i think you are dishonest . 
  so the poor need to use other rules , rules that are not designed to keep them at the bottom . 
   i always prefer primary sources , that is why we do not have free access . 
  it also sends the message that crime is ok `` when we do it '' , and i do n't think that that 's a good thing for anyone . 
  here , i agree . 
   my username is a south park reference , not my moral code . 
  well , what if i think that you used a south park reference to display your moral code in a plausible denial way ? 
  for the rest , maybe i 'm wrong . 
  i still do n't trust . 
   do you know who you sound like , haha !, 
  / u/martinalexander ? 
  in case you have not noticed he used your arguments on german population . 
  if you think it does not fit in this case , it does not fit in the other . 
  then i assume you lie . 
  and now that i look at your username , moreso .
