  the eu surrounds switzerland , the uk is an island on the atlantic . 
  you can do any question , no question about that , but the fact you have to do this one question is suggestive . 
  why do you not think of amazon ? 
  they are a much bigger threat to bookstores everywhere in the world , not just in a neighborough . 
  how old are you ? 
  if more than 12 you must have lived a very cushioned life . 
  no , it is only that you are too dumb to keep the gains . 
  and many of your `` losses '' are only in your fevered imagination . 
  said from a country that in the recent past , until you entered , was the main receptor . 
   but for some reason people here actively fight against increasing salaries . 
  it 's like not being hungry and having a place to live makes us content with our low salaries . 
  higher salaries would be communism . 
  well , that is what those that say english should be the main language of the eu will achieve . 
  also those that insist on free trade as an absolute will made irrelevant cultural products based on european values and erase the local cultures . 
  the uk is not a founding member of the treaty of rome , in fact , the more i see their policies towards the eu the more i think they try to destroy it from the inside to turn it into efta 2.0 . 
  if we wanted efta we would not have made the eu . 
   do we ban mein kampf ? 
  fact is , yes . 
  not in a full taboo way , but in some countries its publication is very curtailed . 
  still if you 're an historian you will have no problem to study it . 
   he is saying that different cultures will lead to different levels of criminality in the first place . 
  like eastern europeans are more homicidal than western europeans . 
  given the irreversibility and terminal nature of death , it seems only prudent to ensure no eastern european comes to the west . 
   somebody borrowed it from somebody . 
  their common ancestors . 
  just like ego . 
  from the [ reddiquette ] ( https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette ) :  search for duplicates before posting . 
  redundancy posts add nothing new to previous conversations . 
  that said , sometimes bad timing , a bad title , or just plain bad luck can cause an interesting story to fail to get noticed . 
  feel free to post something again if you feel that the earlier posting did n't get the attention it deserved and you think you can do better . 
  the last sentence is when repost applies . 
  that 's not the real story . 
  in one instance , there was one parent , or more but i do n't know that , that got arrested for going after someone he thought was abusing his daughter . 
  but most parents did never appear unless summoned by the police . 
   where the hell are the parents ? 
  absent . 
  do you think that having offsprings imparts wiseness ? 
   the best thing for assad is to let him stay in hopes of him going the way of general franco . 
  you see , it happens that 's what i expected when assad father died . 
  that since assad was the heir by accident , the death in a car crash of his brother propped him as successor , he would not have a major interest in ruling and open the door to a more democratic regime . 
  guess what happened then ... 
  as far as i 'm concerned , the only bad spending by governments are those that go to wealthy people . 
  now of course some spending are better to enhance the life of people , but that is not always as evident when deciding on which are such . 
  when i see your username , i always think oswald mosley . 
  i might be wrong . 
  however when i read your commentaries , i think that oswald mosley could write most of them without being out of character . 
   just as a way to tax a few wealthy centers ? 
  you mean to tax oligopolists ? 
  because it is stupid and ignorant ? 
   someone saying they are using migrants as a weapon , it makes sense too . 
  especially for right-winger that want to make it difficult , if not impossible , for refugees to be accepted . 
  why enter in such a risky way when you can `` fly emirates '' first class ? 
  or qatar airways , or lufthansa ? 
  they can enter with tourist visas , or for business purposes . 
  they have the money for that . 
   remembering that we need farmland to feed ourselves , we produce more than enough to feed us . 
  and we can import on the cheap from many regions from outside europe . 
  do you remember that we throw to the garbage more than a 10 % of what we consume ? 
   that being said , many african governments have hardly had policies conducive to growth and prosperity . 
  as soon as some were competent to do so , there was a coup against them . 
  or a few members of the ruling party were bought . 
    is finnish rape law like swedens ? 
  if yes , it 's very different from german law . 
  the same offense might not register as such , which would make for different statistics . 
   those are african/middle eastern men in finland , not a comparison between different nations . 
  it is a comparison between ** laws ** . 
  from your link :  immigration and crime refers to ** perceived ** or actual relationships between crime and immigration . 
  now , do you know what does have a relation with crime ? 
  age , and sex . 
  men from 18 to 24 are the most criminal of people . 
  then they usually are the most creative . 
  that he enjoys that good people are paying a tax he gets not to pay . 
  your faith in free trade is what mystify me . 
  trade is one thing , free trade is a different beast . 
  but that is another discussion . 
  edit : ps , and you do not seems dogmatic . 
  saying  leftist dogma is no longer sacrosanct here , to / u/savannajeff seems very misplaced to me . 
  makes me think you are of that right that does not like to be named . 
    1 ) the merit of doing or not doing something is irrelevant with how well you can get away with it . 
   well that 's obviously horseshit in a competitive environment . 
  is the same as saying ** you ** are a corrupt individual . 
   omg , do people really deep down believe shit like that ? 
  you ca n't really be that daft ? 
  of course he can be that daft , and worse . 
  he 's a human . 
   brits in spain are either retirees or have jobs a lot of britons in spain come as tourists and start working in irregular ways , in the black economy . 
  to me it was a surprise to learn that there were nazi parties in poland and other slavic countries , it seemed over the top . 
  i was wrong . 
  you need to learn arithmetic again . 
  jews were almost exterminated by europeans not so long ago , and criticism of israel is reduced because of that . 
   looking simply on investment data and import/export show you that uk has very limited impact on poland or czech rep compared to germany or france . 
  is not what i 'm talking about . 
  i mean politics , how to define rights of workers and capital , the rules of society , how the eu should develop , etc. 
  why not ? 
  they act on their immediate interests , it happens in other countries , like france . 
  simply read this / r/europe . 
  there are some few in-between nice posters from poland , otherwise they 're just mouthpieces for nazi ideas that should have been confined to archives of evil . 
  that is a political union not a free trade area , but a big fraction of the population , usually those that managed to appropriate the most of the economical resources , align with the uk ruling class . 
  nothing surprising at all , the war in former yugoslavia ended quite a few years ago , so things are relatively calm there . 
  conflicts like in somalia , iraq , afghanistan are ongoing , so it is rather strange to think about people returning there .
