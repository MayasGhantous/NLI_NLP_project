  you are so dumb as to deserve compassion rather than hate , how can a human being be so utterly unable to think by itself , i suspect i will never fathom . 
   they 're complicit why ? 
  because some right wing traitors collaborate with the usa ? 
  they do not have the money to make the housing cost rise . 
  in my flair you 'll see majorca , and there prices went up not because of migrats but germans that could pay absurd prices . 
  you could go in a small uncommunicated village and see `` zu verkauf '' panels , not `` for sale '' ( international english ) , not `` en venta '' ( official spanish ) neither `` en venda '' ( in the local language ) . 
  germans are some 20 % % of immigrant to majorca , still they were the ones setting the prices . 
  it should be to represent people that depend on their labour to get forward . 
  allowing the wealthy to get away tax-free with their spoils from abusing workers , on the contrary , should not be their aim . 
   inflated housing costs are produced by wealthy people that speculate on the value of housing , not by true immigrants . 
  even in the west political activity is mostly done by men , so men tend to be the ones more prosecuted . 
   chances are no merit in that , much less from the offspring . 
   how you are raised by your parents along the standards and morals they impart on your is far more than `` luck '' yet it is pure luck , you did not get to chose who are your parents . 
   nature is also not a static thing , but you would try to preserve it , right ? 
  unless you can claim to have elucidated every nooks and crannies of nature , you 'd rather preserve it as much as possible or risk going extinct . 
  culture changes a lot faster , and things like nationalism have only a couple centuries of existence , and have been rather damaging to most people . 
  like / u/redandblackbackpack had anything better fundamented , but you did not question his sources ... that says a lot about you . 
   show me where danes , norwegians , estonians and finns have ever rioted like this in your country . 
  why would they do so ? 
  afaict , in sweden they are not discriminated in relevant ways that requires group protests . 
   here we have so high taxes even the native population cant really afford to live alone . 
  what are your taxes ? 
  in which way are they higher than any other developed country that cares of its population ? 
  as for the rest of your post , i find only expressions of utter egoism , so afaict i 'd be better if people like you did not exist . 
  not my perception , they paid the banks with the money of greece ... in a sense . 
  yes , i know it is more complicated than that , but that is nearer to reality . 
   and your last part is absurd ; by definition the spaniards that left are not the spaniards who stay . 
  they profited from the emigration . 
  the fact they no longer required the local resources freed these for the remaining population . 
  a simple example , your father and his brother have as only resource a farm they inherited , but it is too small to be profitable , if enough to live , for the two of them , now if one goes away , the other has much more for himself . 
   why do keynesian theorists always forget the bit about saving money when times are good ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  a - in good times they forget to save . 
  b - they save money while still in bad times c - something else i can not fathom at the moment . 
  btw , are you sure the people you think are keynesians ? 
   people should not be allowed to willy-nilly cross the borders as they wish , crossing the entire fricking continent . 
  like in su ? 
  and maybe russia now , i 'm not up to date about that . 
  of course it was closed for racist motives , just as killing jews by nazis was racist in spite of the fact they were and are of the same race . 
  an individual would be condemned because of a jewish grand parent . 
   our intelligence agency the aivd even released a rapport 2 years ago about right wing extremism calling the risk they carry negligible . 
  since such agencies tend to be staffed by rather right wing people , i would not take such claims as true . 
   they republican party is owned by aipac . 
  in a strange twist , most usa jews vote for the democratic party . 
  it is not wasted if it would not have been eaten , as a lot of food in europe . 
  probably it brings more profits to the producers than trying to sell them as food . 
  the theme is trade ** surplus ** , and the fact that you can have a budget surplus without trade surplus is not that relevant here . 
  normally a government is not much interested in a budget surplus , as that means either `` excessive '' taxes , or not enough spending . 
  the champion of free trade in the eu is the uk . 
  freedom everywhere they claim , unless it is good for poor people . 
  i would think that is what / u/ispq wrote . 
  my reading of your posts :   catholics and irishmen need not apply . 
    originally no catholics , but those sneaky irishmen had some protestants as well , as you had to be clear about no irishmen . 
  learn more about history is that you believe it was false . 
  first we are taking about trade ** surplus ** , that is what the country sells over what it buys , so tariffs do n't matter here , they 'd matter with trade deficit , as the imports would pay them . 
  then vat is about internal trade activity , no matter the origin of the traded goods . 
  exports means the producers get more profits , so they pay taxes . 
  there are jobs , and the workers pay taxes too . 
  there is less unemployment , so less expenses for the state , etc. 
  funny that competition and free market is not nice when on the losing side ... 
  would it be possible without it ? 
  because nina was never a thing . 
  `` no irish need apply '' in case you were not aware . 
   and america closed the border to improve integration whereas suggesting limiting immigration now is racist !, 
  is a lie , they closed because they were racists , else there would be no need to improve integration , as the immigrants were essentially the same as the majority of locals . 
  are you aware that many did return when they had made a fortune ? 
  bringing capital with them . 
  so the fact that those who emigrated released local resources is not important ? 
  to make a simple example , two brother inherit a farm , for two it does not produce enough to live , but for one , the one who does not emigrate , it is a money maker . 
   we also have a very high unemployment rate currently sweden ... sweden is slightly under the eu average . 
  high is what we have in spain , or greece and portugal . 
   tribal societies funny , tribal societies is what northern european populations look to me . 
  that does n't mean she is resisting assimilation . 
  some people might find hard speaking a new language no matter what . 
  read that : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greenwood,_tulsa#.22the_black_wall_street.22 an excerpt : race , greed , and jim crow laws played a major role in how african americans were treated because ** whites tried to stop african americans from successfully rebuilding after the riot . 
  ** whites tried to tell african americans who they could sell their goods to and where they can purchase them , so their business would experience more success . 
  since oil was booming during this time , whites wanted all control of the profits from each and every business in greenwood . 
  the thought of african americans putting whites out of business put fear in each white business owner 's mind because then they may have felt equal . 
  `` the power to undo sin : race , history and literacy blackness in rilla askew 's `` fire in beulah . '' college literature ; spring2007 , vol . 
  34 issue 4 , p166-189 , 24p ), 
  many would have been killed by those that were less propense to emigrate . 
   escaping from protectionism to capitalism . 
  at the time europe was no more protectionist than the usa . 
  no , that was ** not ** the purpose of ww ii . 
  it does n't say how many people of each group are there in total , their age and for how long they 've been in the country . 
  doubtful , the french gold was not backing the dollar but maybe the franc . 
  the only gold that could back the usa dollar was public owned gold . 
  otherwise it would be like me taking a mortgage with your house as a guarantee . 
  trust me , i will pay the mortgage back !, 
   they want to scare people . 
  and they scare people that might want to invest there . 
  frankly , i doubt many people want to immigrate to heidenau , it seem a bad place to be . 
  i would not want people like those in the picture as my neighbours . 
  where i live that kind of people are seen as hardened criminals . 
  i looked back at what i was answering and my answers , you do not address that . 
   anyway , does n't mexico have some of the harshest immigration laws in the world ? 
  why should we make it easier for mexicans to come here ? 
  because of a very bad experience with anglo-american immigrants in texas , that caused the loss of one third of its territory , from texas to california . 
   high skilled immigration i do n't see how they could make the place worse . 
  by making it unnecessary for the wealthy class to contribute to the education of the less affluent , why pay for the university of workers when you can import a full fledged doctor , engineer , or what-not ?
