  that 's why , i believe , you can find people that write like in [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ca4pn/erasmus_has_sown_seeds_of_a_truly_european/cstqovv ) because in their country unless you 're '' ** cosseted middle class students ** '' you 're not going to university . 
  there is no prize if you guess right the flair of the commentator i link . 
   lowering wages for natives ? 
  is more efficiently done by direct importation of goods from the countries the immigrants come , but then it is `` free trade '' and profits first and foremost the wealthy , so it is ok . 
    have you been on the receiving end of discrimination by a established group ? 
   yes , mostly radical left ideologues who accuse anyone critical of immigration policies of being a racist neo-nazi . 
  that 's not what i mean . 
  are you a pakistani in the uk ? 
  a woman in arabia saudi ? 
  a catholic irishman in northern ireland ? 
    do you know that none of them know some girl of their age that has been assaulted by `` pure britons '' ? 
  just reading this subreddit since the disappearance of the immigration megathread is to despair of human beings . 
   i have no idea where you 're going with this , nor where you 're coming from . 
  the girls that will be more susceptible to such propaganda are those that have experienced , directly or in their immediacy , that the people that claim to be the owner of the land are not willing to treat them fairly , ever . 
  i do no longer expect that , there is no reason for it . 
  this eu is not the eu i admired as a kid , end of the 1960s , and to which i wanted to adhere as an adult , early 1980s . 
  i wanted the ever closer union , not the money of a free trade area . 
   the internet is n't that old , but of course it 's a two edged sword if you stick to fringe communities . 
  to present day teenagers it has been there from the start . 
   how it is influenced by education and access to information in a modern society vs hard wired human tendencies .

   joining a genocidal islamic terrorist group . 
  joining a neo-nazi group ? 
  yes , that too is extremely despicable . 
  not worth my time . 
   join terrorist militias accross the world to slaughter innocents . 
  that is your claim , it is not justified , they would not necessarily go to kill , and they might be convinced those that are killed are in fact guilty . 
  no different from your idea that they should be treated like hardened criminals . 
  then , you see , usa soldiers attacking iraq in 2003 had no justification to do so , they went on false pretense there , killed hundred thousands people or more , and created a devastated land that now is a chaos fertile for groups like isis . 
  note also that going from uk to syria is not that much of a travel in modern world if you can move freely . 
  at worse the girls that would fall for that are like girls that fall for neo-nazi groups . 
   not in self-identification . 
  maybe they had too many interactions with other britons that were adamant girls like them were not british and would never be accepted as britons . 
  that is my perception . 
  if your perception is different , like daltonism , probably i will never be able to convey it . 
  when you close your socialism to your group , then you start to be nazi . 
   you 're interested in nothing but your own views and opinion . 
  i could be british , then . 
  what / u/mistahanghigh puts is conform to what i remember . 
   you realise that especially the refugees from syria are often middle class families that simply booked a hotel in turkey before taking a boat ? 
  and you do understand that now they 're out of a job ? 
  and do not know when they 'll get another and how much they 'll get then ? 
    propaganda  grab a history book . 
  which can be propaganda . 
    because the uk ruling class want things that are bad to me ? 
   the uk ruling class ' job is to look out for its population , not you . 
  then why do you ask why i do not like them ? 
  oh , and you 're pretty deluded to think they care about all of the people of the uk . 
  they care only of themselves . 
  edit for format . 
   they share a culture with those people . 
  like you share one with us , not !, 
  worse , to you dictatorship is irrelevant , why would i trust you ? 
  leftist ? 
  nazi , probably . 
   nothing ? 
  certainly not . 
   he saw the uk as a threat to france 's domination in the eu and did n't like the uk having a close relationship with the us . 
  germany was bigger than france from the start , italy almost equal . 
  and of course he understood that the usa were a threat to european independence , whether it matters or not i point to the uk that is always wanting to reduce the eu to the efta . 
   this is fairly common knowledge . 
  or propaganda . 
   how come most of your posts here are complaining about the uk ? 
  because the uk ruling class want things that are bad to me ? 
  there are people from the uk outside the uk . 
  and people in the uk do things that affect people outside of it , like the libor manipulation . 
  i thought you had some post that seemed to come from a human , i was wrong . 
  you believe . 
  but that is irrelevant , it is ** me ** who do not believe you . 
  afaict everything you say must be considered a lie . 
  it would not be wise to do otherwise . 
  did the uk always remain within its borders ? 
   so you must consider given how immutable the brain is in many ways is , just how much genes control things like aggression and realize that unfortunately it may be that these people are so aggressive because of their genes . 
  so northern europeans should not be allowed to roam freely the planet , as they have demonstrated an extreme tendency to plunder and murder as soon as they believe they can get away . 
  i remember a magazine of historical divulgation that had on the front cover reference to novelties about viking culture , so i bought it to find which were these . 
  in the starting paragraph it said , from memory and my translation :  you see , the vikings had a culture , when they could not plunder they traded . 
  i thought that was such a dim statement that it would be a bad translation , no longer . 
   potentially different type of machine into the continent that is not compatible to ours . 
  is such a dumb thing to say . 
  obama is no fool . 
  you misunderstand , not perfect in the modern mathematical sense , but as it was perceived millennia ago . 
  the eu choose it because of this implicit perfection ( and the council of europe before it , and those that associated the twelve stars to the virgin mary ), 
  i do not believe you . 
  in a sense that means that neandertals survive in us , note that the neandertal dna we have is not necessarily the same in every european , so the total neandertal dna preserved would be some 20 % . 
  no , you 're not the only one , but europe is basically a bunch of more or less contiguous territories not a shared set of moral values . 
  much less of humanitarian moral values . 
  it has meaning , it is a magic number , or a perfect number , that had many positive connotations in the past . 
  and the convenience to be divisible by 2 , 3 , 4 and 6 in exact form , the traditional british measures use it a lot . 
  in a sense it expresses the perfection of the eu . 
  many britons have scandinavian ancestors , and from other parts too . 
   ireland was a colony . 
  millions of irish were starved to death under british rule . 
  not the best one can do , especially when they took out of ireland more than enough food to feed the dying irish . 
  let me specify that 100 % european does not means that you had no non european ancestor , just that 100 % of the tested dna is found in europeans . 
   nations are an unbroken chain of blood and heritage passed down through the generations is a meaningless sentence since you could use alternate borders and that would still be true . 
  de gaulle did not want the uk inside the predecessor of the eu . 
  he seems to me that he was prescient , i wonder what he saw when he was in the uk during wwii that made him to think in this way . 
  he had less of a problem to pact with the germans against whom he had fought .
