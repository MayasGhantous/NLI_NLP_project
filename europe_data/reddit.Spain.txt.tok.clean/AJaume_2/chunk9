  german gdp is estimated at $ 3.413 trillion for 2015 . 
  using a 1.1388 $ for 1 $ exchange , these 10 billions are 0.3182 % of german gdp . 
  that is cherry picking . 
  that you do not get it is simply the proof that if you study you 'll get the necessary knowledge . 
  or catholics , well in this case almost as there is still some residual anti-catholicism in the uk . 
  the good products are exported . 
  it is not bribing , chocolate makes people feel better , and t the children that have been in all the turmoil they been , it is worth it . 
  it is disgusting to see how good life has distorted your humanity . 
   cowards and suicide bombers in disguise do you understand that what you say is self-contradictory ? 
  a group of armed croats that murder an old serbian woman , now that is coward . 
  serbia . 
   they were able to pay thousands to their traffickers . 
  and no longer have money . 
  or whatever they have they 'll need soon . 
  what a vile individual you are . 
  to do statistics you need good sample , that is unbiased . 
  these links are biased . 
  the relation between horoscopes and stocks to buy or sell is random , you have an equal possibility to do it right . 
  it comes from the people that created all the problems of the euro . 
   it 's not my problem . 
  these people are immigrants in my country , not refugees . 
  and yes , immigration works , what does not work are people that are anti-immigrants . 
  germans killed millions of people because of their religion , the religion of their parents , or the religion of one grand parent . 
  millions . 
  that too is cherry picking . 
  would the uk do that ? 
  never . 
   none of that makes any sense and most of it does n't even seem to be true that never mattered . 
   i would ~ ~ think ~ ~ hope that everyone thinks that their nation is the greatest in history and then people like you go claiming that isis is bad . 
  selective quoting again . 
  because it fits their prejudices . 
  were they named john wilson , derek caine and paul raymond , nobody would care . 
  do you pick which stocks to buy or sell based on your horoscope ? 
  that would be more reasonable than trusting those links . 
  +1 fine with that . 
  i was uncertain of what you meant . 
   ikea can we agree that ikea is an abomination ? 
   my feelings come after reading the data , not before . 
  these * data * are not such . 
  they are propaganda that use the foibles of the human mind to get wit-free people to agree to their intentions . 
  they are worse than a horoscope to know what stock to pick . 
  oh , but you believe in astrology ? 
  i was not speaking about rotterham , but the rape in romania mentioned by / u/ganymede07011610 . 
  the systemacity in rotterham is specific of british society and the way that society handled a criminal activity . 
  did the uk keep their culture and way of life within uk borders ? 
  they are always saying that their way is the best for us , that we should adopt their vision of the world , their language , their laws , their music , etc. 
  if the social security has you on file as having paid the due amount , you can bet it is paid , now in your country that be different . 
  what did you think are qualifications ? 
  edit : s / as you on file / has you on file /, 
   no , i was referring to the raping / abuse of young girls by middle-eastern men . 
  is that more systematic than when done by other people ? 
  in [ poland a 15 years old boy raped an old woman in a church ] ( http://www.thenews.pl/1/9/artykul/217735,teen-arrested-over-church-rape ) . 
  they 're nice kids there , so much for going to church . 
  did the uk do that ? 
   by only reporting fact ? 
  unless you can , and do , report all of the fact [ s ] , reporting facts is partial . 
  biased sample in statistical terms . 
  i live in spain , get lost , you liar . 
  opinions on the valor of numbers is quite relative , i 've seen people writing that greece deficit were excessive , when the difference was a few percents , i gather they did so because that because they could justify oppressing the greeks , now that book does not give numbers , how do you know they were not down to subnormality levels in standardized tests ? 
  and that book is not my source and it qualitatively agree with my memories ( i read it in 1976 ) . 
  so no bias , in the sense of saying falsities deliberately . 
   their countries are violent , poor , lawless shitholes unless they happen to have oil in their territory . 
  you got it wrong . 
  nigeria has oil and is in rather bad shape . 
   germany has a great society , a great culture of hard work and scientific progress . 
  they 've contributed more to human progress than most other societies in human history . 
  oh , yes , aryan physics , great contribution . 
  and they enhanced fascism to be racist , and invaded their neighbours killing millions . 
  definitely not impressed . 
   we have a major attack only once in a while ... so to keep the public afraid . 
  it is a joke , as it is more probable they rather spend resources on civil rights activists , the real menace to their bosses . 
  +1 for once . 
  and in my country they do not get welfare unless they qualify , like everybody else . 
  anyways , that would not be abusing . 
  it works quite well . 
  it is still not as good as in other countries , like france , but it helps enough to fend off a revolution . 
   immigrants are abusing the welfare systems of the countries they live in . 
  is bullshit . 
  the statistics have been published once and again , and they uniformly show that this is false . 
  but anti-immigrants never listen , never learn . 
  they do not care . 
  well , if being of a different christian sect makes it hard to integrate in the usa , not being one makes it worse in europe , so since it is only recently that immigrants are here in quantities over 1 % , i do not find that there is a failure of integration , simply it is to soon . 
   are no longer nazis is something i do not believe , i 've no reason to think they are less nazi than then , not that then all were nazi . 
  as for the rest , it is basically tongue-in-cheek , but where i 'm now , majorca , people do not find germans to integrate very well . 
  btw i have german family , first degree once removed cousins . 
  land route to northern europe . 
  going with your boyfriend into an adventure . 
  and she did not join isis . 
  then why are we not marginalizing germans as non assimilable ? 
  given how little different were the irish from the general population , that they needed generations to integrate , says that given the greater difference and the recentness of muslim immigration , it is too soon to claim failure in europe . 
   iq tests were started , they applied them to immigrants from europe , eastern european jews https://books.google.es/books?id=2fx6pzonscic&amp;pg=pa181&amp;lpg=pa181&amp;dq=iq+tests+were+started,+they+applied+them+to+immigrants+from+europe,+eastern+european+jews&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ce4qphjopj&amp;sig=9oxmwmot9z6nc3aecbs0gdmlb_u&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cd4q6aewbgovchmiwijn9o28xwivc1wach309qsc#v=onepage&amp;q=iq%20tests%20were%20started%2c%20they%20applied%20them%20to%20immigrants%20from%20europe%2c%20eastern%20european%20jews&amp;f=false note that this was not my source , as i read it some 40 years ago . 
   the eu decide for us . 
  that means what in this context ? 
  are you not part of the eu ? 
  well , entering the euro has proven to be bad for common people , even if good for the people at the top . 
  why would it be different ? 
  they do not need to corrupt everyone , some will already be corrupt to be sure , only enough to pass . 
  once bitten twice shy . 
  you have strange concepts . 
  it has been more damaging that germany tried to take over europe less than a century ago .
