  if they are so blatantly propagandistic why would there be a need to ban them ? 
  it 's not like media of western countries is much better anyway ; a pro-russian bias is not worse than a pro-western bias when countries like the us violate human rights just as much , if not worse . 
  this sub is joke . 
  interesting , i simply repeated what i read from the wiki article on the conquest of england by william , i would love to see more indepth sources about this . 
  my understanding is that such events happened only after the normans were already in full control of england , when john , king of england and duke of normandy joined the papal call to attack france along with the holy roman empire and a bunch of others . 
  not only that , the normans settled in france on friendly terms in exchange for norman defence against raids from other vikings . 
  the normans quickly adopted the religion , language and names from the region . 
  i just read the whole wikipedia article in class today , lol . 
  if a private firm is payed by media that expects certain results it is also more likely to be biased , either by accomodating to the buyer 's needs or by not surviving being neutral . 
  i agree , since the fall of the soviet union the hegemonic ideology has been that since capitalism trumps communism , more capitalism , more capital accumulation and less regulation is best . 
  i 'm scared of how things are turning up in europe and i 've stopped posting anything left wing in social media related to me for a while now , just in case . 
  why do you consider it as bad as franco 's dictatorship ? 
  also , a third republic would , in any case , be very different from the second given that the material conditions have changed drastically . 
  even though i 'm a modern communist , i 'm happy to envision a third republic simply as a country were the political and economic elites were separated through a very strict and multi-layered system of checking coupled with stronger laws against corruption while also nationalizing basic services ( including finance services ) . 
  the material conditions during the second republic were very different fron what they are now so it is irrational to be scared of a third republic based on being scared of the second one ( assuming there are reasons to be actually so scared of it ) . 
  of course they had support from the population but i find the idea of peasents supporting the rebellion for any reason other than being reactionaries scared of the attacks of leftists to churches very unlikely . 
  i 'll stand by the idea of the ones responsible for the rebellion being economic elites with the reactionary population simply following them but being uncapable or unwilling of rebelling themselves otherwise . 
  `` i support stalin but i think it was not perfect '' how upset would polish people be if i said that now there ? 
  do you understand how polish people being so right-wing is just a reaction to its historical past due to the national polish being stereotypically right-wing ? 
  why would you support franco , who was a national-catholic , not a fascist , otherwise ? 
  a few days ago i was threatened with a ban for making the `` baby-eating communist '' joke at some guy arguing that marx and everything that followed was some kind of evil movement disrupting the peace and good of the world . 
  the mod even made a comment explaining that it was due to `` low quality circle-jerk '' , which is funny because my comment is what it is usually permitted here as a ** joke ** . 
  the mod assured me that his actions had no politicam motive but i would n't be surprised if i 'm banned after this . 
  nobody here seems to be menctioning the most * crucial * factor that sparked the rebellion , which was a very profound reform in the organization of the rural societies where * se\u00f1oritos * ( pseudofeudal lords which owned latifundios ) would lose its almost medieval position of power . 
  in a country where the burgeoise class had still not developed completely , those rural lords were the strongest social group at the time and were disposed to destroy the democratic republic to maintain the status quo . 
  i feel so frustrated when people talk about the spanish civil war as a war between two evils as if it were n't a war pushed by military and economic elites towards a democratic government that was finally ending centuries of a barely feudal political organization . 
  if you want to know more about who * se\u00f1oritos * were i recommend the film los santos inocentes ( the innocent saints ) or the novel of the same name by miguel delibes . 
  this was so fucking sad for me , too . 
  i can imagine * la pasionaria * holding madrid with her * no pasar\u00e1n * in her heroic stance . 
  i can only wonder what would have happened if franco did n't recieve direct help and arms from hitler and mussolini or if the republicans were not betrayed by the soviet union . 
   and i see stiglitz saying nonsense . 
   granted , i 'm not a nobel prize winner , but so far his predictions are wrong and mine are right . 
  i was not arguing against a particulartly complex argument , though . 
  i agree with you in that what i said is not a valid argument , but i think it is easily visible that the social unrest in increasing to dangerous levels all across the eu . 
  fiscal integration would probably bring more problems due to the disparities in the economies between different european regions . 
  the problem is that devaluating the euro would have prevented the austerity catastrophe in southern countries while negatively affecting other countries like germany in their import and export prices . 
  as germany ( and sarkozy 's france at the time ) were preoccupied with their internal affairs than with the future of the eu , instead of reducing the consumer power of its citizens for a period of time , they chose to force austerity policies in southern countries which further exacerbated their financial situation while also deepening the economic crises by reducing flow of money to its citizens . 
  this was also done as the media in places like germany pushed the narrative of southern countries deserving to be punished ( not the banks , not the speculators , the working people ) and it was percieved as a punishment in the recieving countries , too . 
  since those reforms have n't actually improved the situation for the average person and instead , additional reforms are continuously implemented in what is percieved as an escape forward , many people in the south have been growing resentful of the eu . 
  left parties have also gained a lot of power and are also against this percieved despise and humilliation from northern to southern europe ( we wo n't ever forget the term piigs to refer to those countries ) . 
  while i was always in favour of a strong and independent eu guided by ideals and principles of human rights , i am now in favour of the desintegration of the eu unless a very radical change is done . 
  the accumulation of capital and growth of inequality ( the number of millionaires have doubled in spain since 2008 and the benefits of big corporations have skyrocketed ) have also fueled this perception of the eu being a fundamentally complicent organization of the capital against the people . 
  in northern countries where the leftist narrative ca n't expand , the growing social discomtept has been directed towards inmigrants and refugees , as it is usual when people are eager to listed to mass media deriving the attention from the ever increasing inequality and negotiating power of the richest to inmigrants . 
  in any case , i could rant about this for hours but i have to eat . 
  he probably has more knowledge and expertise that you , so i trust his predictions better . 
  most intellectuals agree that if europe continues this path of austerity that benefits northern economies while asphixiating the south , the division will eventually explode . 
  that is not to say the eu ca n't change its ways to revert this , but the problems originated by de facto increasing capital accumulation during recession instead of implementing expansive policies will not go away easily . 
  is there any reason for your tone ? 
  the `` i can ban you any time i wish '' does n't sound like something a proper moderator would do . 
  in any case , as to abide to the rules of the sub , i 'll start reporting such comments when i encounter them . 
  alright then , i guess this settles this conversation with memorials for the victims of spanish imperialism being built in spain being wrong as it is stated in the unwritten rule you menction . 
  is that your point ? 
  are you serious ? 
  one joke among half a dozen serious comments and i 'm threatened with a ban ? 
  can you explain how is this partial when comments of this kind are common and accepted in this sub ? 
  i 'm getting the impression that my comment was targeted by political reasons . 
  alright then , why not statues of hitler in berlin ? 
  why not monumentalize the genocidal , fascist leader ? 
  franco was also a genocidal , fascist leader who started a civil war against a democrally elected government when they tried to abolist the barely feudalist political organization in rural spain of the `` se\u00f1oritos '' . 
  why should we monumentalize such a person ? 
  do you realize that we are talking about the victims of spanish imperialism ? 
  there are hiroshima memorials in japan , 9/11 in the us and holocaust ones in germany so i think it is not crazy to dedicate monuments to the victims of spanish imperialism in spain . 
  slow down . 
  nobody here said anything about white shaming and such thing does n't even exist in spain . 
  that narrative has nothing to do with this . 
  this is about honoring the victims of imperialism . 
  that does not mean that we are demonizing spaniards . 
  it is possible to acknowledge the fact that european imperialism is not a matter of badness and that any civilization with the capacity would have done the same , to acknowledge the many benefits that europeans brought to the world , while also acknowledging the cruel horror that was experienced by the victims of imperialism . 
  see , this is a problem i encounter with the general population and especially right wing people : you assume the world is divided into team a vs team b. 
  if i am in favour of honoring the victims of imperialism , i am a white shamer . 
  if i am against capitalism and in favour of communism , i am in favour of authoritarian regimes . 
  it is very frustrating to discuss anything with people like that as they end up fighting the strawmen they create instead of actually communicating . 
  this thread is a magnificent example of that . 
  then we should place a few statues of hitler across london , too . 
  he was very relevant to british history , after all . 
  just make sure to say the dude is an asshole somewhere around . 
  why is it wrong to mourn thr victims of the holocaust or hiroshima but not of the genocide and enslavent that the spanish performed in america ? 
  in argentina , the conditions in the silver mines were so bad that the life expentancy of workers there was counted in months and it was n't until the enforcement of the `` new laws '' that indigenous people were considered human beings . 
   columbus did heinious acts that were considered atrocious even for his time . 
  is he really the man we want as a symbol in the city of barcelona ? 
  you :  you marxists are supporting north korea and stalin and want to destroy european culture marx was literally hitler i hold the truth about history you know nothing hahahow stupid and ridiculous you totally proved your point , defending the glorification of a person whose acts were reprimended even in his time by attacking some strawmen you created about north korea lovers . 
  you do n't even make an effort to understand what other opinions have to offer , you dismiss them with laughable falacies . 
  what ? 
  they limit the money takeout when that happens massively because banks ** do n't have ** the money you deposit there . 
  your savings have interests because they are used by the banks to give loans . 
  if the bank gives shitty loans that are not payed back then your savings are literally lost . 
  that is why banks needed mindblowing cash injections after the 2008 financial crisis . 
  they had invested in greedy , risky loans with ** your money ** and when they lost it they literally forced the governments to give them ** hundreds of billions ** of ** your tax money ** to avoid a political crisis when people would not be able to access their savings and have all their fucking money lost . 
  i thought this was common knowledge here after the 2008 crisis !, 
  how are you the most upvoted comment ? 
  in what reality do you live ? 
  so we have forgotten about the maidan protests , the odessa massacre , the call for an ethnic cleanse of russians in ukraine , the incendiary snipers , the `` fuck europe '' and the only thing that remains is the `` russia invaded ukraine '' ? 
  so this is actual history in the making , huh . 
  how is it not true that the ussr was the central power fighting germany ? 
  they did liberate europe from the fascists . 
  you probably meant thirthy times our population . 
  the new mayor of barcelona , ada colau , from podemos , is trying to give rebirth to the industrial sector as to not be so dependent on turism . 
  she has also done an excelent job of cutting out on fraudulent and inefficient city contracts , reducing the deficit of the city substantially . 
  since podemos also wants to invest in r&d , it is likely that there are plans or projects to attract tech business already . 
  not the russian ones ,
