  maybe spain would encompass all three parts , and only spanish would be spoken integrally . 
  what happened ? 
  the origins of the eastern block of spain were in the frankish empire , the castillians and portuguese , were the remnants of the visigothic kingdom before al-andalus . 
  the two parts evolved into kingdoms until castille and aragon merged * as equals * , and later felipe ii gained portugal . 
  had felipe established the capital in lisboa the world would be very different , but he was a timid and somewhat reclusive man , intelligent and efficient as he could be . 
  he remained in castille . 
  the actions of a few , in this sense , shape the world for centuries , and history is the opposite of inevitable . 
  to claim historical reasons to gain an objective is to legitimize a dice roll . 
  what did the elite in madrid for centuries wrong and what differentiated it from paris ? 
  in this sense , the objective of cultural agglutination of both states have been very similar . 
  we could delve in the cultural way of acting of each culture , specially the elites , but imho we 're getting too anthropological here . 
  the thing is the castille considered lost portugal to soon , maybe because it had not sufficient influence to seize it , maybe because the roughness of both spanish climate and geography has always resulted in more local or regional singularities , added up to the supposed proud spanish character , which does n't help things . 
  it did keep galicia quieted down , at least , but to cost of extreme poverty and marginalization whereas in an alternate universe it could be much more stronger . 
  it did succeed completely in eradicating any remnant of moorish culture . 
  with aragon , castille began its centralization process but did not finish it . 
  and with this cultural evolution , this ` end of history ' of the last century , time is up . 
  you did not your homework . 
  catalonia rebounced . 
  how ? 
  the asturiano , the leones , the aragones , the navarro , all of them were ( are ) ( nearly ) extinct languages that were victims of this centralization process . 
  but aragon is so big . 
  and when aragon i mean aragon itself + valencia + catalonia + baleares . 
  the line of castillian colonization stopped near the catalan border , and the half of the valencian region . 
  [ relevant map ] ( http://www.prolingua.gal/uploads/thumbnail/d4838ccd91c8df989b17eba35d48f75e2e4ac531.png ) why ? 
  it began late , very late . 
  officially . 
  what was the objective of fernando and isabel in their marriage in 1478 . 
  castille was more powerful than aragon , yes , but aragon itself was on the brink of converting itself into the next superpower of the christendom . 
  it had lost naples time ago , but recently it had reseized with extreme facility . 
  aragon had had a great time in the 13th century . 
  the following two slowed down it 's inevitable expansion with plagues , bad harvests , crisis , and a long unfortunate etc. 
  plus , france had won the fight over occitania . 
  and wow occitania was far away from paris that time , both culturally and physically . 
  aragon was very decentralized , yes , but now , at the end of the 15th century , it had grasped ( with venice ) all the mediterranian commerce , and now had so much gold , manpower and armies to take over the world , both christian ( with the approval of the pope ) and muslim , beginning by italy . 
  and with castille , they would be unparalleled . 
  all the united kingdom strategy was going to be the orientation to the mediterranian . 
  barcelona would be the capital , or valencia , two cities which in that time were the same as big . 
  [ onwards ! ], 
  ( http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20070623125156/lotr/images/3/34/aragorn2.jpg ) the discovery of the americas changed all that . 
  aragon entered a deep crisis while the center and western blocks of the peninsula , now culturally established , flourished with the spices trades and the metal extractions from ultramar . 
  the strategy shifted west , aragon was kept marginalized . 
  the elites started speaking castillian and would not stop until the 20th century . 
  the final blow the only theoretical now equal union of castille and aragon was dealt in 1714 . 
  in the spanish succession war i will not extend much as i rely on your history knowledge . 
  but key was the factor of the death of the older brother , joseph i , of the austrian throne claimer , charles vi in the middle of the war , as the netherlands and gb stopped supporting him as they did n't want again a spanish-austrian megabuck . 
  charles vi renounced to the spanish throne and only aragon kept with the war . 
  ( only catalonia , as zaragoza and valencia had already failed ) . 
  [ in this interview in spanish ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2014/09/12/5412a65e268e3ec6088b456f.html ) you can have many details and solve misconceptions about the conflict : the ` fueros ' of the three main parts of aragon ( aragon , valencia and catalonia ) , that is , the local laws and privileges , were stripped , and from here , the castillians got in a risky move , that could have gone bad or good . 
  it went bad . 
  [ centralization to aragon  ( http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/7243/3216/1600/345397/mapa_espanya_assimilada.jpg ) to equal castille to spain , when its not . 
  to say the francoist slogan : espa\u00f1a ` una ' ( one ) , grande y libre ( great and free ) . 
  had they accomplished the catalan integration into castillian spain , the success would have been resounding , but it was difficult , and madrid was not paris . 
  and during centuries , and still now on , corruption , nepotism and bad moral practices have been higher in spain than in the rest of occidental europe . 
  the independentist parties have a total result of 47 % . 
  in two phrases this is the result : the independentists said before than this is a plebiscite but now want to count seats . 
  the unionists said before these were normal elections , but now they want to count votes . 
  the thing is that there is n't a direct proportionality in votes as catalonia is divided in four provinces and each one contributes its seats . 
  also , the voting system is the [ d'hondt method ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d%27hondt_method ) . 
  results by political parties : ( total seats : 135 ) total participation : 77 % !!, 
  39,6 % votes . 
  meaning in english ` together for the yes ' ( yes for independence ) . 
  coalition of two minor parties and two big parties : cdc * ( convergencia democratica de catalunya ) and erc ( esquerra republicana de catalunya , republican left of catalonia ) . 
  17,9 % votes . 
  citizens in english . 
  they began in 2006 as a party to fill the gap of being left and spanish , but since the last year this party went national and changed to ciudadanos ( in spanish not catalan ) . 
  the main leader , albert rivera , has gone to madrid and the new candidate has been subject of many commentaries throughout this campaign . 
  [ mainly , admiration ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=ines+arrimadas&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cacq_auoawovchmiwan0m5eyyaivbt8ach2h5g4y&amp;biw=908&amp;bih=763 ) . 
  the party has become more right than left recently . 
  we can say it 's now in the middle . 
  12,7 % votes . 
  socialist party of catalonia . 
  the branch of psoe in catalonia , essentially . 
  they are not independentists . 
  11 seats . 
  8,9 % votes . 
  it means catalonia yes it is possible , or yes we can . 
  the branch of podemos ( we can ) , the new syriza-like party that rose to prominence last year in spain along with ciudadanos because of the political crisis caused by the erosion of bypartidism . 
  the thing is , this branch in catalonia has not been fully controlled by the center in madrid , and is in coalition with more parties here . 
  it 's stance is neither yes or no . 
  it 's complicated politics here . 
  catalonia is one of the world 's places with more deep and complex politics . 
  11 seats . 
  8,5 % votes . 
  the popular party . 
  it governs in madrid . 
  it 's the cdu , ump , tories of spain . 
  this last legislature has been very criticized in all spain . 
  we can say they are not very ` popular ' xdxd . 
  they are the most anti-independentists here . 
  * cup . 
  10 seats . 
  8,2 % votes . 
  candidatura d'unitat popular . 
  candidacy of the popular unity . 
  very lefty , revolutionary , cries for disobedience , anti-troika , pro-popular control and popular gatherings , this kind of stuff . 
  also , very independentists . 
  they reject spain and also the eu . 
  the party was founded 10-15 years ago as a coalition of small movements and has risen more and more until today . 
  important : cup said that if indeps . 
  do n't reach 50 % they wo n't vote for junts pel s\u00ed .
