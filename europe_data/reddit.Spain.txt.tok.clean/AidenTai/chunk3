  thus catalan had a natural defense as it was the official language of the east . 
  the second factor that helped it was that it was the language least similar to castillian of the romance languages of spain ( its history was more closely tied to occitan in france than to castilian or portuguese ) . 
  therefore , it was harder for castillian to influence it . 
  tl ; dr : moorish invaders held the peninsula other than the far north , where christian kingdoms sprung up from what remained of the roman and pre\u2010roman people . 
  kingdoms all join forces to get rid of the moors , and once united , end up kicking them out completely . 
  united kingdoms take castillian as the official language which displaces other languages , and spain is formed . 
  then this muslim\u2010free peninsula provides endless ham , pork , blood sausage , wine , and beer for everyone !, 
  oh , and portugal is a bad child and breaks off . 
  it 'll come back someday , though . 
  [ fuck yeah ! \\* \u0301\u0301\u0301\u0301\u0301\u0301\u0301\u0301 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r5a0pg4on8 ), 
  not french enough . 
  medal and a chocolatine ought to do it . 
  i dunno , i would think americans or the british would be belgium 's largest foreign visitors . 
  the dutch are awfully skinny it seems . 
  please post this as a separate link . 
  it 's pretty cool . 
  almost always , anyways . 
  sometimes there are major fuck\u2010ups where pilots seem to have been trained by chimps , doing things that are inherently `` obviously '' wrong ( for a pilot , anyways ) or things against which they are precisely warned in training . 
  very frustrating to read reports of some accidents where pilot error killed passengers and the error was something glaringly bad . 
  most crashes are n't like this , but you 'd be surprised at the number of `` pilot error '' crashes that involve errors that are incredibly stupid . 
  things like not knowing or recalling that when important instruments fail , some planes go into alternate law where alarms that would normally go off do n't , and pilots then take the lack of an alarm as meaning the dangerous situation which they are meant to detect is not present when it really is . 
  the whole attitude of taking care of yourself , and never lifting a finger for others . 
  more of an attitude of `` it 's not my problem '' . 
  you see this often times with government employees or customer service people . 
  got an appointment with the government that you waited two months for , but the day you show up , they 're having computer trouble ? 
  too bad , got to get another appointment in another two months . 
  oh , it should n't take this long to do things ? 
  not their problem . 
  a customer at a store looks like he 's in a hurry to pay and leave , but you 're having a conversation with another coworker and do n't want to interrupt it ? 
  well let him wait , you should n't feel obliged to serve him any quicker than what 's convenient for you . 
  at a park and you bought snack food and now have leftover containers/bags ? 
  just leave it on the grass . 
  it 's the city 's problem now to make sure it gets cleaned up , not yours . 
  i love how in some other countries ( germany , switzerland , etc. ), 
  people will call out strangers on their bad behaviour and correct them if they do something bad or offensive . 
  sometimes it 's not even a case of telling a person they 're wrong explicitly . 
  it may be just like pushing them a little as you walk by to show that they 're in the way , or getting in front of their car so that they ca n't speed in a school zone . 
  society just works so much better if people work together well and make sure others do too . 
  if these moroccans keep coming into andalucia , ceuta , and melilla , we may need to think about starting a second reconquista . 
  deflation is different from devaluation . 
  the first deals with dropping consumer prices for a currency , the second deals with the rate of exchange between different currencies . 
  yours is pretty awesome too , buddy . 
  a couple other `` restoration '' projects ( we 're good at this !, 
  ) : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/aug/20/spain.gilestremlett http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/aug/22/spain-church-mural-ruin-restoration, 
  the difference is in europe we often see the cost we pay towards healthcare or car figure it out , whereas the cost might be less obvious in the us because the employer pays for private health insurance behind the scenes and the employee never sees the payments and is only ever charged whatever their deductible might be based off usage . 
  so effectively in the us the gross salary excludes what the worker is earning from their employer in health care , which is a very substantial amount , but one which never enters the employees speadsheet 's and personal accounting . 
  `` real scientists '' ( ie those studying nutrition , molecular biology , etc. ), 
  think the us food pyramid and myplate are somewhere between jokes , malevolently misinformative , and hopelessly clueless . 
  they are brought to you by the department of agriculture of the us , which has rooted interests in promoting the most common us agricultural products . 
  if you want something much more reliable , look up the healthy eating pyramid and plate from harvard . 
  0:47 santorini , greece, 
  well , it could have been an argentinian rescue instead i suppose . 
  culture would probably be most similar in italy ( excluding places that are obviously very close like andorra and portugal ) , meaning an easier move . 
  france seems nice as well , but there 's just the slight problem of it being full of frenchmen . 
  is this a good time to invest in eastern poland ? 
  ah , figurd i 'd see a swiss guy here . 
  please invade and install a similar government here . 
  thanks . 
  he 's not the only one . 
  i 'm pretty strongly pro\u2010ukip too . 
  too soon to forget trafalgar . 
  it 's a thing in some parts of the us apparently : http://www.yummly.com/recipes/pizza-with-ketchup, 
  have n't heard anything besides the oath and that 's including some recent cases . 
  us will make the process painful on your wallet though , those dicks . 
  prepare yourself for double taxation , 
  during times of trial , jews in spain kept circumcising even against the law , and many were put to death for it . 
  following your religion here and going against unjust laws is easier now , but it should n't have to be necessary in this day and age to continue to be persecuted legally for following the core commandments your faith . 
  shame it 's like this . 
  honestly , if the eu just got its shit together on the refugee situation and also put certain caps on freedom of movement ( allowing for limitations of eu immigration if more than 10 % of the population were already immigrants , for instance ) then there would be no discussion . 
  this is pretty much a result of the failure on the part of the eu to keep extra-eu and intra-eu immigration to a reasonable level in the hardest hit countries . 
  people in the uk would n't be so into brexit if they felt that there were real controls in place to protect against porous borders , false refugee claims , limitless immigration from poorer eu countries , and welfare tourism . 
  if you like sitting next to new people and striking up conversation on a bus , you might be a kiwi . 
  if when hungry , everyone rushes to be first in line for food , brushing up against others without concern , you might be an american . 
  if someone is breaking the rules , and you do n't care that they 're breaking them , certainly would n't try to stop them , and instead see it as permission to break the rules also , then you 're a southerner . 
  portugal , andorra ... iberia in 1600 was perfect and aesthetically spot on . 
  come back bros , we 're better together :(, 
  :( but we 're better together bro ... 
  your ancestors would be ashamed of you . 
  take that back right now !, 
  only the spanish in here will get what you mean . 
  it 's pretty kickass , yeah . 
  you know what would look sweet ? 
  something like [ this ] ( https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=flag+iberian+union&amp;view=detailv2&amp;&amp;id=4c790f7b2a3557f34d96f088530fe37716a3ee7a&amp;selectedindex=2&amp;ccid=zc%2fierlt&amp;simid=608002958758511301&amp;thid=oip.mcdcfe27ab2ed8e71466ed11d6e2c4a12o0 ) or [ this ] ( http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130113144357/althistory/images/f/f7/flag_1042r.png ) .

  do you prefer the [ burgundy cross ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/flag_of_cross_of_burgundy.svg ) ? 
  should n't trust the bloody english . 
  i wish i were 183 :(, 
  fascinating !, 
  they 're mixed i believe . 
  they cooperate well with some spanish authorities , but other governments and other governmental groups do have some issues with them at times . 
  problem with that is greenland is * far * away . 
  need something accessible by boat that 's not too long a trip from where migrant are caught . 
  landmines are isolated to certain parts . 
  but sure , there are other places not disputed that could be better , i 'll grant you that . 
  gosh we really need to get some kind of agreement such as the one australia has with its island neighbors like nauru . 
  if only libya were still stable . 
  barring that , the king and government of morocco are helpful in these matters , perhaps holding mediterranean migrants in the ~ ~ western sahara ~ ~ south could be feasible given how empty it is . 
  would certainly be a similar policy to australia 's . 
  sea asylum seekers always get sent there to be processed , whereas ones arriving by air are handled separately . 
  referendum will be illegal , so it 's likely that the government will make moves to block it from happening .
