nah , they 're crappy 70 ' houses that can be found anywhere on the globe , what you say is only true for traditional residencies . 
  standaritzation of architecture has its drawbacks, 
  snow ? 
  you 're talking about that white thing that falls from the sky about once every ten years and turns into water once it touches the ground ? 
  feels like sunlight ! ... 
  * are you afraid of the sunlight mr. 
  dracula ? 
   had to sleep without any blanket at all . 
  people do n't do that ? 
   and outside it was even worse since the sun was shining all the time . 
  [ from now onwards , i 'll imagine swedes like this ] ( http://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1394/52/1394528087977.jpg ), 
  well are n't you a crazy northerner, 
  oh , no , here we start sweating at around 28 or so , the t-shirt is just for comfort ( we like it more than heavy clothing ), 
  well yes , there 's the interior and the mountatious regions . 
  we 're the 2nd most montanious country in all europe, 
  i 'm wearing a shirt , jeans a jumper and so on , aaaaand a blanket !, 
  it 's too cold here, 
  yeah , t-shirts start for me at around 20-23 ( around april-may or so ) and it ends in november ( yes , we 've been over 20\u00ba until this week ), 
  and you 're * central * europe , not even north, 
  well ... 
  i have to feel sorry for you , but then again , i ca n't be too much time below 10 in the wild streets myself, 
  ... i ca n't even ... 
  i 'm on anorak , gloves and scarf at that temperature !, 
  yeah , like we do !, 
  we range from warm weather to mild warm weather !, 
  * and we complain about it , like a lot *, 
  to the beach . 
  we stop going below 25 !, 
  * are you guys crazy ? 
  why does people even live up there ? 
  [ i guess you 're like this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5q77mqzu2q ), 
  when you go less than 20 it 's considered cold , and below 10 it starts being unbereable, 
  that 's cool . 
  here in barcelona we 've got cold climate compared to the south and we reach 36-38\u00ba . 
  when i went to stockholm and bergen one summer i thought it was winter , having to go with jackets everywhere , but natives showed their extra pale skin with teeshirts that only should be used when there 's actually warmth, 
  well now i 'm cold , so i 'll check my phone and tell you : 16\u00ba , and yes , i 'm fairly dressed , not just a teeshirt, 
  both my favourite architectural firm and space agency working togheter ... * on a lunar base * ? 
  that 's amazing !, 
  not in catalonia it does n't, 
  they are n't catalonia , they are `` els pa\u00efsos catalans '' , some sort of `` greater catalonia '' where settlers went in la reconquesta when we kicked the muslims out, 
  alive today . 
  i say that because unionist defend their constitution with the reasoning that `` we all voted for it and it has a social backing '' . 
  i did n't , and as far as i know , democracy comes before any law, 
  they ca n't be compared , they have n't got much in common besides the name . 
  oh alright , so manipulating the general population into voting that and then claiming that everyone voted it and it 's sacrosanct is a valid argument ... 
  could n't say , but it is a popular style : it sells really well, 
  yeah , i also like the one from bilbao . 
   and now i remember the simpsons episode with gehry [ 1 ] , which is a really good one . 
  that 's exactly what i was thinking of !, 
  also , i 'd say that that is governmental corruption ( we have a history here with that ) or dysfunctional design : a funcional building is by definition just that , and what you derscribed does n't sound that efficient :p . 
  it 's a definition by oxford dictionary , not mine, 
  well yeah , for example many of rirchard gehry 's buildings are pretty horrible , while in others he 's spot on : [ emp museum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emp_museum#mediaviewer/file:aerial_view_of_empsfm.jpg ) vs [ gugghenheim in bilbao ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/guggenheim-bilbao-jan05.jpg ) . 
  i 'd say the problem arises when it ca n't function correctly as a building or the cost ist too high for what it actually does , that usually means that the architect went crazy, 
  yeah ... because ppsoe will do it ( not that there is n't any will from the general populace anyway , spaniards * do n't * want us to vote ) . 
  also , podemos has dodged this question repeatedly so they 're on the same boat ( they say that we can vote , but not * how * ), 
  yup, 
  apart from what you said , there 's also the need of a state-wide referendum , another round of voting in senate/congress , state-wide elections * and then * another round of voting ... 
  [ read this . 
  our case is the one of `` external '' self-determination ] ( http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/self_determination_international_law ), 
  to be changed ? 
  it 's almost impossible to do so ( unless you want to comply to europe ) ... 
  i 'd recommend you to read how it has to be done , it 's hilarious !, 
  i 'll fill you out tomorrow , do n't worry , i 'm quite busy today sadly, 
  but that does n't justify a self-made constitution made to suit the governing class , which still does it nowadays, 
  well in that case i wo n't criticise it ... thoooooooogh le corbusier knew exactly how to do buildings in a post-war scenario with low funding : [ compare it to the solviet blocs that i saw in berlin , for example ] ( http://www.mimoa.eu/images/6804_l.jpg ), 
   how many texts did you want them to vote ? 
  of course they voted one and in case it would fail they would change it slightly . 
  how do you know or how did you expect the people to know that ? 
  they clearly manipulated the people into voting a constitution under their own terms taking advantadge of the transtition , and this is a well known fact . 
   but it 's plain stupid to think there was another choice besides democracy for spain . 
  this might seem obivious to you and me , but remember that the people that voted it had just lived around 40 years of fascism, 
  now we 're discussing * why * we want to separate , which is another bussiness . 
  we do have problems and we are persecuted and our history with spain only began * once * we were conquered by them , in 1716 ( thus starting proper `` spain '' in history ) . 
  so yeah , do you really think so many people would bother with all this camaing if we were all living well ? 
  are you aware that that is just a political theory * and not * the right of self-determination ? 
   this policy was pursued by the major powers during the cold war . 
  it was a particular policy , as stated , followed by major powers . 
  these are just examples of political thought based on the self-determination right of nations, 
  yet the referendum was semiorganised by the army and no other option apart from that constitution was given . 
  how could people that had lived almost their entire lives under a dictatorship could have thought like you do now ? 
  it is monumental , though i mean , they could have done something alike the reichstag ... 
  i might be biased but i love norman foster and that is my favourite building in all germany, 
  of course !, 
  that 's is why i 'm complaining that people criticise modern architecture : it is n't that i do n't like classical buildings , the thing is that they are * old * . 
  we should n't still be using those styles yet we do !, 
  and when someone tries something innovative , people criticise it for it 's new forms , without looking at energy efficiency , light or volumes . 
  that 's why i did n't say anything about the estonian station , i do n't know enough to talk about it , even though i kinda like the design ( maybe not my favourite but that 's subjective of course ), 
  well yes of course , territiorial integrity of the * nation that is going to determine it 's future * . 
  not the one that it is secceding from . 
  but that is obvious, 
  have you actually read the definition ? 
  so does literally every single european country with eachother . 
  yeah alright , so spain is a part of morroco because they have a common history ... or france , or the now defunct hre , or ... oh wait , it does n't make sense !, 
  i 'm sorry but those look really boring . 
  i mean , compare it to [ this ] ( http://www.archello.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/header_detail_large/story/media/09110080235.jpg ) , the new guangzhou station ( though i 'd say the desing would work better in something smaller , it 's astoundingly beautiful . 
  classical style rarely works and is that a reformation that i 'm seeing in the ceiling on the leipzig 's one ? 
  frankly , between the few classical ones that i like , [ grand central station in nyc is my favourite ] ( http://krissacurran.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/grand-central-terminal-hd-widescreen-wallpaper-wallpapers-grand_central_terminal-1280x800.jpg ) , both by it 's enourmous volume and variety in design ( it 's a really well thought planning that spans across many levels in the various streets , with many exits and different styles ), 
  because it is defined as that in our estatut ( the one that also makes us an autonous region ) . 
  do you know what a nation is , by the way ? 
  [ a large body of people united by common descent , history , culture , or language , inhabiting a particular state or territory ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/nation ) catalonia is just that,
