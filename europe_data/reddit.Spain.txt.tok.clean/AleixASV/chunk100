  but you know , * just to be sure * that this `` worthless conference '' did n't work , [ let 's just say spain tried other methods apart from critique , as usual ] ( https://twitter.com/aleixsarri/status/822396570054238208?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw ) . 
  i just checked , he speaks catalan , spanish , french , english and romanian ( he 's learning it though , but he speaks more or less fluently !, 
  ) , that 's gooooood , there 's nothing closer to a bilateral agreement than marriage !, 
  now to proceed to do it on a state level !, 
  well , not only our president was a baller with his argumentation , he demonstrated that he knows languages !, 
  [ french ] ( https://twitter.com/govern/status/823967775345360896 ) and [ english ] ( https://twitter.com/govern/status/823971967594172417 ) at least !, 
  i think he knows romanian too , his wife is from there . 
  here is [ his full speech ] ( https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x59jv28_el-discurs-integre-de-puigdemont-a-brussel-les_news ) , in catalan , french and english , though i have n't been able to find a non-dubbed version for the latter part in these two languages . 
  it 's more or less followable though . 
  oh and the place was [ packed ] ( https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x59jh2e_la-sala-de-la-conferencia-de-puigdemont-a-brussel-les-plena-a-vessar_webcam ) , even if there were spanish boycott [ attempts ] ( https://twitter.com/aleixsarri/status/822396570054238208?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw ) edit : the thread is 62 % upvoted , all of the comments in favour of catalonia downvoted ... yeah , i think i see a trend here . 
  ehhh , they 're mediterranean enough , if galicia is in it then they are in it, 
  barcelona wants to do the same in 2020 with cars registered before * 2006 * or so i heard , and wants to impose bans on critical days on these cars starting this year , targeting diesels especially . 
  without investing in public transportation , the clusterfuck will be enormous . 
  mediterranean council fuck yes !, 
  holy shit , and talk about screws loose !, 
  we 'll have to send our [ arrrrrrmm ... y i mean police ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilo8omvde2s ) to deal with them !, 
  violence is their right !, 
  nah , nah , * get invaded by !, 
  * napole\u00f3n was right , we are frenchies !, 
  what about that , spain !, 
  also , * we have already tried to invade you , but it seems our cover attack was foiled !, 
  * you know from where manel valls is from , right ? 
  the call of democracy mate , we 're crazy people, 
  we 'll invite people from perpiny\u00e0 man , we 're not afraid . 
  real madrid is not concerned with organizing referendums ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ( :p ), 
  well , here in catalonia our referendum is scheduled for 2017 , so let 's hope it is n't the only one, 
  copy ? 
  the dome of the pantheon is an original roman invention !, 
  later copied and adapted by the bizantine ( greek ) emperors !, 
  well , the argument in favour of those is that the area around them * needs * them . 
  the case for the cementery is clear , there was literally nothing there before , so i really do n't see how that is a negative . 
  i agree , he * could * be compared to gehry ( whom i despise ) or catalatrava , but i think that while his exteriors are a bit lackluster his interiors are worldclass works of art and few could do it like him at his time . 
  mine was half a semester ago , but yeah :p, 
  borromini and bernini were both great , i 'm not against them . 
  but late barroque onwards it started to get stale, 
  it 's weird , that 's for sure , but in line with his style : http://www.archdaily.com/375034/ad-classics-igualada-cemetery-enric-miralles-carme-pinos http://www.archdaily.com/111869/ad-classics-the-scottish-parliament-enric-miralles, 
  yup , that 's what i was thinking , it 's just different decor for every station , which is fine and should be done by an architect to ensure good lighting and all ... 
  i just ca n't get over the trend of confusing decoration with architecture, 
  nah trust me , it 's well made , the architect was proably the best ( sadly died young a few years ago ) that has ever come out of catalonia in half a century ( also , the teacher * of * one of my teachers , coincidentally ) . 
  the only part that i do n't really get is this [ fa\u00e7ade ] ( https://culturaesarqweek.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/parlamento-de-escocia-2004.jpg?w=980 ) . 
  it symbolizes the `` open curtains '' of democracy , but ehhhhh i dunno . 
  how are they flat ? 
  and why is irregularity bad ? 
  also , i 've been there , they are metal , they do n't look like plastic at all, 
  i mean , it does have some bad angles , but not all of them . 
  it 's mainly meant to be looked from pic2 , and i 've been there and it definetely does n't look as bad as in photos . 
  it absoutely is . 
  art is subjective , and architecture of course too , but to just bash all contemporary architecture ` cuz it ai n't got no classic orders is just ignorant . 
  * especially * comparing it with the example he gave . 
  [ just read it , it 's hilarious what he calls `` beauty '' actually is . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_monument_of_scotland ), 
  seriously . 
  it 's like , the * best * library, 
  the beauty of the background ? 
  are you crazy ? 
  it 's probably one of the shittiest knockoffs of classical architecture that have ever been made ( do you even know what the black parthenon is or why it was such as failure ? ), 
  classical architecture should 've died in the barroque , thank god for miralles 's [ parliament ] ( http://www.panoramafactory.net/albums/interiors/scottishparliament.jpg ) [ pic2 ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/c0/b3/fb/c0b3fb594ecdc6beb7876481ce4bdc02.jpg ) [ pic3 ] ( https://www.rmjm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/new-scottish-parliament-scotland.jpg ) beacause it 's gorgeous and edinburgh certainly needs to impulse new design lest it becomes just another run of the mill classical themepark . 
  i mean , to call it architectonic ... well , it 's a bit of a stretch , since that 's just aesthestically pleasing decoration , but yeah , metros mostly are the most depressing part of any city ( underground spaces tend to be like that ) and they should n't !, 
  plus i noticed some interesting takes on aaltos design ( such as pic 5 , somehow reminds me of viipuri [ library ] ( http://diariodesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-world-monuments-fundknoll-modernism-prize-viipuri-library-alvar-aalto-vyborg-russia-3.jpg ) ) and generally it seems like a very good use of current design trends . 
  again though , architecture is much more than just decor , but i 'm just nitpicking i guess . 
  it matters when he 's part of the competition . 
  also , / s, 
  name * our * moon village aftern * an american ? 
  we need our heroes too !, 
  but yeah , nova europa is the most neutral, 
  it just sounds weird in catalan ... `` ny '' is our '' \u00f1 '' sound , i 'd vote for something more roman-like , such as `` lunopople '' ( which coincidentally more or less means lunar town in catalan , badly spelt :p ), 
  i just realized how nice living in the eu is ... 
  i guess i needed to look at somebody else 's day to realize that i too get to do something like that , it 's a weird feeling , but i 'm very thankful that our living conditions are so great . 
  i mean , people want to see snow , it 's so rare !, 
  and so they idealize it and think it 's wonderful and all , and do n't remember the pain :p !, 
  he can indeed !, 
  that 's actually the job of the architect , to design something in such a way that some uses are discouraged while others are not . 
  it 's not coincidenal that this artwork has this laberintic , almost playful shape wheras an statue would be much more ... `` serene '' ? 
  it does n't inspire the same set of actions around it . 
  architects do project the potential uses of their buildings though, 
  could be ( that 's one of the mid-tier mountains i mentioned before ) , since there 's many very tall mountains in the montseny which could have snow up there in may in a cold year . 
  thaaaat 's not near barcelona . 
  it 's as far away from the city as amsterdam to the belgian border , to give you an idea . 
  architects , by default of their job , have to consider every angle . 
  a public space ( moreso something as open as that ) is just that , public , meaning that it 's for everyone and so everyone gets to do whatever they want , despite the actual meaning of the place . 
  snow near bcn in may ? 
  that 's definetely end of the world stuff , i do n't think it has ever happened . 
  those mountains proooobably were n't around barcelona , i 'd bet it was either pyrenees , [ the pedraforca ] ( http://www.fotonatura.org/galerias/fotos/usr11500/11996547xf.jpg ) or a mid-tier mountain inbetween . 
  city itself , you 're talking about vallvidrera maybe ? 
  i was n't aware of that actually . 
  mr molina did n't even mention it !, 
  here it catalonia ( and by that i mean barcelona , the only important part ) there 's currently 0 snow to be seen . 
  i share your pain . 
  they are n't, 
  you fell for it you silly brits , it was all merely a ruse !,

   they still have our treasury since wwi and try to teach us `` our true history '' . 
  they also issued coins with `` capitals liberated from fascism '' , including bucharest . 
  they also took our brothers , basarabia . 
  oh look , they have our treasury too , from the civil war !, 
  what a happy * coin * cidence ( could n't resist , sorry :p ), 
  on one hand , the broken spanish is amazing ( cueva - cave - instead of tunnel etc ) and in the other , the puns are out of hand !, 
  spain as a state is in deep shit , spain as a society has pretty good ngo 's and other organizations that countribute a lot . 
  : : : signa el manifest : www.casanostracasavostra.cat : : : we want to help those that flee from war , hunger , political persecution , sexual orientation or their creed . 
  but we want to welcome those that are already here and have problems with getting a decent life .
