  link to the manifest : www.casanostracasavostra.cat / nac\u00ed en el mediterr\u00e1neo is one of the most famous and beautiful songs ever composed in spanish , by joan manuel serrat . 
  it sings about the beautiful mediterranean sea , yet nowadays it is the biggest mass grave in the world . 
  here are the lyrics in english :  perhaps because my childhood continues playing on your beach , and hidden behind the canes my first love sleeps , i wear your light and your smell wherever i go , and piled on your sand i keep love , plays and sorrows . 
   i , that in my skin have the bitter flavour of the eternal crying , which a hundred peoples ( nations ) have shed into you from algeciras to istanbul , so that you can paint in blue their long nights of winter . 
  beacause of misadventures , your soul is deep and dark . 
   my eyes got used to your red dusks like the bend to the truck ... 
  i am a singer , i am a liar , i like gambling and wine , i have the soul of a sailor ... what can i do ? 
  i was born in the mediterranean . 
   and you approach , and you leave after kissing my small village . 
  playing with the tide you go away , thinking of returning . 
  you are like a woman scented with tar who is missed and loved , who is known and feared . 
  if the fate ( death ) comes in search of me an unhappy day . 
  push my boat to the sea with an autumnal east wind ( levante ) and allow the storm can strip its white wings . 
  and bury me without mourning between the beach and the sky ...  in the hillside of a mountain , higher than the horizon . 
  i want to have a good view . 
  my body will be way , i will give green to the pines and yellow to the broom ... near the sea.because i was born in the mediterranean .

  welp , ca n't say i did n't expect it , i guess i had a little hope left for here, 
  in the rare occasion that snow happens down here ( every 3 or 4 years or so ) , that 's the type of snow we get . 
  we call it aiguaneu , `` watersnow '' . 
  but hey , it 's something at least . 
  humidity is n't much of an issue beacause mediterranean winters are dry . 
  nah , we do have anoraks and such in here too , we just do n't like the cold . 
  oh , so basically you get our summer !, 
  that 's good to know , in scotland they never go over 18 , it sucks, 
  more like made of stone or something :p, 
  our `` winter '' hits 5 as the lowest temp and we 're glad of that , thankyouverymuch !, 
  i mean , i 've done that and not even in winter , probably the coldest place i 've ever been was in the j\u00fcngfrau in switzerland * in summer * . 
  you guys are crazy up there !, 
  you need to experience a real summer too once in a while :p !, 
  just look at the streetview for the beaches of [ palafrugell ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/17200+palafrugell,+girona,+espanya/@41.9154076,3.1829876,12.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x12ba5461952cfa7f:0x1e4e67cece32a232!8m2!3d41.9179112!4d3.1629611 ) , that 's where it 's at !, 
  yeaaaahhhhh but you get real snow too !, 
  i mean , i 'm talking about barcelona here , beacause we already have the pyrenees and the country full of snow , but then again , the cities matter most , and it 's where it never does snow !, 
  i do n't even think i ever been lower than -5 here and it was just one occasion so i think i ca n't comment . 
  but we do n't have a lot of wind and the mediterranean winters are very dry, 
  oh it 's alright , no problem, 
  yeah , when we say `` snow '' we really mean that . 
  we even have a word for it , aiguaneu ( watersnow ) . 
  it 's so sad . 
  i mean , people here are already wondering if it will snow or not , we have n't seen that in barcelona for a couple years now !, 
  nevermind that snow only happens at below 0 ... 
  ... i mean ... yes ? 
  we do n't use farenheit in europe , 0c is * very * cold here . 
  we 're [ * very * ] ( http://www.ccma.cat/el-temps/sacosta-lonada-de-fred-mes-intensa-dels-darrers-5-anys/noticia/2767470/ ) scared here with the upcoming polar wave that will hit us on monday and which will drop the temperatures to ... 7-8c :p, 
  * good * ? 
  you guys are crazy, 
  `` we should start back , '' gared urged as the woods began to grow dark around them . 
  `` the wildings are dead . '', 
  partially actually . 
  joseph p kenney ( father of jfk ) forced the no-invervention policy of the uk as us ambassador threatening with no support in the upcoming war beacause he was fond of franco 's catholicism as a deep religious person himself . 
  obviously this policy of `` neutrality '' adopted by the western democracies is what doomed the republic . 
  but that 's beside the point : the united states is responsible for * maintaining * the regime , starting with eisenhower with his friendly visit to franco in 1959 . 
  i think the support of the francoist regime by the americans is what led to a 36 year long fascist state in spain that tortured , repressed and destroyed any progress that the country could 've previously made . 
  well you never know . 
  andorra is a haven for french and spanish riches , so it 's all secret by default . 
  what the fuck, 
  mansana or illa de la disc\u00f2rdia in catalan though !, 
  spanish names in barcelona are just translations of the original name . 
  but yeah , it 's pretty great , it 's the palace that gaud\u00ed built for his patron in barcelona , and it has all of his unusual quirks ( like * wooden * masonry to dampen the sound of the horses downstairs , [ this may look like bricks , but it is n't ] ( http://palauguell.cat/sites/palauguell.cat/files/imagecache/espai_imatge_gran/mbs_1347_0.jpg ) )  i 've found that the fgc offers a combined ticket for the train + funicular + funiculars on site + museum , but on their site there 's no mention of the aeri . 
  perhaps it 's operated by another company . 
  it is . 
  i ignored the museum beacause for me at least the only important visit is the one inside the [ basilica ] ( https://www.aeridemontserrat.com/wp-content/uploads/basilica-montserrat.jpg ) , especially since you can go * around and up * the room through a lateral archway that lets you literally in front of the [ mare de d\u00e9u de montserrat ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7315/8731646787_c30dd121fb_b.jpg ) , the `` moreneta '' , our saint patron . 
  as for the combined ticket , i recall checking the prices and it actually was more or less the same price , though i had discounts on them both ( european youth card and all ) . 
  [ the aeri is pretty cool though ] ( http://www.visita3d.com/wp-content/uploads/freshizer/ba1944af721ca211e3e910a961be9453_aeri-od-695.jpg ) . 
  have you been to cardona ? 
  now that it 'll probably snow it 's absolutely the best time to go see it , [ it 's probably our best castle !, 
  ] ( http://www.cardona.cat/multimedia/imatge/noticies/copia-de-01111.jpg ) , and the church is a marvel of catalan architecture , one of the best romanesque churches there are . 
  also there 's salt mines that you can visit [ and lick ] ( http://www.descobrir.cat/ca/img2/2011/05/_mg_2682-6338.jpg ) , it 's pretty cool . 
  also , palau g\u00fcell ( my favourite gaud\u00ed house and pretty unknown ) is 12 $ for the general ticket with a bunch of discounts ( i get in with 5 $ :p ) , though it 's closed from the 16th to the 23th . 
   ( hey , museu nacional d'art was 16 $ for the entire family , and they did a great job collecting all these paintings . 
  what did operators of casa mill\u00e0 do ? ), 
  casa mil\u00e0 sadly is private , and the make bank ( literally too , they 're owned by a bank ) organizing temporal exhibitions and such . 
   montserrat is also an option , if it 's not too cold and windy there at this time . 
  hmmmm yeah ... dunno , i 've been there even with so much fog that you could n't see for more than a meter , so i 'd put visibility over temperature or wind . 
  but yeah , the cool part about montserrat is the the walk to sant jeroni , and if the wheater is n't too good i dunno . 
  if you end up going , go up with the aeri , it 's so much better than the funicular . 
  there 's a train station for it too , and you can buy tickets for the train online . 
  bah , if you 're not a southern european you 'll be fine . 
  it basically never rains on winter over here , and lowest temp will be at night , never below -5 ( at most ) , highest around 10 or 11 , which is n't as good as the 18 that we had today , but hey , it 's good by western standards . 
  us locals are scared to shit with the wheater though . 
  you 'll have to enjoy some hot [ cacaolat ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olblh9v5ufg ) , the national drink . 
  so what you 're saying is ... we 're fucked down here too ? 
  noooooo !, 
  nope . 
  not at all , once the temp goes lower than 10 i 'm switching the jacket for the anorak , with even moooooore layers !, 
  really ? 
  well ... 
  i kinda do it too , but without going to that extreme ... 
  i mean , if one of these scandis saw us complain about cold temperatures right now ... :p, 
  damm you gent de lo sud !, 
  i wan na get rid of this jacket already !, 
  but it looks like winter is actually coming , tv3 is our ned stark and said so . 
  braga del super3 all the way neeen !, 
  [ you too ] ( http://musiczine.es/images/stories/map.jpg ), 
  i have to wear a t-shirt * and * a hoodie * plus * a jacket outside !, 
  what is this balloney , i thought sol y playa meant something . 
  polar cold wave ? 
  yeah , i guess [ it could be hotter ] ( http://imgur.com/a/cyfwg ) . 
  so you 're basing your entire argument on hipotheticals * and * condescending quotes .
