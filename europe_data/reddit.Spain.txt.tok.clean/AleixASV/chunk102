  yeah , good job mate , have a nice day , i 'm done . 
  yeah , but it depends a lot in the area . 
  catalonia has a lower rate i think, 
  ... i just said that the senyera was the flag of the house of barcelona , so a dynastic flag , in origin , but hey , read whatever . 
  and sorry , but that hypothesis is just that , a hypothesis . 
  yes , some elderly do use them , though since most of catalonia 's cities are quite hilly they are n't that common anyway , beacause they 're hard to maneuver on steep ground . 
  i was referring to their use as an overweight 's people tranport though . 
  [ in * your * country :p ] ( http://petreraldia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/la-polic%c3%ada-local-en-el-momento-de-precintar-una-de-las-viviendas.jpg ), 
  ah yeah , i knew that word , did n't remember it existed , thanks !, 
  yeah , the font m\u00e0gica does n't work a lot of the time beacause of eco concerns ( it wastes a lot of water ) , so they schedule the `` shows '' , but hey , if that was your biggest letdown that means you enjoyed the city a lot !, 
  especially since we have a [ much bigger lightshow now :p ] ( http://cdn02.visitbarcelona.com/files/5445-7583-imagen/torre-agbar-noche-arquitectura-barcelona-pf-c1.jpg ), 
  i did say `` according to wikipedia '' , so thanks , i was n't sure of that date . 
  i knew it !, 
  the weirdest and most pot smoking people ( ? ), 
  is that a word in english ? ), 
  gather there , plus tons of people doing yoga and people usually dance the [ sardana ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eszsighiu_u&amp;t=3m0s ) , the national dance of catalonia , there . 
  even lazy-ass people like me that barely go cycling at all are thin , it must be the sun or something !, 
  but yeah , we do have obese people here too , though i suspect our definition of obese starts a bit earlier . 
  and here in spain we catalans are seen as `` cold '' and `` quiet '' , so if you thought we were vibrant just go down south , people are crazier there !, 
   park and people randomly started dancing around us . 
  though this sounds more like out of a movie , it reaally does n't happen that often :p . probably a ciutadella park thing . 
  being from barcelona and traveling to new york , it was quite amazing . 
  i even saw a couple of people in little electric chairs going around , which was surprising to say the least . 
  ermesseda 's tomb is dated at 1057 , before the hipotesis of mr. fat\u00e1s , and she was completely unrelated to him in feudal relationships . 
  i do n't know if he ignored it or the dating of the tomb was made after it , but it 's pretty easily dismantled . 
  would n't surprise me really , goddamm texans ... but hey , we 'd welcome them and give them the noob of the wolrd prize, 
  sure is !, 
  thing is , we do have 1st hand sources and you do n't , so good luck . 
  since the first variation of the senyera was found in the tomb of ermessenda , a catalan countess , it 's even obvious that the flag was catalan in origin . 
  but hey , do n't let me stop your circlejerk . 
  yeah , welp , i guess soon we 'll have to win the title for the * newest * flag . 
  what a paradox . 
  catalonia is a nation , and the senyera is its national flag . 
  beacause the spaniards copied and adapted our flag in the xviii since ships could n't distinguish theirs from the french , not our fault :p, 
  well , since it was the flag of the house of barcelona and later adopted as the flag of arag\u00f3 , you 're welcome :p !, 
  yup , by [ * at least * ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/bandera_de_catalunya#origen ) a century . 
  first 100 % confirmed senyera is from 1150 , even if we have other variations dated from 1057 , whereas the first dannebrog according to wikipedia is [ from 1219 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_denmark#history ), 
  [ ours is kind of complicated . 
  dangit , how can we boast of having the oldest national flag in the world if we ca n't recreate it nature ! ] ( http://www.banderasvdk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2000px-flag_of_catalonia.svg_.png ) .

  we even tried to genetically engineer them [ into our flower , the rose ] ( http://www.enviarfloresbarcelona.es/images/rosa-san-jordi-catalana.jpg ) . 
   well , i 'm not going to back it out with facts because i 'm in a break now , but i 've studied the spanish healthcare system and there are so many regional differences , that makes this map worthless . 
  this is * not * anecdotal evidence . 
  spanish healthcare is regional , not statal . 
  there 's no point in showing it as a block . 
  it 's just wrong . 
  [ on the same vein , we have a little escatological fixation over here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ihj91 ) ( last one is a bir archaic , but hey . 
  and yes , it gets a bit weird playing ff7 ), 
  spain at least knows how to divide,

  you 're 100 % right ... 
  so , when the reconquesta happened , the king of aragon , jaume i , created two kingdoms for the new territories : the kingom of mallorca and perpiny\u00e0 and the kingdom of val\u00e8ncia , instead of integrating them into the other lands . 
  then , the crown of aragon was like a federal state of diferent kingdoms ( aragon , two sicillies and sardinia , val\u00e8ncia , balears and perpiny\u00e0 and other lesser lands ) under the king of the crown , who ruled directly over catalonia , the only territory that was n't made into a kingdom but a principate , beacause it was the `` core '' of the state . 
  the official languages were catalan and aragonese , and for example the best writer in catalan at the time was joanot martorell , who was even admired by cervantes , and his work inspired the quijote , he was a valencian . 
  ramon llull , one of the best medieval scientists of all time was balear . 
  sl catalan culture , thanks to heavy colonization of the newly conquered lands , expanded to them , while being `` in another state '' to give it an equivalent . 
  this has lasted to today , where catalan culture is strongest at its core , and in places like val\u00e8ncia which have always tried to compete with catalonia catalan culture has and is sometimes seen as a sign from the rival , beacause of heavy erosion of the native culture , suplanted by the spanish . 
  this has reached the point that even the mere fact that speaking valencian in certain places can result in insults , like an offense . 
  they have even tried to make it into another language , inventing a new grammar based on the most extreme characteristics of the dialect , in order to distance themselves of catalan as much as possible , but again , this is only an effort from the most spanish-fied sector of the population that tries to alineate and divide the sector that actually speaks valencian . 
  thankfully they 've been pretty corrupt too and it 's bitting them in the ass and they 've lost a lot of power so they 're less influential , but they 're still around . 
  yes , but as i said before , the dialect come from the colonization of val\u00e8ncia by people from lleida , who already had that dialect ( just like balears has an evolved medieval northern catalan dialect , beacause the people who colonized it came from the empord\u00e0 region and girona ) . 
  valenci\u00e0 has been heavily eroded by spanish due to historical circumstances so it is very possible that they have lost some of the original traits , but it is n't a castilian accent . 
  the academia de la llengua valenciana is the official regulatory body for the valencian dialect , recognised by the generalitat valenciana ( executive of valencia ) and the other bodies of language of the catalan language , and they said that valencian is a dialect of catalan and any claim to deny it was pure populism . 
  that 's what i meant by academic support . 
  also linguistics and philology exist , but the claim was so stupid that any speaker of catalan can easily laugh at it . 
  and ? 
  those are different languages , like it 's done here with catalan , spanish and portuguese . 
  valencian is just a dialect of catalan that some politicians declared to be `` a different language '' ( with 0 academic support ) to stirr up conflict . 
  thankfully the issue has mostly settled down now . 
  yes , it has [ a lot of dialects ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/dialectes_catal%c3%a0.svg/800px-dialectes_catal%c3%a0.svg.png ) , mainly due to having a lot of speakers ( around 11m ) but being spoken in very different areas and regions ( val\u00e8ncia and catalonia have always done their thing , the balears are islands , northern catalonia was given away to france , etc. 
  ) , so it has a lot of dialects . 
  valencian does n't necessairly have to sound closer to castilian , it 's just that the colonizers of val\u00e8ncia in the reconquesta were from lleida , north of val\u00e8ncia and in the same dialectal block and happened to talk like that , which has continued to be their dialect . 
  due to geographical proximity there 's bound to be more differences too , but that 's secondary . 
  no , valencian is a dialect of catalan , but thing is , they call catalan `` valencian '' there , so it gets a bit confusing . 
  it 's diferent than catalan with a castilian accent , you 'll hear that pretty much anywhere around the [ grey ] ( http://www.ub.edu/geocrit/sn/sn-319_archivos/image002.jpg ) area around barcelona , for example , beacause of heavy immigration from other parts of spain in the 60 ' that really did n't assimilate and they just speak spanish in the day-to-day , so they have n't acquired a native accent . 
  i 've seen similar things ( thankfully i can count the occasions with one hand ) with poor attempts at differentiating catalan and valencian , even though they 're just names for the same language . 
  any second now, 
  you 're welcome !, 
  beacause as you well know , neither you nor i will be involved in the negotiations which are yet to be determined , so all of this is pure speculation . 
   anyway , in either case , whether we are idependent or not , i think its far better to pretend we deffinately get along super well with our bussines partners rather than rustling their jimmies just in case they decide to fuck us for no reason . 
  but this is obivous . 
  look , i 'll put it clearly for you . 
  one does not negotiate with the legislative branch , it 's done with the executive . 
  the executive is the commite , which then passes it to the parliment . 
  if we win the referendum they either can fuck us for no reason or benefit from having us in the eu as fait accompli , but we 'll be independent either way . 
  nope , it was part of spain * after * 1714 , beacause we lost the crown after being conquered and annexed by castille , which then in turn formed spain . 
  catalonia actually had it 's own army , laws , census , etc. 
  until 1714 . 
  it has been independent as a republic at least 3 times too , and apart from being the ruling principate of the crown of aragon , the predecessor to it ( county of barcelona ) had been independent for some centuries too . 
  if you 're going to talk about history at least know what you 're saying . 
  no , you do n't know how the eu works . 
  you 're talking about the european parliment , i 'm talking about the comission . 
  france wo n't veto us for that silly statement , they 're not idiots/spanish nationalists , keep dreaming . 
  i do n't really think they care that much about it , since they know nationalism is minoritary in nc , and still , we 're negotiating with the eu directly , not with member states . 
  of course , they have sway , but with a clear result in a referendum there 's not much they can do . 
  yeah , but it 's not like we 're going to ignore the piss-poor situation that france put nc in right ?
