  it 'd be pretty hypocrite, 
  you implied it , with the  time flies when you are having fun and the  we should hurry the govern to make a statement about this so we can piss off germany too like we did last month with france 's southern region . 
  i do n't really see how bayern is relevant to catalan politics like north catalonia is , but sure . 
  i do n't see what 's the issue ? 
  the right of self-detemination is recognised as part of * article 1 * in the un charter . 
  they have the right to express their free will if they so choose , just like we will here . 
   france 's southern region . 
  you mean catalunya nord ? 
  what statement ? 
  the independence movement in catalonia has continiously existed for more than a century . 
  these n00bz got nothing on us . 
  yes , they share the same space , but it is a bit less chaotic than your example i think , they in some cases have small designated lanes to avoid accidents . 
  they were contemporaries , yet haussmann just remodelated a city whereas cerd\u00e0 created one . 
  [ in black , this is the original city before his expansion . 
  in yellow , what he designed , and the rest is today 's city ] ( http://panel.ok-apartment.com/img/stored_images/barcelona/articles_images/barcelona_planned_extension.jpg ), 
  thank you . 
  people , usually from europe , see squares in a grid and start chanting about some kind of `` soul '' , like , what the fuck . 
  since when houses go to heaven ? 
  i did n't know that serpetine streets were more devout that straight avenues . 
  oh , but this is n't what we 're talking about , we too have * carrers peatonals * here , they 're very common in southern countries where people can enjoy a sunny day !,

  the superilla is different : [ it englobles 9 blocks of the city , a very big area ] ( http://especiales.elperiodico.com/comunes/graficoseepi/infographics/2016/agosto/superilla490.png ) and it closes its traffic on the inside , making it all peatonal except for residents and public transport , which is a quite radical solution to the traffic problem of the city , just chop it down to blocks and start closing them down . 
  absolutely saved on my phone, 
  you should remove that link, 
  keep on the good fight !, 
  do not go gentle into that good night !, 
  are n't i ? 
  i do n't quite remember what he said but i doubt it was that stupid , he seems intelligent enough . 
  yeah , one of the few things madrid did well was to put a catalan in charge of things :p, 
  dunno , seems like only the people i thought would be triggered by this are the ones answering , so yes so far . 
  keep the hyperbole train going on btw . 
  he triggered * a certain sector of this subrreddit * by making a pun with franco in it :p, 
  thank you !, 
  we 'll see about it . 
  for now the test areas have been made * in places of low density , so no actual pedestrians use them * and it just looks dumb . 
  i 'm not saying it wo n't work but ehhhhh , i 'm not so sure about it , they need to change quite a lot of the project . 
  is he free ? 
  i 'll ask them to / r/freesugusino !!, 
  related , [ this looks pretty on a photo ] ( http://ramonvilalta.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/21-aeria-nus-trinitat-barcelona-001.jpg ) and never in real life, 
  well ooooobviously !, 
  i mean , at least colchoneros know their team knows how to play * more or less *, 
  yeah yeah , we 've got nothing against madrile\u00f1os :p, 
  yup , so are we . 
  we have been trying to do this for at least 7 years now , and i feel it would be a massive treason ( there 's no other word for it ) if the catalan politicans suddenly decided to stop the machinery right now . 
  the ball is on the spanish right wing * to actually do something * and i 'm not talking about this pantomima of dialogue . 
  obviously even if the referendum was lost i think we would have enough levearage that we should get more autonomy in some way or another ( federalism or tax independence ) , but i feel like puigdemont was right . 
  it is too late , it 's either referendum or referendum . 
  which by the way , we need to reduce it of course , but it 's a direct effect of also being one of the densest cities in europe , thanks in fact to the efficiency of the design and that barcelona is surrounded by two rivers and mountains on all sides . 
  and belive me , at rush hour it does get prrrreeetty bad in the rondes . 
  let 's hope it is , but it needs a lot of work still . 
  the part where it connects with the trama of poblenou is a ghost town still, 
  portuwhat now ? 
  a map of the penninsula : worst spain , worse spain , great spain . 
  vote now with your phones please !, 
  psssst , in catalan , that place is too spelled like that ^ ( it 's the little things that count ), 
  we 're just a cancerous mass i guess ... huh ... well ... we exist , in some form :d !, 
  i must say this is preposterous . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ also ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ hilarious, 
  well yes , a federation back at the republic would 've worked but i 'm not so sure it would 've ended up like that . 
  the problem with spain is that half of it is fantastic and the other half is horrible , and the horrible half usually leads the country so there 's not really a good time for a referendum anyway ever , probably the only reason why we 'll end up making it unilaterally . 
  100 % agree with you . 
  and this might be the biggest challenge spain might met . 
  if they are n't able to understand the actual reality of the country as a plurinational state with * true * equality between diferent nations sharing a state then there is no point to that state at all . 
  it has only remained united for so long thanks to the army and its inertia and ideology , but it wo n't last for long . 
  not just decades too , i 'd argue that this has been going on since at least the decree of nueva planta in the xviii century . 
  we should appeal to the mods or something , its saaaad , also thank you !, 
  marina is the young night bar district of barcelona , a fun place * to go to * but maybe not to live in ... 
  yet :p, 
  nah , it 's fine , just that many people argue otherwise with pretty absurd argumentation, 
  there 's countries that are n't independent , and if catalonia 's nationality is up for discussion i 'd like to discuss how france in reality is not a nation but part of belgium . 
  poblenou was the old industrial center of the city , cutoff from the center with the ciutadella and with low quality housing mixed with factories , a low density model that , belive it or not , still survives to this day in almost half of the district , worse offenders being the areas around llacuna and marina . 
  there 's a lot of urbanistic work to be done there , they tried and failed to create a downtown with the 22 @ district ( though it was n't entirely their fault , the economic crisis fucked them ) but i think we should tear down most factories since plenty are abandoned and in ruin and build affordable housing . 
  * good , good . 
  poor guy 's banned here, 
  yes !, 
  the grid was hated until the 70s or so for a couple of reasons : the design was n't the one chosen in the public contest , it was imposed by madrid ( biiig nono , even then ) , and they had n't realized yet how genious it was , so they were constantly trying to break away with the pattern , which imho gave it the `` soul '' even if it 's a grid after all . 
  yeah , it 's a stab at some spanish trolls that camp around here denying that catalonia is a country :p, 
  we have both in barcelona :p, 
  to boil it down to simple terms , a church is a building where mass can be made , a basilica is a big church with 3 aisles ( a remnant from the constantinian basilicas of the romans ) and a cathedral is a church where a bishop ( leader of the diocesis , or catholic region ) lives , so a very important church . 
  a basilica is just a description of the floorplan of the church in the end , and a declaration of intentions , beacause catholics favour the basilica in front of the central floorplan church of the orthodox, 
  it probably still is . 
  it allowed us to drive at 50km/h at the center of the city when pretty much nobody else could in the crowded downtowns of europe while being one cities with most trees in the world * and * being compact enough that 2000 people could live in an illa and not know about it ( true numbers btw ) . 
  tram needs to go either through the diagonal or the surrounding area to make sense , sadly , beacause it 'll be damm hard to do . 
  and we desperately need the l9 to be complete so that the whole system is compact . 
  people sometimes need to go from point a to point b , * skipping * the neighbourhood , especially if we want to avoid car usage . 
  yes , for now , beacause barcelona is one of the cities in europe with less social housing . 
  we * really * need it . 
  the next need for the city is restoration work . 
  more or less 50 % of the entire city needs it , actually , so there 's plenty of work to do . 
  we 've got 10 metro lines , around 15 depending on how you count , +2 or 3 tram lines and tons of buses . 
  our public transport is one of the best in europe , better than a bike :p, 
  yes , the [ original plan ] ( http://www.portaldetuciudad.com/imagenes/86/infotipo/imgcontenido3043592.jpg ) pretty much included all of the city . 
  that 's part of the reason as to why it was revolutionary and pretty much created modern urbanism : a metric that could define and adapt to the territory , wherever it was made . 
  it was planned but not built , which was common at the time , beacause it was a city in constant growth . 
  weeeeeeell , the cathedral * was n't * done until [ 1913 ] ( http://www.ub.edu/geocrit/sn/sn-371_archivos/image002.jpg ) so you 're almost right :p ( the fa\u00e7ade is fake ) . 
  sagrada fam\u00edlia is a basilica , like st. pietro in the vatican . 
  true , but architects and urbanists are drafting up new plans to open them up again , taking apart the `` ziggurats '' that were built in the 60 in the middle ( they are called like that beacause they literally found that it was the most cost effective shape without blocking sunlight to the surrounding houses ) and creating public spaces !, 
  aaaaaand i know that beacause i just submitted mine a few weeks ago ( though it was just an assigment for my urbanism class , but trust me , it 's happening on real life too :p ) !, 
  ** edit ** : beacause i have too much damm time ( or lack of thereof ) , [ here it is ] ( http://imgur.com/nbg75wg ) , the summarized version, 
  i mean , we 'd be a net contributor since day one plus a federalist country , and we 'd lobby hard for that , against today 's current of regionalism .
