  we will , that 's for sure . 
  thing is , the human rights charter is above this silly consitution that only 35 % of the spanish population voted for , and it recognises self-detemination . 
  laws work for the people , not the other way around . 
  yup , i 've given up , there 's quite the collection of trolls spewing shit around as usual already , it 's pointless to try to discuss anything with them . 
  a guy once told me via pm that he would literally search through my profile `` revealing the truth '' about independence whenever i talked about catalonia . 
  another guy made a troll profile , / u/aleixasv _ insulting people and being pretentious all around . 
  these are just two examples that i recall right now , there were more probably , i 've been here for a while and i 'm sure it has happened to more people . 
  there ** is ** foul play involved . 
  we 're pro-eu here too , but people do n't know about us ... we 're even federalists for god 's sake !, 
  / r/europe is full of spanish trolls + ill informed people who belive their crap . 
  plus scots have a ton of recognition all around the world and people know a lot more about them than us , so they ca n't afford to not care as easily . 
  we 're federalists in catalonia , actually . 
  just not under spain . 
  not our problem , tell that to your politicians . 
  we want our money , thank you . 
  you should probably know that catalonia was n't part of spain 500 years ago . 
  aragon kept existing until [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nueva_planta_decrees ) came about courtesy of his grace , philip the v . so yeah , referendums did n't exist , armies decided for you . 
  we should make a new godwind 's law , `` pujol 's law '', 
  ehh ... what catalans have you actually talked with ? 
  economic reasons are basically 99 % of the argumentation, 
  it 's great !, 
  one of the challenges in architecture is building without a context , since it risks being a meaningless block of concrete and it looks like they succeded in escaping that !, 
  also , thank god it was n't in any classic style . 
  in this day and age those are absurdly outdated . 
  i want to visit the baltics for their contemporary architecture but i always have to wait beacause they keep building awesome projects !, 
  dudamel was great this year !, 
  i mean , good attempt at not my native language :p, 
  i mean , i did visit it when i went there , but it definetely * was n't * the most visited place in germany , not even close . 
  oh really ? 
  well , there 's crazies everywhere , but i have n't heard about this one , usually people claim he was from andalucia, 
  i mean , i 've met many spaniards who will tell you that col\u00f3n was from spain , so there 's that . 
  i 've always wanted to visit more towns around this area , they 're so pretty !, 
  heard they were considering catalonia too . 
  our transportation hub is impecable ( we are one of the major car exporters in europe ) , so it 'll be a close race . 
  never seen it in barcelona . 
  though the jewish population around here is minuscule ( to the point that i 've only seen jews when i went to nyc ) so it 's not that surprising . 
  map is whack, 
  do n't really know . 
  i would assume it 's the same as in the catalan xocolatina , ie , a small piece of chocolate, 
  i 'm comparing them to any other terrorist group and i find them pathetic and depicable , apart from the usual cruel . 
  do n't twist and spin , * that * is preying on the victim ( and of course that you had to find the sob story , this is fucking textbook ), 
  reading the wiki , they did n't really want to kill anyone : they placed a bomb in a court house that accidentally destroyed a wall , killing an old lady , which made them `` think about what they were doing '' and they stopped this type of acts . 
  they were preeeetty tame, 
  yup !, 
  huh , we just call both `` canya '' here , though i 've heard napolitana in spanish before too around here, 
  yeah , i 'm just half-kidding . 
  we catalans too get defensive with our * gastronomie !, 
  * it must be a mediterranean trait . 
  true , we do n't have a medieval book with the recipe . 
  we have * two * , [ the sent sov\u00ed book ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/llibre_de_sent_sov%c3%ad ) , one of the oldest * written books * in europe and the [ llibre del coch ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/llibre_del_coch ) where crema catalana is mentioned . 
  it 's a national treasure , like spaghetti for italians . 
  there 's no `` upgrading '' this . 
  and that 's why we 're pissed that you stole it !, 
  whatever , you version is bland and dull , does n't even taste of anything , so people are just missing out and that 's on you guys :p, 
  some people say that we 're talking about a [ canya ] ( http://www.pastissets.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/napolitana-de-xocolate-400x400.png ) and now it 's a croissant ? 
  dunno , we stole that too from the spaniards , do n't feel too bad !, 
  i was thinking more along the lines of creme brule\u00e9 , this crema catalana copycat of yours, 
  oh , you mean a `` canya '' ? 
  i could say * cuina * , but then again he 'd leave earth 's orbit due to triggering, 
  i mean , that 's what you get for stealing half of our `` cuisine '' :p, 
  huh , here down in catalonia we say `` xocolatina '', 
  catalan for example has quite a lot of dialects too !, 
  since it 's spoken in diferent regions ( apart from catalonia itself there 's val\u00e8ncia , southern france , balears , etc. ), 
  there 's a lot of dialects , which all follow an est/west divide , where all of the eastern are quite similar and the western too . 
  balear for exam sounds like medieval northern catalan , lleidat\u00e0 like someone who speaks like what is written on a text ( in the central - barcelona - dialect , closest to the standard , most `` e '' are read as `` a '' , which does n't happen in lleidat\u00e0 or valenci\u00e0 , one of the main differences in the east/west divide ) . 
  terra lliure was a joke compared to these though . 
  in the 90 ' they kidnapled a guy and shot him in the leg and that 's about it . 
  [ oh , here they even moved beyond the forests !, 
  oh , we did that too . 
  we destroyed our poor forests , public or private it did n't matter . 
  it stills happens sadly , so that 's why we 're trying to protect them . 
  actually almost everyone is * in favour * of the permit for that reason !, 
  did n't know people outside of catalonia had the mushroom craze too !, 
  here we have popular names for literally thousands of mushroom species , and the forests are so full of people that we 're starting to regulate it with permits !, 
  ops , my bad !, 
  you 're on point derrailing today eh ? 
  aaaaaaaaaaand i 'm done , for real, 
  ah i see , so even though you claim to have 2 degrees in periodism you do n't know the difference between neutral and objective and claim it to be `` semantics '' . 
  yeah , i 'm done , you 're hilarious, 
  i said neutral , not objective . 
  they 're not as biased as abc or ld and you know it , but keep being obtuse, 
  oh well , keep ignoring that i just casually mentioned the 4 more or less major neutral newspapers on spain and there 's still no link . 
  yeaaah , i do n't even know why i keep replying to you , mr. 2 degrees in journalism . 
  `` libertad digital '' is * supposedly * that too , so do n't expect me to value it much , i guess you found derrailing iv pretty fun right ? 
  anyway , have a nice day , bye !, 
  ehhhhh no , you just pulled that out of your ass , i just listed all of the major newspapers in spain that are more or less neutral . 
  they 're not '' . cat '' , but hey , keep on with the circlejerk . 
  nah , they 're biased beacause who but someone in arag\u00f3n would like to stir up shit about `` muh kingdom '' , and beacause the other two are among the shittiest and most right-wing ( aka , anti-catalan ) newspapers in spain . 
  el mundo , el peri\u00f3dico , el pa\u00eds o la vanguardia would be fine , but hey , what do i know ? 
  i 'm just down the rabbit hole , so that means that abc is obviously objective !, 
  gim me a break, 
  [ we do that too over here , in catalan !, 
  even if it 's more or less an add :p !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbahpnd2qjg ), 
  i mean , i want a reputable link . 
  `` el periodico de aragon '' is obviously biased against anything coming from catalonia and this does piss them off royaly , and what the hell is the heraldo ? 
  look , i do n't deny some people used the term , beacause obviously the crown was ruled from barcelona with a catalan dynasty and all so some people wanted to make the term represent it more . 
  it 's still wrong , but it never was majoritary . 
  it never `` got into the light '' , it 's a pretty old term . 
  spanish media made it viral a few years ago though , that 's true .
