   abc  libertad digital the crap that sells in madrid , not actual news  nova historia the crazy people i mentioned so , as i said , care to try again ? 
  i mean , it 's hard not to bring out paco when talking about how democracy is fucked in spain . 
  you * do * know how hard it is to change the constitution , so it 's a moot point . 
  i mean , i do have you at +43 :p ... 
  ohh !!!!!!!!, 
  what [ a happy coincidence indeed !, 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/a/pshi9 ) and i call you a troll beacause i really ca n't belive that someone would even belive half the crap you say , so it must be an `` inciendary '' hobby or you 're just a kid :p anyway , have a good night , i 've got actual stuff to do , have fun !, 
  given that i 've got you at around -49 ( now -50 ) in res and tagged as `` that hater '' , i 'm happy to know that you think that !, 
  this proves that idiotic trolls like you are consistent and i can ignore you no worries !, 
  have fun , * ejpa\u00f1olito * :p !, 
  funny how you call me an idiot for making a blanket statement about spaniards - regarding this thead , which you yourself can see - while making a blanket statement about all catalans just beacause . 
  you never dissapoint , keep it up ! ), 
  uhh no . 
  good politics is always about good democracy . 
  good democracy means respecting the right to vote , recognised by the onu in the human rights charter . 
  is it so hard to comprehend ? 
  why ? 
  you ( in general ) just did . 
  the 5 or 6 top-comments all have spanish flair and are the same standard deviation along the lines of `` booring '' , like it 's a circlejerk or something . 
  nuff said . 
  wtf ? 
  we do n't do that , we say corona d'arag\u00f3 . 
  there are crazy people everywhere , but they are n't the majority . 
  do n't belive the crap that sells in madrid . 
  also , the franja is obviously catalan speaking territory in arag\u00f3 , how is that a dispute ? 
  the fact that pp ignored them is the issue . 
  this is just random nonsense to derrail the conversation so i wo n't go more into it . 
  also , it 's not an exception . 
  the consitution is in violation of basic human rights , beacause the right of self-determination * is a recognised * human right by the onu . 
  so yeah , it 's just lack of political will , and everybody knows it , it 's so easy to put up excuses for something you do n't want to do , beacause most of spain still belives that * espa\u00f1a no se rompe * etc. 
  you are seeing now why dialogue with spaniards is ... complicated , to say the least, 
  i mean , we already have . 
  multiple times in fact . 
  it 's not like we 've tried to dialogue for about 4 years without result . 
   that is said on our constitution , in the second point to be more accurate . 
  well then , we 'll just have to ignore it ( trying not to be blunt here , but a `` fuck the constitution '' is warranted ) . 
  sad to see how democracy `` works '' in spain, 
  i did n't downvote you , in fact i 've got you at +6 says res . 
  i just gave you a very up-to-date example . 
  politicians have been threatened with inabilitation ( an erc senator , for example ) , our ex-president and two very important elected leaders have also been sent to trial for defending democracy etc. 
  no jail yet , but as you might know , [ there 's a precedent ] ( http://d1abj31dnwl5uq.cloudfront.net/imatges/35/73/alta/780_008_3573324_d7084b134c762749844a50306ee385a2.jpg ) ( he 's llu\u00eds companys , the president of catalonia at the time of franco , the only democractically elected president to be executed in all of europe 's modern history ) . 
  forcadell , the president of our parliment , was sent to trial just today , just as an example . 
  is `` operaci\u00f3n dialogo '' not working yet ? 
  but we 've jailed all of their democratically elected leaders !!, 
  edit : funny how spaniards all come in horde to claim that they do n't give a shit . 
  seems a little contradictory ^ ^ ^ ( triggered ? ), 
  i voted you beacause i opened the mods tab and res told me i upvoted you the most , so there we go , did n't even know you were a mod :p, 
  who is your favourite user ? ... myself ? 
  i just looked into a random thread and wrote who i upvoted . 
  [ ahhhh this classic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-0tw_lwans ), 
   invalidenparkeerplaats : parking space for disabled p\u00e0rking per discapacitats  invalide parkeerplaats : disabled parking space p\u00e0rking inv\u00e0lid , shorther than the compound  laagsteprijsgarantie : guarantee on the lowest prices preu m\u00ednim garantit ( though this is a phrase not a noun , so ... ? ), 
   laagste prijsgarantie : lowest guarantee on prices menor garantia en preus dunno , apart from the the phrases which of course ca n't be that summed up catalan is pretty quick . 
  we avoid a lot of unnecessary words , use tons of contractions ( n'hem de parlar-hi , se n'anir\u00e0 : we have to talk to him/her , she/he will go away ) and yeah , it might be though to learn for a foreigner , but i think it 's one of the most efficient romance languages there is . 
  [ in catalonia , at least for the coast , maybe this ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cw9drlhxwhq/maxresdefault.jpg ), 
  escuse mu\u00e0 ? 
  well of course !, 
  like any other language , we have dialects too !, 
  [ this is a simplified version ] ( http://blogs.cpnl.cat/cursoslabisbal/files/2012/11/mapa-dialectes-catal%c3%a02.jpg ) , but there 's a two way split in catalan/valencian , the occidental and oriental dialects , and the occidental is kinda closer to spanish . 
  i mean , catalan and valenci\u00e0 are the same language so ... kinda redundant there ? 
  also , why say it in spanish ? 
  it 's like i talked about franzosich by stating it in german ... 
  but yeah , catalan is very close to french and italian , and it 's the closest language to occitan alive !, 
  americans , they get ... confused :p, 
  i mean , se\u00f1orito is spanish though and the rest is english , there 's no catalan there ( it would be `` senyoret '' ) :p, 
  there 's melilla too, 
  `` bocadillos '' are dull . 
  come at me , se\u00d1orito, 
  bipartidism died in spain + we jusy had a year without a goverment which literally never happened . 
  plus here in catalonia we have our `` situation '' . 
  spain got smashed too, 
  i called the salary ( implied in context ) a joke , not the people , which have n't been mentioned . 
  where did you get that from ? 
  soooooo probably a troll . 
  have n't met someone so crazy irl, 
  a random `` catalonia is not spain '' with 0 context just feels like plain old trolling to me :p, 
  ... just tell me , do you really think we want to be represented by that account ? 
  really now . 
  i did n't say i thought it was a pp-propaganda user of course , i said it 'd be more likely if it was a propaganda user at all . 
  how is that propaganda ? 
  making us indepes look bad can only be pp-propaganda if anything , and i 'd call that trolling, 
  probably full of sand . 
  you know , it gets everywhere, 
  obviously , thatsthejoke.jpg, 
  [ not like that sandy tatooine ] ( http://gcwpongoldroad.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sevilla.jpg?0553d6 ), 
  [ every one of these fuckers that is n't wearing the green colour wants them to see fail * on the inside * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxld2krafum ) . 
  beacause it 's true , the castellers are a very very big family and nobody really wants anyone to get hurt . 
  but ... you know ... * el morbo *, 
  and actually very few collapse . 
  it 's just confirmation bias , beacause that 's what everybody wants to see :p, 
  if you just * knew * how low my magic internet points sometimes get * then * you 'd understand !, 
  ^ humph !, 
  it has everything you 'd want to see in a typical winter resort/bond movie setting : the frozen lake , spruce trees , tons of snow , mountains and that disctinct-but-not-really-strange architecture typical of winter resorts . 
  also only reachable by rack railway , for extra charm points .

  you ca n't escape it , and so ca n't i, 
  all of us catalans voting a spanish flair against an estelada ? 
  cmoooooooon i see another trend here :p, 
  ** but muh forecast !, 
  i like the 7 upvotes despite the comment being in ~ ~ catal\u00e0 ~ ~ valenci\u00e0 . 
  food for thought .
