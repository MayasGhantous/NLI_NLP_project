  n\u00faria is [ the ultimate winter resort , for those who do n't know about it ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/vall_de_n%c3%baria_nevada.jpg ), 
  shit , we need to donate more here in catalonia ... i guess do n't need this kidney ^ ( but i kinda do ... ), 
  i think so, 
   and i 'm santa claus . 
  well , we ca n't all be good builders i guess , someone has to bring the presents :p . spain has the best architectural curriculum in the world , anyone in the industry will tell you that . 
  we are n't just trained to design , we 're trained to calculate structures and oversee the whole construction process . 
  that 's one of the main key differences . 
   that 's very simple when you compare it them to other building standards . 
  such as ? 
  the ones they build in france are much simpler than ours , they do fill them in completely . 
  also ... it 's not a `` building standard '' , just a constructive technique . 
  a name that we give to a type of fa\u00e7ade , it varies quite a lot depending on the site . 
   due to bureaucracy no doubt . 
  nope . 
  due to having the most modern constuction industry in the world . 
  that 's why it 's being copied all over the world . 
  ^ ( fuck your stereotypes , i did n't call the netherlands a swamp )  the rest would be tougher as well due to the climate . 
  cold and moist require a whole different build up of walls , with glassfiber , pyrofoam , moisture barriers , cavity spaces , heated walls etc. 
  when you look at a home in the south they 're mostly just solid walls . 
  that 'd be the case 100 years ago , with the eixample housing units in barcelona ( though they were modern by their time too anyway ) . 
  here we have to worry about ventilation , acoustic insulation ( very strict regulation in cities ) that contradicts ventilation and thermic insulation that contradicts both ( air , a good thermic insulator is a horrible sound insulator etc etc ) . 
  the simplest and most common solution [ are ventilated fa\u00e7ades ] ( http://www.greenbuildingfactory.com/images/1411576483.jpg ) , which are anything * but * simple . 
  well , we do have the most complex construction code in the world , so i would n't call it simpler :p but yeah , i imagine that at least foundation work in the netherlands has to be quite though at least . 
  yes , the humidity from the ground usually kills the bottom floors of a wooden house . 
  i imagine it 'd be bad for this too , but elevating it would be a very good solution and i imagine it must be pretty lightweight . 
  here in the south they 're by far the most common roofing . 
  their protective layers are way stronger than the ones these guys will probably use . 
  obviously , but it what i 'm saying is that it seems pretty sketchy, 
  first rule about data in construction : never trust the guy who 's trying to sell it . 
  horizontal roofs with about 5-10cm of layers of that stuff wo n't last 15 years and yes , it has to sustain much more damage due to its shape but still , i do n't belive * cardboard * lasts longer . 
  `` of course , the key problem with any product made of cardboard is water . 
  to protect the house from the elements , the exterior is wrapped in a water-resistant , breathable foil . '', 
  so basically , you 'll be spending 30,000 $ every 5-10 years or so . 
  also , cardboard is a * horrible * acustic insulator , so maybe try to find the quietest place in earth to place it . 
  they 're pretty though , i 'll give them that . 
  `` life '', 
  i mean , they have to grow them in the pyrenees the poor bastards, 
  probably the weirdest idiom in catalan is `` n'hi ha per llogar-hi cadires ! '', 
  ( this is worth renting chairs for !, 
  ) , which means that something is very remarcable, 
  [ that was in the 20 ] ( http://www.fondationlecorbusier.fr/corbuweb/morpheus.aspx?sysid=13&amp;irisobjectid=6159&amp;syslanguage=en-en&amp;itempos=2&amp;itemcount=2&amp;sysparentname=home&amp;sysparentid=65 ) and yes , it would 've . 
  he is ... 
  repetitive to say the least, 
  they 're both great , but different . 
  very hard to compare, 
  / r/badarchitecture i guess, 
  and then retracted and hated the idea . 
  your idea of a city did n't actually exist back then , it was full of tuberculosis, 
  do n't really understand how you surived , with the modeling knives and all :p, 
  i dunno what you 're talking about , but they 're public over here . 
  you ca n't supress ideas in a democracy , it 'll die out naturally, 
  ... the `` experience music project '' , or [ emp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emp_museum?wprov=sfla1 ), 
  i can tell you for a fact that academia adores him though . 
  well but that 's the point . 
  that church was designed specifically for that place , and not for any other . 
  good architects adapt to the situation . 
  beacause that 's how the city looked like to him and everyone else , the car was the future !, 
  you 're judging him out of his time . 
  and btw , he ended up hating that model anyway . 
  and he himself ended up hating it . 
  he did not expect the massive speculative use it would get , though true radiant cities are veeeery rare actually . 
  it 's called a vault , it 's typical catalan architecture and very common in places where wood is not as available as clay . 
  maybe you 're not used to it , but it 's very efficient termically speaking, 
  it 's traditional catalan architecture , hundreds of years old , and he copied it . 
  so it 's definetely old , if that 's what you like, 
  hahahahaahah not really , for the last one he copied a type of vault traditional in catalonia , and the rest are more along his style , beacause the * huge concrete block * was actually something he ended up hating himself . 
  it 's a typical catalan vault which le corbusier liked . 
  the third one is chandriga 's nonsense , he basically built an entire city in india out of nothing , and that 's why there 's huuuge buildings like those . 
  they 're alright , i 've seen worse things and given the period in which they were built they 're great . 
  you ca n't just judge his buildings comparing them to modern standards * since he basically invented those * , we 've had almost a century to develop them . 
  ah yeah , but that 's the * bad part * . 
  here in the continent that was justified beacause the cities it meant to replace were actually shit/destroyed by ww2 , and not just a happy excuse for mass speculation . 
  and btw , he was right in that regard , but the notion of the city that we understand today literally did n't exist then , so we are judging him without his context , which is pretty unfair . 
  the last one is horrid too ? 
  c'mon , you 're just hating, 
  [ i mean , this is le corbusier too ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/17/62/c3/1762c3c4ff2de1468d5ae98d5819f20b.jpg ) [ pic2 ] ( http://images.adsttc.com/media/images/55e6/430e/4d8d/5d9a/1500/0334/large_jpg/1288285438-ronchamp-roryrory-1000x750.jpg?1441153801 ) , [ and this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/fd/6f/cb/fd6fcba00638b7e99978a617f64fd389.jpg ) , and [ this ] ( http://www.institutfrancais.es/valencia/adjuntos/5_maison_jaoul_corbusier_neuilly_sur_seine_paris.jpg ) , but people just see random soviet blocks that have pretty much nothing to do with him and say `` uhhh hurrr durr le corbusier , i hate him ! '' . 
  it 's like saying einstein was responsible for the atomic bomb , basically . 
  equally destructive , in fact . 
  nah , starchitects gave us a bad name . 
  as bad as corbusier 's shit is , [ it will never reach gehry levels of bad ] ( http://c1038.r38.cf3.rackcdn.com/group1/building2495/media/ndps_1.jpg ) . 
  also , corbusier was the fucking best * in his context * . 
  obivously he seems bad today , but that 's pretty unfair , something that everyone here seems to ignore . 
  just wan na point out , my entire body of theachers would send you all heathens to the gulag . 
  corbu is god in architecture schools and no one dares question him . 
  spain regularly hits -15 / -20 in many areas though, 
  saragossa and andalusia are the catalan names too , maybe they come from there, 
  weell leeet 's just say someone got a little bit carried away in eu4, 
  it 's entirely paid by donations since its inception ( it 's a expiatory temple ) . 
  yeah yeah . 
  although an avenue with no city along it is pretty weird but still . 
  well , but if you get technical the diagonal really does n't end , it just turns into the b-23 road . 
  you 're absolutely right !, 
  there 's signs in all of these reference points that mention this . 
  de les means `` of the '' ( though in femenine plural ) , so in catalan it would the `` grand way of the catalan courts '' . 
  is `` des '' in french the equivalent to that ? 
  yeah , the main 3 avenues in barcelona are the gran via ( de les corts catalanes ) - which is the one paralel to the sea - , the diagonal and the meridiana ( which is also very long but is n't as straight as the other two for urbanistic reasons that i can explain but it 's a bit long i think . 
  they all meet up in pla\u00e7a de les gl\u00f2ries which is that big round thing in the center-right . 
  only diagonal and meridiana are still big car avenues , the gran via is more of a boulevard even though it still has a lot of car lanes . 
  [ the diagonal is long as fuck , it divides barcelona in two ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_bffjcdvr2ey/s-hzrk_2bwi/aaaaaaaapgy/sxaw3aqukhk/s1600/070518-l-eixample-i-la-diagonal-de-barcelona-21861.jpg ), 
  `` everyone '' is a fallacious argument so hey .
