  it is a way of putting its authoritarian past and the weak foundations of the regime established in 1978 behind it , becoming a model for the defence of its own diversity and a guarantee of democratic principles within its borders . 
  catalonia would like to be a key partner for spain , whether its citizens decide to remain a part of it or they choose to become an independent state . 
  but whatever the relationship , spain must advance in democratic terms and in the rule of law ; it is an unavoidable issue for its future . 
  this step forward , therefore , represents a triple opportunity : for catalonia , for spain and for europe . 
  #teamandorra ( til we get our own in the euros ), 
  obviously !, 
  that 's why we 're doing this referendum !, 
  perhaps . 
  but i agree with this particular comment . 
  here we go , this is it !, 
  democracy will triumph in catalonia finally !, 
  ... oh god why , somehow my mind had blocked the fact that camela existed ...

  they still wreck parties the fuckers . 
   what was his actual profession , if he was n't an architect ? 
  he was an urbanist , the first of his kind !, 
  also , he was an engineer , but you must understand , it 's the xixth century that we 're talking about . 
  engineering and architecture were very much intertwined in certain countries such as spain ( and still are , btw. , much more than in america for example . 
  architects are often praised for being `` good engineers '' ) . 
   i am interested in this field , but when i apply to architecture programs , i 'm always told there is no room for creativity because you have to design whatever the jackass client tells you to . 
  but what 's the point of being an architect if you are not an architect of urban affairs ? 
  there 's a lot of room for creativity , the entire degree is spent designing with a lot of freedom !, 
  again , degrees vary * a lot * on a country by country basis , the school of barcelona is very very very tecnical ( 6 year degree instead of 4 years , only 2 years of hand-drawing subjects , a lot of structures and installations , etc. ) . 
  as i see it , architecture is just coming up with the best solution that your client wants . 
  meeting up the requirements is just the basics , architecture is also what you offer as a plus . 
  urbanism nowadays is a branch of architecture that tackles well ... the biggest creations humankind has ever made , the cities . 
  as such , it has to have a `` broader '' lense , it does n't usually focus on details but on general plans , and it needs architects to execute the buildings and parks that are comissioned in a general plan . 
   my goal , specifically , is to put barcelonas and copenhagens and parises all over the earth , especially in the us where we are in desperate need of them as the overwhelming majority of our cities are parking lots . 
  well , aim for the stars !, 
  car culture is very ingrained in the us , so unless public transport is heavily encouraged you 'll have a hard job with that . 
  look up `` la plata '' , in argentina . 
  it may be an example of what you 're looking for . 
   what job can i get where i can actually make decisions and influence how a city is built ? 
  so traditionally here in catalonia architects mingled a lot in politics , one of the most famous modernist architects was our president too !, 
  ( [ josep puig i cadafalch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/josep_puig_i_cadafalch ) , better check this translation , the english version does n't mention [ his political work ] ( https://translate.google.cat/translate?sl=ca&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ca&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fca.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fjosep_puig_i_cadafalch&amp;edit-text= ) ) . 
  though what you 're looking up to be is more along the lines of [ oriol bohigas ] ( https://translate.google.cat/translate?hl=ca&amp;sl=ca&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fca.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2foriol_bohigas_i_guardiola ) . 
  i do n't know how much wikipedia mentions his urbanistic work , but he basically renovated barcelona once he got to lead the urbanism department of the town hall . 
  until him , only the center was `` decent '' , whereas the periphery had worse-looking everything . 
  one of his core tennets is that even the poorests of districts must have the same trash cans as the richest . 
  he reformed the center , planning squares , streets , expanded the west side of the city with new boroughs and coordinated the biggest growth in the city that the olympics of 92 needed , and it was a complete success . 
  nowadays fewer cities can boast of a bigger success in their olympics than barcelona . 
  [ here it says it 's about 6h19 ' ] ( http://www.renfe.com/viajeros/larga_distancia/productos/avefrancia/index.html ) . 
  i remember macron saying that you guys needed to finish off your part i belive . 
  connection with girona when ? 
  i wan na go to paris in record time !, 
  urbanism is a though mistress :p, 
  oh , there 's no degree of urbanism , i study architecture , but urbanism is one of the core subjects , especially in my school ( it varies a lot ) . 
  you can do a masters course and get licensed as an urbanist too when you finish your degree , and work on well , urbanism stuff ( street renovations , parks , urban expansion , town hall work etc ) . 
  beacause it 's a desert , i actually did an entire semester about poblenou 's shenanigans and it 's like it 's another city . 
  average density in a normal illa is about 2000 people , whereas poblenou has 400 . 
  that 's why superilles there are pointless . 
  plus it 's the less residential of all of the residential districts in the city . 
  do you have the link ? 
  imho the idea itself is n't bad , the implementation is . 
  they basically installed them wherenever there was no need for them ( they are needed in high-density areas where lots of people are in the street , not in the middle of industrial-abandoned poblenou ! ), 
  and really did n't think much about social services and transport and those silly things . 
  a friend of mine was tasked with `` improving '' one of the superilles , which basically meant painting a bit the street and puting a few pots and plants . 
  it all seems so rushed and improvised , just to say that `` they did it '' . 
  sorry for having a cool city :p !, 
  copenhague should be posted a lot too , they 're building great buildings over there right now !, 
  ^ ( all hail big ! ), 
  that 's a good perspective to have as an architect actually !, 
  sometimes planners forget about the whole `` living in it '' thing and just draw neat grids for their cities !, 
  actually , all of the competitors that the guy who designed this grid had did that , so that 's partly why he won :p !, 
  oh good luck !, 
  where are you stuying if i may ask ? 
  and yes , he 's kinda ... the corbu + mies + wright of urbanism . 
  not even haussman comes close :p, 
  so we do n't call cerd\u00e0 the father of urbanism for nothing . 
  he planned * every single possible crossing , street , sewer line connection , train station , modification , block , etc. 
  * ( at a urban scale of course , details were left for architects ) . 
  the idea was to create a `` garden city '' , that 's why there 's * basically * no parks ( apart from la ciutadella and some others which never got built ) , the parks * were * the city . 
  speculation got rid of that . 
  the blocks were designed to be combinable into 4 by 4 blocks ( superilles actually , but well done ) to accomodate for bigger services such as hospitals ( which has been done with the cl\u00ednic or sant pau ) . 
  the pla cerd\u00e0 is the oldest urban plan still active i belive !, 
  though it has had a looooot of modifications of course . 
  what can i say , if it ai n't broke do n't fix it . 
  [ obviously not , this is the original plan ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/placerda1859b.jpg/500px-placerda1859b.jpg ) . 
  between this one and the pl\u00e0 general metropolit\u00e0 ( the one we 've got now ) there have been thousands of different plans , some of which even tried to go against the one cerd\u00e0 proposed !, 
  but ultimately all of them were just successors of his , including the current one . 
  this is due to what you 're saying , it 's easily expandable and it allows for a lot of different urban growths within it . 
  designed at once but we 're still under the cerd\u00e0 plan , and the last blocks were n't finished until i think the 90 ' !, 
  so that 's about 130 years of project !, 
  no , the grid is paralel to the coast . 
  [ zoom in on this image , you 'll see it ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/placerda1859b.jpg/1200px-placerda1859b.jpg ) !, 
  it was made this way in order to pierce the old towns ( of which there were a lot of ) , join the grid and the old city of barcelona better ( since the old town ran perpencidular to coast , the streets of the grid that would pierce it would be few and important instead of a lot of them - paral \u00b7 lel , rambles and laietana were the 3 main connecting streets - ) and also , if the grid was paralel to coast expansion toward the bes\u00f2s river ( today 's limit of the city , way west of the old town ) was easier . 
   the major artery runs through the grid at an angle , would n't it have made more sense to fit the road to the grid or the other way around ? 
  the two planned diagonal streets that you can see in this photo are diagonal avenue ( which cuts the grid in half in a diagonal , heh ) and gaud\u00ed 's avenue ( which starts at the sagrada fam\u00edlia ) . 
  diagonal is probably the most important street in the city beacause it allows deep penetration of transit into the city core , effectively being one of the two main arteries of the city ( the other is meridiana , guess why it 's called that ) and togheter with meridiana is where trains were supposed to come into the center . 
  and about gaud\u00ed 's avenue . 
  well , it 's due to the fact that architects at the early xxth century did n't like cerd\u00e0 's plan , they though it was too `` strict '' and `` unsighty '' . 
  [ le\u00f3n jaussely was tasked with an improvement ] ( http://historyofbarcelona.weebly.com/uploads/4/8/1/1/48119689/6697265.png?692 ) and togheter with gaud\u00ed himself they worked on how to improve the sagrada familia 's location within the existing grid , creating this avenue . 
  it 's one of the few streets that would come out of that plan , due to the phase-out of modernisme and being replaced with other plans , such as ... well ... [ this one ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bffqqctcyaadj9w.jpg ) . 
  [ le corbusier kinda got here too , through local architects that copied his movement , though only one of these units was ever built due to the civil war ] ( http://www.fondationlecorbusier.fr/corbucache/900x720_2049_1697.jpg?r=0 ), 
  [ check my comment , you 're right , it 's remmnants !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6ftcx2/barcelona_from_the_sky/dil331h/ ), 
  i study urbanism and cerd\u00e0 , the guy who designed the eixample and father of modern urbanism , is a staple if you 're a student of this in barcelona . 
  what happened was that the owners of the plots of land were farmers , and the canals and small rivers that flowed along the old roads of what was once farmland basically created these divisions . 
  it 's especially noticiable in the poblenou district , where water-intensive agriculture was practicaded and as such , there are waaaay more diagonal streets and buildings too , since they had to be built inside of the pre-existing plots , obviously : even if the grid itself was octogonal , the plots inside the octogon followed weird shapes due to the laws of the time , which were essentially the first modern plot redistribution attempt ever ; they converted the small farms and crops typical of water intensive cultivation into more or less urbanizable zones . 
  on the other hand , the `` normal '' eixample had less-water intensive agriculture ( which meant that farmers had bigger plots to farm on , so less anomalies beacause the grid could be better accomodated ) and exceptions to the rule were usually , as i mentioned , old rivers , roads , pre-existing towns and constructions and obviously calculated diagonal streets ( which there 's about 3 in total in the entire city or so i think ) .
