  besides , we can see that areas colonized by aragon in la reconquesta are way more spanish than the catalan ones , and it seems like the aragonese culture has been eroded a lot more than the catalan , due to frontiers probably , so aragonese feel fully spanish and a bit aragonese , since the creation of the autonomias has somewhat created an artificial feeling of belonging to a long nonexisting ( or sometimes invented ) region . 
  ( aragon is both a kingdom and an autonomia in spain , due to historical resasons and the pope ), 
  i know i think the same . 
  but the thing is that we 're tired . 
  and pretty much pissed off , so we 're doing the easy thing , and more or less it works, 
  my bad , yes , it 's the eastern . 
  well , they are pretty much spanish since a long ago , probably being one of the first `` regions '' that lost it 's native language to castilian . 
  that does n't deter them from putting aragonese flags everywhere and claiming to have ruled us all, 
  oh , come on !, 
  you * know * what i mean , we 're a different culture than castille or mexico or whatever and we 're tired about tourists not being able to differenciate, 
  yeah ok , when you are plagued by barretines in the middle of madrid and people start singing songs of lluis llach with estelades in hand for no reason you tell me . 
  barcelona is a fucking themepark and we 're tired of it . 
  ( this is pretty much stereotypical ) aragonese : envious pricks who want to ban or reduce our language in their most westernmost provinces . 
  valencians : idiots who for some reason vote pp and for the most part hate catalan ? 
  or at least call catalan valencian and tell us that it is another language - pp stunt - ( it 's not , every single linguist there agrees on that ) . 
  they * love * to use us as scapegoats balears : probably where most aragonese influence remained just after catalonia , but even then pp reigns there , so they are trying to ban or reduce catalan from the schools and things like that . 
  ^ their ^ accent ^ is ^ so ^ funny . 
  they make [ ensaimades ] ( http://estaticos.qdq.com/swdata/photos/199/199558323/cff5c8e3f1a5474786392d04d2e5f711.jpg ) and [ sobrassada ] ( http://www.firesifestesdemallorca.com/wp-content/uploads/fira-de-sa-sobrassada-campos-2013.jpg ) which are delicious and seem to be plagued by germans and hippies, 
  i was referring as in why they would be assholes for not identifying with spain , because this oftentimes is a common issue , but i get we 're you 're coming from ( of course i 'm against bullfighting , we 've banned it here ), 
  of course it 's full of it !, 
  what do you think a guiri wants when he arrives here ? 
  fuck no !, 
  luckily enough , we 're banning the most offensive stuff , like sevillana dresses , mexican hats ( belive it or not , 5 years ago the streets were plagued by them ) and toros and such . 
  it 's just all the faul of the people that come here , do n't inform themselves of where they are going and belive that this is some sort of spanish theme park, 
  [ la sardana ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf0yo3jlx24 ) ( ok , this is more normal when dancing [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akiru_lycb4 ) ), 
  what ? 
  for respecting their culture and learning that in spain there is more than one culture ? 
  i 've heard friends trowing fireworks and shit when spain lost this year , but for me the best thing was being able to sleep . 
  i live in a very spanish area of the country and sadly they are n't known for their hability to be quiet , so losing matches and all that helps a lot . 
  so i 'd say it depends on the region of catalonia you are in . 
  what would you drink in the caribean ? 
  vodka or tequila ? 
  sagria is something that we never drink here , is just like that !, 
  only tourists drink it , they think it 's traditional from here or some bullshit when it has never been, 
  point being , we do n't do this crap here . 
  at all, 
  change basque with catalan and you 've got us aswell . 
  also , we really hate everything having to do with bulls , sangria , sevillanas , siesta and such . 
  those words exist only because `` guiris '' ( what * we * call you when we see you on the streets - some sort of `` idiot '' reserved for most of the tourists - ) do n't even know where are they going on vacation and think that they are on andaluc\u00eda or some shit . 
  tl ; dr : [ this ] ( http://www.perforpromos.com/img/resina/resina03.jpg ) is an aberration . 
  ** please ** try to learn something about catalonia before coming here , we 're starting to get really pissed off, 
  going to nyc in seven days , first time going to america , this just brightens up my mood, 
  we are not spanish and no , siesta sangria sevillana is not part of our vocabulary , not even our language . 
  people are starting to get pissed off, 
  ... because it might be true ? 
  obviously , but then again , it 's better when bad things do n't happen right ? 
  oh , because it 's better not confessing and saying that nothing like that happened , a la * hispaniola ? 
  i 'd love to see that ... 
  but with all this crisis i pretty much doubt that something like that would be high on someones pritority list sadly, 
   germany was willing to pay 45 % of the mission costs , but all other members refused to pay the other 55 % . 
  until people learn that investing in science is good and that short-term investments are n't always the best solution we wo n't see an out of this problem . 
  spacex has for example marked a plan ( probably not really doable , am i wrong in supposing this ? ), 
  to launch a manned flight to mars . 
  they do n't have the tech nor the money , but they try to achieve them , and this perspective is something that i think esa lacks and it 's hurting them , sadly, 
  uh huh ... 
  i hoped that we would be able to do it for ourselves , but i guess that 's more funds for the mission itself and not the rockets and infraestructure ( maybe how the indians did it ? ) . 
  also , is the fact that guayana is the main spaceport and the flexibility of arianne6 why esa can launch larger satellites with fewer max payload ? 
  but then again , were n't they planning to send an unmanned probe to mars ? 
  i 'm guessing that they 'll have to use ariane 5 for that right ? ... 
  also , reading that article just tells me that ariannespace is kinda fucked, 
  thanks !, 
  then the only reason for the arianne5 to still function is to launch heavy satellites, 
  it is the final delivery because their contract to do so has ended right ? 
  yet you just cherrypicked the ones that proved your point . 
  remember also that catalonia and madrid are densely populated , a lot more than others and so while there is a lot of kids bailing out , there are also a lot that continue, 
  that 's a really simplified understanding of the problem , but i can see why you would think that, 
  faith does wonders i guess , * beliveeee !, 
  beliveeee !, 
  * also , the northen parts of spain have decent rates of education in general , and there 's more people living there ( + madrid ) than in the south , were * i think * around 25 % of students bailed out, 
  beautiful ? 
  yes . 
  that 's disputable , it 's a choir ( and not an easy one ) song , no wonder it 's the orfe\u00f3 catal\u00e0 anthem ( our national choir ) and it would be bordering impossible for people to sing it, 
  ours is called `` the reapers '' . 
  is you scared for life ? 
  it comes from a popular song about ... ^ whores from the xvi century that someone liked and changed the lyrics many times until in the xix an anarchist made the definitive [ song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-bdn3zih2w ) . 
  i like it , it has an `` anthem-y '' feel and makes a lot of indirect references , which is common on our culture and is written on a minor scale , which i have always liked . 
  [ the wikipedia article may have a better translation of the lyrics , by the way ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/els_segadors ), 
  i really doubt that he himself could say that in english, 
  we fought really hard for it , but i guess that we ca n't have everything ( just like you 've got your fiscal pacts and fueros ) unless ... ^ independence ? 
  ^ why ^ would ^ we ^ want ^ that ? 
  [ have another one ] ( http://virtline.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/vote-el-presidente-tropico3.jpg ), 
  well ... not international roles , but spain 's `` internal affairs '' ( i.e. 
  our referendum ) lately tend to be rather * external * . 
  which is ok for us but quite hypocrital when spain forces world leaders ( read merkel , cameron , etc. ), 
  to speak against us in this `` internal affair '' or so they claim it to be, 
  thanks rajoy !, 
  no it is n't , they want to force us to go bilingual but we 're still resisting . 
  at the moment we 're doing all classes in catalan except spanish and english , so we have 3 languages at once . 
  when you reach 3rd of eso ( i think it 's around 14yo or so ) you can pick and extra language . 
  of course not !, 
  we 're just a bunch of rocks drifting trouhght space for milenia upon milenia !, 
  ehh i went to sweeden and i was kinda disappointed ... maybe i was expecting something different from what stockholm is but i found it quite dull ( seriously , the best thing you 've got is a sunken ship inside a museum ... 
  i mean it 's * good * but not that good ) norway on the other hand is ~ ~ so expensive than even a swiss might go bankrupt ~ ~ amazing !, 
  you have the cities and architecture of the sweedes ( plus a complete wooden town in bergen ) and the fjords !, 
  i know that sometimes bayern is considered another country , if i had to pick where would i choose to be born in ~ ~ norway ~ ~ bayern would be that place . 
  m\u00fcnchen especially is an amazing city . 
  yup , alemanys for us , even if we share quite a bit of language togheter ( when i was learning deutsch i was really surprised with this ), 
  curious , i have n't heard this opposing stance from spain , instead hearing germany really reluctant . 
  could someone pass me an article about this spanish thing ? 
  ha , that does n't surprise me much !,
