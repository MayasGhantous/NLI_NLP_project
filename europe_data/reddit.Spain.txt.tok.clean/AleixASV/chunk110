  just like the cam . 
  banks are cheap these days ( if you 're another bank of course ) . 
  it 's the flagship of the holy league that won the battle of lepant against the ottomans , built in the same place you see this replica now ( the royal dockyards in barcelona ), 
  [ we 've got more modern stuff too ] ( https://santpol.cat/sites/default/files/pailebot_general.jpg ) , but the one i linked before is a full replica of the flagship of the coalition that won in lepant sooooo it 's kinda famous and things ( and it looked like [ this ] ( http://www.terradetrobadors.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/galera-reial.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ylrhig3unqk/vcte3astigi/aaaaaaaadgo/d496amxbr2o/s1600/galera%2bla%2breal%2bde%2bferre%2bclauzel.jpg ) ) .

  [ him , kinda ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6fkcf8/today_73_years_ago_was_the_dday_in_normandy/diivha0/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=europe ) , he [ does n't even acknowledge we exist ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6fkcf8/today_73_years_ago_was_the_dday_in_normandy/diivghl/ ) . 
  it 's implied though , that d-day `` saved '' europe from fascism . 
  except it did n't , and nevertheless i think a reminder is warranted , especially toward those nations that forsake the help the republic requested . 
   it 's obviously subjective . 
  but if you find madrid 's food , museums and atmosphere boring then you 're probably boring , too i mean , i just told you that i * actually like * those things , and that 's why i mentioned them . 
  other than that , there 's not much to do in madrid compared to barcelona ( if it was n't obvious , i 've been there several times * and i do n't hate it alright ? 
  * it 's hard to sustain a discussion with someone like you who just bashes stereotypes against people like that )  i love barcelona but i value ambience too much to want to go back anymore . 
  it sucks . 
  but still , there 's only tourists in touristy areas , and barcelona is bigger than that . 
  but not bigger than madrid , you 're right actually . 
  beacause madrid is boring as fuck ? 
  the only good thing they have is the museums and the royal palace if you 're into that . 
  the food , too . 
  ( i wo n't get into a silly discussion with you , but the link i gave you just lists international indexes of economic evaluation so they have nothing to do with what position the city has achieved . 
  funny how you already try to `` prove '' that we are n't under an spanish chokehold even though it 's an accepted fact , but hey , keep on keeping on . ), 
  not to op directly , but to all of the people claiming that `` europe was saved '' . 
  indeed . 
  here 's hoping at least us more in the northernmost parts of the med will get a softened blow . 
  we 'll have to invest [ into some better retro-thrusters ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xvmlciimw3k/ufbkgmqayyi/aaaaaaaab1m/timhoy1evjy/s1600/catalunya_independent-copia.jpg ) and fly over to the north !, 
  ^ ( we can take you guys over there too :p ), 
  a sunny and happy day in fascist spain . 
  good timing for a few executions . 
  nope . 
  nope nope nope, 
   madrid is the biggest and most important city in all of the iberian peninsula . 
  barcelona is bigger , sorry to disapoint . 
  madrid is kinda irrelevant , even compared to european capitals . 
  [ you can compare here ] ( http://www.barcelonaglobal.com/why-barcelona/city-rankings ) . 
  as you can see , madrid gets outranked in almost all categories . 
   you assume that companies choose madrid over barcelona based on support from the government , instead of just ... you know ... choosing the most central and biggest location . 
  no , actually companies choose barcelona and amazon locating their logistic base here last month was the lattest example . 
  this post also is proof of that . 
  we 're connected via train , sea and air and have better position in relation to europe than madrid . 
  we 're also way more attractive as a city and as i said , are a bigger city . 
  the only thing we lack of course , is the artificial boost of the central goverment , but we 'll solve that really quickly , do n't you worry , 
   which is very very normal for multiple cities within the same area to dispute . 
  yeah no . 
  it is n't for cities of the same state to dispute , especially to the point of suing . 
  also , i just picked the mwc beacause it was the first to come up in google , i 'm sure there 's more examples . 
   yet the olympics were obviously not a case of favoritism , that was just deserved . 
  obviously . 
  and why would n't it be exactly ? 
  are you maybe part of the olympic comitee that picked it ? 
  nah , the trumpers do n't post sources , the trumpers are the ones that go `` ahhhh fallacy ! '', 
  and make #thesecomments just like some of these gents . 
  ah yes , beacause we 're an inert object tossed into space with no attractive qualities at all and how come we can achieve anything at all ?!, 
  holy shit, 
  no , i assume madrid would not have the extra suport of the central goverment . 
  i ca n't complain beacause we do have it , obviously . 
  and if madrid got it beacause they truly proposed a better alternative i also would n't . 
  but somehow i ca n't really belive there would be no interference . 
  the hand that gives also can take . 
  is it legitimate for the city of madrid to try to undermine a city of the same state to bring congresses for itself ? 
  they can do it , that 's for sure , but first people here deny that they do at all and second it 's pretty dirty . 
  i also brought up the point that the central goverment is strangling barcelona 's airport , restricting the number of international flights allowed , which nobody even mentions . 
   in an independent catalonia it would be madrid + spanish government against barcelona + catalonia see , beacause what i mentioned before and other arguments against the central goverment ( such as operaci\u00f3n catalu\u00f1a , lack of fullfilment of investment , etc ) i actually do n't think they 're neutral and i do n't trust them . 
  so i think we 'd be better off independent . 
  [ this article explains it better . 
  i tried to find it in spanish but it obviously does n't exist ] ( https://translate.google.cat/translate?sl=ca&amp;tl=es&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ca&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.media.cat%2fanuari%2fles-27-lleis-catalanes-empantanegades-al-constitucional%2f&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) . 
   of course . 
  it 's the central government to which those laws try to devolve competencies in a unnegociated way . 
  there are at least two parties in a trial ... nothing new . 
  the tc is currently just a weapon of the spanish state . 
  there is absolutely no division of powers : if pp orders to have a certain law revoked , tc will do it . 
  and you know this is true . 
   you are speculating , please bring facts . 
  who is being prosecuted ? 
  why ? 
  which european country has acted differently in the past ? 
  have you been living under a rock ? 
  artur mas ( expresident ) , carme forcadell ( president of the catalan parliment ) , francesc homs ( diputado ) , etc. 
   which european country has acted differently in the past ? 
  the uk just a few years ago . 
  except letter for letter laws have been passed by other communities without any condemnation . 
  you are aware that the one sending our democratically elected laws to the tc is n't the generalitat yes ? 
  and i 'm not even getting into the fact that most of our politicians are being prosecuted for allowing debates or consultations , which in any other european country just for suggesting this they 'd laugh at your face and call you a fascist . 
  oh , but you 're assuming that the tc is neutral , which of course it is n't . 
  that 's why it was given the power to enforce its sentences , bringing it dangerously close to a political player of its own and breaking what little semblance of separation of powers spain had ( that 's why the state has already been warned by other international bodies beacause of this ) . 
   if your laws get intercepted by the constitutional court is just because ... they are not constitutional ... by the way , the catalan government also sues the central government when they think that those laws are non constitutional and against their interests yes , to show how hypocritical the tc is in its sentences . 
  oh , but do n't worry , we all know how the law against energetic poverty is inconstitutional , after all if it came from separanazi land it must be , right ? 
  fucking ban it !, 
  it 'd be arrogance if it was false . 
  but it is n't , i have sources below ( from the most trusted newspapers in spain ) , which explains the downvotes , some jimmies were rustled . 
  also , `` catalonese '' does n't exist , it 's `` catalan '' . 
  damm romans and their invasive species !, 
   disadvantage ? 
  which one ? 
  catalonia has more devolved matters than madrid ... yeeeeeahhhhh sure buddy . 
  that 's why any law we pass can be ( and is ) intercepted by the tc . 
  to deny that madrid gets preferential treatment from the central goverment is just pure brainwashing . 
  ... so you 're admiting that madrid is trying to bid against our congresses , which is my point ? 
  man , yep , you 're hilarious . 
  some sources please ?
