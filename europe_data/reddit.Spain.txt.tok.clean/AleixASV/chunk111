  i 'd also like to see how the links i posted are wrong too , since they 're direct statements from politicians and written by trusted newspapers . 
  or are you still ignoring them ? 
   guys you really have to man up and hold your shit together ... of course . 
  in an independent catalonia this stuff would obviously not happen , since there would be no disadvantadge against the capital of the state . 
  so i just linked you how madrid wants to steal the mobile world congress from barcelona ( our biggest congress ) and you do n't even acknowledge it . 
  holy shit you 're delusional , is shouting `` fallacy '' your only argument ? 
  oh really ? 
  [ here 's one of their ( failed ) attemtps ] ( https://translate.google.cat/translate?sl=ca&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ca&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fcat.elpais.com%2fcat%2f2017%2f02%2f06%2fespana%2f1486388010_587789.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) . 
  here 's [ another failed attempt ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/local/madrid/20160224/302395918353/cifuente-madrid-arrebatar-mobile-congres.html ) . 
   fallacy : being pro-independence does n't mean you think `` spain steals from us '' . 
  do n't use fallacies to try to debate , please : / you were the one who mentioned the `` spain steals from us '' , i did n't say that or mention that you siphon 15000m $ per year ( 8 % of our gdp ) off of us , which is where that argument comes from ( which btw is very well documented and even accepted by madrid ) . 
  so you 'd be the one engaging with fallacies . 
   you guys are terrible , no one outside catalonia ( and inside , most ) believes that anymore , because it 's simply false . 
  oh really ? 
  huh , i wonder if there was a way we could prove what you 're saying to be false !, 
  [ oops i 've seem to have dropped a link to a certain newspaper !, 
  ] ( https://translate.google.cat/translate?sl=ca&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ca&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ara.cat%2feconomia%2fnorwegian-comencaria-mateix-barcelona-toquio_0_1801020055.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) i 'm [ so sorry ] ( http://cronicaglobal.elespanol.com/business/el-gobierno-fuerza-a-las-aerolineas-de-japon-e-india-a-seguir-hasta-madrid-si-quieren-volar-a-barcelona_24157_102.html ) . 
  now imagine if madrid did n't siphon out relevant congresses and investment and we could have decent international flights !, 
  barcelona alone is where it 's at :p #thanksbutnothanks, 
  the crusaders were good builders , and stone is strong indeed !, 
  yup !, 
  but not only that , even a city like barcelona with 20m wide streets is hard to take . 
  each `` illa '' of the eixample can be turned into a fort quite easily . 
  house to house combat is a thing . 
  often walls are drilled and the holes are used to create `` indoor streets '' of sorts to evade snipers and other dangers in the streets . 
  i really think an european dense city would probably be one of the hardest things to take if you do n't want to bomb it to shit . 
  sadly [ i do have an example for you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t__cwapvmui ) . 
  it was n't that [ damaged ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we7agvspjfo ) though . 
  oh , and mute both videos , they 're not saying anything particularly interesting . 
  no , i mean , tramuntana and bura are basically the same type of wind , with strong speeds etc. 
  zizek is always related, 
  well , hagia sophia is a museum as far as i know , and the pantheon is as much a church as the sagrada fam\u00edlia is ( so , basically in name only ) . 
  though i do n't know , i like that buildings conserve some semblance of their initial utility , i do n't enjoy turning them all into a museums . 
  cities just become themeparks then . 
  remember , if it were n't for this repurposing it 's very likely that * we would have no pantheon at all * , it would just be a ruin like most roman public buildings . 
  same with hagia sophia . 
  giving it a purpose , especially one that deeply concerned the people of the time promoted its manteinance ( even though it was brutalized quite a bit ) . 
  oh , we have that too over here in catalonia !, 
  we call it [ tramuntana ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhgzhw8ohoq ), 
  [ the police are investigating . 
  in the wrong country though .

  of course i do . 
  as i just said , the only reason * they are n't banned too * is beacause some politicians who have to vote for the ban fear losing townhalls in the ebre region . 
  the `` compromise '' was restrictions against them , but it 's bullshit . 
  nobody except some towns in that area support bous embolats . 
  ... but we have ? 
  bullfighting is banned , through pouplar legislative assembly no less ( the law was proposed through an assambleary campaign , not through the goverment ) and bous embolats are heavily restricted . 
  how is that symbolic ? 
  we 're trying , though politicians fear losing townhalls in the south , which is pretty coward . 
  datacaps are still a pain in the ass in some countries . 
  i think i have a 2,5 gb data cap for example . 
  i would too , but reality is reality . 
  that 's why murder , and animal murder , are both banned . 
  the difference is that we banned them and you still have n't . 
  if it is n't popular why has n't it been done ? 
  the canarias did it too . 
  care to read my comment again ? 
  i 'm not defending bous embolats . 
  this is the third time i repeat this , the only reason they 're not banned is beacause of shitty politics . 
  even my phones suggests me the entire phrase once i type the first world . 
  for fucks sake . 
  do n't even try to compare the popularity of bullfighting in spain and catalonia , holy shit . 
  spin what ? 
  i already told you , the only reason they 're not banned too is beacause of shitty politics . 
  maybe you could actually ban them too over the ... oh wait , `` chum '' , people there * like animal torture * . 
  nevermind . 
  look , i 'm not going to argue what is worse , but imho you should check what happens in a corrida and think if you 'd write this reply after that . 
  bous embolats are shit , but they 're not `` let 's drug and stab the bull in a coliseum-shaped-arena until we torture him to death in a few hours '' - shit . 
  and as i said , to generalize and try catalonia as a whole as pro-bou embolat is just fallacious and wrong . 
  it only happens in a few towns [ of this region ] ( http://www.vegueries.com/ebre/images/miniebre.gif ) which have an even tinnier % of the population living there . 
  just as an fyi , there is no ban for bullfighting of any kind in spain apart from ours and the one in the canary islands . 
  so , yes , they have * corridas * and * bous embolats * . 
  if you , after all of that i told you , still want to criticise us for that , well ... 
  obviously , corridas were n't happening here either * except * when people from other parts of the state gathered in barcelona on a yearly occasion , trying to make it seem like they did . 
  obviously corridas are not part of catalan culture and we despise them , so we banned them . 
  i encourage spaniards to do so too . 
   exactly , a tradition as stupid as bullfighting , and both sadly are happening in spain and catalonia nope . 
  bullfighting is ** not ** happening in catalonia , and bous embolats are only done in a tiny region of the country . 
  do n't equate us , mate . 
  that stupid tradition that a few towns down near the frontier do and that the politicians did n't have the balls to ban for fear of losing town halls ? 
  yeah , sure buddy, 
  yeah , no , i do n't want barcelona in the same picture as those bulls . 
  it 's outright disgusting , we banned them over here , but oh , spein , toros , fiesta !, 
  it 's `` gran '' in catalan , though if you 're speaking about language families it is n't an iberian language ( it 's galoromanic , then occitanoromanic ) . 
  maca means pretty girl in catalan so ... 
   could it be this blue you wish mate , you wish, 
  which imho it 's one of the `` non-written '' rules on why the eu exists i think . 
  i feel it depends on where you compare it . 
  the difference is small enough that on average you 're right , but the richer areas of spain are better off than the average ( and poorer ) areas of france . 
  you 're confusing state and country . 
  catalonia is a state-less country . 
  probably my favorite library to be honest . 
  even the archive is nowadays used as an example of the first curtain wall to ever be built . 
  well , you 've got to admit though , glasgow did beat you with mackintosh . 
  you did need modern architecture . 
  especially since you actually might have the worst building in europe ( the black pantheon ) imho . 
  i 've visited the thing , it 's criminally underrated imho . 
  especially the main parliment chamber . 
  it 's the enric miralles parliment ?
