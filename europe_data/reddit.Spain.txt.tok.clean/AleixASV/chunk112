  i like it . 
  country = / = state . 
  we 'll fix that soon enough though :p, 
  catalonia is actually older than denmark you know ? 
  we became independent in the ixth century from the carolingian empire . 
  our flag is also older than yours , first seen in the year 1150 . 
  do n't try to teach me my own history . 
  except you 're the one talking like a child . 
  but do n't let me stop you , it 's hilarious . 
  ok mate , powerful argument you got there . 
  they 're expensive , no joke, 
  that 's cool , we need more artists in top positions !, 
  ( yes , do n't go for it , you know who i 'm talking about ) . 
  then do n't dipute it . 
  i did n't say anything about denmark . 
  we are ( and were ) a country . 
  sometimes independent , sometimes not . 
  that palace did n't build itself up you know . 
  well , from 1914 to 1923/1925 we did have the mancomunitat , which had a president too ... but yeah , it was n't the generalitat ( the mancomunitat was just an attempt by the spanish goverment to give us powers without actually giving us powers , so i guess it does n't really count ) . 
  we 've had waaaay more presidents than most ( if not all ) countries in the world , since we kinda invented the `` presidency '' thing :p, 
  for confidential reasons the building has restricted access , so good pictures are hard to come by indeed !, 
  i 'm glad you picked the meeting room part though , it 's beautiful , thanks for the post !, 
  nah , seeing it yourself is what counts , do n't worry :p !, 
  the ajuntament ? 
  oh that 's a pretty cool building too !, 
  [ the sal\u00f3 de cent ] ( http://portalcec.cat/cecdigital/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/a-12-general-des-de-porta1.jpg ) may be my favourite medieval hall ( or one of my favourites , [ el sal\u00f3 del tinell ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0a/0b/5f/d0/salo-del-tinell.jpg ) in the royal palace is great too ) , plus [ the honour stairs ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/f0/5b/3d/f05b3dbfe6610dd7034453a9d95cd181.jpg ) and the [ regent queen hall ] ( http://estaticos.elperiodico.com/resources/jpg/4/6/vista-general-del-pleno-del-ayuntamiento-barcelona-1455226303464.jpg ) [ pic 2 ] ( https://dades.naciodigital.cat/redaccio/arxius/imatges/201605/990_1462475928ple_barcelona_foto_adria_costa_2016-052.jpg ) are pretty amazing . 
  and it 's way easier to get into too . 
  it 's a two part office , one part reserved for a personal office and the other for meetings . 
  the most famous part is the meetings hall . 
  it is my favourite presidential palace * by far * . 
  it 's obviously bias , but an original medieval hall is miles ahead of any barroque office . 
  also , el pati dels tarongers transpires [ elegance ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/1180269.jpg ) like no other . 
  [ cool thing about it too ] ( https://www.google.es/maps/@41.3830563,2.1762046,3a,75y,4.17h,86.76t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1skgfy7tbwfchzlsszxlaefg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  it 's built * over * the press hall , try switching between the 1 and the 0 in the right corner at the bottom . 
  do n't count nigeria out just yet . 
  they will be a superpower in 50 years if current projections hold . 
  holy shit !, 
  so it 's like us catalans who learn valencian , lapao , balear ( ? ), 
  and alguer\u00e8s at the same time we learn catalan !, 
  glad to meet other language-learners-extraordinaires !, 
  what in the hell ... 
  it 's 21\u00ba here with just some small tiny clouds in sight . 
  back then the crown of aragon was too a federation of kingdoms , so that is n't really true either . 
  not really . 
  i 've been to all of these places and we 've got much more in common with an euskera than with a castilian, 
  no , i did n't say franco created them , franco reintroduced them and they 're still being used . 
  it does in catalonia at least , beacause they substituted the vegueries of the republic . 
  it 's just topicazos , but basques and catalans do have diferent cultures than the rest of spain . 
  never said that the rest of spain was a single culture though . 
  i found dorne boring in the books * but * that 's good for the people living there :p, 
  he even included the pyrenees in there for good measure . 
  he used the province of barcelona which has little to do with the city of barcelona and is just a remnant of old francoist division of regions . 
  ... google image translation does n't help much ... something about a writer and words ? 
  well yeah , i did n't want to get into that but i do know about it :p also martell means hammer in catalan , letter for letter . 
  and i feel like that it 's too much of a coincidence hahahaahaha, 
  yeah , but you know ... 
  sand snakes ... 
  generally , we 're more introvert and reserved in our interactions and tend to celebrate less things . 
  we do n't have many big family parties and we tend to be quieter than people in the south . 
  economically speaking we were the first to industrialize ( both us and the basques ) and our economy has always been one based on trade and production whereas the south has always relied on farming . 
  basques and catalans both are , due to how our economy works and our `` cold '' culture :p, 
  nope , they 're dorne . 
  unbowed , unbent , unbroken are the dornish words . 
  highgarden is not a house , it 's a palace , and that would be the tyrell 's . 
  and yes , i read too much for my own good . 
  are we the fekkin sand snakes ? 
  oh god why, 
  yes , i mean the only organization that carries out serious and methodological speaker counts of catalan , why thank you . 
  the speaker count , under sources is listed as their own work with data from gencat ( generalitat ) and the ifop ( institut fran\u00e7ais d\u2019opinion publique ) . 
  so unless you consider an official body a `` nationalist source '' ( which somehow i might think you do ) you 're speaking out of your ass . 
  there 's one in [ spain too ] ( http://xtremetrailcup.es/wp-content/uploads/tabernas1.jpg ) , bigger by 120km2 than the one in ukraine . 
  uh no ? 
  i was actually wrong though , [ latest study states that catalan has 10m speakers and is understood by 13m people ] ( https://www.plataforma-llengua.cat/media/upload/pdf/informecat-2016-web_1462260429.pdf ), 
  unless you get a discount from papa rajoy like it just looks like you did . 
  we have a city in catalonia that goes well with that , it 's called berga . 
  argentinians will never get over that one . 
  so do i. 
  they had so many opportunities to fix this , we did n't even want to seccede until maybe 3 or 4 years ago , our president first tried to negotiate a fiscal pact and got denied time and time again , then later prosecuted for organizing a public consultation on independence - not even a referendum - plus a unit of the spanish police fabricated evidence him to be released during election time , among other politicians . 
  i 'm not even going to acknowledge so much revisionism with a reply . 
  have a nice day !, 
  do you ? 
  what would they win ? 
  they lose on trade ( pretty much all of their land trade goes through us ) , comunication , key energies ( we have 2 nuclear plants key for their energy grid ) , international `` face '' and they only gain public opinion , if that . 
  it 's mutual destruction . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  cup 's aim is not to get out of the eu though , that 's a `` side effect '' of them being hard left . 
  they exist only to force the goverment to have some balls and keep on with independence beacause they depend on them . 
  i 'm pro-federation and i voted them for that , 
  oh no , i do belive there 's still some `` rastros '' of francoism ( after all pp was founded by francoists ) and you can find them if you look a little , but they 're very minoritary thankfully . 
  and el mundo just got exposed last night in a documentary about being complicit with politically motivated police investigations . 
  abc was even more objective than they were !, 
   well ask yourself this : would you remain spanish citizens enjoying spanish rights if you were to leave spain ? 
  so why would it be different with your eu citizenship , which entirely hinges on you being spanish citizens ? 
  as i said , this is speculation . 
  a transition to a catalan state would be required , but ask yourself this : what would the eu win by kicking us out ? 
  absolutely nothing . 
  it 's fearmongering . 
   as to your last point : because i believe that plurinational states can exist , i think such a spanish state would be a better solution for everyone involved . 
  yes , but it 's a fairytale . 
  our entire existence inside of spain proves it .
