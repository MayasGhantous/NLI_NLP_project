  today in 1992 fc barcelona won its first champions league title starting and started to be relevant on the world-stage , much more than it was before . 
  well duh . 
  but when the guy above me talked about catholicism he used it as a blanket statement . 
  catholics here are tolerant .

  spain is catholic and has 84 % though, 
  sadly no , i 'm an architecture student from barcelona , but i 've been in the workshop :p, 
  yup , you 're 100 % correct . 
  we have pieced back small portions of his models and have been able to reconstruct them for a while ( more or less as he designed them ) so we are n't at a total loss at least . 
  yeah that 's true . 
  in the 60 ' and thanks to america 's colaborationism with the regime ( to sustain it so the soviets could n't install one of their puppets ) the economy started growing again , but we did n't recuperate what we had before the civil war until maybe the 70 's . 
  i mean here in spain we came off a dictatorship in the 70 ' and we were n't doing so well as compared to france , for example , so maybe we 're not the best example . 
  i went too , it 's a cool place !, 
  it has a full medieval wall surrounding it and the view from down the hill is quite picturesque . 
  and the guest list book is full of references to ac :p, 
  welp ... and how am i supposed to know that ? 
  i understand this is a sensitive topic but holy shit you guys ca n't really take it ... 
  more or less yes we were , but as i said the situation was different, 
  so are n't they second class citizens ( or not at all ? ) ? 
  just asking honestly , i seem to have attracted quite a few pissed off estonians ... 
  i do n't know , that 's why i asked . 
  well alright , whatever . 
  that 's what i get for asking something i guess, 
  i do n't know historical facts , that 's why i was asking . 
  and do n't these people face goverment discrimination due to the fact that they are n't recognised as citizens of the state ? 
   i 'm guessing catalonians and spanish intermingled a lot , did n't they ? 
  well , the estonian and russian communities intermingling is a rarity here , sadly . 
  no they have n't that much and we have the same issue : many cities around barcelona which were pretty much created to house immigrants from other areas of spain are full of people that * know catalan * but have n't spoken it in years or decades or do n't even know it . 
  we have mingled , but it should be promoted even more . 
  from what i 'm reading it seems like the problem is very similar to yours , though i might argue that you have it even worse . 
  and are n't those taxes used to help benefit the citizens ? 
  how does that make sense ? 
   downvotes for asking a question : / yeah , i understand this may be sensitive , but still , c'mon . 
  thank you for your writeup , i think i understand the situation a little better now !, 
  as it seems , you guys already have russian as official as it can get without actually being official . 
  i understand that federalizing the country into regions would just incentivize russia to influence the most russian part so i would n't propose that , but further mixing of the two cultures seems pretty necessary . 
  it worked more or less here in catalonia : everyone speaks both spanish and to a lesser degree catalan ( 85 % or something like that ) and i 'm not suggesting teaching russian at schools or something like that ( which could be done ) but to recognise the fact that a big part of your population is how it is . 
  does n't the state represent all ? 
  as it stands , they 're not even citizens which boggles my mind . 
  there will be no integration and there will always be a `` russian minority '' in estonia if things are kept like this imho . 
  but is n't there a big % of the population in estonia made of russian speakers ? 
  but is n't english official in ireland too , for example ? 
  i just said it does n't have much in common . 
  but hey . 
  not even close to that afterwards . 
  about most of the top cities in catalonia nowadays owe +90 % of their population to immigration from that time ( hospitalet , santa coloma de gramenet , badalona , etc. ) . 
  in these cities you wo n't hear much catalan spoken , not even in the original city centers . 
  you guys have a better deal than us with yet i think that if we happen to become independent and do well then you may follow . 
  part of the reason spain 's fighting so hard to keep us . 
  obviously . 
  but remember , we are still fighting for independence here and the threat of the spanish state still lingers , despite not being even close to what it was . 
  i mean it feels kinda wrong ... we had an even worse situation here in catalonia in the 60 ' and 70 ' where so many spaniards immigrated here that nowadays there are more spanish speakers than catalans ( though franco 's cultural genocide contributed to that ) and we now consider working and living here the only requirements for someone wanting to be catalan to be considered one . 
  spanish is obviously coofficial and it will still be in a future catalan republic . 
  but do n't they live and work in estonia ? 
  and are n't their kids born in there ? 
  are n't they already estonian ? 
  but are n't they people , living in estonia for a long time ? 
  and i suppose they have kids that have only lived in the country their entire lives . 
  but why is n't russian simply an official language too ? 
  do n't promote it , there 's no need but shit , it 's a lot of people just out in the open . 
  here in catalonia we have a similar situation , in the 60 and 70 ' a lot of immigrants from spain came over and pretty much refused ( and refuses ) to integrate . 
  there 's now more spanish speaking people than catalan speakers ( though that 's also thanks to franco 's attempted cultural genocide ) and spanish is a co-official language and will be too in a future catalan republic . 
  but then do you have a country where half of the people living inside of it ( made up the proportion btw ) is an illegal immigrant ? 
  should n't modern estonia accept the reality and move on ? 
  so they have a russian passport then ? 
  and if they are n't citizens , do they pay taxes ? 
  but are n't passports mandatory ? 
  wait what , they 're not citizens ? 
  what does that mean ? 
  and of course , estonia is booming and since it 's a part of the eu it enjoys basically the best standard of life in the world on average . 
  i mean , now it just seems like any other russian city that is in estonia for some reason , pretty horrifying . 
  shit , i just looked at the `` city '' in google maps . 
  how did you manage to keep that thing from russia ? 
  96 % russian population and an amalgamation of soviet blocks one after another ... 
  there is n't anything left from the old town is there ? 
   my client ( merkel/god ) is n't in a hurry - antoni gaud\u00ed, 
  we have tons of them here in barcelona and they 're good people . 
  is he our justin bieber , who like the canadians and the americans everybody claims that he 's from the other country ? 
  hey hey hey hey woah now . 
  do n't put this crap on us . 
  he is the * spanish singer * , either he wins or loses . 
  i 'm already starting to see `` the catalan singer fucks up '' magically changing his nationality .

  i study urbanism so i have a bit of an insight into what the city will do . 
  we 're improving connectivity with the collserola park urbanizing the valleys with improved park infraestructure and we 're working into making the sagrera linear park a reality ( which will be the biggest linear park in the wolrd ) .
