  so the current architects of the church are trying to differ as little as possible from the original design * most of the time * , but many others call them out stating that it is n't a gaud\u00ed building anymore ( which is the current viewpoint of the community ) beacause of the involvement of people that had little to do with his style ( such as many of the sculptures made by subirachs ) and some rather poor finishing touches that detract from the meticolous style employed by gaud\u00ed . 
  some of these dissenting architects argue that the building should 've never continued construction when gaud\u00ed died and that it should have been left half-done . 
  others want demolition , but they 're attention seekers . 
  oh and by the way , the last controversy about it is that the sagrada fam\u00edlia is so old that construction was started in a town * that was latter annexed by barcelona * . 
  the initial building , default neogothic in style and started by a random architect ( gaud\u00ed picked up shortly afterwards ) had a weird agreement and no building permit with the town , so up until now it has been left like that . 
  ooooh yeah i saw that too !, 
  el intermedio is a great substitute :p, 
  some things never change haahhaaha, 
  [ man , it * is * gorgeous , i 'm sorry to say :p ] ( http://images.adsttc.com/media/images/55e6/271f/2347/5dd6/0100/01d3/large_jpg/1326249672-portada.jpg?1441146641 ), 
  actually yes , poor building does n't even know what it is . 
  shit i miss the old salvados, 
  i am and you 're right . 
  even if i do appreciate some fascist architecture ( the italians were especially good at it ) for its ... `` sombre '' aesthetics ? 
  purely from an architectural view of course . 
  this is n't even good at that . 
  i can . 
  imagine the place without that badly placed mass of concrete and bricks . 
  [ so this would be an amob ] ( http://www.juancarlosdiazlorenzo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1024px-mezquita_de_cc3b3rdoba_exterior_del_muro_de_la_quibla.jpg ) cathedral ? 
  ( it 's the mezquita de c\u00f3rdoba ), 
  yup , and i 've already got some `` so-called '' experts to defend her . 
  i belive this is brigading . 
  sorry , i do n't like logical fallacies . 
   it 's the reason why we have a lost generation in southern europeans and even french to some extent . 
  it 's a crime against tens of millions of europeans . 
    the fact is we 're not going to get a fiscal union any time soon as we northern europeans refuse to be responsible for the south 's expenses and they would refuse even more for us to control their expenses . 
    i do not know if it is a good idea as i have not studied it ( well i studied it more than you clearly ) . 
  but it should not be dismissed out of hand without knowing what you are talking about . 
  these quotes speak for themselves . 
  this what populism and demagogy are all about : everyone is my friend ( poor southern europeans !, 
  ) , us vs them ( fuck southern europeans ! ), 
  and `` i know more than you '' . 
  textbook . 
  i 'm not saying that the * idea of it * is crazy , but the fact that she wants to force the eu to do so . 
  we did not vote for her . 
  i did not vote to get rid of the euro . 
  i do not want to get rid of the euro . 
  she is crazy for wanting to impose her ideas on all of the continent . 
  this is my argument . 
  yeah , that she wants to impose on all of us ? 
  what the fuck . 
  she is not my president and she will never be . 
  ty , it was a silly typo !, 
  she literally just said that she did n't want to get rid of the ~ ~ europe ~ ~ euro , that the big companies would continue using it and trading with it , but that the general people would use francs ( and as such in the rest of the continent with their respective currencies ) . 
  so that companies would pay out in francs , and then they and the banks would use euros . 
  it sounded like she just made that up on the spot and hooolyyy shiit . 
  holy shit i did not realise how crazy le pen is . 
  i had a friend from the diaspora , but born here . 
  he did n't even think he could speak proper romanian . 
  i see no problem with that . 
  the map is from lisboa and they 're speaking italian , how is that related to us ? 
  [ nor us catalans . 
  not that she can anyway but hey ] ( http://media-edg.barcelona.cat/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/correfoc-manresa.jpg?v=1422354226 ), 
  is she drunk ? 
  [ our wheater guys are quite normal compared to that , they 're all physicists i think .

  castille actually , never spain . 
  but so is yours hahahaahahaha !, 
  i guess we 'd have to teach germany some things !, 
  and a united france-germany-catalonia too !, 
  we were part of the empire at the time !, 
  so you 'd get our beaches and industries :p !, 
  am from catalonia , can confirm . 
  we 're not very original :p, 
  i mean , like those two languages , catalan is a descendant of latin so that 's why . 
  people look like trees , what a weird stadium !, 
  actually no . 
  it obviously is n't majoritary beacause we would n't even be a democracy but a high % of the right-wing in spain can calmly state that they lived better under franco and such nonsense and no one sees anything wrong . 
  it has been ingrained into the culture . 
  the civil war was n't about catalonia you know ? 
  anyway , it 's easy to see , and you know it , it 's a pointless discussion . 
  it is n't . 
  he won the war , he was never questioned . 
  when he died , the `` transicion '' made sure that the criminal rulers of the regime would never be persecuted , and literally the current ruling party of spain is a direct descendant of the upper echelon of the francoist regime . 
  it 's usually never an open support ( though you can easily spot francoist flags on right-wing demonstrations ) but usually a `` the past is the past '' attitude , refusing to condemm the dictatorship for what is was . 
  yeah , but franco * still * has a ton of support in spain . 
  fundacion francisco franco , the valle de los ca\u00eddos , cities with francoist streets , etc. 
  do n't worry !, 
  you can even pull an obama and go backpacking around here :p !, 
  not in barcelona though , the muslims had little influence here !, 
  this aglomeration was due to the space inside city walls being highly valuable and everyone wanted a piece of it :p !, 
  thank you !, 
  stay in barcelona ia cheap , flights ... 
  it depends sadly, 
  well , it 's a medieval street , centuries old . 
  many cities in the mediterranean had similar layouts , and even others such as paris or london too . 
  space inside walls was very valuable , so everyone cramped in proto-skyscrapers upwards . 
  [ here 's another one , from the call of girona ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/11/39/cb/1139cbfc13d3a50b97c49db7ee79b00c.jpg ) . 
  maybe it 's the sandstone rock used ? 
  it 's found in salamanca too i think . 
  these rocks are from the montju\u00efc quarry . 
  yeah it 's tres llits . 
  probably the most iconic `` narrow street '' of barcelona . 
  hey , it 's my namesake , aleix sal\u00f3 !, 
  [ here it is ] ( http://m.imgur.com/a/eonjb ) last image is in spanish . 
  bascially it identifies areas in the city which will be targetted to build public housing . 
  and the joints, 
  carrer tres llits , yes , it 's the g\u00f2tic !, 
  welp , ai n't that good for them, 
  buy a book and a rose for your beloved !,
