  his towers are only like that beacause they `` fit '' what he belives to be an `` american style '' . 
  and actually , the trump tower is prrreeetty good looking . 
   architectural revival on fb - guy is an architect and yet he does n't have a single clue about architecture . 
  which is more common than you might imagine . 
  he 's critizing what architecture * was a 100 years ago * as if it 's the same architecture that we design now . 
  it 's utter stupidity . 
  so basically , what would happen if donald trump were to critizice architecture . 
  what a load of shit . 
  it 's like whomever did this learnt all of his architecture from children 's coloring books . 
  yep ? 
  and nobody cares because you forced them not to . 
  cute . 
  occitania was a large historical * nation * . 
  separate of catalonia . 
  they were our brothers and allies in medieval times . 
  beacause people shrug it off like `` no big deal , just erasing local cultures '' . 
  ... did n't i just say that ? 
  that 's the point of the discussion , french destruction of regional cultures . 
   not everybody agrees with your romantic nationalistic ideas , so no it must not be preserved . 
  cultures are not preserved , they change , they evolve , massively . 
  the culture in the catalan area of now is massively different from the one that was there just 100 years ago , jsut like the culture in the whole of france has massively changed in the last 100 years . 
  you mean it has been destroyed , rather agressively . 
   france is not trying to erode culture , france has historically been promoting a political identity as opposed to romantic/nationalistic identities . 
  that is a fact . 
  unfortunately , nationalism has been back into fashion for quite a few years now , with loads of money behind , the support from the eu and a new pseudo-leftist nice attire . 
  it is . 
  catalan has never been seriously taught at schools , has never been promoted by the state and has never gotten any kind of official recognition . 
  culture is only promoted through ngo 's and recieves opposition from the state . 
  this is not nationalism , this is saving a dying culture that has been attacked by a foreign imposed culture . 
  the people of northern catalonia did vote for it . 
  obviously it is nationalism . 
  beacause catalonia is a nation and must be preserved , but we 're not exclusionary of xenophobic . 
  france * is * trying to erode and homogenize all local cultures though , and that 's a fact . 
  beacause the french state has proved time and time again that it does n't really care for local cultures . 
  if they ca n't protect them , an administrative regional department should . 
  well , regional diversity is what makes a country `` a country '' imho . 
  a single homogeneus culture with no diversity stagnates and decays beacause it really does n't have any kind of `` pull '' from diverse regions moving it foward ( as in , an industrious north , a cultural south etc. ) . 
  what france is doing is actually counter-productive to the state . 
  to be honest it is a cool logo , and of course catalan flags are in perpiny\u00e0 , * you 're in catalonia , there should be catalan flags * . 
  but that 's about it . 
  i 've been there , very few people speak the language and it 's just a folk `` silly thing that the locals do '' . 
  which is sad . 
  and the state gets even more homogeneous as a `` single french culture '' gets imposed and the minorities ca n't do a single thing about it beacause they are just that , minorities . 
  no , of course , but they wanted to be included in the name as it was done elsewhere, 
  occinanie an improvement ? 
  it just imposes the name of whatever little was left of northern catalonia . 
  i guess we 're trained to see tech and structures as `` nice '' things :p !, 
  nah but really though , what usually happens is that people tend to compare old and new buildings from `` different '' categories . 
  by that i mean that we do n't actually conserve much of the `` utilitarian '' architecture ( homes and such ) that dominated the times and instead just have the bestest , what people * thought we ought to preserve * . 
  on the other hand today we have everything , there 's no filter , so that 's where this old = good thing comes from . 
  thing is , just because it is pretty and old does n't mean that it 's good . 
  a bunch of plaster wood and fake gold do n't mean it 's a good library , so imho we should try to appreciate both the good and the ugly of the architecture of our times and the old one . 
  i 'm actually studying architecture , in the middle of my degree hahahaha, 
  i was pretty pissed off at how the thread was going to be honest and just kinda went on a rant ... weeelp, 
  i 'm not saying that they 're wrong , i 'm saying that there were bad buildings back then too , that not everything is perfect beacause it is old . 
  just like today . 
  and yes , some are circlejerking , beacause they do n't even stop and try to appreciate what we have today . 
  also , i provided some context as to why i think that way , based on what i studied . 
  i do n't think it 's pretentious , but hey ^ ( and yes , i reeeally do n't like the buildings he linked , but that 's besides the point :p ) . 
  dunno , it 's my opinion . 
  i studied these guys so i do think i can talk about them . 
  sorry if it came off pretentiously but i really ca n't stand the `` dae old buildings are cool '' circlejerk . 
  going against the circlejerk , even with examples , only gets you downvotes though :p !, 
  ... so much discontrol and bad composition !, 
  one of the few `` old '' libraries that i like is the original , the biblioteca laurenziana by michelangelo [ 1 ] ( http://www.bml.firenze.sbn.it/images_index/salone.jpg ) . 
  [ the stairs are pretty dope ] ( http://www.rositour.it/arte/michelangelo%20buonarroti/ma_firenze-biblioteca%20medicea-laurenziana_scale.jpg ) . 
  i call it the original beacause it pretty much was the first modern library . 
  your number 2 , which is the only one that did n't make some kind of monstruosity of wood and fake gold is actually just a copy [ of san ` andrea by alberti ] ( https://laliteraliteraria.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/vista-nave.jpg ) . 
  a far flung copy at that , beacause i 'm guessing it 's at least a hundred years apart of that building . 
  remember , there were bad buildings back then too . 
  in turn , alberti copied the ceiling design from the [ pantheon ] ( https://www.italyguides.it/images/gridfolio/rome/pantheon/pantheon.230.jpg ) in rome , even though he just painted his squares beacause it was cheaper . 
  so , in turn , something that made sense in the pantheon ( made the cupola weight less and it was pretty ) turned in time and through countless copies into a parody of its former self in your link ( it 's just a decorative element copied from someone successful ) . 
  and that 's why i only tolerate bernini and borromini among the barroque architects , they copied yes , but with good judgement , which is key in an architect . 
  it 's the same building as the first :p !, 
  it 's the viipurii library by alvar aalto , one of his masterpieces !, 
  this type of lighting was * veeeery * experimental and new , so while today it might seem odd ( they 're not `` just '' lights , during the day they let the sun 's light go through ) they were genious back then . 
  [ nah ] ( https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5388a09fe4b0ab689147a25b/t/538f3fb1e4b02add9dcae383/1429642587578/aalto_43-004-112_luentosali%2c+kuva+gustaf+welin%2c+alvar+aalto%e2%80%93museo+1935+copy.jpg ) , [ not ] ( http://www.arxiusarquitectura.cat/public/images/arquitectura/a0030/dkzmgs3e_8115_original.jpg ) [ really ] ( http://www.metalocus.es/sites/default/files/file-images/metalocus_museum_alvaralto_02_1200.jpg ) , [ no ] ( http://cdn.hiconsumption.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/geisel-library-university-of-california-san-diego.jpg ) .

  no , i 'm sorry , eta is the past and they are by far not the only ones that have uttered that phrase .
