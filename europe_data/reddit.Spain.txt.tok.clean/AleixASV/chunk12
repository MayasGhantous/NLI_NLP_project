  notice that most of the parts that were n't castille do n't say spanish ? 
  here in the peninsula we just call it `` castellano '' althogether and if it 's called spanish in english it just makes you wonder why could that be . 
  maybe the power projection that castille aquired after uniting and dominating aragon ? 
  they certanly wanted to show that * they * ruled the peninsula , so that 's why they want to say that spain existed since late xiv , which is absolutely false and so goes with the language , which is n't anything more than what the people of castille spoke back then and now it 's `` spanish '', 
  alright , alright , so to sum it up : the catalans , with more than 11,5 m speakers * want * to speak catalan . 
  how surprising is n't it ? 
  it 's like it 's their mother tongue or something and they can express themselves better with it , who would have thought it !, 
   why would needlessly waste money on catalan translations or spanish translations , let 's force everybody to speak english !, 
  the spaniards want to speak spanish ? 
  * maybe * like the catalans demand to speak catalan ? 
  how surprising , how could that be ? 
  meanwhile ... here we our president does n't even speak english, 
  my god his english is amazing ... 
  especially compared to some folks that roam around here, 
  exactly, 
  and they 're comin ' for ya, 
  you never know , i 've been in one of [ these ] ( http://www.foroswebgratis.com/fotos/7/4/4/8/4//801355taxi%20seat%20600.jpg ) by pure luck, 
  and easily recognoscible aswell !, 
  helps if you 're in a hurry, 
  all of them always will look the same , we 've been using these colors for [ decades ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/taxi_barcelona_mnatec_b31729.jpg/800px-taxi_barcelona_mnatec_b31729.jpg ), 
  it was n't i who compared them, 
  but then again , not the same can be stated for catalonia , thanks to leaders all over the world not wanting involvement but then ceding to the spanish diplomacy, 
  since when politicians have affirmed repeatedly that palestine is only an israel 's problem and that others should not intervene ( apart from israel itself , obviously ) ? 
  the most external `` internal affair '' ever, 
  thought so , because otherwise ... 
  i would probably be really scared of you, 
  you know ... that 's what hitler wanted to do ... 
  i understand that you 're mad and all , but please be creative and * do n't * steal ideas from him . 
  that 's how you get nazis, 
   that 's a symptom of nationalism , hardly curable sadly i 'm sick doctor !, 
   mr mas asked for two years ago in la moncola , obviously the timing was not so great , the spanish state being in the worse economic crisis in 50 years . 
  ok , i 'm not discussing demagogy . 
  madrid is clearly at fault here . 
  you ca n't criticise someone * for trusting * in spain ( because that 's what he did , he has told that various times ) . 
  and sadly it was n't the last time that that happened : another easy example would be how they destroyed our already crappy estatut for example , which mainly catapulted our seccessionism various years ahed . 
  and just so you know , i mainly gave you economic reasons hoping that you would n't pull the demagogic shit on me ... because i 'd love to not have to be one , but when you see the crap that we have to deal every day it 's impossible not to be one ( ... tenemos que espa\u00f1olizar a los alumnos catalanes , etc. ) . 
  it 's not that our culture is special or something , the thing is that it is * our * culture , and we wo n't be blackmailed to let it rot . 
   and so could you !, 
  i do , thanks, 
   `` we have the right to decide '' , well , no , you do n't oh we do n't ? 
  even if he hold an absurd majority on our parliment saying that we do ? 
  we 'll see about that . 
  but anyway , here you have stated the arguments of someone who does n't understand our situation : * we * ca n't vote , * we * are n't a nation ( oh , just a culture - and not so different one from the spanish ! - with ehhh a language - not that rare in a multiculti country like spain ! - ) , etc. 
  let 's get the facts straight : we * are * a nation , do n't avoid stating that . 
  a really neglated nation ( just reading from your comment anyone can see that ) with a language continually compromised by the spanish nationalism through centuries , that has it 's resources constantly drained . 
  let me give you some examples : 150000 $ milion a year ( data from 2011 ) that we pay in taxes that we do n't get back . 
  this fiscal deficit ( 8,5 % of our gdp ) is the highest on the world , the next being connecticut with a ** 5 % ** fiscal deficit on the usa . 
  with this money not only we would n't need austerity - one of your other complaints : we do care about that , but we fight against it differently as you can see - but we would also have enough money to invest in what is really important ( education , healthcare , etc. ), 
  the prohibitive deficit imposed by madrid , wanting to equalise all comunities and in doing that forcing our gov to raise taxes due to being impossible to asume - do n't jump on me now , i do n't vote ciu they are right on this one - the constant denial of previously pacted funds , having to take money from the `` fondo de liquidez auton\u00f3mico '' ( a sorts of rescue mechanism with high punishment for the one who uses it ) , money that * we * know that was put there from the same money that we did n't get back from our taxes thanks to the horrible fiscal distribution system , and the joke is that the interests from that fund are so high that we are constantly having to pay more for * our * money just to keep afloat . 
  these are just some examples of our economical arguments , but do you really think that we are so * stupid * that we ca n't fight back our government for it 's social policies ? 
  really ? 
  what have you been watching on the news , in barcelona , at can vies for example ( this is one of the most recent cases ) ? 
  do i have to remember you about the massive campings in pla\u00e7a catalunya a few years ago ? 
  our mind is capable of confronting more than one issue at once , and this :  everywhere else are protests against the economic measures , austerity and what not , in catalonia it 's about spain steals from us , we are super rich is nothing short of demagogy  by the way , caf\u00e9 para todos , was not about airports and high speed trains , but you know that do n't you ? 
  examples , you know what they are ? 
  some thoughts : since when a group of 50 people have more to say about another country than the people living in that land that explicitly * voted * for a referendum ? 
  let 's see what they are saying :  en cambio proliferan maniobras opacas para ofrecer nuevos privilegios al nacionalismo a costa de la soberan\u00eda de los espa\u00f1oles ( opaque maneuvers proliferate to offer new privileges to nationalism at the cost of the spanish 's people sovereignty ) all my what . 
  pp has not only given us the middle finger , they have also cut our already low income even lower . 
  not a sinlge day passes when we hear `` the government of madrid has denied catalans the right to vote '' or `` madrid has cancelled our funds from a previously pacted tax '' . 
  if as the `` soveringty of the spanish people they refer to the constitutional law that states that all spaniards have to vote to decide on spanish lands , then they are outright denying the right of autodetermination and just giving us more examples of their horrible dimplomacy . 
  we will vote no matter what , the last elections made that clear giving us two thirds of our parliment in favor of that . 
  ( they - the anti-seccessionist parties - must get togheter and agree on a pact antiseccessionist ) ok . 
  so they must agree on something that they have already agreed on ? 
  this is hilarious , they are circlejerking !, 
  do you think that this will make seccessionism recede ? 
  this will only prove that they are even more closed to dialogue and force us to ( when we have already voted on with some sort of referendum ) proclame our independence unilaterally , which is something that mr. vargas llosa himself , being a peruan of birth , should know that is a thing that can very much happen  `` a ratos tenemos la impresi\u00f3n de que en catalu\u00f1a hay un mon\u00f3logo que las autoridades han impuesto que silencia a un sector que necesita recibir la solidaridad y el apoyo del resto de los espa\u00f1oles ( this is what llosa says btw : sometimes we think that in catalonia there is a monologue that the authorities have imposed that silences a sector that needs to receive the solidarity and the support from the rest of the spanish people ) so basically , what he is saying is that our elections are worth nothing and that a democratic mandate can be overriden if they so desire . 
  this is such bullshit . 
   les pedimos [ a los partidos ] que trabajen organizadamente por la deslegitimaci\u00f3n intelectual y pol\u00edtica del nacionalismo y que se movilicen con nosotros en defensa de la comunidad de libres e iguales que es responsable de la \u00e9poca m\u00e1s justa y f\u00e9rtil de la historia de espa\u00f1a ( from the manifesto itself : we demand the political parties to work for the intelectual and politic delegitimization of the - catalan , because sometimes they forget and deny that themselves are also nationalist - nationalism and that they should mobilise with us to defend the comunity of equality and liberty that has given us the most just and fertil time of all spain 's history ) oh yes fantastic , do n't give us an alternative , do n't give us arguments in favor of spain , desligitimaze our parties and our culture !, 
  ( and implicitly all the people that voted them and care about our traditions , because that will go well with your ambitions ) . 
  and defend `` the most just and equal time of spain ? '', 
  well , we 're in europe , it would be hard to not go with current times . 
  some of these chaps were francoists and now they seem to have converted , but precisely some of our points in favor of independence ( our fiscal deficit in favor of the central gov. 
  wich in 2011 was 15.000 $ ) say that this is not true at all . 
  the `` cafe para todos '' ( basically , let 's give airports and high speed trains to everyone , because if the catalans have'em we also should ! ), 
  formula has only almost bankrupted the country and now you 're defending it ? 
  anyway , so this manifesto is a joke and not only wo n't deter sececcionists and convice them to be in favour of unity but probably will create a movement in the other direction , which is usually what happens with most of the statements that come from the horrible understanding of the catalan situation in madrid and the eaguerness of the state-wide parties of easy votes . 
  ** edit : ** just because , they have just tweeted this : [ no to the imposition of having to decide #freeandequal ] ( https://twitter.com/libresiguaies/status/489386770854072320 ) . 
  fantastic , now democratically deciding something is an imposition . 
  and they are getting their signature section spammed because they are totally incapable of handling such a thing . 
  this manifesto is just a joke . 
   seems like you guys lack a decent consumer protection institution : s aside from that it was covered quite a bit in the media and schools so people were in on it here . 
  i do n't know it we even have one !, 
  i suppose we do , but it does n't work much - surprise surprise -  right after the euro or from then till now after the crisis ? 
  the stats that i got took into account a 10 year span . 
  i could see how the crisis has influenced prices more but all studies seem to use this time-span as a standard, 
   the netherlands are better tho . 
  i 've been around there , but not specially in the netherlands . 
  from what i 've heard it 's just a duller version of the north of germany ( hamburg , l\u00fcbeck and such ) which i 've visited and enjoyed . 
  could be wrong though . 
  and yeah , i 've been to paris twice and i mean , i 'm from barcelona so i kinda understand the parisians being fed up with the tourists ... but we mostly try to be nice . 
  it 's that feeling of living in a summer theme park that makes people react like that i guess, 
  due to the `` peseta '' ( spanish currency ) being really devaluated ( 1000pt was around 6 $ ) people did n't really get the unit conversion ( most even carried little plastic cards that gave you a basic idea of how much you were paying ! ), 
  and shops and services exploited this caos by raising prices ( since we adopted the euro salaries have gone up by a 14 % while housing is 66 % more expensive and food 48 % - bread in special is a whooping 85 % more expensive ) . 
  people were not happy, 
  ... you know , the north of europe sounds like a wonderful place, 
  sadly , not the same can be aplied here , rampant abuses were taken by sellers due to people not knowing monetary conversions and such ... 
  i was just talking from experience , because sadly this was really widespread here, 
  do n't worry , on 2015 the ones crying will be the lithuanians for having to pay 30 % + at least for almost everything ... 
  but hey , welcome to the club !, 
  in a parallel universe they could have been called `` supersoldaten '',
