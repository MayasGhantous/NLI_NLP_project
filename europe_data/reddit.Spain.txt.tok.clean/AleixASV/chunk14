  that 's because we developed our industry and economy way quicker than any of the other regions of spain ( and even some did n't and still do n't want to industrialise , and live pretty well from the solidarity fund , lowering taxes and all that ), 
  well of course they 're will be inestability , it 's a secession !, 
  but that does n't mean that the country wo n't successfully develop economically . 
  and btw , the patriotic bonds were started by montilla , not mas , and were due to ** our ** money not returning home ( 15000milion $ per year that we send to madrid and stay there ) and so having plea money from the people , because sadly , spain does n't understand the concept of solidarity and they mistake it for extorsion, 
  sources ? 
  you can check [ ours anytime you want , they exist ] ( http://premsa.gencat.cat/pres_fsvp/docs/2014/06/12/16/19/b188179f-272f-42ee-b449-4cf77f014331.pdf ), 
   the butthurt is strong with this one . 
  i find your ~ ~ lack ~ ~ excess of ~ ~ faith ~ ~ flaming disturbing , youngling, 
  do you write my comments ? 
  did n't think so . 
  take it as you want , but you 'll be wrong, 
  yeah , and we arrived at a point that whatever happens here will be through a vote , so anything proposed by them will have to accept that, 
  i mentioned it because he said this :  you most likely have a few of then in your family tree . 
  look , you clearly do n't have a clue about what you 're talking about and are reading too much into this, 
  shows that i do n't care about it and i was just answering what he asked, 
  not with modern tactics and bombers from the italian army who did n't even declare war against the spanish republic, 
   but that does n't matter , many ( if not all ) of my friends do and i do n't care about it really now ? 
  you could n't keep reading ? 
  pathetic, 
  let others do it , look how spain has ended now !, 
  durao barroso , but he has been talked down for that and the eu as an institution outright disagrees with saying anything in the matter, 
  nah , creme brulee is a later adaptation of the dish by a french chef ( pretty bland in my opinion , sorry : / ), 
  the eu has n't stated that we 're going out in the first place . 
  i 'm an european citizen and there 's no law that revokes that . 
  they came here because their regions did n't have a strong burgeois base * that did n't burst out of nowhere * because they never had . 
  no , even if i live in probably one of the most spaniarised cities in all of catalonia i do n't have spanish descendence ( maybe except one great grandparent ) , but that does n't matter , many ( if not all ) of my friends do and i do n't care about it . 
  the problem was not in the hands of the laborers to solve , but in the hands of the entepreneurs who rebuilt the economy and where that process started first was where it rooted deeper . 
  yes , some of our burgueoise were friends with franco and certainly benefited from that , but so were people from other region , catalonia was never unique in that , and the percentage was low furthermore . 
  do i need to remember you what region of spain opposed franco the most during the war ? 
  well it is n't ours ( though we make it ) but from balears, 
   we were too busy getting left out of the preferential treatment , industrial privileges and development grants that catalonia has been getting since the 60s and earlier . 
   but i totally understand that some regions are made better than others and not everyone deserves to be the apple of franco 's eye . 
  ... of course , because all of that happened , we were n't banned our language , our cities devastated ( remember what city was the first in the history to recieve carpet bombing ? 
  barcelona is your answer ) , our economy in shackles and it was thanks to our entrepeneurs and investors that , with * catalan * capital enpowered the economy . 
  of course we took grants , why would n't we ? 
  the question is why the rest did n't , they were for everybody , and in a proteccionist economy one takes all it can get . 
  thanks to our successful investments we recovered faster than many other regions and sucked way after way of immigration ( that mixed our culture , but hey , the catalan culture does n't exist , ban all their traditions said someone ! ), 
  so that helped reinvigorate the country as a whole . 
  and then , once we pushed and pushed what we get ? 
  fucking solidarity ? 
  15.000 * milion * euros per year , no less . 
  i 'm sorry but we 're out . 
  yeah ... and now imagine what would have happened if they invested in * catalonia * and not give us shit all the time with immobilist and centralist laws , what a wonderful and united country spain would be . 
  alas it was not to be . 
  * such * sad, 
  should 've invested in industry and not agriculture spain , what were you doing ... 
  * oh god , the blasphemy !, 
  people wonder why we want to seccede and say that an independent catalonia would be financially unstable ... well look at that , even with the 15.000 m $ of fiscal deficit we 're doubling spain 's gdp, 
  well yes , but i 'm only saying that catalan creme is not cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e , the later being an adaptation of the first . 
  people here started questioning it and i gave them a few sources to play with, 
  let me tell ya , i just saw a pot of `` pantumaca '' in carrefour ( looked like smashed tomatoes ) . 
  written like that . 
  then again , i live in probably the most spanish-ised city of catalonia and people i guess saw that as a delicatessen so they thought that it would sell as that . 
  so you ** need ** to apply the tomato correctly , there 's a whole ritual behind it , not just a pot full of cramped tomatoes, 
  but we know that the french chef that made the first cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e for the king actually based his recipe on the catalan one , that 's the difference . 
  also , you could argue that any type of cake was invented by the egyptians following your logic, 
  well yes , because cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is not crema catalana , rather being a french interpretation of the dessert . 
  the actual origin of crema catalana is unknown ( as most old recipies are ) but it has certanly been tracked down to books from the xiv like i said before, 
   it 's current form is recorded from 1691 source please ? 
  here 's mine : the two medieval books of catalan cuisine where this recipe was first written [ 1 ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ca&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ca&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fca.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fllibre_de_sent_sov%25c3%25ad&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) , [ 2 ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ca&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ca&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fca.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fllibre_del_coch&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) and yeah , i 've also read the catalan creme article in english from the wikipedia . 
  do you really think a paragraph is all it takes to state that ? 
  do it !, 
  ( just do n't over-do it ) it adds a lot !, 
  also make sure that you 're using the catalan recipe and not the french one if you want all the ingredients to mix properly , there 's a world of difference !, 
   also i 'm pretty sure the french one is the original ehhh no , we have books of people eating it from the medieval ages , belive me , it 's a * really * * really * old recipe . 
  but hey , whatever floats yer boat , just try the original if you can , it has a totally different taste !, 
  have you tried putting some lemon rasps and vainilla ? 
  oh god it 's so goooooood, 
  taste ours !, 
  it 's the original and i 've found a world of difference between other countries attemps and ours !, 
  also , creme brulee is an adaptation to the french cuisine , and loses pretty much any personality ... 
  i found it pretty bland if you ask me . 
  ( remember , you can order it with burned candy or without it - sense cremar - here ), 
  do you people know [ of the best dessert in the world ] ( http://fotos.starmedia.com/imagenes/2012/01/crema_catalana.jpg ) ? , because if not , you 're missing out , crema catalana is da best !, 
  no , they did n't ( i guess he says that because it 's in use already as a church but it 's also being built ) . 
  also it is n't a cathedral and probably never be , we already have one . 
  because they play as spain , our players are n't allowed to play with the quatribarrada , which is heavily restricted by the central gov and only plays a match each year, 
  excelent , though i 'll only be dutch when they kick spain 's ass ... let 's just say that things were getting out of hand here with all this hype, 
  cmoooooon holland i do n't care about this corrupt tournament but if this makes my neighbours shup up i 'm 100 % dutch !, 
  that 's the kind of politician that we need !, 
  thanks !, 
  enlighten me , what are the diferences ? 
  you neoliberlist crazy mofo xd !, 
  i did it on the political compass [ and got this ] ( http://www.politicalcompass.org/facebook/pcgraphpng.php?ec=-6.12&amp;soc=-7.03 ), 
  did n't happen , had to call twice and after being told in german in a really altered voice that they did n't speak english , i had to switch to my crappy german ( thank god for my a2 grade that i got just before ! ), 
  and work from there, 
  i do n't even ... where [ do you got all that crap from ? 
  ] ( http://transparencia.gencat.cat/img/info_deficit_fiscal_es.jpg ), 
  went to germany , sister was sick , had to find a hospital , emergency number guy did n't speak english , called again , did n't also speak english , used meine schlecht deutsch and kinda succeded , grabbed a cab ... 
  the guy did n't speak english . 
  oh , and it was berlin, 
  well i 'm sorry i used a word that describes what happened without going into detail using the wikipedia as a source ... 
  this is not askhistorians you know ? 
   no , i 'm not talking about spanish debt , i 'm talking about the debt of the money directly invested in catalonia , or their townhalls , provinces and such . 
  national debt does n't work like that , you could say the same for the rest of spain if you wanted  eso supondr\u00eda una deuda del 26 % del pib , como hemos mencionado antes . 
  look at what your page says if we would n't take your debt ( which is pretty possible )  he investment in catalu\u00f1a is pretty much the biggest of the country by the way [ really ? 
  well . . then spain does n't invest shit in their regions if that 's the case ] ( http://transparencia.gencat.cat/es/infografia_deficit_fiscal.html ) - fiscal deficit is the amount of money that catalans send to spain and is n't reinvested , this money * is n't * taken in account in your article by the way , and let 's not forget that spain aslo owes money to catalunya that does n't want to pay , so we pretty much got justification if we do n't want to assume any of the spanish debt at all , after all , it is spanish , not catalan  in any case , you are n't forced to take anything because you ca n't separate in the first place . 
  we 'll see about that friend , with around 58-62 % of the population for independence i ca n't see * how we ca n't * separate, 
   so it was n't some counties that merged , but a king that selected a count as a husband for her daughter , so their descendants would inherit both territories , and more that they would conquer later . 
  that 's a plain definition of merge , actually .
