   about the downfall in the xvth century : the crown of aragon became a part of the spanish monarchy after the dynastic union with castile , which supposed the de facto unification of both kingdoms under a common monarch . 
  i do n't refer to that , i 'm referring to the caspe pact , in which the trast\u00e0mara dinasty took the throne , but you could use that aswell . 
  the downfall was obviously that it was n't a equal union , castille , with it 's colonial kingdom , was more powerful than aragon and even in catalonia catalan itself was only spoken by the plebs at that point . 
   because spain , for the last 300 years has been moving all of its industry to that region uh hu , that 's actually the opposite of true . 
  spain did n't do ** shit ** for us this last 300 years apart from banning our language , ** we ** set up our own shit while spain was `` focused '' on herding cabras and farming . 
  yes , you can search it , the first impulse of the catalan nationalism goes back to the xixth century when the catalan burgeois wanted more inversions in indrustrialitzation for the rest of spain while the central gov spent the money for farmers in the south . 
  that , by the way , keeps happening . 
  just go to google earth and look at the south of the penninsula . 
  do you see a sea of white greenhouses ? 
  it is actually the largest concrentration of them * in the world * . 
  it 's just a big ol' joke , we need out . 
   though that is no longer happening [ yeah , right ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ca&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.lavanguardia.com%2fpolitica%2f20121010%2f54352442678%2fwert-admite-interes-espanolizar-alumnos-catalanes.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) ... that 's just one example out of thousands , i 'll admit that we 're not as prosecuted as when we were ruled * by a dictator * ( huh , curious right ? ), 
  but we still are . 
  that 's not true actually . 
  we are n't forced to take * any * of the spanish debt because it is n't ours , so we would be fine . 
  and if we took it , it would be according to the investment rate that goes back to catalonia ( which is by the way , abismally low and that 's why we are secceding ) , so we would be fine either way . 
  what parties ? 
  do n't make me laugh , we 're 62 % here !, 
  but yeah , it would be impossible for us to organise a referendum with the spanish constitution so sadly , the only option is to disobey it, 
  [ buuuuuuuuuuut you did n't take a foto of the entire chain did n't you ] ( http://gigafoto.assemblea.cat/index.php?lang=en ) ? 
  and in terms of participation/total population we * did * beat you , 2 milion out of 7 is really a lot . 
  tell that to the english wikipedia , it comes from there, 
  today , 5000 `` castellers '' and 70 associations `` colles '' ( 85 % of the active community ) are organised around the world . 
  [ here is their official page ] ( http://www.omnium.cat/catalanswanttovote ), 
  well ... til catalans influenced english in something, 
  ... maybe not , i wrote it in catalan because i had no idea how it was in english, 
  yes and no , catalonia was the central part of the kingdom of aragon , but the kingdom is older than that . 
  the counties of barcelona ( catalonia ) and arag\u00f3n ( situated westward from barcelona ) merged in the xiith century , thus creating the crown of aragon , ruled by a catalan dinasty until the xvth century , when it all went downfall . 
  so , kings were crowned in saragossa ( capital of arag\u00f3n ) and had the court and palace in barcelona , were the cancelleria ( one of the oldest parliments in the world , if not the oldest - fun fact : we the catalans claim to have invented modern regulated monarchy , not the brits - ) was established and pretty much all the trade happened, 
  yeah , but i like to belive that we the catalans are somewhat hipsters and made it mainstream again, 
  nah , because `` castille '' itself just does n't exist anymore , and spain still has kingdoms ( like granada or galicia ) , so even then it would n't work . 
  and keep in mind that aragon would still be in spain, 
  [ i hear ya !, 
  ah , that was * the * other organitzation that could do it ... well , fifty fifty ... 
  yeah , he has always been pro-independence and has close ties with anc ( the organization behind almost all of the massive catalan demonstrations ) which i suspect is organising this event, 
  let 's see what berliners denkt of our towers !, 
  i know , i know , i live there ... 
  but the current `` opinion '' is that , even if these next days many people will make demonstrations and such for a republic , they wo n't get it . 
   foodstuffs have insecticide built in to them this is the misinformation that i refer to . 
  gmo alter genes . 
  why people do n't have a problem with gm bacteria * with human genes * that produce insule * that is consumed * by people but do when we alter a plant to be more resistant to plagues , even when that does n't affect in any way ( and due to genetics we are 100 % sure of this , because well , genes work that way ) they do ? 
  even with this , spain wo n't be a republic ... 
  they are too conservative and stuck in the past , even when the past is corrupt and degrading for the whole country . 
  in my opinion , the most probable way of me having my house in a republic is a ) catalan republic b ) proclaiming my house a republic itself, 
  do they ? 
  i 'm not so sure about that, 
  do n't go so fast , we live in a capitalist society so of course they will invest in trying to relocate patents to us . 
  that is prosecuted , but there are legitimate ways to invest in gmo 's that do n't involve gene patents, 
  no , of course , because as i said , they are under patent protected by the us government . 
  basically europe, 
  but that 's because the us let genes be patented . 
  it 's not like that in other countries and that is how it should stay . 
  gmo 's are a great way of solving world 's problems if used correctly and we should n't throw away such a powerful tool like that . 
  and i do n't either , but their interpretation of anarchism vagely resembles what it was before , when it was conceived, 
  that is not chemical herbicide , but an adaptation to make it resistant to such, 
  well , i 'm for a sensible use of gmo 's obviously . 
  what they are doing out there does n't discredit the fact that gmo 's are potentially able to end hunger in places of need , and this is something that is sadly overlooked, 
  well maybe , but anarchism is pacific by definition and belive me , i 've got personal reasons to belive that . 
  my family has been involved in anarchism since my great-grandfather and i wo n't abandon that idea . 
  maybe anarchism has been deformed so much that violence is now one it 's traits , but that for me is n't anarchism , that is , as i said , just a deformation of what it once was . 
  i read it . 
  what ? 
  chemical herbicie is n't related at all by gmo , in fact it may be what hinders yields . 
  then the argument that the gmo 's are the ones doing it would be invalid , too many variables ( and objectibly it does n't make any sense , gmo do n't hinder at all the reproductivity of a plant for example ), 
  they can be more resistant to plagues , natural disasters and so on . 
  and by the way , we already use gmo when producing things like insule ( do you know that it comes from gm bacteria with human genes ? ) . 
  in an objective point of view , gmo are more practical in the sense that we can choose which caracteristics we want and reject the undesired ones , so in theory , with the correct modifications , gmo should yield more . 
   some judges do n't agree with you ... read the article , that was because there was no * law * about that until 1996 . 
  and because there was n't a sentence about that * back then * the law that applies is the current one . 
  and that one stipulates that if something owned by someone is usurpated , the owner has all the right to kick them out . 
   since 15m nothing changed , we 've been beaten and beaten and beaten over again . 
  anger does n't validate anything , in fact , it desligitimates arguments . 
   what is your definition of `` anarchist '' ? 
  a society ruled by direct democracy , without state , that values cooperation instead of competition and is utopian by definition , due to having to suppose that every indivudial is altrusit and desires to help the other as much as they value themselves, 
  gmo do not carry diseases in any way and if they 're viewed as `` bad '' in europe is just due to misinformation . 
  i 'm sorry , but i wo n't buy any of this, 
   not all of them , but many are . 
  okupas , you know ... okupas are n't anarchist , they just appropiated the term  let 's just ignore the police-brutality in the clearance of the building that was legally ) ( ! ), 
  theirs . 
  this is a tu quoque fallacy that does n't justify in any way the acts of the can vies `` freedom fighters '' ... really , they needed to use violence ? 
  i 'm not ok at all with that  edit : link does n't work , it misses a ) which reddit does n't allow -  http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ocupaci%c3%b3n_ ( derecho ) [ 2 ] also this is bullshit , when you occupy something you obviously know that it is n't yours , that building is state owned since the 20 ', 
  [ bcn , an hour ago ] ( https://scontent-b-mad.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/t1.0-9/1958470_792772217413558_2852501634118538965_n.jpg ), 
   anarchists that 's not what anarchism is , they are n't anarchists and while they keep throwing molotovs they 'll never be . 
  in my opinion violence never justifies your claim , it only discredits it , can vies lost it 's legitimacy to make a point when they did n't reject the ways in which `` the opressed '' started trowing molotovs `` because they were tired of the system '' . 
  well , then why the representants of can vies do n't condemn violence althogheter ? 
  they just ignore that issue, 
  it 's pretty hot down there in sants , with more than 53 trash containers burnt and indiscriminate use of molotov 's that has n't been rejected by the can vies representants . 
  yes , the police is also horrible and has for example broken into a newspaper that talked shit about them , but they use violence and i 'm not ok with that , even with all the crap that l'ajuntament has trown at them . 
  edit : this just came in : the police is even more retarded than i thought it was , [ they forced protestors ] ( http://directa.cat/noticia/els-mossos-encapsulen-manifestants-els-obliguen-fotografiar-se-encaputxats ) - first video on the right - to take their police identification fotos with the hoodies on , to make them appear as `` violent '' . 
  that newspaper by the way , is the one that i referred earlier . 
  nah , i was just giving my opinion, 
  well , other maps have tried it and not totally failed , but i guess that if you divide a country in regions and the other one is left in one unit someone could think that the second is also didived and the people 's party won everywhere ( which is what i thought before reading the title closely , woops ) . 
  for spain i 'd go for comunidades autonomas , uk countries , germany landen , france regions , etc. 
  it 's not perfect , but it shows more than with constituencies, 
  as i said , for example here in catalonia the people 's party is pretty irrelevant apart from making absurd statements like `` the catalans are nazis '' and so on , and seeing catalonia painted in blue could led to thinking that they were the winners here . 
  the fact that exist discrepancies in each state with the constituecies does n't make this a good unit to show it on a map . 
  i think that directly showing regions or states would be better imho, 
  then you 'll agree with me that it can lead to misinterpretation, 
  so in catalonia the left-wing independentists won , followed by the center-wing independentists . 
  the people 's party came fifth with less than the 10 % of the votes .
