  if you 're going to do regions , do them all please, 
  but is a win nonetheless, 
   among the large countries , only germany and italy have governing parties that have won in the european elections sadly , spain should be there also, 
  yeah right of course , madrid is drug free !, 
  oh alright , so second option it is, 
  hey , we do n't hate podemos ... they might be a copycat of cup but they 're a good copy anyway ... have n't seen their pronouncement on our right to auto-determination but that does n't matter now . 
  or we 're you referring to the bunch of semifascists that call themselves upyd ? 
  they do n't even know what two thirds of their name mean !, 
  union : the only part of their name that they understand so they embrace it way over their heads , progres : ha ! , democracy : hahahahahah, 
  in catalonia we 're getting a record participation of about the 47 % , many of them belived to have been voters of independentist parties ( the two most important ones are the ones that will came on top , but nobody knows if the moderate or the leftwing will be the actual winner ) , so this election is considered a win for seccessionism . 
  many pp followers came to catalonia from other regions of spain in order to oversee ( and probably , as it has sadly been seen , manipulate the ballots putting them inside the envelopes or trying to hide other parties ballots ) as many tables as possible , though i hope this does n't alter the result that much edit : results just came in : erc , the leftwing independentist party has just won it 's first elections with a 23,6 % of the votes , with a rise from 14,4 % and the moderare ( ciu ) got 21,8 % . 
  the next party , the socialists got a big blow with only the 14,2 % of the votes , when they won last time , losing around 21 % of the votes from the last elections, 
  and well ... catalonia ( 7,5 mil ) is divided in 4 provinces as any spanish region ( which they could have included in more transparent lines ) , but also into 41 `` comarques '' ( equivalent to counties ) and we have more divisions like the `` diputacions '' or the `` municipalitats '', 
  yeah , but as much as i like cup , they are eurosceptic ... and i ca n't agree with that , so i would n't vote them in the european elections even if they presented, 
  catalonia : maybe erc ( esquerra republicana de catalunya - left republican party of catalonia - ) , the mainstream independentist party or ciu ( converg\u00e8ncia i uni\u00f3 - nationalist and independentist but center - ) , which traditionally has always been in front over all the other parties but lately has been struggling to keep up with erc . 
  these two parties alone might even get +50 % of the votes and are n't the only ones that call for independence ( though they are the two main ones ), 
  invasions and crap ... we got pushed to catalonia , but we used to be a lot bigger, 
  yeah , and lapao , and balear and whatever random language pp comes up next year, 
  nah , that 's due to catalans , basque and galicians identifiyng their language as mother tongue, 
  * catalan ? 
  what catalan ? 
  this is n't catalan , here we speak nalatac !, 
  it 's totes different guys !, 
  english , spanish , ein bisschen deutsch , catalan , valencian , lapao , and probably balear in a few years . 
  well , you do have a point . 
  sadly , it is known that spain not only halves our economic growth [ if you understand catalan , you should take a look into this report ] ( http://www.tv3.cat/videos/4557282/ramon-carner-la-independencia-unica-opcio-per-a-catalunya ) , where the guy behind the organitzation that i just show you explains his thoughts , and the few things that they vow to give us never arrive . 
  [ here is a full list of them , made by the catalan government ] ( http://blogs.elpais.com/files/deslealtad.pdf ) , called `` report of disloyalty '' . 
  those reasons that you want do exist , sadly they seem to be hard to find , due to the fact that we are * in a political campaing * and because of that there 's a lot of light-press and infographics trying to convince people . 
  i did n't find it that bad , honestly ... 
  i mean , it 's directed to the public , because that 's the main target for people to convince , but it 's quite good ... of course , not all that they write is good , like everybody . 
  ( [ good example of what i mean ] ( http://www.ccncat.cat/ca/estudis-i-informes/espoli-fiscal ) ), 
  well , i gave you that guy , sala-i-martin ... 
  these ones are the ones that supply the common public with the pampflets ... [ these guys ] ( http://www.ccncat.cat/ ) are more in-depth, 
   generalitat 's `` foreign action '' budget that thing ? 
  we are only externalizing the process , nothing more, 
   utterly convinced that there were weapons of mass destruction in iraq yeah , but because they lent towards usa 's gov. 
  here do n't need to be biased and in theory they should be more reliable ... [ i 'm an idiot by the way : i did n't remember this page even existed ] ( http://economistes.assemblea.cat/wp/ ) there 's literally an assembly of economists ( economists for independence ) working on that which explains the economic effects on [ independence ] ( http://economistes.assemblea.cat/wp/?page_id=2832 ) . 
  it 's not on english , though, 
   so you pulled that out of your arse . 
  well yes i did , i 'm lazy ( limitted time and lots of work ) and i do n't have an aswer for everything if i want a source behind . 
  without sources , i can tell you that i 've read articles from the economist , forbes and the nyt and they all agreed on the prosperity of a future catalonia . 
  if you want a catalan economist with international projection you should check [ sala-i-mart\u00edn ] ( http://salaimartin.com/ ) opinion - he was on davos , for example - and while i do n't agree with his opinion on other subjects - welfare state , for instance - he has given a lot of insight on why catalonia would succed . 
  he 's pretty famous here, 
  just look at [ this ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bnmeiuximaag2ph.jpg ) the newest example of the spanish government 's opinion : * the government will study persecuting insults in social networks due to the last wave of attacks against the recently assasinated politician * - she was known to be massibly corrupt * and from the gov 's party * - down : * ( margallo ) the minister of external affairs appointed consul at the diplomatic that referred to catalans as `` catalanes de mierda '' ( lit . 
  catalans of shit ) *, 
  [ here 's a list with some examples ] ( http://economistes.assemblea.cat/wp/?page_id=1026 ), 
  it is , they do n't have any interest in the outcome of our situation , in fact , they lean more against our success and yet they still give us economic surplus, 
  oh right , because they were biased then ... now it 's obvious that they are n't, 
  the point is that it has already been demostrated by internacional economical agencies that the pros outnumber the cons, 
  nah , we have reasons backing us, 
  not in that sense , since when have we been independent in modern times to prove our economical stability ? 
  i do n't want to say it but ... it might have been [ too edgy for them ] ( http://us.123rf.com/400wm/400/400/shutterbox/shutterbox0708/shutterbox070800315/1482483-stump-of-just-cut-down-tree.jpg ), 
  assimilation : years gone by , most of them will realise that it is n't worth to go against the stream when they are actually living better and they 'll just shut up . 
  i 'm not saying that they wo n't be idiots , i 'm saying that they 'll be a lot less `` vocal '' than now, 
  but it is pretty obvious , do you think that it 's the first time that we have to see something like this ? 
  yeah , but spanish nationalism would drop in a few years . 
  that i can garantee, 
  the survivors need economic support !, 
  how will their before dependant relatives now live ? 
  what does that do with idiots cutting one of our national symbols though ? 
  spanish police is n't that much better, 
  just one more in the long list of crap that we have to endure ... thankfully this wo n't last long !, 
  giving some background ( ** not ** in any case defending any position , just known facts ) : she held 13 titles at the same time in administration and different corporations , raised her own salary by 9000 a year in the middle of the crisis ( she earned 150.000 $ a year ) . 
  she never answered any periodist for that [ source ] ( http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/1238924/0/isabel-carrasco/politica-leon/pp/ ), 
  that 's what economists are for ( and they succesfully demonstrated that an independent catalonia would fare astonishingly well - as well as denmark for example - without bias , since it has been proven worldwide ) , we do n't need to use our country like a test subject for an x amount of years . 
  just catalan , spaniards are too lazy to even have monies in the first place, 
  we 're not tight fisted okay ? ... 
  * we just enjoy our precious , precious money *, 
  it 's what here call [ chonis ] ( http://vampida.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/chonis3.jpg ) + bad singing ( is that english ? ), 
  + traditional dresses as an excuse to do all that ... not the best entry imho, 
  and what about andorra ? 
  our twelve points have to come from somewhere ya know ? 
  even more fun than that , modern odessa was founded by a [ catalan admiral ] ( http://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/josep_de_ribas_i_boyons ) of the russian navy, 
  the fact that we like them does n't mean that they are the best . 
  chikilicuatre would want a word or two with you, 
  i just saw the video and ... 
  i mean , it sounds pretty good ( even if it 's like 100 % generic ) but ... this is last year 's romania , honestly, 
  strict spain ? 
  i 'm sorry but i do n't follow : spain is catholic , catholics ususally are n't open about homosexuality , but spain is . 
  what i am saying is that i 'm surprised about that . 
  no , but spain as a whole is , so that includes other regions that are * more * catholic than catalonia, 
  and as i said , i belive that the aceptance comes more from a cultural level than a religious one . 
  i could use your example to further prove my point , for instance . 
  well ... answer is easy : not voting them . 
  thankfully we 're in a democracy so in the eu elections we can show that we do n't really belive in this crap that only fills speeches , instead voting for another party ( though we might be out of luck : iniciativa and izquerda unida are federalists who do n't define their stance on the national issue , i belive that cup - if they were present in the elections - would fuck up the country and erc ... they might be the best option , but they 're not the best party ever ) . 
  but remember that something such as the * conferencia episcopal * controls most of the spanish catholic churches and helped the writer . 
  those guys are insane , and you just need to look on google to find out why . 
  yes , but i think that it is too late : the spanish common folk do n't belive in getting power taken * from them * ( this argument i 'm sure would be used by anti-fed ) and given to others ( other states - eu or any federalitzation - ) , thus essentially losing their privileges as a centralised state . 
  also , a lot of spanish comunidades are actually made up and a federalitzation model that includes them would only suck tax money ( this being the more probable scenario instead of an objectivization of what is and is n't a state in the to-be-federation ) . 
  last thing : we , the catalans , are actually tired of trying this sort of things , and would never accept anyting less than a referendum like the one that is scheduled for the 9th of november ( in which btw , there is a federal option ) . 
  sadly - or not for me - , seccecionism accounts for around the 62 % in the last poll that went live this week, 
  i actually do n't think so ... 
  i mean , they just published a book about how to be a `` good wife '' ( that 's the title , by the way ) that is so badshit extremist that does n't even comulgate with the rest of the catholic church outside spain , but their policy agaisnt homosexuality is as strong as divorces * and * abortion, 
  well ... 73 % of the population claims to be ... 
  though as i just discussed with other redditors , that might not mean much, 
  i suppose that might explain why ... 
  though i think that it is a more deep rotted cultural thing , people here are usually more open and accept this sort of things ... 
  well , * we * the catalans tried to start the republic of iberia in the 30 ' by declaring ourselves a part of that federated state ... 
  guess what happened ? 
  all the politicians were imprisioned and later , president llu\u00eds companys became the only known democratically elected president to be executed in modern history,
