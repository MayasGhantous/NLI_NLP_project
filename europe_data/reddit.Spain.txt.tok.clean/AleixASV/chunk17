  you 've never heard of the level in which the spanish church takes it 's claims ? 
  they are quite the thing ... 
  but i would guess that it 's due to a cultural acceptance of differences , ignoring the religious mandates, 
  same-sex marriage ? 
  yeah , he 's part of the pp scum that vows to the right-wing catholics of the episcopal who literally just claimed that we ( the independetists ) are staging a civil war * at the funeral * of the first pm in modern democratic spain, 
  i find odd that someone says that they are christian ( and catholic ) but belive that there is no god or doubt on their existance . 
  you can go thrugh all thoose rites being an athesist or agnostic without declaring themselves as christian . 
  i guess that 's why the stats look bulged . 
  in my case , my parets waited for me to decide what would i belive in later and did n't baptise me , but i have met a lot of people who had and did their communion , but i did n't knew that thoose counted automatically as christians ( it should be done in polls , honestly ), 
  indeed it could be that , especially in a country like spain with many traditions involving cristian rites . 
  but agnosticism ( someone who does not belive ) is n't about that , and here we are talking about * catholics * who do belive in the christian god , so it could be about the cultural aspect of the rites ( we have many traditions involving the church , so that could be why ), 
  could be , but i have never met someone that thinks this . 
  ... but that does n't make any sense ... are they `` pretending '' to be catholic just for personal interest ? 
  it 's the only reason that i can think of, 
  well , living here ( even while being in catalonia , that is the less religious part of spain ) i have seen wide acceptance , but that does n't mean that ca n't i find it surprising , especially comparing it to other countries, 
  around 73 % of spaniards are catholic , living in eivissa or not , so yeah ... 
  ... well of course , there are other countries there , i just pointed that out, 
  i always found really surprising the general acceptance of homosexuality in a country as catholic as spain, 
  well ... yeah `` investigated '' ... 
  the judges that had given fair results that harmed their interesests are being prosecuted and kicked out of their jobs ... 
  they just use corruption to have arguments against the other party ( pp vs psoe ), 
  well yes , but that does n't mean anything , they ( that being ciu , the party that i assume you are referring to ) were nationalists to begin with and if their main target ( the fiscal pact ) failed they were n't going to just stand there doing nothing . 
  also , they are n't * radically * pro-idependence , they are pretty moderate . 
  so you know why cup - another party - did n't vote in favor of bringing to madrid our proposal for the referendum ? 
  because they did n't belive in letting the spanish congress vote , since its a catalan affair !, 
  so yeah , there are plenty of parties more indepentist than ciu ( uni\u00f3 - ci * u * which is a part of ciu - the party that you are referring ) is n't even independentist . 
  if you ever go to euskadi you 'll be greated with the weirdest language that a freak could imagine multiplied by 100 . 
  it 's soo cool but soo weird at the same time . 
  i thought they were speaking japanese with a russian accent !, 
  because sounds awesome . 
  * that * was the objective, 
  now both the basques and i are sad :( no love, 
  i 'm both , one can be a separatist for economic reasons for instance, 
  i 'm nationalist due to well ... threats from my state to abolish our culture piece by piece , so someone has to defend it . 
  i 'm totally pro-european , going as far as being eu-federalist in the long run , and most of us the catalans are at least pro-eu, 
  1 augustus 2 galileo galilei 3 charlemagne 4 isaac newton 5 columbus, 
  +1 for ignoring catalan as an official language ^ / s, 
  i was talking to do something a la iceland , but ovbiously i oversimplified it a lot . 
  catalonia has some of the best economists in the world and they are working in it, 
  yes , it means that we do n't need the laws that you mentioned to demonstrate that we are a nation , we did n't spawn out of nowhere when those laws appered . 
  in fact , we had already declared ourselves independent a couple of times already while being in spain . 
  we existed before that ... catalonia is * way * older than usa , just fyi, 
  stupid i know right ? 
  loopholes !, 
  they exist, 
   unless catalonia ascends to the european union see , that 's where you are wrong : there is no text that says that . 
  you gain euro citizenship by joining with a country . 
  ** but ** there 's no regulation in when you lose it . 
  ... our nation ? 
  there 's no regulation in european citizens wainting to seccede from their own country , so even if that sounds obvious to you , there 's no law backing that statement . 
   you should n't have a american doing your research for you about your country and your region 's struggle to secede . 
  lol  no . 
  but you will lose it if spain vetos your membership . 
  i can guarantee it . 
  how ? 
  also , nobody said that we 're getting out of the eu , if we 're still eu citizens we 're obviously in the eu , and you just acknoledged that . 
  you 're contradicting yourself, 
  cite me the exact quote where they say that if you renounce to your state 's citizenship you also lose the european one . 
  it does n't exist . 
   unitary state . 
  that could mean centralised or decentralised ( france vs spain , two ** very ** diferent countries where structural integrity is concerned ) , by directly stating that spain is descentralised you already know that it is unitary . 
  i 'm an european citizen , spanish or not , if i leave my spanish citizenship it does n't mean that i leave the european one . 
  it does n't exist a treaty that specifies otherwise and i challenge you to find it ... lol, 
  well ... let 's see what happens when an unstoppable force runs into an immovable wall, 
  whatever , descentralised and unitary is not the same . 
  is more correct to say descentralised than unitary , because one implies more than the other . 
  even wikipedia specifies , and you quote it . 
  thing is , there 's no point about discussing wheter eu will have to vote for our admission , because there 's no law that specifies that we even have to get out in the first place !, 
  yeah , we may have secceded from spain , but we * have n't * from the eu , and no treaty says otherwise . 
   you are not in the european union if you secede because you are a new nation there 's no law or treaty that affirms that , seccesionism ( from inside the eu ) is * not * covered under any eu article . 
   so you 'd still have convince spain . 
  we wo n't . 
  when they 'll have to vote ( if they have to , which i doubt ) they 'll know that they trade * a lot * from catalonia ( we have the main port of the mediterranean sea in barcelona and we are the economical center of all southern europe ) and if we tax their goods they 'll lose a lot of money , so they 'll wo n't deny our admission ( and if they did , it would be * ridicoulous * , a part of western europe that is denied admission into the most democratic union in the world * because * they voted for their idependence ? 
  spain would lose credibility all over the wolrd , and they do n't want that )  and you are a unitary state actually , the term used is * descentralized * . 
  not unitary , not centralized , not federal . 
  even if madrid does n't want it , we have our own chamber , and good luck with madrid tacking that from us . 
  ** that ** would be funny . 
  it 's a seccesion , not a split ... 
  so we would be an entirely new state , and spain wo n't be a succesor of anything . 
  if they try go get their powers back ( taxes , etc. ), 
  good luck to them , we wo n't listen ... also , if there 's a democratic will of the people to seccede from spain , the eu will * force * spain to free our nation . 
  some countries of the eu have already acknowledged that if we ever win our referendum ( very possible ) we got their recognition . 
  also , we 're not a centralised state , i do n't know where you got that from , catalonia has it 's own parliment and therefore is a political enthity , with full fledged democratic elections held every four years ( and now with a majority of independentists in the national parliment and a 75 % support for the referendum ), 
   nation or a political entity read the definition of that somewhere ... 
   i do n't think you quite understand how the eu work . 
  actually , i do n't think that * you * know how the right of ** auto ** - determination works ... only a nation or a political entity ( not your house ) is able to hold a referendum and proclaim themselves independent ... that 's why spain does n't agree on us holding one : they do n't belive we are a nation ( bullshit by the way ) . 
  that 's why i belive you do n't understand how * eu * works, 
  but do you think that a demografic as big as a 56-54 % by recent polls will be stopped by just economic sanctions ? 
  what would happen if the catalan government just said `` oh hey , that debt ? 
  i do n't remember any debt '' and just did n't pay the spanish central bank . 
  that could probably create two things : the central government would embargo catalan taxes and redirect them to pay the debt ( coutered by a catalan taxing institution that negated the central government ) the catalan stock change would rise ... shortly stabilizing after investors realise that the region now is independent de-facto and safe to invest on ... 
  which they would do undoubtebly given it 's economic prosperity whathever way you look at it , it 's ovbious that the outcome is independence : we have a democratic majority , we are able to redirect our funds to our own governement ( give us maybe a month or two of cuts and economic harass from the central gov - which eu will hate and press to stop - ) and the political will to do it . 
  and i do n't think that the citizens will simply forget everything about this with some sanctions , that 's the typical spanish mistake that has pushed us to this situation : the more you sanction us , the more you critize us and seize our soverignty , the more people that will be conviced about independence . 
  3-3 it 's the obvious outcome ... and once we do the referendum ( hopefully ) and win it , the eu wo n't have an excuse to not recognise our cause and they 'll have to move their piece ... 
  probably recognising us as a sovereing state . 
  so catalonia only has 3 milion citizens less than your country and already a much better economy ( gdp * and * nominal figures ) ... 
  i do n't see why you should advocate against our independence arguing `` a black hand '' also ... 
  probably the stupidest argument i 've seen ... and belive me , madrid gives us plenty of shit ( which they * are * the elite and surprisingly enough * do n't * want our independence , who would have thought it right ? ), 
  no , our government sees our autonomy as exactly what you said : a nation without state , that 's why they claim to have the legitimacy to organise a referendum to actually * be * a state, 
  they go as far as trying to avoid our recognition as such ...
