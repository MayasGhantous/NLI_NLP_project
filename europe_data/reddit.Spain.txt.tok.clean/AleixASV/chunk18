  so yeah, 
  we 've been dealing with the problem that there is the misconception of the undivisible nature of spain . 
  it is n't true : galicia , the basque country and of course catalonia ( and its adjacent regions * pa\u00efsos catalans * if you want to englobe it all ) are nations outright , but the government tries to silence them . 
  that 's why spain would never accept a referendum : they belive that a region could n't vote , never understanding ( or even wanting to do so ) that the places that want to vote are n't regions , but nations . 
  and the norwegian ? 
  * * you thought i was going to say hippopotamus * * but we 've got too much oil to care for them ... * * or any other country really !, 
  * and chorus : * hipo-hipo-hipooocrisy !, 
  * * we like spendin ' money * * and boy do we also like to critique others ... * * just for thaaaaat !, 
  * that ... or `` what does the hippo say '' ... 
  both would win you eurovision , both are horrible . 
  edit : i see ... people do n't get the comical spirit of it all right ? 
  i see ... 
  oh god , but you know what ? 
  he knew he was n't going to win , he just lost in style ... and i apreciate that . 
  yes , you 're almost correct . 
  it is n't the flag of * catalonia * ( i think you 're speaking in english here ) but the * estelada * and therefore i do n't identify at all with the spanish flag or its uses, 
  honestly , you are n't even trying anymore ( who can blame you , though ), 
  oh really ? 
  does it mean that ? ... 
  til i guess too, 
  nope , it is just an old word for `` cake '' . 
  it does n't mean cute or monkey , the other two meanings in catalan, 
  we eat that but in a cake , we call it [ `` la mona '' ] ( https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vanguk9tfjw/t4pywza86bi/aaaaaaaaezc/f93zvoezvk8/s1024/mona%2520xoco%25201.jpg ) and btw , you 're all doing it wrong , easter is tomorrow ... !, 
  easter in catalonia is tomorrow and we 'll be eating [ la mona de pasqua ] ( https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vanguk9tfjw/t4pywza86bi/aaaaaaaaezc/f93zvoezvk8/s1024/mona%2520xoco%25201.jpg ) a homemade cake usually made with chocolate and decorated with chocolate eggs and little chicks on it . 
  reporting news that azerbajan has been atacked with sources from azerbajan ? 
  this sounds a little biased ... 
  i have n't seen or watched that article . 
  you might be right , but i ca n't really answer to that . 
  and no , you are n't doing demagogy , but the media report that you linked clearly was ... 
  he indeed was joking ... and even if he was n't , it 's one comment versus an infinity of hatred that we have to deal * daily *, 
  [ i got it from here , the first google result : an antology of insults ... 
  it ca n't be subjective because they are just quotes , so what are you implying ? 
  how can `` retarded '' or `` nazi-like '' not be offensive ? ] ( http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/4171941/20140207/antologia-dinsults-catalans-catalunya.html ) ... 
  and i do n't see what you are saying with that ... illiterate is an insult as far as i know also , oh , i 'm sorry , he was joking ... that 's why he did n't want to coment on it and why he said it in that tone ... looks like someone likes some good old ' e demagogy am i right ? 
  and furthermore : `` tenia que ser catalan '' said one lady in that video ( he had to be catalan ! ), 
  which is in itself an insult deep-rooted that further proves my point, 
   `` we will have our referendum it does n't matter what the court says '' , its not like you are offering something , that is just an ultimatum we just said that ... 
  i 'm talking about l'estatut ( a sort of autonomy pact ) or the fiscal pact , both failed attempts just use google translator ... 
  i get your idea , but a country can not hold one of it 's parts and do not let it vote when the 85 % of it 's population wants to and has elected a new government * fully * implicated in this matter . 
  if we ca n't do it via the spanish constitution ( no one expected that to happen anyway , the constitution is archaic , corrupt and unflexible ) we 'll do it with our own legitimacy , with our own ruling chamber emmiting laws to regulate our referendum . 
  no , because * we * the catalans are the ones that seccede , so we are the only ones with the right to vote , hence the name `` right of * auto * - determination '', 
  in the 9th of november, 
  we have dealt too much time with spanish 's bullshit , the rise in independentism came beacause of the refusal of other options offered by our government to madrid ( more autonomy , etc. ), 
  and the continued insults that came from there . 
  we now see no choice but to die as a nation or become a state, 
  they are trying at least, 
  saying that democracy is based on law and not the other way around just invalidates the main premise of democracy : that it is based on people . 
  that os why we 'll do it anyway ( and , if you 're worried about the legal aspect do n't suffer : we 'll aprove promptly a * catalan * law permitting ourselves to organise a referendum , we abide by catalan law , not spanish one ), 
  they rejected every chance for us to vote , but they ca n't understand that we 'll do it anyway , because democracy is not voting once every four years like they want to belive, 
  well it 's weird , because here in catalonia , we have nationalist right , left far-right and far-left ... 
  so it makes sense to point it out, 
  one day you 'll have to debate something important for you in your life , and when your only argument is that the other is wrong , you 'll be feeling sorry for yourself . 
  that 's why i say that you do n't have arguments : because you base every single one yours in attacking mine , even when the eu is a democratic union that * values * democracy ( hurdur ) and economical stability , both things guaranteed by catalonia . 
  also , it is obvious that in the 21 century spain ca n't force one of it 's regions to stay in it 's country if that region has voted not to , so eu will have to recognise us anyway . 
  whatever happens , we will we recognised , it is obvious . 
   i 'm sorry , am i oppressing you ? 
  who can reasonably argue with someone that does n't value reason ? 
  instead of giving me your bases you just harass me ... 
  absolutely everything that you just said is bullshit and has n't been based on anything ... you 're just making shit up and it 's hilarious . 
  i 've got a fucking country backing me up . 
   if we have some sort of democratic proof backing us in our decision ( which is what we 're going to get in our referendum ) the eu will recognise us as a soverign entity and thus we 'll be an independent country of course we will !, 
  we did n't kill anybody !, 
  some baltic countries ( latvia , for example ) have already said that they will do so once we win the referendum . 
   democracy is n't enough for secession , otherwise my house would be a sovereign state . 
  do you think my house is a sovereign state ? 
  no , it 's not . 
  the right for auto-determination does n't work like that . 
  is your house a nation ? 
  did n't think so . 
  stop saying bullshit . 
  europe will recognise us because they wo n't have a reason not to do it and they 'll win a trading partner with a gdp equivalent of denmark and * a lot * more stable than spain . 
   what does democracy have to do with international politics ? 
  that , my friend , is the law . 
  and this :  if we have some sort of democratic proof backing us in our decision ( which is what we 're going to get in our referendum ) the eu will recognise us as a soverign entity and thus we 'll be an independent country is the will of the people . 
  we are a democratic momevent that cares little for what spain or europe say or force us to do , we will vote and act accordingly to that . 
  we 'll see who is naive , the one that belives in laws or the one that belives in people, 
  ... this is how democracy works i am afraid, 
  how could they deny us our independence if we have clearly expressed in a referendum that we want it ? 
  some countries ( the baltic states ) already have said that they 'll give us their support once we have voted, 
   suffered is maybe the wrong word well , as you can see , i 'm not english but hey !, 
  there is n't a lot of internal immigration nowadays and from the people that i have met ( i live in one of the most immigrated cities in all catalonia , so i do have experience in this ) there 's mixed opinions : while some would want an independent catalonia , others do n't . 
  the first wave is more conservative , while the second tends to be more pro-independentist . 
  if we have some sort of democratic proof backing us in our decision ( which is what we 're going to get in our referendum ) the eu will recognise us as a soverign entity and thus we 'll be an independent country, 
  it has already been stated that spanish is a language of catalonia as catalan itself . 
  i 'm independentist and speak to more than half of my friends only in spanish . 
  you have to understand that our country suffered a heavy influx of immogration from southern poor spanish provinces , so we do n't have a problem with integration . 
  thanks !, 
  we need this sort of thinking in madrid , they do n't seem to get it . 
  thank you so much !, 
  we did , and not only that : we made * a foto * ( a single one ) of the entire [ chain ] ( http://rcstatic.cat/img/17990/via-catalana.jpeg ) , called [ `` la gigafoto '' which is the largest foto in existence ] ( http://gigafoto.assemblea.cat/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=136&amp;itemid=201&amp;tram=1&amp;lang=en ), 
  well , last year we pulled it off . 
  official sources and public media claimed to be around 1.5 milion to 2 milion ( yeah , no one had a guaranteed figure due to the unique way in which the human chain was organised ) , so in this case , being much * much * easier to organise ( since we wo n't be having to form a line from the top of the country to the bottom , instead just filling streets with people ) and having a clear objective to shoot for ( the 300th aniversary of spain 's invasion and the 9n referendum ) i think we 'll manage to accomplish it . 
  we might be already famous for this sort of stuff , but this might be the cherry on top of the cake, 
  shouting will not get you anything done, 
  oh crap ... google has lied to me !, 
   for the last bit , i assume what it 's meant is that independence will be proclaimed in 2015 provided that the referendum shows the majority of catalans are in favor of course , we 're organising a democratic process  with that , a second referendum should be made , at the very least , asking citizens if they want to catalonia to declare independence from spain . 
  no , it 's a referendum with three possible answers : remain as we are , some type of federation or independence  all in all , i 'm happy that the parliament in catalonia is moving forward with a democratic referendum . 
  thanks :d !, 
  we 've given spain around 40 years of democracy to see if they could fix their shit and have a decent country where you 're not frequently insulted in tv for being catalan and having a diferent opinion than theirs . 
  they have n't done that so we 're leaving,
