  it has been decided unanimously that the next 11 of september ( our national day ) the [ diagonal avenue ] ( http://www.anycerda.org/web/imagen/1244679407.foto1.tbl_imagenes.0/diagonal080908-7590.jpg ) ( the largest on barcelona ) and the [ gran via avenue ] ( http://imgur.com/ckveitc ) will be filled with at least 2 milion people to push for independence , forming a `` v '' of victory in its intersction . 
  it has also been decided that we 'll declare ourselves independent in 2015 ( unilaterally , having first our referendum on the 9th of november this year ) edit : i fucked it up on one of the fotos because i 'm an idiot and use google images wrong, 
  because it 's not a split , it 's a secession , hence the name `` right of * auto * - determination '', 
  because the catalans * are the ones * who are spliting from spain, 
  but they ca n't decide on other people 's affairs , that would be like you claiming to have the right to vote in canada 's elections because their economic policy affects your country, 
  that makes absolutely no bloody sense . 
  the ones that want to be independent are the ones that need to be asked if they want to be . 
  you wo n't ask your neighbour if you should or not buy a table . 
  that 's exacly what 's already happening with their threats , so yes, 
  sadly * ( not really ) * we probably wo n't :p !, 
  we 've been trying to cooexist for plenty of years since our occupation by spanish troops ( in 1714 and 1936 are both examples ) and we have always come to the conclusion that we have no reason to stay with them , having plenty of them that push for independence . 
   i think that if we 're not there yet , we 'll soon be reaching a stage where violent riots are going to become standard practise in demonstrations across the country . 
  nope , they are minoritary and they will stay that way . 
  it 's just an excuse for the government to pass prohibitions on manifestations and for mass media to dramatizise the whole situation, 
  spain was around the 28 % somethings ( 20 % only in windpower ) in 2013 , and countring hydroelectric that should rise to 40 %, 
  a happy and magnificent anarchist flag , thanks putin !, 
  welp , i 'm an anarchist now ... should have seen it coming, 
  important to note that the press indentified themselves as that . 
  the police did not care, 
  so you know about our miracolous siege in 1714 ? 
  it probably is the defining moment in catalonias 's history and it is n't even mentioned . 
  i would link at least a wikipedia article to it ( siege of barcelona ) but the enlgish version is kinda crappy and i belive that it just talks about the successions war as a whole ... 
  anyway , glad that you read that !, 
  the catalan one is pretty cool ... as objective as it gets , though it jumps from the medieval era to the 19th century, 
  thanks !, 
  we need more of the scottish `` enthusiasm '' down here :p !, 
  what ? ... 
  i do n't even know where you got anything of what you said from ... 
  it 's all false , show me your sources !, 
  ( around a third of our parliment wants to do the referendum , the independentists are majority , we would live better without spain , yadayada , i do n't need to search it for you , do ya ? ), 
  first . 
  pp and psoe will ** never ** give us permission to organise a referendum , changing the consitution or not . 
  they simply wo n't do it . 
  secondly : ciu is not a party , it 's a federation of two , ( converg\u00e8ncia and uni\u00f3 ) , so divergences are expected . 
  ** basically they are saying that they will organise a referendum with the legality that they feel like it suits them ( for example , with a catalan law recently aproved by our own parliment , which was designed just for that ) , not ** with the consitution in mind ** edit : for those who ca n't undersand catalan , you can use google translator . 
  really now , teenage angst ? 
  we have tried at least 35 or so years of democracy to try to fit in spain and [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hksuil2llw ) is what we get ... we have many reasons , and by the way , thoose countries , especially estonia , are leading in many terms ( growth , research , start-ups , etc. ), 
  and * they * were ex-soviet states !, 
  with our gdp and economical power we 'll have many advantadges over them , once we 're freed from the spanish drain . 
  [ our president , mr. mas , said it here - google translated `` mas '' as `` more '' ... hilarious - ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ca&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ara.cat%2fpolitica%2fartur_mas-generalitat-negociar-consulta-25-n-psc_0_781121979.html&amp;act=url ) you should remember anyway that ciu is n't the only party in catalonia , and maybe not even the leading one at this point - recent polls say that erc goes first - so i do n't even know why you should ask this ... you should look at what our people is capable of doing for their independence instead , since they will be the ones to vote also , since i belive you can read spanish , read [ this ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/reforma_de_la_constituci%c3%b3n_espa%c3%b1ola ) and tell me if it 's possible or not to change the constitution ( and then also tell me if there is even the will to do so ), 
  since never , the will of the people has always been put upfront ( baltic states , for example ), 
  of course , from there it comes the hope of a better life, 
  well of course , i was referring to this : [ margallo sees and * absolut paralelism * between crimea and catalonia ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2factualidades.es%2fnoticias%2fmargallo-ve-un-paralelismo-absoluto-entre-el-refer%c3%a9ndum-en-crimea-y-la-consulta-en-catalunya ) just insulting ( margallo is the foreign - exteriors - minister of spain ) and he uses that argument, 
  if we vote in a referendum ( recognised by spain or not ) and the independentist option wins , the west will acknowledge our desire to leave spain and force our separation/recognise an unilateral declaration . 
  however , they will never regognise it , and the spanish constitution is impossible to change . 
  the main difference here is that the people of catalonia voted on their elections peacefully for a goverment that was able to garantee a referendum , legal or not , and it seems ridicously absurd to compare it to crimea , it 's even insulting to me, 
  with their crazy painters !, 
  yeeees !, 
  seems legit, 
  errr ... guys , algeria has gas , we 've been using a long time ago ... guys ? 
  well , they 'll broadcast a new episode today , so i guess they 're doing fine , quality has n't gone down * that * much ... 
  though it gets repetitive after a while , i 'll admit it . 
  telemaaaadrid !, 
  * yay * that 's why i love'em in apm !, 
  ( a kinda of zapping `` show '' that got way bigger than they expected ), 
  algerian gas ... spain does it . 
  that 's why we can say whatever we want , so in the end * we * are the most concerned ( in terms of actually doing - or saying - something about it , not as in `` really concerned '' , the countries borderning ukraine and dependent on russian gas obviously have the thoughest part here ), 
  what ? 
  the other way around : we care the most about ukraine because we would be the less afected by its consesquences , so we have less to lose and that allows our oportunists politicians to `` support '' the ukranians with fancy words and whatnot ( sadly more than most of the major eu countries ), 
  ... and fake passports , removing spanish flags from the townhalls , declaring themselves `` free catalan territory '' and so on, 
  yes , you 're the only one, 
  it 's barcelona and ... we do n't get that well with spain ... at all ... * yeah * ( check my flag , its a tell ! ), 
  barcelona at aftermath of the succesion war ( 1714 ) , they threw two bombs per citizen . 
  so do i , let 's harvest some of that * sweet sweet * moon nectar togheter and forget that catalonia has 210.000 m $ in gdp, 
  dimplomacy at it 's finest , ladies and gentleman !, 
  i hope you enjoy your bankrupcy once we 're freed from this shitty country, 
  oh sorry that we hurt you because we do n't like being treated like shit , here , take my apologises and oh please , banish my culture again , this time i 'll really like it ... and while you 're at it , you now my governtment , la generalitat ? 
  you can destroy it aswell !, 
  yes , why the catalans should speak in catalan ? 
  it 's soooo stupid , really !, 
  / sarcasm off we 'll face the consequences , the first being not having to deal with people like you , that get butthurt about our situation instead of fixing it . 
  what answer has madrid given to our national aspirations apart from a rotung `` no '' of literally everything we have proposed ? 
  we have grown tired of spain and we 'll happily become a new state , one in which your centralist politics will have no effect . 
  hope you like what you 've cast on yourself , since 10m people and the richest region on spain wo n't be needed to pay your distastrous economy right ? 
  ... that was the beggining of it ... we 've suffered enough humiliations from your government to not care about spain : last being the attempt at trying to finally consolidate catalonia and spain peacefully ( with the denial of our watered down estatut in 10 june , 2010 ) . 
  we 've had enough , your government is threatening our rights ( in terms of education , culture , economy ... ) and while we way have * some * cessions from madrid ( the few we have - compare them to scotland if you 'd like - ) they are getting denied with the many laws that nowadays come from madrid that ignore our competences ( the lomce , for example ) ... that 's not adding our economical spolitation ( that thing that some use to claim that `` espanya ens roba '' or `` spain robs us '' , with some truth backing it ) for example . 
  so we come to a conclusion : our country demands to vote for its freedom . 
  ** we ** will vote , whatever madrid says or does , we * do n't * care . 
  it 's simply that we wo n't accept another solution than the referendum : we tried to negotiate the fiscal pact , with a rotund * no * from rajoy . 
  now deal with the consequence ( also , independentists are now around 52-55 % following recent polls , so in my opinion the republic of catalonia will be independent no longer than two or three years from now , maybe less ) . 
  totally made up eh ? 
   angered by what he saw as sedition by the catalans and valencians and taking his native france as a model of a centralized state , philip v suppressed the institutions , privileges , and the ancient charters ( spanish : fueros , catalan : furs ) of almost all the areas that were formerly part of the crown of aragon ( aragon , catalonia , valencia , and the balearic islands ) . 
  the decrees ruled that all the territories in the crown of aragon except the aran valley were to be ruled by the laws of castile ( `` the most praiseworthy in all the universe '' according to the 1707 decree ) , embedding these regions in a new , and nearly uniformly administered , centralized spain . 
   the decrees effectively created a spanish citizenship or nationality , that judicially did not distinguish between castillian and aragonese anymore , both with respect to rights and law . 
  they abolished internal borders and customs except for the basque territory , giving grant to all spaniards to trade with american colonies ( not only castillians , as before ) . 
   top civil servants were appointed directly from madrid , the king 's court city , and most institutions in these territories were abolished . 
  court cases could only be presented and argued in castilian , which became the sole language of government , displacing latin , catalan and other spanish languages . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nueva_planta_decrees ) ( not citing by the way the demolishing of half barcelona to build la ciutadella or the constant bombardment of the city from monjuic or having or leaders on a pike in the main gate of the city for 50 years , etc. 
  ... i 'm talking about felipe v and his `` decreto de nueva planta '' but ok , if you wan na talk about franco , tell me : do you see how bad we have been treated by spain that you 're even getting our anihilations attemps mixed up ? 
  our language was forbidden , our political and governtment banished and our capital demolished and you call me a liar ? 
  learn some history ... 
  in an utopia , we would already have voted ... sadly , spain is far from that, 
  oh , but we have already done that and spain did n't accept it ( that 's the point of this thread , by the way ) . 
  our president said a while ago that 'd love to deal with the english gov instead of rajoy . 
  sadly , the meaning of democracy is n't the same here , and they call us `` anti-democratic '' for the fact that we want to vote ( which honestly , that does n't make a lot of sense ) thing is , if eu does n't help us , i 'm afraid that we 'll have to seccede uniretally from spain ( after making our own referendum with the catalan gov supervising it of course - and not the spanish , since they say that they 'll never allow it - ), 
  but he does n't interfere to allow us to vote either , so the point is still valid, 
  it means that since felipe v ( 1716 ) and the demolition of the aragonese crown , we have pretty much been a stomped minority , often even considered as a colony with lesser rights . 
  thankfuly we stoped to care about what the parliment said about four years ago , so no , we are not underwhelmed ... our parliment is the one from barcelona , look at what they say there, 
  the party that would allow the right of the catalans to vote would n't be elected in at least two decades and even if they say that we are not hated there , you try making them understand that their ideas are not the only ones in the world . 
  basically , outside of catalonia ( and a few political parties on the basque territories ) nobody would accept the catalans voting * ever *,
