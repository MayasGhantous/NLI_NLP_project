  what 's the problem with nauru ? 
  too much phosphate mining ? 
  [ a large body of people united by common descent , history , culture , or language , inhabiting a particular state or territory ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/nation ), 
  that constitution has only been voted by the 5 % of the alive population of spain ... and the alternative was left undecided to scare people into beliveing that there would be more fascism . 
  so no , an old piece of paper does n't cut it . 
  * law serves democracy * , not the other way around, 
  yup , in fact , we have never cared much about a constitution only voted by the 5 % of the total population alive * today on the whole spain * which back when they were asked to vote it was basically that or more fascism, 
  nope , catalonia is catalonia , a nation with right * to self-determination * . 
  do you know what `` self '' means ? 
  ... you 're missing something i feel ... the full name is * self-determination of nations * , besides , that 's cheap demagogy, 
   for many reasons , disliking your president is not one of them . 
  i would n't say that . 
  i 'm not targeting the president : if you had read my comment you 'd know that i 'm targetting the spanish political caste , absolutely corrupt and uneducated, 
  i love the interpret 's face when he starts speaking spanish !, 
  yet he 's waaaaaaay better than many of the spanish politicans . 
  i can safely say that i know more languages and know * more * about those that my president and that 's sad, 
  because when i 'm discussing something with a spaniard i get downvoted . 
  when i 'm discussing something with a non-spaniard i do n't . 
  it 's just personal experience . 
  also , who apart from a spaniard would get ofended by that ? 
  let 's be honest : people outside here do n't care that much about our independentist movement, 
  well ... let 's just say referendums are n't part of their happy dreams, 
  spaniards ( generally ) tend to downvote everything they disagree or feel ofended with , i do n't really care much . 
  where did i say that ? 
  i 'm from barcelona ... 
  aaaaand that is one of the many reasons of our independence urge, 
  [ so uuuh ... yeah . . english is important ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdzhz5okpxw ), 
   an independent catalonia will be overall poorer than spain ( businessmen do not like it and many stated they would leave , we mostly export to the rest of spain , we will probably be even vetoed from entering eu , all besides economic costs ) [ i would n't say that , you know ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2012/nov/22/catalonia-independence-business-economy-spain ) ( from the article `` they cite , first , the stats : catalonia represents 8 % of spain 's territory , 16 % of its population , 20 % of its gdp , 25 % of its tax revenues , and 35 % of its exports ( and 45 % of high-tech exports ) . 
  in return , it receives ( in theory ; the real figure may be much less ) 11 % of government investment . '', 
   spain is not working against you politically from madrid . 
  catalonia has more power over their choice of policies than many states within the us , spain is the most federal of the nations and nothing is really targeted against catalonia , we dont pay more than we should , we dont get our freedoms attacked from the spanish government ( only ones telling me what i should and shouldnt speak are catalan ) again , read that , and now this : `` over the past 10 years , the businessmen claim , catalonia has paid nearly twice as much into spanish coffers as the eu . '', 
  also , remember the infamous '' [ nuestro inter\u00e9s es espa\u00f1olizar a los alumnos catalanes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfk-1s1wsx8#t=102 ) '' ? 
  ( our intention is to spanish-ise the catalan students - could n't find a subbed version , but he 's an idiot apart from our education minister so whatever he says people would live better without hearing it - ) you can watch the rest of the video for more examples of catalan discrimination , such as destroying our educational law ( no biggie ) . 
  the most federal state ? 
  do n't make me laugh  the war of spanish succession ( of your 1714 ) was n't a war of secession but precisely succession , and if im not mistaken castilla la mancha and madrid fought on our side . 
  have you ever been to even middle school ? 
  the conflict was between castille and aragon to decide the common succession . 
  castille wanted felipe v and aragon carles vi . 
  once we lost , our language was prohibited , our national rights abolished and our political institutions destroyed , thus forming what we now know as spain ... you might be mixing it with the civil war of the xx century , which does n't have anything in common with that . 
  however , let 's recap the last 8 years or so : have n't we tried to negociate an estatut for more autonomy ? 
  that failed ( kicking off by the way the first wave of demonstrations : it was so abhorrently unfair that this process would n't have happened if it was n't for this ) . 
  have n't we tried to negotiate a fiscal pact ? 
  that also failed . 
  have n't we tried to negotiate all aspects of the referendum ? 
  surprise : it failed . 
  * have n't * we tried to bring our self-made referendum ( since madrid did n't want to colaborate ) to the spanish chamber , something which was redundant knowing that they would reject ? 
  of course , it failed to pass and it has been recently impugnated for being `` unconstitutional '' , something which has to be decided by a group of twelve judges many of whom are/have been afiliated to the actual conservative ruling party and therefore are just an extension of that party ( the guys who mutilated the aforementioned `` estatut '' , which had been aproved by referendum , on our parliment and in the spanish parliment ) . 
  yes dialoge is sadly impossible , but it is n't our fault , it 's * yours * . 
  stop it with the victimism, 
  this is not about nationalism but for creating a better country than spain will ever be , and that is what spaniards have time and time again failed to realise . 
  we 've had enough of madrid 's politics working against us in literally all aspects ( economy , industry , education , etc. ), 
  since our defeat and annexation in the xviiith century . 
  you had many chances and missed them all , remember why cuba left ? 
  it wo n't be extreme because of two things : they have won the elections on a campaign that basically has `` independence '' as its point ( basically a referendum ) and two , we have tried everything and * literally nothing * has come from madrid to negotiate a joint referendum . 
  while it is n't as serious as it could have been , it is n't our fault , we tried our best . 
  that is why it will be as open as possible and we will pull it off . 
  that does n't mean that it will be as succesful as we want it to be , so we 'll have to wait until elections ( which will have all of the independentist parties either togheter as one or sharing the same agenda : the unilateral declaration of independence , thus making the elections the final referendum ) to finally see our country independent , people can look at this consultation as just one of the later steps , though not the last ( and as i said , this is fully due to madrid 's inability to propose a negotiated referendum despite our reiterated attempts ), 
  well basically he created his `` own '' movement , which can be described this quote which he said once : * nothing is art if it does not come from nature . 
  * he asociated nature to god ( he became really spiritual in his later years , going from atheist in his youth to religious in his lasts years , when he sold every single property and dedicated all his money and time to the construction of the temple : when he was fatally injured being run over by a tram he was mistaken for a common worker due to his poor clothing and he was only recognised in his deathbed ) he considered nature much more developed and rich than any man-made artistic expresion : that 's why in his works there is a lot of color , curved lines and not a single sharp corner, 
  thanks !, 
  upvoting everything now , let 's try and revert it back !, 
  art is subjective , its totally ok to have different views on it !, 
  by the way , this next summer i 'll be coming to scotland maybe ( have n't decided 100 % if i 'll go there ) and check your building out ( i 've already been to westminster ) pd . 
  not totally sure about why i 'm getting downvoted to be honest, 
  and you need to look mainly at the interior , not the exterior , since gaud\u00ed was obsessed with how light interacted and played with tinted windows ( colours ) and the rows of columns , giving shadows and lights at different times of the day . 
  in my opinion he was the greatest person born in my country, 
  you might have come expecting something which * is n't * . 
  la sagrada familia has been called time and time again `` the last great cathedral '' , but its architect , antoni gaud\u00ed was n't interested in making a huge construction : he was interested in how the light played between the different columns and windows and how colours changed your perspective . 
  [ example1 ] ( http://img01.lavanguardia.com/2012/12/11/interior-sagrada-familia_54357207047_54028874188_960_639.jpg ) [ example2 ] ( http://www.world-insider.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/innen-architektur-sagrada-familia.jpg ) . 
  gaud\u00ed has been so diferent from all the other architects that it takes a * really * open mind and having been aproaching his architecture for a while to truly apreciate his majesty , even if some of it can be seen at a first look . 
  edit : wrong link , sorry, 
  [ undoubtedly la sagrada familia , from antoni gaud\u00ed ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/sagrada_familia_barcelona_2.jpg ) . 
  it might not be the most obscure building , but it has earned its fame ... 
  even if other buildings from the same architect come close in my list [ palau g\u00fcell ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qsk-ur4pgso/trhagg1zwoi/aaaaaaaaj5o/mymbs0varmu/s1600/barcelona_modernism_palau_guell_cupula_salon_central.jpg ) for example is a curious and not that known one , where he went for a more `` dec\u00f3 '' aproach and was more serene , or [ the cript of the g\u00fcell colony ] ( http://multimedia.catalunya.com/mds/multimedia/8606/f1 ) where he went back to nature and the old monasteries and romanic churches to give a more `` vital '' look ... 
  in my honest opinion , antoni gaud\u00ed has been the greatest man to be born in my country from another country , probably [ the pantheon in rome , both for its architectural prowess and rich history ] ( http://alexandrerosa.free.fr/gal/voyages/italy/rome/pantheon/pantheon_rome41.jpg ) . 
  it 's arguably the best building rome ever built, 
  for example in spain there was some hate towards chinese , at least where i live , because of the economical crisis ( do n't even consider coming here , we 're at 25 % unemployment !, 
  :( ) , they yelled at them accusing them of `` taking their jobs '' and whatnot ... 
  the most serious issue , at least for you , is that spaniards do n't distinguish between chinese and korean ( they are all `` chinos '' ) or moroccan and egyptian ( `` moros '' ) and despise them both . 
  thankfully nowadays i have n't seen much of that and besides it , if you look at least medium class or do n't go into really ghetto neighbourhoods you 'll be 100 % fine, 
  poor fellas got a cold, 
  just a nitpick , but i do remember reading somewhere that the isle of menorca had one of the highest life expectancy ratings of the world, 
  they say it 's about sunlight hours but i honestly do n't know enough to have a firm opinion about it, 
  i saw somewhere a map with the natural sunlight timezones and ours is closer to the brittish one . 
  that doesnt mean it 's good , but nevertheless people do n't inform themselves . 
  well did you know that most people wake up in spain at 7-8am and go to sleep at 12-1am ... 
  doing all their social life at around 8pm ? 
  prime time is around 11pm so you can quickly see why people are getting angry about not getting sun ... in the land of sunlight . 
  apart from changing our timezone there 's also a strong push for changing the habits of people , though this will be harder to do, 
  the fact that we 're protesting because we 're on an `` unnatural timezone '' and triying to go back to our old one when actually it would be even worse ... 
  ... yup , even more stupider , thing is , we want to get out of the timezone , but not necessarly back to our old one, 
  well now that i think about it ... you 're right ... 
  this does n't make any sense at all , honestly, 
  and we 're still abiding by that unnatural time . 
  i look out of the window now at 7:30 pm and it 's dark night here . 
  we 've been trying to change it but it 's really hard . 
  do n't do it !, 
  we 're trying to get out of it here !, 
  we 're only on this timezone because of franco and it 's dark by 7pm , and we 're more to the west than you !,
