  oh , but we would n't accept this offer now : it is clear , we wo n't accept anything that does n't involve us voting, 
  well , it 's probably part of their terror strategy , but the party that did n't veto catalonia would n't be elected in spain for decades ... 
  [ ... for an indefinite time ] ( http://politica.e-noticies.es/espana-vetaria-el-ingreso-de-catalunya-en-la-ue-68089.html ) -  spanish, 
  spain has vowed to veto us out if we try to get in again , so it 's not that easy, 
  no , back yourself up with sources or do n't say anything at all, 
  white areas are basically forests , only trees do have a job , sadly, 
  weeee could ... that 's a really good idea all things considered ... 
  afraid so : / that 's the problem our country has recently found : you only have rights when your enemies are us/eu enemies . 
  if not , you can do whathever that they wo n't listen to you, 
  the effect is the same , they are triying to mislead and disinform rather than accept the fact that we do posses the right to vote, 
  [ change canada for eu and you 've got it ] ( http://i.eatliver.com/2012/9956.jpg ), 
  i am of subscribed into glori\u00f6us polandball indeed, 
  while the spanish government calls this `` an internal affair '' , it should be noted that they are also sending subjective reports to ~ ~ other countries embassies ~ ~ spain 's embassies around the world , in order to teach the people working there some context about why we * ca n't * vote , making it ( ironically enough ) the most `` exterior '' interal affair ever . 
  the fact that they are trying to justify the denial of our right to vote is just an abomination . 
  edit : cleared up my facts , but the message that spain is giving is still the same, 
  but still as good as ever !,

  not because it 's coastal does n't mean you wo n't eat !, 
  if you had a problem eating here i dunno , have you been ripped off and being feed only sea-paella ? 
  ( we have loats of types and most of them do n't have fish ) given that ususally thursday is the tipical day of fish , so restaurants might offer more than they usually do , but even then it 's so easy to eat something that is n't fish : i hate it , and i never had a problem living here !, 
  so sad !, 
  our capital is literally the best , i 'm sure i do n't need to convince anybody :d !, 
  you 're welcome , so many wars happened in those ages that many ( such as this : we conquered freaking athens ! ),

  i 'm talking about [ this ] ( http://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/venjan%c3%a7a_catalana ) , but since it is actually the first aricle on wikipedia to * not * be in english , i 'll do it myself ( you can read [ this , a translated copy by google ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ca&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fca.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fvenjan%25c3%25a7a_catalana&amp;act=url ) , but it is pretty crappy ) :  dates 1305-1307 territori imperi bizant\u00ed resultat vict\u00f2ra catalana i establiment de les rep\u00fabliques militars del ducat d'atenes i el ducat de neop\u00e0tria years 1305 , 1307 : the war was on bizantine empire 's land and it resulted on the foundation of the militar republics ( since we were like that , founding republics before it was cool ) of [ athens duchy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duchy_of_athens ) and the [ neop\u00e0tria duchy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duchy_of_neopatria ) ( literally , neo-motherland ) , basically conquering them for the aragonese crown . 
  the war was a pillaging and exterminating venjance for the treason of the empire and murder of roger de flor , the general of the companyia catalana d'orient ( a bunch of [ badasses ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/almogavars ) that roamed around doing mercenary stuff , but always loyal to the country ), 
  we pretty much razed it and took a few counties for our enjoyment ... 
  should n't have assassinated our general , you silly bizantine !, 
  gooood, 
  i do n't get why the scotland question is asked here and not the catalan .

  well here we like it for [ the random crap ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t36cc9enuvc ) , its just a `` who fucks it up more '' contest , but i guess someone does watch it for the singing ( could n't guess why , though ), 
  totally agree, 
  you do n't get how much money they take from us right ? 
  it has been calculated by * their * own fiscal reports : 3000 $ per person a year , and in total that goes around 16.000 milion $ ( from 2011 , the last year spain realeased their reports , and it is obvious as why ) . 
  we have always been wanting if not independence , at least national rights , and that 's a fact : we now want to be independent since our other options ( we have tried many since 1975 , franco 's death ) have been denied by madrid , and their centralist politics opress us to the point of ceasing to exist ( they are aleady saying that their move after we ** vote ** would be to cancel our autonomy , the little we already have ... how is one supposed to deal with these if not by independence ? ), 
  i 'm sorry but that 's a really unpopular opinion among us : more than 56 % ( in recent polls ) wan na break with madrid 's opression and with abstensions that would rise with more than 70 % ... we are the most international `` internal affair '' in the world by this point ...

  no , it 's a waste of money, 
  * downvote * in any case . 
  i never downvote when i disagree , but i do when i 'm blattanly accused of something like that, 
  please do read my previos comments . 
  i 'm pretty sure * that * they * were * some around there . 
  i 'm tired of this imaginary internet discussion that proves nothing and i 'd like to go . 
  thanks for the discussion , 
  it 's ok , you do n't seem to catch the idea . 
  us , the catalans , you , the valencians and the balearics share the same culture , language and ascendence * period * please do check your facts , and i do love paella and fideua , being from my culture ... we also celebrate tracas and moros i crisitans is basically a celebration to commemorate this cultural unity . 
  you could say , for example , that andalusia and castille have a different culture ... 
  they might , but nevertheless they are united in a single cultural form , that being the spanish one ( showed in the map , by the way ) ... 
  i 'm not going to reject your points because i have no desire to stirr up my facts , i see no * point * ( pardon my pun ) in it , but yeah , i do n't wan na repeat myself, 
  and yet we share the same language , most of the festivities , fought in the same wars , ascendence * and * the same law code ... how weird right ? 
  we have the same culture , it 's accepted everywhere you go , and that 's what i mean of you being a negationist pd : do n't go grammar nazi on me , buddy , you 're not english and neither am i , ethinical was a typo , obviously, 
  pa\u00efsos catalans is the common shared culture of catalonia , les illes balears and val\u00e8ncia , since the first conquered and gave it 's culture to the later two . 
  it 's not imperialism , it is an historical fact , recorded by texts from the time . 
  ethinical means just that , the same culture and ancestral origins, 
  at an ethinical sense : yes , that 's why pa\u00efsos catalans is called `` catalans '' , i was now referring to catalans in a polithical sense , because you shifted to talk about polithics, 
  by negationism i mean what those folks on pp said `` valenci\u00e0 comes from iber '' and nonsensical things like that , that valencia has never got anything to do with catalonia at all . 
  we * never * said that valencians are catalans , you just form part of a cultural union a la commonwealthesque with catalonia and balears from being valencian . 
  going as far to say that assuming that i 'm some sort of `` imperialist '' does n't make any sense . 
  no one here is imperialist and we have never been ( more of pp 's hate speech ) . catalonia has always been the biggest ( objectibly so , by the way ) of the three lands , but never the only one . 
  tl ; dr : we founded and created valencia , but we also gave it freedom , so that you could assume the same status as we had ( summarizing a lot here ) , if we wanted you to be catalan , we would have just conquered you and annexed valencia to catalonia when the moorish kingoms were around, 
  with negationist movements like the one i assume you form part of ? 
  i have nothing against valencians and neither does anyone i know around here and , honestly , most of us think that this supposed `` anti-catalanism '' was created basically by pp , since in the medieval ages val\u00e8ncia even challenged the catalan hegemony in the crown in termns like literature ( the best catalan books ever written was made by a valencian , after all ), 
  yup, 
  because rome does n't affect us directly in terms of culture and political annexion , but it does in an indirect sense , hence the `` romance '' languages, 
  [ so we have this thing called `` pa\u00efsos catalans '' ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pa%c3%afsos_catalans ), 
  please just read wikipedia :  the aragonese empire originated in 1137 , when the kingdom of aragon and the county of barcelona ( with the county of provence , girona , cerdanya , osona and other territories ) merged by dynastic union [ 6 ] [ 7 ] upon the marriage of raymond berengar iv of barcelona and petronilla of aragon ; their individual titles combined in the person of their son alfonso ii of aragon , who ascended to the throne in 1162 . 
  this union respected the existing institutions and parliaments of both territories . 
  although the county of barcelona had more wealth ( given its position on the mediterranean and strong family ties in occitania ) , the combined state was initially known as regno , dominio et corona aragonum et catalonie , and later as corona regum aragoniae , corona aragonum or simply aragon ( why we call it aragon , you could only claim to be a kingdom if you conquered an old imperial roman capital - tarraco or saragussa - and since aragon already had one , there was not need at the time to conquer tarraco )  the palau reial major ( catalan pronunciation : [ p\u0259\u02c8\u026baw r\u0259\u02c8ja\u026b m\u0259\u02c8\u0292o ] , `` grand royal palace '' ) is a complex of historic buildings in barcelona , catalonia , spain . 
  it was a residence of the counts of barcelona and , later , of the kings of aragon aragon 's royal palace , situated in [ barcelona ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/pla%c3%a7a_del_rei_2074102277.jpg/800px-pla%c3%a7a_del_rei_2074102277.jpg ) , and while not the capital ( the kingdom really never had one ) all historians agree that barcelona was it 's economical and political center until late 16th century . 
  the dominant dinasty until the pact of caspe was the catalan dynasty of the barcelonese comptes and then , since the decandence of the crown happened , its pretty irrelevant any other dinasty that succeded ( trastamara , by the way ) since they were puppeted by castille , so that 's why there 's an agreement on the fact that catalans had the upper hand on political affairn in the relevant ages of the crown , obsiously backing my text with * from the time * recordings ( les cr\u00f2niques ) i 'm not forcing you anything ... 
  i do n't even know ... do you even know what ethinicty means or in what regard affects people ? 
  it 's their culture and ancestral origins and since the vast majority of valencians come from catalan settlers , you 're catalan in ethnicity . 
  and its not forced , it 's simply an historical fact . 
  we are not talking about political dominance , tough the kingom of aragon was basically catalonia ( capital in barcelona , catalan kings , catalan being the official language and the name `` arag\u00f3 '' just being forced upon us by vatican law - do please read it 's foundational origins prior making statements like that - ) we are talking about ethnicity , and , valencia was vigorously repopulated by settlers from lleida and it 's surrouding lands , being therefore from catalan ethnicity . 
  do tell me how , please, 
  remove charges , literal transation ... derp , though it meant the same in english, 
  there 's now a trending toppic there where we are all wondering how and when they 'll desimpute her ...

  that 's what behind the eu and why they do n't defend us against spain when they do n't let us * vote * ... 
  i mean , vote , we ca n't * vote * ... 
  it 's just ridicolous, 
  reason it, 
  i perfectly undersand my position and i even dare to say that both of your statements are actually wrong , especially the second . 
  there is n't any law or code that stipulates that if a member state is divided one of the two has to go ( remember , catalonia is actually a member state via spain ) so that will depend on what happens the day after the referendum . 
  second thing , i do n't know what you are talking about , ** all ** ( especially in the eu - baltics - ) the recent independent states had another state backing them up , why would n't the eu help us out ? 
  it 's a net gain for them , an exepcionally net contributor in southern europe that is willing to be part of the eu without any compensation ? 
  that is a dream for them , and i think that would it not be because spain 's dimplomacy interfering , they would already helped us out . 
  welp , obviously get out of it . 
  there are plenty of countries even inside the eu that do n't want to be part of it and we even have some parties in our parliment that argue that it would n't be that bad . 
  eurosceptism , my friend, 
  in that sense you are right,
