  that 's why i gave more than just economic reasons ... 
  78 % ( i think it was ) voted yes and it was accepted as a valid referendum, 
  ^ one of the main reasons we want to be independent, 
  this is important , we need backup from some eu country or the eu itself , we feel like our opinions are ignored by the fact that spain is negating us the right to vote and nobody does anything . 
  the pro-eu are currently a majority here in catalonia ( and correlate with the independentist movement ) do n't make us change our mind please . 
  edit : some insight about why i 'm getting downvoted ? 
  it 's the opinion of most catalans around here, 
  remember how we were ingnored by rajoy two years ago ? 
  yep , that was when thing could have changed , now it 's pretty much impossible for us to exept anything else than an offer by madrid to vote in a referendum ( and even if they do n't offer us , we 'll do it anyway so it does n't even matter ), 
  we repeatedly said that we 'd love to continue to be a eu country , being a net contribuitor ( like the comment below says ) and a bunch of other things : tourism ( using euros makes everything easier ) , exportations ( we sell more to europe than to spain itself ) , development ( we even have our own sincrotron ) , etc. . . 
  that 's what we 've beeing saying : one of our representatives in madrid say that whatever rajoy said we would organise our referendum one way or the other, 
  i 'm sorry but no , we do n't care much about scotland and neither does spain ... our biggest factor that moved us to organise and form a stable social majority ( and a political one aswell ) was when the constituonal tribunal denied the `` estatut '' ( a sort of intern consitution ) and heavily modified it , even while being aproved by a vast majority of the catalans on a referendum and seconded by our parliment . 
  edit : added a `` n '', 
  u wot m8 ? 
  we did a fucking human-chain of ( at least ) 1.5 milion people ( and by the organitzation 2 milion ) , a majority of our parliment is independentist , we are organizing the biggest demonstrations in an occidental country and yet you spaniards say that it is `` unclear '' ... really now, 
  or you can go to [ girona ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/13/girona_riverside_hdr.jpg/797px-girona_riverside_hdr.jpg ) and also visit the dal\u00ed official museum located in figueres , a nearby [ town ] ( https://maps.google.es/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=dal%c3%ad+theatre+and+museum,+figueras&amp;aq=0&amp;oq=museu+dal%c3%ad+&amp;sll=41.692248,1.745867&amp;sspn=2.39543,5.410767&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;ie=utf8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=&amp;ll=42.26804,2.959689&amp;spn=0.002318,0.005284&amp;t=m&amp;z=18&amp;iwloc=a&amp;cid=5277954631501914608 ) . 
  also , there are plenty of things to do around that area , such as visit the [ romanic complex of bo\u00ed 's valley ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_romanesque_churches_of_the_vall_de_bo%c3%ad ) wich has been declared as a world heritage site by unesco, 
  here in catalonia it goes as follows : ( not usual in man to man but every other combination of gender it is ) as one kisses the other in one cheek , the other does so in the opposite cheek of the kisser , then both change cheeks . 
  you 'll se this everywhere , but men only kiss eachother when in family ( if not , the most common is a handshake ), 
  we have a name for each mushroooom !, 
  ( yep , we 're absolutely crazy and sometimes that scares me ... then i proceed to hit my caga tio and that makes me feel better ), 
  ** tots els par\u00c0metres s\u00d3n ... ** oh ... yeah , right , we 're not independent yet ... 
  wait a sec , please, 
  many militar commanders from the spanish army already expressed their will to invade catalonia but funnily enough , a recent report stated that they lack the manpower to do so . 
  i think that we 'll hear a lot of this , since the tension over the two governments is rising constantly and , sadly , spain is not `` democtratic '' so to speak in not even wanting to negotiate * any * waiy for the catalans to even express their will . 
  well it 's * really * easy to see what will happen . 
  you just need patience , wait until the 9th of november and then we 'll talk , and really , i only downvoted you once , when i felt like you were n't reading my comments , not for disagreeing , of course . 
  europe , by fundational right , ca n't oppose the will of the catalans expressing their desire to leave spain , that 's why , even while being pushed by the unionists , have n't still declared an official statement on that isssue ( while many ex-sovietic republics have already promissed international recognition if we turn ourselves independent ), 
  just look at your points ... nuff ` said anyway , if we organise a referendum in wich all catalans can vote at once , even if spain did n't agree to that , it 's easy to see that the world will of course understand our will , the will of the people of catalonia and give us international recognition once we declare ourselves independent . 
  many eu countries have already expressed that . 
  i mean , i got stuff to do and i just assumed by that point that you were n't reading my comments , since half the points you made were already answered . 
  i replied to your text even before reading it , go back to my prior comment, 
  we do n't care about the spanish goverment , we care about ** ours ** it will be official since it will be organised by the last and to our goverment it ** will ** be vinculant and legal , due to being organised under catalan law . 
  you do n't seem to get that, 
  [ 1 ] '' * translation * the referendums about the independence of catalonia are a bunch of nonvinculant-muncipal polls . 
  they were unofficial , as one could say a poll is , they were only used to motivate the citizens and to know their opinion prior to organizing the major rallies ... what the hell are you taliking about ? 
  edit : oh wait , it 's * already * translated !, 
  : the catalan independence referendums were a series of non-binding and unofficial referendums , `` popular votes '' ( consultes populars ) , held in municipalities around catalonia , in which voters indicate whether they support catalan independence from spain . 
  the first such referendum was held in arenys de munt on 13 september 2009, 
  what referendum ? 
  we asked for more soveringty to the spanish government 16 times along our common history and they never let us , in fact , 5 of them mere replied with the army ... we have ** never ** done any independentist referendum, 
  not long ago , one of our representatives to the spanish congress said '' * let them try , we 'll do it anyway , if they cut our existing autonomies or send the army , we 'll have won the second after , the outcry will be enourmous * '' ( not literal , aproximate translation ), 
  they simply * ca n't * and i think they might start to realise this really really fast ... 
  here you go : [ i 'm tight fisted , as any catalan should be ] ( http://imgur.com/vrk8x8w ), 
  and in the last polls , we would win the referendum with a 57 %, 
  heeeeey we the catalan independentists are part of the movie !, 
  ... with zombies ( ? 
  ) , rioters and other firendly people ... representing the `` perfect storm '' !, 
  ... ^ yaaaaay, 
  majority wants it , again , catsiqueespot is n't aligned, 
  catsiqueespot is n't aligned, 
  nope . 
  catsiqueespot is n't aligned with no or yes , so we do have both majorities and we will proceed . 
  sorry to crush your dreams, 
  nope . 
  catsiqueespot is n't aligned , so we have both majorities, 
  yep, 
  he 's not going to madrid . 
  i did n't vote them anyway though, 
  that 's why i said `` but hey '' . 
  right-wing people will vote whomever , but ciudadanos has done a terrible campaign ( basically presenting their leader and not their actual candidate to the elections , which is dishonest ) , plus they are beggining to also have their first corruption cases , which affect ex-high members of the party . 
  plus there 's also the fact that they bascially pact with pp whenever they can , so it 's not like it makes that much of a difference . 
  haggis is good mate !, 
  well obviously , but this does lead to optimism, 
  no , it does n't work like that . 
  abstentions go to the winner , 1,5 % did n't position themselves, 
  we 'll welcome you with open arms !, 
  yep !, 
  they are getting destroyed like never before !, 
  sadly it seems like ciudadanos is taking their place , but hey, 
  abstention goes to the winning party here . 
  plus the `` no '' votes ammount to 48 % , so we win . 
  fucking yes, 
  nope !, 
  the `` others '' category accounts for 1,5 % so we do win !, 
  [ junts pel s\u00ed + cup ] ( http://imgur.com/4mxohbr ) are the two independentist parties . 
  majority is at 68 . 
  we have around 72-77 seats, 
  ** official survey , just released ** : we are at 49,8 % of votes for yes , and a huge majority of the seats . 
  we need a live feed , honestly . 
  ** edit ** : there 's also majority of votes , since the `` others '' category of the survey is around the 1,5 % , so it gives independentists an edge over unionists, 
  i went in summer : /, 
  only train in europe that lagged behind was in switzerland . 
  and it lagged hard , like half-an-hour late or something like that . 
  so yeah :p, 
  ` are you high ? ', 
  more or less, 
  you just assumed all of this , it 's self-dermination of nations . 
  catalonia is a nation , not just `` quite arguably '' , we 're over that argument . 
   t\u00fa te drogas [ riiight ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rbrksyggx8 ), 
  it 's all speculation since there 's no precedent . 
  as simple as that . 
   i think you know you 're talking shit but you 're fine with being dishonest in here just to make your movement seen more appealing . 
  nope . 
  pretty close actually , we 'll see what happens, 
  emmmm nope ? 
  we are not imposing catalan , spanish is still taught and catalan students have a better understading of spanish than many other regions , so yeah , i 'm not the one using bland demagogy, 
   i 'm seriously starting to think you 're stupid  and i mean no disrespect yeah , have a good night you too . 
  also , were 's that `` kicking out mechanism '' ? 
  i still have n't seen it , have you ?
