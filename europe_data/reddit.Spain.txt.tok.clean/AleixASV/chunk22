  what you say here is a general case . 
  we 're talking about a * specific treaty * . 
  the interests of the eu and catalonia need to be taken into consideration, 
  anything that you might read which is n't an official eu statement will be pure speculation too, 
  [ catalan boundary is wrong ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/mapa_dels_pa%c3%afsos_catalans.svg/713px-mapa_dels_pa%c3%afsos_catalans.svg.png ), 
  it 's pure speculation , since as i said , there 's no mechanism , law or precedent for this particular case, 
  nope . 
  cup wo n't declare if there are n't enough votes . 
  the seats thing is just jxs\u00ed . 
  but then again , these are elections , not a referendum . 
  if spain complains that we are counting seats they should 've allowed us to organize a proper referendum . 
   yes it 's a unilateral declaration . 
  negotiations with the idiots in madrid failed , remember ? 
  yes , but backed by a democratic mandate , not a war . 
  [ oh , it is n't international law ? 
  excuse me then , i must be illiterate ] ( https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/self_determination_international_law ), 
  it 's all up on the air , so it 's hard to predict . 
  again though , algeria is not comparable . 
  it 's not even on europe or has european culture to begin with , and it has never been an eu member, 
  have a nice day you too . 
  they do [ want out of the eu ] ( http://www.catalunyapress.cat/cat/notices/2015/09/banos-aposta-per-sortir-de-la-ue-per-entrar-en-l-europa-dels-pobles-130306.php ), 
  do n't manipulate terms . 
  it 's called `` the right to self-determination of nations '' , stated first on the [ 14 points of wilson list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fourteen_points ) , with the idea of giving independence to the nations of the austro-hungarian empire , ** not colonies ** . 
  [ i mean , it 's pretty basic history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/algerian_war\\ ) ) . 
  it was a war . 
  and no , `` independence is independence '' does n't work like that . 
  that 's why we are voting and not declaring unilaterlly whenever we want . 
  we need legitimacy . 
  nope . 
  we can sign an addendum that make us transit from a region to state inside the eu . 
  as i said , there 's no precedent for a secession inside the eu , so all possibilites are open , and i 'd bet that those that are favourable toward the eu ( basically us not being out ) are the ones that will be favoured, 
  it 's all speculation though . 
  i do agree with you that what you say is the most probably outcome , but it does n't mean that the eu will think of an addendum to not make us exit . 
  after all , it 's one of those famous `` win-win '' situations . 
  nope , the eu treaty was signed by spain on behalf of catalonia , so we 're eu members . 
  if we become independent , we 'll probably sign in an addendum stating that we are now members on full rights . 
  have fun , you and your demagogy . 
  i 'm so glad to never have to hear back from you idiots again ... 
  yes there is , and tomorrow it will decide if it wants to be a state or not . 
  i will , do n't worry . 
  catalonia is also an eu member , under spain though . 
  we are just changing the later, 
  nope , i did n't say we * were n't * going out , i said it 's disputed . 
  it can go either way . 
   la cup have stated that it might be a possibility . 
  cup wants out of eu , what you 're talking about ? 
   heck , you 're the same kind of people obsessed with flags , nationalities , and other 19th century trivia . 
  nice fucking elections , choose between spanish retarded nationalism , or 3 % catalanism . 
  yeah i 'm done , this is too much demagogy for me . 
  good night, 
  keep comparing wars to elections , this surely leads somewhere, 
   in case your ignorance is so big , elpais is not precisely a right wing nationalist newspaper like the brainwashing crap you call media over there . 
  surely they invented what the ec declared if there is no link , is n't it ? 
  i still do n't see your link . 
  was n't el pais one of those newspapers who faked `` mas bank accounts in switzerland '' story * just before last elections ? * . 
  or the ones who sent agents to take pictures of cdc hq beacause the police leaked that they would be sending people there ? 
  yeah , right . 
  also ... brainwashing crap ? 
  oh , so we 're all brainwashed idiots now ? 
  yeah , you 're great buddy . 
  ** i still have n't seen that comunicate btw **  but i 'm not your enemy . 
  if there was a national referendum i would vote for the independence of catalonia too because i think that spain without catalonia will be a much better spain without internal hyper nationalist flag kissing enemies ( and finally we 'll be allowed to make that big lake in aragon with the ebro water and end the water problems of the levant ! ), 
  so good luck , and close the door when you exit . 
  you do n't even get it . 
  we 're * not * just nationalistic , this is about creating a better country , not `` muh catalonia '' . 
  it 's your fault for not informing yourself though , after all you just read el pais :p, 
  it 's not comparable in any way shape or form . 
  plus argelians even got french nationality if they wanted , so that would 've made them eu citizens . 
   ) between signing independence and signing the paperwork to get back in the eu ( because in the end , catalonia belongs there ) , that is stepping out of the eu . 
  also , you just assumed this . 
  there 's no need to step out , just an actualitzation of the treaties . 
  this is not true . 
  * in my own school , class was done in spanish * . 
  teachers taught in whichever language they wanted , ignoring the catalan law . 
  and do you know why that law is in place ? 
  beacause of franco , * who forbade the use and teaching of catalan * . 
  we are trying to return catalan to the normal levels that it had before his rule and no :  your children will have to have 90 % of their lectures in a language they do n't understand . 
  this is a fucking lie from the deepest halls of madrid 's propaganda . 
  when we were forced to give an option to teach some lectures in spanish , around 5-6 families used it . 
  in * all of the country * . 
  spanish levels in catalonia ** are literally better than in other parts of spain ** , this is a non-issue waived by pp-and-friends who never understood the problem . 
  and of course , it 's just another reason of * why we want independence . 
  you , and those idiots will never tell us what to do with our language and culture . 
  * we 've had enough dictators . 
  also , a peaceful democratic vote = / = war . 
  also , a peaceful democratic vote = / = war . 
  yes . 
  but we are now members of the eu . 
  why would n't we continue to be in the future ? 
  after all , we 're leaving spain , not the eu . 
  this is not what the vote is about, 
  when did i send any article from them ? 
  i do n't even read them, 
  nope . 
  we are `` kicked out '' whithout a mechanism for doing so in place . 
  that 's the general assumption here . 
  which is bollocks , beacause we would be a net contribuitor , secure geostrategical location and irrepleplacable trade partner . 
  i did read it . 
  and you forget that catalonia is inside the eu . 
  if we 're * out of it * then we 're kicked out since we do n't want to leave it .
