  again , where 's the mechanism for that ? 
  what it did n't make possible is to respect the right of self-determination , a recognised human right . 
  so yeah . 
  oh , and it allows tomorrow 's election on the basis that they do n't acknowledge it as a plebsicite , so i do n't know why you 're getting excited bolding it . 
   not to mention that respect to catalan culture and language is in spain 's constitution . 
  yeah , that 's why they 're always harassing us and our educative system, 
   pravda-like circlejerking regional tv channels oh yeah , and you link me ** el pais ** . 
  what a country . 
  just so you 're aware , this `` official communicate '' is n't linked * anywhere on the article * . 
  i 'd like to see that , and not another piece of madrid 's propaganda machine, 
  they also became independent via voting , though * they were allowed a referendum in the early xxth century * . 
  that says a lot about spain 's democratic levels, 
  this is not the problem , the thing is , there 's * no * mechanism for kicking out a secceding nation inside the eu ( nor a preceding case )  it 's literally mentioned there , treaty of lisboa , article 49 . 
  nope , this is not what would be used to kick us out . 
  there no mechanism ... 
  i dare you to find one for a secceding nation inside the eu . 
  this is what the article says about 49 :  under article 49 of the treaty on european union , any european state which respects the principles set out in article 6 ( 1 ) of the treaty on european union may apply to become a member of the union . 
  an application of this type requires , if the application is accepted by the council acting unanimously , a negotiation on an agreement between the applicant state and the member states on the conditions of admission and the adjustments to the treaties which such admission entails . 
  this agreement is subject to ratification by all member states and the applicant state . 
  49 , if you wanted to read your own sources ** is the admission article ** . 
  it 's obvious . 
  they were also signed on catalonia 's behalf , * under spain * . 
  or do you forget that we , at the moment , are inside spain ? 
  if european law experts have not swayed on one way or the other to give a clear answer * and the comission has n't said anything since 2004 * then it 's not confirmed . 
  i still do n't see the decree that would kick us out * it 's literally not mentioned there . 
  we 're not ` voluntarily leaving the union ' . 
  there 's the possibility ( not confirmed by any decree or official statement ) that we would be * kicked out * if we seccede, 
  this will be an interesting day , regardless of the result, 
  i did too ... 
  at least here they pretty much were :p !, 
  though thanks for recognising our importance and annexing us ... 
  i mean , that proved the value of our * clay * right ? 
  maybe this time your army wo n't get scared by a guy with his [ drum ] ( http://www.barcelonas.com/images/el-timbaler-del-bruc.jpg ) ? 
  i mean , it was quite [ hilarious ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/drummer_of_el_bruc ), 
  well i mean , taking our northern chunk ( and homeland ) is not nice ... so yeah , if you could gib north catalonia back yeaahh, 
  yup , this is a thing that many people outside here do n't understand : we want to create a better state , not beacause `` muh catalonia '' but beacause we want to give our people a better future . 
  certainly , there can be a nationalist element to it , but we are n't a bunch of crazy * nazionalistas * like the press from madrid likes to tell us . 
  this is pure bullshit . 
  just to give you an example , if you go outside of the center of barcelona , schools stop giving classes in catalan and only teach in spanish ( against the law , but nobody cares ) . 
  the world is n't so black and white as you like to think, 
  read what happened with the catalan estatut . 
  this is what he 's talking about, 
  galician and portuguese are diferent languages whereas valcencian is a dialect of catalan . 
  every single reputable linguist on the world agrees on this . 
  catalan has 11,5 m speakers . 
  portuguese in [ europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_portuguese ) is around 10,8 m ( hard to get a figure but it 's more or less that ) so yeah , they 're close , but we have more speakers, 
   has a spanish which is for a portuguese it 's galician , not spanish and it 's actually where portuguese comes from . 
  you should know these things . 
   catalonia , has a spanish which is for a portuguese ( and for a spanish , depending on his origin ) hard to understand , because it is very similar to french . 
  c'mon , you do n't know crap about the penninsula !, 
  we speak catalan , a language * that literally has more speakers than portuguese on the continent * and you still think that we speak spanish ? 
  i can safely say my andorran is pretty great , 
  spain ( and portugal ) . 
  valencia has reached a deal to equip a big ship to get refugees straight out of lesbos , a 1000 people at a time . 
  the penninsula is not affected at all , so all major cities have delcared themselves `` refugee friendly cities '' ( barcelona was the first big one i think ) and here in catalonia we are trying to bypass spain 's adherence to eu policy and try to get some refugees for us . 
  literally everyone here is refugee friendly , to a bigger or lesser degree . 
  yeah whatever , apples to oranges . 
  [ this is more like it to what would happen ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2014/04/08/actualidad/1396986575_704072.html ) . 
  a long drawn-out process is impossible to sustain with such a small minority and we 've been trying it for at least 6 years , we 're not wainting anymore . 
   it 's your own political opinion . 
  obviously like you , but i also post sources, 
  well i mean , if you do n't want to assume the poltical reality of spain go ahed . 
  [ when there is n't even a majority on * if we should be able to organize the referendum * ] ( http://www.diariocritico.com/noticia/438252/nacional/los-espanoles-mayoritariamente-en-contra-del-derecho-a-decidir-de-los-catalanes-sobre-la-independencia.html ) do you expect that we will somehow get it ? 
  yeah whatever , you can eat all the propaganda you like . 
  but you also know podemos will not organize a referendum . 
  it 's political suicide, 
  nope . 
  podemos is * for all referendums * , which in reality makes them against all . 
  when there is n't political will to reach a compromise it 's all just a smoke screen and you know it . 
  besides , now that you 're pointing out the community over here , they also know that argumental fallacies like the one you just pulled off are a pretty cheap trick, 
  you do n't understand . 
  they know it is impossible , also dialogue with spain is simply non-existant and we 've proved this over this last 15 years ( with the estatut too ) . 
  what are they basing their dialogue on ? 
  plus not a single one of them commits to celebrate a referendum on independence ( podemos wants `` a referendum on everything '' , just to dissolute the promise , the cynicism ... ), 
  oh , so you 're now telling me that there 's no need to reform the constitution despite everyone saying so ? 
  alright , then this is a moot point . 
  to celebrate a referendum of independence that procedure would be needed beacause it affects core stuff of the text , as the procedure and constitutional lawyers say, 
  you expect a statal referendum and * two * elections to be won succesfully just to grant us a referendum ? 
  * in spain * ? 
  you 're trolling right ? 
  [ ** it is ** ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/reforma_de_la_constituci%c3%b3n_espa%c3%b1ola#procedimiento_agravado ), 
  that 's obvious but there ca n't be a referendum without a change of the constitution . 
  and that text is basically impossible to change, 
  but not from our front . 
  we 've been trying to get a referendum for at least 6 years, 
  your knowledge of architecture seems to be pretty much limited to santiago catalatrava . 
  yes , we all know he 's an idiot, 
  same utility , but 0 beauty unless your name is gustave eiffel or sir john fowler and sir benjamin baker . 
  you might aswell just pour concrete in the sea until it sticks and form a bridge, 
  nope , the fact that you did n't notice before does n't mean that we did n't organize independentist demonstrations . 
  they have existed for decades, 
  no he is n't , there 's no clear leader now but certainly he is n't . 
  we have had to * force * him to come to terms with the fact that no , * we do n't want a fiscal pact , we want to vote for independence * and he himself has become independentist ( which he was n't before ) during this whole ordeal . 
  the movement is socially driven , politicians lag behind , and if you want to find a leader it probably was carme forcadell until really recently, 
  and your point is ? 
  he has never been the leader of independentism , you know that right ? 
  no you do n't get it . 
  the independentist demonstration organized by independentists is obviously not only about celebrating culture and history but also about independence . 
  it has been like this for as long as i can remember . 
  it 's an act organized by society and society gets to say what 's it about , not you .
