  we want to build a better state for everyone , to start from scratch . 
  beacause we want to have international coverage , people need to know what 's happening here !, 
  depends on the area . 
  where i live , i only know like 3 people that speak it frequently, 
  27th actually :p !, 
  and since spain did n't let us make a referendum , it 's an election that basically makes certain parties turn into a `` yes '' ballot for independence, 
  [ this page , except the last reason , explains it pretty well ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/11179914/why-does-catalonia-want-independence-from-spain.html ) . 
  a country is only an instrument to get what we want , not the end itself . 
  i too , would like to know . 
  i do n't think they really understand why we would break free , and many oppose to give us a referendum , telling us to `` wait until the crisis is over/x politician has been elected '' . 
  not here !, 
  the left * has been leading the process and is nationalistic *, 
  i fucking live there , this is a lie . 
  i can go on a straight week without hearing any catalan at all, 
  nope , too much money involved to kick bar\u00e7a . 
  we would probably create a catalan-spanish league, 
  how lucky that * they are n't the ones deciding then :p *, 
  their economical situation is much better , since they more or less have always had a `` fiscal pact '' with the rest of the state . 
  they have too a lot of independentists too there , but they have n't reached `` critical mass '' like here :p , though i think we are having a bit of an effect , they are starting to demand a referendum for them aswell !, 
   both you guys should be independent , if the majority want it . 
  thank you again :d !, 
  thank you :d !, 
  that 's beacause here in catalonia we feel that we need more international coverage , scots had it easier since they already speak it and so it was easier for them to get covered !, 
  * we want the world to know who we are !, 
  thank you :d !, 
  it 's a pointer !, 
  [ it runs through the entire demonstration accompanied by our little pointers ] ( http://estaticos.elperiodico.com/resources/jpg/0/2/punter-via-lliure-recorrent-meridiana-barcelona-1441986908720.jpg ) to end at a huge urn made of ballots of the - declared illegal by madrid - consultation of the 9th of november , 2014, 
  thank you :d !, 
  yep , we want independence !, 
  we 'd like to stay in the eu , but it is n't a deciding factor, 
  am i too stereotypical ? 
  i just got back , it was incredible , thank you :p !, 
  i 'm there !, 
  it 's absolutely breathtaking , they 've just announced that we 're over 2m people !, 
  i 'll try to upload some photos if i can !, 
  :d edit : i [ could !, 
  i 'm there !, 
  i 'll be uploading [ some photos ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ljxzy ) !, 
  actually it 's now 48,8 % , not including the effect of this demonstration , which will probably put us over the majority . 
  polls are not to be trusted though, 
  we 're 2m people !, 
  i was around there somewhere just a few minutes ago . 
  i 'll upload some photos in [ an edit  ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ljxzy ), 
  while the aragonese claimant to the throne held madrid , he gave out money to the people to appease them : they said something along the lines of `` while there 's money , long live the king ! '' . 
  it was a clash of the two crowns : the castilian war in favour of an absolutist bourbonic king and the aragonese of a supporter of the * furs * and fueros from the hasburg line . 
  until 1713 it * was * a succession war . 
  with the treaty of utrech and the betrayal of both austrians and english , we were left alone fighting the armies of both castille and france : having no claimant to the throne ( ours became emperor of austria ) it became * a seccession war * , a la netherlands . 
  that is why this war here is know as the war of succession-secession and why we remember the heroes of 1714 who died not for a foreign king , but to preserve our rights . 
  as they said : `` freedom or death '' . 
  oh and by the way , visigothic spain has 0 in common with the posterior modern state in 1715 . 
  in international law until 1714 it was a double kingdom ruled by a single guy , like it was common at the time : there was poland-lithuania ( commonwealth ) , denmark-sweeden ( kalmar ) and shortly after england-scotland . 
  that did n't make them unified countries plus you forget that , at the time , navarra was independent and there were still muslim remnants so no , it was n't an unified country by any account : each had their own laws and lands , armies , etc. 
  spain , as the slogan says * is different * . 
  [ some more up-to-date news by the way ] ( https://translate.google.cat/translate?hl=ca&amp;sl=ca&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fbarcelonacatalonia.cat%2fb%2f%3fp%3d9937 ), 
  i mean , when the borbons came we * literally lost our rights as catalans * and our language was largely forbidden , we basically * truly * were second class citizens , by right of conquest of the aragonese kingdom by the way , that 's why many historians locate the beggining of modern spain ( as in , a centralized state ) then : [ more in-depth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nueva_planta_decrees ), 
   well , that is your opinion . 
  mine is the lack of negotiation is a smart strategy by catalan nationalist movement . 
  like fuck it is . 
  it is n't an opinion , tell me , how many alternatives has rajoy given us ? 
  how many times have we brought this issue to the parliment to be brutally faced with a `` no '' ? 
   well , the conspiracy theory about madrid and spanish secret service are building political corruption delicts is , at least , na\u00efve . 
  and yes , i quoted cdc , which is the most important ally in the list . 
  cdc = / = the list . 
  that 's called manipulation but hey . 
  it 's not a conspiration when it has been proved time and time againt that every time such as scandal arises when elections come it turns out the information leaked was false all along . 
  see : previous elections and the then `` ciu scandal '' ( fabricated of course ) . 
   just read what i 've just said . 
  pretty na\u00efve , i 'm afraid . 
  what i said is true . 
  you did n't rebut it . 
  what you just said is * your * interpretation of eu law . 
  i did n't give mine , the key difference here is that : there is no precedent , law or official statement on this issue by the eu so on all accounts they are neutral . 
  you can give whatever interpretation you want , but that wo n't make it true and you forget that the eu does n't want a net contribuiting 7,5 m people rich state kicked out . 
  a deal will be negotiated . 
   you talk about blackmailing spain and eu about `` policing that border '' . 
  i answer you : then why should spain and eu let catalonia be independent if that 's the nationalist way of politics ? 
  no , you said that before me . 
  that 's my rebuttal . 
  see how little sense it makes ? 
  then why you expect the spanish government to do that but not us ? 
  that 's how little you trust your executive branch ? 
   as i always say to nationalists : why could n't you be co-operative with the rest of spain in order to build a country like germany or sweden ? 
  why do you have to force us to choose between ` statu quo ' and kosovo ? 
  this comes too late . 
  16000m $ are drained every year out of catalonia and this is * just one of the reasons * . 
  we 've been trying to cooexist for too long, 
  this could be true in 2012 , when mas ( our president ) wanted the fiscal pact . 
  this is n't true today , when we are left with 6 years of 0 dialogue and no other option apart from breaking away . 
   has a lot of problems with political corruption . 
  this is not true , some are fabrications from madrid ( the press knows at what time they should be recording on cdc 's hq , how curious ) and only affect cdc , which is n't the only party in the list . 
   of course , liberals and enterprises inside of this movement do not want an independent catalonia they do , the majority of the comerce chambers in catalonia are independentist and investment is booming since the possibility of secession was announced . 
   they only need the spanish state to give them a regional judicial power so they can control the judges . 
  and thus , some corrupt people from the main catalonian party ( cdc ) be set free . 
  that 's at least my interpretation of the problem . 
  ... the independence movement is socially driven , not politically . 
  this argument is 100 % false , we * forced * mas to organize the plebiscite , * he was n't even an independentist * ( see : fiscal pact negotiations of 2012 ) . 
  anc ( a social organization with 0 political ties ) organized most of the demonstrations * and were attended by the population * , which were the biggest in the history of europe . 
   and also , eu treaties have been referred as not recognise a new european state as part of the eu , so a hypothetical independent catalonia would eventually out of eurozone , eu , central european bank , customs union ... false again , there 's no procedure or recorded case of seccession inside the eu so there 's no protocol . 
  plus there 's no official statement of the organization about what would happen , this is pure speculation . 
   and also , catalonia exports and imports almost everything to/from other spanish regions , so it would be an economic suicide to have border duty ... false another time , we export and import now more to other parts of the world than to spain .
