  thank you !, 
  good thing that we really do n't care about what that government thinks , they have had time ( 6 years ) to negotiate and never did , it 's entirely their fault, 
  we are in the xxi century and it shows that you * have n't in fact , opened a history book * . 
  beacause norway * is independent today thanks to an independence vote organised in the xxth century *, 
  yes , it 's obviously a critical situation and these things * might * happen . 
  we 'll try to make a smooth transition ( and if we ca n't it wo n't be our fault ) , that 's why we 're not declaring just right after the elections, 
  the spanish army ca n't invade catalonia , they know that , it 's too small . 
  and besides , they would never dare do that , * europe will never allow a war against a democratically declared independent country in the continent * , and you 're pretty delusional if you think that `` one of comunidades autonomas violates the constitution '' , beacause if we 're independent it 's pretty clear that we wo n't give a shit about your constitution . 
  i mean , we 're already violating it right now with these elections for fucks sake !, 
   wasnt it already established that catalonia needs support from spain and not the other way around . 
  nope . 
  spain drains around 15.000 m $ $ from catalonia every year , * not the other way around * . 
  that 's one of our main points for independence . 
  your other points do n't make sense , honestly , you 're just assuming things without any real basis about what would happen . 
  and if they dare sanction us , on what basis ? 
  beacause * we voted * to be independent and won ? 
  if you think that they 'll do that , you 're pretty delusional , democracy is still alive , even if do n't belive in it, 
  it 's called `` right of * self * - determination you know ? '', 
  and it 's a recognised international right . 
  if you want examples , you can search : half of eastern europe , baltics , norway , iceland, 
  you 're assuming things and you clearly have no clue about what 's happening here, 
  yep , when democracy is faced with bullets people roar for freedom , at least in europe, 
  [ `` els segadors '' , or the reapers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6au7hvr6yx0 ) , the national hymn of catalonia . 
  not only does it have a badass title , it also has badass lyrics : [ image from wikipedia beacause it looks better ] ( http://imgur.com/8qd6v8n ) [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/els_segadors ), 
  we can go a few weeks without recognition , but i really doubt this will be the case . 
  when they understand that there 's no going back they 'll guarantee us recognition defore the declaration ( which of course , will be done in due time ) . 
  we are not idiots , this has already been accounted for . 
  and by the way , spain would be on the brink of default ( if not done for already ) without us , i really doubt that they would be worth * that * much, 
  hahaahahahaahah like the ones in ukraine right ? 
  russians are funny people . 
  you clearly do n't understand how democracy works, 
   you do not become a country simply by declaring independence . 
  no , you do it by having a majority that votes to do so . 
  this is how democracy works , plain and simple . 
  if you do n't like it then it 's not our problem, 
  there is no going back . 
  not recognising us , even engaging in military action against us is foolish and would only make the situation worse . 
  especially for a then economically crippled ( even defaulting , since they need us ) spain, 
   european agenda , which would be to not accept the claim , especially considering the turmoil europe is undergoing atm . 
  you just assumed that . 
  when europe realises that we 're not going back and that they would lose a net countribuiting country in a geostrategic location * then * we 'll talk, 
  to do what , exactly ? 
  burrow the bullet ? 
  we are a peaceful movement and will be a peaceful country , i do n't know about you but we 'll be fine, 
  send the police against a foreign country ? 
  this is almost a declaration of war , and a pretty absurd move in my opinion, 
  law which we wo n't be abiding by . 
  law draws it 's power from the people , not the other way around . 
  it 's called `` democracy '', 
   but would it be just as hard to organize a referendum without spanish recognition ? 
  like the 2014 vote , but with the government announcing it will be considered binding ? 
  that 's what these elections are . 
  they are just a referendum with another name , and the votes toward independentist parties count towards the `` yes '' vote . 
   spain would actually intervene by force to prevent such a referendum ? 
  they already send the police and tried to prosecute half of our government in the first attemp , apart from threatening everyone that participated , so yes , they would use force, 
  well yeah , but you where occupied . 
  i mean , it 's not a discussion , it 's a fact, 
  i dunno , but america says `` yeah '' , not `` da '', 
  spain will be pretty crippled economically after our declaration , and if they do n't recognise us they 'll just make matters worse . 
  are they so stupid i wonder ? 
  on foot , * collons * , my new shoes `` infraestructures d'estat '' are new and need to walk !, 
  if they dare shot a single bullet every country in the eu will recognise us . 
  agresive tactics are not an option, 
  investment has grown this year on catalonia and a huge part of the businessmen here are in favour of catalonia . 
  you 're basing your `` facts '' out of ... what ? 
  mr. lara 's ( now defunct by the way ) crazy statements ? 
  lithuania , denmark , uruguay and some others have already pledged recognition, 
  so you 'd be kicking out of the eu a net contributing country that has it 's independence granted by a democratic vote . 
  good job . 
  and what exactly do you expect to gain by pleasing a now defaulting country ( spain , must i remind you , they depend on us to keep their country rolling ) ? 
  nope . 
  and even then , the spanish army ca n't invade catalonia , it 's too small, 
  thank you !, 
  and i hope soon enough * maybe * we 'll have seats togheter on the un :p !, 
  thank you !, 
  and thank you for promising recognition too :d !, 
  lithuania will have a true friend in the mediterranean sea !, 
  it 's not our fault you did n't let us organize a proper referendum . 
  this is the only option but yeah , i think they 'll count votes , not seats . 
  plus denmark would also recognise us !, 
  it 's a matter of time , once we are independent and the other countries see that it 's irreversible they 'll recognise us ( moreover , we 'll be independent on a democratic basis , so there 's no argument on the eu to deny us recognition ), 
   but rather after a referendum that the government ( the catalan one ) considers official , unlike last year 's consultation . 
  under spain , it 's 99 % impossible to organize a referendum , belive me , we 've been trying for 6 years now . 
  this is the only option, 
  or * yeah ! * . 
  i mean , as the song goes , `` freedom is the only option '' ^ ^ ^ ya ' ^ ^ ^ [ know ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r5a0pg4on8 ), 
  now , if you could lend a bit of recognition toward here it would be * very appreciated * :3, 
   just some posturing to gain more attention and put pressure on madrid . 
  like hell it is . 
  we 've been waiting at least 6 years with the independence thing now to just back away . 
  it 's too late , and we know that we would be so much better ( plus it 's been confirmed by prestigious international and neutral analysts , so yeah ), 
   since when i meet some heavy pro indepencia people from catalonia , they made me be against independance . 
  are you catalan ? 
  if so , you should n't base your opinion on how somebody is or acts , you should research . 
  if you are n't catalan this is more like an indirect `` issue '' to you , but still , please do n't base your opinion on a such important topic as this based on how somebody acts, 
  yep . 
  * all aboard the queterunya train !, 
  beacause * we wo n't declare unilaterally yet * . 
  we need to consolidate the country before the declaration . 
  people here do n't bother to do a bit of research,
