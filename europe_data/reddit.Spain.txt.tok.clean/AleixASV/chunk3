  maybe in ireland but for example ( and excuse my ingnorance please ) i do n't even know who that guy is, 
  dark times . 
  we must forget . 
  top notch m8 !, 
  but it is relevant !, 
  what he 's saying is that we all thought we were spain , a full-on first world country when in reality we were only espa\u00f1istan , a corrupt semi-democracy along the lines of poorer states !, 
  i firmly belive that humor can be made from everything and this is one of the pilars of the freedom of speech, 
  my god , i hated them to no end ... though i was on the sciences batx , that could excuse it i guess, 
  well played ... [ have and old cat ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ lady ] ( http://oi39.tinypic.com/wvd0mx.jpg ), 
  yes , that 's the word !, 
  * `` nice '' * ... 
  just turned it around , it 's funny to change what they meant to make it actually clever, 
  spain is the face !, 
  and portugal is ... well ... * the moustache * . 
  of course , southern europe is a woman in her forties, 
  southern corrupt countries uniteeeeee !, 
  the catalan interpretation of the german pronunciation . 
  * or as it is commonly known in the halls of barcelona 's gohete institut : clusterfuck *, 
  yeah , but that silly little `` r '' is pronounced as a soft `` g '' in catalan because we do n't have the `` french r '', 
  is n't it ? 
  that 's why it 's funny !, 
  especially because * he 's * the one calling his country that , not a foreigner !, 
  in catalonia we call it `` euro '' i `` c\u00e8ntim '' ( eur\u00fa ? 
  i suck at phonetics ) though a while back i learnt that euro in german is pronounced `` oig\u00f3 '' ... 
  i was stuck laughing with that for a week ... 
  seriously ... oig\u00f3, 
  yeah , spanish police is really weird . 
  we have three main `` bodies '' of police : the local guard ( guardia municipal ) , the `` regional '' which i belive is unique to certain autonomous communities ( here in catalonia for example is `` els mossos d'esquadra '' , literally meaning `` squad lads '' which by the way is one of the oldest police forces in europe ) and the state-wide , which is the police, 
  this is not police though , it 's urban guard ... ( municipal guard ), 
  or , with more subs , / r/yurop, 
  sorry but i 'd advise you not to . 
  this is not his channel but someone else 's who uploaded his video with subtitles ( the best i could find ) his actual channel is [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/aleixsalo ) ( he has a bunch more videos , and if you search on youtube the title + subtitles you 'll find them with subs ), 
  yup , this guy is great . 
  he became famous for [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psgp2hh1jq4 ) video , which explains the crisis in spain ( click the subtitles button , it actually works ! ), 
   https://www.foropolicia.es/foros/fotos-de-policias-del-mundo-t30111-1770.html `` policias del mundo '' : policemen of the world [ also , do you know how plates in eu work ? 
  that f means that 's from france ] ( http://imgur.com/warjiel ), 
  that 's italian i think ... or looking at the plate , french, 
  spain ? 
  as far as i know they only drive on seat ( which hey , is made here but still ... ), 
  [ wikipedia link of the anthem , with lyrics ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/els_segadors ), 
  actually i was wrong , both the french and the germans did apologise . 
  who did n't and has stated several times that is n't going to is spain , though, 
  yeah ... 
  but psoe also maneuvered their wait out of the issue ... let 's not forget that this is more about a `` spanish mentality '' ( they call it pride ... blegh ) than a party ideology . 
  well , he was in bretagne trying to get in contact with his son ( who was mentally ill ) and knew of the dangers of his stay there . 
  this does n't make excusable the fact that spain has n't yet apologised for his death , trial or execution while france and germany ( two countries which you are justificating - and i can see why - ) have . 
  in fact , spanish authorities are n't ignoring the issue , they outright denied the apology, 
  then you are saying that france did n't exist ? 
  neither germany , because they were nazis right ? 
  if they rightfully apologised for their crimes , so should the french, 
  the only officially elected president in all europe 's history to be murdered with the consent of other european countries . 
  rip, 
  awwww i hope it is n't a page made here !, 
  it would be ... weird, 
  yup , it has . 
  either he has been eating too much of madrid 's crap or it was intentional, 
  probably . 
  yet as you see , the term is often misused, 
  [ as in , amount of money invested ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=ca&amp;sl=ca&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.elperiodico.cat%2fca%2fnoticias%2feconomia%2finversio-estrangera-segueix-lalca-catalunya-3275387&amp;sandbox=1 ), 
   personal story : my mother is from the ` elite ' , yes , but my father is belgian , and i consider myself more an international guy . 
  this is irrelevant and pedant . 
   i maintain what i maintain after investigating history during years and after studying very much what people have to say about the foreseeable future of catalonia . 
  you do not seem to be studying but difamating and spreading demagogy . 
  if this was unintentional and i were you , i 'd delete this post once i had realised it . 
  it has lost any value that it might pretended to have , due to pretty much everyone seeing the manipulation behind it . 
  he does n't mean crap , he has no idea of what he 's talking about . 
   also , the ` threat ' of companies moving out of catalonia also this is false ... as is his entire post , but taking this as an example : this year , the amount of inversions in catalonia not only it has n't decreased or remained stale but even increased . 
  i 'm pretty sure that * he 's * the one brainwashed, 
  i do n't quite know ... we are n't taught that part of history ... mainly because at around the same time our country was destroyed and conquered, 
  and so they are here ... 
  this post is all a big lie, 
  yes they did , at least the majority , so his claims of `` an ancient oligarchy '' that only wants more power for themselves ( and therefore catalonia ) are even more ridicolous . 
  but that can also be used to include belgium , so people do n't use it ( also it 's longer ), 
  also he forgot about algeciras , which already has the requiered infraestructure, 
  well ... ironically the netherlands in spanish is holanda ( aswell as in catalan ), 
  but not * de facto * . 
  also , are we going to argue about months ? 
  really ? 
  yeah , it 's all `` brainwashing '' , `` independentist manipulation '' and `` a fabrication from the elite '' ... what a joke, 
  yup . 
  that 's why spain started in 1714 and not with the iberian wedding , because we existed as aragon until they conquered us, 
   i did not talk about the demolishing because it 's not an important part of history , and city demolitions were common throughout history oh yes , that must be why we do n't commemorate it every year in the 11th of september right ? ... 
  * oh wait *  independentist manipulation , as with other things , have made this event much more significant than in reality was . 
  alright , prove it for once . 
  you have claimed this as your basis for your little easay , and i wo n't eat it . 
  so destroying half a city and planting there a gigantic citadel to control its population was something normal back in the day eh ? 
  * then tell me when it has happened again * ... the civil war for example ? 
  it was just bombings . 
  yes , they were * en masse * and yes they had to rebuild . 
  but that was in 1936 , not in 1714 . 
  and objective accounts estimate that 2 mortar rounds were shot in the siege per inhabitant . 
   i talked about the prohibitions of catalan language . 
  well i did n't see it . 
  not with franco nor felipe v  the fiscal deficit is something that should not be outrageous and is practiced in every country in the world . 
  nope , false . 
  not to the extent of catalonia at least . 
  [ you can check this official document made by the goverment that demonstrates it ] ( http://economia.gencat.cat/web/.content/70_economia_catalana/arxius/pt_201201.pdf ) or are you going to claim that it 's independentist propaganda at work again ? 
   and please do n't shout like you were about to explode ... stuff like that inhibits civil discussion . 
  the only thing that is exploding here is your credibility . 
  which has already happened by the way,
