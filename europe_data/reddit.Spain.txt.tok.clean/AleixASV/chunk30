  oh really ? 
   paralyzed by fear and indecision , the portuguese authorities offered no resistance . 
  junot occupied lisbon on 30 november 1807 to find that john and many of the leading families had left for brazil aboard the portuguese fleet . 
  the french quickly occupied the entire country and appropriated or disbanded the portuguese army . 
  [ even wikipedia has an article about that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/invasion_of_portugal_ ( 1807 \\ ) ), 
  yes you were , invasion of 1807, 
  spain and portugal * were * occupied by napoleon though, 
  -7,75 and -7,54 , so we 're pretty similar ... filthy anarchists , being utopian and all of that !, 
  100 % agree . 
  just look at the gay marriage thing , we 've been one of the first countries in the world to pass it . 
  whoever says we 're `` hardcore catholics '' has never been here, 
  and spain is one of the countries with more immigrants having arrived in the last years . 
  despite that , pretty much all of it 's major cities declared themselves `` refugee cities '' welcoming refugees . 
  religion is not an issue here, 
  ... what in the fuck are you on about . 
  so you think that this is news worthy ? 
  my god , i 've just remembered why i usually never comment on these threads, 
  32 % upvoted , we 're already almost there, 
  cheap sensationalism is forbidden as far as i know . 
  this is not news , this is plain racist propaganda : no context to what 's happening , just a short video to sway people away from common sense, 
  i do n't like sensationalisim , you 're the one assuming, 
  have you maybe read the rules of this subreddit ? 
  * thankfully we 're * ** not ** * north korea . 
  * this propaganda is pretty similar to the one they make there, 
  it 's pretty retarded . 
  * this * `` content '' should not be allowed here, 
  i mean , that 's pretty much half of catalonia painted red , but i also did never hear about that disease ... 
  picking mushrooms is one of catalonia 's national sports , we even needed to put `` mushroom picker cards '' to limit the amount of people going into the forests !, 
  and pretty much every mushroom species has a `` normal '' name in catalan . 
  we 're very serious about this, 
  that does n't mean that the press refers to him as such , formal english is n't press english . 
  and obviously the press is n't the `` european commission directorate-general '', 
  did you even read what you linked ? 
  he 's called `` president '' and it says so in your link, 
  there 's no pm in spain , he 's called president, 
  nah he will stay . 
  he 's a nice strawman sitting there to take hits for the elites, 
  quit it with your condescendence and demagogy . 
  and i 'm catalan , * born in barcelona * , not brittish . 
  anyway , since you seem to be pretty dense plus i think anyone who reads this will understand what i mean , it 's pretty pointless to keep talking to you . 
  ... that is obvious and i felt like i did n't even need to state it . 
  if you 've never been here , how do you even talk about our situation with crime ? 
  * i fucking live here * mate and i can tell you , 99 % of the time people who get pickpocketed it 's due to them failing for obvious scams or not being aware of their belongings . 
  i 've * never * in my whole life been pickpocketed or robbed here , not even in the most crowded of the places . 
  yes , of course * crime is the criminal 's fault * , but what matters is * what you can do to not get pickpocketed * . 
   getting robbed while they 're * tricked into obvious scams that a 10 year old would notice * ftfy . 
  there 's a reason pickpocketing is n't as high as you might belive in barcelona , and i told you the reason before : common sense . 
  do n't get demagogic on me , if you see a sketchy street * do n't fucking go into it * . 
  it 's called common sense . 
  99 % of the times it 's guiris being not thinking about what they 're doing, 
   so everyone who has gotten pickpocketed had one or zero neurons ? 
  yep, 
  yup , it 's largely ignored here ( apart from the big events , like the hungarian fence or the truck incident ), 
  blatant ignorance toward refugees ( but also immigrants , which we are n't talking about in this case ) and xenophobia are pathetic . 
  quit spewing shit , try and be a * bit emphatic * . 
  you know , * like a normal human being with feelings should be . 
  oh shit they are onto our plans !, 
  honestly it 's really dissapointing . 
  i usually avoid these kinds of threads , but i just saw a guy wishing that the refugees should just drown and another wanted to literally build gulags . 
  people are crazy ... and their lack of empathy is kinda scary honestly, 
  and i wonder , do you call yourself a human being ? 
  i did n't even know how shit this subrredit has become , i usually avoid these obvious immigration hate threads but this ... this is just fucking abhorrent, 
  de res !, 
  you 're welcome !, 
  they are n't really embassies , they 're trade hubs suporting catalan exportations ( on the rise nowadays ) that also promote catalan culture . 
  of course , if we become independent they will become full-on embassies , but that is impossible today under spanish law . 
  unlike the spanish embassies , they run at a profit accounting the deals made thanks to them . 
  by the way , their total cost is less than the cleaning service cost of the spanish embassies , just to put things into persective . 
  yup !, 
  i think he 's a new guy beacause the ruling party federation split ( it was formed of two semindependent parties , one seccessionist and one who was n't , with the upcoming elections they could n't resist the pressure ) and so they had to change some ministers, 
  with plebiscitary elections that will decide our independence coming up soon ( 27th of september ) and him being on the independentist side he offered catalan nationality to all of those people who share catalan culture in the areas where that is true ( the so called [ `` pa\u00efsos catalans '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pa%c3%afsos_catalans ) or catalan countries ) . 
  he did that assuming that we would become independent * and he said that on `` la universitat catalana d'estiu '' . 
  * this is very important : it 's a place where top-level catalanist politicians and activists discuss the upcoming issues for the country , like a big `` think-tank '' . 
  yes , he was an idiot and he should n't have said that . 
  but he was in the right place for stating those opinions , i 'm sure this is n't the first time something like that has been stated there . 
  the disctinction is that he is the * conseller de just\u00edcia * , the equivalent of a catalan minister of justice , and he should n't go around saying things like that . 
  it is n't appopriate for his title , especially beacause the `` catalan imperialism '' meme is often used by the conservative and today 's ruling pp party to rile up spanish nationalists on the aforementioned `` pan-catalan '' regions and it 's a * very * sensitive and conntroversial topic . 
  [ pa\u00efsos catalans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pa%c3%afsos_catalans ) ( more or less , greater catalonia : areas which were colonized by catalan people during the * reconquesta * and share catalan culture and language ) , though i do n't even understand why he included arag\u00f3 ( maybe beacause of la franja but good god ) . 
  that guy is an idiot and nothing else , he should be kicked out . 
  nevertheless , this whole issue has been distorted and exagerated immensely and it 's a clear case of spanish media trying to spin us into some kind of imperialistic crazies, 
  yup , this guy is an idiot and nothing else . 
  he does n't represent anyone but himself stating this and he should be kicked out . 
  besides , this is a completely exagerated and sensationalized issue which is obviously targeted toward spanish audiences to make us look like some kind of `` dirty imperialists '' . 
  like it 's the first time i 've seen it happen or something, 
  but not at the same time !, 
  spanish linguists usually group it with spanish in being iberoromance , while internationally it 's known as galloromance ( beacause it originated north of the pyrenees , thogheter with occitan , another galloromance language ) , plus catalan linguists also assert the galloromance claim, 
  i 'm not hungarian and i do n't know what 's happening down there in the balkans , but europeans care * a lot * ( or should at least ) about seeing the will of the people ( in this case , from the people of kosovo ) respected, 
  you 've to be really afraid if you take these kind of puerile decisions, 
  yeah i know , but people would suppose that a western and developed country such as spain would have more common sense, 
  they 're weird people . 
  i find french to be even more similar to catalan than spanish ( and let 's not even talk about occitan , some dialects of it are almost catalan itself ), 
  yes according to spain, 
  yep , beacause all cities , natural or artifficial * have to begin from scrap * . 
  the difference is why they were created : political will creates artifficial cities , people 's needs creates organic ones, 
  rome , london , moscow , washington dc , bern , vienna and a few others come to mind . 
  the diference is that artificial cities boomed from barely anything whereas organic cities have a more or less natural growth, 
  compared to what it would become as constantinople it was nothing, 
  any city that basically came from nothing or an irrelevant town compared to what it would become is the accepted definiton of an artificial city, 
  look , i 've already discussed this enough , you can go read other comments , i do n't want to repeat myself that much , especially if you 're that condescending, 
  not even close to the same degree of importance though , there 's no need to create a city out of thin air to be an artificial one , exactly like madrid,
