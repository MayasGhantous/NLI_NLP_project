  beacause it was created from basically a small fishing town into the capital of the roman empire in a few decades under the political will of the emperour . 
  yeah !, 
  people think that cities have existed forever * and get pissed * for some reason when that rethoric is challenged . 
  huh, 
  i did n't say it was n't populated , what you say is true . 
  however , a big percent of the population was on the coast or barely inland, 
  yeah , i cited a lot more reasons actually . 
  population was mostly only taken into consideration in the form of local nobles and bishops : the less of them ( less population ) the less demands they would make, 
  no problem !, 
  just ask :p !, 
  zaragoza has the ebre river , like c\u00f3rdoba with the guadalquivir , both massive rivers , that allow mass agriculture, 
   now you say c\u00f3rdoba is in the coast ? 
  its not a coast . 
  nope , i said that it 's not that inland . 
   also , you can say no one lives as inland as madrid , because madrid is in the middle . 
  that doesnt make you look less stupid . 
  you do n't understand what we 're talking about . 
  the point of this discussion is that madrid * is the exception *, 
  not true , it was a decently sized city ( what i meant by another town ) but not to the level of european capitals by any means . 
  they had five or even ten times that population . 
  we 're not just talking about creating a city , it 's a capital of the biggest european empire at the time . 
  well , that 's beacause until madrid , castille never had a `` fixed '' capital . 
  unnoficially it was toledo , but the bad geografic location , lack of water , food and housing and increasing criminality finally tipped off the balance toward creating a new and stable capital in the form of the `` new '' city of madrid . 
  valladolid was one of the transitioning places that kinda looked like it could 've been the capital , since even the king philip ii himself was born there and many councils were celebrated there , but it did n't happen [ source ] ( http://www.ateneodetoledo.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/felipe-ii-y-toledo.pdf ), 
  yeah , we especially kicked ass in the xvth century ( dominating the mediterranean , conquering athens , installing popes , etc :p !, 
  ) , but the true industrial boom happened in the xixth !, 
  then we * at least * tried to rival england and more or less succeded  ^ ( they like to call it the americas here so let 's give them that , just do n't tell them we consider it a single continent or their brain will start to hurt ) ^ yep, 
  ... climate hardly seems similar though , they are really different on that front, 
  well , it changed a bit . 
  before madrid was chosen as the capital beacause its central location , river ( manzanares ) and hunting grounds ( perfect for * the biggest palace in europe * ) , the capital moved from toledo to valladolid for a few years , but after the king philip ii took power he changed , as i said , to madrid , which at the time was a normal town, 
  [ so if you look at this map , you 'll see that what i mean by inland and what you mean by inland is n't the same ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6x5wlzyct_m/t6ebb4v9sci/aaaaaaaaack/ntkjix3tt0e/s1600/spain-population-density-2005.png ) . 
  the more inland you go into spain , the less people there is , * except madrid * ( and toledo , the old capital ) . 
  well i mean , * yooooooooooooooooooooooooou kinda had enough resources with latin america , which we were n't allowed there until 1714 * . 
  most of the investing came from local catalan traders , like how it happened in england : succesful businessmen that came back from america started investing in the textile industry to set up business here , looking to make more lucrative ( and reliable ) profits than shipping . 
  at one point in time , the llobregat river ( the one that passes next to barcelona ) had so many dams ( mechanical hydro power ) that it was the most `` worked '' river in the world !, 
  i just said that beacause the previous capital was valladolid soooo ... !, 
  but yeah i mean , and there 's also the thing about the `` armada invencible '' which supposedly cut so many trees that entire swaths of land became arid and barren so i guess we 've a lot of young forests !, 
  plus it 's easier for a coastal region to industrialize ( better comunication for importation/exportation ) , and in fact this was the case with spain , since both catalonia and euskadi were the most commited to `` event '' this in the country . 
  that certainly drew a lot of population from other regions and increased fertility , apart that historically rail inland has been hard to maintain and build so other regions could n't hop on so easiliy on the * industrialitzation train * . 
  and yeah , then there 's the internal immigration thing . 
   you know that toledo was the capital of spain before madrid , and c\u00f3rdoba was the center of islam there before the reconquista ? 
  all of them are inland . 
  no it was n't , the capital was valladolid in the north ( did you read the source ? 
  ) , [ plus cordoba is hardly inland ] ( https://www.google.es/maps/place/c%c3%b3rdoba/@39.0669822,-1.8824879,5.75z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0xd6cdf26f95e0aef:0x4df1d2e8108456c3 ), 
  you did n't factor in the climates though , spain recieves much more rain ( especially in the north ) than turkey does , and it 's less arid , plus it 's way less inhabited in the inland areas, 
  artificial city = / = fake city . 
  madrid was just another town in the castilian crown when it was choosen by philipp ii as the seat of his court beacause of it 's central condition ( previous seat was in valladolid , too in the north ) and hunting grounds , booming in population to become a top tier european city . 
  if this is n't an artificial city then i do n't know what is n't . 
  you know that these types of cities are n't new right ? 
  other examples are baghdad , new delhi or constantinople ( which by the way , apart from the name change , followed exactly the same procedure ), 
  ... what ? 
  you know it 's [ true right ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madrid#modern_age ) i 'll guess i 'll have to edit the source in the original comment ... these people, 
   besides , if it was n't madrid , toledo would have remained the capital city and it would have been today 's madrid . 
  just with a much more interesting river rather than the frigging manzanares . 
  well no , it probably would 've been valladolid , farther from the center of the penninsula . 
  what i meant was that the population suddenly blew up , creating essentially an european city from pretty much nothing , kinda like constantinople , new delhi , baghdad , etc. 
  no , madrid was little more than a mid sized town chosen by philip ii to be the capital in the 16th century beacause of its central position and the proximity to a river ( plus it had nice lands to erect a palace and hunting grounds ) .

  spain is literally the 2n most montanious country in europe only after switzerland , so people live in the coast , not inland , with the exception of the artificially created city of madrid edit : source from [ the madrid thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madrid#modern_age ) , people belive it 's some kind of `` nationalist propaganda ? '', 
  what 's wrong with artificial cities ? 
  they certainly are n't a new thing ( baghdad , constantinople , new delhi , etc. ),

  that 's sad , he 's actually quite good . 
  but i always favour architects over other artists since , you know , i 'm studying archiecture myself :p that 's by the way why it affected me quite a bit to see so many of his buildings closed !, 
  on that we agree . 
  thankfully , i could explore the city and see other buildings ( the walking tour from the guys at the school of art is great ) which pretty much solved my architectural desires for that city :p . but yeah , there 's * tons * of propaganda in that sense about mackintosh , maybe you as a local are n't so exposed to it ?
