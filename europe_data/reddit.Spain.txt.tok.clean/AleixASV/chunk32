  it 's a hidden * cala * that i go on summers ... it 's always empty ! ] ( http://www.finquesfrigola.com/img/cap%20index%201.jpg ) . 
  you ca n't win against * costa brava * , little galician ... 
  i 've caught a fucking cold . 
  can you belive my luck ? 
  i 'm so going tomorrow , headache or not, 
  \u00a1 madrid independiente !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmod5zeftbe ), 
  over where ? 
  i belive you ... but a 20\u00ba day is not a beach day :p you dooo n't reeeeeeally have true summers !, 
  the king just choose from a selection of flags . 
  but that 's kinda sad to say so they want to give it some `` meaning '', 
  ... in galicia ... * not shitty weather * ... yeah, 
  and navarra was added later , etc. 
  ... buuuut that 's catalan , not spanish, 
  barcelona is obviously the best . 
  the fact that i live there does n't alter my view at all, 
  well then you maybe should n't have come here . 
  maybe you would be better in that little madrid of yours . 
  huh, 
  i did n't go to glasgow just to see mackintosh obviously , and i knew that the school of art had burned . 
  you forgot two of his buildings being far away from the center and one being innacessible . 
  compared to how we treat gaud\u00ed 's buildings here , it 's quite sad to see how little you can visit of his works, 
   promoted like what ? 
  i literally saw posts claiming that he was `` the gaud\u00ed of glasgow '' . 
  and no , people do n't have the time to waste 40m in a bus to go see a building * that is a recreation of an idea he had * and chance it in hopes it is n't closed like many of his buildings, 
  i did n't dismiss the house for an art lover , i said it 's too far away to be promoted like that . 
  a tourist ca n't spend so much time that he already does n't have to just go there . 
  scotland street school and queens cross church are arguably both minor buildings , for the publicity that mackintosh gets it 's a shame that they 're basically the only thing you can visit apart from the tearooms ( and i also did n't go to the church , too far away and too little time ) . 
  you can go inside of the * new * building of the lighthouse ( which i liked a lot btw ) , not the one mackingtosh designed . 
  like an insult , basically, 
  it 's not a riot , they were ilegally selling products and tried to hit the police who detained them, 
  the amount of propaganda this guy has is blown completely out of proportion when you actually want to see his works . 
  i do n't just want to see a door of his building , i want to see * all of the building * . 
  and if you 're just promoting : half of the exterior of a building ( the rest is burnt ) , an innacessible house , a building far away from everything and * a door * ... well , that 's disingenuous propaganda at best, 
  i suspect it might just be spaniards being racists but hey !, 
  i 've heard that they did n't want us to speak catalan ( dictatorships et al ) and , since it sounded weird to them they just called us polish despectively, 
  and closed all august ( mackintosh 's house ) and impossible to enter ( lighthouse ) , and in the middle of nowhere ( house for an art lover ) , etc. 
  i had to settle for the willow tearooms and museum exhibitions, 
  i always fancied to see what 's similar about catalan and polish ... :p !, 
   dont worry * if * the pp gets voted out of power we will get rid of this fascist law ftfy, 
  why of course !, 
  [ you missed the completely impossible to understand accent . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le_ungdpa4c ) ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ came ^ ^ ^ back ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ liked ^ ^ ^ glasgow ^ ^ ^ more ^ ^ ^ than ^ ^ ^ edinburgh ^ ^ ^ though ^ ^ ^ mackintosh 's ^ ^ ^ shit ^ ^ ^ was ^ ^ ^ really ^ ^ ^ badly ^ ^ ^ handled, 
  i might or might not go to poland . 
  just for the pierogi-thingy ... 
  there [ are rains down here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neotjagp0na ) . 
  [ when it rains ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5miuxuztgu ) , [ * it rains * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7jhem1c590 ), 
  i loved every second of my stay , it was amazing do n't worry :p, 
  [ the official cambridge page states that `` trinity cream '' was known by this name since late xixth century ] ( http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/about/trinity-burnt-cream ), 
  facts are facts , and that was the first page i found :p besides , wherever you look you 'll see that burnt cream ( the english version ) is at least always three or four centuries newer than ours !, 
   [ they have adopted a theory , long held in cambridge , that the combination of double cream , egg yolk , sugar , vanilla seeds and caramelised sugar originated within the walls of the city 's trinity college in the mid-1600s . 
  ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/food/article-1298534/which-came-cr-br-l-e-burnt-cream-uk-claims-french-classic-own.html ) you ai n't robbing us our cream !, 
  our earliest mention is from 1324 and it * literally one of the oldest desserts recorded in europe * . 
  our claim is as strong as it can be :p !, 
  i live where they make it ... 
  i feel like it 's my responsability to drink tons of it ... ^ but ^ i ^ do n't ^ even ^ think ^ about ^ complaining, 
  not this again !, 
  one copycat was enough !, 
  ( btw , we even conserve copies of various medieval cooking books that talk about it , we 've got our dessert creation covered :p ), 
  yeah , but now there was this international piping contest nonsense and everyone and their mother was playing, 
  for now , 
  merda in catalan !, 
  we like changing things i guess, 
  hahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahaahahahahaahahahha ... * gathers breath * ... hahahahahaahahahahahaahahah nooooope . 
  crema catalana is the best !, 
  you should try it !, 
  i just came from up there and i even liked it better than edinburgh . 
  so you know ... 
  though the pipers playing 24h/7days a week can get pretty annoying :p, 
  i mean ... what !, 
  we did n't copy the flag of puerto rico !, 
  ^ ^ it ^ ^ was ^ ^ cuba 's ... ^ ^ for ^ ^ the ^ ^ whole ^ ^ independence ^ ^ war ^ ^ and ^ ^ that ^ ^ stuff, 
  well ... interesting question that you pose ... so yeah . 
  we 're trying to * not * be a minority on our own country :p, 
  ... and ? 
  carrot soup needs carrots to be carrot soup, 
  that 's like ... your opinion man . 
  and yes , it 's a copy , adapted to french cuisine , this is a proven fact . 
  i 've tased both and catalan cream * is a thousand times better * . 
  it actually tastes of something . 
  starch is just an ingredient , how 's that cheating ? 
  that 's like saying that wheat in spaghettis is cheating, 
  it 's referring to the actual `` cream '' dessert , not creme brulee . 
  alain sailhac is well documented . 
  and besides , we know that he based his dish on catalan cuisine plus that the catalan cream has * at least * medieval origins from our medieval cookbooks which mention it, 
  creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is obviously the copy ... when did i claim that it was ours ? 
  the hell is that ... another copycat :p ? 
   [ alain sailhac created cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e by producing a lighter version of the traditionally richer , and thicker crusted , catalan dessert called crema catalana . 
  the custard that he made for the original dish was egg yolks and heavy cream flavored with vanilla while the thicker crema catalana custard was flavored with cinnamon and lemon . 
  ] ( http://behind-the-french-menu.blogspot.com.es/2012/08/creme-brulee-which-country-most.html ), 
  * points and laughs at * btw , we 've got medieval cooking books that cover this dish . 
  it 's definitely ours, 
  yeah , it has pretty much everything you can wish for including vegan food . 
  though i would suggest looking up restaurants before coming here , it can get quite hard to find one that it 's vegan since we 've got so many places to eat and so many people walking around, 
  do it !, 
  it 's not even funny how good it 's in comparison ... makes me kinda mad that the french were the ones that popularised their version, 
  * outside of catalonia that is . 
  you wo n't find that heretical fake copy here :p there 's tons of food that we do better than other countries that nobody nows about , like [ all our embotits - yeah , we 've got so many it 's a food category - ] ( http://www.casaguspi.com/images/portfolio/products/embotits.jpg ) that do n't taste like plastic ... looking at you , peperoni, 
  for precautionary measures , i eat it as part of a burger so if i did n't like it i could remove it . 
  but i clearly did n't need to !,
