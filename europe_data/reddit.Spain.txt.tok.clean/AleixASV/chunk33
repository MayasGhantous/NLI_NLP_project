  i mean , it kinda looks like it beacause a french chef literally tried to copy the dish adapting it to french cuisine , but it absolutely does n't taste like that at all, 
  and it is :d !, 
  i went to scotland a few days ago ... irn bru ... it 's not my thing . 
  but haggis is delicious actually !, 
  and yeah , i do n't care how it 's done :p, 
  yeah , but barcelona has a * huge * cultural pull . 
  we can switch gradually the kinds of people that we want to attract , after all we 're one of the the biggest touristic centers in the continent so while it might take a while the potential is there . 
  and if not , we can just redirect booze tourists to other regions like costa daurada ( which we 're already doing ), 
  yeah !, 
  it might sound traditional , but an excellent chocolate cake is hard to beat, 
  that does n't make it impossible, 
  it 's the best dessert on the world !, 
  ] ( http://www.recetin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/crema-catalana.jpg ) the frenchies tried to copy it a few centuries ago with the creme brul\u00e9e but they could only come up with the blandest and dullest dish imaginable ... ours actually tastes of something !, 
  as for drinks well ... [ the cremat can be quite spectacular ] ( http://www.blogrecetas.com/files/2013/06/depositphotos_13718060_s.jpg ) , but nothing beats [ cacaolat !, 
  ] ( http://www.grafmanlleu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/cacaolat.jpg ) ^ ^ and ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ made ^ ^ on ^ ^ my ^ ^ city ^ ^ so ^ ^ yeah, 
  no , we can try to attract different kinds of tourists . 
  the last mayor just opened the floodgates and pushed for more people to come to barcelona , no matter that they would be booze tourists . 
  it seems that this trend is dying off , but it will take time, 
  there 's more languages than the state language you know ? 
  i 'm just surprised this was n't the case before . 
  it certainly is here in catalonia with catalan/spanish, 
  i do n't know , it did n't appear in my history classes . 
  neither did that ww1 thing, 
  it was , but they also did n't want to lose votes in the south, 
  * monta tanto :p *, 
  [ oooh i 'm working on it ... but with another country :p ^ ^ which ^ ^ btw ^ ^ makes ^ ^ strange ^ ^ things ^ ^ happen ^ ^ apparently ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ihtrlse.jpg ), 
  [ i just wanted a big , nice name in the middle of the mediterranean sea !, 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/kl4hhql ) ( pretty old save though , i know why it did n't do it :p ), 
  but that 's a bit unfair !, 
  benidorm is ... * benidorm * we also get our share of idiots who go around buying flamenco dresses :p, 
  in general i mean , there were n't any trees around the streets or small parks . 
  it was all concrete and stone, 
  yep :p !, 
  the biggest font size always wins !, 
  no i went both times visiting southern italy : pompey , sicilly , that sort of thing . 
  i ca n't really stand cruisers , but yeah , i 've heard similar things referring to that city, 
  but that 's not the tourist 's fault , the last mayor did an absolute shit job at controlling the hotels , apartments etc. 
  and entire districts were swarmed with more tourists than they could handle . 
  then again , we also like to make fun of the stereotypical * guiri * , the classical tourists that expects barcelona to be a mix of mexico/andalucia and gets sunburned while drinking sangria, 
  i 've been there * twice * . 
  i do n't even know why i went both times, 
  and it was so ... grey . 
  i mean , it has really cool museums and all that , but it 's a really * insipid * city for what it should be, 
  it was hypocrite , but at the same time it banned the worst kinds of bullfighting . 
  remember that the sourthern * comarques * in catalonia are usually a tie breaker either for ciu ( now defunct ) or psc/other , so they need those votes . 
  plus it was the first ilp ( popular backed law ) to be passed on catalonia , it was n't kickstarted from the parlament !, 
   toros are killed in pamplona . 
  after the encierro there is a corrida in the afternoon . 
  true , i forgot about that . 
   i do n't think it was imported from castilian emigration to be honest , mostly because it 's also present in southern france . 
  catalan tradition ( active only in the south ) at least today only conserves the `` correbous '' , so we do have some `` bull '' related celebrations , but they do n't kill the animal , they just make it run around . 
  not that i do n't condemn it though, 
  obviously i was referring to political style , hence my example , you 're forcing a really questionable view never meant, 
   i would rather not be part of spain due to this . 
  in fact if we can talk about our potential future country ( catalonia ) , it 's not that i like it , beacause i do n't : we 're also ridden with corruption et al. 
  ideologically and culturally we 're a bit better ( i ca n't see mas hiding behind plasma tv 's , as much as i do n't like him i 'll give him that ) but i 'm an independentist for that reason : i want to make a better country , and in the next elections ( which will be plebiscitary ) we 'll be able to decide if we can do that or not !, 
  it is a real chance and you do n't get many opportunities like that, 
  yeeaaahh ... but it kinda looks like it 's only spoken in catalonia , which is absolutely not the case, 
  am i the only one that thinks that it does n't make sense for this maps to use state boundaries instead of linguistic ones ? 
  today it 's seen as an spanish symbol ( the toro is the `` animal '' of spain ) and it was one of the main reasons for its ban , apart of course that it 's fucking animal torture . 
  a hundred years ago or so though , bullfighting was more or less common in big cities with castilian immigration such as barcelona ( which had two * plazas * dedicated to it ) . 
  the catalan bullfighting tradition , at least today , is called `` correbous '' , which literally means `` run bulls '' more or less like the corridas in pamplona , where the bull is n't killed . 
  the only reason for their continuity is that there 's an actual social backing behind them ( nobody went to see bullfighting in catalonia ) and parties would lose a ton of votes in those regions . 
  but hey , at least we banned bullfighting, 
  and the basques are eta ... like some politicians might want to make you belive, 
  catalonia can into nordic ? 
  i mean , it 's possible to read many things into what people say ... you may laugh , but i 'm not the crazy * nazionalista * that some people here seem to belive :p, 
  that 's besides the point , obviously what the language of a region depends on the culture and people from that region . 
  remember that a language does n't only carry information but the traditions of the people that speak it . 
  that 's why conserving them is essential for the survival of each nation , culture and history . 
  a nation without a language is a much lesser stronger entity . 
   see ? 
  there you go again . 
  i 'm sorry , but a territory does n't have a language . 
  yes it * usually * does , it can either be de-facto ( english in the us ) or de jure ( spanish in spain ) . 
  you 're nullifiying your own point here :  spanish is one language of spain , the most widely spoken for various historical reasons , and therefore often the most convenient , but it is not the language of spain . 
  since the language of spain precisely derives from those historical , cultural and demografical factors from which you derive that it 's the most convenient, 
  well yeah , the language of catalonia is catalan ( and the language in spain is spanish , obviously ) , but there 's also spanish speakers , aranese speakers , etc. 
  they are also catalan people and i actually live in an area where hearing catalan spoken is preeetty hard nowadays . 
  the implication that you read was n't behind what i said , sorry if you took it that way, 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  you can be a catalan nationalist while not being a secessionist , which by the way , is the consensus on gaud\u00ed 's opinion on the whole kerfunkkle . 
   they did n't see being catalan as incompatible with being ( or speaking ) spanish , on the contrary . 
  and what the fuck ? 
  spanish is a cultural heritage of catalonia too , everyone speaks it . 
  quit assuming things that i never said . 
  he apparently was talking about something that i never denied , trying to prove himself right about something totally unrelated ( that people can translate disctrict names , as ridicolous as it sounds , he thought i 'd deny that ) . 
  those facts and whatever he linked were just smoke , they did n't mean crap * beacause what i told him initially did n't have anything to do with that * , he was just derrailing . 
  and so what , i ca n't be wrong now ? 
  what is this condescence ? 
  go tell somebody that cares, 
  i was generalizing , of course, 
  i do n't even know what you 're talking about ... what does this has to do with the g\u00fcell being monarchists and me not knowing my own nation 's history ? 
  are you implying that being a monarchists somehow makes you more reasonable ? 
   i know . 
  so what ? 
  do you have any actual physical evidence for your claim , apart from nationalist mythology ? 
  nope , apparently i was wrong about that . 
   of course i know gaudi sympathised with catalan nationalism , and the g\u00fcell family even more so , even though they also were staunch monarchists ( yup , the history of catalan nationalism is slightly more complicated than you may have been led to believe ) . 
  ... what are you even talking about ?
