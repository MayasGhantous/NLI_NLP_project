  of course the people from la lliga were monarchists , so what ? 
  you 're the one who sees it all in black or white , either it 's all nationalist propaganda or it 's all complicated . 
  quit it with the fallacies , where the fuck did i even mention the g\u00fcell family ? 
  since ? 
  nobody in barcelona calls it `` ensache '' , but you 're free to do whatever you want , like nobody living in london calls it `` san pablo '' but tourists can call it heiligen paul or san pablo or anything else, 
  you fell for the same shit that the spanish authorities did . 
  park in english and parc in catalan are pronounced exactly the same , and gaud\u00ed even went to jail for refusing to answer an officier in spanish . 
  i know quite a bit about him and his works and he did * not * want his buildings labeled in spanish * when building in catalonia *, 
  then you are just discussing for the point of discussing since i also never denied that people can call it whatever they want . 
  what the hell do i care ? 
  no , i did n't gave you franco . 
  i told you that people living in barcelona call `` eixample '' `` eixample '' since it 's ... its name . 
  like park g\u00fcell , which btw , has it 's name in english just to evade the spanish labeling forced at the time . 
  you can call it parque g\u00fcell but we , like the english will wonder why you 're even bothering us, 
  ... my god you are dense , go tell someone from london that their cathedral is actually called san pablo and see what happens . 
  * yes , it 's a translation , but not the official name or what people call it * . 
  anyway , it 's impossible to talk to you , always with the * catalanes nazionalistas * arguments in hand , so have a nice day . 
  you do n't get it . 
  this is n't about ` autoritarian ' or whatever . 
  st pauls cathedral is n't ` santo pablo ' just beacause you happen to speak spanish . 
  the language of catalonia is catalan , it 's a pretty logical thing to understand , i mean , every country works the same way . 
  now , both you and me know that in the second republic the estatut de nuria was only active for a few years so * do n't falsify history yourself * . 
  how hard is it to grasp that there 's a name for a thing ? 
  it 's pointless to transalte it multiple times , it works just fine in catalan , the official language of the nation, 
  why ? 
  it 's clearly wrong , i 'm sure everbody knows what cities correspond to what nation, 
  yes and ? 
  it was the official name during francoist * and primo de rivera 's times * ( the other spanish dictator ... who also did n't like catalan ) , that can explain many things . 
  apart from that , is it so hard to grasp that we only use the catalan version of the name ? 
  i do n't care how many articles you 've got , that does n't mean crap to the people living here * today *, 
  that does n't make it less true , i 'm not accusing you of anything, 
  nobody calls it `` ensanche '' , not even spanish speaking people . 
  it just exists as a translation , most probably popularized in franco 's times when every street was given an spanish name, 
  eixample is the name of the district . 
  nobody calls it `` ensanche '' , not even spanish speaking people . 
  it was a translation only used in franco 's times when every street was given an spanish name . 
  my god some people from this sub ... 
   the replies & discussions were to be expected but it 's still pretty sad . 
  well i mean , that 's what happens when you ca n't label things !, 
  i 'm pretty sure glasgow , uk or montreal , canada would `` engage '' a similar reply :p i do n't really care about that that much though , i love iss too much to be offended by such petty things and besides , they almost showed my house in that picture !, 
  i 'm even more mad about that !, 
  it 's a whole different letter , so both no :p, 
  he means `` eixample '' , or expansion ( of the city ) , the actual official name of the district :p he just likes to translate it to spanish for some reason, 
  oh , the pla cerd\u00e0 is probably one of the most ambitious and succesful expansions of a city that exist !, 
  combined with a traditional and big old town , we 've got the best of both worlds !, 
  aaah but you guys are n't north but west !, 
  and c'mon , more or less the north of the penninsula is pretty well-off, 
  our poor northern brothers might not show you that word so often , but if you come down here in catalonia you 'll see plenty of `` formatge '' :p,

  [ el pais in english ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/07/28/inenglish/1438092280_596648.html ) there were only 2 wounded people ( one of them by bullet ) , they are in the hospital now . 
  it has been confirmed that it was n't an islamist attack, 
  2 wounded people ( one of them by bullet ) , they are in hospital now . 
  it was n't an islamist attack, 
  kinda true , though his official title is `` king of spain '' . 
  i know , it does n't make sense , but that 's how spanish politics work, 
  quit it , you clearly do n't underestand what you 're talking about, 
  it is our king for now obviously , not that i want or like him , that 's why i make fun of him, 
   the client , who is believed to have paid # 35,000 for the hunt , has not been identified . 
  there were reports on sunday that the person was spanish , but the zimbabwean hunter identified him to the telegraph as `` north american '' . 
  huh . 
  so no more spanish-shaming ? 
  * but i like making fun about our king !, 
  the police do n't want to reveal his identity . 
  i 'd hope that they 'd like to kick him a bit first , but somehow i really doubt it, 
  but hey , let 's not doubt them !, 
  * maybe * he paid it with his * dad 's * treasury !, 
  * which is obviously fine * in that case !, 
  honestly no , but he probably has henchmen . 
  * paid by the state *, 
  we 're talking about common people here , not politicians . 
  i 've never seen a bribe/heard about a bribe situation in my entire life . 
  and you link me studies that talk about * corruption * , not bribes , aimed at powerful people , * not the commonfolk * . 
  i guess thinking in stereotypes is a hard mindset to break, 
  alright , so you 're just derrailing the conversation . 
  just for the sake of clarity , i 'll state it myself : ** there is no bribe culture in spain ** . 
  there is corruption ( never denied that , i do n't know why you 're trying to prove it ) , specially in politics and higher-income level people , but not within the common populace, 
  corruption mainly existed in the form of the * pelotazo * with created this crisis , politicians negotiating deals with people in the construction sector . 
  today , there is * still * a lot of corruption in the higher-income levels of the population ( politicians , bankers , businessmen ) . 
  there is no corruption in the middle and lower class people apart from black jobs . 
  * i 'll ask only once . 
  where does the `` bribes '' statistic appear there for the common people ? 
  * you do n't have a clue about what you 're talking, 
  and ? 
  bribes are nonexistant here too . 
  quit it with the prejudice, 
  they have identified him , though police wo n't release his identity ... how * hilarious * would it be it he turned out to be our `` ex-king '' juan carlos i in another one of his adventures, 
  so could i in sweeden with 50k $, 
  well yeah , but look at what the thread 's about , that 's the problem that we 're discussing about :p !, 
  they * still * seem to have strong ties to that party, 
  well yeah obviously , but it 's clear that syriza also screwed it up a bit . 
  this ` syriza makes cuts beacause eu forces them ' vs ` pp makes cuts beacause their are evil ' argument of podemos to justify them falls a bit short honestly, 
  yup , rajoy is using syriza as an example of why people should n't vote podemos . 
  it 's a trap that they themselves set up, 
  it 's pathetic and racist . 
  such a shame that some people still live in other time 's mindsets, 
  people can get this crazy , an / s was needed :p, 
  so what ? 
  spending on some things is necessary and nature is certainly one of those,

  mr. aznar seems to be bored over here ... he 'll come hand in hand with rajoy ( he 's quite timid , needs to be acompanied ) , that must be ok for you all right ?
