   is like a national treasure ( at least in catalonia ) . 
  * it actually is . 
  do n't mess with our pamtomaca *, 
  yup , it 's counted . 
  however for example in catalonia the industry also grew a lot , even if the services obviously were in the lead, 
  yeah , but pedrolo is n't my thing . 
  maybe i 'm too picky , but he 's a bit too bestseller for my taste . 
  then again , la pell freda is really similar to the hearth of darkness and it also sold really well so go figure . 
  there 's books for everyone in catalan too !, 
  oh alright sorry , it 's pretty late here :p, 
  is n't moby dick an american novel too ? 
  melville was from nyc , and it 's muuuch more important than many of the ones you 've listed, 
  [ michael strogoff is my all time favourite verne novel . 
  at least i remember that i really liked it a lot as a kid , and it 's one of my all time favourites ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_strogoff ) . 
  btw , no madame bovary or the red and the black ( they were from the xixth century were n't they ... ) ? 
  [ la pla\u00e7a del diamant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_time_of_the_doves ) , probably the best novel written in catalan . 
  [ josafat ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/josafat_ ( prudenci_bertrana \\ ) ) [ terra baixa - theater script - ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terra_baixa ) [ cr\u00f2niques de la veritat oculta ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/cr%c3%b2niques_de_la_veritat_oculta ) [ la pell freda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cold_skin ) + [ mirall trencat - repeating author ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/mirall_trencat ), 
  ah yes , but that 's not a problem of ac , it 's the people who do n't know how to regulate it !, 
  yup , i 'd be dead without it . 
  it 's been more than 35\u00ba here for more than a month now, 
  yup , also true with spanish and catalan !, 
  well ... now that you put it like that ... 
  aaahh , military intervention , catalonia is not a nation , non recogniton of a democratic vote , etc. 
  i see you 've shown your true colours !, 
  have a nice day mr troll , send my regards to la moncloa !, 
   not even a majority to cling on ( just hope for a majority ) that 's why we 're voting and * not declaring unilaterally * . 
  we do n't really know the proportions , all we 've got are polls . 
   no understanding of democracy 's issues i do understand it 's an issue . 
  overrespresenting a minority over the will of the majority is a bigger one though , and that 's the one that you 're not understading  `` they can either leave or stay here '' - see , say if i were in that region and voted no i would want to still be a citizen of spain and the eu , and keep my house / home / work / etc. 
  that ca n't happen in case of independence , the reverse does n't hold , nothing changes in case it fails . 
  so what , we 've won the vote . 
  you either accept the result or you leave . 
  again , democracy . 
  you might not like it , but it 's how western countries work . 
   one package thing ? , oh really ? , so you would like a self determination rule for yourself yet deny the self determination rule for parts of this self ? 
  ( i.e : say one / more cities end up heavily opposed to independence , yet on the whole region level , you get a slim majority ? 
  ) , where do you draw the lines and why ? 
  you do n't understand what self determination means . 
  just a hint : the full name is the `` right of self-determination * of nations * '', 
  i do n't avoid anything , i just know how the politics work in my nation . 
   you do n't even have a majority at the moment 42 % is low ( and no hope for a super majority ) we 've had one for years , it 's intermitent , and every year it picks up again around september or so . 
   as you said , the percentages change , so , should a long term decision be made on short term ultra low majority ? 
  ( the 50 % example i made earlier ) yes , beacause people will have voted and democracy works like this . 
   what should happen to all the people that do n't want independence ? 
  they can either leave or stay here . 
  what happens to the people that voted for independence if we lose ? 
   what happens if , for example , barcelona has 51 % vote to stay in spain ? 
  ( and the rest of the region is for ? , should you have a country without barcelona ? ), 
  that 's stupid , it 's obviously a one package thing , either the whole catalonia seccedes or nothing does . 
  regional votes does n't matter , what does is the overall result , like in all self-determination votes . 
  you could reverse the question ( barcelona wins and the rest does n't ) and it still would n't make sense, 
   if you had a referendum and got only 50.0001 % , should a new country be created ? 
  yes , that 's how democracy works . 
   should the question be done and closed ? 
  for the time being yes , but like in scotland , we 'd like to see some reforms at least, 
  it was done in a time of stagnation and uncertainty , people did n't know how , who or what they were going to vote , whereas the `` no '' side was more or less established . 
  besides , these things always recede during summer , it 'll go back up soon, 
  i mean , the map is pretty arbitrary and full of prejudice , i would n't like it either way , but i was just explaining why i do n't think croatia and spain should be grouped togheter, 
  i just told you what cultures i consider catalonia to be close to, 
  that still does n't make us culturally close . 
  we have the same culture as the south of france , genoa , naples , sicilly , and the spanish coast down until alacant , including the balearic islands . 
  the next `` level '' of cultural ties would probably be inland spain and france up until the center of that country , portugal , the rest of italy , greece and * maybe croatia *, 
  yaaaay , another one !, 
  i 'll name him * `` troll of the mountains '' * !, 
  and ? 
  why would your face have anything to do with our culture ? 
  well ... no :p, 
  they do n't even know what we 're talking about , and wo n't bother to even know * what they 're talking about *, 
  catalonia * is * a nation , not a state , and its language was promised official status, 
   and that 's relevant because ? 
  croatia has more in common with italy than balkans , yet you treat balkans as a same entity , so what . 
  if you 're gon na treat balkans as a single entity and throw croatia in , than you need to acknowledge its traits too . 
  croatia in the balkans as a whole is a minority , and you know that . 
   but you were n't talking about prejudice , but that we have more in common with eastern ones and that we 've always been eastern europe , which is a no-no . 
  * that 's the prejudice *, 
   if you include croatia in balkans , than you ca n't be more wrong . 
  inform yourself better . 
  balkans is n't only croatia , and they do n't speak a romance language , which a `` western country '' like france does ( btw , france is much closer to southern europe than western , but that just shows how flawed this map is and why iberia should be western ) . 
  religion and a few traditions is n't everything . 
  they are n't even the same ethinicity . 
  as a catalan , i feel exactly the same way . 
  [ that 's why i thank mr. demesmaeker for at least reminding the eu guys of their promises ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gun2uanln9m ) . 
  not being able to speak your language in a chamber that supposedly represents you ( both the spanish and european chambers do n't allow it ) is pretty dissapoiting , especially when your language has 10m + speakers, 
  last time this map was posted i noticed a lot of innacuracies in catalonia too, 
  the balkans culturally have 0 in common with the rest of southern european countries , and being many of them slavs , they have much more in common with the eastern ones , plus historically they 've always been eastern europe, 
  ... does spain have more cultural ties with serbia than with france ? 
  really ? 
  i am in university indeed :p, 
  yes , and as i said , it was a pretty stagnated time, 
  yet it is :p !, 
  [ well yeah , but that hardly includes the whole balkans . 
  and why is n't france in there then ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/romance_20c_en.png ), 
  so this is the map of prejudice then !, 
  ... so , living in the iberian penninsula , i do n't share anything culturally at all with a moldovan, 
  til the balkans are southern europe and iberia is not western ... even if it 's the westernmost part of the continent, 
  well , but independentists as myself also have to try to show these the benefits of independence . 
  that 's just a normal democratic process , better done in a referendum , but hey, 
  i 'm like , so old man !, 
  i 'm * olderer than you !,
