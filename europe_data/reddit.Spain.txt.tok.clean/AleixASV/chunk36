  thing is , we 're not buying that . 
  podemos in catalonia is just a branch of the spanish party , with no new offers to catalonia and even more `` centralized '' than psoe is here . 
  iglesias himself said that a referendum for seccession is impossible , for example . 
  it 's not that it could be a good thing to do . 
  it 's we belive that being independent * would be way better *, 
  well ... 
  but it 's just sadly too late , sorry !, 
  after all we 've been through , i do n't think negotiating inside spain is possible, 
  whatever man , you do n't know what you 're talking about and make fallacious comparisons . 
  you could at least look our movement up , but why bother right ? 
  we 're just * nazi * onalistas , like the right-wing spanish press says !, 
   that said , how is catalonia the oldest nation ? 
  even if you somehow ignore asturias at the highest point of the muslim conquest and you take the comtats as a nation , you should also count all the other territories ( leon , aragon , navarre ) . 
  alright fair enough , wikipedia says that asturias began to exist in 722 and the first catalan county ( rossell\u00f3 ) in 760 . 
  there is n't that much difference though !, 
  [ from thir article ] ( http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/1140167/0/reforma/constitucion/deficit/ ), 
  yeah , i 'm talking about this one precisely !, 
  it was done with data from a pretty stagnated time , but as i said , it will pick up again, 
  ... it 's like comparing apples to oranges . 
  we have to defend ourselves from an oppresive state that just 1 year ago wanted to heavily regulate the use of catalan in schools , not against a fake strawman like `` dem immigrants '' . 
  you just ackwoledged that you 're talking without informing yourself , both in the cultural and the economic issue , and it 's a pretty easy thing to do . 
  there 's 0 backing from leon , plus we 're more or less the oldest `` nation '' in the penninsula ( marca hispanica and comptats catalans ) so we definetely win them in that sense . 
  not that it matters that much though . 
  it 's like saying that the french departament of whatever wants to seccede just beacause it exists a french departament named whatever . 
  where there 's a region , someone will want to seccede from the overlord , but that does n't make it a serious independentist movement . 
  what are you trying to tell me with that ? 
   today 's nationalism has nothing to do with what happened in 1714 , and you know that . 
  stop trying to depict history like it was the struggle of a people against the pesky castillians . 
  it just was n't . 
  well ... of course it does . 
  we lost our rights and laws then , half of our capital was obliterated , we were treated as second class citizens for centuries with our language forbidden and you expect us to just forget it ? 
  my god . 
  this is the fallout from what could never be : an union between an authoritarian castille and catalonia has been shown time and time again that does n't work . 
  this was done when the process was * really * stagnated , it 's usually like this at this time of the year . 
  it will pick up again, 
   i 'm starting to believe that the brainwashing of the pro-independence crowd is as hardcore as the unionists ' . 
  no , not really , it 's beacause we follow the thing way more closely than your everyday spaniard ( i do n't blame them , it 's pretty tiring sometimes ) since it 's up to us to know what 's up . 
  let me source it up : [ it 's basically more or less what psoe says ... `` reforming the constitution '' and other fairytales . 
  reforming the spanish constitution is basically impossible , by the way ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ca&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.lavanguardia.com%2fpolitica%2f20150507%2f54431085107%2fpablo-iglesias-inviable-referendum-independencia-catalunya.html&amp;edit-text= ), 
  people were pretty chill with scotland i dunno ... 
  i kinda envy them . 
  though this is not a statal subreddit , this is / r/europe ... 
  it 's pretty sad, 
  [ 75 % of people are in favour of a referendum ] ( http://vozbcn.s3.amazonaws.com/figura/2013/06/20130609encuesta2.jpg ) . 
  there 's many polls about this , i 've just found this one , but you can search for more and all will tell you the same thing : everybody wants a referendum at least, 
  it 's stupid the more autonomy thing ? 
  i must tell you , we began like this and now we want to seccede, 
  no you do n't get it , we all want to be independent for purely economic reasons . 
  nationalism here is different than the mainstream view of nationalism . 
  for one , it has traditionally been a left-wing only thing : some people like myself are nationalists and want an state to protect our culture and language , which is basically the catalan definition of the word . 
  that 's it . 
  and we 're not diving europe , we 're even pro-federation !, 
  but * not * under spain . 
  this is a misconception that i 've seen many times around here . 
  yes , but nowadays he 's been talking that there are more important affairs than `` territorial disputes '' , basically ignoring our demands, 
   i hope people here support the right to decide in other nations of europe we absolutely do !, 
  well , the spanish state is whatever the people living there want it to be . 
  that is , if we seccede from spain , it 's everything * bar * catalonia, 
  first off : we 'll count the votes , not parlimentary seats . 
  we 're not idiots . 
  second off : podemos already said that a referendum is not their priority . 
  and third : generalizing opinions to latter critizise them is a pretty low level fallacy . 
  i do n't belive in strawman arguments but besides , i did n't say 1714 was the year catalonia stopped being independent ... what the hell ? 
  for a year ( 1713-1714 ) we actually were , but what i said was that 1714 is where the castilian armies conquered barcelona and aragon , ending our rights and laws by right of conquest and formed modern day spain , as ratified in the decree of nueva planta . 
  you can twist my words all you want , but you 'll just end up looking like an idiot, 
  it 's pretty sad ... 
  i guess it 's just trolls who love to derrail these discussions ( i 've seen some here too ) but they just ca n't be argued with, 
  they literally made an account mocking me , called `` aleixasv _ '' , who insulted the people i was talking with , making them belive that i insulted them . 
  so yeah, 
  hahahahaahaha i love to confuse foreigners !, 
  to be fair , spanish is also a part of our catalan heritage , since we 're a land formed by many generations of internal spanish immigrants . 
  all catalans should be fluent in both , but sadly while all speak spanish , francoists limited originally the use of catalan and today 's central gov tries to also limit the use of catalan in schools to solve this issue . 
  while catalan speakers are a vast majority in catalonia , it 's still not a 100 % for both languages like it should, 
  * alright *, 
  fair enough , though you 'll see fear from some once we start voting too :p, 
  yeah well ... despite it was a civil war , and they did n't want to establish a different state , but a diferent way of governing, 
  well but ... they did n't want to seccede from spain , they wanted to overthrow a government !, 
  that 's not secession , and they would get veeeery pissed off if you told them that they were !, 
  * i do n't quite know what to get out of this *, 
  actually i do see it as a main reason myself, 
  you did allude that they supported the seccessionists ( we did also exist back then ! ) . 
  let me tell you , their main enemies were precisely the * rojos , secesionistas y los judios , etc * ( the reds , seccessionists and jews , etc. ), 
   exactly spain as a estate did n't exist before that , so since the creation of spain , catalonia has been a part of it . 
  spain does n't exist without catalonia , as does n't exist without leon . 
  yes , in this sense this is true . 
  despite that , it honestly does n't mean much , it has only been 300 hundred years in which by the way we 've managed to keep ourselves firm and mantain our culture and language  on the other hand , i apologize for calling the secession war a `` spanish civil war '' , was an unfortunate selection of words , but was not definitely a war between two independents nations , was a pure dynastic war . 
  this also more or less true : aragon and castille were fighting each other to solve who would rule them both , so there 's an argument for the two nations thing . 
  and i see it as a violation of the rights of the catalan minority inside of spain . 
  sorry , democracy works as it does . 
  oxford dictonary is not cherrypicking . 
  you 're the one cherrypicking when backed against evidence saying that `` language changes '' . 
   so you would support the south 's right to secede in the us civil war ? 
  i think that makes you right wing , sorry . 
  this is just pure demagogy . 
  alright , i 've had enough , have a nice day !, 
  wtf . 
  they fucking killed our families . 
  i actually read an article about an ex-coronel affirming that the spanish army could n't invade catalonia . 
  [ little ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rbrksyggx8 ) [ examples ] ( https://twitter.com/heroisindepes/media ) the first shows the former minister of education basically wanting to reinstaurate a quasi-francoist schooling system in catalonia , limiting the use of catalan and in the latter you can see some of the insults from important people in the state against us . 
  * do you really think that we would n't be independent if we did n't have any reason for it ? * .
