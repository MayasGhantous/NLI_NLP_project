  read this comment [ about what started it all too , for a bit more of insight ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3dhlba/catalan_parties_planning_to_declare_independence/ct5f29k ) edit : i was downvoted just seconds after posting . 
  alright , keep it classy, 
  they are against independence and , when asked about a referendum , use a tactic here known as * pixar fora de test * ( literally , to pee outside the pot ) , which means that they evade the question and for example answer that a referendum about `` social problems '' is more important , ignoring the fact that a vast majority of catalans here want it . 
  edit : i 've [ just found an article where he says that it 's impossible to organize a referendum , by the way ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ca&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.lavanguardia.com%2fpolitica%2f20150507%2f54431085107%2fpablo-iglesias-inviable-referendum-independencia-catalunya.html&amp;edit-text= ), 
  plus we 're a nation with our own history , culture and a 10m + speakers language !, 
  but that 's a whole different issue . 
  besides , if we have a clear democratic mandate behind us backing our independence , western recognition is already ours, 
  we wo n't know till we vote . 
  it 's his opinion that we would n't win , not mine for example, 
  yeah , yeah , i saw it too late :p, 
   i said ` then president ' . 
  oh , sorry  it 's not his opinion , he is stating a fact that a new country would not be subject to any eu treaties . 
  that 's his interpretation of eu law , an opinion . 
  we have asked the official bodies for confirmation and they insisted on being neutral, 
   language and culture are not national factors , they are ethnic factors which merely correlate with nations . 
  many nations have multiple official languages and harbour multiple ethnic groups . 
  israel is a nation made up of dozens of ethnicities . 
  should arab israelis be able to gerrymander borders around majority arab resident areas of israel , and ask for independence from israel for that territory ? 
  left wing ideology is about uniting people of differing ethnic groups , not separating them . 
  nation = / = state nation : a large body of people united by ** common descent , history , culture , or language ** , inhabiting a particular state ** or territory ** state : a nation or territory considered as an organized political community under one government ( by oxford ) so as you see , language , culture and history * are * national traits . 
  and catalonia * is * a nation . 
   those changes happened before the existence of the un and international law , so they are irrelevant . 
  you are the one who is trying to use a legal argument here , so stick with it . 
  those changes happened between 1900 and 2015 , not in 1900 . 
  and self-determination was first recognised in the 11 points of wilson list , in ww1 by the way so yes , they had those rights then too . 
   so do you support independence referendums for every household in catalonia ? 
  after all , to say otherwise would be an authoritarian occupation and ignoring the will of the people of each household . 
  there is no good reason to draw the borders around catalonia except because of ethnic discrimination which is illegal under international law : ... any distinction , exclusion , restriction or preference based on race , color , descent , or national or ethnic origin that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition , enjoyment or exercise , on an equal footing , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural or any other field of public life . 
  ( part 1 of article 1 of the u.n. international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination ) the full name of the right is `` the self-determination * of nations * '' . 
  my household is not a nation . 
  do n't be ridicolous , you clearly do n't know what you 're talking about . 
   this is like saying that native american indians have the right to self determination , and can declare their nation on whatever land they want of the usa well , of course they can !, 
   left/right wing are nonsensical these days . 
  according to some , the usa is right wing and north korea is left wing . 
  real left wing ideology is about equality and uniting people . 
  yup !, 
  we 're very pro-eu here , even pro-federation !, 
  but not * under spain *, 
  well but i mean , if they are the majority ... 
  i do n't know about the issue obviously , and i ca n't talk about it , but in my honest opinion if they won a referendum for example , they should be recognised as a country . 
  no , that 's not what the right of * self * - determination means, 
  well i mean , i did n't specifically say that it was bad or good , there 's also some liars around catalan nationalists which i am ashamed of ( there 's idiots everywhere after all ) . 
  thing is , i 've rarely seen a spaniard get told off by another spaniard when the former is obviously lying and manipulating the situation around here . 
  we do tell our idiots off , there was a guy i think called / u/lliure or something like that who was basically talking about how spain treats us like a colony or whatever and we * did * tell him to stop . 
  ex-president actually . 
  today 's president is donald tusk , but whatever . 
  that 's * his * oppinion which if i remember corrently , was stated when he was sitting next to the spanish foreign affairs minister ( with a grin on his face ) . 
  hardly something to be taken into account . 
  the eu is neutral on this issue . 
  so you 're implying that democracy is bad then ? 
  but i mean , if they want to be independent ... why not ? 
  romania is a democracy after all is n't it ? 
   you are spain , even if you do n't want to be , that is a fact . 
  this argument is the lowest of the low , here known as * que pone en tu dni * or `` what is in your id ? 
  '' , so i 'll ignore it . 
   false . 
  spain is the nation , and people in catalonia are spanish citizens . 
  international law and the un is based on the rights of nations , not the rights of territories within a nation . 
  there is no right to secesion recognised by the un . 
  the right to territorial integrity takes precedence over the right to self determination . 
  catalonia is a nation , wheter you want to accept it or not . 
  we have our language , history and culture . 
  what we do n't have is a state , but that is not a requisite for being a nation , and even then we 'll solve that need really soon , do n't worry . 
   the right to territorial integrity takes precedence over the right to self determination . 
  then why more half of the states in europe today did n't exist in 1900 ? 
  territorial integrity only applies under foreign involvement , by the way . 
   that is only true if spain agrees to it , like in cases such as foreign colonies where the people have separate citizenship . 
  catalans do not have separate citizenship . 
  there is no catalan passport . 
  it 's clear that spain does not agree to it , and spain has the right to decide its own laws . 
  spain owns catalonia , just as equally as it owns all of its national territory . 
  so what you 're saying is that catalonia is currently occupied land basically , since spain has a say in absolutely everything that happens to it , ignoring the will of the people that live there . 
  that is called being authoritarian you know ? 
   giving extra rights to spanish citizens who are residents of catalonia than other spanish citizens is a right wing racist ideology . 
  no , everybody has the right of selfdetermination . 
  the basques for example can exercise it if they want too !, 
  and what i 'm getting is that maybe * you 're the right wing one *, 
  thank you !, 
  spanish nationalism often goes unchecked around here , and i 've got ta be honest , it sometimes pisses me off, 
   and yet the only time catalonia made a real push for independence was during the spanish civil war , when shit had already hit the fan anyway . 
  beacause before we made that push , we had allies . 
  the english , the austrians , etc. 
  those ran away negotiating behind our backs . 
  * how do you expect us to win between the armies of castille and france combined with no help ? 
  *  i 'm not trying to offend anyone but there is a reason why some nations became independent while others did not . 
  balkans , poland , baltics and ireland were all willing to fight wars for their independence . 
  they were willing to put their own lives on the line and had to build their countries up from scratch . 
  and then there are movements who want independence but only if the transition would be smooth and yield instant financial benefits . 
  you do n't know our history then . 
  we have prevailed 300 hundred years of spanish oppresion , including the persecution of our language and culture , that despite their attemps today has more than 10m speakers . 
   now think about it and answer yourself : would you still want independence for catalonia if it meant hardships and a financial setback that would possibly take generations to fix ? 
  of course , but for many people this is n't just about their national identity , since catalonia is a land of immigrants ( especially from other regions of spain ) and if they want to be independent is beacause they know they 'll live better , not worse , without spain . 
  or you could give these minorities reasons for not wanting to separate and not follow spain 's example . 
  to begin with , an `` estatut '' is basically a catalan word for a constitution . 
  since we are n't independent , that is our charter of `` self-governing rights inside of spain '' . 
  so ok , with that our of the way : in the early 2000 ( now i feel old !, 
  ) , catalan nationalists ( which is a transersal movement , from the right wing of ciu to the left of erc for example ) decided that the decentralized rights obtained in 1978 when the dictatorship ended were n't enough for catalonia . 
  we basically wanted a new estatut . 
  so the push began . 
  zapatero , the newly elected spanish president , promised to accept whatever estatut we voted in our regional chamber .
