  you should see some of the things i 've been told around here, 
  thank you !, 
  we need all the support we can get . 
  reddit weirdly enough usually is n't a nice place for catalan independentists i 've come to find, 
  the spanish main parties both fear a ton of votes for `` conceding us what we want '' ( especially if it involves `` breaking spain '' ) even if that is a referendum and the fact that we could win it . 
  tell that to the basque :p, 
  thank you !, 
  most of these comments here do n't even ackowledge our right to vote and do n't understand either why we have to do it in elections ( spain wo n't allow a referendum ) or even why we want to be independent !, 
  there is no law , official statement or treaty that applies in this case , so this is just pure speculation, 
  that is absolutely false . 
  maybe what your state-propaganda wants you to think , but false nonetheless . 
  there are idiots everywhere , but the catalan independentists just want a better future for themselves , and think that without spain we 'll live better, 
   or we could , i do n't know , focus on working into a fairer and more united europe ? 
  maybe that would be smarter ... we here are very pro-eu . 
  but not with spain . 
  and before reciting this your demagogy :  ( the province of catalunya with it 's invincible armies , powerful democratic leverage and stronger-than-the-us economy shall prosper and bring the catunyan people to a new golden age you at least could 've informed yourself about * why * we want to be independent , because it 's apparent that you do n't know crap, 
  it absolutely is . 
  if we have an independentist majority we have a democratic mandate to do so . 
  it 's not like we have n't tried time and time again to organise a propper referendum anyway, 
  [ we eat it here too !, 
  it 's called `` compota '' ] ( http://www.recetariocanecositas.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/dscn2330.jpg ), 
  do n't forget his famous spechees !, 
  and i quote : * it 's not the same thing if someone rules than if somebody else does . 
  said in another way : it is very different !, 
  * * spain is a great country and it has spanish people !, 
  * [ and of course , his great control of the english language !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7efoz6otxik ), 
  oh alright , thanks !, 
  why the mexican flag ? 
  * here !, 
  * close killoh , shoy de santako chaval !, 
  * ( but yeah , i more or less have the barcelon\u00ed accent :p ), 
  yup . 
  as a speaker of a close-related to the standard dialect , people do n't know how to speak and i get to judge them,

  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lipjx2i3hui ) ^ ( thank god she 's been kicked out ), 
  oh , no , i put that flair name myself !, 
  :p it 's just a bit of irony to counter the thousands of spanish trolls that leap of out nowhere in every thread just to argue for the hell of it !, 
  * if i 'm not real you ca n't touch me !, 
  [ america * maaaaaybe * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_maine_ ( acr-1 \\ ) ) did it too ... it 's too coincidental for a warship in a country that you want to attack to just blow up, 
  thing is , spain has a lot of population and very few representation . 
  the few people that care about these things here do n't like it * at all *, 
  we 're apparently not `` western '' europe anymore , but southern , which in all intents and porpuses means that we are n't to be taken into account when making decisions, 
  oh , there 's a huge shitstorm here beacause of that . 
  just remeber , their main argument was `` he 'll get elected because he took spain out of the hole '' . 
  not getting his prize implies many things ... irrelevance being the main one, 
  [ i mean , these things did n't even stop happening in the middle of the cold war , with full manteinance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1966_palomares_b-52_crash ), 
   southern europe you mean the balkans ... last time we had a war here it was even before most european countries last conflict , ww2, 
  i 'll later link you the threads , if i can still find them edit : [ one example ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/39xyev/reurope_is_slowly_but_surely_changing_how_do_you/cs86498 ) , [ two ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/382xjq/paris_migrant_camp_a_slum_in_the_heart_of_the/crs0s25?context=10000 ) , [ three ! ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/334mq0/there_is_one_proven_100_effective_way_of_stopping/cqhi32y?context=10000 ) ... 
  ahhhh yeah , i remember a few months ago that people here advocated for the construction of such camps ... well , what now ? 
  is it bad beacause it 's greek ? 
  [ here is why : density of population ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/espdens2.jpg ) . 
  the rest are forest , farmlands or wastelands, 
  welp . 
  that was nice for you i guess ... 
  those rectangular family trees are never good, 
  ... wait what . 
  did they give you up on the treaty of utrecht ? 
  beacause if so , they basically traded you with us : the other countries in the war of succession between aragon and castille basically let the castilians and the french chew at us while abandoning our side ( basically italian states , uk and austria ) and that meant the conquest and annexation of aragon by castille , the start of the state of spain ... and 300 fucking centuries of oppression under spanish rule . 
  i knew that castille gave up concessions on america and italy to keep our allies from defending us ( they bought them off , basically ) , but i never knew that they gave up the netherlands . 
  so welp , we 've been duped once again ( it hapened too with portugal , where we were revolting and the took the chance and revolted too , forcing castille to chose who to keep and welp , they also chose us ), 
  eh , then we 're more or less on the same page !, 
  maybe beacause we 've had to deal with them a lot more we 're maybe a bit more beligerant but our anthem also targets the french ... which we also do n't like :p !, 
  but really , what were the spanish doing up there ? 
  i know that they held some lands but for a really short amount of time and i more or less learnt it through eu4 :p, 
  huh ... we 're not so . . complacent with the spanish in ours ( this is too the very first stanza ) : * catalonia triumphant * * shall again be rich and bountiful . 
  * * drive away these people , * * who are so conceited and so contemptful . 
  * [ if you have n't heard here it is by the way . 
  i know i 'm not being objective , but it 's my favourite , maybe beacause the orchestration was done in a very `` romantic style '' in late xix that really suits anthems or beacause the lyrics are so cleverly done but i love it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6au7hvr6yx0 ), 
   no , the dutch anthem praises the spanish king ... what . 
  just so you know , a semi-common catalan phrase in demonstrations was `` mori el borb\u00f3 '' ( death to the bourbon ) not so long ago ... yeah, 
  reina sof\u00eda lo lava con lej\u00eda , etc * yeah , you 'd better at least put some lyrics ... do n't let the people make them up :p, 
  emmmmmm ... nope, 
  i mean , just check my flair :p !, 
  good thing that we were one of the only few industrialized regions in southern europe ) ; ( though they ommited * a ton * of stuff from down here ... but hey ), 
  second most montanious country in europe !, 
  people actually do n't know about that !, 
  i mean yeah , [ this ] ( http://www.meteovallsdaneu.com/img/picadestats-2.jpg ) is just a few hundred km from barcelona , and apart from the coast , snow is pretty common here, 
  that is * a ton * of snow for us here . 
  remember , it only * snows * ( and by that i mean any snow at all ) every 3 or 4 years !, 
  nope , has n't snowed in years . 
  it 's usually every 3 or 4, 
  i 'm also with greece !, 
  whatever happens though , at least democracy will triumph for a day when the greeks will vote in spite of all the criticism coming from brussels, 
  yeah yeah , i had forgot about this a long time ago ... thing is , i just found it again a few hours ago thanks to the mention of a guy who i guess just found this thread, 
  all i can say is , there 's * good * internet people and * bad * internet people ... 
  does that mean that they are , all in all , * people * ? 
  huh , who could 've guessed it :p !, 
  it 's ok , it 's just internet people being internet people . 
  sadly people just will use whatever they come up with for attempted attack . 
  it 's not that i really care about magic internet points anyway :p thing is , people find this post 2 months after the last comment on it and still try to justify that idiot ... 
  i do n't even know, 
   but he also heavily biased and spouts propaganda . 
  that is , of course , your own bias showing . 
  has rivera won anything ? 
  he certainly has n't by speaking catalan and defending the rights of his nation , but by droping all claim to represent us and flee to madrid , where he hopes to get elected and maybe lead a colation with pp , a possible outcome in the upcoming elections and in the tax deficit thing . 
  well , let 's get the [ data ] ( http://in.directe.cat/imatges/noticies/grafic-deficit-fiscal.jpg ) out , shall we ? 
  you 're clearly wrong there, 
  now that you said that ... yeah ... a little bit !, 
  but i 've still got brown hair !,
