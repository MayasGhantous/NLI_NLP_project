  it 's all just so ... * fake * . 
  he starts speaking from the perspective of castille as an excuse to show his hiperbolaes and * never * stops , without sources , of course, 
  this was a fucking trainwreck ... my god you could n't have contradicted yourself more if you even tried . 
  `` neutral perspective '' my ass , really , brainwashing ? 
  good infrastructure ? 
  * ancient medieval families ? 
  * ** not talking about demolishing half of barcelona , the prohibitions of the catalan language , the fiscal deficit , the continious insults both to our culture and education ** ? 
  what a piece of garbage, 
  both . 
  and you should have done it a * long * time ago , probably when writing ... and please , factually correct sources , not wikipedia ... 
  no , but you might have ... and so , why do n't you go ahead and post those books ? 
  are n't you so `` neutral '' ? 
  claiming brainwashing is pretty ridicolous if you portray yourself as objective in the first place, 
  you just blew it all in a paragraph ... 
  yes , it was pretty `` neutral '' until there ... 
  but really ... no sources at all ? 
  claiming brainwashing like that is blatant propaganda and yet you call yourself objective ? 
  what a wasted opportunity, 
  we can say `` conductor '' , but the common word is `` maquinista '' , both in catalan and castilian, 
  i was speaking about the railway system . 
  you know , going at twice the allowed speed * while * talking to someone * supposedly in charge * of your and other trains is ... probably not good , not because of the accident in and of itself , but because they * can pull it off * and no one cares, 
  spain is basically a failed state and has been for a long time, 
  yeah alright , so our movement is made off thin air . 
   all nationalism is rightwing . 
  not it catalonia it is n't, 
  except that in this case it 's pretty obvious that spain does n't care about us and since in catalonia traditional parties have always been left-wing ( because of the exile from franco and the polaritzation before the civil war ) all catalan-based parties are independentists except two that have n't defined themselves and for the moment are pro-referendum only . 
  the other 3 parties , one of them based in catalonia but pretty new and obviously a proxy and two state-wide parties are right-wing or follow directives from madrid that tell them to deny the referendum, 
  also in catalonia [ here ] ( http://www.tv3.cat/3alacarta/#/directes/tv3 ) you can watch all our national channels, 
  you do n't understand : mostly , the only parties that are prounion are right-wing, 
   the public are not capable of being entrusted with the implications . 
  never said it was n't ... 
  funny nevertheless, 
  we 'll laugh at their faces of how inept they are and go to the united nations once we have declared ourselves independent . 
  what further proof would we need then to demonstrate spain 's inability to take us into account ? 
  also estelades are accounted into catalonia and then into spain or even maybe not at all ? 
  oh the irony !, 
  is my flair ( estelada ) counted as catalonia and so , as spain ? 
  if so , that 's quite ironic, 
  what ? 
  we vote for them ... maybe some years ago ( around 30 or 40 ) when we were n't that democratic you would have been right ... 
  queterunya, 
  [ interactive map + news article ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ca&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ca&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.324.cat%2fnoticia%2f2495571%2fpolitica%2fun-96-dels-municipis-catalans-aproven-mocions-de-suport-a-la-consulta-del-9-n&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ), 
  and that 's why we wo n't care about it when voting !, 
  thanks for going straight to the point , not many people realise how ridicolous all of this is !, 
   anyway , all the cases had the approval of the central government . 
  how sad that spain ca n't get on their level democratically then, 
  so all recent cases * are * exceptions ? 
  alright, 
   most countries have representative democracy , not direct democracy . 
  most developed countries let their citizens decide on referendums . 
  you can search the cases of quebec , chechoslovakia , scotland , etc. 
  because they have n't wanted to make one . 
  i was referring to private polls , which are indeed listed there, 
  that 's why we stop the ones that actually bothered to go all the way there and steal it again from them !, 
  * you know what they say , it 's ok to rob a robber !, 
  they ( we :( ) are called `` pixapins '' or `` de can fanga '' ... at least in the very hillybilly territories . 
  that by the way means tree-pisser and `` the one from the mudhouse '' because of the mud that people from barcelona used to leave in their houses before streets were properly made . 
  even though it is n't * reeeeally * nice , the folklore is funny, 
  few developed countries do n't let their citizens organise referendums . 
  few developed countries are n't democratic, 
  that one is n't updated and if you look closely ( right next to the name , in big bolded letters ) you 'll see it says `` 1996 '' . 
  they have n't asked anymore it seems ( how strange , i wonder why ), 
  this is not eu4 , politics do n't work this way and we have n't * even * voted if we want to be independent , there 's still plenty of time to decide all that, 
  [ here 's a nice list of * all * the polls , like i said ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ca&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ca&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fca.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2festudis_del_suport_social_a_la_independ%25c3%25a8ncia_de_catalunya&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) . 
  ( `` yes '' is weirdly translanted into `` according to '' btw ), 
  it is biased as hell, 
  this is n't reliable at all , it contradicts * all * recent polls made even by madrid, 
  or more ... democracy works this way , it is not a perfect system like all the others, 
  this is an opinion , and the one that is shared between the majority of ours is other . 
  this is how democracy works, 
  70 % want to vote , not 60 ( 23 do n't and 7 abstain ) * and 58 % want independence , so we 'll mostly follow our people 's will : if they want to be independent no law should deny their right to do so . 
  what a shame that people keep using it as it was designed to is n't it ? 
  that 's what happens when monuments to fascism are kept : fascists go to them and multiply , so much in fact that as i said , it is still in use as the `` general\u00edsimo 's '' cript, 
  so would you say the same about germania were hitler to live and build it with prisioners treated like slaves and buried where they stood ? 
  that thing had to be demolished once franco died, 
  why would you go to the biggest shame of this country ? 
  it 's basically a fascist monument , a `` what would happen if the nazi grounds on nuremberg where maintaned by the state '', 
  but they were n't communists , the commies were only a fraction of the population and they were fighting versus the anarchists ( which * were * leading the country , the only example of an anarchic state in history ) apart from the fascists . 
  the communists were funded by the urss yes , but poorly , moscow never cared much about spain anyway ... maybe a bit more than the allies though , that made concetration camps for exiles to turn them back to franco so they could be executed or sent to death camps in nazi germany, 
  a possible one . 
  and not under the inlfuence of russia , we could have easily got rit of them like the greeks , not like they cared much about us anyway . 
  also you do n't know half the shit that idiot did right ? 
  so you are saying that it 's way better to be a fascist state than a * potential soon-to-be communist but not because of allies and the end of the ww2 * state ? 
  you know that we had to endure that fucker until late 70 do n't you ? 
  ehhh we 're remodelating it ( which we should just demolish and rebuild ) ... yeah it 's not the prettiest but it works i guess, 
  suck it madrid , we can overcrowd our buildings better !, 
  and weirldy enough , i got to see america for my first time aswell this summer !, 
  ( ny , which pretty much was the best city i 've seen in my life ) so it seems we 've changed perspectives . 
  did you get to see the other gaud\u00ed 's masterpieces ? 
  also , it 's pretty funny when foreigners come here pretty full of themselves with their spanish claiming to understand everything and then seeing that we use another language ( though we all know spanish btw ) , did that happen to you or you did n't know spanish at all ? 
  their albums are free to download on their page , i 'll link it to you in my another comment !, 
  hey man , it looks like we shared the concert ( txarango , the band that played at around 10:30 pm has their [ albums ] ( http://txarango.com/downloads/?lang=en ) free to download on their webpage ) !, 
  i also went there , it was amazing !, 
  also , you keep saying barce ? ... 
  the only `` nicknames '' that i know ( and i 'm from here ) are barna and bcn ... maybe you are referring to bar\u00e7a , but that 's our football club , not the city !, 
  also what you saw there with the `` castells '' ( or castles ) is a pretty old ( medieval i think ) tradition that is usually done in the `` festa major '' ( or major `` feast '' ) which every city has on the same day of their saint patron 's ( la merc\u00e8 for example is `` la mare de d\u00e9u de la merc\u00e8 '' or the mother of god and mercy ) . 
  also happy that you finally liked our city , i 'm guessing you saw a lot more that you have there in your album right ? 
  and well i guess you at least saw artur mas and maybe not understood wholly our struggle but seen it firsthand !, 
  honestly , it 's pretty easy to deduce it ... 
  i do n't know what they get brigading like that except making a fool of themselves , i could n't care less about magic internet points,
