  i kinda do and do not get sunburned : as summer passes and i get more and more tan the chance of sunburn goes down , but i sometimes do use sunscreen !, 
  satire is an effective way to tell a story and in this case it 's a perfect example of why, 
  llavors si que \u00e9s valor del meme aquell d'askreddit ( tot i que era bastant pesadet si recordo b\u00e9 ) * please : is it `` bomb '' class rice from the ebre river ? 
  is it for a paella ? 
  then it is worthy of that askreddit 's meme ( though it was quite shitty if i remeber correctly ), 
  are we both from the same race anymore ? 
  you northerners must all be penguins !, 
  beacause `` mecago en la leche '' ( i shit on milk ) is a spanish insult , it does n't exist in catalan : here we say `` i shit on egg '' ( mecago 'n l'ou ) . 
  since there is no grammar on these kinds of insults , i just wrote it as a full word . 
   edit : thanks for the insults guide , this are the most important thing to learn of any language . 
  that is pretty crazy . 
  we do n't have much insolation here beacause it would be a waste : houses need to get rid of the high temperatures on summer and , since winters here are n't cold ( they never drop below zero usually ) we do n't really need it that much then, 
  not megacoenunhuevo !, 
  that is spanish !, 
  me cago'n l'ou is the catalan proper spelling !, 
  togheter with : `` tros de soca '' ( piece of strain ) , `` gamar\u00das '' ( tawny owl ) , `` eixelebrat '' ( loopy ) , `` filibuster '' ( filibuster ) , `` poca-solta '' ( little loose ) , `` tros d'ase '' ( piece of donkey ) , `` tros de qu\u00d2niam '' ( piece of fool - but really weird synonim - ) , `` set-ci\u00c8ncies '' ( seven sciences ) , `` galifardeu '' ( kid , in a childish sense ) , `` pixa-pins '' ( pee-pines ) , `` tal\u00d2s '' ( slow-witted ) , `` estaquirot '' ( pell - medieval wooden training post - ) , `` sapastre '' ( dimwitted ) * learn your stereotipical catalan insults that are n't really used today !, 
  those magical magical genes !, 
  but i for example ca n't stand anything lower than 15c with just a tshirt you see ? ... 
  not that it gets much lower than that here , and if it does i 'll already have a ton of clothes to protect me !, 
  to not stand cold weather is much more practical than warm !, 
  you just put a jacket or something and you 're fine !, 
  what a bunch of pussies right ? 
  * but then again , i 'm sure that some texan or californian will pop up and tell us that 35c is just their room temp all year long ... *, 
  sorry but i do n't get it ... 
  if you do n't have ac it will certainly be hotter inside than outside right ? 
  i mean , i only close my window at nightime beacause of the mosquitoes and now i 'm around 31c . 
  it 's not that bad really . 
  you know , we the catalans are practical people, 
  * literal trans . 
  : wafer bitch the shit europeans do not know our clich\u00c9 names ishitonegg fucking josep that does n't let his name be known !, 
  yup , many people here think that you 'll get a cold * beacause it 's winter ... and it 's cold out there *, 
  so we do n't have to deal with northerners like you ? 
  yeah , that 'd be fine, 
  yes , i think so . 
  but i dunno , that does n't say that much about them , it 's just as you said , like pp but `` better '' . 
  allowing ppsoe to keep their reign ... meh, 
  [ looks like they do n't like being in government for now , that 's why they 're allowing pp to get it ] ( http://kaosenlared.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/11390094_1613557782254666_2116450268810451380_n.jpg ) . 
  so much for `` renovaci\u00f3n '', 
  i still remember when people outside of catalonia told me that ciudadanos was left-wing ... ha !, 
  we 've had to endure them for 8 years at least , i hope spaniards are n't fooled by them in the upcoming elections, 
  aha , now you gave up on trying to talk like normal people and resorted to memes . 
  alright , i guess i should 've expected this, 
  ... what the hell man , you 're making up concepts  self-determination unilaterily . 
  this is n't a thing . 
  [ the right to self-determination is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-determination#the_un_charter ) :  in 1941 allies of world war ii signed the atlantic charter and accepted the principle of self-determination . 
  in january 1942 twenty-six states signed the declaration by united nations , which accepted those principles . 
  the ratification of the united nations charter in 1945 at the end of world war ii placed the right of self-determination into the framework of international law and diplomacy . 
   the right to self-determination in an unilateral way just does n't exist . 
  well ... you do n't get it . 
  it 's * self * - determination . 
  the only ones that get to chose are the ones that decide if they stay or not . 
  that is a human right recognised by the un and there 's legal precedent , so we 're pretty much fine with jurisdiction if we want . 
   i guess france is an anti-democratic and fascist country then . 
  it is in this sense of course . 
  not letting people vote is as undemocratic as it gets . 
  but yes , you do n't get it : do you really think that we care about your constitution ? 
  the one that apparently does n't let us vote ? 
  nothing further than the truth !, 
  let 's sit back and enjoy what will happen at the 27-s . 
  it wo n't be the first time that we 've broken it , 
  so you 're justifying the right to * not * let the catalans vote ? 
  alright . 
  tell that to canada with quebec , the uk , usa , [ etc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/independence_referendum ) . 
  how weird that they were able to organize them , were n't they ? 
   this , although some people describe it as anti-democratic or fascist , it 's pretty damn reasonable , as it would n't make sense to write a constitution for a country where said constitution would allow a territory to secede unilaterally therefore jeopardizing the existence of said country . 
  this , beacause * it is * anti-democratic and fascist ( not letting people * is * antidemocratic , and it seems pretty crazy to me that you 're even able to type that ) is something that we will have to ignore . 
  beacause while * there is basis for negotiating a referendum in the spanish constitution * , the denial and close-minded rethoric of the spanish government has forced us to ignore the constitution , not being able to reach an agreement after years of tries and attempts . 
  now keep in mind : self-determination and unilateral seccession are n't the same thing . 
  we 've could 've solved this like a first world country by simply letting us vote . 
  sadly , it seems that the democratic standards of spain are n't on par with a country of the first world . 
  that 's why we 'll ignore them . 
  we 're doing our referendum either way , and if we win it , we 'll seccede . 
  you then can enjoy what it says on your paper all you like , constitutions get their power from the people , not the other way around . 
  it 's like we say here '' * paper mullat * '', 
  hahahahaaha , it 's our instinct !, 
   yeah , i just moved from england to barcelona for my job . 
  there are quite a few catalan flags around and the only people i know from barcelona support independence , but that is a sample size of two , and they are sisters :p yup !, 
  you 'll see , once how our `` elections '' ( which are plebisicitary , they act as a referendum ) are getting closer more independentists will start to show their support . 
  elections are on the 27s , and in our national day , the 11 of september , we 'll organize a big demonstration to prove our majority !, 
   i do n't understand it to be honest - is n't the right to self-determination one of the main things of the un etc. 
  they just ignore it . 
  turns out , when you have a consitution open to interpretation you can easily use it to justify your crap ( which by the way , was designed with these kinds of things in mind , plus to cover apologists of the franco regime ) . 
   it gets trickier for the uk in places like northern ireland where they vote to remain british , but the place is a bit of a money sink and incredibly politically unstable ( although far better now ) but what are we meant to do ? 
  tell the people that voted to stay in the union that we wo n't have them ? 
  yeah , i 've heard it 's way better now . 
  uk actually understands what democracy means . 
  here people give all kinds of excuses for not letting us the catalans organise one , and it 's pretty sad honestly . 
  we 've got self-determination recognised [ by the un , whatever anyone might tell you here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-determination#the_un_charter ), 
  when it 's appropiate for your own interests , of course , 
  i 've seen spanish leftists defend greece and their referendum like they 've never defended catalonia . 
  it 's pretty ridicolous, 
  oooh i 've been there !, 
  * next time i 'll try to find these musicians and pay them !, 
  a lot !, 
  * `` this planet has - or rather had - a problem , which was this : most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time . 
  many solutions were suggested for this problem , but most of these were largely concerned with the movement of small green pieces of paper , which was odd because on the whole it was n't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy . '' * am i too na\u00efve ? 
  i really hope the especially eu and tsipras and co. both remember that they 're dealing with the livelihood people here . 
  or you could say that french is actually written like catalan but actually mispronounced , we 're quite the old language here , i 'm betting on that actually !, 
  dubious though . 
  spain 's ruled today with a neoliberal conservative government which does n't want anything coming from syritza to work , giving podemos , their equivalent here , any ground to gain votes on .
