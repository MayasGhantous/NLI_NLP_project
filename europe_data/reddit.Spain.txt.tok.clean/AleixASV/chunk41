  it 's been pretty clear these last months that much of the media has riled up against greece and in turn , against podemos , and this does n't seem like an exception . 
  now keep in mind , i do n't like or support podemos , but what the spanish press is doing here is just a dirty war , the independentists here already know how madrid works in that sense ... 
  i guess you mus n't like your state that much if you go insulting people around , be aware that it wo n't last long ... just goes to show all what i said earlier, 
  it is , that 's true, 
  * checks flair * ... moooving on edit : some background on why did i say that : nationalism for spaniards only exists if you do n't have an army and a state backing you . 
  that 's why they say that * there are no spanish nationalists * , only patriots . 
  they belive that we all somehow belive some kind of cheap demagogy , that an entire nation is full of dumb idiots who buy into that or the other guy 's speeches . 
  nothing further from the truth . 
  i wo n't waste time discussing with these kinds of people, 
  yes , but then again , many regions of the big european countries still would have the same culture and interests , making the whole thing void , since they would essentially act as a single entity . 
  i know what this means , and i really doubt it would work sadly . 
  i 'm content with us and all the other nations currently under states to be independent , since that seems to be the most `` organic '' way of doing it , which usually ends up being the better one . 
  ... sorry but no . 
  barcelona 's mayor - not a politican , but a very known face here , ada colau - , while allied to podemos is n't from that party . 
  they 're a coalition that includes it ( plus an independentist platform and a party that had governed barcelona ** for three decades at least ** , iniciativa , which ada had previously even sabotaged their acts before allying to them ... shows you her integrity ) beacause we do n't really buy cheap populism alone , podemos is almost non-existant in catalonia . 
  ... i did understand you , and i told you that no , catalonia is a nation , not a region , and we would just be another one in the current system of states of europe . 
  in the map that you 've sent me btw , catalonia is still there , so i guess i would n't oppose it , even if we 're lacking our northern [ part ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/localitzaci%c3%b3_de_la_catalunya_nord_respecte_catalunya.png ) , currently in france . 
   but to be clear , the nations would cease to exist and regions would hold the federal power the way the states in the us do . 
  this just for me seems like a colossal misunderstanding of what the eu is . 
  we celebrate diversity within the nations that comprise the union , and this partition would only leave way to uniformity , which is in no way what i want of europe ( and besides , it would never work , nationalism is still strong , at least here ) . 
  as i said , as time progresses , hopefully more nations will follow our cause , and so we will truly have an * europe of nation-states * , and not what we have to deal with today . 
  not saying it is n't complete , since there are already a lot of these types of countries inside the eu , but some of them ( the biggest example being spain ) are n't . 
  this way , we still get the diversity of the nations and the united-states-like proportion of the states . 
   in my opinion the eu is far from in the right shape to handle these secessions . 
  well but really , we do n't actually care that much about how 's the eu doing , since we 're the ones recieving most of the crap for that !, 
  the mistreatment from madrid during this crisis has been horrible and we 're certain that we could be doing much better without spain leeching us , in turn putting eu in a better position . 
  however , if the eu is going to turn federal at some point , multi-national states such as spain will never work . 
  catalonia of course is not a region but a nation and so we would like to be represented equally with all the others in the continent , not just as a region of spain . 
  i understand what you mean with the europe of regions but that is not the case with us . 
  yes , we 're all europeists here . 
  in fact , cup 's euroescepticism is rarely mentioned and just a thing that people gloss over , something that they will never have the power to enforce , which is pretty much right . 
  i very much doubt that the majority of their voters are eurosceptics even , and they 're a small party . 
  at least with the independentists , there 's a big consensus about staying in the eu, 
  there 's a big one in catalonia , [ cup ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/popular_unity_candidates ) , very left wing , more than podemos/syritza even ( though the former has seriously downplayed their ideals and it 's probably on par with psoe right now ) . 
  they 're independentists and want a catalonia outside the eu , but they do know what they are doing and have shown a lot of talent in this legislature . 
  i 'm not an euroesceptic but i might vote them in the next elections , since they wo n't get enough votes to , for example , pull us off of the eu , but they 're part of the parties that vowed to unilaterally secced catalonia if they have a majority togheter with all the other independentists this 27s and they 're probably the most honest of the bunch, 
  i tried learning german , too time consuming , maybe when i 'll be even more bored i 'll try again ( no but really , it was hard ) !, 
  see how important germanics are :p for us down here !, 
  and english is just in the cool languages club beacause of its french influences , we all know it !, 
  yes !, 
  [ this is the third form of the plural `` passat perifr\u00e0stic '' ] ( http://blocs.xtec.cat/rosasagales/files/2014/01/cantar.jpg ) , which i think would be equivalent to the [ pret\u00e9rito perfecto simple ] ( http://image.slidesharecdn.com/conjugacionverbal-140930121448-phpapp02/95/conjugacion-verbal-1-638.jpg?cb=1412079363 ) . 
  the conjugations though as you can see , are different , since catalan has its roots in the `` langue d'oc '' ( it began as somewhat of a `` brother language '' to occitan , and many dialects of the latter are very similar to catalan still ) of the south of france whereas the iberian languages like galician or castilian share a common root !, 
  and the glorious imperium , do n't forget the imperium !, 
  they built roads and crap here !, 
  * i l'imperi , no t ` oblidis de l'imperi !, 
  oh of course , to accept the catalan supremacy must be emotionally conflictive :p * oh \u00e9s clar , acceptar la supremacia catalana deu ser emocionalment conflictiu :p *, 
  welp , just watched that movie 2 days ago . 
  ca n't say i oppose ... all of those beautiful women in bunkers ... 
  we could be all smug and talk about how superior romance languages are compared to others ... which i mean , everybody just accepts as a fact right ? 
  that is fucking amazing, 
  that is true , yes, 
  a little / s is sometimes requiered on reddit :p, 
  huh ... 
  i do n't really like all of the solutions , especially the first one . 
  while interesting , it just evades the problem , since all of the people who do n't speak that language will see the comment in english . 
  what 's the point of diversity then ? 
  the others are just like italics but even worse : gray text is horrible ( if that is how it 's going to stay ) and they are cumbersome indeed to read, 
  probably yes , radicalism just breeds more radicalism , which ultimately helps their `` cause '' , converting moderate muslims into radicals, 
  of course it is !, 
  i 'm talking about reddit 's opinion !, 
  this thread, 
  that 's your opinion, 
  as i said , people are n't complaining about eu to the degree of the external one, 
  i do n't really think internal immigration is the main issue here , but you 're wrong . 
  uk is not a schengen country , they can control it, 
  ... and ? 
  so could spain with all the south americans . 
  and france with the algerians , etc. 
  this is nonsense, 
  nope , few people do it nowadays, 
  bread without tomato , oil , salt ( and optionally a bit of garlic ) is heresy in catalonia . 
  just so you 're all aware, 
  it had to be bacalhau . 
  i mean , you can risk your life that a portugese will bring bacalhau and you wo n't even sweat, 
  i bring the dessert , since there 's nothing that can beat [ crema catalana ] ( http://www.hola.com/imagenes/cocina/escuela/2010102246112/receta/crema/catalana/0-152-684/crema_catalana-a.jpg ) . 
  the damm frenchies tried to copy it with creme brule\u00e9 , but they only got a bland , toned down , version of it, 
  well ... that sounds really surprising given how your county 's economy is doing honestly ... 
  here the prices skyrocketed when the crisis came , and there 's few scholarships left , apart from laughable help in the erasmus program compared to other countries, 
  ... holy shit really ? 
  all universities in many european countries are paid ( private ones cost a ton more ) . 
  my degree will cost me 10731 $ without taxes or tuition , which is also a couple thousand euros . 
  in a public university , in spain, 
  ooooh but it 's nooot !, 
  it 's deliciooous !, 
  yep !, 
  they 're really similar !, 
  noooo !, 
  it 's a weird sauce that does contain mayo , but if it 's well done [ you wo n't notice it , it has a different taste ! ] ( http://www.lapanxetacontenta.es/html/9429_elisabeth_paulet_siles/img/prod_430324_.jpg ) . 
  then we have the hardcore version , [ `` bra\u00e7 de gitano - the salad version , beacause there 's a dessert one - '' ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ckeqawlljd4/u5swditxedi/aaaaaaadcqw/zaophefhosc/s1600/img_0025.jpg ) , made with potato , tuna , eggs , etc. 
  ( it 's name means gypy 's arm btw :p ), 
   i meant tapas in that you 're served several small plates with bread & tomatoes to eat them . 
  well i mean , all bread in catalonia should have tomato , oil and salt . 
  and it should go by law :p  i also like the kind you can find in e.g. 
  carrer de blai , but that 's not my main pleasure . 
  yeah , that 's more like spanish style tapas , but when you say tapas people usually refer to those !, 
   i also ate in small places around joanic , but mostly seafood :d . i 'll try escudella next time :d yup !, 
  it 's hard to find a good place that serves escudella , but if you do you 'll love it !, 
  we usually mix the menues for every day ( for example thursdays is usually rice day and wendsays escudella day i think ) and escudella is a winter dish !, 
  by the way , [ is `` russian salad '' ( amanida russa ) ] ( http://www.grupnolla.com/img/producto/fullsize/1-ensaladilla.jpg ) popular outside of spain ? 
  i have n't seen it when i travel and it 's one of the best summer dishes !,
