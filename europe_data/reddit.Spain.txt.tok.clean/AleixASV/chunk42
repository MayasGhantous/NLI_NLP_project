   i came in january , and again in late april . 
  i love the city but i 'm not a fan of summertime  . 
  still , gaudi places were crowded . 
  yup , today 's a nice day and we 're at 26\u00ba !, 
  and i 'd say if you want a pretty empty barcelona you should risk it and come on autumn , it 's when there 's the least people ... but when it rains more !, 
   nope . 
  to be honest i spent a fair share of my time walking around the streets and shopping eateries . 
  walking down a street in bcn feels like walking shadows in amber 's books : the landscape never stops changing yup !, 
  we 've got everything , even small skyscrapers and contemporary architecture ( on the 22 @ district ) !, 
   and there 's the food , it 's like the city : you 've got so much diversity in the food that often picking several tapas rather than a full dish is the way to go . 
  can you imagine yourself eating only seafood ? 
  man , i love pulpo but that 's only one of many good things . 
  i 'll take notes for my next trip tho  weeeell ... barcelona has great tapas but we 're not known for that , you should go to sant sebasti\u00e0 ( donosti ) for that :p !, 
  they have the best i 've ever eaten !, 
  have you tried [ crema catalana ? 
  ] ( http://www.hola.com/imagenes/cocina/escuela/2010102246112/receta/crema/catalana/0-152-684/crema_catalana-a.jpg ) it 's the dish you bastards copied and toned down to make creme brule\u00e9 , and it 's 100 times better , with * much , much * more flavour . 
  it 's my favourite dessert ever , i ca n't stop eating it . 
  if you come on autum you should eat [ panellets , some sweets that we only eat for the night of the 31st of october , all saints day - no halloween here - ] ( http://sp1.fotolog.com/photo/33/0/31/merchix/1225659494095_f.jpg ) , paella well i 'm sure you know it , we 've got the best [ llagostins ] ( http://www.lesputesreceptesdelaiaia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/lesputesreceptesdelaiaia_llagostins_cava.jpg?w=300 ) in the planet ( though i do n't like 'em ) , [ escudella , my favourite traditional dish ooohhh it 's so delicious ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/escudella.jpg ) , [ canelons ] ( http://www.solucionsgastronomiques.com/content/productes/entrants/canelons/images/1.jpg ) , etc. !, 
  people should go to traditional catalan restaurants and pick whatever , it 's all delicious . 
  sadly they almost do n't exist on the tourist areas , they 're one of those things still only * for the locals * . 
  if you truly want to experience our food , get out of the center , go to gr\u00e0cia around pla\u00e7a joanic , poble sec or sant andreu , which are n't still totally flooded with tourists . 
   i need more than gaudi :p . what i got from that : [ you need ice cream then !, 
  ] ( http://multimedia.catalunya.com/mds/multimedia/48614/f2/palau-guell.jpg ) :d  but seriously , i have seen things that i enjoyed much more than gaudi 's work in bcn . 
  the mnac has one of the most gorgeous roman collections in europe , for instance . 
  and i enjoyed the quietness of reading a book in the santa creu garden ( maybe i was lucky on the lack of tourists , granted ) more than the crowded casa batlo visit . 
  yeah , that 's the main problem , it 's overcrowded almost all year long . 
  if you want to visit us you should probably never come on summer : it 's hot and full of people . 
  and if you 're after museums , did you check out our science museum ? 
  i 've traveled a lot , and it 's the best i 've seen . 
  [ yes , this is a full recreation of an amazonian jungle ] ( http://barcelona-home.com/blog/wp-content/upload/2013/10/cosmocaixa-barcelona-science-museum-park.jpg ) . 
  [ it 's gigantic ] ( http://www.kfntravelguide.com/content/images/thumbs/0003773.jpeg ) , [ really ] ( http://www.seriouslyfish.com/wp-content/uploads/imported/monthly_07_2008/post-3-1215295235.jpg ) . 
  a lot of tourists miss it and i 'm not quite sure why , it 's fucking amazing . 
  and the thing about mnac is that , while it is the biggest romanesque museum in the world , we 've also got [ the original churches still standing ] ( http://ep00.epimg.net/ccaa/imagenes/2013/03/03/catalunya/1362333435_289920_1362333605_noticia_normal.jpg ) , [ and people interested in that just travel there ] ( http://www.arteguias.com/imagenes/ripoll.jpg ) . 
  gaud\u00ed is the main attraction usually , while things like mnac are a side-visit ( people go up there for the vistas usually ) . 
   my point is n't that everyone will want to see these ; it 's that the gaudi-mania is overshadowing some of these . 
  and we 're back to the point where barcelona 's strength is not fully exploited : it 's the most diverse city i got to visit , but you would n't know that if you listen to some tourist guides . 
  absolutely true though !, 
  even then as i said , if you only went to barcelona and saw gaud\u00ed and a few other things i 'd say you got pretty cool holydays !, 
  he 's got so many amazing things that they warrant a visit just for themselves . 
  i do n't think barcelona is a city that you can only go there once , it 's just impossible to see everything . 
  maybe go deeper on the second visit and leave the big touristic things like his works for the first . 
  all of what you said can be answered with : gaud\u00ed is amazing and you need to see more of it . 
  while la pedrera and la sagrada fam\u00edlia are cool , they 're not his only works . 
  that 's why they advertise them . 
  i mean , if i were to go to barcelona i would do at least 3 days ( combining with other things ) in a week , he has by far the best buildings in barcelona and no ones disputes that ( he 's been voted as the most important catalan in history for god 's sake :p ) . 
  ... we do it on catalonia , not sure what you 're talking about , but we call it `` dia del sant '' , or saint 's day . 
  it 's not that big of a celebration , but you get at least a phone call from distant relatives and so on, 
  wtf . 
  * you do not get to say that to a local . 
  * gaud\u00ed is the paradigm of barcelona . 
  i know we got a lot more than just him , but to a tourist that does n't know anything at all about the city , only seeing gaud\u00ed 's buildings puts him in heaven . 
  and if someone does n't value our other stuff it 's beacause they 're idiots and do n't bother reasearching were they 're traveling to ( you 'll see them dressed in flamenco dresses or potentially mexican hats , with what we call `` the lobster skin '' beacause they do n't know what a sunscreen is , we call them `` guiris '' ), 
  this is a pretty good album of the city , but remember , despite the fact that i love architecture , barcelona is not all about the buildings . 
  there 's this feeling that i only got also in berlin of being relaxed and laid back which i find really valuable when on vacation . 
  and btw , you can come here and only bother about gaud\u00ed 's buildings and despite that you 'll have a pretty full vacation !, 
  the guy did build a lot !, 
  i 'm going there this summer and this is one of the things that i 'll check out, 
  yup , it 's as the thread says , my favourite european city no doubt about that !, 
  it just has something ... different , it 's way more laid back than the others, 
   if you do n't like it why do you sell it in the ramblas ? 
  beacause people will sell whatever tourists will buy . 
  and tourists do n't know where they are going so they buy whatever . 
  we banned the more ridicolous things , like mexican hats . 
   and , there is a huge andalousian community in barcelona . 
  its `` feria de abril '' is bigger than malaga 's one , and there are probably hundreds of `` tablaos '' in barcelona ... its part of identity you like it or not . 
  yeah . 
  you know what 's bigger than andalusia 's identity ? 
  catalonia 's . 
  if you wanted to go see tablaos you go to andalusia . 
  ... dammit !, 
  nope !, 
  * we * won !, 
  we 're the winners !, 
  yaaaaaaaay !, 
  youth unemployment of almost 50 % !, 
  [ oh we fucking know . 
  and they also do in madrid ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ca&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.lavanguardia.com%2fpolitica%2f20111027%2f54237244306%2fpeces-barba-quiza-nos-hubiera-ido-mejor-con-los-portugueses-y-sin-los-catalanes.html&amp;edit-text= ) . 
  we even got that war on our anthem !, 
  it 's called [ the reapers !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-bdn3zih2w ) , ( like that war you linked , called `` the reapers war '' here ) ^ ^ pretty ^ ^ badass ^ ^ name ^ ^ btw, 
   `` one day i bought a portuguese towel ... '' , in other hand if they live in the other side of spain , like catalunya they will whisper : `` fuck this shit !, 
  why ca n't catalunya be independent too ? 
  we 're better than this ! '', 
  hahahahahaha pretty true !, 
  then we 're ok ! ... 
  unless bar\u00e7a loses against you 're team when you 're visiting ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ wo n't ^ ^ ^ happen ^ ^ ^ :p !, 
  please do n't take my ignorance as malice , i meant to disrespect !, 
  i hope the vote goes whichever way you need it to go !, 
  hey , really , i did n't take offence !, 
  people ca n't know everything !, 
   cheap is relative . 
  i earn about 1000 euros per month over here , is that anywhere near minimum wage over there ? 
  could i live off it in barcelona ? 
  yup , i think so !, 
  there 's a whole generation of young people called `` mileuristas '' ( a-thousand-euro-istas ) who earn just that . 
  it 's a low salary but there 's people here earning much less !, 
   i imagine the sum in catalonia for that is somewhere like 2500 - 3000 euros / month ... 
  so cheap for you is still prohibitively expensive for me , barring a few bank robberies :p and yeah , you 're right with that . 
  people here can earn a bit more than in romania , especially since catalonia is the richest region in spain . 
   see ?
