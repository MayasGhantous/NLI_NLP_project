  i did n't even know that shit , i had to google to see the difference between catalonia and spain , i had no idea it was an autonomous region . 
  we 're our own nation , with language , culture and history !, 
  we 're even voting for independence on september the 27th :p !, 
   holy shit , i know what my retirement plan is now . 
  i do n't care what i have to do , all i want is to afford to live in barcelona by the time i retire . 
  time to rob some banks , i guess . 
  and to top it all off , it 's cheap as dirt !, 
  as big touristic cities go , it 's muuuch cheaper than paris or even berlin ( which is also not expensive ) !, 
  so no robbing banks !, 
   players from catalonia play for spain . 
  and yet the catalan team is only allowed to play a match per year and against a carefully chosen boring rival . 
  the spanish selection does n't represent us and the catalans who play there are usually seen as traitors . 
   aside of that , are shirts of other nations or spanish club shirts ( not barca or espanyol ) ok ? 
  if it 's madrid you 're wishing for a beating !, 
  :p no but seriously , we do n't have anything against that , but why would you buy a madrid t-shirt in barcelona ? 
  thank you !, 
  i mean , we 're not spain , we 're catalonia :p but going to barcelona just for gaud\u00ed is cool enough , even though if you do n't take him into account we 've got a ton [ of shit ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/palau_de_la_m%c3%basica_catalana,_the_catalan_concert_hall.jpg ) [ to ] ( http://www.apartmentsbebarcelona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/catedral-de-barcelona.jpg ) [ offer ( yes , that is a bigass amazonian rainforest inside a museum ] ( http://s3.zoochat.com.s3.amazonaws.com/large/p1500252-186467.jpg ) , [ but really ] ( http://cdn.conocerbarcelona.com/guias/barcelona/fotos/playas-barcelona.jpg ) [ this is ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4050/4453252077_99b6ce841d_b.jpg ) [ a pretty amazing city ] ( http://www.barcelona.citysam.de/fotos-barcelona-i/les-rambles/rambles-5.jpg ) [ to live in ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qgngahwif-i/ulvblez5o_i/aaaaaaaaadc/ovm8j5zp2ow/s1600/barcelona_montjuic_castle_aerial_view+ ( 1 \\ ) . jpg ) , and i have n't even shown you half of gaud\u00ed 's stuff too , he still had more buildings . 
  [ you must surely know about la sagrada fam\u00edlia , his most well know masterpiece and source of our tourism right ? 
  :p ] ( http://www.m80radio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/sagrada-familia.jpg ) . 
  [ or el park g\u00fcell ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/parc_g%c3%bcell_ ( barcelona \\ ) _ - _ 58 . jpg ) , [ another one ] ( http://viajahispano.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/drac.jpg ) [ of his works ] ( http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1421/1117756628_ff199aa84c_o.jpg ), 
  [ it 's one of gaud\u00ed 's masterpieces , `` la pedrera '' ( or la casa mil\u00e0 , which is it 's official name ) ] ( http://www.pasaporteblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/la-pedrera.jpg ) !, 
   there 's people smiling in that second picture , they have n't known the true face of winter !, 
  come spend a couple of weeks in -10 c and constant snowstorm , then we 'll see if anybody laughs !, 
  :p oh they wo n't , unless they are nordic tourists !, 
   damn , it must get really dusty over there !, 
  :p yup !, 
  but as i said , it rarely happens more than a few times per year !, 
  and by the way , when it does snow in barcelona ( beacause snow in catalonia is not common when you 're on the coast like our capital is ) you get things [ like ] ( http://blogs.hola.com/viviresunplacer/fototott.jpg ) [ these ] ( http://www.wawis.com.mx/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/wawis_barcelona_nevada.jpg ) [ here ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bpa3k6drkca/ul5atnq5wii/aaaaaaaab6e/asljzhxn_14/s1600/montju%25c3%25afc.%2bpalau%2bnacional.jpg ), 
  naaaah , let me search a foto or something , they 're quite harmless . 
  it 's just that the droplets contain a lot of sand in them and so if you stand in the middle of one you might end up full of mud . 
  [ here is how it looks like over barcelona !, 
  ] ( http://statics.ccma.cat/multimedia/jpg/4/9/1367236074194.jpg ) and we even got mud snow in the [ pyrenees ] ( http://lh6.ggpht.com/-hvgikmjxhcu/u2jch-1euxi/aaaaaaaaby4/fvnbopffvla/rt%252520abril%2525202014%252520neu_fang.jpg ) , though it was cooler seeing it live with a background behind it :p [ and this is how your car might end up ] ( http://www.btv.cat/btvnoticies/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/galeria-fang-@enricbotella-barcelona-r-486x389.jpg ), 
  ... we get saharan mudstorms here sometimes :p !, 
  the clouds are all brownish and you better not leave your house !, 
  though they 're pretty cool to see nonetheless , and quite rare . 
  saharan winds usually just ramp up temperatures, 
  ooh well , here in catalonia we can get to 40\u00ba , though rarely on barcelona : the mediterraneum sea makes our climate humid ( which sucks ) but equilibrated . 
  we never drop below -5 \u00ba and it only snows once every few years . 
  any temperature below 15\u00ba is freezing cold for us though :p, 
  we 're currently at 25\u00ba in barcelona at 8pm , at it gets * way * hotter at midday ( it can reach 35\u00ba sometimes ) ... 
  it gets annoying on summers , trust me :p, 
  maybe it 's beacause of mediterranean culture ? 
  but we 're still eating dinner later , beacause of the timezone thing that i said . 
  we 're now at 8pm and the sun is n't setting still, 
   where i use the maastricht treaty used to define the process by which nation states gain accession to the eu , you are relying on the absence of a statement from officials and the lack of laws to back you up , yet you accuse me of speculation . 
  i accuse you of speculation ( and i do so again now ) beacause you just said this : ** which nation states gain accession to the eu ** the eu has not confirmed that we would be kicked out and there 's no law for this case , so * statu quo * , which is remaining inside of it remains until any change happens . 
  7am-4pm , closer to european standards , so they are able to have more time in the afternoon, 
  usually 8/9am -5 / 6pm ( with long lunch pause , we eat strong lunches here ) if you 're lucky , it can get deeper into the afternoon . 
  a lot of people are protesting about this , since it leaves them with little to no free time left, 
  ** when in catalonia do not ** : dress , buy go , talk , wear etc. 
  about : sevillanas/flamenco/mexican hats/toros . 
  no , we 're not andaluc\u00eda / mexico/madrid/whatever . 
  yes , we do have our own culture , we 're a nation for god 's sake . 
  if you do n't like it you should 've gone to those previous regions . 
  we 're all fucking tired of a [ bunch of lobster guiris ] ( http://biboz.net/humor/quemaduras.jpg ) ( btw buy sunscream , really ) dressing their kids with flamenco dresses and buying [ this fucking heresy ] ( http://artgaudi.com/store/646-thickbox_default/toro-trencadis.jpg ) , or going around with shirts of the spanish football team . 
  they do n't even know where they have gone on vacation probably, 
  here the sun sets at 9-10pm , franco changed our original time to align himself with hitler during ww2 and nobody bothered to change it back , so it 's kinda screwed . 
  tv prime time here is at 11pm, 
  there 's also now legislation or precedent for any country inside the eu secceding from another , so what you just said is speculation . 
  there is no official statement from the eu confirming that we would leave, 
   freedom is a complex word , americans have always understood this . 
  the only true freedom is the freedom that is taken , not given . 
  aaaaaand do you think we 're doing this referendum with spain 's backing ? 
   you do n't get any shortcuts buddy , if you want your freedom whatever that means to you . 
  then you better be prepared to take it , no one will give it to you . 
  we 're breaking the spanish constitution doing this ...  let me look back at the great u.s. british referendum of 1776 , oh look , never happened . 
  so a democratic referendum on the twenty-first century is comparable to a war in the eighteenth ( the same in which we were conquered by spain btw in one of the most heroic sieges in history ) , yeah , whatever, 
  whatever , belive what you want . 
  they pulled that data out of their arse ( counted military and state spending for each community , which is ridicolously stupid ) but as you wish, 
  that 's not barcelona , that 's catalonia . 
  and it 's understandable , given our situation . 
  we still have to pay help for other regions when we 're the most indebt, 
   however , you keep quoting statistics that are frequently used by erc . 
  i have to ask , are you a member or something ? 
  i just linked a graph from google . 
  was that some kind of attack to undermine my arguments or what ? 
  i very much doubt people here on reddit will vote pp , their voterbase is mainly older people that are accomodated and well-off or do n't know much about what 's happening and go to church every sunday . 
  problem here comes when new parties like ciudadanos come and talk about renovation and the younger people belive them . 
  [ these 17 townhalls are now ruled by pp thanks to ciudadanos in the last local elections , just to give you an idea of how similar they are ] ( http://kaosenlared.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/11390094_1613557782254666_2116450268810451380_n-300x208.jpg ), 
  you make interesting points , while ignoring all mine . 
  this is not a discussion , but a monologue, 
   to feed ? 
  spain does n't import all their food and funnily enough they have a neighbor to the west that could help them and shit load of harbours themselves . 
  this simply does not work . 
  spain imports electricity , food and consumer goods , plus most of their exports go through us . 
   since when ? 
  tolls is a legitimate defense if it 's to protect your own economy , if you are using it to harm another , then it 's an attack . 
  if spain vetoes our entry to the eu it is a clear attack to our economy . 
   being in the eu is not a right , it 's an earned privilege and i do n't see catalonia earning it with blackmail . 
  we are already in the eu , we comply with all the pre-requisites . 
  the only reason we would n't be able to get in is due to spain 's pettyness . 
  what `` earned privilege '' bullshit are you talking about ? 
  you know that 's not true, 
   such as ? 
  well , basically our main claims of independence . 
  [ a bit outdated but still true ] ( http://interactius.ara.cat/9n/en )  there 's this thing called harbors , there pretty useful . 
  and infrastructure would be build if there is a need , the eu might even help fund it . 
  do you even know anything at all about logistics ? 
  to feed an entire country of +40 m people with boats ? 
  tolls would still be cheaper .
