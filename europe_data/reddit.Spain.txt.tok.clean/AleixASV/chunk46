  probably ciutadans or pp . 
  those who voted pxc did it * only * beacause they were xenophobs , but since they were a pretty small power they were n't able to establish themselves as a party , even losing their `` farange '' , mr. anglada ( it seems that all these parties have their leader ) due to internal tensions . 
  pp and ciutadans somewhat ate their message , like in the case of badalona , and beacause they 're way more well known people opted to vote for those who appeared in the tv that said what they wanted to hear . 
   `` they '' are . 
  most redditors who comment on these topics . 
  the context here is easy if you 've been following the immigration threads . 
  and that 's why i called them xenophobic and not racist openly . 
  some are , but xenophobia is way more extended , probably beacause it 's more politically correct, 
  well , that 's beacause immigrants do n't hold power and they 're an easy target for politicians to spew their demagogy all over . 
  but by the way , it 's legally impossible to send back the refugees if they have claimed assylum , since their countries qualify for that . 
   he probably pissed off all the other parties with his message , but honestly , i think they were already pissed at him just by being a pp member , and i seriously doubt he could have ever received the support of any of them , with or without his xenophobic speech . 
  was n't there enough support from ciutadans ? 
   his xenophobic/populist speech granted him more sympathies than he previously had , it 's not a thing about this guy , badalona , catalonia or spain , it is a common trend that can be seen in all europe , we are even seeing it ourselves in this thread . 
  have n't seen it outside of badalona to be honest . 
  well , maybe some pp ` eros did it , but the main xenphobic party here , pxc has just been killed in these elections , so i strongly disagree with stating that the trend has come over here . 
  i 'd say that * it came here last municipal elections * and died with these new ones, 
  yet that message is what made him lose the town hall , precisely what made all parties go against him . 
  had he cut down on the so reactionary discourse he could 've tried to negotiate with some party to keep power . 
  but was kicked out nevertheless . 
  the right wing is more united , but has less following , so in the end it is n't a problem : the one with more votes * actually * got through . 
  besides , it 's not like this is a badalona only thing , many cities have followed the trend of pacting , both among the left and right wing parties, 
  maybe beacause the problem of the immigrants is only coming to you as the immigrant itself , i 'd say having the frontier next to us lets us see the bigger picture , with the illegal deportations , horrible conditions in which they are `` housed '' and violence used by the spanish police, 
  huh ... 
  it seems that here right-wing politicians are trying to spin this into becoming an issue , seeing how it 's working in other countries . 
  but yeah , psoe is * hardly * left wing anymore : they 're monarchic , centralist and pretty contempt with the church, 
  yes . 
  and ? 
  are you implying that i do ? 
  yup , no problem !, 
  it 's true , immigration is n't that much of a problem here and i 'd say that it 's probably because we 're not doing so well ourselves ( we 've got deeper problems ) and beacause we 'd look like a bunch of hypocrites if we complained about this , since many young people are actually emmigrating to europe !, 
  yup , this is just retarded . 
  sadly it 's only another droplet in the rain, 
   do you think the debate in spain would be any different if the flow was more strongly directed there ? 
  i 'm guessing here but i think it has become such a big deal in italy as so many have arrived so quickly ( a couple of thousand in a single weekend for example ) . 
  it actually is . 
  we 're one of the most important routes for immigrants to cross and there always is a strong debate when incidents happen at the walls of melilla and ceuta . 
  but we never `` demonize '' the immigrant , there have been many protests and demonstrations about the horrible conditions of the `` retention centers '' that are being set up . 
   how do people in catalonua see this ? 
  catalonia has a high percentage of immigrants ( probably higher than most other parts of spain ) . 
  does immigration ever come up in political debate there ? 
  i mean in general as i can imagine independence and the crisis are way more important at the moment . 
  immigration is a core `` tennet '' in catalonia : a really big chunck of the population consists of internal immigrants from poorer regions of spain , so we 've always been more accepting with these kinds of things . 
  immigrants only come up on political debate on the local level - rarely on the state - from the hand of right wing parties such as [ pp ] ( http://www.lacronicadelpajarito.es/sites/default/files/styles/articulo/public/imagenes/fotos/2015/05/xavier_garcia_albiol_pp_badalona_twitter.jpg?itok=e8jlieuu ) `` limpiando badalona '' means `` cleansing badalona '' . 
  this guy here is infamous for this sort of thing , so as you can see people took his message and spun it [ a bit ] ( http://lacolumna.cat/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/11225822_835390329868861_1401043406_n-620x330.jpg ) . 
  these xenophobs are rarely taken seriously , usually only by old people . 
  when they are seen talking with these connotations though , they 're called fascists . 
  important to note that on the last election this guy - who was the mayor of badalona - was kicked out of the town hall and other parties with messages similar to his did n't even gain representation on much of the town halls . 
  this european right wing has n't taken off in spain really , people here look up to leftist parties such as podemos or middle grounds for the big old pp and psoe such as ciudadans, 
  i do n't really like the use of force , especially in people : * not from your country , that have risqued their lives coming here , that are malnourished and exploited by mafias , that are poor , and that could cause a violation of the human rights * violence is not an option in this case, 
  not that i know of . 
  actually i 'd say it 's the opposite : here in spain we 're quite open about religion ( at least excluding the weird catholic towns ) , homosexuality , immigration , etc. 
  immigration here is * not * an issue , it 's not talked by any means as it is in the rest of europe . 
  what it is an issue is the really reactionary stance that europe is taking with immigration . 
  i remember hearing that one really small tv channel [ referred to the people in this foto as `` bats '' ] ( http://images.eldiario.es/blogs/inmigrantes-intentan-saltar-valla-melilla_ediima20140318_0691_17.jpg ) and they caused quite the shitstorm . 
  and they are actually doing just that . 
  people in spain get really pissed [ when these things ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2198106/thumbs/o-valla-900.jpg?6 ) happen [ in our country ] ( http://www.lasexta.com/clipping/2014/05/01/00333/30.jpg ) and i totally share their view, 
  if only we could build some kind of * large * metal ring in the center of europe ... maybe around switzerland , so if it explodes it does n't matter , where politicians could be spun really fast and maybe acquire ** infinite power ? 
  maybe limit it to a weekly thread ? 
  or delete the most irrelevant ? 
  though the latter could sparkle some controversy ... 
  actually no , the south of europe is turning left ... 
  this could lead to a weird clash ( if it has n't happened already ), 
  yup , and they 're at least xenophobic , if not openly racist . 
  it 's easy to justify wanting to search a good life for you and your family , but it seems that they lack the empathy to understand that something like that is what they are searching aswell, 
  well i mean , here in catalonia you need to go outside of the barcelona metro area to actually hear catalan spoken ... we 're on the same boat, 
  * yurop relevant again !, 
  well i mean ... / r/barcelona is kinda active but / r/catalunya is pretty dead , there 's not that many catalans on reddit . 
  though yes , if you include scotland i 'd argue that we should be there in some sort of way aswell, 
  missed scotland ? 
  how ? 
  * if you guys get something we also should !, 
  nope , we were independent for a few centuries, 
  yup , it 's an extremely precious patrimony to the region and to europe !, 
  such an interesting language !, 
   ok , but each county was independent from each other and the principality of catalonia was part of the kingdom of aragon so , as usual , you are taking a historical fact twisting it so that it fits your ideas . 
  well not really , most of them were loyal to the house of barcelona . 
  that 's like saying that the hre did n't have any connection to modern day germany . 
  of course it does . 
   '' visca el re\u00ed d \u00b4 espanya i muiren els traidors '' '' long live the king of spain and death to the traitors '' `` viurem lliures o morirem '' ? 
  the catalan counties were though , and that 's what later formed the principality of catalonia . 
  apart from the 3 republics of catalonia that have existed , of course, 
  yes of course , that 's why i said ` tecnically ', 
  yeeaaah it was , we fought to the last !, 
  alright , that 's pretty amazing ... now i 'm hungry !, 
  btw , many of those dishes are * reeeeally * similar to the ones here , though i guess that 's no surprise beacause of the southern europe culture thingy, 
  i know he was good overall ... 
  but i mean , but trying to buy us in inside france ( read : annexing ) with more autonomy and crap while simulatenously raping and pillaging the countryside is pretty counterintuitive to be honest, 
  i guess we 're the weird ones [ since we tecnically celebrate a defeat ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_day_of_catalonia ) ... that 's what happens when you ca n't into state :(, 
  are they all bacalhau ? 
  sadly it seems that spain 's too concerned about some stickers and if they see one over the ` es ' of spain they 'll fine you , plus it 's the only plate allowed, 
  the ammount of hate that i saw over / r/soccer was astounding ... 
  calling them uefalona , etc. 
  people * are * bitter , and love rotting for the underdog . 
  it 's pretty sad . 
  and ? 
  so beacause this one team had 3 injuries bar\u00e7a ca n't be proud of what they 've done ? 
  really ? 
  if bayern did n't belive in winning they could 've forfeited . 
  they did n't , so that makes your point invalid, 
  that 's not true and you know it .
