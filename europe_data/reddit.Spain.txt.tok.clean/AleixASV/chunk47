  they would n't have reached their respective positions in the champions league if they had been that weak as you suggest . 
  of course teams are weaker/stronger , but they were the champions of each country nevertheless , a pair of injuries * only reduces slightly their power * . 
  and juve only had one guy injured . 
  so you do n't consider ajax netherland 's champion , for example ? 
  or netherlands to be a good country in terms of football ? 
  and it was a especially though road the one that we had to pave , defeating half of europe 's champions ( the good half ) !, 
  baaaaaar\u00e7a !, 
  thankfully , independentism here has always been a left leaning thing , as weird as it sounds , and as i said , the only radical party that supports it is pretty good !, 
  i just do ... 
  i have my sources ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ call ^ ^ ^ ^ them ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ mi-1714 ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ make ^ ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ ^ feel ^ ^ ^ ^ important, 
  clear spanish nationalist photoshop . 
  i do not wear glasses !, 
  [ :3 ] ( http://oi40.tinypic.com/2ngy4ic.jpg ), 
  welp , good thing the only extremist party that supports our independence is leftist and is actually reasonable , serving as a moderator for all the other independentist parties :p, 
  well well well , thankfully no far anything had to make ours , we sticked them ourselves !, 
  [ :p ] ( http://www.directe.cat/imatges/noticies/matricula-cat.jpg ), 
  just thought about that guy due to our discussion ... he 's quite the idiot, 
  [ look at what this idiot said . 
  and he was one of the writers of our current constitution . 
  now do you understand why we do n't like spain ? 
  i de res !, 
  yup , actually portuguese and catalan are really close !, 
  :d ( both portuguese and catalan have '' \u00e7 '' , that has to count for something right ? ), 
  well almost , that would be * visca catalunya lliure !, 
   spain , barcelona and the surrounding areas had catalan flags everywhere . 
  that would be beacause we 're trying * not to be spain *, 
  beacause when you 're trying to create your own state it 's beacause people want it . 
  they show their support by hanging flags, 
  it 's safer than bottled water , so what 's the deal ? 
  the mediterranean is full of them , they 're not exactly a tropical tree !, 
  el diminutiu de ` francisco ' ( es deia francisco franco ) en castell\u00e0 \u00e9s ` paco ' ... el motiu \u00e9s m\u00e9s o menys el mateix que quan la gent li deia ` juanca ' al rei anterior , per enfotre-se 'n i deslegitimar-lo * the diminutive of ` francisco ' ( his name was francisco franco ) in spanish is ` paco ' ... the reason of why people called him this is kinda the same as when they called the old king ` juanca ' : to make fun of him and to de-legitimaze his rule * btw your catalan is pretty good !, 
  just swap ` crides ' with ` dius ' or ` anomenes ' and it 's almost native !, 
  and it is ( it 's world heritage site i think ) !, 
  and the food down there is delicious !, 
  * i shit on all , it 's like we ca n't express ourselves , like on times of paco ( franco ) , i shit on egg !, 
  i also like it thouuugh i wo n't have an opinion until i use it for a while, 
  so , the usual thing !, 
  my only recommendation is that you should * not * go on summer !, 
  it 's as hot as hell !, 
  also visit granada [ for la alhambra , an arabic building even better than those that i saw on morocco , it 's amazing ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/alhambra_l%c3%b6wenhof_mit_l%c3%b6wenbrunnen_2014.jpg ), 
  yup , that 's why i do n't like generalitzations . 
  besides , there does n't exist a `` spanish architecture '' as it is . 
  if it were to be one though the most iconic and spanish building at least for me it would be [ sevilla 's `` plaza de espa\u00f1a '' ] ( http://www.escapadarural.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/plaza-espa%c3%b1a-de-sevilla.jpg ) , which the characteristic mix of moresque and classical influences , much less common in catalonia ( we draw from neoclassical and * modernisme * , a local * art noveau * ), 
  i 'm catching up with the books , but as far as i know one of the only cities that has n't been shot is `` oldtown '' ... at as they say , it kinda fits with the city ... who knows, 
  i 'm assuming that the location of the book/series being filmed at girona is n't known then ? 
  also mainland europe : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmolndabnhi, 
  disputes from hispania after all ? 
  napoleon would 've ended with all of this surely !, 
  and you do n't even mention the catalan-spanish * crusade for the truth ? * ... 
  after all the hard work !, 
  well i mean , i know it 's fucking hard to mod this * sac de merda * ... 
  when 40 % of the posts are about immigration it 's obvious that xenophobia will be an issue ( and it is ) . 
  i just hope we can discuss without being overwhelmed by idiots ( if we have n't been already ) . 
  does this mean harsher rules ? 
  maybe , but please keep it democratic !, 
  btw , does this mean that the only solution is for skynet to become some kind of supermod and that 's it ? 
  is n't this like creating a bigger monster to keep the little one in check ? 
  ( not sure , just talking with the info i 've seen ) ... anyway , i 've seen some deep shit happen here, 
   catalonia   `` catalunya '' we * might * be a bit narcissitic, 
  yeah , just give 'm tents and they 'll start magically integrating !, 
  justo como tu, 
   submarine nope , we the catalans got you on that one !, 
  at least if you 're talking about the [ * modern * submarine ! ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/narc%c3%ads_monturiol_i_estarriol ) . 
  and if you 're talking about the first actual submarine , i think two greeks dudes invented it on the xvi century in spain, 
  just did , check the other [ comment !, 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/37z6v6/hey_reurope_lets_share_some_tils_or_other_facts/crrpno2 ), 
  okay , so look at the oxford definition , maybe that 'll convince you :  a nation with its own government , occupying a particular territory : by our statute 's rights , we have :  the statute of autonomy gives the generalitat of catalonia the powers which enable it to carry out the functions of self-government . 
  these can be exclusive , concurrent and shared with the spanish state or executives . 
  so we have a government . 
  and we 're obviously a nation . 
  what ' t your problem there ? 
  country = / = state, 
   and you 're mistaking countries for states again !, 
  though soon you 'll be :p, 
  oh , you might not know catalan then : * pa\u00efsos catalans * is the area of shared catalan culture , so yes , it 's there . 
  and you 're mistaking countries for states again !, 
  are you still looking at the first map maybe ? 
  ahhh you see , that 's the problem , they gave you the wrong map !, 
  that 's a map of * european states !, 
  * not countries !, 
  [ here 's your map !, 
  ] ( http://www.eurominority.eu/documents/cartes/europe-stateless-nations.gif ), 
  yup , problem being , mate ? 
  that 's still pretty decent ... [ compared to the mayor of madrid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sluvumq0q4g ) , our [ ex-president ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ileqoyikho4 ) or even [ our current one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7efoz6otxik ), 
  hahahahaahah why have n't i seen this before, 
  im mine it was the entire desember , well actually , since you began to eat the advent calendar !, 
  no , that was not my reasoning : by phrasing your argument as you did makes it void by just being as spanish as possible , which is what they did . 
  what i said was that we here in catalonia know these guys pretty well , that 's why they are n't getting votes , but one limiting factor in the rest of spain for a conservative party is being originally from catalonia , it is n't the only one . 
  look , you might understand what you 're saying but you do n't know how to properly phrase , people wo n't take you seriously until you do . 
  we have a reason not to respect your state , which the anthem represents . 
  very different from culture . 
  and as this [ nonimportant institution says , it 's freedom of speech , let 's see if madrid cares about it ] ( https://twitter.com/declaracion/status/604656066572468225 ) ... [ oh wait ] ( https://twitter.com/coquegarcia/status/605024171173773313 ), 
  we say `` finde '' though ... languages evolve yo !, 
  whoa , it 's like the island of a very famous catalan novel !, 
  [ this one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cold_skin ), 
   debatable . 
  if you believe in interterritorial solidarity you should be happy with the current system but i think that the problem is that you are simply selfish . 
  we 're one of the most indebt communities , we should be the ones getting the money , not the ones that give it away . 
  besides , are you really that naive ? 
  why do you really think madrid does n't complain , they 're the capital and gain extra funds indirectly trough preferred status .
