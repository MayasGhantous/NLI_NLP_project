  they are n't idiots . 
  also , i do n't trust in data from abc . 
   i think you should focus in your polititians , those who made catalonia to have an incredible debt . 
  giving away 16000m $ per year gave us that debt . 
   catalan nationalists rejected a fiscal system like basque or navarrese in the transition . 
  mr tarradellas , a guy who came from nowhere and negotiated for all of us rejected the fiscal pact . 
  we proposed it again in 2012 * and it was n't us who rejected it * , quit your bullshit . 
   false . 
  [ truth ] ( https://twitter.com/heroisindepes/media )  like having 25 % of hours in school in castillian and 75 % in catalan . 
  [ this is an outright declaration of war to catalan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2wp2vt08cw ) . 
  catalan students outperfom other communities in their knowledge of spanish . 
  this crap is just pp propaganda against catalonia and i did n't even think people belive it until you showed up . 
  spanish absolutely dominates against catalan , have you ever been to catalonia ? 
  my god ...  more autonomy ? 
  the european region with more autonomy and you want more ? 
  in what universe . 
   you have education competence , health , regional police , ... 
  which can be cut and controlled from central gov. 
  at any moment  the only thing you do n't have is your own fisco . 
  which we demanded and was rejected on 2012 . 
   i think that pp made a big mistake with the estatut . 
  at least we can agree on that . 
   i am republican and i try to make my country better , not to destroy it . 
  i am a citizen and i try to make my country better . 
  my country * is n't * spain , it 's catalonia and at this point , the only way to go foward is with independence . 
  madrid is unreliable , treacherous ( they do n't even understand that we want to speak our own language in peace , without meddling ) and uses us time and time again to financiate a decadent state , with no solution for our own problems in sight . 
  we 're done . 
  economic imbalance toward catalonia , catalanophobia , attacks against our language , a total rejection against all the propositions of autonomy and a referendum for catalonia and the humiliation of those that got through ( estatut ) , hate against a king whose father was imposed by a ruthless dictator and who scenifies the spanish state , etc. 
  we have a good damm reason to whistle it . 
  you 'd need one too, 
  we whistled the spanish anthem , which represents the state of spain , not the spaniards . 
  we hate the state , not the people obviously . 
  and it 's quite obvious aswell why we hate it , it 's their own fault that we reached this point . 
  the anthem of spain represents the state of spain . 
  we do n't like the state of spain . 
  we boo the anthem , which in turn boo-es the state of spain ( synonim for the king and its institutions ) . 
  is it so hard ? 
   the speaker was saying the name of the players . 
  sorry , really sorry !, 
  * i could n't hear it !, 
  an anthem that represents the king and the state 's institutions . 
  same thing ( in fact it 's even better , we get a 2x1 ! ), 
  then what 's the problem with whistling ? 
  we do n't like it and we show it . 
  in catalonia we make the kids hit a log in christmas to force it to shit their presents !, 
  [ * while singing a carol ! * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ti%c3%b3_de_nadal ) ... 
  ahhh , there 's nothing like torture to feel the christmas spirit !, 
  we booed the hymn of spain , which represents the king and its institutions yes . 
  so what ? 
   the language which basques and catalans have to use to understand each others . 
  ... a language which was probably being used to introduce the hymn hence the whistles, 
  then why assert this ? 
   someone that really would like to secede from spain would n't go to a match called copa del rey . 
  they 'd go to see the match and boo the king , it 's a 2 for 1 !, 
  a bit of hate toward that idiot and you even get to see bar\u00e7a !, 
  you do n't seem to be clean then , generalizing is fun, 
  people here like football , not the king . 
  that 's why we boo that king and watch the football . 
  it 's called being logical . 
  people got it alright , just count the upvotes, 
  i 'm literally stating what i see in this thread . 
  you could do that too, 
  you 're so damm funny . 
  [ you 'd prefer this , would n't you ? 
  ] ( http://www.alertadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/camp.jpg ), 
  [ alright , what i 'm supposed to look at ? 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/public_debt_percent_gdp_world_map.png ) they have 87.859 % debt to gdp , pretty good . 
  we 're at 31,8 % which is absolutely insustainable if * you do n't control how you spend your money and keep giving it away * . 
  i gave a reasoning , not a half-baked statement, 
  we 're not rich , we 're the most indebt comunity in the state ... 
   all pro-independence parties are not all of catalonia , why would you hide the composition of your own society . 
  we do n't , they 'll go separated but with a common point on their programme about proclaming independence if they have majority . 
   you can assume everyone think like you and will accept all your conditions of how an election that 's supposed to work to reemplace a parliament you want it to declare independence . 
  it 's not democratic . 
  the referendum will be . 
  welp , all the independentist parties have already agreed on it . 
  as i said , we can account for abstention , and we already have a programme for what to do if we win the plebisicite . 
  so yeah . 
  but yes , referendum would be the best option . 
  it 's not like we have n't tried to organise one though ... 
  i just imitated his afirmation and it was sarcastic ( beacause i disagreed with him ) , but i did n't accuse him of being undemocratic, 
   and we both know that those people are the ones that would potentially oppose the secession ... considering not a single pro-independentist would stay in home the day you mobilize to show pro-independentism ... sounds redudant because it 's just logic and common sense . 
  we can easily account for absentism , and be sure that if independentists know that they need to vote , unionists will too ( after all , propaganda does work ) . 
  at least for not losing their seats in the parliment , like in any other election . 
  you 're assuming pretty impossible terms , honestly . 
   and no . 
  even the dictionary says nothing about grabing the election for parliament and making a referendum out of it . 
  please provide a neutral source instead of just say no , because you 're completely wrong . 
  `` plebiscit '' is just another word for referendum , period . 
  dictonaries do n't provide specific definitions for every single day-to-day politics situation . 
  asking about independence in an election * is * a plebsicit , and adjusts for the [ * actual * definition ] ( http://dlc.iec.cat/results.asp?txtentrada=plebiscit&amp;operentrada=0 ) , which was n't the one that you provided . 
  i told him that i found the whistling very democratic . 
  is n't it clear ? 
   very democratic . 
  you ca n't force people to like your state, 
  accusing of what ? 
  you 're the one seeing things, 
   no it has n't . 
  some parties have agreed that they want it like that . 
  that does n't make the autonomical elections act as a referendum .
