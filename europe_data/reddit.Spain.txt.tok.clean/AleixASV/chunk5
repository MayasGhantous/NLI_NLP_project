  ah , true that . 
  my bad , sorry, 
   when is the ref again ? 
  you should contact them , this would be great !, 
  i try to source my opinions and i 'm sorry that i might have ofended you . 
  i 'm not `` bashing spain '' or `` propagandising '' like you say but stating my opinion and i find that calling me a proselitist like that * is * actually ofensive ( also i source , like i said before , which helps when discussing someone who the only reputable opinion provided is a dubious blog used basically by spaniards ) . 
  however , this subreddit is clearly biased to spaniards , at least because they brigade catalan threads when they can . 
  i usually start getting some upvotes here and there while discussing and after returning i 'm not surprised to see that a very similar comment gets -11 votes when said to a spanish while getting upvoted if the discussion is with a foreigner . 
  ** edit : if you want a reliable example to what i mean , look at my comments on this thread . 
  this very comment by the way has been changing from -1 to 3 votes all afternoon . 
  well , i could send sources and information and translate headlines and parts of the text accurately from catalan and spanish . 
  most of the sources * are * in catalan and some in spanish and english , though the ones in english are n't really accurate at all so i 'd say this presents a problem compared to the scottish referendum . 
  i could debate for a while aswell , tough as i said , i 'm afraid that lately i do n't have much free time, 
  catalonia is a wonder catalonia is a wonder only because how fucked up enonomically it is, 
  yeah and also the fact that people do n't have the time to reply accutaretly enough with the short timespan of a live chat . 
  it can work , but it will be very general and not that in-depth , more informative for foreigners than anything, 
  oh , then i 'm eager to contribute !, 
  though the swiftness of it all could become a problem when giving sources and actual facts ... 
  well i was n't there on the scottish one , but i could speak a bit for the independentist part ... 
  i 've been doing it and suffering spanish downvotes for months now in this subrredit !, 
  though i do n't quite know how this works and i 'm a bit busy at the moment so it my time is very limited, 
  that 's the mentality that i will never understand ... how can you honestly think that ? 
  the only use that i could see with that is as a shield of sorts against the right of the people to vote, 
  so , in other words : impossible, 
  huh . 
  so you do belive that a 2/3 majority in both the congress and the senate can be convinced in the first place to think like you do , nevermind all the crap that goes after that ? 
  also , a consultation ** is ** constitutional , which is something that everyone in madrid has magically forgotten , the only problem is their overzealous interpretation , so they have a `` fact '' to grasp on, 
  also here , we 've got a cartel running the market and nobody does anything about it, 
  ... [ go read a bit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_the_crown_of_aragon ), 
  i 'd say 15000m $ a year is something also tangible to grasp on, 
  the flag of the counts of barcelona was adopted to be the flag of the kings of aragon , * because the first became the later * , so our flag has always been here , in catalonia , do n't worry, 
  sorry , but you 're wrong . 
  before that flag being the standard for the * kings * of aragon , it was the flag of the * counts * of barcelona , which would become rulers of aragon . 
  so it * is * the flag of catalonia and so it was before ruling all over the aragonese crown, 
  we 'll use the senyera , the ordinary one . 
  the estelada is only to show support from independence !, 
   would you support the route of pushing for constitutional reform to later allow for a legal referendum ? 
  yes , absolutely . 
  this , hiding behind an impossible `` change of the constitution '' is one of the excuses that the unionists use . 
  because you know it 's impossible to change , you all think you 'll be safe behind that ( from another comment ) :  a majority of 2/3 of both the congress and senate has to agree to change it . 
  ( once there is such majority and the changes have been proposed , there has to be a referendum across the whole country and people will vote , once the vote ends the cameras s have to resign and there have to be new elections , then the new government process with the changes ( if the people voted yes in the referendum ) . 
  do you really think a piece of paper that gathers its power * from the people who give it to that * is able to stop that same people if they choose * not to give it power * ? 
  it 's ridicoulous and absolutely anti-democrathic, 
  so basically , it 's impossible, 
   i 'm curious , how do spaniards justify stopping catalonians from exercising their right to self-determination ? 
  by a close minded reading of their sacrosanct constitution that can only be changed when merkel tells them to . 
  i 'm not joking by the way . 
   are the catalonians serious about calling for a referendum in six weeks ' time ? 
  because that 's certainly not adequate time to ensure a free and fair election . 
  we 've been preparing for years , there has been plenty of time and we 're tired of waiting, 
   first , 5-10 % does n't seem that much 15000m $ a year . 
   that much, 
  yes , solving issues like that will get you very far, 
  yes , there are other regions in the world that transfer resources . 
  but there is n't * any * that does it to the extent of catalonia ( we 're transfering around the 8-9 % while the next is 4,5 % ), 
  recent polls put independence at 58 % , so we 'll win . 
  the problem is with the participation , probably the `` no '' voters will boycott and do n't vote, 
  though if we do win , it 's pretty obvious what will happen next, 
  so do i , let 's get out of this state !, 
  yeah , the eu is probably the best and most affordable option , also giving me a title which i hope lets me work in the whole continent . 
  maybe i could get an extension to basically also work in the us , kinda like you said ? 
  though maybe scholarships and a good exchange program can solve this issue ( erasmus , the main eu one at least , and an american one would be even better ) . 
  and yeah , here people * never ever * move away when going to universisty if you have one close , they usually go abroad only in exchange programms , which is good , but it is n't the full 100 % live by your own experience that i movies tell me that is typical from america ... also now that you mentioned ... maybe you did ... 
  i guess i was stunned from all the `` newyorkess '' of everything ... shit happens i guess :p ... but really , we do n't have nothing even close to shakeshack burgerwise here !, 
  and that was fastfood ? 
  i went to a stakehouse ... to eat a gigantic tbone ( that was the name ... 
  i think ) which had at least 9 customizable ways in which it could be made , which also blew my mind ( here is raw , medium and done and thank the cook if he follows it ) ... by the way , i mentioned woolthworth because you did !, 
  thanks , really , it was amazing !, 
  the man who built it was truly megalomany in human form ... 
  but hey , i really hope to come back and try to see all the stuff i can , one way or the other !, 
  ( by the way ... you guys * do * have our cloisters , give'em back to us ! ), 
   this is katz 's menu : http://katzsdelicatessen.com/menus/ yup , that 's delicious !, 
  i have n't planned everything ( i need to do plenty of research on this yet !, 
  ) , but time and money are constraints : i also do n't know about how the permits work when studying directly abroad without an exchange program if that 's what you mean ( by that , that she skipped her local uni and went directly to columbia , which being an american uni has also fame here for being very expensive ) . 
  i 'd love to do so anyway , but if that were n't the case there are n't any positive to moving to another spanish architecture university : the one in barcelona is one of the best , thankfully !, 
  though maybe i 'd like to go to england or germany , both of those countries have plenty of prestige and different views on how architecture should be taught . 
   i suppose an exception would be chipotle . 
  huh ... another thing that i did n't try ... shakeshack was awesome by the way , never tasted a burger like that here !, 
   if you got thick pizza , you probably ordered a sicilian slice . 
  this is what ny thin crust looks like : http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ujpbm8xjio8/thbopnisuei/aaaaaaaaah0/9wydqbsbaee/s1600/dscn1308.jpg this is reason enough for me to go there . 
  any reccomendations on places for specifically pizza ? 
  i found them hard to come by , probably because of the routes that i took and that i was alawys looking up ... also , i * did * go to the woolworth , ate a burrito as big as my head ( we do * not * have mexican food on spain , even less so in catalonia ) , went to a chinese restaurant ( joe 's shangai ) recommended by a scott that i met on my flight there which was amazing and saw why japanese restaurants there are way different than the ones here ( basically the rations and the taste of them are doubled ! ), 
   yeah , i ca n't believe all the construction going on . 
  all the buildings are for billionaires , but at least they employ people to build them . 
  and * who * will hopefully design them ? 
  well could be very much me ... 
  i 'm * very * ... stubborn, 
   fuck dude !, 
  i did n't tell you to go to katz 's ? 
  ugh , my apologies . 
  the pastrami there is soooooooooooooo good . 
  what pizza did you get ? 
  huh . 
  weirdly enough , i wanted to go get pizza but i was n't alone and had to go to eat something quick in one of these big take away restaurants ( protip . 
  do n't do it , it gave me the shits ... thanfully it was the next-to-the last day so i did n't miss much due to that ) so we could go to times square . 
  alright , that place gets much hate , but for an european like me it was worth all trouble . 
  really now , it was pretty amazing , at least seeing it for a while . 
  i did get a take away one once , it was ** extremely ** think , like , it was insane !, 
  i guess that got me an idea of how pizzas work here ? 
   that is awesome you had a great time .
