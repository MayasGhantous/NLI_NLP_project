  yep . 
  i do n't care about the lives of the bourgeois, 
  la generalitat owes money to every single townhall , this is n't news exactly , she 's meeting with mas for the propaganda , so ... in what way is it related exactly ? 
  the fact that madrid has been spending less and less money each year on catalonia ( we have a deficit of around 16.000 m $ ) can tell you something of where the money 's at . 
  i still do n't see how that 's related to the subsidies of f1, 
  do n't even know who that guy is , but i wo n't renounce to an almost centenary tradition of catalan motorsports beacause a dumb politician thought that she could gather a few votes with cheap demagogy, 
  ... ok , so you first state this :  of the end of a corrupt network of politicians that use blackmailing to ask for more money to the central government . 
  and then this  by central government you mean former catalan pm jordi pujol ? 
  on a thread about ada colau ? 
  is maybe your name federico jim\u00e9nez los santos ? 
  so much demagogy at the same time is pretty hard to pull off, 
  first of all , the ones who drain someone is the central gov to catalonia ( or else we would n't be demanding independence ... duh ) and you must really buy into someones lies pretty hard to say what you said but anyway , how 's that relevant to this ? 
  of what ? 
  ... i do n't even live in barcelona , why would i care ? 
  ... that 's why i said `` probably '', 
   the subsidies are probably cheaper access to the course and accomodations i 'm pretty sure that they do pay to the government for that . 
  investments that are clearly profitable such as this must be made, 
   was valencia 's grand prix also hugely beneficial ? 
  nope , that 's why it only ran for a few years . 
  the main difference here is a more or less 50 year tradition vs fabra 's desires . 
  it is obviously profitable or else they would n't organize it , we 're in deep economical shit here, 
  they are indirect profits , to the people living there and so on , not to the fia itself . 
  the subsidies are probably cheaper access to the course and accomodations, 
  the government said that the gross profits of organizing the even are ten times higher than the subsidies . 
  comparing schools meal lunch subsidies ( which she did ) to that is pure demagogy and i do n't even think that she has the competences to decide on these things ... 
  anyway , these claims does n't surprise me in the least , it 's trough populism that she got into the town hall, 
  yeah anyway , derrailing conversations with demagogy sure is fun . 
  have a nice day, 
  ... do you know what are we even talking about ? 
  the 2006 referendum , not the 9n consultation !, 
  that one it was an * unofficial * referendum , and yet they even had computer checked id matching to avoid double voting !, 
  derrailing conversations is good when cornered eh ? 
  anyway , he can do wathever he wants , all in all , the consultation was backed by * voluteers * , and he was one !, 
  [ enjoy ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ca&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ca&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fca.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2frefer%25c3%25a8ndum_estatutari_a_catalunya_de_2006&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ), 
  by the way , confirmation bias is a thing ... 
  [ actually it was 50 % ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalonian_constitutional_referendum,_2006 ) . 
  ever wondered why ? 
  ** beacause we already had to make huge concessions and even nationalist parties rallied against it ** . 
  what you 're talking about is that a third of the electorate * voted for it * , which as i said , is pretty easy to explain, 
  well , the generalized opinion among independentists is that els bous embolats * are * animal cruelty and that the government has n't done anything about it beacause they would lose the southern votes . 
  i assume you probably talked with these southerners in question then ( though there 's crazy people everywhere ) . 
  there 's also obviously the `` toro '' as an spanish icon , which was one of the main points of the prohibition but not the only one by any means, 
  eh , the tripartit spent half of their reign doing nothing , so small wonder, 
  ** absolutely false ** . 
  it 's just a tale that conservatives tell themselves to critizise any descentralist advance in catalonia or the basque country . 
  the autonomous comminities system is a pure joke and a drain to the treasury . 
  do you want to hear the magical tale of the renovation of our autonomous status ? 
  ( promised by the spanish president , voted in our parliment , sent and cut to madrid , voted again in favour in our parliment and referendum , sent again and cut to madrid , finally approved , when all seemed ok it was sent to the constitutional tribunal that cut it even further , ending with a booklet than a set of laws ) . 
  ever wondered why we want to be independent ? 
  in spain , if the powerful will it , a couple of judges hold more power than : the spanish parliment , the catalan parliment and the entire population of catalonia that voted in a referendum . 
  keep in mind though , this is just a little example ... 
  ever wondered why we want to be independent ? 
  we have even banned it here , from a popular signature recollection !, 
  that is since : it 's not part of our culture , we do n't care about it ( it was n't even profitable ) , it 's basically glorified animal torture . 
  there are still some `` soft '' practices in southern catalonia that have n't been prohibited yet , but we 're working on it . 
  * shhhh you 're breaking the circlejerk *, 
  but that 's not his problem , rather what people value or not . 
  gaud\u00ed mania has a reason to exist , but if you are n't also ready to check out other buildings why even bother come here ? 
  the cases are not comparable , here language is strongly associated with culture, 
  i absolutely love that movie !, 
  [ especially when this bad boy is playing ... wo n't spoil why though ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd-4vkmb2ke ), 
  it sounds amazing !, 
  no problem , do n't worry, 
   no better architecture , than european architecture . 
  he said that , though, 
  [ you might like then this `` cartoixa '' - like a monastery - , the first and biggest of the penninsula , where the aragonese kings retired to rest and meditate , now abandoned : scala dei ] ( http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2049/2135237445_2fcf300841_b.jpg ), 
  nope , op ( the guy who initiated the comment chain ) said that . 
  i do n't have favourites in architecture , they all interest me, 
  yup , i mean , [ la sainte chapelle ] ( http://www.euroscope.fr/images/produits/big/82/st_chapelle_vitraux.jpg ) in paris is amazing , though op did state that european architecture is `` the best '' . 
  personally i hold no favourites , though being from barcelona myself , i had the opportunity to admire gaud\u00ed 's works as much as i want and let me tell you , he 's * not * overrated, 
  that does n't mean it 's the best though ... [ this is the borobudur temple , for example , in indonesia ] ( http://travelingdictionary.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/indonesia_travel_borobudur.jpg ) , [ built centuries before any gothic cathedral ] ( http://arounddeglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/borobudur-temple-oldest-buddha-monument-in-central-java_1.jpg ), 
  i mean , that 's pretty disputable to some extend : once you reach the renaissance architecture you 're mostly right though, 
  ... since ? 
  she 's representing russia and she chose to do that , she may not be a hypocrite directly but her country absolutely is , so she 's one by omisison, 
   well , not from the singer as such . 
  she probably does n't believe her government is even involved in the violence in ukraine . 
  that she does n't belive in it happening wo n't make it go away, 
  all dat hypocrisy, 
  the kind of nationalists that deny it beacause they 've got an army and a state , yeah , `` post-nationalists '' ... you just need to look them up a bit to see how false they are, 
  she just has :d !, 
  regional parties , such as comprom\u00eds , have dethroned pp both in val\u00e8ncia 's autonomic government and townhall , something that has n't happened for decades , the same for balears , though not so clearly , pp still has a foothold there, 
  yeah sorry , maybe i was n't that clear : he asked about why aragon , val\u00e8ncia and balears do n't seem to have a distinct identity from the rest of spain , whereas catalonia , also a region in the old aragonese kingdom does . 
  i told him that while catalonia retained their identity , the other regions diluted with spain 's , especially true in the case of aragon , though that is beggining to change in the case of val\u00e8ncia and balears , and for better in my opinion , since in their case the `` change '' went from pp to a regional party and i honestly think that that can only bring good . 
   you make it sound like they have no identity anymore . 
  because i was referring to the first comment , in which op put the old kingdom of aragon as a whole , and wondered why only catalonia remained with a distinct notion of themselves . 
  you are assuming things , i told him that no , the notion of an `` aragonese '' identity is much more diluted than the one of a catalan . 
   so you think that their `` lost '' identity is a bad thing , cause their starting to change ... 
  yes , but it is n't something linked to the previous statement : i 'm glad they are getting rid of pp there , are n't you ? 
  that 's something that i 'll never understand about some independentists , being one myself . 
  she 's free to say whatever she wants and if she 's not a nationalist i wo n't hate her for that ... 
  not for that no , she 's free to say whatever she wants . 
  however , her campain has been full of insults toward other parties , financiated by the very banks ( sabadell ) that she critizises , published by the media `` of the casta '' and to top it all off , [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en2pfkxbblc ), 
  nope you 're wrong and assuming things , i just said that they lost their previous aragonese identity . 
  that 's not bad or good , just a fact, 
  i dunno how she 'll do and if we 're fucked or not , but this 'll be interesting . 
  i personally do n't like her but that does n't mean that she ca n't do good to the city, 
   i 'm having a hard time not taking that as an insult . 
  you can retain your identity while being part of something bigger , as the spain or the eu ... how many people speak aragonese there anymore ? 
  true , they 've got their regional customs , but nothing more than a distinguising trait . 
  anyway , i see that labeling as a `` troll '' anyone who does n't agree with you is a common standard .
