  i wo n't do the same to spaniards , but i 'll do it to you : you know perfectly well that , compared to catalonia , aragon 's identity is pretty much nonexistant, 
  they 've lost their identity pretty much , all of those regions , especially aragon , are really eroded and feuds either from pp or psoe . 
  thankfully it 's starting to change , at least in val\u00e8ncia and balears, 
  not trying to be rude but that 's a false dichotomy , we can focus on both and in fact have been doing since the beggining . 
  the whole independence thing is aimed at solved these urgent issues, 
  they 're a madrid based party , and very much a centralist - not giving power to regional factions - one ( even more than psoe , the preexisting leftists big party ) , so that could explain it . 
  at least for what i know here in catalonia , they do n't even have traction . 
  probably the only exception is barcelona , which sounds good at a first glance , but that 's only beacause they have allied with a bunch of leftists parties ( old an new , greens , moderates and independentists ) so that dilutes any hope of influence that they could get . 
  i honestly think that their failure is the same as any other big spanish party commited before them : they follow the `` cafe para todos '' ideology , where they do n't ackowledge any stance on independentism , avoid the topic and/or treat it as something secundary , displaying their name as podemos/podem and being a party controlled directly from madrid , giving zero power to local and autonomic factions ( something that we absolutely do not like ) . 
  for many , they come as foreigners , and they prefer local leftist parties such as cup , or voting the traditional ones , such as iniciativa ( the biggest one in the alliance with them in barcelona , which explains their good results ), 
  [ let 's keep the party going !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lipjx2i3hui ) [ and a bit more apm , just to keep it on theme !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukf4hjrbcyq ) lo de val\u00e8ncia ( trending worldwide ) xavals , \u00e9s espectacular, 
  yup , towns and cities need to focus on themselves . 
  where i live there has n't been a single openly independentist party elected , but i could n't care less . 
  while i do not like ada , she admitted to voting for independence in the 9n referendum , but it 's a fact that her campaign has n't mentioned it that much . 
  besides , interesting but not surprising to see that podemos/podem has n't got any traction at all in the whole catalonia , so much that they had to integrate themselves into coalitions involving even old parties such as iniciativa ( as is the case with barcelona ), 
  i mean , you guys have that mega-dam . 
  that 's pretty cool, 
  holy shit , this is really brutal . 
  though i guess sadly not suprising ... 
  wow , do you guys get to go at yurovision alone ( but get no points ) ? 
  or do you mean that if you were to be independent you 'd get points from ireland and viceversa ? 
  yup , when andorra comes up i start saying in my head `` speeeein twelve pointss '', 
  berlin is amazing , belive me , and i 've traveled germany to some extend . 
  either you love it or hate it , but the history and culture make it wonderful, 
  [ just a little example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en2pfkxbblc ), 
  well yeah , he 's pure crap , but at least we know that !, 
  ada for now has showed to be a liar and a populist , i do n't know what she will do to this city or if she 's even able to rule it . 
  probably the henchmen that used to do it before of iniciativa ( also why she does n't want to be seen associated with them even if she is ) will come back and take their old places , and god help us getting rid of those corrupt fucks, 
  yup . 
  if you see their adds , they just come up with hashtag campaings that do n't mean anything ( #runrun ) and fall to the same indefinition that other parties before them practise . 
  i hate to say it , beacause the current mayor is pretty bad and i wanted an alternative , but they 're pretty much populists, 
  ada 's probably the most fake politician to ever come up in elections : she 's against banks but not the ones who give her loans ( she 's being financed by la caixa and sabadell by the way ) , she says she 's not personalistst but all the posters have is her face , she says she does n't represent icv even if she goes to elections , debates and has adds on tv thanks to them ... there 's a big long list of this crap ... and she has n't even been elected yet . 
  i hope people realize what they 're doing before it 's too late . 
  it 's crashed in spain . 
  ( no but seriously , how long does it take to determine what happened ? 
  and why are n't they stopping test flights if they say it was due to a technical error ? ), 
  well well well ... 
  if i ca n't * add * , just * redraw * ... andorra would get a lot bigger , you know ? 
   haha , well , until catalunya is official , i 'll stick with what was written on my plane ticket  . 
  it 's alright anyway . 
  people here refer it to catalonia but not beacause we want to spite the spaniards , but just beacause it 's what we know it as . 
   he only really crowded places were gaudi 's cathedral and some of the other buildings designed by him , the ones in the gaudi park . 
  but that was to be expected . 
  ( and these were the things i liked the least of the entire trip ) oooooooh that 's disastrous !, 
  really , you * need * to come back , maybe in autum or spring , it 's true , there 's tourists at any time of the year , but gaud\u00ed 's shit is amazing no matter what !, 
  definitely something that , at least for me , is n't overrated ( maybe beacause i 've seen it with far less people ? 
  you should give it a chance anyway ) . 
  and yeah , the thing that most people do n't realize about barcelona is that is cramped as hell , to the point that you can just walk from district to distric . 
  it 's big , * but * you get to see a lot of things while touring , and every single area has their own `` flair '' , giving it much more deph than tourists even realize . 
  i flew into berna 's airport in a plane with a propeller ( my first time with such a plane ) . 
  that plus the tiny airport with only one runway on sight made me realize that maybe building bigass airports every 50km maybe is n't the best choice, 
   ** spain . 
  ** you want to piss us off do n't you ? 
  ahhhh ca n't be mad , you liked out city !, 
  interesting though : i thought that as overcrowded as barcelona is with tourists , people would find it pretty stressful, 
  no problem , too much free time that i should 've spent studying :p, 
  i may be biased beacause i travel quite a lot there , but all the emporanese towns are amazing . 
  especially [ cadaqu\u00e8s ] ( https://static.panoramio.com.storage.googleapis.com/photos/original/8843572.jpg ) , [ calella de palafrugell ] ( http://cdn.traveler.es/uploads/images/thumbs/201321/calella_de_palafrugell_girona_espana_608_1200x800.jpg ) and chanding the region from empord\u00e0 to southern catalonia , [ montblanc ] ( http://www.montblancentitats.cat/bttmontblanc/sites/www.montblancentitats.cat.bttmontblanc/files/u3/montblanc.jpg ), 
  for classical rock we do have some ... we had quite the scene but sadly it has diluted , diversifying the genres . 
  i know some groups , like `` sopa de cabra '' , `` els pets '' ( literally the farts ) , `` lax 'n' busto '' , `` gossos '' , and some more but they are quite old already . 
  nevertheless , they still got following and i found this playlist on youtube which is basically a mix of all of [ the groups ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzueyn8abho&amp;list=pl77e56aded5a9ae55 ) . 
  they 're the big classics which everyone adores but are n't followed anymore . 
  and these three are the ones trending right now : you could say ( though it 's hard to classificate ) that they 're : ska , pop-rock , and pop-folk [ txarango - & gt ; this is their 2nd album : som riu ( - we are river/smile - if you remove the space - in catalan ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3pifjjtfcs&amp;amp;list=ple6gvanvoudc9y0v8dlhvco-atmoxu0yw ) free to download ( as are all two of their albums - their first is called `` benvinguts al llarg viatge '' , `` welcome to the long journey '' if you want to search it ) [ here ] ( http://txarango.com/descarregues/?lang=en ) . 
  it 's mostly ska with rock and folk [ els amics de les arts : these guys are a weird bunch . 
  they began with songs that tried to not be the usual `` pop '' though nowadays they are leaning closer and closer to that , even if they can get weird sometimes still . 
  this is one of my favourites , monsieur cousteau , from `` especies per catalogar '' , where a guy wants to live the adventures of the old documentaries that a famous guy named costeau made exploring the oceans ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_cck4ylz58&amp;amp;index=3&amp;amp;list=pl4df2b6d36b13d2b4 ) . 
  they 've got some albums : castafiore cabaret , bed & amp ; breakfast , esp\u00e8cies per catalogar , nom\u00e9s d'entrar hi ha sempre el dinosaure . 
  and they range from weirdest to most normal , which coincidentally as i said is also the chronological order of publication . 
  they 're the most famous of all groups now and they 've been for a few years . 
  i do n't dig their latest disc that much , but older ones are quite good . 
  this is the song that made them famous , `` al mar '' , `` to the sea '' , though their songs are all quite varied , if you do n't like that one try to give them a second chance :p ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjwlxz4wdqu&amp;amp;list=pl2c6e8b0eb86dae14&amp;amp;index=8 ) . 
  anyway , as you probably know , you just need to type the name of the group and the album in youtube to find a full playlist , and with the exception of txarango which they give always all of their albums for free [ and have amazing concerts - i was there ! - ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ggyfzmucqm ) , the others need a bit of ye ' old pirating to be accessed . 
  also to find lyrics , i would n't be surprised to find that some of them are already translated , but if you have any trouble finding translations or understanding something let me now . 
  enjoy !, 
  and well , this year i 'm going to scotland on summer but i 'll keep it in mind , thank you !, 
  i think i have a friend who 's going to ireland but knowing her she has already planned everything out and god help you if you try to help her do anything !, 
  thank you !, 
  you could try going to seriespepito dot to ( it 's an sketchy to say the least page - yaaaar mateys ! - where all the spaniards - and catalans ... 
  i know i do - get their tv shows from , since there 's no netflix here ) and watch series with spanish ( or even sometimes catalan ) original english , spanish subtitles or dubs on , which is how i mostly learnt english !, 
  also , la vanguardia is ... well ... it 's not the worst , but it 's the most conservative paper in catalan . 
  for catalan papers there 's [ ara - means `` now '' - ] ( http://www.ara.cat/ ) , which even has a version in english , [ this one ] ( http://www.ara.cat/en ) , or [ el punt avui ] ( http://www.elpuntavui.cat/barcelona/nacional.html ) . 
  ara is kinda around center-left or where converg\u00e8ncia ( the not so conservative part of ciu , the ruling party : the other part is uni\u00f3 , which is more conservative and has la vangu\u00e0rdia as their stronghold , and one of the few papers from catalonia against independence ) , whereas el punt avui is kinda meh , read in rural areas and towns . 
  oh and btw , our national news [ 324 ] ( http://www.ccma.cat/324/ ) is kinda decent , even if everyone loves to hate on them . 
  and remember , if you put a link of a page on google translator it will do its magic for you . 
  you could also try music , depending on your tastes i can send you some groups in catalan, 
   la vanguardia oh , they 're a funny bunch friends are n't they :p, 
  yeah yeah absolutely , i think the main reason a foreginer should learn catalan ( apart from learning for learning 's sake ) would be if he/she lives in catalonia , though if you know good spanish and a bit of catalan you could ask them to speak to you with it and learn a bit , beacause both are romance languages they 're pretty similar, 
  yup , but if you want to learn spanish just ask us , do n't be confused by the number of signs and things in catalan , we all know spanish aswell, 
  belive me , they all knew spanish ... we the catalans have this `` sad '' idea ( from the repression of catalan in the francoist years ) that we need to accomodate to the other 's language . 
  usually it goes like this : a catalan speaker says something in catalan ( or sometimes directly in spanish ) to a spanish speaker , the latter responds in spanish and the conversation from that point onwards will be in spanish . 
  the same happens with english : if a tourist comes to us speaking broken spanish most will try to accomodate them in english . 
  you can though , tell us to speak in spanish because you want to learn the language and we 'll switch sin problema . 
  older people though still do n't know english sadly , and speak french as a foreign language instead, 
  yeah , well , i recently traveled to nyc and talked to people there . 
  what i got from people talking about my city is that they did n't like it `` beacause they could n't practise their spanish '' : it turns out that , since most people here know their english , they instinctibly switch to it , whereas in more rural areas they have to stick to broken english and spanish . 
  ( spain has had a serious problem with this due to the dictatorship enforcing french and not english to be taught in school ) still , even if some people might tell you that we do n't like speaking in spanish and prefer catalan this is absolutely false , we have no problem switching languages if need be, 
  not at all !, 
  actually ( i live in barcelona ) , we probably try to accomodate to any tourist that asks us for help in english , but we also enjoy helping them learn spanish ( even if this would n't necessairly be the best city to learn that particular language ),
