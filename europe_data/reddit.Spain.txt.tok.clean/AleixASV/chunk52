  yep . 
  i like walking around pla\u00e7a sant jaume and those areas ( barri g\u00f2tic i guess , though that is n't a real place , it 's made up for the tourists ) and it 's pretty rare that i actually hear someone speaking catalan/spanish . 
  at least they do n't mistake me for a guiri and harass me with `` special tours '', 
  yeah !, 
  donosti for example was a great city to visit . 
  though i think it does have it 's fair share of tourists ... comparing it to barcelona would be like paris and marseilles , we 've got lots of inertia going on in our favour here ( for good and bad , tourists can be annoying ), 
  yup , have one at 15m walking ... though the meatballs that one man sold outside vasa 's museum were just out of this world, 
  i thought stockholm was cool ... [ we 've got this ] ( http://estaticos.elperiodico.com/resources/jpg/0/6/1360698585460.jpg ) while you guys [ have this ] ( http://ulkotours.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/stockholm-museum-vasa.jpg ) . 
  also holy shit those meatballs, 
   hell even some people outside of our borders actually think catalonia is super different from spain and is a completely different - and/or especially unrelated - nation , or that there 's no catalans that feel just as spaniards aswell . 
  which is crazy wrong too , of course . 
  mediterranean people are all similar but different aswell . 
  you know , i have met both basques and andalusians and they really did n't have that much in common considering they live in the same country . 
  there 's no such thing as `` he 's like x beacause he 's catalan , or he 's y beacause he 's spanish '' , but also you ca n't just bunch us in the same sack beacause we share the same state . 
  you wo n't be able to force to be spaniards , that 'll never happen . 
  that does n't mean that we can speak spanish , enjoy spanish cousine and travel around in spain . 
  spain is a great country , but is it so difficult to understand that , as great as spain is , a lot of us are not a part of it ? 
  catalonia is a nation , there 's not that much people , even in spain , that deny that . 
  and we 've arrived at a point that we 're trying to break free . 
  i think it 's a bit late for these kind of comments . 
  yeah , there 's of course catalans who also feel spanish , no one denied that . 
  but to think that even reached this moment and people still think this makes me think that maybe we 're not understood in the rest of spain . 
  had to make a comment , sorry , i know you do n't like independentist trolls :p, 
  ... and you make us have to leave and visit other countries !, 
  that 's what we get for having good looking buildings ... damm ( not complaining though , i love architecture ), 
   their opressed autonomous communities !, 
  ... did i heard opressed ? 
  * halp halp i 'm being opressed * . 
  no but seriously , i suspect barcelona has had something to do with this tourism thing ... we 're full of ~ ~ guiris ~ ~ tourists !, 
  and spain of course has tons of shit to offer , i 've traveled the country quite a bit and never saw such variety in such a small amount of land, 
  * nope * , i did n't link la gaceta . 
  i linked a [ foto of a tweet ] ( http://www.gaceta.es/sites/default/files/styles/668x300/public/payo_cura_tweet_2.jpg?itok=zbf5wzf2 ) hosted in their servers . 
  that has absolutely nothing to do with anything they 've ever wrote . 
  you want the actual tweet ? 
  [ google searching ai n't that hard , mate ] ( https://twitter.com/colonos_cs/status/483317124002492416 ) . 
  ( and btw , i also linked that twitter account , which summarises a bit the happy incidents of the party ), 
  you just asumed that , but anyway : as you can see , i 'm not a politologist/sociologist , so you ca n't expect 1rs hand sourcing ( sadly , is n't it ? ) . 
  you 're putting too much expectation behind your common redditor * or * demanding too much from someone you know ca n't deliver in a professsional level . 
  there 's nothing wrong with google . 
  and anyway that 's irrelevant : that does n't make what i provided fake like he claimed ( and did n't back up ) or bullshitty . 
  and since he did n't prove it and it seems like you also do n't like it , care to disprove it ? 
  * facts are facts , after all *, 
  by that i meant of course the downvoting . 
  but yeah , remember that people who use res will keep your downvotes/upvotes registered , so while it might have a net positive effect , i do n't expect it to be that noticeable, 
  [ he 's referring to this comment chain , where he ignored me when i told him that i wanted him to prove me wrong in the links i had provided ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/355vjx/official_spanish_forecasts_podemos_loses_7_and/cr1fcxg?context=10000 ) . 
  plus then , [ on this comment chain he literally said : `` i refuse to contradict bullshit '' , even though he did n't even back any of his claims at all ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/355vjx/official_spanish_forecasts_podemos_loses_7_and/cr1ec8i?context=10000 ) . 
  classy spanish freedomfighters though , downvoted me and / u/mate77 to hell and back because apparently we 're trolls ( parent comment in this same chain ) since we source our claims and apparently they do n't like this `` dissenting opinions '' thingy , harassing poor / u/mate77 here to the point of him having to even remove his flair to discuss . 
  walk along , nothing weird to see here , / r/europe, 
  ... oh really ? 
  so i provide sources and i 'm called a troll , but someone who says literally this :  i refuse to contradict bullshit . 
  when i told him to source his shit * and * after saying that what i brought out was `` fake '' is just your common day-to-day / r/europe redditor ... keep it classy inded, 
  that 's the main reason why i do n't like them : they do n't propose anything at all , just try to steal votes from here and there with high exposure in prime time and propaganda . 
  it 's pretty depressing that it works ... 
  i do n't want to be a cynic , but when i first saw them start with the interviews and all i sadly already assumed it would , this country has a strange love with these kind of things, 
  yup , i 'd like to hope that he would , but really ... 
  he 's just trying to derrail the conversation . 
  yeah , gives away that they 're not truly leftist as they claim though . 
  do you think they say it to lessen the guilt from ex psoe voters maybe ? 
   well , i have to say that here he is damn right : los toros no , pero s\u00ed quieren convertir en fiesta el ` toro embolao ' y no hay m\u00e1s que verlo para saber que el sufrimiento del animal es el mismo '' `` hay que diferenciar el debate de la protecci\u00f3n de animales del debate identitario '' they would be right if they opposed the toros . 
  they do n't . 
  and besides , it 's obvious that el toro embolat only exists still beacause parties would lose votes if it were to be prohibited , we all here know that , it 's not like ciudadanos are the only ones that said it, 
   i read everything , though , with you it 's hard , as you are editing like crazy man . 
  i 'm not an english native speaker , i like to change grammar . 
   the fact is , they have been growing since the first election , and i guess for you is just cosy to believe there 's a `` contubernio '' promoting them against you ( personally you ) . 
  paranoia , conspiracy theories , nationalism . 
  all fits . 
  [ they 're the pink ones . 
  i 'll give it to you , they grew a bit on 2012 ... but really , * two elections * and do n't even reach 10 % ] ( http://lh4.ggpht.com/-6erlyf5d9ku/uni1_mrtugi/aaaaaaaacfs/og_z8k1ryyg/evolvot.png ) it 's pretty pathetic . 
  also , you still have n't proven/are ignoring all that i left before abour your dear party . 
  [ maybe you should watch this . 
  it has an over the top editing but the facts are still there ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-jlz5frt88 ), 
   wonder why they just recently boombed ? 
  did you read this maybe ? 
  we 're not talking about that , we 're talking about how ciudadanos insults people from catalunya . 
  you know , independentists are catalans too ( how surprising ), 
  i 'm not the one who links fakes , comedy and forgeries as an example ... you 're free to prove me wrong ( pretty hard , considering it 's real ) . 
  you have n't , so i assume you 're trolling . 
  cya  what do you mean ? 
  you ? 
  as in ... ? 
  i take c 's seriously , i 'm rooting for them . 
  oh dear , they 've had 10 years free to annoy us in the parliment and done nothing , * no one * belives in them anymore . 
  wonder why they just recently boombed ? 
  it 's just all fake tv prime time and propaganda, 
  hahahahaha , you 're assuming that we take them seriously !, 
   i hope one day you are able to wake up from your nationalist nightmare , freedom feels so good . 
  you 're trolling , right ? 
  ... are you even suggesting that they are n't ? 
  [ really ?

  funny how an anticatalanist party is referred to with their catalan name in the rest of spain : [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sow-44cvfwk ), 
  idependence for catalonia immigrants are people with their rights diferent opinions are good, 
  yes , but you 're assuming that the people are undeducated and the country is big . 
  democracy works best when kept small and controlled ( transparent ) and the voters are informed . 
  in that case , i think they can be trusted to make decisions , maybe not all of them or even the majority , but at least a good chunk . 
  the problem is that it 's up to the state to turn the populace into a more responsible one ( reducing poverty , equal chances and education , etc. ) . 
  that 's i think the greatest struggle that democracy has .
