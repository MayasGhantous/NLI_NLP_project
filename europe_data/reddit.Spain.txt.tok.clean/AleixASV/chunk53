  democracy is by definition flawed , beacause it 's power resides in people , which are flawed as well , and the only way to make it better is to eliminate the intermediaries ( who account for most of the problems ) and make it as direct as possible, 
  is it better than the korea of today ( which is a democracy ) ? 
  i really doubt it, 
  i think so, 
  any more examples ? 
  1 case does n't make it a fact , and i can think of a pretty good bunch of democracies that all have been better than his regime, 
  maybe different influences when the vernacular language was created ? 
  though catalan is * really * close to italian , maybe to the northern dialects, 
  hmmm , i found it kinda hard , like i got some words and context but not that much, 
  and there 's where the magic happens !, 
  that 's why i actually like seeing poor countries participate , they usually try to distinguish themselves as much as they can , often with ethnic stlyles . 
  i like that . 
  plus , countries with rich architectural tradition and good profesionals churn out some good pieces from time to time, 
  pretty great architecture , maybe a bit all too `` samey '' but it often represented the country of origin , which is good !, 
  interesting to see the use of wood and curved surfaces, 
  good thing that we 've got rid of the worse stuff here at least !, 
  i hope other regions that practise it follow, 
  disgusting and barbaric , that 's why we banned it,

  the saddest part i 've seen some people around here who would agree with much of it though, 
  then again , i just chose to ignore you, 
  poor basques ... they should n't have gone out of their natural reserve in euskadi . 
  at least now the problem is happily solved !, 
  wether they like it or not , immigrants are people and while we do have a problem with immigtation we ca n't forget that, 
  yup , unsurprising though , coming from who is currently on power anyway . 
  my grandmother still remembers how the bombs fell on our city ( even if by the time it was just a little village , they bombed it anyway ) and had to flee to the countryside . 
  they 've recently put signs on the streets where the bombs fell ( which may be seen as electoralist but it 's a nice touch ) and it 's surch a hard notion to think that bombs fell on my city just beacause we had * one * factory , which was from the clothing industry anyway, 
  i think he 's probably referring to the francoist government, 
  considering that the alternative is franco i ca n't see how they are worse, 
  by the way , italy has denied to apologise for the bombing raids on barcelona even without declaring war on republican spain ( in fact , there 's internal organitzations trying to force the government to do so ) . 
  [ recent news are that they found an italian pilot sent to spain , though he does n't acklowledge participation in barcelona 's raid ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fcadenaser.com%2femisora%2f2015%2f04%2f24%2fradio_barcelona%2f1429883471_849646.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ), 
  this sub has gone downhill these past months . 
  i 've had to defend immigrants against people who even argued for skipping human rights to deal with them since `` they are illegal so laws do n't apply '' . 
  just disgusting, 
   this guy ... you truly never fail to deliver . 
  great example of agressiveness mate . 
  i guess different opinions are n't welcome, 
   with the intention of not talking about pujol corruption case . 
  so a democratic and socially-backed process that began in 2010 has only the goal to not speak about a certain corruption case revealed in 2014 from one political party which only a fraction of independentsits come from . 
  interestengly enough , we have even set up an investigation comission for the case ( which btw , has n't even confirmed by a judge and even then is ridicolously small compared to spanish corruption cases ) , not like in spain where such things are glossed over ? 
  are you being serious right now ? 
  also , that fiscal deficit link is the most simplistic analisis that i 've ever read . 
  yes , balearics pay more , no , it 's not comparable beacause of their small population and indirect refunds . 
  have you heard them complain much , or madrid for that matter aswell ? 
  they only noticied when we started saying it , and that 's beacause they recieve money indirectly . 
  [ just an example : this is how the highways are gestioned in spain .

  and this comes from a spanish source btw , not a catalan one . 
  we do n't have the public moeny to finance such infraestructures so we have to resort to private investment . 
  and this is just one example upon many . 
  [ and talking about this `` inexistent fiscal deficit '' , i 'd like to share with you another article from a spanish source - also biased , but hey , they even agree that is surprising - ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fccaa.elpais.com%2fccaa%2f2013%2f05%2f21%2fcatalunya%2f1369150513_439578.html ) . 
  oh , so generalizations are cool now ? 
  beacause i only cited concise examples , not like you . 
   at least we know that only the radical nationalist catalans think that way . 
  i wo n't get into discussions arguing that councilmen are hardly representative of anything apart from their opinion or how laporta is n't even into politics anymore . 
  duran i lleida is n't independentist , people insult eachother all the time and you know we [ get insulted in any topic whatsoever ] ( http://www.nationalpost.com/m/wp/blog.html?b=news.nationalpost.com/2015/03/25/spain-investigates-online-insults-of-crash-victims ) . 
  and from the subsidizing ... the fiscal deficit is a thing , welcome to the real world , guess why we want to be independent . 
  education in spanish-catalan is just an excuse to impose spanish . 
  guess which regime also tried to do that ? 
  yeah , it 's such an easy ( and true , by the way ) comparison . 
  catalan is in desperate need of protection and any attempt to harm it will be fought back with any democratic instrument at our reach . 
  the salafist thing is disproportionate , but again , the mayor of calella hardly ever has any relevance in today 's politics . 
  tldr : it seems like you 're really grasping for straws here ... why would that be ?

  i know . 
  yet the minister of education is already clamoring for tighter control . 
  i do not approve it , of course , that 's why i said `` sadly '', 
  this is so fucked up ... how could n't they stop him ? 
  sadly it seems that more control is the only way, 
  so yeah , then you just lose all cooperation with that country and they open the floodgates . 
  you do n't realise how many people are kept in their shores and how much pressure we are excerting so that that keps being that way, 
  * how about we do magic and these immigrants stop existing ? 
  * it * is * a real problem that needs a solution and no , concentration camps are n't viable . 
  if you keep on with the demagogy i will just ignore you . 
  and besides , i 've already answered that elsewhere more than twice, 
  in a short term enviroment , we need to put more patrols on the seas in case of sinking and just take care of the people that succesfully cross ( do you remember the `` wet feet/dry feet '' american policy ? 
  it was n't perfect but it 's a good analogy ) so that we can integrate them as quick as possible and have them doing something useful .
