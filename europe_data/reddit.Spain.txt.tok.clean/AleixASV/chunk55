   it looks like if we want to stop immigration problems we need to stop wars in africa and good luck with that we could just try ? 
  something that we 've never even done ? 
  in fact , all new eu policies seem to point toward investing in africa, 
  if you think that that 'll work ... it 's pretty delusional . 
  * we * are the nearest country without conflicts and we need the guys on the other shore who currently * are stopping the majority of the people * . 
  without their collaboration we are rollaly fucked . 
  besides , people who have risked everything to come here for economic stability * will never * stop coming beacause of that . 
  that 's why they do n't come trough the `` proper channels '', 
  how about you search it ? 
  i do not need to prove a fact that is obvious and if you dispute that you should try to stop living under a rock, 
  in those cases , the goverment tries * and sometimes succedes *, 
  [ i 'm sure there is , you could search for it . 
  i 've found this article from the huffinhton post that , while it is n't the best in history , it summarises the issues that they face a bit ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/09/african-migrants-europe_n_5117035.html ), 
  oh well yes , australia perfectly could 've faced disputes with other countries , i do n't deny that . 
  but it 's not comparable to this issue : indonesia is responsible for only their citizens , whereas any magrib country currently has to hold all of theirs plus all people who pass trough their country to immigrate , they hold much more power and we need their collaboration, 
  i wonder how many times in history people have said that . 
  anyway , it 's probably the least cost effective solution but i wo n't even begin to detail why . 
  it should be pretty clear . 
  and do you think they will ? 
  i already told you that there 's no future in those countries . 
  * they fucking risked their lives and everything they had to come here , did n't you realise that ? 
  where did i say that, 
  again , read my other post, 
  i 'm not talking about that . 
  it 's not a waters control issue . 
  do you know how easy it would be for magrib countries to open the floodgates and excert no control upon who passes to europe and who does n't ? 
  currently they have detention centers and patrol their borders to turn as many people as they can away . 
  do you think that they would like having a bunch of people in their countries ( they , who * also face structural problems and ca n't sustain them ? 
  what about setting up camps only to put * people * in there due to their origin ? 
  sounds * better ? 
   what you are suggesting is open borders which is not supported by europeans ( see op ) i 'm not suggesting that , you just made that up . 
  i disagree with setting up camps that discriminate due to origin basis on the xxi century, 
  see my other post, 
  oh , so economic migrants do n't also get a pass ? 
  beacause they want to * work * ? 
  and send money to their families so they can live better ? 
  even if they are forsaking their country , their friends , their families ? 
  * yes , c'mon , let 's put them in camps !, 
  [ you should n't be so sure about that ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ca&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.amnistiacatalunya.org%2fpaginas%2fnoticies%2fnoticies%2farticulo%2flinternament-indiscriminat-dimmigrants-com-a-politica-de-control-migratori%2f&amp;edit-text= ) [ this is what 's happening in spain ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fciesno.wordpress.com%2f ), 
  as people who risked their lives for a chance to live ? 
  ok , so criminals , let 's discriminate people for their origin ( or lack of ) and put them in camps !, 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
  so either you live there or you go to your country to be killed ( due to malnutrition , wars , sanitary problems ) ? 
  it 's not a choice you know ? 
  establishing camps is so early xxth century , we 've gone past that, 
   your `` what if '' scenarios hold no weight because it has been proven to work in australia . 
  what `` what if scenario '' ? 
  most of those people * ca n't * get back where they come from , they will be : killed/forced to work/dying of malnutrition/etc . 
  i do n't think you realise why they even come here in the first place . 
  and if we just try to put them on the other shore of the mediterranean , you can expect the magrib as a whole to just let everyone pass through and this is not a `` what if '' . 
  the situation with australia is in no way comparable due to this exact problem , they do n't depend on other governments for that . 
  establishing permanent camps is probably the * worst * solution . 
  especially when discriminating the type of people that are * forced * to live there . 
  must i give examples ? 
  how about we try to solve this issue without breaking basic human rights ? 
  how bad that we are in the process of closing them due to not respecting basic human rights eh ? 
  as i said : * they are n't their citizens * , most of them come from countries in central africa . 
  so that 's why i said this :  we ca n't send them back if we do n't know where they come from . 
  what refugee camp ? 
  the one where they are settled once they arrive in europe ? 
  the immigration centers that in spain people are beaten and guards let people die of malnutrition and diseases ? 
  those camps ? 
  yeah , like the magrib governments will collaborate if we just send all of those people back to them, 
  we ca n't send them back if we do n't know where they come from . 
  that 's one of the main problems . 
  also , humanitarian ethics is something that exists , thank god . 
  if help is needed the countries that can provide it must, 
  oh for fucks sake , people cometing here that do n't know crap about le corbusier ... 
  yes , he [ did this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unit%c3%a9_d%27habitation ) , but that was because france could afford nothing better to rebuild , and even then he tried to give it ilumination and gardens . 
  he 's not fucking responsible for what the idiots that tried to imitate him did to other areas which , by the way , * were n't a war-torn country * . 
  i say this living in one of those areas and it was * greed * and not economitzation of resources what motivated those buildings . 
  his reurbanitzation plans furthermore , wanted to clear cities riddled with diseases such as tuberculosis and give open spaces to the city , something which was desperately needed in the cramped spaces of the cities of the time his contribution to architecture was that of the * best * architect in the whole half of the xxth century no question about that and he was a visionary . 
  without him , modern architecture would n't be the same . 
  unity in diversity !, 
  still , it 's not the `` catalan '' flair per se , but the independentist version of the flag . 
  just pointing it out, 
  not a problem . 
  i would never claim that shit, 
  it was a troll account made against me : / u/aleixasv _ i even told you so . 
  do you want proof of the mods banning it ? 
  ... what in the fuck ? 
  edit : if covered , please do read my reply to him . 
  the comment chain he posted was n't made by me but by a troll account , / u/aleixasv _ to bash against independentists, 
  sorry to wake you up from your dream then, 
  andooooooorrraaaa !, 
  please invade us brothers !, 
  catalan is n't a dialect either . 
  nor is basque , they 're both languages, 
  spin to win ... and we pay them for it, 
  the most infuriating thing is how they covered this in the state-wide tv ( tve ) : they just said what i said before plus the minister of foreign affairs defending him by basically saying `` i know him well and if he says that it 's because it 's true '' . 
  they did n't even gave a chance to the poor guy that leads that organization to explain himself even if it 's false and blatanly obvious that all of this is another round of `` independentists want to fuck the country '' pp bullshit, 
  and yet the internal affairs minister tried to link this cell to an independentist organization that tried to integrate immigrants to the community `` because they worked with muslims '' . 
  that 's great indeed, 
  will turkey play ball ? 
  i hope so, 
  `` shit happens '' would be the most approximate estimate i guess ... as long as this is solved , i do n't really mind it that much . 
  thanks for the support anyway :d !, 
  he just apologised to me via pm , telling me that `` there was no justification for it '' and that he was being `` immature and hurftul '' . 
  so i guess there 's that . 
  i 'm as baffled as you are sincerilly,
