  someone ( ? ), 
  created this account : / u/aleixasv _ and started spewing shit all around the subreddit ( i.e. 
  insulting people i had conversed with for example ) , including this post , trying to ridicule me . 
  it 's banned now to post here, 
  who answered 7 days ago was a troll not me . 
  just fyi , there 's some crazy people going around, 
  just fyi , he 's a troll, 
  just fyi , this guy is a troll account, 
  this is seriously the most retarded thing i 've seen here ... to think that people would waste their time just like that ... 
  wtf ? 
  this is probably the first time ( +2 years on reddit ) that i 'll have to report something ... 
   putin would need to go and wipe out kiev at this point to be even close to number 1 . 
  it 's not like he has n't tried :d !, 
  oh shit ... spent too much time on reddit, 
  ohhhh summer time is muuch better !, 
  now it is n't dark at 8 at last !, 
  it was such a waste of a day !, 
  yup , we could be in there aswell, 
  is it ? 
  we here celebrate `` dilluns de pasqua '' , or easter 's monday ... 
  i always thought it was just easter . 
  in fact , just checked wikipedia , we have 3 days of easter : sunday , monday and tuesday, 
  is n't easter tomorrow ? 
  such as tuenti in spain ... though yes , it 's dying really fast with the apps like whatsapp , instagram and the others, 
  or how * it 's not * hahahaha, 
  ... eeeeeh no, 
  no problem , you 're welcome !, 
  yeah , el pla cerd\u00e0 ( urban planning of the eixample district ) is kinda cool , though originally most of the blocks had to be parks , [ kinda like this ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9qos56gh9dm/uk_t7ekas7i/aaaaaaaabe0/_md9qx76r2e/s1600/2012_11_24_bcn_eixample+03.jpg ) ... greed got the best of us :p btw . 
  bar\u00e7a is only used for the sports team and people here do n't use diminutives for barcelona though if you do , the most common is barna followed by bcn,

  catalan here : 1000000000 french units of measurement ( being from where they are , it 's probably part of the international system ) . 
  we 've been fucked a lot of times with our language and so we 're a bit sensitive about restoring it, 
  i might have come as agressive , true , but this `` constitution '' argument is the one used by right-winged spaniards for quite a while now , and we 've answered it too many times . 
  that does n't excuse my bad manners , but i was a bit pissed off at that point anyway ( the thread was clearly being derrailed by spanish trolls ) . 
  well : it 's a long list of many things and we have a lot of arguments that favor it and especially make this movement grow * now * . 
  there 's the economical one : yes , wer 're the most indebt `` comunidad '' in spain and yet the one who proportionally to gdp gives off most of the money away ( in fact not only in spain but in the world ) as `` solidarity '' , 15000m $ in 2011 , which is 7,7 % of our gdp ( though this year was average , there have been others higher and others lower , with a difference of about 2000m $ per year ) . 
  things like this go much deeper though , clear examples being the free highways that are built everywhere in spain except catalonia where , due to the lack of public investement , private companies now charge tolls , or the comparison between goverment helps to museums in madrid/barcelona ( greatly favoring madrid ) . 
  it 's a rather long list , these are just the examples that come to my head . 
  the second question is also linked to part of your first one . 
  catalan nationalism arose in the xixth century ( while it is true that the catalan sentiment had been quinda squashed by the conquest of aragon by castille in 1714 for a while , catalonia is a pretty old nation yet we rarely had an independent modern state ) following the heavy industrialization of the region , a process that , with the exception of euskadi , the rest of spain did n't follow . 
  that created a divergence in interests : while ones were invested heavily into proteccionism against british goods and protect the catalan industry , the others were in favor of the free market to export their grain without danger of foreing counter tariffs . 
  this situation reached it 's peak with the loss of cuba in 1898 , a great market for catalonia and so we demanded to have more rights to properly rebalance our interests . 
  we created the first railway on the country , the first modern parties ( with a clear nationalist interest furthermore ) and tried to adquire more rights ( something that the basque did n't have to worry for , since they had been on the right side of enough wars and they still enjoyed their `` particular rights '' of old ) which was confronted with heavy repression and violence by the spanish army ( barcelona was called `` the rose of fire '' , due to the constant protests ) . 
  anyway , i 'll skipe a bit but we got two dictators ( primo de rivera and franco ) who pretty much tried to destroy the catalan culture and language and a `` catalan republic '' which was declared between the two regimes in 1931 in the beggining of the second spanish republic , its government making sure that such an afront to the `` unity of the country '' woulnd ' t stand . 
  anyhow , with the death of franco in 1975 , we tried to negotiate some kind of autonomy in spain , something that other spaniards could n't tolerate and so the `` state of the autonomies '' was born . 
  literally , if the catalans had something , the spaniards had to have it aswell , so `` arcane and ancient autonomies '' arose from thin air to form regional governments with the same power as catalonia but without becoming a federation . 
  as years passed by , we requested more rights , since the early pact with madrid was rushed , and in 2006 the then spanish president promised to give us a new `` regional consitution '' , called `` estatut '' . 
  this estatut was approved by referendum and in our government the next year , then sent to the spanish government . 
  even after the promise of the then president , they thought that promises are n't meant to be kept , so they voted against it and cut whole sections off of it . 
  after a long process , it was finally approved . 
  * buuuuuut * the now ruling party , pp , which was then in opposition thought that it was n't still enough , and sent it to the `` constitutional tribunal '' with their favorite excuse for everything : it was against the constitution !, 
  this tribunal by the way , took around 2 or 3 years because even with being full of judges that were literally members of the pp party could n't agree to a resolution , statiyng tied for a while . 
  anyhow , in 2010 their final resolution came , cutting even more chapters off our estatut , reducing it to nothing less than we here call `` wet paper '' , totally useless ... as you can see , the outrage was unstopabble , and sprung forth a series of demonstrations that have yearly since surpassed the bar of 1m protestors rising to 2m last year in a country of only about 7m people . 
  we since the beggining were demanding independence yet our president came up with a `` moderate solution '' to try to solve in 2012 this issue : the fiscal pact , in which we would control our taxes and sent them to madrid and not the other way around ( as it 's established today , where madrid regulates all taxes ) , like they do in eusaki . 
  rajoy , the spanish president , said no . 
  in fact , he has been saying no since he was elected and since today it 's the only thing he has said , no counter-offer , no attempt to negotiate a pactated referndum ... nothing , apart from well ... `` this is inconstitutional ! '' . 
  sometimes i wonder if he himself has created more independentists with his `` dialogue '' and `` negotiation '' than even our most logical arguments in favor of it . 
  so that 's our situation mostly covered , i did n't talk about our culture still being attacked or the education minister talking about his intentions to `` spanish-fy '' the catalan children regulating the use of catalan in schools , the foreign affairs control that our president has to suffer every time he wants to get out of the country or our public tv ( almost the only catalan channel nowadays ) being threatened but hey !, 
  it 's a really deep issue , and that 's why we demand independence !, 
  almost 400 comments , 60 votes to the thread , way to go !, 
  besides , i think i 've had my twice daily ration of downvotes today , i should diet, 
  7,7 % of our pib goes to madrid , 15.000 $ a year , more than 2000 $ per citizen . 
  and yet we are one of the most indebt communities because we have no access to that money we generate, 
  ... what , do you belive in the eternity of the kingdom , come again by her gracious queen isabel ? 
  keeping a low tone as diverting the discussion to other topics when talking about that, 
   try again then . 
  you have to work on the problem together with spain . 
  you have almost 1/4 of the population of spain . 
  catalonia has the power to do it . 
  you ca n't talk to someone who does n't listen . 
  independence is the only possible solution and * do belive me * we 've tried for decades now ( and centuries if you count the years before franco ) to negotiate something good for both parties and they never ceded . 
  this movement came to be due to an unexpected series of negations so long that i understand it might be hard to comprehend for someone who has n't lived here and is n't totally aware of the situation . 
  we tried as hard as we could , and we 've grown tired of that, 
   european one . 
  we help each other during good and bad times . 
  i am sure that if you protest towards minimizing the fiscal deficit instead of for independence i feel like you will be more successful in fixing that problem . 
  we tried that in 2012 , the `` fiscal pact '' to solve all issues our president said . 
  they shoved the door at his face and told him no . 
  that 's it . 
  that 's why independentism is on the rise , it 's the last solution . 
   the eu has already stated that it would not welcome catalonia at least in the beginning no they have n't , they claim it to be an internal affair officially . 
  well then , i wo n't discuss things with someone who does n't know what 's he 's talking about, 
  i have n't seen it apart from duran and some other guy that i ca n't remember, 
  they will be subject of international pressure if this issue keeps on going for much longer . 
  you just need to wait at what will happen on the 27th of september . 
  things * will * get interesting , for better or worse . 
   everyone and their mother knows ciu has been stealing hands full for decades . 
  let the matter reach the courts , sure . 
  the day after their corruption charges prescribe . 
  meanwhile , we sing the ` innocent until proven guilty ' song while the political parties keep appointing the members for the tribunal de cuentas to audit themselves so we ca n't have early warning signs for the justice . 
  that is how pp got away with having crooks as treasurers since their very inception . 
  time and paper shredders clean anything . 
  ok , so you just told me that ciu is corrupt . 
  it probably is , we do n't know . 
  so what ?
