  my initials ... 
  i 'm really not that original :p, 
  is it , my sweety ? 
  contribuiting with something would n't hurt now , i 'm worried about my blood presure , please explain !, 
  shit one second , thanks for commenting !, 
  almost the eastern papal state ? 
  was n't that portugal ? 
  poor fellas catching the cold with all that atlantic storms so that we do n't suffer them !, 
  not in existence for now ? 
  it has it 's charms ( ever read machado ? 
  ) , but yeah , not for me neither, 
  that 's why it 's just my opinion and not a fact :p . though remembering history has its uses after all, 
  oh , no offense taken at all !, 
  a bit of banter is welcome in this `` super-cereal '' subreddit , at least imho, 
  without pretending to offend anyone , i like to link the `` jacobin '' from the french revolution and `` podemos '' : they both want somewhat radical changes ( even if podemos is watering down and down as time passes ) and both want to rule in a hierarchy that steems from the capital , against any regionalism, 
   cuidadanos does n't really fit left or right though they are generally very neolibiral . 
  they have their roots as a catalan regional party but on the stay with spain side ( so they have the potential to really disrupt the whole catalonia nationalism movement ) . 
  their big push was to allow for personal bankruptcy ( pp adopted the position in an attempt to subvert them ) and make a lot of labor and business laws more efficient . 
  they are just conservatives , if you can define them as that ( or if you have seen them in action , they just take advantadge of the situation , nothing else : just switch your tv on and you 'll see their leader in every single interview ever ) . 
  because themselves have n't even defined a clear stance : not a single position of major power in catalonia after all these years has let them do any real politics and so they have the benefit of the doubt , which they exploit with much delight ( also , they are corrupt , big surprise in spain , is n't it ? 
  with one of their major representatives shunned away to do `` consultive work '' in madrid even though they said that they would kick all corrupts out ) also ... 
  seriously ? 
  disrupt the catalan movement ? ... 
  the only thing that they will disrupt here is the local pp ( conservatives ) , and nobody cared about them to begin with !, 
  we know who they are , they are n't new here and we never cared about them, 
  there 's even deserts around `` la meseta '' ... and when i go around there ... 
  it 's pretty all barren and emtpy , maybe because i 'm mediterranean and there 's stuff everywhere here ? 
  actually , the tallest mountain in spain is [ a volcano in las canarias ] ( http://hotelrurallosrealejos.com/uploads/2080/files/plato-3195.jpg ) , and the tallest one in the mainland is n't on the pyrenees , but near granada , in the south : [ the mulhac\u00e9n ] ( http://images.summitpost.org/original/617431.jpg ), 
  2nd most montanious state in europe ho !, 
  actually , the spanish industry suffered a lot because of this : in the xixth century trains were hard and expensive to buy , and required complex lines ( that more often than not , led to nowhere ... but that 's not a problem here :p ), 
  well i mean , googling for `` fake cyrillic write '' does n't let much room for accuracy, 
  [ do you speak catalan ? 
  if so , here 's all you need to know in relation to underground powerlines in catalonia . 
  google translator works somewhat good ] ( http://icaen.gencat.cat/web/.content/migracio_automatica/documents/activitats_i_dades_energetiques/arxius/monografic13.pdf ), 
  i 'm talking about net money stolen , and pujol 's is rather small ( for now ) compared to the pret\u00f2ria case in which bartomeu acted, 
  i 'm still on phone and just talked to a friend of mine who 's an engineer ( will get sources when i get home , dont you worry ) and he told me that , while costly , they are pretty usual and their implementation just depends on much the ruling government cares about the people that the line passes trough since they are a lot safer ( greatly reduces fire threat , zero visual impact and much cheaper to mantain ) - btw , there are no quakes and floods here , and if a minor one were to happen the construction will resist it with ease, 
  no , bartomeu mu\u00f1oz ... pujol * should 've been there * a long time ago ... but our politicians are idiots and cover him, 
  yes . 
  they are more expensive ( that 's why you wo n't see them - besides the underground thing - ) but they are more implemented than you might think , especially in places such as here , barcelona , where buildable land is scarce and fires are somewhat frequent due to tower massification . 
  that 's why , when folks here saw the project , they assumed that they would just bury it : such high voltage is dangerous in highly flammable vegetation , and especially in the 70 we had serious problems about this ( i think that even some houses close to the former forest burnt ) resulting in the destruction of the woods around my city ( now we only have shrubs than burn even quicker in summer ) and it has n't recovered since then . 
  not that surprisingly though , the mayor that we had when the plan was announced gave the litigation to one of his friends , promising of course the buriyng of all the thing once the power lines entered the metro area . 
  it never happened of course . 
  by the way , did you know that this same mayor is now in prison for the biggest corruption case in the whole catalonia ? 
  and did you know that it was for the same reason ( corrupt licitations of constrction ) ? 
  that is why people here are * really * weary of projects like these . 
  they do n't really thrust polticians to keep their word and bury the damm thing ... 
  i guess i 'm too innocent still ... - i 'm on the phone , sorry for shitty formatting -, 
  ** do people read what i say ? 
  is this just a `` oh , he does n't think like us , to him !, 
  situation ? 
  i did n't say that i was against the project , i 'm against bad managenment ** you know you can just bury the thing , do n't you ? 
  our mountains are charred and barren due to the fires started because the cramming of the damm things ( sparks and poorly built and mantained towers ) and we were starting to remove them until this stupid project arrived and every politician ran to give the licitations to their cousins and brothers , even if they clearly had no capability of building them correctly . 
  why do you keep talking when you clearly have no idea of what you are saying ? 
  ... are you being serious ? 
  ehmmm yeah alright , so if you 're not willing to do it properly then do n't act surprised that every single townhall that the line goes trough opposes the project . 
  besides , liciting all the thing to friends and relatives is nice is n't it ? 
  good way to launder some money !, 
  ... i did not say this :  if they want to connect the countries , for fucks sake , bury them and do n't cram them along the coastline , we 've had enough of under-funded projects and rigged licitations !, 
  lack of connections ? 
  so they have n't got enough [ with this crap ] ( http://in.directe.cat/imatges/noticies/linies-de-mat.jpg ) [ in the middle of my fucking country ? ] ( http://images.ara.cat/tema_del_dia/que-mat-sola-ree-marti_araima20150216_0007_1.jpg ) ... 
  the only place that i had to try to escape the can of fish that is barcelona now is covered in towers , they are everywhere !, 
  if they want to connect the countries , for fucks sake , bury them and do n't cram them along the coastline , we 've had enough of under-funded projects and rigged licitations !, 
  well i mean ... my flair is the flag of catalan independence if that gives out any clue , 
  i do not deny the problem . 
  but what i 'm saying is that it should n't be object of generalization as the user who i replied to said, 
  never say never ? 
  that 's obvious, 
  yet due to the low number of native basque speakers and the penetration of the spanish school system i ca n't belive this is a really * major * issue is it ? 
  * we are n't einstein * , he 's dead dummy !, 
  of course that there 's 1 person high up in the mountains that can barely speak with anyone that is n't his/her goats . 
  but that does n't make it a rule like he said , rotundly afirming this :  depends on the complexity of the conversation which implicitly tells you that many non-spanish speakers ca n't actually speak spanish that well . 
  even on the most backwards town of catalonia people speak spanish with fluidity, 
  in the case he has given ( people brought up with a iberic native language other than spanish ) i can tell you for certain that complexity is never an issue, 
   i remember i was in barcelona during some celebration and the people were totally nuts . 
  that 'd be either sant joan 's night ( where literally a little 6 year old might set off his little arsenal of death ) or the local `` feast '' ( every town has one ) , which in the case of barcelona is la merc\u00e8 and you happened to find the * correfocs * ( literally , [ run-fire ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fornpyhezt4 ) ) . 
  fireworks are a really important part of our traditions !, 
  actually , sant joan is on the 23th of june , so soon mostly legal firework shops will show up again on the streets !, 
  ah , summer, 
   spain only was formed in the late 15th century . 
  and not even that is true ( or at least there is n't consensus about it ) . 
  in catalonia we place the origin of spain when castille conquered aragon and annexed it , basically forming a single state with centralized political power ( and ending all of our rights as citizens of aragon ) , in the nueva planta decree of the early 18th century, 
  catalonia is very much a land made of immigrants , we ca n't define a catalan by birth : a catalan ( in my opinion ) knows and likes the language and culture , and lives and works here . 
  that 's it, 
  you only need to change basque for catalan and this would be my comment , i agree completely, 
  at around something like 6/7 $ for 6 momos , not * too * expensive , but expensive enough to warrant shipping . 
  however , importing foods is serious business in the eu , and i 've only seen it done with supermarket chains , not e-shops, 
  oh no , i would n't buy right now , but * if i had to buy * something from nepal it would be that, 
  no idea , though i 'm sure food can be exported into europe , i 've seen imported food from japan and south america here in supermarkets . 
  frozen momos may not be as good as newly cooked but they might taste good anyway !, 
  and chicken momo all the way !, 
  they 're delicious, 
  northern ireland ?

  [ i 'm afraid ] ( http://imatges.vilaweb.cat/nacional/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/gironagameofthrones.jpg ) that it [ is ] ( http://d1abj31dnwl5uq.cloudfront.net/imatges/54/54/alta/780_0008_5454458_c4bedb2c915863ade8dddea7b65b8ed0.jpg ) too [ late :p ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/girona_031.jpg ), 
  take it from sevilla , that does n't [ necessairly mean that the movie will be good ] ( http://cdn.traveler.es/uploads/images/thumbs/201250/espana_set_de_rodaje_de_hollywood_214340522_1200x900.jpg ), 
  come next season we might steal that name from you [ :p ] ( https://seriescienciaficcion.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/game-of-thrones-season-6-girona.jpg ), 
  i mean , compared to barcelona belive me , * it 's almost nothing * . 
  we have stereotypes , give names and have prejudices toward so many tourists . 
  to be honest though , many have earned it, 
  i mean , if the city is not overcrowded there 's no problem .
