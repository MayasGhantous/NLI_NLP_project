  the architects behind these temples were italian actually !,

  quite an old building too right ? 
  it looks as if it has had many reconstructions and additions, 
  prague is definetely one of those must-see cities in europe and yeah , i understand you completely , my city is too overcrowded as hell so if you come please do it off-season too ( april/may may be the best months ), 
  i want to visit prague someday , but i fear that it now has the barcelona syndrome : too many tourists . 
  i ca n't even stand most of them here , so i 'll have to wait for a few years and see how things go then, 
  i knew it !, 
  that 's why it has such a bizarre clash of styles , it 's a building that has suffered many , many renovations and it was prettty common to build in whatever was `` going on '' architecturally at the moment ( hence classical and neogothic ), 
  yep , it 's what i told you : a mix of gothic and classical ( neogothic arches on top , roman arches on the bottom ) . 
  could very well be late 19th , but i think it 's a bit earlier than that, 
  i study architecture though i 'm not an expert ( yet ) by all means too :p the art noveau predominant on that region is j\u00fcgendstill , which is muuuch more plain than that , plus the ornamentation has floral and organic motives , not medieval/classical/gothic . 
  that building was clearly built before late xixth and early xxth century which is when art noveau began, 
  it is stunning , but it is n't modern : notice the ogival arches ( neogothic ) and classical lower levels . 
  the one on the left could be from the same time and still seems to have a much more modern style to it , but it is n't quite noveau yet, 
  the cathedral looks like some late neogothic , but holy hell , why have n't i heard of this before ? 
  yes , it 's j\u00fcgendstill , not the `` bizarre '' modernist architecture that we have here , but it looks pretty great . 
  and not only beacause of the beauty of his art !, 
  the begginings of modern structures began when he was at his prime , and seeing how gaud\u00ed led down the charges of his works down to the basements is just amazing , like nothing else had been done before . 
  he was a great artist and a great engineer, 
  thank you , i will !, 
  art noveau is my favourite architectural style by a mile ( i live in barcelona , what else would i say :p ? ), 
  art noveau ? 
  honestly , that does n't look like that at all in any of those pictures , it 's too classical . 
  really interested anyway , since i 've never heard of the movement spreading to the baltics though, 
   catalonia in our case though , it 's much more an economic problem than an identitary crisis such as what you say i 'd be . 
  apart from that you 're right, 
  this pretty much looks like 1984 honestly, 
  must krush kapitalism, 
  and the balears !, 
  no , no , i agree with you . 
  here it happens * way * to often too : antoni gaud\u00ed , not * `` antonio '' * for fucks sake, 
  we should take the opportunity of camp nou 's renovation and change the name to johan cruyff . 
  seriously , he literally made the bar\u00e7a we now today , he deserves it . 
  rip, 
  it does n't , the fascists for now do n't hold any power at all , thankfully, 
   a group of radical right wing has launched flares near the mosque of the m-30 in what they have described as an action `` against radical islam '' during which they also hung on a catwalk a poster that read : '' today brussels , madrid tomorrow ? '', 
  if he does n't like it , it 's not good and biased . 
  as easy as that . 
  why but of course that frisia and brittany are , too , nations !, 
  you are confusing the terms : to be a nation you do not need statehood , only a distinctive culture , language ( in most cases ) , historic precedent and a considerable amount of land ruled by a goverment . 
  of course , like everything , this is not as cristal clear as it sounds , beacause while we do happen to check all of these conditions , other nations ( such as brittany , the navajo tribe , tibet , etc ) might not always be as lucky . 
  even if many states in europe happen to be nation-states ( such as denmark , though i 'm not sure how greenland plays into this and if they 're considered a nation ) that does n't mean that * the only nations are the states * . 
  that 's why there are two separate terms . 
  i am talking about catalonia . 
  the principality was it 's title as one of the four states that conformed the crown of aragon . 
  now , to understand why catalonia is a nation and not just a region you have to know a fair bit of our history , so i 'll tell you at least where our flag comes from . 
  the senyera ( meaning ` the signal ' in old catalan ) finds it 's legendary beggining as a gift from the frankish king to his adversary 's deathbed , gifr\u00e9 el pil\u00f3s , who declared the independence of the catalan counties from france , since the latter did n't defend them from moorish attacks . 
  in his last battle ( late viii century ) , wounded and in his deathbed , gifr\u00e9 asked the king to give him a banner for his newly founded house and the french put four fingers on the warrior 's wound and extended them upon his golden shield . 
  so that 's the origin of the flag : it was the flag of the house of barcelona , which would later become the flag of aragon once this house controled it , and since their main realm was the principalty of catalonia , it too would adopt it . 
  the first confirmed relic with the flag dates from 1150 , many centuries before denmark 's , and since then it has been the flag that represents the nation of catalonia ( be it when we declared independence from spain in three separate ocasions or used as a symbol against represion ) . 
  of course , we 're not a state ( yet ) but that does n't mean that we 're not a nation . 
  well of course , but you see , catalonia is * also a nation * . 
  a stateless one at that, 
  that 's why i said competing though . 
  in any way , the legendary origin of our flag places it in the late viiith century . 
  it 's very hard to affirm that one certain flag is the oldest , but we can say that catalonia 's is among the most ancient, 
  obviously the senyera ( ours ) is the bestest and oldest ( sorry denmark , but we win !, 
  :p ) , but apart from that i have to say , iceland looks amazing !, 
  yay !, 
  and not many people know this , but the senyera ( our flag ) is actually one of the oldest in europe , and if we 're to belive the legend of its origin , it 's actually the oldest !, 
  the flag of catalonia is competing for that title though ( * and winning * 1397 vs 1150 ) !, 
  if you do n't count states , that is, 
  it 's called the blue estelada ( estelada meaning ` the one with the stair ' in catalan ) , and it 's a variation of the catalan flag , the senyera , solely for the purpose of demanding the independence of catalonia . 
  there are some other variants of estelada ( the red - left-wing - one for example ) , but this is the most common beacause it has no other ideology apart from separatism behind it . 
  also , if you 're in catalonia the info number is ** 012 **, 
  he 's a troll , redditor for 8 months and only 4 comments . 
  please do n't mind him, 
  please , do n't, 
  [ i translated the tweet from the gov 's emergencies twitter . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/012/status/711524021033160704 ) this is not the place for such discussions . 
  foreigners to catalonia in this case ( fora de catalunya = foreigners , you 're reading too much into this ) , i do not wish to argue this kind of bullshit now , it 's a sad day . 
  the bus driver tested negative for drugs & alcohol . 
  all around a terrible tragedy , my condolences to the families of the deceased . 
  ** the info phone for foreigners is * +34 * 902400012 , and for people in catalonia 012 **, 
   people besides us are mean towards spaniards ? 
  they need to stop , that 's our thing . 
  * cough cough *, 
   ` remembers ' us and tries to block it ( again ... ) funny how when they actually remember us is not for recognition but for blockage . 
  and they claim to `` represent '' us . 
  that must be why we 're not an official language in the eu despite being one of the biggest . 
  people just do n't remember us !, 
  also , we can understand portuguese , spanish ( i wonder to which level a catalan-only speaker would understand spanish though , since we all know both ) , french ( though it can be a bit hard for me sometimes ) and italian pretty well !, 
  steam ? 
  specially ironic given the country flair, 
  ahhhh the * transici\u00f3n * , it changed so much !, 
  i mean , spain did have colonies , but they were stupid small and lost them constantly ( [ diaster of annual , etc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_annual ) ), 
  yeah , they look pretty nice and their design at a first glance seems * very * resistent , not just good looking, 
  beacause * muh blue blood !,
