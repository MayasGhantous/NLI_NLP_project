  * there 's no wrong for a borb\u00f3n and if you fuck up ... [ you know what you have to do !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqwlh0xdvsw ), 
  and even killed his own brother !, 
  that 's the stuff of legends !, 
  and to romance language speakers , at least for me !, 
  it 's * hard *, 
  was it so hard to keep , other romance languages :p ? 
  is catalonia marked as `` other pine '' ? 
  yep !, 
  the root of catalan is closer to french than it is to spanish ... and i do n't even know about italian, 
  well i mean , there 's no doubt barcelona would be the capital of an independent catalonia , we do n't even think about what we 'd do about it if we 'd become independent !, 
  and yes , our foreign office ( threatened by spanish institutions recently ! ), 
  is making contact with all secessionist goverments in europe !, 
  it 's great !, 
  well we do and do n't , it 's not fully independent yet !, 
  well i mean , we 're 25 % of the gdp , it 'd be hard for spain to compensate , but since we 're not the ones in control of our money they kinda deserve it for shiphoning too much . 
  brussels would actually be a nice `` city state '' if we were to go ahead with eu federalization . 
  thank you anyway !, 
  ... actually having a country ? 
  no problem !, 
  this war in particular is really important here , and it 's the theme of our anthem !, 
  the union of the two crowns happened in 1492 , but they coexisted ( like the uk or the commonwealth ) until 1714, 
  not just `` a revolution '' , we literally declared the first catalan republic ( not shown on map , which is a pity ) . 
  initially , the french backed us , but then they stabbed us in the back and made their king `` the count of catalonia '' , basically negating our independence . 
  in the peace treaty spain gave northern catalonia ( our homeland ) off to france , and there it remains ... 
  well , like aragon , which existed until 1714 . 
  that 's why modern historians consider the start of modern spain at that year , when castille and aragon actually stopped existing , since the former conquered the first . 
  occitania historically has always been catalonia 's brother : we come from the same region and our languages were often mistaken for one another , the rulers were usually friends and the occitan and catalan states coexisted pacefully . 
  nowadays i 'd say that we 've got a good relationship with the basques and the scottish , especially thanks to the secession debate . 
  you 'll find catalan flags in both places for sure . 
  ireland is a close one too . 
  in a sense , our worst rival is ignorance, 
  you 're welcome / de res !, 
  it 's dull and uninteresting , a place where fascists gather up , built with the blood of the political prisoners . 
  funny how i 've been downvoted , seems like i might 've struck a nerve around a certain crowd though :p you should go visit el escorial instead , which is neraby , do n't give your money/time to the organizers of this charade, 
  or do n't . 
  it 's absolutely not worth it, 
  yeah , but when i was a kid i complained to my piano teacher that a certain note in the piano did n't work properly and she went into playing asturias , since that was the repeating note from the piece , and it has stuck with me ever since :p, 
  nope , * enric * , he 's a catalan born in lleida . 
  the official catalan enciclopedia calls him that , you can also ask a few townhalls to change street names if you do n't happen to agree with them too . 
  but why do you insist on such things and not just simply enjoy the music ? 
  catalan classical musicians ( who are often mistook for spaniards due to their arabesque influences ) * are really good with piano * : [ isaac alb\u00e9niz , asturias ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atfdrlcxqme ) [ enric granados , `` andaluza '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wiihtbpwmy ) ** but ** , the best , of course , is pau casals . 
  being awarded for many peace awards ( such as the medal of peace of the un or the presidential medal of freedom ) , composed the cello adaptation ( his best work , though of course he has done much more ) of a traditional catalan song , the `` cant dels ocells '' , [ which is beautiful ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bzp3co0cea ) . 
  he is considered one of the best , if not the best , cellist to ever live . 
  [ here you can hear his speech to the un ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmwzejerlwq ), 
  oh yeah , european countries currently can afford not to care about nationalism beacause they already have their own states and all ( i mean , it 's an obvious step toward an egalitarian community , the country `` sticks '' itself , it does n't need to be `` glued '' with nationalism ) . 
  as you say , i think that if we want to build a new european nation we * need * to learn a new kind of nationalism , more or less the one that we use in our independentist process . 
  if we do n't it will simply not happen , we wo n't `` stick togheter '' . 
  this basically means that we need to learn from eachother , cultures , languages , etc , much more than what we 're doing now . 
  we basically need to become one community , and be proud of our common heritage , that 's my take on european nationalism . 
  in catalonia it does n't , since catalan nationalism has always been about oposition * to * spanish nationalism , francoism , fascism ( dictators such as primo de rivera , franco , etc. 
  have always attacked catalan nationalism and used it in their rethoric ) . 
  that 's also one of the main reasons why it 's stronger in the left than in the right wing ( since the left is usually more `` revolutionary '' and dared more against dictatorships ), 
  i mean , if you want to build a * nation * , a european nation , you need * nationalism * . 
  that 's obvious . 
  most of europe has forgotten that , since ww2 kinda took that idea and wrecked it . 
  here in catalonia though , nationalism is alive and well * since what we 're trying to do is exactly that , to build a modern state * . 
  we did understand that since the beggining , and nationalism here does n't have any authoritarian connotation : we 've got catalan reactionaries and catalan communists both on the same nationalism boat working ( more or less ) togheter in parliment , with a majority , to get independence !, 
   and spanish rulers . 
  aragon was not spain . 
  at all . 
  in fact , spain came to be as a state through the conquest of the former by castille , in 1714 . 
  previous to that it had only been a geographical designation ( as in `` the spanish kingdoms '' , the kingdoms in the spanish penninsula , from the latin hispania : the name the romans gave the penninsula ) . 
  just a minor correction , since the island was aragonese since 1282 , almost 500 years before the spanish state was born , until 1409 , also before the spanish state existed . 
  but really , this just proves how fucked up most spanish politics and media are, 
  ... `` having a job '' is kinda hard around here :p, 
  spain has good food . 
  they probably make it with our money , but still , it 's good food . 
  for spain , i would n't even say that `` we 're moving toward this again '' . 
  as you said , we are by no means out of the previous one , and the country could go bankrupt if any kind of shakedown happens , the economy is * very * delicate right now . 
  ah , aleix sal\u00f3 , my favourite catalan ilustrator !, 
  [ this video is what made him famous . 
  if you understand spanish , it 's about the spanish real state crisis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7p2exrf3gq ), 
  [ `` the sardana is the most beautiful dance of all of the dances that are made and unmade '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukhyngxj-ny ) also , [ ball de bastons ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2jqzwpxba8 ) ( dance of sticks ) , a bit more `` fast '' [ plus does this count as a dance ? 
  it has dance it the name of the tradition but who knows ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed6bum4xqp4 ) [ habaneres , songs of the spanish-american war of cuba , also known as `` that song everybody knows '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxhsqch1ows ), 
  it 's fucking freezing and i myself would never withstand it . 
  i think the coldest i 've ever been is maybe -5 c\u00ba . 
  and i do n't even live in the middle of the barren that is syria, 
  well obviously i was n't , under his perspective though ( he was `` forced '' to learn catalan ) you could say yes . 
  all of this was to make him see how ridicolous it sounds . 
  do notice that i always said `` force '', 
  catalonia stronk !, 
  catalonia will rule yurop ( even if we 're kicked out , we 'll start * our * europe , with blackjack and disinterested brits ! ), 
  oh , so why bother preverving any language that does n't have more than 100m speakers ? 
  we should all speak chinese then !, 
  catalan is one of the biggest languages in europe , and indispensible if you want to live in catalonia . 
  obviously , like pretty much all languages in europe , it will only be of use to you if you go to the region where it 's spoken . 
  so what if spanish has worldlwide use ? 
  i 'm glad that i know it , of course , but * i was forced * to learn it . 
  i 'm not judging it though , this is not a case of good/bad , it 's just a fact . 
  it 's a different perspective . 
  yeah what you say is true , it 's part of the curriculum of catalan history and language in all highschools . 
  pa\u00eds valenci\u00e0 is , though , the default name referring to the entire region in the catalan-valencian language  i really hated having it forced upon me as a kid ( now i quite like that i know an extra language , but you know , age changes you ) . 
  on the same line , i was `` forced '' to learn spanish : before learning it when i was 5 at school i had no need of it . 
  it does go both ways :p, 
  * and since it was my first time visiting up there , it was great !, 
  * i can deal with a few months of 30\u00ba , but it kinda gets annoying . 
  you guys had the same temperatures that we have now ( and much , much more rain ), 
  these areas are where catalan culture is still present , so we 'd have to do some serious ` culture conversions ' to get it all back : /, 
  really ?
