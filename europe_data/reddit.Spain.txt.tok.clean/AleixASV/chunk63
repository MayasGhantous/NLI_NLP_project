  it 's the usual name in our tv when talking about you . 
  i guess it depends on where you are from , not all areas in there have valencian culture, 
  dammit !, 
  if i was n't an imperialist pancatalanist i 'd tell you that paella is valencian , not catalan ... uhhhhggghhh i hate multiculturalism, 
  you surely mean l'alguer right :p ? 
  [ we have a cooler name for that , pa\u00efsos catalans , no `` greater x nonsense !, 
  ] ( http://www.62delmaestrat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/713px-mapa_dels_pa%c3%afsos_catalans.svg_.png ) and 10 of our 135 mp want to go ahead and create it . 
  so , get ready for some * pancatalanismmm *, 
  no problem !, 
  there 's also the fact that , in catalan , country does n't mean much more than a considerably big amount of land with a recognisable goverment and different culture . 
  that 's why the valencians aware of their distinct culture ( as in , speakers of catalan-valencian , etc. ), 
  call the valencian community `` pa\u00eds valenci\u00e0 '' or `` valencian country '' . 
  here in catalonia it 's the same , we 've been calling ourselves a country for centuries . 
  it is an autonomous community yes , but that is the political terminology given to the region beacause of the way spain is organized . 
  that does n't mean that it ca n't be a country also . 
  a country can be an autonomous community but an autonomous community does n't mean that it 's a country , otherwise cantabria , extremadura , etc. 
  would also be countries and they definetely are n't . 
  country meaning that it has it 's own culture , goverment , language , laws , etc. 
  * even if * it 's not independent . 
  due to the context of the spanish regional system ( the transition from fascism to democracy ) there is really no point in discussing the legitimacy to the `` autnomous community '' as a term . 
  it was a solution really compromised by the situation . 
  it 's a country in the same way that scotland is a country . 
  what it is n't is a state . 
  and yes , it is a nation , even some spanish reactionaries ackwnoledge that, 
  yeah , i put it in as a joke for the tons of people that start yelling `` catalonia is not a country '' whenever i post anything related to that :p, 
  [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xo5ulxs1do ) ( even if we * definetely * have better singers , but hey ) , [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqqvmsqiqnq ) ( our national anthem ) and [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dwcgqflore ) ( the song to our flag , the senyera , sung in the palau de la m\u00fasica , where a few decades ago , catalan singers sung it in the face of franco and his explicit prohibition ), 
  ... dammit !, 
  depending on how the fiscal system works out . 
  what we complain about here is that our system * is an exception * among any other in the world , pulling a lot of money that does n't get reinvested at a much higher percentage than the average . 
  it absolutely is !, 
  but to be honest , i think it 's the hardest romance language for me to understand at a quick glance ... maybe i have n't seen enough written romanian though, 
  on the other hand , i at least would n't want to be part of an european federation under spain , but i 'd be happy with it under catalonia, 
  hmmmm actually in catalan we did n't have a `` language reform '' ( proper grammar rules and all ) until 1913 , so it 's possible that some of these letters like '' \u00f6 '' might 've been used too . 
  i do n't know enough to be sure though, 
  oh yeah , the two languages are somewhat similar , compared to how unrelated spanish and french are , for example . 
  we here call the `` umlaut '' the `` di\u00e8resi '', 
  thank you !, 
  yeah , the construction of phrases is specially weird for me , though i 'm not sure if anyone would find the one that we use in catalan strange too ... maybe so . 
  and no , i was n't talking about french , this is catalan :p, 
  oh , you would n't dare to use american words against us ? 
  beacause i 'm sure that archaic catalan was even weirder than it is now , who knows what horrors lie there , forgotten ? 
  ( to be honest , i 've got no clue ), 
  we use it to express that the u ( or the i ) must be pronounced in conditions when it usually should n't be pronounced , it 's not like the \u00fcmlaut !, 
  [ our national tv is weird ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgaxwlfp06s ), 
  heeeey count again , it 's a draw to eleven !, 
  :p , the l \u00b7 l counts too !, 
  we look at the other romance languages with arrogance over a tower made in accents, 
  i mean , we here in catalonia have \u00e0 , \u00ef , \u00fc , \u00e9 , \u00e8 , \u00ed , \u00fa , \u00f2 , \u00f3 , \u00e7 , l \u00b7 l , and maybe some more , and we 're still latin :p, 
  when i was talking about cultural erosion ( in val\u00e8ncia , here we 're doing mostly fine conserving our culture ) i was talking about pp * eroding * the valencian culture and putting the spanish one in its place . 
  of course we here accept multiculturalism , we 're the most `` international '' region in spain by a wide margin , that 's not what i was talking about . 
   for me that 's the perfect birthplace of brand new cultures , new traditions . 
  crema catalana is n't so special . 
  embrace change and go eat a curry !, 
  crema catalana is best crema . 
  i 've even tasted curry * where the recipy comes from * ( as in , asia ) and it 's a tough match :p  regarding the financial side , madrid and the balearic islands have higher fiscal deficits than barcelona and they are n't wanting independence . 
  that 's inherently not true . 
  madrid does show up having a higher fiscal deficit yes , but beacause the method in which this data was made does n't account for the investment that being a capital means ( tons of jobs in administration , state funded institutions , etc ) , since this data only takes into account regional investment . 
  the balearic islands simply do not have the population to notice this as much as we do : as you said , catalonia is in debt even if our money * if financing the debt of other communities * . 
  that 's beacause the central goverment has chosen to keep us on a tight grip , not letting us in control of our economy and forcing us into debt , which is then paid `` thanks to '' the fla , a state-backed fund that is supposed to grant liquidity into communities , * always with interest * . 
  the non-compliance with madrid 's policies ( or actually , doing anything that they do n't like ) means no more money from the fla , in short , coercion . 
   the longer i live in catalunya the less i understand the independence movement . 
  apart from the language ( which is the same in valencia and they 're not bothered ) some are bothered , but val\u00e8ncia has been dominated by pp ( spanish right wing ) for decades , which has eroded much of the culture that we want to preserve . 
  catalonia has a different culture than the rest of spain ( excluding a part of aragon , val\u00e8ncia and balears ) , language , traditions , industry ( while spain tends to favour agriculture and foods , we develop tech industry ) and economy ( we are one of the richest regions in spain , and pay 14.000 m $ a year in taxes , 8 % of our gdp that does not get reinvested which gets sent to other regions . 
  this is the biggest `` solidarity '' percent in the world , literally ) . 
  among other things , like failure to comply with the investments that we were promised ( we are the only region that has frequent tolls on the highways since they were built with private capital due to lack of investment by madrid ) and constant threats to our culture and language plus a constant denial to talk or give us our right to self-determination have led us to this . 
  we 're only considering the unilateral declaration as a last resort option * beacause * spain does n't allow a referendum . 
  we do n't really like it either, 
  yep , you ca n't imagine how jealous am i. 
  it seems that the debate for a referendum is starting to begin in spain , but it might already be too little to late . 
  holy shit , a civil and coherent discussion about the right of self-determination . 
  * if only *, 
  ** catalan ** * gener : from `` janus '' , the roman god of begginings * febrer : from `` februar '' , a purification festival that happened on this month * mar\u00e7 : the month of the god of war `` mars '' * abril : from `` aperile '' , to open , since this was the month in which nature `` opened '' * maig : from `` maia '' , the roman godess of spring * juny : maybe from the godess `` juno '' or from `` junior '' in opposition to `` maig '' , the `` senior '' month . 
  ( iunor/maior ) * juliol : after * julius caesar * * agost : after * augustus * * setembre : the seventh roman month , comes from `` septem '' , `` seven '' * octubre : `` october '' , the eight * novembre : `` november '' , the ninth * desembre : `` december '' , the tenth, 
  oh i see , makes sense now, 
  oh really ? 
  a pintxo for me is a totally diferent thing , basically pieces of meat up a long stick, 
   there were no immediate reports of any casualties or major damage across spain 's southern coast early on monday after a major earthquake of magnitude 6.3 struck about 162 km ( 100 miles ) southeast of malaga . 
   the quake hit at 11.22 p.m. 
  et on sunday ( 0422 gmt ) , the spanish national geographic institute said , and was followed by six lesser aftershocks . 
  the u.s. geological survey had earlier reported the tremor had a magnitude of 6.6 and was registered at 33 km ( 20 miles ) deep . 
  [ just look at this trainwreck . 
  it 's pretty disgusting ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/42f8ff/denmark_clashes_erupt_as_counterdemo_meets_pegida/ ), 
  `` new left '' haahahaahahahah , yeah , whatever man , belive whatever makes you happy . 
  yeah , but this means that this sub is not only raided , but turned over to the stormfront already . 
  which i mean it was kinda obvious , but still sad, 
  those too !, 
  but i 've never had a better tapeo than the one i did in donosti ... and yes , i did try bilbo too :p, 
  best tapas in the state !, 
  and the beach is amazing !, 
   do you think racism is a problem in / r/europe ? 
   no 1177 56 % that self-awareness ... 
  yes , but since it 's impossible to go to the cinema without having it dubbed or with spanish subtitles , there 's not much that i can do . 
  oh well , i just stream them all at home and that 's it . 
  otherwise , i have to eat them in spanish ( beacause catalan dubbing is pretty crappy - though better than the shit it was before - / underdeveloped ) if i want to go to a decent cinema, 
  as i said , if you 're offended it 's not my problem , maybe you 're with pegida maybe you 're not . 
  what i do care about is that pegida , literally a fascist organization is capable of convincing people that they 're right and somehow able to solve the problem with * authoritarian solutions * , targetting the muslims in general . 
  like we have n't seen this before , oh , i wonder how the second time will go, 
  nationalism in catalonia usually is left to radical left wing and has pretty much fuck all in common with the rest of european nationalisms . 
  please at least know a * little * bit about what you 're talking about before typing, 
  nah , i assume that you agree with pegida beacause you yourself called a fascist , when i was talking about pegida .
