  do n't just avoid the obvious , the fact that you pretty much have their viewpoint on the state of things is quite telling . 
  if you really agree with them it 's your problem , not mine . 
  big difference between being a sheep and a shepherd though . 
  actually about that , you should really look at what the guy behind pegida did before creating that, 
  or you percieve anything left of the most radical right wing `` exteme left '' and are deluded as hell , not even being able to see * a literal fascist organization * as one . 
  fucking great , this continent is going to implode in shit . 
  does the guy who wrote this know at least * a little * bit of what he 's talking about ? 
  beacause if by `` consensus '' he means the bi-party system he 's an idiot or a sellout to pp-psoe, 
  this thread is a great example . 
  i ca n't belive how delusional people are . 
  oh , so pegida * are n't * fascists now ? 
  i mean , the truth is pretty obvious . 
  so what if we 're not americans ? 
  the nazis were n't americans too, 
  i still do n't even understand how pegida has n't been prosecuted for hate-speech . 
  or ridiculed for being literally fascists . 
  but hey , i guess that 's `` modern '' europe for you , people are back to the thirties . 
  check his flair now :p, 
   it is attacked unjustly like any other european country though . 
  we kinda * have * to be patriotic of our country if we want it to become independent . 
  nationalism in catalonia is really different than pretty much any other part of europe due to the secession process .

  please , we need a basque here and their crazy hillbilly sports, 
  as in , sold it off for nothing , with negative connotation . 
  is it that relevant though ? 
  it 's a metaphor, 
  well , they sold it for a bit of peacetime , even if it did n't last that much, 
  well then ... all of the guys that i 've met from there claim to hate this `` anticatalanism '' that the valencia city boys have going on , and are n't bothered by the whole `` catalan is valencian and viceversa '' thing . 
  but ya know, 
  you have n't been to castell\u00f3 , have you :p ? 
  [ legends/famous poet says that the mountain of the canig\u00f3 is the cradle of catalonia ] ( http://www.andorradirecte.com/imatges/noticies/canigo.jpg ) . 
  slight problem though ... beacause that 's in * northern * catalonia , sold off to france by spain in the xviith century . 
  the french then promtly erased much of our culture * in our own homeland , the rossell\u00f3 * . 
  so not great . 
  it 's exactly the same name as in catalan and spanish, 
  spanish for the bad things , catalan for the good :p although that video is a really good seller for independentism, 
  sadly , the same applies here with catalan and spanish : very rarely a foreigner ( or even a local ) will talk to you in catalan , at least in the cities, 
  that might be even more obvious true :d, 
  i mean , yes , his wife is romanian , but it 'd be if you did n't know that, 
  [ he rivals our top-level politicians !, 
  whoah ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdzhz5okpxw ), 
  our new president speaks some romanian , apart from french , english , catalan and spanish ( his wife is from there ! ) ... 
  pretty random , but cool !, 
   well , i think you are stretching it big time with your first answer . 
  i think the merger for jxsi was more esquerra and a few others compromising their left-wing politics in favour of power and hopefully not being punished for governing with mas . 
  rebranding in politics tends to work wonders . 
  i imagine you know better than i whether junts was a centre-left dominated coalition or not . 
  jxs is dominated by converg\u00e8ncia ( though after the last general elections in which erc dominated not so much , and that 's why they did n't want elections again ) and yes , they are not left-minded people , though also not right-wing . 
  cdc is not pp , despite what they might tell you . 
   his party is the party of the catalan bourgeoisie , and the cup have handed his party power at the expense of his presidency . 
  how does that help in your struggle against neo-liberalism ? 
  i mean not really , they got pretty much all of what they asked at the cost of giving two of their seats away ( which they can get back if things do n't go as promised ) . 
  getting rid of artur mas * is a huge milestone * , and leaves cdc quite weakened , but we 'll see more of him, 
  thanks !, 
  and me !, 
  goddammit , i should be studying right the hell now ... stupid politics ... 
  * look at me mum , i 'm reddit famous for something now !, 
  are you proud of me now ? 
  * ^ ^ / s ^ ^ :p, 
   or what do you expect to happen ? 
  them not breaking the agreement that they themselves forced on the cup and guarantees that they wo n't get wrecked on the next elections, 
   in as much a ventriloquist dummy makes its own speeches because you can see its lips moving . 
  and ? 
  that 's how pacts work . 
  do i really have to anwser to all of this demagogy ? 
  i 'm sorry , i have more important things to do , bring me some real arguments another day, 
   to me it seems like the cup has sacrificed itself for independence as has convergencia . 
  cup * does not give two seats for free * . 
  they can break the agreement and get them back , so it 's pretty safe to say that the pacts will go on ahead, 
   why the obsession with blocking mas in favour of a cdc clone ? 
  jxs is not even close to a cdc clone , let 's be real . 
  it 's a one time only party with the only objective of creating the republic of catalonia . 
  that ambition is shared with the cup , but whereas jxs is is more or less center-left politically speaking , cup is extreme left . 
  so you could say that i wanted to make the cup force a more socially active independentism compared to independence alone , which i think it 's something that we 've needed for a long time ago . 
   what was the point of your vote in your party to reject mas ? 
  serious questions . 
  while mas may not have any corruption case against him , there is a very real chance that he will have one open in the future , and that would probably be the end of independentism for a few years . 
  his party is the most corrupt catalan party and it represents the * establishment * and neoliberalism , he 's the head of all of that . 
  i do not want to risk even the slightest the chance to let this moment escape , since i sincerily belive that independence is the only option for the preservation of my culture and language . 
  spain has not and will not ever accept our nation status , and belive me , we 've tried too many times to count now to make them understand that . 
  mas has too many questions not anwsered and there is a real chance for him to fuck up , he has a big ghost following him . 
  i mean , in ~ ~ retrospective ~ ~ retrospect , they have been negotiating for 3 months . 
  it 's true , maybe the text it 's a bit excessive , but there have been mistakes, 
   come again ? 
  the only way cup could pressure jxs\u00ed to vote anything was by threatening to retire their support and force new elections if they did not . 
  cup just threw their only card down the toilet , rendering any deal void because cup no longer has leverage . 
  it all rests now on jxs\u00ed 's good faith and will to honor their word when everyone knows they have neither . 
  that 's like , you opinion man .
