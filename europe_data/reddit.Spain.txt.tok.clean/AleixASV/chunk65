  cup * does not give 2 seats to jxs , two of their mp will vote according to jxs * . 
  they can get them back and break the agreement too you know ? 
  this is not the time to go speculating about this , it 's kinda a moot point . 
   all i had to give them was our life savings , the deed to the house and a commitment of 10 trillion years of labor . 
  and when our galactic vehicle is complete , he will take us to our new home : blisstonia . 
  [ why of course !, 
  ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20140310/54402947586/margallo-una-cataluna-independiente-estaria-excluida-de-la-ue-durante-siglos.html ), 
  this agreement is to invest the president , not the plan of goverment . 
  rest assured, 
  nope . 
  they will give 2 seats to jxs to guarantee stability ( since this goverment independence , not normal goverment as its main goal , and that is needed as we have recently seen ) and expel the members who * are against a pact * , not mas , mas is out , due to the difficult circumstances that brought is here . 
  it would make 0 sense to have guys against the agreement working * in the agreement * . 
  cup is not neutered , they got most of what they wanted in the pact ( social policies etc ), 
  there would n't have been a social shock plan beacause it was probably the n. 1 condition of pact between the cup and jxs . 
  no pact , no plan , as simple as that . 
  just a standstill with parties waiting for the next elections and who know what would 've happened after those , since jxs would not exist then . 
   it is ridiculous . 
  it is not . 
  what you 're all forgetting here is that cup gets to impose a * huge * social shock plan that would n't have happened if there was no pact . 
  ( am happy cup voter , c'mon , ask me things ) . 
  also , it really does n't matter the spectrum of the different parties that get us a new state * once we get to vote the new government of that state * . 
  ideologies matter most when parties act on them , and creating a new state is surprisingly not an ideological act in a left-right sense , at least in the case of catalonia, 
  queeeeeeterunya triomfant, 
  less than 48h before all negotiations would 've ended ( after months of failed negotiations and new elections apparently inevitable ) !, 
  catalan politicians like the thrill of risk too much, 
  [ * heheheehehehehhe * ] ( http://images.ara.cat/politica/lalcalde-gallifa-jordi-fornas-acn_araima20130111_0115_20.jpg ) edit : since from some reason there is n't a picture of the mentioned portrait in the article , [ here 's ] ( http://www.ccma.cat/tv3/alacarta/telenoticies-comarques/lajuntament-de-torredembarra-exhibeix-la-foto-del-rei-de-mida-carnet/video/5576231/ ) the report from our national channel about it, 
  yep , here in catalonia both the caga ti\u00f3 and the reis are the gift bearers . 
  though some homes that are n't adapted into catalan culture celebrate santa, 
  de res !, 
  i 'm not really sure , probably pressure from the conservative sectors who , let 's be honest , are the ones that have the real power in jxs . 
  romeva said that he was n't the presidential candidate before the elections but people would n't mind it at all if he changed his mind . 
  he 'd be probably my first choice . 
  yeah , though surprisingly ( or not ) the far-left is also euro-sceptic , at least in catalonia, 
  sadly , jxs ( the majoritary independentist aglomeration ) has a lot of power not only politically , but also mediatically and they exerted a huge amount of preassure onto cup , trying to force their hand . 
  so they put practically all of independentism against them , and now that they 've seen that they ca n't do what they want they 're mad . 
  very mad . 
  yeah , i see your point , but many jxs voters were from converg\u00e8ncia who love their * president * . 
  they ca n't wrap their heards around why the cup did n't want to accept him and do n't even ask themselves why jxp did n't propose another candidate . 
  i fear that the internal stress inside the lines of the cup and many of their voters might cause some trouble , and that the party will be split between podemos and erc as you said . 
  no , i 'm not aligned with many of the policies from cup . 
  i 'm left leaning , * but not that left * . 
  no problem mate !, 
  sadly , you 'll soon ( next election in march i think ) see why it does n't happen often , they 'll probably get wrecked for sticking to what they said : /, 
  well , but if you * need * to make a deal with the cup and the cup 's sole reason for their recent surge to relevance is that they do n't want mas you * really ca n't put mas as the only candidate * . 
  probably coerced by the anc and much of the society , who value unity over what actually is going on with who get or does n't get power . 
  now , the independentists from cup that wanted a pact with mas will vote them though so in the end it worked out for them . 
  while people from podemos and other parties might appreciate it ( with an air of cynicism though ) they will never vote them * beacause they themselves are not independetists * , so either cup will dissapear or deflate due to extreme pressure from the majoritary indepenstist establishment and the flight of voters angry with the decision . 
  expect to see some people from the party leave too, 
  welp , they did what they promised and that 's why i voted them . 
  independence ca n't depend on a person , especially if his party and himself are of dubious circumstances in terms of corruption . 
  sad to see that the cup will probably recieve the short end of the stick for being honorable and get eaten by podemos plus they currently have internal turmoil and have angered the catalan establishment . 
  i guess that 's what happens when someone does what they said they 'd do in this country . 
  * ... that spain is a great nation and the spanish very spanish and much spanish . 
  thank you *, 
  i do n't buy that . 
  compared to other countries around here , what i posted can be even considered ` mild ' . 
  and now it 's wrong to talk about how the catalans lived under spanish opression for much of the xxth century ? 
  no matter how true it is ? 
  as far as i know * we did n't do the same for them *, 
  thank you !, 
  i put images related to catalonia ( not only barcelona ) and not in a particular sense as an olympic games , but a general one ( revolts , war , etc ) . 
  as far as i know , the demonstrations are * the opposite of oppresion * and the mancomunitat also is n't a sign of oppresion as far as i know , so i 'd say people only notice what they want . 
  but besides , is anything about what i said wrong ? 
  these things happened and beacause of what i said . 
  these things are also what i consider to be the 5 most important things to happen in the last 100 years in catalonia ( revolts -  mancomunitat -  civil war -  franco -  independentism ) and since it 's pretty subjective i find pretty retarded that people downvote me beacause `` hurr durr nazionalista '' . 
  but hey , this is not my first rodeo in / r/europe . 
  but you 're mistaking country and state !, 
  they have two different meanings , but since they usually correlate ( state is more or less the same as an * independent * country ) people do n't mind it too much and use one word or the other . 
  and i downvoted you for being rude and repetitive , the `` hurr durr catalonia is not a country '' is what made me put that text on my flair . 
  and yes , fuck them for ... being dependent on our money and not being able to develop their own economy as we did ? 
  alright then ... 
  oh , not that !, 
  i meant the flair * text *, 
  i mean , just check my flair mate :d !, 
  i just checked the numbers , it 's * the biggest in terms of % of people in the country that participated * . 
  my bad , it was poor wording, 
  at least the spanish trolls do n't go after the basques and downvote you to death for not being `` spain '' . 
  glad to see that they still respect one or two cultures inside their borders ... btw , even if it 's cheating since it 's not a picture , the painting of guernika is amazing, 
  yep !, 
  [ i also love the catalan way ] ( http://international.reagrupament.cat/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/cadenacatalana.jpg ) - human chain [ along more or less our coastal border ] ( http://www.manelpalencia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/viacatalana.jpg ) though sadly the pictures are n't as cool as the ones from the demonstrations :p !, 
  without a doubt , the best science museum that i 've ever visited ( yes , i 've been to the one in munich :p ) . 
  enormous , built [ in an under a modernist building ] ( http://www.vacacionesporeuropa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/cosmocaixa.jpg ) it 's [ just massive ] ( http://www.losapuntesdelviajero.com/wp-content/uploads/blogger/__cwnlexyiww/sg7bczdceni/aaaaaaaaam8/wdpg-ewbyyo/s1600/cosmocaixa3.jpg ) . 
  this is not just your normal for kids only sciences center ^ ( looking at you , glasgow ) . 
  [ wiki link ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/cosmocaixa_barcelona ) * the museum of national art of catalonia , [ mnac for short ] ( http://www.abc.es/media/201307/15/mnac1--644x362.jpg ) is probably the most emblematic museum of barcelona though . 
  it houses the biggest collection and best collection of romanesque art and catalan art in general in the world , with it 's [ jewel of the crown , the pantocrator of sant climent de ta\u00fcll ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/meister_aus_tahull_001.jpg/800px-meister_aus_tahull_001.jpg ) . 
  the views from the promenade are a [ must see anyway ] ( https://barcelonadesdelcel.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/vistas-mnac-barcelona.jpg ) though the interior [ is also amazing ] ( http://www.barcelonabook.com/uploads/9/2/8/1/9281695/2603923_orig.jpg ) * then you 've got [ the museu dal\u00ed over in figueres , which i think is the most visited museum in catalonia ] ( http://ca.visitfigueres.cat/upload/agenda/4-3.jpg ) . 
  the building itself is considered the biggest surrealist object in the world . 
  figures . 
  it holds works from every single artistic movement of the painter . 
  nearby you can visit his private home , now a museum [ in the town of portlligat ] ( http://www.travel-to-costa-brava.com/images/salvador-dali-museum-port-lligat.jpg ), 
   there was an armed organization that is demanding catalan independence they were a bunch of misfits in the 90 ' who at most captured a guy and shot him in the leg . 
  nothing more . 
  the only real terrorist organization in spain is eta , which was set up in the franco regime . 
  and yes , we the catalans have had it rough historically ( war of spanish succession , decreto de nueva planta , revolts in the xixth century , la setmana tr\u00e0gica , miguel primo de rivera , the civil war , franco , and more recently the constant economical and cultural struggle against madrid ), 
  it 's shown on january the 1st every year on statal public tv , and lots of people watch it , usually old people, 
  [ kinda more like this :p ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iynw5kovfxw ), 
  [ ahhh these guys !, 
  of course ! ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fvifdzisgo&amp;t=0m52s ) . 
  we have to sub them though , which is sad . 
  they are singing about the glorious death camps of the gulags in the urss are n't they ?
