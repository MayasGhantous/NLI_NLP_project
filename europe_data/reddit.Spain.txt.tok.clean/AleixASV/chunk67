  dunno really . 
  they tend to like charismatic leaders , and since they might not know many of them they just do n't like them, 
  spain hates pretty much everyone , except obama, 
  * de res !, 
  everyone speaks spanish , moreso than catalan . 
  yeah , there 's tales of people that ca n't speak spanish here , but it 's all propaganda from madrid . 
  in fact , it 's way more common that people * do n't speak catalan * , thanks to franco banning the language and heavy internal immigration in the 60 ' and 70 ' from other parts of spain , and those people have n't integrated at all into the catalan culture ( i live on one of those areas , i can testify for that ) . 
  on the other hand , with the restoration of the democracy , we made a big effort on making our educative system as good as possible and especially * as integrative as possible * . 
  now , every single child educated into our system speaks both catalan and spanish as good as we can teach them ( with one of the better grades in spanish compared to other regions and decent-to-excellent catalan depending on the area ) . 
  of course , the politicians in madrid do n't like this , and even nowadays they 've been trying to remove catalan from our educative system as much as they can ( wert law , etc. 
  ) , and they 're trying to turn our situation to somewhat the one in euskadi , where many people ca n't speak euskera . 
  they 're specially mad with the main principle that we use to teach catalan the `` immersion '' , in which all public teachers must only use catalan regardless of the area or subject ( except english and spanish of course ) , and they want to force them to use spanish too , even though * spanish does not need protection and in fact there 's no area in catalonia where kids do n't already speak it , which is not the case with catalan * . 
  so , the sociolinguistic situation is this : 78 % of the people in catalonia speak catalan , whereas for spanish is almost a 100 % . 
  in val\u00e8ncia and balears though , where these policies sadly have n't been applied so thoroughly , it 's a 53 % of people who speak it for the former and a 73 % for the latter ( arguably , the resentment toward any kind of catalan culture in val\u00e8ncia has only hurt themselves , since they despise their own language . 
  i even saw politicians literally * apologising * for speaking valencian - catalan , it 's the name that the languages recieves there - , though that was in a congress full of right-wing - pp - people , so no big surprise ), 
  catalonia : catalan since 4yo . 
  spanish since 6yo . 
  english since 8yo ( though now it 's 6yo ) german since 14yo . 
  home , jo els he vist parlant de les 5,6 o 7 com a afternoon . 
  una frase inconexa en un article de wikipedia no em sembla prou conclusiu , per\u00f2 \u00e9s possible que tinguis ra\u00f3 , no ho s\u00e9 . 
  huh . 
  google traductor em diu que dinner = sopar . 
  that 's weird i guess ... 
  i 'm from barcelona too , so i do n't know, 
  i have friends from vic and that area that sing it like that !, 
  maybe it changes depending on your area ? 
  they 're on the inside here too , usually, 
  [ doooo iit !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-bcow4ap88 ), 
  actually * really * surprised that the rest of europe does n't use them . 
  and annoyed . 
  for fucks sake , i ca n't stand sleeping with early morning light !, 
  first time i 've heard about this, 
  i guess it 's an * adquired taste * . 
  maybe do n't send chocolates too :d, 
  catalan traditions * best traditions * :p, 
  goooood . 
  one day , wander around near the market in sagrada fam\u00edlia . 
  ( shit log !, 
  log of christmas !, 
  do n't shit herring , it 's too salty !, 
  shit nogat , which is much tastier ! ) . 
  and yes , * i 've sung that and literally every single catalan as a kid * . 
  this is not all though , have i told you the tale of the [ caganer ] ( http://cdnb.20m.es/yaestaellistoquetodolosabe/files/2010/12/caganer.jpg ) ? 
  these guys clearly just want the sensationalist titles and have n't even looked at spain in a year, 
  the traditional dishes for * christmas lunch * ( we do n't have dinner ) in catalonia are [ escudella ] ( http://www.vilaweb.cat/media/continguts/000/019/791/thumbnails/thumb_474__4.jpg ) and [ tall rod\u00f3 ] ( https://posarcullerada.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/p3090029.jpg ) . 
  then , the 26th ( sant esteve ) we have another lunch , in which we eat dishes that were traditionally made with the remains of the food of the 25th !, 
  those are [ canelons ] ( http://www.housesforyou.es/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/canelons.jpg ) ( from the tall rod\u00f3 ) and [ carn d'olla ] ( http://www.gallinablanca.es/files/uploads/captura%20de%20pantalla%202014-06-18%20a%20les%2010_31_35.jpg ) , literally `` meat of the pot '', 
  i mean , * vivan las quimeras * right ? 
  too much * jam\u00f3n serrano * ? 
  :p yeah , madrid 's is n't anything out of the ordinary , but hey . 
  i almost never use them though so yeah, 
  it has always been this way though . 
  and not only with erc . 
  there are 3 more parties with less votes than erc and more mps than iu, 
  all to erc . 
  i just want santiago vidal laughing at the fachas who wanted to jail him for writing on a paper, 
  just voted ... ehh ... hmm erc does n't have a fruit . 
  shit, 
  built with * muh * money !, 
  welcome to southern europe !, 
  it 's kinda chilly for me :p, 
  i guess that being from barcelona i 'm used to it and i do n't appreciate it that much , but madrid-barajas is more pleasant architectonically speaking for me . 
  the layout is really good too , you do n't need to use shuttles except from changing terminals , it 's nice . 
  what about them ? 
  i 've been to granada , m\u00e1laga , madrid , etc. 
  and they 're pretty much the same culture honestly , compared to the cities here . 
  and i say that , living in one of the most `` spanish-fied '' cities in catalonia , it * still * is much more distinct than them , you can see it 's part of the catalan culture despite the heavy spanish influence, 
  you have more cultural impact in galicia than in a random mid-sized catalan city like vic ? 
  where there 's literally no one speaking spanish ? 
  big cities like barcelona and madrid look alike , but so do paris , london , etc. 
  just beacause it 's a case-by-case situation means that i ca n't answer for team : i only knew the specifications of catalonia, 
  go seek them . 
  i do n't answer for them, 
  the people that live in it and the recognition of the rest of the world . 
  saying `` i am a nation '' ignores the fact that nations are more than an aglutination of people : they rule land and have a set of laws : they are sovereign, 
  the full name is self determination of nations . 
  is your family a nation ? 
  this is so wrong on so many accounts that i wo n't even respond . 
  catalan very similar or almost the same as valencian ? 
  * they 're the same fucking languange * ... not more unique than andalucian ? ... 
  my god . 
  yeah , whatever, 
  since when ? 
  ** what we wanted was a referendum **, 
   answer this question : did catsiqueespot support independence ? 
  this does not matter ** when the outcome of a referendum is only either yes or no ? ** . 
  they explictly said that they did n't want to be counted on either side , so either you read it as an election or a referendum . 
  we won the referendum * and the election * , since we hold the majority on the parliment and the majority of votes among the parties who participated * in the plebiscite which catsiquespot refused * . 
  it 's up to the people living there to decide if they 're different enough and they want out . 
  however , i 'd really doubt that you could mistake an italian for an spanish , a portuguese from a french or a catalan from a greek . 
  only pp and a few other parties deny the fact that catalonia is a nation , the mainstream media is even starting to accept it again , since before franco this was n't even a question . 
  it was clearly an election , a ** plebiscitary election ** beacuse you did n't let us organize a referendum . 
  that means that non-aligned parties did n't count for either yes or no . 
  ** is it so hard to comprehend that we won ? 
  catalonia is a nation , that 's not subjective , we have our own culture , language , history , laws , etc. . we have made polls that say that 80 % of the population want a referendum , and one of the main points of discussion of the previous elections was the * fact of organizing one * . 
  he 's trying to derrail , we 're way past discussing things like that here . 
  hahahaahahahahaha do n't worry , do n't worry , we accounted for that !, 
  democracy works around even lower numbers usually , and counting total population does n't really make sense , beacause it also accounts for kids/immigrants/etc . 
  who ca n't vote,
