  the right of self-determination * of peoples * is a right recognised by the foundational charter of the united nations . 
  do n't justify antidemocratic practices . 
  catalonia demanded and demands a referendum * and you know it * . 
  either way , pointless arguments such as yours wo n't get you anything , we 're way past this crap here . 
   but you can keep democracy from yourselves when it suits you , declaring a self-proclaimed referendum as won with 47 % of the votes . 
  against 39 % ? 
  absolutely . 
  you just assumed that . 
  either way , we already voted and we got a majority , such is the price spain will pay for not allowing us a proper referendum . 
   do tell me where i lied . 
  right here : `` the parties that did n't support independence got 53 % of the votes . '', 
  * if you do n't support independence in a referendum , you 're against it * . 
  either this was a referendum or local elections , and `` i do n't care '' votes do n't count for either side , so `` did n't support independence '' is not an option . 
  you should be the one working on reading comprehension . 
  or was that an intentional mistake to try to bunch catsiquespot with the unionists ? 
   i already counted the cup votes in the 47 % , and you know that . 
  oh really ? 
  let 's read again : `` as it stands : pro-independence parties touted this election as a referendum since day one , joined in a single list called `` together for yes '' '' . 
  i do n't see cup mentioned there ... huh . 
   the pro-independence parties used the election as a referendum , did n't get 50 % of the votes , then decided to use the number of mps ( but wait , was n't this a referendum ? ) . 
  we got more than 50 % in favour of independence , you yourself acknowledged that !, 
  you do n't want to accept it of course , but 47 % vs 39 % is more than 50 % of the votes for independence . 
  we used it as a referendum as you said , so that 's how it should be counted , and abstentions , like blank votes , are nullified . 
  the right to self-determination is a basic democratic human right recognised by the united nations charter :  chapter 1 , article 1 , part 2 states that purpose of the un charter is : `` to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples , and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace . '', 
  it is one of the foundational rights . 
  you ca n't keep democracy from us . 
  yay for basic , recognised human rights such as selfdetermination right ? 
   the parties that did n't support independence got 53 % of the votes . 
  catsiqespot was not a pro-independence party . 
  they 're certainly not unionist , but did not support independence either . 
  this is an outright lie . 
  catsiqueespot * explicitly said that they were non-aligned * . 
  that means * abstention * , neutral . 
  * you ca n't count them in one side or the other just beacause you want to * . 
   as it stands : pro-independence parties touted this election as a referendum since day one , joined in a single list called `` together for yes '' , failed to get a majority of the votes for yes , and then decided they 'd won anyway and went ahead with their plan . 
  this is another lie : there is another independentist party , `` cup '' that allowed them to get the absolute majority of mp which we now hold . 
  please , stop spreading crap . 
  thank you . 
  you 're reading it as if it was * an official referendum * . 
  ** we would have loved that ** . 
  we were n't allowed one though , that means that unaligned parties participated and got votes . 
  if you read it as a referendum , it was a clear independentist victory , beacause the unionists got ** 39 % **, 
   also i do n't know how passionate about independence the catalonian are , but the constant shut down of the referendum could lead to a new eta forming , although i think that a referendum of such proportions should have a turnout of at least 90 % in the region ( as opposed the ~ 40 % the 2014 one had [ 1 ] ) , when scotland voted they did n't go independent ( they almost did ) but at least the people had a say in it , unlike here . 
  you 're mistaken on both accounts though !, 
  we had a terrorist organization in the 90 ' ( terra lliure ) and it failed miserably . 
  we 're * not * violent people , and eta only existed as a continuation of the maquis of the civil war , they could n't be set up today too . 
  on the second account , you 're wrong beacause the 40 % participation was n't for the referendum which we organized under the guise of local election this september , which got a participation of 77,45 % , the biggest after the restoration of democracy . 
  the 40 % was for a * consultive popular process * , some sort of `` training '' that we did , and it worked really well at that . 
  after all though , we won the referendum ( since catalunyasiqueespot did n't align either with the independentists or the unionists ) and we have an independentist majority in the parliment . 
  the only reason we are n't advancing much in our proclamation of independence is beacause of internal power struggles , we 'll see how they get solved ( if they even do ), 
  it 's what erc did in the previous legislature here in catalonia with less political fallout and it 'd more or less keep their facade of a `` centralist party '', 
  i did n't say that they needed to be in government though, 
  [ just look at this map . 
  it would n't be the first time ] ( http://kaosenlared.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/11390094_1613557782254666_2116450268810451380_n.jpg ), 
  government either pp alone with support from c 's in the parliment or as a coalition . 
  they 'd sell their soul ( if they even have one ) just for a bit of power, 
  and for example , when i speaking catalan i * always get mistaken for an italian * . 
  always, 
  square catalonia is best catalonia, 
  spanish nationalist do n't really understand catalonia , so they do n't like us . 
  simple as that . 
  they pretend we 're just a region, 
  points at pujol only . 
  if this problem was as he says it is , tolls would be widespread in spain . 
  they are n't . 
  probably it means that you 're pretending to be someone who does n't understand what the people are talking about , who does n't speak the language and so using it as an excuse for , for example , not paying the metro ticket knowing fully well that you should when confronted upon, 
  ignorante, 
  catalan : fer-se el suec -  to pretend to be a sweede : to try to evade your responsabilities :p, 
  hahaahahahaahahahahaha of couuuurse my friend of course !, 
  paco ( franco for the foreigners ) definitely loved the catalans !,

  hmmm not necessairly : brutalism had its time and place , and it really produced some beautiful buildings . 
  but yes , if a country has 0 ties to its parliment , then the architect has failed . 
  after all , * it 's supposed to be the house of the people * . 
  it was built as the queen 's palace !, 
  but she did n't like it , so we housed democracy instead !,

  the style is inspired by the catalan [ `` masia '' ] ( http://c3e308.medialib.glogster.com/luciamallen98/media/ab/ab15a67df16e49eb5413365f4a032ad81028e6c8/masia.jpg ) , which could be translated to `` farmhouse '' more or less . 
  we do n't have the monies !, 
  though i think it 's an stylistic decision . 
  there 's some gardens of the same period in barcelona that all have this kind of green water, 
  they do n't like * fake countries * i guess :p, 
  oh , so you 're telling me that pp * is not * corrupt ? 
  you know why we do have tolls right ? 
  beacause there was * no * public investment and they were built from loans to entities like abertis , * who got rich as fuck as a result of that * . 
  they were n't the cause , but a consequence . 
  no we ca n't . 
  we have one of the highest debts in all of spain and we are being held hostage with the fla. . plus paying 8 % of the gdp is literally one of the highest fiscal imbalances * in the whole word * . 
  you pay for your deficit , not us . 
  i mean , it 's not that i 'm obessed , i * did n't start the discussion anyway * . 
  i do n't like my money given away and not having my democratic rights respected, 
  and you are ignoring the fact that here things are more expensive and we get taxed more, 
  hahahaahahahaah yeah , using logical fallacies now , are n't we ? 
  oh i 'm sorry grandad , i did n't recognise you : * after all , everyobody knows that conservatives do n't use the pc * . 
  and still , you did n't rebuke my points . 
  great , just great . 
  what a fucking joke of a country . 
  [ let 's throw in another one : red highways have tolls , green ones do n't ] ( http://webs.xadica.cat/madafaka/enlluita/peatges/peatges.gif ), 
  oh yeah , how could i not see that ?
