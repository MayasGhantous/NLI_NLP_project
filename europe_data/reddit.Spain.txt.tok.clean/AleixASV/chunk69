  my tribe !, 
  so that 's the poor excuse you give me to us giving you 7-8 % of our gdp every year ( roughly 15.000 m $ ) while we 're one of the most indebt communities * while * `` supporting us '' with the fla , basically overruling any democratic decision that the catalan people takes in favour of direct control from madrid `` beacause we ca n't be trusted with money '' . 
  [ meanwhile , in a completely imaginary `` social '' state ] ( http://www.carlosblanco.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/comparativa-barcelona-madrid.jpg ) ... 
  not this shit again ... :d !, 
  i mean , just look at my flair , you 'll get an idea of you many times i 've been told that, 
  so : bow over and give us ~ ~ your ~ ~ our monies , our region is deficitary . 
  got it . 
  so much for wanting to accomodate catalonia into the state , not even * what we wanted instead of independence , in 2012 !, 
  is too much . 
  excellent summary !, 
  it 's 100 % on point !, 
  i understand , plus we did not suffer mass immigration as you did or the famine . 
  though we did have our language , laws and all of our governments banned ( as per right of conquest ) for centuries , then suffered represion ( with brief interruptions ) until 1975 . 
  and arguably , it has n't stopped that much , that 's why we want to be independent . 
   i know that sadly asturian is a minority language that will probably disappear . 
  you should strive to keep it !, 
  catalonia was conquered at the same time as ireland , at roughly the beggining of the xviiith century , and while they did mostly lose it , despite having our language literally banned we strived and mantained it !, 
  it is not impossible !, 
  i do not really think that the catalan culture is part of the spanish one . 
  if that were the case , why all of the persecution and attacks against our language ( historical and current ) , why did wert wanted to `` espa\u00f1olizar a los alumnos catalanes '' ? 
   i do n't know if you ever been in asturias . 
  i 'd love to , that 's for sure . 
  i 've traveled a decent amount in spain , but i 've never been to asturias, 
  i 'm not talking about that though . 
  for being a nation , one thing that really helps is having your own majoritary language . 
  now , do n't get me wrong , i 'm totally not against asturias being one , but it really does n't seem that different from the `` normal '' spanish culture . 
  in fact , i 'd even say its part of it !, 
  asturian is one of the terms used to refer to astur leon\u00e9s . 
  it 's the same language , its says so on both your article and mine . 
  i 'm not despising it , but comparing a 140.000 speakers to an 11m like catalan and putting us on the same level is kinda dishonest, 
  [ astur leonese is the name of the language ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/idioma_asturleon%c3%a9s ) . 
  and by regional , i mean minoritary . 
  astur leonese is minoritary and its culture regional . 
  it sadly does n't amount to the level of a full fledged nation, 
  i 'd say asturias is the crib of the castilian nation , even if it definitely has some disctinctive traits : they really do n't amount to the extent of being considered a nation . 
  le\u00f3n is n't definitely one : compare the difference between castille and le\u00f3n and between france and germany . 
  it 's not even close . 
  navarra well ... 
  i 'd say a part of it is part of euskadi , like a part of val\u00e8ncia shares its culture with catalonia , but nothing else . 
  being a nation or not is n't a black and white , but there 's definetely stronger shades, 
  each with it 's own language , culture and independent history from the rest of spain . 
  there are no other cases, 
  i mean , you can ignore your own constitution , that 's true . 
  it 's not like we are n't doing it here either, 
  i do n't , you 're right . 
  our laws do, 
  one is a nation , the others are n't , with maybe the exception of galicia . 
  if you want to have a national selection it 's a no brainer :p, 
   yeah , maybe i 'm one of that fascist spanish , right ? 
  i hate rm , so i think i 'm not a rm fan . 
  whoah whoah whoah , do n't get ahead of yourself !, 
  are asturias or andalusia nations ? 
  nope . 
  is galicia a nation ? 
  debatable . 
  is catalonia a nation though ? 
  definetely . 
  so yep , we 're pretty much covered in the two things needed to have a * national * selection : a good team * and national backing *, 
   catalonia is not the center of the world . 
  in terms of football yes , yes it is . 
  too bad , maybe you 're from rm ? 
  i mean , those regions that you 've mentioned do n't stand a chance . 
  name some word class players from them ( if you even can ) , half of the spanish squad is just catalans, 
  what right ? 
  i 'm not only talking about that , but competivity . 
  the catalan talent is on another planet and you know it . 
  besides , even northen ireland competes , if one of those regions wants to compete what 's the problem ? 
  like any of those regions could compete ( or have any significant football history ) , maybe the basque country is the only exception, 
  i know that feeling ... though at least you guys are n't in the same boat as us : only allowed to play * a match per year * . 
  it 's a joke, 
  oh no , i can see why you 'd see it that way, 
  what i meant by that is that there 's precedent for recent big terror attacks on spain, 
  aznar actually was the third wheel in the coalition between blair and bush , we got the biggest terrorist attack in the history of europe beacause of that, 
   what 's more one can do after autonomy is n't enough anymore like in scotland , catalonia or flanders ? 
  expecting london or madrid ( brussels is an ever more complex problem i 'm not going to touch ) to just let their territory go is unrealistic . 
  oh is it now ? 
  well then , i guess we 've gone back like 200 years in time , where people 's opinions do n't matter and democracy did n't factor in . 
  very cool , where do i get my sword ? 
  i do n't even know :d !, 
  it 's funny though , he still has n't rebutted what i said, 
  i mean , i kinda told you that from the start ... bon mat\u00ed !, 
  we 've got the best embotit though !, 
  pepperoni tastes like plastic compared to it !, 
  i gave you the references of the books , if you just google ` crema catalana ' plus the book you 'll see it . 
  and you were the one who claimed that it was french in the first place , so yeah . 
  this is n't the first time that i 've had this conversation , i 've already seen those links and no , when you 've got probably the * oldest romance language cuisine book supporting you * it 's pretty hard to lose . 
  seriosuly , you would n't call a pizza french , it 's the same deal with crema catalana, 
  nope . 
  it 's actually one of the oldest recorded dishes on europe , there 's * zero * discussion about it . 
  the fact that you stole it and marketed as yours does n't make any difference . 
  it 's not the same dish anyway , the recipe is different ( the chef toned the flavour down to make it `` palatable '' for the king ) . 
  ** [ crema catalana is mentioned in this book ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/llibre_de_sent_sov%c3%ad ) from 1324 ( from an oldest text written in 1313 ) ** . 
  one of the oldest cooking books in a romance language in existence , by the way . 
  and in [ this one ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/llibre_del_coch ) , which it 's oldest suriving copy is from 1520 . 
   various sources so , sources ? 
  i mean ... yes ... ^ yes ^ of ^ course, 
  ehhhhhhhhhh ... they 've got pizzas i guess ... all the mediterranean claims to have the best food though, 
  oh i know , i went to both places , just one after the other . 
  telling people in glasgow that i came from edinbourgh quickly made them say `` and is n't glasgow clearly better ? '', 
  creme brulee is actually a pretty crappy copy ( no offence , it 's pretty dull , too much meddling on the recipe ) of our dish , which is even documented in several medieval books !,
