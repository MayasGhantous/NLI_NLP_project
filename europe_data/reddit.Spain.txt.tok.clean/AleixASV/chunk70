  it has our name for a reason you know ? 
  oh yeah it rained a ton . 
  only 2 out of 9 days were rain-free . 
  i got used to it fast though , survival insticts kicking in . 
   which explains why everyone thinks it looks like spiky shite from everywhere else ... yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyeah  and since i 'm fae there ... i kinda have to talk shite aboot mah city ya ken ? 
  ( unless we 're comparing it to glasgow in which case ye dinnae talk shite aboot edinburgh ) i mean , they do n't have a castle do they now ? 
  but i mean , it was 16\u00ba ... 
  it was n't summer ... * was it ? 
  * oh , and i 'm not saying that it has some flaws ( being so `` metaphorical '' to the point of losing all meaning is one ) but thing is , it was designed to be seen from the path to arthur 's seat , it has to look cool from up there ... the gardens were nice too , and there was free wifi !, 
  besides , i 'm very into architecture and since the guy was a catalan who * graduated from my school * well ... 
  i kinda have to defend him ya know ? 
  and a great neighbour :p !, 
  fucking amazing weather , the best coast in all of europe ( [ costa brava ] ( http://cache-graphicslib.viator.com/graphicslib/destination/costa-brava-134309.jpg ) ) , big mountains [ in less than a two hour drive distance ] ( http://www.komandokroketa.org/pica_d_estats/13montcalm-pica_dsd_sotllo.jpg ) , [ crema catalana and the catalan cuisine ] ( http://blogs.gamefilia.com/files/imce/u355553/crema_catalana.jpg ) , [ spanish , french and italian cuisine by proxy - we 're in the middle ! - ] ( http://www.claror.cat/sites/default/files/styles/larevista_article_detall/public/99f_pernl.jpg?itok=rftstyzs ) and [ the best city in the planet ] ( https://media.timeout.com/images/101851347/image.jpg ), 
  yeah , alright , whatever . 
  you can play with words all you like , does n't make it any less true . 
  obviously , nationality does n't equate nation : what you 're writing there is your state of procedence , which is in this case spain . 
  the fact that catalonia is a nation is n't disputed though . 
  i mean , you yourself can look up the definition of `` country '' , it 's pretty clear . 
  i did elaborate , i explained that such a term came from the reactionary right-wing that wanted to diminish the importance of the several nations inside spain after franco 's death . 
  the outside is amazing !, 
  i went there this summer and looking it up from that volcano thing-y that they have it 's beautiful !, 
   that applies to almost every single community of spain . 
  even worse , it applies to spain as a whole , including catalonia inside it . 
  it applies to almost all us states , it applies basically to any country with a federal structure . 
  you know fully well that the coummunities * are n't * countries , they have a shared culture and no majoritary unique language or historical precedent , among others , and that the powergrab of the transition was the only thing that led to their creation . 
  the only regions that could be considered a country in spain would be galicia , the basque country and catalonia ( and we could make a case for val\u00e8ncia and balears ) . 
  we 're not talking about any legal definition beacause * there 's * no place for them in the spanish structure , it 's not mentioned anywhere . 
  it 's all comunities , which obviously not always equate to countries . 
  however , these `` historical nationalities '' ( the bullshit name that some reactionary - or worse - came up with ) literally can be translated to country without losing any meaning . 
  * why do you think that euskadi means `` basque country then ? 
  * it 's pretty obvious . 
   so , i 'm all for nationalism , think whatever you want , but man , do n't be dishonest . 
  you 're the one being dishonest . 
  you know fully well that there 's no place in the spanish territorial system for countries like there 's one in the uk or that these `` historical nationalities '' are bullshit terminoligy such as designating catalan as `` lapao '' in aragon to not give us recognition there . 
  this is one of the things that 's wrong with spain , how do you want us the catalans to stay in your * state * ( which is what spain is btw ) if you do n't even acknowledge us ? 
   because i think the scottish parliament looks awesome  purely aesthetics  and guess who built that ? 
  yep , a catalan :p, 
  yes we are , at least under the catalan meaning of the word , that is : holds land and has it 's own set of laws , government and culture ( plus language in our case ! ) . 
  that 's also why the basques live in the basque * country * for example . 
  in any case , we 're a nation , and that 's accepted even by the spanish constitutional tribunal , who are probably the most reactionary bunch of people in spain . 
  ** anyway ** , our parliment ( which was built as a royal palace ) if fucking * beautiful * so [ here 's ] ( http://api.ning.com/files/dipg1lx-o2hud-wvyoq8lyslu0xuktbmayncou16lkg-v2j*fpnas8ixwcaige5mey2gkejpus2i4kxjslgaotddcbea4e54/parlament4117pdx2.jpg ) some [ pictures ] ( http://ediciones.la22.org/9n2014/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2014/11/foto-parlament.jpg ) of [ the thing ] ( http://d1abj31dnwl5uq.cloudfront.net/imatges/53/90/alta/780_0008_5390534_7e3f8566913d2c4bc398907b69a66411.jpg ) [ for reference ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3175/3016236806_2d14a8dda6_b.jpg ), 
  [ i mean , the english article is a bit shitty , but you get the point ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_company ) . 
  sacking the byzantines before it was cool . 
  ... welp , what a mess ^ ^ ^ :p, 
  i mean , here it only snows like once every three years or something , so yeah ... 
  the price we pay for having great weather :p, 
  historically industrialized and rich areas such as catalonia/euskadi vs the south which depends on agriculture . 
  so a north south divide aswell . 
  [ this is the map ] ( http://alumnos.unir.net/cesarolano/files/2013/02/epa-3t-2012-tasa-de-paro-por-comunidades.png ) . 
  catalonia has more unemployment due to having much much more population than the basque country though , and it 's fiscal system it 's way worse than the basques ( one of the main demands of independentists ) , which puts the economy under heavier stress . 
  it 's not the view of someone or the other when that view is by definition antidemocratic and it does n't respect the human rights charter ( under which selfdetermination of nations is recognised ) . 
  more mature democracies ( with more mature populations that are used to being in a democracy , like the uk ) respect those rights . 
  not allowing referendums does n't mean that they are anti-democratic , it means that they are * less * democratic . 
  referendums are one of the best expressions from the populace , and forbidding them clearly is n't a democratic move . 
  [ i 'm referring to this ] ( https://translate.google.cat/translate?hl=ca&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fes.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fdesaparecidos_del_franquismo ) . 
  by `` missing '' they mean dead and buried next to a random road . 
  the spanish government * does not allow * proper burials for them and the president has explicitly mocked the relatives of those people saying that they do n't deserve any money either for finding them or buring them properly, 
  and many others do . 
  democratic quality is not black and white , and there are many factors involved , that 's why i gave more examples . 
  still , nowadays they de facto forbid * any * referendum at all . 
  what happened here was that the fascists won . 
  in the transition , many of them were allowed to continue ruling , and under the guise of `` new times '' key sectors and especially the ruling elites stayed almost the same . 
  that 's why there 's a very strong reactionary ideology against basically democratic principles such as a referendum , demonstrating or as i said , giving a proper burial to the hundreds of thousands of people that were just buried in a random ditch, 
  not allowing referendums , limiting rights for demonstrations , having the world 's 2nd amount of people buried wherever and not allowing them a proper burial , etc. 
  it is a democracy , but a very poor one at that, 
  [ the simpsons did it before ] ( http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/simpsons-mr-burns-blocks-out-the-sun1-640x353.jpg ), 
  no catalan ? 
  * how dare you *, 
  is n't the poorest city sant adri\u00e0 and then santa coloma de gramenet ? 
  does badia count as a city ? 
  anyway , speaking from someone that grew up in santa coloma , the city is n't that bad . 
  i mean , yeah , there 's places where you would n't go alone at night and there 's literally streets with nothing but chinese on them , but it could be way worse, 
  nope , catalan invention , one of the few that really matter . 
  the inventor 's name was narc\u00eds monturiol, 
  maybe he got tired of trying to make it fly and threw it into the sea ? 
  [ or the ictineo ii !, 
  i mean , we the catalans invented the modern submarine so we at least got this one ... literally the first ever . 
  you all are jealous and a bunch of copycats ] ( http://7www.ecestaticos.com/imagestatic/clipping/715/782/c59/715782c59c0561e9b6ce0f3d522c32f1.jpg?mtime=1409320855 ), 
  there 's idiots everywhere , though in catalan it sounds like some fucked-up poem . 
  anyway , let 's not start the shitfest [ beacause we would win by a landslide ] ( https://twitter.com/heroisindepes/media ) . 
  edit : it 's a poem from 1901 * when we were treated as second-class citizens for the mere fact of being catalan * . 
  barcelona was called `` the rose of fire '' just beacause of how many protests there were , it does n't surprise me in the least that someone would write this . 
  yep !, 
  i doooo n't really think that 's true . 
  i saw another map and it had estrella damm , which is more plausible i think, 
  really cool video !, 
  i only wanted to watch it for a few seconds but i got stuck on it and watched it until the end :p, 
   spain has a corrupt government : in catalonia the corruption is even stipulated in a percentage . 
  [ this is not true , catalonia is one of the least corrupt comunities in spain . 
  the media likes to spin it a lot , but it 's all smoke . 
  and i 'm not a converg\u00e8ncia voter by the way . 
  ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uqhzd9ygcgo/ufdw6ro2kmi/aaaaaaaaapy/l_tzszksr84/s1600/corrupcion+ccaa.jpg )  spain has successful sportsmen : a disproportionate amount of them are catalan . 
  or you could see it as this : spain host hostage the catalan team , only letting it play against minor states like nigeria * and it only allows a match per year * . 
  which is shameful , compared to wales or scotland , which have their own teams and are allowed to compete . 
  we do n't have a national team beacause * we ca n't have one * . 
   the spanish currency , the only one that spaniards have used in the whole country pre euro , has a catalan name . 
   spain has received many immigrants recently : catalonia has received more than the average proportion . 
  and we 're proud of that !, 
   catalonia is hyperspain , and therefore it wants to secede , like most spanish territories have tried during the course of history . 
  i do n't have a particular opinion on independence , but when i read that famous `` catalonia is not spain '' sign , i started to think about it and it 's right .
