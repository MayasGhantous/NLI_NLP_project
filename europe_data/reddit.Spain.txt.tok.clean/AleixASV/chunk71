  catalonia is not spain , it 's the very essence of spain , condensed , and unsuccessfully trying to spread to the rest of the country . 
  it would make more sense though that catalonia is * very * catalan and its `` essence '' has spread a bit toward the rest of the state . 
  after all , we 're where much of the wealth has always started be it beacause of our trading empires , heavy industrialitzation or successful tourism ( those japanese yens !, 
  ) , tactics which have been then more or less succesfully imitated among the rest of the comunidades . 
  i do n't know how to respond to that . 
  i mean , there 's hiperspaniards , we call them `` fachas '' sure , but apart from that ? 
  nope, 
  not directly though . 
  many terrorist organizations in the west did get indirect help from the soviets , but rarely direct, 
  never said that we do n't have some things in common :p, 
   i certainly think barcelona will be pleased with madrid sticking its head above the parapet here , in the hope madrid gets one right between the eyes . 
  what in the fuck . 
  we like to joke about nucking madrid ... * but never seriously * . 
  we do n't hate spaniards , we hate their government, 
  and spain ( eta ), 
  also eta , which is a big chunk of that graphic as far as i know did n't get help from the soviets, 
  but when we 'll say gr\u00e0cies ? 
  :( i guess * thank you * works aswell, 
  that 's beacause it is , investment has grown [ more than ever in 2015 ] ( https://translate.google.cat/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ca&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.lavanguardia.com%2feconomia%2f20150921%2f54435397495%2fla-inversion-extranjera-y-las-exportaciones-se-disparan-en-catalunya.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ), 
  it 's the 16th most spoken language in europe , with more speakers than finnish , danish , etc. 
  ( which are on the list ) !, 
  we 've got over 11m speakers so we do kind of represent a chunck of europe 's diversity . 
  and what about it ? 
  we do n't hate spain , we just want our own country . 
  after all , the biggest independentist coalition is called `` togheter for the yes '', 
  catalan : * units en la diversitat !, 
  it 's not really clear yet . 
  maybe romeva, 
  in order to secure the transition to the catalan state , which is what all of this is about, 
  it was expected . 
  in order to gain the thrust of the cup ( the other independentist party ) and have an absolute majority of independentists in our parliment , * he must not * be president . 
  we ca n't rely on one person who comes from the most corrupt party in catalonia to push through all of this , the independence is made * with everyone for everyone * . 
  yep !, 
  they tried to make the dumb kids * like * to read appealing to them with that . 
  the result ? 
  the two or three who liked reading made us despise it for a while ( or ignore those books and move on ) and the `` dumb '' ( or not so dumb ) just read the summary online, 
  i mean , it 's not like what they made us read was any good though . 
  living in the redbelt around barcelona ( hospitalet , santa coloma , sant adri\u00e0 ) where most of the people do n't even talk in catalan in their normal life means that you do n't read rodoreda , you read [ this crap ] ( http://www.edetiendas.com/imagenes/la-banda-de-la-placeta-11876.jpg ) . 
  so yeah , great , i did n't have to hate them since they did n't even make us try !, 
  yep !, 
  rodoreda is amazing , but quite complex . 
  it 's hard to grasp on a first read honestly . 
  ausias march welp ... he 's a bit of an older style . 
  and yeah , i * hated * every single book that they made us read on highschool and such . 
  thankfully i was able to differenciate them from what i read at home :p, 
  and camus and celine !, 
  french writers are really good !, 
  ( just to clarify , valencian and catalan are used interchangedly - valencian for valencians and catalan for the rest - , and yes , joanot martorell was one of the best writers in this language ) . 
  another great book in catalan , probably the best in modern literature is `` la pla\u00e7a del diamant '' , written by merc\u00e8 rodoreda . 
  dealing with the second spanish republic and the spanish civil war , the novel is set in barcelona before , during and after the war and pictures a young woman 's struggles in life as well as her conflictive relationships with two men , and her progression from nearly complete submission until she develops a full-fledged outlook in life , personal maturity and independence . 
  it is also a faithful chronicle of life in the city at the time . 
  [ the most badass spy in human history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joan_pujol_garcia ), 
  yeah , we think like that here too !, 
  any repressive action taken against our president ( he has been sent to court to answer for letting the people vote in a semireferendum that we did like you say in 2014 which could cost him his title ) or our nation only boosts our hopes and gives us legitimacy . 
  that 's why the spanish government is being relatibly cautious and only using legal and political setbacks for now . 
  beacause spain can suspend our autonomy and send the police/army . 
  they * do * have the tools, 
  we 're not talking about an udi , did you read the article ? 
  it 's a pacted seccession, 
  too much free time that i really do n't have :p, 
  talking about catsiquespot here, 
  we 've been doing this for 4 years already . 
  this `` 1 year more '' thing does n't work . 
  well , if you live under a rock that might seem true . 
  yes , and it was expected that they would oppose this one . 
  i read it , any dialogue without international mediation with spain does n't seem that realistic sadly . 
  we 're not talking about unilateral independence, 
  they voted against a particular plan of seccession , not independence in general, 
  false : catsiquespot ( the party that represents the non-aligned ) today changed their discourse from the elections and voted against it . 
  quite the breach of thrust, 
  even then catsiquespot did n't align , so i 'd say this is quite a breach of legitimacy toward their voters . 
  their electoral campaign explicitly was non-aligned . 
  what they do afterward is their own problem . 
  you do n't get to decide for how we organise our elections . 
  it goes as follows : 47,5 % of the votes were in favour of independence , 39 % against * and the rest choose not to participate in the independentist debate * . 
  that means that they willingly wanted * not to be counted either in favour our against * . 
  since this is n't a referendum you do n't get to count it as such . 
  so does that mean that 25 % of the populace get to decide for the 75 % ? 
  hell no, 
  you do n't get it . 
  an election is not a referendum , we won by a country mile . 
  and `` chaos and harm '' is just your opinion, 
  said rajoy 5 years ago ... 
  beacause it did n't go as you say . 
  47,5 % were in favour of independence , 39 % against it and the rest did n't align . 
  we wanted to organise a referendum but they did n't let us , so elections were the only option, 
  i saw it too over there !, 
  it 's crazy how big it has gotten , you only notice when traveling abroad ... 
  there 's a ton of them missing , literally all of the local brands in catalonia are n't there . 
  i mean , i just read on wikipedia that estrella damm ( our main brand here ) sells well in the us , but i could be wrong . 
  i think i saw it once in nyc but maybe it 's pretty niche ... 
  anyway yeah , it 's pretty us-centric sadly, 
  one thing 's for certain , i can tell for a fact that there 's a ton missing in barcelona and surrounding areas . 
  estrella damm , moritz and all of the local beer are missing . 
  the map is really well done though, 
  nope , it 's a different context . 
  the house of trast\u00e0mara was chosen to rule the kingdom of aragon mainly beacause they had ties to the house of barcelona and since the latter was dead well ... they could n't just revive someone you know ? 
  it was a continium . 
  nevertheless , when you look at how the institutions worked ( consulat de mar , only in catalan , with copies of the code book from 1494 ) and how the laws were written , it 's pretty obvious why the [ * king 's palace * ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f0yamnm.jpg ) was in barcelona . 
  and was descendant of the house of barcelona through the female line , as my article and comment says .
