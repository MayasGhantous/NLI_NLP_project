  the fact that he was from the trast\u00e0mara does n't mean crap , he represented the line of barcelona through the female line ( otherwise he would n't have legitimacy to rule ) . 
  naples was conquered on the 26 of february of 1443,

  oh really ? 
  well , it is n't that surprising though , historically it has always been the posh city of the country ... 
  i 'm guessing barcelona ( pedralbes district probably has some influence in that ) is at the top ? 
  picking mushrooms is * also * a national sport here , even moreso than picking chesternuts !, 
  we literally have a popular name ( as opposed to the scientific one ) for pretty much every single species that lives here , and our forests were getting so full of people that we had to implement regulation to limit the amount of people that can go picking, 
  yeah !, 
  the kids go to the forest to pick them and then they are roasted or they go buy ` paperines ' ( rolls of paper ) full of roasted chesternuts from la castanyera , like in the drawing, 
  we still have them over here !, 
  la castanyera is very deep in our culture , despite the burnout of halloween, 
  it was a really bad pun in catalan : fuet means whip on catalan too , so it would be the weapon of choice for the duel :p !,

  i did n't even know you guys did that too !, 
  [ wikipedia link of the celebration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/castanyada ), 
  huh , i did n't even know that foreigners cared so much about us that they went ahead and * wrote * books like that . 
  welp , and yeah , pasqual maragall did it for the flair , it was a nice occasion to apologise for * how badly we fucked shit up * :p !, 
  we until then were denied entrance to a monastery around greece , and explicitly : no catalans were allowed !, 
  what book actually ? 
  foreigners learning about my country is preeeeety weird but really cool !, 
  :p one of my favourite parts of our history is the `` catalan venjance '' , or the `` venjan\u00e7a catalana '' . 
  [ the article in english is preeeetty bad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_company ) so i 'd suggest trying to google translate the one [ in catalan ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/venjan%c3%a7a_catalana ), 
  i mean , once they give us back northern catalonia we 're fine :p !, 
  andorra is fine i guess ... 
  47 % voted for independence , 39 % voted against it and the rest abstained in this matter , since these were * autonomical elections * ( if you 're going to pretend to know what you 're talking about , at least get the terms straight ) and * not * a referendum . 
  and yes , they very much were `` voting for independence elections '' . 
  we the catalans , of coure , we voted so, 
  of course !, 
  we had to study all of the dialects [ like this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/dialectes_catal%c3%a0.svg/2000px-dialectes_catal%c3%a0.svg.png ) ... and then in spanish those too , plus the americans and their defining traits . 
  it was n't fun :p !, 
  the first statue is the cibeles , where all of the rmadrid people go to celebrate their titles ( read : deserted place ) and the second one is a monument to a fascist ( calvo sotelo ) . 
  that 's how madrid goes i guess ... 
  [ i mean , ] ( http://www.homeandfactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/colchones-baratos-en-madrid-.jpg ) [ madrid kinda has its own thing too ] ( http://acusticasansegundo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/esp79.jpg ) , but yeah , it 's not * at our * , barcelona 's , level :p, 
   spain exists in its form for several hundred years , why would someone born today go back to something not even their grand-grand parents saw ? 
  would be like me asking for the restoration of austria-hungary ... yep , you do n't get it . 
  ill-informed , more accurately : catalonia is more than a thousand year old nation ( talking about comtats catalans here ) and is still strong today , so * we do n't want to go back to anything * . 
  we just want a state . 
  it 's amazing and you should love it . 
  though all streets kinda look like the same sometimes, 
  i know , and yet when i hear galician it sounds much closer to catalan than spanish to me . 
  galician is n't portuguese , yet i hear it a lot more , so i draw the comparison from that angle, 
  [ you forgot balears ... and northern catalonia !!!, 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/paisos_catalans.svg/350px-paisos_catalans.svg.png ) poor island people and frenchies ... 
  there 's two main attitudes : either we all get along really well and form a somewhat unified `` brotherhood '' , which is usually something that happens more between balears and catalans or we * hate * eachother , which is more common between us and valencians , who do n't understand that when we say that they speak catalan it 's just the word we use for the common language , which they call `` valencian '' and think that we 're a bunch of imperialists . 
  fun to see though , that the most `` anticatalan '' of the valencians never speak catalan and even sometimes * apologise in public * for speaking it . 
  if they even know how to speak it . 
  sometimes if the other guy does n't speak english and you know a romance language you can get away with speaking spanish slowly . 
  though it 's weird : i find that catalan is much more related to portuguese than spanish is , even if that is n't the case . 
  so i 'll speak in catalan in that case :p, 
  like romanian for me as a catalan too ... related languages are weird ... 
   so the farmers attacking the police with tractors in the protest were terrorists then , gotcha . 
  nope , did they intend to * kill * people ? 
  or was it just violence motivated through a protest ? 
  do n't twist the facts . 
   that 's good for you , it does n't mean you have the sole right to decide where public money is spent however . 
  would you feel the same way if only supporters of refuge policy had to pay increased taxes to fund their upkeep while the rest of who get a rebate ? 
  this is not how the real world works . 
   i do n't have a problem with refugees , i do however have a problem with paying for them and think the economics of this is a disaster waiting to happen specifically since only the most advanced welfare states seem to be safe enough for them you do have a problem with the refugees and you do n't want to admit it . 
  states * do have * enough money for refugees , and while most of europe eats this `` bad refugees '' crap the higher classes make a killing shutting down the welfare state `` beacause muh refugees '' . 
  they intended to do this anyway , and i even think they 're surprised at how good this excuse has worked, 
  * it is * plain and simple : attacking refugee shelters is attacking a govermental policy , they obviously are against them . 
  a violent attack on the goverment is terrorism . 
  i 'd be scared if `` people '' like these roamed around my country , for example and since i 'm a more or less well developed person ( or so i think ) i support refugees and their phlight , and these kinds of idiots should swap their places and go to syria or something . 
  empathy exists , ya know ? 
  i 'm not going to argue against something as plain and simple as this . 
  they are terrorists by the very definition of the word . 
  what really scares me is that people like you defend them, 
  a terrorist can , too , be an arsonist . 
  people can get charged with multiple crimes . 
  and if the main motivation if to create fear and try to change a police with the use of violence , then the main term is terrorist , which is what they are . 
  you can call them scum too if you like . 
  i sure do .
