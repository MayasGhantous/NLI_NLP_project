  the delegaci\u00f3n is always hilariously wrong , and when even the right-wing guardia civil doubles their numbers it 's just sad :p . counting with helicopters is always the most accurate method and it 's used worldwide, 
  more or less half of the population supports independence in barcelona . 
  that 's * at least * 800.000 people, 
  yeah yeah i know , i 've never cared about them . 
  but it 's funny how quickly i get downvoted , usually for things that are n't even related to catalonia :p, 
  no problem !, 
  but since elections are already done , it was a bit of a pointless discussion , i got -10 votes for my trouble :p, 
  huh ... well , we 'll see how this plays out . 
  thank you !, 
  i 'm not saying it is n't true , but do you know where is the official comunicate ? 
  it is n't linked there and i ca n't seem to find it . 
  their page , twitter and facebook do n't say anything of the sort , and this directly contradicts the statements of yesterday 's declarations . 
  i 've even searched their candidates social media accounts ( and they are very active btw ), 
  we were speaking about the poll , meaning that , even if a little part of the votes went to non-aligned parties ( abstentions , basically ) , it would favour the winning party, 
  nope . 
  it 's called right of self-determination . 
  * we do n't have to and we wo n't * . 
  in fact , we have already done such a thing , so what are you trying to tell me ? 
  that 's my point . 
   hopefully there will be some changes in the next elections . 
  and it wo n't change . 
  it 's been more than 6 years . 
  `` apoyare '' is too old too, 
  everyone wants votes , it was an election, 
  nope , catalan voted in favour ( in fact , they were the ones who sent the proposition ), 
  your own fault in plural , as the spanish people . 
  you voted your representatives and not a single party in spain voted our proposition to organize a referendum . 
  cup got 10 seats , but excellent table anyway !, 
  nope , some want a pacted exit and even some want unilateral proclamation . 
  that 's why they have n't aligned . 
  this indefinition has costed them a ton of votes, 
  it 's a giant ski resort for rich spanish people . 
  spin what ? 
  this was n't a referendum , and since catsiqueespot did n't align ( meaning that there are independentists there too , like ada colau ) we do have a majority in votes and seats . 
  if you wanted referendum results you should 've let us organize one . 
  it 's your own fault, 
  nah , that 's what jxs said . 
  it does n't matter . 
  what does matter is what csp said about themselves, 
  it 's not a referendum , it does n't work like that . 
  plebiscitary elections mean that we do have a majority , since the unaligned block does n't count toward one way or the other . 
  many people in catsiqueespot would 've voted yes in a referendum , for exemple ada colau , the mayor of barcelona, 
  i had a cold i think 3 weeks ago , with 18c , ja !, 
  that 's fucked up . 
  21 is bare minimum for t-shirt wheater, 
  16 is fucking cold man . 
  anything below 20 is chilly wheater actually, 
  i had to put on * three * layers of thin clothes this morning !, 
  totally unacceptable . 
  the tallest is in palma though , and the widest in girona , we kinda took over the gothic style :p, 
  it was one of his first works so he was still developing his style ( he used a lot of arabesque influences in this one ) , so it 's not that well known , but it 's a great building anyhow !, 
  my history of architecture teacher told us that the best gothic cathedral in france is laon ... so ... there ? 
  i want to go too :p !, 
  chartres is very good too . 
  ehhhhh he did n't even study architecture so it 's to be expected honestly :p, 
  lord corbu becomes you god once you enter any architecture-related field , and ronchamp is his cathedral . 
  my history of architecture teacher ... wait , my entire body of teachers of my uni would desecrate your corpse after destroying you with rulers and pencils . 
  when i did the one for catalonia i just posted a picture for every category , except the ones for gaud\u00ed ( beacause c'mon ), 
  holy shit france does indeed have a ton of world heritage sites, 
  [ it was submitted in 2002 yet it has n't been approved yet ] ( http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1051/ ) . 
  weird , [ beacause it 's a big and cool site ] ( http://patrimoni.gencat.cat/sites/default/files/styles/slideshows_fitxes/public/empuries-12.jpg?itok=zemzpfav ), 
  oh you , 
  yes , gaud\u00ed is one of the greatest architects to ever live , no doubt about that !, 
  yet we 've got a lot more than just architecture ( even if myself would only stare at buildings if i were a tourist ) . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.nationalgeographic.com.es/medio/2012/07/13/vn_esc_aiguestortes-4_1000x666.jpg ) is a 3 hour drive away from the center of the city , and you can get [ here ] ( http://75.escolesminguella.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/montserrat3.jpg ) by train in an hour or so . 
  [ i 'd argue that the interior is even better thant the fa\u00e7ade ] ( http://traveldigg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/la-sagrada-familia-interior-roof-detail.jpg ), 
  [ i just did one for catalonia !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5bfk5g/world_heritage_sites_in_catalonia/ ), 
  we think he enjoys spurting out random phrases that do n't even make sense , like `` es el vecino el que elige el alcalde y es el alcalde el que quiere que sean los vecinos el alcalde . '', 
  `` it 's the neighbour that chooses the mayor and the mayor that wants that to be the neighbours the mayor '' so we made a `` recopilatory '' , in this one he says `` espa\u00f1a is a great nation and the spaniards much spaniards '' :p, 
  [ so kinda like this ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oq1vfjs_py ) :p, 
  thing is , they themselves set the bar pretty high with their parody ( of at the time relevant ) gangam style with our then [ president ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aupfoa037la ), 
  [ here we have pol\u00f2nia ... 
  i mean ya know , they 've done better stuff than this but still :p ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrmnvd-q4qa ), 
  yes they did i assume , beacause it 's common when building metro lines to reinforce old structures like this ( sagrada familia is a contemporary example ) , but they did n't build them for a rebuild of the colosseum . 
  it would need a different kind of structure ( deep drilled pylons probably ), 
  ehhhhhh no , i actually know what i 'm talking about , dunno about you mate, 
  i in fact study architecture and yes , rebuilding even the shape of the building would require at least 10m or so ( and it 's a pretty wild guess ) of steel and concrete under the building which would mean bulldozing everything inbetween . 
  construction is destructive , the original foundations are not even close to good . 
  you 're not talking about restoring , the colosseum has already been restored and that 's why we allow people inside . 
  if there 's danger of collapse it will require further restoration , but no more than what it is needed . 
  you 're talking about actually rebuilding the ruined part . 
  things change their meaning over thousands of years and the value of the colosseum is n't what it was . 
  to try and go back would just * ruin the ruin * , which is what has value . 
  we can recreate everything the romans built , but not like they did , so it 'd be just a fake . 
  and yes , i 'm in part talking about that , part thinking about the horrible statues in skopje . 
  thing is , there is a consensus about perpetuating human heritage , and that means not messing with it . 
  i know i come of as a jerk , not my intention , but just the partial rebuilding would mean a crazy high destruction . 
  well but that * is * rebuilding . 
  for example : to do what you said you 'd need very strong foundations that go through , you guessed it , the original . 
  there 's also no reason to do it , beacause the value of the colosseum is not the same as in the time of the romans , we no longer do gladiator fights . 
  its value rests in being one of the biggest roman structures left , and as a ruin of * what they built * . 
  if we build over that we just lose it , beacause it is n't roman anymore . 
   never say never ? 
  for the restoration of the colosseum you 'd require the approval of an architect . 
  and let me tell you , youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu 'll have to search a lot to find someone willing to desecrate one of the most important ruins in human history . 
   plenty of medieval castles are getting restored ; that does n't mean they are n't medieval castles or tourist traps anymore plenty of medieval castles are being destroyed yes , sad news . 
  look , you need to understand that `` restoring '' is not the same as rebuilding . 
  the colosseum has already been restored , we would n't allow people inside of it if that were n't the case .
