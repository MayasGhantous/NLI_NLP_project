  rebuilding is a whole new problem , beacause it basically means destroying the original and building a fake , which is as bad as it sounds . 
  it will never happen . 
  the value of the colosseum is that it was built by the romans and not its function . 
  it 's main purpose is historical and artistic . 
  repair is not rebuild , the colosseum has already had a ton of repair work, 
  beacause it 's the closest language to occitanian alive !, 
  occitan is only official in catalonia btw ( i think ) , beacause aranese , a dialect of it , is spoken in a remote valley up in our pyrenees , so we decided to make it co-official togheter with catalan . 
  it 's closer in many ways to french than spanish even if modern influences have changed that a bit , beacause it started over the mountains in the southern border with the occitan speaking peoples ( we were brother countries , almost literally ) . 
  of course , this is the architectural standard , i 'm not against that . 
  it has to be executed * very very * well though , and only in an extreme risk . 
  also , i 'm preetty sure there 's some work involved already . 
  that 's what preservation and restoration is for . 
  yes , obviously . 
  we do n't exactly know how it looked , plus you 're subestimating how bizarrely complex it was . 
  what do people want , [ this fake parthenon in nashville ? 
  ] ( https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2013/11/13/1384365165060/greek-parthenon-nashville-006.jpg?w=720&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=75de9ef80453bd9decf77ff90050d14f ) [ you sure ?

  the ruin * is * the building , it has its own value . 
  it 's pretty amazing to see how few people give the value that the building really has . 
  rebuilding the colosseum ? 
  wtf ? 
  beacause this subrredit is prrrretty full of accepting spaniards ( read c 's voters ) that will never accept that catalan is a reality and downvote based on flair . 
  i mean , it 's not an absolute , it 's a % of gdp , and a big part of our industry is third sector related ( tourism and services ) , which is n't the case for these other regions , so i guess this explains it . 
  though i thought we had a strong medical and tech industry ? 
  no catalan ? 
  [ well here ya go , 33 languages now ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fkeab7jjis ), 
  yeah yeah , but i mean , it was like +5 , then -1 , now it 's +2 ... 
  i do n't even know :p, 
  de res !, 
  you 're welcome !, 
  ( btw the upvotes for this chain have been all over the place , weird ), 
  ... yes !, 
  his entire work was based on the `` irony '' of it all , as i said , edgiest architect of the xxth century hahahahahahahaahah, 
  robert venturi , [ he was an architect from the xxth century who proposed that `` things should make it absulutely clear what they are and are n't '' ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/a8/3e/75/a83e75d5dd76b52e6c80e5ecc40651b0.jpg ) and critizised other architects for making houses shaped like a duck , as in , that did n't make sense ( he built [ this ] ( https://ciudadpedestre.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/buildings_duck.jpg ) and his most famous work , his mother 's house , was [ off-center among other things , to mock them ] ( http://images.adsttc.com/media/images/5037/e07f/28ba/0d59/9b00/016c/large_jpg/stringio.jpg?1414230673 ) ) . 
  basically , he was the `` edgiest architect '' of the 60 ' . 
  it looks like some kind of venturi 's fucked up wet dream, 
  not progressive in a right/left scenario of course , progressive toward a new state ( and policy wise too ) . 
  are you maybe denying that ? 
  and anyway , i hate corruption and i 've never voted ciu yet you know perfectly well that there is not a single catalan party with worse corruption cases than either pp or psoe , so quit it with the demagogy . 
  he was n't , to think that all ciu voters were catalan nationalists is delusional . 
  do i have to remind you why ciu does n't exist anymore ? 
  also camb\u00f3 was an idiot and an exception , to say that he `` lead '' anything is just plain dishonest . 
  you know as well as i do that companys , maci\u00e0 , solidaritat , even erc did their thing too back then . 
  at the end of the day , the key difference between catalan nationalism and spanish nationalism is that one is for statu quo and the other is n't . 
  also guess why since its inception in the xixth century nationalism here has been led by the * left * . 
  you are n't really that knowledgable about catalan nationalism and just assume that it 's the same as the shit you 've got in madrid . 
  i mean , i ca n't blame you , if i just saw pp as my only example of nationalism i would despise it too . 
  yup , they cut out the best part , the * visca catalunya lliure !, 
  * they would 've shat their collective pants hearing that . 
  catalan nationalism is not reactionary just beacause you do n't like it , sorry . 
  it 's just a way to make things go forward you know , ** to progress ** :p, 
  they ca n't , beacause then their role would be filled with podemos and psc-indepe is more or less erc . 
  plus remember , their main voter pools are in bcn 's metro area where independentism is almost non-existent . 
  they should become more pro-referendum though . 
  reactionary ? 
  or just with a diametrically opposed opinion as yours ? 
  beacause if so , i 'm reactionary too , and i vote cup , which is quite the paradox . 
  i love how c 's voters around here defended them before the elections saying that they 'd be though with pp and they would n't allow their corruption . 
  i too read rufian 's unfinished speech . 
  he 's the fucking best thing that happened to erc since tard\u00e0, 
  nope . 
  not in my school at least , and it was public, 
  i finished high scool less than a decade ago so i dunno , it probably is different in every community ? 
  or is it a very recent change ? 
  oh , sorry , yes we do !, 
  we covered the history of greece , rome and medieval catalonia and the crown of aragon and then we did modern history of spain in highschool , which i think has a common curriculum, 
  nope , no clue . 
  we 've had no history classes from xvth century to xixth ( with a short detour of the war of spanish succession ) , and philosophy only covers international authors ( a la kant ) , not locals, 
  the picasso museum is in barcelona and guernika and most of his best work are either in madrid or nyc, 
  no idea about that . 
  was it some kind of early university in castille ? 
  i 've never heard of it, 
  i can tell you for a fact that very few people would actually know who they were . 
  they might 've heard the names though , but nothing else . 
  here our mandatory history curriculum kinda ends at the xvth century , and in highschool we cover the xixth and xxth ( excluding world wars of course ) , so it 's not like we 're even taught that, 
  thing is , outside of the us nobody really cares about them a lot, 
  huh , so it seems like picasso is way more famous than gaud\u00ed ... the tourists over here seem to think otherwise though, 
  yup , i have tagged him as `` facha 2.0 '' for a looooooooooooooooooooooooong time . 
  winner gets the honorary medal of the police , after the virgin mary, 
  i just sent you a youtube video . 
  use google yourself , mate , i 've got work to do . 
  the fuck you 're talking about . 
  `` pues '' does n't even make sense in context , and patxi is the stereotypical male basque name, 
  i did n't say pues , i said patxi though, 
  [ my favourite ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqdpo120cuu&amp;spfreload=10 ), 
  oh , quick as fuck , maybe a year or two to get to at least b2 ( at least ) ? 
  they 're very similar , though i 'd argue that catalan is tougher beacause it has more conjugations , the '' ` '' accent and more pronouns ( ahhhhh the feble pronouns ... ! ), 
  and yet if you know spanish you know most of the basics . 
  basically , catalan is a weird mix of italian , spanish and french and none at all beacause it was created at the same time ( actually , its closest language is occitan ) , but i doubt it 'll be that hard . 
  i 'm sure there 's tons of stuff online to learn it . 
  there 's really no equivalent though , and it could be used as such . 
  oh yeah , that 's for sure . 
  immersion works does n't it :p ? 
  yet if i were him i 'd do a course or two , after all , it 's not that much of an effort if you already know spanish . 
  oh , but that 's irrelevant !, 
  remember the oil-referenda in canarias and the opposition it recieved ? 
  not true , but anyone that does n't belive it ( or even cares about it , which i doubt ) can check it . 
   i meant if he already knew spanish on an advanced `` can hold a fluid conversation using appropriate terminology '' kind of way . 
  i would n't be so sure about it still . 
  it 's as i said , a different language .
