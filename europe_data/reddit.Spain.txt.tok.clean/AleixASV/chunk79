  here in catalonia we have a `` book day '' , sain jordi 's day , our saint patron !, 
  it 's one of the most important holidays in catalonia , where it is traditional to give a present to the loved one ; red roses for women and books for men , so it 's a mixed-book-and-valentines-day . 
  though obviously nowadays everyone gets a book ( and the girls get a rose too of course ) . 
  reading is a hobby , like any other , done for fun . 
  and obviously , like in any other hobby , there 's `` tiers '' of quality . 
  you just ca n't generalize and put kafka and 50 shades of grey in the same basquet . 
  [ ramon llull ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ramon_llull ) . 
  also known as `` ramon lo foll '' ( ramon the madman ) literally forsaw computation theory way back in the xiiith century among a bunch of other things . 
  also , [ narc\u00eds monturiol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/narc%c3%ads_monturiol ) , inventor of the submarine, 
  i actually wanted to link this but i could n't find it :p, 
  it 's very beautiful , but is it just me or most of the pictures seem taken from the same place ? 
  there 's very little variety there, 
  ... [ that does remind me of something ] ( http://imgur.com/a/blurq#0 ), 
  i mean , it 's not like we have that much of a military ourselves . 
  [ we play pretend wars more than we actually have it :p ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu0ncryytxy ), 
  basically , spaniards in this thread are pissed beacause they 've been ignored even though only galicia should be colored too . 
  we just want a better country , one way or the other :p, 
  we 've got lots of gdp !, 
  lots !, 
  thank you !, 
  and catalan . 
  i mean , we have the whole `` guiri '' stereotype for a reason, 
  i 'd like to see a catalan flair please !, 
  i mean you can invade us . 
  wait no , ** please , invade us **, 
  [ who does n't love that fluffy mass of hair ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwuy0p-h4e4 ), 
  yeah , i guess they only divided the spanish part . 
  [ here it 's basically eating carn d'olla ] ( http://www.receptescartesianes.cat/system/photos/1574/original/dscn5389.jpg?1387143215 ) and [ canelons day ] ( http://servigourmet.cat/wp-content/uploads/canelons-sant-esteve.jpg ), 
  princicat best cat . 
  into ... medieval kingdoms ? 
  that is weird . 
   maybe it would have been more expensive , but i 'd preferred if they tried to rebuild more of the old city than just modernising it and making it like most other globopolises . 
  clean , safe , modern but utterly anonymous and unoriginal . 
  fake copies are n't worth shit . 
  you ca n't go back to the past , but you can honour it like it deserves . 
  this does n't mean that soviets bothered to build it properly ( which they did n't ) , but that 's besides the point . 
  yeah , catalan is only useful if you 're going to live here in my school you could do it in spanish unless it was for catalan class though, 
  yeah , catalan is only useful if you 're going to live here in my school you could do it in spanish unless it was for catalan class though, 
  hahahahahahahaha then it 's closer than i thought !, 
  if i did n't know better i 'd call that broken english though :p, 
  but is n't scotts a true language by itself ? 
  i went to scotland last summer and heard a bit of it , it was n't really similar to english , but i do n't know . 
  thank you for mentioning catalan !, 
  being from here has the nice advantadge of being native bilimgual in both spanish and catalan , so we 're all bilingual by default . 
  it 's a pretty unique situation . 
  dark at night , with people running in the street chasing others with black objects shouting in a foreign language ? 
  objectively it 's scary given the context . 
  someone said `` everybody to the ground '' and panic ensued . 
  i been there a couple of times on a winter holidays . 
  holy shit is it packed . 
   `` this is nothing compared to what other missions have to endure , such as the japanese mission that had to deal with a gas leak . 
  every morning at the meeting of the mission chiefs there are many complaints heard , and the hosts simply assure us that the problems will be solved , '' kouvelos continued is n't this great, 
  [ i dunno , i prefer the costa brava myself ] ( http://images.interchalet.com/teaser/costa_brava_ferienhaus.jpg ), 
  or he 's portuguese/mediterranran . 
  these beaches are pretty common, 
  says the american that has less than 1 % . 
  obviously you 're a troll and i 'm wasting my time replying to you , but i 'm glad this is an echo-chamber and racism will never extend itself further than this . 
  glad to help , enjoy the city !, 
  sure !, 
  [ the hospital of sant pau is the biggest and best non-gaud\u00ed modernist work ] ( http://www.bcn.cat/horta-guinardo/rutes/img/gran/1-19_2.jpg ) . 
  the entry price is n't that expensive [ and it 's beautiful ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/hospital_de_la_santa_creu_i_de_sant_pau_ ( barcelona \\ ) _ - _ 11 . jpg ) . 
  near the boqueria , there 's it 's medieval predecessor , the [ hospital de la santa creu ] ( http://bcnshop.barcelonaturisme.com/files/5445-7469-imagen/hospital-santacreu-rambla-barcelona-pf-c1.jpg ) , where now we have the national library . 
  it has a very cool garden with free entry . 
  up from sant pau there 's the [ bunkers del carmel ] ( https://enclavesconencanto.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/541021_426219824112938_1585901291_n.jpg?w=1000&amp;h=666 ) with the best view of the city . 
  do tourists know about this ? 
  it 's usually full of people though many are locals , it 's barcelona 's favourite couples place . 
  in montju\u00efc we 've got the laribal [ gardens ] ( http://irbarcelona.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/pergola-jardinlaribal.jpg ) and the [ castle ] ( http://www.ojodigital.com/foro/attachments/urbanas-arquitectura-interiores-y-escultura/222788d1368460263-castell-de-montjuic-160313_0714-od.jpg ) , which has a cool view too . 
  it 's a [ star fort ] ( http://neonized.net/blog/wp-content/files/2015/02/barcelona_montjuic_castle_aerial_view-1.jpg ) . 
  also , [ the palau g\u00fcell is one of gaud\u00ed 's less known works in barcelona ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/fa%c3%a7ana_palau_guell-barcelona.catalunya.jpg ) , yet it 's one of [ my favourites ] ( http://equipatgedema.cat/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cupula-palau-guell.jpg ) also check out the orxateria sirvent at carrer parlament , near paral \u00b7 lel street !, 
  it has the best orxata in catalonia !, 
  oh , that * might * be hard to argue against hahaahahahaha, 
  i would !, 
  i mean , tossa 's nice and all , but there 's too many tourists !, 
  ( not that calella is n't plagued too though ), 
  so are yours !, 
  i mean , did n't they vote calella `` the best place in catalonia '' in that old contest that tv3 made ? 
  mine would be : [ aig\u00fcestortes i estany de sant maurici ] ( http://www.nationalgeographic.com.es/medio/2012/07/13/vn_esc_aiguestortes-4_1000x666.jpg ) . 
  it 's literally heaven on earth . 
  it also has [ the best examples of romanesque architecture in the world , beautifully preserved in the vall de bo\u00ed ] ( http://ep00.epimg.net/ccaa/imagenes/2013/03/03/catalunya/1362333435_289920_1362333605_noticia_normal.jpg ) . 
  too obvious , though if you 're into architecture ( any type ) we 've got everything from roman to modern . 
  [ calella de palafrugell ] ( https://www.hotelmastorrent.com/media/costa-brava/calella-palafrugell/calella.jpg ) too , and also llafranc and tamariu ( other little towns really close to that ) , they 've got the best beaches of the mediterranean sea ( imo , also bias beacause i went there since i was a child :p ) . 
  also , check out the `` camins de ronda '' , little roads that connect all of these little towns that go along the coast !, 
  it 's just a really cool and weird mountain with a big monastery , the spiritual center of the country . 
  ( i said four beacause barcelona was too obvious ), 
  well yes , but he said that `` rajoy had support of some nationalist parties from catalonia '' and that is not true . 
  apart from the fact that pp will never allow a referendum . 
  actually pdc said that they would vote against him as far as i know, 
  gallegos are celts ( supposedly ? 
  i 've heard people dispute it ), 
   that is a point that invalidates or at least evidences the exaggeration on some of the independentists an nationalists ' strongest arguments . 
  i 'm not saying that your own arguments are among these , but it 's very frustrating to hear that catalonian culture is n't respected or that the rest of spain does n't grant catalonia enough autonomy when you have the perfect counterexample across the french border . 
  look , i wo n't even go into this . 
  our culture has survived just beacause here in catalonia we had enough population to resist the hundreds of years of persecution . 
  do i have to remind you that for the most part of the xxth century we 've had a fascist regime that tried time and time again to eliminate our culture ? 
  i 'm sorry , but this is non-arguable , it 's almost offensive to suggest that `` oh yes , spain has treated us * so * well '' . 
  catalan culture is not respected on spain . 
  spain does not give us any autonomy at all . 
  try passing a law in the catalan parliment that is n't liked in madrid . 
  see what happens .
