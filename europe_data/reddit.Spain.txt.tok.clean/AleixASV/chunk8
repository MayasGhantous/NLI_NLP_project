   franco is dead , people , get over it . 
  but not the people who support it , you 'd be surprised, 
  not a demonstration , but a human chain ( we did one last year ! ), 
  yeah ... where the facts are made up and the reality does n't matter, 
  in all my life i honestly never heard that crap, 
  my god why the central gov is so short-sighted that does n't get that !, 
  they were a ton of people on the sidestreets, 
  you pretty much got it , though adding to that we would gain 15b $ a year alone only in `` state '' taxes that by right should be already ours plus all the crap that madrid has been throwing at us , trying to crush our culture, 
  you people should inform yourselves before generalising . 
  this is * not * an external enemy distraction maneuver and if it were how could we have convinced so many people ? 
  do you think we do n't have data and facts to back us off ? 
  yeah , the only places where people are more resilient to that sentiment are the metro area of bcn and pretty much the south of catalonia, 
  i saw a few st. andrew crosses there  !, 
  though we have always been friends with the basque movement, 
  nobody here claims a milion , so it is pretty doubtfull . 
  guardia urbana , who are the ones who claim 2m are n't part of the organisers , and they usually claim low estimates, 
  it was 11km of demonstration ( the greatest in all the history of europe in terms of people and length ) in the two biggest streets of barcelona and yet yes , we were pretty crushed :p, 
  half a milion is absolutely fake , that 's less than the people who bothered to sign up to come and less much than the reported number of people that came on bus , train , car , etc. 
  without even counting the locals themselves, 
  well , we have practise in this sort of things and no , 2m is a pretty accurate number . 
  what is n't accurate are the 500000 claimed by the central gov who hilariously enough did n't knew that they were less than the people who bothered to sign up to participate, 
  as he is , i just answered him, 
  and catalans in catalan, 
   blah blah blah franco used to oppress us . 
   says who affirms speaking catalan has ever been forbidden . 
  not being official/being discouraged ! = being forbidden . 
  just so we 're all aware of what you 're justifying , even more direct if you did n't get it, 
  [ alright , so you 're justifying this crap ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/francoist_speak_in_spanish_singn.jpg ) , just so we 're all aware of it, 
  [ oh , so you 're now justifying it ? 
  alright ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ca&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ca&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fca.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fcronologia_de_la_repressi%25c3%25b3_del_catal%25c3%25a0&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) i thought people like you did n't exist anymore, 
  alright , i see , we 've got an expert here, 
  but we share the same culture so we do care , the goverment that represses our culture there is trying to do the same here , also , if you do n't understand why we only teach in catalan you should ask why , not criticise and hope to get away with it . 
  immersion is absolutely needed in a country that got a lot of immigration from other parts of spain and had * its language forbbiden * for most of the xxth century, 
  ... they are things that * happened * they * ca n't * be altered because they 're not * opinions * you know ? 
  i 'd be all for that !, 
  a better organised europe will always be more efficient !, 
  you 've got ta be kidding me . 
  have a taste of spanish dimplomacy : by a new law instituted to `` espa\u00f1olizar '' ( spanish-ise ) the catalan students , when a family of a child requests spanish education for their son all catalan education laws must be dropped and a 1/3 of the classes must be in spanish * for the kid in question and all the others in his class * meanwhile , 126000 valencian kids who requested education in catalan are forgotten and forced to learn in spanish only . 
  immigrants who request natiolatization in catalonia do n't need to know a crap about catalan or its history , just spanish and `` the creation of spain and its culture '' quoting a famous spanish politician `` we have fucked their estatut '' ( estatut : a constitution of sorts that we wasted years writing and developing for later being demolished by spain and their tribunals , which instigated one of our biggest demonstrations in history ) . 
  we are constantly being acused of `` manipulating '' our own history , yet when we provide accurate sources and royal decrees against catalan culture that came from madrid all we get is silence there are * still * documents stolen from us in the civil war in salamanca , spain , that the * central government * refuses to give us back , even if they agreed to do so years back . 
  all this can be found just googling `` attacks against catalan culture '', 
   going back takes more time and resources then going foward . 
  we 're pro europeist ( one of most europeist-federalist regions on the whole eu ) and we hope to be in the eu after our independence . 
  if that 's not the case we 'll apply for it . 
  so that 's not a problem , it 's just that we want to [ be the next state in europe ] ( http://www.globalvoicesonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/catalonia-next-state.jpg ) , without the economical and cultural drag of being inside spain . 
  ( btw i think just like you , do n't worry about that issue ), 
  because you 're not being crippled economically yet you are one of the biggest economical powehouses on the government and your culture is not being slowly eroded and insulted you should inform yourself before saying that . 
  it 's not about nationalism ( though we could base our movement on that and still get traction ) but on practical issues that spain refuses to adress . 
  sorry , but i do n't think scotts give us anything more than envy , they 're allowed to vote from the get-go and we 're not . 
  we 'll be happy if they become independent , but our movement is perfectly self-sustainable and we 've demonstrated that every year on our demonstrations ( which by the way , this year we 'll organise the biggest of all ), 
  indeed , i found the same mistake while playing civ v in spanish !, 
  [ oh , we do n't ? 
  ] ( http://www.parlament.cat/composicio/10_legislatura.jpg ) ciu : independentist ( read their electoral program and not what that one guy says ) erc : independentist mixt group -  cup : independentist ( 3 representatives ) [ and have a look at the recent polls ] ( http://www.elsingular.cat/cat/img2/2013/10/enquestalv_264x197.jpg ) i 'd say this graph is pretty biased, 
  i 'd say that a system of `` helping states '' and `` helped states '' could be implemented to solve that . 
  politically horrible but eficient, 
  i 'm pretty ok with this map , it 's great !, 
  assuming what ? 
  that you eat all the spanish propaganda ? 
   seriously ? 
  i 'm sick of the `` espanya ens roba '' . 
  i 'm sick of of hearing how the `` poor '' regions are dragging catalunya down . 
  how , somehow , catalunya is better than the rest . 
  how everything is about money . 
  how catalunya will be saved if they could just handle their own money ( or maybe ciu will get more money for their own ? ) . 
  catalunya prides themselves in the `` this is a peaceful process '' , while the only reason the current independentist wave is successful , is because of crappy economic policies from madrid , and hunger for power from their main political party . 
  ciu sold the idea that catalunya will be saved , and the desperate people bought it . 
  you just listed all the clixes that the media from madrid use and yet you wonder why i `` assume '' things about you ? 
  i would n't go around saying this `` who is this we that you are talking about '' , you 'll see this `` we '' on tv a few days from now ( of course if tve decides to show it , not like they did last year informing about the 11s at the end of their show and then apologising at 1am ), 
  not a problem , send my regards to 13tv, 
  oh shut up , you did n't understand anything of what we have been saying for the last 4 years , we 're over your crap now, 
  insult ? 
  they called voting antidemocratic , do n't speak about what you do n't know, 
  ... anyway like i said , have a nice day, 
   i was n't pointing at brits in general , i was pointing at you if you did n't notice  ** you ** 're the explanation of why we do n't like brits, 
  what , now i am racist ? 
  oh alright , i was n't pointing at brits in general , i was pointing at you if you did n't notice, 
  oh well i guess you 're the explanation of why we do n't like brits in the continent . 
  have a nice day, 
  i 'm not worthy of the priviledge that had been bestowed upon me once i subscribed to this prestigious paragon of liberty that is / r/europe ... 
  i guess i 'll have to find refugee in / r/yurop, 
  huh ... 
  so now we are measuring opinions ? 
  that sounds about right, 
  this could perfectly applied to you and maybe that 's why i responded like i did . 
  did you think about that before saying this ? 
  neither , are you happy now ? 
  i did n't even knew the scots also got this crappy response , huh , til, 
  you 're totally a poet , what are you doing on reddit ? 
  speak for you , if i did the possibility of other people doing it exists . 
  also , before the downvote brigade came this was the topcomment so i 'll let you think about that, 
  like i said , i do n't question the will to keep the union togheter but the way it is expressed on those headlines . 
  you guys are way more democratic than spain , so i 'd say it 's poor wording on their part that leads to misinterpretation, 
  like i said before , i do n't doubt your democratic values , so i 'd say it 's poor wording on their part since it can be easily malinterpreted, 
  i 'm not comenting on that but on the poor wording on the papers, 
  it explicitly refers to the scottish referendum and treats them as a whole with the uk , when the case is that only the first have the right to decide what to do with their country, 
  nope ... when you `` save '' something ... it 's just that , * you * are saving it . 
  not the scots who vote , therefore you are ruling their decisions over, 
  but not to decide what they have to do , which by the way it sounds exactly like that, 
  nah , of course that i 'm ok with scots saying that !, 
  they get to decide !,
