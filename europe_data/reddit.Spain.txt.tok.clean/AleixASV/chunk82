  so on the one hand we have this : spain ignores the vote so we 're not a state . 
  and on the other :  again you have to reapply . 
  because you 're a new state . 
  you do n't inherit anything from spain . 
  and spain will veto your accession . 
  that 's what will happen if you take the `` we 'll take our independence if spain does n't give it '' route . 
  spain acknowledges that we 're a state beacause it vetoes us into the eu . 
  is the uk outside the eu despite them voting for that ? 
  nope , it takes a while . 
  if we happen to be out of it ( which by the way , will hardly happen beacause it makes no sense either for spain or the rest of the eu to act on just * feelings * and not logic like you said ) we 'll just take norway 's stance . 
  ah , well you see , nothing of this will happen , so it 's fun to speculate ( and not like portugal and especially spain are major trading partners ) . 
  you forget why i said that we wanted mediation . 
  plus it 's not like we 'll vote and then be independent the next day , it 's a looooooong process . 
  we 'll see about that !, 
  how sad it is that people do n't value democracy ( and remember , before any idiotic threats , we 're the only way out for all penninsular trade !, 
  what ? 
  obviously we have the right to vote ( call it self-determination if you want ) , if spain does n't want us to have it we 'll take it . 
  as easy as that . 
  no they are not when their rights are not respected . 
  not allowing the people to vote * is kinda undemocratic is n't it * ? 
   do n't you know the country you live in ? 
  this is the oldest argument in the spanish troll 's book . 
  democracy implies that people are sovereign . 
  so that 's why we 'll ignore an undemocratic law . 
  actually , we 'll just follow catalan law , which will be . 
   well you should fucking know that the central govt agreed to give them the referendum . 
  they did n't decide : oh let 's start a referendum by ourselves and the rest of uk can fuck off . 
  the uk people through their government decided to let scotland have a referendum on the matter . 
  and i dunno if you realise , but you do n't have the same constitution as uk . 
  you act like we have n't tried for around 6 years to get a referendum though . 
  it 's easy to ignore the actual political situation . 
  a pacted referendum is impossible in spain , i already told you that . 
   and a minority in spain . 
  do you need everything to be explained to you slowly and steadily ? 
  ca n't you pick up things from context ? 
  an unilateral referendum ignores spain . 
  a pacted referendum does too , the entity that wants to be independent is the only one that votes . 
  stop it with the attitude . 
   well go check out the law and how experts analyse it . 
  you can legally define a `` self '' and a `` people '' in that particular context if you can prove that in the larger country that you live in you are discriminated against , oppressed , segregated etc etc. 
  go read anyone that has any understanding of how those articles work . 
  if you 're a linguistic minority you do n't suddenly get to ask for independence just cuz . 
  when does it stop ? 
  can a village ask for independence just cuz they have their own language or dialect ? 
  can the spaniards in catalonia ask for independence from catalonia ? 
  again just because you 're a minority that does n't mean you get independence . 
  obviously no . 
  that 's why we 've got a goverment here in catalonia that has been democratically elected working to make the referendum a reality . 
  we 're not doing this `` just cuz '' . 
  look , you can spin it all you want , it 's a moot point . 
  there 's a majority of people in catalonia who want to exercise that right ( 72 % in the latest poll ) and even a majority who want to be independent . 
  nothing more is requiered for democracy . 
  oh fock off . 
  i did n't know scotland was a colony last year . 
  i 've already had this discussion in this very same thread and no , catalans are actually a majority in catalonia ( that 's the `` self '' part of `` self-determination '' ), 
  [ well you see , if you read the original decree you 'll see that castille is conquering aragon ] ( https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/decretos_de_nueva_planta ) , literally mentioning `` del justo derecho de la conquista '' as the cause of this decree . 
  so original documents are lies eh ? 
  alright , alright . 
  also , we all know how `` progressive '' the spanish academia is . 
  i 'll could link you what the catalan academia thinks , but that would be lies too right ? 
   well that sounds like bullshit since your 78 constitution has already been changed before https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_constitution_of_1978 go to the reform tab to see when . 
  [ i 'll link you to the comment , it explains it pretty well ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4u3v7z/catalonians_in_favour_of_independence_now/d5mmysd ) . 
  there are two ways of changing the spanish constitution , and the one we requiere ( the mentioned by that comment ) * has never been executed * . 
   welcome to a democracy based on the rule of law . 
  that means the majority is hostile to your independence grievances . 
  but your rights are about the same as any spaniard so in no way are you discriminated against for being catalan except that minor independence issue that `` minor independence issue '' recognised by the onu as the right to self-determination ( in the first article of the un charter ) . 
  you know , little stuff . 
  if the majority of the catalans democratically demand independence we 'll get it . 
  coersion does n't work . 
   what international body ? 
  for such an important issue , it amazes me how little you actually know . 
  you sound like a brexiter . 
  use arguments that have no logic in your context , you do n't know the legal process and you ignore the consequences . 
  good luck to you on that  ) i mean , it kinda sounds like you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  i 'm not inventing stuff , it 's what the official statements of the goverment say . 
  they want an international mediator between us and spain . 
  so ... thank you i guess ? 
  whatever you say mate , whatever you say, 
  i actually did n't get downvoted hard , and it 's fitting that * i only see you when i 'm talking about independence * ( which obivously is n't always the case ) . 
  talking about projecting ? 
  says the troll, 
  ahhhhhh el mundo , source of all impartiality in the world . 
  yeah , yeah , we * loved * having [ our rights squashed by right of `` not-conquest '' !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nueva_planta_decrees ) fuck off, 
  yeah no buddy , catalonia was conquered and annexed to spain 302 years ago . 
  it 's not as easy as you paint it . 
  podemos voters can do that beacause there 's an ongoing * democratic process * that wants independence for catalonia . 
  are n't they free to choose ? 
  you ... really do n't understand the situation over here . 
  it 's not * that * easy, 
  somebody in another comment mentioned that it 's impossible to change the constitution and , while there 's a hostile goverment toward us that uses it to block every law that we pass and deny our referendum with it there is no other way but to do it unilaterally . 
  we 'll take this to an international body before any ` sudden decisions ' happen , independece is a long process . 
  second link is the pm mate, 
   i ca n't wait for this `` i told you so '' moment . 
  then i 'm sorry for that :p, 
  they will belive a clearly presented result in a referendum , which is what we 'll give them , beacause europe is ( still ) democratic . 
  if we can prove that spain left us with no other choice ( which we can obivously do ) , then yes . 
  othewise it 's coercion . 
  they wo n't have support at all if we win the referendum . 
  that 's why self-determination is a recognised international right .
