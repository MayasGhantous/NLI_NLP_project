   it wo n't work today , but you do n't know what can happen in the future , maybe in 20 years podemos wins the elections . 
  yeah , no thanks . 
  not even podemos voters want to wait that long and that 's what made indepentism rise in this poll actually . 
   what is the future of an independent catalonia if almost everyone in spain is opposed to it ? 
  basically the same as if everyone was in favour of it . 
  londoneers were too , against scotland 's independence , but they did n't vote . 
  nope . 
  it wo n't work as you yourself just said . 
  oh but you see , an unilateral referendum does n't need any kind of impossible reform . 
  as i said , not like we have n't tried the other way too . 
   so i want asturian , others want aragonese , others leonese , ... well then go for it , here in catalonia we wo n't stop you !, 
  that 's why we made aranese official in the whole country despite having really low number of speakers ( which we want to boost if at all possible ) . 
   i agree with you in this point . 
  i do n't get why this families do n't want their children to speak catalan and spanish , only just spanish . 
  it 's the same mentality that ruled spain for a good portion of the xxth century and that nowadays is trying to repress our language through laws , especially in education ( remember the `` quiero espa\u00f1olizar a los alumnos catalanes ? '' ), 
  i mean that 's the point is n't it ? 
  47,7 vs 42,4 , 47 wins . 
  it does not . 
  spain is trying again and again to impose spanish education on us , it 's now forcing us to pay the private education of literally the only four families in the entire country that requested it . 
  spain has also blocked the declaration of officiality of catalan in the eu and still does not allow to speak in catalan in any spanish chamber . 
  what we want for catalan is to be treated as any other big european language , beacause it is . 
  sadly not in this case . 
  that 's why scotland is still inside the uk and the uk will ( theorically ) pull out of the eu, 
  well , but that still means that we ca n't have a referendum then , since spain wo n't allow us one . 
  our only way of exercising our right is unilaterally . 
  it 's not like we have n't tried countless times the other way . 
  what game ? 
  you replied to me first , denying our right of self-determination . 
  this  i 'm against that self-determination bullshit contradicts with this  i 've never said that i 'm against the referendum also :  the catalan independentists ' lies . 
  since you 're not supposed to vote it 's not like we have to care that much . 
  we 've been lied to a lot too you know ? 
  ^ ^ ^ [ `` apoyare '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonmwmcj9fs ), 
   that 's because you are a single country . 
  it 's kinda how it works . 
  in germany , bavaria is the one paying more than receiving ; in uk , it 's london ; in italy , it 's the north etc. 
  in return , you have a giant unified market and wide infrastructure network . 
  [ nope , never to this degree ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aece5rgyt5m/uzikmojowai/aaaaaaaadgw/5cmpzidlna0/s1600/ccn2+p21.+d%c3%a8ficit+alem,+c%c3%a0nada.jpg ) . 
   but it is n't anymore . 
  the economy has been growing for over 2 years and that trend seems to continue . 
  out of the mediterranean crisis countries , it 's doing , by far , the best . 
  in fact , spain might soon overtake italy in gdp ( ppp ) per capita . 
  true , the very high unemployment problem remains , but that is also improving . 
  well then , congratulations for them . 
  here in catalonia we consider that spain has existed for 302 years more or less . 
  it began with our conquest and it may end with our exit . 
  and besides , that really does n't matter , we just want to create a new and better state . 
  exactly . 
  that 's why the right does n't specify for one nation or another . 
  i mean , you can be in denial all you want , we 'll do the referendum anyway . 
  do you think scotland is hungary ? 
  i mean , i do n't want to repeat myself , but the right to self-determination is n't restricted only to breaking up empires , that 's an example that i gave you that ** no , it is n't just for colonies ** . 
  well , but that 's how democracy works . 
  are you trying to say that we 're supposed to follow what a minority of the people want ? 
  catalan language will never recieve support from the spanish goverment , it 's not like we have n't tried that . 
  also , what you 're saying about the economy is unsourced and false . 
  just to give you an idea , we pay 16.000 m $ in taxes every year ( around 8 to 9 % of our gdp ) that are n't reinvested , while being forced to accrue debt which in turn we can only pay beacause madrid wants us to . 
  they are literally holding us hostage right now , they do not even honour the miserable investment quotas that they promised . 
  it 's a farce . 
  we would n't be doing this if we did n't know that we 'd be better off . 
  spain is going down the drain . 
  and as i said , that 's not true . 
  wilson used it first to de-construct the austrian empire ( and that 's why i mentioned it ) . 
  since then , many countries in mainland europe have become independent thanks to it , or at least have exercised their right to do so ( last year 's referendum in scotland was the last time ) . 
  not really . 
  we have our own goverment that exercises that right representing our will in the last elections . 
  yes , and if in 1918 people recognised that right you wo n't belive how much more we 've advanced since then . 
  [ so there 's this little thing called `` un charter '' which says this on * it 's first article *  ( http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-i/ )  the purposes of the united nations are :  ( ... )  to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and ** self-determination of peoples ** , and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace ;, 
  47 % that want independence ? 
  ( it 's just one of the many polls about this , they do n't make them anymore beacause the % is absurdly high and it makes no sense ) . 
  also , `` catalonia as a whole '' means that the sovereign entity of catalonia which will declare the referendum . 
  sorry to contradict you , but half of the countries that exist in europe used it to become independent . 
  [ 14 points of wilson and all of that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fourteen_points ) . 
  that 's actually what we 'll do !, 
  and yet , the will of the catalan people is to be an independent state . 
  so if that will becomes reality , the spanish goverment will have to either accept it or be forced to do so by the eu . 
  basic democracy is the foundational right of the union . 
  yeah , but we 're a majority in catalonia . 
  we 're exercising our right of self-determination , recognised by the onu . 
  so would i !, 
  it really sucks , but it 's our only way out currently . 
  that 's why the right that we 're exercising is called `` self-determination of nations '' . 
  catalonia as a whole wants to exercise it , not your local neighbour, 
  and in a true democratic society , the will of the people is reflected on the policial plane . 
  a big percentage of the catalan people want a referendum and even a majority want independence . 
  the problem is n't democracy mate , it 's the lack of it . 
  a pacted referendum was actually the main selling point of podemos in catalonia , and their defeat the best justification for an unilateral one , and yeah , it sucks major balls . 
  we 'll see about that . 
  actually , [ lithuania looks ] ( http://www.diplocat.cat/en/catalan-issues/debates-about-catalonia/814-vilnius-lithuania-lithuanians-are-in-favour-of-recognising-an-independent-catalonia-according-to-an-opinion-poll ) [ very likely ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbeioplrtby ) , just to give you an example . 
  we will . 
  it 's up to us to become independent , since spain will never allow one . 
  i 'm very sure this is due to pp 's victory . 
  many podemos voters ( podemos is very strong in catalonia ) here saw it as `` spain is unchangable so we 'll change catalonia via independence '' , i know many of those myself . 
  very good news either way , now that we 're pushing for the unilateral referendum we 'll make it !, 
  japanese tourists do come a lot here too , they love everything gaud\u00ed-related !, 
  yep , same here !, 
  though if you do happen to be in the certain top % of a class , the hours of that one are discounted from next year 's grade . 
  and even inside of spain , we have banned it here in catalonia ( and the canary islands too ), 
  it actually surprised me how similar we are to the scotts when i went there . 
  we and them probably have a diferent kind of nationalism than the more `` well known '' type though , since we 're nations under another state, 
  if it was autocad holy shit the hours of work,
