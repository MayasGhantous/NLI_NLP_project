  well , [ so for what it 's worth , the best way is to have a goal ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4wsaudtn4zi/vbsx49n7_2i/aaaaaaaaigy/7_o1sutfc_u/s1600/11_setembre_2014-v_aravid20140911_0008_7.png ) . 
  here we 're probably the most nationalistic country in europe and probably just beacause we want to be a state . 
  though it might just be a cultural thing , to be proud in one 's country means that people are very involved in its politics and belive that change is needed , one way or the other . 
  nationalism is associated with right-wing , conservatist goverments but that 's not the case here : independentism is led by progressist , left-wing parties . 
  yep , same case here !, 
  though here is the thing , our nationalism does n't look down on anyone . 
  it 's just so easy to use it as an excuse to exclude people , and it 's a very valid concern for most of the world when looking into a highly nationalistic country . 
  [ this too ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmolndabnhi ), 
  nope , we have curtains for that . 
  `` persianas '' as we call them here as just to help us sleep in blackness , they 're pretty bad for heat-dampening . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  finnish architecture is beautiful !, 
  oh well but i was n't talking about that . 
  the church ca n't black as a reference to something that ... people do n't see ? 
  i 'd say it 's probably a reference to well ... you know ... the black hues that dominate scandinavian architecture since forever ( people do n't see roofs ) . 
  and as i said , an element has more than one use , we painted the black tar white for the same reason . 
  oh , but that 's very common stuff here too , [ most churches are built like that ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yi7c-vu_bw4/vmq8ofubrpi/aaaaaaaasl8/l5qdvzjsans/s1600/barcelona_santa_maria_del_mar_esquema%2bi%2bseccio.jpg ) . 
  though that structure is quite curious indeed . 
  here we put empty pots between the vaults and the roof . 
  but anyway , black and white heat propiertes have been known since very very long ago . 
  [ that 's why our coastal towns have plaster walls : yes , they protect you from the salt , but also do n't absorb heat ] ( http://www.donpancho.org/storage/app/uploads/public/569/91b/e28/56991be285864528175876.jpg ), 
  yes , but tarred roofs were used for exactly the same reason !, 
  optional for pau , not for bachillerato . 
  as in , you can go to pau either for philosophy or history and usually you study much more in what you have chosen, 
  yes here too , but teachers tend to priorize what the students have chosen for pau when time is running short on 2o de batx,

  well ... it has to be dark beacause heat absortiobln and i 'm guessing those angles are optimised for the snow but well you know . 
  architects do use boring exteriors to surprise people with the interior , and protestant churches have always been more ` boring ' than catholic ones, 
  history is an optional subject , you can choose philosophy ( and most people do beacause it 's easier ) . 
  if i had n't choosen history my classes on that subject would 've ended just at the beggining of the civil war which is where they ended for all of those who went for philosophy, 
   the camps are about 1h30 from where i live , in rivesaltes , arg\u00e8les and many other places . 
  i really not proud about the terrible conditions france kept these refugees ( about half a million ) . 
  that 's the kind of memories you never forget . 
  my grandfather was in arg\u00e8les . 
  he hated the french ever since , and with good reason . 
  yup , chamberlain , joseph p. kennedy , etc. 
  all magnificient paragons of democratic values . 
  [ the kuokkala one is fucking beauftiful though , and it is n't even on the list . 
  finnish architects are one of the best at using curved woods .

  we 're paying a crapton to a 10-something year old for doing literally nothing . 
  yay spain, 
  glad to help !, 
  yup !, 
  though beware , retrograd and english nationalists will raise hell !, 
  the spanish goverment has forced us to pay for private spanish education for the total of 4 families in the entire country that requested it . 
  it 's a major selling point for these parties outside of catalonia , and they 've always tried to get rid of our system even if it absolutely works . 
  huh i did n't know that !, 
  well , here we 've had some big pushes with normalization of the language , and the one that worked best for us was the `` immersion '' policy , where catalan was used for all subjects in school ( apart from spanish class of course ) . 
  it has n't lowered our spanish proeficiency level since it 's the `` default language '' for all of the areas where this policiy was needed and has raised catalan to over 80something % !, 
  well , they 're around middle-bottom on the table usually , but we 're talking about the spanish league here , which is probably the most competitive one in the world . 
  so compared to other teams in the first league they 're not that great but they 're in there . 
  vowels ? 
  who needs those :p ? 
  it somehows looks like a medieval language , cool stuff !, 
  thank you !, 
  we 're kinda like a weird mix of the surrounding romance languages , when i 'm going around europe people mistake me for an italian !, 
  though to be fair , i heard somwhere that we actually have a lot of german influences too ( just compare the lyrics :p ), 
  i mean , i 'm not trying to blast god save the queen but that anthem is so much better !, 
  and thank you !, 
  [ here is the most common recording , with lyrics in english ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6au7hvr6yx0 ), 
  what 's this anthem from ? 
  i 've never heard it , it 's beautiful !, 
  [ i 'm obviously biased , but i find * els segadors * ( the reapers ) , the catalan anthem , to be quite good too . 
  ( also for the occasion i found a video with french subtitles ) . 
  the lyrics are cool [ too ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/els_segadors ), 
  [ * c trencada master race !, 
  yes , though it would n't make a lot of sense . 
  bar\u00e7a and espanyol would just stomp the crap out of them, 
  yeah yeah , i meant the 24hr ... they put news there like once every 2 hours or something , or when i 'm not watching . 
  and yeah , it kinda feels like some kind of 23f ... 
  what 's not to love about tve ... 10m ago they were talking about some kind of turbine in the open sea, 
  i mean , we already have a separate team , which is only allowed to play a friendly match a year with a pre-selected nation . 
  fun, 
  architects in spain are able to design structures too ( in fact structural engineers are usually aides to them ) , that 's why he said that , it seems that the spanish architectural curriculum is diferent from the rest . 
  i did read that he asked an architect for help , since for example , the beams of the cupola seem too complex for a non-trained person to handle ( not only in the cupola itself but in the pillars that support it ), 
  and i must reiterate the `` seemingly '' . 
  none of these towers are random , and each had a meaning ( 12 apostles laid in blocks of four like the 4 stripes of the catalan flag etc ), 
  [ to be fair , there 's still a lot of work to do ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcdmlog3txu ) , and much of the construction ca n't be pre-made , even if modern tech helps . 
  yes [ there is !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcdmlog3txu ), 
  yep , but once they were developed they were adopted as official languages . 
  not castilian . 
  it says valencian legislators on mine , what are you talking about ? 
  and besides , it 's not that much of a crime . 
  most of the people living there were just colonists from lleida , so they were catalans anyway . 
  obviously in the union period romance languages were n't that developed yet , though catalan has been known to exist since the ixth century . 
  funny that you mention that period though , since the first catalan document ( [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homilies_d%27organy%c3%a0 ) ) is from exactly that time . 
  i already answered what you 're saying , sorry if i do n't reply , but i do n't want to repeat myself . 
  you make a lot of assumptions and do n't source any of them though, 
   it 's just as absurd as pretending that the crown was called `` catalanoaragonesa '' instead of crown of aragon and yet it 's in many school books in catalonia ... 
  i did n't say it so what 's up with that ? 
  also , it 's pretty rare to see in schoolbooks anymore , it 's just another one of pp 's scare tactics . 
   i was referring to the dynastic union era , when there was latin and more or less evolved vulgar latin , nobody wrote official documents in anything other than latin until much later . 
  [ the first maritime law code in the world ( from which all maritime legislation is derived ) was written in catalan in this period , for example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/book_of_the_consulate_of_the_sea ), 
  it 's only a debate beacause aragonese historians want to appropiate it . 
  i 'm sorry , but this is valencian-is-a-language levels of absurd . 
  it has been confirmed countless times ( for example , in countess ermessenda 's tomb ) . 
   also , the only official language at the moment was latin , so you should propose `` crown of arag\u00f3 aragonum '' if you somehow want the english speakers to change the accepted term `` crown of aragon '' :d not true , both aragonese and catalan ( latin was too , true ) were official . 
  [ it 's just under the map , at the top of the page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crown_of_aragon ) .
