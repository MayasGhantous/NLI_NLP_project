  english adopted aragon beacause spanish influence , but that 's relatively common . 
  obviously . 
  after all , crossing the pyrenees was hard even for the franks plus i want some of those pintxos !, 
  that marriage went through the male line , not the female line . 
  that 's why the kings of the * crown of arag\u00f3 * ( not arag\u00f3n in any case , beacause castilian was n't an official language ) were part of the * house of barcelona * until that line died in the xvth century . 
  so nope . 
  and obviously rulers are announced with their biggest title and kingdom  county . 
  never wondered why the senyera , the flag of the house of barcelona became also the flag of the crown ? 
  we never refer to catalonia as the county of barcelona , we say `` catalan counties '' . 
  the name of catalonia is definetely documented from back then , and yes , as i said ( and the link reads ) , the `` fusion '' of the houses of barcelona and aragon created the crown of aragon , catalonia was n't merged into the kingdom of aragon . 
  you can imagine it as a federal state of sorts , with the latter additions of val\u00e8ncia and balears as separate kingdoms . 
  catalonia was never a kingdom beacause we could n't conquer tarraco , a prerequiste stipulated by the pope . 
  we chose to take over the aragonese throne instead though marriage , which was already a kingdom * and then conquer tarraco * . 
   what existed in the x century was not spain , catalonia , france , etc. 
  it was the personal dominions of some warlords , who married their sons and daughters and/or conquered each other land . 
  with such a generic statement , you can basically explain all history up until modern states , so yeah . 
  yep , nothing bad at all !, 
  as long as your dinasty is ruling the entire thing , of course :p !, 
   and in the map it 's clearly the crown of aragon what is being pictured , is n't it ? 
  also , from your link : that 's what you 're confusing though , beacause ( roughly ) once catalonia got control of the kingdom it became the crown . 
  so yes , we did rule aragon ( obviously ) . 
   c'mon , there 's nothing bad with being a county !, 
  :d you 're confusing the county of barcelona with the entire catalonia ? 
  that 's badhistory worthy , keep reading the link . 
  [ well exxxxcuuuuse mee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/principality_of_catalonia ) ( also kingdom of aragon = / = crown of aragon ) . 
  also , there 's like 3 or 4 catalan kings missing in that chart ( plus what 's up with the spanish translations of the names ? 
   `` catalan empire '' yup, 
  also salou . 
  of course , of couse !, 
  as franco himself said : `` voting is great ! '', 
  well then , is n't this scary , authoritarism is on the rise . 
  surely all will be ok . 
  wooooops , so now democracy * is not ok !, 
  * alright , this is a new one !, 
  maybe since people are stupid they should n't even be able to choose who rules them right ? 
  after all , they 're just a bunch of idiots !, 
  hahaahahahah , saying `` trouble '' instead of `` democracy '' is such a russian mistake !, 
  of course !, 
  it should be standard procedure if there 's a majority in the country in question in favour of it !, 
  it 's not just ` my opinion ' , it 's the established worlwide consensus on standard architectural practice . 
  it 's not just ` my opinion ' , it 's the established worlwide consensus on standard architectural practice . 
  the point is n't about beauty , it 's about history . 
  about understanding that there was something there and now there is n't , that an ancient civilization existed and `` placed those rocks '' . 
  building crap over it takes all value away . 
  and [ palmyra is too a beautiful work of art ] ( http://salamancartvaldia.es/adjuntos/las%20ruinas%20de%20palmira ( 2 \\ ) . jpg ) . 
  would you call it a piece of rubble ? 
  i 'd say it 's a testimony to its age . 
  something which [ too , happens to the mona lisa ] ( http://meetlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/dt.common.streams.streamserver.jpg ) . 
  building over that destroys it and negates any historical value that it might 've had . 
  this is an extremely ignorant opinion . 
  how about while we 're at it paint over the mona lisa ? 
  it 's old and crusty , who cares !, 
  it 's not like art and history matter in any way , let 's make 'em pretty !, 
  when there 's pretty much 0 trace left of the original building there 's not much of a problem . 
  we 're talking about building over pre existing * roman * ruins . 
  it 's another league of fucked up, 
  well yes actually . 
  no amount of photoshop will be able to hide the differential decay of the radically different materials as the contraption ages . 
  plus in doing that , the building lost all architectural value : it 's just a joke of its former self . 
  there 's a reason we do n't rebuild our hundreds of ruined castles here . 
  yeah well , for me and everobody else !, 
  these ruins are our common heritage !, 
  yes !, 
  people need to be aware that this can happen , there 's a lot of misinformation about this topic, 
  yep !, 
  that 's how a proper restoration should look like !, 
  yes , but there 's many ways to restore a building , and if what this article says is true ... well , the ruins are fucked . 
  i would obviously be 100 % ok with a standard procedure restoration . 
  my condolences : /, 
   the concrete cube does n't blend at all with the remains of the tower that 's kinda the point , but yes , the execution could 've been better . 
  i picked this example beacause it 's * so evident * , not beacause it 's well made :p the tower is n't ruined beacause it was n't a tower at all , it was just a ruin . 
  the preservation work attempted to recreate the shape of the old building but not its form , so that we can see how it looked like without pretending to rebuild it . 
  they went a little overboard with the plaster , but hey . 
  [ this cloister , is a good example of a good restoration . 
  subtle , yet concise ... a bit too much for my taste , but meh ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j5gw5ghm7ag/ucxmu09zqsi/aaaaaaaaiuy/pwjzeumkmcu/s1600/p1020714.jpg ), 
  as i said , the execution could be better . 
  but this is where misinformation creates aberrations : rebuilding means that we take the original building ( crumbling and everything ) and just rebuild it . 
  in the xixth century , this was standard practice . 
  do you want to know why we do n't do that anymore ? 
  [ look at notre dame ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/notre_dame_de_paris,_east_view_140207_1.jpg ) . 
  do you see something weird ? 
  yep , the spire is fake , built over the original , beacause they though that `` medieval cathedrals all had spires '' . 
  well guess what , notre dame did n't , and yet they put that monster up there . 
  what i 'm trying to say is this : you either * preserve * what you have and show it as it is or create a fake image of the past , something which will never look as it was and that it will probably end up damaging the original . 
  the tower i linked earlier clearly displays what has reached us from old times , whereas now notre dame has to stand with this aberration on top of it . 
  many german cities are good examples of this , their cathedrals were pretty much obliterated , yet they did n't just `` rebuild them '' . 
  yup !, 
  this is what makes me iffy !, 
  no decent architect would dare to literally * rebuild as it was * . 
  it 's against common sense and standard practice . 
  i think it 's pretty much assumed that it really wo n't look like the romans built it , it 's just an uninteresting fake built over the real thing , hoping to draw unassuming tourists . 
  what i do n't understand is how nobody cared about what would actually happen to the real ruins . 
  it 's fucking sad , i hoped that we had already overcome this `` rebuilding '' mentality ( if you want to see an example of tackiness gone wild , search for the center district of skopje , that 's how it will end up looking ) . 
  i 've studied this issue before ... 
  yes , i agree , we would all like to go back in time and see how ancient rome looked like , and with modern building techniques it 's possible to do so . 
  but using our knowledge of construction to * build over unique ruins * ? 
  if you want to do it , i 'd be much better to do so elsewhere , replicas do n't need to be * on top of the original * . 
  and if you really want to preserve the ruins [ you can do something like this ] ( http://images.adsttc.com/media/images/56e7/56ea/e58e/ceaa/cb00/003f/large_jpg/portada.jpg?1458001634 ) ( i know , i know , maybe they could 've executed it better , but notice how the new part does n't want to imitate the old and is clearly distinguishable ) . 
  this way , the tower wo n't degrade and we 'll still be able to see it as it is , not as we 'd pretend it to be . 
  `` restoring '' is not the same as `` preserving '' .
