  restoring ( as the article states ) means that they will try to recreate the old building with modern materials * over the ruins * . 
  this goes against all architectural theory on the best way to * preserve * our heritage , and means that what will end up happening is that they 'll destroy the ruins ( buildings need foundations ) and end up with horrible imitations . 
  it 's not the first time something like this has happened , sadly . 
  if you want to preserve your ruins , fine , but do n't fuck with them , they 're not a `` plaything '' . 
  please , stop fucking with roman heritage ...  moreover , the site 's amphitheater and forum will be rebuilt so that , in the end , they would look exactly as they did 2000 years ago . 
  this can only mean one thing : a tacky modern building trying to imitate roman styles * built over roman ruins * . 
  what a disaster . 
  spain only allows our national team to play against another country in a friendly match * that they have to allow * . 
  it 's so fucked up i do n't even know . 
  needs more sardenya , two sicillies and neopatria, 
  i mean , i 'm 100 % ok with this, 
  absolutely ... you 're probably trying to get rid of the monarchy are n't you ? 
  papa rajoy would n't like that !, 
  true enough , but try to get one organized right now with all of the fallout . 
  the canaries tried to get one for oil-drill exploitations last year ( i think ) and they found out for themselves, 
   somehow i still think that pdc is more left-wing than the us democrats oh obviously , i mean , the democrats are `` left-wing '' relative to the republicans , but in an european scale ... they 're even more right-wing than pp , way more than that even . 
   yeah typical behaviour . 
  it 's true about the ebre region though , i think there 's also lots of pxc support in there as well but i 'm not quite sure . 
  i mean , i 've always considered the ebre and the vall d'aran to be the most right-wing areas in catalonia . 
  the first beacause it very well might be our local bible-belt and the second beacause rich people monies from the meseta that vacation there . 
   i know , i know , i was just wondering about psc though . 
  psc will swing according to what the population think , as in if the people are pissed at pdc for banning correbous they 'll quickly promise to get them back . 
  though i fear that they might favour pp/c 's beacause of their spanish rethoric , and especially since the ebre area is actually quite right-wing . 
  also , it 's weird : here our `` democrats '' are right-wing and the `` republicans '' left-wing :p, 
  referendum ? 
  in spain ? 
  read carefully , i said pdc :p ^ ( ahhhh new times ), 
  obviously !, 
  it 's a fucking shame , and the only reason that they have n't done it is beacause they fear they might lose the ebre sector , but i hope erc ( which is n't as involved in that area as ... what 's it now pdc ? ), 
  can pull it off, 
  i 'm so fucking glad we banned this idiotic `` fiesta nacional '' . 
  we 've got some cool arenas that we 've [ repurposed beautifully !, 
  ] ( http://www.abrassame.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/348-349-dise-centre_comercial_les_arenes-28-2-12-alb_01_ok_0.jpg ) yay for common sense, 
  [ like this one in sabadell !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbahpnd2qjg ), 
  if people from other countries [ saw things like these ] ( http://www.vocesdepradillo.org/sites/default/files/styles/articulo_completo/public/grafico_politicos.jpg?itok=dlhrrk84 ) ... 
  [ oh , it 's all over the worldddd !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolving_door_ ( politics \\ ) ), 
  though i found a wikipedia article in english about it , so the concept does exist !, 
  maybe we 're not used to seeing it in english, 
  the revolving door, 
  well , some of them are fine , and only a few are actually pure brutalism ( others ... well , good attempts ) . 
  i see it as an experiment on form , architects enjoy doing little things like these when they are given leeway on something like a bus stop . 
  and i did n't know about the metro thing !, 
  god , that 's horrible, 
  i guess ... but still , it 's the most recent and best ww1 game , i 'd have expected some kind of mention at least, 
  what ? 
  [ have you seen these soviet bus stops ? 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/a/xojge ) the soviets actually cared quite a bit for public buildings , but , architectually speaking , that 's about it . 
  yep , ca n't get my head around why it is n't there, 
  it 's beautiful !, 
  i did not know that this existed !, 
  going to northern catalonia makes me depressed . 
  holy shit you killed our birthplace . 
  standard unit in architecture is the meter ( for now :p ), 
  that 's why i voted cup , 
  all erc deputies inside jxs are leftist , what are you even talking about ? 
  jxs is a coalition of a right-wing party and a left-wing one . 
  policy is decided between the two , and `` consensuated '' with the cup , so that cdc does n't overrule it . 
  we do n't have the most right wing ministers in history . 
  pretty much any pujol goverment had more . 
  actually this one might be one of the most leftists just after the tripartits ( which were a shitshow btw ) . 
  you mean this ? 
  :  the reason you are independentist is why we have in catalunya the parliament with most right wing ministers in history . 
  c'mon , try a different thing . 
  it 's simply not true . 
   even if by an act of magic tomorrow we wake up in a functioning independent catalunya , you 'd still have a wide majority of right wing seats on the parliament . 
  there is no winning for the left , and independentism is n't helping it , sorry . 
  independence is the priority , sorry . 
  obviously you ca n't build a new state with * just the left * , and you can see what happens when you do if you go back the republic . 
  though as you 've seen , cdc is diminishing in favour of erc , so secessionists are swinging left , which is good . 
   even if by an act of magic tomorrow we wake up in a functioning independent catalunya , you 'd still have a wide majority of right wing seats on the parliament . 
  ... like any other democratic country ? 
  i mean , i said independentism and not nationalism beacause nationalism has existed in catalonia since late xixth century with the lliga regional and the renaixen\u00e7a movement , so it does n't really make much sense . 
   converg\u00e8ncia has been riding the `` independentist '' train forever , it gave them the `` espanya ens roba '' to do the stealing themselves and they could shit everything that went wrong on the central goverment nope , 2012 . 
  before that they ruled with the help of pp !, 
  pacte del majestic etc. 
  puigdemont is a convinced independentist , i 'm not so sure about mas . 
   the left in catalunya is fucked because , like in all of spain , is extremely factured , the polarization brought by the independentism does n't help either , your options as left-leaner if you do n't want/care of independence is psoe ( we 'll strech the `` left '' definiton here a bit ) . 
  no it is n't fucked since erc is the main party in catalonia , the non-independentist left * is * fucked , i 'll give you that . 
  what a pity . 
  the `` oh yes , we want a referendum for catalonia if spain concedes it '' is the most utterly insulting thing a politician has said recently , and people buy it . 
   where do you think c 's has got all this following [ `` all this following '' ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ca/thumb/a/aa/parlament_2015_independ%c3%a8ncia.svg/1280px-parlament_2015_independ%c3%a8ncia.svg.png ) . 
  it 's pretty meh , honestly . 
  it 's just votes from pp and psc since voting pp in catalonia makes 0 sense ( how do you even vote a party that 's constantly attacking you ) and since psc has basically gone retarded . 
   in any case , face it , catalonia has always tilted to the right and this whole nationalism probably has something to do with it . 
  independentism in catalonia has always been led by the left , and converg\u00e8ncia has only recently ( like 2012 or so ) decided to ride the hype-train too , so nope . 
  you mean the 15m movement in spain ? 
  but that 's old news , like four or five years-ago news . 
  podemos claims to have incorporated them, 
   black estelada  creu de sant jordi yeah , there 's nutjobs everywhere , but we do n't have tv channels 24/7 speweing bullshit ( intereconomia , 13tv , telecinco , antena 3 , sometimes tv1 etc etc ) . 
  i can bet you that it 's disproportionally against us . 
  also , who 's that idiot ? 
   anyway , this post is about love , respect , and tolerance , where you can find lots in madrid these days , not idiots  yeah , let 's stop this . 
  this thread is not about hate, 
   that would be stupid , to hate more than half of the population of catalonia that consider themselves spaniard in different degrees . 
  hate in it of itself is stupid , especially nation-based hate . 
  though [ it 's not like the other side of this does n't enjoy it ] ( https://twitter.com/heroisindepes/media ), 
  latin americans , you say ? 
  you might not like it , but that does n't mean that people can have different opinions than you,
