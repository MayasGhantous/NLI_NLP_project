  the problem comes when people who * do n't * act like they * do *, 
  ... are n't * they * calling the brits to * save * scotland ? 
  really, 
  yet they state it as they must `` save '' them, 
  yeah , i get where you 're coming from , yet i do n't like the message that `` we must save scotland '' ... like do you own them ? 
  it 's * their decision * to do what they want , that 's why they have a referendum !, 
  like i said , i do n't want to criticise the uk as a whole , i 'd say you guys have much more democratical values than spain , so i guess it 's poor wording on their part, 
   just to clarify , the vast majority of public opinion in the whole of britain is that it should be for scotland to choose how it wants to be governed . 
  i think everyone thinks that there should be a democratic , legal process for scotland 's future . 
  my god the envy i 'd say is poor wording on their part ... 
  it gives a message that i do n't quite like that much, 
  yes , but not the power to `` save '' scotland ... 
  i do n't want to push them about that , i 'd say is poor choice of words , but still, 
  that 's the point , you ca n't * save * something that you have no power to rule over , hence self determination, 
  the issue i have is with the brits outside of scotland , not the ones inside of it , yeah, 
  the thing is , you ca n't * save * it , because stating that you consider that scotland is something you own . 
  only the scots can freely chose what they want to do with their land and so `` saving scotland '' ruling their decision power over, 
  to save what ? 
  sorry , but it 's the scots decision to do what they want , not yours . 
  it 's called democracy , and even if i admire the values of uk compared of the response we 're getting from spain i would n't like being ruled over like that if i were a scot ( not that we 've treated like that here for a long time , mind you ), 
  we 've got [ something ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imoxrk9yqw4 ) maybe a bit weirder here in catalonia . 
  ( john is our president and yoko is the ex-chief of the gov party , who was deposed for corruption and crippled the party , hence yoko ) . 
  i can translate lyrics if people want them btw, 
  thank you !, 
  even the unionist in catalonia understand that the will of the people is the one that matters ( around 86 % of the population want to vote ) which is something that rajoy seems to ignore, 
  but lately it is more relevant for us due to the constant denial from madrid ( they even went as far as saying that `` voting is anti-democratic '' ), 
  good , scotland sets a precedent for a pretty fair and decent democratic referendum which nevertheless we 'll try to set up , though sadly without the support of the central gov ( even if that was expected thanks to the low level of democracy that is spain ), 
  yeah :( we 're doing alright now 30 years or so after implementing immersion , but the central gov has always tried to cancel it ( and lately it has been pushing it even harder ), 
  look , let me give you an example about why we ca n't compete . 
  i live in santa coloma de gramenet , a town that in the 1910 had around 10.000 people . 
  by the 1980 there were 130.000 people living there , mostly all from other parts of spain . 
  catalan was never heard in public , due to people not talking it and being forbbiden until recent years , so immersion was started here to * try * to salve our language ... because it was pretty much dying . 
  even then nowadays it 's almost impossible to hear catalan on the streets and the few that we speak it are immediately answered in spanish ( if the rare case that a catalan speaker talks to someone who does n't know in catalan first , which due to having lived here for most of my life i for example almost never do ) even if that guy knew catalan . 
  immersion * is * needed to restore the balance that was lost due to huge immigration waves and the restrictions of the francoist government ( that by the way , we still suffer through the sons of people that came here , never learnt catalan - because why should they , it was forbbiden ! - and speak only in spanish . 
  if these people never had immersion they would n't even understand the language of the country they have lived their * whole * life in ! ), 
   but i 'd say that he jumped directly to your translation yup , i told him something like this before , i 'd say what you propose makes sense ... now imagine a poor confused american from / r/random coming here ... my god * s\u00ed , li he dit algo similar abans , crec que el que proposes t\u00e9 sentit ... imagina ' t un pobre americ\u00e0 conf\u00f3s que vingui d' / r/random ... d\u00e9u meu !, 
  ahhhh so you are referring to the pp 's manipulative campaing of claming to be `` opressed families '' and all that . 
  did they tell you * how * many families claim to be `` opressed '' ? 
  that 's because in all catalonia only six demanded bilinguism , and they were related to the pp party . 
  immersion is needed , because without it , catalan * can not * compete with spanish . 
  a language with 10 milion speakers ca n't compete with another that has vastly more numbers both in catalonia and outside of it ( * all * catalans speak spanish but not all catalans speak catalan , something that maybe is not said in madrid ) without a goverment backing , which is just what immersion does ( which by the way , it 's just that teachers teach in catalan in all clases except the spanish class , * in which catalan students outperform the other communities * ) . 
  coming from someone who does speak 4 languages , do n't be so gullible, 
  * oh , i 've just seen this frenchie doing it ... 
  though i like the idea !, 
  i though you were aswell !, 
  ^ by ^ the ^ way ^ i 'm ^ not , ^ why ^ would ^ i ? 
  suposo que haurem d'esperar la nostra independ\u00e8ncia ... aplaudeixo igualment la teva iniciativa * and i 'd love that mine was oficial so we could all enjoy this intercultural exchange !, 
  i guess we 'll have to wait for our independence ... 
  though i nevertheless aplaud your iniciative !, 
  pardon for asking , but why answer in french if he asked in english ? 
  i understand writing in french directly ( like you did in this thread before ) , it adds a touch of cultural diversity much needed in an anglocentric internet , but i 'd say that he jumped directly to your translation, 
  there are some with burqas , specially in depressed areas and immigrant havens ( most of the cities surrounding barcelona or the bad neighbourhods of lleida for example ) but niqabs are * really * rare ( i do n't remember any ) , i 'd say that it 's because we usually get people from the magreb and they are comparatibly lax with this, 
  the visigoths did n't build the cathedral of c\u00f3rdoba , that 's for certain ... their buildings looked something like [ this ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_onb-4lmtwgk/sku8v7vvifi/aaaaaaaaeui/cu7_fwxipng/s400/san_pedro_de_la_nave.jpg ) . 
  they did use horseshoe arches , but they did n't inspire charlemagne , because themselves were inspired to use them by the muslims, 
  the visigoths did n't do crap , it was all built by the muslims and later used as a cathedral by the castilians , you can see for example plenty of arabesque architecture there like the horseshoe arch or the abstract decoration, 
  and now thanks to our government they are absolutely inneficient due to taxation !, 
  thanks pp !, 
  50 % young adults are unemployed . 
  it will take a while, 
  pls invest in eastern polan, 
  ... or maybe i 'm not a communist and people can objectibly critizise a government that killed milions of people, 
  what ? 
  no i do n't . 
  i just said that stalin was n't communist, 
  oh , because stalin was a communist !, 
  dictadure of the proletariat has never been that, 
  yes , but the company got that and used it as a commercial name . 
  they are trying to comunicate , do n't give them a hard time ^ hehehe, 
  cel \u00b7 lo ( celo in spanish ) for tape ... though i hear that in other parts of the country you use another name ? 
  kleenex for tissues , and cel \u00b7 lo for tape !, 
  oh , but their national bonus accounts for that , do n't worry !, 
  when has manpower been a problem for muscovy anyway ? 
  what ? 
  we must vanquish these copycat frogs !, 
  the all-i-oli is sacred !, 
  * catalan cream , snails , catalan soup ... what else do you want to copy to the french `` quoisine '' ? 
  also agreed , garlic ( butter ? 
  you crazy ? ), 
  makes everything better !, 
  ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mq1ajaqv7w0/uyux0i4bkbi/aaaaaaaakh8/vvdceh586le/s1600/c1.jpg ) ( well it 's weird ... do n't question us ok ? ), 
  no , they usually do them like every other pm , but this guy , rajoy ... he 's peculiar . 
  in this occasion they put a tv on the conference room that streamed that speech that he gave to his audience , so obviously no questions were asked . 
  when he does press conferences , the questions are limited and he does n't stay much time there, 
  he appears in the foto , though yes , my bad, 
  true , but do n't people know rajoy already ? 
  he 's asking to see how leaders of different countries adress to their people ... last time i checked [ ours ] ( http://images.eldiario.es/politica/rajoy-preguntas-periodistas-comparecencia-televisiones_ediima20130202_0131_5.jpg ) was n't pretty good at that, 
  ( spain ) no . 
  he is horrible and even in press conferences he hides [ behind a tv ] ( http://images.eldiario.es/politica/rajoy-preguntas-periodistas-comparecencia-televisiones_ediima20130202_0131_5.jpg ) ... 
  so in a weird sense he does ... 
  the king does a christmas adress ... but it 's void of any meaning , as his figure is, 
  something about agrary exportations and dem ruskies are bad people . 
  that does n't change the fact that once we vote and eventually win the authorities just * ca n't * ignore that, 
  i would tend to agree , it just seems like a popularity contest in which the stronger get stronger and brigadding happensm though i do n't like to circlejerk much on it , it 's just all internet magic point on the end, 
  only nutjobs here suggest such a thing , because we 'll let vote everyone within our census ( yes , we do have one ) and probably win , if it goes accordingly with the polls, 
  that 's what we want aswell !, 
  yeah , sadly people do n't understand that a western nation that could very much be their own does n't care about a chunk of it 's citizens . 
  i belive that when they take us seriously and stop trying to ignore us then they 'll start giving actual offers ... 
  but hey , it 's simple : we will vote for our independence and depending on the outcome do that whatever spain says . 
  once we 're independent there are many possible outcomes ( one is even to remain inside the eu , simply by the fact that there 's no law written about what to do in a seccession ) so we 'll see and act accordingly, 
  pretty much seems like it ...
