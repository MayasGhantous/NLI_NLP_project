  some official documents are also publicated in catalan aswell . 
  mp still can not talk in that language and obviously the spanish mps ( from pp and psoe basically ) are known to be at fault for obstructing the process of officialization , an unique situation given the fact that even gaeligue was proposed as an official language by ireland despite only having 130.000 speakers . 
  so yes , it can be done and yes , it 's spain 's fault that it has n't been . 
  so am i. 
  there are catalan mps in pretty much every single european chamber , that 's why we want to be able to speak in catalan there ( among many other reasons ) . 
  and yes , we also proposed it for the spanish chambers too . 
  catalan mp have already proposed it and it failed beacause of the spanish vote against, 
  yeah that was weird ... 
  i 'm guessing it was the easiest model to use available ? 
  no , valencian is the name given to catalan by speakers of the valencian dialect . 
  like castilian/spanish . 
  sorry i do n't follow ? 
  yes , they 're official in the respective communities , but not in the state : catalan ca n't be spoken in the congreso , for example, 
  welp , then they were plain wrong . 
  the official consensus has always been in favor of it being a dialect . 
  it 's kinda scary that it had been taught to children . 
  '' ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/acad%c3%a8mia_valenciana_de_la_llengua ), 
  in that case , it shows poor editing by wikipedia . 
  there is no political disctinction , valencian is classified as a dialect of catalan by catalan * and * valencian linguists alike . 
  the issue arose thanks to ideological manipulation by the spanish ex-ruling party in valencia ( pp ) which aimed to strain relations with catalonia , but thankfully now it 's in the past . 
  [ there really are n't that many official languages ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/linguistic-diversity/official-languages-eu_en.htm ) , so not that i know of . 
  countries like malta though , which have maltese and english both as official languages are both recognised by the eu . 
  standard prodedure is to recognise the officiality of the language of the state , but it can be voted to recognise any language that request it . 
  the only reason catalan is n't recognised is beacause of spanish pressure . 
  the eu institutions get to decide which language is official or not for their chambers , not the spanish . 
  our beef is with both . 
  the latest official report as of 2014 [ situates catalan at over 10m speakers ] ( http://blogs.iec.cat/cruscat/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2011/11/informe-2014-conclusions.pdf ) . 
  12,8 m people understand it out of the 13m people that live in the catalanospeaking area and it is the 16th most spoken language in europe and , if we take into account people that have it as a second language , the 7th most spoken . 
  i do n't know where wikipedia got that data from , it seems pretty fake honestly ( there 's at least 8m people living in catalonia , and catalan is not only spoken here , [ it has a much bigger area ] ( http://www.llull.cat/_img_cultura/territori_catala.gif ) ) the catalan wikipedia reports much higher numbers too ( 11,5 m , i must 've missed a newer report ) , so it seems iffy . 
  it 's bigger than any scandinavian language and most slavic . 
  well then , welcome to our club , maltese speakers . 
  +10 m speakers , one of the most spoken languages in europe and we also ca n't speak our language in the eu parliment or any spanish chamber , the biggest by far non-recognised language in europe ( bigger than most of the recognised ), 
  i guess they were going for architectural works more than anything else , but really the delta works are more representative, 
  what was the building for the netherlands ? 
  there 's a monolithic opinion on this sub . 
  and you ca n't go against it, 
  and catalan , and spanish, 
  you need to go to a * forn * or * fleca * for that ( a real one , not one of those `` panificadoras '' ) . 
  traditional breads usually are n't in supermarkets, 
  down here we prefer white bread . 
  we have a crapton of shapes for it , and another crapton ways of making ` sandwiches ' ( which are n't even that but there 's no closer word for ` entrep\u00e0 ' ), 
  well , all are white except the very very traditional catalan black bread , but you 'll only find that stuff in towns . 
  it has a bit of a ` legendary ' status behind it , since that 's what people ate in the post-war period . 
  the rest of ` brown ' breads are considered ` for hippies ' or ` diggestive ' and take that as you want :p, 
  wait , people do like that ? 
  i thought it was some sort of `` diggestive '' bread . 
  at least it 's how it 's viewed down here, 
  i like'em , and our rich guys too, 
  most are either basque or catalan , which have pretty different cuisines than the rest of the penninsula ( even if addmitedly , most spanish regions do have their own cuisine too ) . 
  ferran adri\u00e0 with his * bulli * set the trend for high-end catalan restaurants , dominating the field for almost a decade until he retired . 
  goddammit can roca is best roca , gib back award !, 
  ( on a more serious note though , congratulations !, 
  beating roca must mean that they 're an exceptional restaurant ! ), 
  shorts + t-shirt is definetely above 24\u00ba for me ( at least ) . 
  it goes more or less like this : 45 : baptism of fire 40\u00ba : pretty much unbearable 35\u00ba : pretty hot , avoid sun 30\u00ba : hot 25\u00ba : warm 22,5 : perfecte temp -  from here and upwards t-shirt weather 20\u00ba : cool 15 : chilly 10 : cold 5 : freezing cold 0 : avoid -5 : death by ice ( very very rare around here ) -10 : never been this cold and never want to be, 
  18 is too damm cold !, 
  i have to wear a jacket !, 
  45 % of relative humidity in a city between two rivers and the sea , it 's not bad . 
  usually it 's much much worse, 
  oh well , mild heat is some heat i guess, 
  i dunno , i just checked my phone and that 's what it said ... though i guess the south of the penninsula is much hotter now :p, 
  what the fuck . 
  is this normal ? 
  down here it only snows once every five years or so ... and for just an afternoon, 
  24\u00ba at 10pm with low humidity , it 's perfect weather down here in barcelona, 
  welp , reddit screwed up, 
  nah , pretty much everyone knows that they 're the same . 
  if they can sell it as `` saving ejpa\u00f1a '' from the dirty communists it wo n't create much fallout . 
  since pp actually tried to make a pact with psoe in the first place it will probably harm psoe a bit more than pp , but if they 're smart it wo n't be that bad for them . 
  also for some reason i ca n't see this comment chain , only in the reply box, 
  i mean , we just broke bipartidism for the first time since ... 1982 ? 
  the state is a bit unstable at the moment, 
  weeell ... 
  i suppose so . 
  but they 're not extremists like they 're sometimes painted as , their policies are pretty much the same as any social-democrat party in northern europe, 
  my money is on pp-psoe-ciudadanos , since they all happen to misteriously agree that podemos is the devil and ciudadanos actually tried to make this happen in this legislation with no success . 
  once they try again , they all win ( pp will probably put their own president since they 're the biggest party - getting rid of rajoy - , psoe will look like it has made a move `` for the state '' being forced to pact with pp `` for spain '' and ciudadanos will look like `` the negotiatior that saved spain from the * rojos/communists * '' ), 
  psoe is `` socialist '' in the sense that it actually is whatever they want to be once they are in power . 
  they drifted pretty much to the right and they 're probably a center-kinda-left party now . 
  also , podemos has n't been stained by the tons of corruption scandals that stain the old parties, 
  i do n't . 
  and you could make that same gif for basically all of the 4 major parties ( yes , including ciudadanos/pp 2.0 which seems to get a lot of love here ) . 
  edit : also / u/monkeyseemonkeydoodo i for some reason ca n't see your reply or my reply ... weird, 
  i mean , we kinda copied the flag after them and cuba , so it 's understandable :p, 
  barcelona is in europe as far as i know, 
  i mean . 
  you come here and try to live without ac, 
  it 's just that the `` monarchic union -  spain '' gets so repeated that people forget that , at the same , it was pretty common ( poland-lithuania , england-scotland pre act of union , etc ) . 
  it makes no sense though , beacause for the same reason half of germany should be also `` spain '' when charles i became king, 
  yep , tell me about it, 
  it 's preeetty weird , i 'd almost say it 's made up ... 
  it screams 60 ' like no other !, 
  i have a deep love/hate relationship with daring buildings like this one, 
  so basically mallorca and the canary islands ? 
  and these resorts are shitty as fuck , you get pampered to hell and back but never actually visit the country, 
  the tallest building in barcelona will be the sagrada fam\u00edlia !, 
  so yes , a church will still be the tallest !, 
  ( despite the fact that it will be * the tallest church in the world at around 180m but hey * ), 
  can tell you for a fact that at least for spain it is n't . 
  at all,
