  i 'm not talking about franco himself , so it is irrelevant if sanjurjo ( yes , i know history too mate ) died or not in a plane , etc etc or if the civil war was inevitable . 
  i 'm talking about the fact that , with a favourable posture from the us the war would n't have ended like it did what is a known fact is that jfk dad , joseph p. kennedy sr. basically told the uk : `` if either you or france helps the republicans , you will get no help from the us in the upcoming war '' . 
  that plus chamberlain 's appeasement policy forced france ( who wanted to help ) to decide to close down the border and kickstart the shitshow that was the non-intervention comitee . 
  shipping of supplies to the republic like the us did to the uk * since the start of ww2 , so yes , the country was ready for that * could 've singehandedly saved the republic . 
  also , the us joined the allies as a beligerant beacause japanese involvement and it being allied to germany but hey, 
  did i say something about the us as a whole ? ... 
  aaaaaalright , carry on then, 
  yet supporting franco or not made absolutely no difference on the fact that ww2 happened , and what ended up happening was that he won , when otherwise spain could 've been saved ( and historians agree that this is a pretty safe hypothesis to make ), 
  also , did you know jfk 's dad was one of the main reason franco got to power ? 
  he was hypercatholic and forced france and uk to refrain supporting the republic , beacause if they did so he promised ( as ambassador of the us to the uk ) that they would recieve no help from the us in case of ww2, 
  ( arguably the reference makes more sense in english but hey :p ), 
  nah , my bad , i see how it could be misinterpreted given the context, 
  they are n't , most ( if not all ) of the buildings are privately owned . 
  the `` tax '' is in a metaphorical sense , in which they extort tourists with outrageous prices beacause of `` antoni gaud\u00ed '' . 
  i can understand it in the sagrada fam\u00edlia beacause * it 's in construction * , even if i do know that they 're loaded , but the rest of the buildings are plain money gouging, 
  ehhhh i mean , barcelona is n't always like that ( full of drunks and all , though true , it 's a constant swarm of tourists ) . 
  but :  and sitges here 's your problem, 
  also called `` the gaud\u00ed tax '' , where every building he made is expensive as fuck , even for locals, 
  hahaahahaahah i mean , there are actualy english migrants on the south of spain , and they 've set up some pretty getto villages , only difference being that they 've spent enough money to make them nice but oh , they do n't integrate at all !, 
  how 's that for a change :p, 
  also : drunk and utterly lost, 
   really ? 
  nothing ? 
  there were no cultural , economic , religious , military or demographic ties at all . 
  only two monarchs . 
  wow . 
  i mean , it 's pretty comparable to castille & portugal , navarre & castille or other kingdoms under the same king . 
  each had its own army ( more or less , though certainly true in the case of castille and aragon ) for example , though there were also different lawsets ( that still somewhat continue to exist today , the corpus jurii of catalonia is a direct descendant of aragonese law , not castilian ) , etc. 
   simply untrue . 
  the castilian city of seville was the only port authorized to trade in the new world , but that does not mean that people in aragon could n't go to the americas . 
  of course they could . 
  many did . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  -  oh my god . 
  the `` indianos '' emergence ocurred everywhere across spain during the xix century , ( asturias , galicia , even the canary islands ) not only in catalonia . 
  and it has nothing to do with the annexation of aragon . 
  of course , but it * especially increased in catalonia * beacause the regulations against aragonese citizens were lifted , beacause `` aragonese citizen '' was no longer a thing . 
  you can `` oh my god '' all you want , though that 's not that much of a solid argumentation, 
  it 's not an apt comparison . 
  the only thing aragon and castille shared was the ruler , nothing else . 
  people in aragon could n't go into the americas , for example , beacause that was castilian land . 
  that 's why when aragon was annexed there was a sudden surge of catalans trying to make money in the new world ( the indianos ) , a new opportunity that they before did n't have, 
  yeah , but what i mean by that is that aragon existed until 1714 , just as portugal continued existing during the union . 
  there was no `` spain '' until aragon was conquered and annexed , since we each had different laws , states , etc. 
  and only shared a ruler . 
  spain back then was a geographical term that refered to the countries under the personal union of the monarch that happened to rule there, 
  and yet you 're commiting the same mistake , since what you call `` spain '' was n't an unified state back then too , it was also a personal union ... 
  and we ( aragon ) shared it from 1492 to 1714 * and yet we 're lumped into `` spain '' even harder than you , when it was a personal union of castille and aragon * . 
  so yeah , we have it worse :p, 
  barca ( the c is pronounced like a `` k '' in this case ) means `` boat '' in catalan and spanish ... 
  it 's weird . 
  that 's why we use the '' \u00e7 '' for bar\u00e7a , which is pronounced like an `` s '' . 
  when pronouncing barcelona , the `` c '' is pronounced also like an `` s '' , so it does n't make sense . 
   latin culture of san diego is primarily mexican which is not like spain 's at all ( which feels very european ) . 
  also , here the culture is n't even spanish , but catalan, 
  huh , i thought it was way closer, 
  barcelona is one of the most tech active areas in europe , though not the most , and certainly not at silicon valley level, 
  are you counting l'hospitalet ? 
  that by itself is another milion, 
  it is much smaller , but the idea of the resort town is exactly the same , and it 's the place in europe most dedicated to that purpose . 
  also , you should n't look at it population wise , since the town booms at summer, 
  small correction , `` bar\u00e7a '' is the football team , barna is the city, 
   san francisco landmarks are superior in that regard ( i mean , the golden gate is so kewl ) yeah but what else ? 
  for me at least [ gaud\u00ed ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/sagrada_familia_nave_roof_detail.jpg ) [ singlehandedly ] ( http://www.moodychicas.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/gaudi_hector.jpg ) [ takes ] ( http://www.finanzas.com/archivos/201602/gaudi-house-park-guell.jpg ) [ the ] ( https://cdn.civitatis.com/guias/barcelona/fotos/la-pedrera.jpg ) [ cake ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/la_pedrera_001.jpg ) [ for ] ( http://lamonomagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/guell3.jpg ) [ barcelona ] ( http://a2fa47a6c9c5bf39ea51-ab7a78013bae9d9d010e69fee77c4452.r10.cf1.rackcdn.com/lps/assets/u/palau-guell-lemeridienbarcelona.jpg ) . 
  and obviously we 've got much more than that !, 
  [ not always : csa climates are subtropical whereas csb are temperate , and both can be considered mediterranean ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mediterranean_climate )  under this classification , dry-summer climates ( csa , csb ) usually occur on the western sides of continents . 
  csb zones include areas normally associated not with mediterranean but with oceanic climates , such as much of the pacific northwest , much of southern chile , parts of west-central argentina , portugal and spain , under this category , barcelona has a temperate climate and is mediterranean, 
  i mean , madrid and barcelona metro areas are pretty much equal in population , but i 'd say barcelona has more of a cultural aspect than san diego . 
  it 's hard to compare though, 
  the miami of europe is and has always been [ benidorm ] ( http://www.immoabroad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/benidorm.jpg ) . 
  also , barna is not even close to `` subtropical '' ... you 'd have to go to the canary islands for that barcelona is closer to sanfran , lots of culture , `` mediterranean feel '' and cool landmarks, 
  yeah , that 's why it 's called the `` head of the state '' cup , there 's plenty of politicians , the anthem is played , etc etc. 
  oh i 'm sorry , so now beacause it defends the * statu quo * it is n't political ? 
  oh my mistake !, 
   i will still have to disagree , by saying it can be acceptable to ban harmless pieces of cloth or verbal opinions or signs or any other method of expression in certain circumstances , as long as the ban is politically neutral/fair in intent and practice , does n't significantly impede public discourse , etc. 
  sports events make sense as an exception , though if they are n't , they should n't be for anyone . 
  thing is , even a judge from madrid has overruled the decision from the goverment just a few hours ago , basically using my argumentation , and i understand where you 're coming from , but this cup ( yep , the tournament ) has always been about the politics . 
  not in europe there are n't, 
  tell that to iceland , norway , finland , chezkia , slovakia , slovenia , ukaine , latvia , estonia , lithuania , poland , malta , romania ... 
  i 'm part of it , of course . 
  * fuuuuuuuck freedom of expression yay !, 
  and as i said , rarely if ever are started by the progressive sides . 
  anyhow , are we in control of an army ? 
  not that i know of , though madrid is, 
  the king 's cup has always been a political coup , it was basically franco 's popularity cup just a few years ago . 
  it makes perfect sense to be * the * match in witch * estelades * are displayed and it also makes perfect sense * why * some retards in madrid want to ban them . 
  banning a harmless piece of cloth * used to express an opinion * is essentially banning that opinion and so freedom of expression is not allowed . 
  there is n't much more to it, 
  hahahaahahaa yeah , cambo was a reactionary and so were the carlistes ( which pretty much were non-existant in catalonia in the later stages ... and happened in the xixth century so how is this relevant again ? ) . 
   and btw nice current year meme . 
  go back to / pol /, 
  nah , here we had eta ( well here , in the basque country ) and even they , terrorists as they are , have understood that violence makes no sense in this context and de-armed  good luck to you !, 
  thank you !, 
  yep !, 
  first , the spanish army is shit and ca n't do anything at all , and second both the eu and the onu would impede it . 
  it makes no sense at all that a first-would country would become a `` syria '' of sorts . 
  we 're working on that actually , our parliment has an absolute majority of seccessionists after winning last elections ( which acted as a plebiscite of sorts ) , so we 'll see what happens . 
  smaller countries are definitely better in terms of quality of life, 
  well yes , but that does n't make it right , quite the contrary , so it 's just another line in a big text of offences against catalonia that we will protest against, 
  but since we 're in the 21st century and are just fighting for the freedom of our people peacefully there is 0 chance of war , at least by our side .
