  we share a lot of values with france and portugal too !, 
   this one is ... 
  i do n't even know where to begin . 
  covadongas significance is not due to the kingdom of asturias , but due to being the starting point of the reconquista . 
  you know what catalonia was during the reconquista ? 
  yes , it was leading its own reconquesta with jaume i in front , often fighting against the castilians for control of territory . 
  at the time of covadonga though we were part of the moorish taifas . 
  so it was completely irrelevant for us , since our `` main '' battle was in poitiers , which made us part of the gothia ( carolingian empire ) . 
   so , there 's no `` we '' . 
  the concept of a unified catalonia is modern as fuck . 
  the borders of modern catalonia are also new yeah no . 
  it is not . 
  principality of catalonia , the republic of pau claris , the counties of barcelona , etc. 
   suddenly , the counts of barcelona had as much authority as the king of aragon . 
  beacause they were . 
  since they were the same person . 
  holy fuck you are ignorant . 
   want an independent catalonia ? 
  fine , get a decent argument and modify the constitution . 
  but do not reinvent the history of europe to suit your interests . 
  the referendum can be made under the current constitution , this is just a bullshit excuse . 
  but whatever , have a nice day . 
   i find it a bit amusing that you think about basques and catalans , and not canarians , or andalusians , or manchegos , or asturians , as if they do n't matter . 
  they 'd be part of spain , if we 're a federation i assume they would n't have state status beacause sincerely it would be autonomias 2.0 and we 'd be out if that were the case . 
  that 's why they do n't matter , since the capital would be already in their home turf . 
  unless galicia is its own state too , which again , i doubt . 
   you can call it cami de sant jaume if you like it better , it 's the same thing . 
  it 's changing history , which i honestly do n't like . 
   then you have a bunch of castillian and leonese kings that were educated in santiago , the fact that saint james is the patron saint of spain , that he was the lead figure in the reconquista , that the order of santiago was spread all over spain ( even velazquez was a member !, 
  ) , and so on . 
  which is , again , relevant only to spain . 
   there 's no single unifying city in the iberian peninsula , but santiago comes pretty damn close , even taking into account all the different nationalities of spain . 
  i understand , santiago * is * more or less the historic unifier of the penninsula mainly due to its importante not being bound by politics but by religion . 
  i do n't know if that is the right precedent to give prevalence to , however . 
   if we ca n't have santiago , we should build a new capital in covadonga and be done with it and how is covadonga relevant to catalonia ? 
  we were part of the carolingian empire , not asturias :p, 
  but how is that relevant to basques/catalans ? 
  i mean , it does make sense in a historical context for the camino and all but still . 
  it could be a spiritual capital of sorts , like nara in japan . 
  damm galicians !, 
  that 's too damm much ambiguity !, 
  though you also gave us rajoy , so yeah , that 's a paddlin ', 
  thought about it , it would make the portuguese pretty happy , but i feel like too much spanish history has happened over in galicia . 
  the bad kind of history . 
  besides , it 's far tooooo over theeeeree !, 
  maybe in your country, 
  1000 % andorra la vella for capital of the federation . 
  imagine the roadtrips to get there ( since it does n't even have an airport , it relies on barcelona/lleida/girona ), 
  actually yes . 
  but the capital should never be in spain . 
  also , what guarantee would we have that spain would n't basically dominate it due to its bigger population ? 
  i vote donosti for capital . 
  run now that you can you fools, 
  it does . 
  the [ torres trade ] ( http://www.ara.cat/2017/02/10/suplements/diumenge/torres-trade_1739836225_38680087_3445x2680.jpg ) by the same architect , the [ torre agbar ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/torre_agbar.jpg/1200px-torre_agbar.jpg ) ( due to its impressive structural solution imho , not its design ) , [ gas natural 's hq ] ( https://arquites.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/gas-natural-towerbarcelona-002-1hsbqcu1.jpg ) and guess what , the [ sagrada fam\u00edlia ] ( http://www.mycity-web.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/barcelona-la-sagrada.jpg ) ( which will be the tallest building in the city upon completion ) . 
  but none of these examples are as evil looking as these two , and this post was a paradody of [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/643i1n/skyscrapers_of_europe_the_dark_tower_hotel_torni/ ), 
  yes he did !, 
  it 's a very cool logo to be honest . 
  the architect of the towers , jos\u00e9 antonio coderch was one of the best architects spain has ever had !, 
  yep , sadly they burned about 2 years apart , which is a pretty freak strike . 
  so with the liceu reconstruction it so happened that they had just recently documented every single decoration and detail in the building in case something like this were to happen , which it did . 
  so we ended up with a * very * high-tech ( think [ moving-floors style ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_caic1_uoflm/tqeyi_a5szi/aaaaaaaaaoc/_vfcuy4yviw/s1600/foto-liceu-seccio-perfil-2.jpg ) ) opera house with accurate ancient decor . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  i studied the construction of this building and it was amazing !, 
  they had two tubes extracting water with about 20cm in diameter each functioning at all times due to natural underground rivers flowing through the lower levels !, 
  it was * hard *, 
  [ just like the liceu in barcelona !, 
  ] ( http://www.circulodelliceo.es/media/instalaciones/galeria/teatro-liceo/liceu2.jpg ) ( before someone posts it :p ), 
  oh , not in an `` institutional '' sense i mean . 
  there 's a certain portion of the userbase very very anti-catalan here , guess what flairs they use . 
  meanwhile the barcelona tram that has barcelona , spain , posted with a spanish flair has +80 upvotes . 
  thank you , appreciate it !, 
  yeah , but being the capital of catalonia itself it should deserve a mention at least . 
  it is done for scotland for example , and for us too , usually . 
   barcelona , spain did n't see the second part in the original thread title though tbh . 
  anyway , here 's our most iconic tram ( in bcn ) , the [ tramvia blau ] ( https://www.barcelonabusturistic.cat/image/image_gallery?uuid=cb992d70-cbec-47dc-9b04-817066565ea1&amp;groupid=10136&amp;t=1272629620604 ), 
  this is / r/europe , catalonia is not allowed, 
  tyty, 
  esperanto  catalan confirmed, 
  are we even able to line up the stars correctly ? 
  we 're fighting back !, 
  error ? 
  this is absolutely not true . 
  like , literally , everything you said is false . 
  catalonia is a nation . 
  catalonia was n't `` absorbed '' into aragon , it ruled aragon ( the house of barcelona was the ruling house of the kingdom during most of its history and certainly during its relevant years ) . 
  it separated many times and always had a distinct identity and culture , proof of which resides in the specially brutal treatment it has always recieved in wars of agression by spain/castille . 
  only the most conservative of spaniards deny that catalonia is a nation by itself nowdays . 
  there 's a bunch of reasons for it , i myself would forget a lot of them . 
  [ here 's a quick 10 point list ] ( https://americansforcatalonia.wordpress.com/why-support-catalonia/reasons-for-independence/ ) though number 10 is a bit ... silly . 
  the goverment of catalonia will organize one , against the will of the state . 
  yes there are !, 
  we will vote before the end of september , no matter what . 
  either madrid allows it or we vote unilaterally . 
  it 's a bit of a stab at all of those * excellent * people that call us that in the state i live in :p, 
  catalonia ( i must admit i do n't actually have my country 's name in my flair . 
  technically . ), 
  good luck !, 
  here 's hoping we can join you really soon !, 
  they also did one in the vault , in celebration of its 600th year anniversary .
