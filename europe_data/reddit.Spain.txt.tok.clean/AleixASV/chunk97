  it 's just illogical . 
  languages do not adhere to states . 
  yup , it makes no sense . 
  also , catalan has waaaayyy more speakers than this map depicts . 
  it think it was around 11 or 12m ? 
  catalan has more speakers than half of the languages you included . 
  1 state = 1 language does not make any sense when speaking about languages and is flatout just wrong . 
  catalan , basque , galician , etc. 
  are not included . 
  catalan is especially weird , beacause half of the languages in this map have less speakers than it . 
  ... bendy ? 
  gta vi boat edition ? 
  i 'd buy it . 
  but if you want it in barcelona just spell the whole name or write either bcn or barna ( though they are n't used much ) :p, 
  oh yeah , mortadelo and filem\u00f3n was/is ( i think they still make them ) a goldmine and basically a spanish national treasure . 
  there are a total of 205 volumes , and it is still ongoing since 1958 . 
  so , yeah , it is waaay more repetitive than even the simpsons :p !, 
  i 'd say spanish culture is quite campy and here in catalonia we actually are a bit more into the `` calmness '' of franco-belgians , but with an `` innocent-ish '' touch : [ teo ] ( http://elpetitijo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/teo2.jpg ) , [ rovell\u00f3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvxasexbqv0 ) , [ les tres bessones ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdy-lsh8laq ) ( which were both cartoons ) represent this `` kids '' side , whereas we did n't really have much of a local comic tradition as is . 
  we mostly translated franco-belgians and spanish comics , we did have [ ot el bruixot ] ( http://www.normaeditorial.com/libros_img/01203430401_g.jpg ) , but he was quite minor . 
  he and all of the tintin , spirou el fant\u00e0stic ( i just remembered that guy !, 
  ) , etc. 
  appared on the [ cavall fort magazine ] ( http://blocs.mesvilaweb.cat/wp-content/uploads/sites/1499/2012/05/bg9nb19jyxzhbgxmb3j0xzuwyw55cw==_220457_6705_1.jpg ) . 
  oh and by the way , the `` tres bessones '' that i mentioned before is our national treasure . 
  * everybody * knows them , and * everybody * loves them . 
  cartoons were waaay bigger than comics here . 
  huh , i did n't know about those two !, 
  they have n't been translated to catalan , but i see that they had a spanish translation . 
  [ pepe gotera y otilio ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pepe_gotera_y_otilio ) is another ib\u00e1\u00f1ez classic ( more or less meaning `` pepe leak and otilio , botched jobs home delivered '' ) , or [ el boton\u00e9s sacarino ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/el_botones_sacarino ) too , and , overall all of his comics share this weird self-deprecating style that is funny and way more campy than franco-belgian comics ( which we tend to find more `` serious '' but equally good ! ) . 
  looking back , mortadelo were my favourite , but tintin ( and especially his movies ) were a close second . 
  dupond i dupont ( i guess translators got lazy ) in catalonia though !, 
  tintin was huge here when i was growing up !, 
  mortadelo y filem\u00f3n were definetely the biggest in spain . 
  13 rue del percebe kinda too , and basically anything penned by ib\u00e1\u00f1ez was huge . 
  though at least i read tintin , ast\u00e8rix and others too ( i actually * watched * smurfs and lucky luke , as cartoons and not comic , though i do have a smurfs comic ) . 
  i was in kathmandu before the quake , during the revolution against their king . 
  yes , there were outages , and of course there was poverty , it was n't a first world country , what did you expect ? 
  and still , people went on with their lives and did have housing , food , electricity , water , etc. 
  no army was threatening their city . 
  despite the burning tires and barricades . 
   nobody is dying never said that  travel to places in india , africa or south east asia i have , not true . 
  they are n't in the middle of a war , they have housing , electricity and running water , sanitary services , food , income , etc. 
  war ( and calamity ) negates all of that . 
  and that 's why they are refugees . 
   your buying into a lie if you think your saving lives and doing a disservice to millions of genuinely poor people when you spend billions helping only those rich and steong enough to make it to europe . 
  they are neither rich nor strong , and you 're just a liar . 
  also , this is a fallacy . 
  we can help both . 
   if you think these people are going to leave the comfort your country on mass to go back and rebuild their own your deluded . 
  they have a better standard of living in europe now unemployed than they did in pre war syria . 
  you just contradicted yourself . 
  were n't they so rich and strong , did n't they have such a good life ? 
  would you abandon your homeland , friends , family , the place where raised if it was so good ? 
  you 're acting like this is the first refugee crisis in the history of mankind . 
  sure , some will stay , but most actually want to go back . 
  they are refugees of war , not immigrants . 
  most of them actually want to get back home and rebuild the country , and i belive it is our duty to take them in meanwhile . 
  after all , refugees are a constant on every nation 's history , since war has touched them all . 
  they should not be despised and this demonstration aims to change that mindset . 
  dunno , i do n't think human life has to be valued in terms of usability, 
  thank you . 
  i 've been arguing with some of these local spaniards for almost a year now and they 've never ever tried to think that maybe independentism is n't the devil . 
  yet they even claim to be from podemos . 
  however of course , there 's a lot of nice people too , yet i 'm saddened to see that they just conform to the opinion of the first and do n't even engage that much in these threads . 
  it 's sad . 
  yup , i 've already been called a racist , `` that independentist guy '' , a shill , etc. 
  also , they seem to think that pp is n't conservative or that they care about refugees . 
  and again , i do n't dispute that . 
  you seem to belive that i think that there 's different races in spain or something , which i do n't . 
  ah yeah , i actually think they just do n't care , but now that they 've seen the demonstration i guess they 'll make a statement or something i hope . 
  oh and by the way , do n't mind the guy harping about i 'm a racist or something , he just cherrypicks year old replies in obscure threads to make me look bad . 
  not the first time it has happened . 
  so , except from the passive-agresiveness , i mostly agree with you . 
  just that i do n't really buy pp being pro-refugee , since they have n't even taken in a thousand of the 16000 that they promised to take , but hey . 
  you do n't need to be so hostile . 
  oh , well then we agree . 
  how strange , people can talk and things . 
  [ i did ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5uteo8/thousands_in_barcelona_urge_spain_to_take_in_more/ddwwx4t/ ) . 
  i never argued that there were different ethincities in spain , just that we had more in common with someone from perpiny\u00e0 than someone from sevilla , due to literal close proximity . 
  also , random question , but were n't the iberian tribes separate from the celts that inhabited the rest of the penninsula ? 
  [ as in , this map ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/iberia_300bc-en.svg/450px-iberia_300bc-en.svg.png ), 
  liberal is n't conservative ( and i disagree , they 're both conservative and liberal ) . 
  also , they do n't rule catalonia , they are in coalition with a left wing party . 
   if you look at the 21st century you 'll see that actually spain has been ruled by conservatives more than catalonia has . 
  -   are we going to stick to the current time frame ? 
  what ? 
  how is that not true ? 
  i ca n't even belive how you can justify yourself . 
  is pp not conservative ? 
  and again , pp is much more conservative than ciu ever was , at least on social issues . 
  and yeah , they 've ruled for a long time but if you look at the 21st century you 'll see that actually spain has been ruled by conservatives more than catalonia has . 
  look at a map . 
  look how close perpiny\u00e0 and barcelona are . 
  now look at how far c\u00f3rdoba and barcelona are . 
  also , learn a bit of history , val\u00e8ncia and \u00c0vila are n't andalucia , and you seem to imply that northern catalonia was only that for 350 years or that spain existed for 5000 , which are both false . 
  ... jxs is not a conservative party , and they 're ruling with the extreme left . 
  you do n't have to be a leftist to be pro-refugee . 
  or is that the excuse that pp uses ? 
  yeah , barcelona is as progressive as any other big city in spain * but * the key difference here is that even our most right-wing party ( pdc ) openly welcomes refugees and has met with the organizers of the demonstration . 
  they * actually * want to help .
