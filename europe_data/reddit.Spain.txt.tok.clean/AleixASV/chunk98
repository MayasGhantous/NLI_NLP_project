  apart from that , erc , our left-wing party , is polling miles ahead of pdc , so that 'd actually make us more progressive than spain , in which pp seems to never let go . 
  ... and since when are nations tied to genetics ? 
  you 're hilarious , i just mentioned that borders are political constructs and here we go again . 
  yeah , i 'm done . 
  source ? 
  then i hope you 're right, 
  pp promised to take 16000 refugees and they have n't even taken in a 1000 . 
  statements do n't mean shit . 
  i 'm glad that the rest of the state is too pro-refugee , maybe this demonstration will kickstart the movement there too . 
  well , then why is pp the most voted party ? 
  i mean , honest question . 
  look , this thread is not the place to discuss genetics and i already made my point . 
  [ i was talking about this , but i did n't think about mentioning it ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalu%c3%b1a_vieja ) . 
  also yes `` lol '' , catalonia is a nation , deal with it ( sunglasses and all ) . 
   i 'm the other guy , that 's my old account . 
  as simple as that . 
  how convenient . 
  anyway , i do n't care , you may be saying the truth , but i 've seen a lot of sketchy shit coming from spaniards on reddit , so this definitely would n't be the first time ( or the second ) . 
  yeah , stop cherrypicking , post the full comment :  ... i am serious . 
  catalonia is a nation , wether you like it or not , and that 's undeniable . 
  we the catalans come from over the pyrenees , from the languedoc ( ** northern catalonia ** and all that ) , so we have more in common with the people of the south of france than for example a galician ( remnants of the old visigoth kingdoms ) , andalusian ( heavy arabic influences ) or of course a basque i said languedoc beacause who the fuck knows what 's northern catalonia apart from a catalan , honestly . 
  languedoc is the closest thing , but it 's too far north . 
  remind me again when i talked about ethnicity ? 
  i was making the same argument that i just did ( ie . 
  cultural similarities ) . 
  your fallacies are pretty weak mate . 
  if you continue reading , ** people were stating that no , the catalans over the border in france have more in common with a guy from paris than a catalan from an andalusian beacause of the magic of borders ** , and i responded saying this :  no , i 'm not saying that . 
  i refuse to belive that the people in perpiny\u00e0 , who , 400 years ago shared our state , culture , language and laws are now magically miles away genetically from us and meanwhile a guy down in malaga is disproportionally more related to me . 
  borders are political creations , not human barriers you can read it as you just did , with prejudice , assuming that i said that we 're different from an andalusian , but what i really meant is * that we 're just not that different from the french * , nevermind the andalusians . 
  of course , this does n't suit your narrative , and you wo n't really change your mind , but hey , that 's prejudice 101 . 
  ** also ** , what the hell are you doing looking for literally a year old thread , with my comment buried among others ? 
  are you even paid to spin against independentism or something ? 
  beacause you should . 
  so when 's our referendum coming ? 
  after all , most pp voters are pro-referendum are n't they ? 
  oh , and what about that third republic eh ? 
  gim me a fucking break . 
  oh really ? 
  when did i say that ? 
  culturally yes , we 've got more in common with northern catalonia ( not languedoc ) than andalusia ( and it 's partly beacause of arabic influence that left its mark down there , but that 's fine , i 'm not against it ) but there 's basically no ethinicites in spain apart from maybe the basques and that 's strecthing it . 
  nah , i 'm talking about both . 
  parties in democracy are voted by people who belive what they say . 
  i downvoted you beacause of the * traditional spanish * godwind 's law use . 
  nah , take it as you will , but the fact of the matter is that pp is not that big on refugees and it rules the country . 
  this is undisputable . 
  madrid was ruled by that party until a very short time ago , and to try to make me belive that all of the pp voters dissapeared is just dishonest . 
  oops , what 's that , an argument in favour of independence ? 
  we ca n't have that here in reddit !, 
  nah , this is pretty dishonest . 
  you 're comparing a banner to : a [ not for profit concert ] ( http://estaticos.elperiodico.com/resources/jpg/9/1/fsp9853-1486904903419.jpg ) with our most relevant musicians ( a la we are the wolrd but in catalan ) , a [ big demonstration ] ( http://www.ara.cat/2017/02/18/fotografies/milers-persones-participen-manifestacio-volem_1744635728_38856162_1000x680.jpg ) with a social movement backing it and a decidedly pro-refugee goverment that will probably disobey * statal directives * and take more refugees . 
  oh , so now pp is pro-refugee ? 
  you do n't have to break out the hypebole here mate . 
  a big part is , but remember , a huge minority ( almost half of the city ) of madrid are pp voters , and at least pdc is pro-refugees , which is n't the case with pp. , who , coincidentally , rule the state . 
  the movement is spearheaded in catalonia , not spain though !, 
  the political current in the rest of the state is much more conservative than here . 
  breaking away from the circlejerk of `` refugees are bad '' , mistrust , etc. 
  though to be honest , that discourse never gained any attention here in catalonia . 
  also , happy cake day !, 
  i 'm very proud of this !, 
  i was actually searching for an english article to post it myself , but i see you found one first :p !, 
  i hope we are the spearhead of a new way of thinking in europe , against all the xenophobes and populists that plague the continent !, 
  160k people by the police and 500k by the organizers . 
  low numbers for catalonia , but it is the biggest demonstration in favour of the refugees ever , and it wo n't be in vain !, 
  portugal ? 
  hmmmmm , who knows , who knows ... andorra is a pretty misterious guy up there in the mountains, 
  huh . 
  meer sounds really close to `` mar '' , sea in catalan . 
  like many other words , such as `` rosa '' ( rosa , pink ) or `` lila '' ( lila , purple ) - those two are literally the same word -, 
  please do . 
  we might not have independence , but we must pursue local meme production for the times to come . 
  yup !, 
  wan na visit someday !, 
  though i 'm afraid almost nobody speaks catalan over there anymore , like in northern catalonia ( france ) . 
  there was an algherese singer in the news recently though , [ here she is ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vptrggwwce ) !, 
  [ c'mon , i had fun writing this one and you call it `` nationalist poop '' ? ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5tltlv/the_most_spanish_catalan_of_italian_towns_alghero/ddnk6yv/ ) . 
  not fair * compa\u00f1ero * . 
  kind of yeah, 
  you ca n't be serious . 
  anyway , yeah , i 'm done, 
  no problem , [ it was quite big !, 
  ] ( http://www.xtec.cat/monografics/croniques/imatgescroniques/expansiomedit.gif ) edit itt : spaniards getting offended by the word `` catalanoragonesa '' in a map from the internet, 
  [ historical revisionism eh ? 
  yeah , i 'm done ] ( https://blogdehistoriaderafa.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/habla-espac3b1ol-catalunya-1940.jpg ), 
  nope , it * was * part of spain beacause they annexed the crown of aragon ( so , catalonia ), 
   dunno , are you being massacred in the streets by the people 's liberation army ? 
  we actually were , but that was long ago . 
  as i said before , there 's not really a good comparison , you * yourself * brought tibet up . 
  yeah , it 's pretty dead sadly . 
  even if we even used to have catalan neighbourhoods in rome in the time of the borgia ( valencian popes ) and ruled over southern italy , where we built pretty cool things ( [ like this castle in naples ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/43/32/dc/maschio-angioino-questa.jpg ) ) it was just too long ago to hold on . 
  it 's a miracle that we ourselves exist if we take into accound all of the repression we 've had to suffer even . 
  dunno , we could exert our right to self determination freely and all of that , but hey, 
  true !, 
  tibet for example would be a good example , they 're in nepal too !, 
  also , i 'm gon na ignore the second part of your reply . 
  not really . 
  maybe the scots/celts too , i just thought about them . 
  with a very broad definition of their culture they encompass many states . 
  did n't mean that . 
  german culture has it 's own states , france too , italy too , etc. 
  catalan culture does n't have one , again , we 're stateless,
