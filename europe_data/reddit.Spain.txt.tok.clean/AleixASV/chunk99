  what the fuck did you just fucking say about me , you little bitch ? 
  i 'll have you know i graduated top of my class in the miquelets , and i 've been involved in numerous secret raids on madrit , and i have over 300 papers mullats . 
  i am trained in panellet warfare and i 'm the top sardanista in the entire catalan armed forces . 
  you are nothing to me but just another botifler . 
  i will bore you the fuck out with pointless discussions the likes of which have never been seen before on this earth , mark my fucking words . 
  you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet ? 
  think again , fucker . 
  as we speak i am contacting my secret network of embaixades across the `` entire world '' and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm , maggot . 
  the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call madrit . 
  you 're fucking dead , kid . 
  i can be anywhere , anytime , and i can prepare a crema catalana in over seven hundred ways , and that 's just with my bare hands . 
  not only am i extensively trained in demonstrating , but i have access to the entire arsenal of the assamblea nacional catalana and i will use it to its full extent to complain about how opressed we are . 
  if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little `` clever '' comment was about to bring down upon you , maybe you would have held your fucking tongue . 
  but you could n't , you did n't , and now you 're paying the price , you goddamn idiot . 
  i will demonstrate all over you and you will drown in it . 
  you 're fucking dead , nen . 
  but did you * inhale * shortly afterwards ? 
  wake up sheeple, 
  yeah , but i mean , that is n't in spain . 
  beacause that would be like defining something with that `` something '' in it . 
  it 's hard to describe , beacause i ca n't think of any other example of a stateless-culture that is present in multiple states . 
  i knooooooow you guys are n't on the `` catalan nation '' train , i really did n't mean that . 
  but yeah, 
  yes , catalonia itself is part of spain , but its culture is n't . 
  we 're a stateless nation , but we 're * not just only * part of spain . 
  there 's catalan culture in france and italy ( as you just mentioned ) too . 
  i came across a bit agressive , sorry , it 's just that spain has had a bit of a * history * of claiming basically anything we had . 
  exactly how l'alguer is spanish ? 
  this is some twisted logic right here . 
  for me it was cotlliure , though perpiny\u00e0 is the most iconic `` catalan-french '' town there is , for sure . 
  exactly how ? 
  you 're just salty, 
  yep . 
  [ i 'll upvote yours , beacause well ... 40 % upvoted tells quite the tale ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5tlh86/the_most_catalan_of_french_towns_perpiny%c3%a0/ ), 
  dunno , but i 've got to admit , the french and catalan flags side-by-side look pretty cool . 
  ^ ( mind a little napoleoning ? ), 
  a `` so you 're spanish '' in catalonia would fit the theme pretty well, 
  and obviously rome . 
  calatrava , you sly starchitect !, 
  not really , it 's about not caring what other people do . 
  tolerance and openness is a side effect to that , leftists * push * for these issues , which liberals do n't . 
   liberal daily reminder that this does n't have the same meaning here that it does in the us though !, 
  liberals are n't leftist in the eu, 
  please do, 
  beacause not only americans like crazy shit, 
  nah , not really . 
  merci is a very old barcelon\u00ed thing, 
  i think it 's just an old people 's thing nowadays . 
  in barcelona too , it 's very common . 
  and in barcelona at least people do n't say merc\u00e8s , that 's an old people 's thing , here they say `` merci '' . 
  we do n't sell them , they 're banned !, 
  hahahahaahahah ^ ( checkmate ! ), 
  well , we do n't exist , so at least we 're not * dirrrrty meeexxicans * :p, 
  [ our demonstrations ] ( http://images.scribblelive.com/2015/9/11/da09b051-ec2d-4d66-b023-9c4f5ed5bc02.jpg ) had around 5 times more attendance despite our lower population , but i 'm glad we 're not the only ones doing them . 
  ^ ( see , we can too be patronizing :p ), 
  ehhhhhh not really though , beacause if that were the case we 'd be a republic already , we 've been pulling off 1,5 m demonstrations for 5 consecutive years and a total pop of 7,5 m. 
  of course , i was speaking mainly about c 's and pp , i do n't have anything against spaniards, 
  they desperately want to portray us as close-minded , isolationists , this thread is the example , and yet they fail to realize that * they * themselves are that . 
  i see , so with this france does n't currently have your run of the mill labour party then, 
  they kinda are though , not always , but sometimes . 
  i just asked questions and i got downvoted , i 've got no clue about anything at all , not even reddit apparently !, 
  nope , not at all . 
  but hey , * look , people do n't identify as catalans !, 
  secessionism is dead guys , for sure !, 
   and according to catalans support was 80 % several years ago source me this first , beacause nobody says that . 
  the result of the consultation * as is * does n't mean anything and you know it . 
  you just implied that only those who were in favour of the consultation and its result are catalans , which is hilariously wrong and purposefully obtuse , pretty trolly tbh . 
  oh , so you yourself admitted that non-independentists are n't catalans . 
  welp , the gift that keeps on giving . 
  this entire thread is such a joke ... 
  they 're weird , very weird . 
  we have 6 or 7 parties ( ca n't be bothered to count right now ) and we have both a right-left and a catalanist-spanish axis . 
  well , here in catalonia our main right-wing party has changed its name 3 times in at least the last 6 years . 
  soooo yeah :p !, 
  people just refer to it as `` pdc , or the old converg\u00e8ncia '', 
  does n't that just make ps a pseudo-populist party and em the actual continuist party ? 
  goddamm french politics ... 
  so , what does this mean ? 
  i 've heard he 's the closest thing to pablo iglesias ( kind of like corbyn in the uk ) in france . 
  what are his policies ? 
  thing is , independentism is supported by more people than catalans . 
  this `` catalan = independentist '' line of thought ( promoted by ciudadanos and pp , spanish nationalist parties ) is pretty flawed . 
  that 's beacause she is :p, 
  spain is the second most montainious country in europe , with the `` meseta '' region occupiyng most of the interior . 
  it 's a series of arid badlands with little to no water and so people did n't settle there unless there was a river ( like the manzanares in madrid , which allowed the artificial `` prop-up '' of the existing city into capital-status ) . 
  that 's why pop density in the interior always follows rivers and little else . 
  * if * we win a referendum i think not . 
  it would go against the foundational principles of the eu . 
  that 's why spain is so scared of it . 
  that 's what private meetings are for . 
  they know what this is about , they do n't need to be there . 
  yeah , there 's a list [ here ] ( http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticies/una-concurrencia-insolita-al-parlament-europeu-escolta-puigdemont-junqueras-i-romeva/ ) but it 's in catalan . 
  despite being victim to spanish boyco ... * dialogue * , it went pretty well . 
  no , but sabotage is foul play , and hypocritical when you do n't stop speaking about how much you want to dialogue . 
  good thing it completely failed . 
  well , since i do n't really like speculation , let 's just say that what you 're saying is probably closer to happening if only one of the two parties gets to talk to europe and that party is n't catalonia . 
  since we want to be part of the eu we have to negotiate with them , so this is just that . 
  again , as you said , eu membership is a useful thing in my opinion . 
  if the only info europe gets about us is from the same people that do * that * i find it pretty justified . 
  of course of course !,
