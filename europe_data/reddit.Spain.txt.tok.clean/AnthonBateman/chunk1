well , i would say that it was pretty reminiscent of fc barcelona , specially against bayern last year , and you also had casillas doing a good impersonation of vald\u00e9s , piqu\u00e9 being shit like he has been for a couple of years , and poor xavi getting older by the minute . 
  well , i guess we only have [ mongolia ] ( http://www.bekia.es/images/galeria/40000/40126_portada-revista-mongolia-hija-de-puta-infanta-cristina_m.jpg ) now . 
  not even them would have think of such a great result , pablo iglesias will have to clone himself 4 times . 
  so rajoy and his minions were in the same building as bono , and nobody had the decency to set that place on fire ? 
  we are doomed . 
  i think that you will have a bad time finding spanish catholic redditors , but who knows ... 
  what do you think about dzien swira ? , my polish friends told me about a few movies , and that was the best one by far . 
  [ cronocrimenes ( timecrimes ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480669/ ) , de nacho vigalondo , best low-budget sci-fi movie you will ever see . 
  [ amanece que no es poco ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094641/ ) , the only `` old '' spanish movie that i can watch withouth feeling ashamed . 
  i guess that everyone has seen pan \u00b4 s labyrinth , if you havent , go and watch it !! . 
  also [ rec ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1038988/?ref_=nv_sr_5 ) if you are into zombies and shaky cameras : s, 
  someone call brad pitt , now . 
  in spain most of the tourists come the mediterranean coast , while the north doesnt get as many visitors , one of my favourites places there is [ gulpiyuri ] ( http://img.justthetravel.com/justthetravel-gulpiyuri-beach-spanyol-04.jpg ) , an [ inland beach ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qklurhoqxug/uclfjefssji/aaaaaaabksy/prtc3onms7o/s1600/playa_de_gulpiyuri_010.jpg ) in asturias , the [ lakes of covadonga ] ( http://www.casaruralasturias.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/excursio%cc%81n-por-los-lagos-de-covadonga.jpg ) are pretty awesome too . 
  no [ rory gallagher ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pajsia3_28 ) ? , shame on you !, 
  the hate towards amaral is the only thing capable of holding spain together , ew . . :(, 
  please , let me add some more rock songs : -- [ heroes del silencio - entre dos tierras ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmmj1frrfh4 ) , how is possible that nobody said anything about them !! . 
  -- [ sober - paradysso ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvzuckluc9s ) -- [ estirpe - te seguir\u00e9 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-h4re1azrs ) -- [ saratoga - si amaneciera ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbiqn4-1qv8 ) i kind of hate the song now , but i guess that some guiris might like it . 
  -- [ evohe - 1 +1 infinito ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3bcow2wh5y ) . 
  -- [ desakato - cuando salga el sol ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzl38zhunvu ) . 
  -- [ mam\u00e1 ladilla - sucedi\u00f3 en beckelar ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvw5w4neing ) , the band with the best lyrics in spanish ever !, 
  -- [ toundra - whole album ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyfdvdlgqpg ) . 
  ok , this guys dont sing in spanish , but if you are intro prog/post rock that album is fucking awesome . 
  -- in euskera , my favourites are [ berri txarrak ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bipkmxcu9uw ) . 
  -- and in catalan ( with mallorca acent :d ) [ antonia font ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cft0qsvjf0e ) , that live album is also really good . 
  bonus track : [ ojete calor - cuidado con el cyborg ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmgselba7kw ) . 
  some `` subnopop '' , the spanish nine inch nails , this guys should go the eurovision next year ,, 
  if they do a human-centipede kind of chain , then we would be talking . 
  thats because after they knew that botella and rajoy will give a speech they were already dismantling the facilities , mrs bottle was pretty accurate . 
  and its kind of funny that the `` best one '' today was prince felipe ... 
  madrid history with the olympics its like me trying to get laid every weekend , i have the the facilites , the will and the hope , but it never happens . 
  meh , i am to lazy to link anything , you can take all the karma you greedy catalan . ^ just ^ kidding ... 
  [ people arguing with swords in the middle of the streets . ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xqywgjcfak ) . 
  the urban transport in prague is amazing , so many beautiful cities apart from prague , cesky krumlov , karlovy vary . 
  also the [ strahov monastery library ] ( http://www.beautiful-libraries.com/library%20photos/church%20libraries/6201.jpeg ) . 
  its a smart move by sugusino , you dont want europe to know about things like [ this . 
  ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bn99hx-cuaa1rkn.jpg ) . 
  yes , some dubs are not that bad , in spain all the movies where schwarzenegger is involved are way better with the voice of c.romero , its the only dubbing i tolerate . 
  the most hilarous dubbing i have heard recently is the one of polseres vermelles in spanish , its just too embarrasing . 
  it doesnt have to be mainstream , just folk . 
  not sure if they are famous there , but isnt ayreon dutch , and have some kind of folk vibe in a few songs ? . 
  its not my favourite kind of music , but behold [ verdiales ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx2xwimz56s ) , the unknown arch-enemy of flamenco in southern spain . 
  about czerwone korale , there is a [ curious version ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t942uzj3eie ) played by a [ tuna ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tuna_%28music%29 ) , its kind of bizarre but it doesnt sound so bad after all . 
  1:20 somebody please think of the [ boars ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/the-boar-war-barcelona-aims-to-control-its-wildlife-2211242.html ) :(, 
  its good to know that you have no decent reason for it , 
  im not sure if being a flanders is a good thing , but thanks anyway !, 
  ups , you are right , dont know why i was thinking about isabel . 
  why you dont know if it makes sense then ? . 
  edit : peces barba was the one who said that . 
  it makes sense , isabel could have get married with [ alfonso v ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afonso_v_of_portugal ) from portugal , with the brother of louis xi or with our beloved ferran . 
  at that time the structure and the administration of portugal was more similar to castilla than the kingdom of aragon , and the father of isabel wanted to marry her with the portuguese guy , but you know , love ... 
  its not that we dont care , but we should care more . 
  i always had the feeling that the portuguese care more about the spaniards than the spaniards about the portuguese , i kind of feel bad about it , but maybe its natural since we are your only neighbours ( for the good things and the bad things ) . 
  when an object enter into a hollow cylinder that is not much bigger that the object itself , the air has to go out by the other side of the cylinder with the same violence/speed of the incoming object ( aroun 300km/h ) . 
  but i think that the formula its more complicated , and its related with [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/darcy%e2%80%93weisbach_equation ) , the wave its moving even faster than the train . 
  plus the shape of the tunnel is really weird , it should be like an oval , not square , to prevent this kind of soundwaves . 
  steamy worded letters are eta . 
  the retirement home of europe . 
  your grandmother grew up in the czech republic , your parents are catalans and you live in england , cant you guys just stay in one place ?? . 
  jokes aside , i felt the same way in prague , i would love to say that i was always alert in the bus or the metro , willing to learn new words in czech , but the truth is , i couldnt , everytime i used the public transport i just switched off my mind . 
  the funny thing is that when i came back to spain , and i understood what everyone around me was saying , i felt like the people in the movies/series who can hear what everyone is thinking : s, 
  first time i took a train inside poland , if you dont get on the train in the first stations , you just have to sit in the floor of the corridor with your luggage for hours , everytime someone needed to go to the bathroom it was hell . 
  the same thing happened on a bus from warsaw to krakow . 
  in budapest , not much of a cultural shock , but it surprised me a lot that the people looked so welcoming and `` latin '' in some ways . 
  in the czech republic , taking my shoes off everytime i went inside a house ( it is a nice idea , but i have never done that in spain ) . 
  and potatoes in every meal , potatoes and dumplings . 
  festival internacional de benicassim [ ( fib ) ] ( http://fiberfib.com/index.php/en/programacion/cartel ) in spain , from 18 to 21 of july : - primal scream . 
  - arctic monkeys . 
  - kaiser chiefs . 
  - the killers . 
  - black rebel motorcycle club . 
  - and the motherfu **** queens of the stone age . 
   conservative education reform : catolich religion mandatory subject for schools ( voluntary for students ) , philosophy and technology are non-mandatory now . 
  well , you need to study religion if you want to [ become an exorcist . 
  ] ( http://freethinker.co.uk/2013/05/24/29393/ ), 
  go to prague , its not expensive at all , really beautiful , and you are in the middle of europe , so you can travel to germany , poland or austria pretty easily if you want . 
  the prague-vienna-budapest triangle its an european must-see in my opinion . 
  the one before the third spanish republic . 
  so some assholes pulled a a sign for a few minutes in a football stadium , then a few others ( 40 ? ), 
  pulled another sign in another stadium , big news . 
  [ i guess this should be on the front page too ] ( http://www.sportcartagena.es/fotografias/fotosnoticias/2012/12/23/gal-133843.jpg ), 
  word of advice , the train between prague and krakow cost around 50 euros , but if you take a train from prague to cesky tesin , cross the town walking until the polish part and take a bus there to krakow , you will save 20-25 euros . 
  i fully agree , both cities and gorgeous . 
  hahah , he looks so happy , must be really hard to negotiate with putin . 
  our president hates pens , instead of keep it to himself , he just [ throw it away ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydglk-mcudo ) , it seems that merkel makes him nervous, 
  at least he didnt steal any pen . 
  the usual pseudoscience stuff , enhance athletic ability , better balance , increased stamina . 
  the company that makes them its called phiten . 
  sorry , titanium disc , its a false friend with spanish . 
  it brings division because some people think that in the moment spain will become a republic , a bunch of communists with torches will go their houses looking for babies to eat . 
  we can perfectly have a republic with aznar as a president ... about the flag , well , making a new one out of the blue seems kind of difficult to me , it will happen the same that when they tried to put lyrics to the national anthem . 
  [ this flag ] ( http://www.frikipedia.es/images/archive/2/2c/20090228021900!banderarara.gif ) should make everyone happy , 
  i said most spanish redditors , not all , nothing wrong with that . 
  the dark period was the civil war , not the proclamation of a democratic republic . 
  of course there was some problems ( uprisings , strikes etc ) but all europe was a mess at that time , the republic established freedom of speech , extended suffrage to women , allowed divorce , stripped the spanish nobility special legal status and control over the church , what is dark its what came after that . 
  in every piece of news about the spanish royal family there are always many of us explaining the situation . 
  the `` last thing '' is that the indicted princess doesnt have to answer questions about the business activities of the non-profit n\u00f3os institute . 
  i personally , find it shameful , but on the bright side , this can only make people even angrier with the monarchy . 
  about spain \u00b4 s royal family losing the crown , its not happening anytime soon , we will have another king more for sure , but in the future i can perfectly see a republic happening , most of the young people dont want a monarchy , and when the older generations pass away ( the ones with political power ) , who is going to defend the monarchy ? . 
  most of the spanish redditors would wear a republican flair over the current one . 
  about the king , i like to compare him with a `` one hit wonder '' band , who had a good song in 1981 , and have been doing nothing since then .
