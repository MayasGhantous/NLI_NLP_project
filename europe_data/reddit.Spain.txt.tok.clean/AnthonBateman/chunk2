  before anyone defends principe felipe , some pictures of the next king wearing a [ power balance ] ( http://mujer.orange.es/upimages/2310/ppe_felipe_pb_d52bf9f6ccb41a2d15491cebc.jpg ) and a [ titanium disc ] ( http://blogs.elcorreo.com/magonia/files/principeparchemagico.jpg ) . 
  no , cesky tesin must remain half polish-half czech . 
  in that way is cheaper to go from moravia-slovakia to krakow . 
  even better , divide the czech republic into bohemia and moravia , then reunite the last one with slovakia and leave bohemia alone , just for the lulz . 
  i dont see whats stupid about it , its just a joke . 
  if you cant even understand when something its a joke and when something its an `` attack to catalunya '' ... 
  agree about everything you say , specially with l \u00b4 auberge espagnole , good and funny movie , but people have to be warned , spanish milfs are not usually like that . 
  if you are interested in knowing lots of people doing erasmus , i am not sure if tartu or reykjavik will be the best place , since i think they are not `` popular erasmus destinations '' , but i could be wrong , utrecht must be nice . 
  if you enjoy snow , not much sun , excepcional food and friendly people , the north of spain fits perfectly , the only `` downside '' is that you will have to learn some spanish . 
  poland , germany , france and nordic countries also fit . 
  about the partying/relaxing thing , i think it doesnt depends so much in the country , in every place there will be erasmus willing to go out and partying almost every night , and erasmus more relaxed and interested in other things , its just a matter of find your `` kind of people '' soon enough . 
  i think if you tell us what kind of hobbies/weather / kind of city do you prefer , it will be easier to help you . 
  having said that , if you ask for other experiences : last year i went to prague , i always had a thing for central europe , and it was a perfect destination for me anyway , the city is stunningly beautiful , its not expensive , and its in the middle of europe , so you can travel easily to germany , poland , austria , hungary , even slovenia and croatia are not that far away . 
  the czech people are pretty cool , specially the young ones , the older generations are not so welcoming to foreigners . 
  the waiters deserve another chapter , czech waiters are the most rude i have ever met . 
  at first it was kind of hard , because i didnt know anyone from there , and i went by myself ( its different if you already go with some friends from your city/university ) , but after a couple of days , when you start meeting other erasmus or locals , and being aware of your sorroundings everything will be fine . 
  i have met some erasmus in my city , and i found very curious that most of them live in flats near the oldtown , and barely a few of them live in the univeristy residence , because in prague most of us lived in the residence , which i think its great , in that way you have a lot more of contact with people from other countries , and is easier to make friends . 
  i dont know what else to say , if you want me to be more specific , just ask , and dont worry , going erasmus is the best thing you can do , it will be the best year in your life for sure . 
  hahah , i have never been there , but it cant be worse than andalucia or catalu\u00f1a for sure , maybe its because in valencia they have the `` nanos '' competing with them . 
  no , he represents another stereotype , the `` old , ignorant pseudo-fascist person who miss franco '' . 
  its interesting to compare the map about [ unemployment ] ( http://i.imgur.com/opt7u27.png ) with the [ cani density ] ( http://www.frikipedia.es/images/0/08/espa%c3%b1acani.jpg ) . 
  i am not sure if / r/mapporn will appreciate the second one , but its pretty spot on . 
  hahaha , thats hilarous , but i find particularly hard to understand him , they speak some slang or accent , or my portuguese is rustier than i thought ? 
  your gunas are pretty similar to our [ canis ] ( http://www.frikipedia.es/friki/cani ) . 
  well , i guess you dont leech half of europe for 300 years without evolving . 
  it is a nice video , and i guess that in / r/spain will be more apreciated . 
  whenever i have to introduce someone to discworld i lend them `` guards !, 
  guards !, 
  '' , the city watch usually have the best storylines of discworld . 
  the witcher is awesome , i didnt like so much the end of the story , but an amazing saga anyway . 
  about the movie , i think that [ mads mikkelsen ] ( https://www.google.es/search?hl=en&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=635&amp;q=mad+mikkelsen&amp;oq=mad+mikk&amp;gs_l=img.3.0.0l2j0i24l3.2026.4024.0.5334.11.10.1.0.0.0.120.908.8j2.10.0...0.0...1ac.1.9.img.whcudwsfvfm ) would be perfect as geralt , he is an amazing actor , and was pretty badass in valhalla rising . 
  haha , just pointed that he is not spanish because i knew that writing about him here , maybe some portuguese will feel offended or something , not my intention at all , 
  if you let me , i would say 3 : * [ salamina ] ( http://www.planetadelibros.com/foreign-rights-salamina-book-2712.html ) , by javier negrete , a famous writer of fantasy and historical novels , this one is about themistocles and includes the main battles in the greco-persian wars . 
  many people say that [ gates of fire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gates_of_fire ) by s.pressfield is one of the best books about this age , well , in my opinion negrete \u00b4 s book is even better . 
  * `` the damned legions '' , by santiago posteguillo , about [ scipio africanus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scipio_africanus ) , the roman general who defeated hannibal , the second book of a trilogy that covers all the punic wars from the point of view of both generals . 
  * this is kind of a bonus , because he is not spanish ( eventhough he spent his last 15 years in spain ) but jose saramago \u00b4 s [ blindness ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2526.blindness ) , terrific book . 
  wonder how many english people will go to take a dump in that street . 
   citing factors such as its young population mmm ... i dont think we have so much `` young population '' , and even worse , most of the young people who are dynamic and have a good education are leaving to other countries . 
  man , those lithuanians playing basketball are scary . 
  for sure a czech redditor will have more info than me , but i spent one year in prague , and most of my czech friends cared more about ice hockey than soccer . 
  edit : [ map posted not long ago about most popular sports ] ( http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/webdr01/2013/2/21/16/enhanced-buzz-wide-24634-1361482645-8.jpg ), 
  galicia you are so clumsy , stop falling down the stairs . 
  i am aware of the problems in spain , just thought that it was funny that precisely salvaxe pointed that out . 
  also , the strong links between spain and latin america , and being so close to africa , doesnt help . 
   the fight against crime , drug trafficking and money-laundering over the past five years has reduced the country 's `` attractiveness '' as an entry point , the report stated . 
  i would say way more than five years . 
  thats funny coming from someone from gibraltar . 
  being optimistic , i dont think we will have a monarchy in 50-years , thats what i hope , but you never know . 
  anyway , monarchy wont end with juan carlos , felipe will be the next king for sure , but i dont know for how many years . 
  most of the young people in spain dont give a crap ( if they are not openly against ) about monarchy and catholicism , or even bullfighting . 
  many things will change in spain when the `` old elite '' , people who were born and raised during the dictatorship , pass away . 
  thats what i think and what i hope for . 
  tomorrow in some newspapers `` indicted the wife of the son-in-law of the king '' . 
  it seems that el pa\u00eds knew about this 10 years ago , but they did nothing . 
  of course many people like him , many other see him as a cooperator of the military dictatorship who tortured and killed thousands of people in argentina .

  he should look through the windows more often , [ this ] ( https://twitter.com/lhermoso_/status/312893409838903296/photo/1 ) picture was taken yesterday . 
  if we had an amazing and clever prince , maybe ... i could agree with you , abdication wouldnt look so wrong , but the fact that the prince of asturias believes and use power balances and titanium patches makes him an complete idiot ( in my humble opinion , of course ) . 
  i would like that spain was a republic , its not only that in my opinion the monarchy its an obsolete thing , its that if in a republic the family of the head of the state steals money and influence peddling , you just kick them out and the people choose another . 
  the king is like those `` one hit wonder '' groups , who had a decent song in 1981 and are still living of that . 
  [ another one ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bcigqdfcmaahkwx.jpg:large ), 
  they were just showing to the press their new plasma , its a spanish tradition . 
  when you are so beautiful and sensata you dont need to spell names properly . 
  despite rajoy and that clown of eduardo inda talking everyday on the tv , junts pel s\u00ed couldn \u00b4 t get more than the 50 % . 
  the beauty of ines arrimadas is the only thing that holds spain together  . 
  in catalonia , any `` conservative `` person with some common sense in his head would vote for ciu ( doesnt exist anymore ) or ciudadans . 
  gasol has always said that he feels very spaniard and many catalan independentists hate him , so he would find a way to keep playing with spain for sure . 
  i just read somewhere that some people are thinking of spraying cruzcampo over isis forces to teach them a lesson . 
  such a bad day to be epileptic . 
  so do you guys are actually watching it with sound ?? 
  ! , really ? 
  you could have done that before franco and rajoy . 
  be careful or you might drown in your own bile . 
  btw feliz navidad ! , hope you get well soon . 
  cool , now all their new units will receive two experience points and will increase the chance to generate a great spy . 
  actually , the rumours are the she is dating a guy from ciu ( conservative catalanism ) . 
  no thanks , manolo lama pronounces like sex so it must be like sex , i dont trust in redditors . 
  you mean that it doesnt sound like sex ? 
  i still dont know if they can be considered a serious band or not , because they define themselves as retard-pop but [ ojete calor ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmgselba7kw ) must be in this thread . 
  you could expect more sensitivity from robocop \u00b4 s cock than from most of the pp members . 
  in yesterday \u00b4 s election or in the generales/europeas ? , i dont know if you understood me but i was talking of people in andalucia , they couldnt vote yesterday because they are not catalans , but the your question of `` how can you be pro-referendum and at the same time pro-unionist ? '', 
  i tell you that there are more normal people thant you think of , maybe not a majority but many . 
  i am from andalucia and i know a lot of people who wouldnt mind at all a referendum in catalonia but would like them to stay . 
  are you really from spain ? , because if you are then you must be like 12 years old or something , there are lots of people who are pro-referendum and pro-unionist , not everyone in spain is a journalist from 13tv . 
  there are more registered companies ( insurance firms , gambling companies etc ) in gibraltar than people living in there . 
  in the last years is seems that they have made an effort to clean their image as a tax haven and all that but they still has no sales tax , no capital gains tax -- and no inheritance , wealth or estate taxes . 
  there are tons of articles on the interwebs about it . 
  i guess you dont have an english rock in the middle of the beautiful golfo de vizcaya that is a tax-haven where the 10 % of all the oil tankers in the world are waiting in line to refuel and where also sporadically the english repair some harmless nuclear-submarine ... edit : i dont even care that much about gibraltar ( as most of the spanish people ) , but i am sure that you wont be making that question if the english would have invaded a part of the basque country during the war of the spanish succession . 
  they had like 3 votes on the last general elections , so all the publicity they can get is good . 
  i just want great britain to win , so not only they leave europe , but also have to pay for the festival the next year . 
  are you telling me that catalannewsagency and the [ institut nova historia ] ( https://www.inh.cat/ ) where is said that colon , cervantes , leonarde da vinci and the usa flag are catalan are not reliable ? 
  i dont think so https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb1lp69c3za, 
  they have their own language , as people from valencia , baleares , the basque country , galicia or asturias , some could argue that even in murcia people have their own language . 
  are the people from those places also very different from the rest of the spanish ? . 
  excuse me , but it pisses me off a little bit when people say things like that , because spain is a melting pot of different regions , each one of them with their own language ( or very different accent ) , gastronomy , folklore etc. 
  catalans are different ? , different from who ? , i would say that there are more similarities in the lifestile between andalucia and catalunya than between andalucia and madrid , in cantabria or asturias the people are also different from the rest , each part of spain has its own identity , there is no clear `` spanish identity '' , there is no catalonian vs the rest of spain identity . 
  really , are they very different ? , in which way ?
