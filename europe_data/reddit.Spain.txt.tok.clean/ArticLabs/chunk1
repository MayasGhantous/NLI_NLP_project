good old `` troll , shill or moron '' game , my favourite .

  the rae normally does a great work but that word is an monstrous aberration , it should be put down as an act of compassion . 
  something different but as ours as it can be : book : [ lazarillo de tormes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/picaresque_novel#lazarillo_de_tormes_and_its_sources ) tv show : [ farmacia de guardia ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098794/ ) , no idea if it can be find in english , but what the heck , it 's a decent reference of spain during the 90 's .

   they were just being assholes , but they really do n't understand us for the most part . 
  both are correct , it is difficult but most do n't even try . 
  it 's unfortunate but we have a poor image of portugal and it 's completely ignored by the news , just ask any spaniard not living near the border who is your president . 
  should n't be that way , we 're as closely related as two countries can be , feels like turning your back to a brother . 
   without onion [ who said that ? 
  i was n't trying to refute your post , just adding some info . 
  after all , all ports and airports are potential military targets . 
  [ rota ] ( http://www.cnic.navy.mil/regions/cnreurafswa/installations/ns_rota.html ) is the main military port , barcelona is way down the list of priority targets . 
  afaik the port is used mainly for recreational leaves . 
  they called themselves `` los peones negros '' [ the black pawns ] and cranked the crazy dial to 12 .

  agreed , locals from both sides have good reasons to be tired of the games of both governments . 
  it was important when artillery was primitive thanks to the natural fortification of the rocky mountain , but this days it 's irrelevant . 
  `` controlling '' the mediterranean mouth can be done from ceuta or tarifa too , or thanks to the range of modern weapons and radars , from everywhere . 
  gibraltar is a smokescreen , we do n't care , just ignore the government trolling like we do .

  dude , the torture is common before bullfighting , it 's done to enrage the bull and one of the main reason to ban it . 
  no , they 're not happy to run , sure , so what ? 
  tail pulling and slapping ? 
  fucking dangerous , you 'll get arrested and fined for putting people in danger . 
  a bull can reach speeds of 60km/h and weights between 300 and 500kg , since the sanfermines run never ends with hundreds of trampled bodies , maybe those bulls have not been tortured and are more scared than angry . 
  incidentally , that 's why touching or distracting the bulls is dangerous , if one of them gets separated from the pack it becomes much more aggressive , they feel safe in packs . 
   running of the bulls bulls are not killed or mistreated . 
   plenty of spaniards who would do this shit as well .

  it 's been so long since i got mine i 'm not really sure i could pass it tomorrow again , and everyone tells me that i driver very well . 
  we adopt bad habits and tell ourselves it 's the correct way , a test every 5 years will help to correct a lot of problems . 
  about the driving is a right or privilege debate , there 're people who really need cars for a variety of reasons , like living in the middle of nowhere . 
  but i think that a middle ground could be reached by punishing offenders with speed/power limiters , gps monitoring or pedal powered go-karts . 
  do you mean the people who went to school together , to university with , that go to the same clubs and trips ? 
  no way , that 's crazy and illegal , like corruption . 
   he 's talking shit , our active population is increasing constantly i wish , [ it has dropped like a rock in the last two years ] ( http://www.ine.es/prensa/epa_tabla.htm ) it always rises in the second quarter just to drop in the third . 
  last year it was +.17 % and -10 % , this year is +.34 % , let 's hope we keep half of that , we fell in a bad trend . 
   he just does n't look at the dates no , i look at the methodology , the one i posted is from the * ministerio de trabajo y seguridad social * , it 's hard statistical data . 
  if you look at the one you posted , in the methodology section it says  la encuesta de poblaci\u00f3n activa ( epa ) es una investigaci\u00f3n por muestreo and while [ it 's very precise ] ( http://www.ine.es/daco/daco42/daco4211/epa0115.pdf ) , i do n't like it , so i do n't use it . 
  work related accidental deaths tend to skew those statistics , pretty much all are men , i thinks its 20 to 1 . 
  edit to add a source : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/accidents_at_work_statistics  men are considerably more likely than women to have a non-fatal accident or to die at work . 
  in the eu-28 , almost four out of every five ( 78.5 % ) non-fatal accidents at work and 19 out of every 20 ( 95.6 % ) fatal accidents at work involved men . 
  lol , worst spammer ever . 
  i know they do n't have any other chance , and it 's even worst , most of the people leaving are young and with a degree , and statistically most of them wo n't come back . 
  also , you forget the people that is not looking for work , working illegally , or retirees , those areas are still growing . 
  anyway , the main problem is that governments tend to completely ignore those numbers because it makes unemployment rates look better but the baseline expenses keep increasing while the revenue drops . 
  so yeah , we should be worried about that number too , but it 's being actively ignored . 
  in spain it 's people actually working or looking for work . 
  definition change from country to country , thought , you 're right for most afaik . 
  [ active population is still going down ] ( http://www.empleo.gob.es/es/estadisticas/resumenweb/rud.pdf ) , thought , and that 's what we should be worried about imho . 
  i found some stuff , i 'll probably add even more things to the post , check in an hour . 
  i like learning this kind of useless titbits  edit : this days is called `` fontilles '' , search google images for that word if you want to see photos .

  in spain lepers were sent to [ lazarettos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lazaretto ) which in spain doubled as isolated hospitals for infectious patients or sent to leproserias , specialized leper hospitals/colonies like the sanatorio san francisco de borja [ * spanish wikipedia * ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/sanatorio_san_francisco_de_borja ) / [ * google translation * ] ( https://translate.google.es/translate?act=url&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf8&amp;prev=_t&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/sanatorio_san_francisco_de_borja&amp;sandbox=0&amp;usg=alkjrhgnjc1sqlm0lg-9f63llac71mhnea ) which while isolated were decent places to live , apparently . 
  edit to add some more info : *** leprosy in spain *** , * by felix contreras duenas * , medical director of the san francisco de borja sanatorium-colony in english * [ pdf version ] ( http://ila.ilsl.br/pdfs/v15n2a07.pdf ) and [ pastebin version ] ( http://pastebin.com/ruc4qwzi ) * , it 's short but interesting , contains a list of leproserias starting from the 9th century . 
  [ a homemade video of the sanatorio ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6rwwujbwqu ) [ leper in the philiphines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/culion_leper_colony ) , back when it was spain 's colony . 
   the first known origin of leprosy in the philippines dates back to time of the first spanish exploration of the philippines . 
  in the sixteenth century , franciscan friars established a shelter for the care of those afflicted with leprosy close to their monastery in manila , where the hospital san juan de dios is located . 
  [ 3 ] in 1632 the emperor of japan , knowing that the spanish catholic church had an interest in caring for those afflicted with disease , sent one hundred and thirty four japanese known sufferers of leprosy by ship to manila . 
  the spanish franciscans , initially reluctant to accept the shipment from the emperor , eventually took in the japanese patients and housed them in the hospital of san lazaro in manila . 
  [ 4 ] however , the emperor 's shipment of japanese citizens infected with leprosy is not attributed as the main source of leprosy in the colonies , as the philippines is known to have had commerce with other asian countries known to have been afflicted with the leprosy . 
  [ 5 ]  by 1830 , approximately four hundred lepers were patients in leper colonies established by catholic priests at manila , cebu and nueva caceras . 
  [ 3 ] those afflicted with leprosy were segregated from the rest of the population but still allowed to have contact with family , inhabitants and other members of the island . 
  [ 6 ] the purpose of the hospitals and leprosy establishments on the islands at that time was n't to eradicate the disease or segregate it from the rest of the population but instead to provide humanitarian aid . 
  [ 5 ] the hospital of san lazaro in manila was run by franciscan friars until september 1898 , when it was turned over to the american authorities . 
  [ 7 ] the other islands , cebu , palestina , and nueva c\u00e1ceres were ordered abandoned by general leonard wood .

  in that particular area your friend is dead wrong , we 're far worst than most 3rd world countries .
