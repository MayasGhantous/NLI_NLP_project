would you rather be homosexual person living in poland or egypt ? 
  do they have any exception ? 
  did you even open the link you posted ? 
  because you 've only added evidence to his point . 
  in pretty sure franco loved us * maleantes * . 
   * [ for a generation of spaniards this prison was a symbol of punishment and social exclusion towards those who decided to exercise their freedom and live in their different affective orientation . 
  may this plaque stay as a democractic society 's repair for a historic injustice , in remembrance of the homosexuals that where jailed and as promise that no other generation will ever have to live through something like that .

  why use literally the worst example of christian influence ? 
  we do n't have go to chechnya either . 
  let 's use some better ones instead , i can freely walk around my small sized city holding hands with my husband knowing that the probability of anything of note happening to us is virtually zero . 
  is this the situation in any predominantly muslim country ? 
  can i give my husband a goodbye hug and kiss at the oh so modern dubai airport ? 
  what about lebanon ? 
  egypt , maybe ? 
   the rest of us : `` many religions are hostile to homosexuals ''  you : `` no guys its just islam '' except that 's a cheap strawman , absolutely no one is saying that the catholic church has been a great force for freedom through history , they 're saying it pales in comparison to the current atrocities of islam . 
  there 's pretty fucking big difference between priests giving you a weird look or conservative people voting against your interests in a democratic process and getting thrown out of a building , it 's not even remotely the same . 
  yes , vastly better . 
  many of the most accepting countries in the world are indeed culturally catholic , and even if you want to look at it from the `` those are not real catholics '' angle i 'm pretty sure that the catholic church is not building concentration camps at the vatican , quite the opposite lately . 
   `` spain is losing a distinguished figure from its modern political scene . 
  and spanish women are losing someone who always took a stand to emphasise the importance of women 's roles in modern society , and among the college 's faculty and students . '', 
  the role of being completely unqualified for your work and end up as the worst defense minister in our history ? 
  i could think of vastly better role models for my hypothetical daughter , `` expect your vagina to open the doors of some random ministry in a cabinet of token women '' is not exactly the kind of life advice i 'd give her . 
  and what are the interests of * most of the citizens * supposed to be according to you ? 
  are most of the citizens interested in taking a hit to their personal wealth by disproportionally financing other people 's communications on their bills ? 
  are they also interested in having less foreign capital entering the country through those companies and thus less taxes being paid to the spanish state ( you know , the one that pays for all our public stuff ) ? 
   then i wonder how many spanish citizens can afford to be tourists . 
  the vast majority . 
  an average family living on two median wages ( 30 ~ 35k $ ) can easily afford a pretty decent vacation every single year . 
   yeah not getting a lot of sympathy from me out of this one . 
  this is ** not ** how ~ ~ the world ~ ~ mixed-market economies work . 
  they could n't care less about your sympathy , in this particular case they 'll just have your money instead . 
  it 's almost as if the spanish goverment was supposed to defend all spanish interests , including the corporate ones !, 
  absolute madmen , truly shameful stuff , this would never happen in * country_that_i_like * . 
  there 's a lot more to `` outside of spain '' than `` sweden '' . 
  overall we 're on a pretty decent situation , specially when compared to a decade ago , the 300/350mb pipes are widely available now and the gigabit efforts are already well underway . 
  sounds like evidence-less bollocks . 
  all kinds of companies have indeed been rising their r&d budgets for years now . 
  try to keep up . 
  how the fuck do you even manage to live in a country for 25 years and not to speak the language perfectly ? 
  i mean , that sounds really impressive ... did he turn his brain off for 12 hours/day or something ? 
  but the angsty left told us that there was a horde of spaniards ~ ~ deciding to move abroad ~ ~ being ** forcefully exiled ** . 
  i ca n't believe they lied to us, 
  low energy bait . 
  oh look , feminist arpies trying to pretend this could somehow be a bad thing . 
  how refreshing . 
   if i remember correctly , the archbishop of one of andalusia 's bishoprics a couple of years ago remarked that women choosing to get abortion deserve to die . 
  oh wow , a couple of years ago some religious nutjob said something !, 
  ** oh my god somebody please help poor spanish women !, 
  in the ** exact ** same way paying a man more for being a man would do . 
  let 's pay all men 20 $ more every year , or whatever the cost of those entries is , surely nobody would mind ? 
  it harms equality , the thing that feminism was supposedly about . 
  is this some kind of thinly veiled theft apologism or ... 
  * oh my , how racist of you , i 'm literally shaking right now . 
  * of course they are . 
   or the cava , to be more accurate estrella galicia you mean ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  mark rutte is the handsome liberal dude , right ? 
  sounds good , i guess . 
  yep , i feel like i 'm surrounded by nothing but dumb right now . 
  surely you would n't want to make sweeping , evidenceless generalizations about pedophilia within a group , right ? 
  i mean , that has been used before , maybe you forgot already ... or maybe there are no bad tactics , just bad targets , 
   they ban violent speech and where is the violence here ? 
  and what would those reactions be exactly ? 
   you can be whatever the fuck you want to be . 
  i want to be an attack helicopter . 
  speech is either free or it is n't , `` kinda free speech '' is not free speech . 
  i can understand people enjoying the idea government-regulated speech , but at least have a bit of decency and openly admit it instead of pretending to be a paragon of liberty . 
  good thing the bus did n't say `` transgender kids must be murdered and eradicated from earth '' then . 
  yeah , the bus was runnning over transgender kids right as the police got to them . 
  great analogy . 
  yep , they got first page on every single newspaper for the small price of renting a bus and putting a sticker on it . 
  this should be taught in business schools . 
   their suicide rate is higher before surgery than after i 'd love to see some of that data on that . 
  i knew about [ this ] ( http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885 ) study , but it clearly states that :  for the purpose of evaluating the safety of sex reassignment in terms of morbidity and mortality , however , it is reasonable to compare sex reassigned persons with matched population controls . 
  the caveat with this design is that transsexual persons before sex reassignment might differ from healthy controls ( although this bias can be statistically corrected for by adjusting for baseline differences ) . 
  it is therefore important to note that the current study is only informative with respect to transsexuals persons health after sex reassignment ; ** no inferences can be drawn as to the effectiveness of sex reassignment as a treatment for transsexualism ** . 
  in other words , the results should not be interpreted such as sex reassignment per se increases morbidity and mortality . 
  things might have been even worse without sex reassignment . 
  as an analogy , similar studies have found increased somatic morbidity , suicide rate , and overall mortality for patients treated for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia . 
  [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] this is important information , but it does not follow that mood stabilizing treatment or antipsychotic treatment is the culprit . 
  well that 's certainly not the case in spain , in fact , there 's a similar campaign going on spraying the opposite message all over bus stops right now . 
   that bus ' sole purpose is the brainwashing of children . 
  it does n't aim for any other demographic , only children . 
  this is incredibly dangerous since childhood is the stage of one 's life when principles and values root the deepest . 
  surely those children have parents , a family , educators and possibly medical specialists to show them otherwise . 
  but no , let 's delegate education to the public at large , what could possibly go wrong ...  still could n't avoid feeling a slight sensation of disgust when a gay couple showed affection in public this is very interesting to me . 
  i 'm not ashamed to say that i find seeing heterosexual couples show affection pretty icky , and i suspect this is a biological thing since even though i 'm homosexual i obviously grew up surrounded by mostly heterosexual relationships . 
  i really do n't think we are special , but in increasingly more pc world i guess we 'll never actually know . 
  and what 's the difference exactly ? 
  if the bus had a tv showing that interview should it be illegal ? 
  what if i write it down in piece of paper and stick it to my t-shirt ? 
  what about writing it with a sharpie on my private car ? 
  it is about the size ? 
  the color ? 
  i really do n't understand what the difference is supposed to be , this is banning the expression of an idea not some particular way to do it . 
   because in this case the message is approved by the government ftfy, 
   that 's not punished and nobody wants to punish for that the fuck ? 
  that 's exactly what 's happening here . 
  you 're stating that his philosophical stance is indeed a lie , why would n't that be considered harm ? 
  let 's keep going down the slope .
