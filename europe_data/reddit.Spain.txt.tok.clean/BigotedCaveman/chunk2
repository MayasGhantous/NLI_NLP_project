   you are a kid dealing with the constant harassment derived of being transexual , and an organization pays for a ads to convince citizens that your very identity is a lie and/or mental illness . 
  thinking that someone is a liar or has a mental illness is not an excuse for harrasment in the first place , people being bullies is what causing that loss of freedom and that 's unequivocally illegal already . 
  this is regulating thought and persecuting people for expression , but we do have a history of doing so , do n't we ? 
   ca n't you see how that can be cause psychological harm and counters the childrens ' right to dignity and personal development ? 
  indirectily it could , that 's why it 's important that counterarguments exist and those are coming from the medical community , who has a hell of a lot more pull than some catholic freaks that virtually nobody cares about . 
  bearing with some stupidity written on a bus is well worth the massive loss of freedom that comes from `` your freedoms affect my feelings '' slippery slope becoming a supposedly rational stance , all those kids will deal with vastly harder stuff on a daily basis just like everyone does . 
  you 're arguing semantics though , how we call it does n't really matter and it 's probably best if we leave that to medical professionals , in the end the objective should be letting those people be happy however they are / want to be . 
  unless you do n't believe in a free society , that is . 
  ahh yes , tell me about all these freedoms that people lose because someone put a sticker on a bus . 
  i 'm literally shaking right now . 
   hate speech ahh yes , the good old blasphemy laws . 
  some things never change . 
  oh i do have a boring java job that i 'm fairly happy with , that 's why i said `` hypothetically '' :p but considering that i 'm single and have nothing but liquid assets to my name now it 's probably the time to do * crazy stuff * like leaving everything and go work abroad before settling in somewhere . 
  hypothetically , what would the chances in the it market be for a software dev with only a couple of years of experience and no danish skills whatsoever ? 
  is infojobs * the place * to look for opportunities or do most companies use a danish site ? 
  lmao look at them all nice and quiet once the police comes into the train . 
   programming something like rsa from scratch is easy not sure if ignorance or humongous humblebrag ... 
   europe seems to agree math does n't care about whatever nonsense * europe * thinks . 
  not any different from being prosecuted for `` hate speech '' , which happens all across europe . 
  it 's governments regulating thought / speech , absolutely nothing new . 
  i do n't understand why are you being downvoted . 
  there is nothing even remotely close to freedom of speech anywhere in europe . 
  i would , he 's a hottie . 
   as much an illegal flag both are perfectly legal . 
  we were talking about vigilante justice , that is illegal . 
  stating facts is not . 
  no , showing the face of person x who unequivocally did y saying `` person x did y '' is not illegal , just journalism . 
  it 's just facts and truth , what journalism is ( or at least was ) supposed to be about . 
  that 's also illegal and punished in spain . 
  it will also put your face in the newspapers . 
  why not ? 
  pretty much every single one ? 
   show that you give a damn about your customer . 
  no , they only show that your creepy boss told you to keep a stupid smile on your face . 
  what ? 
  his facts are hurting your feelings or ... 
  autonomous machines that can kill anyone that crosses some spatial lines that you program them with in different ways are not really science fiction anymore , it 's not something that can be * mass * produced right now , but it will be . 
  yeah mate , that 's what electric currents do to the human body . 
  you either ca n't feel them or they kill you outright , there 's no middle ground that we could use to deter climbing . 
   morocco has a highly liberal government for an arab state . 
  yeah sure . 
  they also happen to like money . 
  you sure showed him with all those buzzwords . 
  https://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/gender-society/same-sex-marriage-children-well-being-research-roundup that 's literally the first google result when querying `` impact gay parents '' ... those are american studies , you could instead go past the first result and look for european ones , but i do n't think it 's really necessary considering that the cultural enviroment is pretty similar . 
  in fact , if you looked at the biggest and more up to date study at the moment ( [ which is sadly behind a paywall ] ( http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optiontobuy&amp;id=2016-49298-001 ) ) you 'd be able to see that there 's indeed a difference , the average homosexual couple are ** significantly better parents ** than the average heterosexual one ( with kids ranking higher in every single psycological parameter ) . 
  the reason for this is obviously not buttsecks making you a better parent or anything like that , it comes down to the better economic situation , virtually inexistent poverty , higher education levels and much higher willingness that are all part of the `` homosexual couple trying to adopt kids '' profile . 
  ahh yes nueva granada , we meet again . 
   same applies to gays couples with even higher magnitude . 
  any sources ? 
   some of them have exceptional education . 
  yeah , all those doctors and engineers from university of damasco are known for being the brightest people out there and definitely some of [ the best and most desirable professionals you could possibly find ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/d5d0bb96-49a8-11e6-8d68-72e9211e86ab ) . 
  i mean , syria was ~ ~ literrally ~ ~ figuratively switzerland before the civil war , it is known . 
  i hope you ever get to realize that you and the person you 're replying to are both the exact same thing . 
   could you imagine being a kid with 2 fathers ? 
  i could , yeah . 
   your whole life would be confusing as fuck , and you 'd definitely develop some emotional problems without a mother . 
  i could have lived without my mom perfectly fine , a few million kids in europe are doing so right now in fact . 
  i usually hate * attacking * the speaker but this * need a mom * stuff genuinely ends up reading like projection ... 
   we do not have any data on that yet we do actually , plenty of it . 
   is there a point on this message ? 
   keep in mind that this poll was done exclusively online which means participants were volunteering and therefore is completely worthless . 
  fixed that for them . 
   no one ca n't smoke . 
  some people ca n't have children . 
  you do n't have to write a boolean law , and adoptions are a thing . 
  i know it , you know it , everyone knows it . 
   we have our own national tv broadcaster ( tve ) which is funded without fees . 
  ( it gets its money from regular taxes . 
  useless semantics , we pay around ~ 20 $ / year for rtve regardless of how much you twist it . 
  tvg is even worse , in 2015 it ended up costing more than 38 $ per capita ... 
  no thanks . 
  i 'd rather spend the ~ 60 $ / year that i 'm already forced to pay for the two useless state propaganda corporations in stuff that i do want or any actually productive endeavor , i do n't even own a fucking tv ffs ... 
   * inb4 he tells you how the objective facts are all wrong and no one earns more than 1300 $ because him and his 20something friends are all mileuristas *, 
   * i ca n't believe you would close the fence in current_year *, 
  people were ** literally shaking ** around him . 
   * in europe you can wear what you want , we do n't regulate dressing *  * altenative facts elel * just another day good old europa . 
  sometimes i wish i had a job where something like this could ever happen to me , instead i get to choose between flattening my ass for 8 hour a day or getting weird looks for using the guetto standing desk . 
  i do have reddit , that 's something i guess ... 
  * france is france . 
  why not ? 
  the `` phobia '' buzz keeps on giving . 
   so i 'll complain and try to restrict how others dress oh , but this the status quo , how people have to dress is very much law . 
  put some transparent pants on and go for a walk , let us know hot it goes . 
  looks like unions wo n't have the dignity of dying as heroes . 
  reminds me of some lgbt orgs ... money / power are one hell of a drug . 
  and if i had wheels i might be a bicycle . 
  why the hell would we want to take the poor ( by their standards ) people in the first place ? 
  inmigration is not about solving poverty and/or feeling good about pretending to do some morally right thing , anyone even remotely implying otherwise is either a shameless liar or a fool , inmigration is about we getting a needed demographic boost with the incentive of a quality of life boost for the fortunate ones . 
  it 's all business , whether you want to admit it or not . 
  yep , i ca n't even begin to think of one reason why would want to import muslims when we can tap into a continent with plenty of people who becomes 99 % spanish in less than a generation and would actually love to live here . 
  that 's just the bbc being shitty , as usual . 
   the worlds greatest democratic institution lmfao, 
   european migrant crisis , terrorism , radical islam , weak growth , unemployment rate of 10 % , trump & brexit effects . 
  ... why am i supposed to care exactly ? 
  greece \u2639, 
  but is it * bio * too ??!?!, 
  thanks bby . 
  hold my beer . 
   or any other spanish leader , tbh .
