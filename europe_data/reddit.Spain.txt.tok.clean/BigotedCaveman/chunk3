  smh, 
  lol, 
   russia , china and turkey truly inspiring places . 
  absolutely nothing . 
   `` if twitter forces me to see these things . . that 's so fucking retarded that is not even funny anymore . 
  which goes back to this point . 
   meanwhile , the earth is losing creatures that will be gone forever . 
  like it has for way longer than we 've been here and keep on doing for long after we disappear . 
  shithead imaginary friend in the sky . 
   there a knife man in eiffel tower just few days ago ? 
  https://religion.ofpeace.info/ time for an update . 
   - `` educate yourself ''  - * links some quora shit * ^ ^ ^ ^ lmao, 
   homophobic attacks are not uncommon i do n't see any numbers . 
  how popular the cult is . 
  good , it should be more . 
  i too can make shitty youtube videos that `` prove '' anything i could possibly want . 
  sounds like a you problem , not a dutch cities problem . 
  i 've done it a coru\u00f1a , santiago , vigo , madrid , barcelona , tarragona so far . 
   ut what 's the point of minimum wage if companies can get away with paying less ? 
  because you 're not an employee and you 're not supposed to be doing many of the things that employees do , namely , taking responsibility . 
  for equality of opportunity , it mostly is . 
  is n't the limit for internships a year ? 
  i mean , it sucks , but it 's just the first year of your career . 
   he funny thing about `` free university '' is that it does n't mean university for all . 
  are you somehow implying that everyone should go to university ? 
  deal with it . 
  isabel best spanish leader of my life . 
  atlantic coast , best coast . 
  that 's not a problem in itself . 
  the real question is ... do they want to come back ? 
  jesus fuck , every time i see this * argument * i wonder whether the poster is 12 or they simply never had contact with any kind of democratic system . 
  it 's literally impossible for citizens to agree with a political party in every single issue , for a country of 40 million you 'd need 40 million political parties and even that would n't be enough on a bad day . 
  people vote the less bad option , and then get to protest against the things that do n't like most about it , this is how democracy is supposed to and does work . 
  try to keep up . 
   people are doing things about it : it 's already banned in catalonia no . 
  what the video portrays was perfectly legal in catalonia even before the repeal , it was specifically given an exception because who the fuck cares about not torturing animals when you can push your nationalist agenda instead ... 
  we 're the cool kids mate , you 'll be picked last . 
   ** nearly the whole world ** crucified the netherlands over a bunch of people painting their faces black and lmao 99.999 % of the world has absolutely no idea what are you talking about right now . 
  some correbous fan probably . 
  yet . 
   what if they 're choosing a certain thing because of systematic opression lol * what if i suddenly grow a pair of wheels ? 
  would i be more bicycle or human ? 
   it prohibits vpns and proxies to allow access to banned resources . 
  so , every single one of them . 
  there 's no way for a third party to verify such a thing . 
  * but my buzzwords mate ... *, 
   `` zomg bread and assorted meats . 
  and wine . 
  i must know where to find such a delicacy '' lmao to be fair you right , i can make most of those dishes in 15 minutes , and that includes the quick trip to the supermarket . 
  no pls . 
  stop . 
   which is a well respected organisation with good reputation * `` we are the most reputable human trafficking ring !, 
  whining in a obscure , technical paper locked behind a paywall will surely make your voice heard . 
  absolutely brilliant idea . 
  jesus fuck that website ... javascript was a mistake . 
   * using mysql * i 've left jobs for less . 
  gerardo pls . 
   they have all the right like the rest of non-homo people excluding does related to children and marriage . 
  do they pay the same taxes ? 
  do they have time off work to mourn or care for their loved one ? 
  do they inherit their properties when something happens to them ? 
  i 've never said i preferred anything . 
  i was just stating a fact : a dictatorship will always be able to govern more effectively than a democracy , period . 
  whether you or me agree with that particular governance is a completely different matter . 
   a democracy ensures that all political parties participate in the political discourse uhh ? 
  it definitely does n't , at least not european democracies . 
  no , he was horrible . 
  in addition to the serious opression he caused ( which is expected considering how he came to power ) he and his whole cabinets were also massively inept in pretty much all technical matters , we 're still feeling the scars of falling almost 40 years behind the rest of europe . 
  a good dictatorship is ** objetively ** better than democracy , one single body making decisions is and will always be vastly more effective and efficient than a huge clusterfuck of different powers and interests . 
  the problem comes with deciding what a `` good '' dictatorship is . 
  absolutely everyone holds dozens if not hundreds of identities . 
  `` study '' pseudo sciences are funny indeed . 
  i 'm good , thanks . 
   us , for example , is one of the most culturally diverse countries lmfao, 
  it 's the uniform . 
  people expect governmental institutions to not be 100 % useless . 
   i have a friend who is a professional fighter and he said he would run . 
  because he 's smart . 
   there is a reason why women feel less safe there actually is n't , they 're in a lot less danger than men . 
   vigo so , portugal . 
  slavery is and/or has been endemic to pretty much the entirety of the world . 
  there 's absolutely nothing self-flagellating about pointing out historical atrocities . 
  implying that current day belgians have any responsibility in it , is . 
  or maybe ... just hear me out , cutting people 's hands for not being exploited hard enough is unbelievably wrong . 
  truly wild ideas floating around this thread mate . 
  pointless . 
  these must be the fuckers that keep oppressing catalonia . 
  absolutely shameful . 
   the diputaci\u00f3n and ayuntamiento are trying to break the ghettos by relocating gypsies there , and they just kill each other . 
  there is an argument for natural selection . 
  `` not bad '' ? 
  i 'd say fucking great . 
  i struggle to think of a better place to live if you have a really good job ... but that 's a huge * if * here . 
  so you 're just preventively beating a strawman that does n't even exist yet ? 
  sounds productive . 
  do we really need a list of reasons why mutilating babies is wrong ? 
   * i 'm glad they chopped my ears off at birth . 
  i do n't remember the pain and i do n't have to get it done later *, 
  bing , yahoo and duckduckgo are perfectly fine search engines for 99 % of google 's users . 
  apple has only ~ 10 % of the mobile os marketshare .
