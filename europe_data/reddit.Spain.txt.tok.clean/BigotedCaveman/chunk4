  name literally one google service that does n't have suitable alternatives . 
  bing is not only perfectly viable for general use but also vastly superior in some scenarios . 
  you vastly overestimate the importance of google . 
  there 's literally nothing that people do at google that ca n't be done elsewhere , their only great ( as in , significantly better than the alternatives ) product is the search , an even there the competitors are fine for 99 % of the use-cases . 
  the proper analogy is apple selling ** their own car ** ( an apple made phone , running their own os ) with with an engine ( webkit ) and no letting others attach more completely redundant engines to it . 
  which from my consumer and developer pov is one of ios 's strongest points , their `` no-compromise , period '' engineering approach is the reason why i pay 700 $ for their phones when i could buy an equally functional android-based one for ~ 200 $ . 
  everything , really . 
  i genuinely ca n't think of one good thing / product oracle has ever done . 
  what if i told you that not everything in life is about money ? 
  oh god , not another week of this ...  * dae le volume sliderino ?

  it 's really not . 
  as someone who plans on moving there in a few years please keep it the way it is . 
   i consider language , culture , internal politics and all that be still within the concept of `` nation '' . 
  then no such thing as a `` spanish nation '' exist for you , because we have quite a few different languages , cultures and internal politics . 
   2/3 of the seats is impossible because catalonia accounts for 16 % of the population of spain . 
  assuming that non-catalonian spaniards are automagically against the vote is completely absurd . 
  absolutely haram . 
  actually , they 're a bunch of words on some paper . 
  they 're exactly the same thing . 
  some words written on a piece of paper and enforced by an state , who can choose to stop doing so at any time . 
  this would clearly not have happen without crypto . 
   not really , it just adds another layer on the network stack . 
  not good for performance and bandwidth , but no reason why it would n't be practical . 
  you ca n't really implement any sort of login / proper interactivity without encryption , you 'd have to send credentials in plain text ... 
  which btw sounds wonderful if i were a terrorist . 
  that would break pretty much everything that is not a completely dumb web page . 
  again , not feasible . 
  trying to ban https and other such encrypted protocols implies the immediate destruction of pretty much the entirety of uk economy as it is today . 
  but hey , after a few months of chaos you could go back to the 70 's !, 
   uk prime minister may wants to ban crypto she might as well want to grow wings and fly away . 
  tatcher actually had a point .

   you could always add an extra number on the right ... 
  think again about what you just said ... 
  as far as i 'm concerned the correct side is the right , euros is a unit . 
  short answer : no . 
  long answer : no . 
  and encryption too . 
  maybe , i 'd make a terrible a nurse for sure . 
  so is abusing some the most hardworking and important professionals in society for reasons that amount to absolutely nothing more than pure greed and corruption , and then go laugh in their face on live tv like the massive cunt she is . 
  so yeah , i 'd actually enjoy to see that , call it evil if you want , i 'll call it karma and sleep like a baby tonight . 
  i 'm pretty conservative actually . 
  she should just die on live tv . 
  i would n't even bother to help her if i was the nurse . 
  how so ? 
  i 've seen no reason to believe that macron is pants-on-head retarded yet . 
  * allegedly *, 
   * who killed those baby boys ? 
  other women . 
  your gender is a danger to others . 
  *  * downvote all you like , you 'll keep throwing innocent babies into dumpsters and leave them to die while complaining that some of you occasionally get a beating . 
  * ^ this is how batshit insane you are . 
   ( nice scare quotes ) those are perfectly factual quotes , a bar for homosexual people would be 100 % illegal under eu law . 
   have you ever considered that the purpose of `` gay bars '' ( nice scare quotes ) is not just protection from discrimination or persecution ? 
  yes ? 
  i 've been to them . 
   if you meet someone in the real world , chances are they 're straight . 
  the number of gay people you 're just going to run into at random is pretty low , and for some of them , you wo n't even know they 're not straight because that 's the default and everyone is assumed straight until proven otherwise . 
  unless your social awareness is -1 it 's pretty simple to take your chances and see if someone could be interested in you , in fact , the process is exactly the same for straight people ( we just have a lower success chance , for obvious reasons ) . 
  sometimes it genuinely feels like redditors do n't actually leave their house ...  gay gathering spots of some sort are the only places where your chances of meeting someone for a relationship or sex are close to what straight people get in the rest of the world . 
  i 've never argued against that . 
   lgbt people do this all the time in america . 
  america does indeed have a history with segregation , the fact that it shaped your culture is not exactly news . 
  but this is r/europe and that 's a cancer that has no place in something that tries to be an equal , cohesive society . 
   or what if lgbt people said we did n't want straight people at a pride event ? 
  would n't it be largely understood ? 
  no it fucking would n't . 
  feel free to do it at home if you do n't want * the breeders * around . 
  i 'm a minority and this post oppresses me . 
  please remove yourself from the internet . 
   nobody has bad intentions , but the gay bar eventually stops being a gay bar and ca n't serve it 's purpose anymore . 
  this is called normalization , and many people fought and , in the case of spain , died for it . 
  so kindly fuck off , absolutely everyone can and should be able to go to a so called `` gay bar '' , if it stops `` serving it 's purpose '' people will freely and organically move to some other spaces , that 's how a free and equal civil society works . 
   3 women were just killed by men in one day in spain as oppossed to how many men ? 
  did the * news * tell you how many men where killed today ? 
   60 since january and how many men where killed since january ? 
  you know , so we can put the data in perspective . 
   i wo n't fault them for wanting to leave men at the door . 
  would you fault hospitals for leaving women at the door ? 
  throwing babies into dumpsters is definitely wrong . 
  are you denying that islam is an integral part of the syrian culture and by extension the syrian people ? 
  is this some sort of low effort meme or something ? 
   do you honestly think the world would be a better place without shaquille o'neil ? 
  it would be exactly the same since the action of throwing rubber spheres through a metal a ring for no productive reason does not actually have any significant impact on the development of a society . 
  i 'm also pretty sure that such a guy can exist regardless of islam , he 's known for playing basketball , not for things like listening to nickleback , worshipping allah or watching my little pony . 
   fool , i 'm european . 
  do n't try socialise your personal failures , insecurities and inadequacies . 
  and certainly do n't try associate them with me . 
  fuck yea , [ send them this pic afterwards . 
  the fact that importing islam by the millions is acceptable suggests that 's no longer the case . 
  we 're being outclassed at the oppression olympics . 
  this is called the internet , and that 's a 100 % public site . 
  nobody actually cares about some useless , completely unenforceable meaningless * rule * that reddit pretends to have .
