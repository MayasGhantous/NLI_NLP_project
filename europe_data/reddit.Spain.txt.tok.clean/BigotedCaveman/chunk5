   * fans *, 
  sweden btfo . 
  same applies to the other dolls , yes . 
  what do \u00fdou mean ? 
  it 's fucking great compared to a few years ago . 
  hell , i 've actually turned down a few job offers recently , which as a part of the so called * lost generation * it is a completely new experience for me . 
  \u00ddou mean i can get free shit by just going to the beach a few days ? 
  this is big . 
   `` they 're not looking for a peaceful country to live in , they 're looking for a germany to live in . '', 
  truly incredible revelation . 
   and ? 
  he is still a husband to a pm . 
  which means literally nothing . 
  he was not elected to nor should have anything to do with his husband 's job . 
  read the article . 
   * mostly syrians , afghans and iraqis * damm , schengen grows so fast !, 
   i 'm sure they will not be happy if you start treating them in this way . 
  at least i would be pretty offended if i were king of saudi arabia with 40 billion dollars fortune . 
  40 bazillion dollars !! 1111 !, 
  i really could n't care less , nor see why the spanish state should , they 're not an important economic partner whatsoever . 
   you ca n't really stop interacting with them you do n't need to stop interacting with them , just stop importing people from there . 
  you can still have talks , trade goods and host visitors in a perfectly healthy manner . 
   after all you already have some of them inside , they have children in your country , these children will be unhappy and eventually they will get more radical . 
  not at all , in fact , the group that has more to lose from bad immigration is precisely the immigrants that are already here since the actions of some generally end up creating tension towards all of them . 
  the last thing someone moving away from some islamic shithole needs is bringing more islam here . 
   the problem is that if you start valuing security more than anything else you go further and further along this road and eventually end up being locked in one single tiny room in your great giant rich house  ahh yes , the slippery slope . 
  cool story as usual , needs more nazis tho . 
  lmao  * but what if the gulf countries get mad that we stop importing islam ????!?!?!? 
   'm not willing to give up freedom of movement or opportunity you 're living a fantasy world , no such thing has ever existed nor ever will ( not in our lifetimes anyway ) . 
  you do n't need to check individuals whatsoever . 
  you select a bunch of countries with a somewhat similar culture and host people from those , in the case of spain there 's literally no reason to take people from anywhere but europe / latin america unless they 're high skill workers coming with an employment contract . 
  like i said , it 's super simple . 
  or we could simply stop importing culturally incompatible people . 
  it 's extremely simple . 
  big, 
  yes . 
  also correlated with how much of a shithole the place is . 
  sad !, 
   * windoze * opinion discarded . 
  for now . 
   gay people dont spread their genes , which means their genes are purged from the gene-pool anyway . 
  that 's really not how genetics works , it 's * a bit * more complex . 
  that would require absolutely massive changes to the way our society organizes , specially on the taxation side . 
  but it would be interesting to see , to say the least . 
  which is exactly the same , since all donations are screened without exceptions . 
  in spain at least . 
   the life of children adopted by same sex couples is drastically worse than those in normal families when it comes to depression and identification crisises . 
  no , children of same-sex couples are significantly more healthy and successful than the general population . 
  the adoption bias is huge , obviously , but given the context it is fair to make the comparison . 
   but 100 % against full adoptions , there are conflicting studies ont the subject not really . 
  having one or two studies that find some negative impact among dozens and dozens that support that they 're not only as well off but actually better ( due to adoption bias ) is not what any scientist would call `` conflicting '' . 
   and tbh there should 've been no studies on the first place , you have to use human children as test subjects . 
  they 're not thrown into giant test tubes if that 's what you have in mind , we just ask them some questions and look at data that is either public or freely given , the impact on their life is literally zero . 
  not even half a peanut . 
  it 's the exact same issue . 
  and a bunch of thugs in a suit would be absolutely useless to stop any fairly elaborated assassination attempt in the first place , specially in a country where is perfectly legal to own firearms . 
  is there any reason why the authorities are still letting him bring those thugs when they 're known to be criminals ? 
  the host country should be perfectly able to provide security for a foreign visit , otherwise fuck off . 
  lmao this has to be a joke . 
  this must be how america being great looks like . 
  not impressed tbh . 
  this has to be a joke . 
  if not , get some economics , high school ones will suffice . 
  all european telecoms will do it , every single one of them . 
  the danish ones are just upfront about it . 
  it 's regular 2017 newspeak . 
  that 's what they say , we started together and they 're earning quite a bit less than me now but things are a lot less expensive so overall quality of life is great . 
  one of them is thinking about coming back though , he 's living with a qt pole that he already knew and they 're planning on marrying eventually which is simply not possible there . 
  completely anecdotal , but two of my friends left for warsaw last year ( we work in it ) . 
  nobody cares about your completely ignorant american opinions , they 're worthless . 
  stop projecting your own problems , that 's not how the world works . 
  that 's a fault of eurovision more than anything . 
  i 'd ban english for everyone but uk , ireland and maaaaaybe malta if it were up to me . 
  yeah , it 's the first time that i unironically love an eurovision song . 
  native language , catchy tune and the harambe presentation that is actually pretty witty if you look at the lyrics . 
  then let 's end the eu , because this is exactly what the common market is . 
  i certainly would n't call the us culturally diverse , quite the opposite . 
  for it 's size , it is incredibly homogeneous . 
   i think writing `` tend to form ghettos and become conflictive '' is racist and in no way constructive . 
  no , it 's just objective reality . 
  deal with it . 
   do you really think anyone on earth thinks it 's fun forming ghettos and get into trouble . 
  whether they find it fun or not is completely irrelevant , ultimately , that 's what 's happening . 
   the country is not that conservative . 
  more people voted for hillary clinton , ** who although is very centrist , was the more liberal choice ** . 
  is this a joke ? 
  hillary clinton is a hugely conservative politician by most european standards . 
   we are already diverse , many different countries with different languages , cultures and heritages spread over a rather small amount of land . 
  they all share foundations , that 's the point . 
   their children will grow up as europeans . 
  as seen by the last 2 years of emergency state due to terrorism by ** second generation ** islam trash . 
  we should just import more latin americans with their despacitos . 
  yes . 
  that 's exactly what they were . 
   it 's a reference to swedish rape culture ftfy, 
   * i was merely pretending to be retarded . 
  lmao, 
  ** reality ** : no one will remember who that guy is in a week . 
  in fact , the epic sax guy is a million times more relevant than he 's ever going to be . 
  the fact that some eurovision trash genuinely thinks that he 's adding something to music is hilarious .
