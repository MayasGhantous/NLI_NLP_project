   * i made `` generic sad song # 28749323 '' which people will forget it a week , bow down to me you lesser beings . 
  residentsleeper, 
  * please tell us . 
  i 'm sure he will cope mate . 
  the israel guy should do porn instead of singing . 
  romania is the objectively superior choice . 
  a e s t h e t i c, 
  i do n't want to be spanish anymore . 
  who the fuck are those fuccbois ? 
  based australia . 
  microsoft 's `` shit software '' was updated to fix this ** a month ago ** . 
  they are not responsible for some other organization 's shitty it practices . 
  you should probably refrain from dropping that stupid '' * linux is automagically more secure * '' meme in threads with a high probably of having people that know what they 're talking about in them . 
  this is why operative systems need to be kept updated , no excuses . 
  period . 
  not only telef\u00f3nica , other large it companies like indra closed doors on some offices at midday as well , just in case . 
  that 's actually correct . 
  lmao @ trying to put the big data genie back in the bottle . 
  mostly because poor it practices . 
  stop pretending to be retarded , it 's embarrassing . 
  generally that it 's very accessible without putting you in any kind of debt , it 's also pretty light on commitment since for the most part the `` go to the exam and vomit everything '' model still dominates over a more presential , continuous effort approach ( bologna tried to change this , and oh boy , did they screech about it ... ) but the really big deal here is that there is this foolish notion of university education being the ultimate , unconditional economic equalizer regardless of the studies taken or the quality of them . 
  for less affluent families having their kids go to university is seen as the thing to do and many people are convinced that going 4 years to some class is the recipe for a pretty much guaranteed successful career / life . 
  that 's why you have useless universities in every city full of many people that should n't be there getting many degrees that will be virtually useless once they start looking into the job market . 
  and of course , this all happens at the expense of quality , which varies from `` absolutely terrible '' in most to `` ok '' in the best ones . 
  then of course reality hits and they realize that having a shitty degree from some shitty university is not going to make them successful and many end up forever bitter and * overqualified * for the jobs that they end up doing , and that 's * spain 's fault * somehow . 
  well , everyone knows what the penalty for leaving islam is . 
  and if you import islam , you get islam , it 's extremely simple . 
  spicy, 
  spanish university in a nutshell . 
  it 's fucking horrible , being cheap is literally the only thing it has going for it and the worst of all is that most young people actually defend the system in it 's current form . 
   our educational system is completely focused on university and even teachers direct people to study a degree and never vocational training unless you have bad grades . 
  which is pretty funny , because i got into software development through vocational training ( 2 years ) and i 'm currently earning significantly more than my schoolmates that went straight to a cs degree , by the time they got their first internship i was already losing the `` junior '' badge , had a pretty decent network and on my way to a much better professional path than the one they 're on now . 
  half a decade later i still have plenty of time to finish my degree before hitting any kind of ceiling , going with the top-down approach is easily the best decision i 've made in my life . 
  food at mcdonalds is perfectly labeled ( in fact , vastly better labeled than 99 % of the restaurants out there ) and you can know exactly what you 're eating and whatever implications it may have . 
  people who go there are making a perfectly conscious decision to do so , period . 
   it 's like legalizing the consumption of drugs and poison . 
  [ [ buzzwords ] ], 
  sounds like a reason to vote for le pen . 
  if there 's a mcdonald 's on every street corner is because huge amounts of people on those streets want to eat there . 
  the core principle of capitalism is pretty fucking simple . 
  why though . 
  or you could live with your parents until you move in with someone else and have much happier and wealthier ( for both you and your parents ) life in the meantime . 
  it probably comes down to the cultural aspect though , my parents have always ** wanted ** me to live with them rather than alone . 
   people are not dying because of socialism lmfao get some history mate . 
   i 'm willing to bet if you ask r/lgbt or r/gay you 're not going to find the average homosexual there . 
   * private rescue organizations * that 's some newspeak right there . 
   execute this man for being gay  get rid of gay marriage that * descalated * quickly ... 
  because they can . 
   western governments are refusing to negotiate with or tolerate them . 
  surely by `` western governments '' you mean israel ? 
  because that 's the only one that is not laughing stock . 
   '' * you will not have my hatred * '' beautiful but empty words , it does n't matter , at least not to his dead husband . 
  corpses simply ca n't care either way . 
   they 're also incredibly racist against foreigners and incredibly unaccepting of immigrants . 
  they have aging populations ( south korea , japan ) that are already starting to put a strain on their societies and it 's only going to get worse , unless they either get a baby boom ( extremely unlikely ) or start letting in immigrants . 
  sounds great . 
  they 'll get out of the stupid demographical cycle just in time for the blunt of white collar automation to take over . 
  lol 'd, 
   ctrl + f `` islam '' : 0 results the guardian , not even once . 
  what so special about sunday ? 
   this choice of words is so extremely racist i literally could n't care less about your buzzwords mate , you 'll have to find some other way to attack me . 
  islam is not a race and from an economics perspective people are resources , period . 
   you just said you want gay muslims to stay in countries were they have no conditions . 
  the ones that ** chose ** to follow islam are getting the conditions that they want . 
   and you also forget that many muslims have european nationality . 
  and a significant part of them are a problem , a problem that has no reasonable solution now . 
  sounds like the best argument for not repeating the mistakes of previous generations . 
   exactly , you do n't care about lgbt people , as i said . 
  you just want to bash muslims . 
  again , i 'll do both things . 
  i 'd be happy with spain serving as a home for the ones that do n't choose to be muslim , the rest are already getting the oppression that they ask for . 
   but you still need to respect freedom of religion . 
  freedom from religion                   freedom of religion . 
   people can have their religion , as long as they do n't interfere with other people 's life . 
  oh but it does , what happens to every single country where people that follow islam becomes a majority is perfectly documented , the fact that you ca n't name a single muslim country that is not a shithole ( not even the ones that should be * desert supernorway * ) should be pretty self-explanatory . 
   what about lgbt muslims ? 
  what do you do to them ? 
  i do n't `` do '' anything to them , if they want to be `` muslim '' it 's their problem . 
  they can keep either lying to themselves by pretending to be muslim but going against key teaching of islam or hating what they are because their imaginary skydad told them to , i could n't care less about that kind of hypocrisy as long as they do it in their own countries , where their influence can not possibly harm the freedom that i have here . 
   most muslim countries are n't even democracies . 
  thanks for making my point , that 's not politics that i would ever want to welcome into my country . 
  it took a lot of suffering , blood and time to make spain work as a democracy , the last thing we need is less of it . 
   many of them are poor and lack good education . 
  so do many south americans or east asians , and yet that does n't drive them to throw people out of buildings . 
   you 're not worried with lgbt people . 
  you 're worried with bashing muslims . 
  both actually , i care about my rights ** and ** also about the fact that islam is currently ( and for foreseeable future ) the biggest cancer humanity has to endure , while other religions are slowly but surely being put in their place islam keeps growing and adding oppression , misery and war to it . 
  for the purpose of this thread they indeed do , the mainstream politics in every single majority muslim nation in the world ranges from incarceration to death sentence . 
  but please , do tell us more about this diversity of thought they have going on , it 's truly fascinating ... 
   we are talking about the politics in europe here . 
  politics are people not some line on the ground , if you bring new people who are not willing to leave their ideas behind you 're bringing their politics too , it 's a game of demographics , and they massively win at it . 
  not yet . 
   you act like every muslim is isis member . 
  no i did n't , you 're the only one doing that . 
  but hey , let 's compare to the [ purely mainstream politics and thought ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_by_country_or_territory#/media/file:world_laws_pertaining_to_homosexual_relationships_and_expression.svg ) in the muslim world then . 
  how many people where incarcerated or sentenced to death for being gay in poland or romania last year ? 
  remind us , how many homosexuals where thrown out of buildings in poland last year ? 
  have you tried ... you know ... taking a peek at demographics ? 
   they shall be defeated in elections that 's not how demographics work . 
  what if i told you that people care about other things that are not marriage ?
