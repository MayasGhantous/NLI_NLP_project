`` lo \u00fanico que separa a espa\u00f1a de italia es el mar '' -- `` the only thing that separes spain from italy is the sea '', 
   expat [ expatriado ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/expatriado ) , it 's the same due to having the same latin roots . 
  [ english etymology of expatriate . 
  ] ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=expatriate ), 
  una pena . 
  -- yeah , but what really bothers me is the fact that they create their own ghettos and do n't mix with spaniards nor they want to adapt . 
  i live in alicante and many villages from the coast , once fisherman villages , are now british overseas territories . 
  a shame . 
  i think they forgot to add some pineapple and some bacon to this traditional spanish tortilla . 
  indeed his nick was `` el manco de lepanto '' ( the one-handed of lepanto ) . 
  i feel really sad when i see this shit ; w/o vaccines maybe you or me would n't be here now because our fathers or grandfathers could have died due to illness , and now , in the 21st century , instead looking for new treatments and vaccines , we are fighting this stupid morons that think vaccines are bad for your health . 
  jenner and pasteur are squirming in their graves for sure . 
  you have been scammed . 
  i 've been in dozens of places and hotels and everyone of them had a bidet . 
  do n't know in other countries , but in spain , my fathers generation were told that vt is for people that do n't want to study because they lack capacity or are lazy ( as you can clearly see in the chart ) ; the result : we have too many graduated people and not enough people ready to work . 
  [ here 's an article speaking about the topic ( in spanish ) . 
  if i 'm in my house , i do n't use soap after pissing cause i 'm clean and my bathroom is clean too , but if i 'm using a foreign one , then yes . 
  for everything else apart from pissing , soap is mandatory , i touch my face and my eyes hundreds os times , i do n't want to get an infection . 
  in spain too , indeed , i use it every time i poo , followed by a very meticulous cleaning of hands . 
  i use my hands to wash my ass after defecating , it 's waaaaay more cleaner and hygienic , ofc i clean my hands really well after that , but after all , it 's a really good habit . 
  not only that , trees and plants do some really important jobs like holding terrains or maintaining the humidity in the air . 
  as you would imagine for a place with really tempered winters and really hot summers ; we freeze if the temperature falls below 15\u00ba because neither our houses nor us are prepared ... 
   do you feel european ? 
  geographically i 'm european anyways , so ofc yes . 
   when did you realize that you are part of the european family ? 
  when we accepted the $ , is like a signal that we are part of something bigger , in this case , a family . 
   what kind of situation make you proud of being european ? 
  i 'm vegetarian and environmentalist , so for me is all the pro-green things and really strict regulations we have regarding animal cruelty and their raise conditions . 
   what is europe ( the continent ) for you ? 
  my home . 
  you remind me of those persons living in spain in foreign `` ghettos '' where only english is spoken and no one wants to integrate into the spanish culture . 
  trying to live in a country w/o knowing a word of the local language is rude and stupid , not everyone may know english , specially if you go outside the important cities . 
  this article is complete garbage . 
  [ here 's one article with more details from 20minutos ] ( http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/2931315/0/hombre-irrumpe-con-disparos-supermercado-ourense-incidente-que-se-salda-con-su-detencion-sin-heridos/ ) , a well known spanish newspaper . 
  it basically says that this man , a well known customer in the supermarket that lived in a building near it , had psychological problems and the current investigation does n't point to a political or religious act . 
  and here in alicante i can only dream about 1 day of rain ... :(, 
  if i get good marks this year in my grade i can do erasmus , i 'm so exited !, 
  i will probably go to ireland , they are really good people and i think that cultures are really similar . 
  that 's how you kill freedom of speech . 
  i thought this was going to be a beautiful landscape , but quickly my smile turned into a sad face . 
  poor people ... 
  take a look [ at this article ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/07/06/inenglish/1436183846_250471.html ) , explains really well why we are not anti-immigrant at all . 
  eta only did one thing right : training really good our forces , and that 's a really good thing watching what 's happening in other countries with less experience in the subject . 
  wow , so many pretty names from all around europe for boys and girls !!, 
  i will have a hard time when the time comes , even when i know that i love my own name ... 
  sure , [ this one ] ( http://alphadesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/europe-according-to-france.png ), 
  in spain we still love you furansu-chan < 3, 
  maybe galicia , extremadura , west andalucia and west castilla y le\u00f3n know some portuguese because this communities are close to portugal , but the rest of spain ? 
  0 knowledge , but tbh , you does n't need to know portuguese to understand . 
  holy shit , this is really accurate xd, 
  both , but better if is written , 
  no one said it , but this is one of the masterpieces of all time from spanish cinema : [ los santos inocentes ] ( http://www.filmaffinity.com/en/film879812.html ) . 
  incredibly sad and truly represents what was the spanish countryside in the 60 's . 
  it 's [ valenciano ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/valencian ) , a variety of catalan spoken in the valencian community . 
  feliz a\u00f1o / bon any nou/happy new year !!!, 
  yeah , it 's a advantage that the majority of the languages here comes from germanic or romance ones . 
  because i 'm spaniard i can read/understand with little to no troubles portuguese and italian , i 'm valenciano too , so i can speak and understand french , and all of this with little to no formation . 
  awesome to be european . 
  & nbsp ; ^ ^ ^ ps : ^ ^ ^ no ^ ^ ^ one ^ ^ ^ cares , ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ proud ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ say ^ ^ ^ that , ^ ^ ^ apart ^ ^ ^ from ^ ^ ^ being ^ ^ ^ fluent ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ 3 ^ ^ ^ languages ( spanish , ^ ^ ^ valencian ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ english ) , ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ can ^ ^ ^ understand ^ ^ ^ w/o ^ ^ ^ troubles ^ ^ ^ 3 ^ ^ ^ more , ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ more ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ less ^ ^ ^ understand ^ ^ ^ japanese . 
  ^ ^ ^ yay . 
  i bet is a really beautiful place in summer  northern countries are really beautiful in general . 
  it is n't called iceland for nothing . 
  the landscape shocked you ? 
  plus ultra . 
  in spain we just drink sangr\u00eda . 
  this is one of my favourites : [ \u00a1 aprieta fuerte compa\u00f1ero !, 
  / squeeze it strongly buddy !, 
  ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/by0jj6niaamugct.jpg:large ), 
  yeah , i know , it 's super sad . 
  [ look at this video . 
  ] ( https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mgbkdy/the-japanese-workers-who-live-in-internet-cafes ), 
   protecting the employees from exploitation . 
  i hope you are being sarcastic . 
  not everything , there are really useful posts , i managed to get a 1 $ tablet thanks to forocoches . 
  in spain we have forocoches and it 's more than enough xd, 
  the daughter of one of the directors of tve ( spanish national tv ) works with this clown , and he is catalan , so even better with the recent tensions in spain with catalonia . 
  yeah , everything was a fraud and that 's why we are happy in spain .

  nono , it 's ok as it is , we wanted 0 points , but we appreciate your 5 points as a goodwill gift xd parab\u00e9ns hermanos , you totally deserved it !, 
  do n't worry euro friends , in spain we were looking for this exact thing , this guy was awful and no one liked his song , if he ended up there is only because no one cares in spain . 
  barei was awesome and hit really hard , but not this guy nor his song . 
  tl ; dr : do n't worry , no one cares in spain . 
  -- damn portugal , stop winning everything !, 
  [ a\u00f1ado v\u00eddeo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilg_04jslqk ), 
  as green and beautiful as always portugal !, 
  to be completely honest with you : i did n't know what was the english name ( it 's valencian as you said ) . 
  thanks to your comment , now i know how to write it properly xd, 
  thanks !, 
  i now know more italian :d answering the question : i ca n't talk for entire spain , but i can guarantee to you that people in catalonia , valencian community and the balearic islands have a special place in the heart for italians , since we are the closest to italy and we have some verbs really close to the italian ones ( for example , in catalan/valenciano , you say `` menjar '' for `` eat '' and it 's really close to the italian `` mangiare '' ) , so it 's even easier for us to understand it . 
  in general , italians here are seen like you see spaniards there , we get along really well and we think you are really friendly and really similar in nearly everything . 
  ps : olive oil power !!, 
  -- [ rushed english translation since i 'm little busy right now ] it 's truly beautiful the intimate connection created when speaking in the own language with any other latin brother . 
  the most extreme experiment that i made was when i was 15 yo with other 3 girls a french , a spanish and a portuguese : we understand each other well [ ma richiede ] much time . 
  last year i was in valencia taking a class of spanish and all the people i met [ ( tranne una ) ] treated me really well . 
  we italians consider the spaniards as our fraternal brothers . 
  i was impressed that the affect is not [ cos\u00ec ] deep in the other side , [ mi sbaglio ? ], 
  i found this video really interesting , as a spaniard , i feel really connected with our italian and portuguese cousins , not only because of the language , we have + / - the same way of live ,
