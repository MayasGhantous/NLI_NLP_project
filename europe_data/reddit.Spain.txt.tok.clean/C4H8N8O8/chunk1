its german food !, 
  well , we only have colon square here in pontevedra . 
  which is weird because , allegedly , his father was from here . 
  can confirm . 
  got conquered by wincest . 
  galician here . 
  i do n't speak portuguese but regularly read news in portuguese and shitposts in / r/portugal, 
  galician speaker . 
  with my friends , with the animals , and when cursing . 
  also when i want to put emphasis on something . 
  my mother does n't speak it so i resort to spanish with my family . 
  she feels excluded otherwise . 
  and after hear her complaining about my father and me secretly talking shit about her for speaking in italian i rather not risk more drama . 
  milk and biscuits , cereal with milk , anything like that . 
  edit , to be honest our breakfast are very simple , but our midday food is very copious, 
  so many construction workers with audi and bmw . 
  aaa. , 2007 ... 
  it 's not a fad , it 's tradition . 
  i learned from my grandma, 
  is the law of bagpipes , if you have bagpipes they will scare the sun away and make women insane . 
  source : have bagpipes, 
  it depends , really . 
  colombia and venezuela , they are really attractive . 
  peru and bolivia ? 
  they all look as if they had inflammation in their faces . 
  ( and that was said by a cuban girl , not me ), 
  bereber outside me be like https://youtu.be/p3alwkeseys, 
  sigh . 
  unzips . 
  the top 10 % asian people are very attractive for me . 
  ( both sexes ) . 
  but generally i think west people are more attractive . 
  and other south americans . 
  we need to build a wall in the airport, 
  i do really like this one : https://youtu.be/lnoftnv-3by?t=2, 
  because when they let the people vote , this happens : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urqhztbm97i, 
  yea , we abuse surrealism to much , either for humor purposes , or for some artistic `` deep '' purposes . 
  you fucking wish https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/reino_suevo, 
  no thats valencia . 
  you are just south galiza , or galiza is north portugal . 
  whatever . 
  how weird , never heard about it . 
  even in spain, 
  what is portugal ? 
  sandals , is fucking sandals, 
  just remember that the ussr won every achievement , until the us decided that the moon was the thing that make you win , and , since the ussr space-stuff leader had died , the ussr decided to stop with the space-stuff altogether . 
   they are n't spanish movies , so that 's a pro . 
  what have the tits done to you , bro ? 
  what about this ? 
  http://www.herofist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/27.jpg superlopez is a superman parody that was very popular here , here you can see the justice flirters ( ligar = flirt in spanish ) , of the direct competence , formed by kriptonman , owl , hottie , green lantern and siren-man . 
  i ate a hamburguer from a vending machine for 3 $ . 
  saved me 30 minutes , took away 3 ~ years of lifespan . 
  the biggest `` spain square '' is in rome . 
  becoming impossible to have a stable government, 
  exactly my point . 
  most military experts say that they have an outdated military . 
  having an elite plane division doesnt mean that the rest isnt outdated compared to the nato one . 
  then , i dont know how reliable they are when speaking . 
  but anyway , even with top notch army equipment , they shouldnt be able to fight with the nato . 
  because to place a donald trump in america is a thing , to place a donald trump everywhere is ... just a remainder . 
  vietnam war was lost because of propaganda , propaganda convinced people that vietnam was an slaughtering when the usa was wining the war . 
  forcing them to retire . 
  large chunks of it are . 
  russia would have to turn many cities to dust to win a war by nuke . 
  the west would only need to hit a few cities . 
  the savoy king we had was pretty good . 
  until he said `` fuck this country '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amadeo_i_of_spain, 
  i actually think that monarchies are helpful to countries . 
  an unpopular opinion for a leftist in spain . 
  it helps with diplomacy a lot , and i think the spanish king is the one responsible for avoiding spain to turn into , well , italy . 
  yea . 
  unusual monarchies are fun to read about . 
  we had a king from the house of savoy that ended saying fuck you , this countrie is too hard im going back to italy : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amadeo_i_of_spain actually a nice dude . 
  he resigned because , not only he had no political support ( his biggest supported died in a terrorist atack ) , but he resigned because he didnt want to sign death penalties . 
  well our king/king father is in the process of becoming a cyborg . 
  that or a cyberman . 
  the ultimate elephant killing machine . 
  but nobody does that anymore . 
  im more of a generation z myself . 
  and yea , it is growing , people are realizing that , because of the poor decision of their parents , they will live worse lifes than them , and they will also have to pay more for their support , so yea , between the youth there is an increasing tension . 
  another factor that i think will increase it is that , with an increasingly aging population , conservative parties that defend pensions will get more votes . 
  all that while our parents thing that we are a bunch of lazys that dont work hard enough . 
  yea , it is true , same happens with spanish , easy to get into , for real , phonetic language , easy to understand rules , easy passive form . 
  then you get to all the conjugation forms and etc and shit your pants . 
  i mean , im from a zone that is often mocked for being unable to use the verbs correctly because the influence of galician . 
  really ? 
  i can `` speak '' some italian ( have family in swizterland ) and is waaay easier than english . 
  you are gon na have a hard time with this , every country has a shitton of regional dishes , and europe is quite big . 
  the only girl i ever met that studied an enginery never faced any sexism , save for a bit of attention from undesirable guys ( [ you know which ones ] ( https://secure.static.tumblr.com/d004251fde456c88ebcd3a9aeba992eb/eikcaq0/g4en3cpz1/tumblr_static_5012689__6f67e31c52471863af16582fedf6cfa2.jpg ) ) . 
  or that is what i 've been told by her , as we discussed this topic a few times , were close friends . of course it could have been an exception , or be a cultural thing about my country ( spain , since the 60 has been accepting the cultural changes that comes with progress really fast [ although seeing the preacher with a few parishioners chasing the topless tourists had its charm i guess . ] ), 
  if you ask me , i think the main factor is it being drilled in the head of the women the `` chase your dreams '' , `` you can be anything you want '' , dealing with machines 8 hours a day is just so unromantic . 
  while men are more likely to try to choose a comfortable , good paying job . 
  on the other hand , i cant think about any woman dominated profesion here , there is a lot of male teachers , male nurses ... 
  but if you go in any of the fashion related fields ( like hairdressing ) , people might think youre gay . 
  he sold telecinco long ago , if im not mistaken . 
  good sub . 
  full of swedes but could be worse . 
  i mean , what can you expect from the 4 , 5 guys in spain who speak english ? 
  its the worst turism page ever . 
  with what army will they defend their sovereignty ?
