94kg of cheese in the car , take one down , pass it around, 
  a snapping turtle . 
  how scary . 
  what was this ? 
  oh , right . 
  a sea turtle . 
  exactly the same identical animal . 
  idk , ask [ the passenger pigeon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/passenger_pigeon ) . 
  but we 're not stealing you !, 
  where would we hide you , anyway ? 
  in italy ? 
  it 's a boot , not a chest . 
  we 'd work better together . 
  we 're already sharing water , firefighters , and a love of cod .

  where do you think ikea got all that wood from , uh ? 
  as long as they 're not in the news all the time i just do n't care . 
  another vote for our new iberia !, 
  came here to say this . 
  it looks wonderful but the meseta is very wrong . 
  i live there and , trust me , no mountains here . 
  it also places madrid in a valley surrounded left and right by mountains when that 's not the case . 
  the sistema central lie north to north-west of madrid . 
  in / u/metalpotato 's map it 'd be roughly on the c of central . 
  it does look amazing but that mistake is very jarring when you know the area . 
  yeah it was . 
  they found that little dog and took that picture so that it 'd be adopted . 
  you know twitter and people went `` yeah , i 'd adopt the dog and the cops too , yum ! '', 
  and that 's why the twitter from the police replied : `` girls and gays : it 's the dog the one up for adoption '', 
  never forget : https://twitter.com/policia/status/575797622985916416 eta : i thought it 'd link to a big pic . 
  it does n't https://pbs.twimg.com/media/b_wh4ooxaamqta6.jpg, 
  wow , that 's a huge problem . 
  no wonder they are returning , mind you , but yeah , i can see how it 'd be on the news all day . 
  spanish police are chosen for their strength and quick wits . 
  you too ? 
  i thought it was only in spain ( and venezuela ) . 
  considering how they butchered ellaria and everthing else ... it might have been for th best . 
  the * wrong * got flag . 
  dorne is spain , not the stormlands . 
  stannis the mannis , lobster king , is great but out prince is doran and our heir arianne . 
  not bourbons ; carlists . 
  read that wiki page : they are the worst . 
  spain is there , you just missed it . 
  more like red lobsters , imo . 
  long live stannis , lobster king !, 
  i did say terrors . 
  i liked it better when i thought it was r'hllor ( for some reason ) rather than the carlists or ultra-catholic people . 
  the night is dark and full of terrors . 
  you were right in the meaning of the term `` extrajudicial execution '' . 
  [ i explained it here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6m6eab/dozens_of_people_were_executed_in_chechnya_on/djzd7oe/ ) . 
  it 's not splitting hairs when you are correcting someone else but it turns out you are wrong, 
  not according [ to wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extrajudicial_killing ) and the [ us congress ] ( https://books.google.es/books?id=hcyk7x_sqhic&amp;pg=pa7897&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ) . 
  ( third column , second paragraph ) . 
   this law establishes civil liability for wrongful death against any person `` who , under actual or aparent authority , or color of law , of any foreign nation ... subjects an individual to extrajudicial killing '', 
  learn english . 
  it 's not as trashy as insulting any culture you do n't like . 
  all without knowing that words have meanings . 
  go buy the sun and hate stuff or whatever you do for fun . 
  looool as i said earlier , there are reasons not to like it . 
  i will explain : trashiness is a class issue . 
  when 90 % of a population does something you may approve or not but it ca n't be trashy . 
  it covers the very poor of a country to the middle class to the royals . 
  hate it all you like , nobody cares , it wo n't change . 
  it 's not trashy . 
  yeah , i 've lived there for a while , but i 'm not from there . 
  locals avoid that place and claim it 's no good . 
  i have n't been there myself so i ca n't say either way . 
  he probably meant that , that there are better places . 
  i 'm sure it was probably good , though . 
  others say `` go to jose maria instead '' but i 've also heard that one 's no good either . 
  i do n't care . 
  cochinillo is cochinillo . 
  you have no idea of what trashy means , do you ? 
  it 's not `` people doing what i do n't approve of '' . 
  everyone in spain pierces baby girl earrings . 
  there are reasons not to like it but to say it 's trashy is just ignorant . 
  i have no idea , i 've only been here this year . 
  it 's so worth the chill !, 
  there are no earthquakes in this area of spain and it 's not terribly windy . 
  maybe the picture misrepresents the huge size of those blocks . 
  you should visit if you get the chance . 
  it looks amazing in the snow . 
  and you must have visited in one of the two or three snow days we 've had this year . 
  not in this one . 
  fuck you . 
  first line and you insult me ? 
  i wo n't read the rest . 
  you are a disgusting being who is ignorant and probably still believes downloading movies for free is cool . 
  go cry in a corner about why you ca n't read for free anymore . 
  do n't leave your town then if you are drunk , loud and violent . 
  learn to behave in society first . 
  went to a catholic school . 
  was taught about darwin ( and lamarck ),
