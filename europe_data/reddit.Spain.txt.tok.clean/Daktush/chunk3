  i 'm in no way affiliated with scc . 
  however many secessionists will do anything they can to brand me a fascist and be able to dismiss my arguments . 
  quite frankly i do think they have been indoctrinated with this idea that there is an [ `` anti-pueblo '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe56ru35kfw ) which they need to face against and anyone that does n't is automatically part of it ( therefore their enemy ) link in spanish, 
  i do n't know which circles you move yourself in but for me the pattern is clear, 
  collons quina ignorancia de com funcionen les coses do n't take it from me , take it from them .

  are there hats ? 
  that is like you trying to debate me on : are there hats ? 
  what i wrote are facts , not opinions . 
  my bad then , i meant gov media . 
  should have either clarified or put `` most '' in front . 
  where the hell did i say that all pro-independence supporters are evil ? 
  i do n't believe in systematic `` evil '' , i do n't believe that the people that created the worst hells on earth were evil nor stupid . 
  i believe they were good , smart and capable men that did what they thought was necessary but saw the world through tinted glasses . 
  i will reiterate here , the men that landed the polish side of my family in concentration camps and on lists to take them to siberia were not stupid and they certainly were n't evil . 
  i do believe they had good intentions , but the road to hell is paved with them . 
  `` there is only one good , knowledge , and there is only one evil , ignorance '' - socrates, 
  my language my culture but not `` my desire of emancipation '' . 
  being catalan = / = being secessionist, 
  negative . 
  all are facts . 
  i do not base what i write about catalan independence on something as feeble as my feelings . 
  let 's break down my comment , shall we ? 
  - it is true that the only region that pays more than it recieves from the state is barcelona . 
  there is no arguing there , numbers show it . 
  - it is true that state taxes are the same across the whole of spain . 
  the government does not have a `` catalonia '' tax . 
  the state just limits itself in recieving certain taxes ( such as the irpf ) which are the same for everyone . 
  you are not `` exploited '' because you are catalan by the central authorities . 
  you are inbetween the most taxed individuals in spain but that is because catalonia 's government puts that additional tax burden on you . 
  again , written , objective , non opinionated . 
  - `` we have 20 % of the spanish gdp and have 15 % of the population , in a true socialist country we would have a deficit of 25 % of our state taxes ( we would pay 20 % total and recieve 15 % ) . 
  currently our deficit ranges between 4 and 10 % depending on who and how it is calculated with the true figure being around 7 % '' non opinionated , the highest estimates are 11 % by the generalitat themselves ( which for some reason think we should not contribute to expenses such as the army ) - `` the region of madrid 's deficit is 250 % the size of catalonias '' non opinionated , it 's true - if we secede we would lose access to state-wide government institutions that would cost us a lot more than that 7 % of state taxes to build and maintain since they are just a lot more efficient when operating at scale . 
  - if we secede we will be auto-kicked out of eu ( to give you an idea of what this means the day after the brexit vote uk lost 15 % of it 's pound value and therefore total purchasing power of foreign goods . 
  7 % of state taxes is minuscule compared to 15 % of the whole economies purchasing power , and that happened to england after what was basically a non-legally binding opinion poll ) . 
  there is also a great possibility we will be blocked from entering back again into it , so we will have no say while still being in the eu zone which means adhering to all regulations . 
  again , no subjective statements , all these numbers and assertions are true - `` our biggest trading partner is spain , by far . 
  we export more to the small county of aragon ( 1.3 m people ) to our west than to the whole of france . '', 
  fact , again , non opinionated - `` every relevant country that has ever spoken about catalan secessionism has spoken against it . '', 
  maybe the only subjective thing in here , later will link to statements of foreign countries and you decide - `` we as catalans have government powers in all matters of state . 
  healthcare , education , police you fucking name it , we self govern . 
  we have more autonomy in some matters than us states for god 's sake , and we are talking about a territory which has a smaller population than new york city and yet is opening embassies and consulates abroad ( which do not work and only cost us tax money ) '' all true - `` we are even allowed to discriminate against ethnic spaniards by not providing their children with a public education system in spanish !, 
  we are the only region in the world that does n't provide an education system in one of their official majority languages !, 
  ( spanish native speakers are more numerous than catalan ones and the studies are clear , not having access to education in their language means they will do worse in life than normal , just as anyone would if they were forced to study in a foreign , minority language ) . 
  to be perfectly clear that last part is both despicable and unconstitunional . 
  it causes us to have one of the worst education systems in the country but you will never see a secessionist condemn it '' all . 
  true - `` our region is one of the most corrupt in spain and is one of the most corrupt in europe according to a report by the imf . 
  politicians want to escape spanish regulatory bodies by going through with their `` independence '' , our most prominent leaders of secession have been corrupt . '', 
  you ever seen our local police take away a politician in handcuffs ? 
  because i have n't - `` our media is heavily politicised and will demonize groups that spring up against secession , if it even covers them . 
  ask any secessionist what they think about `` ciutadans '' or `` upyd '' , they will say `` nazis '' without pointing at any of their policies . 
  `` convivencia civica catalana '' a european prize-winning society of catalans against secession published a report which showed government demonizing them in their own public media and funding writers that wrote they were linked to isis . 
  this happens to all anti-secessionist movements . 
  since the spaniards are enemies in the eyes of secessionists the person that does not want secession is a `` fatxa '' ( fascist ) , our own president referred to me as a `` collaborator '' and to my parents as `` collonists '' , most importantly , if you want to be a good catalan , you need to hate the spanish . '', 
  this is true as well , i guess you are a secessionist , what do you think about ciutadans and upyd ? 
  if we secede catalonia auto breaks off from eu . 
  my degrees are in economics , finance and i have a masters in international management if you are wondering, 
  how about someone that understands quite a bit about it ? 
  [ here 's a comment of mine with some facts for you to chew through ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/513d33/spain_to_request_return_of_aryan_visigoth/d79iu1d?context=1 ), 
  ol\u00e9, 
  really pissess me off secessionists try to equate being catalan together with supporting the break off from spain . 
  their mentality is that spaniards are catalonia 's enemies , and if you support them you are n't catalan . 
  you might live here , you might have been born and raised here , but if you do n't hate the spanish you are n't a `` true '' catalan . 
  our own president called catalans against independence `` collonists '' and `` collaborators '', 
  comparing canada to the uk in terms of eu trade lol comparing canada with uk in terms of housing and movement of eu citizens ( lol ) uk has over 1.3 m expats in eu . 
  around 2m eu citizens are in your labor market ( ~ 7 % of figure ) . 
  it also relies much more on financial markets ( them being around 20 % of uk gpp ) , movement of goods is one thing but movement of capital is another . 
  compare your future uk to norway instead https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norway%e2%80%93european_union_relations it 's also funny that someone from the movement that famously said `` we have had enough of the opinions of experts '' is trying to link me a study that advocates for the uk staying in and passing it off as an argument for leaving . 
  `` the uk would seek a negotiated bilateral agreement , like canada has , the costs to britain are clear . 
  based on the treasury 's estimates , our gdp would be 6.2 % lower '' so not forfeiting access to the single market . 
  all countries that want access still need to comply with eu regulations and pay into its costs congratulations , you just made yourself poorer while achieving none of your goals !, 
  ---------------------------- `` this analysis shows a vote to remain is therefore the best way to ensure the continued growth of the uk economy and future prosperity for this and future generations . 
  britain is stronger , safer and better off in the eu . 
  i hope that armed with these facts , the people of britain will feel better informed and able to make this historic choice with confidence '', 
  link me worst case scenario , i seriously doubt it even considers leaving eu economic area, 
  opportunity costs : if you have two choices : getting 1 pound or getting 2 and you choose getting 1 , you did not in fact earn 1 pound , you lost 1 ( since you gave up the opportunity to have 2 ) if you say we would be richer than today but 4000 less than if we stayed in the eu in 15 years that does n't mean you will get richer by leaving eu , that means you will be poorer . 
  adjust it for currency movements and inflation and the picture is probably worse, 
  just this for me justifies a second referendum . 
  democracy relies on the voters being well informed , false promises go against the very foundation of it . 
  oh wait so you did n't take opportunity costs into account ? 
  of course over 15 years nomical gdp is going to increase like it does everywhere . 
  you need to compare it to what would happen if you stayed in you dum dum . 
  also , is that ppp/inflation adjusted ? 
  cause i bet its not, 
  yet he went around in a bus that advertised 350m more for the nhs per week, 
  london is the biggest financial centre for all eu and eu is too big of a trading partner with uk . 
  the day after the non-legally binding opinion poll that was marketted as a referendum the pound lost 15 % of its value . 
  the whole uk economy lost 15 % of its purchasing power of goods made abroad because of an opinion poll . 
  [ the pound has n't recovered from that ] ( https://snag.gy/nrfbvj.jpg ), 
  did n't farage inmediately backpedal on that promise ? 
  i never understood this brexit thing , if they do n't leave the eu economic area they will have to comply with all eu regulations . 
  this means less control over inmigration not more and still paying into the eu without any real say over its policies . 
  i wonder what the referendum results would have looked like if the ballot actually said what they were voting for . 
  a. i wan na stay in eu b. i want to leave eu political union but remain in eu economic one . 
  this will cause scotland , possibly northern ireland and gibraltar to break off the uk and the rest of the kingdom having less control over immigration , still having pay into eu coffers and giving up it 's say in negotiating policies . 
  this will also mean that if the uk leaves and rejoins it will lose the special status it enjoys in the eu right now . 
  c. i want to leave eu . 
  i want to leave the eu economic zone and lose access to the single market commiting economic suicide . 
  in other news grass still green and water still wet, 
  spanish responses ( using english not british since it 's hardly used here ) why do british drive on their left ?
