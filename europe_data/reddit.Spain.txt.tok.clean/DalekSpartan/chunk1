can humanity please go back to sanity ? 
  refering to the title . 
  you should feel bad about posting your propaganda here . 
  what i meant is that i normally support russia in international waters operations , even understand that they do so because of all the missile launchers the nato is placing on their frontiers . 
  but one thing is to make a show-off and other one is invading other countrie 's waters . 
  windows 10, 
  i just said i 'm sick of this ... what the fuck did people understand ? 
  catalonia is spain , and there are military bases there . 
  this is probably just an ordinary operation . 
  so i normally support russia in this matters , but now this is getting obnoxious ... 
  you can ally with all of the nationalist parties in spain and the republicans , that 'd make enough people to change it . 
  and you voted them to do so because you were brainwashed by other governments since the transition ( thanks , franco \u00ac \u00ac ), 
  + change the constitution , then change the estatut . 
  - improve freedom , live in harmony with the rest of the country - make a law so you can vote whether to stay or not + use the official organisms to ask the people what they want . 
  the tribunal constitucional is blocking you because the question regards the independence , they could ask people if they like potatos instead , for example . 
  that would n't be illegal . 
  it would n't be either to ask them if they like things like they are right now , if they want them to change or if they want `` other solutions '' ( without specifying ) . 
  - if the answer is to change things , do n't start asking every 5 years , at some point people might be upset enough , and the movement could 've been promoted enough for the sepparatists to secede . 
  - if the answer is to secede , start asking for national & international support , noone is impeding you to secede if you do it the legal way ( changing the constitution ) . 
  you should understand aswell that the sovereignity of the spanish territories reside on ** all ** of the people , not just the ones who live in a region . 
  you can change that , but just with the aproval of the majority of the spaniards . 
  even catalonia has independentist movements of its own . 
  japan ? 
  australia ? 
  western australia . 
  new zealand ? 
  maori people , south island . 
  i do n't underestimate anything , i know your government has been inlaying the independentist shit since the transition , but that does n't change a thing about the law and the potential consecuences . 
  changing the constitution to allow you to change the estatut . 
  i 'm done with reddit . 
  yesterday it was necrophilia , today it is porn about cementeries ... 
  i do n't want to know what 's tomorrow, 
  the law allows independence by other ways , it 's just that mas wants to win the next elections and has to look like he 's doing something . 
  almost all the countries of the world have separatsist regions , none of them would want to give traitors something to feed on ... 
  it being funny, 
  - suck it sweden !!!, 
  - flair says : `` not sweden '', 
  you do n't stop to amaze me , / r/europe . 
  americans are n't so wrong about european society , after all ... 
  you tell me that when london is a third world country itself because some asshole wanted to have more power . 
  it 's not madrid shutting them up , it 's the ** whole . 
  country . 
  ** they do n't want to be here ? 
  okay , they can leave , box their shit and go to andorra or france to see how better they treat `` catalonians '' . 
  if you do not respect the law , no matter what conditions , you are not trustworthy to respect any law . 
  and again , you 're actually not comparing the english colonialism and appartheid with a secessionist territory that has never been independent in written history , are you ? 
  so you do n't mind if i support scotland too , right ? 
  after all , the no won by a little tiny bit ... and what 's that `` oppresive spanish regime '' that wo n't allow self-determination ? 
  i think you 're stuck in the 60 's ... of course they have the right of self determination , it 's just that mas wants to do it the wrong way : the fastest one . 
  why ? 
  because he wants voters , that 's all politicians want , especially those who want more power . 
  voters . 
  you are actually , seriously , comparing the constitutional tribunal and the whole parliament with a dictatorship ? 
  dude , i 'm not saying you 're stupid but you 're apparently trying so hard . 
  keep thinking that , keep blaming the ones who ensure the legality of the actions taken by those who just want more power and money , because it 's never enough . 
  you can change the constitution , it 's been said over and over and over and over again , but you still think `` espanya ens roba '' . 
  smaller ? 
  by one ? 
  okay , then . 
  then all of the constitutions of all the countries around the world are crimes ? 
  countries are designed to last , it does n't take a genious to know it . 
  thing is , they are not . 
  and they do n't even know if all of catalonia is either . 
  they can change things legally but do n't want to . 
  why ? 
  because mas would love to be able to have all of the power . 
  looking for epic atheist-religious battle in the comments ... 
  surprisingly not found !, 
  so basically catalonians are trusting a government who do n't just try to avoid law , but publically incites to break it ... 
  they are trusting those politicians to make a constitution ... to give the people the power ... 
  i really do n't want to say it , but i see a civil war incoming and i do n't like it . 
  he stole ideas , sank entire families into missery because he wanted to scam people , never donated a shit to anyone , became one of the richest man in the world and used child labor in underdeveloped countries . 
  he did ** not ** invent touchscreen , he did ** not ** invent windows-based guis , he did ** not ** invent anything , he just used copyrighted ideas and sued the real creators for millions , putting them in bankrupt . 
  touchscreen devices worked nicely and were affordable , even were becoming popular in the market waaay before he `` created '' his products . 
  to become a monopoly is ** not ** by any means inject competition in the market . 
  he did nothing for the world in exchange for what he received . 
  cancer was the less he should have had . 
  jobs was gay aswell . 
  and an asshole . 
  and a despicable `` human being '' . 
  i do n't even know why there was a memorial to steve jobs in the first place . 
  my point stands . 
  no , what i meant was behavior , not opinions . 
  i know the diference . 
  behaviors no one asked for either . 
  so much double standards , i feel you bro < 3, 
  you . 
  here . 
  this . 
  but it 's not socialism , it 's communism . 
  even worse . 
  nonononononono for fucks sake nooooooooo, 
  hey , i 've been saying this for a few months now in this sub ( years irl ) , people just kept downvoting me cuz they do n't want war to be declared . 
  who 's the pussy ? 
  so / r/europe , can you finally recognise this is the cold war ii ? 
  and can i say that i do n't want spain to be in the nato anymore ? 
  it 's actually 1152 years old , and please , do n't ever go to / r/history and say that the formation of a 60 year old country is not history . 
  by the way , ` murica still has n't paid its debt with spain and france since the independence war ... now it 's almost twice the whole country 's gdp . 
  read the books , they are interesting , entertaining and great , but have some really racist references . 
  including your computer , your tv , the router , your smartphone ... ?
