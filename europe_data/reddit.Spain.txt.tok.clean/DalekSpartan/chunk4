  just because it ** is taught ** in schools along with spanish , you ca n't say spain is n't giving a fuck for it !, 
  the constitution itself protects with special care those languages !, 
  spain is dependant on catalonia because it 's got the second most populated city in spain . 
  and wonder what ? 
  by bashing on spain publically on international websites you 're hurting the tourism and inversions on it , you 're hurting your country !, 
  nobody does that in a larger scale than spain . 
  it was changed with minor things because nothing else was proposed . 
  those parts are as easy to change as anything else . 
  once the constitution is being changed , every aspect of it can be changed . 
  as i said over and over and over again , ally with republicans and socialists , and you 'll have 80 % of the congress and spain itself . 
  you do n't need the central government to do a shit , remember 15m ? 
  that did something . 
  just if all the angry people united like that , you 'd not need anyone else to agree . 
  and again , as i said , you never tried . 
  wait until the 2015 elections and we 'll see how many are still voting pp . 
  i 'm being bombarded with replies since i wrote that comment . 
  i 'm sorry if i do n't look at your flair . 
  it requires 1/2 , and once the psoe opens the dialogue to change the constitution , then you can do what you want . 
  plus podemos is most likely going to try to make spain a republic again . 
  all of that requires to change the constitution . 
  that 's like saying i should thank my local supermarket for supplying me food instead of all the system ( hunters , fishermen , transporters , manufacturers , quality control , supermarket staff ... ) it 's not the basque government who created the free healthcare & educative system . 
  without the help of spain you 'd be like mexico , argentina , cuba ... do they have those privileges ? 
  you could consider spain was created in 1469 , 1516 , 1715 , 1812 , 1931 or 1978 . 
  was n't spain called spain in the francoist regime ? 
  before the first republic ? 
  it 's been called spain since the xvi century . 
  you 're not considering one thing , monarchy does n't mean today what meant 3 centuries ago . 
  and there were soldiers back then , fighting for their flag and their kings . 
  is n't that nationalism ? 
  a peasant living in la mancha in 1750 was more grateful to his country than you will ever be . 
  i have a french uncle . 
  nice guy . 
  thing is , he was son of spainards and was borned in spain ... 
  but yeah , 1808 was dirty as hell . 
  i want a referendum about that . 
  i do n't want spain to be member of a self destructive organization . 
  it 's not about being a federal country , it 's about reforming the constitution . 
  once the debate is up , you can vote and complain and demand change . 
  it 's not about being receptive either , it 's not about people or political parties , it 's all about law and those who make it accomplish . 
  you are not majority to convoke a referendum on a constitution change and you are not even trying to do so . 
  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bldq961igaabsqg.jpg:large you have to be very stupid to think it ca n't be done because your current government tells you so . 
  it has been done , it can be done , it is legal , it is factible , you just want to cling to a burning nail . 
  it refuses to the referendum on the independence of catalonia , not the constitution change itself . 
  do n't you see it ? 
  they 're not denying you to vote , they 're denying you to do so inconstitutionally !, 
  as they should !, 
  changing the constitution means you can change everything democratically , there 's no difference on the requirements to change the first article or the second . 
  `` they are n't , they wo n't , they do n't want to ... '' but you never asked them . 
  you 're basing that on suppositions and you know it . 
  there 's no need all the political parties agree , the only thing that matters is how many ministers and spainards agree . 
  let 's not talk about ibarretxe and the inconstitutionality of his plan . 
  he did n't try to change the constitution , either , he just tried to change the statute . 
  you 're both catalonians and basques whining about the government not letting you decide and arguing everything you try to do madrid just declares it illegal , but never tried to change the constitution itself . 
  so you 're telling me you never studied in a public school ? 
  never went to the hospital ? 
  you have to thank your parents and you , but spain aswell . 
  not in every country you fall sick and you do n't have to pay a shit to get treatment . 
  the * deshauciados * were expulsed from their houses by the banks , not the state . 
  there have been attempts to do something , but that 's the thing with democracies , majority has to agree . 
  and by the way , that 's not patriotism . 
  patriotism is not related to society , politics or economy . 
  that 's comlpetely other topic . 
  please , tell me you 're just trolling here . 
  please tell me you did n't just go full retard ... 
  well , it 's just true you wo n't find ** anyone ** outside the separatist comunities who wants you to become independent . 
  you ca n't just deny it . 
  let me get this clear : every . 
  single . 
  party . 
  knows independence is bad . 
  that does n't make me nationalist , that makes me realist . 
  by the way , the fact you 're saying catalonia is a colony makes me think you left the school when you were 10 years old . 
  aragon joined castile and formed spain . 
  if you say catalonia is a colony , you 're saying madrid is a colony aswell . 
  you just do n't understand the meaning of colony . 
  it 's not about motherland , it 's not about empires , it 's not about queens or kings , it 's about fucking forty seven million people up because some assholes got into the classrooms and taught an entire generation that what you needed was independence . 
  so do n't try to invalidate what i say because you think i 'm one of those `` spain holy motherland '' guys . 
  i 'm realistic , this is going to fuck so many people up and the only thing all of spain is trying to do is opening your fucking eyes . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ sigh ... 
  it is possible to change the constitution . 
  it was changed in 1992 and 2011 . 
  you just want to think you ca n't . 
  read the rest of the conversation , i 'm not writing that up again . 
  want to change it ? 
  do it . 
  but once you do it , shut up please , and try to make this country a better place instead of wasting everyone 's time on stupid independentist movements . 
  change things once for all , move on . 
  i 'm not denying the constitution is not all the democratic it could be , but as i said , you ** can ** change it . 
  just ally with the republicans to demand a referendum on a constitutional reform instead of demanding a referendum on your separate interests . 
  psoe wants to make spain a federal country , that requires to change the constitution . 
  plus as i said , if you united with republicans you 'd get what you want . 
  what makes a country independent is other countries recognizing it as independent . 
  and if you think the constitution is a piece of paper , what about the articles that keep people from entering your house and murdering al your family ? 
  becuase that 's what laws are for , and the constitution is the maximum law . 
  if you do n't respect the constitution , you could aswell not respect the human rights declaration . 
  would you trust a government who do n't follow the laws and do as it please ? 
  i do n't mean that , what i mean is that catalonia is n't going anywhere , but if he wants to renounce to his nationality , he 'll lose all those rights , at least if he does n't get an eu nationality . 
  because spain has allies , because a lot of countries have independentist movements and they do n't want them to happen . 
  do you think anyone will support catalonia ? 
  usa has separatist movements , france has separatist movements , canada has separatist movements , united kingdom has separatist movements , finland has separatist movements , italy has separatist movements .
