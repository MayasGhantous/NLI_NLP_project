  germany has separatist movements , russia has separatist movements ... 
  they just wo n't feed them . 
  the eu 's economy will be hurt if catalonia secedes , not to talk about catalonian one ... wonder what ? 
  it is illegal . 
  you can change it and make it legal but nooooo you want to make it the stupid way ... you do n't have anything ? 
  your education , the fact you speak english , your house , your job , your life insurance , the fact you can even talk in reddit . 
  you have a lot , you do n't want to see it but you do . 
  if you 're that ungrateful , you can just leave and do it your way . 
  when did i claim i was ? 
  you 're the only nationalist here , i 'm socialist . 
  nice , change the constitution if you do n't like it , and what makes you think those who abstained would have voted no ? 
  it 's the first article of the constitution , you can keep thinking it does n't mean anything , but it changes nothing . 
  if the majority of catalonians want to be independent , they can . 
  the thing is , constitution does n't allow them to vote for it . 
  why do they want to be independent ? 
  because they feel oppressed . 
  why do they feel oppressed ? 
  because they ca n't change laws . 
  why ca n't they change laws ? 
  because of the constitution . 
  if they want to leave , they have to change the constitution . 
  if they can change the constitution , why not to change laws instead ? 
  * facepalm * for the black thingy . 
  if you think spain is alone , you clearly do n't know how many allies it has . 
  just to mention : eu , nato , uno , countries with separatist movements about to explode ... 
  they can if they want to . 
  how do you convoke a referendum ? 
  well , ask artur mas . 
  thing is , catalonia is just one autonomic comunity , there are seventeen . 
  of course it is relatively irrelevant , that 's called democracy , where the majority decides what to do . 
  think about it this way : 4 million people want to change the constitution to do one thing , while 43 million do n't want that thing to ocurr . 
  20 million people want to change the constitution to do other thing , while 27 million do n't want that thing to ocurr . 
  now , what happens if those 20 million people who want to change the constitution to do one thing and those 4 million people who want to do so to change other thing united ? 
  that 'd be 24 million against 23 million . 
  convoke a referendum for independence and you wo n't get it . 
  convoke a referendum for republic and you wo n't get it . 
  now , convoke a referendum to change the constitution and ** then ** , you will be able to do both things . 
  3 months old puerto rican reunification movement . 
  do n't expect much , it is n't well known at the moment . 
  https://www.facebook.com/reunificacionpuertorico i 'm sorry , i comment from my mailbox and do n't see the flairs , plus look at this thread , it 's full of people replying to me every minute . 
  and i see you did n't get the sarcasm . 
  my comment was n't ultranationalist at all , your idea of ultranationalism is far from reality . 
  it was also changed in 1992 , what demonstrates you can change it . 
  why do n't you ? 
  why do you want to do things wrong when you can do them right ? 
  whenever you change the constitution , you can change * everything * on spain ( remove the king , make the country a confederation , adopt the switzerland 's voting system , force everyone to speak catalonian ... ) you can do it , you have demonstrated there 's enough people wanting to change things . 
  do it the right way . 
  the constitution does n't prohibit to change itself , just the separation and encouragement to do so . 
  i 've been receiving a lot of messages , so i do n't know if you read it , but as i said , there are 47 million people in spain . 
  imagine 20 of those are republicans and 13 of the remaining just want to change things . 
  20 against 27 is not enough to change things . 
  13 against 34 is not enough to change things . 
  however , 33 against 14 is enough to change things . 
  convoke a referendum to change the constitution instead of the estatut or the independence , that is legal , everybody is encouraging you to do so , they just do n't want you to separate . 
  and by the way , not every single country accepts the same parts of the declaration of human rights , see usa . 
  and the generalitat is n't ? 
  i know of pujol , but i do n't know of any corruption case there . 
  oh , are you the ultimate basque representative ? 
  the constitution was signed by everyone , and everyone accepted to follow it as the maximum law . 
  the sovereignity of the spanish nation belongs to all of spainards , not just some . 
  they do n't own catalonia , all spain does . 
  they can independize their houses , but not what all spain has worked to build and develop throughout the centuries . 
  and ? 
  what 's your point ? 
  they-have-not-tried-to-change-the-constitution . 
  is it clear enough to understand ? 
  it 's like trying to climb a wall with spikes when the door is open . 
  they do not have the right do do so because the constitution of spain says otherwise . 
  this is not any of those american shows . 
  this is not the usa , and i thank god it is n't . 
  yeah , they have not changed it since its creation , allowing kids to have guns and commig mass murders in schools , allowing people to be executed , being a christian state where religion rules everything ... as i said , thank god this is ** not ** the fucking usa . 
  thing is , they are not a nation and they have no right to do it . 
  they signed a constitution and accepted to follow it , they even got ** more ** rights than the rest of the spainards because of their language . 
  is that fair ? 
  that they get more than the rest of spainards and yet they keep whining about it ? 
  oh , so now i can say i 'm black because i chose to be called black ? 
  does that change the colour of my skin ? 
  plus i 'm not calling all catalonians independentists , i 'm saying independentists are and always will be catalonians and spainards , because catalonia isnt ' going anywhere . 
  you are catalonian and spainard . 
  i 'm not telling you what to be , i 'm telling you what you are . 
  puerto rican reunification movement by jos\u00e9 nieves seize , founded a few months ago . 
  cuban reunification movement by ferr\u00e1n nu\u00f1ez . 
  la sexta es de socialistas , tve de populares y tv3 de independentistas . 
  fuck off , you too . 
  he 'll be whatever he is , and unless he wants to renounce to the free health care , the free education , his pension , his life insurance , the emergency services and everything else , he is an spainard . 
  he will never have catalonian nationality because noone will recognize catalonia as such . 
  oh how not , another independentist ... 
  this country has given you a lot and this is the way you thank for it ... 
  i 'm leftist . 
  you are a spainard unless the uno says otherwise . 
  there are reunification movements that have not reached the classrooms and tv yet , unlike in catalonia . 
  wait , there 's a word for that ? 
  adoctrination ? 
  that sounds bad , does n't it ? 
  i have no issue but its inconstitutionalness . 
  they want to leave because they think they 're being oppressed , they can change things legally , but they do n't want to . 
  that 's why i 'm against an illegal referendum , they can even make it legal by changing the constitution . 
  our law is more recent than most countries in the world . 
  see the usa , not changing it since its creation and they are the first world power . 
  because it 's not about political views , it 's about the integrity of the country .
