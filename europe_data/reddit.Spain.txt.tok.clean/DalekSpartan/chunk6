  republicans , communists , socialists , fascists , anarchists , francoists , monarchists ... everybody knows this will just hurt both sides , the economy is enough fucked up right now for you to make it worse . 
  people care about getting to the end of the month , you care about not being able to use catalonian in official topics , when half a billion people speak spanish as a native language in the world . 
  you want to leave , they want to change things . 
  you can leave , what you will not do is to fuck everybody because you 're being `` oppressed '' so much that you do n't see the constitutional way to solve your problems . 
  let 's say 60 % of catalonians want independence . 
  that 's 3 fucking million people , that 's ** a lot ** human rights you say ? 
  you do really think any country in the world thinks those are over everything ? 
  look at the usa , bombarding schools with innocent kids inside because they want oil , and the only way to get it is to say there are terrorists hidden there . 
  they also bombarded hiroshima and nagasaki , erased them from the map . 
  germany was forced to disarm and pay a huge indemnization after the war , why was n't the usa ? 
  human rights depend on the country , too . 
  which way you want to be ? 
  the enemies or the allies of those who control the world ? 
  it 's not about political views , it 's about the integrity of the country . 
  and trust me , noone outside of catalonia or pais vasco wants the independence of any of its parts . 
  why ? 
  because the economy is enough fucked up and you will make it even worse . 
  republicans , communists , fascists , francoists , monarchists , falangists , anarchists ... ** everybody ** knows it 's bad for everyone . 
  you want to go , you can do it . 
  you just will not take what belongs to the spanish people . 
  as i said , change the constitution , then you will be able to vote . 
  there were kids in those manifestations , is it right for them to be adoctrinated ? 
  is it right that their fathers teach them to think so because they have been tricked ? 
  what if the independence won by a 60 % ? 
  that 's 3 million people never wanted to leave . 
  it 's still ** a lot ** . 
  tell that to every single nation in the world . 
  human rights are violated every single day , it 's not like an international law that must be followed , think on the usa , bombarding schools with innocent kids inside because they want oil and the only way to get it is saying there is a terrorist there . 
  they bombarded hiroshima and nagasaki and were never forced to disarm and pay a huge compensation , unlike germany . 
  this is not about ideology , this is about fucking everybody up because you 're upset catalonian is not used in official topics , when half a billion people in the world speak spanish as a native language . 
  you want to vote ? 
  change the constitution . 
  please , read something about the black legend . 
  and yes , there are countries wanting to . 
  nice catalonian ultranationalism , by the way . 
  change the constitution , then . 
  you 're being encouraged to change the things instead of taking the easy and worst way out . 
  do it , do the righ thing instead of fucking up families who just do n't give a shit about you and just want to be able to get to the end of the month . 
  well there are reunificationist movements . 
  some would shot themselves if catalonia leaves spain . 
  well if you do n't like it , change it . 
  that 's what the whole spanish nation is trying to tell you . 
  you can do it legally , why not to do it ? 
  you are a spainard too , remember that < 3, 
  the constitutional tribunal is revising the law to recurr it . 
  it was a terrible mistake considering they were the ones to end with the empire and conquer mexican territories . 
  wonder why they wanted it so much . 
  no , i 'm not going to deport them . 
  i 'm saying if they do n't like things they can just ... leave , and be happy in other country like andorra or france or sealand . 
  well the uno is controlled by the usa , so his allies are over that declaration . 
  ever wondered why they have not been punished because of their war crimes ? 
  good luck with that . 
  thing is , unionist catalonians do n't want to leave spain , unlike separatists . 
  by the same logic , 95 % of spainards would be fucked for you hurting the country . 
  remember : people on catalonia : 7 million . 
  i think not everybody wants to go to those manifestations . 
  i think your estimation is n't either . 
  yeah , but thing is you are still spainard by all meanings . 
  hurray who cares ? 
  we 're talking about a serious thing here . 
  this is no kids game . 
  well it 's not legal , therefor you must accept the consequences of such a stupid decission . 
  there 's no need for vote when there have been studies , you will ** not ** secede , and it 's not the same constitution for quebec , scotland and spain . 
  you want democracy ? 
  convoke a referendum on changing the constitution . 
  it 's as easy as that . 
  what you 're doing is convoking a referendum on secession . 
  wrong way to do it , mate . 
  wait , i 'm saying 80 % of spanish colonies are now 3rd world countries . 
  plus the secession of the empire was motivated mainly by the black legend and the recent usa and french revolutions , what a shame considering without spain the usa would n't exist . 
  ally with republicans and revolutionists , that way you 'll get it . 
  because everybody in spain but independentists know their history and know how secessions are bad for both sides . 
  we went from world 's first superpower to tiny little controlable countries with no power and just poverty . 
  you 've been asking for a secession referendum , not a constitutional referendum to reform the constitution itself . 
  imagine 4 million of spainards are secessionists , imagine 20 million of the rest are republicans and imagine other 10 million want a constitution reform . 
  that 's 34 million spainards versus 10 . 
  that referendum would be constitutional . 
  now imagine 4 million ask 43 million to change things and get nothing . 
  20 million ask 23 million to change things and get nothing . 
  10 million ask 37 million to change things and get nothing . 
  you want to change things ? 
  independentism is not the way to do it . 
  it 's not one side that is completely unwilling to make concessions , it 's all the sides but one who know it 's illegal to make them . 
  it is n't just madrid either , it 's extremadura , castilla la mancha , castilla y le\u00f3n , andaluc\u00eda , murcia , navarra , madrid , galicia , la rioja , valencia , illes balears , cantabria , asturias , canarias , arag\u00f3n and half of catalonia . 
  changing the constitution is possible , there 's a majority of spainards wanting to change it but they are just sepparated into different groups ( republicans , catalonians , basques ... ) and they fight for their different things instead of colaborating to do it . 
  talking about not pro-independence ... artur mas stated that secessionism was stupid back in 2002 . 
  the idea of independentism just benefits the generalitat , not the catalonians . 
  secessions just hurt both sides , the seceding one is the most hurt . 
  do you really trust a government that hid the pujol case for 30 fucking years ? 
  do you really trust a government that calls for civic disobedience ? 
  if they ca n't even respect the laws , how are you trusting them to make a constitution ? 
  to create a country from zero ? 
  how do you trust a government rotten to the core ? 
  whenever mas tries to change things instead of fucking everything up . 
  rajoy said it i do n't remember exactly but like 1 or 2 months ago . 
  yeah !, 
  we should erradicate those `` liberties '' . 
  they just damage the country and promote the ignorance . 
  you know what 's even sadder ? 
  a lot of young people in spain do n't know we were an empire , and learning from what they hear on the streets call fascist everything and everyone when they become older .
