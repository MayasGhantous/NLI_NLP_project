  it 's like a real life version of the movie elysium : /,

  the only religious person i ever met in my life was my 90 years old grandma who died in the 80 's . 
  other than that , i 've never met any other catholic people . 
  religion is a thing practically restricted to the elderly in rural areas ( or in southern spain ), 
  lol no , no ... it 's not spanish 's pussies but nun 's pussies xd . 
  it 's translated as a `` chochos de monja '', 
  the snails and the yellow vegetable on right are also very traditional in spain . 
  by the way everybody calls them `` nun pussies '' or just `` pussies '' in short :d, 
  i ca n't stand the spanish anthem : s. . . but hey , [ it 's laibach !!,

  yes , it was a district of the viceroyalty of new spain from 1762 to 1802 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/louisiana_%28new_spain%29, 
   on the other hand : what is spain or california without infernal temperatures that you can only survive with a swim in the ocean ... 
  this is a sunlight map , not a temperature map . 
  the winters inland spain are typically cold as fuck ( most of the country is on high altitude ) .

  none !, 
  no gods , no masters !, 
   i 'd still not be a `` real spanish '' because i do n't like jam\u00f3n . 
  what a monster !!, 
  please someone call the police !!, 
  i bet you also do n't like onions in your `` tortilla de patatas '' . . haha, 
  all of them !!, 
  pretty much all the `` spanish '' stereotypes are actually the andalusian ones ( andalusia , a region in southern spain ) and they are far from reallity outside that region . 
  mexicans vs ~ ~ spaniards ~ ~ andalusians ... ftfy !, 
  the flamenco thing is exclusively the folk music from the southern part of spain ( andalucia ) and it really has nothing to do with the rest of the country that it varies a lot from north to south and east to west . 
  for example , [ this is also `` spain '' ] ( https://i.imgur.com/45mhcxh.jpg ) . 
   spain would be perfect for growing marijuana , especially the central plains i do n't think so , they have a very harsh weather over there ( fucking cold in winter and fucking hot in summer ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/climate_of_spain#the_continentalised_mediterranean_climate probably the best place for marihuana is the south and the mediterranean coast . 
  mild weather without big variations of temperature between summer and winter .

  totalitarianism ^ 2 xd, 
   the history of the spaniards who first entered paris during wwii has to be one of the most badass and epic stories of humanity . 
  cross the pyrenees without nothing , put in concentration camps , given the opportunity to fight with the french army and ending liberating paris . 
  wow . 
  the catalan tv made a mini-series about that , tornarem ( we will be back ) : http://www.tv3.cat/tornarem/videos it 's too bad that this story and the people who helped to organize the `` french '' resistance has been almost erased :( http://libcom.org/history/articles/spanish-resistance-in-france-1939, 
  the republic was an elected democracy that was destroyed by a fascist coup d'etat and that was the spark of the civil war . 
  the modern spain and their flag is nothing more than a continuation of the francoism regime in disguise . 
  that 's why i never going to wave a spanish constitutional flag , never !, 
  what about the firefox extension [hola.org ] ( http://hola.org ) ? 
  pssshhhh ... 
  if he says is weird , is weird , period . 
  more for us :-d, 
  come to europe man , a lot of delicious food :d anyway , i has always seemed strange to me that you can not find this kind of food in the usa when in many european countries are pretty common and traditional . 
  well you know . . all those american people with roots in europe and all that , it should be normal food for them . 
  and in spain , i ate a lot of lambs heads as a kid . . nowadays perhaps is not so common, 
  this is/was pretty common in spain . 
  my mom have prepared me this plenty of times , my favourite part was the brains :-d in general i think all those dishes are pretty common in many different european countries , although the preparation can change from one country to another , of course . 
  in spain , we have among other things : snails , frog legs , head cheese , cow stomach , deep fried little birds , bull testicles , blood sausages , fried blood , fried liver , pig ( face , ears , legs . . virtually everything except the eyes ) , horse meat ( it 's apparently weird for the anglos ) oh and lamb brains . . 
  i loved it as a kid , just grilled with olive oil , vinegar and a pinch of salt . . yummy, 
  there is a fake account of the barcelona tourism office on twitter that is fucking hilarious . 
  i guess it 's managed by a group of angry neighbours tired of so many tourists :-d https://twitter.com/bcnturisme ( in english , catalan and spanish ),
