   how do you say that ? 
  like this : [ me cago en dios !!!, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsel0ag3tdy ), 
  yeah , now spreading freedom is so mainstream . . 
  i confess , i 'm guilty !, 
  offenses and outrages to spain . 
  what i said is fine with 1.001 to 30.000 $ by the new security law : http://www.publico.es/politica/485865/que-sanciona-la-nueva-ley-de-seguridad-ciudadana * - offenses or insults to spain , the autonomous regions and local authorities or institutions , symbols , emblems or hymns , ** made by any means . 
  yep !, 
  also they 've touched the mouth . . 
  and all this , with the blessing of the fascist , and ultracatholic taliban government of spain . 
  marilyn manson has been arrested by the spanish police . . 
   also you forgot to add the flag with the bull to the choices , i 've to admit it looks badass and hard to forget and has , what also pleases me a rich symbolic history . 
  that symbol is horrible , it has nothing to do with mythology . 
  it 's just an advertising of the osborne sherry company that you can find when travel by car in rural spain . 
   spain  spain ( and coasts/beaches ) lol what ? 
  xd spain has 505,992 km2 , three different climates zones and is only and coasts/beaches ? 
  that sounded pretty ignorant ... 
  i have a belgian friend and his favourite activity when he comes to visit us is enjoy the mountains and the sky resorts ( not much of that in belgium ) . 
  roman ruins , medieval castles , green forests , deserts , mountains , islands , art , gastronomie , different cultures , traditions and languages ... and a lot more but is only coast and beaches , facepalm : /, 
  the spanish police is very well known for attack innocent people : teenagers , women , elderly , journalists we all victims of these assholes . 
  there are hundreds of videos on youtube of these monkeys being a bastards motherfuckers . 
  look at this one , the subhumans beating a girl and a journalist ... http://youtu.be/9zjcguu5mte?t=1m20s, 
   wow , i did n't know that there were such large differences between the original spanish and its south american version . 
  spanish language lesson 1 , take a look to this video xd : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ljde4sler0, 
  sorry to disappoint you but the siesta thing it 's just a stupid stereotype and it 's not widely practiced by the spaniards as you may think . 
  it 's mainly restricted to retired people in rural areas , or people that had naps in their vacations but that 's it . 
  the midday break is true but is basically used for lunch and also it 's the time to pick up the children from school . 
  anyway i know many people that are against the midday break but that 's a political decision that is not going to happend . 
   can someone tell me why ? 
  due the promiscuity of the habsburg family :p https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/habsburg_spain, 
  hey roger !!, 
  i 'm taking a dump right now . 
  i 'm very grateful you spy my ass . 
  enjoy the show . . 
   spain : ( i only post this to save spanish honor in reddit , as no one has posted before i think ) that 's because we are so fucking tired and embarrassed of our shitty elites ( politicians , bankers , monarchy , businessmen , policemen , journalists ... and so on ) :(, 
  oh , perhaps because you guys have better english than the average galician , asturian , basque , andalusian ... or catalan people living in the iberian peninsula . 
   wrigley buildging a curious note : that building , and others built in those days in the us , were based in the [ giralda tower of seville ] ( https://encrypted.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=la%20giralda&amp;tbs=imgo:1 ) . 
  http://www.nyc-architecture.com/arch/arch-notes-municipal.htm ps : i really had no idea about this . 
  it 's the kind of curious things you learn on the internet :d, 
  i 've never seen one of those in real life . 
  i 'm not a politician . 
  that 's a fake , the real ones are filled with 500 $ bills :p,

  surprise !!, 
  a few days ago some portuguese guy in / r/europe was asking why many spanish people here were using the republican flag instead the `` constitutional/official '' spanish flag ... well , this is the answer . 
  shame !, 
  it 's a cool idea , do it !, 
  so do i. . 
  i had to look up the damn word :-d, 
  whops !!, 
  you got me , i come from the future . . ^ actually ^ ^ too ^ ^ much ^ ^ ^ alcohol ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ ^ weekend, 
  yeahh it 's real , it 's so embarrassing : /, 
  yes , precisely this is all about . 
  this wednesday 11th is the tercentenary of the fall of barcelona and the defeat of the archduke of austria . 
  from the wiki : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_barcelona_%281713%e2%80%931714%29  the war 's end in 1714 , with the surrender of the pro-archduke forces to a franco-spanish army , marks a two century long period of greater suppression of catalan autonomy that mirrored the greater centralization of the various monarchies of the european continent . 
  with the war of the spanish succession completed , spain evolved from a de facto unified kingdom to a centralized de jure one . 
  the defenders of the city were buried in a cemetery , now a plaza , fossar de les moreres , where catalans gather every 11 september , known as the national day of catalonia or la diada, 
  oh , but that 's completely unusual . 
  i 've seen that pay4pee thing in many central european countries but never here . 
  i guess they were collecting money for the olympics lol, 
  well , fortunatly youtube has a loop function . . 
  enjoy : s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vyv1kyjipu ps : lots of weird people on the internet, 
  oh , thanks ~ ~ god ~ ~ fsm , thank you !!, 
  that has been close ... 
   * cago 'n el cony de la reputissima mare de d\u00e9u translation ( a kind of ) : i shit in the cunt of the motherfucking whore of the virgin mary . 
  i like it , very sophisticated :-d, 
  dedicated with all my love to the monarchy and to all the political and financial class ... ** sois todos unos bastardos hijos de la gran puta !!!!, 
  ** http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3nfwo_hijo-de-puta_fun, 
  no , it 's not working . 
  no one in spain cares a fuck about gibraltar other than the spanish right-wing freaks . . 
  it 's quite simple : * ~ ~ hitler ~ ~ * ~ ~ mussolini ~ ~ * franco the job was n't finished at the end of the wwii . 
  now the franco 's grandchildren are in power and all of us , spanish and llanito people , we are suffering the consequences . 
  more precisely , the `` allies '' were the ones who left spain behind rather than the uk , but you know what i meant . . 
  hey brits !!!, 
  point your missiles to : * palacio de la moncloa ( presidential palace ) * palacio de la zarzuela ( royal palace ) * congreso de los diputados ( spanish oligarchs parliament ) thank you guys , we owe you one :-d, 
  again , the euskara is an isolated language . 
  it has no family or known relatives . 
   they are all related to finnish . 
  the euskara ( basque language ) has no known living relatives ... 
  we do our best . 
  not many people vote for them in catalonia , the problem is that the rest of spain do it : - s, 
   seems like a fairly standard distractionary measure nah , not really . 
  a couple of days ago the catalan tv news talked a little bit of this issue , but i think the spanish one it 's not talking about gibraltar at all . 
  this conflict is seen as a diplomatic business and the normal people it 's really not interested about it . 
  i do n't know , i always had fun in belgium . 
  i love that lovely country . . 
  haha yeah , a lot of catalan proverbs talk about money . 
  how can we translate `` la pela \u00e9s la pela '' to english language ? 
  something like `` money talks '' ? 
  barcelona is good if the bag sounds ( if you have money ) . 
  health and strength to purse ( health and wealth ! ), 
  * on vas , diner ? 
  where do you go , money ? 
  where there is more . 
  literally , if you pay , saint peter will sing . 
  similar to the english , `` he who pays the piper calls the tune '' . 
  do n't count your chickens until they 've hatched . 
  that 's the catalan stereotype . .
