  i usually spend from one to two weeks as a maximum , dependent how much money or time available . . 
  europe it 's bigger than only london and paris . 
  there is plenty of asians and south americans in many places around europe . 
  you need come back and travel more ;-), 
  [ requiem for spain ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knplvm0vdvo ), 
  you 've never been in europe , right ? 
  oh , do n't worry for the royal parasite . 
  the bourbon always uses a roll of toilet paper as a business card ... 
  ok , no problem mate . 
  sorry if i 've been a little bit rude ( the beer speaks for me ), 
  why so ? 
  it 's the legitime flag of spain . 
  the red and yellow one was imposed by a civil war , 40 years of fascist dictatorship and a `` failed '' coup d'etat in 1982 . 
  [ spain national anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qafewdedyxu ), 
  you 're welcome . 
  as for the flair , i 'm republican ( and an anti-clerical guy ) , but i think spain should not exist as such :-), 
  the co-prince of andorra it 's not the king of spain but the bishop of [ `` la seu d'urgell '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_catholic_diocese_of_urgell ), 
   but merkel said recently that the corruption in spain was at `` normal levels '' this is not normal at all , there are corruption at local , provincial , and national level . 
  involving politicians , judges , police , the monarchy , banks , ex-public corporations . 
  all of them stealing and doing bussines with the chinese and russian mafia and terrorist states like arabia saudi ... 
  politicians involved in drug dealing , prostitution , pornography ... and the list goes on and on . 
  i think merkel is bluffing their own citizens in order to not scare them , or she really has no idea of what 's happening in this whorehouse called spain . 
  this is because the people out there do n't have a clue about the news we have here everyday . 
  there are n't many sources in english talking about the corruption cases , just a few of them cross the `` spanish 's linguistic borders '' . . : - /, 
  kids , boys , girls , ederly people , doctors , teachers we all are their enemies to the eyes of the police . 
  one day someone will take the law into their own against these scumbags , that day i can assure you i 'm not going to cry ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e71dxvh3r7g, 
  castillian refers to the region where the language has its roots , castile . 
  so , the use of castilian over spanish highlights the diversity of this artificial country called spain . 
  the same applies in the opposite direction . 
  the most americans that try to learn spanish sound like mexicans . 
  well . . except gwyneth paltrow , she speaks a perfect and fluent castillian ( spanish from spain ) . 
  spain is like a parallel universe , here we speak [ santanderish english ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbkk9wlpc9s ) . 
  p.s : oh . . do n't bother to turn the subtitles on , that does n't going to help at all :-d, 
  spanish oligarchy traditionally always has been catholic , but the most people it 's not religious at all . 
  maybe in the south you can find the most religious people in spain , and also among the elderly . 
  i 've personally never met no one that go to a church other than a wedding or a funeral . 
  edit : ups sorry , you were asking about italy :p, 
   we 're also one of only countries in europe to have a diagonal line in their flag . 
  and perhaps the only one in western europe .

  there is a growing market for this kind of items down here , sir . 
   the spanish economy is actually seeing some pretty strong growth for the first time in years . 
  no , it 's not, 
  [ yeah , pretty much ] ( https://youtu.be/4ljde4sler0 ), 
  the word `` nachos '' does n't exist in spain spanish . 
  there is the personal name `` nacho '' that is a diminutive of ignacio ( ignatius ) but the mexican food known as nachos are probably called by most spanish people by the brand `` doritos '' . 
  that verb not even exist in spain or at least i never heard of it . 
  that 's mexican or south american ( not sure if are used in others places other than mexico ) . 
  no one use those words in spain . 
  castilian and spanish are the same language . 
  this is the closest one they could find : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0ipdi3b6di, 
  today the world is a better place ... darwin never disappoints me . 
  haha yeah , yeah i know what you mean . 
  i just wanted to see the potato omelet flame war around here xd in fact there are n't many things we share at a national level , if any . 
  every region has its own culture , folklore , culinary traditions , languages etc. . that 's shows how diverse and complicated this place is . 
   there is not `` a '' dish in spain . 
  [ cough , cough . . ] ( https://i.imgur.com/lsxqkhe.jpg ) you should be one of those without-onionist barbarian xd,

  those are four severed moors ' heads .

  a basque thing actually . 
  yes , with soda ( actually gaseosa , a kind of sweetened soda ) : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/tinto_de_verano or with 7up : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/rebujito, 
  in bars most people drink beer or when you go out at night/clubbing the most common drink will be any kind of liquor mixed with soft drinks . 
  wine is reserve when you go out to dinner or lunch . 
  kalimotxo is a drink for teenagers/squaters/punks to get drunk in the cheapest way possible . 
  if you are brave enough to drink that kind of wine ( 0,50 or , 0,70 $ per liter ) without mixing with something you deserve a statue in the `` plaza mayor '', 
  the word `` birra '' is also pretty common in spain . 
  it turns out that flamenco is not exactly a spanish thing . 
  it 's only traditional in andalucia ( southern spain ), 
  thank you greece , we love you , 
   the thing is that most of the greco-roman culture contribution were forgotten after the fall of roman empire . 
  the western civilization where we live got its start from carolingian empire ** toledo school of translators ** the toledo school of translators ( spanish : escuela de traductores de toledo ) is the group of scholars who worked together in the city of toledo during the 12th and 13th centuries , to translate many of the philosophical and scientific works from classical arabic , classical greek , and ancient hebrew . 
  ** legacy ** the translations of works on different sciences , such as astronomy , astrology , algebra , medicine , etc. 
  acted as a magnet for numerous scholars from all over europe who came to toledo eager to learn first hand about the contents of all those books that had been out of reach to europeans for many centuries . 
  thanks to this group of scholars and writers , the knowledge acquired from the arab , greek and hebrew texts found its way into the heart of the universities in europe . 
  i 'd vote no , because enough is enough . 
  fuck the eu and the euro ... 
  after 500 years they still speak [ a dialect of the castilian/spanish language ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/judaeo-spanish ) ( at least at a family level ) . 
  pretty impressive if you ask me , my reaction to something like this would have been very different :p, 
  oh believe me , those provinces where romanian are the majority ( except the coastal ones in the south and east ) have a shitty weather :p ps : northern provinces rainy as shit , the central part of the country very cold in winter and very hot in summer , no middle term . 
   i thought a lot of maroccans lived in spain for generations since they are so close to each other . 
  nope , massive moroccan inmigration started around 20/25 years ago , before that were very difficult to see a moroccan on the street ... well in fact , i was difficult to see any other nationality other than spaniards . 
  at least it 's real , 
  whatever , still a fake castle , 
  the little problem with the neuschwanstein castle is that in fact is a modern idealized bulding ( 19th century ) .
