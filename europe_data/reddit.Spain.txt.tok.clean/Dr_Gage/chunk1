chorizo overpowers any other ingredient . 
  if you think that 's a better paella i suggest you eat chorizo with bread , it 's got exactly the same flavour and will be much cheaper . 
  algo most chorizos i 've seen outside spain are more like a normal sausage with paprika , and taste like wet paprika . 
  try a real valencian paella if you have the chance , it 's an amazing dish . 
  our most mistreated dish is paella , from the ones with chorizo , to curry . 
  most would be fine if people called it `` rice with things '' , but paella is a very particular dish from a region in spain . 
  just see what happened to jamie oliver when we included chorizo in his recipe . 
  [ oliver ] ( https://www.google.es/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/jamie-olivers-paella-chorizo-brings-fractured-spain-together-against-him ), 
   so spain is not spain ... lol [ etb 's vaya semanita did it best . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/y2ivn36_t88?t=2m10s ) \u00a1 gora espa\u00d1a askatuta !, 
  the spanish cauldron would either not have a fire , not have a guard or not even the cauldron being there depending of what part of the system failed that day . 
  i ' t like the old joke of a german and a spanish friend getting to hell and being separated by nationalities . 
  they are both sentenced to eat a bucket of shit everyday , lay on grill for hours and then be tortured by a demon of their nationality . 
  they see each other after some time and the german guy looks awful , the punishment is really showing on him he just mumbles `` every fucking day ... the shit , the grill , the torture , i cant take it !! '' . 
  meanwhile the spanish guy is doing great and just tells the german guy , this place is great , most days someone forgot to get the shit , the grill has n't worked since 1992 and the spanish demon is public worker , he just clocks in , checks his emails and leaves !, 
  i also think [ francesinhas ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=francesinhas&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjo55ch2bftahwlafakhfvuankq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1396&amp;bih=668 ) could be a hit , it 's a meat lovers dream and great for hungover , saved my life at paredes de coura festival a few years ago . 
  [ mus , cinquillo , burrote ... ] ( https://juegosdecartas.wordpress.com/ ) there are tons of them , all played with [ spanish playing cards ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_playing_cards ) . 
  the most famous and played one is [ mus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mus_\\ ( card_game \\ ) ) : `` the game is played between two opposing pairs of players [ 5 ] with the spanish deck [ 5 ] which is a deck of 40 cards , without eights , nines , or tens and no jokers , [ 5 ] and it has a variety of different rules in the different regions of spain . 
  the game has four rounds : [ 5 ] handia ( biggest ) : playing for the highest combination of cards . 
  txikia ( smallest ) : playing for the lowest combination of cards . 
  pareak ( pairs ) : playing for the best matching card combination . 
  jokoa ( game ) : playing for cards total values of 31 or more . 
  sometimes replaced by a punto ( point ) special round . 
  in each of these four rounds players take by order a call each , [ 5 ] verbalizing ( usually after discussing it with his partner ) whether he/them will bid ( `` envido '' ) or pass ( `` paso '' ) which only results in skipping call turn to next player . 
  after all four players have spoken each round , the bids ( `` apostua '' ) made are left hanging until the scoring round at the end . 
  if no bet was made and all four players passed to bid , the round is `` in pass '' and will be decided at the end of the hand for a reduced value of just one point . 
  [ 5 ] it has a distinctive feature in that passing some established signals ( keinuak ) between players is perfectly allowed during the game . 
  [ 5 ] one other special feature of mus is that it is a mostly verbal game , with little card-involving action , limited to deal and discard ( if any ) . 
  [ 5 ] after cards are dealt and mus ( discard ) is stopped , all rounds are played verbally , bets are called , passed , accepted or rejected but cards are not shown , dealt or touched in any further way , and the player is only obliged to show them in the end of the round if needed in order to resolve any accepted bet . 
  this makes mus more difficult to learn simply by watching others play than most other card games , as it can be difficult to follow simply by watching . '', 
  edit : [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mpmbw2whmw ) is a video of a championship final . 
  even if you know how to play it 's difficult to follow . 
  they also make a lot people that use seseo or ceceo to write with some errors . 
  i 've seen tons of ads with `` electrisisista '' `` hasen '' `` ves '' . 
  it 's also very strange to us that use distinci\u00f3n when someone asks if for example cereza has a z or an s in it . 
  `` with franco there where many jobs , everything was much cleaner and there where much less immigrants '' quote by my parent 's cleaning lady ... who 's from the philippines and has been in spain since 1971 , i was `` ojiplatico '' . 
  at least in madrid a botellin is 20cl and a tercio is a 33cl . 
  and most ca\u00f1a glasses are 20cl . 
  also , in spain a lot of coffee is '' [ torrefacto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/torrefacto ) '' , roasted with sugar to make it last longer . 
  it gives it a particular taste that spaniards identify 100 % percent with coffee but it makes other people find the taste strange . 
  the iberian peninsula has been named the [ bull 's / ox 's hide ] ( http://www.iberianature.com/material/strabo.html ) since about 2000 thousand years ago . 
  same un spain , both are called russian . 
  i think this comes from roman law , one of my uni flatmates ranted to us for a good hour about the absurdity of having to learn shit like that . 
  and how the owner of a tree that has a bee hive is not the owner of the bees as they are considered wild also something about chasing your bee swarm was necessary for it to be considered yours still . 
  i shot a gun in vegas , was fun , the security guy/instructor was great . 
  the selection of targets was kinds strange , too casual for our taste ( clown , nazi zombie , different races committing crimes , osama bin laden ... ) . 
  in spain i 've shot a shotgun years ago , just some target practice . 
  just my two cents , long island ice tea is a cocktail for alcoholics . 
  most of europe , or at least southern europe , has a very drink at your pace and for as long as you want . 
  the let 's get shots , fucked up and drunk out of our minds in the spawn of a few hours is not how most people drink here . 
  for example in spain a drinking night can start anywhere from 9to 12pm and end around 6am , we usually drink ca\u00f1as ( 20ml beers ) or copas ( mixed drinks like gin tonic or rum and coke ) . 
  alcohol is sort of cheap so most people do n't have a `` most bang for your buck '' attitude but more of what do i enjoy drinking mentality . 
  i guess the waiter was thinking a mix of `` why would anyone drink that ? '', 
  and `` you 're get drunk really fast '', 
  you 're a bad person and you know it . 
  that 's like giving crack to a 5 year old . 
   and not male-male kisses unless it 's your grandfather . 
  in my family we kiss between males , specially when there is a big age difference , we also we kiss our fathers . 
  also between friends some people do , for example a few of my cousins friends in sevilla do . 
  in my group of friends we always go for a hug . 
  also just to add , we do not kiss for the most part in business environments . 
   few places in madrid any you 'd recommend ? 
  i like 1862 on c/pez , made me discover vodka shots and then a pickle ( in brine not vinegar ) , surprisingly good . 
  casa pepe sucks , my father once stopped us there on our way to sevilla just to mess with me . 
  i was a teenager and wearing my cherry dr martens and a sweater from [ reincidentes ] ( http://www.kromatikmusik.com/wp-content/uploads/reincidentes-logo.gif ) , a rock band , and had long hair . 
  he just laughed at my face when i entered and saw a falange and a spanish dictatorship flag . 
  i must admit they do have great jamon and sobaos . 
  they try to counter this fact with the insidious lie that we all have a lisp ( [ we do n't ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phonological_history_of_spanish_coronal_fricatives#mergers ) ) for some reason it bothers me way more than it should , maybe because i did have a lisp when i was little and had to go to speech therapy . 
  at least for me when visiting italy it 's like visiting a slightly different version of home , their way of life does n't feel unfamiliar in the slightest , it takes about 20 minutes to adapt to everything and you just understand how things work . 
  we have a lot of common cultural practices ( not that specific things are exactly the same but that they share a common origin/vibe ) and do n't find anything the other does as completely foreign . 
  there is little to no cultural shock . 
  it 's a personal preference thing , you can just crush everything together and call it a day but the way i do it is to toast the bread , rub the garlic in ( the toasted bread sort of grates it ) , then the olive oil ( so that the bread can adsorb it ) and then the tomato , some people also sprinkle a little salt on top . 
  in catalunya they usually also grate the tomato against the bread , but i prefer to use a cheese grater so that it 's a little chunky . 
   we have the best seafoods in europe you really want to piss of galicians yes ? 
  those be fighting words . 
  has to be portugal , it really reminded my of the states , people are genuinely wanting to be helpful and nice . 
  from being just friendly to actually taking responsibility in giving you a correct answer and making sure you get there correctly . 
  id also say swedish people , i mainly visited kiruna and everyone was super nice , specially our airbnb host and his family , received us one day with a warm spiced wine ( i forget the name ) , took us to see his photography studio ... just plain nice . 
  his mother in law even offered to drive us to the airport ( 45 minutes drive from where we were that day ) . 
  also coming from a mediterranean country ( we 're loud and a little hyper ) people in sweden just seem so calm and collected ( until they drink ) . 
  i like them , but when visiting sevilla i always look forward to trying a '' [ bollo ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--hkumlsxwyc/uqpm-0f9nii/aaaaaaaabi0/uhdxijarqja/s1600/bollo+\\ ( 22 \\ ) . jpg ) '' ( white bread with a very dense interior ) . 
  my aunt always had some in her house and i just ca n't find the same in madrid . 
  coffee and [ toast with olive oil and tomato with garlic . ] ( https://www.mcdonalds.es/sites/default/files/produits/tostadastomatenatural-477x3551.png ) . 
  also [ churros and porras ] ( https://piamadridista.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/p1040084.jpg ) . 
  in spain breakfast is n't really an important meal . 
  [ crna macka , beli macor ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118843/ ) ( black cat , white cat ) really funny movie by emir kusturica . 
  [ ni\u010dija zemlja ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283509/ ) ( no man 's land ) two soldier 's from oposite fronts find themselves trapped in a trench . 
  [ jagten ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2106476/ ) ( the hunt ) a small town kindergarten teacher finds himself acussed of molesting a little girls . 
  [ valhalla rising ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0862467/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) , kinda strange movie about a one eyed warrior that is captured . 
  [ bronson ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0862467/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) , about charles bronson , the uk prisoner that has been in solitary confinement the longest . 
  great role by tom hardy . 
  as my father used to tell me when i swore as a kid `` kiddo , speak correctly , it does n't cost a fucking dime '' ( \u00a1 ni\u00f1o , habla bien !, 
  i 've never seen waiters that work faster than in certain parts of southern spain . 
  the first thing is that everyone drinks [ ca\u00f1as \\ ( 20ml beer glasses \\ ) and most places give you a tapa . 
  ] ( http://www.que.es/archivos/201105/3858961w-640x640x80.jpg ) so take into account that they already have to do twice the work of many other places . 
  second you have to know that bars in spain are usually full of people and the noise we love to just shout the `` order '' there is no `` hi , how you doing ? 
  could i have two ca\u00f1as please ? '', 
  some of them use the [ bar top to write what you have had ] ( http://ep00.epimg.net/elviajero/imagenes/2015/05/26/actualidad/1432650915_238851_1432651136_noticia_normal.jpg ) and then just mentally add it up , usually while serving more ca\u00f1as to someone else . 
  [ carrilleras ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=carrilleras&amp;oq=carrilleras&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=utf-8 ) . 
  one of my favorite dishes .
