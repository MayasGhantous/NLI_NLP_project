  we have a few : [ tony mel 's ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=tony+mel%27s&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj1t-ey9anoahvmwhqkhq5dapiq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=637 ) [ new york burger ] ( http://newyorkburger.es/conocenos/ ) [ tony roma 's ] ( http://tonyromas.es/ ) [ peggy sue 's ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=peggy+sue+madrid&amp;safe=off&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=637&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjv4u_y9qnoahuhpbqkhvhgbo8q_auibygc ) and a few others . 
  they all serve burgers , milkshakes , ribs , brownies ... 
  they are usually not bad , but they are noway top tier restaurants . 
  some go for the dinner style with sort of 50 's decoration and maybe even dress the waiters in that sort of fashion . 
  you also have a few with a very harley-rockabilly vibe . 
  [ last year spain gave citizenship to 4000 thousand sephardi jews , whose families where expeled in 1492 . 
  ] ( http://www.timesofisrael.com/spain-expedites-citizenship-for-thousands-of-sephardic-jews/ ), 
  get one of [ these ] ( https://www.amazon.com/global-compact-universal-travel-adapter/dp/b00x7fb0m2/ref=sr_1_12?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1470304632&amp;sr=8-12&amp;keywords=universal+power+plug ) and never worry about it again . 
  me cago en ... ( i shit on ... ) ... la leche ( que mamaste ) -- the milk ( you sucked as an infant ) mamaste is the same root as mammal . 
  ... tu puta madre -- your whore mother . 
  ... en todo lo que se menea -- on everything that moves . 
  ... en la mar salada -- on the salty sea . 
  ... en tu vida -- on your life there are thousands of these . 
  it never gets to 50 , the hottest cities in spain with the highest heat records are murcia ( 47\u00bac ) , cordoba and seville ( 46\u00bac ) . 
  i 've experienced seville in the summer and it 's just unbearable , that 's why you only see '' [ guiris ] ( http://img.desmotivaciones.es/201109/guiri_1.jpg ) '' ( lobster color foreigners ) around the city . 
  in madrid it rarely gets below 0 . 
  in winter at night it can get to -3 , -4 and you can see frozen dew at morning . 
  it 's also very dry so it 's not very unpleasant . 
  also madrid has extremely clear skies ( hope it lasts , but contamination is a huge problem ) so at mid morning and in the sun you are quite confortable and it 's not unusual to see people with a coat and sunglasses . 
  i think parto of it has to do with how campuses are very different . 
  at least in my country you do n't get those american `` mini city '' universities where you can live without ever having to leave the university . 
  here most universities are right besides the city . 
  you go to class and then leave . 
  your live does n't revolve around the university , it 's just the place you go to study . 
  it obviously influences your social life and leisure but it 's not your everything . 
  same way as it 's extremely weird to see someone with a university logo sweater . 
  so sports in uni are just that , something you do to stay semi fit , not something that represents your whole university and life . 
  for example i was in my unis rugby team , we played every saturday in a league , but most of the other teams were not universities , it was just a regular league . 
  rice with squids and ink is absolutely delicious . 
  '' [ arroz negro ] ( http://rockpaella.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/paella-arroz-negro.png ) '' ( black rice ), 
  we celebrate the new year by eating 12 grapes in the first 12 seconds of the new year . 
  it 's supposed to bring you luck for the new year . 
  that 's just germans , it sometimes even goes [ to the courts ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30937492 ) . 
  i think it comes off like that because the way we `` ask '' for things in bars and cafes . 
  in spanish you usually just say `` give me two beers '' or just `` two beers '' . 
  it seems that if you do that in most other countries you are being very rude . 
  when i was a teen we played `` pim , pam , pum '' you need a few people , sit in a circle . 
  when it 's my turn i have 3 options : if i say pim the it 's the turn of the person to my right . 
  if i say pam then it 's the turn of the person to my left . 
  if i say pum it 's the turn of the person i 'm looking to . 
  if you doubt or say nothing you loose or say something when it 's not your turn you loose . 
  it get 's tricky fast, 
  from 2 to 5 in retail . 
  but it 's not normal in the rest of jobs . 
  it also is something that has been carried over from the 60 's when it was normal for the household head to have two jobs , this way they could get from one to the next and eat something . 
  we 'll never let a good excuse to party go to waste . 
  those festivals have a religious theme , but i 'd say it 's more cultural or identity of the town nowadays than it is religious . 
  take san fermin for example , it 's a 7 day drinking binge with a saint 's name , that 's about as religious as it gets . 
  even the ones that are supposed to be for devoted people are just an excuse to have a party , see `` el rocio '' a peregrination to almonte town to honor the virgin of el rocio . 
  even the ones that are really religious , holy week specially , are just a farse . 
  most of my cousins go out as [ nazarenos ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=nazarenos&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjq0zlf_opoahunahokhazkankq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=637 ) not a single one of them leads a catholic lifestyle it 's just tradition , same thing with religious weddings , it 's just all for show . 
  not that i know of , the closest is [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdqayc1sr7g ) that has a moment about how europeans see americans , and how we see each other . 
  [ about that ... ] ( https://i.imgur.com/p6t8znt.jpg ), 
  yes , and not that crappy ice that bars make on the spot that is small and melts way to fast . 
  what you get are cylindrical ice `` cubes '' that are quite big and last a long , as the ones shown in [ this picture ] ( http://shop.koala.es/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/1200x1200/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/c/u/cubitera-nature-xxl3.jpg ) . 
  you can buy ice at any deli , gas station , supermarket ... we put ice in everything . 
  some foreigners are surprised when they see '' [ tinto de verano ] ( http://wijnbloggers.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tinto-de-verano-strand.jpg ) '' , red wine + soda + ice . 
  it 's one of the few things i hate about most other countries , specially when it 's for something like a rum and coke . 
  and do n't forget a 15-20 % tip over the taxed price . 
  i want to eat , not do math !, 
  catholics have no problem with evolution and are not creationists . 
  [ pope emeritus benedict xvi , includes this paragraph  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catholic_church_and_evolution ) according to the widely accepted scientific account , the universe erupted 15 billion years ago in an explosion called the ` big bang ' and has been expanding and cooling ever since . 
  later there gradually emerged the conditions necessary for the formation of atoms , still later the condensation of galaxies and stars , and about 10 billion years later the formation of planets . 
  in our own solar system and on earth ( formed about 4.5 billion years ago ) , the conditions have been favorable to the emergence of life . 
  while there is little consensus among scientists about how the origin of this first microscopic life is to be explained , there is general agreement among them that the first organism dwelt on this planet about 3.5 -- 4 billion years ago . 
  since it has been demonstrated that all living organisms on earth are genetically related , it is virtually certain that all living organisms have descended from this first organism . 
  converging evidence from many studies in the physical and biological sciences furnishes mounting support for some theory of evolution to account for the development and diversification of life on earth , while controversy continues over the pace and mechanisms of evolution . 
  for my experience it 's usually a rounding up thing more than anything . 
  leaving a few euros at the most . 
  very few times i 've seen someone leave a bill . 
  we do have the `` bote '' , a tip jar that is distributed among all the workers , usually that includes kitchen staff . 
  fire fighters are seen as just doing their job , a pretty commendable one . 
  some people will call them lazy because they have a free day for each 24h shift . 
  but this are the same morons that talk about small government and public servers being parasites . 
  when they have striked for something they are usually supported by nearly everyone . 
  police ( policia nacional ) are viewed mostly well , but every time the [ riot police ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvsezeowfcc ) goes out they go way beyond what they should . 
  it 's quite shameful if you ask me . 
  they tend to be rude to people they can be rude to . 
  usually they have a very thuggish attitude . 
  in my personal experience they wont even give you their name/number and go very quickly to threats and intimidation . 
  we also have [ guardia civil ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_guard_\\ ( spain \\ ) ) , with is a kinds paramilitary police that used to be our rural police . 
  they are very well seen by right wing people . 
  most of them are usually extremely polite , harsh and professional . 
  they are not `` scary '' but you do not mess with the guardia civil . 
  also have local/state police ( basque-ertzaina , catalan-mosso d'esquadra ... ) i have no personal experience , but ertzaina was famous for beating the shit out of eta simpatizers and the mossos have had a few torture trials . 
  in spain when you die your stuff is divided in thirds . 
  1/3 is for your kids , only way to avoid id if they abandoned you or something similarly bad . 
  this has to be proven , your word is not enough . 
  1/3 you can use to give to the kid you like the most or between them , but you cant just give it to anyone . 
  i ` ts called the bettering third . 
  1/3 you can leave to whomever you want . 
  although it 's taxed , the closest your family relation the less you pay . 
  you also pay taxes when you inherit something . 
  in navarra they have `` fueros '' ( speciall law ) and you can leave all your things to your eldest son . 
  you are expected to provide for your children until they can do it for themselves , sometimes resulting in ridiculous sentences where parents are forced to pay for a 28 year old son . 
  in spain we call it `` aparcar de oido '' , `` parking by ear '' . 
  no one would get angry for a little `` kiss '' from your bumper , but smashing your car against the next one deliberately is not accepted . 
  the driving style also depends a lot of the city you live in . 
  for example my father was a tourist guide in madrid for years , when travelling to other cities he usually get 's to places before the locals because he 's used to being very quick and `` aggressive '' driving . 
  not that he 's a wild driver , but in madrid if you do n't get into a roundabout where the is a space slightly bigger than you car people will honk at you , the moment the light turns green you have to be moving or people will start honking ... we are not nearly as bad as rome though .
