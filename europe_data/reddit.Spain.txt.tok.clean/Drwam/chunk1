[ so you do n't like memes ... ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/020/604/90b.jpg ), 
  hahah yea , that motto would be way more fitting for a country under le pen 's rule . 
  but i hope you never rescue it from the trunk of memories . 
  a country with `` libert\u00e9 , \u00e9galit\u00e9 , fraternit\u00e9 '' as national motto should n't have a leader like her . 
  if you want snow while you stay in malaga , you have sierra nevada at about an hour and a half ( driving ) in granada , it 's a lovely place and in january it will be bustling since it 's practically the only ski station in southern spain . 
  yea , it 's awful . 
  apparently we are in the last moments to do damage control against climate change . 
  goodbye to the paris agreement , it wo n't be easy with usa paddling in the opposite direction . 
  i do n't know why but people really do n't care about learning a 2nd language here , unless they plan to leave the country . 
  normally you go to the languages school for a few months , pass an easy peasy exam , learn nothing , so you can put in the curriculum that you have `` intermediate english '' . 
  :o where !, 
  that place in the outskirts of granada is now called `` el suspiro del moro '' ( the moor 's sigh ) . 
   no one in spain likes fucking flamenco hey !, 
  i do . 
  lots of people in andalusia like flamenco , not all palos tho . 
  never found them funny , they try so hard to be controversial that it 's pathetic . 
  hahah we 're not the best at anything good , but if i have to say good things about my country ... 
  i 'll go with freedom and that it 's an inclusive place ( tho i bet we 're not n\u00ba1 at that either ) . 
  it 's funny because greece is n\u00ba1 in my `` to visit '' list as soon as i get the job i 'm preparing for . 
  greece is just all around my favorite country , beautiful , all coast and fascinating history and culture . 
  that film is amazing tho , if you liked its vibe and you do n't mind slooow paced movies you might like the spirit of the beehive , it was an inspiration for del toro to make pan 's labyrinth . 
  u rite , and you know , i 'm fine with not being the n\u00ba1 this time ... 
  but then it 's true , we 're not n\u00ba1 at anything d :, 
  unemployment ? 
  here i can tell you that it has to do a lot with eager hunters , in the rare occasions in which wolves attack livestock , the rancher is economically compensated . 
  images of decapitated wolves hanging from traffic signs are becoming frequent in asturies , and now castille raising the number that can be legally hunted does n't help to stop this nonsense . 
  pretty much like with the iberian lynx , the administrations wo n't care until it 's almost too late and too expensive to protect them , their disregard will turn against them . 
  this one caught my attention : [ castilla y le\u00f3n ( spain ) will allow the hunting of 143 iberian wolves per year until 2019 ] ( http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/2814205/0/castilla-leon-permitira-cazar-lobos-anuales/ ) these animals are the same that portugal is protecting ( and portugal rightfully receives eu subventions for it ) , they move between both countries . 
  castilla y le\u00f3n 's government ignored countless of requests from conservationist groups for a stuty on the real census of the wolves in the area , they are not a threat to livestock and killing so many would break the ecosystem . 
  143 per year until 2019 , bare in mind that the roughly estimated population in the region is ~ 1500 wolves . 
  true , i should 've not made that assumption . 
  at least it 's sure to say that it 's way older than latin , mother of the rest of languages spoken now a days in iberia . 
  basques are not part of the club , euskera pre-dates indo-european and is n't conected to any other language . 
  this guy 's channel is awesome , he has covered a good amount of languages so far , still waiting for a video about greek . 
  you 're getting downvoted , but you 're not wrong . 
  the caliphate of cordoba was home of medical and scientific advancements , and they had more sexual freedom than the christian kingdoms . 
  also they washed themselves daily , while christians did only once every blue moon . 
  arguably they were less shitty in many things . 
  curious how different things are now . 
  if i were jew back then and someone doing a census knocked my door asking for my religion , i would 've said any religion , except jew . 
  not even that far from germany i would 've felt safe , tho it 's easy to know now in retrospective . 
  [ wow ... ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/tbh90unsdoqwa/giphy.gif ), 
   any sefardita can obtain spanish nationality nowadays if they can proof that they have jewish spanish ancestry i did n't know that and it 's quite interesting . 
  very sad data . 
  the 20th century was bonkers , i hope history never repeats itself in europe . 
  the spanish jews even had [ their own lagunage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/judaeo-spanish ) . 
  the expulsion caused a massive diaspora and the language has n't even died out now a days , tho i guess it will eventually happen . 
  it has a beautiful name , it 's in the balkans , was part of yugoslavia and , after it disappeared , was united with serbia for a few years . 
  that 's basically all i knew about montenegro before reading this thread . 
  the balkans is for me the most unknown region of europe ( except greece ) , i 'll try to learn more about it . 
  at least there 's order , [ unlike around here ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03385/benidorm-crowd-3_3385024k.jpg ) . 
  i hate beaches like this , i can not understand what 's the appeal of being cramped with dirty sand and sweaty people , i always go to small bays that are kinda hidden but not deserted . 
  a step in the right direction . 
  most people like them , but you only need 1 who does n't and that is unconscious and evil enough to leave poison on the streets . 
  and sadly , it 's not uncommon . 
  here , i searched for news about it and there are plenty of reported [ cases from the past few months ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=envenenamiento+gatos&amp;client=ms-android-orange-es&amp;prmd=ivn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=nws&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewikpyqjlahsahug2rokhta2draq_auicsgd&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=560 ) . 
  one of my dogs once got badly poisoned while i was giving him a walk , the vets found a little piece of meat in his stomach . 
  luckily he made it  the only consecuence is his fear for vets . 
  agree , they 're more clean , less vulnerable and less dangerous . 
  that 's awesome , i like a lot the way it 's handled . 
  yea , but not everyone loves stray cats around here . 
  some people feed stray cats ... and some others poison them . 
  luckily in my neighborhood a lot of people leave their cats go outside and no one is bothered by it . 
  but we needed that space for cathedrals !, 
  i wonder how would be america ( and the world ) if spain 's relationship with the aztecs , incas and the natives americans in general were more respectful and based on fair trade , and not on conquering and encomiendas . 
  the centuries prior to the discovery of america , spain ( which was n't even a nation ) was nothing but a bunch of kingdoms that hated each other united against the moors . 
  spain was born in long war , generations of spaniards were born only to kill moors and pray to virgin mary . 
  with that background ... how was the first contact with america suposed to be ? 
  i do n't buy the black legend as perfectly accurate , like i do n't think we were the worst colonizers ( but obviously we were damn awful ) . 
  anyway , i find [ this conversation between charles v and hernan cortes ] ( https://youtu.be/mryzw3bsj0i?t=489 ) very interesting . 
  the crown basically had no control over how the conquistadores treated the americans , the intentions were those of conquering and then integrate them in the kingdom , exploitation and slavery were n't in the crown 's plan ... but ofc , burning heretics and raising cathedrals were in the plan !, 
  ( it happened in the peninsula too , so it 's all good ) . 
  also the aztec empire , while advanced , was too very violent and inquisitive . 
  ok true , and now lem me say : you fucked up compadre !, 
  i love mexico , but man you guys have many things to fix over there lol, 
  n-no !, 
  i 'm navarre de to la via , pisha . 
  but we tried our best and that 's what counts \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  well , tbh you do n't need a master to know that !, 
  according to my latest calculations , corroborated by international experts on the subject , i conclude that portugal is a shit rectangle . 
  we civilized the americas and gave them the word of god . 
  what do we get in return ? 
  fucking reggeaton and electrolatino ... 
  i guess we did something wrong . 
  my parents have been calling me ` pollo ' ( chick ) affectionately all my life because of calimero , so yea , i have fond memories of this cartoon in the 90s . 
  there 's a direct relation betwen hospedages and tourism . 
  is there a reason for continental greece being so low ? 
  i mean , sure , the islands might be more interesting , but those regions in light blue must have things to offer too . 
  your country is damn beautiful , i do n't get why it has so much light blue compared with the rest of mediterranean countries . 
  i expected greece to be way darker in this map, 
  solid argument / s. 
  you ca n't just deny the entrance to a whole religion , more so one as diverse as islam . 
  it 's absolutelly anti-european . 
  talking about spain specifically , guardia civil is being efective at dismantling indoctrination groups and terrorist cedules . 
  i do n't find ok making a whole colective pay for the crimes of only some of them , plus there are legit spaniards that happen to be muslim . 
  no need to screw them all based on our specific situation , at any rate we could ban the entrance and repatriate people known for frequenting yihadist mosques and other indoctrination groups . 
  i know this opinion wo n't be popular around here . 
  top kek . 
  but seriously , fuck that !, 
  spain first , europe second and america wherever the hell it goes .
