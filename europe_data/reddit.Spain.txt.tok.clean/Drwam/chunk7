  like a hillbilly selling fruits in his van with a megaphone , people arguing , etc. 
  chill , i 'm a very laid back person . 
  i say ` iyo ' a lot , it has 0 meaning without context , it 's something we say a lot around here . 
  also ` oi ! ', 
  when i wan na get someone 's attention . 
  i scold the cat like it would care , just so the dogs do n't feel like the cat can get away with things they ca n't ... 
  i do n't think it makes sense , but i still do it anyways . 
   i ate a living squid once . 
  olive oil, 
  i 'll say portugal , because why noy ? 
  get rekt portugal , u suk lol jajajajajaja eks dee seriously : i would n't know . 
  too many countries and too many foods that i 'm missing . 
  true , but adding to it , on a cultural level al-andalus was very influential , and andalusia now a days has a very strong regional identity . 
  bizarre and dramatic ? 
  almodovar is both dramatic and bizarre , bu\u00f1uel is very bizarre , amenabar is mostly dramatic , julio medem is dramatic and kinda weird sometimes , victor erice 's work is odd , jose luis cuerda 's most famous films are dramatic ( even tho he has touched other genres ) ... and there are classics from other autors that are complete dramas . 
  civil war and sexuality are recurrent themes . 
  but at the end of the day there 're spanish films of all genres , there are lots of comedies been made here , but not many are very succesful nor become classics , from recent years ' 8 apellidos vascos ' comes to mind . 
  yup !, 
  there are 2 varieties : with and without onion , anything else breaks the recipe . 
  [ this aberration ] ( https://twitter.com/yummyntastyy/status/827224436331917313 ) . 
  they added onion like any good spaniard would do ... but the problem is that they did n't stop there ... they added all kind of weird shit . 
  it 's a tortilla de patatas ( omelette of potatoes ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ onion ) ffs , not a fucking omelette of all the shit you find in the fridge !, 
  it 's also thin and not t h i c c like it should . 
  ... ikr , do n't get all serious on me beause it 's all joking , i 'm not a judgmental prick , beauty is an ambiguous concept and i personally find self esteem and carefree atitudes as something very beautiful . 
  i mean ... yea , i guess you are right , there 's nothing written about tastes , free the bewbs in all shapes and forms !, 
   please do n't go topless or make out in the beach the topless part does not apply to spain , at the beach you can go topless if you want ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ if ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ can , ^ ^ ^ be ^ ^ ^ honest ^ ^ ^ with ^ ^ ^ yourself ... 
  i swear there were n't ill intentions , but idk why i somehow had the impression that it could be offensive x ) the balkanic countries have a reputation of not liking each others , i see there 's at least some truth to it hahah . 
  note how after one day no spaniard has bothered posting in this thread . 
  russians trying to speak greek ? 
  i hope i did n't say something offensive \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af for me is quite difficult to distinguish eastern europe and balkanic languages , i understant absolutely nothing and by the sound i can only tell appart greek . 
  romanian i can distinguish tho because it has the same roots as spanish . 
  i 'm not sure if i agree , but you have a point . 
  nay , not particularly . 
  but it would be nice if they stopped contaminating the straight , being a tax haven and there 's also the smuggling issue . 
  so basically , i do n't care about it 's sovereignty , but i do care about its questionable management , it does n't affect me directly , but i bet cadiz would do better without dealing with all this shit . 
  it 's not an issue of who owns the rock , it 's an issue of being good neighborgs and playing by the rules . 
  car - germany ( but i 'm not sure where it 's been manufactured ) . 
  clothes - southeast asia ( sadly . 
  i 'm a broke student and i can not afford european clothes , i 'll have to check for online deals because buying european clothes in stores is pricey af ) . 
  mobiliary - sweden and who knows where the old furniture come from . 
  electronics - korea , china and who knows where else . 
  colectables ( books , comics , music , games ) - japan , spain , usa , europe , etc. 
  ( spanish edition whenever it 's available ) . 
  food - mostly spain s ( ^ \u203f \\ ^ ) - b i do n't have valuable possesions but i 'd say i live comfortably considering that i 'm not working right now . 
  that 's interesting . 
  i always think about portugal as a mediterranean country . 
  do you consider yourselves mediterranean ? 
  these 3 make me particularly nostalgic : [ malcom in the middle ] ( https://youtu.be/c4cvkbvttsc ) , [ slayers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldcqw6wsdxa ) ( re-named reena & gaudi here ) , and the ending for [ rurouni kenshin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1xiqrujsrk ) ( el guerrero samurai here ) . 
  yup , i 'm from the 90s . 
  let 's say that righteousness here is not particularly appreciated . 
  hey , thx for the correction  i always like learning about these kind of things . 
  i know a good video about it : https://youtu.be/r_-l12lprwe we understand each other perfectly , except for a couple of things , like the verb ` coger ' , wich means in spain ` to grab ' , ` to catch ' or ` to pick up ' depending on the context and in latin america it means ` to fuck ' . 
  also in argentina ( and i think in uruguay too ) they use ` vos ' , instead of ` t\u00fa ' ( spain ) or ` usted ' ( rest of latin america ) , all three meaning ` you ' in their respective land . 
  but here 's the thing , in spain saying ` usted ' is very formal , something that you say to someone worth of much respect ( a judge , a tight ass professor , etc. 
  ) , and ` vos ' is n't used anymore because it 's medieval , it 's like in english saying ` thou ' , so this one is particularly weird in spain x ) also there 's the ` seseo ' and ` ceceo ' thing , how we pronounce 's ' , ` c ' and ` z ' . 
  but it 's not that importand , since it 's mutually comprehensible and also it happens whithin spain 's borders , in all spain we use ` ceceo ' , except in andalusia wich is a very particular case , besause some regions use ` seseo ' ( especially the east , like seville , for example ) , but other regions use a very strong ` ceceo ' ( like me , since i 'm from granada ) , the pronunciation can even be different between neighboring towns . 
  yes , honestly that too . 
  in nordic countries for example with their small populations , any immigration becomes notable . 
  more if it 's by closed and backwards communities , instead of people that merge themselves in the national culture . 
  i personaly have 0 issues with muslim people , but their culture is medieval and i would n't like it if it were influential in my nation . 
  yea , they do n't feel as judged so they have no reasons to be resented . 
  it 's curious how a country funded in their expulsion and where surnames like ` matamoros ' are a thing , has become the most open european country for them . 
  we did n't de-humanize the basques because of eta , and our armed forces are well prepared against islamists . 
  the shadow of francoism makes it so no one gets too far with hate-monguering . 
  i think those are factors too . 
  but also , even tho the situation is good , it 's also far from being perfect . 
  in spain , and according to polls , we are apparently far less concerned about it . 
  probably because we 've been dealing with it for a long time and because , despite the words about integration and solidarity , we 've barely taken any refugees . 
  in my everyday life i see little concern about it , honestly , we have other things to worry about . 
  i ca n't tell for other countries , obviously . 
  [ la madrug\u00e1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8haiph2hfu ) . 
  it 's one of the songs that acompanies one of the most famous passion week processions in seville . 
  it peaks up at [ 2:15 ] ( https://youtu.be/p8haiph2hfu?t=135 ) . 
  i 'm not a religious person nor i am into this kind of music ( at all ) , but i like this song . 
  let a man dream ; _ ;, 
  same , i find it mesmerizing and despicable at the same time . 
  i 'd vote for abolition in a referendum , it 's unnecessarily cruel . 
  reading , mostly the same . 
  writting , way slower because i have to think twice about typos , the apostophe and what not . 
  one thing that is particularly a handicap is that in english things are not written as they sound , its orthografy is n't very phonetic , unlike spanish , in spanish i can hear a word for the 1st time and inmediatly know how it 's written . 
  yea , way more opportunities there , but he would need to learn some spanish 1st . 
  the unemployment here is still rampant , he would have it rough tbh . 
  europe is a quite diverse and heterogeneous group of countries . 
  some people only think about western europe . 
  also if canada and australia could be candidates to get in ... why not also chile , argentina and uruguay ? 
  the 3 are mostly peacefull , free and progresive , also they 're developing at a nice pace . 
  apparently speaking english is a factor huh . 
  europe is europe and that 's it , trade and cooperation agreements with external countries ? 
  sure !, 
  nay . 
  belarus and turkey are more european than australia and argentina , despite these 2 last being politicaly closer to other european countries than turkey and belarus are . 
  and that said , turkey ( sadly ) and belarus now a days have no place in the eu , their politics are too oposed to the rest of the eu . 
  where i live there 's no fiber , it 's only 1 damn neigborhood away . 
  so for now i have to comform myself with 10 of download and 1 of upload ( real , on paper it 's 20 download and 5 upload ) , al least the ping is quite low . 
  yeah , that guy is actually a hate-monger . 
  yea take good care of it , it 's a jewel \\ ^ \\ _ ^, 
   my family owns a renault alpine a110 that car is gorgeous , my father used to have one , too bad the fiber glass of the bodywork got damaged and he decided to get rid of it u.u, 
  many different civilizations and cultures have been around here : iberians , phoenicians , greek setlements , romans , visigoths , moors ... maybe visigoths are the ones more conected with the current spain ? ... 
  they introduced christianity and re-conquered spain putting an end to the caliphate . 
  but all our languages ( except basque , which pre-dates indoeuropean languages ) are descendants of latin , introduced by romans .
