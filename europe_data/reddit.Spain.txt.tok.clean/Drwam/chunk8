  bullfighting is kind of a bootleg roman cirque . 
  also spanish has been influenced by the arabic language . 
  and the moorish influences , specially in the south , must be taken in consideration . 
  spain as a nation and spaniard as way to call those who live here became a thing at the time castille and aragon got unified , the moors got expelled , and the new world was about to be discovered . 
  it 's complicated . 
  cristina cifuentes from the pp ( now a days president of the madrid province ) called out pedro s\u00e1nchez ( back then leader of the psoe ) for being racist because he cleaned his hands after shaking hands with a black family , calling it `` an horror '' . 
  when i say it like that , it sure sounds horrible . 
  but aparently a kid had the hands sticky from eating jelly beans or something like that . 
  it was so easy to call him out for it and was so obvious that it was taken out of context that it backfired inmediatly . 
  more so when you consider that psoe is more left-ish and inclusive in these kind of aspects than the center-right pp ( but honestly , i do n't find the pp particularly bad in this mater , in spain we are lucky in that regard , there 's no hate-mongering party ) . 
  on the good side you know that you 'll have all the big events close . 
  here the closest i 've had to travel for a big concert is 3-ish hours ( granada-seville ) , one time i even had to go to lisbon , which is 7 hours away u.u i have to plan all these things beforehand , pay an hostal and what not , it kinda sucks . 
  probably chile . 
  but mexico and argentina are up there too . 
  he is vegan !? 
  what !? 
  how the fuck does he something like that ? 
  i do n't think that being vegan is unviable , but not when you 're a top athlete : s, 
  yea , he 's not at peak form right now . 
  he has an elbow lesion or something . 
  but tbh neither is nadal , his results have been quite discreet for some time . 
  lots of severe lesions in the last years . 
  he started competing at the highest level while being quite young , and his game is very physical , more than tecnical , so it 's expectable that he drops the highest level sooner than the average tennis player . 
  both are awesome . 
  but i think that in the long run nadal , like federer , will be remembered as one of the best ever . 
  while novak will be remembered as a great player , like murray , but not particularly remarkable when compared with nadal or federer . 
  ` coffee alone with nothing ' usually , balically hot water with coffee , in summer i take it with ice . 
  i like my coffee bitter , but from time to time i take sweet coffee , like coffee with caramel and what not . 
  that djokovic is not as good as nadal :\\ ^ ), 
  since the main characters are american , i guess it would be easier getting mexican voice actors for the villains . 
  at the end of the day only spaniards are annoyed by it and they 're just a not so big portion of the global sales . 
  re4 triggered a lot of people in spain because of the dub , the villagers and cult members speak with a strong latin american accent and it takes place in ( northern ? ), 
  spain . 
  i liked that game , the begining legit scared me , i found those villagers and their nasty town way more scary than any monster . 
  later it gets too over the top and it 's like ` whatever ' . 
  the spirit of the beehive , maybe ? 
  i ca n't imagine hollywood making such a slow paced and calm film , with so little dialogue and without anything big going on . 
  there are other places that i find appealing , but being pragmatical i would chose canada no doubt . 
  the climate is the big downside , but compared with the downsides of other countries it 's like nothing . 
  i find interesting too australia , new zealand , chile and argentina . 
  asian countries for me would be good places to visit but not to live in , too much cultural impact . 
  eeuu is aight , but i like canada more , yes , less oportunities but also less troubles . 
  [ \u00c1ngel sanz briz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%81ngel_sanz_briz ) comes to mind , one of the most notable righteous among the nations , surprisingly unspoken of , even here . 
  but you barbarians do n't even have bidets , i have no idea where you put the toilet paper and such . 
  in southern spain it would be a waste of space and electricity , and during the hotest months it would be even a waste of time . 
  in summer here clothes get dry in a couple of hours , and in winter it never takes more than 1 day . 
  so there 's no point , here sun does that job pretty well . 
  portugal : nothing really . 
  maybe that we do n't pay any attention to each other despite being so close culturally and geographically . 
  france : they 're a stronger nation than us in every possible aspect and i do n't like that . 
  i preffer spain 's culture . 
  there 're many things that i appreciate about them , but this thread is about talking shit so i wo n't bother . 
  morocco : is there anything good about this neighborg ? 
  they forced us to abandon the spanish sahara , the borders are a chaos with thousands of sub-saharan inmigrants trying to get in . 
  plus their culture is like day and night when compared with ours , the way they view things does n't match with spain 's view on social matters ( not even close ) . 
  at least our diplomatic relationships have n't been a trouble for a long time . 
  gibraltar : tax haven , smuggling , enviromental hazzard for our coast and damages the economy of the surrounding region . 
  terrible neighborg thb . 
  andorra : tax haven , but fine in every other aspect . 
  the region where i grew up [ looks like this ] ( http://www.elbolardo.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2016/05/alpujarra.jpg ) , it 's called la alpujarra , in the southern side of sierra nevada , the highest mountain of the peninsula , and yes , it 's as isolated as it looks . 
  over an hour in car to the most nearby city , granada , a big part of which is through treacherous thin roads at the verge of a cliff . 
  true : we are loud , laid back and swear a lot . 
  false : we are lazy and sleep after lunch ( some do , mostly old people , but it 's not really a thing anymore ) . 
  i think it 's kinda easy saying that from here in spain ... would you say the same if you were in estonia , latvia , finland or especially ukraine ? 
  also any war is a scary war , even if you 're in the strongest side , lots of people will die . 
  russia despite not being rich , has nuclear potential ( that alone is a huge no-no to engage in warfare ) and holds a key position in global politics . 
  not to say that europe is in an unconfortable position right now , with usa getting a bit too close to russia and breaking ties with the eu , and the rise of nationalistic groups ( some related to russia ) in key countries of the eu does n't help either i think . 
  just my 2 cents . 
   at the risk of sounding stuck up , i think i can say with confidence that i will never go to spain because of this . 
  which is a shame , because it is a very beautiful place , and i 'm sure many spanish people disapprove of the practices . 
  yes , people who actually enjoy bullfighting , participate on it and take pride on it are a minority when compared with the people who does n't care about it and does n't participate on it and people who despise it and are actively against it . 
  groups in favor of animal rights are surprisingly popular around here . 
  for each dumbass hanging galgos there are ten persons working on rescue programs , for each indolent paying a ticket for a corrida there 's people signing petitions to stop the torture . 
  but all this does n't change the fact that bullfighting is institutionaly promoted as the national festivity ... while many see it as the national shame . 
  it makes no sense promoting as national heritage something as divisive and that generates such strong opinions as bullfighting , because many plainly hate it . 
  but i guess it 's a clever move after all , since there 's nothing as spanish as being divided . 
  now that i 'm done ranting x ) you should come to spain if you get the chance , it 's no only a beautiful place , there 're so many things unique to spain that you could enjoy . 
  [ la lengua de las mariposas ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0188030/?mode=desktop&amp;ref_=m_ft_dsk ) , a literal translation would be ` the tongue of the butterflies ' , but in its location to english they named it simply ` butterfly ' . 
  it 's about the life of a galician kid during the 2nd republic in the months prior to the coup d'etat by the nationalists , and how much the civil war changes his life . 
  another good one would be [ vacas ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103186/?ref_=nv_sr_2 ) , ` cows ' in english . 
  about the rivalry of two basque families during three generations in the late 19th century and the early 20th century ( during the 2 last carlist wars ) . 
  it 's kinda trippy at times . 
  both take place in periods marked by civil war , but these conflicts are not the core of these films . 
  animal abuse . 
  festivities in which torturing animals is the focus of the party . 
  nsfl pics : [ becerradas ] ( http://www.elplural.com/sites/default/files/field/image/becerro-valmojado.jpg ) , [ gored horse ] ( http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdqwb2w4xy1rrs6fio1_1280.jpg ) , [ gored matador ] ( http://i3.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article396686.ece/alternates/s1200/spanish-matador-irael-lancho-gored-pic-getty-656089227.jpg ) . 
  tauromaquia is n't ` art ' as some dare to call it , and it 's a shame that it recently has been elevated to the status of national heritage . 
  and it 's not only bullfighting , there 's a town where they throw a goat from the clocktower every year , bous embolats ... and the list of stupid shit like this goes on and on . 
  it 's very backwards , and pointless . 
  that said , i think that a corrida without damaging the bull would be an outstanding spectacle ( probably impossible ) . 
  and recortadores have my respect . 
  i think that b1 is a good starting point , you could comunicate on a basic level while keep learning , now at a faster pace , due to the exposure . 
  people for the most part are helpful and welcoming with ` guiris ' . 
  i mean ... the officer basically forced an armed catalan to spend money . 
  that 's asking for trouble . 
  but it 's beautiful when seen from the inside , by staring at its facade no one would imagine how pretty it actually is . 
  spanish gypsies , despite living by their own rules and not being the most productive citizens , have given us cultural traits that are appreciated by a lot of people , such as flamenco . 
  these are my favorite spanish films : [ la lengua de las mariposas ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0188030/?ref_=nv_sr_2 ) [ vacas ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103186/?ref_=nv_sr_2 ) [ los amantes del circulo polar ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133363/?ref_=nv_sr_2 ) [ el laberinto del fauno ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) [ el esp\u00edritu de la colmena ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070040/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) [ blancanieves ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1854513/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) [ magical girl ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3089326/?ref_=nv_sr_3 ) [ la piel que habito ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1189073/?ref_=nv_sr_2 ) [ los santos inocentes ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088040/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ), 
  neither me . 
  without my family 's support , dealing with the unemployment here in the south would be really rough .
