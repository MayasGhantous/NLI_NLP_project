  i 'll gladly give back part of that support once my situation becomes truly stable . 
  this guy talks like he does n't know that his grandparents raised spain from the dust in the post war , that spain in the 90s passed 6 years with an unemployment rate over 20 % ( in the 80s it also peaked over 20 % ) , and that his parents generation is the one that brought the most freedom to spain . 
  marginal , they still remain as a joke to the public eye even after trump 's success . 
  they exist , but they do n't even come close to get a seat in the parliment . 
  i believe that our group in defense of animal rights ( pacma ) is more popular than our most voted far right group ( vox ) . 
  you need to know spanish . 
  except when doing tourism or in certain empresarial circles . 
  also there 're some ` colonies ' of english people where you 'll be fine with just english , towns where the are lots of brits , i 've grown up in a town with a big english comunity , some of them living there for years without really understanding spanish . 
  but yea , except for these cases , you have to know spanish because here most people do n't bother learning a 2nd language unless they feel like they really need it . 
  it 's changing tho , newer generations are better at languages . 
  i 'm thankful for it when it 's not meant in a douchy way . 
  i took private classes as a kid , so that made it easier latter on . 
  but basically watching films , reading , gaming , etc. 
  exactly , bans on something as important for a person as religion only generate resentment , and it ends up worsening the situation . 
  bad . 
  freedom for everyone to believe and pray to whoever the hell they want . 
  liberties must only be banned when they impede the liberties of others , and for concrete cases , whithout making pay fair people for the actions of others . 
  the only mexican thing about the movie is the director and part of the funding , all the actors and the setting of the film are spanish . 
  so yea , it 's safe to call it an european movie . 
  i 'll mention the ones that i have rated with 8 or more in imdb that are from europe ( excluding spain ) , maybe you find something you like : - come and see , 1985 russia - possession , 1981 france - bitter lake , 2015 uk - solaris , 1972 russia - the piano , 1991 co-produced in france - three colors : blue , 1993 france & poland - the devils , 1971 uk - let the right one in , 2008 sweden - lilya 4 ever , 2002 sweden - aguirre the wrath of god , 1972 germany - suspiria , 1977 italy - repulsion , uk 1965 - the plague dogs , uk 1982 - valerie and her week of wonders , 1970 czech republic - christiane f , 1981 germany - the pianist , 2002 european co-production - blue is the warmest color , 2013 france - the 7th seal , 1957 sweden, 
  granadino , andaluz , espa\u00f1ol y europeo . 
  granadino , andalusian , spaniard and european . 
  and i would n't change it , i love my land :3, 
  i get advertisements for catering , academies , workshops , electronic shops ... but not guns hahah . 
  if i were in some gun owners federarion or in a hunters federation , i would obviously , but you do n't get random advertisements like that here . 
  owning guns that are not meant for hunting or that are not part of your job is not particularly cool here , more like the contrary . 
  people who own guns for the sake of it are seen as odd , to put it lightly . 
  i bet you 'll be fine , media can be very sensationalist . 
  is this a joke ? 
  andalusian , when i moved out for the 1st time i had to adapt a bit and make myself more understandable because people legit did n't get what i was saying quite often . 
  that said , where i come from the accent is particularly strong and dry with lots of ` ceceo ' and other traits . 
  it 's quite marginal , and a lot of people , while being respectful , will give you ` the look ' if you say that you 're vegan . 
  vegans here have a hard time finding a place to eat ( tho there are ) , if you 're simply vegetarian you 'll have it much easier and you 'll still be able to try out some traditional plates . 
  nonetheless most big supermarkets have products for vegans . 
  i wan na learn a 3rd language , and french is the top contender because i already have a base for it ... 
  but it 's such a weird language with all those accent marks , and the pronunciation is so unnatural for a native spanish speaker . 
  at least the vocabulary is not too bad when you already know spanish and english . 
  opel zafira ( vauxhall in your country ) . 
  it 's comfy , has lots of space for the doggos and never makes me visit the mechanic except for the scheduled revisions . 
  the bad ? 
  it 's a fugly family car . 
  but perfect for the use i give it . 
  i 'll share my favorites from spain . 
  i love cordoban costumes , but they have to be simple and have just a couple of details , if not they look overdone and it kills the grace of the dress . 
  a few pics : [ here ] ( http://www.indochinavoyages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/spain.jpeg ) and [ here ] ( http://bcncoolhunter.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/amazona.jpg ) the [ flamenco dress ] ( http://www.entreciriosyvolantes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/traje-de-flamenca-de-manuela-macias.jpg ) is spectacular . 
  the [ traxe galego ] ( http://st-listas.20minutos.es/images/2013-02/356046/3928799_640px.jpg?1361755021 ) , this reminds me of the ones that you see in northern europe , only darker . 
  [ falleras ] ( http://www.fallasvalencia.es/files/imagecache/foto_articulo_original/falleras_9.jpg ) , whether you like it or you think it 's overdone , you have to respect the [ amount of detail ] ( https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-rv0d9k2vzoq/txz5iwmg2ei/aaaaaaaaate/stl1d9sntdy/s1600/falleras.jpg ) and work on these dresses . 
  i hate the profession , but [ trajes de luces ] ( https://www.muralesyvinilos.com/murales/traje_torero_muralesyvinilos_23475272__xxl.jpg ) can be a [ work of art ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nr1efnazcn8/txjpoavmzui/aaaaaaaaf4a/cfzka5mvwv4/s1600/traje+de+luces+y+las+pilas.jpg ) . 
  if only bullfighting did n't involve torture , i could also respect the people who wear these . 
  there are a lot more worth mentioning , each region has its own , but these are my favorites . 
  if i were to be less biased and choose some other country i 'd probably say japan , kimonos are damn beautiful . 
  i feel european and i think that i 'm very lucky for being born on this side of the mediterranean . 
  i think we share the same higher values for the most part , but it does n't change the fact that our social context can be very different fom one another . 
  i can feel myself european , and a finnish can feel european , but holy shit !, 
  my corner of europe and my daily life are quite different from his . 
  ofc if i compare myself with a portuguese or with someone from southern italy , it would n't be so different . 
  i see what you did there and it 's not funny ( \u0ca0_\u0ca0 ), 
  yes , because i use to buy them on sale using isthereanydeal.com and most of the times it 's not the multilingual version of the game . 
  with subtitles on , for when i do n't pick up the pronunciation . 
  i find funny that when people cry about the english dub of a game compared with the japanese one , for me both are just the same most of the times ... only that i can actually understand one of them , so english is always the clear winner for me x ), 
  i enjoy more manual cars , since i do n't live in a big city and i have to take curvy minor roads often . 
  but i see how automatics are better and more safe for tight maneuvers . 
  if i had to drive in a big city often i 'd probably appreciate more an automatic car . 
  once electric cars become the norm ( something that i 'm looking forward to ) i 'll have to accept not having a gear box . 
  until then i 'm fine with manual . 
  lol . 
  i 'm not the one dropping insults to a random out of nowhere , i 'm such a ` low class ' scum . 
  now fuck off twat . 
  get on your steed and keep going , no need to interact with the plebs . 
  i do n't trust you . 
  the kind of spiders that never attack ; and when you bother them and they bite , unless you get an alergic reaction , you wo n't even need to visit the hospital . 
  i leave them be , i put them in a safer / more hidden area if they 're in a place where they become a nuisance . 
  they eat moths , mosquitoes and what not , i like them , same goes for salamanquesas ( geckos ) . 
  [ this is the only kind of spider that i do n't like ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/pholcus_phalangioides ) , they look creepy and procreate like crazy . 
  one , two if you 're from a region with its own language . 
  we suck at foreign languages . 
  people here do n't care about learning a 2nd language until they need it , which is n't as pragmatic as it sounds . 
  the level of english and french in schools is meh . 
  here when someone does n't swear , at least every once in a while , you know that you ca n't trust him / her . 
  my parents used to scold me for swearing ... while swearing at the same time . 
  i ca n't remember when they gave up tho \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  here the trend now are american stanford , before them the trend were bull terriers and french bulldogs , you see these dogs everywhere , they are cheap to get since they are bred without control . 
  you also see yorkies , pomeranians , retrievers and german shepherds often . 
  as for hunt / work dogs : galgos , andalusian hounds and mastines . 
  this one is 16 years old and still keeping up !, 
  i 'm not that good at it , in my head i have an accent that i distinguish as british , but i could n't tell wich one it actually is . 
  mainly because all i know about english is from english media and interacting with foreing people , where i lived as a kid there were a relativelly big british community and i learned from them , but i 've never been in an english speaking country ( yet ) . 
   a london accent and an australian accent is a challenge for the non-native speaker . 
  here i would n't listen to the accent itself , i would wait for someone to say ` oi ! ', 
  or ` ya cunt ' to spot the australian :\\ ^ ), 
  i can distinguish between american , british and australian , but that 's about it . 
  i guess i could distinguish regional dialects too if i were more exposed to them . 
  and nigerian . 
  in my book it 's the best country of america , and one of the best in the world . 
  but if i had to move to somewhere in that side of the atlantic , i 'd probably pick argentina , nicer climate and less cultural impact . 
  canada is like that big guy who is friendly with everyone , does most things right and never gets in troubles . 
  but he has a brother who is richer , louder and kind of a jerk sometimes . 
  i lived in m\u00e9rida for a few years ( former emerita augusta ) . 
  man , that place is precious , roman ruins everywhere . 
  obviously it 's not impressive compared with what you have in italy tho .
