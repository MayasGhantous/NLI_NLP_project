well , argentina got its independence in 1816 . 
  brazil got its formal independence in 1825 , so yes you bordered argentina for 9 years . 
   they are like the portuguese after seeing so many countries asking why portugal is not part of spain , i ai n't even mad . 
  * checks flair * those damn valencians huh ? 
   a country where you dance the tango i can understand americans , australians or east asians not being able to tell the difference between us and our former colonies , but i did n't expect it from our european friends . 
  you 're literally hitler . 
  it 's ironically funny that the two countries bulgarians ask why they are in crisis are the countries with the largest bulgarian diasporas/communities in the eu . 
  well , the thread about what slovenes google about europe was also very hard on spain . 
  it 's weird because both countries do n't have much relations and have n't had any wars , and we never invaded an inch of slovenian soil like italy or austria have done . 
  thanks for the  why is spain in crisis ? 
  why is great britain england ? 
  why did great britain not reclaim the falkands ? 
  why does n't gb use the euro ? 
  why did gb become the workshop of the world ? 
  why did france invade mexico ? 
  why is france developed ? 
  why is france imperialistic ? 
  why did germany split into two ? 
  why is germany so developed ? 
  why did germany go to war again ? 
  why does germany oppose classical thought ( ? ), 
  some quality banter made by our mexibros there . 
  * if european countries were people , portugal would be that shy melancholic kid everyone laughs at and does n't get invited at any parties . 
  the only parties he would be invited would be made by spain , because unlike the other countries ( that see portugal as that weirdo similar to spain ) , spain actually knows him , and values him even when portugal is all like `` screw you espanha gib galiza and oliven\u00e7a back '' . 
  * on a more serious note , before getting into the english-speaking internet i did n't know there was a portugal-spain rivalry . 
  in spain it 's france the one that most people consider our rival so i was kind of expecting the french to have some kind of bants , but it seems they have keeping all the bants to their other neighbours but mostly have kind words for us . 
  it works the same way with portugal here . 
  we may have problems with the * gabachos * , or the * moros * , or the * llanitos * , but the portubros are always in our hearts . 
   why is spain a democracy ? 
  that spanish self-deprecation tho ... also , are we at war with slovenia ? 
  i did n't know . 
  or they can move here . 
  it will feel exactly like greece . 
  well , plus separatist movements and latin alphabet . 
  ** \u00d1 master race ** this . ^, 
  i sense old grudges against spain and france and an intense love for england . 
   i 've rarely met a spaniard without a poorly concealed sense of superiority over mexicans . 
  even if this is true , i think you beat us by far there . 
  the fact that trump is very likely to be the next potus is enough proof . 
  wow , italians have found a subtle way to make portugal and greece to be part of spain , lol . 
   so hot finally someone gets it right ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
   * spain - is not in g8 , lost , is bad , did not enter ww2 mother of god , the slovenes do hate us . 
   a modern country fuck yes , the first country that does n't talk shit about us . 
  so , when are we adopting french as the lingua franca again ? 
  first country that does n't ask why we 're so poor or why we do n't annex portugal . 
  well , it 's obvious ` muricans get spain and mexico mixed up . 
  this just reinforces it . 
   so poor [ after this ad , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieyd0bx6dhq ) i am sure they are actually referring to mexico right there . 
  actually u/rinasciment is right , french is lexically closer to italian . 
  just that spanish and italian sound more similar but then there are lots of false friends that can get you completely lost . 
  in the graph on [ this article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lexical_similarity ) , we can see that french-italian similarity is at 0.89 ( the same value for spanish-portuguese ) , while spanish-italian scores 0.82 ( catalan-italian is at 0.85 , and spanish-french is at 0.75 ) . 
  but the moriscos were kebabs . 
  you 'd also enjoy removing them . 
  canarian here . 
  yes , our islands have massive tourism going on , but that has basically become our only way of life . 
  in fact , prior to the 1980s the canary islands were spain 's poorest region . 
  we have less j1 ( jewish , arabic ) than most of the balkans , romania , hungary , austria , italy , france and portugal and more r1b ( western european ) than any country other than ireland and wales . 
  so much for the saying * europe ends at the pyrenees . 
  it is pretty relevant because it 's about china 's views on europe and the person who made the comment has a united kingdom flair . 
  plus both countries are more relevant than spain so their internal issues are more relevant to the world than spain 's . 
  yup , because the united kingdom or china are the paramount of national unity ... 
   why does n't it annex portugal ? 
  jokes on you china , we could n't even annex andorra . 
  shut the fuck up catholic serbia !, 
  let 's hope they allow it again . 
  btw ikurri\u00f1a  union jack . 
  but gallaecia ( which included what would become portugal ) was part of the kingdom of le\u00f3n . 
  would n't it be leonese `` nationality '' ? 
   but it 's still the country with the highest qol in south america . 
  actually , chile has the highest qol in south america , followed by uruguay . 
  but dude , it would be so predictable . 
  the euro cup/world cup final would always be spain - portugal . 
  both countries would have dope teams . 
  you know , irm\u00e3o , people may argue that all spanish or portuguese colonies suck so bad and ... they are right . 
  but when it comes to trivial pointless things like football they can kick other former colonies ass , and we should be proud of them . 
  because just like us iberians , they have learned to take seriously things that should n't be taken so seriously ( i. e. football ) , and to not give a fuck about the real important things of life . 
  people might make endless amounts of polandball comics about our corner of europe where there is a shit rectangle ( poortugal ) and a shit yugoslavia in the making ( shitpain ) , but at the end of the day , we 're glad people laugh at our irrelevantness or at how bad our colonies are , * because we know that those colonies who are so bad would beat the crap out of them in football .

  is it weird that the non-european countries with most european-descended people are the most prosperous and wealthiest ? 
  the main exceptions being japan and south korea on one side ( wealthy and non-white ) and argentina on the other side ... 
  but then again , argies are italo-spaniards ( neapolitan-galicians ) . 
  nothing good can come from that . 
  it 's not uncommon . 
  i am a spaniard ( average skin , not darker skin ) . 
  i was last week in lithuania and often got asked if i was a turk , sometimes with a rather hostile tone . 
  [ we already gave you a chance , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppkua6jz6ag ) [ but you wasted it . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egnf4hgmcvo ), 
  given the american hollywood stereotype i 'm pleasantly surprised it 's not `` part of mexico '' . 
  do n't you know that the canary islands , ceuta and melilla are all rightful moroccan territories invaded by the evil spaniards and corsica and istanbul have been french and turkish respectively since before the big bang happened ? 
  that 's too low key . 
  [ why not aim for a continent ? 
  portugal : we are bros who were fighting the crap out of each other for centuries , but now our fighting is mostly shitpost wars all over the internet like `` muh olivenza '' , `` muh aljubarrota '' , `` muh iberian union '' . 
  other than that , your pastries and desserts are so much better than ours , your coffee is also much better ( the thing it 's served in most caf\u00e9s in spain should be called * dirty water * rather than * coffee * ) , and your ability to stand the loud spanish tourists you get in lisbon , porto and co\u00edmbra . 
  andorra : you 're like one of the many tax havens spain 's wealthy use to keep their money , but other than that you 're pretty cool . 
  the only neighbour we have n't been in a war with , may i add . 
  oh , and also the ski resorts and the only country with catalan as its only official language . 
  france : you can get sometimes quite arrogant , chauvinist and proud , but you 've given so much to mankind it 's forgivable . 
  also , thanks for hosting so many spanish refugees and exiled during/after our civil war . 
  in exchange , many of those spaniards were an important part of the french resistance and fighting of the nazis from france . 
  for some reason , as / u/hermeran said , there is this weird thing that the french `` envy us '' but actually i 'd say it 's the other way around .
