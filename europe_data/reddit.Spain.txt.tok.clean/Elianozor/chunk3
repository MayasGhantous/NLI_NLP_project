  not at all , but i can think of many countries that have killed way more people in the 20th century such as the united states , china 's people republic , japan , russia/soviet union , the united kingdom , france , germany , austria-hungary and the ottoman empire/turkey , israel , several african countries ( rwandan genocide anyone ? ) . 
  but we must all follow the reddit trend that spain is the most evil country in the world and all other big countries and empires were very benevolent ... 
  really ? 
  if you had said since the 16th century you 'd have a point but since you 're only talking about the 20th century i 'm gon na call bullshit on that . 
  it 's not us who got involved in the two world wars , nuked hiroshima and nagasaki or got into a pointless war in vietnam where we were utterly humiliated . 
   edit : lol downvoted for stating the truth . 
  stay strong in your hispanophobia , reddit . 
  i know right ? 
  please , tell me forocoches is n't behind this ... 
  what island ? 
  well our summer days are actually longer than the rest of europe bar scandinavia . 
  plus with 45 \u00b0 c or so around 15:00 and 16:00 . 
   we ** trabajamos ** from 9 to 18 . 
  get up at 7 , 1 hour for breakfast , 1 hour to get to work , 1 hour for lunch , home at 19 , 1 hour for dinner , 3 hours of * tv e internet * . 
  ftfy . 
  what if it 's spain that gets it right and it 's the rest of europe that does everything earlier than it should be ? 
  lol most of us ca n't really sleep siesta . 
  the only ones who can enjoy them are little children , the elderly and northern european `` ex-pats '' . 
   * beja --  pacense * pacense * is the demonym for people from badajoz in the other side of the border . 
  well , they 're stupid so it 's quite obvious they 'd believe everyone is like them . 
  * corrida * for those who do n't speak spanish can mean * bullfight * and * cum * , it 's all about the context . 
  because i said it 's name in spanish , and some took it as pro-argentina propaganda . 
  shhhh do n't you know this is reddit . 
  melilla , ceuta and the canary islands are god 's gift to morocco and have been moroccan since before the big bang , just like gibraltar is british , olivenza and galicia are portuguese and catalonia and basque country are independent and spain had the worst and cruelest empire ever because `` muh gold '' or `` muh 6399374929374 aztecs slaughtered by cort\u00e9s every 0.00000000000000006 milliseconds '' ... 
  that was only the new territories . 
  proper hong kong was given in perpetuity after the first opium war . 
  in spanish , it 's islas malvinas or las malvinas . 
  of course , this does n't imply you support argentina 's stance , but some chileans/mexicans will refer to them as islas falklands or las falklands to piss off the argies ( pan-latin american banter , mostly ) . 
  most spanish-speaking countries officially support argentina 's stance with the notable exception of chile that helped britain in the falklands war , but anyway who cares about some dozen irrelevant shitholes like spain , argentina , mexico , colombia , venezuela , peru ... ?? 
  tl ; dr : islas malvinas is the proper name in spanish and using it does n't really mean you support argentina , but using islas falklands means you support britain . 
  you were n't so courageous about hong kong , were you ? 
   ceuta and melilla belonged firstly to portugal ( year 1425 ) and then to us , never ever to marruecos . 
  and if i want to be a little twisted i could say that they belonged to the spanish muslims since around year 937 . 
  ceuta was conquered by portugal , but melilla was never portuguese . 
  yup , we have no problem with tourists as long as they bring their euromonies with them . 
  it 's not fast . 
  they 're just andalusian * canis * . 
  many spanish accents sound like lightspeed to non natives . 
  here you have a [ representation of the ( uneducated ) chilean accent .

  the sultanate of andaluc\u00eda strikes again . 
   portugal and italy are unbeatable for coffee though . 
  true . 
  it 's kind of depressing as a spaniard coming back from having had world class coffee in portugal and italy and realise most * coffee * in spain is more worthy of being called `` dirty water '' than actual `` coffee '' . 
  spain : the mediterranean coast + the canary islands are flooded with tourists , so not overlooked at all . 
  the northern coast + the interior is really overlooked and underrated , other than madrid and to a lesser extent bilbo/bilbao and donostia/san sebasti\u00e1n . 
  i will never stop saying that spain is europe 's most overrated country and yet the most underrated at the same time , tourism-wise . 
  * gitanos * in spanish . 
  great minds think alike and all that . 
  that 's why we make up for it by speaking really fast . 
  spanish has a lot of tenses and irregular verbs , but that 's pretty typical for a romance language . 
  i 'd say one thing where non-native speakers always get caught is using indicative when it should be subjunctive , and the difference between * ser * and * estar * seems to be pretty hard for a non-native to get . 
  phonetically , our language is simple but for some reason english-native speakers always make it more difficult than it is ( pa-blow instead of pablo ) . 
  but it does n't matter because we make up for it by speaking at speed-light ( this one 's especially true for chileans and caribbeans ) . 
  oh , and also for some weird reason , non-native speakers who learn one spanish variant ( e. g. mexican spanish ) find other accents and variants so hard to understand . 
  envy ? 
  is that what y' all feel in winter while we 're having around 20 \u00b0 c and you guys are freezing ? 
  hmm interesting . 
  can i join too even if i 'm straight as fuck ? 
  we should export them to the rest of europe , just like britain does with their chavs and romania does with their gypsies . 
  have you ever thought about that ? 
  oh , thank you . 
  i did n't even know until you said it , thanks for enlightening me . 
  but seriously , we are not part of the iberian peninsula , but socially , culturally and economically we 're part of iberia , along with the balearic islands , madeira and a\u00e7ores islands . 
   despite all the racism i see on the internet towards spaniards , i feel proud of my community . 
  damn . 
  proud . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no5hxgwobte ), 
  why do n't we all accept the cold truth that everyone makes fun of iberia and thinks of us as losers , waiters and western europe 's cheap holiday resort ? 
  the sooner all 46 million spaniards and 10 million portuguese can accept this , the sooner we 'll reach eternal nirvana . 
  it 's our culture and you should respect it you fucking guiri !!!!!, 
  the fact that their language has many sounds completely unknown to us and our language is so painfully simple does n't help , either . 
  brits , not even close . 
  germans as a distant yet solid second , and dutch as a third . 
  also , i 've found my countrymen can be annoying and loud as fuck abroad . 
  and curiously enough , russian and chinese tourists seem to have a bad reputation in europe but are very welcome here ( especially russians ) . 
  do n't listen to them glorious reich . 
  remember : [ they see me rollin ' , ] ( http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080814093757/althistory/images/archive/a/a5/20080814185110!nazi_nukes_wi_map.jpg ) [ they hatin ' .

   if you 're from a spanish family i get it that you actually mean hispanic , right ? 
  because they 're two different things , even if the spanish are hispanic . 
  i would like to watch it but i have an eurovision trauma so i ca n't really watch it unless against my will . 
  can someone tell me how the show is going nowadays ? 
  it 's still full of transvestites , drag queens and wtf songs as i remember it , or is it producing something close to decent music ? 
  last thing i heard is that they 're letting australia participating . 
  last time i watched ( and that 's where my trauma comes from ) was 2008 , i guess it changed a bit in 8 years . 
  not really , just we have no such party ( democracia nacional and espa\u00f1a 2000 are jokes ) . 
  perhaps it 's because we have had to put up with a right-wing dictator for 40 years so we 're more wary about right-wing populists . 
  the same applies to left-wing populists in countries that have had left-wing dictatorships . 
  most of those russians see the soviet union as the continuation of the russian empire after 1917 , so of course you 'd find russians that are a bit nostalgic . 
  just like any country that had an empire . 
  germany is a bit of an exception here but you ca n't blame them . 
  being proud of any evil things any empire or superpower did at any time in history is reichdiculous , to say the least . 
  i 'd move there too . 
  the only awkward thing would be seeing a chick i have already seen in some ... errr ... videos . 
  my experience in 4chan , youtube comments and other sites around the internet tells me they refer to people from fyrom as `` monkeydonians '' . 
  come on man , it 's not like we have tried to anschluss all of the iberian peninsula , slaughtering millions of native americans and breeding with millions of native american women in the meantime ... ^ / s, 
  as a spaniard , i do n't take being called `` eastern portuguese '' * badly . 
  in fact , i 'd consider it a compliment . 
  now go across the border and start refering to portuguese as `` western spaniards '' .
