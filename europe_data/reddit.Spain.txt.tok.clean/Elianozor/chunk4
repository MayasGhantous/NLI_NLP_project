  they all get so butthurt about it . 
  one of the reasons that reminds me the spain-portugal rivalry is very one sided . 
  * : `` northern moroccan '' or `` euromexicans '' on the other hand ... http://www.younomad.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/hacha.gif, 
  yes , it is . 
  it 's not unheard of actually , but uncommon . 
  they carry two as well because , well , they 're spanish * . 
  in fact the most common surnames in catalonia and valencia are shared with the rest of spain , even if they have some catalan surnames which can be found in the rest of spain . 
  for example , bernab\u00e9u which was the surname of a real madrid president and manager ( and the real madrid stadium is named after him ) is a catalan surname . 
  the same applies to basques . 
  * even if quite a few catalans are trying to change this . 
  well , it 's not like my parents are siblings . 
  less sarcastic than you might think . 
  like all spaniards i have two surnames ( the other one is kinda uncommon though ) . 
  seeing how bad british cuisine is , it 's not like they need one . 
  or czech republic ( czechout ) .

  i watched it when i was a kid ( ok not so young more like a teen ) and [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfjhjnevone ) came up . 
  i had nightmares for several months . 
  never again !, 
  can confirm . 
  one of my surnames is garc\u00eda . 
   many south and central americans do not speak english . 
  and you forgot the biggest spanish-speaking country in the world which is in north america . 
   and maybe italian or spanish , because if you know one you kinda know the other , and many people across the world speak one of those . 
  surely you meant portuguese instead of italian ? 
  i was about to put this one but decided to keep it nationwide . 
  yes . 
  of course language immersion is the best way to actually learn any language and you 'd have to move to china , taiwan or singapore for that . 
  latin americans ? 
  not so much . 
  and most who move to europe are in spain and portugal anyway . 
  some latin american ( not south american , after all the biggest spanish-speaking country in the world is in north america ) are growing economically . 
  okay , they are not china , but they 're a big emerging market . 
   spanish . 
  it 's one of the largest languages in the world and they are pretty terrible at english in spain . 
  not only in spain , they tend to be terrible at english in most of the spanish-speaking world . 
  the spanish-speaking country where they are most proficient in english is argentina , go figure !, 
  soooo many beautiful deep songs in spanish and all non-spanish speakers know is the trash . 
   hue ... hue you have just learned all the portuguese you need to know while you 're in huelidays in portugal or brazil . 
  if romania , bulgaria , almost all of central-eastern europe , indochina and all of canada is included in `` french worldwide '' , you might as well include all of the usa , philippines , western sahara and the portuguese-speaking world in `` spanish worldwide '' . 
  plus , your maps include equatorial guinea as french-speaking but not as spanish-speaking . 
  the maps seem very cherrypicked overall . 
  you 're correct , amigo . 
  if that 's the case , should n't we all be learning chinese ? 
   also in countries like morocco you learn french instead of english weird because all moroccans i know ( and i know quite a few ) used to learn english in morocco to the point that they can hold a conversation ( okay , not as fluent as they speak spanish , and they all speak both french and arabic natively , however they prefered to talk among themselves in arabic ) it is the default lingua franca everywhere , i mean the chances of finding someone who speaks english in morocco are higher than the chances of finding someone who speaks french in zambia . 
  and if we take it to a neutral field , the chances of finding someone who speaks english in thailand ( okay , narrow , plus asians tend to have a horrible accent ) are way higher than finding a french-speaking thai . 
   if we 're including `` the western hemisphere '' then spanish is massively more useful than french , and it is n't even remotely close . 
  now that i think of it , it 's true . 
  even portuguese surpasses french . 
   i 'm also really baffled by your `` tier '' system in general . 
  italian is as useful as russian , more useful than spanish and less useful than french or german ? 
  this sounds completely arbitrary . 
  i 'd say russian is more useful than italian and both french and german are more useful than italian ( and russian ) . 
  but yes , within europe , italian is more useful than spanish . 
  switzerland has an italian-speaking canton ( ticino ) and many people around the adriatic sea ( slovenia , croatia , montenegro , albania , greece ) can speak italian , and i guess it 's pretty useful in malta too . 
  meanwhile spanish has the curse of being spoken at the very corner of europe and it 's only official in spain ( in some regions , co-official ) . 
  edit : grammar . 
  english is the lingua franca by default . 
  if french is tier 1 in africa , chinese is tier 1 in asia and spanish is tier 1 in america . 
  i have to agree with you there . 
  but between kalimotxo and sangr\u00eda i choose kalimotxo 11 times out of 10 . 
  not really . 
  either german or french would be 3rd ( the other one of these two languages would be second ) . 
  russian 4th and italian 5th . 
  in europe : tier 1 : english tier 2 : french/german tier 3 : italian/russian ( i 'd put russian in tier 2.5 though ) tier 4 : spanish/polish/romanian / portuguese/greek tier 5 : catalan/serbocroamontebosnian/hungarian / galician/basque tier 6 : turkish/arabic/urdu / hindi/chinese/japanese tier 7 : norswedanish/dutch i put scandinavian languages and dutch in the lowest tier because they all speak english quite well ( better than many natives ) in africa : tier 1 : english tier 2 : french/arabic/portuguese tier 3 : afrikaans/german/swahili / spanish tier 4 : amharic/somali/minor african languages in america : tier 1 : english tier 2 : spanish/portuguese tier 3 : french/dutch in asia : tier 1 : english tier 2 : chinese/japanese/arabic tier 3 : korean/persian/russian tier 4 : indomalay/vietnamese/thai / tagalog/hindi/urdu in oceania : tier 1 : english tier 2 : french tier 3 : polynesian languages, 
  `` if you ai n't dutch , you ai n't much . '', 
  that 's cancer . 
  kalimotxo/calimocho is where it 's at . 
  the question says in europe . 
  so after english it 's a tie between french and german . 
  russian and italian come after those and spanish is at the same tier as polish , romanian or portuguese are . 
  now if we include the western hemisphere spanish and portuguese are up there with english and french . 
   i read somewhere ( so take this with a grain of salt ) that females from canary islands have a 40 % of guanche/berber ancestry while males have only a 15-20 % . 
  not really . 
  it 's true that most of us who have a little guanche ancestry got it from some guanche women that had thousands of crazy nights with the spaniards , but nowadays you can find guanche ancestry pretty much everywhere . 
  in tenerife or gran canaria it 's found to a lesser extent but in remote islands like la gomera or el hierro , guanche ancestry is more commonly found . 
   basically they went there , killed all the men and fucked the native guanches . 
  classic spanish behaviour . 
  it 's the same nowadays in erasmus and other exchange programs . 
  however this time it 's the local men who want to kill the spanish ( and italian ) men for trying to take all the women , lol . 
  that makes no sense . 
   half moroccan  half moroccan  half moroccan  half moroccan  half moroccan do you want to get a bomb exploding at your home ?? 
  because that 's how you get a bomb exploding at your home !, 
  seeing your lack of ability to write simple spanish words , no you 're not my irm\u00e3o . 
  canada is just the us on standby mode . 
  my experience as a spanish native speaker . 
  i have satellite tv at home so i decided to give it a try . 
  i watched rai ( italian tv broadcaster ) and rtp ( portuguese tv broadcaster ) for an hour . 
  i started with rai and thought `` wow this sounds so similar to spanish . 
  this gon na be good '' but as the time went by , i noticed lots of false friends , totally different words and i ended up understanding less than i thought i could . 
  then i switched to rtp and unlike italian , it sounded so weird , almost as if it had no vowels . 
  my first thought was `` wtf is this ? 
  could n't they pronounce their damn vowels ? '', 
  but you kinda get used to hear the subtle closed vowels ( this is really an art to master ) and once you get this , the nasal sounds and the different sounds ( r or j ) portuguese comes easy . 
  of course , there are totally different words and false friends , but not to the same level of spanish-italian . 
  conclusion : spanish and italian share much , but not all , of its phonology ( italian geminate consonants/spanish c/z/j anyone ? ) . 
  spanish and portuguese , even though they share more with each other than either does with italian , could n't sound more different . 
  and its phonemic system is richer than spanish which is a painfully simple language when it comes to phonology , that 's why portuguese speakers can understand us but for the most part we ca n't understand them . 
  but if you pay attention and get practise , understanding portuguese as a spanish speaker might be easier than you first thought .
