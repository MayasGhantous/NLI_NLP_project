  have an upvote , fratello . 
   national average : 11,3 % fookin ' amateurs i tell ya . 
   i was amazed going into restaurants and having the waiters refuse to speak spanish to me , menus only in galician etc just wait till nationalism gains momentum in andalusia and the waiters refuse to speak spanish and menus come only in * andal\u00fa * . 
  [ sorry , i felt a strong need to put this here .

  spain 's best contribution to the world in the 21th century . 
  absolutely brilliant . 
  oops . 
  small mistake . 
  turkish influence is bosnia and arabic influence in andalusia is what i meant . 
  a bosnian friend of mine ( well , more like acquaintance ) who lives here told me that 's the stereotype , and it reminded me about the galician stereotype . 
  wait ... [ it did n't ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish\u2013lithuanian_commonwealth ), 
   i do n't even understand why we 're two countries . 
  it was originally part of the united provinces of r\u00edo de la plata but got annexed by brazil in 1817 and the united provinces declared war on brazil to get back the eastern province/cisplatina . 
  but the war ended with the [ treaty of montevideo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_montevideo_ ( 1828 ) in which uruguay got its independence with british mediation . 
  so you could even say uruguay as an independent political entity is a british invention . 
  i like macri a lot btw , he seems promising so far . 
  except us since we 're more similar to puerto rico and we 'd join them asking to be the 51 and 52 us states . 
  we ` murica now . 
  want some freedom \u2122 ? 
  and estonia gets cheated on by finland with sweden . 
  it 's a vicious circle . 
   the germans . . man . . 
  they are not like any other country . 
  they have n't felt the need to anschluss every one of their neighbours at some point in history . 
  that 's why they are different to their linguistical brethren to the north . 
  spain can also apply ( kind of ) : serbia-castile : both were/are the dominant regions in their own realms ( serbia-yugoslavia and castile-spain ) croatia-catalonia : both were/are industrialised regions and the sea is important for both of them . 
  plus they were/are the second region after serbia-castile . 
  slovenia-basque country : both were/are the most industrialised regions and have the highest living standards . 
  fyrom-galicia : both of them have strong ties to their `` other neighbours '' ( fyrom-bulgaria and galicia-portugal ) and their languages are more similar to bulgarian and portuguese respectively . 
  also macedonians and galicians are stereotyped as mentally slow people . 
  bosnia and herzegovina-andalusia : both have arabic influence and pretty damn high unemployment rates even for balkan/iberian standards . 
  plus they have the peasant stereotype . 
  montenegro-canary islands ( andalusia may also apply for montenegro but i decided to pair it up with bosnia ) : we both are stereotyped as very lazy , but no one can resist when it comes to holidaying at our beaches lol . 
  kosovo-asturias/le \u00f3n : kosovo is considered the cradle of serbia , asturias and le\u00f3n are considered the cradle of spain . 
  i can kinda explain : chile and uruguay are more stable and safer than the rest . 
  joining colombia , mexico , argentina , venezuela , peru and the rest would mean we would have the same problems they have . 
  and no way the eu would like territories where dozens of persons are killed every week and beheadings are not uncommon ( looking at mexico , colombia , venezuela , el salvador and honduras ) to be part of the union . 
   get your greedy little thoughts off of argentine territory . 
  tell that to your dad , ` murica .

  twin : argentina . 
  i mean , just notice the parallelisms ( malvinas/gibraltar , portuguese-speaking neighbour , our neighbours consider us loud and arrogant . 
  plus the country with most argentines outside argentina is spain and the country with most spaniards outside spain is argentina ) . 
  best ally : we 've never had allies . 
  back when we were a strong country , we had enemies everywhere , but no allies . 
  nowadays our relations with mexico are pretty healthy ( other latin american countries are too infested by populism ) but that 's about it . 
  what country would i join : i culturally feel very close to cuba and quite a few of them would probably prefer being a * comunidad aut\u00f3noma * than being ruled by the castro brothers . 
  but cuba is nowadays a hellhole ( thanks to 56 years of communism ) and they 'd be a burden for the state . 
  plus most of them would rather join the us anyway . 
  economically , i 'd join andorra , really . 
  we could set the capital in andorra la vella and have catalan as the official language if they wish . 
  fun fact : the word * pasta * is used in spain as a slang for * money * as well . 
  so yes , you have more of the two kinds of * pasta * . 
  well , only in the north . 
  plus our countries already joined into one . 
  it 's called argentina .

  - ande yo caliente , r\u00edase la gente ( somewhat literal .

  * when the rooster does n't sing , it has something in the throat * ) : used in a situation where someone does n't tell us what 's going on , as if they were hiding something from us .

  * the one who went to seville , lost his chair * ) : someone goes somewhere far away for a long time and when he comes back everything has changed . 
  * in the country of the blind , the one-eyed man is the king * ) : we all have defects , but the one who has the least defects is better off than the rest . 
  * some are born with a star , others are born starred * ) : the verb * estrellarse * means to crash . 
  the saying 's meaning is while some are very lucky in life , others have very bad luck . 
  * get a fame and go to sleep * ) : when you get a reputation , it 's almost impossible to get rid of it . 
  note : some of these are used in all the spanish-speaking world . 
  so they 're not really specific to spain either . 
  not so much . 
  it has cooled down a bit but in the 2000s it was a serious issue .
