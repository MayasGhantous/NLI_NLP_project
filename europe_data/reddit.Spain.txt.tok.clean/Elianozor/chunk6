  meanwhile during the last decade catalan independentism was minoritary but it has gained strength since 2010 . 
   high quality of play tbh most spanish and german teams ( even those who are not real madrid/bar \u00e7a / bayern/atl \u00e9tico ) could wipe the floor with most premier league sides . 
  more exciting ? 
  yes , because the team quality is more equal . 
  but german/spanish clubs are technically superior to english teams . 
  and also one more thing i may add : marketing . 
  the bpl has successfully sold itself as a brand , while the bundesliga brand is scarce and liga bbva has no brand at all . 
  it 's all about messi , neymar , su\u00e1rez , cristiano ronaldo , real madrid and fc barcelona . 
  that 's why i 'd say liga bbva is incredibly underrated and overrated at the same time . 
  yes i know . 
  in fact all of iberia should have gmt . 
  it 's all franco and hitler 's fault . 
  portugal has gmt while galicia has gmt +1 just like the rest of mainland spain . 
  it 's not a disaster but most of europe ( other than mainland spain and scandinavia ) is n't really used to have the sun still there at 10pm . 
  it 's an issue on whether you are used to it or not . 
  birds shall prevail !, 
  remove human filth !, 
  not really . 
  portugal and canary islands are in the right time zone . 
  mainland spain , france and benelux should change their time to gmt , and anything east of that ( germany , switzerland , austria , italy ) is already on the right time zone ( gmt +1 ) . 
  not really . 
  we also eat dinners later than the rest of europe in the canary islands and we have gmt . 
  it 's more a cultural thing than anything else . 
  could n't have said it better . 
  this . 
  also deep rural brazil looks uncannily similar to deep rural south east asia . 
  i 've had my biggest fails in these ones . 
  i 've just clicked and got somewhere in the antarctic claimed by argentina ( la ant\u00c1rtida es argentinaaaaaaaa ) . 
   but venice was already dealing with arabs since they already conquered egypt , se she was removing 1gen kebabs . 
  do you have any source for that ? 
  because i have tried to [ look it up ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_venice ) and the first time arabs are mentioned is this :  around 841 , the republic of venice sent a fleet of 60 galleys ( each carrying 200 men ) to assist the byzantines in driving the arabs from crotone , but it failed . 
  [ unfortunately we had n't kicked them all out until 1492 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emirate_of_granada ) so we were a bit late for the constantinople party but this time it was not because of siesta . 
  when the reconquista started the turks were still somewhere between the steppes and the caucasus . 
  and do n't get me started on how venice betrayed the byzantine empire ... 
  do n't forget about us , we were the first kebab removers . 
  [ look . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_covadonga ) [ we have more . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_simancas ) [ still more . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_puig ) [ even more . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_r\u00edo_salado ) [ can we now ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_las_navas_de_tolosa ) [ are you not entertained ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_lepanto ) [ come on , please ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_cape_corvo ) [ okay , this should settle it for once . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_cape_celidonia ), 
   and in the coast lots of british . 
  here in tenerife italians/portuguese/french come to santa cruz while brits/germans/dutch / scandinavians go to the southern coast of the island . 
   i must say that this feels right for madrid . 
  there is lots of people from ecuador . 
  lived in madrid for 2 years and man , can confirm , the amount of ecuadorians was crazy . 
  i 'd be lead to believe there are more ecuadorians in madrid only than there are ecuadorians in germany , uk and france put together . 
  what municipality is the small spanish flag ( the only one may i add ) a bit more north of brussels ? 
  only around buenos aires province and other big cities like rosario , mendoza , c\u00f3rdoba , the rest of the country ( especially as you get closer to bolivia ) starts getting darker skin colour on average . 
  for example , ag\u00fcero is from buenos aires but his parents are from tucum\u00e1n in northwestern argentina , and around those regions most people do look like him . 
  i am more southern than any of you silly mainlanders . 
  buuut here we go : portugal : okay i get it we had a strong rivalry until the 19th century , but we have grown out of it while you 're still stuck there . 
  no need to distrust , my beloved shit rectangle . 
  we have changed . 
  plus your food is top notch ( bacalhau , francesinha , past\u00e9is de bel\u00e9m ... ) . 
  p. s. : sorry for the obnoxious spanish tourists you get . 
  it 's saddening how they start shouting so loud you can hear them from badajoz , but always in spanish , while you guys go out of your way to cater to them . 
  ( fellow spaniards : ok i get that most portuguese can understand spanish , but at least an * obrigado * is a must when in portugal . 
  it is n't too much to ask , is it ? ), 
  france : you are cool and shit but for some reason most spaniards dislike the shit out of you . 
  just like with portugal , the spain-france rivalry is very one-sided but in this case it 's spaniards who hold all the hatred and prejudices towards the french . 
  but it fucking hurts how much you have going on with your other neighbours ( claiming swiss french is fake french , laughing at belgian stupidity , mocking brits and germans and arguing with italians about food , culture ... ) but you do n't give a fuck about us . 
  ** #thepyreneesalsoexist ** italy : your country is a godsend in all senses . 
  i can certainly understand why you get a bit whiny abroad , especially about food . 
  however , you guys are everywhere . 
  i know at least a dozen italians living in santa cruz de tenerife and they integrate pretty quickly , one of them is a 60-year-old dude from campania who owns an italian restaurant ( we have a few other italian restaurants but their staff is made up of spaniards/cubans/argies / romanians/moroccans/chinese ) and according to them , an italian restaurant is n't italian unless it is run by italians and its food is cooked by italians . 
  we 're so similar `` on the surface '' yet so different when you ditch these similarities ( you have this cool flamboyant vibe you share with france , we have the rough kinda melancholic self-hatred thing that pairs us up with portugal . ), 
  and even though loads of things may be found all over the internet that would make anyone believe we hate each other , in real life we bros. . we share a small yet intense sport rivalry even if it 's not to the point of italy vs france/germany or spain vs france/netherlands rivalries . 
  [ relevant . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2div26-jqs ) [ also relevant . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdm0qbmufls ) ex-yugos : you guys are the best europeans because europe was founded on wars and hatred . 
  that 's the true european spirit and while the rest of us live in dreamland 's world where everyone is friends with each other and there are flowers everywhere , you guys keep the spirit alive and well . 
  also your language ( s ) is/are the only slavic language ( s ) i can stand . 
  greece : we love you because you 're more similar to us than either of us would care to admit . 
  i mean , while the french have their lunch at midday , the italians and portuguese have it at 1pm , we have no time to have lunch , we can endure until 3pm easily while the rest of europeans would almost starve . 
  you have given us the foundation of europe even if merkel or sch\u00e4uble do n't know it ( or do n't want to know ) . 
  buuuuuut we hate you for taking the # 1 of unemployment rates of the eu though . 
  / s also , most of / r/europe is gon na hate me for this but i will include them : turkey : please come make authentic turkish kebab . 
  since there are very very few turks in spain , most kebab stores are owned by pakis or moroccans and while their kebab is delicious and all that , whenever i go to germany and eat kebab made by turks i go to heaven . 
  please kick out that islamist dumbass called erdogan , he is a danger for the international community , but even more for your country . 
  favs : basque , turkish , greek , albanian , serbian/croatian/bosnian / montenegrin/whatever-you-want - to-call-it , armenian , persian , japanese . 
  least favs : any language that has the guttural r on its phonetical system gets on my fucking nerves . 
  ( french , german , european portuguese , danish , some dutch/norwegian/swedish dialects ) , plus arabic because it sounds just plain disgusting . 
  i doubt it , but the best way is to try it yourself . 
  [ here 's the episode 1 ( season 1 ) . 
  ] ( http://www.rtve.es/television/ministerio-del-tiempo/capitulos-completos/temporada-1/capitulo-1/ ) just watch it for the first 20-25 minutes and find out if you can understand enough to follow the rest of the series . 
  hope this helps . 
  i am one of the harshest critics of spanish series/tv shows . 
  but damn , this one 's good . 
  indeed , but mr. kim is always trying to draw everyone 's attention to his benevolent actions while mr. gurbanguly is way humbler . 
   hey the last time we send those `` able , young men '' to spain ** franco and friends ** pretty much thanked us afterwards ... ftfy . 
  we wo n't . 
  both of us have great benefits being united . 
  you have more clay , and in exchange we can say we 're part of europe . 
  good business . 
  does this mean we can into independence ? 
  `` because it 's ** chapo ** time .
