  any last words ? '', 
  i do wonder what spain would be like with trump as a pm . 
  someone knows . 
  however , gurbanguly berdimuhamedow seems also very commited to his country . 
  i do n't know which one i would eventually vote . 
  interesting . 
  they also resemble scots more than italians physically , but have italian-sounding last names . 
  i 've also read about a turkish village in northern italy too ( friuli-venezia giulia maybe ?? ), 
  where they have dowry and still kind of mantain their ties to turkey . 
  but i 'm sure an italian redditor knows better . 
  we have been living in a political clusterfuck of a country since somewhere around the 18th century , we are used to it now . 
  not exactly from madeira but the canary islands at the moment . 
  madeira has a similar weather but a bit rainier . 
  it 's good because you save up money on winter clothes , it 's bad because your benchmark is too high ( 10 \u00b0 c becomes `` freezing cold '' ) . 
  europe will never have english as a lingua franca for all europeans as long as france and spain are part of it . 
  it 's one of the cons of speaking a big language . 
  however i actually think the french can speak english better than they are believed to , just that they refuse to do so and go for french instead . 
  now with spaniards the case is even more facepalm worthy . 
  we ( i mean the general population ) ca n't speak english , and do n't seem to want to . 
  funny thing is seeing a significant number of nationalistic , right-wing spaniards being all proud and shit of the growing number of spanish speakers in the us ( illegals included ) and whining about trump all the time , when they want all muslims to be deported from spain/europe ( even the legal ones ) and adore le pen , orb\u00e1n and the like . 
   it helped a lot . 
  : ^  ftfy . 
  yep , i have noticed they are the same ones for bosnia . 
  plus both countries ( spain and bosnia herzegovina ) have a lyricless anthem and both national football teams lost their first two games in world cup 2014 , winning the third one when they were already out . 
  how many goals did spain/bosnia score in that third ( 3rd ) game ? 
  how many sides does the illuminati triangle have ? 
  spain and bosnia = illuminati confirmed . 
  let 's see ... we all speak spanish however our spanish is more similar to the one they speak in caracas , san juan or havana ( or miami , if you want to get greedy  than to the spanish they speak in madrid , sevile and barcelona ( i know they speak catalan in barcelona , but they speak spanish flawlessly albeit with a slight catalan accent ) . 
  also , the `` indigenous '' peoples of the canary islands were related to the berbers and spoke a language close to amazigh , but not much is left apart from some place and person names . 
  however , many canarians are of indigenous ancestry , including myself ( i have castilian , asturian and basque ancestry too ) . 
  we do n't have maghrebi arabic influence . 
  in fact even though the indigenous peoples were closely tied to the berbers , we have less ties to arabs than mainland spaniards . 
  i mean , we were never part of al andalus . 
  but we have lots of moroccan and subsaharan african ( senegalese , malian , mauritanian , nigerian , equatoguinean ) immigrants here , along with latin americans and other europeans . 
  hope my answer helped you somehow . 
   i call on the ** socialist ** and ** ciudadanos ** parties to summon the courage for a catalan referendum now hehehe ... good luck with that . 
  you 'll need it . 
  spain : - corrupt and inept politicians . 
  - unemployment . 
  - separatisms . 
  they were not really celts , but more like a blend between iberians ( who were in the southeast and east , except tartessos ) and celts ( which were in the north and northwest , except the vascones ) . 
  [ more complete source . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pre-roman_peoples_of_the_iberian_peninsula ), 
   true , but it 's ok as long as it 's not khalifat . 
  true that . 
   by the way , life long leader of montenegro is perfectly democratic to eu and usa . 
  i do n't consider that democratic either , i do n't care what usa/eu official position is like . 
  just like kosovo . 
  so basically bar kyrgyzstan all of them are very undemocratic ( having life-long presidents does n't quite translate into democracy ), 
  so it was just a joke ? 
  i feel guilty now . 
  at the same time i wonder what joke you would come up with if it was britain instead . 
   old colony not really though . 
  i mean many of them are pretty pissed off about the colonial times but not enough to that point ( all of them have dual citizenship agreements with spain , including cuba ) , but for example if you want to travel from northern/eastern europe to an obscure irrelevant country in latin america ( e. g. paraguay , nicaragua , guatemala , cuba , etc ) you will surely have the connection at madrid-barajas . 
  it 's the good thing about cultural connections + being in europe 's southwestern corner . 
  however , it has its cons too , as travelling to east/south east asia/australia/oceania from spain becomes a pain in the ass . 
  inca kola is a gift from the heavens ( or pachamama , depends on how you look at it ) . 
  luckily enough thanks to the large peruvian community in spain it 's not very hard to find it . 
  it does n't work that way though . 
  the chart is about number of countries you can travel visa free , not which ones . 
  i mean there may be some country where spaniards do n't need visa bit swedes and germans do while there may be 4 countries where germans can travel visa free but spaniards ca n't . 
  i 'd like to see a complete list for all eu countries . 
  exactly . 
  i 've heard that central asia may be the most undemocratic region of the world . 
  turkmenistan being miles ahead of the others ( near north korea levels ) , but uzbekistan is pretty bad as well . 
  why did n't i take the nsfl advice seriously ? 
  i ca n't sleep now . 
  still better than turkey . 
  northern italy is part of the blue banana and is the reason why italy is such an industrial powerhouse ( third wealthiest country in the eurozone , g8 and g20 member ) . 
  sardinia + southern italy may come to join the dark side of the force though as i 've heard their unemployment rates are high enough . 
  i 'd love to see the canary islands included , we would get quite a few red points too ( not as many as galicia , catalonia or france though ), 
  i think they 're not even counting us because they 're tired of seeing spain-greece and rest of the eurozone gap . 
  the problem is it 's only two countries doing the dirty job ( no pun intended ) for the rest of the eurozone . 
  so a spaniard started the black legend ? 
  that 's ... pretty fitting actually . 
  puxa asturies !, 
  remove moros !, 
  three thoughts : - french and german are by far , the biggest languages after english . 
  - for spain , i do n't know who they asked , but most spaniards will learn ( or try to learn ) like a dozen languages before even considering learning chinese . 
  i 'd say french , german as third , italian as fourth , portuguese as fifth and , if you want to go with the non-european/exotic languages , i 'd put arabic before chinese . 
  just because we 're the only country in the eu with a land border to an arab country and 700,000 moroccans live here . 
  - wow , spanish has gotten quite a lot of shit on this thread . 
  and to all those that seem puzzled by sweden choosing spanish after english , i have this theory : from what i 've heard , swedes consume lots of american media since they are kids , right ? 
  so maybe , they actually find spanish the second most important language after english thanks to the american media they are exposed to . 
  and it 's even funnier because what 's known today as * euskadi * ( basque country , the most distinct part of the country , perhaps even more than catalonia ) was actually part of the kingdom of castile . 
   i would n't say scapegoat , but many catalans believe their society would improve by simply not being part of spain . 
  this happened in the viceroyalties in the americas 200 years ago , they realised that independence from spain alone would n't make the newly formed republics world superpowers and they started to blame spain `` it 's the legacy spain left us . 
  shame on you '' . 
  just like dutchmen blame us for belgium not being part of their country , belgians blame us for the mess wallonia is , italians blame us for the mess the southern italy is , and the portuguese blame us for pretty much everything . 
   the dominant region must annex swiftly and thoroughly , and never deal with these deluded and distracting ` secessionist movements ' again . 
  even though this is an arguably dick move to eradicate cultures and languages , france did it and apart from a couple lunatics in corsica , it has worked out wonderfully for them . 
  [ sorry , i have to do this . 
  yea , it 's like we are the argentina of europe ( you know , being second at everything and all that ) . 
  basically all latin languages are retarded dialects of vulgar latin . 
  spqr again ? 
  but this time spqo ( senatus populusque olisiponense ), 
  it 's all lebanon 's ( phoenicians ) , tunisia 's ( carthaginese ) , greece 's ( greeks ) , italy 's ( romans ) , sweden 's ( goths ) and morocco 's ( moors ) fault for not letting native iberians develop their own culture and make ancient iberian cultures die off . 
  i know huehuehue is a pt-br only thing , but the joke would n't be as funny then . 
  plus , you created brazil so you 're the reason huehuehue is a thing in the first place . 
  i sign this too , we should give them oliven\u00e7a and galiza as a trophy for 4 years ... what the fuck ?
