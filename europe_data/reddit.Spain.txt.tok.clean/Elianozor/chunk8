  we should give them everything from oliven\u00e7a to portbou . 
  difference is the only decent nt in the isles is wales , with ireland ( roi ) as a distant yet solid second . 
  iberian peninsula best peninsula . 
  italian , scandinavia , balkan , peloponnese , anatolia , arabian , korean , indochina , malay , labrador and yucatan * peninsulae need to step up their game , seriously . 
  * : yucatan is rightful hispanic clay so does n't really count . 
  you may bankrupt us , but you 'll never have power of jajaja/huehuehue . 
  tell 'em barbarians from beyond the pyrenees irm\u00e3o !, 
  you think this is banter ? 
  just wait till andorra and gibraltar win in the euros in 2020 and 2024 , respectively . 
  they should have done it in brazil 2014 for the rule to make sense . 
  it would be absolutely hilarious seeing portugal win the world cup in brazil . 
  uefa euro 2008 champions : spain uefa euro 2012 champions : spain uefa euro 2016 champions : portugal our countries divided the world among themselves in 1494 , 500 years later they divided europe . 
  should n't catalonia be east spain while we 're at it ? 
  i need to see some redditor from the vatican before i die peacefully . 
  what about our catholic asian son that you guys got custody of in 1898 ? 
  they also seem to love america more than most americans ... 
  troll answer : no one , but from 26 june , venezuela will be our only ally . 
  ** / s the mediterranean sea : does n't complain/bitch/whine or talk shit about us like morocco , gibraltar/britain and portugal do , does n't ignore us like france and italy do , and brings us lots of tourists and their money . 
  as a seemingly obvious curiosity , we are very likely to be the only european country with more ties to mexico than to the us/canada . 
  also we get quite well with the italo-spaniards of south america when they are n't being run by populists . 
  well , we get on well with mexico and chile . 
  argentina as well , as long as they 're not run by populists ... oh , and also thanks to the spanish mass media , we currently have a. . . * special * relationship with venezuela . 
  why ? 
  just to have even more people that do n't want to be spanish ? 
  i am rooting for turkey , croatia and czechia . 
  i mean , we should 've been disqualified after losing to ** georgia ** on tuesday . 
  and if a minnow like georgia can beat us , czechia , turkey and croatia will fucking demolish us . 
  so , since we have less chances of winning the euros than iceland , i 'll also support the irm\u00e3os from beyond badajoz to win the whole thing . 
  b-b-but we have galicians . 
  bitch please ... [ inuktitut ] ( https://media-mediatemple.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/calligaphy246.jpg ) for the win . 
  atlantic ocean ? 
  within europe : andorra , portugal , southern france and italy . 
  if we go farther north , ireland is the country i feel the closest . 
  outside europe : anywhere from mexico and cuba to argentina and chile , except the english , dutch , french antilles , guyana , surinam , french guiana and brazil ( surprisingly enough , i feel very close to portugal but brazil feels a lot more `` foreign '' ) . 
  and at the risk of being called traitor and having the guardia civil coming my home , i think morocco is closer to spain than we would like to admit . 
  so much so that i 'd say morocco is the closest african country to spain in most senses . 
  ^ pls ^ no ^ kill . 
  dude , i knew the french and the italians had a cuisine competition/rivalry . 
  but calling italian cuisine `` a greasy mess '' , really !, 
  * invest in southern spain * is the new * invest in eastern poland * . 
  but the weaker south american countries ( bolivia , venezuela ) would wipe the floor with the weaker european countries ( andorra , san marino , gibraltar , luxembourg ), 
  it 's funny 'cause argentina are current world champions . 
  but yes it 's always argentina , portugal , spain and italy . 
  that pun was so bad it 's spainful . 
  we get `` grazie '' here from time to time , i fully understand and support your struggle . 
  tbh i 'd rather get annexed by portugal than get annexed by france . 
  we do n't need brazilian . 
  we speak mexican which is way more useful in your country huehue . 
  someone get this turk in the eu now !, 
  you silly frenchie , it 's the portuguese who are actually galician . 
  most important rule when you 're from a european country that was formerly an empire : - colonials are always wrong . 
  i 'd choose either greece or ( western ) turkey . 
   nearly no erdogan supporters nearly no turks here , at all . 
  and  90 % of turks live in madrid or barcelona . 
   so i 'm assuming turks have a better image there . 
  yes ... and no . 
  since there are barely turks here ( only like 4,000 turks or so ) , and 95 % of muslims are moroccans , turks just get mistaken for moroccans in spain like we get mistaken for mexicans in the us . 
  plus people have heard about erdogan 's madness , so they just see turkey as an islamic country like all the others , while prior to 2013 turkey had a pretty good image in spain as an example of secularism and european values . 
  ikr what a culture shock !, 
  thank you ukraine for saving europe from the kangaroos !, 
  how could italy give us 12 points ? 
  how can we be lower than the uk ? 
  ca n't we just do a portugal and stop embarassing ourselves like our smart western neighbours ? 
   so i can surrender are you really armenian or french ? 
  two ways to make the uk remain in the eu : - let them be in a high place tonight . 
  - france being last . 
  georgia 's performance will give half of japan seizures then . 
  since we ca n't trust italy to give us points and we ca n't trust portugal or andorra to take part again , can we convince the ebu to invite mexico in for a couple of years \u00e0 la australia ? 
  just wait till the day we 'll see a mustached austrian man in eurovision . 
  come on , make the polandball community proud !, 
  that means that frenchman can speak at least two languages . 
  let me guess ? 
  we 'll give italy 12 points and italy will give us 0 points . 
  as is tradition . 
  that 's a good example of a * self-made man * if you ask me . 
  mother of god the azerbaijani chick is so hot i would go full nagorno-karabakh on her . 
  we do n't have portugal or andorra . 
  we are so screwed lol . 
   i also believe that we are the only ones other than switzerland without guaranteed points , mainly because spain is a poop . 
  hey , we 've given you points when we could . 
  but you obviously need more than one or two countries voting for you to go to the final . 
  do n't worry though , italy does to the same to us anyway . 
  deutschland-senpai notice us !, 
  special us/canada edition : - * your accent sounds foreign . 
  where are you from ? 
  * - * spain . 
  * - ( choose one of these random phrases ) * can you teach me how to make tacos ? 
  * / * so , where in mexico is it ? 
  * / * gtfo you wetback * / * wow , you look too white to be spanish . 
  * the funniest phrase someone in america said to me was during one of my visits to nyc in 2009 : - * so , you guys are italians who speak mexican with a lisp , right ? 
  * and then you may have the luck of finding an american/canadian who knows where spain is but s/he might think we look or are kinda like arabs . 
  so you have to go back to step # 0 . 
  ** espanha forte ** ( olivenza ) and i should be writing arabic or riffian berber for ceuta and melilla but i ca n't be bothered to do it . 
  til we are less european than russia and turkey . 
  you heartless bastard !, 
  actually in spain most of the coffee is brought from colombia and costa rica , not brazil . 
  so true . 
  i mean we may be a coffee loving country , but the quality of coffee in most bars and caf\u00e9s is shit . 
  it really seems you are drinking dirty water rather than coffee . 
  is it weird that i am below average height for my country , but at the same time above average penis size ?
