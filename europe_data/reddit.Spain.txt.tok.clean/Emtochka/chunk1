partially unrelated , but thank you for reminding me of a [ very cool song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptqi9w2b8yq ) from the opera '' [ nixon in china ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nixon_in_china_\\ ( opera \\ ) ) '' . 
  pride flag is best flag .

  the `` discussion '' part is pretty enlightening . 
  [ el mundo today ] ( http://www.elmundotoday.com ) here . 
  it 's regionalism more than nationalism . 
  we do n't want to be with castile . 
  regarding spain ... most people would consider themselves spanish , and others do n't care much . 
  about the effort ... the main `` leonesista '' party , upl ( uni\u00f3n del pueblo leon\u00e9s ) is relatively popular , mainly in le\u00f3n and zamora . 
  more info : [ wiki ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/leonesismo ) and please , the name of the autonomous community is `` castilla y le\u00f3n '' , not `` castilla-le\u00f3n '' as some people say . 
  she should leave her somewhere ... 
  i say this for the kid 's own good . 
  she 's surrounded by too many people of dubious reputation : c edit : dawww, 
  as far as i know , the advice given by paediatricians is `` hard bed '' and `` baby sleeping on his back '' . 
  and on the first months they are not really able to roll over . 
  the question in the survey was : `` do you consider yourself a spaniard '' , and the answer is yes 50 % of the times in the total sample , and 76 % of the children born in spain . 
  thank you for this video !, 
  i did n't remember it at all :d, 
  i am not racist , i am religion-phobic . 
  yes , but it should n't be presented as a triumph ( that 's how this is being paraded here ) . 
  under which conditions ? 
  similar to those in the [ ard amazon reportage ] ( http://www.focus.de/kultur/kino_tv/focus-fernsehclub/tv-kolumne-ausgeliefert-leiharbeit-bei-amazon-jobben-wie-in-china_aid_916143.html ) ? 
  in my opinion , this particular piece of news perfectly illustrates the ungraspable depth of the retardation of the current spanish government . 
  lets gift all that potential workforce to germany and let them train them instead of ... you know , improving the vocational training in spain and potentially doing something to help ourselves . 
  fuck , i 'm so frustrated i want to cry . 
  now [ this sarcastic poster ] ( https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/487644_618010881544034_899092652_n.jpg ) is more relevant than ever . 
  explanation for the non spanish-speakers . 
  the text in the poster says : `` new scholarships for graduates : beca - mbiando de pa\u00eds '' . 
  it 's a wordplay between the word `` beca '' ( which means scholarship ) and the sentence `` ve cambiando de pa\u00eds '' ( start going to a different country ) , whose two first syllables have the same pronunciation as `` beca '' . 
  oh , btw , i found the [ link to the ard video ] ( http://mediathek.daserste.de/sendungen_a-z/799280_reportage-dokumentation/13402260_ausgeliefert-leiharbeiter-bei-amazon ) . 
  it was posted here in / r/europe a while ago . 
  fyi , bagpipe is an instrument found in the traditional music of many regions of spain : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galician_gaita, 
  west classtooth         everything else . 
  never . 
  you can either say on the border with castile and leon or on the border with le\u00f3n , but your choice is incorrect . 
  oh , and just to point out , the sky resorts belongs to le\u00f3n ;d . 
  do it !, 
  go anywhere !, 
  i was in berlin last year and it was a wonderful experience . 
  it was n't a `` party-erasmus '' at all because , as i med-student , i was required to take part in the regular university courses and hospital practise ( obviously an acceptable german level was required - i started with a b1 and came back with a c1 ) . 
  it was like my student life in spain , but on a different country and with waaay more trips . 
  i did everything on a budget of 600 $ to 1000 $ / month ( including rent , internet , mobile phone , party , food , trips , school books , transport , german classes , goethe exam fee , flights from and to spain ... everything ) . 
  it can be made with a tighter budget and of course the scholarship helps ( 250 $ / month in my case ) . 
  as to where to go , you need to consider several factors : * the list your university gives you , and how you compare to other candidates that might also want to go to the same place . 
  do n't pick just one option . 
  * your budget . 
  how much are you spending per month in your home country ? 
  how much money would you receive from your scholarship ? 
  which are the living costs in your country of choice ? 
  can you afford it ? 
  could you afford it in a different country ? 
  * your interests . 
  and here , the only advice i can give you is that all countries are interesting , even if you do n't know much about them . 
  my first summer exchange was to poland , because it was the only option . 
  i was not so excited when i went there , but now i travel to poland regularly to visit the friends i made there , i can speak some polish and i know much more about the country and history . 
  and pierogi . 
  omg . 
  * special requirements ( for example , i had to speak german ) . 
  i know i repeat myself , but go !, 
  do n't stay at home :d, 
  hm , that 's a difficult one . 
  i agree with you , it makes more sense , but i can clearly understand `` que se muera '' . 
   police attacks basque journalist after he identified himself . 
  if we are going to point out that he 's from the basque country , we could also say that those policemen are the basque autonomous police and that this aggression has nothing to do with him being basque . 
  and [ this ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.naiz.info%2fes%2factualidad%2fnoticia%2f20130418%2fun-millar-de-personas-arropa-a-los-jovenes-en-aske-gunea-a-la-espera-de-la-llegada-de-la-ertzaintza ) is the context in which it happened ( google translated article ) . 
  the first was killed . 
  talking about extrovert countries ... nothing like that happened in spain when the perpetrators of the 11-m ( madrid train bombings ) blew themselves up . 
  we just had demonstrations the day after the attacks against terrorism and for the victims . 
  `` it is n't raining ... it 's just tears from madrid '' , `` not everybody 's here , 200 are missing '' , `` everybody was on those trains '' quite differ from the bloodthirsty chants i 've been hearing lately . 
  shhh , shhh , go to sleep . 
  we have extra keys for \u00f1 and \u00e7 and then we write all \u00e1\u00e9\u00ed\u00f3\u00fa , \u00e4\u00eb\u00ef\u00f6\u00fc , \u00e0\u00e8\u00ec\u00f2\u00f9 , \u00e2\u00ea\u00ee\u00f4\u00fb with two or three strokes ( accent + vowels or shift + accent + vowels ) . 
  i 've always found this method more satisfying than having extra keys for all the `` vowels with accessories '' , but i suppose it does n't work that well when you have to write thousands of \u00e4 in a row . 
  it snowed a couple of weeks ago , but it did n't last , because then came the rain . 
  it 's been raining almost non stop ever since .

  sadly our islands are not so conveniently located : c, 
  you kind of prove my point . 
  thanks . 
  i only believe in the statistics that i myself have manipulated .

  i want to see spain a republic . 
  deep fried ? 
  where did you eat , tourist feeders ? 
  but you can only eat it once a day ... because you have to spend the rest of the day recovering from it . 
  or time to return to childhood making some banana-milk-marie biscuits pur\u00e9e :3, 
  [ jawohl :p . ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jueolkeluqy ), 
  hey ... sprich deutsch !, 
  i really like the idea , but i fear the screens would be vandalised . 
  if we keep this going , `` fuzzy '' will be one of the most used words in / r/europe xd edit : but aw , yeah , that . gif is very fuzzy . 
  i would leave that in `` south africa has many problems '' . 
  i was talking about european countries there , maybe i should have specified . 
  i find it disturbing that most of you people from central/northern europe think that spain is very catholic or conservative . 
  i do n't live in any of the big or touristic cities , and nobody flinches when two guys walk hand in had . 
  [ religion in spain ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_spain ) ( wiki ) . 
  i would say that any country with same-sex marriage is generally safe . 
  so get spain in that list .

  wow ... stomach of steel . 
  a big cup of coffee with milk , and two slices of toasted bread with olive oil .
