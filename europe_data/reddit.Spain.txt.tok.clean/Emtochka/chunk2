  i manage to hide my spanish accent quite well . 
  so well that when i was in germany , the first time i met someone new , they would congratulate me with an `` oh , i almost did n't realise you were french '' or something the like . 
  it was pretty confusing for everybody when i explained that i was spanish . 
  maybe i was a bit too overzealous with their `` soft r '' . 
  from the article :  eu law actually stipulates that eggs `` should in general not be refrigerated before sale to the final consumer . '' the final consumer refrigerates it . 
  i always thought that horse meat was more expensive than beef . 
  weird . 
  yes , but i hate it . 
  a mixture of being a spanish speaker and google translate for some words works fine . 
  i 've never tried to translate a whole sentence . 
  but that explains why it 's harder to understand than regular written italian xd . 
  the only thing i do n't like is having to use google translate so often xd, 
  it was in the `` juice '' section in rewe . 
  no , wait . 
  in the `` bio '' juice section xd, 
  i hope [ these dudes ] ( https://www.facebook.com/feudalesimoeliberta ) get serious xd, 
  i even found sauerkrautsaft in rewe . 
  bought it with some other exchange students for shits and giggles , took a sip and almost puked . 
  it became a group joke ... we would buy it from time to time , and try to `` germanise '' each other 's takeaway food by pouring it on our various kebabs , noodles , usw . 
  when the owners were n't looking . 
  on the other side , they have the advantage of being able to go from [ one side of the country to the other ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/abm6w ) charging just once ^ 1 , if they need it . 
  even with those sweet [ tesla motors superchargers ] ( http://www.teslamotors.com/supercharger ) ^ 2 it takes half an hour to get half the battery ( ~ 240km ) , and a 1000km trip can get long if you stop so long so often . 
  one solution could be using public transport for longer trips , but that 's expensive when you travel with family ( it 's cheaper if you go alone ) . 
  other could be having a city car and a `` distance car '' , but not everyone can afford two cars ( and double insurance , double maintenance , etc. ) . 
  battery autonomy and charging speed are the main drawbacks i see regarding massive use of exclusively electric cars in bigger countries . 
  maybe we should concentrate on [ hybrids ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hybrid_electric_vehicle ) for a while more , not making the invest on infrastructure until those issues have been addressed . 
  most of the taxi drivers in my city use [ toyota ] ( http://www.toyota.es/innovation/coches_hibridos.tmex ) prius converted to natural gas ( instead of petrol ) . 
  do n't get me wrong : i 'm totally pro electric car and i think the news about estonia are a great advancement , but each country has to face its own challenges . 
  hopefully it will get better before i 'm able to afford a car , because i fucking love renault zoe . 
  ^ 1 i took [ renault zoe ] ( http://www.renault-ze.com/es-es/gama-z.e./zoe/renault-zoe-life-1355.html ) as a reference ( 210km ) . 
  ^ 2 tesla are more expensive though , and only available in the us . 
  they have better autonomy than others ( [ model s ] ( http://www.teslamotors.com/models/features#/battery ) -  480km or so ) . 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seseo ) , information about the `` lisp '' . 
  copy-pasted : distinction ( spanish : distinci\u00f3n ) refers to the differentiated pronunciation of the two spanish phonemes written \u27e8 s \u27e9 and \u27e8 z \u27e9 or \u27e8 c \u27e9 ( only before \u27e8 e \u27e9 or \u27e8 i \u27e9 , the so-called `` soft '' \u27e8 c \u27e9 ) : \u27e8 s \u27e9 represents a voiceless alveolar fricative / s / ( either laminal as in english , or apical ) ; \u27e8 z \u27e9 and soft \u27e8 c \u27e9 represent a voiceless interdental fricative / \u03b8 / ( the \u27e8 th \u27e9 in think ) . 
  this pronunciation is the standard on which spanish orthography was based , and it is universal in central and northern parts of spain , except for some bilingual speakers of catalan and basque , according to hualde ( 2005 ) . 
  in many other spanish-speaking regions and countries , however , the phonemic distinction between / s / and / \u03b8 / has been neutralized or merged : * ceceo is a phenomenon found in a few dialects of southern spain in which the historical phonemes / s / and / \u03b8 / are both realized as [ \u03b8 ] . 
  * seseo is the merger in the opposite direction : the original phonemes / s / and / \u03b8 / are both pronounced as [ s ] . 
  seseo is the most widespread pronunciation among spanish speakers worldwide . 
  tl ; dr : there are three variants : distinction , with [ \u03b8 ] and [ s ] , which is the orthographic standard and the pronunciation in northern/central spain ; ceceo ( only [ \u03b8 ] ) , found in rural areas of southern spain and some part of central america ; seseo ( only [ s ] ) , found in southern spain and widespread in latin america . 
  and none of them is a speech impairment . 
  i took one semester of finnish when i was in berlin and , being used to learn indo-european languages , it was a total mindfuck most of the time . 
  it had n't occurred to me that grammar and vocabulary could evolve that way . 
  really ? 
  i mean , i speak german fluently and dutch is simply ... annoying . 
  i feel i can understand it ... but then ... not quite . 
  and the spelling ... 
  i like afrikaans ' much more xd comparison between afrikaans and dutch , in case someone is interested : [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_of_afrikaans_and_dutch ), 
  estonia ** big ** .

  hm ... how exactly ? 
  i would like to add subtitles ( at least spanish , could consider english ) to it . 
  i will just omit a surname . 
  good luck searching through the thousands of ( my name ) ( my first surname ) . 
  what the fuck did they expect ? 
  `` let 's go give money to these people to see how they torture a bull , it will be fun '' . 
  fucking retards . 
  sorry , but i hardly think so . 
  they did n't have this compulsion to protect the `` spanish identity '' , and it would probably angered many of their voters . 
  oh , really ? 
  do they advertise much ? 
  i 've been living in oviedo for 6 years now and it 's the first time i 've heard about it . 
  yup ... he did n't enjoy the weather as much , though . 
  `` why is it raining all day ? 
  it 's spain '' . 
  sigh . 
  it 's more of a southern thing . 
  the problem is that the image of spain that has always been sold is pretty much that of andalusia . 
  i 'm under the impression that it has somehow ^ 1 imprinted into the mind of the spaniards that that 's what `` spanish '' should be . 
  if you asked me wether i feel spanish or not , despite my flair , you would probably receive a negative answer , because my experiences are nowhere close to what i identify as spanish ( andalusian imagery , good weather , catholicism , corruption , conservatism ... ) . 
  ^ 1 probably franco 's failed attempt to create * `` one , great and free '' * ( read that with all the resentment you can muster ) is partially responsible . 
  an erasmus friend of mine asked if he could see bullfighting in oviedo or le\u00f3n ... oh , could i laugh . 
  fuuuuuck . 
  well , if you are getting `` black money '' , you certainly are not paying taxes for it , are n't you ? 
  his income taxes mean nothing . 
  sometimes the frustration builds up so much that i 'm tempted to think that violence is the only way out of this . 
  yes , please . 
   flooding catalonia with spanish speakers many would have loved not to have to emigrate , pal . 
  but they went were the industry was . 
  the grandmother of one of my former roommates is italian . 
  we used to receive delicious pasta sauce from the `` nonna '' . 
  that wonderful rag\u00f9 was much appreciated :d and calling everyday ... that 's pretty common over here too . 
  i do n't feel any less independent for talking to my parents . 
  it never actually hurt . 
  more the shock than anything ... it was so unusual that i immediately knew that i had screwed up big time . 
  they used it to momentarily make me behave , and when we got home/i had calmed down they explained me why and set up the real punishment ( for example , not watching my favourite cartoon , not playing simcity ... ) . 
  sorry you had to find the emergency room full of assholes when you were here :p, 
   plus we , and the germans , have a pretty decent health care system . 
  even severely disabled people and the elderly can get subsided health care workers to their house so they can live in their own apartments . 
  woah , how thin is the air all the way up there on your high horse ? 
  we have it too . 
  the other thing are just different views . 
  i like the warm feeling of knowing that someone will help me out if things go awry . 
  edit : look at this nice ranking . 
  data are from 2000 , and our politicians are working against it , but all in all things have n't changed so much : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/healthcare_in_europe, 
  it was in berlin , so i suppose he could afford it because the rents are not so expensive ( although they are getting higher year by year ) . 
  i live alone myself , and if something like that happened to me i would move back to my parents until the problem disappeared ( they live in a different city ) . 
  i have friends here that would gladly help me out , but i feel that that kind of a burden belongs to family ( or so ) .
