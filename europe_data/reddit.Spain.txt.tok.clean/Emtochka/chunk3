  i think you can have both . 
  i look back when i say goodbye to my family , but it does n't prevent me from being an independent adult . 
  i take their opinions and advice in consideration , but it 's me who takes the decisions . 
  oh , and there are economic factors in the `` moving out late '' . 
  youth unemployment , for example . 
  although if someone is 40 and living with their parents ... well , he probably lives in the basement and does n't get out much . 
  some of the things i saw in germany * looked pretty unhealthy to me . 
  some examples : * young man ( 23ish ) broke both his legs , had to go stay longer in the hospital because he lived alone and none could help him at home - stuff like buying groceries , showering , getting up and down the stairs ( his parents lived in the same city , visited him around twice during his stay ) . 
  * a father with young kids had appendicitis , and had to have an emergency surgery . 
  his wife stayed with him at the hospital . 
  his mother charged him double for taking care of her grandchildren on an extra , unplanned day ( i 'm not against them paying the grandmother for babysitting if she does it in a regular basis , but come on ! ) . 
  * guy was operated . 
  parents live in the same city . 
  all he got was a `` gute besserung '' by text message ( even he was shocked , that 's why he told me ) . 
  then there 's this culture of the `` stay at home mom '' when the children are small , which surprised me because it 's not common in spain at all . 
  they sacrifice career opportunities because they enjoy being with their children , and want to give them the best possible care , and yet something `` breaks '' when the kids get bigger and they do n't manage to bond with them . 
  i 'd rather be a [ rabenmutter ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/rabenmutter ) ( link in german ) with strong family ties , thank you . 
  * i 'm talking about _ my experience _ in germany on this thread because it 's the only non-mediterranean country where i 've lived for a significant amount of time . 
  experience may vary . 
  wow . 
  just , wow . 
  you could always answer `` it takes one to know one '' if someone ever said anything to you . 
  they might realise how insulting their assumptions are . 
  female . 
  well , 1,82 m is taller than the average . 
  this !, 
  i have no experience in the uk , but when i was in germany i would get weird looks when i tried to interact with children in public transport . 
  and by interacting i mean making funny faces or waving my hand when they were looking at me . 
  i eventually stopped doing it : c, 
  born in 1989 . 
  my parents would lightly slap me ( or hit me with a slipper ) when all the other methods failed . 
  it 's much better than having a bunch of unruly brats running around like little assholes in a place that 's not specifically designed for it . 
  i know . 
  but i do n't expect everyone to know about medieval kingdoms in spain . 
  go fuck some sheep . 
  lol ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_le\u00f3n, 
  thank you ( or the original creator of this map ) for including le\u00f3n . 
  thank you !, 
  i 've experienced it a couple of times . 
  it was n't pleasant . 
  let me know if you come over again xd, 
  poland !, 
  i have great friends there , that teach me `` useful '' sentences like `` to nie jest g\u00f3ra lodowa '' , for entertainment of their grandparents . 
  look at the shit we have to put up with ( links in spanish ) : * [ state secretary for in/emigration ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2012/11/30/actualidad/1354286966_753467.html ) : young people are leaving because of their adventurous spirit . 
  * [ state secretary for research  ( http://www.elconfidencial.com/sociedad/2012/06/07/la-secretaria-de-estado-de-investigacion-en-espana-sobran-cientificos-99502/ ) in spain there are too many scientists . 
  they trivialise the problem , and our decisions . 
  they tell us they do n't need our effort , that all we do is in vain . 
  you can not fathom the bitterness . 
  if i emigrate , it is never to come back to their paradise of corruption , construction workers , waitresses and whores . 
  that semester of finnish i took might end up being useful , after all ... 
  really ? 
  there usually were chocolates from patients in the arztzimmer of a surgery ward in berlin . 
  mass ? 
  like in force divided by acceleration ? 
  we do it in spain ( nochebuena ) . 
  funny , semi-related anecdote : when i visited some weihnachtsm\u00e4rkte last year , my knowledge of german christmas carols was still somewhat ... limited . 
  suddenly they started playing `` oh , tannenbaum '' , and my friends decided to sing along . 
  i did n't know the lyrics , but did n't want to be left out , so i accompanied them with [ this version from the simpsons ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7cdnvdu8la ) , telling them that those where the spanish lyrics for the song . 
  a rough translation ( i 'm too lazy to look for the original english version ) would be : * today is the day , today is the day , of the beating | we will hit them a lot , until they spit out their hearts . 
  | and we will hit them with sticks , until we break their spines . 
  * they were delighted and made me teach them . 
  i did . 
  i suppose i will tell them the truth , someday . 
  i 'm evil . 
  [ pic of the blood pancakes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/veriohukainen ) for the lazy . 
  i did n't know that [ blood as food ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blood_as_food ) was so popular everywhere . 
   you have to because it 's only edible for one day ... 
  true , but at least it does n't taste like pressed sawdust . 
  here too !, 
  i do miss it when i 'm abroad . 
  yup , that 's why i keep it in my room . 
  i eat my chips with nothing on them . 
  a guy who was selling them on maastricht asked me thrice if i was sure . 
  where are the four halos ? 
  someone more knowledgeable than me explains [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/spaceporn/comments/147d9f/extremely_rare_quadruple_lunar_halo_near_madrid/c7aj9iu ) . 
  ok , now explain why they do that in mallorca , 30\u00bac . 
  it 's really comfortable . 
  i 've only worn them once , when i was in the middle of a forest , nobody was around and i had to give my feet a rest from the walking boots . 
  i would have died in shame if someone had seen me . 
  that 's so funny . 
  and so sad . 
  from wikipedia :  in finnish mythology , a n\u00e4kki ( estonian : n\u00e4kk ) is a neck , a shapeshifting water spirit who usually appears in human form , that resides in murky pools , wells , docks , piers and under bridges that cross rivers . 
  interesting name for a condom brand . 
  there are two possible ways of harvesting organs , depending on the definition of death you are using ( brain death vs cardiocirculatory death ) and the procedures are different . 
  we are very good at brain death donation and now we are starting many `` donation after cardiocirculatory death '' programs , thus the increase . 
  false . 
  it is an opt-out system , although we always check with the family first . 
  the increase is due to better `` donation after cardiac death '' programs , as we do n't get so many brain dead donors . 
  the percentage increased because we are getting better at donation after cardiac death . 
  i am disappointed : c i was expecting something exotic , [ not a slightly colder version of my hometown ] ( http://www.eltiempo24.es/leon/castilla+y+le\u00f3n/espana/es0le0082 ) . 
  not yet :d, 
  * grabs popcorn * who will help ciu rule ? 
  erc wants a referendum but not austerity , pp wants austerity but not a referendum , psc ... well they are still there . 
  this is a strange game . 
  i hope it was n't in any of those awful `` nordsee '' franchises . 
  fish and chips ? 
  heh , they probably mean chips and fish . 
  it was really disappointing . 
  no fumes . 
  we use `` they '' just to sum up thousands of examples .
