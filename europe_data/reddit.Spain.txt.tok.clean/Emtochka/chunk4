  i suggest you google `` corruption scandals spain '' if you want to educate yourself . 
  funny , i only wait when i see kids around because i want to help their parents teach them . 
  sometimes i hear a * `` see ? 
  that girl there is waiting too '' * and it 's very satisfying . 
  it 's actually my dream . 
  i would recommend you to visit some places in the less know northern spain : * [ santiago de compostela ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/santiago_de_compostela ) -  final destination of the ancient [ way of saint james ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/way_of_saint_james ) . 
  * [ the cave of altamira ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cave_of_altamira ) -  first cave in which prehistoric cave paintings were discovered . 
  we can not promise nice weather , though  edit : and thanks , you just made me listen to this song again : [ luar na lubre - chove en santiago ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys_opb-pgwg&amp;feature=related ) . 
  as if we needed to google it ... 
  i like that question much more . 
  i wonder how hard would it be to get a politician consider it . 
  he 's probably colourblind . 
  welcome to the club . 
  well , the question of the referendum would be : `` do you want an independent catalonia * within * the eu ? '' . 
  i find it a bit tricky . 
  what darkibiri said is correct , but it feels more natural if you say `` a m\u00ed me funciona '' . 
  well , i would have said `` a m\u00ed me funciona '' , but that 's only `` the native speaker 's feeling '' . 
  i found funny that they supposed we like our countries . 
  well , the time i talked about discrimination in the workplace i got downvotes and lots of * `` you european women are completely equal , you just want an unfair advantage now '' * and * `` maybe it 's just a spanish thing '' * . 
  it would have been interesting to see if other women across europe had the same opinion . 
  no ... not really . 
  sorry to burst your bubble : c edit : but i do like it when you speak french . 
  except when swearing . 
  that sounds silly . 
  i like norwegian guys more xd, 
  hm ... am i the only one who can not access the full summary ? 
  edit : it works now . 
  you 'll have to wait some centuries , kiddo . 
  edit : formatting, 
  i think there should be an stricter control on this . 
  every some years we hear about an overcrowded event gone wrong : love parade , a club in northamptom , then this ... fuck . 
  ~ ~ or maybe they just wanted to make a * real * halloween party . ~ ~ edit : felt bad about that joke . 
  it was a joke , man . 
  that 's ... [ surprisingly accurate ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1_u4cv3zfog/ucclxpu4myi/aaaaaaaab1y/bwis7cdjy5q/s1600/unemploymenteuregions2011.gif ) . 
  explain [ this ] ( http://ryouready.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/germany_by_unemployment.png ) with your theory , i dare you xd, 
  the government is saying that the measures they took against unemployment are working wonders . 
  ( [ link in spanish ] ( http://www.expansion.com/2012/10/27/economia/politica/1351356781.html ) ) . 
  how can they be so blind ? 
  when i was on erasmus , i met some americans and canadians who had this [ `` romantic view '' ] ( http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/30700000/esmeralda-disney-30712127-334-564.jpg ) on gypsies . 
  it soon changed . 
  ah , berlin ... it was the best of times , it was the worst of times . 
  yeah , i understand what you mean . 
  however , his declarations were n't intelligent nor tactful ... something that should be expected from someone in is position ( yes , i 'm naive , i know ) . 
  there are opinions that should remain private . 
  an equivalent to what he did would be going to the chronic pain unit and start complaining about period cramps . 
  hey , patients !, 
  be friendlier !, 
  i 'm having a bad time too !, 
  i 've tried soy milk with coffee . 
  it was a mistake . 
  a very big one . 
  hey , i bought it in a coop in ume\u00e5 when i was there !, 
  - lasts longer , easy to storage . 
  i can buy milk for months and keep it at home . 
  - you do n't need to keep it refrigerated . 
  - more environmentally friendly ( from the [ wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ultra-high-temperature_processing#environment ) : in 2008 , the uk government proposed a 90 % uht milk production target by 2020 which they believed would significantly cut the need for refrigeration , and thus benefit the environment by reducing green house emissions ) . 
  - my bio-flatmate stays the fuck out of it . 
  i hate when she steals food and does n't replace it ( she 's scared of technology and * `` alles ist sehr ungesund '' * for that bitch : she goes to her room when i use the microwave ... tries to switch off the router when she goes to bed , usually when i 'm using internet for something important , because she thinks it somehow interferes with her sleep ... fuck , i 'm so glad she 's leaving forever in a week ) . 
  - fresh milk tastes weird . 
  oh ... poor guy . 
  if he 's suffering so much we might have to euthanise him . 
  definitely not homeless . 
  nobody says that in the video , and none of the articles i 've read says that she had any kind of permission , just that people just ignored her when she was painting . 
  i think it looks hilarious . 
  and i ask myself how did n't they notice that there was an old woman painting on the walls without permission . 
  now i want to die . 
  ___ well , it 's not a problem for me ( i 've studied french in school and lived 10 months in germany ) but i see how this could be a problem for some of the readers . 
  it 's not realistic to expect that all 17502 readers of / r/europe can understand french and german . 
  also : why limit ourselves to french and german ? 
  there are interesting sources in every language , and if we accept that not everybody can understand everything , we could possibly extend the language diversity . 
  my proposal : sending posts in every language is acceptable , ** if ** the op translates or makes a summary in the comments . 
  it would be valid for comments , too . 
  ( sorry for the bad german . ), 
  hm , not sure if they want things to escalate so much ( although it would be * interesting * ) . 
  i 've been looking for articles about political reactions in various south american newspapers , but there is n't much information yet . 
  he does n't elaborate , apart from saying that he expect a joint answer to that threat to an american country . 
  they have n't given him asylum yet , the foreign minister will make a statement shortly . 
  you have live coverage [ here ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-ecuador-embassy-asylum-live ) , if you are interested . 
  it was pretty effective . 
  more than half want to stay ? 
  apparently ecuador will ask for an emergency [ unasur ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_south_american_nations ) meeting and an extraordinary general assembly of the [ oas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/organization_of_american_states ) . 
  source : [ ecuadorean state news agency ] ( http://andes.info.ec/pol%c3%adtica/5283.html ) - obviously in spanish -, 
  he wants to draw attention to the fact that there are people in andalusia who have barely enough to eat . 
  i approve of this action , but he should be judged for it . 
  again ? 
   badly-poured-pint/half-litre i have just realised that we still use pints in spain ... but only for beer . 
  strange . 
  as a complement : [ list of participating nations on the summer games between 1896 and 2012 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_participating_nations_at_the_summer_olympic_games#alphabetical_list ) and [ on the winter games between 1924 and 2010 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_participating_nations_at_the_winter_olympic_games#alphabetical_list ), 
  also from r/space : [ orbital altitudes of satellites ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/orbitalaltitudes.jpg ), 
  because : 1 ) they can not do it alone and 2 ) they would be killing someone . 
  it does n't work like that , you know . 
  the criteria for brain death are firm and regulated . 
  the rest is paranoia . 
  my `` invisible friend '' is not a pre-loaded set of rules , so i get to pick and choose , sparing myself some awful things like hating gays , oppressing women , the fear of eternal punishment , etc. 
  you forgot the first part of that sentence . 
  anyway , the woman is the one who 's going to be pregnant for 9 months , and pregnancy and childbirth are quite risky . 
  anyway , the justice minister of my country is now babbling about changing the abortion law , suggesting that it might be illegal to abort even in case of malformations . 
  and some other politician of the same party suggested that women should see a sonography of the foetus before they abort . 
  * there was some bad wording on my part , i admit it , but you answered with part of the problem . 
  amount of work-time ?
