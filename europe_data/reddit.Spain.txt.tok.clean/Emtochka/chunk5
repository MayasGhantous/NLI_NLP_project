  higher risk to employ ? 
  maternity leave is relatively easy to plan for an employer , and the part about women generally becoming sick more often ... you could as well say that men are more prone to have car accidents ( to pick another common knowledge unsourced statistic ) . 
  * i suppose that if a woman * wanted or had to * be a miner and had the physical capabilities to do so ( on the same standards ) they could work there ... but their male colleges would n't probably trust them as much as men ( i jumped to that conclusion after reading reactions about the inclusion of women in combat positions in the us military ... although in that case they did want to reduce the requirements , which is stupid ) . 
  the problem would n't exist if people did n't try to rule their lives based on the teachings of their invisible friends . 
  oh , really ? 
  * why do we get paid less than men ( in the same position ) ? 
  and please , do n't answer `` because you get part time jobs to take care of the children '' . 
  that 's part of the problem . 
  * have you ever heard about the `` glass ceiling '' ? 
  * this might not be so problematic in europe , but what about abortion and reproductive rights ? 
  i could go on . 
  it happens in spain too . 
  i was talking mainly about rents , public transport and eating/going out . 
  it 's much cheaper than london . 
  quite trashy , too . 
  * arm aber sexy * ( poor but sexy ) , that 's what they say . 
  well , i know i sound really pessimistic , but adding everything up my erasmus was a great experience . 
  for every self-righteous asshole i met , i had the chance to learn something from interesting people . 
  not only you get in contact citizens of your country of choice , but also with many other international students . 
  it 's a good opportunity to break some stereotypes . 
  if you always stay in the same place , you are bound to sooner or later repeat the mistakes everyone is committing . 
  even the tiniest , better working of communities can benefit from other points of views or ideas . 
  i hate when people judge me because of my country , but sure as hell they are not going to prevent me from participating in as many exchanges as possible during my medical residence . 
  yeah , it was exactly like that . 
  that 's why at the end i was counting the days to come back . 
  it 's extremely frustrating to see doubts about your skills because of your nationality . 
  of course , every mistake you make is going to be caused by your country of origin , too . 
  and you are right , i 'm a medical student . 
  i was on exchange at the charit\u00e9 , in berlin . 
  they are top at research , not so good in medical education , in case you are interested . 
  i 've just come back , after expending 10 months there . 
  leave me be , man . 
  i need some time to forget the bad experiences . 
  i left my country hating everything about it . 
  for the first months , germany was some kind of paradise . 
  everything was so ... perfect . 
  somewhere in the middle i started thinking that it was n't actually perfect , just ... different . 
  towards the end of my stay i could n't wait to come back to spain . 
  the grass is ~ ~ always ~ ~ most of the times greener outside the fence , but `` outside '' everything is shitty in its own way . 
  wow ... 
  i ca n't believe the restaurant thing : s where was that ? 
  are you sure it 's because he was black , or could it be any other excuse ? 
  tourists can be nasty sometimes . 
  and it 's strange , because i 've always heard that berlin was liberal ( or at least atypical ) by german standards . 
  well , berlin is a bit atypical for germany . 
  ahhh , the times i 've pictured myself doing that . 
  with the happiest voice and salute and everything . 
  my self-control improved a lot . 
  also my polite sarcastic german , when the first failed . 
  well , berlin is kinda nice but ... there are too many berliners . 
  i 've been asked ( by total strangers and without any kind of first interaction on my part ) . 
  * * what the fuck are you ^ 1 doing here ? 
  * ( while sitting on one of the sparse benches waiting for some friends ) . 
  * * what the fuck are you ^ 1 doing ? 
  * ( while taking down pieces of wardrobe down the stairs when i was moving ... ) * ( to my flatmate , 5 minutes before nachtruhe ) : * why are you ^ 1 still playing the fucking cello ? 
  we ca n't sleep . 
  * * ( while preparing to take blood from a patient ) * can you call a german student ? 
  * * * oh , do you ^ 1 want to come here after you do n't find a job in your ^ 1 country ? 
  * * * spaniard ? 
  but ... you are so ... white * . 
  ( i really wanted to ask them if that meant that they where giving me permission to speak to them ) . 
  * ( after arriving 5min late for the first and only time because there was a fucking s-bahn ausfall ) * ah , the lazy spaniard is late * . 
  never do that guys . 
  never . 
  it 's a joke none takes well , specially if said person is working her ass off . 
  also : * public transport : unreliable ( talking about the s-bahn here ) , badly planned , no air conditioning . 
  drunkards . 
  * it 's dirty . 
  except for the most `` touristic '' parts , everything is fucking dirty . 
  * they kicked me out of my flat without a proper reason and i could n't complain because i did n't have the time ( i was leaving in a week anyway ) . 
  * neighbours who call the police directly without telling you you are bothering ( at a friend 's flat . 
  and we were just playing carcassone . 
  not even drinking ) . 
  * had to expend a month in [ brandenburg ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uellmyna34u ) ( as part of my clinical practice ) . 
  i rationally understand that it 's stupid to `` hate '' a whole country , but it will be a while until i forgive `` the germany in my mind '' . 
  the ^ 1 means that they addressed me informally using `` du '' . 
  hm ... pretty cool . 
  i would change something about the crest though : castles around ours and the escutcheons in the middle . 
  i would like you to come and see our politicians : corruption , incompetence and bigotry . 
  a member of the governing party said `` fuck them '' after cutting on the unemployment benefits , and she does n't consider that behaviour a reason to resign . 
  our judicial system blatantly fails at punishing corruption . 
  it makes me sick every time i have to vote . 
  there is n't a real option in any of the big parties , and our voting law is so flawed that none of the smaller parties has a real chance of doing something . 
  the system within the bigger parties is completely antidemocratic , and only those designed by the `` higher spheres '' of the party have a chance of assuming a governing position . 
  our current democracy is a farce , a setting created after franco 's death . 
  maybe we need more democracy , not less . 
  or maybe bombs . 
  who knows . 
  man , read some of their other tweets . 
  they are barely human . 
  at least bother to write the '' \u00f1 '' in `` ma\u00f1ana '' , you lazy northern . 
  [ berlin , du bist so wunderbar ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uga_spzrf70 ) . 
  until they decide that jumping out to the pool from a 5th floor hotel window is a good idea . 
  emergency services are expensive , man !, 
  i wonder who was the genius that decided to promote that kind of tourism . 
  this is not new . 
  we 've done this before , back in 1907 . 
  ours has no lyrics . 
  but it 's horrible anyway . 
  ( i bet that was n't creepy at all .
