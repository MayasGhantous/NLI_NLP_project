  ceceo happens only if you substitute all the / s / for / \u03b8 / . 
  i mean ... when i say `` cazar '' ( hunt ) , you can hear a / \u03b8 / , but when i say `` casa '' ( house ) i pronounce an / s / . 
  that 's called `` distinci\u00f3n '' . 
  seseo happens when you only pronounce / s / . 
  a lisp is a * speech impediment * , where you * ca n't * pronounce / s / . 
  people who speak with a `` ceceo '' can pronounce / s / if they want to . 
  none of the terms are synonyms .

  but why do you call it a `` lisp '' ? 
  i mean , i do n't have any speech impediment ... 
  i pronounce both z and s , it depends on the word . 
  ah , you mean `` z , c '' . 
  in the region of spain where i live you find that sound in words containing : z + any vowels or c + `` e '' or `` i '' . 
  pretty much everywhere else it 's pronounced / s / . 
  both are correct . 
  `` bend over '' . 
  driving in paris was terrifying . 
  but ... but why are they singing in spanish ? 
  why ? 
  ( or i can suddenly understand romanian ) . 
  thanks !,

  * preliminary figures . 
  the countries are ranked by the 1998 figures . 
  you 've forgotten to mention that the rich-moron is probably a cousin or a friend of one of the inept politicians ... and that said politician is getting rich on the process . 
  my name is [ \u00cd\u00f1igo montoya ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha6c7lnjgsw ) ... 
  i find your innocence really cute . 
  hey , what makes you think that we want to keep our royal family ? 
  sooo ... * the son in law of the king _ allegady _ defrauded lots of money . 
  * his grandson shoot himself in the foot . 
  the first official version of the incident said that it happened while practicing in a shooting range , but then they realised the kid was too young to legally do that , and changed it to `` was helping his father clean the guns and accidentally discharged one on his food '' . 
  * the king ( president of honour of wwf spain ) went to an elephant hunting safari in botswana with his german lover and broke his hip . 
  * linking the two facts above , we suspect that what really happened was that the grandson was wearing [ those ] ( http://www.eldescodificador.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/froil\u00e1n.jpg ) and the king was around . 
  a thing that shocked me in berlin is how many people ( mostly construction workers ) drink `` ein bierchen '' alone in the s-bahn after work . 
  in spain , drinking alone is extremely frowned upon . 
  germans , do you consider this kind of behaviour socially acceptable ? 
  you mean , it has two red strips and no purple one ? 
  i wish him `` health and republic '' . 
  no idea . 
  hm ... not that i 've heard . 
  our immigration pattern right now is : 1 ) former immigrants go back home ( that might explain that possible and unconfirmed flow towards romania ) . 
  2 ) scientists , engineers and other graduated students get the fuck out , mostly towards germany . 
  edit : typo . 
  they should stay where roots usually are : underground !, 
  no , you silly . 
  those are the hordes of bank santander , ca n't you see the logo on the background ? 
  they wear its colours , red and white , and added the black cape to look more evil . 
  now , seriously : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holy_week_in_spain, 
  i admit that some of the carved wood figures are invaluable , and i kinda like the feeling of solemnity during the processions but : * it has started attracting tourism , and thus the number of processions has increased : you can have too much of a good thing . 
  * it receives a preferential treatment compared to other events : atheist procession , etc. . . just the same as the catholic church ( 0 % budget cuts , compared to a 21 % in education and a 34 % in i+d ) . 
  we 'd be better off without the crows . 
  * it 's creepy to see grown men crying and shouting `` you are a cutie '' to a piece of wood ( luckily that 's more of a southern thing and i 've never had the dubious privilege of seeing it live ) . 
  * it shoves religion down children 's throats , even if most of the participants do it for tradition 's sake , not because they believe . 
  eat tons of [ chocolate ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ulnp_zmz4aw/s7psbijii-i/aaaaaaaabqs/jimnnlstj0e/s1600/mona_de_pascua_heidi.jpg ) and [ torrijas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_toast ) , while drinking * limonada * ( in my city it does n't mean `` lemonade '' , it 's more of a kind of sangr\u00eda ) . 
  other people dress up like [ morons ] ( http://data.blogg.de/1096905/images/img_113_3_1.jpg ) and pretend to be religious . 
  ufo !, 
  i 'm so envious right now ... 
  you mean , the whole thing , not only the busy entrances ? 
  is there enough traffic at night to justify that ? 
  what i remember about driving over there is that you could always find other cars on the road . 
  in spain ( at least in the centre ) you can drive almost alone for hundreds of kilometres . 
  i 'm always amazed by how densely populated central europe is . 
  mostly left wing . 
  as our own officials said ... `` this reform wo n't improve the work situation '' . 
  you 've discovered our secret :|, 
  well , looking at [ this t-shit ] ( http://www.thorsteinar.de/images/product_images/popup_images/3632_0.png ) ( from the official online store ) ... it 's either neo-nazis or eco-activists , like [ this guy . 
  ] ( http://www.thorsteinar.de/images/product_images/popup_images/3579_5.jpg ) he 's clearly an ecologist !, 
  but if they are going to be dragged out people wo n't have the possibility to get closer and effectively read it . 
  maybe if they write it on their arses too ? 
  i do n't think it 's a good idea to write protest messages in a penis , from a readability point of view . 
  ok , i do n't really like many of the bands/singers here , but i wanted to provide as many styles as possible .

  if i 'm not mistaken , they turned it into the anthem ( or at least a meaningful song ) of solidarno\u015b\u0107 . 
  please do n't add more drunkards/guys smelling like alcohol to berlin . 
  i beg you . 
  `` the vatican '' ? 
  that 's not gon na happen . 
  the guy who did the map has obviously remained on the 60s . 
  there 's also [ meneame ] ( http://www.meneame.net/ ) , which has a respectable traffic . 
  i do n't know if there 's a portuguese equivalent with a similar popularity . 
  black humour is like legs : there are people who have , and people who do n't . 
  anyway , i did n't find it so funny either . 
  maybe because a significant number of the posters are from the us ? 
  the one who started talking about the us in this thread is canadian . 
  / picks up sniper rifle . 
  it 's more entertaining when you try to run away :d, 
  better english ? 
  than you so much for the list . 
  i was really confused when i read the article , because of my experiences in spain and germany ( if germany was in the list , why spain was n't ? ) . 
  anyway , it 's also true that the plural of anecdote is not `` data '' . 
  latvia through spanish eyes : hm ... it was the one in the middle , right ? 
  spaniards are ... white/non white/racist/caucasian . 
  wtf ? 
  some countries have already tried a somewhat similar approach , and ( simplifying much ) that 's why they have some `` issues '' with the old * [ gastarbeiter ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gastarbeiter ) * and their families . 
  they supposed the foreign workers would eventually leave and did n't care much about integration . 
  there have always been two spains . 
  and this confirms there will always be two spains . 
  not really . 
  sadly i did n't have time to stop when i drove the whole way from venice to barcelona , but i would have loved to see monaco , nice and marseille .
