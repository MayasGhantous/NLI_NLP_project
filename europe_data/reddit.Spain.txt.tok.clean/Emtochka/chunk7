  * first recommendation : shorten your list . 
  * as far as i know , there 's nothing really worth seeing in [ gibraltar ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/rock_of_gibraltar_northwest.jpg ) . 
  marbella is horrible ( tall buildings 3 meters away from the beach ) . 
  * about the munich , salzburg , vienna part : you can take a train from munich to vienna and make a 8 hours stop in salzburg on the way . 
  * you are not going to be able to find anything cheap in ~ ~ touristic ~ ~ paris . 
  this is the [ original german article ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,811817,00.html ) ( they have attached the letter of the italian ambassador at the end ) . 
  it was worse than i expected . 
  i would consider it bild-level , if it were n't for the somewhat longer sentences ... 
  it evolves `` brilliantly '' from `` schettino was italian '' to `` italian culture is inferior '' and uses it to support his main point : * geburtsfehler des euro ? 
  die zwangsjacke f\u00fcr verschiedene kulturen * ( the problems of the euro since its creation ? 
  it 's a straitjacket for different cultures ) . 
  could someone imagine a german , or better , british captain doing such a manouver and then escaping from the ship ? 
  you know this people from the holidays at the beach . 
  a man that gesticulates a lot and [ has fingers that speak ] * . 
  mostly harmless , if you do n't let him near heavy machinery , as this [ case ] shows . 
  the italian national sport is to do `` bella figura '' , and the point of it is impressing others . 
  * i suppose that 's and idiom , but i do n't know how to translate it . 
  the national character is like the gender differences . 
  they were theoretically abolished long ago , but we constantly keep on bumping against them . 
  this is the [ italian one ] ( http://www.ilgiornale.it/interni/lettera_ai_tedeschi/27-01-2012/articolo-id=568980-page=0-comments=1l ) . 
  they criticise the whole article about the accident , but specially that opinion column . 
  `` we are not a country of cowards '' . 
  then they compare the accident with the holocaust ( at least they managed to save 4k people in the accident ) . 
  according to der spiegel we are a land of schetinos and it 's not surprising what happened in giglio . 
  we all are persons to avoid , a dead weigh for europa and an obstacle for the common currency . 
  for their bravery and superiority there were 2 world wars , that destroyed europe two times . 
  they are bullies that a year ago they finished to pay the compensations for the damage caused in the first conflict : 70 millions of a debt of 125 milliards . 
  it took 92 years , and in the meantime we beggars have helped them defend themselves against the soviet union and pay the bill for the reunification of germany . 
  these germans are today arrogant and dangerous for europe . 
  hopefully not because of the cannons , but the weapon of the currency is not less dangerous . 
  we should n't take shame for this [ the accident ] . 
  we may have one schettino , but they have auschwitz and [ nobody will take it away from them ] - this last sentence is google translated , corrections appreciated - . 
  [ my opinion . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35tbgjt-wea ), 
  actually , we already have him in our [ 10 , 20 and 50 cents coins ] ( http://www.fnmt.es/content/imagenes/mmcc/08/euroset_proof/50cent_comp_alta.jpg ) . 
  yeah , i trust the judges too . 
  by the way , they are breaking spanish legislation . 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.boe.es/aeboe/consultas/bases_datos/doc.php?id=boe-a-1996-6643 ) . 
  about the article : the patient decided to go to germany , got contacted by dkms , started a donation drive for dkms in spain ( it is not allowed by the spanish legislation to start a drive for a concrete person ) , and dkms collected samples from these people and included them in their database ( they did n't have the permits to do it ) . 
  the ont database is available internationally , too . 
   i do believe ont has acted criminally negligent , and should be very , very quite and go into a corner to shame itself a little . 
  i could reply to that . 
  i do n't feel able to do it in a civil way . 
  wtf ? 
  the transplantation process is carried out in hospitals . 
  so , now i have the time :  the fact that the ont does believe dkms 's actions to be illegal does not make them illegal . 
  there are a lot of conjunctives in that paragraph . 
  questions of legality should be solved in a court of law . 
  i already answered to that one . 
  it * will * be decided in court . 
   is n't there some kind of eu legislation about tissue traffic ? 
  ( i only found this , but it does n't define tissue . 
  is a salvia sample , and thus parts of the oral mucosa , which should be unfit to transplant , `` tissue '' in the sense of the 2002 additional protocol to the convention on human rights and biomedicine concerning transplantation of organs and tissues of human origin ? 
  was money involved in the transfer of the salvia samples , e.g. 
  did the donors get paid for their samples ? 
  ( else it would n't be `` trafficking '' ) dkms takes blood or saliva samples . 
  and yeah it is tissue . 
  and it 's trafficking because they are doing it without the permits . 
   the dkms is a non-profit , a so-called `` gemeinn\u00fctzige gmbh '' . 
  they can not , by law , turn up profits to be distributed to shareholders . 
  the fact that they are `` non-profit '' does n't mean they can not get money to fulfill other objectives . 
  in the article : after the donors are called up to donate their marrow for free , dkms charges recipients 14,500 euros to cover costs . 
   what are the `` usual '' fees ? 
  usual in which context ? 
  usual in spain ? 
  in the iberian peninsula ? 
  in europe ? 
  everything is a little more expensive over here : cars , taxes , why not bone marrow matching services ? 
  usual in spain . 
  these are `` donors '' that the dkms has potentially `` stolen '' from our registry . 
  it 's a bit stupid for them to be registered in germany , is n't it ? 
  and about the ~ ~ demagogic ~ ~ price part : taxes are not so far away , thanks to some `` austerity measures '' . 
  the funny thing is , salaries are light years away . 
   as far as i understand it , dkms does not invoice recipients , but their insurances . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , it 's all the same . 
   dkms is funded by the krebshilfe and by donations . 
  coty is one of those donors , but by far not the the largest one . 
  nothing to object . 
   is this getting back at us because of the cucumbers ? 
   not even comparable . 
  we ( well , i 'm not a md yet ) do n't get money for declaring someone braindead . 
  it 's something we 'd prefer not having to do , for various reasons : * it means someone has died . 
  * it means we 've failed . 
  * it means we have to tell the family of this person that we 've failed . 
  sometimes they do n't say anything . 
  sometimes they get angry at you . 
  sometimes they start crying , or break down , or scream . 
  sometimes they cling at you . 
  in some cases they do n't care . 
  and in all the cases , you feel chocked up inside . 
  * it reminds us of our own mortality . 
  but of course , that does n't exclude the existence of a. . . let 's call him sadistic doctor that enjoys that . 
  that 's why at least three have to check it . 
  the article does n't , the press note ( that i also linked ) does . 
  i will answer more extensively when i have the time , but by now i inform you that the ont is part of the ministry of health . 
  i suppose they know what they are talking about . 
  here 's the [ press release ] ( http://www.fcarreras.org/en/press-release-the-ont-and-the-jos\u00e9-carreras-foundation-regarding-the-capture-of-bone-marrow-donors-in-spain_109829 ) from fundaci\u00f3n josep carreras and the ont ( national transplant organisation ) , with information about the legislation dkms is supposedly breaking . 
  true , i forgot an `` e '' . 
  did i get the idiom right ? 
  translation : you are absolutely right .
