  the only thing that disturbs me is that these people come to our home , live and enjoy everything our culture has to offer and then they try to harm us everywhere they can . 
  luckily we are the ones who has to decide our future , our independence . 
  translation : their opinion is irrelevant . 
  we do n't need at all their approval or support . 
  the only thing that counts is our will . 
  and , regarding that , we are going in the right direction . 
  no val la pena discutir amb aquests desgraciats translation : the first part literally means `` the guest came and throw us out of our home '' , and i suppose it 's an idiom that means that the immigrants impose their views on the locals . 
  the second part is means `` discussing with these wretches is not worth it '' . 
  edit : typo . 
  one of the first words i learnt in finnish was * kahvi * ( coffee ) . 
  now i understand . 
  i 'm implying that someone who calls me lazy is diminishing all my work . 
  call me hypersensitive , if you want , but i do get pissed . 
  maybe i 've met all the assholes . 
  germans . 
  it has nothing to do with them being anti-european , but with their inability to assume that they can do something wrong ( example , e.coli `` crisis '' ) . 
  they are also fast in the use of the `` lazy southern europeans '' card ... and that is almost as insulting as calling them `` nazis '' . 
  oh , and disinformation + paternalism ( literal quote about * los indignados * : well , but you did n't expect the government to give you jobs , did you ? ) . 
  where do they get those ideas ? 
  they do n't even read bild . 
  i used to give a damn , you know . 
  i 've learnt , protested ( and got hit by the police ) and voted . 
  and still , i see everything slowly going awry , while some get benefits from it . 
  now i 'm studying abroad and i 've had the opportunity to discuss the matter with northern europeans . 
  all i 've got are little condescending smiles and much self-righteousness . 
  so , fuck it . 
  [ schei\u00dfegal ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgass0kzyui ) description : it 's a youtube video with a song titled * schei\u00dfegal * ( `` i do n't give a damn '' ) from an old german rock group called b\u00f6hse onkelz . 
  hm , what happened in germany during the 1990s that could have strained your economy ... do n't know ... * wiedervereinigung * ? 
  also , good luck competing with china . 
  of course there 's a link between economic and structural growth , what i do n't understand is why are you comparing such a different periods . 
  we are talking about ** economic ** recovery here , like in the rest of the thread . 
  you were comparing the growth `` post-war times '' ( = from total destruction to * whatever * ) , with the growth in relatively easy times . 
  total recovery was pretty much far away , too . 
  some things ca n't be fixed in a year . 
  german sense of what ? 
  i did notice the detail the first time i read the article , but discarded it as irrelevant . 
  i mean , it does n't really look like a childish attempt of a protest act , like the examples you provided . 
  i fail to see the hypothetical reasoning behind it . 
  what would be the point of destroying part of her cultural heritage if she was starting a crusade to recover it , or protesting for the spanish occupation of al-andalus ? 
  ( it was hard to write that last one without laughing ) . 
  that 's quite an ... interesting index with , i must admit , a very ... creative name . 
  remind me to check for people dying of leprosy in the street next time i go to spain . 
  edit : oh , wow . 
  i 've just realised . 
  which countries are the 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 , etc. 
  in the ranking ? 
  she 's legally an adult . 
  now , the question is : does she have mental problems or is she simply stupid ? 
  there 's another option . 
  maybe she thought she was in mallorca . 
  and they * pay * for it . 
  actually , berlin knew about the reforms proposed by our president before we did , so i pretty much think she was talking to europe as a whole . 
  not all language schools are looking for teachers for advanced levels and/or conversation assistants . 
  knowing spanish will certainly broaden his options . 
  interesting . 
  however , having a look at your examples makes me think that the situation might not be exactly the same . 
  was there an increase in the prices of necessity products too , and if so , a strong consumer response ? 
  i can see how you can pass without going to bars or caf\u00e9s , but what about bread and vegetables ? 
  our change was 1 $ = 166,386 pesetas , and suddenly some things that used to cost 100 ptas . 
  started costing 1 $ . 
   to draw conclusions on the , inevitably tumultuous , first decade of our common currency is akin to declaring a climate-chance after 10 years of data ( unrelated to actual climate change , just for the sake of comparing equally long-term concepts ) . 
  i think we might be talking about different things here . 
  what did n't work , in my opinion , was the dual labelling ( at least it did n't work as in france , like kim147 's said ) . 
   a populist might say that not working is the real problem in spain  i 'm studying in germany right now , so my sense of humour and ability to ignore populism have been so eroded that they barely prevent me from knifing people in the throat each time i hear things like that , 
  this dual labelling is still used in some places in spain . 
  obviously did n't work . 
  it wo n't be so difficult in spain , but you 'll need to learn spanish for most of the jobs . 
  does n't look so difficult to [ build ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xfqguszemtc/tpzqweujspi/aaaaaaaabta/25yosd2pia0/s1600/1%2bde%2bdiciembre%2bde%2b1789%2bguillotin%2bpresenta%2bla%2bguillotina.gif ) . 
  thanks to your post i have just pictured ratzinger naked . 
  it 's horrible . 
  on a more serious tone : how come you are still surprised by the hypocrisy of the catholic church ? 
  ok , i 'm in . 
  yes , yes i want . 
  he links to two google translated articles , and he does n't really add anything . 
  that 's why i will comment on the articles and not on his post . 
  about the articles : the first one is from * libre mercado * ( free market ) , which is a part of * libertad digital * ( digital freedoom ) . 
  it is [ an opinion newspaper ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/advocacy_journalism ) with classic liberal to libertarian conservative views . 
  it has been announcing `` the end of the world '' for a while , now . 
  the author speculates about `` what our economy minister will do '' , provides some fancy graphics and i ca n't find any source from his data . 
  the second article cites `` one of the greatest experts of the country '' ... without names , and links to some data from hacienda ( the treasury ) ... the whole november 2011 report . 
  my opinion : this guy should choose better sources . 
  the guy who lost * two times * against our former president . 
  what makes me really angry is that they keep on saying that our healthcare system is expensive , and well , see it by yourself : [ life expectancy vs. expenditure ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:life_expectancy_vs_spending_oecd.png ) . 
  source ? 
   train kilometres built with made in germany technology [ most of the high speed trains ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/alta_velocidad_espa\u00f1ola#relaciones_ave ) are talgo , and that 's a spanish company . 
  hey !, 
  they did n't say spain !, 
  it 's more or less believable . 
  from your link :  however , the inclusion of the prize ( usually a small metal toy ) was forbidden by the european union . 
  what ?!, 
  we still get thingies in the rosc\u00f3n de reyes ( which is actually pretty similar ) . 
  [ rosc\u00f3n de reyes ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/rosc\u00f3n_de_reyes_-_mallorquina.jpg ) :d background info : traditionally eaten on the 6th of january , it contains one or more figurines and a bean . 
  the person who gets a figurine is crowned `` king of the day '' ( well , that 's only meaningful for children ) and if you get the bean you have to pay for the rosc\u00f3n ( not enforced - at least in my family ) . 
  edit : i suppose my second favourite is gl\u00fchwein ... so many giggles after a couple of cups . 
  i 've already replied to that in other comment . 
   you talk about fascist names . 
  josep pla , during fascist times , was known as jos\u00e9 pla , not jos\u00e9 placita . 
  needed to check who the guy was on wikipedia , so no idea about his name changes . 
  and of course , did n't have the info about the names during the dictatorship because i did n't live there at the time ( i was n't even alive ) . 
  my interest on the matter is n't big enough to look for an old map and check .
