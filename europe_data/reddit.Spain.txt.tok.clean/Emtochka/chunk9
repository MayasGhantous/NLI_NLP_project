  that 's why i called it a `` hypothesis '' . 
  thanks for your kindness , anyway . 
   and take a look to these links , please , neither google nor tele-atlas : trobajo del cerecedo has 785 inhabitants . 
  they might have a whorehouse , but i hardly think they 'll have a hotel . 
  the wtf thing is that one of the street signs with the name appears blurred , but you can more or less read `` calle general\u00edsimo franco '' ( under some black paint ) , and in the other there 's a clear `` calle huertos '' . 
  and apparently , there 's a [ shop ] ( http://www.mouta.com.ar/directorio/ver/empresa/drexel-equipment-uk-limited-sucursal-en-espana_58506 ) in `` calle del general\u00edsimo , sant jaume d'enveja '' . 
  does n't seem very likely , either . 
  sadly , the google car has n't reach them yet , so i ca n't check . 
  anyway , both appear on bing as `` calle general\u00edsimo franco '' ( the one in le\u00f3n ) and `` carrer general\u00edsimo '' ( the one in tarragona ) . 
  in this case , the data is supplied by navteq . 
  because they receive the data from an external source that 's probably using some franco times topographical data . 
  i can assure you there 's no [ `` calle del general\u00edsimo '' ] ( http://imgur.com/bjly9 ) in le\u00f3n . 
  hm , i did n't reach that level of detail . 
  they 've probably used some kind of franco-times source for the topographical data . 
  have you tried that on a tomtom gps ? 
  they use the same source . 
  about names : i do n't usually have any problem with the mispronunciations / translations and/or removal of surnames of my name that usually happen when confronted with non spanish speakers . 
  and some examples : [ isabel i de inglaterra ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/isabel_i_de_inglaterra ) , [ al\u017eb\u011bta z valois ] ( http://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/al\u017eb\u011bta_z_valois ) , [ felip ii de castella ] ( http://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/felip_ii_de_castella ) ... 
  i could go on . 
  * edit : * hypothesis about `` outdated '' source is gaining strength : i 'm damned sure there 's no `` calle del general\u00edsimo '' in le\u00f3n : http://imgur.com/bjly9, 
  i 've both read the link and checked the map , thanks . 
  it 's bilingual . 
  last time i checked they were bilingual ( at least in barcelona ) . 
  i prefer to call it eastern america . 
  same connotation , less offensive . 
  i think i would rather learn an artificial language or latin as lingua franca , rather than using english . 
  come and tell some spanish friends that they are `` unmacho '' , i dare you xd, 
  there is ... 
  i even speak pretty decent spanish with portuguese accent ( according to some portuguese friends ) :p, 
  it brings the disadvantages of private business under competition too . 
   28,31 % of abstention ftfy, 
  then we should get a president by default and stop this pantomime . 
  it 's cheaper . 
  you mean that spanish girls from middle-upper class families can go to other countries to get an abortion , right ? 
  it 's such a pity that most of unwanted pregnancies happen to cluster in lower socio-economic levels . 
  it 's totally backwards . 
  there 's nothing good on it . 
  a less angry note : although it is true that our current abortion law dates from 2010 , abortions for medical reasons were possible since 1985 . 
  among those medical reasons was `` health risk for the mother '' which coincidentally included `` psychological risk '' , thus leaving place for a legal trickery that is unfair and hypocritical : it might work for some but not for everyone , and forces the patients to lie . 
  hm ... why should they touch the army when they can privatise healthcare and education ... 
  i can feel their anticipation . 
  they want to allow smoking in bars , too . 
  i only hope that the `` new government '' does n't try to do something stupid with that political party . 
  i remember the last absolute majority they had ... and some of the things they sang in g\u00e9nova sounded scary . 
  thank you . 
  we are back in 1996 . 
  i am concerned about their economic plan , but my deepest fear is that they start ignoring the economy to concentrate on stupid populist things with a ) homosexual rights , b ) tobacco law . 
  'cause , you know ... they are `` that kind of liberals '' . 
  actually , thanks to our electoral law : * pp ( right wing party - the ones who won the election ) -  10.830.693 votes = 186 representatives . 
  * psoe ( `` left '' wing party - the former governing party ) -  6.973.880 votes = 110 representatives . 
  * iu ( more or less equivalent to die linke ) -  1.680.810 votes = 11 representatives . 
  * upyd ( self defined as progressists ) -  1.140.242 votes = 5 representatives . 
  it * does * look a little bit weird , does n't it ? 
  a bit of math : * pp needed 58.229 votes to get 1 representative . 
  * psoe needed 63.398 votes to get 1 representative . 
  * ui needed 152.800 votes to get 1 representative . 
  * upyd needed 228.048 votes to get 1 representative . 
  do you see why neon9999 and i sound so bitter ? 
  can you see why we call it a two party system ? 
  why is my vote worth less than the votes of the followers of the two big parties ? 
  indeed , as you have observed , there are more parties . 
  but they are brutally underrepresented . 
  in spain , right-wingers do n't vote . 
  they clock in . 
  solution : marry your cousins . 
  until the end of pregnancy if the fetus will likely not survive . 
  i 'm not completely sure , but i think it only applies to underage couples . 
  in spain , too . 
   sarkozy 's french , he has an almost infinite arsenal of insulting expressions i do n't doubt it , but most of them sound cute ... 
  wtf ? 
  i hardly think restaurant owners would risk their business flagrantly breaking food regulations . 
  and i have yet to find a `` tapa '' containing bird meat . 
  and berlin is too `` multikulti '' to have any of them as a feiertag . 
  fml, 
  actually i 've never had trouble finding it , but i was surprised because there was n't such a broad variety ( brand-wise ) as back home . 
  also , my flatmate looked at it as if it were poison , but i think she 's a bit too `` bio '' . 
  this !, 
  thank you , i had been wondering why there is n't so much uht milk here in germany . 
  self-fulfilling prophecy , that 's what they are trying to do . 
  thank you !, 
  hey guys , i was trying to get the spanish flag and i got this message :  `` from bigfriendlyrobot sent 37 seconds ago that message was invalid . 
  please try again ! '', 
  any ideas ? 
  you do n't have any reason to suspect an inner terrorist group , right ? 
  as a spaniard , i ca n't help but to think in something [ eta ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eta ) - like . 
  they did n't get the visa on time :p, 
  aids-denialism is not a crime either , and it 's potentially more dangerous than denying the holocaust . 
  really , do you need to ban the `` flat earth society '' to prevent it from convincing people that the earth is flat ? 
  and about this :  the european union 's framework decision on racism and xenophobia , released in 2007 , states that denying or grossly trivialising `` crimes of genocide '' should be made `` punishable in all eu member states . 
  while other eu member states have already adopted either parts or the entire framework into their laws , spain has not complied . '' the author willingly forgets the next paragraph of the legislation :  member states may choose to punish only conduct which is either carried out in a manner likely to disturb public order or which is threatening , abusive or insulting . 
  i do n't even know why we keep on listening to them . 
  this is not a stereotype :d, 
  [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v_-vdlvqbu ) ( in german ) is so appropriate . 
  i just took it from the article you provided , and if bonfire smoke gets there , car/industry pollution does , too . 
  unless you have found a way of making your sources of air pollution `` kosher '' , that 's it . 
  it would be nice if you shared it . 
  you can not fight air currents . 
  oh , and maybe you can set an example , too : `` pollution from israel also reaches neighboring countries . 
  according to one study , it is very likely that air pollution created by bonfires during the lag ba'omer holiday makes its way to amman , jordan . '', 
  so what ?
