you can be equal and poor and rich and unequal , like the united states . 
  i think * the first lady * is a very american institution and tradition . 
  in the european republics , the spouse of the president of the republic does n't play any important role , at least as in the united states . 
  i do n't understand well why some politicians want to * americanize * our political systems and institutions . 
  these kind of news hurt barcelona too much because nowadays barcelona 's main economic sector is tourism . 
  of course , it 's not perfect and it creates a lot of problems ( if you ask any person who lives in barcelona , we can tell you many of them ) , but the solution is to reform it , not to destroy it . 
  what do these teenagers think we 're going to live by if barcelona loses its main economic sector ? , industry ? 
  no , it contaminates ; green industry ? 
  no , we do n't have enough space in the city ; financial sector ? 
  no , that 's capitalism ; aerospace sector ... ? 
  at least , they 're only a noisy minority and most people from barcelona refuse these acts and we do n't have anything against tourists . 
  my deepest condolences to french people . 
  olympic games cost very much money ( in my opinion , it 's better those millions go to improve healthcare , education ... ) and it yields very few benefits . 
  you should read a bit about the spanish economy ... wikipedia is free . 
  or maybe andalusia is the spain 's france or ireland . 
  one politician who told the truth and the president fired him . 
  the moral is simple : we have to lie . 
  i keep tending to think that the most likely scenario in catalonia is elections , in which erc will win . 
  but i 'm human and i can be wrong and another shabby referendum could be held , like in 2014 . 
  but a serious referendum is almost impossible . 
  very good , freixes . 
  i recommend his book * la llengua maltractada * that explains that spanish has been spoken in the catalan cities since the xv century and it has been the intellectual language in catalonia for centuries ( diglossia ) . 
  but catalan nationalists are the first ones who do n't know a lot of the history of catalonia ... one of the reasons of this craziness that can lead us to get out of the european union . 
  that 's why , i think it 's better to call them * catexiter * than * independentista * . 
  i say it seriously , because i 'm european and i want to keep being european ( eu ) . 
  wow , a `` leftist '' * revoluci\u00f3 dels somriures * attacking andalusians . 
  every day , you 're more similar to lega 's nord ethnic supremacism towards the poor regions . 
  that 's catalanism : i was told in school , we are better than the rest of spain just because we are catalans ( ethnic supremacism ) . 
  it 's better to ignore them because they like to make noises like catalonia were the best part and the center of the world ( it 's not , of course ; it 's just a normal place ) and not to discuss with them . 
  and all their problems are because of communism . 
  there are n't other factors implied . 
  only communism . 
  the spanish republic were not all communist . 
  indeed , communists were a minority . 
  there were it all in the republican side . 
  please , get informed about my country 's history . 
  do you know that spain was a fascist autarchy from 1939 to 1959 , the fascist state controlled almost all and free market did n't exist ? 
  it 's widespread in almost all spain . 
  indeed , international politics is synonymous with power politics and country 's interests . 
  i would like it were otherwise , but so it is . 
  i 'm not a fan of russia ( i 'm lgbt ) , but western mass medias and some politicians should finally understand that cold war is over . 
  i 've never heard that word meaning * hot dog * . 
  that 's in latin america , not in spain . 
  we say * perrito caliente * . 
  spain reached more gdp than canada in some years , if [ i remember well ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=wb-wdi#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country&amp;idim=country:can:esp:ita&amp;ifdim=country&amp;hl=es&amp;dl=es&amp;ind=false ) . 
  it never had more gdp than italy . 
  anyway , i did n't talk about it xd . 
  [ read ] ( http://www.publico.es/politica/aznar-desdeno-entrar-g-20.html ) , it 's very known in spain ( except for our nationalists ) . 
  spain is not in the g20 because aznar refused to get in . 
  he was most interested to get in g8 ( that 's why we were in iraq war ) . 
  and g20 is about the economy ... 
  very clever , you may be very voted . 
  but i 'm not a fan * conspiracy `` theory '' * , totally the contrary . 
  nation-states in the european union are a thing of the past . 
  the eu has a big part of our economic sovereignty and i think it 's likely that ue has mediated or tried to influence ( not conspired ) for pp can govern again , because pp economic policy is closer ideologically to eu economic policy than podemos . 
  and removing pedro s\u00e1nchez as psoe leader is the way to get it . 
  in my opinion , i think it 's naive to think that the eu has nothing to say in the spanish politics . 
  but i 'm a person and i can be wrong . 
  you can not agree with my hypothesis , but i 'm not talking about the bilderberg club or aliens . 
  it seems that we 'll have another pp government ... 
  i have the hypothesis that the eu is behind this to prevent a coalition government of psoe and podemos . 
  you 're totally right . 
  a nation . 
  we 're oppressed by the evil spanish state . 
  - language : it is true that catalan is a different language from spanish , but catalan ( in spain ) is also spoken in valencia , balearic islands , aragon and a little part of murcia ; so , catalan is also spoken in the rest of spain ; moreover , spanish is the native language of 50 % catalans and it 's known by most catalans . 
  therefore , the criterion of language as a differentiating factor is false , because catalan is spoken in the rest of spain as well and spanish is used in catalonia as much as catalan . 
  - history : catalonia has never been a sovereign political entity , although some catalanists have distorted or exaggerated some elements of our history since xix and nationalists believe so . 
  the territory of the current catalonia has never been an independent power . 
  the principality of catalonia belonged to the crown of aragon , which had a political union with the crown of castile me in late xiv . 
  this union was not fully until the war of spanish succession ( 1715 ) ... it 's much more complex than that ( war of segadors , etc. 
  ) , but in summary catalonia has almost the same history as valencia , aragon ( crown of aragon ) and spain since xiv , although the principality of catalonia ( never a kingdom ) had political and legal power in the crown of aragon and later inside the spanish monarchy or spain , like valencia or aragon . 
  also , iberians , romans , visigoths , arabians ... were here as the rest of spain . 
  the only differences i see it 's the * hereu * , we had our own medieval civil code ... 
  very few things , i think ... 
  i do n't see much more . 
  so , not different in a 95 % or so . 
  - art : western art as the rest of spain and all the western world . 
  there was catalan modernism , which is part of modernism . 
  not different . 
  - philosophy and ideas : idem . 
  - religion : roman catholicism as the rest of spain ( traditionally ) . 
  - literature : we share catalan literature with valencia , balearic island , etc. 
  ( rest of spain ) and spanish literature because we also speak spanish . 
  not different . 
  - clothing : western clothes as the rest of spain . 
  there 're traditional elements , like barretina , which is also used in valencia for example , and traditional clothes . 
  but nowadays who 's dressed like that on the street ? 
  not that much different . 
  - cuisine : there 're some elements that are different , but 90 % of our cuisine are the same as the valencia ( in the south they eat a lot of rice ) one and most mediterranean spain ( i have family in m\u00e1laga ; it 's almost the same , but too much `` pescaito frito '' there ) . 
  * pa amb tom\u00e0quet * is catal\u00e1n , but eaten in all spain ( * catalana * ) . 
  i do n't see many differences . 
  - folklore : there are some difference like sardana ( the modern sardana was invented by an andalusian ! ), 
  - traditions : * ti\u00f3 de nadal * , which is also celebrated in aragon ; sant jordi , here 's a difference ; * caganer * , it 's catalan , but it is popular and used in all spain ; bullfighting : it 's forbidden , but we still have awful traditions like * bou embolat * . 
  a shame . 
  there are more things to analyze but i can not analyze them all . 
  in my opinion , most of differences are trifle . 
  the main elements of our culture ( language , history , religion/philosophy and art ) are shared with the rest of spain in a high degree , or some parts of spain ( is n't catalan spoken in valencia ? ), 
  or even the rest of europe ( christianity , western philosophy and western art ; indo-european language ... ) . 
  of course spain is not a totally homogeneous country like france , italy , germany , usa are not ... as most countries in the world . 
  even catalonia is not homogeneous .
