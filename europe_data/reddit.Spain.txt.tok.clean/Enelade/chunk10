  he could fail or have success , but i think that 's the most likely thing to occur based on the experience of similar politicians in the recent decades . 
  let me be skeptical . 
  macron was a hollande 's minister ( the most detested president in the french fifth republic ) , but the magic of marketing has achieved macron appears as if he was a politician who has stemmed from civil society for regenerating french politics and as if he was n't related to hollande 's government nor his policy . 
  too much optimism , in my opinion . 
  it 's useless to discuss ideas with someone who has renounced reason for a ideology that has written the most awful pages of the europe 's history : nationalism . 
  have a good day . 
  abstract concepts ( like ethnicity ) can have many meanings because there 's nothing such * ethnicity * in the material world . 
  ethnicity is a human construct . 
  i only say i do n't like your definition of ethnicity because for me ethnicity is another thing . 
  you do n't know me , nor my ideas . 
  and if some ideas coincide with * `` textbook '' college freshman * , it does n't mean i 'm wrong or right , but [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ad_hominem ) . 
  you believe citizenship = * ethcnicity * . 
  you have more in common with some political movements in the 30s than with a western european . 
  yes , that 's a reality in spain , above all in the south and in the mediterranean coast : there 're many unregistered jobs in spain ... and you can receive money from the state if the government does n't know you 're working ( * picaresca * ) ... 
  very sad . 
  i did n't deny ethnicity , i deny your definition of ethnicity . 
  that 's different . 
  moreover , i defend the concept of citizenship . 
  do n't discuss about me ( i 'm not the issue ) , nor despise my arguments , discuss my statements with arguments . 
  who knows ? 
  i can change my opinion if someone convince me through reason . 
  interesting and thanks for your response . 
  i met two estonian girls in an esramus + program , they spoke russian and they consider themselves estonian , but also russian . 
  they have both identities . 
  i will label it * estonian nationalist supremacism towards russians * . 
  thanks for the idea . 
  you 're very kind . 
  did all the russian estonians invade estonia ? 
  did all the russian estonians repress people ? 
  do all the russian estonians deny all crimes ? 
  do all the russian estonians make propaganda ? 
  do all the russian estonians criticize the country * for not liking this situation * ? 
  obviously , not because every person is different . 
  stop generalizing against a collective , please . 
  you 're offending me for thinking different from you . 
  that 's not fair . 
  * russians * who live in estonia deserve respect and i defend it , maybe i 'm wrong , but i believe in human rights and dislike all kinds of nationalism . 
  past is past . 
  estonian russians are not your enemies , but they 're your fellow citizens that have a different background from you . 
  always , respect . 
  if you have ill-will towards fellow citizens for something that happened in the past and it 's not the current * ethnic russians ' * fault in most cases , it 's an evidence that estonia can not into nordics . 
  have you thought that in non ex-communist countries those labels among people of a same nationality may soud racist ? 
  that 's what i say . 
  because in wetern europe , nationality only matters . 
  it does n't matter if your native language is esperanto at your home or your parents are from kiribati islands , you have blue hair and many tattoes and believe in jewish god . 
  those labels are very subjetive . 
  but if their nationality is estonian , they are estonian . 
  the rest is racism or ill-will for something that happened in the past . 
  if their nationality is estonian , they 're estonian . 
  in andalusia , there 's a long tradition among artists to use the mother 's surname : diego rodr\u00edguez de silva y ** vel\u00e1zquez ** luis de argote y ** g\u00f3ngora ** federico garc\u00eda ** lorca ** jos\u00e9 ** antonio ** dom\u00ednguez ** bandera ** moreover , the factor that the first surname could be very common as a user said before . 
  is it necessary to label people as * ethnic russian * ? 
  in many western european countries it can sound racist and from the 19th century . 
  they 're only labels of a political axis that is not enough to explain how complex political reality is in the xxi century , in my opinion . 
  not supporting macron \u2260 not being anti-fascist . 
  for example , i can not support macron , nor support le pen because my left-wing political ideas are incompatible with macron 's socio - ( neo ? 
  ) liberalism and the far-right . 
  anyway , fn is not a fascist party . 
  it 's a far-right party , but not fascist . 
  it 's a different phenomenon , imo . 
  we do n't live in the xx century anymore . 
  i think we should n't use labels from the past to refer to new phenomena , although it 's far-right . 
  how many times have catalan nationalists declared the independence in the last 100 years ? 
  i lost count . 
  this is a media subsidized by the catalan government ( while they do not pay pharmacies ... ) with the aim of making foreigners believe that the catalan * process of independence * is being successful ; but it 's quite the contrary if you read the spanish news ( not * ara * or * el punt avui * ) . 
  most times in history catalan nationalists have been disunited like now , although they say the opposite . 
  at least , cup is sincere . 
  the most likely scenario is we 'll have another election in catalonia ( and erc may win ) . 
  i do n't agree . 
  my country is in the top 10 by scientific publications input ( if i 'm not wrong ) , and ... well ... 
  i was thinking about the tradition of analytic philosophy . 
  about scientific publications , what 's more important quantity or quality ? 
  in my opinion , the second one ; that 's why , germany , south korea or japan are technological potencies and the usa and the u.k. are scientific potencies . 
  at least , most scientific publications i read are from anglo-saxon countries . 
  it 's not because of the language , in my opinion , but those countries have a long tradition in scientific research ; although it seems the opposite in that statics . 
  i think it 's intellectually imprudent to compare catalonia and kosovo . 
  they are different cases . 
  in spain , most people watch eurovision to laugh at countries ' songs and performances ( included spain ) and how bad spain scores ( we love hating ourselves ) . 
  in the gay community , it 's a very famous show ( not all gay people like it , obviously ) ; but , almost nobody takes it seriously and that 's why , spain usually sends bad songs . 
  in the gay community , it 's a very watched show . 
  my parents had two children ( my sister and me ) i hope i 'll be able to adopt a boy when i 'm more than 40 years old . 
  a sensible answer , hallelujah . 
  false.the mission of rae is prescriptive for speaking a * good spanish * . 
  the norm is built by the users of a language everyday in every act of speaking , not but any state organization . 
  the standard spanish is composed by all the varieties of spanish . 
  that 's why , the next dictionary will be edited by the asale , not only by the rae . 
  and that 's why , in spanish we lack of ortological rules and it 's right to say * jacinto * as [ xa\u0325\u02c8\u03b8in\u032ato ] or [ ha\u0325\u02c8s\u033bin\u032ato ] so what ? 
  it 's intelligible . 
  so what ? 
  it 's intelligible . 
  i am not a historian , but i have a friend whose father was born in caracas because his grandparents ( galician ) had emigrated there , but in the 80s , they came to barcelona because in venezuela there were a lot of problems , like a high murder rate , and spain had improved economically very much in the two last decades and it has always been a very safe country . 
  what 's the point ? 
  the problems of venezuela ( the situation in venezuela ) are long-standing . 
  it 's not because you 're * socialist * now . 
  e.g. , if you go to google data and look for the inflation rates under carlos ' andr\u00e9s p\u00e9rez and following presidents , you 'll find out that venezuela 's inflation rates [ were also very high ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_defl_kd_zg&amp;fdim_y=inflation_type:1&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country&amp;idim=country:ven&amp;ifdim=country&amp;hl=es&amp;dl=es&amp;ind=false ) , although it does n't reach to the current inflation rate , and venezuela was n't socialist . 
  i 'm going to say something that does n't sound very good for you : most latin american countries have been an economical , political and social disaster for most time since they became independent from spain , except * cono sur * countries ( argentina , chile and uruguay ) . 
  e.g. , your homicide rates , as other latin american countries ' homicide rates , has been [ very high ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/vc.ihr.psrc.p5?locations=ve-co-mx-es&amp;view=chart ) compared to a normal wester european country . 
  moreover , you can not compare an eastern european country with any latin american country . 
  they are different cultures , situations , histories ... 
  i have just explained it on another comment . 
  i know that .
