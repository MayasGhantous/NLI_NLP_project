  i have just explained it on another comment . 
  thanks for your answer . 
  it 's very clarifying . 
  i 'm sorry for answering late , but i 've been very busy . 
  please , discuss the argument ; not the argumentative . 
  the rae 's aim is prescriptive for the * good * use of spanish . 
  there has never been a normative standardization of spanish because spanish had unintelligible dialects , like in basque . 
  it has never been necessary . 
  it 's clear that spanish has many spoken varieties , but , however spanish have many varieties , it 's clear that it 's very homogeneous . 
  in spanish , defined dialects do n't exist in many cases ; that 's why , we prefer to call them * spoken varieties * ( * hablas * ) , like andalusian ... so , in my opinion , the analogy with basque is very wrong . 
  anyway , as a linguist ( i must confess i 'm not any * authority on the subject * , but i know something about this ) , i have to say that dialects do n't exist . 
  the only thing that exists on the linguistic domain is isogloss : imaginary borders of linguistic features ( phonetics , grammar , lexicon , etc. ) . 
  those borders converge sometimes , but they diverge in most cases and in some cases like basque or german they diverge much , to the point that the speakers of a language can not understand among themselves and they need to use a spoken variety or dialect to understand among them . 
  in german is high german and in basque is euskera bat\u00faa . 
  due to this divergence , you can consider basque or german a set of languages or a language itself depending on the criteria . 
  there are a few of some authors that think that basque or german can be considered a group of languages because there is not the enough intelligibility . 
  but most linguists consider them as languages . 
  this is social science , it 's not physics or mathematics . 
  therefore , we can not establish any * scientific truth * . 
  i was only telling you the two opinions that exist in the academia . 
  the rae 's aim is prescriptive for the * good * buse of spanish . 
  rae does not make the the linguistic features ; the linguistic features of spanish are made everyday by the 500 million spanish speakers . 
  so , the speakers are who make the norm . 
  rae only * gives advices * , like * solo * instead of * s\u00f3lo * . 
  why ? 
  because there are many speakers that do n't mark never the stressed vowel and it 's not necessary because it 's * llana * and it ends in a vowel . 
  the variety of spanish that is taught to foreigners depends on the area or your teacher . 
  if you learn spanish in mexico or your teacher is mexican , you will learn a mexican spoken variety . 
  that 's a false analogy . 
  the rae has never created a * united spanish * because we do n't need it . 
  no , that 's normative linguistics and i 'm talking about linguistics . 
  anyway , it does n't matter because it 's related ; the rae has never created a * united spanish * for all the speakers from all over the world can understand among us , because a murciano could understand a gaditano before the creation of the rae ( 1713 ) and also a person from rio de plata or from m\u00e9xico city . 
  could a person from soule understand a person from biscay before * euskera bat\u00faa * ? 
  i tend to doubt it . 
  if a person that speaks * suletino * , e.g. , can understand a person that speaks * vizca\u00edno * , why was * united basque * created ( besides being normative ) ? 
  but most young people speak * euskera bat\u00faa * ( * united basque * ) which is a spoken and normative variety of basque , based on the basque central * dialects * ( or basque languages according to some linguists \u00b0 ) and created by very good linguists in the 60s ( under franco 's dictatorship ... ) . 
  if a kid , that has studied at a ikastola , talks in * euskera bat\u00faa * to his grandmother that speaks suletino dialect , it 's likely they would find some difficulties to understand between them . 
  \u00b0 the border between the categories * language * and * dialect * are very fuzzy in many cases . 
  in a human science like linguistics , the classification of a language or dialect in one of these twos categories depends on many criteria , some of them are extra-linguistic . 
  even so , the spanish do n't think so , except about oil . 
  my 24 years living in spain with spanish and catalan language ( i understand all ) and culture , my experience living now in barcelona and statistics are more representative than your experience and arrogance . 
  do n't give me lessons about my country , please . 
  you can not know spain more than me or a spaniard . 
  what an intellectual arrogance !, 
  we are not special . 
  every spaniard knows that ( we are not a nationalist country ) . 
  it 's not necessary you tell us . 
  i 've lived all my life in spain ( 24yo ) and i do n't know my country well . 
  i 'm still learning about spain . 
  but you know my country better than me or a spaniard , ok . 
  the spanish do not believe that spain is the best country , totally the contrary . 
  we believe we 're the worst country and all the countries are better than us . 
  another proof you do n't know spain . 
  madrid can not be repesenative of a very , very diverse country . 
  but if my experience and other people 's experience coincidence with [ statistics ] ( https://c.tribune.com.pk/2013/06/563152-pakistanhomosexualitymap-1371189486-691-640x480.jpg ) , who 's right ? 
  to live in spain as foreigner = / = to know [ spain ] ( http://media2.policymic.com/e68de1a86d84df90890e04286274f4af.png ) . 
  that 's a proof . 
  my case : i grew up in a small town in catalonia . 
  i was openly out when i was 15 years old and all the high school knows it , a lesbian friend had a girlfriend and they kissed usually after getting out of high school ( it was totally normal ) and my philosophy teacher was married to my p. e. teacher ( both women ) . 
  i 'm talking about a small town in 2010 and 2011 , not about big cities . 
  when you have lived under an intolerant fascist dictatorship for almost 40 years , you do n't want far-right parties , like in france or afd , and you only want freedom and respect for other people 's freedom . 
  it 's not our lifestyle ( nonsense ) ... we choose freedom and tolerance . 
  that 's the right answer . 
  [ isma\u00ebl l\u00f4 - tajabone ] ( https://youtu.be/569-lmw2c-m ), 
  that could be considered patriotism , that is a different concept from nationalism . 
  both concepts are usually confused . 
  human geography is not only location . 
  it 's also culture , economics , politics ... 
  therefore , for me , central europe is germany , switzerland , liechtenstein and austria . 
  spanish has two phonological systems : - minority system ( a.k.a. 
  * castilian spanish * in english ) . 
  it 's only spoken in northern and central spain and it 's based on the way of speaking of the inhabitants from cities of old castile , like valladolid or burgos . 
  it 's spoken in many areas of southern spain , canary islands , all latin america , usa , equatorial guinea ... usually , it 's based on the capital city dialect . 
  for example , the * mexican dialect * is based on the dialect of mexico city and the * argentinian dialect * is based on buenos aires ' dialect ( * porte\u00f1o * ) . 
  nevertheless , this is in the media and schools , because the association of spanish academies ( asale ) and above all the royal spanish academy have n't stablished one standard of spanish and they say all the dialects are the same ; therefore , in spanish we have a lot cities : old castile , seville ( andalusia 's * seseo * ) , buenos aires , lima , caracas , la habana , mexico city , tegucigalpa , bogot\u00e1 ... because spanish is the sum of all its dialects ( * supranorma * ) . 
  consequently , we do n't have a standard , but many standards and they all are correct . 
  the crown of aragon does n't have a capital * de iure * , it was an itinerant capital . 
  i would create two capital cities : madrid , that would remain being the capital as the co-capital ( there would be only ministries and the senate ) on behalf of the former crown of castile , and barcelona on behalf of the former crown of aragon , where the federal parliament and the presidential palace of the spanish republic would be located . 
  is it albania a secular society that is willing to respect fully and extend the rights and freedoms of women , lgbt and other minorities ? 
  if the answer is * yes * , it 's okay with me . 
  language is not the only element that composes a culture . 
  i think european union means a union of states that are located in europe and have a european culture . 
  this excludes canada , for example , although its main cultural base is european and it also excludes turkey because it 's a muslim country . 
  a fundamental part of the european culture is christianity ( as an atheist , i have to recognise it ) and secularism ; therefore , if a country does n't meet these requirements ( among others ) , i think it 's very unlikely that a country can join the eu ( the turkey 's case ) . 
  it 's not only geography or only culture in my opinion . 
  so , i think it 's not going to happen , but in the hypothetical case it happens , it would depend on the country . 
  it 's not the same australia as yemen . 
  if most catalan media do it , it does n't mean it 's grammatically right . 
  according to * the manual of the new grammar of the spanish language * of the asale ( association of spanish language academies ) , * catalu\u00f1a * is the correct term in spanish as london also is . 
  for example , if you 're speaking spanish or catalan , you do n't say `` vivo en london '' or `` visc a london '' ( it 's wrong and pedantic ) , but `` vivo en londres '' or `` visc a londres '' . 
  but the redditor used * catalu\u00f1a * in an english text , that 's also wrong because the word * catalu\u00f1a * does not exist in english . 
  it 's catalonia . 
  you 're right at that point . 
  i think it was necessary ... my paternal grandfather was in prison in those years only for being an underground member of the communist party , psuc ( what a crime ) . 
  the bad part is many people who committed real crimes against humanity went unpunished . 
  i was born two decades later , but if i place myself into context -- it was a repressive dictatorship which political legitimacy was winning a brutal and bloody civil war thanks ( partly ) to hitler and mussolini -- , i think it was necessary in the transition to democracy . 
  even though , it was very unfair because there were people that did nothing wrong ( political prisoner of the regime ) , like my grandfather , and murderers ... 
  it could have been done otherwise . 
  yes , towards the roman empire .
