  in southern spain , i love [ bolonia 's beach ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/playa_de_bolonia_%28tarifa%29.jpg/320px-playa_de_bolonia_%28tarifa%29.jpg ) ( there are ruins of a roman city there ) . 
  in northern spain , i like cies islands and san sebastian 's main beach ... [ i love that city ] ( http://www.monteigueldo.com/imageneswp/gallery_hotel-sansebastian01_1000x631.jpg ) . 
  in catalonia , i love some little and wonderful beaches in girona , but i 'm not going to say their names ; it 's a secret ... 
  that 's a wrong conception about spain without any historical or political basis , in my opinion . 
  now , i get it . 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  no , i 'm asking it because we 're in 2017 and castile does n't exist as a political entity since 1715 . 
  i read foreigners here talking about * castile * and catalonia and also basque country ( crown of castile and \u00c1lava was part part of the kingdom of castile ... ) and i just wonder because castile does n't exist for almost all spaniards , except as an historical region ... and i personally do n't see a person from soria comparing those provinces with catalonia and vice-versa . 
  it was n't my intention to sound pedantic . 
  it 's my way of writing . 
  in spain , it 's usually city vs. city ( above all , in football ) . 
  the most famous is madrid vs. barcelona . 
  but , it also exists : la coru\u00f1a vs. vigo ; seville vs. m\u00e1laga ; santa cruz de tenerife vs. las palmas de gran canaria , etc. 
  among regions and as far as i know , there 's only * rivalry * comparing economically madrid with catalonia in the media ... 
  there 's an economical apocalypse in catalonia and i 've never realised it ... maybe , there are other examples among regions that i do n't know . 
  i did n't know we had such rivalry in spain . 
  could you define what 's * castille * nowadays ? 
  the only thing i mind about this is that gibraltar is a tax haven that damages the economy of spain and of the e.u. 
  i do n't care about the sovereignty of gibraltar as most spaniards also do according to the polls ( another issue is the pp 's government ... ) . 
  [ alhambra ] ( http://www.wallpapersxl.com/wallpapers/1366x768/alhambra/454612/alhambra-granada-spanien-computer-hd-454612.jpg ) of granada . 
  i live in one of those regions and the nationalist/populist ideology distorts totally the real image of spain . 
  spain is a fantastic country with bad things and good things like every country in the world . 
  for me , my country means my family and friends , freedom ( as a lgbt person , i 'm very glad to be born in spain ; although , there 's homophobia like in every country in the world ) , solidarity because spanish society is very solidary ( we 're the first country in organ donations ) , diversity because spain is a multilingual country and there 's a big diversity of landscapes , architecture styles , food ... and tolerance because we do n't have any xenophobic parties in our parliaments and the spanish society received and integrated well the 7 m of immigrants that arrived here the last decade . 
  my city , barcelona  spanish/catalan  the mediterranean sea  latin europe  western europe  western civilization . 
  i do n't indentify myself as european , but with latin and western european because i think i have very few things in common with someone from latvia , for example . 
  well , this is nothing compared to the racist comments of ( ex ) * father of the catalan homeland * against andalusians in a book in the 60 's ... 
  most of us do n't give a damn . 
  my ancestors were likely at a bucolic village in catalonia or andalusia , while their ancestors committed immoral acts against the indigenous people . 
  also , there are a lot of myths about this ( * the black legend * ) and most latin american countries are undeveloped countries with a very bad educational system ... 
  they do n't even realize they 're the descendants of the conquerors ... 
  except cup in catalonia ( minority here and not for xenophobic or selfish reasons ) , i think there is n't any member of any party who supports to leave the eu at any regional parliaments or at the national parliament . 
  so , no . 
  if there 's a illegal referendum , nationalists will make the fool of themselves again because they will be the only people who would vote . 
  and it 's impossible to hold a legal referendum . 
  the catalan government can declare the independence of catalonia when they want . 
  why do n't they do it ? 
  they know the support of independence is not a majority ( despite some polls and propaganda ) in catalonia and they do n't have any international support . 
  the process of catalonia 's independence is dead , but nobody says it . 
  i 'd like to add that * ustedes * is also pretty common in andalusia ( southern spain ) , even in informal contexts ; also , * ustedes * is used there with the * vosotros ' conjugation * ( it 's funny ) . 
  moreover , in spanish it exists the pronoun * vos * ( it has the same root that the french pronoun * vous * ) , which is archaic in spain , but it 's very used in [ argentina , uruguay , paraguay , some regions in colombia , bolivia , etc. 
  and in some central american countries ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/voseo-extension-real.png ) . 
  * vos * means * t\u00fa * in spanish . 
  so , in spanish we have * t\u00fa / vos * ( informal `` you '' ) and * usted * or * ustedes * ( formal `` you '' ) . 
  in catalan , we also have the pronouns * vost\u00e8 * and * v\u00f3s * , but they 're very formal . 
  i only use it when i talk to old people or when a teacher wanted we call him/her * vost\u00e8 * at university or high school or in administrations . 
  * tu/vosaltres * are far more used . 
  it 's more fluid . 
  in spain , the older generations ( + 65 years old ) tend to be very catholic . 
  they grew up in a catholic dictatorship with a lot of * brainwashing * at schools . 
  many of them are voters of pp ( conservative party ) , which was founded by an ex minister of franco the generations between 45 and 65 years old ( my parents ' generations ) grew in the last years of franco 's dictatorship , that was a bit * softer * than in the 40s and 50s because the dictatorship had to open to the world for survival , so they were influenced by foreigners ( above all on the coast by tourists ) and some foreign culture that the dictatorship allowed . 
  they are more broad-minded than the older generations and , although many of them label themselves as catholic , many of them are n't really catholic , in my opinion . 
  for example , my mother labels herself as a catholic , but she hates the catholic church ( she links it with fascism ) , she never goes to church , i have never seen her praying , she does n't follow the catholic doctrine at all ... she just says that she believes in an * `` energy '' * and that 's why , she 's a catholic . 
  is that catholicism ? 
  my generation , * millennials * ( 18-35 years old ) , are very irreligious . 
  most of them are atheists . 
  above all , youngsters from the cities . 
  in barcelona , young people who i know that really believe in god can be counted on the fingers of one hand and some fingers are left out . 
  maybe , in the rural areas , it 's a bit different , but this is the most common thing among people with university degrees and who live in the cities in spain . 
  catholicism , modest and kind people and people that get married very young . 
  it 's very tiring . 
  the only wrong thing here is you do n't know that the last polls say that separatism is a considerable minority in catalonia ( 45 % ) and podemos won in catalonia in the last two elections . 
  the rae 's dictionary is a definition 's dictionary of words , not dictionary of meaning of concepts . 
  you need a philosophical dictionary to know the definition ** s ** of * nation * . 
  but nationalists think that their definition of nation is the only that exists and , therefore , the true one . 
  there are many definitions of nation and there are some people that do n't like the nationalist/romanticist definition of * nation * that led europe to two world wars and a dictatorship in spain . 
  as you can see in [ stanford encyclopedia of philosophy ] ( https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nationalism/#whanat ) , the meaning of * nation * is far more complex than rae 's dictionary says ... 
  spanish culture is the synthesis of all the regional cultures of spain ... or do you think that provence is the same as calais ? 
  no , of course , because france , as every country which is not a microstate , has many cultures and those cultures compose the country 's culture . 
  all the cultures in the world compose mankind 's culture , for example . 
  diversity does not make that spanish culture does n't exist , diversity makes spanish culture wonderful . 
  that 's false . 
  the clich\u00e9s about spanish culture came from romanticist travelers from northern europe in the xix century . 
  it 's not related to fascism . 
  it 's much before . 
  do you know bizet 's * carmen * ? 
  it 's one century before franco . 
  it 's not spanish ( it 's french ) , but it 's about a spanish gipsy woman and spain ( seville ) : [ carmen - habanera ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj_hhrjf0xg ) also , * concierto de aranjuez * , as a spaniard said before , [ * asturias * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeffbut3i6a ) of isaac alb\u00e9niz ; [ * el amor brujo * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuir35l5y8u ) of falla ; [ * malague\u00f1a * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b6jouzbkyc ) of alb\u00e9niz and in opera , maybe the most famous one is [ * granada * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r05ytpruwou ) . 
  not everybody from the same country have the same accent . 
  every person pronounces a phoneme different from another person . 
  native language can influence the way someone speaks english , of course , but there are other factors that are not related to nationality or native language that can influence your accent , like your english proficiency . 
  so , for me , that 's to generalize a lot . 
  also , `` worst '' is a subjective category and it depends on taste , and the taste depends on your personal experience ... and i think there are not `` worst '' or `` best '' accents , there are only different accents . 
  * different * just means different . 
  short answer : ideology . 
  i do not like people disappear , but if your current government disappears , i 'd be very happy . 
  you can restore it in 4 years . 
  i love your literature and i hate putin . 
  anglo-saxon countries , like the united states , are like a * graft * of europe in america and in oceania because the indigenous people ... where are they ... ? 
  and latin america is a mix of indigenous cultures , european cultures and , in some areas , african cultures . 
  does australia , nz , usa or canada have an indigenous president and are most of their inhabitants indigenous like bolivia ? 
  i think that 's the answer . 
  of course , there 're some countries like argentina , uruguay or even chile that maybe they can be considered western countries . 
  maybe . 
  it depends on the country . 
  in spain , although some members of pp ( liberal-conservative party ) can be very conservative and a bit reactionary , there are not members of the * far-right * , * populism right * or * alt-right * ( however you want to label them ) at the regional parliaments or the national parliaments . 
  if you 're latin american , do n't take the avarage opinion of this forum as the avarage european opinion ... 
  i love latin america because of its cultural and linguistic diversity ; your way of speaking spanish and portuguese in brazil ; how different is a country from another in many aspects : there are very * conservative * countries and there are many * progressive * countries or regions ( although some people here do n't know it , argentina - for example - is more open to lgbt people and have more rights for us than italy and much more than the eastern european countries ) ; also , i love your geographical and natural diversity ; your literature ; how some countries are growing economically so much ( others are n't ... ) ; the way you see life ... 
  the only thing i do n't like is your resentment towards spaniards and spain for something that some spaniards did some centuries ago . 
  it 's totally irrational , it does n't make sense . 
  i do n't know where you 're from ( maybe from an anglo-saxon country ... ?
