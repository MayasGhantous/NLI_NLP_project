  the catalan parliament can declare the unilateral independence whenever they want ; indeed , the * catalan state * was declared twice in the xx century . 
  however , if you do n't undertake a sovereign act against the spanish state ( `` a state is a human community that ( successfully ) claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory '' -- max weber ) or any important country at the international level recognizes catalonia as a sovereign state ( nauru island is not on the list ) , i doubt that it could be successful . 
  [ catalonia is ** not ** one of the territories with the right to self-determination ( source in spanish ) . ], 
  ( http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2015/10/30/actualidad/1446231111_709046.html ) `` ( ... ) [ ban ki-moon ] called `` the leaders and the catalan people to commit to the dialogue to seek a consensual solution ; '' and concluded that `` catalonia in not included in the category of territories not autonomous '' , in which are grouped the territories without full self-government within the framework of the process of decolonization ( ... ) . 
  a positive aspect of spain is that ** there is respect for diversity : culture , languages and traditions ** . 
  the catalan issue is a very delicate matter and , as secretary-general of the united nations , i am not in a position to comment , because ** it is a purely internal matter ** . 
  however , i hope that that there will be a consensual solution . 
  based on the dialogue and in line with the democratic tradition . 
  i call leaders and the catalan people to commit to the dialogue ( ... ) . '', 
  greetings from spain !, 
  it implies a political union because because those territories have a same ruler . 
  freedom of speech is a right . 
  every right implies an obligation . 
  your obligation is using your right of freedom of speech ethically ; that 's why , freedom of speech has legal limits , like public defamation or inciting violence for example . 
  are there pro-independence movements in andalusia and in aragon ? 
  four men and a dog . 
  and catalan nationalism in val\u00e8ncia and balearic islands ? 
  good joke . 
  but , let 's assume that fillon achieves the second round , instead of macron . 
  do you think that the french left , which has a long tradition of anti-catholicism and it 's very statist , is going to vote a neoliberal and catholic ( and nepotistic ) politician or are they going to abstain ? 
  i personally think that unfortunately it 's not that much unlikely that le pen wins if fillon achieves the second round ... 
  i think we should be prudent with polls . 
  there may be people who say they 're going to vote x or they 're going to abstain , instead of saying they 're going to vote a far-right party because it 's more * politically correct * . 
  le pen can have a lot of hidden vote . 
  in spain , we have a very big demographic problem in the northwest ( galicia , asturias and historical region of leon ) and in most areas of the historical region of castile ( except madrid ) and aragon . 
  the mediterranean coast , the islands , some areas in basque country and madrid with all its metropolitan area keep growing demographically , but less than in the past decade . 
  so , there are areas highly populated like the mediterranean coast and there are provinces like teruel , guadalajara , soria ... that are a _ demographic desert _ . 
  in law , the labels are fundamental . 
  if it 's not called _ marriage _ , but something similar to a partnership in slovenian , it 's not equal marriage . 
  it 's just a partnership with full rights . 
  maybe i am wrong , but ... 
  i do n't understand this news . 
  is the same in germany , right ? 
  yes , that 's why i do n't understand this news . 
  except ethiopia 's constitution , all the constitutions in the world defends the nation 's unity . 
  that 's why , the quebec 's referendums about independence were declared illegal in canada . 
  an example , the first article of the norway 's constitution : \u00a7 1 [ integrity of the kingdom ], 
  it 's not sensationalist at all . 
  i remember economic forecasts in 2005 saying that spain will overcome french gdp per capita in 10 and we will have the same total gdp as the italian one ... lol . 
  why spain is more * traditional * than italy ? 
  the most important spanish regions recognized same-sex partnership in the lately 90s ( catalonia , 1998 ) and in the early 00s ( andalusia , madrid , vel\u00e8ncia in 2001 ) , we have equal marriage since 2005 in all the country and italy just recognized same-sex partnership in 2016 . 
  that 's an example . 
  it 's likely that the spanish society is one of the european societies with less * traditional values * nowadays . 
  it seems it 's based on clich\u00e9s more than facts . 
  indeed , the provinces with less purchasing power in spain are the provinces with less inhabitants , like soria or teruel . 
  this map is very related to population . 
  another jakubmarian 's map ( this guy says galician and and portuguese are still the same language ... ) with mistakes . 
  first of all , in spain there are more languages : galician , basque , catalan and gascon from aran valley ( occitan ) . 
  secondly , in spanish the < \u00ef  exists in poetry . 
  so , if you read a poem in spanish , you can find it . 
  and the < \u00fd  is totally archaic in spanish like the < \u00e7  . 
  nowadays , nobody writes _ \u00dd\u00f1igo _ or _ otros\u00fd _ . 
  it also shows spanish is lexically closer to [ catalan ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/occitano-romance_languages ) than to galician and that 's a very big mistake . 
  nationalist politicians can declare catalonia 's unilateral independence if they go out on the generalitat 's balcony in pla\u00e7a sant jaume and say : `` catalonia is now independent !, 
  it 's very easy and [ it happened twice in the ii spanish republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_republic ) ( but inside an * iberian federation * ) . 
  why do n't they do it ? 
  i tend to think it 's because of these two main factors : 1 . 
  they do n't have the support of any important country in the world . 
  if lithuania ( no offense ) or kiribati islands recognize you , it has the same legal effect as dancing a sardana ( typical catalan dance ) in the generalitat 's balcony . 
  nothing . 
  you need the recognitions of the whole international community and it implies the recognition of very important countries , which many of them have separatist movements , like china or russia . 
  usa is not going to recognize catalonia 's unilateral independence , because it implies destabilizing spain and this country is a very important military ally because its geostrategic position and its military bases in southern spain and i guess donald trump does n't even know that catalonia exists nor cares about this issue ... it 's very unlikely that the u.k recognizes an unilateral declaration of independence for scotland and northern ireland ( imo ) and france ( corsica , very minority - and nationalists want to annex the catalan speaking french region ... ) , germany ( bavaria , very minority ) and italy ( northern italian regions ) have separatist movements ( mostly , minority ) and to recognize the catalan independence may imply stimulating those pro-independence movements and the bankrupt of spain . 
  this country is `` too big to fail '' and it may lead to another crisis in the eurozone . 
  european politicians are not mad . 
  they do n't have the support of most catalans ( more than 50 % in mathematics ) . 
  the most important factor in my opinion . 
  catalan nationalists are very , very noisy . 
  i 'm catalan , i know this very well . 
  they can organize demonstrations of one million people ( we 're 7,5 million inhabitants ) and other massive acts with public money of all spaniards ( no negueu l'evid\u00e8ncia ) . 
  according to the last poll , the support of the independence was about 45 % . 
  i suspect that it 's even lower in the whole population because in catalonia it 's * politically correct * to be nowadays a pro-independence supporter . 
  there 's a data in the catalan government 's polls that make me suspect . 
  according to the last poll ( if i am not wrong ) , tv3 is the most watched tv in catalonia , but telecinco is the most watched tv in catalonia ( like in the rest of the spain ) according to tv shares . 
  there 's a contradiction . 
  and if we consider that many catalans think that the catalan tv has a quality similar to bbc and telencinco is widely seen in spain as a trash television ( that 's absolutely right ) , we can come to the conclusion that many people do n't tell the truth because they feel ashamed that they like telecinco or they agree with pp ... in the last spanish elections , pp got 462.637 votes ( almost no one is going to recognize openly in catalonia that they vote pp ; i do n't know anyone ) and the party of the current catalan president got 481.839 votes . 
  almost the same . 
  how do you explain this ? 
  do people say in polls what 's * politically correct * ? 
  can they declare an unilateral independence ? 
  of course , whenever nationalists want . 
  is this possible independence declaration going to lead to a factual independence ? 
  i personally think it 's extremely unlikely . 
  maybe in your nationalist dreams ; it 's extremely unlikely in reality because spain is a very pacifist society and we do n't have xenophobic parties in our parliaments , unlike some other countries ... 
  first of all , the spanish south is wealthier than southern italy and there is not mafia ... 
  moreover , not all the northern spain is rich as northern italy . 
  galicia nor asturias are rich regions ... 
  i do n't understand the comparison ... also , andalusia is a much big as continental portugal , so there are too [ * andalusias * ] ( https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/las_dos_andaluc%c3%adas ) in which there 're some differences between them . 
  so , if we are generalising about spain because there are differences among regions , in andalusia it happens the same , but we lack of data . 
  i guess in marbella ( * alta andaluc\u00eda * ) they get better results than in a village in cordoba ( * baja andaluc\u00eda * ) . 
  people who do n't know andalusia wel tend to think that all andalusia is the same , but andalusia is very heterogeneous , socially and economically . 
  i 'm proud to be from barcelona , catalan and spanish for this . 
  many people from some european countries should learn from us : solidarity . 
  by the way , the spanish 19 % unemployment is not real due to the unregistered economy . 
  indeed , castile is not even an united political entity nowadays . 
  it 's said , now it only exists in history 's books . 
  almost all constitutions in the world are the same , you 're ( the uk ) the exception . 
  there is not any doubt in academia that the language spoken in eastern aragon is catalan . 
  * corona catalano-aragonesa fiasco * is the name of a kingdom in a tolkien 's map . 
  in the oriental part of aragon , catalan is spoken . 
  where is it ?
