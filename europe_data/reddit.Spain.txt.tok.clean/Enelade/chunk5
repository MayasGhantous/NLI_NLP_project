  catalan is not spoken in all val\u00e8ncia . 
  for example , requiel and utena were part of castile until the creation of the provinces by javier de burgos in 1833 . 
  in \u00c1lava ( one of the areas where spanish -- as castilian -- was born ) and western biscay , basque started to recede in xvi century according to some documents ... poor catalan speakers in murcia ... are now ( now ) the real ( real spoken ) astur-leonese and aragonese languages ? 
  it 's a very debatable topic in academia ( despite ethnologue says from texas ) . 
  i do n't have a clear opinion about that . 
  not accurate in that part , in my opinion . 
  in my personal opinion , spain is * de jure * an unitary state , but * de facto * is almost ( repeat : almost ) a federal state because it works very similar to a federal state . 
  we only need regions can collect taxes and write in the constitution that spain is a federal state ( to change the label ) . 
  the label * piigs * is very unfair because different economies are putting into the same box . 
  every country is different . 
  between 1998 and 2017 [ spain 's gdp grew at 3,8 % as average ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.kd.zg?end=2015&amp;locations=es&amp;start=1998 ) . 
  not bad for a developed country . 
  since 2008 until 2013 spain 's gdp shrunk 7,6 % , but in 2014 spain 's gdp grew 1,3 % and in 2015 and 2016 spain 's gdp grew 3,2 % ( both years ) . 
  also , spain [ is now exporting more than ever . ], 
  ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ne.exp.gnfs.zs?end=2015&amp;locations=es&amp;start=1960 ) . 
  so , my question is : if the euro is so * bad * , why spain 's economy has grown so much ( except in the period 2008-2014 ) ? 
  [ not now ] ( https://javiersevillano.es/imagenes/bdebalanceconcee.jpg ) and less in the next years . 
  this pic is a prove of that censorship . 
  in which planet do you live ? 
  not in this one . 
   belief in god in europe * cultural catholicism * . 
  irish people on this forum explain it very well because the same phenomenon also happens in ireland : people label themselves as catholic and they say they believe in * god * ( whatever it means ) for cultural reasons . 
  they are not really catholic . 
   gdp per capita in europe about gdp : first of all , [ that map is wrong ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k5xne7j.jpg ) . 
  secondly , it 's better [ nominal gdp per capita ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4b3i35/gdp_per_capita_nominal_2016_imf_estimates/ ) which is not distorted by inflation ( that 's why , some eastern countries seem to be * rich * ) and thirdly , gdp per capita does n't show well the wealth of a nation ; you need more economic indicators . 
   credit ratings credit ratings does n't deserve a comment ...  life expectancy - [ spain is the fifth country in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_life_expectancy#list_by_the_world_health_organization_.282015.29 ) by life expectancy in the world according to the world health organization and the second in the oecd . 
  i disagree . 
  as a gay spaniard , i think the data are very plausible . 
  spain religious ( a smile was drawn in my face ) ? 
  please , do n't speak about a society you do n't know . 
  after 40 years of a catholic dictatorship , even many people who label themselves as catholic do n't like the catholic church ... 
  breathtaking region . 
  i 'm not british and i think it 's not my business , but i hope the united kingdom will remain united because i want the best for you as for everyone and i think the independence of scotland will bring more bad things than good things . 
  the spanish constitution can declare that the law of gravity is abolished , but the gravity is there . 
  i mean the laws do n't make facts . 
  catalonia is n't a country yet and it has never been , unlike scotland . 
  come on ... anc is highly subsidized by generalitat . 
  we 're not children . 
  i 'm also catalan and what he says is right . 
  people here are more interested in their own lifes , crisis , corruption and bar\u00e7a than in supporting mas , and you know it . 
  it 's very likely this has made by generalitat for propaganda . 
  people supporting a ** likely ** corrupted politician ( see the last news about corruption 's cases in catalonia ) and pressing the justice ( do nationalists understand separation of powers ? ) ... 
  nationalists make all catalans feel ashamed for their these sad and ridiculous spectacles ... not all the catalans think the same . 
  i know that astur-leonese ( * asturian * for asturian nationalists -- the real name of that linguistic variaty is * amaestau * ) and aragonese are considered languages on the internet because of ethnologue and wikipedia ... , but in academia it 's a bit different ... as a linguist , i find a bit unfair ( i know i 'm not politically correct ) to put them in languages ' maps at the same level as catalan , spanish , basque ... 
  indeed , there are phonetically more divergences from the word * gracias * ( [ \u02c8g\u027eas\u032ai\u00e6 ] ) in andalusian spanish from cordoba ( for example ) than * gracies * ( the open and central vowel / a / becomes a bit closed / e / ) and * grazias * ( it 's likely that it has the same pronounciation as * gracias * in standard spanish from spain ... ) . 
  it could be easier to understand * asturian * or aragonese than to understand some andalusians ... 
  they were languages in the past , but now ... maybe , is it confused diachrony with synchrony ... ? 
  it 's just my personal opinion . 
  the * celtics * were a culture more than a group of people genetically similar . 
  another poll that shows spain is not as much catholic as many people can think ( i do n't mean here ) due to our history . 
  it 's a very tiring clich\u00e9 ... 
  better , discuss with the un . 
  how is it possible to quantify * freedom * objectively ? 
  if you open a philosophy 's dictionary , you 'll see there are many definitions of freedom ( some of them are contradictory ) . 
  what kind of * freedom * does it supposedly measure ? 
  gdp per capita =| = nation 's wealth ( there are better economic indicators or set of economic indicators ) . 
  qatar has one of the highest gdp per capita ( oil ) . 
  just saying ... also , i 'd like to add that gdp ( nominal ) per capita is much better because it eliminates the fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country 's currency and , therefore , it shows us more * realistic * data ... 
  without inflation , that can distort gdp , we can see that [ portugal is not * poorer * than any eastern country ] ( http://statisticstimes.com/economy/countries-by-projected-gdp-capita.php ) , except slovenia . 
  moreover , my country has n't overcome italy yet . 
  gini coefficient ( i think those data are based on that coefficient ) is very misleading because you can be a very equal society in poverty , like cuba . 
  anyway , i agree with you on spain needs to be more equal economically . 
  we do n't need a language to create a united nation . 
  indeed , the idea of * a language , a state * is a french idea and it 's false and very harmful for minority languages . 
  there are around 200 states in the world and there are more 7.000 recognised languages in the world ( 35 languages by state ) . 
  it means that , unless you 're a little island in the middle of the ocean like iceland or a micro-state like san marino , most countries in the world are multilingual . 
  in my opinion , switzerland is a good example for an european nation . 
  i think they believe they 're still an impire . 
  in my opinion , that 's wishful thinking ... 
  in 2002 , morocco attacked the little spanish island of perejil and the only eu country that supported us was italy ( our cousins ) . 
  france betrayed us and supported morocco . 
  `` normally , the hcp takes care to state that the ehci is limited to measuring the, 
  i thought ireland was in western europe ... 
  it 's the gdp growth in a quarter . 
  spain 's gdp grew 3.2 % in 2016 . 
  why do these contests still exist ? 
  how can you quantify beauty to say that someone is the most beautiful woman/man in the world ? 
  these contests do n't make sense , in my opinion . 
  there 's a strong correlation between economic crisis in catalonia and independence support . 
  catalan pro-independence support has always existed in catalonia since lately xix and early xx and historically the support of independence was around 15 - 20 % ( never more than 20 % ) . 
  the crisis began in september 2007 but in spain we started noticing its effects in 2008 and 2009 , [ as you can see in this graph ] ( https://i2.wp.com/debate21.es/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/gr\u00e1fico-12.png ) catalan pro-independence support started increasing in those years ; in 2010 , catalan independence support increased again due to the sentence against * estatut * ( although the tendency has been there ) ; nevertheless , it was in 2011 ( 15-m ) and above all in 2012 and 2013 when the support of independence increased a lot . 
  it correlates with pp government , cdc 's explicitly support of independence and the worst years of crisis . 
  so , i think it 's normal independence support tends to decrease when the effects of the crisis tend to decrease . 
  i disagree with you on independence support is not based on national identity . 
  in catalonia , national identity is very linked to use of languages ( not totally , of course ) . 
  it 's very likely that a spanish speaker from a town of baix llobregat feels spanish/catalan and vote non-nationalist parties ( if you watch the votes in l'hospitalet or cornell\u00e0 , you 'll see this is what mostly happens ) , unlikely a catalan speaker from olot or ripoll ... 
  it seems to be there 's a strong correlation between language as the primary use and [ pro-independence support ] ( http://politikon.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/graphvar3.png ) . 
  nevertheless , there are many different cases , like rufi\u00e1n . 
  i do n't you mean with * current media narrative * , but it 's a open secret in catalonia that the * proc\u00e9s * ( catalan independence process for foreigners ) is stagnant and its support is decreasing . 
  yes , you 're right . 
  i was mistaken . 
  the 3rd one is spain , not slovenia . 
  es = ** es ** pa\u00f1a * ( spain ) . 
  spain has always had a [ high unemployment compared to the rest of western europe ] ( http://ep00.epimg.net/economia/imagenes/2016/01/28/empleo/1453966009_115531_1454010645_noticia_normal.png ) . 
  there are many factors : economic factors , like our dependence to tourism , or cultural factors , like * picard\u00eda * ; we have a literary genre about that , [ * picaresca * ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/picaresque_novel ) : in spain , there 're many people that are working and the government does not know anything ... because salaries are low and you can also receive the unemployment benefits and the employer pays less taxes ... 
  so , maybe the * real * unemployment rate is even lower than statistics have always shown . 
  spain had 20 % of unemployment in the 80s before being a eu member . 
  it 's a structural problem of our economy . 
  more reading , less demagoguery . 
  well , construction not now ...
