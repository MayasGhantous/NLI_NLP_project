  are all the spaniards the same ? 
  he was mistaken . 
  that 's it . 
  why do you generalise disrespectfully ? 
  by the way , since 2014-2015 spain gives more money to eu than we receive . 
  catalonia similar to bordeaux and not to val\u00e8ncia ... you can not take seriously most maps on the internet . 
  i do n't doubt germany exports products with a better quality than other countries ; indeed , germany has one of the lowest price elasticity in the world . 
  but i do n't think that 's the only factor . 
  the currency is not a tariff , of course , but it has a similar effect : it allows you to * protect * your national industry ; so , if you have the same currency you have to compete directly with germans products without barriers and you 're very good at exports and also most countries in europe are not as much competitive as you are ... that 's why , you have a free path to export products as much you want in the [ eurozone ] ( https://www.creditwritedowns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/germanys-trade-surplus-500x348.png ) ( broadly speaking , it 's far more complex ; maybe , an economist may explain it better ) . 
  very beautiful and impressive town . 
  in my opinion , the gdp growth does not imply an increase of nation 's richness and even less quality of life ; it just says that consumption , government spending , private investment and net exports ( exports - imports ) have grown in a given currency for a year . 
  catalonia does not want anything . 
  catalonia are the catalans and some of them want independence . 
  according to the last polls , only 45 % catalans ( minority ) support independence and the tendency is decreasing ; that 's not the whole catalonia . 
  self-determination right , which is marxist construct , is for colonies according to the un ( except kosovo , where there was a genocide ; and uk has a different legal system and they do n't have constitution ) . 
  the tendency is to split up in smaller states in the past 200 years . 
  but is history lineal ? 
  let me doubt it . 
  nobody knows the future . 
  ** germany ** * `` rich states '' * gdp per capita of the german richest region ( hamburg ) : 61,729 $ gdp per capita of the second richest region in germany ( bremen ) : 47,603 $ gdp per capita of the third richest region in germany ( bavaria ) : 43,092 $ * `` poor states '' * gdp per capita of the german poorest region ( mecklenburg-vorpommern ) : 24,909 $ gdp per capita of the second poorest region in germany ( saxony-anhalt ) : 25,198 $ gdp per capita of the third poorest region in germany ( thuringia ) : 26,364 $ source : [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_german_states_by_gdp ) i 'd say it 's almost the same situation as the spain 's situation . 
  maybe i 'm wrong , but i see the same phenomenon anew . 
  * ceteris paribus * in economics is an ideal scenario and it 's very naive because it 's to believe that time is lineal due to the factors do n't change . 
  in most cases it does n't happen . 
  in 2005 , some economists predicted here that spain will overtake france 's gdp per capita around 2015-2020 because spain 's gdp was growing at 3-4 % . 
  it has n't happened . 
  prudence . 
  that 's right . 
  also , if you want to compare gdp per capita is much more reliable real gdp , which is not affected by inflation . 
  anyway , gdp per capita =| = wealth . 
  it 's a common phenomenon in most countries which have a considerable size . 
  poor kingdom of asturias !, 
  yes , it 's very unlikely that the british or nordic health care system are better than the italian and the spanish one according to many sources , like [ this ranking ] ( http://thepatientfactor.com/canadian-health-care-information/world-health-organizations-ranking-of-the-worlds-health-systems/ ) nor [ it seems to be they 're more efficient ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-29/u-s-health-care-system-ranks-as-one-of-the-least-efficient ) . 
  it just says greece has the lowest productivity rate per hour worked in europe . 
  that 's right . 
  catalan can have until 28 diphthongs ( it 's very rich in this aspect ) . 
  also , spanish is wrong : spanish has 24 phonemes at maximum and 14 diphthongs . 
  i would suggest to be skeptical about polls in catalonia . 
  it seems to be lately polls do n't show totally what the public opinion thinks , but what 's politically correct ( brexit , colombia , trump ... ) ... and non-nationalist catalans know well what 's politically correct in catalonia ... 
  i 'm favour of a legal and constitutional referendum , but i prefer referendums in social issues and issues that are really important for most catalans ; having said that , i remember before 2014 unilateral referendum there were polls that say 80 % catalans are [ highly keen on voting in a independence referendum ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29982960 ) . 
  some days later , the unilateral referendum was held and the turnout was around 35 % catalans with a * bit false * census ( 16 years old teenagers and immigrants included ) and it seems to be you could vote twice ... 
  so , the turnout was even less ... and our politicians made a huge ridiculous . 
  where were the 45 % catalans who were highly keen on voting in a independence referendum and they did n't vote ? 
  that 's why i suggest to be skeptical : believe in polls in catalonia , but also do no believe them . 
  out of catalonia , basque country , northern navarre and galicia ( minority there ) , nationalist movements are a joke . 
  impressions/opinions/feelings =| = facts . 
  [ most balearic people feel as much balearic as spanish and only 4 % people support that balearic islands can become independent . ], 
  so , why have ( upn/pp and psn always been the most voted party in navarra ? ), 
  [ https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/elecciones_al_parlamento_de_navarra] the maximum pro-basque votes is 30 % and in crisis time . 
  in an economic stability situation , they 're around 15-20 % . 
  [ it 's minority even in crisis time ] ( https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/elecciones_al_parlamento_de_las_islas_baleares_de_2015 ) and they need ecologists ' votes . 
  since 2015 , spain gives more money to e. u. than we receive . 
  and poland is doing very well economically . 
  comparing the countries which receive money from the u. e. budget with cuba in the cold war is a nonsense , in my opinion ... 
  anyway , in the case i 'm wrong ; if spain is growing 3 % because we 're a net recipient from european budget , why are n't portugal and greece growing 4 % at least ? 
  because they 've received much more money from the e. u. than spain ... spain 's gdp growth ( over 3 % ) for the last two years is manly due to an increase in exports and domestic demand . 
  i totally disagree . 
  nobody compares spain with italy here , we 're very busy hating ourselves for doing that . 
   also , spain 's recent growth is linked to its lack of deficit containment policies . 
  it may be a factor but minor ; the two main factors of spain 's recent growth is increase in exports and above all an unexpected increase in domestic demand ( also , for many factors ) . 
  people downvote you here for stupid reasons . 
  i totally agree with you . 
  europe needs taller buildings , they 're far more ecological than houses or short buildings . 
  if i 'm not wrong , the last ceo 's polls have n't asked for what reasons people support or do n't support independence ( i read them ) ; so do n't make up , please , because there are n't current data about that . 
  first of all , he should try to convince [ the half of us who are against independence ] ( http://electomania.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/indepeono-768x462.png ) according to the last poll because it seems to be they are not even more people who are against it . 
  and the tendency is decreasing because i remember polls in which pro-independence support reached 56-60 % . 
  as catalan , i love talking about catalonia , but i 'm very tired of this . 
  we 've been talking only about this for years , instead of talking about economic or social policy . 
  it would be an economic disaster for catalonia and for the rest of spain , for both . 
  i did n't know that 100 % catalans want independence . 
  things i learn here . 
  these maps are not according to the czechs , germans or norwegians , but according to the person who made them . 
  the borders between language and dialect are very fuzzy . 
  sorry , it 's in spanish : `` la poblaci\u00f3n hispana de los estados unidos ronda actualmente los 53 millones de personas . 
  i just gave information according to instituto cervantes , which is the most reliable source about statics of spanish . 
  all what you said is known by me , i 'm linguist specialist in spanish . 
  i tend to doubt it . 
  it seems to be that eastern europe has been poorer on average than western europe even without communism , except the former checolosvakia : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_regions_by_past_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita it 's not a perfect estimation . 
  there 're blonds in southern europe ( and france ) , but [ it seems to be it 's not as much typical as other parts of europe . ], 
  ( http://www.mappery.com/maps/europe-blond-hair-map.mediumthumb.jpg ), 
  - spanish is also spoken in north america ( mexico exists !, 
  and in the usa there 're 50m of spanish-speakers ) and central america ; europe ( spain and andorra ) ; africa ( canary islands , ceuta and melilla ; equatorial guinea and western sahara - it 's not a country and it 's just a desert though ) ; asia because there are still 3m speakers in the philippines and also in israel because sephardic people still speak judeo-spanish which is basically old spanish ; and in oceania in the little easter island ( chile ) . 
  so , spanish is spoken in the five continents . 
  - french is spoken in the five continents . 
  - portuguese is also spoken in europe ( obviously ) , africa , asia ( goa , macau and east timor ) . 
  - english is spoken worldwide . 
  should we cry out of emotion ? 
  ancient maps always have many mistakes . 
  no and yes ... first of all , the were crowns , not kingdoms . 
  they shared army , foreign policy , inquisition ( very important in that age , it does n't seem for us though ) and above all they shared the monarchy and a conception of being from spain ... also , it seems to be foreigners saw us as one people ( you can see it in this map ) ... 
  there was a political unity , but not a jurisdictional unity because the territories of the crown of aragon conserved their medieval laws . 
  that 's why , current historians like to call it _ hispanic monarchy _ untill the war of succession because spain was a political unity but not juridical : grey area . 
  that 's quite true for barcelona m.a. 
  ( 4,5-5m people ) and catalonia as a whole , but less ... 
  nevertheless , is there such inmigrantion rates in les garrigues or another inland * vegueria * for example ? 
  cool story , you 'd be a nice sci-fi film director ; but castile and leon is part of the historical [ regions of castile ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/castile_ ( historical_region ) ) , which more center of spain than northern spain ; most southern spanish people are descendant of castilians and leonese people and , as you can see in * `` genetic '' maps * , spain is quite homogeneous genetically ... 
  but pisa are knowledge and skill tests , what 's the relationship between genetics and skills and reading in spanish ? 
  is there a gene for * more developed skills in reading spanish or basque * for example ? 
  i 'm wondering . 
  by the way , when did the vikings invade soria ? 
  is castile and leon one of the richest regions in spain ?
