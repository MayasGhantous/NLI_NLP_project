  [ i do not think so ... ] ( http://imagenes.lainformacion.com/2016/03/30/economia/pib-per-capita-regiones_903222088_101609713_667x486.jpg ) they 're below the avarage . 
  europe is not only a geographical concept , but also a cultural concept . 
  indeed , europe does not exist geographically as we think , because what we know as europe is just a cape of the eurasian continent according to physical geography . 
  the geographical borders between * europe * and * asia * are geologically arbitrary ... 
  i mean european culture in eurasia makes europe . 
  not only barcelona ( which is like a * mini-catalonia * sociologically ) , but almost all its metropolitan area that 's quite different from the rural catalonia . 
  take a look at the results of nationalist parties in baix llobregat . 
  it sounds very * less socially conservative * ... and [ this ] ( http://www.cartasaldirector.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/10375150_744802032232040_6297099248762074744_n.jpg ) . 
  also , pujol said many times that ciu was ideologically heir to lliga regionalista , which leader , camb\u00f3 , financed the [ fascist coup d'\u00e9tat against a democr\u00e0tic republic ] ( https://www.google.es/amp/m.publico.es/politica/financiadores-del-golpe-da-inicio.html/amp ) . 
  although they were different parties , converg\u00e8ncia and uni\u00f3 were allies , so they may think similar in many aspects ; that 's why , they were allies ... [ duran i lleida , who was the spokesman of ciu in the spanish national parliament , supported medicians who '' * heal * '' gays ] ( https://www.google.es/amp/sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2010/06/23/actualidad/1277244002_850215.amp.html ) . 
  are you minimizing the acts of a terrorist group because they thought similar to you ? 
  it 's clear it was n't like eta ( fortunately ) , but i think it was n't a [ `` joke '' ] ( http://www.acvot.org/v2/enews2.php?var=444 ) for this woman . 
  there were also spanish nationalist groups like triple a ( related to fuerza nueva ) : [ matanza de atocha ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_massacre_of_atocha ) . 
  in the first years of the current democracy there were a lot of terrorist groups in spain , not only eta and later gal . 
  castile does not exist nowadays as a political entity . 
  also , * nacionalidad * in the spanish constitution does n't mean * nation * , but a territory with history and culture . 
  andalusia is also a * nacionalidad * . 
  the supreme court of canada declared quebec 's referendums illegal in 1998 because they have a constitution like us and unlike uk . 
  the clarity act , which is constitutional , allows to make a nonbinding and consultative referendum in quebec . 
  in the case there 's a referendum in quebec and the * yes * to independence wins , only the districts ( i do n't know exactly how they 're called in canada ) which vote for the independence would be allowed to be independent from canada , only if the canadian parliament approves it ( that 's why it 's consultative ) , because the canada 's constitution only recognises the national sovereignty in the canadian parliament and does not recognise the right of self-determination as almost all the constitutions in the world , except the ethiopian constitution . 
  if some eastern europeans countries believe russia is still the russian empire or the ussr , it 's not our problem . 
  we are n't in the cold war anymore , although it seems to be because mass medias treat russia as it were the ussr ( i 'm gay ; i do not like putin , but i do not think russia is the evil ) . 
  there 're countries in western europe ( like mine ) which are loosing much money . 
  the italian state looks after italy 's own interests as it 's normal . 
  where 's the news ? 
  are we in the cold war ??? 
  i thought we 're in 2016 ... 
  yes , it does not make sense . 
  but the first ones to use ( false ) historic arguments are nationalists since the xix century . 
  the unity of spain is not sacred , neither the unity of catalonia ... 
  principality , not even a kingdom like val\u00e8ncia in the crown of aragon . 
  moreover uk lacks of constitution , unlike spain . 
  the spanish constitution , as almost all constitutions in the world ( except the ethiopia 's one , if i 'm not wrong ) , does not recognise the right of self-determination and protects the unity of spain . 
  i do n't consider the unity of spain to be * sacred * , but if you want to make a referendum , you have to change the constitution , which most catalans voted for 38 years ago , and not committing illegalities . 
  i want to remind that quebec 's referendums were declared [ illegal ] ( https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/1999/12/que-d04.html?view=article_mobile ) : `` last year , canada 's supreme court ruled that a unilateral declaration of independence by quebec would be illegal under the canadian constitution and international law . '', 
  i 'm gay , i lived in a village and i agree with you . 
  where does that come from ? 
  andalusia is more open to gays than all centre of spain ( except madrid ) and navarra for example . 
  castile is our bible belt . 
  it 's not ridiculous , but original . 
  as non-nationalist catalan , i must say your comment is very good . 
  catalan nationalists keep thinking that spain is like franco 's spain , but the reality is totally different . 
  indeed , catalan educational system ( almost all is taught in catalan ) is recognised internationally as an example for increasing the number of speakers , the knowledge and respect to minority languages . 
  and this is possible thanks to linguist laws of catalan parliament and the spanish constitution , which is not perfect and must be reformed , but it 's very respectful with minorities . 
  you can not compare astur-leones and the aragon 's language to other spanish national languages . 
  these languages/historic dialects can be considered languages but also dialects of spanish ( i do not say personally if they 're dialects or languages ; i 'm telling the controversy in academia ) . 
  it 's a complex issue and very discussed in academia because the borders between a dialect and a language are very , very fuzzy . 
  some linguists consider them as languages like ethnologue 's linguists ; other linguists like men\u00e9ndez pidal , who studied asturian very much , thought they were dialects ... 
  both positions are right . 
  they 're currently in a grey area . 
  so , as student of linguistics , i think your comparison is not accurate because nobody doubts catalan , galician , basque and occitan ( * aranese * ) are languages . 
  catalonia has n't been recognised the right of self-determination by the un because it 's not a colony . 
  it 's for colonies . 
  the scottish case is very special for many historic and legal reasons . 
  and the quebec 's referendums were declared illegal ... 
  the western sahara is better compared to catalonia in spain , what an ignorance !, 
  i think it 's a complex issue . 
  spain increased its gdp a lot during 2001-2008 ( 3-4 % per year ) , we 've been increasing our gdp a bit more than 3 % for the last two years and we expect to increase 2,8 % our gdp the next year ... 
  if the euro damages southern economies so much , why has spain 's gdp increased considerably with the euro except during 2008-2013 ? 
  i do n't think * the euro is heaven * , it 's true that it has damaged some aspects of southern economies ; but i do n't think it 's that much bad ( at least for spain ) . 
  [ spain is still the top . ], 
  ( http://www.irodat.org/img/database/pdf newsletter2016_secondedition . pdf ), 
  i do n't agree with you , but it 's a good comment . 
  in spanish , we do n't pronounce the / r / sound in * tr * and * dr * , but / \u027e / ( a softer sound ) . 
  only / r / ( * trill r * ) sounds in * rr * ; * sr - * like * israel * , * nr - * and * lr - * like * alrededor * ; also , when it 's the first letter like * raudo * . 
  the cold war ended . 
  get over it . 
  i think he means [ laws like this ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ley_de_relaciones_comerciales_con_las_antillas ) . 
  ( sorry , it 's in spanish ) . 
  basically , there were protectionist laws , which destroyed ( among other factors ) other industries focus in the rest of spain like my grandmother 's city , [ m\u00e1laga ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_m%c3%a1laga#economic_expansion_and_industrialisation_.281833.e2.80.931868.29 ) : `` the second half of the 19th century began a period of prosperity in m\u00e1laga , with an economy energised by the resumption of traditional mercantile activities and new industrial employment . 
  this positioned the city as an important european manufacturing center ; urban renewal projects and the modernisation of local infrastructure were initiated by local government . 
  manuel agustin heredia 's ironworks , la constancia , located in san andr\u00e9s , started a run of productivity in 1834 that made it the country 's leading iron foundry . '' there were more industrial focus in spain like vigo , alcoi , val\u00e8ncia , c\u00e1diz ... they could n't compete with the catalan industry thanks to the evil-spanish-state-which-hates-catalans because as the famous swiss writer stendhal , who knew spain well , wrote : `` catalans want just laws -- he notes down -- with the exception of the customs law , which must be done to its measurement . 
  they want that every spaniard who needs cotton pays four francs the pole , for the fact that catalonia is in the world . 
  the spaniards of granada , of malaga or of corunna can not buy english cotton cloths , which are excellent , and which cost a franc the pole ( memoirs of a tourist , 1939 ) '' . 
  i think it 's clear what stendhal saw when he visited spain . 
  this does not mean that there was n't an illustrated and entrepreneur elite ( as in other parts of spain ) which was an important part in the industrial development of catalan industry , but history is more complex and more prosaic ( and less epic ) than nationalists of all kinds say ... there are many factors involved and maybe without the help of the state the industrial focus in spain would have developed in galicia , andalusia or val\u00e8ncia . 
  who knows ? 
  once again here for foreigners : why are n't catalan nationalist movements or they 're very minority in catalan speaking regions like val\u00e8ncia or balearic islands ? 
  are n't they * catalans * ? 
  because they 're ( relatively ) poor regions . 
  it 's all about money . 
  we 're the poorest area in the iberian peninsula , unlike portugal ... 
  there was also a rebellion in [ andalusia ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/andalusian_independentist_conspiracy_ ( 1641 ) . 
  it was n't about nationalism ( this idiology did not exist before the xix century as you said ) , but nobiliary and high clergy interests ( power interests ) , moreover money ( as always ) . 
  learning german is a waste of time if you 're not an engineer . 
  learning or improving your english is a better investment . 
  if you 're not eurocentric , learning chinese , arabian , any asiatic languages or even spanish , french and russian ( as european languages ) are more useful ... or your own languages like we do in spain with our languages ( learning one of the spain 's not-castilian languages should be mandatory in all spain ) for working in your country . 
  i consider german to be a beautiful and interesting language , but life is short and germans speak a good english on average . 
   support for far right is up across the eu . 
  spain : 0 far-right member of spanish parliament and all the seventeen regional parliaments . 
  so that sentence is false . 
  moreover , i think portugal does n't have far-right representantives . 
  spanish governments are very stable , unlike italian governments . 
  only in 2015 and 2016 we had a caretaker government and we had two consecutive elections ( unprecedented in the current spanish democracy ) . 
  so , far from italy according to historic facts . 
  i do n't know about portuguese governments . 
  [ it 's more democratic than your little country ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/democracy_index ) according to this report . 
  catalan nationalists =| = all catalans . 
  it 's not that difficult . 
  we all know here that nationalists are very noisy .
