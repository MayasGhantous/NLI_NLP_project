  it 's not a news . 
  circumcision is not a spanish or a catholic tradition . 
  if we consider that polls in spain are made for newspapers ' readers ( that 's why , polls almost always coincide with the newspaper 's editorial line ) and ara , which still exists because of the catalan government subsidies , says pro-independence is at 42.3 % , it 's very likely pro-independence support is under 40 % . 
  also , i would like to remember that before of the pseudo-referendum in 2014 , polls of the catalan government said that [ 60 % catalans support independence and 74 % catalans support the illegal referendum ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20140318/54403186568/60-catalanes-votarian-favor-independencia-ceo.html ) . 
  after some months , the pseudo-referendum was held and there was a false turnout of 36 % catalans . 
  i said * false * because 16 years old teenagers could vote , immigrants could vote and people could vote twice because there was n't any control . 
  i remember a member of erc in twitter who boasted there he voted twice ... in catalonia and in all spain , polls = / = reality ( in most cases ) . 
  i think we can name this pic as * la comarca ens visita * ( rural catalans visit [ barcelona ] ( https://ep01.epimg.net/cat/imagenes/2015/12/21/catalunya/1450726598_868264_1450729767_noticia_normal.png ) ) . 
  i 'm sorry for being impolite and speaking in spanish . 
  exclusive homosexuality is only in humans . 
  where are the data from ? 
  what method did they use ? 
  it 's a very good news considering that we were at 26 % unemployment in 2013 and , since the oil crisis in the 70s , spain has a big structural unemployment rate ( 7-8 % unemployment is very low unemployment in spain ) . 
  when my father was young , the province of barcelona had almost 0 % unemployment . 
  that 's a utopia nowadays in spain . 
  in the early 90s , the spanish unemployment rate was over 20 % after barcelona 's olympic games . 
  our unemployment rate is not totally due to this crisis ( imo ) , it 's a long-standing problem due to our production system . 
  also , our informal economy is huge , above all in the southern and some mediterranean provinces . 
  nevertheless , the quality of most of the new jobs is bad or very bad . 
  most of them are created in the tourist sector : many hours , mostly bad paid and precarious . 
  at least , it 's something positive , but the government should worry about the quality of the new jobs because spain needs jobs of quality to maintain our pension system . 
  i do n't like to label animals with human categories . 
  but , it 's very beautiful and it stops some arguments of the homophobes . 
  i like it . 
  i think we should speak english for people can understand us and , above all , for politeness . 
  i have never attacked catalonia because catalonia is the 7,4 million catalans and among them , it 's me . 
  i would have attacked me and that 's nonsensical . 
  besides , i love catalonia ... 
  i think you 're confusing catalonia with catalan nationalism/nationalists ... 
  very nice ... 
  things never change here . 
  and you 're also confusing to be anti-nationalist with being fascist ( according to marxists , fascism is the last phase of nationalism ) ... 
  i do n't have words ... my grandfather was 3 times in prison for being an underground member of psuc ( the communist party in catalonia under franco 's dictatorship ) ... what about the grandparents of some pdcat 's members ... ? 
  what the ... 
  sorry , do n't we have free elections in catalonia or do i live under an illusion ? 
  did n't we have a pseudo-referendum about independence and a * plebiscitarian election * supposedly about the independence ? 
  what did the central state ? 
  nothing . 
  thanks for saying i do n't know what i 'm talking about for thinking differently from you . 
  i keep thinking that * let catalans vote * is demagoguery . 
  yes , i defended el pa\u00eds , although i usually criticize it because they manipulate against podemos . 
  because * ad hominem * arguments against el pa\u00eds do n't convince me neither any adult and i know how many of you are because i know the history of catalonia and it 's full of madness made by nationalists , like camb\u00f3 ... 
  so , i would n't be surprised if it 's true . 
  if it 's false , i was mistaken because i 'm human and we all commit mistakes and i will recognize it . 
  of course , there are pro-independence in barcelona ( i have very good friends that are pro-independence here ... xd and they are not radical as many pro-independence people on the internet ) , but most pro-independence supporters live in the internal catalan counties ; that 's why , i said it sarcastically . 
  as you know , most people in baix llobregat are not pro-independence . 
  ( i no s\u00f3c el teu enemic  ), 
  it 's more likely that the catalan police do that , actually ... 
  i 'm not going to vote in an illegal referendum . 
   who is * us * ? 
  i 'm asking it as catalan . 
  i do n't know what 's going to happen . 
  in my opinion , the most likely scenario was a new election , but now i do n't know . 
  the spanish state and all its sub-divisions ( autonomical , local , etc. ), 
  use the force every day , like all the states in the world . 
  the law is always fulfilled by the use of the force . 
  no , i never do that for thinking differently from me . 
  what the ... catalonia is a democracy !, 
  every day , in every state in the world , the state uses the force to prevent something . 
  states are defined by the legal use of the force , not by throwing flowers . 
  e.g. , the catalan government , which is a state subdivision of the spanish state , used the force of the catalan police against [ 15-m movement in barcelona ] ( http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2017/05/31/catalunya/1496220644_483613.html ) while they were protesting against cuts in education , healthcare and other social services budgets that the party of the current catalan president has carried out . 
  of course , i do n't know what i 'm talking about . 
  do you think i 'm from kiribati islands ? 
  that 's why , pujol won three catalan elections with absolute majority in 1984 , 1988 and 1992 , whereas ap/pp , a residual party in catalonia , was far more voted than esquerra . 
  in which party was catalan nationalists ' votes concentrated ? 
  data are on the internet . 
  discuss the arguments ; not the argumentative . 
  you 're very young , you live in a fantastic catalonia or you 're manipulating , without any acrimony and with all the respects that you deserve as a person . 
  it 's incredible you 're telling me he had n't been one of the biggest representatives of catalan nationalism for decades until 2014 . 
  even many catalan left-wing nationalists had much respect for him until his corruption scandals . 
  * pujolets * , in honour of the father of the catalan fatherland . 
  handsome guys . 
  he has spanish citizenship , he 's spanish . 
  so , the headline of the guardian is right . 
  personal ideologies and feelings are subjective and change over time , his current nationality is something objective : the problem of reality is it exists , although you may not like it . 
  the headline of the guardian reflects reality . 
  josep tarradellas , ex president of the catalan government , said once : in politics you can do everything , except making ridiculous ( * en pol\u00edtica es pot fer tot , menys el rid\u00edcul * ) . 
  that 's why , i want to allow us to vote in an illegal referendum : only nationalists would vote again . 
  but that 's to be a very bad person . 
  oh look , another noisy nationalist . 
  madrid is also not spain according to your theory . 
  nationalists are going to downvote this . 
  i 'm sorry for you . 
  i 've just upvoted it . 
  your best argument is an * ad hominem * against * el pa\u00eds * or `` i do n't like this ; therefore , it 's false '' . 
  these are logical fallacies . 
  i criticize * el pa\u00eds * a lot too ( for other issues ) , but , come on , those are not serious arguments ... you are not a majority ( + 50 % ) and in barcelona and , above all , its metropolitan area , even less . 
  there 's life beyond ripoll or your circle of friends . 
  get over it . 
  why if we 're bilingual ? 
  most people in barcelona have spanish as native language . 
  in barcelona 's metropolitan area , there are towns and cities where native spanish speakers are more than 70 % or 80 % , like cornell\u00e0 or l'hospitalet de llobregat ( the second catalan city by population ) . 
  please , do n't say `` this is false because el pa\u00eds says it '' because that 's a logical fallacy at all . 
  we should be prudent with news , but i want to remind you that the history of catalan nationalism is full of madness , like the funding of the coup d'\u00c9tat of franco against the ii spanish republic ( parliamentarian democracy ) by [ camb\u00f3 ] ( http://www.publico.es/politica/financiadores-del-golpe-da-inicio.html ) ( leader of lliga regionalista , catalanist and catalan nationalist right-wing party ) . 
  in ** the name of democracy ** , our government is going to declare the independence over again ( i have lost count ... ) with the last polls made by themselves saying that catalan pro-independence support is now a minority . 
  * parole , parole , parole * ... as a famous italian song said ... 
  politics is action . 
  if you want to create a new state , you have to do an act of sovereignty ; it 's said , an act of violence ( i do n't like this . 
  i 'm only talking about political history and science ) because a state is defined -- among other definitions -- , since max webber , as the political entity that has the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force . 
  states are not created by regional laws .
