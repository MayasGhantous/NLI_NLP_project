  therefore , although our president gets out at the terrasse of catalan government palace and says again we are going to be independent , this has 0 consequences because you need to expel the spanish state forces ( police , guardia civil and army ) which defend the majoritarian opinion of most catalan according to the last polls : we want to be part of spain because we are spanish . 
  the catalan police is not stupid and they are not going to play with their salaries , whose families need , and their officer position because it depends of the spanish ministry of interior . 
  so , it 's extremely unlikely that catalan government can do an act of sovereignty . 
  nevertheless , if i 'm wrong and the catalan police uses violence against the forces of a democratic eu state , without the support of + 50 % catalans ... 
  i totally do n't know what could happen ( i am not a fortune-teller ) , the only thing i know in this scenario is that the use of violence will defeat catalan nationalism morally , in spain and internationally , and this will lead to its political defeat . 
  gay rights did n't exist under franco 's directorship . 
  gays were sentenced to prison for years or to be * cured * in a mental hospital . 
  it was n't socialist . 
  it was only a parliamentarian republic . 
  communists were very minority in the parliament . 
  the most strongest leftist political forces during the ii spanish republic were social-democracy ( psoe and ir ) and anarchism . 
  do n't we vote for state , autonomical , local and europe elections every x years ? 
  did n't around 35 % catalan ( more immigrants ) vote in a pseudo-referendum of independence in 2014 ? 
  due to the lack of legality in that referendum , did n't we vote in a * plebicistarian elections * about the independence of catalonia in 2015 and in 18 months we 'll be independent ? 
  we vote every four years . 
  what a demagogue tittle . 
  is it anything to be proud of ? 
  i mean alcohol is one of the most dangerous drugs , although it 's socially acceptable . 
  no , i said what you can read in my comment . 
  that 's your interpretation . 
  i 'm responsible of my words , i 'm not responsible of you could understand and i was talking about the concept of nation and ethnicity . 
  moreover , as you can read in other comments of mine , i was talking about some users in reddit , not about all the people who live in eastern europe . 
  i hate generalizing . 
  i 'm using the term * ethnicity * in all the meanings . 
  a word does n't have an inner , determined and true meaning ; the meaning of a word is steadily constructing by the speakers of a language . 
  if people in the us use * ethnicity * as a synonym of * race * , the term * ethnicity * acquires also that meaning , moreover the anthropological meaning . 
  i guess if they have french flags celebrating macron 's victory , they 'd likely feel french . 
  i do n't agree with your essentialism . 
  if they are citizens of the french republic , they are totally french in my opinion . 
  no , i said it in another comment . 
  i was talking implicitly about a user from an eastern country . 
  i did n't generalize . 
  i hate generalizing . 
  not all the people think the same neither in eastern countries nor in another territory in the world . 
  it saddens me that my comment could be interpreted that way . 
  i gave usa as an example because there you can speak spanish , chinese , tagalog , etc. 
  ; you can believe in any religion or not ; you can be of any race and you 're part of the american nation , if you 're an american citizen . 
  no , you misunderstood me . 
  i was talking implicitly about a user which i had a conversation about * ethnicity * and * nationality * . 
  i was n't talking about all eastern europeans , of course . 
  there 's all kind of people like in the rest of the world . 
  no , it is n't their beliefs , in my opinion . 
  but it 's their extremist interpretation of the koran . 
  if he 's a trump troll and he thinks this image can damage multiculturalism in france , he does n't understand the french republican values . 
  according to some redditors from some eastern countries those guys can not be french because they are n't * ethnically french * . 
  that 's the problem with nationalists , they confuse nation with * ethnicity * and very , very few of them do it with * race * nowadays ( very few , fortunately ) . 
  a nation , which is the civil society in a broad sense , can be composed by many ethnicities and it 's a nation , like the usa . 
  at least , in france as in western european , nation is based on citizenship ... 
  there are other definitions of nation , but they have n't brought anything good to europe , in my opinion ... that pic is a good example of the french nation . 
  all the three guys are 100 % french . 
  they 're thought that this image suggests to me . 
  yesterday , not only le pen lost , but also nationalism did it . 
  macron is a patriot ; le pen is a nationalist . 
  patriotism and nationalism are different phenomena that are often confused . 
  construction was the 5,2 % of the spanish gdp in 2015 . 
  it 's at a historical low . 
  the phone which i 'm writing this message is partially made in spain ( and china ) . 
  it 's bq , a spanish phone brand . 
  espanyol supporters do n't like this comment . 
  not surprising . 
  this is not a news . 
  anyway , in catalonia there are more football clubs ( and people who do n't like football like me ) , although the most supported is barcelona . 
  one fact : the second most supported football here is ... real madrid . 
  the cultural factor has been underestimated in this thread , as if it were something wrong . 
  that 's different from northern europe does n't mean wrong or right . 
  also , you can not reduce a phenomenon to only one factor ; of course economic factors are likely the main factors , but also cultural factors should be considered . 
  except ethiopia , no one country in the world that has a written constitution allows secession referendums , not even the canadian constitution . 
  these are some examples that i found on the internet : - [ constitution of norway ] ( https://www.stortinget.no/en/grunnlovsjubileet/in-english/the-constitution---complete-text/ ) : article 1 `` the kingdom of norway is a free , independent , ** indivisible ** and inalienable realm . 
  its form of government is a limited and hereditary monarchy . '', 
  - [ constitution of estonia ] ( https://www.president.ee/en/republic-of-estonia/the-constitution/ ) : \u00a7 2 . 
  '' ** the land , territorial waters and airspace of estonia constitute an inseparable and indivisible whole . 
  ** in terms of the organisation of its government , estonia is a ** unitary state ** whose administrative division is provided by law . '', 
  - [ french constitution ] ( http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/english/constitution/constitution-of-4-october-1958.25742.html#titlei ) : article 1 `` france shall be an ** indivisible ** , secular , democratic and social republic [ ... ] '' .

  the federal constitutional court shall rule on the question of unconstitutionality . 
  - [ finnish constitution ] ( http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/fi00000_.html ) : section 4 the territory of finland `` the territory of finland is ** indivisible . 
  the national borders can not be altered without the consent of the parliament .

  andalusia is far more important to morroco ( and for the muslim world ) than catalonia for many reasons and it seems to be it was n't a business trip , but a political one . 
  you have said it : spain is the number one trading partner of morocco , not catalonia . 
  i was talking about political power . 
  nowadays , spain is almost nothing in international politics . 
  if those favours do n't cost us money ( unlike puigdemont 's trip for nothing ) , if they 're diplomatic favours and they 're useful to stop nationalism , i do n't see the problem . 
  politics is politics . 
  dirty games are always present on every side . 
  nevertheless , i would n't consider margallo a trustworthy source ... 
  in my opinion , he has always said and done a lot of nonsense . 
  so , do you think spain is a powerful country that can change the government 's agenda regarding business of another country ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  i think that 's very unlikely . 
  that 's what i say . 
  thanks for your explanation about the belgian case . 
  i did n't know it . 
  it 's interesting how it works . 
  what 's more likely to happen : did rajoy call the moroccan government to cancel the trip and the moroccan government accepted it because spain is a very powerful country and therefore economy does n't matter to them or does the moroccan government have more important things to do than listening to regional presidents and they have changed its plans ? 
  the ( catalan news agency ) [ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ag%c3%a8ncia_catalana_de_not%c3%adcies] belongs to the catalan government . 
  i think all is said . 
  that 's right , nobody knows the future . 
  that 's why i said i was skeptical .
