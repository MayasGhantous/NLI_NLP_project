  i could stay 30 seconds or so , but it was just endless suffering . 
  but the worst was the snow bath . 
  because water , if liquid is at least around zero , but snow was easily -20 \u00ba or so . 
  it felt like knifes trying to frostbite your heart . 
  i think you are right . 
  when i was in finland , we actually take the supper before going to the sauna . 
  i was worried because my mother always told me to wait 30 minutes before going into the water and we were planning to enter in a hole in the ice after being in the extremely hot sauna . 
  but it was ok . 
  i now think that the finnish are not humans , but some kind of yeti without hair . 
  it is clearly false , since they are not inside a sauna . 
  well , it is a set in itself . 
  a set of citizens , a set of land or a set of countries which only element is iceland . 
  in all the previous ways , for example , iceland is not a subset of the eu , but spain/germany/france / etc are . 
  yes . 
  there are people who see the glass half empty . 
  there are people who see the glass half full . 
  and then , there is you . 
  you see the glass completely empty and stained with blood . 
  but you can skip the brackets , and it would be true , then . 
  iceland , norway , switzerland \u2284 european union, 
  having it better than italy is a success in my book . 
  at least our politicians hide their mafia roots . 
  next step , those damn * gabachos * . 
  schles-what ? 
  do you mean north-north-north bavaria ? 
  i do n't have any idea why galicia is in red ? 
  people is so much into politics that even the deaths vote !, 
  it is a short and safe path to france , is n't it ? 
  and they have very good fries and waffles . 
  my experience is exactly the opposite . 
  maybe is caused by the flags . 
  people tend to give you less credit when you are * poor * because , * what else would you say ? * . 
  the kind of answer i receive are not very different with the ones i would receive by republican americans in worldnews , for example . 
  i have noticed different kind of response to people saying the same that i was saying , but with a german flag , for example . 
  maybe it is just that i express myself worse . 
  varoufakis said that either the eu accept the greek conditions or there wo n't be a half-life 3 . 
  you better believe that man has the contact to fulfill such a threat . 
  the problem is , it does n't matter how peacefully protest 99.9 % of the people , the 0.1 % are going to be very * loud * and are going to make into the news . 
  and there is not much the other 99.9 % can do . 
  even if they shun them , people wo n't see it in the news . 
  i am aware that it is incorrect and yet i use it every frigging single time . 
  thank you for the correction . 
  by the way , sadly , there have been some dead people caused by the rubber bullets , such as i\u00f1igo cabacas . 
  he was hit in the head directly and that killed him . 
  he was killed after a football match ( not a protest ) , but it is just to show how powerful are those weapons and why they were outlawed by the eu . 
  i am not arguing the reasons for it to happen ( more than a lack of solidarity , the problem in spain is more the rampant corruption and the societal complicity in many cases ) but anyway , that is not the aim of my comment . 
  i am just saying that what you have said is quite insulting for many people . 
  in europe there is a problem with homeless people and the ecb is the same for those people than for the finnish , the germans or the french . 
  this is your original comment , with bold annotations with the summary of my previous comment :  where the hell do you live ? 
  ( ** spain ** ) acute homelessness ? 
  ( ** yes , quite a lot ** ) where ? 
  ( ** almost in every city and town ** ) you do understand that not everybody can live in the center of paris , berlin or helsinki ?!, 
  ( ** people want a place to live , they do n't need a mansion or the center of the capital ** ) you can say that the protesters are wrong , and it is not ecb 's fault , which is ok , but you are dishonest saying that there is no reason for them to be angry to start with since there is not such a problem of homeless people ; and going and step further , stating that the real problem is that they want to live in the center of the european capitals . 
  that is a malicious oversimplification about the situation for many people . 
  like when on the other side of the pond , they say that the * poor people is poor because they want or because they are lazy * . 
  i guess it infuriates me so much because it hits home . 
  and countries like spain ? 
  i am glad that you live in a country with such strong social security and government help for those who are hit by the crisis , but finland is far from the `` average '' european country . 
  because of the destructive cycle of the crisis , thousands of families are left to live without a roof . 
  literally . 
  each month on average in 2013 , 5600 persons were evicted out of their houses . 
  with no help at all , and they are lucky if one of the parents finds a job or still have some income through the unemployment aid ( which only last two years and after that , nothing , not like in other countries ) . 
  not everybody wants a place to live in the center of madrid of barcelona , but rather , they want a place to live . 
  the only reason they are not homeless is because of the strong social bonds among peers in spain . 
  it means not only one or two families living in the grandparents ' houses , but even with friends or split among various houses because there is not enough space . 
  the fact that you oversimplify everything and use that blatant demagogy * so reasonable !, 
  everybody wants a mansion !, 
  * is insulting . 
  that ~ ~ remembered ~ ~ reminded me the protest in spain , in which the protesters where shoot with rubber balls . 
  mind you that the protocol requires the police officers to shoot into the floor and only hit the target indirectly ( therefore , reducing the extremely powerful impact and always aiming to the lower , non-life threatening and not so delicate parts of the body , mainly the legs ) . 
  however , police where so brutal that they aimed for the head of the people . 
  in the news , there were revelations about internal bets and so called , * eyes hunter * , because they bet how many people they could left one-eyed , which at the end , it was many . 
  there are thousands of photos of police officers hitting old people , people pacifically sit in the floor with hands up , kids ( literally , school and high-school students in valencia , for example ) , or even people in wheel-chairs . 
  there is no way that can be denied to be police brutality . 
  i thought that in germany was slightly different . 
  i saw a video about a protest with people throwing stones and all , and the police seemed way more proportionate than it was the case in spain . 
  edit : by the way . 
  the rubber bullets used by the spanish police were outlawed by the eu because they were too dangerous . 
  additionally , the eu has warned many times to spain about the overall repression , such as the negative to investigate the torture denounces in police stations and so on . 
  edit : and lets not speak about the police officers infiltrated in the protest to boycott them . 
  '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azhcw4h8674 ) is just one of the cases that was taped . 
  for those who do n't know , the charge against the protesters started because two of them started to throw stones to the police , the anti-riot caught them and started to bruise them until one of them identified as police officer . 
  edit : every . 
  frigging . 
  time . 
  a memory can not remember me . 
  welp , i think i prefer to walk . 
  my aversion for the mass mobs causes me shivers watching that photo . 
  so ... maybe is an exclusive tradition of europe too but . . but we do not try to pack 200 people in a single bus of . . 50 ? 
  sure we go quite * tight * sometimes , but . . how on the earth are they going all in ? 
  is there a second ( and third ) bus out of the photo ? 
  p.s : in spain the queues for the bus are quite weird , albeit usually very calmed . 
  since the stops are not that big , usually three queues are formed and the law of the zip is applied . 
  `` great , a news from spain !, 
  so long i have never heard anything about my country and ... well , fuck . '', 
  being spaniard is a depressive job . 
   jeb bush for president 2016 !, 
  that is what the world needs , another son of a bitch leading a major force in the world . 
  like the other brother did n't create enough problems . 
  it is probably a [ squat toilet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/squat_toilet ) .
