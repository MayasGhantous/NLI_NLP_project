  not in this case . 
  i would like to ask too what your second paragraph even mean . 
  if you are intercepted you can not ask for asylum ? 
  is this a catch me game ? 
  of course they are intercepted , and following the law they are carried to port . 
  not assisting a vessel in distress is anot international crime and something that no sailor ever would do . 
  for me it is clear that nothing of value will be yielded out of this dicussion , so i will leave it here . 
  have a nice day . 
  easy . 
  i think the eu should show some of that `` solidarity '' that so many people like to speak about and help greece and italy , two countries struggling economically , with that problem . 
  but , hey , maybe it is just me . 
  refugees reach germany because germany decided to help to lessen the burden of those two countries . 
  that is my answer to your question . 
  that was back when he thought he would be in charge of trying to create the coalition , not just one of the multiple options . 
  really ? 
  what i see is the mediterranean sea up to the coast of those two countries . 
  p.s : how is israel or lebanon between syria and greece , even if we are only speaking about a land travel ? 
  they are literally in the opposite direction . 
  using comic sans , what a bunch of twats . 
  this is only going to polarize the debate even more . 
  for germany , both of them are . 
  and so is for the us , the [ protocol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protocol_relating_to_the_status_of_refugees ) previous to the convention is also legally binding . 
  that is how the us system works . 
  the us can impose restrictions of the definitions and scopes for the protocol , but they are legally bond to whatever definition they had at the moment a refugee arrived . 
  and asylum is a human right . 
  the german constitution can not withdraw from any of the human rights conventions they have ratified , and thus accepted as proper human rights . 
  it is in the constitution , article 2 . 
  article 2 is a part of the ewigkeitsklausel , meaning that even with a 100 % support , that part can not of the constitution can not be removed or modified in such way that it would go against the spirit of the article . 
  as long as asylum is a human right , it is impossible to legislate against it or try to bypass it . 
  the only thing that germany can do is to establish the criteria and requirements to obtain such asylum , but withdrawing from the refugee convention is out of question . 
  and how many countries are between greece and italy and syria by sea ? 
  i mean , human rights are `` obsolete '' whenever you want to violate them , yes . 
  is there any country between greece or italy and syria ? 
   because ** all ** these so-called refugees are not checked ** at all ** and are basically immigrants . 
  seriously , not a single one is a refugee ? 
  could you be any more exaggerated ? 
  and with so many people agreeing with blatant lie . 
  what a pathetic sub . 
  anyone who wants to publish ? 
  many of the most prestigious journals are part of elsvier . 
  in my honest opinion , this is non sense . 
  children do not need a father and a mother to fill `` roles '' . 
  your comment seems like taken out of the 60s . 
  single parents have it hard because it is easier to take care of children between two that alone , not because some bs about the lack of roles . 
   what fucking reality do you live in where europe is better able to defend itself than the united states ? 
  either you have misunderstood my comment or you are purposely doing it . 
  anyway , i never said that . 
  i said that the eu is perfectly capable of defending itself , even against the us , and that it would be better for the eu to do it , instead of depending on nato , because that is not for free . 
  it comes with the price of letting the us to have too much influence in europe . 
  you are the one being delusional if you think the us has troops in europe for anything else besides their interests and that those interests will always align with the ones of europe in every single issue . 
   it 's not `` buying into '' something , it 'd just being realistic . 
  being realistic about . . what ? 
  that russia is going to march through berlin if the eu pulls out of nato ? 
  that china is going to invade greece , when in fact they can simply buy it as they are doing ? 
  tell me , how much did the nato help when russia decided to annex crimea or invade ukraine ? 
  would have been any different if there was no nato in place ? 
  your meaning of `` being realistic '' is quite different from my definition of it . 
  edit : a few typos . 
  i think the eu should think by itself what is the best course of action . 
  it is clear that the us is currently in crash trajectory with the eu in many issues . 
  the eu and the us should be allies wherever they can find agreement , but the eu should not simply surrender to whatever the us says . 
  in issues like climate change , i would rather treat with china and india than with the us , for example . 
   trump is n't going to serve a second term and with some luck he will be impeached even before that . 
  i do n't care . 
  he is not the issue with the us , he is just a symptom . 
  if he decided to step down tomorrow , the us would still be the same country as it is today . 
  sorry , i do n't buy into the fear mongering rhetoric of `` either us or chaos '' . 
  not having nato or us troops does not mean not having an alliance with other countries like the us , or that you will start to support russia . 
  europe as a region , and the eu as an entity are more than capable to defend themselves against literally any other threat in the world , even the us . 
  the us is in europe because it benefits them , otherwise they would n't . 
  the presence of the troops give them favorable treatment that other partners do not receive . 
  the us has created an empire of commerce , with military posts all around the world , for their own benefit and , as a side effect , it has benefited other countries too . 
  but it would be stupid to confuse the goal with the side effect . 
  additionally , they spend so much in the military , not because of a real threat , but because the military is the biggest government employment program in the world , and reducing it would put a lot of people out of work and not very happy . 
  to justify that , they need more threats , they need more enemies , they need more wars . 
  my idea is very simple : it is increasingly clear that the priorities and objectives of the us and europe as a whole , specially the eu , are ever more discrepant and i would even say confronted . 
  at some point , the us forces in eu will be more of an occupational force again than a protection force . 
  they will serve again to force us to do things we do n't want . 
  we are giving them influence over our lives that they do not deserve to have . 
  p.s : as a side note , i never believed in the `` western world '' . 
  the us and europe are fundamentally different in many important issues in ways that leave a very narrow space for reconciliation . 
  if there is a moron every 8 years , and some slightly less warmonger the rest of the time , then i am not sure how beneficial is it . 
  the problem is that warmonger , imperialistic us is the normal , not the exception . 
  there is no feeling of guilt here in germany . 
  just a sense of historical understanding . 
  nobody in germany feels personally guilty for wwii , they simply accept the worst of their past as they accept the best . 
  as much as they will pride for their philosophers , scientists or even football players , they will repudiate hitler and the nazis without attempts to minimize their crimes . 
  i think it is a much healthier attitude than that of other countries . 
  if anything , it shows a collective strength of character that can hardly be found anywhere else in the world . 
  and third , the only time the alliance has come into `` help '' of one of its members , it was actually to help the us . 
  i am not living in finland the whole year . 
  i move around europe quite a lot . 
  now , for the time i have been there , i liked the cold winters , but the lack of sunlight put a toll on me . 
  summers were nice , better than in spain , because i was n't asking zeus to strike a lighting on me and end my suffering while lying covered in sweat in my bed . 
  on the other hand , the sun being still up at night messed my sleeping schedule quite a bit . 
  let 's keep the joke as it is , a joke , ok ? 
  since the comment i was answering was not happy with it , i thought you were trying to support such views . 
  i know . 
  and there is nothing wrong with reinforcing it also with programming , right ? 
  the same can be said about physics , chemistry , etc.
