  as you can read , schauble said they were fixing the problem of high surplus by 2015 . 
   it means germans can spend more . 
  but they wo n't , at least not in he euro market . 
  that is why germany is running on an illegal 8 % surplus . 
  edit : since people keep complaining about how `` an 8 % surplus is not illegal '' , i will post this here . 
  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-11-15/schaeuble-says-germany-won-t-face-sanctions-on-trade-surplus as the article says , there is a threshold of 6 % surplus above which it is illegal , on the same token that there is a deficit threshold for which other countries have been punished . 
  even schauble ( you know , the guy who knows a bit about german economy ) admits that it is true and compromised to change that for 2015 to avoid the sanctions . 
  well , people here are suggesting that if you opposed bullfighting , even if many spaniards do so , you should not be able to obtain the spanish nationality because `` integration !, 
  we literally have to lit the dumpsters with fire here in munich , because it is pretty damn cold and the refugees have taken all the blankets !, 
  edit : forgot the word fire . 
  actually , the neighbors have a say in the sense that they can raise valid points against the case , but they have to have valid points . 
  that is why the canton has accepted the denounce of the woman and mandated the municipality to repeat the process . 
  and will probably do it again until she is accepted or the neighbors are able to show some valid reasons for her not to obtain the citizenship . 
  no , a democracy is not a rule of the mob . 
  there are rights that protect minorities against the majority , even in switzerland . 
  well , she did n't exactly `` moved in '' as in recently . 
  more like when she was 8 . 
  well , i mean ... 
  he has a point . 
  have you ever seen the dutch and their caravans ? 
  it is hell . 
   migration and subsequent naturalization what is currently not a right ( although personally i think that it should be ) . 
  it is a right , if by law there is a path for which you are eligible . 
  you have the right to follow such path and not being discriminated against for arbitrary reasons . 
  she is clear with the requirements of the law , that is why the canton rejected the decision of the municipality and made it repeat the voting . 
  exactly , they have a say . 
  they specified the law that set the requirements . 
  that is a just system . 
  there are a set of laws that are applied to everyone , without discrimination . 
  if you do n't want vengans in switzwerland , then that should be in the law . 
  no criminal record , blah blah blah , and mandatory meat consumption . 
  anything else is simply arbitrary and , by definition , unfair . 
  her having a citizenship as it is is not her right . 
  however , there is a law , and the law establish clear conditions to naturalization which gives her the right to obtain the citizenship is she is clear . 
  even the canton agrees with her , that is why he municipality had to vote twice , and will probably vote thrice . 
  people is confusing things . 
  she is not claiming citizenship as her birthright . 
  she is claiming the right , provided by the swiss law , of obtaining the citizenship if she fulfills the specified criteria within the law . 
  it is the epitome of a perfectly subjective standard , or are you suggesting that all swiss citizens are exactly the same , thus making the swiss culture ( tm ) something monolithic and objective ? 
   in a lot of countries you have to have a job , for instance , and a clear criminal record . 
  and the rules are clear . 
  a just system can not be arbitrary . 
  if you fulfill those requirements , you are granted the citizenship . 
  this case is so clear , that the higher level of government mandated that the voting should be repeated , and probably could even overturn the decision anyway . 
   freedom of expression is not a protection against backlash . 
  freedom of expression is protection against government sanctioned discrimination . 
  in this case , the town hall is the government and its decision is a government sanctioned action , so it is a very clear of attack to freedom of expression . 
  it would n't be an attack if she never got invited to the neighborhood 's parties , but this is a completely different thing . 
  this is an official gubernatorial decision . 
  there is a right , since there is a clear path to obtain it and she fulfilled the requirements ( and a higher organism is going to probably overturn the decision ) . 
  as an example , in spain , all immigrants who required a certain fulfillment have the right to ask for a nie . 
  if , being clear with the fulfillment , you are denied of it because you are blonde or like deep purple , they are effectively taking away your right . 
  oh , i can ensure you they would . 
  the level of xenophobia against eastern europeans in the west has been stupidly high for years , to the point that they were used as a political weapon . 
  the fact that the most violent gangs robbing in the coast towns of spain came from ee was a big talking point . 
  ee have been more talked about than muslims in many parts of spain . 
  thankfully the mentality has changed . 
  just a comment to show how different the perception is depending on the country . 
  that is very true . 
  the rights of the people on the green party should be taken out too . 
  i mean , traditions , like cultures , are monolithic entities without nuances that should not be disputed . 
  after all , every swiss citizen is exactly the same . 
  better than the postcards from eurovision . 
   that 's the thing though : they 're not claiming to teach `` oriental and african philosophy '' , they 're claiming to teach `` philosophy '' maybe it is because english is not my mother language , but for me ** school of oriental and african studies ** kinda implies the study of oriental and african cultures . 
  i mean , it is in the name . 
  i honestly do not understand this argument . 
  do you think we should teach cervantes and other spanish authors in german philology ? 
  i literally only studied european philosophers in high school , so i do n't know what the fuck is the other redditor talking about . 
  sometimes i swear that i live in an alternative reality to the one of some people here . 
  and they say themselves that those philosophers should be study for the context , just not as a goal . 
  could you explain to me how is it discriminatory to not study western philosophers in the school of oriental and african studies ? 
  as soon as i read telegraph.co.uk , i knew that the title was pure clickbait . 
  so i went into the article and in the second paragraph ...  the student union at the ** school of oriental and african studies ** ( soas ) insists that when studying philosophy `` the majority of philosophers on our courses '' should be from africa and asia . 
  can anyone discuss about this , really ? 
  if someone is studying german philology , should the main courses be about proust , shakespeare or cervantes ? 
   yeah , sure . 
  i am living and working in germany because i landed in a position at the end of my erasmus scholarship , thanks to asking one of my professors . 
  i wanted to make a final project and find a phd position , thus i asked and they had some projects , he knew me from the lectures and i found my position . 
  and i am not a weird case . 
  there are plenty of spanish students who are doing phds here , because they got a contact to ask when they were here . 
  i think you are overestimating the power of speaking with people personally after a year of getting to know each other versus a random asking questions via email . 
  oh , well , if a random guy in the internet says so without any source or further explanation , i am going to blindly believe him !, 
  have a nice day !, 
  no , i meant on mars . 
   ppp is not perfect but when comparing incomes and spending power across countries in different economies it 's the best we have got . 
  no , it is not . 
  people take ppp as the real purchasing power of a region , but in reality is calculated using the gdp , so it has exactly the same flaws as the gdp when comparing regions . 
  the best way to compare regions is to forget the obsession to summarize a very complex reality with a single number . 
  ppp , as gdp and any other economical index is a tool , not a goal in itself . 
  gdp for example , was created during the great depression to identify and quantify the problems of the tanking us economy . 
  it has a very specific meaning with a very specific usage , that people do n't usually respect . 
  they like to throw it around like it is the ultimate goal , the same with ppp . 
  good for them . 
  besides my opinion on the arguments of the article themselves ( i think they are flawed ) , i think europe , and specially the eu , could learn a thing or two of the usa , because it is surely a big and important country that do many things correctly , even if they do other things wrongly . 
  sadly , the article does not address that . 
  however , it is still a good remainder that there is still a lot to do in europe . 
  besides the funny poke , i like the video very much . 
  specially the part in which the speaker explain how the esa achieved not 1 but 3 landing marks in mars !, 
  with just one probe !, 
  those are not very intelligent or well informed people then .
