  the police , the gendarmerie , the cni ( spanish intelligence agency ) . 
  literally everybody who was investigating . 
  they found the declaration of authorship , where the materials for the bombs were achieved and where were they trained . 
  no connection to eta whatsoever . 
  the pp just wanted it to be eta because it was three days before the elections and the iraq war was one of the main points . 
  this was just the last straw . 
  just after the election , almost all of the pp members changed position and only fringe cases remained of people still saying that it was eta . 
  saying that it was eta after all the investigation is like saying that jet fuel can not melt steel beams . 
  most of those points are victims of eta , even those outside euskadi . 
  other important group were the gal ( grupos armados de liberaci\u00f3n ) which were self proclaimed '' '' `` counter-terrorist '' '' '' units which basically committed state terrorism and extra judicial killings of innocent people . 
  then there is a big one in madrid for one of the bloodiest terrorist attack in europe of the century , the 11-m . 
  i was really scared for the last one , because i was young and a big part of my family lived in atocha at the time and we could n't contact them for at least 6-7 hours , because the lines were collapsing . 
  and i thought that half of my family had completely disappear on that day . 
  as an interesting fact , manuela carmena , the current mayor of madrid was a part of the targeted law firm in massacre of atocha , and she is alive because that day she was n't in the office . 
  well , yeah . 
  the first thing most people thought in spain during the 11-m attacks was that eta would claim the authorship . 
  it was soon known that it was actually a terrorist attack perpetrated by an al-qaeda cell and only the government tried to keep pointing at eta for electoral reasons . 
  hello ?? 
  am i the only one who has read the article ? 
  it is literally three fucking paragraphs , you all could try and read it . 
   `` there is much we still do not know with sufficient certainty but ** we must ** , as things stand now , ** assume it was a terrorist attack ** , '' merkel told reporters . 
  this is what she said . 
  how on earth does this mean that merkel said `` just deal with it ? 
  she is just saying that according to the information we have now , this has to be considered a terrorist attack at least for now . 
  did anyone in this thread even read the damn article ?? 
   `` there is much we still do not know with sufficient certainty but ** we must ** , as things stand now , ** assume it was a terrorist attack ** , '' merkel told reporters . 
  she is just saying that we must assume that it was a terrorist attack . 
  what the heck does it have to do with `` just deal with it '' ? 
  by half point . 
  the thing is that people attribute the big numbers to a small group of people and a country with a seizable population of such group and a country with almost none only differ in around 0.5 . 
  take iceland , if you want . 
  they also have barely any gypsy and the are actually higher than spain . 
  why ? 
  have you made an independent poll to know what it ? 
  source ? 
  spain has a million gypsies , 2 % of the population , and still in the lower side , while norway barely has any and is very high . 
  in ee , people marry also very young . 
  in my office , only my colleges coming from ee and russia are married below 25 . 
  for me that is unthinkably young . 
  they are hardly doing that . 
  only a few moderate republicans are doing it and are under fire for it . 
  i think it is not fair to say that republicans are putting country before party , because most are not doing it . 
  yeah , apolitical . 
  trump has appointed a guy who is to the right of scallia . 
  american politics are always more interesting . 
  there is a show attached to them . 
  i would n't say that it is a non stop of american news , at least in spain . 
  we get the most important pieces , like the news of the russian probe , but only when something interesting happens . 
  many people voted for macron as opposition to le pen , but they do not agree with macron . 
  taking into account real voters over the total of the population i would say that 36 % is around it . 
  precisely trump is facing a lot of opposition from the democratic institutions , very unexpectedly taking into account that the republicans control all three branches of government . 
  i am sure poland is * the real deal * and that everyone else is just dumb for not realizing it . 
  this is all a milchm\u00e4dchenrechnung , of course . 
  to begin with your last point , poland is a part of the chinese plans because poland is in the eu . 
  if poland threatened with using the chinese imports as a economical tool against germany or france , poland would disappear from the chinese plans faster than you can say kurwa . 
  it is simply a matter of size . 
  ----------------------------- but , since you mentioned the trade of germany , china and poland , let 's take a look at them : exports of poland : http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/pol/show/all/2015/ germany is 25 % of the exports of poland . 
  by far , the biggest single contributor . 
  even spain is a bigger market for poland than any of the eastern european countries except cz ( which should be counted as central europe , but nobody does in this context ) . 
  just sum up the rest of the eu . 
  china is a 1.2 % . 
  in the event they had to choose , do you think any of the eu countries would leave the eu and choose poland ? 
  because you can not have free trade agreements with single eu countries . 
  so it is one or the other , but not both . 
  exports of germany : http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/deu/show/all/2015/ poland is 8th , with a 3.8 % . 
  polish exports depend 25 % on germany alone . 
  calling this relation symmetrical or strong ties of germany with poland is a bit of an stretch , i think you will agree . 
  exports of china : http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/chn/show/all/2015/ germany and france , the two countries you are threatening to block form china are more than 6 times bigger for chinese exports than poland . 
  i wo n't do the calculation for the entire eu , but just by summing up by eye , it is at least 15 more . 
  believing that china will choose poland over the eu , in the case of that trade war that you mentioned , is very improbable , in my opinion . 
  ------------------------------------ the problem with the milchm\u00e4dchenrechnungen is that everything goes whenever you use vague terms and arguments that , on the surface , may seem like valid . 
  but once you start to crunch just a few numbers it is very easy to see that all of this fall apart faster than a house of cards . 
  is it more beneficial for all parties that poland remains in the eu ? 
  in my opinion , indeed . 
  would poland have the upper hand in a hypothetical polexit ? 
  only a delusional would think so .

  the uk is also the real bomb and everyone else is just dumb for not realizing it .
