  but i actually agree with you in a sense , it takes more than a piece of paper to truly belong to any nation . 
  thing is , i have that piece of paper and also european values which is more than can be said for most `` european '' muslims , of which i assume you 're one because why the hell would you be posting here otherwise ? 
  you 're saying i 'm not european , but what the fuck are * you * ? 
   also , no answer regarding how this is different to any military conscription in history . 
  do you really not see the difference between indiscriminate male military conscription and the * permanent * separation of young boys by an oppressive ethnic group from the oppressed group ? 
  boys which are subsequently subjected to forced religious conversion and physical mutilation and brainwashing that forever sets them apart from their families and communities and then turned into sex slaves . 
  do you think the existence of janissaries somehow makes this better ? 
  [ and here 's a citation that directly contradicts yours ] ( http://epubs.utah.edu/index.php/historia/article/download/629/491 ) now what ? 
   that does n't make you spanish . 
  i have spanish citizenship , which says otherwise .

   well i would say the morality behind the action is different . 
  intent is has no influence on the moral weight of an action . 
  doing something for what you believe are good reasons has the same direct outcome as doing it for bad reasons ; it causes the same amount of harm . 
  sometimes that harm can be morally justifiable based because of its other effects , like how the harm of an injection is justified through the effects of the vaccine . 
  but that 's not the same thing . 
   i suggest that a cuban boat-person living in the us does n't deem who is european and who is n't . 
  i have a spanish passport , share the same native language and inherited the same civilisational values and religion . 
  you are in a / r/europe thread defending slavery and mutilation -- which one of us is more european ? 
   in devsirme you were n't allowed to take a single child or take more than one child from a family - so do n't portray it as though big bad turks came and raped the family and stole all their children . 
  oh wow , so kind of them . 
  you disgust me . 
  muslim it is i guess . 
   not really , there is a difference between killing a killer and killing kids . 
  what difference is that except for the amount of people being killed ? 
   lol , when you say mutilating you deliberately play on words to make it sound like they had their arms removed or something . 
  guess what ? 
  to most europeans there difference is only one of scope . 
  if you do n't know that then you 're either completely blind or not european . 
   i linked you an academic work on the subject . 
  i doubt you 've read it because you 'd rather keep pushing a misinformed agenda rather than learn something for once . 
  there 's no such thing as an academic authority on morality . 
  you ca n't defend against actions that people deem immoral by just saying `` no , it was n't actually immoral '' . 
  the only thing you can do is argue that these immoral actions did n't actually occur , good fucking luck with that . 
   cool . 
  i 'm not a turk nor am i from turkey , so keep throwing stones , bud . 
  then you 're either a muslim or an idiot . 
  which country are you from ? 
  yes , mutilating . 
  dhimmi boys were `` converted '' to islam and circumcised against their will . 
  they were also routinely turned into sex slaves . 
  slavery which in the ottoman empire , by the way , lasted until well into the 19th century . 
  ----- the fact that people like you still take * pride * and have the balls to defend the horrific acts your ancestors committed out of some misguided form of national pride is disgusting . 
  how many spaniards do you think you 'll find on here that will defend the massacres and genocide in the new world ; how many belgians will suddenly turn apologist when one mentions the congo ? 
  you have a hell of a lot of growing up to do . 
  your culture is sick . 
  what the fuck is `` arroz a la cubana '' ? 
  i 'm cuban and that does n't look like anything my mom 's ever cooked . 
  they probably figured the political cache of having a `` civilised '' muslim in a visible position was worth the risk . 
  remember these are politicians , having `` green '' in front of their party name just makes them green snakes -- they 're still reptiles . 
  feminism !, 
  http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/wr9810135.htm 25 % of black swan couples are made up of homosexual swans . 
  they will steal eggs to raise together or use a female surrogate but otherwise either mate for life or spend many years together . 
  about 10 % of male rams will mate exclusively with other rams , regardless of whether females are available . 
  these are two of the most well known examples . 
  25 % of couples among black swans are male couples . 
  they raise chicks together and everything . 
  believe it or not oppression and self-martyrdom by the religious is not restricted to the us . 
  and some people still claim that europe and turkey could ever be culturally compatible . 
  thank god for erdogan i guess . 
  so you want americans to still protect your asses but otherwise not use their power to pursue their own interests ? 
  fucking hell , the hypocrisy . 
   i always found it a bit odd that it 's the people who were n't subject to the system that complains about this while the ones that went through it and now live in turkey are just fine with it . 
  after generations of brainwashing , you mean ? 
   you make this sound so much worse than it is in fact i view it as something really good [ ... ] really ? 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  stealing children from their parents , mutilating them and forcefully converting them to islam is a good thing ? 
  women are already the safest demographic in most countries around the world , specially developed ones . 
  if they do n't feel safe it is because they 're constantly brainwashed into believing their country is some kind of rape camp . 
  there 's not that many of them ; in europe they can do * a lot * of damage by destroying social cohesion and through terrorist attacks , in isis territory they 're just a drop in a very large bucket of crazy drops and there 's a good chance they 'll be killed . 
   and worst of all is that they are reducing the budget for foreign aid to be able to afford this . 
  good . 
  that kind of aid is bad . 
   this is / r/europe not / r/eu . 
  what does that have to do with anything ? 
   oh , and we 're not even the biggest nationality on this sub since it became a geo-default . 
  non-europeans do n't post it , apart from the occasional american , canadian or australian . 
  yes , europe is horrible . 
  please vote to leave the eu in june . 
  you 're disproportionately represented here because this is an english speaking site -- it was one of the first things i noted in my original post . 
  but the reason * why * there 's so many of you here was n't the point of it ; the point was that this disproportionate british presence , a large percentage of them whose only concern seem to be the eu and britain 's place in it and other forms of one-issue participation , makes this subreddit a worse place . 
  hence i 'm hoping that after you leave the eu things will calm down and there wo n't be so many posters here that should be posting in r/unitedkingdom or or r/ukpolitics instead . 
  still not relevant . 
  why is that relevant ? 
  whatever . 
  that has nothing to do with the point of my post , which is that the disproportionate number of british posters on this sub inflate british concerns and allow them to ride roughshod over the subreddit , turning it into a battle zone about their petty one issue concerns . 
  stop being butthurt for a second and actually listen to what people are saying . 
  whatever the case i find myself ardently wishing there were fewer british posters here . 
  one can only hope they 'll fade into the background once they leave the eu . 
  it annoys me how they monopolize the conversation by virtue of this being an english-speaking site which makes their concerns seem disproportionately important ; always infecting unrelated discussions and creating tons of noise on the site . 
  it 'd also help if so many british posters were n't one-issue posters . 
  they 're 7 % of the eu population yet it seems every third flag on here is the british flag . 
  seriously ?
