  firstly , indians are considered `` model immigrants '' , like the chinese . 
  africans less so . 
  that said , we 're not talking about a minority group here co-existing along the majority with similar fertility rates after a couple of generations . 
  the population of europe is * aging * . 
  once a population goes below replacement level , it will continue to contract indefinitely unless there 's a boon or the factors that led to this low fertility in the first place are addressed . 
  so we 're not talking about the people that will live alongside us as a minority of the population , but those that will * replace * us when we 're gone . 
  -- it seems to me that people like you fundamentally fail to understand how population growth works . 
  many in this thread already have made posts that makes it obvious they seem to be believe that after our population starts to collapse , it will magically stabilise at some desirable , environmentally conscious and `` sustainable level . 
  ** that 's not how it works **, 
  that 's sarcasm right ? 
   [ ... ] if anything it will be enhanced by the diversity . 
  can you give some specific examples about how we 'd be enhanced by this diversity ? 
  something beyond the usual asinine `` oh their food is nice '' would be good . 
  if you 're referring to cultures from other developed countries , yes it might have a positive effect even as it lowers social cohesion , but they wo n't be the ones from where our immigrants come from . 
  * diverse * implies existence along a spectrum -- unless you believe all cultures are of equal value -- then for optimum maximum diversity you need to integrate cultures from every region of that spectrum . 
  that 's a fucking dumb idea . 
  as a gay dude , i for one would prefer not to be `` enhanced '' by the diversity of being stoned to death or thrown off a building . 
  just saying . 
  if only it were that simple . 
  [ some of the most traditional countries around the world have fertility rates indistinguishable from socially progressive european countries ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/countriesbyfertilityrate.svg/2000px-countriesbyfertilityrate.svg.png ) this shift is due to something a lot more fundamental than that . 
   it is good news in fact . 
  it means that the average life length is increasing and that the size of the population is at a stable , sustainable level . 
  that is ** not ** what it means . 
  life expectancy is rising very , very slowly and by 2060 will only be around 82 in europe , if you project the same current trends that this graph is based on . 
  these numbers are almost completely due to blow-replacement level fertility . 
  post-communist collapse . 
  all former soviet countries saw a massive depopulation that is still ongoing after the fall of the soviet union -- also , eastern european immigration to the west . 
  what 's the point if european civilisation collapses ? 
  personally i 'd rather see the whole continent turn into a wasteland than north africa . 
  they 're going to other parts of europe anyway so the map remains the same . 
  casuals . 
  i 'd tell them to get on my level but in this instance i think i 'll pass . 
  only for two generations ; after that the fertility rates are indistinguishable . 
   the world is overpopulated . 
  overpopulation is a function of how many people a certain region can support at a certain standard of living ; by this metric the developed world is the least overpopulated part of earth . 
  in the same sense , we 've yet to hit peaks of any significant resource . 
  scarcity is dropping across the entire world , be it water , energy or food . 
   better to have a country of 10 million living in absolute comfort enjoying the benefits of ever increasing automation , than a country of 100 million where most are poor , a detriment to the environment and a threat to human survival . 
  that 's a false dichotomy . 
  you can have a large , productive population that , thanks to technology , is not dependeant upon of the environment regardless of its state . 
  what we 're seeing here is the opposite of that . 
  the fertility rate required for population replacement is 2.1 , anything under that and you 'll see contraction and demographic collapse . 
  and once this collapse begins , it 's not going to stop at whatever amount of people hippies believe that `` mother earth '' can carry unless the underlying reasons why people are not reproducing are addressed . 
  it 's a perfect example of a tragedy of the commons . 
  -- at the end of his book * apex * , the transhumanist novelist ramez naam wrote :  * `` this is about people power , dr , '' she said . 
  `` you told me once this century 's most vital raw material is the human mind , did you not ? '' *  * lakshmi dabir nodded again . 
  *  * `` good , '' ayesha dani said . 
  `` because we seem to have more of those than anyone . 
  now go unlock them . 
  this will be the indian century . '' * this is not meant to be a cautionary tale about how the poor , foreign masses in developing countries are going to make us irrelevant . 
  that process is already in motion , we could n't stop it if we wanted to and i for one do n't believe we should ; it 's a good thing . 
  what it should bring to mind is the fact that the human brain is a * resource * and having more of them is a boon , even if the byproduct of producing the handful one minds that will drive technological progress is hundreds of thousands of less productive ones . 
  a large population is a boon in the long term , not only for any specific country but for humanity as a whole . 
  we 're looking at a whole continent withering and dying . 
  i was n't being completely serious with that comment ; just throwing his scorn back in his face . 
  so britain will go the other way ? 
  reduce tensions by slowly adapting all muslim customs . 
  that sounds ideal . 
  except you know , for the whole gay rights thing that i just mentioned . 
   i would say that currently there is not so much of a differance between them if anything the republicans focus more on principles and the democrats focus on buying votes with free stuff taken from any productive person they can find . 
  you sound like a fucking ideologue . 
  i went as far as to concede that * both * parties have rights issues that they are concerned about . 
  but that 's not good enough for you ; you need good guys and bad guys . 
  well , how 's this for you ? 
  as a gay man , republicans have been the enemies of my kind since the inception of the gay rights movement and even * now * they 're still grumbling and trying to roll back progress . 
  [ the two things are nothing alike . 
  what you 're citing happened a very long time ago , and a lot changed after that . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/southern_strategy )  however , there actually are people who will try to tell you that the democrats are the ones that defend civil liberties . 
  as a gay man , i 'd say so . 
  to be fair , both parties care about * certain * kinds of civil liberties . 
  the republicans are all over religious rights , gun rights , etc. 
   misogynists that word does n't have the power it used to . 
  you 're not going to cow or shame anyone by invoking it . 
  due to people like you it 's lost all meaning . 
  [ here 's a breakdown of the numbers presented by the cdc here , without the fudging that the cdc attempts to do to hide male victims . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/shfmnpb.jpg ) [ and here 's a good article highlighting that dishonesty ] ( http://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers/ )  he fact that you do n't make a thread about violence against men , but instead ( ab ) use it to answer to concerns about sexual violence against women , puts you in company with the very worst kind of people . 
  and saying this makes you a dishonest cunt . 
  did you somehow miss the post i was replying to ? 
    if they did , then it is right to frame this as an issue about refugees . 
  if they did n't , ** then it is an issue of women 's safety from men in society . 
  ** women in germany society have nothing to more to fear from men in this context than men do from women -- or at least they did n't before the whole migrant crisis . 
  to paint the issue of sexual assault as the bitch quoted did , and this poster reinforced , is fucking disgusting . 
  the * overwhelming * majority of people in the middle east are muslims , specially so in north africa -- about 91 % . 
  those numbers would narrow even further if you weigh them against the ethnic distribution that currently lives in germany . 
  in the context of this discussion , thehandsominator 's quote above can not be anything but ridiculous . 
  how about we call her a bigoted , sexist cunt and leave it at that ? 
  [ here you go . 
  ] ( http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_ipv_report_2013_v17_single_a.pdf )   implies i , a man , hate men , because i said rape was n't brought to germany in 31st dec 2015 by arab men , but infact has a broader history in the country baseless oh , but you said more than that :  if they did n't , then it is an issue of ** women 's safety from men in society . 
  ** no , rape it 's not in fact an issue of `` women 's safety from men in society '' . 
  not in the us and i strongly doubt the numbers are any different in germany . 
  unlike what you 've been lied to and manipulated into believing by gender opportunists , rape is not a gendered problem in the west . 
  how about you stop being a sexist , bigoted twat ? 
  a straw man is the refutation of an argument that 's not actually proposed by one 's opponent . 
  i 'm not refuting your argument here , i 'm refuting your premise by flipping around the evidence you 've brought to the discussion . 
   statistics what is that even supposed to mean ? 
  do we suddenly live in a different universe where statistics somehow show that women are responsible for any of the things i mentioned ? 
  i 've got some statistics for you , pulled directly from the [ u.s. bureau of labor statistics ] ( http://www.bls.gov/ ) * 99 % of coal miners are men * 100 % of oil drill workers are men * 99 % of garbage collectors are men * 88 % of patrol police officers are men * 100 % of power line installers are men * 95.5 % of firefighters are men * 92 % of construction workers are men the list goes on , and it 's a very long one and it would look not much different if i started to add in scientific and technological research and discoveries . 
  according to you , it 's only fair if we * generalise * men by these numbers . 
  they sure as hell are a lot more definite than the graph you linked . 
  if we 're going to generalise men for the bad they do , in contrast to women , why not do the opposite ?
