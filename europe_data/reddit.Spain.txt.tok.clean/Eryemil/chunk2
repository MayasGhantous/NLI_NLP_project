  good all intra-european friendship . 
  i guess it beats wwiii . 
  `` what has the eu done for me ? '', 
  `` they reeled in isps that were sticking it to you . '', 
  `` yes , but what have they done besides that ?! '', 
  not really ; specially not in english . 
  this whole exchange made me laugh out loud . 
  not to mention that the richer states in the us subsidy the poorer . 
  no , i 'm pretty sure that qualifies as `` homo '' . 
  i was hoping they 'd show his penis . 
  that 's exactly the fucking point . 
  how old exactly are these laws ? 
  how much has canada changed for the better since ? 
  turkey is sliding * backwards . 
  is n't that what the eu flag is for ? 
  i hate myself for writing this but ... sweden yes ? 
  i think you 've lost this one . 
   it 's not a cult . 
  right . 
  if a member of a cult tells me his cult is not , in fact , a cult i should believe him . 
  or maybe we just do n't like cults . 
  ah yes , i 'd forgotten about regeneru 's study . 
  you might want to take a look at what his colleagues and other authorities in the field think about it . 
  while my statement above could be technically wrong , this does n't invalidate the scientific consensus on the matter . 
  i do n't have them more at hand than you do ; i ca n't even recall the names . 
  but there 's no evidence that children of same-sex couples are more maladjusted than children of heterosexual couples . 
  every longitudinal study i can think of corroborates this fact . 
  ukraine strong !, 
   anyone can get a top-notch education now . 
  this is simply not true . 
  many europeans * might * have an education available to them but that does n't mean they are capable of learning in the fields where future jobs will become available . 
  and this is besides the point anyway , as i already said , eventually there will simply be no jobs left . 
  this wave of automation is just the beginning , when doctors start getting supplanted in a few years is when people will begin to shit themselves . 
   frees up human capital for more interesting stuff . 
  more interesting stuff most people are incapable of doing . 
  not at all . 
  the people of catalunya also speak a different language and have a different culture . 
  not exactly like it . 
  you 're going to have to get used to it ; it sounds a lot less awkward in many languages . 
  good thing my original post was not a reply to you then ; you brought something into the discussion that was n't there from the beginning . 
   well , first off , the whole thing would be on top of a basic income grant that is an assumption that was * never * part of my argument . 
  not everyone can be an artist and rich people want exceptional pieces of art or at least those created by men with the status of artists . 
  this is as good a solution in the long-term as suggesting that currently middle-class people should aspire to become servants of the elite and anyway it is simply . 
  not . 
  enough . 
   there 's also lots of socially-oriented jobs that we could very well use , but are currently not economically feasible . 
  elaborate . 
  i 've lost my patience after the 7th iteration of this exchange . 
  i 'm not trying to `` convince '' anyone . 
  i 'm simply stating the facts about technological unemployment as i understand them . 
  if you have some evidence/argument that leads you not to believe what i 'm saying that you ca n't , for some reason , communicate then that 's unfortunate but i ca n't do anything about it . 
  it 's a simple logical chain , either you understand it or you do n't . 
  belief has nothing to do with it . 
  i 'm tired of having to repeat myself when i 've already written more than one perfectly understandable post . 
  that 's what i 've been fucking doing for the past five hours . 
  ** there wo n't be any jobs for them to take . 
  ** during the industrial revolution unskilled workers went from the farm to the factory . 
  now the factories are being worked by robots and overseen by a few technicians/supervisors . 
  the stupidest/uneducated portion of society will be hit first and hardest . 
  there will be literally ** nothing ** for them to do but it does n't just top there . 
  medicine , for example , will be one of the first high-skilled occupations to be mostly automated which is doubly bad since it is also one of the occupations with the highest time-investment required to practice , leaving current doctors less capable of retraining in for a position that will allow them to maintain their standard of living . 
  how about you read my post above ? 
  this is getting ridiculous . 
  -- ** whatever jobs new technologies make available they will be : ** ** 1 ) concentrated farther and farther up the skill pyramid . 
  ** ** 2 ) and fewer and fewer in number . 
  ** -- how difficult can that be to understand ? 
  here 's the five year old version : stupid and/or uneducated people ca n't compete for an ever-increasingly small number of highly skilled jobs . 
  specially because automation wo n't just affect low-skill jobs but also things such as medicine and other occupations we currently consider high-skilled . 
  it worked out well because the people formerly working as farmers were able to get other jobs ; this wo n't be the case now . 
  for fuck 's sake . 
  it 's a simple concept . 
  i said other machines would be * making them * , which is not the same thing . 
  but eventually , narrow ais will be desgining them as well , yes . 
  but that 's farther in the future ; how many factory workers do you think can become mechanical engineers ? 
  and how many engineers do you really need to design these machines that is the issue , as i 've already stated . 
  whatever jobs new technologies make available they will be : 1 ) concentrated farther and farther up the skill pyramid . 
  2 ) and fewer and fewer in number . 
  on the contrary , it 's machines all the way * up * and as our technology progresses they will continue to encroach upon what we now consider `` work '' until there will be very little left that 99 % of the population can do to earn a wage . 
  other machines will be making those parts , not people . 
  opportunities for employment are reduced here at every step , not gained or even `` balanced out '' . 
   i do n't think so , `` iq '' has technically been increasing on average , and better education helps a lot with the technical aspects . 
  i am aware of that ; it 's still not enough , specially because such changes are only really obvious generationally . 
  what jobs can truck drivers , taxi drivers and such can expect to find once self-driving cars become the standard in the next few decades ? 
  not only that , there 's such a thing as an iq bell curve . 
  more and more people simply wo n't have the capacity to keep up not to mention the degradation of neuroplasticity we suffer as we age . 
   someone has to design and operate that shit . 
  that still means an massive reduction of available jobs . 
  yes , new industries will be created but they will be created at the very top of the skill pyramid leaving increasingly larger and larger sections of the population unemployable . 
  think about it . 
  i 'm surprised you know radcliffe simonask , i figured you jacked off to mlp . 
  common sense , in my r/europe ? 
  this simply can not stand !, 
  / facepalm, 
  were all nazis evil ? 
  i 'm not being cheeky ; at what point is it ok to generalise ? 
  what percentage of muslims do you imagine are homophobic ? 
   the issue here being ignored is the lack of muslim foster parents in the netherlands . 
  yeah . 
  ** that 's ** the issue . 
  for fuck 's sake .
