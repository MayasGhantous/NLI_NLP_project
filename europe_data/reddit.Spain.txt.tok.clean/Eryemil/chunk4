  it drives home the point that sexual pleasure is subjective , even if nerve function is not . 
   as for your links , they 're all relying on auxiliary ethical arguments and issues with liability . 
  this is not even true . 
  most of these sources deal directly with the supposed medical benefits of circumcision and why they are either not relevant to europe or outright fabrications/misinterpretations . 
   your criticism is not appropriate . 
  the science is independent of any country .

   if you have any issue with the studies and what the findings were based on , then argue against their methodology . 
  i could , easily , but it is your burden to prove that : 1 ) these supposed benefits are true . 
  2 ) they are relevant to men in europe and the rest of the developed world . 
  3 ) they would justify male circumcision to begin with . 
   well , it 's a blatant lie about the latter then . 
  and it 's not about the former ? 
  the reasons it could be true for one would also hold for the other , even if it does not justify cutting off body parts . 
  females produce as much or even more secretions than men do , including smegma and all that . 
  they more genital folds , in more awkward locations and covering a large , slimy hole . 
  i 'd really like to hear why you believe women have less genital hygiene concerns than men . 
   i may not know how exactly fgm compares to mgm , but i stand by the statement that the former ( regardless of the latter ) is barbaric so you have no evidence for believing as you do yet you 'll continue to hold these beliefs ? 
  it 'd help if you actually understood what fgm and mgm are . 
  for starters , there 's more to mgm than the procedures where the foreskin and frenulum are amputated and there 's more to fgm beyond digging out the entire clitoris like a root vegetable or sewing up the vagina . 
  genital mutilation is a spectrum of practices that range from very invasive/harmful to not and fgm and mgm are very comparable at every step of the way . 
   whereas the serious female genital mutilation you 're referring to is relatively common . 
  yet other forms of male genital mutilation are even * more * common than any female type . 
  it is extremely dishonest how you focus on rarity when convenient and severity when convenient . 
  pick one or the other , if you must . 
  either we should focus our efforts on stopping the most severe forms of genital mutilation , the most common -- or maybe , just maybe , the right thing to do is to accept that all forms of genital mutilation are unethical and act accordingly . 
   for instance , many women can not have orgasms without a clitoris [ ... ] i challenge you to find evidence for this claim . 
  it is made quite often yet evidence for it is quite thin on the ground . 
  as i 've already mentioned in this thread , every study i can think of involving women from places where female circumcision is normalised will show that their self-reported sexual experiences are no different from uncircumcised women . 
  and for the record , circumcised men self-report the same , * unless * they 've been circumcised as adults and then they report a loss of sexual function . 
  i am not aware of any similar studies where women have undergone adult circumcision and i doubt any will be made any time soon . 
  on the other hand , studies that focus on actually measuring genital response do show a loss of sensation in circumcised men , though once again , no such studies exist for women . 
   the reason for circumcision is mostly hygenic , fgm purposefully deprives women of sexual pleasure . 
  i asked you specifically about motives , not results . 
  by the way , hygiene is used as a justification for both mgm and fgm even though most male circumcisions are religious in nature , first and foremost . 
   e.g. 
  the fact that one still lets you orgasm , the other not so much ? 
  it seems like a logical claim to make yet circumcised women would disagree and in fact , i ca n't think of any self-reported study done among women in places where fgm is normalised that has corroborated this claim . 
  despite the fact that logic tells us that destroying erogenous tissue should also cause a proportional loss of sexual function , neither circumcised men * or * women report that * unless * they were circumcised as adults -- for men , anyway . 
  i also ca n't think of any study where women undergo adult circumcision . 
  in other words , while it is almost certain that both male and female circumcision degrade sexual function , victims of it will generally not be able to tell the difference and thus not only is ruled out as a viable motivation for the practice , we ca n't really tell to what extent it does affect sexuality , only that it * should * . 
   it 's not exactly the same , alright ? 
  why ? 
  and for the record , i do n't want you to shoot anyone ; i 'm against capital punishment . 
   but only a fool would deny the massive difference in its severity what difference are these ? 
   and the fact that the motives for fgm are much more vile . 
  what motives ? 
   a major percentage , probably a majority of fgm cases involve serious mutilation , with permanent loss of function . 
  most forms of genital mutilation that involve the excision of tissue result in a permanent loss of function ; the amputation of the foreskin and frenulum being one of them , labial and clitoral hood ablation probably not . 
   there are also much more unpleasant forms of fgm . 
  the same can be said for mgm . 
  genital mutilation is a spectrum . 
  according to the who , there are four major types of fgm : ** clitoridectomy ** : partial or total removal of the clitoris or the clitoral hood . 
  ** excision ** : partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora , with or without excision of the labia majora ** infibulation ** : narrowing of the vaginal opening through the creation of a covering seal . 
  the seal is formed by cutting and repositioning the inner , or outer , labia , with or without removal of the clitoris . 
  ** other ** : all other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes , e.g. 
  pricking , piercing , incising , scraping and cauterizing the genital area . 
  -- the different forms of mgm are not as well documented by the who because they are just as varied , from penile subincision and perforation to dorsal splitting on the foreskin , gauging and so on . 
  this does not take into account the punitive genital mutilation used against males in some parts of the world which females are wholly spared such as castration and penectomy . 
  -- if we were to rank all extant forms of genital mutilation currently practiced regardless of target , intent or rarity according to invasiveness and resulting loss of function the list would look a bit like this : * castration * penectomy * infibulation * total removal of the clitoris * penile subincision * partial clitoris excision * complete removal of the foreskin and frenulum * partial removal of the foreskin with or without loss of the frenulum * penile urethral perforation * dorsal slitting for the foreskin and foreskin perforation * labial ablation with or without removal of the clitoral hood * excision of the clitoral hood * pricking , slicing and otherwise damaging the glans * pricking , slicing or otherwise damaging the clitoris, 
  would you also kill all the men that mutilate boys ? 
  so you link us to a site from a country where male genital mutilation is endemic , and whose doctors benefit directly from the practice and who are likely to be themselves circumcised men . 
  you 'd think that looking at what european institutions have to say on the matter would be more relevant to us here : * [ royal dutch medical association ] ( https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:p-fr79ian18j:knmg.artsennet.nl/web/file?uuid%3d579e836d-ea83-410f-9889-feb7eda87cd5%26owner%3da8a9ce0e-f42b-47a5-960e-be08025b7b04%26contentid%3d77976+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=adgeesijiumgtwndbob5lyjkxbqbdhdc7sgpdksvab_u-f6mdmicttpno6hl8fvusr46vkwpdyvolkceoft9pcnl0rhlmi0tixt7zzex8igblvc3jliqembe5rhjt_dqwkafhm9nbid9&amp;sig=ahietbqr3ifgjqxhgfnnynnpslnwgb3nnq&amp;pli=1 ) * [ finnish medical association ] ( http://www.laakariliitto.fi/uutiset/tiedote.html?opcode=show/news_id=1131/news_db=web_sll2005/type=2 ) * [ french national council for aids ] ( http://www.cns.sante.fr/img/pdf/2007-05-24_rap_en_politique_internationale.pdf ) * [ german association of child and youth doctors ] ( http://www.kinderaerzte-im-netz.de/bvkj/kinpopup/psfile/pdf/70/121126_ste50aa5e211e6a6.pdf ) * [ swedish pediatric association ] ( http://www.upi.com/top_news/world-news/2012/02/19/swedish-doctors-urge-ban-on-circumcision/upi-61961329678560/ ) * [ the college of physicians and surgeons of saskatchewan ] ( http://www.cmaj.ca/content/167/5/532.2.full ) * [ royal college of surgeons of england ] ( http://www.rcseng.ac.uk/publications/docs/male_circumcision.html ) * [ british medical association ] ( http://bma.org.uk/-/media/files/pdfs/practical%20advice%20at%20work/ethics/circumcision.pdf ) * [ royal australasian college of physicians ] ( http://www.racp.edu.au/index.cfm?objectid=65118b16-f145-8b74-236c86100e4e3e8e ) * [ south african medical association ] ( http://www.icgi.org/downloads/sama-nocirc-2011-06-25.pdf ) * [ norwegian council of medical ethics ] ( http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/gulbrandsen1/ ), 
   male circumcision is significantly different to fgm . 
  how are they different ? 
   the kinds of physiological and psychological damages females encounter are n't present in the males . 
  can you substantiate this claim ? 
  preferably with studies done on circumcised women in places where female circumcision is normalised ? 
   not to mention circumcision has beneficial medical consequences . 
  whether something has benefits does not solely determine if it is beneficial . 
  amputating the breast buds of infant girls has obvious benefits , for example . 
  there 's more to an accurate cost benefit analysis than that . 
  also , there * is * actually some evidence that female circumcision has benefits but it is dismissed by western doctors because this research is performed by people that practice female circumcision , yet funnily no one seems to consider the inverse . 
  there is actually next to none research done on the subject however , so it 's very easy to say that it absolutely has no * proven * benefits when the subject is so taboo in countries with actual resources to conduct research that such research could never be conducted in the first place . 
  you do realise the overwhelming majority of people that perform circumcisions on females are in fact female themselves , right ? 
   especially since the girls do n't get it done to them until they 're old enough to understand they 're being mutilated and usually by unqualified people at that the overwhelming majority of male circumcisions are performed on boys 6 to 12 years of age . 
   no real doctor or surgeon would perform such a procedure , it 's usually some old village woman who does it . 
  it depends . 
  in places such as indonesia and egypt it is performed by trained medical professionals , in others not . 
  just like male circumcision . 
   the procedure involves removing not only the clitoris , but all of the outside vulva area . 
  genital mutilation , for both sexes , involves a wide spectrum of practices and traditions . 
  not all forms of fgm involve full or even partial clitoridectomy . 
   but there is no reason to circumcise a woman unless it 's to control her . 
  parents circumcise their daughters because they believe it is the right thing to do ; they * do * believe it is more hygienic , more aesthetic , religiously mandated , etc. 
  basically the exact same reasons boys are circumcised . 
  -- basically nothing you 've written here is right . 
  if you do n't have any clue what you 're talking about then you might consider refraining from propagating your thoughts -- such misinformation has consequences .
