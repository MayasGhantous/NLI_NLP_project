  how many women are willing to pay for a man to stay at home ? 
  how many women are willing to date a man without a job , let alone marry him ? 
  except the world * has * been changing . 
  people do n't become that much more conservative as they age , they generally maintain the beliefs they were raised with ; it just appears otherwise because it is the world that is changing around them . 
  nice friends , those . 
  1 ) ** no ** five out of nine of the current moderators after this `` election '' are brits and the question posed is if we want * more * ?!, 
  how about asking if we 'd like less or if you want to be less inflammatory : a broader range of moderators spread out between all european timezones and capable of covering a greater amount of european languages . 
  if you 're going to pick a plurality of moderators from one particular country at least choose one where people actually speak more than one fucking language . 
  ** and with good reason , if the above is enough to by . 
   btw , what do you think of this music [ 1 ] ? 
  xd i thought it was funny but it 's not really something i 'd listen to at home . 
  too fake to be sexy ; reminds me of why i choose not to date women . 
  i only blurred my name because everyone does it ; i want to be one of the cool kids . 
  also because reddit 's retarded admins would probably ban me for doxxing myself . 
  at least one australian uses it and i like him better than you ( so far ) . 
   yeah , we do n't actually call it `` aussie . '', 
  according to the internet it is part of common usage , though rare . 
  a friend of mine says it all the time and i find it cute . 
  i have good friends in adelaide and brisbane who i talk to/visit often and from what they tell me the price of things varies a lot depending on what city you are in as well as what you 're actually buying ; food and other necessities seemed very cheap to me while some electronics and software were very expensive . 
   australia seems like heaven but from recent posts on reddit it seems they have to pay twice for almost everything . 
  much exaggerated , like most everything on reddit . 
  a few headlines and comments on / r/worldnews does not an informed view make . 
  only certain products tend to have such disproportionate pricing in aussie and usually at about a 40 % markup . 
   photoshop enthusiasts - avoid at all costs . 
  only big firms and high-profile professionals pay for adobe software licenses these days . 
  [ i may or may not have paid for these . 
   the british public will vote according to their own personal beliefs . 
  i pity you if you really believe that . 
  they will vote according to which side takes out the most adds and buys the best spokesmen . 
   besides , whats to stop the u.k. from initiating our own free-trade agreements should we leave the e.u. ? 
  deeply unequal bargaining positions might not stop it but it 'll certainly mar the results . 
  they are irrelevant . 
  the british public will vote however they are told to vote and this pretty much means that the likelihood that they eurosceptic message will drown out the pro-eu side is even lower now -- and it was n't very high to begin with . 
  the british eurosceptics must be flipping their shit . 
  if this goes through ( which it almost certainly will ) then this is pretty much the end of any talk of the uk leaving the eu . 
   do i think they invented that farm for the report ? 
  totally not . 
  straw man . 
  they would have been shown what they wanted to be seen . 
   am i trying to do my best given the realities ? 
  i only trust clandestine footage . 
   but , it 's more important to be able to cover the dietary needs of a person than his entertainment needs . 
  that 's true , but this is undermined by both choice and ready availability of alternatives . 
  cruelty is just as prevalent in organic farms as in conventional factory farms . 
  every report i 've seen on the issue ( and live video footage ) confirms as much . 
  i never said that bullfighting was good -- i find the practice repulsive . 
  what 's almost as repulsive to me me however is the hypocrisy of sheltered little princesses like the german . 
  so short-sighted . 
  do you think that the animals you eat just come into being up fully-grown on the way down the slaughter line ? 
  haha . 
  you 're a perfect example of a hypocritical modern-age hippie . 
  have you ever visited the factories where the animals you eat are reared ? 
   but there 's an ethical difference between killing an animal ( or putting it through any kind of distress/torture ) for eating and for pure entertainment . 
  there 's really not , at least for most people in the developed world that can actually choose their diet . 
   the whole meat producing process and legislation is geared towards avoiding as much harm as possible while still eating the animal . 
  completely and utterly irrelevant . 
  you 're hiding behind intent when the end result is exactly the same and arguably much worse ; bulls raised for the fights lead comfortable lives , animals raised for food production often suffer horrendously every moment they are alive . 
  do n't you think that 's a bit hypocritical ? 
  how much of the breakfast you had this morning came about as a product of terrible animal suffering ? 
  just because you 're a few steps removed from it does n't erase the fact . 
  `` but eryemil , '' you say , `` i really * like * cheese/bacon/milk !, 
  i 've been eating it all my life -- i know i do n't actually * need * to eat it but not having them would make me * sad * . '', 
  in other words , eat your sausages and shut the fuck up about how others choose to derive pleasure from animal suffering .

   feel free to show me evidence of the long term harm of spanking on children . 
  [ the wikipedia article offers a pretty comprehensive summary of the current consensus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corporal_punishment_in_the_home#effects_of_parental_corporal_punishment ) keep in mind that the * best * thing that can be said about spanking is that it results in higher rates of immediate compliance at the expense of long-term compliance and even authorities that are neutral in regard to open-hand spanking are against any other form of harsher corporal punishment . 
  harm does not have to have long-term consequences . 
  pain , alone , constitutes harm . 
  but there is plenty of evidence of the negative impact physical abuse on children . 
  unless you deny that inflicted suffering constitutes harm , you have no argument here . 
  and if you do , i some citations . 
   if you mean the incidence of orgasm in women i very much doubt that there is accurate information one way or another , but i would add that although orgasm is nice it ranks waaaaaay below the positives i mentioned in my schema . 
  in the face of no evidence , the default position should be to * not * go ahead and say that amputation of the clitoris should be allowed . 
  that said , there * is * evidence of how circumcision affects sexuality . 
  more importantly however , it is * you * who believes that sexual satisfaction is not important . 
  that 's a far from from believing that your specific standards should be forcefully applied to children before they have a chance to make up their mind . 
   consent does not strike me as being anything like as relevant as the incidence of regret . 
  would you say the same for sexual activity or do you accept that the age at which children are subjected to such things influences how they 're likely to feel about them as adults ? 
  also , at what point does it become wrong for a parent to harm their children ? 
  was it wrong for my grandfather to beat my dad with a garden hose ? 
   the loss of some flesh which does n't really do that much and which the remaining flesh extending under the surface substitutes adequately for i would like proof that clitoridectomy does not reduce sexual function . 
   temporary pain that the participants do not regret after the fact my father does not regret being beaten with a garden hose , in fact he vehemently defends it . 
  we 're not talking about harm being inflicted upon consenting adults , but malleable children .
