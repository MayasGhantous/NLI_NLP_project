there was a poll recently that more or less asked this question , among other things : percentage of separatists and unionists by birthplace of their parents : both in catalonia : 75 % - 23 % one in catalonia and one outside : 60 % - 35 % both outside of catalonia : 23 % - 75 % it was made by el peri\u00f3dico for the upcoming elections . 
  that 's because of the dictatorship . 
  my father 's native language is catalan but he 's almost illiterate in it because he was never taught how to write it when he was a child . 
  also , a huge part of that 34 % must be from the people who migrated in the 60s and 70s , so i expect it to decrease with time . 
  you need 2/3 of the seats in both the congress and the senate for that , so pp will always hold a blocking minority . 
   what international law the un seems pretty concerned about [ these ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2015/07/23/actualidad/1437652718_820553.html ) . 
  also , all the crap they routinely pull regarding gibraltar . 
   fundamental law [ gag law ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2015/05/20/actualidad/1432114191_278013.html ) , anyone ? 
   judicial/constitutional sentence at least [ these ] ( http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/4208945/20140902/govern-espanyol-incompleix-sistematicament-sentencies-tc-catalunya.html ) and [ these ] ( http://www.elpuntavui.cat/ma/article/3-politica/17-politica/645838-el-govern-espanyol-no-acata-el-tc.html ) , and that 's just the ones in favour of the generalitat . 
   european obligation [ these ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/scoreboard/performance_by_member_state/spain/index_en.htm#maincontentsec2 ) are just the ones against eu single market laws . 
  also , check [ this ] ( http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/2071993/0/espana-ue-ce/infracciones-infractores/expedientes-sanciones/ ) out . 
  by the way , one of the reasons i 'm in favour of independence is because i want a more direct and radical democratic system . 
   catalonia is one of the worst regional administrations in spain and in the eu according to the ec that 's not what that study said , at all . 
  it polled people 's perceptions about government quality at a regional level . 
  it was mostly about whether people felt basic public services were provided well and fairly in their region , not about how they felt about the regional governments themselves . 
  and it was all based on opinion , not objective data . 
  what that map shows is that catalonia is spain 's most dissatisfied region . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://salaimartin.com/randomthoughts/item/755-corrupci\u00f3n-en-catalunya-respuesta-a-luis-garicano.html ) a more in depth analysis . 
  now read it and stop spreading misinformation . 
   that 's why we are the most decentralized country in the world no , we are not . 
  the central government can over-rule the communities ' competences whenever they feel like , and the fact that ( most of them ) do n't raise almost any of their own taxes means they ca n't implement their policies like they 'd want to , and that they can be controlled indirectly through their budget , which is decided in madrid . 
  and even if we were , so what ? 
  some of us feel it 's still not enough . 
   so , if pp has a majority of seats in the national parliament ( as they already have ) , the `` have right do whatever they want '' . 
  there no rule of law , huh ? 
  as if this was n't exactly what 's happened during the last four years . 
   the generalitat could have changed their name or created a new police force in case the term generalitat does n't make it clear enough , in catalonia we prefer restoring and modernising old institutions instead of creating new ones . 
  i 'm sure whoever came up with that sometent gave it that name to make it more agreeable with the populace . 
  and that 's all there is to it , nowadays in catalonia the name only reminds people of the citizen militias of old . 
  because the esquadres already existed as a civilian police force , like they ~ ~ uninterruptdly ~ ~ have in one way or another since the borbonic restoration . 
  yes , even during primo de rivera 's time , during which they acted as a political police too . 
  the generalitat just took their control in the 30s . 
  edit : almost uninterruptedly : they were disbanded from 1939 to 1951 . 
  the only people who 've ever called me a charnego have been either from outside of catalonia or unionists of spanish ancestry , the latter usually adding the adjective * agradecido * ( grateful ) , as if those of us descended from people from the rest of spain who support catalan independence were some kind of uncles tom . 
   there 's a good reason why , after 1978 , the reestablished catalan generalitat chose for its police force the name `` mossos d'esquadra '' , rather than the tainted `` sometent '' like , i do n't know , the fact that they were called like that during the republic too ? 
  nah , it ca n't possibly be that . 
  did you * really * have to close down the silk road , though ? 
  and his/her point is that `` someone who looks from europe '' means a very broad range of looks , and that it gets pretty blurry at the edges of the continent because it includes populations with significant non-european ancestry . 
  let 's take a look at [ this ] ( http://9gag.com/gag/arqjv6q/the-average-women-faces-in-different-countries ) : does the average woman from a mediterranian european country look closer to the nordic ones or to those from other mediterranian countries from outside of europe ? 
  and that 's the average , then you have to take into account the variation inside those countries . 
  is he only doing the pitch or will he also write for the series ? 
  really ? 
  it 's literally the first thing i thought when i tried it . 
  now i wonder what peanut butter hummus would taste like !, 
  and sorry if i was too harsh before , it 's just that americans hype it a lot and i was disappointed . 
  i bought some once , and i did n't like it much . 
  it tasted bland , it got stuck between my teeth and on the roof of my mouth , and it 's got too many calories . 
  personally , i prefer tahini . 
  the two-party system wo n't change until we get a new electoral law ; it 's like that by design . 
  currently , the only thing we can change is which two parties benefit from it in each province , especially in the least populated ones . 
  ah , they bypass their defense-only limitations by calling them escort ships and restricting them to carrying anti-submarine helicopters . 
  that 's clever . 
   because they would n't be very useful if china or nk attacked , which is pretty much all they 're concerned with . 
  i 'm sorry , i 'm very ignorant about these things . 
  does that mean they would only be expecting an nk attack by land ? 
  is the japanese navy even allowed to have one of these ? 
  and why does n't south korea have any use for them ? 
  that includes a ~ ~ 50 ~ ~ 35 year maintenance concession contract . 
  the real construction cost is about ~ ~ 6.5 ~ ~ 7 billion $ , which is still pretty bad , and the way the line is designed is completely retarded , but you can blame psc for those . 
  edit : i got some figures wrong . 
  source [ here ] ( http://www.elcritic.cat/investigacio/el-nyap-de-la-linia-9-del-metro-costos-per-triplicat-estacions-privatizades-i-anys-de-retard-4394 ), 
  right , sorry if i was n't clear before . 
  i mean that i do n't know where he is getting his data . 
  but he 's a professor at iese , so he 's definitely knowledgeable about the catalan economy . 
  i do n't think it 's a good idea . 
  i like the graphic novels , but their aesthetics are too outdated and the tone is a bit too whimsical for modern audiences , so we 'll either get a bad adaptation or a new john carter , that nobody will go to watch . 
  i imagine they would n't transfer the profits , just the money they borrowed . 
  in general , i do n't think it would be a particularly convenient arrangement , to be honest . 
  and regarding the problem of interbank interest , i honestly ca n't answer to that , i 'm not an economist , i 'm just telling you a suggestion made by one . 
  i assume he knows he to make it work without the problems you mentioned , otherwise he would n't have proposed it . 
   i hate it , because it presents the institutions as a monolith , when actually there are a myriad different interests pulling in different directions , and the institutions are not even all based in brussels . 
  i apologise if it bothered you , it was n't my intention . 
  and yes , one should always assume that journalists are lazy bastards . 
   these practical matters are usually swept under the carpet by the pro-independence side believe me , i 'm the first person to be annoyed by that . 
  and it 's not like the people who are arranging the whole thing do , if you listen to pro-independence economists they will talk about unfavourable scenarios when asked . 
  it 's just that on the internet some people from one side will parrot the worst case scenario while the other will do the same with the best one . 
   without joining , catalonia could continue to use euros , but without a central bank within the eurosystem issuing them . 
  this would have serious consequences in monetary and fiscal policy . 
  well , the catalan government would have to keep taking credit denominated in euros and the euro would be the official currency , so monetary policy would be taken care of ; we just would n't have any say in it , which is n't much different from the current situation , to be honest . 
  the real issue would be the interest banks and the general public would have to pay for liquid and credit in the secondary market . 
  sala-mart\u00edn has pointed out that catalan banks could use their spanish and european branches to procure the money at ecb rates and then syphon it off to catalonia , which is apparently a method american banks use when they need to borrow euros . 
  a solution could be a temporary bilateral agreement until catalonia met the criteria , but again that would depend on political will and circumstances . 
  brussels is a very common shorthand for referring to eu institutions , i do n't see what 's wrong with that . 
   if a republic of catalonia comes into being , it will have to apply for accession , just like any other independent state , before it can sign and ratify the treaties . 
  whether the negociations are even started will depend on the european council , of which the spanish prime minister is a member . 
  oh , i 'm aware of that . 
  i 'm not even talking about accession negotiations in that paragraph , but about recognition and distribution of assets and debts . 
  i think that 's also when the spanish position on international organisations would be negotiated , whether it 's not using their veto power for catalan entrance to the eu or other arrangements that would allow both parties to save face , like veto but acceptance in the eea+s hengen . 
  no , they are using 2010 data , follow the links . 
  i also ca n't find their statistical sources . 
  nope , spain has been the destination of less than half of catalonia 's exports [ for a while now ] ( http://www.ara.cat/premium/economia/exportacions-redueixen-dependencia-lestancament-tendencia_0_1140486070.html ) , and those are roughly equal to our internal consumption . 
  also , a lot of it are n't finished goods , but base materials to be used in the industries of other regions , primarily aragon and valencia , and then madrid and the basque country . 
  [ see this map for reference ] ( http://blocs.mesvilaweb.cat/wp-content/uploads/sites/1339/2014/12/exportacions.jpg ) , although it 's quite out of date . 
  edit : here 's an [ infographic ] ( http://coneixement.accio.gencat.cat/image/image_gallery?uuid=9acd4586-b780-4e4a-896f-01e9f0ba4781&amp;groupid=30582&amp;t=1348829388065 ) about the destination of catalan exports ( source [ here ] ( http://coneixement.accio.gencat.cat/web/portal/eines/-/custom_publisher/6ugo/28012363/infografia-de-les-exportacions-catalanes ) , it 's from 2012 , so still out of date ) , and [ here 's an article ] ( http://www.joserodriguez.info/bloc/pequena-foto-sobre-las-exportaciones-de-catalunya-en-el-2014/ ) with the most recent data . 
  let 's be honest , that 's unknown and it will depend on political factors . 
  in fact , i expect that the first reaction from brussels will be to say that we ca n't or most likely not to recognise us . 
  whether they later force both parts to sit on the negotiating table will depend on the outcome of the first weeks or even months . 
  what spain ca n't take away from us is our spanish nationality without previously recognising independence , and that still gives us right to the european one . 
   people will blindly follow that bullshit after being radicalized thanks for the dehumanisation  people really believes that once they are free from the reigns of spain , there will be no corruption and that everyone in catalu\u00f1a is free of sin no , what we believe is that after independence we 'll have to set up a new justice and tax system from scratch . 
  and then , after analysing the shortcomings of the current ones , comparing them with those of other countries , and a ton of pressure from civic organisations we * might * get ones that reduce the amount of corruption that is currently present in our society .
