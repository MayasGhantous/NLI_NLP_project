  good point about the army , i bet that if we put it to vote , catalans would vote against having any kind of armed forces , much less entering nato . 
  yes , the independence-only camp amounts to about 30 % of the population . 
  it 's thanks to the people who wanted a federation with spain or just more autonomy within it , but that began to consider it impossible after the constitutional court slashed our autonomy statute and pp rose to power , that independence has a shot at achieving a majority . 
  that also means that support for it has diminished now that podemos might win the upcoming general election , since they 've promised social reforms and turning spain into a federal country . 
  i expect it to increase again if pp manages to win , and to drop if podemos does . 
  yes . 
  mostly it 's about setting up parallel state structures ( tax agency , social security ... ) and then asking the spanish government to negotiate a transfer of assets and debts . 
  i do n't see them getting less than 70 seats ( majority is 68 ) , and they might even reach 80 . 
  it basically depends on how poorly csqep does . 
  and if we add them , that 's more than 2/3 in favour of catalan sovereignty on the matter . 
  you can find a summary of the parties running for the election [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3f1u3r/say_i_am_a_new_voter_in_your_country_and_i_have/ctksmed ) . 
   above ground level at times . 
  what 's up with that ? 
  from what i 've read , the problem is that every time they dig a tunnel they keep finding archaeological rests , so construction has to be paralysed until they unearth them , which makes the whole process * really * slow and expensive . 
  more or less like any other spaniard that is n't a hardcore pp voter , even though an alarming amount of people are more indifferent to it than i would like . 
  none of the catalan parties voted in favour , but the law is even a bit more aggravating to us because it includes a clause that would allow the central government to seize control of our police forces [ in case of a defiance to the state ] ( http://www.regio7.cat/arreu-catalunya-espanya-mon/2015/05/23/nova-llei-estatal-seguretat-permetra/314931.html ) , if you know what i mean . 
  a cruise ? 
  most that leave from barcelona have a stop there . 
  my mother says it reminds her of barcelona in the 70 's , before the city cleaned up for the olympics . 
  i do n't think i 've ever had dinner before 21 h , it 's usually closer to 22 and sometimes even later, 
  because the electoral college has n't got any legislative power , therefore the head of state and government is not appointed by the legislative power , therefore it 's not a parliamentary system , therefore it 's a presidential one . 
  technically speaking he is n't even elected by congress , they just ratify a nomination by the king . 
  oh man , i totally missed that last kingly election !, 
  i got sunburnt * in ireland * . 
  bottom line : never trust a poll that does n't include the `` intenci\u00f3n de voto directa '' and a `` ficha t\u00e9cnica '' that details the number of interviewed people , the selection criteria and the confidence interval . 
  that 's why i find metroscopia 's to be the most reliable , even if they skew a bit towards psoe when they `` cook '' the data . 
  gesop are amazing , they even let you download the raw data so you can cook it yourself , but they only work in catalonia . 
  they thought that it would be a short recession , so they designed a plan to keep construction companies afloat doing odd jobs without , like you said , any long-term positive economic impact . 
  so it all blew up in their faces once the money had run out and the economy had n't improved . 
  that does n't mean that keynesian policies would n't have worked , though . 
  [ at that point the spanish public debt only represented 30 % of our gdp ] ( http://ep00.epimg.net/economia/imagenes/2014/02/17/actualidad/1392627220_817904_1392654684_noticia_normal.png ) , so the government could afford to indebt itself , but they could have been much cleverer about it , doing things like that public credit system i mentioned or building necessary infrastructure like [ the mediterranean freight railway ] ( http://www.diariosur.es/noticias/201110/19/media/corredor-medtierraneook.jpg ) , which we now have to build anyway and which would have a very positive effect to both the industrial mediterranean region and the south , [ which has suffered the most the effects of the crisis ] ( http://s.libertaddigital.com/fotos/noticias/tasa-paro-300414.jpg ) . 
  and thanks , let 's hope we do !, 
  oh , i do n't include sigma dos polls for that reason . 
  if you do a bit of digging , you 'll find that it 's actually a shell corporation . 
  [ here 's some info about it ] ( https://storify.com/blaqll/sigma-2 ) , it 's in catalan , so i 'm afraid you 'll have to run it through a translator . 
  the links are in spanish , though . 
   while the first one showed growth , we can easily relate it to tourism that and an increase in the export-driven industry , but you are right , there is n't an economic activity yet that can employ the majority of the millions of people that were left without a job when the construction bubble burst , so the structural problems persist , especially those that affect the capability of the productive sectors to expand ( e.g. 
  the high cost of electricity , which makes our exports less competitive ) . 
   their problem was a lack of ` cash liquidity ' and that 's the biggest issue . 
  before the crisis a lot of companies relied heavily on credit to operate ( as a relative of mine puts it `` we were basically trading ious '' ) , so when it started and banks stopped giving credit they found themselves without enough liquidity to pay the bills , much less return said credits , so they had to close down . 
  now that the banks have stopped licking their wounds and credit is ( slowly ) flowing again , we are starting to grow . 
  what pisses me off is that if the psoe government had created a stronger public credit system instead of burning 50 bn $ fixing pavements ( look up plan e ) we would n't have taken such a strong hit to begin with ( not that pp has been any better ) . 
  nah , hanlon 's razor all the way . 
  according to the most recent polls , that is sadly not true : * [ metroscopia for el pa\u00eds ] ( http://electomania.es/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1437765094_076190_1437834137_noticia_normal.png ) * [ simple-l\u00f3gica ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ckgply7w8aaqkvk.jpg:large ) * [ encuestamos ] ( http://electomania.es/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/encuestamosjulio15-2.png ) * [ gad3 for abc ] ( http://www.abc.es/media/201507/19/evolucion-intencion-voto--644x624--478x460.jpg ), 
  in catalan : * l = [ dark l ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alveolar_lateral_approximant#velarized_alveolar_lateral_approximant ) * ll = [ alveolo-palatal lateral approximant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palatal_lateral_approximant ) * l \u00b7 l = [ geminated dark l ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gemination#catalan ) so the interpunct is used to tell apart those two different sounds . 
  catalan has a few other geminated consonants ( mm , nn , tll = geminated ll ... ) it 's a feature of latin that most of the other romance languages have shed . 
  to add to your comment , dc is a pro-independence split of udc , and mes is the same for the psc . 
  well , they were never officially pro-independence to begin with : the party 's ranks were split on the issue between the rural areas , where their voters and members leaned yes , and the urban areas , where they have been most successful and their voters and members clearly lean no . 
  in the end , the urban members took control of the party and expelled its founder , and a lot of the rural local associations left too . 
  so nowadays they are markedly spanish nationalist and anti-independence . 
  regarding the upcoming elections , i do n't think they are going to run in them , and if they do , they wo n't find much success , since the pp 's candidate is the former mayor of badalona , who is just as anti-immigration as them ( [ he even distributed leaflets with xenophobic messages ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/catalunyaplural/absuelto-garcia-albiol-panfletos-xenofobos_0_206129678.html ) ) and is much more popular ( heh ) , so their voter base is taken . 
  it 's been like this for at least six years . 
  since a few years ago we also cover the xvith and xviith centuries in secondary and the xviiith in high school , and world history ends with the fall of the eastern bloc . 
  all are very valid concerns , to be honest . 
  i can totally understand those who think there are too many uncertainties . 
  unlike in scotland , whose independence process was clearly the snp 's vision , ours suffers from having too many cooks , so to speak , which means a lack of clarity on what a future catalonia would look like , because the three parties would never find a consensus on that . 
  i think erc and cup would be much more comfortable with csqep and even the psc on these matters . 
  regarding the military , i 'd say the draft would be unthinkable for almost everyone , considering the historical opposition to the mili . 
  i think the two main points of dissent are whether to have a military in the first place instead of a very small civilian defence force like in iceland , and whether we should be part of nato . 
  in my opinion , the outcome will be the result of international and domestic pressures , although in general , my perception is that militarism has an extremely bad image . 
  about the currency , what i 've been able to gather from people who are much more knowledgeable on these matters than i am is that a system is being set up to ensure we are able to keep using the euro during the transition period even in the event that we end up officially outside the eurozone , but i do n't know the details . 
  the same with the central bank , customs , the tax and social security administrations ... work in these `` non-partisan '' agencies has been able to progress much further . 
  you do realise you are always talking in hypotheticals and picking the worst-case scenario , do n't you ? 
  like i said , if worst comes to worst , in an independent catalonia we 'd have the same amount of people being as corrupt as they are now , but at least i 'd be affected be fewer of them , so it 's still a net gain . 
  as for your post , of course whatever the successor of converg\u00e8ncia is will always have a place in catalan politics , there will always be right wing people . 
  and again , you assume pre-independence and post-independence political dynamics would be the same , after independence the other parties would lose their incentive to tolerate pdc 's bullshit , no matter how the press that is close to them ( which is becoming less and less relevant ) spins it . 
  cup will never have less than 5 seats and erc is likely to become the dominant party , like the last spanish elections have shown . 
  also , plenty is being done to increase transparency already . 
  for example , the current government has decided to [ remove public funding to political parties ' foundations ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/cataluna/2016/09/05/57cc5840e2704ed8448b4619.html ) . 
  going to your example of tolls , it 's clear they were a consequence of the debt ciu had incurred with la caixa , which is connected to abertis , and that they paid back in the form of political favours . 
  well , under its new charter pdc must control its debt , so that will be less likely to happen in the future . 
  [ erc is close to reducing its debt to 0 and cup never had it to begin with ] ( http://www.directe.cat/imatges/noticies/greafic-deute-partits-politics-2013.png ) . 
  well , first of all , you 're assuming that the three parties would design the judiciary together . 
  that 's a matter left for after independence , so constituent elections would have been held and then it 's every man for himself . 
  they barely tolerate working together as it is . 
  so i do n't see what erc and especially cup would gain from keeping quiet about pdc 's alleged eventual attempts at rigging the system , considering much of their political prestige comes from their fight against corruption ( remember david fern\u00e1ndez presiding the anti-corruption commission ) . 
  add csqep and c 's to the mix plus other non-partisan entities watching the process from the outside and i think there would be enough pressure to keep pdc , who would probably be a minority in parliament anyway , in check . 
  if the different peoples of spain united voluntarily they should be able to separately voluntarily , do n't you think ? 
  if we are so hateful and offensive , what do you gain from keeping us with you ? 
  is n't leaving better for everyone 's peace of mind ? 
  first of all , we were never part of france ( except that one time in 1812 ) . 
  the [ treaty of p\u00e9ronne ] ( ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/trait%c3%a9_de_p%c3%a9ronne_ ( 19_septembre_1641 ) ) made it clear it was a personal union and that count louis had to respect our self-government . 
  and the generalitat was a commission formed by members of the catalan parliament ( call it corts if you prefer , what matters is that it was catalonia 's legislative organ ) created to wield executive power between its sessions and make sure catalonia 's constitutions were respected . 
  and its decisions were later ratified by the junta de bra\u00e7os ( our estates-general ) , so they had all the necessary legitimacy . 
  why do you people always get so hung up on the kingdom/principality thing ? 
  catalonia was a principality , the territory under the jurisdiction of the corts formed after the unification of the many catalan counties , whose sovereign was the count of barcelona . 
  newsflash , medieval and modern states came in many designations , and not being a kingdom does n't make you lesser . 
  the catalan parliament literally declared the catalan republic , and later gave the crown to louis xiii ( as llu\u00eds i de barcelona ) . 
  it does n't get more war-of-independencish than that , it was as real as portugal 's at the same time , but the crown only had the resources to crush one of the two . 
  sorry , i did n't mean to offend , i just wanted to compare and contrast . 
  the bourbon dynasty tried to fashion spain after france , after all . 
  i 've edited the post . 
  i 'd say yes . 
  catalan regionalism/nationalism began as a cultural movement in the mid xix century , started asking for autonomy around the 1890s , which it achieved in the 1910s until primo de rivera 's dictatorship , with the republic in the 1930s until franco 's , and from the transition in 1975 onwards . 
  the same is true for other peoples like the basques , the galicians , the andalusians ... 
  so why did n't end up like a more centralised country like france ? 
  i 'd say it 's because these areas were economically and culturally strong on their own , so the local elites did n't need to assimilate into the capital 's . 
  madrid never had paris ' pull . 
  the spanish government also failed to implement a state-wide education programme until franco 's dictatorship , and by that point catalan already had been standardised and had enjoyed a decades of literary production and years of public teaching . 
  edit : of course , all of this is after the creation of the modern spanish state , before that spain was a collection of kingdoms with their own parliaments , laws and charters that the king had to swear to respect etc.
