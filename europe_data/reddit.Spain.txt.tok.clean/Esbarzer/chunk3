  for the record , there is an after plan , a [ white paper ] ( http://presidencia.gencat.cat/ca/ambits_d_actuacio/consells-assessors/consell_assessor_per_a_la_transicio_nacional_catn/informes_publicats/ ) like the one the scottish government wrote . 
  many think tanks have also written their own papers on different subjects like the economics of an independent catalonia , its international relations , defence etc. 
  and even constitutional proposals . 
  that was a different demonstration , organised by far-left parties which are indeed anti-eu, 
  fun fact , you can visit the ruins of the house of the dutch ambassador to catalonia during the succession war . 
  he was a distiller , if i remember correctly . 
  i just quoted daktush verbatim and then changed the parties , so clearly it 's someone else who 's doing the bullshit eating , and either you did n't read his/her post or you have a terrible short-term memory . 
  point by point : * [ unionism is mainly supported by stay-at-home people , pensioners and the unemployed ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jco5ewj.jpg ) * there are precious few taxes that are managed by the generalitat , one of them is a percentage in direct taxes that while [ it is among the highest in spain for high earners ] ( http://e02-expansion.uecdn.es/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2016/02/23/14562622492485.jpg ) , [ the differences between what you pay in direct taxes in the different communities are marginal unless you have an extremely high income ] ( http://cincodias.com/cincodias/imagenes/2014/11/14/economia/1415968654_402666_1416246833_noticia_grande.jpg ) . 
  the rest can only be taxes on things the spanish government does n't tax already , [ which it has tried to boycott in the past ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/cataluna/2015/06/01/556c86aeca4741557a8b4591.html ) . 
  that means that like all other communities ( except the basque country and navarre ) it depends on the money it receives from madrid , which is completely insufficient , resulting in a deficit . 
  [ but the borrowed money mostly goes to healthcare and education ] ( https://sergicastanye.com/2014/01/04/de-donde-viene-la-deuda-de-la-generalitat-del-derroche/ ) , not to propaganda . 
  * foreign investment [ was almost at an all-time high last year , after a bit of a slump in 2014 ] ( http://images.ara.cat/2015/12/21/societat/inversio-estrangera_1489661324_4203031_987x555.jpg ) . 
  * no one chants for independence and socialism except the communists of the cup , erc is centre-left and pdc is centre-right . 
  the spanish government has n't bailed anyone out , it acts as a lender of last resort for the communities , taking a handsome cut in the process when it could simply give them bigger budgets . 
  if madrid is fine with that then good for them , i do n't want to impose my views on the rest of spain unlike the other way around . 
  regarding corruption , erc and cup are spotless , cdc has been forced to recognise it and has had to refound itself into pdc , and i remind you that [ the minister of the interior has conspired to fabricate false cases against pro-independence politicians ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/22/spanish-minister-accused-of-conspiring-against-political-rivals ) . 
  * we 're already paying for those institutions , that 7 % would be an extra , and plenty of countries that are of equal size or much smaller than us manage to just fine . 
  * first of all , [ exports to spain have been decreasing for decades now ] ( http://images.ara.cat/2016/04/18/economia/catalunya-exporta-lestranger-que-espanya_1561054094_28519185_987x427.jpg ) . 
  also , aragon is a cherry-picked example , our spanish exports are concentrated in a few communities whereas the global market is much more spread out . 
  finally , you omitted that [ our internal market is almost as big as the spanish ] ( https://sergcastanye.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/sa.jpg ) , and can adjust easily to a tariff with spain ( it 's not like aragon does n't export heavily to catalonia too , surely they would also take a hit ) . 
  * like they did with the baltics , or the former yugoslav countries . 
  * firstly , your views are not very representative even of catalan unionists themselves . 
  even most of those who want to remain in spain want more autonomy or federalism . 
  secondly , self-government without self-funding is worthless , it means you are allowed to do as much as the central government lets you , instead of as much as you are capable of . 
  it 's like saying a teenager is independent because their parents give them an allowance , while living in their house and having to obey their rules . 
  not to mention there have been plenty of threats to revoke our autonomy if we try anything funny . 
  * your spiel on education merits a different paragraph . 
  to begin with , it was spanish-speaking parents who asked for the system of immersion in catalan , supported by the communist psuc , while catalan nationalists wanted a system of multiple lines like in the basque country . 
  more importantly , it has extreme social and parliamentary support , with [ only 113 families ] ( http://cat.elpais.com/cat/2016/09/01/catalunya/1472726417_392529.html ) ( out of 1.5 million children ) wishing to be educated in spanish last year . 
  and about spanish-speaking children doing worse , [ pisa test results ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u2bzd6e.jpg ) show that when adjusted for socioeconomic level , the difference in performance is of [ less than 5 % ] ( http://i.imgur.com/crpzzrv.jpg ) , it 's just that proportionally spanish-speakers come from poorer backgrounds . 
  edit : and the [ dropout rate is almost the same as the spanish mean ] ( http://ultimahora.es/sfattachplugin/getcachedcontent/id/227781 ) , while we have the best universities in spain . 
  * i had already covered corruption but i 'll say this : in spain we have to suffer both corrupt spanish and catalan politicians , whereas in an independent catalonia at least we 'd only have to deal with the latter . 
  you should also consider that since we would have to build a new justice system , we can take into account the shortcomings of the current one to build a better one . 
  * `` ask any unionist what they think about pdc or erc , they will say `` nazis '' without pointing at any of their policies '' . 
  and here 's an article [ trying to link them to isis ] ( http://www.larazon.es/espana/islamistas-vinculados-a-los-nous-catalans-de-mas-y-junqueras-se-unen-al-isis-de11263808#.ttt1hqdfxbuo7o8 ) . 
  the shit-flinging goes both ways , and we also have to take the stuff that comes from madrid 's press . 
  finally , while i ca n't speak for all the independence movement , i 'll say that i do n't hate spain and that all mainstream pro-independence parties want to make both catalan and spanish official in an independent catalonia . 
  and finally , if it `` makes your blood boil '' , i suggest you take a chill-pill and get used to it , because neither side is going anywhere any time soon , but in the long term [ demographics say you 're kinda screwed ] ( https://sergcastanye.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/suportindyedatorigeninteres.jpg?w=700 ) . 
  and the thing is , i hate it when the independence debate gets reduced to bean counting !, 
  i only answered to his reply to offer anyone else who 's reading a different viewpoint . 
  i 'm no economist , just a regular guy who tries to handle the excess of information we are all subjected to the best he can . 
  i did n't specifically look for the articles i 've linked , i just remembered reading them . 
  if that comes across as cherry-picking , there 's nothing i can do . 
  also , i 'm most definitely not a cdc voter , and i certainly remember how eager they were to make budget cuts back in 2011-2012 . 
  i have no doubt they 've been mixed in shady business and any hypothetical improvement with regards to corruption that happened in an independent catalonia would be despite them , not thanks to them . 
  that does n't mean i have to believe the smear campaign against them . 
  and you can be a european federalist and support a fiscal union while still thinking states should retain their taxation powers ( lol at him/her scouring through my old posts , though ) . 
  and here i was , hoping for a civilised debate !, 
  but what 's the point , i ask myself , if we separatists are either scum , ignorant or liars ? 
   and during the crisis there has been many times where due to the risk of default and the uncertainty of the payments of the spanish debt , spain payed more for that money than the interest of the fla sources , please . 
  also , your comment raises two questions : * why would we want to remain in a country with such `` a high risk of default and uncertainty '' ? 
  * how come the pp has created a system that is , according to you , so benevolent with the autonomous communities ? 
  because to me , it looks like it 's designed to throw underfunded communities into a debt spiral , instead of doing the obvious thing and increasing the amount of money they get back , reducing their fiscal deficit . 
  it 's the autonomous communities that provide the essential social services like healthcare and education , and yet they 're the ones that are making the biggest cuts instead of the state . 
   this is trash and sala i martin is scum for lying to his readers.that money wasnt `` spent in other communities '' it was spent in repaying debt . 
  again , sources please . 
  and in any case , so ? 
  it 's still a massive amount of money catalans ( will ) have to pay and does n't translate into goods and services for us . 
  let 's look at it historically , to take into account variations in debt and deficit : the numbers remain more or less the same . 
  http://www.expansion.com/2012/03/19/catalunya/1332157468.html http://www.lavanguardia.com/economia/20120312/54268051728/catalunya-mantuvo-2009-deficit-fiscal-con-estado-8-pib.html, 
  the problems with the data you 've linked in your huffpost article and that borrell uses to argue with junqueras is that it does n't take into account the debt that the spanish government gets into , and that it takes a very specific approach when calculating what benefits each autonomous community . 
  sala-mart\u00edn has some interesting articles about it : http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/09/20/opinion/1442765637_791961.html http://salaimartin.com/randomthoughts/item/711-encontramos-los-millones-de-borrell.html http://www.salaimartin.com/randomthoughts/item/766# ( this one 's in catalan ) also , i take issue with calling the fla a `` rescue '' . 
  it 's a loan that the generalitat will have to return , at a higher interest than the ones the spanish government takes , so in effect the spanish government is profiting from it . 
  i already know that , the problem was that these people either did n't or did n't believe her , so they voted for trump because he told them what they wanted to hear . 
  that 's only direct jobs , though ; it 's not just the coal miner but also the person who sells them groceries and the one who fixes their car . 
  the economies of entire regions depend on them as their primary source of income . 
  then why involve the generalitat at all ? 
  you specifically mention it in the title . 
  that 's been the angle in the articles that have been written against the app , so excuse me for jumping the gun there . 
   but to counter-denounce is akin to what trump does in america . 
  persist on your alternative facts . 
  says the guy whose post has been removed for editorialisation . 
  k.  when all i 'm doing is pointing out a racist , discrimination enabling app . 
  for the last time , the only ones that consider it that are you and the people with the agenda i wrote in my comment . 
  and yet you are surprised that i 've lumped you with them ? 
   instead we 're just arguing agendas and other irrelevant , ultra-localised issues that have neither relevance or interest for anyfuckingbody else well yeah , the european subreddit was n't the place for this discussion ; it was bound to devolve into this . 
   indirectly but fully advertently prove it . 
  prove that the generalitat was explicitly informed by the plataforma that it was making this app and that it gave them their explicit support . 
   better ? 
  not really , it 's still agenda-pushing with the objective to paint the catalan government as a tyrannical regime hell-bent on oppressing poor innocent spanish speakers . 
  as you can see in the thread , the few foreigners that have commented are flabbergasted by that idea . 
  even a french person agrees with us , and they 're not too hot on supporting regional languages !, 
  obviously they must have used some of the grant to finance it , but the point is that it 's * their * idea , not the government 's . 
  your title is factually inaccurate . 
  the generalitat only proposes the budget , parliament passes it . 
  as you can read in the document u/rockcs has linked , they have n't been given money to develop this app , it 's something they 've done of their own accord . 
  of course , that does n't include the 1.3 million people that live in cities and dormitory towns of the `` segona corona '' that have the same demographics as the amb , as well as other areas that also received a lot of immigration like the tarragona-reus or lleida metropolitan areas . 
  also , the latest immigration wave has spread more uniformly across the territory . 
  the 5 % that speak catalan but not spanish are even more in the minority . 
  the amb is full of retired people that came here in the 70s , that 's the demographic that speaks catalan the least . 
  when they kick the bucket you 'll see a huge increase in the knowledge of catalan . 
  if that 's discrimination then tripadvisor is also a discriminatory app . 
  of that 25 % , how many are already retired and how many are immigrants ? 
  again , taking the nitpickiest of cases does n't make you right . 
  i 'm sorry for the vast 50-year-old-native-spanish-speaker-working-12-hours-a-day-every-day-forever demographic but es lo que hay . 
   but you 're denying the other 10 % the right to open a business . 
  between older people this is even more true . 
  acquiring a basic conversational level in catalan is n't a herculean task for a native spanish speaker , much less one that already lives surrounded by it . 
  this is n't an insurmountable permanent setback , they can pick it up during the months it takes to set up a business . 
  there are free classes , there are language exchanges , they have all the tools at their disposal .
