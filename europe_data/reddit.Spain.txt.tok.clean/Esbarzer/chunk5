  promoting [ language secessionism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/language_secessionism ) is a common divide and conquer tactic to impose another language . 
  first you isolate the speakers in smaller groups and then you overwhelm them with your media because separate they are n't big enough to compete with your amount of cultural production . 
  at least finnish speakers were able to get broadcasts and reading materials from finland ? 
  there 's a difference between feeling separate and elitism , though . 
  i simply ca n't be `` spanish first '' , even as a descendant of immigrants from the rest of spain . 
  there 's a danger to the concept of `` the language that everyone speaks '' in a multilingual country . 
  it automatically becomes more prestigious than the others , simply because it forces the speakers of the other languages to code switch when theirs do n't have to . 
  unless a language is fully official in its territory , by which i mean that its knowledge must be compulsory , there will always be a part of the population that dismisses it as something unnecessary . 
  this will mean that all of its speakers will know the other one , but the same wo n't be true the other way around , which might create a diglossic situation that would lead to the severe minorisation and eventual extinction of the unprotected one . 
  i do n't want that to happen to catalan . 
  dude , how did we hurt you ? 
  i 'd hardly call a place with a 15 % unemployment rate rich . 
  we 're middling at best , but we think that independence would give us the tools to prosper . 
  i see patriotism as the sense of belonging to a state and nationalism as belonging to a nation . 
  you 're giving me an argument in favour of independence , then . 
  if there should only be an official de jure language that citizens use to address the state organs , it 's in my interest as a catalan speaker for catalonia to become its own country . 
  the uses for ser/estar are different between the two languages , though . 
   but `` fa '' translate to `` hacer '' quite easily . 
  sure , but `` hacer a\u00f1os '' does n't mean anything in spanish . 
   except there is the relatively reliable basis of dna there , and a whole host of physiological features as well , which is totally absent in linguistics . 
  ah , but languages also have their own dna and physiological features , in a way . 
  let 's take for example the catalan `` fer '' and the spanish `` hacer '' . 
  they both descend from `` facere '' , the present infinitive of the latin verb `` facio '' . 
  as centuries went by , they experienced mutations that have turned them into their current forms : in both cases the last letter was dropped , but in catalan 's case - ce - was dropped , just like it happened in other members of its language family ( see the french `` faire '' ) , whereas spanish introduced another phonetical innovation and lost the `` f '' sound at the start of the word . 
  since these changes are systematic across the language ( see `` fada '' vs. `` hada '' or `` ferro '' vs. `` hierro '' ) , we can use them to even reconstruct extinct languages like indo-european , just like taxonomists can reconstruct species . 
  why ? 
  should n't a multilingual country like spain actually recognise its diversity , and treat all of them equally regardless of their number of speakers ? 
  would you tell the same to the finland swedes ? 
  sorry , i did n't mean you implied it spacifically , just that it sometimes people do and it 's hard to tell . 
  you know , the whole `` indoctrinated at school '' thing . 
   it 's from a catalan newspaper . 
  complain to them . 
  i see it 's from the catalan edition of el peri\u00f3dico , which is machine translated from spanish ; that 's why you get those mistakes . 
  a lot of people have complained about it , actually . 
   linguistic taxonomy is n't a science . 
  it 's arbitrary , and you ca n't experiment on it . 
  same as the taxonomy of species , then . 
   its conclusions can only be used with great care , and certainly not to prove a political point . 
  tell that to those who argue that valencian is a different language . 
  literally everyone else in the thread is disagreeing with you . 
  you 're the one who 's closing their eyes to the obvious . 
  that 's incorrect . 
  hey guys , i think french is a dialect of spanish !, 
   i 'm not spanish , but after having been in contact with catalan a bit , i see it as just a slightly different orthography and some difference in frequent ( function ) words that have been left over/borrowed from other languages how do you know those words have been borrowed and are n't original to the language instead ? 
  like / u/gawyntrak says , our vocabulary is closer to italian than to spanish . 
  all romance languages are close to each other anyway . 
   and linguistic taxonomy is pretty nonsensical . 
  `` i do n't care about certain scientific disciplines , therefore their conclusions are worthless . '', 
  there 's `` years '' and `` years '' . 
  the implication usually is that this is a thing that 's been going on since pujol 's times . 
  plus , the worst years of the crisis were earlier than that , and you 're again saying 6 when it should be , at best , 2 and sporadically at that . 
  the reason was that ciu felt compelled to use harsher language so as not to lose votes to solidaritat , probably . 
  if you think we 're already out of the crisis , then i do n't know what to tell you . 
  support for independence has still grown since 2013 anyway , so that ca n't be a factor . 
  for the record , i have n't downvoted you . 
  in fact , i have you at +15 in res . 
  that 's outright francoist propaganda . 
  it ca n't have been `` years of bashing '' because the mainstream independence movement has only been a thing for 6 years at most . 
  the radical slogans were dropped as soon as they were called out on them , and rightly so . 
  that article is 3 and a half years old ; you wo n't find anything similar since . 
  ban ki-moon 's personal opinion is n't the un 's . 
  but if you check the ruling on kosovo 's declaration of independence , you 'll see that it permits independence for peoples that are n't allowed a road to it inside their current state . 
  pujol was called `` molt honorable '' because that 's the formal style of the president of the generalitat , former or incumbent . 
  if he 's convicted , it will be revoked . 
  on mas , i still have n't seen anything that connects him to his party 's corruption scandals , other that [ that fake report that was leaked just before an election , conveniently . 
  ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/politica/fantasma-fernandez-diaz-udef-pisa_0_529847945.html ) on puigdemont , giving a contract to a company that is accused of corruption for other matters is n't the same as you being corrupt . 
  i already know it , thank you very much . 
  in fact , you 'd be hard-pressed to find a catalan monolingual . 
  i still should have the right to be served by the state in my mother tongue , which according to the constitution should be `` specially protected '' . 
  what 's wrong with that ? 
  the catalan education system is in catalan , therefore the people who work in it should prove that they know it . 
  plus , you get your language certificate just by finishing high school here , hardly a high barrier of entry . 
  and it 's not like people are coming in droves from outside to work as public teachers in catalonia . 
  first of all , education is in catalan because spanish speakers demanded it so that their children are better integrated . 
  [ last year only 40 families asked for them to be taught in spanish . 
  ] ( http://cat.elpais.com/cat/2016/12/24/catalunya/1482595401_803678.html ) while catalan has a good standing in the education system , it is discriminated against in other spheres of public life . 
  for example , last year [ only 8 % of judicial rulings were written in catalan ] ( http://www.ara.cat/societat/us-catala-justicia-minims-historics_0_1597040450.html ) , and judges and prosecutors do n't have to learn it to work here , which puts catalan-speaking plaintiffs at a disadvantage . 
  in fact , i 've heard that lawyers advise their clients to present their cases in spanish to better their chances . 
  so logically , we pushed to correct this inequality , demanding that knowing catalan should be compulsory , just like spanish is , and we were kindly told to get lost by the constitutional tribunal . 
  i 'd call that discrimination , would n't you ? 
  the organisation that has called for this demonstration has links to spanish far right parties . 
  [ this article has a good summary ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ca&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fcotarelo.blogspot.com.es%2f2016%2f05%2fcara-al-sol-de-espana-y-ole.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) , but i 'll translate the most relevant parts : the scc emerges , according to borr\u00e0s , in order to amend the mistakes made earlier by other organisations that sought more or less the same ends but had failed : moviment c\u00edvic d'espanya i catalans , moviment c\u00edvic 12-o and somatemps , as well as federalistes d ` esquerres ( p. 33 ) , the latter , an attempt to build bridges with the left in favor of spanish . 
  in the idyllic moment of the vict\u00f2ria theater , scc 's network is made up of people from somatemps , catalans universals , puerta de brandeburgo , asociaci\u00f3n por la tolerancia , cr\u00f3nica global , universitaris de catalunya , impulso ciudadano , club delta , fem pinya , som catalunya-somos espa\u00f1a or manifesto among others ( page 75 ) . 
  most of those are extreme right-wing spanish websites ( and almost unipersonal , in the author 's ironic judgment ) . 
  add for a little more consistency , ec ( empresaris de catalunya ) and the centre lliure de l'art i la cultura ( clac ) , whose founding team includes such academics as francesc de carreras , f\u00e9lix ovejero , ignacio vidal-folch , manuel cruz , miriam tey , also a founding member of scc ( p. 88 ) , many of whom have expedited access to the pages of el pa\u00eds to expose their doctrine . 
  the joan bosc\u00e0 foundation and the catalonian electoral observatory ( p. 92 ) are added . 
  borr\u00e0s proves in a convincing way that all of the above makes scc a simple showcase to hide the connection of unionism with the far right . 
  almost bizarrely , borr\u00e0s discovers that scc 's president bosch is also f\u00e8lix de sant serni tav\u00e8rnoles , a fake profile that since 2012 has been insulting , threatening separatists and defending nazi-fascism on facebook ( page 97 ) . 
  at the same time , somatemps is an organisation of the most intransigent sectors of the catalan extreme right : the national socialist spanish party ( pens ) , fe , jons , and the link between the two organizations is josep ramon bosch , a son of a militant of fn and himself admirer of blas pi\u00f1ar ( p. 112 ) . 
  bosch has left plenty of criminal traces on the networks , comments on fb , threats , insults and various videos on youtube with his voice-over praising the waffen ss , etc. 
  the scc organized two acts in the street : a pro-spanish diada in tarragona , on september 11 , 2014 and a day of hispanidad in barcelona , on october 12 , 2014 : two failures with about 40,000 people between the two , although in tarragona there were psc and psoe people like carme chac\u00f3n and also right-wing people like albert rivera and alicia s\u00e1nchez camacho ( p. 135 ) . 
  nothing compared to the one and a half million that manifested in the independence day . 
  on october 12 , the scc took to the plaza de catalunya with the jons , syl , msr , somatemps , pxc , casal tramuntana , brotherhood of combatants of the blue division , brotherhood of former legionary knights of barcelona ( p. 139 ) . 
  together with these outdoor acts , another more recollected but with the same flavor of the extreme right : on september 15 , 2014 scc presents a book in barcelona , hotel atenea , nos duele catalu\u00f1a , published by editorial galland books , presented by bosch , among the assistants alberto fern\u00e1ndez d\u00edaz . 
  it should be noted that adolf galland , whose last name is used by the publisher , was a nazi commander of the condor legion ( page 143 ), 
  sorry , i did n't mean that you were implying that . 
  it was self-deprecating . 
  * insert corruption joke here *, 
  [ it 's a state where the interior minister can launch a covert smear campaign against separatist parties with the help of the friendly press and the prosecution ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/22/spanish-minister-accused-of-conspiring-against-political-rivals ) ( not saying there has n't been corruption in cdc , though ) .
