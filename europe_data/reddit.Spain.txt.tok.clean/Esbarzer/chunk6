  you talk so much about respecting the rule of law , what do you think of the state apparatus ' [ dirty tactics ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/22/spanish-minister-accused-of-conspiring-against-political-rivals ) ? 
  true , i 'm just saying . 
  and yet spain considers itself in its constitution a uninational , indissoluble state ; nothing 's changed since franco 's times in that regard . 
  it bases the entirety of its rule of law over its territory on this completely nationalistic principle . 
  is n't this mystical ? 
  should n't this be meaningless too ? 
  what happens when 80 % ^ of the population of one of its lands believe themselves to be a nation , should n't they consider themselves unbound by an arbitrary definition that they feel has been imposed on them , whose only privilege is being the status quo ? 
  ^ i ca n't find the specific poll , but that 's the percentage of catalans that believe it is . 
  that does n't necessarily make you a separatist , just in favour of self-determination . 
  also , the statute of catalonia that defined it as a nation was passed by our parliament with 90 % of the votes in favour , back in 2005 . 
  oh come on , we 've already had this conversation . 
  we 're perfectly happy with wealth redistribution within the eu . 
  it should be even higher than it currently is , in my opinion , as long as there 's proper oversight to make sure it 's invested productively . 
  wikipedia says they 're appointed by the consejo general del poder judicial , so it 's centralised . 
  apparently there was a provision in the statute of catalonia for our parliament to choose some of them , but it was slashed by the constitutional court until a reform of the ley org\u00e1nica del poder judicial allows it , so good luck with that . 
  true , but to be more precise we could say that there was a transition of pre-eminence from fascism to national-catholicism after ww2 , although both ideologies kept vying for power within the regime . 
  why are you using quotes ? 
  i 've never said that . 
  my point was that there 's little reason for an independent catalonia to employ former spanish civil servants . 
  would a personnel transfer even be possible ? 
   believing a single word that comes out of santiago vidal 's lips kek . 
  dude 's an attention whore . 
  bad example . 
  franco 's uprising was military , not political , and the country was ruled strictly by the principios del movimiento until they were completely violated by the ley de reforma pol\u00edtica . 
  but in any case this argument feels so disingenuous . 
  you 're effectively condemning us to stay in spain forever because you know the rest of spain and especially pp and psoe do n't want to let us vote and never will . 
  you 're forcing separatists to play a game that is stacked against us , is it any wonder that we want to break it ? 
  on the other hand , the legalistic position completely forgets about western sahara and equatorial guinea , which were administered like regular spanish provinces ( denying the colonial argument ) and yet were let go by francoist authorities without that much fuss . 
   this is the court that would be the supreme court in an independent catalonia said no-one in the independence movement . 
  why would we want to keep those judges anyway ? 
  they 're spanish civil servants . 
  you could use them , seeing [ how understaffed the spanish justice system is . 
  ] ( https://confilegal.com/20161007-espana-la-mitad-jueces-fiscales-la-media-europa/ ), 
  why ? 
  my problem is n't with fiscal transfers per se , they act as a necessary corrective measure to the inequalities between the different territories of customs and monetary unions . 
  the issue is that the spanish fiscal regime is a massive perverse incentive . 
  after 40 years all it 's done is make those inequalities chronic . 
  what plans have the governments of the southern regions got to reduce their structural unemployment from double digits , other than having an unsustainable amount of public employment and perennial spending in useless infrastructure ? 
  meanwhile , the countries of eastern europe have bounced back from the fall of communism in 25 years and are catching up . 
  they have their shit together . 
  why do we have to be more solidary with them than with poles or romanians ? 
  the latter objectively need it more . 
  also , the eu seems much more capable of managing fiscal transfers and actually using them to promote growth than the spanish government .

  do you really think what the consellera is saying is so unreasonable ? 
  if the generalitat thinks another administration ca n't keep track of minors under their care , are n't they allowed to complain when they end up shouldering the burden ? 
  the comments in the article seem to agree .

  regarding their intentions , i saw screencaps of the messages with my own eyes , but it was years ago and i ca n't find them . 
  it 's really sad that they have to send them , though , do n't you think ? 
  a dozen links later i 've got the name of its founder from an internal document of the main unionist group , which actively promotes it ; his blog , which requires a special kind of selective blindness not to be considered far-right , and fascist apologia by the former president of said group , which is beside the point but goes to show the kind of people it contains . 
  plus articles by a respected photo-journalist who , i must stress , has been threatened because of them , not with a libel lawsuit but physically . 
  i 'll let the facts speak for themselves .

  sweden is much more sovereign than almost all other countries in the eu . 
  you guys are n't even part of nato or the eurozone , so you are more `` really independent '' not only than a german state , but than germany itself . 
  you can also manage your taxes as you see fit and are able to implement whichever language and education policies you want without having another government tell you that you ca n't . 
  an autonomous community in spain does n't get that . 
  catalonia 's exports are doing fine . 
  actually , it 's been posited that in a context of free trade smaller countries perform better because their economies a more specialised . 
  sure , we have to trust that bigger countries wo n't try to pull out of the common market , but excessive protectionism only ends up resulting in higher prices and inferior quality goods . 
  back when there were tariffs catalan products were only competitive in spain , nowadays they can compete in the whole world and the destinations of our exports become more diverse every year . 
  yugoslavia 's disintegration was a shitshow , but 90 years after their independence ireland is one of the wealthiest countries in the world . 
  sure , like in all radical changes in the status quo there is a risk , but i prefer it to the certainties spain offers us . 
   small areas ca n't function efficiently regarding healthcare , trade , military matters and much more . 
  the administrative cost will increase as will the taxes .

   if the catalan local administration cared about its people it would use its energy to make ** catalan ** more efficient the name of the place is catalonia . 
  you clearly know what you 're talking about . 
   my grandfather was from zaragoza and grandmother was from barcelona ( she could speak catalan ) . 
  for them this was an non-issue and its the same for me . 
  i have dual citizenship ( spanish/swedish ) - i would never consider a catalan citizenship , i would never endorse this separatism as i consider it a narrowminded `` getto '' like mentality . 
  `` i do n't know anything about your country except how my grandparents felt about it , but let me educate you on how you all should feel '' . 
  you would n't have the right to a catalan nationality if you 've never set a foot here anyway . 
  to me they are almost indistinguishable , even though i 'm used to hearing both english and french , when according to wikipedia we use the same sound as polish in catalan .
