  ] ( http://www.abc.es/media/sociedad/2016/08/02/fracaso-escolar-espana--620x515.jpg ) note the correlation with [ unemployment ] ( http://www.abc.es/economia/graficos/mapa-epa-paro-enero-2016.jpg ) or a tourism-based , low value economy in the case of the balearic islands . 
  i ca n't explain la rioja , though . 
  i suppose that makes you europe 's settlers then , hunting bison to near extinction . 
  [ however , since atat\u00fcrk 's times there 's been an attempt to replace foreign loanwords with words of turkish origin . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_replaced_loanwords_in_turkish ), 
  indeed , basque is n't an indo-european language . 
  that 's quite distinctive . 
   portugal is a sovereign nation . 
  catalonia is a part of spain we 're working on that !, 
  it 's cool , man . 
  i 'm sorry if someone 's been rude to you , there 's no excuse for that . 
  i do n't think spanish tourists have a superiority complex , i guess most just do n't expect to find people who do n't identify with the spanish language and are vocal about it . 
  some people here can be a bit too zealous in their defence of catalan ; we 'll only keep it alive and healthy if stays useful and relevant in everyday life , and they mistake that for being forceful with people who have nothing to do with that . 
  [ you guys are in fact too polite . 
  i 've heard fellow spanish tourists speaking in spanish to a catalan and expecting not only to be understood but to be spoken back in spanish . 
  without making any effort to at least try to learn a couple of basic words in catalan . 
  of course there are rude tourists everywhere , but this particularly is something that takes the cake for me .

   the onion is ~ ~ optional ~ ~ essential ftfy, 
  can i have a source on there being a catalan textile industry to speak of in mid-xviith century , which is the time we 're talking about ? 
  the indiana factories would n't be a thing until 1738 . 
   that shit needed a shit-ton of money for the infraestructure , as it needed a lot of water . 
  the meseta was n't very suitable geographically , but catalonia was . 
  so much wealth invested and generated in return that would have been lost . 
  basically all of spain had their money invested in a single region , for the most part . 
  again , i 'm gon na need a source on that . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the banking institutions that made the raising of capitals for the catalan industrialisation possible , like the bank of barcelona or the catalan general society of credit , were created by locals . 
  also , [ here 's a list of all of catalonia 's industrial colonies ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/llista_de_col%c3%b2nies_t%c3%a8xtils_de_catalunya ) . 
  please , try to find one that was n't founded by catalans . 
   it 's funny when some independentists say that spain or `` madrid '' is just a leech , when historically we 've been actually fightning to death for catalan interests . 
  when we lost cuba we actually had an economic boom because the catalan bourgeoisie came back and we boomed like hell - they could n't have been in the colonies in the first place if the rulers did n't want to . 
  the loss of the cuban market was a relative hit , actually , just much smaller than expected . 
  the economic boom at the beginning of the xxth century is posterior and was the result of the other european countries having to import goods because they were fighting wwi , which in fact benefited factory owners but harmed the workers because of the resulting inflation . 
   catalonia is today what it is thanks to spain and spain is today what it is thanks , in part , to catalonia . 
  it 's been a mutual benefit . 
  see , the lack of an `` in part '' in your first phrase irks me . 
  a big part of catalonia 's modernisation should actually be attributed to foreigners who settled here and introduced new technologies in the fields of energy , transportation , etc. 
  in general , in your post there 's a clear subtext of catalans not being really able to do much by ourselves . 
  and that 's purely on the economic level ; culturally and politically , well ... 
  if that helps you sleep at night ... 
  in the case of binary questions you do n't have to ponderate the results , unlike in an election . 
  i wonder if the fact that it would be a close call between yes and no if all unionists actually went to vote will incentivise them to do it , and actually campaign for their option ; that would increase turnout by a lot . 
  there are plenty of undecided voters for both sides to convince . 
  we count those as single sounds , instead !, 
  also , at the beginning of the word we have a liaison , very similar to french , instead of gemination . 
  we geminate other consonants , it 's just that we already use ll to represent [ another sound ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/palatal_lateral_approximant ) , so we had to make up l \u00b7 l to tell the geminated l apart from it . 
  fun fact , that sound can itself be geminated ; we have to use - tll - to represent it , instead of - llll - . 
  may i ask about the reason for your tireless presence in every thread pertaining to our fair land ? 
  which is ridiculous . 
  all sociological data points to the average city-dwelling unionist being the opposite of progressive : they 're unemployed or retired and of low cultural and socioeconomic status . 
  their vote skews more right-wing than average . 
  they dream of a fractured catalonia , with the barcelona metropolitan area turned into a northern ireland of sorts . 
  how can you not realise that the same pedantic argument against saying president of catalonia '' can be used against saying `` president of spain '' when it 's `` president of the ** government ** of spain ? 
  how can you have so little self-awareness ? 
  you know the results in general elections are different than in regional ones and that there 's a lot of dual vote between erc and en com\u00fa podem , right ? 
  why are you always pushing the rural pro-independence vs. city unionist narrative ? 
  it 's a meme they keep repeating . 
  the area surrounding the city is unionist , but the city itself [ voted about the same as the whole of catalonia in the last elections ] ( http://eleccions.ara.cat/parlament-27s/resultats/municipi/8/19/99/9/barcelona ), 
  maybe it 's about that slanted eye incident back in the beijing olympics ? 
  also , it 's always seemed to me that chinese immigrants here , as a group , tend to be the target of casual racism . 
   well ask yourself this : would you remain spanish citizens enjoying spanish rights if you were to leave spain ? 
  that assumes that they would have recognised our independence , which would already be a significant step for us . 
  until then , they have to regard us as spanish citizens , otherwise it 's a de facto recognition . 
  [ the president of erc declaring that spanish will be official ] ( http://www.ara.cat/politica/oriol-junqueras-catalunya-independent-oficial_0_788321246.html ) pdcat has n't made any statements one way or another yet , but [ ciu said the same thing a few years ago . 
  ] ( http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/4051021/20121029/ciu-proposa-cooficialitat-castella-catala.html ) we have already had this discussion on the language of our education system . 
  first of all , [ last year only 40 families asked for their children to be educated in spanish ] ( http://cat.elpais.com/cat/2016/12/24/catalunya/1482595401_803678.html ) . 
  the population simply does n't want it , yet despite that , the supreme court ruled that 25 % of classes should be taught in spanish in all schools , when the generalitat says that they have no authority to do that and [ a 1994 sentence by the constitutional court already stated that as long as catalan students were competent in spanish when they finished their education , it was enough ] ( https://citafalsa.com/2016/01/23/catalan-castellano-escuela-y-tribunales-i-las-sentencias-del-tribunal-constitucional/ ) . 
  and about spanish-speaking children doing worse , [ pisa test results ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u2bzd6e.jpg ) show that when adjusted for socioeconomic level , the difference in performance is of [ less than 5 % ] ( http://i.imgur.com/crpzzrv.jpg ) , it 's just that proportionally spanish speakers come from poorer backgrounds . 
  if anything , we should be trying to close that 70 point gap between the low and high income families , which we could do if we could put more resources in the education system . 
  the current pro-independence government [ is trying ] ( http://www.diaridegirona.cat/catalunya/2017/01/25/acorden-incorporar-5500-mestres-curs/825743.html ) , but you unionists would rather have a hand tied to our backs inside spain , making do with the scrap the central government assigns us , instead of using our potential to the fullest . 
  but you 'd rather worry about muh spanish . 
  who are the real nationalists here ? 
  hey , / u/notacatalan , are you a sockpuppet account ? 
  pot , kettle , etc. 
  op is n't even catalan . 
  oh , spare us the melodrama.the biggest pro-independence parties have said that spanish will be co-official in an independent catalonia . 
  your obsession with a place you do n't even live in is what 's weird and disturbing . 
  you have an agenda , and it 's in the interest of the people who read your comments to know that . 
  can you show us that xenophobic root in the writings of valent\u00ed almirall , enric prat de la riba , etc. 
  please do n't project your moral bankruptcy on us , thanks . 
  so i skimmed the report from the article and the first thing i noticed is that the authors are nobodies : i 'd never heard about this teachers union before , their most relevant google search results are [ from 2006 ] ( http://usoc.es/?go=2c1af9f6decdaa443454898bffdcdab230d666e2868c7c0af93d46980deed237ed24c72b91d24129b187cf1efaa4370049a4727c135c6df62d806cb26f90a2ac ) and [ 2012 ] ( http://www.elpuntavui.cat/article/2-societat/5-societat/561322-la-reforma-educativa.html ) , and their facebook page has been dead for months . 
  it 's surprising how they 've managed to attract the attention of the right-wing spanish nationalist online press ( voz p\u00f3puli , libertad digital , cr\u00f3nica global ) , and only them . 
  now , onto the document itself . 
  the first thing to notice is the authors ' centralistic agenda : their self-admitted objective is for the central ministry of education `` to demand a permit for all books and didactic materials for use in education centres '' ( page 4 ) . 
  currently it 's the education inspectors of the autonomous communities who make sure that the books ' contents do n't include any factual errors . 
  before that they admit that there 's no proof of the catalan administration tampering with the books and that all mistakes are in good faith . 
  plus , there 's the fact that some of the publishers of these books are based in madrid . 
  they also describe the fact that they are written entirely in catalan as `` promoting a partidistic and exclusive vision of a country '' , never mind the fact that [ only 40 families demanded for their kids to be taught in spanish last year ] ( http://cat.elpais.com/cat/2016/12/24/catalunya/1482595401_803678.html ) . 
  regarding those `` mistakes '' , it 's clear that they come from a deeply spanish nationalist vision . 
  looking at the first book , it complains that history until the 15th century only talks about catalonia and the effect that has on the vision of spain as a nation , * ignoring that spain did not exist at the time * . 
  it also complains about such petty matters as using the catalan territorial model ( comarques ) instead of the spanish one ( provinces ) . 
  there are also factual mistakes like the classic one of deliberately confusing the [ crown of aragon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crown_of_aragon ) ( a personal union of multiple states ) with the [ kingdom of aragon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_aragon ) ( one of the states in the union ) . 
  although admittedly , referring to it as the `` catalan-aragonese '' crown is incorrect . 
  i gave up after the second book , since it was all the same petty complaints : more time is devoted to teaching kids about catalonia than the rest of spain , almost as if since they live here it 's more relevant to them , especially when the subject is called `` knowledge about the environment '' . 
  it 's evident that the authors ' complaints about catalan nationalism are nothing but an excuse to hide their desire for a more spanish nationalist bias . 
  in catalan it 's the same with `` erm '' . 
  the press reported [ these statements ] ( https://translate.google.cat/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ca&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.eldiario.es%2fpolitica%2fmariano-rajoy-western-european-time_0_501150160.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) made by our prime minister back when he was campaigning for re-election . 
  has he taken a single step towards them since then ? 
  of course not , because he 's mariano rajoy and `` doing things '' is simply not what he 's about .
