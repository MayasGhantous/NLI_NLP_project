  see also when the minister of economy promised that [ congress would study it ] ( https://translate.google.cat/translate?hl=ca&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.eldiario.es%2fpolitica%2fguindos-gobierno-estudiara-cambiar-horario_0_179532585.html ) back in 2013 . 
  it 's just one of those debates that never goes anywhere because doing something would be a bigger hassle than letting the news cycle play out . 
  the meetings must have been held by an association like [ these guys ] ( http://www.horariosenespana.com/ ) . 
  they basically exist to be interviewed during the times of the year when we change our clocks . 
  same pattern applies : the news report it , everyone complains that dst is stupid , some politicians say that maybe we should stop doing it and after a week everyone 's forgotten about it . 
  see also the support of independence by [ employment ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jco5ewj.jpg ) or [ education ] ( http://i.imgur.com/untr9ye.png ), 
  that was what we call a `` weather balloon '' . 
  a politician will suggest making a controversial change with the sole purpose of gauging public opinion , the newspapers pick up the story and write some articles for or against it , people talk about it for about a week and then it dies down . 
  it 's funny when foreign news report them thinking they 're being serious about it . 
   independentists just do n't have the demographics . 
  it 's that simple . 
  there is a half catalan part that feels spanish and/or is 3rd generation immigrant from other parts of spain . 
  we could even say that , although talking about ethnicity in 1st world countries ends up being uncommon , its an ethnical question . 
  [ actually , the 3rd generation would mostly vote for independence . 
  it 's the old 1st generation immigrants who bring the highest numbers against independence . 
  ] ( https://sergcastanye.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/suportindyedatorigeninteres.jpg?w=700 ) if anything , the trends show that independence is inevitable in the long term . 
   musk fanboys are in that category of people who have enough of a grasp of science to believe they 're smart ( so , not much of a grasp at all ) and to have a vague understanding of musk 's latest buzzwords , but an insufficient grasp to actually engage in skepticism towards anything he says . 
  this is called the dunning-kruger effect . 
  add in the desire of some people to use scientific advancements , especially in the fields of robotics and space exploration , to fuel their escapistic fantasies and you get musk 's cult of personality . 
  here every town has a patron saint , and their day is the local holiday . 
  nowadays it has less to do with worship and more with watching fireworks , going to concerts and getting drunk , though . 
  searching the sub i 've found [ this map ] ( https://i.imgur.com/5yxz9np.png ) . 
  as you can see , germanic countries are more fluent , probably because it 's easier for them and because in romance countries the older generations were taught french as a foreign language , and russian in the former communist bloc . 
  personally , i found english to be a very easy language to learn . 
  the most difficult part was vocabulary , and even that was n't that bad because of the influence french has had on the language . 
  the sentence structure is very similar and the grammar , compared to a romance language , is very easy , especially verb conjugation . 
  no , i 'm basing it on the attitude you 've shown in the posts you 've written . 
  also , there 's a point were solidarity ends and stupidity begins , and wanting to remain in spain falls into the latter camp . 
  see ? 
  you 'll never understand . 
  like all other alleged spanish `` citizens of the world '' , you 're just a supremacist that does n't have to worry about the survival of their culture . 
  you have no god damn right to tell me what my mother language is and to give one more value than the other . 
  that 's a matter for us catalans to choose . 
  if you 're the ones that are more in our favour , i 'd rather not think about those who are against us . 
  so yes , of course we 're leaving . 
  tsjc is controlled by the central judicial system , by the way . 
  also , google translate is a thing that exists . 
  i got the wrong article , the one about the fabrications and the explicit targeting for pro-independence politicians ( which , i remind you , goes against the principle o neutrality of the justice system ) is [ this one ] ( http://www.publico.es/politica/fernandez-diaz-conspiro-jefe-oficina.html ) all you say in the last paragraphs is that since you 've chosen an awful government , we must eat shit too . 
  sorry , but we 'd rather create our own alternatives . 
  of course you do n't believe it . 
  [ you do n't have to worry about civil servants refusing to learn your mother language to work where you live ] ( http://www.vilaweb.cat/media/attach/vwedts/docs/informeagressionsllengua.pdf ) , [ and fining you and insulting you if you talk to them in it ] ( http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticies/multat-amb-600-euros-per-haver-parlat-en-catala-a-la-guardia-civil-a-laeroport-del-prat/ ) , [ or about the central government doing everything it can to interfere in its teaching in your education system ] ( http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/4103769/20130410/tsjc-obliga-classe-espanyol-sol-alumne-ho-demana.html ) . 
  [ you get all the shiny ] ( http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/2957084/0/cataluna-valencia-critican-estado-use-fondos-destinados-corredor-mediterraneo-para-hacer-obras-en-madrid/ ) [ new infrastructure ] ( http://i.imgur.com/worzkpn.jpg ) [ while we have to beg for the mediterranean corridor ] ( http://www.elnacional.cat/es/economia/corredor-mediterraneo-madrid_151860_102.html ) and have to keep our economy running on crumbling railways and [ empty ] ( http://www.ara.cat/politica/fins-milions-infraestructures-promes-rajoy_0_1767423336.html ) [ promises ] ( http://www.ara.cat/economia/inversio-catalunya_0_1771023095.html ) . 
  you have n't seen politicians [ brag about how they 've cut down your autonomy charter ] ( http://www.elperiodicoextremadura.com/noticias/espana/alfonso-guerra-dice-congreso-se-ha-cepillado-estatut-como-carpintero_232012.html ) , [ destroyed your healthcare system and conspired to fabricate cases against your politicians ] ( http://www.publico.es/politica/fernandez-diaz-fiscalia-afima-gestion.html ) . 
  you could wait forever for that different model because you are n't really affected if you do n't get it . 
  after the failure that was the reform of the estatut , a lot of catalan people , perhaps the majority , are convinced that a reform that devolves more power to the autonomous communities is impossible , much less the federation that most people here wanted . 
  [ i 've brought up this map a lot lately ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yksailb.jpg ) , but it sums up our situation perfectly : almost no one else other than us wants it , and us whining about it while you refuse it only serves to make the resentment between both sides grow . 
  let 's split up as amicably as we can , then . 
  regarding ciu ( or pdc now ) , after this term i do n't see them getting back in power any time soon unless the parliamentary arithmetics force it , whether we achieve independence or not . 
  erc is sure to win the next elections , and their most likely coalition partner is the podemos-comuns coalition , perhaps with the parliamentary support of cup and psc . 
  then again , the political party map of an independent catalonia might look much different . 
  perhaps , but at least we have to give it a try . 
  the balearic islands have a higher fiscal deficit by percentage of their gdp than us , actually . 
  regarding the size of countries , i think we 're in a historical period between the disintegration of the old empires and the rise of continental-sized federations from the current trading blocs in which there is a window of opportunity where the creation of new states is relatively easier than it was before . 
  because we 'd be a contributing country and we 're more than willing to give to the eu budget , since that money is actually well-spent in developing poorer areas , unlike the giant perverse incentive that is the spanish fiscal transfer system . 
  there are plenty more reasons for independence than our fiscal deficit , but why do we have to be more solidary with andalusia than with bulgaria , for example , when they objectively need it more ? 
  also  language barrier for no good reason ah , the dose of `` catalan is useless '' , as always . 
  look , if the eu can manage to accomodate maltese it can do the same with catalan just fine . 
  our government would be the one to pay for the translation services anyway . 
  would you not allow andorra to join for that same reason ? 
  and for the upteenth time , all pro-independence parties have said that they want spanish to be cooficial in an independent catalonia . 
  to me , it looks like it has been much more on the side of self-determination and the creation of new states during the last century . 
  look at how many new countries have seceded vs. how many have been merged . 
  it 's a shame so many people still cling to outdated ideas of keeping territorial integrity by force . 
  but catalonia wants to remain in the eu after independence . 
  from your point of view , it should be neither a gain nor a loss . 
  if anything , you should criticise the spanish government if they tried to veto our eventual accesion attempt . 
  valencians should do what they want . 
  unlike you , we do n't want to impose our will on them . 
  and why does catalonia have to integrate into the eu as a part of spain and not on its own ? 
  there are already plenty of states of its size . 
  that 's like saying that the realms of the commonwealth are n't independent . 
  also , it says `` a realm of the crown of aragon '' not `` part of the realm of aragon '' . 
  do n't try to twist it . 
  [ of course we have !, 
  ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20161211/412548253842/congreso-debatira-abrir-ponencia-buscar-salida-conflicto-catalan.html ) [ many times in fact !, 
  ] ( http://amp.20minutos.es/noticia/2108575/0/consulta-soberanista-cataluna/debate-congreso/directo/ ) congress has always turned it down . 
  * crown * of aragon , not kingdom . 
  they were two different states in a personal union . 
  i 'm going to call bullshit on that . 
  all catalan independence threads have always ended up looking like this one . 
  i just think spain 's version of it leaves much to be desired . 
  we 're more into non-violent civil disobedience . 
  also , converging as a constituent country is better than doing so as a region of one . 
  that was before he had to agree with another party to form a government . 
  the referendum is scheduled for 18 months after it took office . 
  also , it was president mas who said that , who is n't even in office anymore , and this was vice-president junqueras . 
  you should be ashamed of lying about the king 's salary while having that flair , btw . 
  [ he and his family earn hundreds of thousands of euros per year , plus millions to maintain their estates ] ( http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2017/04/04/actualidad/1491289872_260801.html ) . 
  oh the irony . 
  ah , a valencian that likes to `` ofrenar noves gl\u00f2ries a espanya '' and expects the rest of us to do the same . 
  you guys pay more attention to these people than we do . 
  can political discourse in this country go beyond `` here 's the other side 's extremists '' ? 
  to be fair , that 's only true if you count immigrants . 
  the abuelos will die sooner than later , and most of the latinos ca n't vote so their opinion does n't matter . 
  i say that even if you think that a frontier with catalonia would be artificial ( even though it 's a pleonasm ) you can clearly deal with it so another one should n't bother you that much . 
  the roussillon can go die in a fire for all i care . 
  first of all , i hardly ever talk about media , and secondly , you said `` the catalan news outlets are not impartial '' , which is a lot different from what you 're saying now . 
  if the majority of the valencian population dislike the idea they do , as a matter of fact . 
  at best it 's a misguided attempt to save them from themselves . 
  we were talking about portugal .
