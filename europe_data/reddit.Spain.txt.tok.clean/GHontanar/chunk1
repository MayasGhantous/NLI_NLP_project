for the spanish government there is a difference between a `` legal secession '' and a unilateral declaration of independence ; if the scottish referendum is legal , then an independent scotland joins the eu , that is not a problem for spain . 
  the problem is regions declaring independence unilaterally , and newborn countries staying in the eu instead of going out and then in again . 
  upvoted for ambitious . 
  it would need coordination with r/de , they are quite efficient . 
  well , consider it strasbourg, 
  germany has taken over that space , so ... 
  the thing is that many are contributing to the blue corner not knowing that yurop awaits, 
   why not count it ? 
  because it did n't administered catalonia , just as the [ republican goverment in exile ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/gobiernos_de_la_segunda_rep%c3%bablica_espa%c3%b1ola_en_el_exilio ) did n't administered spain in 1939-1977 . 
  the generalitat in exile was elected just from exiled catalans , not all of them ( for obvious reasons ) , so it only represents some catalans , the ones that could elect their representatives at the time , those not living in catalonia . 
  well yes but if you count in years , erc - 11 years ( 1931-1939 | 1977-1980 ) if we do n't count the goverment in exile ; psc : 7 years ; ciu : 30 years , so there is not a clear prevalence of left wing goverments , furthermore , that could also be said about other ccaa ( for example [ asturias ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/presidente_del_principado_de_asturias ) being predominantly left wing , or [ castile and leon ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/presidente_de_la_junta_de_castilla_y_le%c3%b3n ) right wing )  * bases de manresa * i will read about that , seems like an interesting topic , thank you !, 
   btw , you should add that other ccaas have this too yes , all ccaa control their health and education systems , have their own goverment and parliament , but not all have their own civil code nor their own police force i think . 
  * i do n't think so : [ here ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/presidente_de_la_generalidad_de_catalu\u00f1a ) you can see a list of catalonia 's presidents since 1931 and their political affiliation , and there is not an overall prevalence of left leaning governments . 
  for example , right now , the president is from pdc , former convergencia , center right , though it is true that they run in coalition with erc , which part of the leftist political spectrum . 
  [ here ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/anexo:presidentes_del_gobierno_de_espa\u00f1a ) you can see a list of spain 's pms ; i do n't think their is a huge political divide ( obviously not taking into account the issue of catalonia 's independence ) * as for autonomy : catalonia has its own government and parliament , police force , education and health systems , it has its own civil code ( not completely sure about this one ) . 
  there is even international representation of catalonia . 
  what catalonia does not have is complete control over taxes , mostly ( something different from the basque country and navarre ) . 
  anyone , feel free to correct me , i am not an expert by any means . 
  it depends on the autonomous community . 
  for example , i have yet to see someone flying a madrid flag , but in catalonia is fairly common ( both senyeras and esteladas ), 
  well , i do n't know about the uk and germany , but i can tell you that flying the spanish flag is not common at all , actually it would be seen as something the far right does . 
  maybe during a sports competition , such as football world cup , but that 's it , and certainly not in a flagpole . 
  i understand what you say ( fyi , they may change the judge in charge ) but you were talking about fraud in the exams , as in fraud to become a judge . 
  that is a serious accusation, 
  vast majority of judges are not appointed , just in the supreme court and the constitutional court . 
  i am not aware of any frauds in the public exams of judges and prosecutors , i would like to read your sources .

  woops , you are right . 
  modern spain alone would n't be enough . 
  buuuuuut , do n't forget that the viceroyalty of new spain includes modern day ** california ** . 
  ah , good times . 
  not with the viceroyalty of new spain on our side !, 
  :p actually , i looked it up and spain 's gdp is larger than netherlands + belgium . 
  our problem is gdp per capita . 
  we are too many . 
  yes please , reunite the seventeen provinces . 
  it will make it easier for us . 
  just wrote one spanish comedy show about this , linking the website . 
  it would be great if they did one !, 
  [ another perspective ] ( http://www.romanicoaragones.com/colaboraciones/loarreaereas%20g08.jpg ), 
  i do n't know why , but it is not like that anymore , [ just plain burgundy ] ( https://www.dnielectronico.es/img/todos_pasaporte.jpg ), 
  no no , no offense at all . 
  it is just that i 've never thought about that !, 
  well , next time i am in portugal i will try to compare both bottled waters, 
  i 'm really curious , what do you mean when you say that our bottled water tastes funny ? 
  it is the first time i 've heard that !, 
  best regards , brother-in-shampoo !, 
  kiev is the english name of the city ( and in spanish , french . . ) we are speaking in english so we should use the english name , kiev . 
  [ g7 summit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/43rd_g7_summit ), 
  sure , one of the greatest fiscal deficits of the world , but , you know , [ even the fucking community of madrid has a bigger fiscal deficit that catalonia ] ( http://www.efe.com/efe/espana/economia/madrid-es-la-comunidad-con-un-mayor-deficit-fiscal-que-duplica-a-cataluna/10003-3002067 ), 
  spain joined nato in 1982 , not during the dictatorship . 
  i do n't know about portugal , though, 
   millions of americans literally lost their homes in 2008 . 
   this did n't happen in the eu . 
  i ca n't speak for other countries , but it absolutely did happen in the eu . 
  people lost their homes in spain , and it is still happening . 
  ** people commited suicide in spain due to losing their homes . 
  ** i do n't know about economy , i do n't know if what the eu did was better than what the us did , but what you said is wrong .

  [ oh yes , ] ( https://twitter.com/rotochop_/status/863498216523919362 ) [ yes ] ( https://twitter.com/davidramosc_/status/863495622313349120 ) [ we are ] ( https://twitter.com/eiprofeta/status/863497740902379520?s=08 ) ( in spain , when someone 's voice cracks , we call it to `` make a rooster '' ),

  there you go !, 
  spain can very much afford it . 
  we spent less in healthcare per capita , yet we have longer life expectancy , lower infant mortality that the us ... 
  so yes , we can , and we should do it . 
  this actually reduces costs . 
  if you provide cheap primary care , you prevent more serious and costly treatments . 
  honestly , i did n't knew that ireland wants to leave the eu . 
   people should have the choice to leave or stay . 
  people have the choice to leave or stay , look at the uk . 
  you are of course right .

   i did n't vote for her on first round and i do n't really like her , here it goes would you mind telling us who you voted for in the first round ? 
  i 'm curious to know . 
  thanks !, 
  well yes , but in this particular case i would say it is huge because it is a monument from franco to ... franco . 
  after all , he is buried in there . 
  and that is something dictators tend to do , build huge monuments to their ego . 
  i also have a question , why are tourists so fascinated with the valle de los ca\u00eddos when they come to madrid ? 
  to be honest , i do n't know . 
  ( i just have a basic knowledge about territorial disputes haha ) but reading about the icj : its resolutions are not legally binding and any permanent member of the security council can veto its resolutions , see [ nicaragua v united states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicaragua_v._united_states ) , so maybe that is why ? 
  i do n't know . 
  i think what you are implying is what i have read from some british redditors about this topic of the icj : they say that it is because spain knows that the icj would rule in gibraltar 's favour , but i really do n't know, 
  well , the un also says that gibraltar is a territory pending decolonization . 
  and what the un says does n't matter to its disputed waters status , because that is what it means to be disputed . 
  gibraltar ( and the un , if you say so ) states that those waters belong to gibraltar . 
  spain does n't agree with that , so those waters are disputed . 
  i agree that it is nonsense to recognize a territory and do n't recognize its waters , but it is a complex matter , it is not as easy as to say : those are gibraltar 's waters , and that is it . 
  all what i say is that spanish ships go through those waters because they are not undeniably gibraltarian . 
  when spain signed it , it added this : * disposici\u00f3n final s\u00e9ptima . 
  * which more or less says that when signing the agreement , spain explicitly does n't recognize any gibraltarian rights towards territorial waters that are not stated in the treaty of utrecht . 
  just to clarify , i am no legal expert , so i do n't really know how this would translate to any legal dispute , but there it is . 
  i just wanted to add some more information,
