yep i believe they have pretty good international recognition . 
  they go to spain and not just for that day , i remember watching mary beard last year for instance spending some time in asturias , meeting kids at schools , etc ^ ( and they get 50k $ ) it 's just that it 's the first time i listen them being called the `` spanish nobel prizes '' xd, 
   thanks for your opinion . 
  i 'm not explaining any opinion ... 
  it was approved by the catalan parliament ( and guess what , pp and c 's voted against it ) . 
  here you have [ la vanguardia ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20150121/54423844717/parlament-aprueba-la-ley-del-aran-que-reconoce-identidad-y-derecho-a-decidir.html ) about it . 
  and here you have this from the future [ catalan constituion ] ( http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/politica/derecho-autodeterminacion-constitucion-catalana-aran-5123824 ) on the same issue . 
  i hope this is clear enough for you ... 
   i do n't understand why would you bring it up . 
  thought that was pp 's tactic . 
  you know `` venezuela '' every time we talk about podemos , had to do it :p and i was n't saying you are a pp supporter . 
  but this venezuela stuff ... should n't be on the main focus 24/7 in spain . 
  what if podemos condemns the situation there ( which i agree with you ) ? 
  what will happen in venezuela after that ? 
  i mean , should n't us all on spain be more worried about what 's happening here in the country ? 
  i 'm just so tired of this lame tactic of pp & co consisting on giving too much attention to venezuela just because they know it 's a political tactic for them . 
  is n't there a war in syria with millions of refugees ? 
  why pp keeps only talking about venezuela ? 
  and what is this * shit * article from * el pa\u00eds * ? 
  for real ... 
  i do n't think i understand what you mean . 
  val d'aran has the right to self-determination . 
  therefore when catalonia becomes independent they are free to chose to say with spain , go with catalonia or form a new country . 
  this has been assured by the catalan government and in fact approved by law ; they are free to decide their future . 
  on a serious note i doubt val d'aran would chose to say in spain , but they are free to do so . 
  better to remind that the only place in the world where the occitan language is recognized as an official language is in catalonia ( official in the whole nation , even tho it 's only spoken by 4700 people according to wikipedia ) . 
  despite being more spoken in france or italy ( map of [ occitania ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/occitania_blanck_map.png ) ) , those countries are far from what catalonia does . 
  catalonia has always granted a special status for val d'aran in many areas , being their anguage studied in all schools of val d'aran for instance . 
  i wonder what kind of treatment would receive them in spain . 
   otherwise known as the spanish nobel prizes are they ? 
  o.o on a side note , congratulations eu !, 
  deserved  ps : i 'm aslo happy the astrophysicist kip thorne & co. won the technical & scientific research award !, 
  love him < 3, 
   so you run your ac all day ? 
  i was talking in general here in barcelona , how we have ac everywhere . 
  from public transport ( almost to the point of being cold on the bus today , but hey 0 complains ! ), 
  to university , etc. 
  also in my home , otherwise i would die . 
  there 's no air where i live u.u, 
  pp could also stop being the most fucking corrupt thing in spain so that could n't be used as an excuse to attack them anymore , but somehow they still refuse to do it . 
  edit : that downvoting !, 
  apparently i triggered some pp voters xd i 'm not defending podemos stuff with venezuela , but el pa\u00eds is so ridiculous lately . 
  and i thought el pa\u00eds was the only serious media in spain ... 
  wooow this podemos guys !, 
  evil , bad guys !, 
  venezuela !, 
  ps : can someone explain me why this article is on '' * el pa\u00eds in english * '' cover while in the spanish version i ca n't even find it in the '' [ pol\u00edtica ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/ ) '' section ? 
  this is what the article says , last paragraph xd explanation for context . 
  i 'm not doing anything . 
  omg dude ... you just ca n't stop criticizing . 
  with * you * you mean the president of catalonia ? 
  he 's just saying he praises it . 
  the president lireally said : '' * the reaction by the bern canton to moutier 's decision to abandon it and join jura is an example of democracy and respect * '' . 
  how you criticize that ? 
  what is what you `` expect '' from people ? 
  not saying anything , right ? 
  no wonder why mariano rajoy is your favorite then . 
  spain will when we leave . 
   the catalan president , carles puigdemont , on monday praised the `` exemplary '' reaction from the german-speaking berna canton to the town of moutier 's decision to transfer to french-speaking jura . 
  in a referendum on sunday , the town voted in favor of joining jura with 51.7 % of the vote . 
  in a press release , the executive council of bern said it `` accepted '' the decision and invited jura to start the `` negotiations on the specifics of the transfer '' as soon as possible . 
  the government of bern also explained that it has always chosen to have an attitude of `` tolerance and openness towards separatist movements '' . 
  catalonia is planning to hold an [ independence referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_independence_referendum,_2017 ) on october 1 . 
  hehe actually i 've seen some redditors saying the same date you named . 
  probably you got it from them . 
  there are many factors , the fact there was a war in the middle ( spanish civil war ) and construction stopped while many of gaud\u00ed 's drawings and miniatures were destroyed . 
  also the donations to the church were so little , the construction had to be very slow . 
  with tourism boom , money started coming in millions and the church invested in resources and workers , experts , etc. 
   because of the technique they are using to build it ? 
  for a big part , yes . 
  it 's said gaud\u00ed was 100 ahead of his time as an architect . 
  the project is extremely complex . 
  it was n't with the most advanced aeronautical software that some parts of the temple could be understood and solved today . 
  and in fact they created a construction method designed specifically for the church , with pre-fabricated stone panels ( with steel skeleton , for safety reasons ) that weight 10 + tones . 
  they are built outside barcelona , and then brought to the temple for assembly in a critical process where everything should match between fractions of an inch . 
  this technique did n't exist 1 year ago . 
  and it has helped advance the construction of the 10 remaining towers of the church a lot ( the tallest one being at 172,5 m , making it the tallest church on eart ) . 
  today we only see 8 towers . 
  in 9 years expect a total of 18  on this [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fsf75qgxws ) you can see an animated explanation of this technique . 
  on this [ video ] ( https://youtu.be/ecwmxgjr194?t=26m22s ) you can see the live moment the panels are brought to the temple and being assembled . 
  it 's been long enough , do n't add 2 more years :p, 
  in ** 2026 ** , 100 years after gaud\u00ed 's death . 
  you can learn more about the temple [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znnwpmdwm1w )  in 1984 the architects said at least 150 years would be needed to finish the construction . 
  in 2000 the architects said at least 40-50 years would be needed to finish the construction . 
  today we know in 9 years the architectonic part of the church will be completed !, 
  the symbolic/artistic parts and surrounding areas of the church will still be waiting fro completion . 
  thanks to the increase of money and the progress of construction techniques ( no place in the world is constructing the way it 's done in sagrada fam\u00edlia ; that 's why it 's called a `` construction laboratory '' ) , the construction has advanced a lot . 
  meanwhile i permanently live near to an ac in summer xd, 
  574.8 km/h is amazing for a conventional wheeled high-speed train ... a couple years ago i was at japan 's yamanashi prefecture test track watching the maglev train doing tests at about 500 km/h ( at that time the record was at 581 km/h ) . 
   because you write very well i do n't think i write very well on the other hand i believe my english sucks a lot , specially when talking with people like you ( that clearly have superior english skills ) . 
  but yeah well thanks :d i mean i like politics and this stuff ( among many other things lol , politics is not my life ) !, 
  and i 'm also studying for final exams , but i 'm just soooooo bored of it that i 'm here on reddit way more time than i should xd i also like discussing with you because you probably are the smartest redditor i have ever found , so it 's great !, 
  i 've learned quite a few things from you . 
   ok i think i know what is happening here , the ciudadanos party is very different in catalonia and the rest of spain . 
  yep there 's been an evolution in c 's to find their spot in the spanish politics . 
  moving back and forth in many areas ( from abortion to economics ) . 
  c 's purpose for catalonia ( against catalan nationalism with some anti-catalanism ) was different than the one for spain . 
  politics in catalonia is another world ... we might not be an independent country * yet * , but we definitely are in the politics aspect xd just looking at the fact the ruling party of spain ( pp ) is almost the less voted party in catalonia with representation in parliament ( cup got 8.21 % of votes and pp 8.49 % ) . 
  it 's extremely difficult to find a pp voter in catalonia , for real you 'd be amazed . 
  if you are more right oriented you vote ciu or c 's .
