  despite the suffocating heat , thousands of people gathered in [ montju\u00efc ] ( http://i.imgur.com/icivqrc.jpg ) . 
  catalan politicians ( including the president of catalonia ) gathered with associations and personalities of the catalan society , like famous football coach pep guardiola . 
  the event took place beneath the '' [ four columns ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/dccnwkixcaajksq.jpg ) '' , a symbol of catalonia . 
  ## ** [ video ] ( https://youtu.be/kopgmyaig_w?t=5m40s ) ** of pep guardiola 's manifesto in english . 
  the event concluded whit the people signing the national anthem of catalonia ( [ video ] ( http://mp4-high-dwn.media.tv3.cat/6/5/1497180545656.mp4 ) ) . 
  ok i did n't even know about that !, 
  i knew there were [ leaks ] ( http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2017-05-05/santiago-calatrava-chapuza-goteras-estacion-world-trade-center_1378298/ ) . 
  but not that the floor actually makes you slip . 
  that 's just crazy !!, 
  i mean in a city like new york where it can rain a lot . 
  how he did n't thought about it ? 
  specially when something similar happened with calatrava 's [ bridge ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/3101377/venices-new-4m-grand-canal-bridge-injures-tourists.html ) in venice . 
  i will never understand calatrava ... 
  that 's nice from you ... ps : from a `` separatist '', 
  wow :o and that columns !, 
  but you do n't pay that crazy amount of money for something `` cool '' . 
  you can get a `` cool '' station by less than half that price . 
  it 's just ... calatrava  _ <, 
  i guess since it happened in the 14th century , the majority of the folklore has been lost . 
  but according to wikipedia some still remain today maybe old people or rural areas . 
  i actually saw you with the portuguese flair for some days here , only to confuse me even more like wtf is that guy from xddd ps : haha in fact i thought what if he actually is that guy and now i 'm a creepy thing ? 
  mostoriginalnickname wants you fried under the sun . 
  but yeah if you do n't mind the heat , you 'll be fine . 
  i do n't know , there are tourists all year round here ; so it does n't matter at all when to go . 
  if you want to go to the beach , then yep summer . 
  wow i do n't know why i thought you were from asturias ... that 's cool !, 
  it sounds so `` exotic '' to me castilla-la mancha ( i had to google your town , i do n't know shit about geography of spain  . < ) . 
  and it 's so curious how you have portugal at similar distance i have andorra/france xd ps : btw i found [ you ] ( https://d12xfnpxdgf5zf.cloudfront.net/uploads/product/1014/media/15078/phpplkfxn56012f29a201e_1280x760.jpeg ) . 
  wait you are from madrid ? 
  o.o were n't you from asturias ? 
  i 'm sure i would like it !, 
  when i mean i hate cities that focus more on cars , i was n't talking about madrid ( as i said i have never been there ) ; and i can imagine there are cities way worse ( ehem america ) . 
  it annoys me so much , cities like los angeles , miami or even tokyo or london , that are not really pedestrian-friendly . 
  of course london is waaaay better than los angeles , but still so many narrow sidewalks . 
  barcelona is also and old city and has been reformed a lot , to focus in pedestrians only ( i have never seen a city in my life with larger sidewalks than barcelona ; stuff like [ this ] ( http://barcelonaprojects.gatech.edu/city2012/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/206187713_zee4a-l.jpg ) you know ) . 
  the problem i see with this `` gran v\u00eda '' is the fact it has n't been reformed yet ; i do n't know , it just looks so obvious to my eyes . 
  trees + larger sidewalks + less car lanes . 
  the only similar case i see in barcelona would be [ via laietana ] ( http://cdn.20m.es/img2/recortes/2016/04/22/271159-944-629.jpg ) . 
  i was walking there the other day and i was literally terrorized . 
  i 'm just not used to this streets , i believe it 's the only one in barcelona being like this ( no trees and narrow sidewalks ) . 
  and if i can i 'm not going there ever again ( until it 's reformed ) . 
  ps : xd, 
  yeah i thought the same !, 
  i have never been to madrid , but watching this picture ... it just looks so uncomfortable to walk there . 
  i hate cities that focus more on cars than pedestrians  _ <, 
  wow i guess it must be coincidence or maybe not ?? 
  in present-day albania , the word `` catalan '' means `` ugly and mean man '' . 
  there 's a [ wikipedia ] ( https://translate.google.es/translate?hl=es&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fes.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fvenganza_catalana ) page that compilates all the folklore and popular legends that the presence of the company left on the different regions where they passed ( balkan area and greece ) . 
  this article is on 6 different languages edition of wikipedia , being half of them : bulgarian , croatian and serbian . 
  so yeah it 's clear the focus was on that region . 
  there 's some really funny like : `` catalan was the worst insult that could be said to a woman '' . 
  i read there 's something similar about us , the catalans !, 
  it all started on the 14th century when the [ catalan company ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_company ) attacked and looted multiple times the byzantine empire . 
  causing terror among the population and mythical histories about the `` catalans strength '' and stuff like this . 
  so apparently now in albanian '' * katala * '' means `` monster '' , and is used to scare the kids . 
  and in greek there 's a curse related with us like `` the catalans will come to you '' . 
  also in bulgaria there 's a poem from 1915 where it 's said the worst oppressors of the bulgarian nation have been the catalans and the turks . 
  if someone can explain to me , cause i find it so weird xd, 
   who said that ? 
  the idea of the pp is to let vote the whole spain . 
  in other words , as if scotland independence referendum was voted by the whole uk or as if the brexit was voted by all eu countries . 
  absurdity pp 's trademark . 
   what if i do want a castillian state ? 
  why do you ask me ? 
  100 % fine with me , go for it !, 
  i hope when we leave , you start reforming spain and you can finally get a federal state . 
  but i do n't want to take part on this reform . 
  i 'm already too tired of spain ... such a complex and difficult country . 
  so many problems that should have been solved decades ago , and still persist ; like the fascism that still resists . 
  anyway i 'm sure you 'll make it , 
   and the house of commons is worse than a childrens ' class . 
  i would have never imagined that to be honest !, 
  maybe it 's us the europeans that have a misconception of them . 
  british classy and all the stuff xd [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/4bhpxhxp-wu?t=10m4s ) reminds me of a bar with monologues + alcohol . 
  wtf is that ? 
  i saw uk politics as `` serious '' ... but this last year i have learned they actually are n't lol and their [ parliament ] ( https://youtu.be/4bhpxhxp-wu?t=4m20s ) is at the level of those 3rd world countries . 
  it does n't even look as a regular parliament , but a pub full of drunk people xd, 
  xdddddddddd i do n't know why this made me laugh so much, 
  but the 2014 vote was n't a referendum , it was a non-binding participation process . 
  and elections are elections . 
  there has never been a binding referendum on independence in catalonia dude . 
  if you want to criticize/complain about it , you should put more effort . 
  this was too easy ... 
  you are the next ones !, 
  seriously you should go see a doctor ...

  you are so mad dude xd, 
  can you name the other 2 ? 
  because , somehow , i missed them despite living here o.o, 
   stealing the day of the catalans for a their shitty political agenda . 
  xddd lol i thought it was literally impossible to find a song !, 
  but apparently they exist xd, 
   it 's the same with brexit ... actually it can be very similar !, 
  the younger generations voted to remain in the eu , but sadly the older ones voted to leave ( and they were more people ) . 
  something similar might end up happening in catalonia . 
  the younger generations are way more pro-independence .
