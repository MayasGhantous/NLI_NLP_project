  but the older generations are n't that much pro-independence ( specially the ones that lived under the franco dictatorship ; without access to studies and suffering the brain-washing of that period ) . 
  i 'm afraid of the older generations to be honest ... 
  it was semi-private actually , but i do n't think they teach that in the public neither . 
  it sounds so weird to me xd first time i read the spanish constitution was at university . 
  btw , i leave you [ this ] ( http://www.expansion.com/extremadura/2017/06/09/593abecc268e3edc0a8b4587.html ) from the president of extremadura : '' * tenemos que reconocer que todos estamos ahora gobernados en todas las comunidades aut\u00f3nomos por los estatutos que hemos querido , excepto catalu\u00f1a , que est\u00e1 regida por un estatuto que no ha querido * '' ps : which song did you chose ? 
  here you have this from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_independence#beginnings )   the principality of catalonia was a territory of the crown of aragon at the time of the union of aragon and the kingdom of castile in the late 15th century , which led to what would become the kingdom of spain . 
  initially , the various territories of aragon , including catalonia , kept their own fueros ( laws and customs ) and political institutions . 
  catalans revolted against the spanish crown in the reaper 's war of 1640 -- 1652 , which ended in defeat . 
  the war of spanish succession marked the end of catalan autonomy ; the surrender of barcelona to a franco-spanish army on 11 september 1714 , at the end of that war , was followed by the loss of the fueros and the imposition of the nueva planta decrees , a centralised spanish rule . 
  11 september is still observed as national day of catalonia . 
   the beginnings of separatism in catalonia can be traced back to the mid -- 19th century . 
  the renaixen\u00e7a ( cultural renaissance ) , which aimed at the revival of the catalan language and catalan traditions , led to the development of catalan nationalism and a desire for independence . 
  between the 1850s and the 1910s , some individuals , organisations and political parties started demanding full independence of catalonia from spain . 
  not in my high school xd edit : just to clarify we do n't study the estatut of catalunya neither . 
  we do n't study anything related with the law at all . 
  wow well that 's not common with people who does n't study law xd, 
  i would like to add , as a jurist myself , that we should differentiate * what the constitution says * and * what 's the interpretation of what the constitution says * . 
  the 1978 spanish constitution is not `` clear '' in many areas ( made in purpose , to reach major agreements after a dictatorship and a big polarization ) . 
  as it has been pointed by many judges , the current interpretation of the constitution being taken by its `` official interpretatator '' ( constitutional court ) has been evolving through years to an `` extreme '' problematic interpretation ( one of the crucial points in this evolution is the 2010 sentence of the estatut ) in which we are today . 
  the consensual/agreements of the 1978 have been lost . 
  and a more pacific , democratic interpretation of the constitution would have prevented many problems that today spain faces ( as pointed by judges ) . 
  have you even studied in catalonia ? 
  like for real ... 
  the spanish nationalism in catalonia is usually related with far right-wing movements . 
  not everybody of course . 
  you are not from catalonia right ? 
  then i 'm not talking about you ... 
  but if you were from catalonia and you did n't want independence , that does n't mean you are instantly a fascist . 
  but if you go to the 12th of october celebrations of catalonia , you 'll see with which people you have to share the space ; and it wo n't be nice at all  that 's the difference with the 11th of september celebrations and the 12th of october celebrations in catalonia ( and i 'm not talking about attendance difference , which is enormous ) . 
  journalists reporting these 12th of october celebrations in barcelona always explain it . 
  insults and attack to the press . 
  some organizers tell the people to `` hide '' the flags ( francoist flags ) when the press comes , so they ca n't take pictures . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=jordi+borras+12+octubre&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiy1vdoglhuahxdcbokhqcqcwwq_auidcgd&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=645 ) you have some pictures from the 12th of october in barcelona , taken by a photojournalist that received death threats from right-wing associations . 
  now i ask you . 
  would you be comfortable with people like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zcvu7lr.jpg ) or [ this ] ( https://dades.naciodigital.cat/redaccio/arxius/imatges/201211/576_1352545285_mg_1192ok.jpg ) on the streets ? 
  it seems he was just [ manipulating ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6g7741/catalonia_sets_independence_referendum_the_1st_of/dio5sxz/ ) . 
  i compared it with the non-binding vote we had in [ 2014 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_self-determination_referendum,_2014 ) . 
  the question was criticized for being a little too complicated . 
  the idea was to get a major opinion of the people ( the ones who wanted more independence but within spain or a total independence ) ; and political parties not supporting a full independence preferred a more diversed formula . 
  so at the end the [ ballot papers ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/papereta_ca_es-page-001.jpg ) carried two questions : `` do you want catalonia to become a state ? '', 
  and `` do you want this state to be independent ? '', 
  the second question could only be answered by those who had answered yes to the first one . 
  that 's why i like this question we have now xd, 
  then what the judges say ? 
  that the problem is not legal , but political . 
  they are literally `` tired '' of receiving cases that ca n't be solved with the law , since they are political . 
  international law takes care of this subject . 
  not the constitutional law . 
  wtf you saying ? 
  you know you are pretty racist right ? 
  you already named them . 
  an pretty dangerous people if you may ask . 
  journalists that tried to investigate them have received death threats . 
  in fact political parties of catalonia that support unity with spain ( a minority in the parliament ) , stopped celebrating the 12th of october in barcelona because of them . 
  the politicians were tired of being photographed with these people and being accused of sharing the same space . 
  so now , instead , they come by themselves without `` official '' recognition . 
  [ here ] ( https://directa.cat/sites/default/files/imagecache/d_gallery/af_3.jpg ) you have more of these people ( the guy circled apparently is an affiliate of one of these political parties against independence ) . 
  francoism is n't totally dead in spain . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=squ9wiuh3o4 ) you have for instance the former minister of justice of spain ( 2011-2014 ) signing francoist songs and literally praising francisco franco ( at 0:50 ) ; he is n't the one talking , but he 's there . 
   as well ? 
  wait , when did that happen ? 
  what could be done ? 
  an independence referendum . 
  the spanish government wants all people of spain voting because that 's their way of ensuring catalonia will always remain part of spain . 
  why would people from madrid or the canary islands vote in favor ? 
  it 's ridiculous xd constitutional law experts have pointed many times you do n't need a change of the constitution for this . 
   if they parted ways with spain in a correct and legal manner . 
  we have been trying to negotiate with spain for the last years . 
  it 's been impossible . 
  they do n't want to negotiate anything dude ... 
  they just tell us we shall remain part of spain forever ; and that 's not what a considerable part of the catalan population wants . 
  what 's your solution ? 
  seriously ... 
  why is bad ? 
  we want to join the eu as a new european state . 
  independence of catalonia has been a thing for centuries ; it 's not something we have invented lol . 
  just let us be free xd, 
  thank you !, 
   lithuanian people have always been really supportive with our independence . 
  and your political leaders have been one of the most supportive in europe too !, 
  i love the chosen question !, 
  clear and simple  #do you want catalonia to be an independent state in the form of a republic ? 
   in the exact same time of the year than the previous one in 2014 ? 
  but the [ non-binding vote of 2014 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_self-determination_referendum,_2014 ) was on 9 november 2014 . 
  how is that the exact same time ? 
  and i believe both october 1st and november 9th are actually closer to october 12th ( national day of spain ) , where the spanish nationalism is on its highest peak . 
  of course very few people celebrate it in catalonia compared with the catalan national day , but there 's some people on the streets of barcelona ( and some not really welcomed people too ; as seen [ here ] ( http://cdn.20m.es/img2/recortes/2013/10/12/141861-862-550.jpg ) or [ here ] ( https://rsamadrid.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/12octubre.jpg ) ) . 
  your weird argumentation ... 
  / u/masiakasaurus already explained it pretty much . 
   are the plans from gaudi that difficult to implement ? 
  exactly !, 
  this is one of the most important reasons . 
  the [ finished ] ( http://www.godsmurf.com/photos/2007-12-barcelona/barcelona-sagrada-familia-002.jpg ) project is extremely complex . 
  even difficult with our present knowledge and computers . 
  it 's said gaud\u00ed was 100 years ahead of his time . 
  you can learn more about this on this [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znnwpmdwm1w ) , where it 's explained really well . 
  i 'd like to know as many things about cerd\u00e0 as you < 3 xd, 
   a spanish federation would be far more possible than a catalonian independence i would like to believe you ... but no offense , i do n't see it . 
  we 've been trying to change spain for the last decades . 
  what catalans want , can not fit in the current spain ( i.e.
