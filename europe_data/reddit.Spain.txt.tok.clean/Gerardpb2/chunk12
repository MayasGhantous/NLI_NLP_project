  again our estatut , voted by the catalan people , was declared illegal for the most part by the constitutional court of spain ) . 
  can we change spain to `` please '' the desires of the catalan people ? 
  i do n't know ; should we ? 
  would n't it be easier to just create or own country and please ourselves ? 
  without a constitutional court telling us `` what 's right for us , and what is not '' ? 
  at the end i would n't have any problem living in a country called europe . 
  and being just a nation inside a european state . 
  but i do n't think we can keep living in a spanish state . 
  and waiting for a `` future reform of spain that nobody knows when will come '' . 
  and when it finally arrives the moment of reforming spain , everybody knows it will be a complete madness . 
  seriously it scares me just to think about the next reform of the spanish constitution and of the territorial organization . 
  but this wo n't happen ... 
  i would be lying to myself if i believed on this . 
  a spanish federation , a spanish republic ... seriously i ca n't imagine when will this happen . 
  it is much easier to build or own country than keep trying to reform spain . 
  with the estatut it was pretty clear that what catalans `` want '' can not fit in `` spain '' . 
  i was answering the other guy , that said `` unless barcelona is first , nothing else will do '' . 
  we do n't want to be the `` first of spain '' . 
  we just want to have our own country , that 's it . 
  i 'm sure spain will be fine without us ... 
   screw the rest of the country , right ? 
  unless barcelona is first , nothing else will do . 
  that 's not how it works ... 
  anyway do n't worry , if we become independent you wo n't have to stand the catalan people ever again , 
  and he did correct !, 
  that 's why the catalan government is looking for an agreement . 
  i remember you it 's the spanish government the one that does n't want to negotiate . 
  [ venice commission demands `` agreement '' on catalan referendum ] ( http://www.catalannewsagency.com/politics/item/venice-commission-demands-agreement-on-catalan-referendum ), 
   do you have a source for this ? 
  yeah sure ... - . -, 
  i was n't planning to respond ... since there 's not a `` proper response '' to this image . 
  he 's trying to `` simplify '' way too much , on an area that it is way more complex . 
  first of all comunidad aut\u00f3noma \u2260 city catalonia is a few times larger than madrid and has bigger population . 
  `` centralism '' means , for instance , connecting all provinces of spain to madrid ( radial aves with very few passengers ; instead of focusing in more important connections with france for example ) . 
  and that results in investment in other communities than madrid , but it 's also centralism . 
  bad territorial planning in spain can also seen with high-speed rail connection madrid-seville in 1992 . 
  but the most important one ( madrid-barcelona ) would have to wait until 2008 . 
  there 's no economic rationality in waiting so much to connect the most important cities of spain . 
  and again , this stuff ca n't be seen in the graphic he sent . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/local/valencia/20170329/421288457822/invertido-corredor-mediterraneo-conecta-madrid.html ) is also an example of centralism , despite investing in other comunidades aut\u00f3nomas . 
  you deleted your comment , so i answer you here since i had already written the answer :p you have this in spanish : http://www.lavanguardia.com/local/barcelona/20170312/42799815077/barcelona-vive-mejor-ano-congresos-ferias-convenciones.html this in catalan : http://www.ara.cat/barcelona/barcelona-lider-mundial-turisme-congressos_0_1238276297.html in terms of people ( attendance ) attending to congresses , barcelona is the first city in the world . 
  again , it 's 100 % fine with me if you do n't give a fuck . 
  at the end , the only people that should really `` give a fuck '' are the people from here ( catalonia ) ; the ones that will decide their own future . 
  i 'm explaining when people asks , since there 's people from other places of europe curious about this . 
   how spain is evil i do n't think it 's about `` evil '' , but a bad economic/administration territorial planning . 
  cities like barcelona , valencia , bilbao , seville , etc. 
  suffer from a centralized vision . 
  there 's lots of studies about this . 
  but anyway i 'm not going to keep explaining since you already told me you do n't give a fuck xd, 
   and how are the other cities of catalonia treated in relation to barcelona ? 
  you made a little demagogy question ... but i answer you anyway !, 
  pretty bad , and it should be improved !, 
  but there 's no city in catalonia that can be `` compared '' or that can `` compete '' with barcelona . 
  barcelona can compete ( and already surpasses in many areas ) with madrid . 
  one would expect barcelona receiving , at least , similar economic investment from the state , but that 's not what happens ( the airport example is self-explanatory , despite having similar amount of passengers ) . 
  countries like germany or the united states do n't have a centralized vision ( not investing and focusing on the capital city only ) . 
  spain and france have a similar centralized vision , that hurts other cities like barcelona ( anyway france does n't have a city like barcelona that can compete with paris ; but it 's also an example of centralization ) . 
  with independence i believe not only barcelona will get way more investment and economic progress , but all the other cities in catalonia . 
  i 'm sure the government here wo n't commit the same mistake as in spain ( centralized vision ) . 
   and do you think you would stay in eu after leaving spain ? 
  yes . 
   op , no one gives a fuck , in case you were wondering . 
  i think there 's people interested in knowing this information , judging by the amount of votes it received . 
  but i respect your opinion , it 's fine  i do n't plan everybody to be interested in this stuff at all xd there surely are 100000 things more important in life !, 
  seriously dude ... 
  i mean there 's nothing `` wrong '' with recognizing that . 
  how exactly does barcelona benefit from being in a state where madrid is the 1st priority on everything ? 
  you see the companies and investors complaining about this all the time ... and if you were from barcelona there 's no way you 'd say what you are saying . 
  just read [ this ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/local/valencia/20170329/421288457822/invertido-corredor-mediterraneo-conecta-madrid.html ) for instance ... or when they said they wanted to convert madrid as the `` port of departure for cruise ships '' , despite the city being hundreds of km away from the sea ... 
  i guess in the us it is more diversified , so nyc does n't get that much of congresses when compared with european cities . 
   we are not stronger together . 
  it 's 100 % obvious we are not . 
  but from a `` marketing/sentiments '' view is cool to say : madrid + barcelona combined are * strong * . 
  any economic rational approach will confirm how badly barcelona suffers from this `` strong combination '' ... for people interested in the economic effects of the centralization of spain , i recommend this book in spanish : * [ espa\u00f1a , capital par\u00eds . 
  origen y apoteosis del estado radial : del madrid sede cortesana a la `` capital total '' ] ( https://www.planetadelibros.com/libro-espana-capital-paris/47568 ) * . 
   you 're simply leaving the `` it will go well '' to the sentiments , the feeling , your nationalistic views ... and not much else . 
  i 'm not , trust me , i have studied this stuff a lot ... you can read more about it on this book : [ espa\u00f1a , capital par\u00eds ] ( https://www.planetadelibros.com/libro-espana-capital-paris/47568 ) . 
  and you 'll understand the crazy amount of money barcelona `` loses '' just because being in a centralized spain . 
  and from that , you get the explanation of : madrid airport ( losing big amount of money despite getting the biggest investments ) , ave radial , corredor central , etc. 
  or why the spanish government forces airline companies to flight to/from madrid , blocking barcelona 's airport ( 1st spanish airport by earnings ) options . 
  or the barcelona port problems , with promised connections to the high-speed railway system many years ago ( chinese companies are still waiting for it ) . 
  you have all the statistics you want there . 
  at the end we will be ** stronger ** partners when independent : catalonia and spain , 
   that 's a surprise for me if you were from barcelona it would n't be xd we have congresses 24/7 here ... it 's crazy , one day on the news you have one '' [ retina ] ( http://www.euretina.org/barcelona2017 ) '' congress and the other day is about [ yatchs ] ( http://www.myba-association.com/en/news-detail/news-events/130-myba-charter-show-2017-barcelona-spain-24th-to-27th-april-2017.cfm ) . 
  that 's why it 's said barcelona is the 1st non-capital city in the world with more congresses and meetings . 
   because we rock , of course . 
  but we would `` rock '' way more if we were independent  no offense , but i 'm sure you understand the amount of money and investments we lose in barcelona due to the spanish government centralism vision ( i.e. 
  all the money to madrid ) . 
  so if you want a stronger barcelona , wait for a few years and you 'll see !, 
  nope , i only have from barcelona . 
  source in catalan : http://www.elnacional.cat/ca/economia/barcelona-congressos-mon_158820_102.html  just asking because some people may think ( wrongly ofc ) that your only interest is to show barcelona as 3rd to push some kind of propaganda . 
  who would be so stupid to think that ? 
  xd i 'm from barcelona , so i can easily get more information from here ( in catalan language for instance ) . 
  the tower is the [ torre gl\u00f2ries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/torre_gl%c3%b2ries ) , formerly known as `` torre agbar '' ( offices building ) , designed by jean nouvel . 
  [ now ] ( https://www.euractiv.com/section/uk-europe/news/barcelona-pulls-out-the-stops-for-eu-medicines-agency/ ) it is expected to be the next location for the european medicines agency ( european union agency ) . 
  if it 's not chosen , it 's probably it will become a luxury hotel . 
  this from wikipedia :  one of the most characteristic elements of the building is its nocturnal illumination . 
  the tower has more than 4,500 luminous devices that can operate independently using led technology and enables the generation of images on the outside of the tower . 
  the system is capable of creating 16 million colours , thanks to a sophisticated system of hardware and software . 
  it has the ability to quickly transition between colours which can create a shocking effect .
