   during christmas , [ new year ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfje4m0jjzs ) and other events the tower changes color in animated computer controlled sequences it can change the [ colors ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/d7/17/db/d717dbcdc299784e6c85b9f7faea6cc5.jpg ) and everything , but usually this blue/red thing is what we see every night xd i do n't know exactly `` why these colours '' , so if anybody here knows , explain it please !, 
  pla\u00e7a de les gl\u00f2ries catalanes ( shortened to gl\u00f2ries ) , is a large square in barcelona , first designed by ildefons cerd\u00e0 to serve as the city centre in his original urban plan ( pla cerd\u00e0 ) , but nowadays relegated to quite a secondary position . 
  however , beginning in the early 2000s , and as of 2007 , revamping project for gl\u00f2ries has started , which is aimed to give the square a new role in barcelona and revitalize the northern districts of the city , under the name [ 22@] ( http://www.mustrealty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/22@-district-barcelona.jpg ) ( innovation district ) . 
  the current transformation of the [ square ] ( http://www.glories.cat/imatges/futur/glories_2017.jpg ) , with underground [ tunnels ] ( http://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/glories/wp-content/uploads/tunelcastillejos.jpg ) for vehicles , will transform it into a green space . 
  in case you wondering , the building on the [ left ] ( http://www.masterdg.net/2014-15/projectesweb/olga-pedreira/img/museu.jpg ) is the [ design museum of barcelona ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/design_museum_of_barcelona ) . 
  how is that ? 
   why are there so many black people in france ? 
  i 'm not chinese , but i asked myself this same question many times when visiting france as a kid xd, 
  the number of international association meetings continues to double every ten years : from just under 6,000 in 2006 to over 12,000 in 2016 . 
  newcomers in the top 10 compared to last year are amsterdam ( twelfth last year and now sharing seventh place with madrid ) and seoul ( jumping from 13th to tenth ) . 
  like last year , lisbon is ninth . 
  statistically , barcelona holds at least one congress every 2 days related with the technological or medical sectors , like the esl expo barcelona-gaming experience , the european cardiology congress or the world congress of chemical engineering . 
  notice that this ranking does not include congresses with expositions , like the 4fyn , the mobile world congress barcelona , the automobile barcelona , the barcelona building construmat , the bizbarcelona , the iot solutions world congress barcelona , the barcelona meeting point or the barcelona international boat show . 
  -------------- ** source ** : [ international congress and convention association ] ( http://www.iccaworld.org/npps/story.cfm?nppage=6607 ), 
  i watched both videos , the winning one looks way better !, 
  i 'm sure i will go there when finished !, 
  integrating resort zones with business and residential ones is the best thing to ensure the project can be a success . 
  having just a massive resort and hoping it will be profitable all year long is way too risky . 
  i like it being integrated with the city , instead of building an artificial island some kms away * dubai-style * . 
  even with public transport access !, 
  you 'll be getting a big green lung for all the surrounding areas that look way too dense/over-constructed in the render . 
  when i went to greece a few years ago one thing that shocked me a bit was , without wanting to sound offensive , how * poor * ( * poverty * ) everything looked . 
  projects like this can help the economy a lot !, 
  if everything is well executed , i 'm sure it can be a success . 
  one ca n't find stuff like this in europe , and many people , families and businessmen will prefer going there than a long flight to the caribbean or middle east/asia resorts . 
  that 's the best part xd, 
  i guess we 're going to be `` cheered '' when we effectively become independent . 
  meanwhile we 're just downvote 's food for spaniards on this sub xd, 
  i ca n't take this hymn seriously xd minute [ 2:19 ] ( https://youtu.be/0qqd6t_a9ly?t=2m19s ) lyrics : '' * el baaar\u00e7a . 
  nobody ca n't deny cristiano ronaldo is an amazing good player and one of the best of the present . 
  but leo messi plays in another league indeed . 
  the `` league '' where we can discuss if he 's the best player in the whole football history . 
  we are about to join , 
  i 'm used to be downvoted with anything i post related to catalonia ... for instance [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6eo91s/number_of_young_entrepreneurs_in_catalonia_grows/ ) one was considered as `` propaganda '' . 
  sometimes it 's just been 5 seconds i have posted and the downvotes are already there ; and a few seconds later spaniards ( and openly anti-catalan ) users like rainymeadow & co comments start to appear . 
  i would like to get more comments from european people , instead of the same spaniards commenting ( and downvoting ) all the time in my posts . 
  but anyway i 'm just gon na keep posting stuff for people interested , 
  wow i ca n't wait to see some renders !, 
  the building , which has been designed by the architect \u00cd\u00f1igo am\u00e9zola , will be erected in the barcelona port , in a [ waterfront area ] ( http://www.ara.cat/2015/09/16/ara_mateix/aixi-llevant-projecte-marina-vela_1432066975_24275412_1875x1334.jpg ) that is being developed with luxury hotels and a marina . 
  the museum will have five floors and seven gallery rooms , distributed over 15,000 square meters , and is expected to receive up to 500,000 visitors per year . 
  the developers of the museum -- the designer ujo pallar\u00e9s , from the company cultural development barcelona , and his partner , the russian entrepreneur valery yarovslavski from acceleration group -- will raise a total of $ 38 million from private donors to finance the project . 
  the hermitage barcelona will make use and display of the saint petersburg 's hermitage three-million-item collection .

  it sounds great at the beginning !, 
  before it starts going bad when reaching the uk ... 
  that 's cool !, 
  nope , nothing at all . 
  it was at night and i was too nervous . 
  i could n't even see his face . 
  i think at that time there was n't that much control on that ; now the situation has improved i believe ( they must have their identification visible and all the stuff ) . 
  of course i was so angry at that moment , but well at least he did n't hurt me . 
  and if you compare it with [ quintana ] ( http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2016/04/12/catalunya/1460453324_020202.html ) for instance ( the woman that lost an eye because of mossos ) ... 
  why ? 
  it 's fine !, 
  i just was * in the wrong place at the wrong time * . 
  i was school age ( 15 maybe ? ), 
  during fc barcelona celebrations . 
  there 's always some crazy people there . 
  so when the mossos came to charge , people started running and i did n't know what to do ( since i knew i had n't done anything wrong ) , so i was just standing there on the street . 
  then one police came to me and bumped me ( * porrazo * ) , without any reason . 
  it did n't hurt me at all . 
  but i was so scared xd, 
  at least they want to work here xd anyway i do n't think they are that violent . 
  there are exceptions of course , but the most i have encountered i would say they were pretty nice ^ ( except one time that i was beaten by one of them xd ), 
   an officer stationed in catalonia lasts a year , two at the most , and then leaves . 
  they do n't even want to work here anyway we wo n't need them when independent . 
  our catalan police already does almost all the job . 
  o [ aqu\u00ed ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6d1eue/over_60_of_catalans_reject_unilateral_declaration/dhzptso/ ) que defensaves el pa\u00eds quan va publicar una not\u00edcia sobre un escrit que havia estat immediatament desmentit pel govern de catalunya . 
  get over it . * '' . 
   who is us ? 
  i 'm asking it as catalan . 
  us = the catalans . 
  i am a catalan too  the spanish uses the force every day of course . 
  but i do n't think the state is going to us the force against us ( the catalans ) preventing us from voting . 
  if our president holds a referendum , i do n't expect the spanish police destroying the ballot boxes or `` attacking '' the people that want to vote . 
  so your comment '' * every day , in every state in the world , the state uses the force to prevent something * '' i think it was a bit misplaced here . 
  pd : no sembles pas catal\u00e0 ... he llegit bastants comentaris teus on denotes un anticatalanisme bastant notable . 
  best part is you 'll be able to go inside the cross you see at the top of the church ( walking through the extremes ) ; it will be semi-transparent . 
  at night this cross will make light to be seen kilometers away . 
  watch [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znnwpmdwm1w ) then xd, 
  yep well i like economic statistics and economy evolution analysis , 
   i asked as i am interested in this topic i am also interested , and i have already asked him multiple times why he does this . 
  but he never answered me ( i feel like he only replies me to insult me or my nation ) . 
  let 's hope he , at least , answers you xd ps : i guess your username comes from when you lived in spain ? 
  `` gamberro ''  ps2 : i 'm being downvoted on this comment too xd, 
  `` brutalist style '' xddd you are talking about the ** passion fa\u00e7ade ** ( [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sagrada_fam%c3%adlia#passion_fa.c3.a7ade ) )  in contrast to the highly decorated [ nativity fa\u00e7ade ] ( http://estaticos.elperiodico.com/resources/jpg/0/3/lpedragosa32100693-barcelona-2015-fachadas-sagrada-famili151215224345-1450216056630.jpg ) , the [ passion fa\u00e7ade ] ( https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7373/26947520734_27d2795d3a_b.jpg ) is austere , plain and simple , with ample bare stone , and is carved with harsh straight lines to resemble the bones of a skeleton . 
  dedicated to the passion of christ , the suffering of jesus during his crucifixion , the fa\u00e7ade was intended to portray the sins of man . 
  that 's why !, 
  this is also the [ style ] ( http://www.gestornoticias.com/archivos/religionenlibertad.com/image/subirachs_esculturas.jpg ) of the sculptor josep maria subirachs ( a bit polemic indeed ; for example this '' [ lion ] ( http://i.imgur.com/andy3xk.jpg ) '' located at the passion 's pediment ended up being removed because of the criticism , and they are still working on a new design ) . 
  anyway i like both facades ( i ca n't chose a favorite one ) : passion and nativity . 
  with its unique and different style ; and also purpose ( nativity vs passion ) . 
  in a few years we will have to add the 3rd facade ( [ glory facade ] ( https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3873/14853842327_85339bcc0a_o.png ) ) which will be the biggest and majestic one , since it will be the principal entrance of the whole church . 
  next focus will be connections with india , tokyo and mexico .
