  little did they know how long we would have to wait !, 
   follow your track to know that nothing happened to you . 
  why do you care so much about me ? 
  xd leave me alone !, 
   finally your daily ~ ~ propaganda ~ ~ statistics thread !, 
  i do n't think i post daily , but yeah i thought it was interesting to share the progress and good evolution of the catalan economy . 
   why did you post it that late today ? 
  i have other things to do than spending my time in reddit ? 
  lol ps : i 'm also preparing another thread , this time about barcelona airport , in case you want to comment there too !, 
  since you seem to be in all my posts ... 
   the number of young entrepreneurs in catalonia has grown , equalling the european average . 
  in 2016 almost one in ten catalans between 18 and 34 years of age was an entrepreneur . 
  specifically , ** 9.5 % of young people were engaged in creating their own business , while the european average is 9.9 % ** . 
  catalonia 's figure is more than three points above the spanish average ( 6.2 % ) . 
   catalonia had not achieved such levels of entrepreneurship since 2007 , a year before the start of the economic crisis , according to the latest global entrepreneurship monitor ( gem ) , presented this wednesday at the biz barcelona entrepreneurship fair . 
  yep spain = central government it 's important to make it clear that when we talk about `` spain '' , i mean the spanish government/politics stuff . 
  nothing against the people   the the dang government that seems to think that a more centralized state is a good idea in a country with multiple nations . 
  it 's obvious that an effort for decentralization or recognition of the multiple nations and differences that for instance catalonia has ( like the basque country also , etc. 
  ) , will have helped preventing the rise of independence movement in catalonia . 
  but negotiations with pp or psoe have been impossible . 
  that 's why many people here believe that spain `` will never change '' and at the end is better/easier to just build our own country and stop trying to change spain . 
  yep of course , the deadline is for 2026 ( 100 years after gaud\u00ed 's dead ) . 
  this deadline is for the architectonic part of the building ; the most important part . 
  there will still remain work related with the symbolic and artistic parts and the entrances ( outside of the perimeter of the building ; like [ this ] ( http://www.ara.cat/2017/03/19/dossier/sagrada-familia-convertir-conflicte-oportunitat_1762033969_39529437_4000x3429.jpg ) even tho this is not the official/final design for the enrance ) . 
  take into account that we currently only see 8 towers of the sagrada fam\u00edlia in 2017 . 
  in 2026 you 'll see a total of 18 towers , and one of them will make it the tallest building in barcelona ( 172,5 metres ) and the tallest church on earth . 
  so there 's a lot of work to do , but i 'm sure they make it for 2026 . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.ara.cat/2017/03/19/dossier/final-sagrada-familia_1762033921_39523269_1500x1000.jpg ) is how you see it now in 2017 this is a video of the process until 2026 : [ 2026 we build tomorrow ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcdmlog3txu ) here you have the finished product : * [ drawing ] ( http://www.godsmurf.com/photos/2007-12-barcelona/barcelona-sagrada-familia-002.jpg ) * [ 3d ] ( http://info7.blob.core.windows.net.optimalcdn.com/images/2016/11/11/607577_la-sagrada-familia-10.jpg ), 
  just this week we reached [ 3rd floor ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cpc1var.jpg ) level at mary 's tower :d this is a [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkzi-lme3po ) of the critical process in case anyone wants to see !, 
  millimetric precision with stone panels that weight tonnes . 
  i see him on almost every post about catalonia . 
  he does n't live in catalonia and when reading him it 's obvious he does n't know anything about here . 
  yet he feels he 's on the position to speak as a local or as someone who knows catalan politics . 
  he 's just pure anti-catalanism , you 'll see him criticizing the catalan people in every thing we do . 
  just read him :  you 've hit their weakness ... reasoned arguments . 
  it 's pathetic ... 
   probably the guys in catalonia feel the same well i do n't `` hate '' spain , and i have n't met any catalan pro-independence that `` hates '' spain . 
  i just want to have my country xd, 
  there are reasons on almost every subject you can think about ( from `` pensions '' , to `` trains '' , `` evictions '' ) ... 
  i have been asked this same question many times here in reddit and it 's incredibly hard to answer it in a `` short '' way , and i understand it 's not that logical as seen from the outside without a proper or minium knowledge of catalonia . 
  since you asked '' * did spain invade catalonia ? 
  * '' i want to say that i 'm going to omit the part about the history of catalonia ( where all the confrontations with spain are narrated including all the persecutions of the catalan culture and [ language ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/22/catalan-language-survived ) ) , because one can read it by himself in [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_catalonia ) and it would n't be easy to summarize it all . 
  history is important of course , and my family for instance ( like my 90 years old grandmother ) suffered a lot the spanish repression against catalonia , but it 's just another topic that contributed to the pro-independence sentiment of many catalans , among many other topics that affect a larger part of the catalan population ( specially the catalans that emigrated here from other regions of the world , and now support independence ; even the ones that came from spain ( i.e. 
  [ s\u00famate organization ] ( http://www.sumate.cat/ ) ; in spanish : `` it does n't matter where you come from , but the destination '' ) . 
  you have to understand that people here in catalonia are not pro-independence `` right after we 're born here '' . 
  it 's after years of learning and understanding many things here that you start to realize what 's the best option for yourself and your future generations . 
  it would be easier if you came to live in catalonia for 1 year , and after that you ask yourself the same question xd you need to understand and know that for the last decades , the catalan government has made efforts to find a solution for the problem before going for independence . 
  all the negotiations and proposals have been denied by the spanish government ( like more autonomy , less tax pressure as the other regions of spain have , etc. ) . 
  at the end the only solution is the independence . 
  catalans alone ca n't change spain ( transform spain in a federal state , reform many of its institutions , etc. 
  ) , so it 's easier and more doable to create a catalan republic that can fit all the necessities and aspirations of the catalan population ; something within spain it has been impossible anyway here you have the ** reasons ** . 
  as i explained , do n't want to make a long list of things , so i just named a few that can be easily understood : - monarchy ( spain ) vs republic ( catalonia ) : catalan people are republicans and do n't believe in an expensive and undemocratic monarchy like the spanish one . 
  spain does n't have any plans to transition from a monarchy to a republic . 
  - catalan vs spanish language : spain in history has never really protected the catalan language ( in fact in the past has tried to [ eliminate ] ( http://scholar.oxy.edu/urc_student/909/ ) it ) . 
  the catalan government efforts are not enough , without proper legislation that only spain can approve ( for instance , in many courts in catalonia it is * easier * to use dutch , german or french than catalan language ) . 
  a way to sum up the language status in catalonia is : you do n't * need * catalan to live in catalonia , but you need spanish to live in catalonia . 
  and well from here lots of problems arise ... - catalan culture vs spanish culture : for example in 2010 catalan parliament banned bull-fighting , considering it an animal cruelty act . 
  right after this the spanish government declared bullfighting a national heritage , so no other region of spain could ban it ( like catalonia did ) . 
  now in 2017 recently , a court in madrid ruled against the decision of catalonia and said bullfighting must be legal in catalonia . 
  - different projects : there are too much examples here ... for example catalonia believes more in european integration ( mediterranean high-speed railway system to connect with europe for example ) , whereas spain 's projects include high-speed railway systems to connect radial villages with madrid or more economic relations with latin america . 
  in infrastructures the discussions are permanent . 
  my opinion ? 
  yes xd i mean you do n't start a project like this if you do n't have analyzed all the other options and reasons in detail before . 
  it 's not only about money , but political and cultural ( language for instance ) differences that make spain and catalonia coexistence very difficult . 
  at the end everything is about happiness and well-being , and all the rights you can enjoy in your country are the same ones we want for our future [ catalan republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_republic ) , since we currently are a stateless nation . 
  more than 80 % of the catalan population supports an independence referendum . 
  so our president is working on that for this year . 
   madrid has indicated that it does n't intend to let go of a fifth of spain 's economy or barcelona , its second-largest city . 
   in march , spain 's constitutional court barred artur mas , puigdemont 's predecessor , from holding office for two years because he ran an independence referendum in 2014 . 
  the poll he organized was symbolic and nonbinding , but nonetheless constituted an act of criminal civil disobedience in the eyes of the justice system . 
   that has n't stopped puigdemont 's plans to hold a referendum in september 2017 . 
  according to his vice president , he is willing to declare independence unilaterally if spain tries to block the vote . 
  when asked about the possibility of meeting the same fate as mas , puigdemont answered with bravado . 
  `` this is not important , '' he said . 
  `` ** if we are barred from public office , there will be another person , and another person , and another person ... nothing will change ** . '' [ foreign policy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_policy ), 
   every day , in every state in the world , the state uses the force to prevent something . 
  so you affirm the spanish state is going to use the force against us so we ca n't vote ? 
  ps : instead of downvoting me , you could answer if you want ... 
  you have to take into account the amount of spaniards on this subreddit that downvote/criticize anything our catalan government does . 
  people like rainymeadow and enelade for example . 
  so news like this usually do n't get the amount of opinions from europe one would expect . 
  for example this one i posted yesterday , was massively downvoted and basically spaniards only commented : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6eaha3/former_councilor_of_the_bank_of_spain_the_law_on/ i 'm sure europeans are more comprehensible people . 
  at least that 's what i get when traveling and speaking with people from all over the world about catalonia . 
   would n't that be convenient for him ? 
  not for me !, 
  you would be surprised how common things like this are in catalonia ... 
  i do n't know if this is just `` local crime '' . 
  the european union bodies have warned spain multiple times over the status of the catalan language . 
  and you also have the [ european charter for regional or minority languages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_charter_for_regional_or_minority_languages ) , where catalan language plays an important role ( catalan is the 9th most common language in europe , surpassing greek , swedish or croatian for instance ) . 
  and you have to take into account that the catalan language is not only spoken in catalonia , but in other regions of spain , in andorra ( only official language ) , france and italy . 
  therefore the catalan language status is something that can affect people from different places of europe . 
  but i respect if you want to remove it anyway . 
  sadly this persecution of the catalan language has been a common thing in catalonia for the last centuries , from 1714 ( catalan institutions and language suppression in favor to spanish ) to the present . 
  even the famous antoni gaud\u00ed himself was beaten and sent to prison by the spanish police for speaking in catalan ( 1924 ) . 
  and well , better not to speak about the spanish fascist dictatorship ( until late 70s ) ... 
  this article from the guardian ( [ catalan : a language that has survived against the odds ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/22/catalan-language-survived ) ) summarizes it a bit . 
  now with the democracy , in catalonia we have the fundamental right to use the catalan language and we ca n't be forced to use another language . 
  in fact , according to the article 6 of our ** statue of autonomy ** ( catalonia 's fundamental law ; like a * catalan constitution * ) :  1 . 
  catalonia 's own language is catalan . 
  as such , catalan is the language of normal and preferential use in public administration bodies and in the public media of catalonia , and is also the language of normal use for teaching and learning in the education system .
