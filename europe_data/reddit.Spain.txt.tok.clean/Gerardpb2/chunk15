  catalan is the official language of catalonia , together with castilian , the official language of the spanish state . 
  all persons have the right to use the two official languages and citizens of catalonia have the right and the duty to know them . 
  the public authorities of catalonia shall establish the necessary measures to enable the exercise of these rights and the fulfilment of this duty . 
  in keeping with the provisions of article 32 , there shall be no discrimination on the basis of use of either of the two languages . 
  in catalonia we also have the ** act no . 
  1 , of 7th january 1998 , on linguistic policy ** ( you can read it here in [ english ] ( http://llengua.gencat.cat/en/detalls/article/capitol-preliminar-00001 ) ; the preliminary chapter ) :  article 4 . 
  linguistic rights  in accordance with article 3 of the statute of autonomy , and within the context of an active policy by the generalitat to create a situation which allows linguistic rights and duties to reach full equality , everyone in catalonia is entitled :  a ) to be proficient in both official languages . 
   b ) to express themselves in either of the two official languages , verbally or in writing , in their relations as well as in private and public procedures . 
   c ) to be served in either of the two official languages in the manner laid down by this act . 
   d ) to freely use either of the two official languages in all fields . 
   e ) not to be discriminated against on account of the official language they use . 
  so now you know what the law says . 
  but as a catalan myself , i can affirm this is not the reality of catalonia . 
  many times we are `` forced '' to change to spanish on a daily basis ; relegating the catalan language into a `` secondary '' language . 
  and this is pretty sad . 
  there are constant efforts being made by the catalan institutions and the situation has improved if compared with 20 years ago . 
  but there 's still a lot of work to do ... for instance it can be easier to use the german language in a trial , than catalan ( even tho using catalan in the judiciary is a constitutional right ) . 
  there 's a ** documentary about the catalan language status ** made by a german linguist : this is the [ trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqy_fzkb50u ) with english subtitles , and the full documentary is also in youtube . 
  discriminations like these are pretty common . 
  not so long ago for instance , in a trial a lawyer wanted to use the catalan language ( a basic right ) , but the judge not only was in disagreement with this ; he even criticized the catalan language ( [ source ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20161006/41819877123/tsjc-amonesta-juez-reprochar-abogada-hablar-catalan.html ) ) . 
  spain has never accepted the reality of multiple languages in its territory . 
  at the end i believe only with an independent catalan state we will finally be able to live a `` normal '' life with our language , like the rest of the world can do . 
   i guess the same happens in france , germany , etc. 
  really ? 
  they fine you if you speak french in france or german in germany ? 
  anyway this is pure / u/rainymeadow style , some of the worst stuff you can find in reddit ... pure hate , manipulation , fascism ( you 'd be surprised how many of his comments get removed by moderation for this reason ) and anti-catalanism ( you 'll see him in every reddit post about catalonia , although he 's not catalan ) . 
  and as always , ** he 's not telling the truth ** . 
  i wrote a [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6egect/barcelona_university_teacher_fined_601_euros_for/dia7ray/ ) below where i explain what the law in catalonia says about linguistic policy rights . 
  if you want to be informed read it , and you 'll see how wrong rainymeadow is . 
  tl ; dr : in catalonia we have the fundamental right to be attended in catalan and use the catalan language whenever we want . 
  if anybody is restricted from using catalan , this is considered a discrimination . 
   i 'd be impressed if they succeed . 
  i 'm sure this has been said about the eu for the last decades . 
  with the euro for instance . 
  at the end everything is possible , 
  that 's great !, 
  we need more integration like this . 
  i 'm really looking forward to this , and also a common vat tax system ( this will help to solve the serious problems of vat fraud that costs us a lot of money ; i. e. carousel fraud ) . 
  i 'm sure if we become independent , catalonia will join too !, 
  our pro-independence leaders are 100 % pro-european integration . 
   * like frogs around a pond , we have settled down upon the shores of this sea * . 
   plato love this !, 
  that 's cool , i do n't have any of them :( i just remember there was a `` hole '' in one of the coins , and that was so funny to me at the time xd, 
  you 've been paying all your life in catalan and you did n't know !!, 
  d : now imagine if it had been in spanish : * 300 piececitas , por favor * . 
  ps : i do n't remember peseta since i was too young lol, 
  oh really !? 
  you should call the former councilor of the bank of spain and explain that to him , quickly !, 
  too long name !, 
  xd in fact we could just use the `` peseta '' , since its already in [ catalan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_peseta#etymology ) . 
  lol fish on the money ? 
  looks cool xd the colors are the same of the euros , in purpose ? 
  yep cod is popular here !, 
  no problem !, 
    they were also a part aragon before becoming a part of spain . 
  and i think you can expect more discussion after what you just said xd better to call it the `` crown of aragon '' ( a composite monarchy or confederation of individual polities ) to avoid discussions , since `` aragon '' was also part of it . 
  i 'm just going to copy this from the [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crown_of_aragon ) article just in case : * put in contemporary terms , it has sometimes been considered that the different lands of the crown of aragon ( mainly the kingdom of aragon , the principality of catalonia and the kingdom of valencia ) functioned more as a confederation than as a single kingdom . 
  in this sense , the larger crown of aragon must not be confused with one of its constituent parts , the kingdom of aragon , from which it takes its name . 
  the euro of course ... 
  he does n't talk about it , but i think it 's pretty obvious xd no member of the catalan government believes on the idea of creating a new currency . 
  it would be a very bad idea . 
  it 's been assured that in a catalan republic the official currency would be the euro ; it 's one of the issues where there 's 0 discussions about . 
  interview with the economist , university teacher and former councilor of the bank of spain . 
  it is just 2 months since he finished his mandate as a councillor of the bank of spain , after 12 years . 
   ** with the experience you have accumulated in the bank of spain , are you ready to help to create the public bank of the catalan republic ? 
  **  the law for the creation of the central bank of catalonia is already in place . 
  from what i have seen , it is a modern law , i would say more powerful than the leading organs of the bank of spain . 
  it is an * ex novo * law made by people who show that they know what they are doing , so the problems of the creation of the bank will not come from not having a good law ; they will come from spain 's reaction and what europe does about its practical application , for instance in the systems of payment , the access to liquidity , the continuity of the european central bank 's discount assets ... but the design is already in place and it would be great if everything were just a question of legalities . 
  i do n't want to interfere here ... but why you keep discussing about this ? 
  :p there 's nothing wrong with saying catalonia is a country ; maybe you do n't understand the concept of '' [ country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/country ) '' ( \u2260 sovereign state ) ? 
  in wikipedia it 's explained . 
  i know what `` country '' means because it 's a term very common here when referring to catalonia : from schools to politics it 's normal to refer to catalonia as a country or just `` the country '' . 
  that 's why in the catalan edition of wikipedia , the article [ catalonia ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalunya ) starts with the sentence : `` catalonia is an european country of the western mediterranean , currently constituted as an autonomous community of spain . '', 
  hope you understand it more now ... 
   you mean in 2014 if we are not going day by day right ? 
  no , i meant months . 
  for instance [ december 2016 ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/economia/2016/12/15/58526515ca47414a118b45de.html ) . 
  it depends on the sources . 
  i also found +100 % in april 2017 . 
  but other sources say below . 
  yep there 's no reason to discuss it more . 
  i do n't know , the way you say it sounded , at least , `` provocative '' ... 
  i agree 100 % with you , seriously i do n't have any discussion here xd as i said i was replying to an user saying this news should n't be posted in / r/europe , implying that it only matters to catalonia or spain . 
  that 's why i replied him in an european perspective . 
  catalonia is the richest region of spain , and one of the biggest economic regions in europe . 
  if catalonia economy goes well , it 's connected to all the other regions you named . 
   do n't call me a liar and then write things like '' it 's spain that has an immense debt ( +100 % of their gdp ) '' when you can easily disprove that in 1 min in google . 
  https://www.google.es/search?q=spanish+debt&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr,ssl&amp;ei=kjctwdwwhsfyuvi8h_ap oh sorry !, 
  i 'm a '' `` liar '' '' xdd i said +100 % of their gdp when in fact it 's ** 99,8 % of their gdp ** according to google !, 
  terrible lying i 'm doing !, 
  if there 's one reason to be independent is also to proof people like you wrong ( and you are not the worst at all ) . 
  there 's so many people ( spanish nationalists pseudo-economists ) lying and manipulating with the situation of an independent catalonia ; comparing it with kosovo or whatever poor country . 
  when catalonia becomes independent we will see at the end who was telling the truth , and who was n't , 
  of course it 's going to be our first attempt !, 
  the [ 2014 referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_self-determination_referendum,_2014 ) was a non-binding vote on the political future of catalonia , just to know people 's opinion . 
  now we are doing a definitive and binding referendum ( supported by more than 80 % of the catalan people ) . 
  seriously , i think it 's cool people from ireland like you being interested in what happens in my nation , but you should inform better before saying thins like this ... 
  sure ... an irish guy is going to tell us what 's going to happen with our catalan independence referendum - . -, 
  that 's not how it works ... 
  even andorra used the euro without any agreement with the eu , until recently .
