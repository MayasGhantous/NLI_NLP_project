  anyway there will be an agreement with the eu after independence obviously . 
   i hope the best for you guys you seem bipolar dude !, 
  you `` hope for the best '' but at the same time the amount of lies you said there ? 
  it 's so confusing !, 
  you portrayed a catastrophic/dystopic independent catalonia submersed in caos , extreme poverty ... that no expert agrees with . 
   the debt that they are gon na have is inmense that 's not true !, 
  it 's spain that has an immense debt ( +100 % of their gdp ) . 
  catalonia 's debt is going to be way lower than current spain 's one , that 's for sure ... 
  some of the world 's best economists are working in the independence of catalonia . 
  all the things you said have been already studied . 
  the way you speak feels like you know the `` real truth '' and the catalans are just dumb people . 
  there 's someone lying here , and it 's not the experts ... 
   nothing will happen . 
  except if the `` yes '' wins , 
  it 's common here in reddit to read people from outside catalonia telling us what `` matters '' for us ... 
  we have all figured out do n't worry  and do n't have any doubt the currency is going to be the euro , i 'm sure you could have guessed it by yourself ... this one was easy . 
  we also want to stay in the european union , 
  xd ikea is very popular here, 
  it 's also important for spain !, 
  i 'm not denying that dude . 
  i was replying to the comment ( now removed ) of an user saying this should n't be posted here because `` europeans do n't care about this '' . 
  that 's why i said i believe it 's important for europe and eu . 
  barcelona metropolitan area is the 4th most populated in the eu , surpassing berlin 's or milan 's one . 
  i think you are right  we usually just call him the president of catalonia . 
  you explained it better !, 
  i could n't find a big picture that showed the personal working office of the catalan president ; pictures are usually focused in the president itself instead of showing the room . 
  in fact in google street view that 's one of the few rooms that has been omitted ( i guess for confidentiality reasons ) from the palace virtual tour . 
  so at the end i decided to post this `` meetings room '' , which is also part of the president 's office . 
  then what do we vote for in the catalan elections ? 
  xd we have been having presidents since [ 1359 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_presidents_of_the_generalitat_de_catalunya ) .

   the luxury among politicians is not accepted here spain is the country with more official state cars in the world ( [ 22 times more than the us ] ( http://gaceta.es/noticias/los-coches-oficiales-espana-multiplican-22-los-ee-uu-27092016-0742 ) ) . 
  remember when all the mp received free ipads , internet connection for their homes , money for taxis , etc. 
  in the middle of the economic crisis ? 
  you ca n't portrait a non-existing austerity in spanish politicians . 
  only the new political parties ( like podemos ) are making a change ( renouncing to their luxuries , part of their salary , etc. ) . 
  but there 's clearly a lot to improve . 
  and well the spanish monarchy is luxury stuff everywhere ... from the [ luxury botswana hunting trips ] ( http://ep00.epimg.net/politica/videos/2012/04/14/actualidad/1334391118_898284_1334417701_fotograma_2.jpg ) to all the polemics we know ( at the ones we wo n't ever know ) . 
  and all paid by us , the citizens ... 
  you mean the modern style of the furniture ? 
  personally i like it being efficient and modern in a [ room ] ( https://www.google.es/maps/@41.3829355,2.1761675,3a,75y,184.39h,84.78t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1stp9tcx2yfyi__uswguoc8q!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) with centuries of history . 
  i also think it lacks a bit of more character/history , especially considering we are talking about a historical country like germany . 
  maybe the decoration does n't help that much ( bookshelves colour  _ < ) , but i think after all the office is pretty good . 
  on the other hand i do n't like french 's ( 100 % gilding ) or italy 's offices , where i believe the history/character part has been taken to an `` extreme '' ; compromising efficiency ( at least for my point of view , i do n't know if i would be comfortable working in any of those 2 offices ) . 
  something with equilibrium is the best : history and symbology , but efficiency at the same time . 
  i think this was pretty much achieved with the catalan president [ office ] ( http://beteve.cat/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/080914streetviewgeneralitat2r.jpg ) i posted ; despite being in a palace used since the 15th century it 's been renovated to get an efficient place to work . 
  but maybe i 'm a bit biased since i 'm catalan xd, 
  i explained in my comment :p the [ desk ] ( http://www.ara.cat/2016/02/14/dossier/que-ha-no-perque-del_1522657795_26633669_987x555.jpg ) is behind the door you see on the left side of the picture . 
  the picture is showing the most popular [ room ] ( http://beteve.cat/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/080914streetviewgeneralitat2r.jpg ) of the office . 
  the ** [ palace ] ( http://sientebarcelona.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2185377006_1e2769cf8d_o.jpg ) ** is located in the old district of * ciutat vella * in barcelona . 
  the original building was purchased in 1400 . 
  a total of 130 presidents have governed from this house , from berenguer de cru\u00eflles ( 1359 ) to the current president , carles puigdemont ( 2016 - ) . 
  although this [ hall ] ( https://www.google.es/maps/@41.3829389,2.176101,3a,75y,105.86h,86.25t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1smdgzzwpxm-abtjvbvevidq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) is also known as `` the office '' , the president 's personal and working [ office ] ( http://www.catalangovernment.eu/pres_gov/estilos/government/img/palau-generalitat/09.jpg ) is behind the door on the left side . 
  this hall currently serves as antechamber or greeting room for the president 's office ( as seen [ here ] ( http://www.ara.cat/2012/10/02/dossier/pp-psoe-ue-cdc-psc_784731585_11293368_2000x1333.jpg ) , [ here ] ( http://images.eldiario.es/catalunyaplural/artur-govern-ciu-erc-cup_ediima20140927_0334_5.jpg ) or [ here ] ( http://www.ara.cat/2017/04/09/politica/generalitat-carles-puigdemont-rohrabacher-higgins_1774632786_40063632_4000x2670.jpg ) ) .

  short answer : no . 
  your analysis is pretty distorted and you know it better than me , 
  more like `` offending '' instead of oppressing xd anyway it 's his personal opinion , let him be happy with that . 
   so if it applied to scotland why do you think it wo n't apply to catalonia ? 
  it wo n't apply to neither one . 
  you will see it when it happens , either catalonia or scotland . 
   it wo n't start from 0 you said it yourself . 
  out of the eu for 1 day , 1 week or even 1 month is nothing ; compared with the years long process of accession . 
  everything is about agreements and getting the most logical and pragmatic solution for all interests involved : in this case catalonia and scotland being eu members as fast as possible ( without leaving at all if that 's the case ) . 
  how is this a `` shitpost '' ? 
  catalan ministry of truth ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  o_o catalonia 's economy evolution is important for europe and the eu . 
  in the same way greece 's , italy 's or france 's one . 
   exactly in what way do you believe that annoying european redditors with this brainwashing propaganda contributes to the independence of catalonia ? 
  in `` any way '' \u00bf ? 
  i 'm not annoying nobody . 
  if you are annoyed with this information , just do n't read it ... it 's fine omg . 
  how is this brainwashing propaganda ? 
  can you discuss the economic results ? 
  can you provide other sources ? 
  you mean the catalan minister of economy is lying ? 
  i do n't see how `` this '' can contribute to the independence of catalonia ? 
  should it ? 
  why you ask me this seriously ... 
  the * sources/european leaders saying that * will arrive when catalonia becomes independent , not before . 
  for now catalonia ( not a state yet ) ca n't have bilateral relations with the eu . 
  i also do n't think an independent catalonia will start from zero like kosovo or bosnia and herzegovina lol . 
  it 's pretty ridiculous to think that . 
  there will be some kind of agreements/negotiation so catalonia can join the eu without going through all the accession process , as this has been discussed by experts many times . 
  but we wo n't see that until catalonia effectively becomes independent , of course . 
   at the 33th annual meeting of the [ economy circle ] ( http://circuloeconomia.org/ ) in sitges , the catalan minister of economy and finance ( oriol junqueras ) confirmed that his executive expects to ** surpass 2.7 % of annual economic growth ** . 
   the catalan minister also used the opportunity to communicate a message of calm to the economic sector , guaranteeing that '' ** catalonia will not leave the eu in case of independence ** '' since there is `` absolutely no legal mechanism that foresees this case '' . 
  along this line , he stressed the `` firm pro-european commitment '' of the catalan government and its determination of `` strengthening a common project and creating excellent relationships with neighbors , especially spain '' . 
  `` strong european institutions and a more united europe are part of the future plans of the catalan government '' as well as `` strengthening common currency and fiscal policies '' . 
   junqueras also highlighted the ** solidness of the economic growth over time ( 3.4 % in 2015 , 3.5 % in 2016 ) ** based in large part on a diversified economy sustained to a great extent by the industrial sector . 
  as an example , the catalan minister mentioned investments of $ 1.5 billion in the technological sector in the past 15 months . 
  another important figure that demonstrates the good rhythm of the catalan economy is , according to the minister , the ** reduction of the catalan deficit from 2.88 % of the gdp to 0.93 % in one year ( 2015 to 2016 ) ** , which accounts for 85 % of the deficit reductions of all the administrations in spain . 
  to achieve this , the surplus of the local administrations was an important factor , junqueras pointed out .
