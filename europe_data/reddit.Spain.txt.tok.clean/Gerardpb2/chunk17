  100 % `` el prat '' is a city . 
  `` el prat '' is also barcelona 's airport name . 
  if [ this ] ( https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2896/14215980315_6b5181cb39_b.jpg ) is the `` acuartelamiento '' you are talking about , i do n't see barcelona airport there . 
  as i said this is not how it works . 
  the spanish government has never argued as a reason for not giving el prat to catalonia , the `` military '' . 
  that 's not a reason because there 's 0 military in the airport facility . 
  i do n't think that 's the reason at all ... it 's all about money . 
   the question is i do n't know how `` that 's '' the question in a subject not related with independence . 
  the article talks about barcelona 's airport statistics , economic growth , projections , renovations/constructions , expansions , etc. . . but there 's nothing about catalan independence . 
  anyway i 'm going to answer : yep of course . 
  in fact the catalan government has been asking for the airport management for decades . 
  but the spanish government does n't want to lose control on barcelona 's airport . 
  you have to take into account that barcelona 's airport alone is financially sustaining almost all the other airports in spain . 
  in fact [ barcelona 's airport generates 12 times more money than madrid 's one ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/economia/2015/03/27/55156294ca4741624d8b4587.html ) , despite having received much less investment . 
  this [ graph ] ( http://economia.elpais.com/economia/imagenes/2015/03/27/actualidad/1427445127_484600_1427456371_sumario_grande.png ) showing the profits of all the airports in spain is self-explanatory . 
  the way spain administrates the airports ( centralized ; all controlled/governed from madrid ) is ridiculous . 
  no developed country in the world does it . 
  there 's only one country comparable with the same airports management model as spain , and that 's romania ... 
  this obsolete model is bad compared with the usa , germany , france , etc. 
  models . 
  airports should be managed as `` companies '' , so barcelona airport can - for instance - compete for better and more routes than madrid or paris ; investing in better services and facilities to attract more clients , etc. 
  there 's no competition when all airports are administrated from madrid . 
  i 'm still waiting for catalonia being able to administrate the airport , instead of being controlled from madrid and receiving much less investment that it needs ( despite all the insane amount of money it generates ) . 
  but yeah it seems this situation is not going to change until we get independence xd, 
  see also : [ list of the busiest airports in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_busiest_airports_in_europe )  barcelona 's el prat airport registered 32.2 million international passengers last year . 
  those good results last year are not enough . 
  barcelona is looking to take a huge intercontinental leap forward in 2017 . 
  ** madrid-barajas is still the main spanish airport , with 36.1 million passengers , but el prat is growing much faster . 
  **  the new routes that are being launched in the next few weeks include norwegian 's new flights to ** buenos aires ** ; cathay pacific 's route to ** hong kong ** ; level 's ( a new airline from iag group ) flights to ** los angeles ** , ** oakland ** and buenos aires ; korean airlines ' to ** seoul ** ; mahan air 's to ** teheran ** ; azores airlines ' to ** boston ** ; american airlines ' to ** chicago ** ; and latham airlines ' to ** lima ** . 
  also , air china will expands its connections between barcelona and shanghai to all year round . 
   according to the air traffic observatory , ** 1.3 million more seats will be offered this summer compared to last year . 
  ** vueling is still the main airline , but its growth is slower than other companies . 
   airport management is ** especially interested in increasing connections to asia ** , a huge market with a bright future . 
  asian companies such as qatar airways , emirates , and cathay pacific are the ones with the biggest planes . 
  currently , emirates is flying twice a day from barcelona with the biggest commercial plane , the airbus 380 , which accommodates 1,034 passengers . 
   the new connections are another step towards making this facility a true intercontinental hub and promoting barcelona and catalonia worldwide as a magnet for investment and economic growth opportunities . 
   but is el prat-barcelona airport prepared to grow this fast ? 
   [ ... ] the complete article : [ cna ] ( http://www.catalannewsagency.com/business/item/is-barcelona-airport-prepared-to-become-an-international-hub ), 
  this ** engraving ** was made by the german cartographer [ joseph friderich leopold ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/joseph_friedrich_leopold ) ( augsburg 1668 -- 1726 augsburg ) , published in augsburg c. 1720 . 
  it shows a rare birdseye view of barcelona , including a decorative coat of arms ( [ coat of arms of catalonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_catalonia ) ; adopted in the 12th century ) and a key listing 24 important places within the view . 
  -------- the ** port of barcelona ** has a 2000-year history and great [ contemporary ] ( http://content.portdebarcelona.cat/cntmng/d/d/workspace/spacesstore/74246621-7a7c-42e0-9660-7622eaacbe9e/2016-portbcn-fotoaeria-8k.jpg ) commercial importance as one of europe 's ports in the mediterranean . 
  it 's also the [ leading ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_busiest_cruise_ports_by_passengers ) european cruiser port and a mediterranean turnaround base ; busiest cruise port by passengers in europe and 6th in the world ( only surpassed by the caribbean ones ) : 2,68 million passengers in 2016 . 
  that 's cool :d interesting to see the difference between baix pened\u00e8s ( one of the lowest ) vs alt pened\u00e8s ( one of the highest ) . 
   within those 7 years a lot of technological advancements are possible making the setup ` outdated ' before it 's running . 
  i do n't know if outdated , but considering hubble 's successor will already be there ( [ james webb space telescope ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james_webb_space_telescope ) ) , i believe the european one is not going to get that much of attention . 
  specially when one of the main uses of the james webb space telescope will be to study the atmospheres of exoplanets , to search for the building blocks of life elsewhere in the universe . 
  so when the video says `` the elt may make the first discovery of life beyond the solar system '' ... 
  i do n't know . 
  please do it !, 
  we do n't have these things here and i wan to see them . 
  barcelona is fairy tale :p, 
  looks so cold :p, 
  tossa de mar is a municipality located about 103 kilometres north of barcelona and 100 kilometres south of the french border . 
  -------- the `` vila vella enceinte '' is the only example of a fortified medieval town still standing on the catalan coast . 
  its present appearance dates back to the end of the 14th century . 
  it still has the entire original perimeter with battlemented stone walls , four turrets and three cylindrical towers with parapets . 
  at the highest point , where the lighthouse stands today , was , until the beginning of the 19th century , the castle of the abbot of the monastery santa maria de ripoll , the territorial lord of the town . 
  the interior of the old town is a charming place with narrow , cobblestoned streets , the governor 's house ( now the municipal museum ) , the house of holy cloth ( `` sant drap '' ) , a medieval hospital , and remnants of a romanesque church and a gothic church .

  my blue catalonia < 3 it 's great the whole nation being blue , not only the capital as in other countries . 
  but i would like a more detailed map ( i.e. 
  [ comarques ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/comarques_de_catalunya.svg ) ) to analyze the differences between regions : big cities , countryside , mountains , littoral , etc. 
  [ provinces ] ( https://sites.google.com/a/inscassa.cat/4-provincies-de-catalunya/_/rsrc/1454193588240/home/mapa-catalunya.gif ) are a pretty useless/arbitrary division imposed by spain ; specially when rural villages located +100 km away from barcelona are included in the province of barcelona despite the obvious differences . 
  even [ vegueries ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/pla_territorial_general_de_catalunya#/media/file:%c3%80mbits_de_catalunya_abril_2016.png ) would work way better . 
  the idea of the catalan government is to transition from the 4 current provinces to the 8 vegueries , but we are still waiting for spain agreement ... 
  this is a problem we find in many wikipedias : bots . 
  creating articles non-stop to climb the `` ladder '' of wikipedias with more articles . 
  at the end this means nothing , because quality \u2260 quantity . 
  and it can be a serious issue for wikipedia servers . 
  * this happens with the ** swedish wikipedia ** : 3rd wiki by articles | with only 2,805 active users ( 16th wiki by active users ) . 
  * compared with a no-bot policy like the ** german wikipedia ** : 4rd wiki by articles | with 19,063 active users ( 2nd wiki by active users ) . 
  * another extreme case is the ** cebuano wikipedia ** : 2nd wiki by articles | with only 140 active users !!, 
  even less active users than the [ latin wikipedia ] ( https://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/vicipaedia:pagina_prima ) ( an extinct language ) , with 148 active users . 
  that 's why many years ago the wikimedia foundation changed the criteria used to display the 10 wikipedias that conform the general website : https://www.wikipedia.org/ as you can see it 's no longer ranked by number of articles ; instead it 's taken into account other factors like the amount of users and activity . 
  that 's why we see the chinese wikipedia on the list ( most spoken language in the world ) , despite being the 15th wikipedia by number of articles . 
  however it 's obvious there still are some wikipedias that see `` number of articles '' as a competition between other wikipedias , and take it to the extreme ( * ehem cebuano * ) . 
  you can `` already '' see them . 
  of course not against us , for now ( and i do n't think in the future even if we declare independence lol ) . 
  here you have a [ twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/tancsadiagonal ) account that compiles all tanks sighting in barcelona , just in case . 
  [ this ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/card_img/867408137221021702/gfbz0-gs?format=jpg&amp;name=800x419 ) is a major barcelona street ( `` diagonal '' ) a couple days ago . 
  yep , they have tanks . 
  in fact there 's a [ twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/tancsadiagonal ) account that compiles all tanks sighting in barcelona , just in case . 
  i have already [ answered ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6cm0ka/catalonia_to_immediately_declare_independence_if/dhvtjy8/ ) this question when asked the same . 
  some outsiders might think `` everything is about money '' , but that 's not true ... 
  think why do you have a country and all the `` good '' things that come from it . 
  what for you might seem `` normal '' ( for example not having any problem when speaking greek in greece ) it is not for us . 
  we live in a historical nation ( catalonia ) currently stateless . 
  i would like to enjoy the same rights you have in your country , so me and my descendants can finally live in a [ catalan republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_republic ) . 
  at the end everything is about well-being and happiness , 
  what is we do n't agree with ? 
  that 's nice to hear !, 
   of course there 's people in spain that agree with a referendum on independence in catalonia , like podemos political party for instance . 
  in the same way in catalonia more than 80 % of population want to vote in a referendum , but not all of them want to vote `` yes '' for independence . 
  i usually encounter on this sub pretty * hostile * spaniards , many of them end up having their comments removed my moderation ( i do n't want to say their names or the content of the stuff they say ; they will end up showing on this conversation anyway ) . 
  but i did n't had the opportunity to meet spaniards supporting the referendum on this sub ; people like you that do n't want catalonia to leave of course , that 's logical , but support a democratic solution for the catalonia-spain problem . 
  at the end i believe this position is the best for spain and for the people , like you , who do n't want an independent catalonia . 
  the * hostile * position the spanish government has against the referendum actually means more people in catalonia becoming angry against spain . 
  we all know how the pp has contributed to a considerable rise in the independence support here in catalonia . 
  [ wow ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/ehhugd0nbyyxo/giphy.gif ), 
  i have never met a spaniard supporting the referendum here on this sub ... would you be the first ?
