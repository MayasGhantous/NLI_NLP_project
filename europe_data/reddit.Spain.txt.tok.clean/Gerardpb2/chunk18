  but albert rivera is not part of the spanish government ... and well we know albert rivera way too much here in catalonia , and all his `` marketing/manipulation '' tactics . 
  he is not that good at debates as he might seem . 
  rajoy would send his soraya , like always , to cover his shoulders . 
  soraya is good at debates , but maybe a little too much authoritarian sometimes when she talks . 
  we 've already had these debates 1000 times here in catalonia . 
  if a referendum on independence on this year is finally confirmed , i 'm sure we are going to have more of them , with economists from both sides and all the stuff . 
  at the end is `` us '' , the catalans , who will decide of course . 
  but a debate with the country we might get the independence from ( spain ) would be cool for me too . 
  and that 's something that we have never seen here . 
  debate about the status , relations between an independent catalonia-spain , etc. 
  president vs president . 
  are you ready to be massively downvoted by spaniards ? 
  that would be cool !, 
  i mean here in catalonia we 've been having televised debates about the independence for years . 
  i remember in my university from time to time they invited economists/jurists in favor vs economists/jurists against independence to debate about catalonia 's independence and a future [ catalan republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_republic ) . 
  but a televised debate spanish president vs catalan president about catalonia 's independence would be so cool !, 
  anyway we know it wo n't happen , since the spanish government wo n't accept this debate . 
  and we all know how bad spanish president is at debates , so to avoid embarrassment he would n't even go xd, 
  just [ today ] ( http://www.abc.es/espana/abci-cospedal-estamos-dispuestos-impedir-5447715984001-20170525020012_video.html ) the ** spanish defense minister ** said '' * we will stop by all possible means ballot boxes being put out there * '' . 
  she also warned that '' * anyone who manufacture ballot boxes , put out ballot boxes , or offer spaces as polling stations will face the consequences * '' . 
  as a catalan myself i ca n't be more fed up with spain right now ... 
  bear in mind it 's going to be really hot in summer ( it is already right now ) , so walking/visiting during midday is not going to be very `` pleasant '' let 's say . 
  specially if you are not used to this weather . 
  i 'm same age as your group , so i guess you maybe would want to live barcelona 's nightlife and wo n't be up early next morning to explore all the cultural stuff ? 
  xd considering you are only going 5 days is hard to make a list of things . 
  i also imagine you would want to spend ( weather will `` oblige '' you ) time in the beaches some days . 
  so having said that and knowing that you are `` average semi-interested '' in cultural stuff i guess you wo n't be visiting this church for example ( * do n't kill me santa maria del mar lovers * ) , unless you appear to be there when wandering around the old city . 
  specially when you would be already visiting other top must-visit churches . 
  i would say top recommended : * ** sagrada fam\u00edlia ** ( under construction until 2026 ) : it 's wonderful from outside , but i would recommend going inside too ( you wo n't see another church like this anywhere in the world ) . 
  it 's not cheap at all going inside ( 15 $ cheapest ticket without including the towers visit ) , since you are paying for the construction with the money ; so think about it . 
  also if you plan to go inside buy the tickets [ online ] ( http://www.sagradafamilia.org/en/ ) , before going there ; otherwise you will wait in line for hours . 
  * ** park g\u00fcell ** * ** gothic quarter ** : including the barcelona cathedral and all the stuff there * ** passeig de gr\u00e0cia avenue ** + ** pla\u00e7a catalunya ** + ** ramblas ** ( from there you reach the beach zone , with columbus monument ) : including gaud\u00ed 's masterpieces like casa batll\u00f3 and pedrera . 
  * ** camp nou museum + tour ** ? 
  : if you like football you might want to go , even if you are not that much into it it 's considered a worth visit . 
  it 's the most visited museum in the city , so this says it all xd . 
  * ** beaches zone ** : do n't be like other tourists and use sunscreen , seriously ... * from here , you can add whatever you feel like , depending on your free-time , from one of the `` top things to do list '' like [ tripadvisor ] ( https://www.tripadvisor.nl/attractions-g187497-activities-barcelona_catalonia.html#attraction_sort_wrapper ) 's one . 
  you have lots of museums and cultural attraction to choose . 
  * as a personal `` recommendation '' , only if you really like amusement parks ( i love them ) , i would recommend visiting [ portaventura ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portaventura_world ) ( south in the catalan coast ) , one of the largest amusement parks in europe . 
  specially now that this april they opened ferrari land ; the second amusement centre themed to ferrari in the world , after ferrari world theme park in abu dhabi . 
  hope it helps !, 
  i also [ posted ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6au41s/palau_de_la_m%c3%basica_catalana_barcelona/ ) about it , 
  [ cup ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/popular_unity_candidacy ) is not part of the catalan government . 
  that 's why i said the `` most part ''  the big catalan pro-independence political parties are the [ catalan european democratic party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_european_democratic_party ) and the [ republican left of catalonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republican_left_of_catalonia ) . 
  both of them won last elections . 
  cup in the other hand is the smallest political party that managed to enter the parliament ( only 1 mp less than pp political party , current ruling party in spain ) . 
  yep , the most part of them are . 
  the catalan government ( pro-independence ) is 100 % pro-eu . 
  ** introduction ** santa maria del mar ( * saint mary of the sea * ) is an imposing church in the ribera district of barcelona , built between 1329 and 1383 at the height of catalonia 's maritime and mercantile preeminence . 
  it is an outstanding example of [ catalan gothic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_gothic ) , with a purity and unity of style that is very unusual in large medieval buildings . 
  ----------------- ** history ** the first mention of a church of santa maria by the sea dates from 998 . 
  construction work started on 25 march 1329 , when the foundation stone was laid by king alfonso iv of aragon ( iii of catalonia ) , as commemorated by a tablet in latin and catalan on the fa\u00e7ade that faces the fossar de les moreres . 
  the architects in charge were berenguer de montagut ( designer of the building ) and ramon despuig , and during the construction all the guilds of the ribera quarter were involved . 
  the [ 1428 catalonia earthquake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1428_catalonia_earthquake ) caused several casualties and destroyed the rose window in the west end . 
  ----------------- ** curiosity ** the construction of santa maria del mar is the background for the best-selling historical novel [ * cathedral of the sea * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cathedral_of_the_sea ) , by ildefonso falcones ( 2006 ) .

  maybe you should explain it to the president of spain , because even him did n't know what will happen with spanish nationality when catalonia becomes independent  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-s03bupx4cg, 
   you are n't a democrat , just a nationalist enthusiastic about mob rule ... sure of course !, 
  all the catalan people that want to vote in a referendum ( +80 % of catalonia 's population ) are just `` nationalist enthusiastic ... '' . 
  i guess like scotland and quebec people right ? 
  you did n't even answered me , and instead evaded the question while talking about reforming the spanish constitution ( which has nothing to do with a referendum on independence in catalonia ) . 
  you do n't need to reform the spanish constitution ( a long process , where the whole population of spain must vote in referendum ) to let catalonia have a referendum on independence . 
  why are you afraid of answering ? 
  `` i am not a democrat '' , but of course you are , right ? 
  come on ... 
   sure , we would help all those who wish to remain spanish of course . 
  you do n't need to do it , the spanish civil code and spanish constitution already do it . 
  when independent we will add the catalan nationality , while also having the spanish one  you have more info for no-jurists [ here ] ( http://www.democresia.es/politica-espanola/cataluna/cataluna-nacionalidad-independencia-y-la-ley/ ), 
  it 's fine thanks for your comment  let 's see what happens at the end !, 
  probably xd i posted this because when a month ago i posted the announcement of barcelona 's candidacy , many redditors said the city would n't be selected because of catalonia independence . 
  in fact some redditors said the city could n't be selected just for this single reason ( possible independence ) ; and all the other factors would n't be considered ( like location , pharma sector in the city , etc. ) . 
  i shared this article since i thought it was interesting what the spanish minister of health explained when she was talking about the candidacy with eu officials , and she pointed how the `` independence issue '' was n't an issue during talks with eu comission and council staff . 
  apart from this , the article is nothing more . 
   or do you start arranging a series of transition agreements , through bilateral talks that minimize the longer term impact , while creating areas of commonality that will endure into the accession procedures ? 
  you are discussing with spaniards that hate the idea of an independent catalonia . 
  everything when talking with them is gon na be bad with an independent catalonia . 
  everything . 
  seriously trying to rationalize with them is impossible in this issue . 
  they `` think '' an eu region since 1986 , with +7 million eu citizens , with some eu agencies ( like one from euratom ) , with millions in investment from other eu companies/citizens , etc. . . when declared independent will instantly become an isolated region from the eu and starting all the way from 0 , like kossovo or bosnia and herzegovina . 
  that 's your opinion , and i respect it . 
  i live in catalonia and i have studied pretty much all related with the independence ( spanish laws suck for foreign investment ; and saying with an independent catalonia would be bad is difficult , considering how bad spain does it already ) , but i know you wo n't believe me . 
  and that 's fine . 
  anyway do n't share an article written by someone who : * 1st . 
  is not economist * 2nd . 
  is a politician member of an anti independence political party . 
  and read all the other economists and studies that not only support the idea of an independent catalonia , but explain why it would exponentially increase the catalan economy ( including international investment of course ) . 
  you have the columbia/harvard/yale american professor of economics [ xavier sala-i-martin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/xavier_sala-i-martin ) for instance , who has written books and make conferences about the economics in an independent catalonia . 
   i know you did n't mention me because you are not complaining/criticizing/insulting < 3 it 's logical !, 
  if you have friends/family or whatever in catalonia , you are interested with the things that happen here . 
  i wonder if that 's the case of the people i named ... 
  is really that difficult to * accept * the people of catalonia deciding what they want for them and their nation ? 
  seriously think about it xd i do n't know where are you from ( not aragon , ok ) , but i 'm 100 % fine with whatever you and your region decide in a democratic way . 
  why ca n't you do the same with the others ? 
   the situation is , as of now , still unclarified and we 're still waiting for a political precedent or a thorough legal opinion . 
  as i explained many times : * we will know what will happen when it finally happens * . 
  you ca n't expect european states or the european union itself to express an opinion about catalonia , when it is not even a country yet , but an spanish `` internal matter '' . 
  all the positions/opinions we see today , wo n't be the same if catalonia becomes a country in the future . 
  there are lots of interests in place , and at the end the most logical/pragmatical solution will betaken . 
  what it 's obvious is that spain would be the first one interested in catalonia joining the eu , since the majority of the commerce spain-eu currently goes through catalonia ( spain 's gateway to europe ) . 
  and of course catalonia wo n't accept paying part of the spanish debt if spain does n't let catalonia joining the eu . 
  anyway this is all speculation ...
