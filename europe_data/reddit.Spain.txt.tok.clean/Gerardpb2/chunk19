  sometimes i wonder what 's wrong with people like you ... seriously it 's so weird . 
  you , rainymeadow , permafrost , veracius , btyi , etc. 
  if you are not even catalan ... why spaniards like you care so much about everything me or other redditors post about catalonia ? 
  you literally are on every post i make about catalonia xd not even expressing opinion : in general you are all just complaining , criticizing , insulting , etc. 
  i guess you are from aragon , right ? 
  dude you can post everything you want about aragon . 
  you wo n't see me there all the time complaining !, 
  i do n't care whatever you post about your region . 
  but why do you care so much about catalonia ? 
   and the mods wo n't do anything . 
  wow so you can lie and insult people , but hey the mods should do `` something '' with me ? 
  no ... that 's not what the article says dude o.o, 
  take the conclusions you want dude xd weeks ago when discussing barcelona 's candidacy with other european redditors , some said it wo n't be selected because of the political status in catalonia ( possible referendum/independence ) . 
  i think it 's interesting to share spanish minister of health opinion , were she explains that during talks with the eu commission , counci and others , `` no one had raised the issue of independence '' . 
   the spanish minister of health , dolors montserrat , defended on wednesday that the current political debate in catalonia , where the government plans to hold an independence referendum in autumn , does not damage barcelona 's candidacy to host the new headquarters of the european medicines agency . 
  in comments to the press from brussels , where she was holding meetings with health commissioner , vytenis andriukaitis , and the secretary-generals of the commission and the council , montserrat said that `` no one '' had raised the issue of independence . 
  `` we are the government of all catalans and we want the ema in barcelona . 
  i am strongly convinced that ( the independence debate ) does not affect this at all . 
  no one has asked me about it , '' she insisted . 
  the ema needs to relocate from london after brexit , and several european cities -- including barcelona , amsterdam , lisbon , and milan -- want to become its new headquarters . 
   dolors montserrat said that the catalan capital is already `` ready '' to host the ema 's 900 staff members at the iconic torre agbar building `` without disrupting operations '' and while `` maintaining current talent '' . 
  `` we can offer a smooth relocation process , '' added montserrat , who denied that barcelona 's candidacy should be rejected on the grounds that spain already hosts three other european agencies in vigo , bilbao , and alacant . 
  `` we are not talking about creating a new agency , but relocating one that has already been working since 1992 , '' she said , pointing out that if other member states with no agencies want to attract ema they should demonstrate that they have `` the infrastructure , the connectivity and the facilities '' ready . 
  `` we are prepared , '' she said , adding : `` ema staff could move in tomorrow . ''  `` we are the best option , the best city , the best country , because we fulfill each of the criteria set by the european commission and the european council , '' montserrat explained . 
  a document circulating amongst member states since the beginning of the week defines the following criteria to decide which city should host the ema : the assurance that the agency can be set up on site and commence operations at the same time as brexit happens ; the accessibility of the location ; the existence of adequate education facilities for the children of agency staff ; appropriate access to the labor market , social security and medical care for both children and spouses ; business continuity and geographical spread . 
   `` we are working in coordination with the barcelona city hall and the catalan government . 
  what is good for barcelona is good for catalonia , and what is good for catalonia is good for spain and europe , '' said montserrat , dismissing concerns about the implications of the political stalemate between the catalan and spanish governments on the issue of independence . 
  the spanish president , mariano rajoy , warned some weeks ago that any `` instability '' could damage barcelona 's candidacy . 
   `` every member state knows that our candidacy is serious , strong , and competitive , '' underscored the spanish health minister , who is catalan herself . 
  montserrat asked the eu to take a decision `` quickly '' and in a `` transparent '' manner in order to `` protect the wellbeing of all europeans '' . 
  the minister also pointed out that barcelona was the second option after london to host the ema when it was created back in 1992 . 
  `` if we were prepared then , we are even better prepared now , '' she assured . 
  the decision on the relocation of ema will be taken by eu member states in october .

  you also have 5 % of catalan people who consider themselves to be `` more spaniard than catalan '' , whereas you have 22,6 % of catalans who consider `` more catalan than spaniard '' . 
  to sum up the statistics : * if 1 = only spaniard * if 5 = only catalan -  the mean/average of the catalan population = 3,52 ( march 2017 ) from this you can take the conclusions you want . 
  but remember feeling spaniard , does n't mean to be against independence . 
  that 's why organizations like [ s\u00famate ] ( https://www.sumate.cat/ ) exist ; an organization founded by spanish-speaking citizens that emigrated to catalonia from various parts of spain , and many of them still have family living in parts of spain , but they want an independent catalonia because they believe that 's the best for them and their future generations . 
  here we go with the fake news again ... el pa\u00eds wo n't stop publishing this stuff . 
  in fact it 's curious all the effort they make to translate all this news into english , when they usually only translate very few articles . 
   the regional government of catalonia says in a document the details of which were published by el pa\u00cds on monday the government of catalonia already denied the veracity of this `` document '' . 
  but el pa\u00eds keeps talking about this `` document '' as if it was something real . 
  here in reddit many of these el pa\u00eds news were already removed for this reason , like [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6csxiv/the_catalan_government_will_control_the_media_for/ ) one from yesterday . 
   a poll commissioned by el pa\u00cds shows that only 35 % of catalans support this option i 'm not saying all the catalans will support this , but at this point coming from el pa\u00eds ... 
  specially when the [ last official poll ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7cdua3u.png ) shows that just 7,6 % of the catalan people consider themselves to be `` only spaniards '' . 
  whereas 23,3 % of catalans consider themselves to be `` only catalans '' . 
  but with the bad weather they have there ... how is this even considered ? 
  wtf you saying ? 
  i am a catalan and that 's not true at all !, 
  have you ever been to catalonia in the first place ? 
  that hate ... 
   it 's written by a law professor in barcelona . 
  except he was born and studied in northern spain , not in catalonia/barcelona . 
  and the fact he is the president of a right-wing anti-catalanism association with many radical sectors involved , which its main objective is prevent catalonia from declaring independence ... sure we can take this article seriously xd, 
   fuck catalonia . 
  thanks !, 
   it 's the only thing that matters here anyways , f\u00fatbol yeah sure ... - . -, 
  you are definitely trolling ... from el mundo to 20minutos every newspaper says the same . 
  even [ intereconom\u00cda ] ( https://intereconomia.com/tendencias/entretenimiento/futbol-mas-importante-asi-informan-13tv-del-atentado-manchester-20170523-1403/ ) , where the presentator used to work before said the same, 
   he does n't even say what the title says wtffffff xddddd dude spanish is my mother tongue ... do you even speak spanish ? 
  have you even watched the video where he literally says that ?? 
  mhmmmm are you sure you wanted to comment here ? 
  i think you mixed up dude , i do n't know what are you talking about at all xd, 
  i do n't know if germany would accept a tv channel were hitler is praised in the name of `` freedom of the press '' ps : for spanish-speaking readers you have an [ intereconomia greatest hits ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-iy4yr-wcy&amp;t=422s ) collection ... 
  none of the presenters are sports presenters . 
  in fact the tv show ( `` el cascabel '' ) is a current affairs tertulia about politics and opinion journalism . 
  * news about explosions in manchester arena are being reported * - ** antonio jim\u00e9nez ** : is manchester arena the stadium of manchester united or manchester city ? 
  no , right ? 
  - ** francisco marhuenda ** : there are more important things than football * ( while laughing ) * - ** antonio jim\u00e9nez ** : no way !, 
  football is the most important thing !, 
  and the real madrid way more !, 
  * ( while laughing too ) * for those who do n't know , 13tv is a ( small ) tv channel owned by the [ spanish episcopal conference ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_episcopal_conference ) . 
  13tv is known for its right-wing , ultracatholicism , conservatism and anti-catalanism coverage . 
  do n't even try to discuss with him ... this user is some random spaniard , who probably has never been to catalonia , and is constantly trying to manipulate/attack anything related with catalonia . 
  why he does that ? 
  hate i guess ... today i read a comment by him ( currently removed by moderation ) where he argued how '' * present catalonia oppresses more the spanish language than the franco dictatorship did with the catalan * '' . 
  this sentence pretty much sums up everything about him ... 
   with franco there was 5 hours per week of catalan language at the school , but they could n't even speak it in public , sure thing . 
   just in case you are wondering , nowadays , in 2017 , there is only 2 hours of spanish language in the catalan schools , who opresses who ? 
  i would love to frame your disrespectful comment and show it to the people here in catalonia . 
  people like you are the ones who create more catalan pro-independence followers , with all the bullshit you said right there ... 
   catalonia will celebrate an independence referendum no matter what happens . 
  this is the message that catalan president , carles puigdemont , vice president , oriol junqueras , and foreign affairs minister , ra\u00fcl romeva , defended during their conference in madrid on monday . 
   `` we wo n't leave the negotiating table without an agreement and we will wait until the last minute '' to achieve one , promised puigdemont , urging the spanish government to engage in discussions . 
  `` i invite you to address this issue seriously and meaningfully , '' the catalan president asked his spanish counterpart , mariano rajoy , adding that it would be `` irresponsible '' not to offer a `` serious , real , and sincere '' solution to the catalans ' demands . 
  puigdemont also warned that his government `` will never '' give up the catalans ' democratic right to self-determination . 
  vice president oriol junqueras also stressed that the referendum will take place even if the members of government face `` prosecution , are banned from office or are convicted '' . 
  more info : [ cna ] ( http://www.catalannewsagency.com/politics/item/we-will-hold-the-referendum ), 
   that 's call post-truth , nowadays , right ? 
  precisely this night on catalan tv we have a documentary about the '' [ post-truth ] ( http://www.ccma.cat/tv3/sense-ficcio/veritats-de-mentida/fitxa/fitxa-programa/27205/117400/ ) '' phenomenon xd, 
  of course when the law exists , we all will be able to discuss it !, 
  even the user ( * rainymeadow * ) that posted this , already said [ yesterday ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6cm0ka/catalonia_to_immediately_declare_independence_if/dhvoc1o/ ) we should n't believe them ... 
  they had all these news prepared and posted them right after psoe 's primaries result ( pedro s\u00e1nchez winning was n't welcomed at el pa\u00eds xd ) . 
  anyway here you have catalan government reaction : * '' [ it is fake and it has nothing to do with the legislative proposals we are preparing ] ( http://www.elnacional.cat/ca/politica/jxsi-falsedat-esborrany-llei-transitorietat_160353_102.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=post ) '' *, 
  i already replied to you  tl ; dr : the law does n't exist ... 
   what the law does entail then so i can make a more informed judgement ? 
  the `` law '' does n't entail anything , because it does n't exist . 
  all started yesterday when el pa\u00eds spanish media said they had access to a `` secret draft of a future catalan independence law '' . 
  from this `` secret draft '' they started making news about all of this . 
  but the catalan government right after the news , denied the veracity of the draft .
