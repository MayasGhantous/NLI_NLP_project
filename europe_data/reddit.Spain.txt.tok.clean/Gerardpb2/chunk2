  if you are more left you vote erc or psc ( psoe in spain ) , csqp ( including podemos in spain ) . 
  but we usually ( at least me ) do n't see that much this left-center-right stuff in catalonia , since we vote more in the catalanism aspect of the parties . 
  and the right-left is so diluted here ( that 's why the largest catalan parties ciu and erc joined together to form a party , current ruling-party of catalonia , something impossible to think with pp and psoe in spain ) . 
   in the areas that i live in , they fill the centre vote together with psoe . 
  so voters from the center inclined towards more workers rights go for psoe and the ones inclined to a more liberal economy go for c 's . 
  interesting !, 
  i hope one day some politics expert will write a book about ciudadanos , analyzing it as a political maneuver/tactic . 
  because there 's a lot to explain !, 
  until 2015 c 's only had 9/135 mp in the catalan parliament . 
  they needed 10 years to reach that point , after foundation in 2006 . 
  so how did they manage to do the `` spain conquest '' in almost no time , considering spain is way larger than catalonia ? 
  after the fiasco of 2008 ( 0 mp ) and not even trying in 2011 . 
  how they went for it in 2015 and succeeded ? 
  in `` raglan '' 's video is explained a bit , how they basically started acquiring parties ( specifically absorbing everything upyd had across spain ; and some right-wing minor parties ) . 
  i know podemos helped them a lot , the anti-podemos tactic was gold for them . 
  i find really interesting what you explain from where you live , showing how ciudadanos managed to find its place between psoe and obtain results . 
   he has videos defending venezuela , the ussr ... mmmm i did n't know about that . 
  i 've only seen his * ciudadanos * video i shared you , which again , i believe it 's a pretty good video ( with a lot of compilation work behind ) , and that 's why it gained so much popularity ( i believe it also appeared on tv , on the news like antena 3 and la sexta ) . 
  it 's weird seeing a politics self-made video with millions of views on youtube , specially in spain . 
  but yeah , just by the tone of the video one can see he 's more on the left side of politics and probably a podemos voter . 
  i do n't think this should be a `` bad thing '' ; i mean i prefer him making the video than a c 's supporter . 
  but of course i would n't watch his videos about venezuela and ussr , since i know i would n't be getting the full picture . 
  i know ciudadanos pretty well , and i have met close people in the party , from where i know that many of the things on the video are true . 
  i believe the content is not about `` opinions '' ( in fact when i watched the video back in 2015 i felt i was n't learning anything new about the party , since i already knew almost everything showed lol ) . 
  on the other hand i have 0 clue about recent world history , so when watching videos of venezuela or the ussr i could n't know if i 'm being fooled or what . 
  but i totally understand what you say , it 's comprehensible  ps : i know traditional c 's voters ( some inside the party ) and they are far from the centre . 
  i do n't want to call them far-right , but let 's just say `` clarifying right '' . 
  but yeah catalonia is another story in politics . 
  c 's used the podemos card to expand to spain , as the `` alternative to podemos '' and the `` new politics '' , when in fact they were n't new at all ( did you know c 's already presented in [ 2008 elections of spain ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/elecciones_generales_de_espa%c3%b1a_de_2008#congreso ) with albert rivera , and only gained 0,18 % of votes and 0 mp ? ) . 
  when c 's appeared in catalonia back in 2006 they did n't had the `` podemos card '' , so the strategy was another story . 
   i never mentioned pp and i do n't know how is relevant it 's relevant because pp also abandoned the parliament before voting , at the same time c 's was leaving . 
  but you do n't seem to have an explanation why pp left , only for c 's . 
   they have voted similar resolutions before and after , you can look for it . 
  i know ( they have done it on tv and other places ) , but they did n't do it that day in the catalan parliament . 
  and it 's fine if you do n't care , but i care . 
  there 's not a voting against francoism and nazism every day in the catalan parliament , in fact it probably will be the only time in history this has been voted . 
  and they knew it was important , yet they both decided to leave . 
  and that 's sad . 
  i 'm not saying they are fascists , but the fact they both should acknowledge the consequences of their actions . 
  again , you simply do n't leave before voting something so important like that . 
  i 'm sure you learn this at 1st year of politics school . 
  and i 'm sure albert river ( he studied marketing politics in fact ) and c 's knew it 100 % , yet they decided to leave and not be in the parliament that day . 
  have a nice day . 
   i was finding the video interesting i thought you had already watched it before !, 
  it became pretty famous at that time prior to the elections . 
  i do n't think they just `` take one sentence from here , one picture from there and without any context '' ... the video is already pretty long , so they summarize a bit . 
  but i believe it 's well explained and with sources ( indicating the date ) . 
  i seriously think it 's one of the best existing videos to know more about ciudadanos and albert rivera , behind their `` lack of definition '' they usually like to show in public . 
  specially for people outside of catalonia , because we 've been living with them for more than a decade . 
  and of course the spanish version you see today is better than what it was when it started in catalonia , with fauna like `` el yoyas '' and company , and many scandals ( specially related with far-right influences ) . 
   but then i checked his last video dude i think it 's obvious this video is a joke ... that does n't mean this guy ( raglan ) ca n't make really good and serious videos , like the one from ciudadanos xd the ending of this video i sent you is also a [ joke ] ( https://youtu.be/v-jlz5frt88?t=15m3s ) if you noticed ... but that does n't mean the whole video is a `` joke '' . 
  look at the number of views and the comments . 
  sure ... of course ... they were n't insulted . 
  i watched the whole video . 
  and why did pp also leave the hemicycle then , if according to you c 's were insulted ? 
  you do n't leave the parliament for `` being insulted '' . 
  specially you do n't leave the parliament just before a vote against francoism and nazism . 
  seriously , i 'm sure mp are not that stupid . 
  if you leave , attend to the consequences : being seen as a fascist . 
  it 's extremely rare seeing the whole mp of a party leaving the parliament in the middle of the session ( never happens in catalonia ) , what a coincidence it happen precisely that day and in that moment !, 
  please , stand to the full facts you too !, 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-jlz5frt88 ) you have your macron of spain . 
  albert rivera was a former sympathetic of pp ; paying the quotes to the party . 
  we know him pretty well in catalonia , and he 's party is just a pp with marketing . 
  from being against same-sex marriage to voting against bull-fighting ban in catalonia . 
  do i have to remember also that when in the catalan parliament the francoism and nazism was condemned , both c 's and pp abandoned the parliament before voting ? 
  maybe it was another light aircraft , not related with the aerial firefighting ones . 
  or just 100 % false alarm and nothing happened . 
  el pa\u00eds just edited their article . 
  * '' but the spanish air force confirmed it 's not spanish via [ twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/ejercitoaire/status/877208162826407938 ) . 
  still a major hit in g\u00e9nova 13 . 
  canadair crashes into the ground while fighting fires in central portugal . 
  el pa\u00eds just [ said ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2017/06/20/actualidad/1497975695_613960.html ) it was portuguese , not spanish as some media informed . 
  probably one of the worst angles you could get of the church ... :p i mean gaud\u00ed wanted people to admire the church the way you captured it ( diagonally ; capturing more than just 1 facade ; never from the center of a facade ) , as seen [ here ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k-ew3zuxzpy/tolohqdg-li/aaaaaaaaamm/odxz-bq3lie/s1600/plano3%2bsagrada%2bfamilia.jpg ) . 
  but you showed the only facade still waiting to be built ( glory facade ) . 
  from the apse you would get a much better view . 
  or even from the passion fa\u00e7ade , showing the only sacristy of the church completely built , as seen [ here ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4200/34354719864_3a1d2208bd_b.jpg ) . 
  in 9 years come to barcelona and take this picture from the exact same spot and you 'll get the best picture , 
   loads of people from andalucia consider themselves andalu first and spanish second you said it . 
  meanwhile in catalonia it 's `` catalan first '' and `` nothing '' second . 
  that 's what i was trying to say , i think you did n't understand ... seriously comparing catalan pro-independence movement with andalusia : s and better not to talk about sergio ramos ... 
  i think no one doubts he feels himself as a spaniard . 
  it 's very common for players to show their regional flags . 
  exactly !, 
  therefore the country is overcrowded , but less density populated than others . 
  it would be sooo funny to listen it in sports events or celebrations . 
  definitely not the `` anthem prototype '' one would expect , but much better in my opinion than those `` boring formal '' anthems of many countries . 
  yeah me too i like it for spain , all what an anthem needs is there . 
  the `` ciudadanos '' one is ridiculous , just the fact the word `` spain '' is not in the chorus ... you take this one and we get the `` cant de la senyera '' . 
  and everybody is happy !, 
  i do n't know ( i 'm not spain xd ) , i hope !, 
  the international community sure will make moves . 
  i remember they `` somehow approved '' a lyrics of the spanish anthem , but later nothing happened at the end . 
  [ this ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/paulino_cubero ) one . 
  i believe it 's pretty good , it talks about `` different languages '' ( * distinta voz * ) , multiculturalism , etc. 
  and there 's nothing about the `` fascist '' lyrics that would n't be very adequate for today . 
  i also found [ this ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/marcha_real#versi.c3.b3n_de_joaqu.c3.adn_sabina ) lyrics version presented by the political party `` ciudadanos '' . 
  quite funny considering how many times you can hear the word `` ciudadanos '' in the song xddd, 
  yep , next october 1st https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_independence_referendum,_2017, 
  now you improved .
