  they said literally '' * when we present the real law at the parliament , you 'll see how different it is with what el pa\u00eds is publishing * '' . 
  they need `` something '' to go against the catalan independence . 
  if they do n't have it , they make it up xd, 
  but all these fake news make non-catalan people like / u/rainymeadow and / u/btyi really happy . 
  that 's all they have, 
   but in comparison to other countries in the eu , it sounds more like a bad joke . 
  dude catalonia 's gdp per capita is higher than italy 's and south korea ... catalonia is often compared in economic terms with denmark . 
  barcelona 's port and airport region is one of the crucial economic dynamic zones of europe . 
  big international commerce companies ( like amazon 's centre for the whole southern europe ) are located right there for a reason . 
   even if it is n't terrorism it is still going to be a sad day for manchester . 
  that 's for sure :(, 
  let 's see what happens ...  catalan independence movement is pro-eu . 
  i think what he 's trying to say is that the [ catalan independence movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_independence ) is an unique peacefully broad-based grass-root movement of the catalan society . 
  from the society it then transitioned into politics . 
  if there 's no answer to this peaceful demand , he fears some sectors want to move to violence movements ( which i do n't think will happen ) . 
  it can be also seen as : * why violent secession movements can get attention/answers but a peaceful demand like the catalan independence movement is being ignored ? 
  again with this thing xd i live in catalonia and i like/follow catalan politics . 
  why ca n't i share this stuff here ? 
  if with `` spam '' you mean quantity , i agree with you . 
  these last days there 's a lot of movement in the catalan/spanish politics , with daily news relating with the referendum of independence ( from both the catalan and the spanish government sides ; just this morning the president of spain was talking about the famous `` el pa\u00eds catalan independence draft '' , while this afternoon we had the last referendum offer by the catalan president in madrid 's conference ) . 
  there 's a lot of stuff happening , as you know !, 
  but you mean i should n't share it ? 
  what 's wrong with it ? 
  i like sharing and reading the comments from european neighbors . 
  if right now there was a possible independence referendum in any other region of europe , i would also love to follow it and read all the news being posted here in reddit . 
  i 'm sure some europeans might find interesting , despite you do n't like this information at all ... 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/corredor_atl%c3%a1ntico ) it goes through madrid ...  the whole catalonia vs spain thing ? 
  so catalonia-spain relations are perfect , right ? 
  ? \u00bf ? \u00bf dude you are not even trying to refute what i said ?? 
  where are the `` lies and propaganda '' ? 
  is there a `` problem '' with anything i said ?? 
   sure , because nobody is asking for the atlantic high-speed railway system to france , right ? 
  that 's the problem , only the spanish government wants this extremely expensive project ( the orography is crazy ) . 
  the european union said multiple times the mediterranean corridor must be the 1st and only priority , which it is vital for the eu economy . 
  but spain wants `` everything '' to go through madrid , despite being the ports all over the mediterranean and all the maritime commerce goes there ( when the corridor finishes it will change global commerce that now needs to spend more days to reach the nordic ports , arriving from asia through the suez canal ) . 
  you ca n't deny this is a crucial disagreement catalonia ( mediterranean corridor , supported by the eu ) vs spain ( atlantic/central corridor ) . 
  you can read the full report ( pdf ) in english here : * [ human rights regression : elected officials ' freedom of expression and the separation of powers in the kingdom of spain ] ( http://www.sindic.cat/site/unitfiles/4402/report%20human_rights_regression.pdf ) *, 
  i 'm with the vice president here . 
  he was voted to do precisely what he 's doing . 
  he ca n't go against the people that voted him ... 
  wow only 7,6 % of catalans consider themselves to be `` only spanish '' . 
  i did n't know about this !, 
  that 's great information , 
   blocking any referendum means actually strengthening the independists but the spanish government is so damn dumb they have n't realized yet . 
  i live in catalonia and the younger generations are much more pro-independence than the older ones ( who lived during the spanish fascist dictatorship ) . 
  in the foreseeable future i ca n't imagine a catalonia within spain . 
  british '' `` sun '' '', 
  catalan president , vice president and minister of foreign affairs are right now [ live ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2017/05/22/actualidad/1495467195_386020.html ) in madrid presenting the conference '' * a referendum for catalonia . 
  invitation to a democratic agreement * '' . 
  today 's conference is catalonia 's last offer to a negotiated referendum with the spanish government , making it the 18th ( and final ) attempt in the last 5 years . 
  now i 'm confused : s and scared ... what that could mean ? 
  or telling us again how much he loves us . 
  like when he said * '' [ i like the catalan people because they make things ] ( https://youtu.be/zmmkc-ckebo?t=7s ) '' * < 3, 
   was n't that bad when i was there a few months ago . 
  well if you came as a tourist what do you expect ? 
  come here in catalonia to live and after 1 year you answer me , 
   spain ca n't say `` just ignore them '' in fact today the catalan president traveled to madrid to present his `` final '' referendum offer . 
  today 's offer is the 18th attempt made by the catalan government in the last 5 years to have a referendum on independence xd * [ 17 `` no '' in 5 years : spanish government negative answer to a negotiated referendum ] ( http://www.ccma.cat/324/17-nos-en-5-anys-la-negativa-del-govern-espanyol-a-negociar-el-referendum/noticia/2789954/ ) *, 
  i did n't delete any message , i think it 's [ there ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6cm0ka/catalonia_to_immediately_declare_independence_if/dhvtn44/?context=3 ) o.o  catalonia was the only place that did not embrace fascism . 
  that 's not true . 
  and of course you have all the right to denounce it !, 
  many families from all over spain fought against fascism . 
  yep i thought you were confrontational , but it 's fine i understand you now . 
  many people suffered the fascism in spain of course !, 
  but the `` cultural genocide '' of the franco regime against catalan culture and language was something specially focused with catalonia ; and that 's what i was talking specifically . 
  my grandparents feared of speaking catalan in public just in case anybody could hear them ... 
  in fact i would n't be here right now if a bomb had hit a few meters on the right , where my family lived . 
  [ catalan republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_republic ), 
   yup , only catalonia suffered the franco regime . 
  did i say that ? 
  anyway if you are from madrid , you can understand it is not the same the cultural oppression the catalan language and culture suffered , with the * general * oppression many regions of spain suffered . 
  i 'm talking about cultural genocide : http://scholar.oxy.edu/urc_student/909/, 
  yep you explained it pretty well . 
  i do n't want to make a long list of things , but basically naming a few : - monarchy ( spain ) vs republic ( catalonia ) : catalan people are republicans and do n't believe in an expensive and undemocratic monarchy like the spanish one . 
  spain does n't have any plans to transition from a monarchy to a republic . 
  - catalan vs spanish language : spain in history has never really protected the catalan language ( in fact in the past has tried to [ eliminate ] ( http://scholar.oxy.edu/urc_student/909/ ) it ) . 
  the catalan government efforts are not enough , without proper legislation that only spain can approve ( for instance , in many courts in catalonia it is * easier * to use dutch , german or french than catalan language ) . 
  a way to sum up the language status in catalonia is : you do n't * need * catalan to live in catalonia , but you need spanish to live in catalonia . 
  and well from here lots of problems arise ... - catalan culture vs spanish culture : for example in 2010 catalan parliament banned bull-fighting , considering it an animal cruelty act . 
  right after this the spanish government declared bullfighting a national heritage , so no other region of spain could ban it ( like catalonia did ) . 
  now in 2017 recently , a court in madrid ruled against the decision of catalonia and said bullfighting must be legal in catalonia . 
  - different projects : there are too much examples here ... for example catalonia believes more in european integration ( mediterranean high-speed railway system to connect with europe for example ) , whereas spain 's projects include high-speed railway systems to connect radial villages with madrid or more economic relations with latin america . 
  in infrastructures the discussions are permanent . 
  you are so deluded ...  you are deciding the future of catalonia nobody was deciding the future of catalonia !, 
  ca n't you even read ? 
  people voted to express his opinion , without consequences , because it was just a vote to know people 's opinion on the subject . 
  that 's why only 40 % turnout ( according to catalan government ) , which means 2 million people voting approx . 
  in the future if we have a binding referendum on independence i believe the turnout is going to be higher ... 
  but how is this a big lose ? 
  in which terms ? 
  what did we `` lose '' when voting in 2014 ? 
  you are so weird ... 
   every corner of spain suffered under franco oh sure !, 
  every corner of spain suffered the * same * . 
  everyone knows catalonia suffered the most ... and this is not a `` competition '' , but a sad fact . 
  dude my family had to prevent the younger ones from singing songs in catalan on the streets , fearing someone would hear them speaking in catalan ... http://scholar.oxy.edu/urc_student/909/, 
  wtf you even saying ? 
  dude i voted in 2014 and everyone there knew it would n't happen anything after the result . 
  it was like an opinion poll ...  `` just in case we lose '' how just in case we lose if the `` yes for independence '' option won massively ? 
  omg your arguments xd,
