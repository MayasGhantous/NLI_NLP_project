  today in press conference rajoy was pretty irritated/nervous when talking about the `` draft '' published by el pa\u00eds xd, 
  we already declared independence in 2014 ? 
  really ? 
  i 'm a catalan and i did n't even know that !, 
  seriously do n't troll ... you always make the same joke dude !, 
  you are talking about the [ catalan non-binding referendum on independence of 2014 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_self-determination_referendum,_2014 ) , which was only to know people 's opinion . 
   we were culturally oppressed with no representation wow like catalonia a few decades ago !, 
  in fact our former catalan president llu\u00eds companys is the only incumbent democratically elected president in european history to have been executed ( in 1940 by the spanish fascist government ) . 
  it 's just not only about `` money '' . 
  catalonia-spain relations are very complex . 
  too many differences in almost every thing you can imagine ... 
  i honestly believe independence is inevitable in the foreseeable future . 
  according to el pa\u00eds also : '' [ catalonia 's eu membership is taken for granted ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2017/05/21/actualidad/1495389142_855588.html ) '' in fact catalan separatists do n't think they will leave the eu , since the eu membership is really important for them . 
   freedom of movement apply according to the draft , all the eu law will be applied . 
  in other words your situation wo n't change . 
  lol by looking at the miniature i thought it was something about pikachu !, 
  el pa\u00eds ( highest-circulation daily newspaper in spain ) affirms having had access to the `` secret draft '' of the catalan rupture 's law written by the catalan government . 
  if there 's no referendum , the catalan parliament would immediately approve this law starting the immediate process of the udi . 
  catalonia would become a parliamentary republic after the new catalan constitution is approved in 2 months . 
  * article 2 . 
  national sovereignty is vested in the catalan people , from whom emanate the powers of the state . 
  * according to el pa\u00eds , the draft is referred itself as a `` foundational law '' , and though its pages it 's exhaustively specified `` until the last detail '' about the secession : who will be catalan citizens and how to obtain nationality ; which spanish laws will remain valid and which will be automatically derogated ; what hill happen with spanish public servants living in catalonia ; what will happen with public contracts signed by the spanish government ... etc. 
  according to el pa\u00eds also : '' [ catalonia 's eu membership is taken for granted ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2017/05/21/actualidad/1495389142_855588.html ) '' eu law ( including the one approved after catalonia 's independence ) will be completely applied in catalonia , like all the other international treaties signed by spain ( until they are renegotiated by catalonia ) . 
  edit : catalan government member ( jordi turull ) just tweeted this in reply to el pa\u00eds : '' * whoever send you this alleged draft is really out-of-time , and we deny it . 
  when the real law goes public you 'll realize it quickly . 
  spain is the european country with more brits expats living . 
  and within spain the valencian community ( benidorm 's region ) is where there are the most . 
  so you can imagine ... 
  i 'm a catalan but i do n't understand aznar 's '' [ catalan ] ( https://youtu.be/5m95bzokdps?t=35s ) '' xd, 
  i prefer psoe+podemos to be honest ... but anyway i do n't know if us ( the catalans ) will be there by then !, 
  spain is definitely so weird . 
  just [ today ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2017/05/19/media/1495209359_962108.html?id_externo_rsoc=tw_cc ) we discovered ( again ) how the spanish society is basically ideologically left-wing . 
  yet somehow the pp ( right-wing ) is the ruling party , despite being immersed in the worst corruption ever . 
  psoe-podemos-ciudadanos negotiations were so difficult , but i do n't think impossible . 
  anyway with pedro 's psoe back , podemos motion of no confidence , pp 's corruption ... we 'll see if rajoy manages to even finish his term . 
   i respect the decision of psoe to allow them to govern . 
  * no but seriously , if i was a psoe militant i would be so mad with that decision . 
  that 's why pedro destroyed susana in primaries . 
  psoe 's militants and voters never accepted the abstention . 
  great news for psoe and for spain !, 
  i could n't imagine [ susana ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf8b50dvamw ) winning ... 
  in fact benidorm has the most high-rise buildings per capita in the world . 
  just look at [ this ] ( http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5501d94a69bedd9a278b4567-1200-924/intempo-building-spain-benidorm-1.jpg ) thing ... 
  click ** abans ** for `` before '' and ** ara ** for `` now '' . 
  edit : or just click the picture . 
   and creating new industrial areas , most notably around madrid . 
  as i told you in other comment , they did n't create industrialization in catalonia . 
  the industrialization of catalonia started at the beginning of the 19th century , whereas the major part of spain still had an economy similar to the middle ages one . 
  so during the spanish miracle ( late 20th century ) they invested where the industry was more developed ( like catalonia or the basque country ) . 
  and this can relate to our present days ... why will amazon open in barcelona next october the massive fulfillment centre for the whole southern europe ? 
  inversion goes where there 's more development and industry , and that 's why catalonia receives so many international investment . 
  you just need to look at barcelona 's port & airport region . 
  [ damn frenchmen !, 
  they ruined france !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/i2q0t7qxets?t=22s ), 
   already part of it for years , just not under this name you are simplifying way too much !, 
  if the independency of catalonia was just a `` name change '' it would have already happened xd, 
  mmhmm difficult to say ... but `` possible '' ? 
  among some experts , society and few members of the catalan parliament is considered as a valid and realistic option . 
  an option that `` should and must '' be considered . 
  but catalan president famous affirmation , after the negative of the spanish government , was '' * it 's either a referendum or a referendum * '' . 
  i think it 's pretty self-explanatory . 
  catalan president [ said ] ( http://www.elperiodico.cat/ca/noticias/politica/puigdemont-prioritza-referendum-sobre-declaracio-unilateral-independencia-6011364 ) the unilateral declaration of independence ( udi ; `` dui '' in catalan ) is not in the current government plans . 
  they even joked with '' * we have n't talked about a referenduim , but a referendum * . 
  in conclusion on the `` official '' position : referendum . 
  but the catalan vicepresident [ said ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20170418/421791897956/junqueras-avala-declaracion-unilateral-independencia-estado-impide-referendum.html ) he supports the udi if the spanish government keeps blocking a democratic referendum . 
  there 's an absolute majority ( +50 % ) of the catalan parliament members that supports the independence of catalonia , therefore the vicepresident believes it should be exercised via parliament . 
  anyway this next week we are going to get some news about all of this . 
  this week the catalan president is traveling to madrid to present his `` final offer '' to have a referendum on independence in catalonia ( [ catalonia 's last offer to madrid ] ( http://www.catalannewsagency.com/item/catalonia-s-last-offer-to-madrid ) ) . 
  ps : it 's curious to see spain already had one region declaring a valid and recognized udi ; but of course catalonia is not philippines xd : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unilateral_declaration_of_independence#examples, 
   i do n't expect you to answer all of these questions , it just seems that there are many , many pitfalls for the catalan gov ' t to face to reach even a semblance of success . 
  it 's not going to be easy indeed , and nobody assures an easy success . 
  but as many people/politicians/economists say here in catalonia , even if it 's bad at the beginning , the present situation with spain is unbearable ; literally it ca n't be worst . 
  so `` anything '' will be better than a catalonia within spain . 
  catalan american economist [ xavier sala-i-martin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/xavier_sala-i-martin ) ( one of the world 's best economists , professor at harvard , yale and columbia ) has written a lot about the economy of an independent catalonia . 
  in a `` rational '' economic analysis there 's no way one can affirm the independence would be `` bad '' ; in fact the opposite . 
  one of his more recent books ( [ it 's the time to say goodbye ? 
  ] ( https://www.amazon.com/%c3%89s-lhora-dels-ad%c3%a9us-actualitat/dp/8415961537 ) ) explains many of these things . 
  but , as you point , economy is not everything . 
  many of your questions have already been answered by the catalan government . 
  you also need to understand a `` udi '' is not the first option . 
  referendum is always the first option , but if spain does n't accept it at the end , then udi is there too . 
  ps : catalan police are the [ mossos d'esquadra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mossos_d%27esquadra ) , paid by catalonia of course . 
   it was subsidized by the rest of the country . 
  i already answered to this trolling in other comments . 
  seriously you should look at economic history of spain in more detail before making this affirmations . 
  `` spain subsidizing catalonia '' ... when it has always been the other way around !, 
  the industrialization of catalonia started at the beginning of the 19th century , whereas the major part of spain still had an economy similar to the middle ages one . 
  the `` spanish miracle '' would n't start until more than 100 years later ...  catalonia would be vetoed by spain . 
  it would never be able to rejoin . 
  spain will be the first country interested in catalonia joining the eu . 
  all spanish exports to the eu need to cross catalonia to get to france . 
  in other words , catalonia is spain 's gateway to europe . 
  having a physical border ( + taxes ) with france and the rest of europe is unimaginable for spain . 
  wtf ? 
  catalonia ( richest region of spain ) has been subsidizing the whole spain for the last decades ... more than 10 % of the catalan gdp is taken away by madrid and sent to other regions of spain . 
  catalonia is currently one of the regions of the world with highest fiscal deficit ( more than 16 billions per year are taken away from catalonia by spain ) . 
  are you talking about the spanish debt ? 
  after independence there will be assets negotiations to share part of the spanish debt with the independent catalonia , as the current catalan government has said . 
   catalan patriots '' who are targeting / r/europe because they believe themselves destined to evangelize on the independence wherever a foreigner can read them .
