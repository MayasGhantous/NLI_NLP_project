  you are so funny dude xdddd btw you know some of the signatories are not even pro-independence people , right ? 
  wanting to vote \u2260 pro-independence . 
  that 's why more than 80 % of catalan people want a referendum , or the spanish political party `` podemos '' also wants a catalan referendum . 
  ps : before you ask , no , i have n't singed this . 
   your pessimism detracts from the optimistic title of your submission . 
  `` my '' submission is an opinion of an american social scientist . 
  i think you are mixing stuff here . 
  this is not about `` pessimism '' , but the present objective status of the spanish politics at 2017 . 
  does n't the pp political party have an absolute majority of the seats in the senate ? 
  does n't the pp would vote against the possibility of a referendum of independence in catalonia ? 
  numbers are numbers . 
  the present is the present ... of course in the future things can `` change '' , but i think it 's pretty clear we are talking about now . 
  and even in the future , what makes you think people in the canary islands , madrid or seville would vote in a referendum in favor to have a referendum on independence in catalonia ? 
  future is speculation . 
  the constitutional reform now ( and probably in next 5-10 years ) is impossible . 
  there should be a massive change in the politics of spain , which i do n't think we can say will happen in a foreseeable future ( not in 2019 elections , or you think so ? ) . 
  but anyway this discussion is pointless . 
  as i have explained in other comment , we do n't need a reform in the constitution neither the whole country voting for the independence of one single region . 
   the eu is good at what it does , but a threat ? 
  i do n't think the eu is a threat . 
  but that 's what some americans say/think . 
  here in reddit a couple weeks ago one american literally said to me he though `` the eu was a threat for his country '' and that `` nothing good for the us comes from the eu '' . 
  i think it 's good for the world having the eu . 
  one of the best things that have happened in our world history , 
   with a detailed review of all my previous comments to carefully elaborate a complete report of what i 've said in the past trust me it 's not a detailed review at all xd you have dozens of examples similar to the ones i posted , it 's easy to do it !, 
  this '' * again . 
  seriously , stop using this subreddit for pro-independence proselytism * '' is a comment you have ready to use all the time dude ... 
  ok ... first of all you need to know that there are hundreds of jurists , constitutional law teachers , lawyers and judges saying a referendum on independence in catalonia is 100 % compatible with the current spanish constitution . 
  for example you have this in catalan : [ * more than 600 catalan jurists affirm the referendum is not only legitimate but legal * ] ( http://www.elnacional.cat/ca/politica/juristes-referendum_155334_102.html ) . 
  if you read the spanish constitution you can see that , as every other constitution on earth , it does n't regulate the independencies of its regions ( neither permitting nor prohibiting ) . 
  it 's not on the `` list of things '' you would expect on a constitution . 
  if you look on history there has never been a constitution regulating that , because `` independencies of the regions within a country '' are not a matter of constitutional law , but basically international law and international diplomacy/community . 
  so then , why the spanish government ( pp political party , anti-independence and anti-referendum ) says there should be an amendment to the spanish constitution in order to include the possibility of an independence referendum of the regions conforming spain ? 
  short answer : because this is the way of assuring there will never be a referendum of independence in catalonia . 
  let 's just call it a * legal strategy * to block independence referendums . 
  we should look at it in detail since it 's really interesting ; you can look it at articles 166 to 169 of the spanish constitution ( part x - constitutional amendment ) . 
  reforming the spanish constitution ( a rigid constitution , which means it 's specially difficult to change ) to include the possibility of independence of regions in spain or referendum , means this long process : * 1 \\ . 
  approval of the reform in the spanish congress ( by a 2/3 majority of its members ) : almost impossible . 
  but maybe the most `` realistic '' part of this crazy journey . 
  approval of the reform in the spanish senate ( by a 2/3 majority of its members ) : impossible , since pp political party has the absolute majority of the seats . 
  from here everything down is 100 % impossible . 
  dissolution of the houses and new elections . 
  the houses elected must ratify the decision and approve again the new constitutional text , by ( again ) a 2/3 majority of the members of both houses ( congress and senate ) . 
  once the amendment has been passed , it shall be submitted to ratification by referendum . 
  so the whole spain ( from galicia , to canary islands , to ceuta , madrid , etc. ), 
  shall vote in favor of catalonia being able to have a referendum in independence . 
  which is extremely crazy to think they would vote for . 
  therefore with this strategy of the constitutional reform , the government of spain knows 100 % there will never be a referendum in catalonia and therefore catalonia will never become an independent country . 
  but as you can see , this is not a `` real '' solution for the will of the majority of the catalan people to decide their future . 
  supposing this long journey of the constitutional amendment had started and ended ( without the approval ) , there would still be a majority of catalans ( +80 % ) willing to have a referendum on independence in catalonia . 
  so the `` problem '' is still there ... 
   last time i checked , catalonia can have its referendum through a democratic constitutional change in spain . 
  you know this is not true at all , right ? 
  changing/revising/amending the spanish constitution = the whole spanish people ( not only catalans ) voting . 
  how can an catalan independence referendum be voted by the whole country ( spain ) ? 
  since when in history the independencies of regions are voted by the whole country the region wants to secede from ? 
  this just a * lame * tactic by the ruling spanish political party to assure there will never be a referendum/independency . 
  if you are from spain you already know this is a * fake * solution , in order to never have a referendum of independence . 
  if you are not from spain , i can explain you the legal procedure to amend the spanish constitution , so you can see by yourself why it would never happen ) . 
  i think he is ... but well we will see what happens !, 
  i think this ( * puigdemont rechaza acudir a las cortes sin un acuerdo sobre el refer\u00e9ndum * ) is already a negotiation . 
  but if you ask me i would prefer the president to go there anyway . 
  on the other hand i understand there 's no point in going there for nothing , if the spanish government stills says `` no '' to a democratic referendum to solve the problem . 
   if you 're spanish have faith in your arguments & you should n't have anything to fear when it comes to convincing catalonia to vote for spain . 
  i think they do n't have the faith ... ps : btw there 's no `` official referendum '' announced yet , but the spanish ruling party has already started the campaign for the `` no '' . 
  seriously xd i also believe many americans see the european union ( largest single market on earth ) as a direct threat . 
  usa is the `` king '' against x european country , but not against the eu as a whole . 
  but not all americans are like this , right ? 
  and well let 's face that it is n't very good for europe 's image , having a eu country ( spain ) not letting one nation ( catalonia ) decide their own future via a democratic referendum . 
  canada ( quebec ) and the uk ( scotland ) did it . 
  the eu can accept having a population that wants to decide their future ( +80 % catalan people want a referendum ) being denied by spain ? 
  after donald trump i have the same feeling about americans !, 
  but except on this case xd because i live in catalonia and i have always believed that the eu needs a new fresh pro-eu member like catalonia to start making necessary changes and reforms . 
  more than serbia , albania or montenegro , i think a good trigger for the european integration project will be catalonia . 
  yep i understand what you mean , but the eu is not only `` spain '' . 
  it would also set an example for other countries , seeing a `` rich '' country like catalonia ( higher gdp per capita than italy ) joining the eu and willing to expand the eu project . 
  also with pro-eu i mean pro-eu in every aspect ( not just euroscepticism movements ) . 
  for instance spain is one of the principal ( if not the 1st ) violators of eu law and cjeu resolutions . 
  every year the comission opens dozens of procedures against spain , while also paying some of the highest fines . 
  catalonia has always complained to these spanish infringements ... 
  mmm maybe i 'm a bit lost ... but is n't italy a bit late here ? 
  i thought every civilized nation already did this . 
  when i was a kid here in barcelona , every now and then a `` vaccination team '' came to my school and we all lined up to receive our vaccines . 
  and no one could refuse them , since it was mandatory . 
  i found it pretty normal and thought it was the thing everywhere ... 
  well catalan independence movement has always been really pro-european . 
  both catalan vicepresident and catalan minister of foreign affairs for instance are former well known meps . 
  after brexit , i think a new pro-eu catalan sate joining the eu will set a good democratic example for the project , while also motivating the necessary reforms the eu needs . 
  well as far as i know , in the '' [ el pa\u00eds in english version ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/inenglish.html ) '' they translate very few articles . 
  in fact sometimes they do n't change some articles for 1 entire week . 
  they seem to focus in important international issues about spain . 
  so i would n't expect to find this news about the signatures there . 
  on the other hand , the '' [ el pa\u00eds catalan edition ] ( http://cat.elpais.com/?cp=4 ) '' seems to focus a lot in all the catalan politics stuff . 
  we do n't only find the same [ article ] ( http://cat.elpais.com/cat/2017/05/19/catalunya/1495222405_122903.html ) in catalan , but many others that do n't even feature in the spanish and english versions, 
  with el pais in english he means this : http://elpais.com/elpais/inenglish.html  just use google translate and paste it in the comments as evey other person on this sub does of course you can use `` google translate '' , but direct english written sources are better , right ? 
  the same info in the spanish version of el pa\u00eds ( and many other places ) is the same one we find in english at catalan news agency . 
  this user / u / _ permafrost _ always does the same , do n't worry . 
  i have posted news from elpais in english and he also replies the same comment about `` pro-independence proselytism '' . 
  you can see him [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/69eqbw/catalonia_getting_ready_to_buy_the_ballot_boxes/dh605ex/ ) , or [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/669wdy/catalonia_to_declare_independence_if_spain_blocks/dggxa7u/?context=3 ) ( he thinks catalonia is `` not '' a nation ) , or [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6928mo/hatred_towards_spain_in_catalan_classrooms/dh382bq/?context=3 ) ( calling pro-independence people `` xenophobes '' ) ... etc. 
  the source ( catalan news agency ) it 's not the problem .
