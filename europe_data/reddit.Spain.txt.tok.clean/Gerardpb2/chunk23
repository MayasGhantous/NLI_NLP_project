  the problem for him is the fact this information can be shared here , something he does n't want . 
  i bet he is not even catalan , so he would n't be able to vote in a future catalan independence referendum , but he hates the fact of an independent catalonia so much that he is constantly trying to censor all the information . 
   this is not franco 's spain most of the current spanish government ( pp political party ) are former members or descendants of the franco dictatorial regime . 
  last april for instance we could see the former minister of justice of spain ( 2011-2014 ) singing fascists songs and praising francisco franco figure during one burial . 
  here you have the video with the minister and all the other fascists : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=squ9wiuh3o4 ( at 0:52 you can see them honoring francisco franco ) . 
  can you imagine something similar in germany with hitler ? 
  with the department of justice of a democratic country ? 
  of course not !, 
  but this is spain , and you seem to know very little about this country ... 
   negotiate for a better deal , better union , more respect , better tax arrangement , use the threat of independence to get a better deal for the region and for its people in all possible way , stand for your culture , develop it and cherish it . 
  except this has been happening for the last decades , starting with spanish democracy ( after dictatorship ) until today . 
  the major stuff started in 2006 when the catalan parliament and the catalan people via referendum approved the `` statute of autonomy of catalonia '' . 
  even the spanish parliament approved it later . 
  but in 2010 the spanish constitutional court ( asked and appointed by the spanish government ) annulled the most import parts of it . 
  this caused anger among the politicians and catalan society , since what they had decided/voted had been unilaterally `` destroyed '' . 
  this was the first `` big alarm '' , since it was shown to the catalan people what what they wanted ( in many aspects : economy , culture , etc. ), 
  may not fit in the spanish state . 
  after this rule of 2010 , the catalan president started negotiations with the spanish government to try to find a solution with the relationship catalonia-spain . 
  one of the most important aspects was the `` fiscal pact '' , because catalonia currently sends a lot the money it collects via taxes to spain , without getting anything in return ; approx 12 % of catalan gdp is lost due to this obligation . 
  the `` fiscal pact '' aimed to reduce a bit this amount of money , so the catalan government could have more money to serve the catalan people . 
  spanish president answered a cat\u00e9gorique `` no '' to any type of fiscal agreement . 
  and all the other negotiations were also dismissed . 
  at the end it was clear that it 's impossible to negotiate and get any agreement with spain . 
  therefore the catalan president recently declared that the only solution would be becoming an independent state . 
  an independent catalonia would have a gross domestic product of $ 314 billion , according to calculations by the oecd , which would make it the 34th largest economy in the world . 
  that would make it bigger than portugal or hong kong . 
  its gdp per capita would be $ 35,000 , which would make it wealthier than south korea , israel or italy . 
   girona should join with france ok now i do n't know if you are trolling or what xd dude the people from the girona want a catalan independent country , not joining france !, 
  it 's not that difficult to understand , right ? 
  the people democratic will ... you are from america , look at your history man xd and it 's not only `` girona '' , look at [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/municipis_independencia_1-10-15.png ) map of catalonia showing all the municipalities that , like girona , have also declared in favor to a catalan independent sate . 
  it 's the absolute majority of the villages of catalonia . 
  and do n't reply me now with `` all the red municipalities should join france and the rest say in spain '' please xd, 
  chill out ? 
  i 've been reading some of your comments and i 'm still trying to understand you ...  better only because it reflects the cultural diversity of the place , closeness to france , and this place 's history what does that even mean ? 
  xd you do n't need to translate the name of one city to x number of languages to reflect the `` cultural diversity of the place and history '' . 
  it 's like saying is `` even better '' to call granada as '' \u063a\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0637\u0629 '' to show its muslim moorish history ... 
  how is `` even better '' * gerona * or * g\u00e9rone * , if ** girona ** is the only official name and the english term ? 
  it was in france some centuries ago ... maybe these people are talking about [ northern catalonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_catalonia ) , a former catalan region that now is part of france . 
  is new york city a self-declared independent city of the united states ? 
  has new york a distinct official language than the one official in the us ( english ) ? 
  i 'm not going to continue , since you are comparing `` new york '' with a historical nation ( catalonia ) with centuries of unique history and culture . 
  it 's not about `` proud '' ... but what the people ( in this case the people of girona ) want and feel themselves as ( not spanish , but catalan ) , which i think is not that difficult tor respect , right ? 
  and i 'm not from girona . 
   and it is part of spain in many practical ways - integration with the spain 's rail network , highway system , phone lines , tax systems , legal framework , and european union laws that bind spain and catalonia as part of spain to the rest of europe . 
  by reading what you said it 's pretty obvious you seem to know very little about catalonia and spain ... catalonia has distinct laws ( for instance spanish civil code is not applied , but the catalan civil code ) , catalonia also has some distinct taxes applied only in catalonia ... and the list goes on . 
  you say catalonia being part of spain is `` practical '' . 
  but you do n't know/name the other x hundreds reaons why being part of spain is so `` impractical '' for catalonia , and therefore , why so many catalan people want to leave spain and join europe as a new state ; some reasons include political ( monarchy vs republic ) , economic , infrastructures , etc. 
  beautiful !, 
  how is [ catalan language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/algherese_dialect ) status there ? 
  according to wikipedia it has `` semi-official '' status alongside italian . 
  but i remember some years ago in a catalan tv documentary very few people could speak catalan ... if some local can explain ? 
  i think people know where catalonia is , right ? 
  i would also like to point that [ girona ] ( https://dades.naciodigital.cat/redaccio/arxius/imatges/201409/330_1409817011catedral_girona_marxa_torxes_2013.jpg ) has declared itself as a '' [ free catalan territory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_catalan_territory ) '' , which means the city approved a motion in a plenary session by the councillors of the town municipality 's local authority to declare the city 's independence from spain . 
  this motion declared that spanish laws and regulations are considered provisional , waiting for the government and parliament of catalonia to enact new catalan laws ( like the old [ catalan constitutions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_constitutions ) , abolished by force in 1714 by spain ) after having assumed national sovereignty , and therefore turning catalonia into an independent state . 
  girona is also a city member of the '' [ association of municipalities for independence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/association_of_municipalities_for_independence ) '' , a catalan organization of town councils and other administration entities created in 2011 with the goal of achieving the independence of catalonia . 
  here you have a map of all the municipalities of catalonia that have currently joined the association ( in red ) : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/municipis_independencia_1-10-15.png, 
  we have a referendum every 4 years ? 
  i think it 's pretty clear the title is not about `` elections '' , but a catalan independence referendum . 
  [ definitely ] ( http://www.2sisarquitectes.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/full.jpg ) , 
   what were the circumstances that motivated them to go to our current lands that are so much colder than the ones in the south . 
  i wonder the same !, 
  what 's the point of keep going north in a world with free space everywhere ? 
  i 'm sure somebody here can explain better ... my theory is that , during the paleolithic humans grouped together in small nomadic bands , hunting and collecting to survive . 
  they had to move constantly in search for food . 
  it was n't until the neolithic ( [ neolithic revolution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neolithic_revolution ) ) some 10,000 years ago when humans discovered agriculture and ranching ; transitioning from a lifestyle of hunting and gathering to one of agriculture and settlement . 
  so when the neolithic revolution arrived some humans already where there ? 
  and started making settlements where their ancestors had brought them to after generations of nomadic lifestyle . 
  the ** [ last glacial period ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/last_glacial_period ) **  the last glacial period , popularly known as the ice age , was the most recent glacial period , which occurred from c. 110,000 -- c. 11,700 years ago . 
  this most recent glacial period is part of a larger pattern of glacial and interglacial periods known as the quaternary glaciation ( c. 2,588,000 years ago to present ) . 
  from this point of view , scientists consider this `` ice age '' to be merely the latest glaciation event in a much larger ice age , one that dates back over two million years and is still ongoing . 
   from the point of view of human archaeology , it falls in the paleolithic and mesolithic periods . 
  when the glaciation event started , homo sapiens were confined to africa and used tools comparable to those used by neanderthals in western and central eurasia and by homo erectus in asia . 
  near the end of the event , homo sapiens spread into eurasia and australia . 
  archaeological and genetic data suggest that the source populations of paleolithic humans survived the last glacial period in sparsely wooded areas and dispersed through areas of high primary productivity while avoiding dense forest cover . 
  the retreat of the glaciers allowed groups of asians to migrate to the americas and populate them . 
  yep , poor andorra !, 
  wow i did n't know !, 
  i was looking for a good picture of the city , considering this week is the famous girona festival `` temps de flors '' . 
  i ended up finding the same picture !, 
  xd i guess it 's the best one ... 
  *** location *** located 99 km northeast of barcelona , girona is one of the major catalan cities . 
  *** history *** the first historical inhabitants in the region were iberians ; girona is the ancient gerunda , a city of the ausetani . 
  later , the romans built a citadel there , which was given the name of [ gerunda ] ( http://www.girona.cat/museuhistoria/docs/foto_p_resum_girona_sagrera.jpg ) . 
  the visigoths ruled in girona until it was conquered by the moors in 715 . 
  finally , charlemagne reconquered it in 785 and made it one of the fourteen original counties of catalonia . 
  *** girona cathedral *** the [ interior ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/catedral_de_girona_-_nau_central.jpg ) of the cathedral includes the widest gothic nave in the world , with a width of 22 m , and the second widest of any church after that of st. peter 's basilica ( for comparison , the width of the nave of reims is 14.65 m , saint-\u00c9tienne de sens , 15.25 m and 12 m , in notre dame de paris ) . 
  its construction was begun in the 11th century in the romanesque architectural style , and continued in the 13th century in gothic style . 
  *** onyar river *** characteristic of girona are the [ picturesque houses ] ( https://sontur.by/uploads/posts/2015-12/1449683237_e8cf7551a249bbc35b915e10b35ddfd2a3f540c7.jpg ) overlooking the river onyar . 
  these were built over many years and give the flavour of a small mediterranean city . 
  the fa\u00e7ades are painted according to a palette created by enric ansesa , james j. faix\u00f3 and the architects fuses and j. viader . 
  *** temps de flors *** ( 13-21 may 2017 ) during this annual festival the whole city is decorated with [ flowers ] ( http://blog.rusticae.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/temps-de-flors-1024x768.jpg ) . 
  the city receives so many tourists during this week , that this 2017 edition the catalan police created a service during weekends which consists on helping locals get to their homes , literally guiding them through the multitude . 
  you can watch this massive tourism issue on this [ video ] ( http://mp4-high-dwn.media.tv3.cat/7/9/1495024224697.mp4 ) from yesterday 's catalan tv channel news . 
  *** ps *** : the red iron [ bridge ] ( http://equipatgedema.cat/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/pont-de-les-peixeteries-velles.jpg ) over the river you see on the picture , was designed by gustave eiffel 13 years before his world-famous eiffel tower . 
  lol johan cruyff singed in 2014 ... if you click the manifesto [ link ] ( http://www.letcatalansvote.org/en ) you 'll see the full list scrolling down . 
  same with dario fo , who signed in 2014 . 
  the new international personalities are the ones who signed now in 2017 , like h\u00e9lder mateus da costa for instance . 
  france , ireland and netherlands need to step up the pace !, 
  team led by spanish mep proposes target of 35 % , above the commission 's proposed 27 % . 
  in spain 's case , its 2030 goal would be 36 % of renewable energy out of the final energy consumption .
