  in 2015 , the last year with official figures , spain was at 16.2 % , still far from the existing 20 % target for 2020 . 
  if you are a fascist do n't blame the dna for it ... the dna does n't work like this my friend !, 
  thanks for the suggestion !, 
  maybe / r/worldnews is too big for catalan/spanish politics xd this interview with professor sala i mart\u00edn for instance has been massively down-voted here in / r/europe , so i do n't think it would be of interest there . 
  it 's difficult to find a place for international discussion about this topics . 
  usually when posting this type of sutff , catalans and spaniards account for more than 80 % of the comments ( 60 % of them are rainymeadow xdd ) , and i would like to know foreign opinion . 
  that 's why i do n't post at spain or / r/catalunya subs . 
  whatever , have a nice day !, 
  well i live in catalonia and i like posting stuff about whatever happens here . 
  i travel a lot and when talking with people from all over the world i see they know very little about what happens here ( logically ) . 
  catalan and spanish media make good coverage , but not the international media . 
  it 's difficult to find english content about catalan politics , so when i find something i like to share it here and see the opinions from other europeans . 
  that 's it ... nobody is forced to `` see '' everything i post . 
  it 's like saying '' [ loulan ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/loulan/submitted/ ) '' spams a lot about france . 
  on the other hand i do n't know how / u/rainymeadow does it , but i literally see him on everything i post . 
  like it 's crazy , he has an alarm or something lol . 
  it was seconds after i had posted this interview , and it had already being downvoted ; minutes later the comment from rainymeadow appears ... and it 's always the same xd even when i posted a picture he complained because i did n't said `` spain ''  _ < and it 's not only with me , i see him on every post related with catalonia , like [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/529jg1/catalans_rally_in_support_of_independence_from/d7ieui6/?context=3 ) or [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6928mo/hatred_towards_spain_in_catalan_classrooms/dh3e5tf/ ) ... comments that usually do n't contribute at all with the discussion or lack any real source . 
  of course in the video / u/rainymeadow posted we can listen sala-i-martin , but there 's nothing xenophobic in what he said !, 
  he was n't talking about the `` spanish dna '' , but the spanish nationalists ( dictatorship , post-francoist politicians , etc ) ... do i really have to explain it ? 
  do n't you realize this user is a troll ? 
  he always does the same on every discussion , until some user has to correct him . 
   he is obviously getting paid to constantly spam things about catalonia and make some noise omg this is too much xdddddddd dude seriously are you ok ? 
  you see the things you say ? 
  i see you on every post about catalonia complaining about everything . 
  are you even catalan ? 
  or you are just trolling as usual ? 
  wow you are accusing a famous columbia , harvard and yale professor to be xenophobic and then providing as a source one video where there are n't xenophobic comments at all ? 
  and why are you sharing a video of an extreme-right wing radical spanish nationalism organization instead of a reliable source ? 
  are you mad or what ? 
  i bet you did n't even read the interview but you tried to criticize it with whatever you could find on the internet - . - xavier sala-i-mart\u00edn is one of the smartest and most respected experts you 'll ever see ... so before you start trolling i 'm going to copy here some info from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/xavier_sala-i-martin ) :  sala i martin is one of the leading economists in the field of economic growth and is consistently ranked among the most-cited economists in the world for works produced in the 1990s . 
   he has been recognized with a distinguished teacher in graduate economics award three times at columbia and yale , with the 2004 king juan carlos i prize ( a biannual prize given to the best economist in spain and latin america ) , and the 2006 lenfest prize awarded to the best teacher at columbia university . 
   on 15 january 2017 , martin was listed by uk-based company richtopia at number 14 in the list of 100 most influential economists, 
  with some 24 km of navigable waterways is the largest residential marina in europe ( in the world , according to other sources ) .

  talking about flags i found [ this ] ( http://garrotxa.cup.cat/sites/garrotxa.cup.cat/files/besalu.jpg ) picture of the same place . 
  i can see the european union flag , the catalan flag and the catalan pro-independence flag , 
   the town 's importance was greater in the early middle ages , as capital of the county of besal\u00fa , whose territory was roughly the same size as the current comarca of garrotxa but sometime extended as far as corbi\u00e8res , aude , in france . 
  wilfred the hairy , credited with the unification of catalonia , was count of besal\u00fa . 
  the town was also the birthplace of raimon vidal , a medieval troubadour . 
   the name besal\u00fa is derived from the latin bisuldunum , meaning a fort on a mountain between two rivers . 
  it is also the historical capital of the county of `` la garrotxa '' . 
  one key date is the year 894 , when besal\u00fa was converted to a county with its own dynasty . 
  in the year 1111 , besal\u00fa lost its independence , for historical reasons in favor of the county of barcelona . 
  centuries later , besal\u00fa started a decadent period , worsened by the redemptions , wars with the french and carlists . 
   besal\u00fa was designated as a historical national property ( `` conjunt hist\u00f2ric-art\u00edstic '' ) in 1966 . 
  the town 's most significant feature is its 12th-century romanesque bridge over the fluvi\u00e0 river , which features a gateway at its midpoint . 
  the church of sant pere was consecrated in 1003 . 
  the town features arcaded streets and squares and also a restored mikveh , a ritual jewish bath dating from the eleventh or twelfth century , as well as the remains of a medieval synagogue , located in the lower town near the river * source * : [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/besal%c3%ba ), 
   the architecture looks like a mess from that angle ... delete the eiffel tower and churches from the picture , and you get some under-development african city xd, 
  omg, 
  the short cartoon ** worker and parasite ** is a reference to soviet cartoons that featured in the 22nd episode of [ the simpsons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_simpsons ) ' 4th season . 
  it 's one of matt groening 's favorite moments from the series . 
   when the popular cartoon itchy and scratchy , featuring a very violent cat and mouse , leaves the krusty the clown show for krusty 's new competitor , gabbo , `` eastern europe 's favorite cat and mouse team , worker and parasite , '' was a cheap replacement ; krusty clearly had not watched the cartoon beforehand to make sure it was a suitable replacement . 
  according to the title screen , it was made in 1959 . 
   the cartoon is 19 seconds long and opened with some cyrillic-looking credits , which account for nothing in real cyrillic . 
  the cartoon itself was quite unintelligible , featuring a crudely drawn cat and mouse in constructivist-like style chattering incoherently and bouncing around to the tune of depressing background music . 
  worker and parasite are first seen in a factory ( where a wrench and sickle are visible as well ) ; they then move in an aisle with a crazy looking baker having a line of identical , miserable-looking peasants line up for bread , and then within a nest of squiggly lines . 
  the cartoon concludes with an out of tune tone and with the screen reading `` endut !, 
  ps : in [ spanish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvqljsnj6v8 ) they translated the show as '' * proletarian and parasite * '' xd ps2 : we can find similar stuff in the simpsons , for instance [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hdpanuozz0 ) parody albanian film called `` kosovo autumn '' . 
  oh lol i summoned you and you ended up deleting this fml xd, 
  my croatian friends you do n't know what you are doing !, 
  hordes of tourists are about to invade your country with summer almost here , and you keep uploading these pictures ? 
  ps : lol the downvoting , i was just joking xd it 's just today i was at barcelona 's beach and i think i was the only local there , tourists everywere ... with the summer weather we had today , the beach was completely pack . 
  i 'm afraid to think about august xd, 
  i ca n't vote for mine because it 's not on the list , but the [ catalan flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/flag_of_catalonia.svg ) ( the senyera ) , one of the oldest flags in europe to be used in present day . 
  pretty few flags have a cooler history/legend behind it : [ the legend of the four blood bars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legend_of_the_four_blood_bars ) . 
  yellow from the golden shield and 4 red stripes from blood drawn with the [ 4 fingers ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vgkvqx6.jpg ) of the hand ( also a popular symbol of catalonia , [ here ] ( http://www.oriolcasanovas.com/2012/09/catalonia-026.jpg ) you can see our last catalan president doing it ) . 
   according to a 14th-century legend , the flag dates back from the 9th century , when the four red bars were drawn , as an act of gratitude , on wilfred i the hairy 's ( count of barcelona ) golden shield by king charles the bald 's fingers drenched with blood from the count 's war wounds prior to wilfred 's death in 897 during the siege of barcelona by lobo ibn mohammed , the moorish governor of lleida . 
   amazing when you get out of big cities like vienna and innsbruck the picture is nice but ... is n't this what happens everywhere on earth ? 
  when you get out of big cities like xx , you find the countryside . 
  i thought you 'll say this one : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2_dhuv_cri :p, 
  for barcelona & catalonia i would say the famous catalan sitcom : [ plats bruts ] ( https://youtu.be/gha3ps0rluq?t=8m50s ), 
  i loved it too !, 
  perfect combination of funny song + quality music , 
  yes 100 % . 
  that first `` australia experience '' in 2015 was some new unexpected fresh quality !,
