  the casa de les punxes is a building built in 1905 , designed by the modernista architect josep puig i cadafalch ( one of the `` 3 kings of catalan modernism '' , along with * antoni gaud\u00ed i cornet * and * llu\u00eds dom\u00e8nech i montaner * ) . 
  the result is a building reminiscent of old medieval castles , with elements of different architectural trends and various technical innovations , with six pointed towers ( crowned by conical spikes ) , one of its distinctive features which gave the popular name of casa de les punxes . 
  medieval and wagnerian atmosphere inspired the architect josep puig i cadafalch in its design . 
  symbolism and the legend of sant jordi ( patron saint of catalonia ) play an important role too . 
  after being closed to the public for more than 100 years , casa de les punxes opened its doors last summer 2016 .

  undeniable true . 
  what sweden did last year when hosting eurovision was indescribable ... they showed us why they are the true kings of europe . 
  the song you posted and this one are just too much ( just thinking the work they had to put to do it ... ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6qst8qp9ck on the other hand you see ukraine 's hosting of eurovision 2017 and ... well xd they just `` did the job '' . 
  nothing more . 
   that lasted hours or days or directly put catalonia under a french monarch 's rule . 
  or years . 
  mod 's from brazil too , he should be happy he won !, 
  i mean imagine if these other songs had represented spain : * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo82_qurypk ( this was people 's favourite , but jury decided to take manel and not listen to people ) * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7j2tv9x-3y ( i liked this one much more than manel 's of course ), 
  maybe you should pay more attention to those musicians in cruises . 
  i do !, 
  and i always wonder why nobody do , cause they have amazing good talent . 
  what i was trying to say is : * how is possible nobody pay attention to that music in cruise ships ( i do , that 's why i see sometimes i 'm alone listening to the musicians ) , but then in eurovision ( somewhere i do n't expect this music to be ) somehow win * . 
  hopefully now i have explained better !, 
  what i mean is that do n't think this type of songs/music are for eurovision . 
  you say * without firework , only music * , but that 's exactly what eurovision represents : an amazing tv show ( the largest tv show in the world ) , that includes fireworks , dancers , etc. 
  to produce big entertainment . 
  portugal 's song is the opposite of that , and i think what portugal represents is not what eurovision represents . 
  portugal 's song has his own space , while eurovision has its own . 
  you wo n't see nicky minaj in eurovision neither . 
  anyway not everybody can be happy , 
  wow thanks for respecting my opinion !, 
  and i 'm from barcelona btw . 
  i think they deserve to be here , they just love eurovision and have shown it to us for many years . 
  it 's something special i do n't know , there 's no economic interests ( like having china or qatar would be ) , but basically fans and the `` uniting together '' stuff that eurovision represents . 
  also let 's just admit that the 3 times they have been they have fucking delivered . 
  they really care with what they bring . 
  i was so sad with dami in not winning last year , it was an amazing song ( best one for me ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ymfx91hwm0, 
  i have been to many cruises and trust me , portugal 's song is exactly the same thing you can hear in a random corner of the ship at night when there 's live chill/jazz musicians . 
  and nobody pays attention to them xd but somehow here won !, 
  i 'm sure there 's people who like the song . 
  but i do n't know ... with ukraine last year the song was about the war and stuff and many people voted just for that . 
  now with portugal the singer has serious health problems with life at risk , and maybe there 's people who also voted for this . 
  i like eurovision song winner to be a `` big hit '' . 
  like euphoria or heroes . 
  songs you can listen everywhere during the year they won ( radio , gym , clubs , etc. 
  ) , and say '' * hey that 's the eurovision song * :d '' . 
  but i do n't like winning songs like jamala 's ( i have never listened that song being played after it won ) or this one from portugal , which i think we wo n't listen never again ... 
  same feelings as last year with ukraine winning ... for me ukraine 2016 and portugal 2017 are some of the worst eurovision winners in history . 
  with so many other good songs and performances why they had to won  _ <, 
  to be honest for me both songs sucked so hard ... 
  ok now i 'm even more terrified ... 
  yes !, 
  he 's making weird faces every time they give him 12 points lol, 
  i do n't know if i 'm alone here but i hate portugal 's song so much ... one of the worst for me  _ < i do n't want portugal to win with so many other good songs xd, 
  wow it seems eurovision is getting interesting :o, 
  then you can start by reading that * history * in wikipedia for example : * [ list of former sovereign states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_former_sovereign_states ) : here you can find the catalan republic . 
  * [ catalan republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_republic ) : here you can see how many times in history a catalan state has existed . 
   yes , you exist as part of spain , therefore being spanish . 
  i do n't know if you realize what you just said ... you implying everything catalans have done/do is * spanish * ? 
  you know catalonia is a historic nation and former sovereign state , right ? 
  read this and tell me where you see the words `` spanish '' or `` spain '' : [ catalan modernism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modernisme ) ... 
   not exactly catalan-exclusive . 
  let me correct you here ... ** art nouveau ** : is an international style of art , architecture and applied art , especially the decorative arts , that was most popular between 1890 and 1910 . 
  english uses the french name * art nouveau * ( `` new art '' ) . 
  the style is related to , ** but not identical with ** , styles that emerged in many countries in europe at about the same time : in austria it is known as * secessionsstil after wiener secession * , in spanish * modernismo * , in catalan * modernisme * , in czech * secese , in danish * sk\u00f8nvirke * or * jugendstil * , in german * jugendstil * ... etc. 
  ** modernisme / catalan modernism ** : is the historiographic denomination given to an art and literature movement . 
  its main form of expression was in architecture , but many other arts were involved ( painting , sculpture , etc. 
  ) , and especially the design and the decorative arts ( cabinetmaking , carpentry , forged iron , ceramic tiles , ceramics , glass-making , silver and goldsmith work , etc. 
  ) , which were particularly important , especially in their role as support to architecture . 
  modernisme was also a literary movement ( poetry , fiction , drama ) . 
  ** although it was part of a general trend that emerged in europe around the turn of the 20th century , in catalonia the style acquired its own unique personality . 
  its distinct name comes from its special relationship , primarily with catalonia and barcelona , which were intensifying their local characteristics for socio-ideological reasons after the revival of catalan culture and in the context of spectacular urban and industrial development ** . 
  * sources : wikipedia *, 
  well palau de la m\u00fasica is right at the city center , so it 's easy to get there . 
  from barcelona sants station is about 20 minutes by public transport . 
   there is a project to build the largest linear park ( think some sort of wider and bigger high-line ) in the world , though it 's a very long term thing . 
  are you talking about the [ * cam\u00ed comtal * ] ( http://ep01.epimg.net/ccaa/imagenes/2013/07/15/catalunya/1373921345_367987_1373921584_noticia_normal.jpg ) / * parc de la sagrera * ( i do n't know which one is the correct name lol ) ? 
  it 's ok !, 
  but it was `` funny '' considering the architect of the hospital ( llu\u00eds dom\u00e8nech i montaner ) played a prominent role in the catalanism movement , being also a politician since 1888 fighting for more autonomy in catalonia . 
  so i guess he would n't liked your `` well done spain '' xd, 
  the palau de la m\u00fasica catalana is a concert hall designed in the catalan modernista style by the architect llu\u00eds dom\u00e8nech i montaner . 
  it was built between 1905 and 1908 for the orfe\u00f3 catal\u00e0 , a choral society founded in 1891 that was a leading force in the catalan cultural movement that came to be known as the renaixen\u00e7a ( catalan rebirth ) . 
  it was inaugurated february 9 , 1908 . 
  the concert hall of the palau , which seats about 2,200 people , is the only auditorium in europe that is illuminated during daylight hours entirely by natural light . 
  the walls on two sides consist primarily of stained-glass panes set in magnificent arches , and overhead is an enormous [ skylight ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/palau_-_vitrall_platea.jpg ) of stained glass designed by antoni rigalt whose centerpiece is an inverted dome in shades of gold surrounded by blue that suggests the sun and the sky . 
  the architectural decoration in the concert hall is a masterpiece of creativity and imagination , yet everything has been carefully considered for its utility in the presentation of music . 
  david mackay ( quoted in carandell et al. 
  2006 , 62 ) :  * the concert hall is one of the most beautiful in the world ( ... ) without exaggeration . 
  it is one of its most important architectural treasures . 
  its pace , simple , complex , mystical and paradoxical , defies accurate description . 
   no party wins if catalonia gains independence . 
  why you say so ? 
  i do n't understand what you mean ... 
  that 's sad ... 
   catalan president , carles puigdemont , together with catalan vp and catalan minister for foreign affairs , ra\u00fcl romeva , will travel to madrid on may 22nd to give the conference `` a referendum for catalonia . 
  invitation to a democratic agreement '' . 
  the conference is the same one that the three catalan leaders gave in brussels last january for nearly 500 people . 
  although the catalan government initially asked to hold the event in the spanish senate , that request was dismissed by the spanish government . 
  so instead , the event will be held in the caja de la m\u00fasica auditorium , which has a capacity of about 250 people . 
  ** the conference will be the catalan government 's last attempt to negotiate an agreed-upon referendum with the spanish government . 
  **  given the difficulty that rajoy and puigdemont have had setting up a meeting to agree on a referendum in catalonia , the conference will be used as the government 's last offer to negotiate . 
  the main argument used to defend the need to hold the vote will be the signatures collected by the national pact for the referendum ( pnr ) . 
  indeed , this campaign will have come to an end on the 19th of may , only three days before the conference in madrid is due to take place .
