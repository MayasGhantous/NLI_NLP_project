  so far , the pnr has collected more than 400,000 signatures from institutions , organizations , elected representatives , and private individuals , both within and outside of the country in support of holding a referendum on the catalonia 's political future . 
   the main political parties in spain will be invited to attend the conference , as well as many representatives from the business field . 
  puigdemont 's intention was to hold the conference in the spanish senate , but the institution refused to allow it . 
  the event will be held at `` caja de la m\u00fasica '' auditorium instead , with a capacity for some 250 people . 
  wow nice !, 
  i want to see images of your * ugly concrete suburb * , 
  the hospital de sant pau is a hospital [ complex ] ( http://www.photographerofdreams.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hospital_sant_pau_visione_aerea.jpg ) built between 1901 and 1930 , designed by the catalan modernisme architect llu\u00eds dom\u00e8nech i montaner ( * the other gaud\u00ed , for tourists * ) . 
  it was a fully functioning hospital until june 2009 , when [ this ] ( http://www.santpau.cat/image/journal/article?img_id=408460&amp;t=1494249210655 ) new hospital opened next to it ( with the same name ) . 
  today the modernista clomplex is a museum and popular tourist attraction , being an unesco world heritage site . 
  visitors can see the full complex and the underground tunnels ( [ * website * ] ( https://www.santpaubarcelona.org/en/visits ) ) . 
  the [ street ] ( http://www.ainb.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/avinguda_gaud%c3%ad.jpg ) connecting 2 of the most famous modernista monuments of barcelona is called : ** avinguda de gaud\u00ed ** ( * gaud\u00ed 's avenue * ) . 
   like a small diagonal that breaks with the perfect grid layout of the eixample , the avinguda gaud\u00ed stretches proudly from the sagrada fam\u00edlia towards the hospital de sant pau . 
  a semi-pedestrianised street that connects two magnificent landmarks , one by gaud\u00ed and the other by dom\u00e8nech i montaner . 
   building work on the new hospital de la santa creu i sant pau began in 1909 , and led to the construction of a new street that would connect the hospital with the church of the sagrada familia . 
  this is how the avinguda gaud\u00ed came into being . 
  with gaud\u00ed 's church at one end and dom\u00e9nech i muntaner 's modernista complex at the other , this is a bustling semi-pedestrianised street . 
  in spite of the busy cross-streets , this artery features all the elements that give it the appearance of a boulevard : restricted vehicular access , bollards on either side , pavement caf\u00e9s and a whole host of shops which delight lovers of typical neighbourhood shops . 
   this is a lively street which showcases a series of modernista [ streetlamps ] ( http://lh5.ggpht.com/_eculggu_njg/s1rvl30z5oi/aaaaaaaahzq/divvpwyjnty/s1600/11perefalqu%c3%a9surp%c3%adfanalsavda.gaud%c3%ad.jpg ) designed by pere falqu\u00e9s that lend it an elegant touch and unique style . 
  because valencian and catalan are the same language . 
  it 's like having an andalusian version of the spanish constitution ... 
  in fact if you watch at the top-right corner of the `` boe '' website , you can see that the website is also translated in one language they call `` catalan/valencian '' . 
  yeah i know ... 
  i 'm used having to fight vs friends to not go to other villages beaches and stay in barcelona xd they are usually very clean since they clean the beaches in barcelona every day , so probably the only `` problem '' is the people ( packed ) . 
  but to me is not a problem . 
  ehmm i 'm a local ... and i love going there since i was born :p, 
  damn croatia i want you guys on the final !, 
  you made me laugh with that double voice and 360 turn to the camera xd and your `` let it go '' style song was cool too !, 
  yep i 'm sure !, 
  i have looked some pictures and looks better than the video . 
  maybe the music did n't help xd, 
  [ source ] ( http://www.ara.cat/cultura/congres-treure-franco-valle-caidos_0_1793820716.html ), 
  you explained it pretty good . 
   it really was a nice idea to have a decentralized government , but it does not work very well in practice . 
  the sentence by / u/olosta _ is pretty self-explanatory coming from a french guy . 
  france is one fo the best examples of a centralized country , and one of the best examples of why it 's a horrible way of administrating a country . 
  germany on the other hand is a good example of a decentralized country . 
  competition is good , and countries must assure many regions and cities can develop and progress the same as the `` natural capital '' . 
  like germany ( frankfurt , berlin , etc. ), 
  or the united states ( new york , la , etc. ) . 
  there 's a phrase used here in barcelona by some experts to denounce centralization efforts by the spanish government : '' * spain , capital paris * '' . 
  it 's a way of criticizing these moves , that could led the country towards a centralization that nobody wants ( france ) . 
  mmhm it looks ... kinda sad ? 
  i do n't know maybe it 's me , coming from a city by the mediterranean sea :p, 
  tl ; dr :  the spanish parliament approved a bill this thursday presented by the spanish socialist party ( psoe ) aimed at removing the mortal remains of the two dictators francisco franco and jos\u00e9 antonio primo de rivera 's from the valle de los ca\u00eddos basilica . 
  the text calls for this monumental complex to `` stop being a francoist and national-catholic landmark '' and to instead be turned into `` a space for reconciliation and collective and democratic memory , aimed at dignifying and recognizing the victims of the spanish civil war and of the dictatorship '' . 
   although it was a non-binding proposal , the governing spanish conservative , people 's party ( pp ) , abstained from voting . 
  catalan left-wing pro-independence erc also abstained , but because they considered the proposal to be insufficient . 
  imagine living here in catalonia xd it 's not that easy man !, 
  the catalan government and more than 80 % of the catalan population want to hold a referendum . 
  the spanish government does n't want to let catalans vote . 
  so you can expect daily news from both sides ( you can read links i posted in comment up to see it by yourself ) . 
  literally there 's something new everyday xd, 
  well this happened last 21 april . 
  the most recent news are the announcement of the catalan government published in the official journal to buy the ballot boxes . 
  at the same time : * [ * spanish prosecutor weighing charges against catalan government for buying ballot boxes * ] ( http://www.catalannewsagency.com/politics/item/spanish-prosecutor-weighing-charges-against-catalan-government-for-buying-ballot-boxes ) ( 9 may ) * [ * spanish constitutional court partially suspends catalan law on non-binding referenda * ] ( http://www.catalannewsagency.com/politics/item/spanish-constitutional-court-partially-suspends-catalan-law-for-consultations ) ( 10 may ) in relation with what op posted , this is a video of the commitment : https://youtu.be/t8adha2gia0?t=10s ( 21 april ), 
  finally !, 
  this is one of the changes we really need in the eu . 
  just common sense . 
  eurosceptics will complain ( and here i 'm with them ) about the wasting of money for institutions stuff like this one , when there 's no need !, 
  we literally have 2 european parliaments for no reason at all ... 
  i remember european mps talking about this , how every x weeks they needed to pack all their stuff in boxes and a `` special team '' will come to their brussels office to take the boxes , put them on a train to strasbourg , and the next day the mps will find their boxes in their strasbourg offices . 
  after the strasbourg period finished they pack everything and all starts over again . 
  of course you can imagine how many millions are wasted just in moving hundreds of people and their stuff from one country to another , for no reason at all . 
  on the other hand i do n't like the ema thing , since i wanted it to be in barcelona xd and the majority of current ema workers already said they preferred moving to barcelona . 
  plus we already discussed how the ema should be in a city investing in medicines , biomedicine investigation ... etc. 
  like barcelona , amsterdam or frankfurt ... so i do n't know if strasbourg is good . 
  ok there are many issues the eu can improve and many of them the eu already acknowledges . 
  if there 's one good thing about brexit is precisely triggering the reform process . 
  i 'm going to name 2 : * one basic problem is the eu not being able to explain itself to the people . 
  people do n't `` see '' the eu on a daily basis or on the news . 
  the eu is not as close to you , like your local/regional/state government . 
  but despite this `` feeling '' , in fact the eu is present on almost every aspect of your life . 
  and this is something many people do n't know , because they are not told it . 
  and this is a problem . 
  if the eu does n't explain all the `` good '' things the eu does , how can we expect all the people being pro-eu ? 
  sometimes i feel the best people to know all the things the eu does are us , the law students . 
  as a law student myself i have noticed that we not only have 1 subject about it on the degree ( called * european union law * ) , but almost every subject has eu law on it . 
  i did n't know that before studying law . 
  it does n't matter the subject , from family law , to consumers right ( eu law protects consumers , setting a minimum standard of rights for all countries ; countries ca n't legislate lower standards than the eu ones ) , to criminal law , tax law , administrative law ... 
  seriously , is difficult to think a subject in people 's life where the eu has n't make a change/improvement for the people . 
  and this needs to be explained . 
  * democratic deficit . 
  this is a problem studied for many years . 
  the parliament of the eu does n't have as much power as it probably should . 
  the institutions should be reformed to ensure people have more direct voice . 
   if you honestly think the eu will change , you are extremely naive . 
  since its foundation the eu has been constantly changing and evolving . 
  you ca n't say that ... the present eu is nothing compared with what was the eu 10 years ago . 
  and 20 years ago ? 
  compare the eu with the united nations and tell me about change . 
   what happened after brexit ? 
  did the eu admit they have flaws and planned to strive to fix their issues ? 
  yes and many times . 
  if this is not a clear will to reflect and change for you , then i do n't know : https://ec.europa.eu/commission/white-paper-future-europe-reflections-and-scenarios-eu27_en, 
  before then we hope the eu will have been already reformed for the better !, 
  we need to learn from the mistakes that took us to brexit . 
  we survived frexit . 
  so now it 's time to get the eu back on track !, 
  we needed this indeed !, 
  good for the french and good for us all in europe ,
