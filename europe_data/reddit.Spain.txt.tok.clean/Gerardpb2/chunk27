  i wonder who will step up to fill the massive hole in the rural uk money pot we 're going to leave . 
  more londonmoney ? 
  wow that many years already !? 
  it seems like it was only yesterday ... 
  i still remember when all the clubs had this hit !, 
  2 words : '' ** el cl\u00e1sico ** '' . 
  and well history/tradition and all stuff . 
   as everyone should do despite their different ideals maybe these images make you change your opinion : * [ afroamerican jesse owens on the podium after winning at the berlin 1936 summer olympics , not doing the nazi salute ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/bundesarchiv_bild_183-g00630%2c_sommerolympiade%2c_siegerehrung_weitsprung.jpg ) * [ kathrine switzer running the boston marathon in 1967 . 
  race official trying to stop her since women were not allowed ] ( https://sports-images.vice.com/images/2016/05/12/por-qu-el-deporte-es-poltica-body-image-1463050949.jpg?resize=1220:*&amp;output-quality=75 ) * [ muhammad ali , a symbol for civil rights activism ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2016/6/4/f508b6be3fd14058b445f200af271fd8_8.jpg ) and the list goes on ... sports has always been a politics window . 
  what are the olympic games , the euros or the world cup ? 
  gon na leave you something a wise man once said :  those who defend sports should not mix with politics usually belong to 2 categories : they are either ingenious souls who have n't realized how the world works ... or what they are trying to say is that sports should n't mix with the politics * they do n't like * . 
  this last case is the most frequent , and it still can be dangerous , because at the end it 's only a crude attempt of censorship . 
   everything we do is politics . 
  maybe the only way of not doing politics at all is being all day lying down on the couch watching big brother ; i do n't dismiss this being what , those who demand not mixing sports and politics , in fact want : all the others spending the whole day without doing anything at all . 
   maybe it 's a legacy from that fateful person who said it many years ago : '' * be like me and do n't go into politics * '' ( francisco franco , fascist dictator of spain ) . 
  some things are not meant to be seen ... 
  what ? 
  i do n't understand you ... 
   the opening of the route means barcelona becomes the fifth european city to have direct flights to shanghai and beijing finally yes !!!, 
  this summer also we are getting los angeles and san francisco !, 
  and tokyo is almost ready . 
  as usual * rainymeadow * just comes here to troll and manipulate , and then leaves . 
  he just wants to leave `` his message '' hoping someone ( from europe ) will believe it . 
  his message is simple :  * catalans are bad people and corrupts and they want independence so they can be more bad people and corrupts . 
  *  * fc barcelona are also corrupts that 's why they want independence . 
  * even though fc barcelona never positioned in favor of independence ... 
  president of catalonia [ twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/krls/status/860876275178762240 ) reaction :  la democr\u00e0cia ens agermana . 
  * translation : democracy unites us as brothers . 
  * meaning : fc barcelona anthem lyrics say '' * una bandera ens agermana * '' , which means `` one flag unites us as brothers '' . 
  the president played with that sentence . 
  ** credits ** : [ from the flight deck ] ( https://twitter.com/golfcharlie232/status/854026554896261122 ), 
  i 'm not denying some barcelona presidents evaded taxes . 
  like many real madrid presidents did ( and the current one do ) , and other european clubs . 
  it 's a real problem in top football teams from all over the world , and not only barcelona ( a team far below compared with corruption in other teams like madrid for instance ) . 
  you are trolling because what you said here has nothing to do with the link i posted : supporting a democratic referendum . 
  you just wanted to attack something you do n't like ( catalans voting their future ) , and you said the first thing you came up with to attack it the hard way . 
  if barcelona tax evasion is a problem for you , why you do n't submit a link here in reddit in a new post and let us all analyze it in detail ? 
  why here commenting something has nothing to do with ? 
  just read what you said :  the longer their populist friends are in charge , the more they can steal . 
  what does that even mean ? 
  who are you trying to fool ? 
  i 'm tired of seeing you trolling every place on reddit ... you are even so `` smart '' that you did n't realize that what you said is so stupid . 
  you are implying the fact the longer * catalonia is part of spain * , the longer * they can steal more * . 
  because catalonia can not adopt legislation in criminal law and tax law fraud ; is the spanish one being applied . 
  and the spanish law in tax fraud sucks ( i agree with you here ) . 
  so with a new country ( catalonia ) , new legislation can be approved to solve this problem . 
  you see what you said ? 
  edit : oh now you edited your comment to add '' * the same applies to real madrid too * '' , just in case your trolling was too clear ... 
  why are you trolling on every `` catalan '' thing you see on reddit ? 
  edit : wow you edited you comment below to add '' * the same applies to real madrid too * '' , but of course you are not going to say it in the comment up here , because it does n't help with your argument when attacking something you do n't like ( catalans voting on referendum about their future ) . 
   i do n't get this , it 's like moving out of your parents and going to their house to eat and do the laundry . 
  well for many people football is not the most important thing in their lifes . 
  i mean i do n't think when people want independence ( for x many reasons ) they stop to think what will happen with their football team and make their ultimate decision based on that . 
   i never imagined a sports entity supporting an independence movement ok you have to differentiate/be more precise here , because that sentence is not ture . 
  supporting a democratic referendum so the catalan people can decide their future , is not the same as `` supporting an independence movement '' . 
  bar\u00e7a is supporting a referendum ; in other words bar\u00e7a supports both the people voting yes and voting no , that 's what a referendum means . 
  i understand it can be `` weird '' when seen from an outside perspective , specially when comparing fc barcelona with sports clubs from other countries . 
  but here in catalonia it 's seen as a natural thing . 
  fc barcelona is part of the catalan culture and history , and part of the society . 
  just by reading this from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fc_barcelona ) 's article , you can get an idea of what fc barcelona represents ( more than a club ) :  founded in 1899 by a group of swiss , english and catalan footballers led by joan gamper , the club has become a symbol of catalan culture and catalanism , hence the motto `` m\u00e9s que un club '' ( english : `` more than a club '' ) . 
  unlike many other football clubs , the supporters own and operate fc barcelona . 
  fc barceona is a `` catalan '' team and it has always been involved supporting whatever the catalan society do . 
  in this case , a referendum about `` creating '' a new country is an important thing for the catalan people , therefore fc barcelona shows support ( without expressing one choice about the voting options : favor or against independence ) . 
  you have to go back in history to understand it better ; during franco dictatorship in spain ( where catalan language and culture was persecuted by the spanish government and many catalans were executed ) , fc barcelona represented the resistance of the catalan people fighting for democracy . 
  so you have many examples of the club engaging with the society , for example fc barcelona also supported the non-binding [ referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_self-determination_referendum,_2014 ) we had in catalonia on 2014 . 
  or a few years ago when then the spanish government `` contested '' the presence of catalan language in schools of catalonia , you could see puyol ( barcelona captain ) or guardiola ( manager of barcelona ) expressing his disagreement with this decisions and supporting the catalan schools and students . 
  and of course many non-political stuff : like [ la marat\u00f3 ] ( http://www.ccma.cat/tv3/marato/en/ ) ( a catalan tv initiative to raise funds for scientific research into diseases which are currently incurable ) , etc. 
  tl ; dr : what 's my opinion ? 
  i like a powerful organization like fc barcelona connecting with its society and showing support on many aspects . 
  fc barcelona 's motto is `` more than a club '' and i like it not being only a `` motto '' , but really making an impact on society and roots . 
  bar\u00e7a has been doing the same since last century when it was a small team , and i like it keeps doing it now despite being a top world rich team . 
   i thought the status of fcb was in question should catalonia become independent well nothing is official . 
  opinions of managers , players , journalists and people . 
  of course neither la liga or the clubs have anything official said . 
  anyway barcelona signed in support for the referendum , not for the `` yes '' or the `` no '' . 
  just supporting the fact the referendum can take place . 
  lol that was real ? 
  xd well in the case of fc barcelona this has been a conversation here in spain for the last decades . 
  it 's been said that in case of independence , bar\u00e7a would be allowed to keep playing in la liga . 
  just as monaco plays in french league . 
  today fc barcelona signed for the ** national pact for the referendum ** [ campaign ] ( https://pactepelreferendum.cat/en ) ( founded on 23th december 2016 ) . 
  this is the campaign 's manifest ( approved on 1st february 2017 ) :  the people of catalonia 's feeling of nationhood and their longing for self-government have undeniably deep historical roots , and have repeatedly been manifested throughout history . 
  at the current time , catalonia is part of spain , which , for irrefutable historical , linguistic and cultural reasons is plurinational , although this fact is not acknowledged by its political structures . 
   catalonia 's desire to decide its own political future has become increasingly apparent to the whole world . 
  to the point of becoming a sustained longing , which now reflects the will of the great majority of its people . 
   the right to decide one 's political future is universally recognized as being one of the essential and inalienable rights of democratic societies . 
  it is this right that underlies the demand by a majority of the citizens of catalonia , who wish to exercise it through the means of a referendum . 
   we wish to state that the catalan people 's desire to express their will via a referendum is the majority view and cuts across all strata of society ; and it is in keeping with the civic , peaceful and democratic determination expressed in the multitudinous demonstrations held by organized society in favour of its right to decide . 
   we uphold that the current spanish legal framework , as confirmed by constitutional experts , allows for a referendum to be held in catalonia in agreement with the state . 
  if this option has not been pursued so far it is due to a lack of political will on behalf of successive spanish governments . 
  the law , since it is open to multiple interpretations , ought to be understood as an instrument for finding democratic solutions to political problems and not a means to create new ones or exacerbate those that already exist . 
   the individuals , organizations and institutions that countersign this manifesto view the referendum as a unique instrument for consolidating democracy , for allowing plural political debate , the search for consensus and ultimately the implementation of effective agreements . 
   therefore :  we urge the governments of catalonia and spain to overcome the political obstacles and their preconceptions , and to finally reach an agreement that establishes the conditions and the fair and necessary guarantees for holding a referendum recognized by the international community , the result of which should be politically binding and effective . 
   we recognize the parliament of catalonia as the democratic institution which expresses the popular will of the country . 
  therefore , we support any initiatives and agreements that it should make relating to the holding of this referendum . 
   we express our belief that the referendum is an inclusive tool that will allow the free expression of the different positions that the citizens of catalonia hold regarding the political relationship between catalonia and spain . 
   we declare that democratic culture demands political solutions to political problems . 
  this is done by appealing to the fundamental mechanism available to contemporary societies : acknowledging and validating the majority will of the people in the form of a vote . 
   the referendum ought to ensure everyone feels they have been invited to participate . 
  this requires a scrupulously democratic , plural and equal debate between the legitimate options that currently exist in catalonia .
