  we are being spammed with croatia pictures !!!, 
  no but seriously , looks beautiful !, 
  definetely a country that i should visit someday , a hidden gem starting to be not-so-hidden for world tourism  pd : like [ wtf ] ( https://croatiareviews.com/media/reviews/photos/original/77/83/70/4-brijuni-islands-national-park-46-1428767989.jpg ), 
   they already had a ` referendum ' an won it two years ago it was a ** non-binding ** referendum to know people 's opinion on the subject . 
  more info about the 2014 vote [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_self-determination_referendum,_2014 ) the idea now , of course , is in 2017 to make a binding and definitive referendum of independence . 
  so you ca n't compare it with the 2014 one . 
   pro-independence flair mafia oh my god ... 
  i agree with your chinese analysis . 
  but i do n't know man , every chard or study i have seen seems to point out chinese presence . 
  we have to consider china will be ( and already is ) the world 's economic leader . 
  and they are not very good at english . 
  so chinese to `` connect '' with them will be crucial . 
  well we are used being criticized and attacked just for being what we are . 
  ant the problem is i know `` rainymeadow '' pretty well from other conversations , and he has always shown his attacks and disrespects against catalan people , culture and language . 
  so i can `` imagine '' his gif to follow the same line , even tho i do n't understand it . 
  but anyway , if you can explain us the meaning of the gif he posted it would be nice . 
  it means the `` average '' catalan would pay more for the ballot box ? 
  why the first person offers a bill but the other takes all the money ? 
  seriously i do n't understand it . 
  the other option would be rainymeadow himself explaining what he means with the gif and the sencence '' * the average catalan paying for those boxes * '' . 
  me neither to be honest . 
  wanted to ask what it meant , but then i realized how * against anything catalan-related * / u/rainymeadow is , and preferred not to do it . 
  so yeah it must be something against the catalan people . 
  mmhm i did n't know about yelp !, 
  gon na try another statistic then , this time leaving all the `` general knowledge '' stuff and focusing in tourism : according to unwto [ ranking ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_tourism_rankings#most_visited_destinations_by_international_tourist_arrivals ) spain currently is the 3rd most visited country in the world ( france is 1st and the us comes 2nd ) . 
  within spain , the most visited region is [ catalonia ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/vangdata/20150922/54435412973/espana-sigue-batiendo-records-de-turistas-internacionales-ranking-por-paises-y-cc-aa.html ) . 
  barcelona is the capital city of catalonia . 
  and sagrada fam\u00edlia is the most visited [ attraction ] ( http://elviajero.elpais.com/elviajero/2016/11/07/album/1478528593_717313.html#1478528593_717313_1478529504 ) in all spain . 
  what we get from this ? 
  considering / u/vokegaf is american , and according to statistics , if he wants to travel there 's a high probability he would be doing it in one of these places : * a ) on his country . 
  americans enjoy doing national tourism in their big country . 
  * b ) in france . 
  some [ statistics ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/articles/spain-enjoys-tourism-surge-as-france-and-turkey-suffer ) show that fear of terrorism caused considerable tourism decline in france , in favor of other destinations ( like spain ) . 
  would this ( fear of terrorism ) be a variable in consideration for our lovely american subject when choosing a travel destination ? 
  we do n't know , but we should take it into account when doing this analysis !, 
  * c ) in spain . 
  if going there , there 's a high probability he would go to barcelona . 
  and if going there , there 's a high probability he would visit the sagrada fam\u00edlia . 
  and even if our american subject does n't travel or he travels to another destination ( china or even antarctica ) , there 's a really high probability he knows at least 1 person on his family or friends who matches with the analysis we have made here : in other words he must know someone who has been in barcelona ; and therefore someone who has visited the sagrada fam\u00edlia . 
  it 's even more probable right now on his facebook he has one friend with at least 1 picture uploaded with the church . 
  i love them too xd, 
  people have also to take in mind sagrada fam\u00edlia is one of the most complex and difficult buildings ever designed , with hyperboloid , parabolyds and pretty complex and advanced geometry . 
  experts say gaud\u00ed was 100 years ahead of his time ; a genius architect like no other . 
  during the 80 's and 90 's architects had to use the most advanced aeronautical computer software available to comprehend some parts of the church . 
  and it was n't until 3 years ago when finally there was a 3d printer good enough to make the first perfect and detailed 3d model of the finished church : http://info7.blob.core.windows.net.optimalcdn.com/images/2016/11/11/607577_la-sagrada-familia-10.jpg i recommend this english documentary that explains some of these things : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znnwpmdwm1w, 
  you did n't know who [ antoni gaud\u00ed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antoni_gaud%c3%ad ) was ? 
  like where have you been hiding ? 
  xd no , seriously but at least sagrada fam\u00edlia ... for real recently tripadvisor announced * sagrada fam\u00edlia is the first place in the world to receive 100,000 tripadvisor reviews ( with the eiffel tower and central park not far behind ) * . 
  even [ homer simpson ] ( http://cdn.20m.es/img2/recortes/2013/11/14/146893-944-537.jpg ) has visited it !, 
  why down-voting ? 
  it 's true : s https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_tallest_church_buildings#under_construction, 
  which one if not spanish ? 
  like for real i thought this was a `` non-discussion topic '' when talking about languages ... 
  which language you think will be more powerful than the '' [ 3 kings ] ( https://learnspanishaustralia.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/mapa-de-los-top-3-more-spoken-languages1.png ) '' ( english , spanish and chinese ) ? 
  english and spanish will become the future * lingua franca * of the world . 
  spanish is the `` language '' of one full continent : america . 
  all the countries there have spanish as the 1st or 2nd language ( except canada ) . 
  and some of them ( like mexico ) are expected to become world economic powers . 
  united states for instance , is expected to become before 2050 the largest spanish speaking country in the world !, 
  spanish will become a vital language for business . 
  spanish will be a vital language in diplomacy and global issues . 
  spanish has official status in countries from america , europe and africa ; with former presence also in asia . 
  being also the only language in the world that is official in all these international organizations : united nations , european union , african union , nafta ( north america ) , and unasur ( south america ) . 
   a 2013 report by the british council , titled `` languages for the future `` , identified spanish as the most important language for people in the uk to learn , above arabic , french and mandarin https://www.studyinternational.com/news/spanish-the-global-language-of-the-future/#2dx5olcwlb2au0hx.97 french was an important language in the past . 
  but from many years ago , french status has been declining . 
  a globalized world means french wo n't have a bright future . 
  but the study is not only about native speakers , but economy , diplomacy , etc. 
  anyway we know in the future there will be '' ** 3 major world languages ** '' : * english * spanish * chinese with these three you 'll free to do everything . 
  maybe adding hindi-urdu too ? 
  french 's too , in favor of spanish . 
  world economic forum study ( [ * these are the most powerful languages in the world * ] ( https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/12/these-are-the-most-powerful-languages-in-the-world ) ) : * [ power language index ranking ( now ) ] ( https://assets.weforum.org/editor/xnyioynylztdq8ntjhmtgczio-v9eybul27f03vmlui.png ) * [ power language index ranking ( 2050 ) ] ( https://assets.weforum.org/editor/rul500v_jqk9vmwqskalccn7ulxdddxjh50rmm65mbc.png ), 
  since when constitutions include an article about '' * referendums on independence of regions within the country * '' ? . 
  this has never happened in history ( except in one soviet union constitution ? 
  some people here might explain it better ) , because it 's not the objective of the constitutions . 
  `` independencies '' are not regulated in the constitution of the countries they want to declare independence from . 
  this has never happened looking at all the independencies that have happened in history . 
  specially in the case of spain , a country being used to having regions declaring independence from it ; cuba for instance . 
  you have hundreds of jurists , constitutional law teachers , lawyers and judges saying a referendum on independence in catalonia is 100 % compatible with the current spanish constitution . 
  for example you have this in catalan : [ * more than 600 catalan jurists affirm the referendum is not only legitimate but legal * ] ( http://www.elnacional.cat/ca/politica/juristes-referendum_155334_102.html ) . 
  if you read the spanish constitution you can see that , as every other constitution on earth , it does n't regulate the independencies of its regions ( neither permitting nor prohibiting ) . 
  what you are trying to say is the position of the spanish government ( pp political party , anti-independence and anti-referendum ) . 
  and we should look at it in detail since it 's really interesting . 
  reforming the spanish constitution ( a rigid constitution really difficult to change ) to include the possibility of independence of regions in spain or referendum , means this long process : * 1 \\ . 
  approval of the reform in the congress ( by a 2/3 majority of its members ) : almost impossible . 
  but maybe the most `` realistic '' part of this crazy journey . 
  approval of the reform in the senate ( by a 2/3 majority of its members ) : impossible , since pp political party has the absolute majority of the seats . 
  from here everything down is 100 % impossible . 
  dissolution of the houses and new elections . 
  the houses elected must ratify the decision and approve again the new constitutional text , by ( again ) a 2/3 majority of the members of both houses ( congress and senate ) . 
  once the amendment has been passed , it shall be submitted to ratification by referendum . 
  so the whole spain ( from galicia , to canary islands , to ceuta , madrid , etc. ), 
  shall vote in favor of catalonia being able to have a referendum in independence . 
  which is extremely crazy to think they would vote for . 
  therefore with this strategy of the constitutional reform the government of spain knows 100 % there will never be a referendum in catalonia and therefore catalonia will never become an independent country . 
  so you want it to count ? 
  the `` yes '' won by more than 80 % of the votes . 
  therefore we should become an independent country now , right ? 
  of course not ... you rainymeadow are lying as always , pretending you do n't know the fact it was a ** non-binding ** referendum to know people 's opinion on the subject . 
  * the `` citizen participation process on the political future of catalonia '' was a non-binding vote on the political future of catalonia that was held by the government of catalonia on 9 november 2014 * . 
  people interested in knowing more about the non-binding referendum of 2014 can read the pretty extended [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_self-determination_referendum,_2014 ) .
