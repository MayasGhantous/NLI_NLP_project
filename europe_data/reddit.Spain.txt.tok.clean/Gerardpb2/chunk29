  maybe for you are `` shitty and irrelevant '' , but they definitely are n't for the catalan people , for the majority of spanish people ( maybe you do n't watch/read the news , but they all talked about it ) and for the people of europe who are interested . 
  you say i 'm `` permanently '' posting propaganda , which is not true at all . 
  it 's specially fun when coming from [ you ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/_permafrost_ ) . 
  more than 15 of your last 25 comments are about catalonia independence , a subject you ironically seem really `` interested '' in . 
  but more interesting is reading all of your comments , being basically disrespectful anti-catalan and anti-democratic . 
  curious this pathetic thread where you commented , saying `` kids in catalonia are indoctrinated in xenophobia against spain '' , a disgusting and lying thing to say . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6928mo/hatred_towards_spain_in_catalan_classrooms/dh3e5tf/ ) user pretty much explained everything . 
  so in conclusion , you can permanently post opinions against catalan people , referendum or whatever . 
  but i ca n't post a fact that happened yesterday which was on the news in whole country and i believe can be of interested to european people ? 
  come on ... 
  that 's why there will be a referendum , to proof/solve the issue . 
  in democracies that 's how we solve these things . 
  i do n't know if '' * the catalonian independence spectacle went out of fashion 2 years ago * '' . 
  last summer polls indicated more than 55 % of people in favor of independence . 
  last polls indicated people against independence winning by a narrow margin . 
  so i would say it 's pretty close . 
  also the polls about the people wanting to hold a referendum on independence indicate an absolute majority of 80 % people wanting to vote . 
  and i think this is the important statistic we should see . 
  if you were catalan you 'll understand . 
  everybody wants to vote and the independence discussions are permanent topic conversation here in catalonia , from universities to the bars . 
  wtf ? 
  this is not `` pro-indepencence '' . 
  in a referendum people can both vote in favor of independence or against it . 
  i posted this link since it was in english . 
  what 's wrong with it ? 
  is the same information you can find in all spanish and catalan media since yesterday . 
  i think it 's a pretty important issue . 
  are you ok with spanish newspapers like el pa\u00eds or abc ( 100 % anti-independence ) ? 
  you can see the topic is important when there are 1265 comments ! ),

  something [ similar ] ( https://www.escapadarural.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/127.jpg ) close to barcelona ... yo can see the [ full ] ( http://cloud10.todocoleccion.online/postales-cataluna/tc/2014/07/12/22/44219533.jpg ) church when the water level is low in drought times . 
  the village was completely submerged to build a [ dam ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pgbvmrdklsg/t5hdnsm9mqi/aaaaaaaachk/bm1d1tctzgg/s1600/img141.jpg ) : /, 
  wow this reminds me when current emir of qatar wanted to build the tallest mosque in the world in barcelona !, 
  with an estimated budget of 2.200 million euros to just buy the terrain . 
  it would have been `` cool '' since we would have had in the same city the tallest church in the world ( sagrada fam\u00edlia ) and the tallest mosque in the world . 
  the proposed location was on the current unused [ la monumental ] ( http://porisrael.org/files/2014/06/monumental-barcelona.jpg ) bullfighting arena , since the parliament of catalonia passed a law in 2010 banning bullfighting events for ever . 
  the mosque will have had a capacity of 40.000 people and a 300 metres tall minaret . 
  the mosque included shops , restaurants , conference room and a islam history museum . 
  the construction companies were the german ksp engel , zimmermann architekten , krebs and kiefer international . 
  but maybe was a too much crazy project , and the catalan society would have never accepted it . 
  * until 2026 , when [ sagrada fam\u00edlia ] ( http://www.godsmurf.com/photos/2007-12-barcelona/barcelona-sagrada-familia-002.jpg ) will become the tallest church in the world with 172,5 metres , 
  except it 's not a cathedral , but a church consecrated by the pope in 2010 as a basilica . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.hcchotels.com/files/catedral.jpg ) is the ( only ) cathedral of barcelona , and therefore seat of the archbishop of barcelona . 
  was constructed from the 13th to 15th centuries . 
  i 'm going to add this taken from the official sagrada fam\u00edlia :  to put the finishing touches on easter week , this year we had a magnificent light show on the passion fa\u00e7ade on 10 , 11 and 12 april 2017 . 
  this show followed the stations of the cross -- the path to calvary -- with a voiceover set to music accompanying the lights that narrated the 12 images of the passion and death of jesus christ . 
  the show was free and open to all . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypzkvnlx2r4 ) the video . 
  quick facts : * [ highly recommended english short documentary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znnwpmdwm1w ) * construction started in 1882 . 
  gaud\u00ed was a genius and one the best architects in world history . 
  according to his sagrada fam\u00edlia plannings , design and complex geometry knowledge , it 's said by experts gaud\u00ed was 100 years ahead of his time . 
  * construction of the architectonic aspects of the church will finish in 2026 ( including all 18 towers , now in 2017 there are only 8 finished ) . 
  the symbolic and artistic parts and also the exterior access plaza and bridge will still be going for more years . 
  * sagrada fam\u00edlia will become the tallest church in the world with 172,5 m and the tallest building in barcelona . 
  the montju\u00efc hill/mountain in barcelona is 173m , because gaud\u00ed did n't wanted a human created building to be taller than what god created . 
  in case anyone interested there 's a forum thread about [ sagrada fam\u00edlia construction ] ( http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=219763&amp;page=157 ) that started in 2005 and still goes on today with daily updates showing pictures of almost every stone being build and discussions about the progress . 
  i love reading it time by time , seeing the constant improvements of the masterpiece .

  you can watch the video scene [ here ] ( https://vimeo.com/79441613 ), 
  whatever i do n't like your ( old/obsolete ) way of thinking . 
  i 'm glad almost nobody in europe thinks like you ... ca n't imagine returning to a medieval world where everybody has to pay for their health treatments and if they do n't have the money they just die . 
  i 'm not taking you wrong xd that 's how many people here call it !, 
  or barcelona 's dick also . 
  i have n't listened it as much lately these years , but after its construction was a daily thing you would listen on conversations . 
  ps : we are talking about a medicines agency , that 's why we need a suppository building :d, 
  both you and me now our government ( catalan pro-independence ) is 100 % pro-eu , so there 's no way we would have a `` catexit '' like the uk . 
  also the majority of population is pro-eu ; the only political party supporting leaving eu in catalonia is the one with less representation . 
  also on a personal level i love eu and i know the future of europe is a unified europe with regions ( not countries ) , 
  thanks for your opinion . 
  as i said i 'm not going to start a discussion of an issue i have already discussed 1000 times and studied as a lawyer myself . 
  many experts say catalonia will be a member state without having to rejoin again , for many reasons that now i do n't feel like explaining again . 
  just want to say : spain is not going to veto catalonia in eu ( spain will end up losing much more for many reasons , specially considering catalonia is spain 's gateway to europe ; spain wo n't accept having a border with eu with all their exports/imports currently going to france through catalonia ; so catalonia must be an eu member state ) . 
  anyway now barcelona is the official ( and only ) spanish city proposed by the spanish government to eu as ema headquarter . 
  so let 's not go off-topic again !, 
  oh no ... not again this discussion please  _ < we are going to be in the european union , either as a free catalonia or within spain , do n't worry !, 
  those people that `` prefer '' to smoke are the ones who are going to cost you and your country hundreds of millions in healthcare treatments . 
  why not make them pay for it ? 
  their decision has consequences . 
  cancer treatments are not precisely cheap , 
  love it !, 
  so ... where then ? 
  i believe * where most medicine tests and approvals needs to be done * is where the ema is located :p, 
  and i would love to work in the [ torre agbar ] ( http://cdn02.visitbarcelona.com/files/5445-7583-imagen/torre-agbar-noche-arquitectura-barcelona-pf-c1.jpg ) : /, 
  yep , but andorra has no plans to join the eu . 
  i love andorra ( been there multiple times ) , but we will be the first :p, 
  indeed ... ridiculous considered the amount of catalan speakers . 
  more spoken than many european languages currently officially recognized . 
  soon we 'll have our own country and our language will finally be accepted in eu :d, 
  yep !, 
  well maybe its older versions ( k3 ) . 
  `` nice '' :p do n't mind me , the picture is nice !, 
  but living in barcelona i would call this a cloudy day xd, 
  gibraltar is the last colony in europe , which is illegal on the 21st century . 
  it must and will be returned back to spain at some point in the future . 
  that 's what the un said . 
  you mean [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/c5oaoiiusie?t=6m25s ) game . 
  barcelona from the iberian ** barkeno ** ( written like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:barkeno.png ) in iberian script ) :d,
