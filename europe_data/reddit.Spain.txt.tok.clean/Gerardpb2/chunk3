  but still they are not individual eu members as the title suggest , right ? 
   a lot of people do n't feel represented by their country . 
  no way `` a lot of '' . 
  in fact there are very few places in the world like catalonia ... 
  i mean scotland and catalonia in the eu are the only ones being really clear . 
  you ca n't make 2 flags ? 
  the scottish flag is there , so only the catalan one is missing . 
  you ca n't make 1 flag more ? 
  your point ... 
  in ** catalonia ** we have like 2 anthems ( only one of them official today ) : * ** [ els segadors ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg9lnsqnhck ) ** ( * the reapers * ) [ 1899 * de facto * , 1993 * de iure * ] : the national and official anthem of catalonia . 
  the song is based on the [ catalan revolt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_revolt ) ( 1640 -- 1659 ) where catalans fought against the count-duke of olivares , the chief minister of king philip iv of spain . 
  the anthem is a `` call '' to defense the freedom of the country . 
  it 's quite sad ( minor tonality ) , since the catalans lost the revolt . 
  * ** [ cant de la senyera ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dwcgqflore ) ** ( * song of the senyera ( flag ) * ) : i love this one , probably more than `` els segadors '' !, 
  it was prohibited during spain 's franco dictatorship , and became an anthem for catalanism and a * de facto * anthem for catalonia until `` els segadors '' was approved . 
  today is considered as the `` 2nd anthem '' , but not official . 
  ps : i like both spanish republic anthems ( [ himno de riego ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfygsaf-xyc ) ) , so cool the music rhythm and melody xd but the marcha real without lyrics is cool too . 
  working on that , 
  i did n't know wales was a member of the european union ps : many of us here do n't consider ourselves `` spaniards '' , so the spanish flag means nothing to me ... no offense . 
  in fact last study showed way more people consider themselves catalan than spaniards . 
  me too :(, 
  i see , makes sense xd, 
  i did n't name any city o.o and yes exactly , the data is population per sqkm for countries ( population density ) , not `` overcrowded countries '' . 
  on the basis of '' ** overcrowded ** '' [ definition ] ( http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/overcrowded ) : * containing too many people * . 
  just read the first lines of the article : '' * one of the most frustrating parts of the world 's biggest cities is overpopulation . 
  crowded subways , excessive traffic , sidewalks brimming with pedestrians ; the list goes on . 
  overpopulation is a new issue as well . 
  * '' puerto rico is at the antipodes of overcrowding . 
  even in old san juan . 
  now compare it with shinjuku ( world 's busiest transport hub , with more than 3 million daily passengers ) , ikebukuro , shibuya ... where you ca n't barely walk with so many people . 
  japan is ranked 38th on that list . 
  and here you have a picture of the `` overcrowded '' [ saint-martin ] ( http://www.cruisereviews.com/images/ports/caribbeanportreviews/stmaartenpics/stmarphilipsshoppingstreet.jpg ) , in one of the major streets . 
  when i went there was even less people . 
  saint-martin ranked 16th on that list . 
  `` crowded subways '' in tropical islands ... sure . 
  even india is considered less overcrowded than saint-martin according to that list xd the article does not even know what 's talking about . 
  it 's just ridiculous ... 
  missing the [ catalan ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/flag_of_catalonia.svg ) flag :( ps : i could only find [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/flag_of_catalonia_and_europe.svg ) lol, 
  every part of it . 
  the title says `` overcrowded '' , and that 's not true at all . 
  population per km2 is another thing . 
  japan is waaay more overcrowded than aruba , saint-martin or puerto rico ( i 've been in all these places ) , but of course is bigger . 
  the title should be countries by population density . 
  the list is weird ... puerto rico , aruba and saint-martin overcrowded ? 
  vatican city ? 
  like for the tourists or what ? 
  my definition of overcrowded is hong kong , definitely . 
  but not many of the other places . 
  that capitals !, 
  crazy amount of work behind this fa\u00e7ade ... 
  yeah i 've been there , both paris and sapporo . 
  and i agree it 's a whole other scale , definitely . 
  but i still wonder what will have happened if the eiffel tower never existed and we saw today a random prototype/drawing posted by / u/loulan about it . 
  maybe we would be saying how ugly that `` thing '' would look in paris , etc. 
  ps : i did n't know about the color !, 
  that reddish/japanese style is probably even uglier xd, 
  welcome to spain , you just have to look at [ mariano rajoy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwetrc6eb7s ) . 
  meanwhile our catalan president speaks 5 languages ... edit : lol the downvotes ? 
  i think it 's pretty sad a country like spain with , at least , 4 official languages and many more being spoken , standing at the bottom . 
  even worst than france ( that 's shocking ) . 
  unitary state in languages too , apparently . 
   i also encounter many catalonians who like to pad their numbers by claiming catal\u00e0 , valenci\u00e0 , eiviss\u00e0 , menorqu\u00ed , mallorqu\u00ed , et al. 
  wtf ? 
  for real or you are just joking ? 
  dude i 'm catalan and i have never seen anyone doing that xd all languages you named are the same one . 
  probably you are talking about the small sector of valencians who think their language is different from catalan , but that 's not the common thing . 
  i must admit i kinda like it ... but my mind ca n't understand the feeling of gaud\u00ed and his works being taken lightly with that music xd like i do n't know if the song is serious or a serious trolling !, 
  it 's interesting tho the fact when this song was released ( 1987 ) , sagrada fam\u00edlia was `` nothing '' ( look at the '' [ interior ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tlvh9vo.jpg ) '' ) . 
  almost all the images shown in the youtube video were non existent until 5 years ago or 10 at most . 
  so i do n't know how the guy that wrote that song could get all the `` needed inspiration '' for it . 
  that shocked me a bit !, 
  the church was n't even that famous at that age , i was n't born at that time but i read they had to ask people for money , so the construction could continue !, 
  it 's crazy to think about that , when today they receive millions of visitors every year with the consequent income . 
  wtf is this ... 
  this document is part of the 40 minutes documentary about the sagrada fam\u00edlia that aired yesterday on catalonia 's public tv channel . 
  before this documentary , it was thought there were n't video images of the catalan genius architect . 
  only very few low quality pictures of him exist today . 
  now we can finally see the architect walking and moving  you can watch the full documentary here in catalan language : * [ sagrada fam\u00edlia : compte enrere ] ( https://youtu.be/ecwmxgjr194 ) * ( `` sagrada fam\u00edlia : the countdown has begun '' ) . 
  wow i did n't know it could be that * bad * !, 
  like i did n't even know there existed medication for it . 
  thanks , i 'm so ignorant of this stuff !, 
  i do n't understand ... you mean i pictured the spanish police as being too good ? 
  i think i explained how they did tortures and abuses . 
  i do n't know all the details of course , i 'm not even basque . 
  of course there 's a lot more to explain in such a complex conflict . 
   considering how much proindependence you are . 
  i do n't know what this has to do with eta ? 
  and i 'm not `` much pro-independence '' . 
  i 'm just `` pro-independence '' , like the majority of the catalan population . 
  wtf is a pollen forecast ? 
  o.o sorry first time i see this ... how they `` predict '' this ? 
  and i do n't understand how this can help people allergic to pollen ? 
  they ca n't go outside in all these areas ? 
  i mean this map is too big also . 
   just come back for medical checks . 
  xdd too easy !, 
  that 's not how time travel works , you have to commit with all the consequences !, 
  yep it can be for sure !, 
  it 's subjective of course ... 
  i somewhat like the eiffel tower , but i do n't personally see it as something `` beautiful '' ( according to my `` personal '' standards of beautiful that can differ in many people ) .
