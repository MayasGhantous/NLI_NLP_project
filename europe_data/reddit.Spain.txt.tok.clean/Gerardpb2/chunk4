  i see it as a what it is : something that has become `` a worldwide known symbol '' of the city of paris . 
  but looking at it individually , i find it similar to what we see in [ sapporo ] ( http://www.japantowers.jp/english/web/03_towermap/tower_image/image_01b.jpg ) for instance , which i do n't find particularly beautiful too . 
  the eiffel tower was built with the idea of being temporary and later demolished . 
  and i think this can be `` seen '' in the building design : colors , materials , etc. 
  but maybe this is what makes it stand among other buildings and become a world known admired building ? 
  who knows !, 
  weird , ugly and cool at the same time ... 
  i mean the eiffel tower itself is not something we can call `` beautiful '' anyway , so having this thing around is not that out of place . 
  we are just so used tot he typical image of the eiffel tower , therefore this image shocks us a lot . 
  if this had been done , we would admire it today . 
  loving the idea of going up there with the car/touristic bus , `` climbing '' a building with the car ... where else in the world can you do it ? 
  but yeah probably it 's better it did n't happen !, 
  the extinct volcano , part of the [ garrotxa volcanic zone natural park ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/garrotxa_volcanic_zone_natural_park ) , has a perimeter of 2 kilometers and a height of 682 meters . 
  the last eruption occurred about 11,000 years ago . 
  however , the region is still seismically active , and a large earthquake in 1428 ( [ 1428 catalonia earthquake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1428_catalonia_earthquake ) ) caused damage to buildings and twenty deaths in barcelona ( 90 kilometres to the south ) . 
  in the crater of the volcano we can find the romanesque [ hermitage of santa margarida ] ( http://i.imgur.com/isfi9sf.jpg ) , which was destroyed in 1428 during the earthquake and rebuilt in 1865 . 
  let 's go boys !, 
  i 'm so glad in catalonia this barbaric animal torture stuff is [ prohibited ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ban_on_bullfighting_in_catalonia ) !, 
  seriously i could n't be happier the day it was approved , so proud of my nation ... 
  except * the ban was officially annulled for being unconstitutional by spain 's constitutional court on 5 october 2016 * , but yeah whatever , since we do n't give a shit about that court , i 'm sure it wo n't be a problem . 
  we also have [ this ] ( http://racoindependentista.cat/wp-content/gallery/adhesius/matricula2.png ) one in catalonia !, 
  as seen [ here ] ( http://www.aravalles.cat/imatges/noticies/cat-cotxe.jpg ) . 
  calling the city as `` bar\u00e7a '' is indeed a horrible thing t.t i do n't know how many times i have tried to explain them ...  yeah i 'm sure it 's physically impossible for you to say the castilian pronunciation lol it is , i do n't usually speak castilian and you have to understand the castilian we speak and learn here is not the same one you may have learned . 
  in spanish we say `` madrit '' in the same way we usually use `` poner '' ( `` sal '' or whatever ) instead of `` echar '' , because of the catalan language influence . 
  or using articles when talking about people ( `` el carlos , la mar\u00eda , el mariano rajoy '' ) etc. 
  as does madrizzzzzzzz xd anyway i say `` madrit '' because i ca n't just say it in another way . 
  that 's how everybody where i live says it . 
  to me it sounds like a `` d '' , but i understand for people from outside it can sound like a `` t '' . 
  on the other hand , in english you say barcelona . 
  you do n't need to force yourself to say `` barthelona '' in a mix of english/spanish accent , which in my opinion sounds pretty bad xd you are comparing it with something not related ... 
  it was a critical point during recent history of spain . 
  spanish police working in the basque country lived in `` hell '' , and we are talking about just 10 years ago for some places . 
  the `` basque country '' destination was worst than afghanistan or whatever similar country . 
  their kids had to go to school with special buses and police protection , and they had to see almost every day people screaming or banners saying '' * we are going to kill your parents * '' . 
  spanish police explain how they had to live with their families in the headquarters , and the fact of just going 2 streets away from there was considered suicidal . 
  they had instructions for everything ... when going to bars they could n't sit showing the back of the neck to the door , and always sitting the farthest possible of the door/windows . 
  they explain how 2 policeman used to go the same bar day after day ( close to the headquarter ) , sitting in the same place , and just a few weeks later they were riddled from the door with submachine guns . 
  many spanish police members became drug addicts , since it was the only way to continue with all the suffering ( constantly seeing their friends die or thinking that just going to work could mean never seeing again your family ) . 
  but then there were excesses on the spanish police and government side too . 
  for instance when spain used state terrorism against eta ( death squads know as gal [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gal_ ( paramilitary_group ) ] . 
  or the systematic use of torture against suspected terrorists ( some of them ended up dying in tortures , and later discovered innocent ) . 
  the fact spain 's death squads committed so many [ mistakes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/killing_of_lasa_and_zabala ) ( killing innocent people or just messing up during the process ) , made possible to it being discovered and published all over the country on the press . 
  it was never known if the president of spain was behind it ( we will never know , but there 's a high probability he was ) . 
  many police officers and government officers would be later convicted , in a crucial moment for spain : the rule of law in the fragile ( and young ) democracy of spain had been called into question . 
  anyway as you see it 's a very complex thing ... people living in places like gipuzkoa saw it as a war , at that time . 
  eta were their soldiers against the torturers and invaders of the spanish state . 
  there was massive support of the population to eta . 
  if you happened to criticize eta living there ? 
  you could consider yourself death , if you did n't escape . 
  thank god the situation has changed dramatically . 
  i do n't know , i 'm not from hungary , 
  it just sounds horrible xd, 
  it 's a mess ... 
  i do n't know the details on this case ( i also do n't trust that much antena 3 & co. ) , but usually when workers have acquired some `` privileges '' , taking them away is incredibly difficult . 
  giving privileges ? 
  no problem , fast and easy !, 
  but wait , you realize you went too far/you are losing money/there 's a crisis and you want to go back ? 
  oh no ... prepare for the war . 
  i hate labor law ... it 's not for me . 
  i realized that when in class we had to defend x worker ( for being fired or whatever complain against their businessman ) and i was actually on the businessman side ; like thinking i would have done the same . 
  if the law is on the stevedores side it can be tough battle . 
  and even if it 's not , they have lots of rights ( like strike and stuff ) . 
  maybe we could ask ourselves why they received these privileges in the first place ? 
  as you see on the * estatuto de los trabajadores * , until now , they were considered `` special workers '' ( out from the general laws applied to the majority of workers in spain ) . 
  who in spain had this wonderful idea ? 
  ok ok you sounded a bit brutal xd specially when the right in this country is so `` good '' at economy that they are the masters at [ corruption ] ( http://www.elplural.com/politica/2017/04/24/el-legado-de-aznar-12-de-sus-14-ministros-ya-estan-imputados-o-cobraron ) . 
  anyway i somewhat agree with you about the stevedores issue , but i just do n't like talking about things i do n't have full knowledge . 
  in case you are interested , it 's cool watching the `` war '' from the legal point of view , on the * [ estatuto de los trabajadores ] ( https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=boe-a-2015-11430&amp;b=10&amp;tn=1&amp;p=20170513#a2 ) * . 
  you can click the different modifications ( in red , below the article ) to see how it changed thought this 2017 ( letter h ) stevedores ) . 
  back and forth ... spain quality . 
   basic economy knowledge is prohibited in the left . 
  lol, 
  according to wikipedia ...  an economic study in 2008 has found that the adoption of the euro would increase foreign investment in hungary by 30 % . 
  do you have date already ? 
  your government is working on that ? 
  i know 2020 was a target for many eu countries to adopt the euro , but after the economic crisis everything has changed : /, 
  looks amazing !, 
  i feel bad for not having visited budapest yet t.t ps : adopt the euro !, 
  omg you guys ... 
  i 'm so blind !, 
  i remember you asked me about palau de la m\u00fasica ? 
  i guess no time for that xd do n't worry , camp nou is also an epic art hall . 
  i wonder if that guy ( permafrost ) does even know what * comarques * are xd, 
  hahaha i did n't even notice that !, 
  omg good catch xd to be honest nowadays it 's difficult to get a picture of any street without an estelada !, 
  just this morning i was thinking this when walking barcelona . 
  if you happen to visit the city , pay attention to balconies !, 
  anyway the fact '' * permafrost * '' uploaded this just because i posted , without even trying to hide it and literally copying the exact same format i used xdd i also wonder how many times we need to see `` spain '' in that picture !, 
  keep dreaming ... 
  mmmm i have the feeling someone copied [ me ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6ht6m4/calella_de_palafrugell_baix_empord%c3%a0_costa_brava/ ) . 
  but there 's a little difference, 
  it 's literally a paradise ... some of my best summertime memories are from calella . 
  i 'm sure we wo n't be that stupid to let this happen !, 
   never like `` th '' . 
  i think what he 's trying to say is those english speakers that , because they think it sounds * cooler * or think they are more * integrated * , say `` barthelona '' instead of the original pronunciation in english . 
  i have encountered some of them , and i just do n't know how to react ... they look at you like `` i pronounced it right , are n't i ? 
  and i am like `` please do n't do that again t.t '' . 
  the english pronunciation of barcelona is actually pretty close to the one we use in catalan here . 
  every time a * guiri * says `` barthelona '' i want to shoot myself . 
  calella de palafrugell is a a small holiday resort and fishing village part of the [ costa brava ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pn9wwxg.png ) coastal region .
