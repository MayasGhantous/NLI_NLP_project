  it has an excellent setting and , whilst busy in the summer season , it does not have the large hotels and mass tourism of other costa brava resorts such as lloret de mar. 
  it is considered one of the few places in costa brava that sill conserves the charm of the villages prior to the arrival of mass tourism : narrow streets , curved tiles white houses , traditional two-story fisherman homes , etc. 
  it 's also known for its annual world famous '' ** cantada d'havaneres de calella de palafrugell ** '' ( * habaneras signing * ) on the beach ( as seen [ here ] ( http://www.havanerescalella.cat/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/cropped-a.torres-2.jpg ) ) , that takes place every july . 
  on this [ video ] ( https://youtu.be/d6ck-yprj_i?t=1m30s ) you can can watch a piece of last 2016 edition . 
  there 's a [ website ] ( http://www.havanerescalella.cat/en/ ) in english with more information . 
  even more curious that in catalan it 's actually `` saragossa '' and `` andalusia '' . 
  sounds completely right for me xd, 
  i know where 's he from ... 
  but i was jus joking anyway . 
  i love him !, 
  yeah , obviously !, 
  but my friends usually do siesta and they do n't work `` in the field or the construction '', 
  like you do with catalans ' money ? 
  i 've never done a `` siesta '' in my life . 
  5 \u00b0 c is already cold as fuck for me ... 
  i went there as a kid and sang the song on the bridge . 
  true story . 
   they could be preserved in other places instead of boxes . 
  not really i believe ... idyllic african natural reserves as seen in the movies are extremely expensive and rare . 
  if you want to preserve species , you need zoos to get the needed revenue . 
  as years go by , more and more species are getting extinct in the wild ( rhinos are already extinct or a couple years from being ? 
  ) , like [ african elephants ] ( http://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/2024.htm#elephants ) or [ gorillas ] ( http://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/2023.htm#gorillas-extinct ) . 
  from now on the only place in the world with rhinos will be safaris , zoos and natural reserves . 
  therefore we need zoos to preserve the hundreds and hundreds of endangered species , specially considering most of them will disappear in the wild in the near future and there 's just not enough money and space for other options . 
  but anyway , i know i 'm not an expert on this at all . 
  it 's just that i do n't like this general '' * moral * '' bias against zoos ( not talking about you ) without stopping to think rationally about species preservation . 
  i also personally like zoos , i do n't see anything wrong with them at all ( of course there are exceptions , ehem china zoos i 'm looking at [ you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqic5u3-0u ) ) . 
  ps : they are planning the move the barcelona zoo away from the current location ( somewhat in the city centre ) , to have more space for the animals . 
  this has been discussed for many years , but for now nothing official yet . 
   catalonia and its people agreed to the constitution , this is the most pathetic argument i have ever seen . 
  seriously . 
  people that voted that constitution came from a fucking dictatorship dude . 
  anything would be better than a dictatorship . 
  it was either `` that '' constitution or nothing . 
  catalans were one of the people that suffered the most the dictatorship and the persecution against their language and culture . 
  they would have voted anything `` slightly better '' than from what they had lived . 
  nobody would have voted this constitution today ... 
  anyway think whatever you want . 
  31 \u00b0 c right now in barcelona !, 
  we do n't even reach that temperatures at night , being lowest at 26 \u00b0 c in barcelona this last night . 
  i think you live in a fake reality ... `` not a single poll gives 51 % for independence '' xddd you are so ignorant dude . 
   it defines that spain is one nation indivisible . 
  it does n't affect international law dispositions . 
  it 's a little more complex . 
   we could draft a new one ofc . 
  we will be out by then . 
  but yes i hope you reform your constitution someday . 
  wtf o_o, 
  there 's no problem with the constitution related with the referendum . 
  it is perfectly legal . 
  the problem is the spanish government that does n't want to allow it ( fear to democracy ? ) . 
  if another spanish political party had won the elections we would already had the independence referendum . 
  what reality ? 
  that 10 \u00b0 c difference between madrid and barcelona !, 
  exactly !, 
  this was crazy and i did n't expect that t.t. . . in the malls i was freezing , but outside i was burning up . 
  so i remember i stood in the middle of the entrance for some time , in the middle of the heat and the cold , trying to find the equilibrium . 
  same with the airport ( hamad ) . 
  they are crazy with the air conditioner . 
  it 's just not normal . 
  i was freezing and complained tot he staff ( they told me that 's a `` common problem of the airport '' ) . 
  and i had to wait for lots of hours for my flight , while freezing ... right after having spent the whole day experiencing the worst heat of my life . 
  anyone reading , bring a jacket and some `` cold '' clothes when going to one of the hottest countries in the world ( qatar ) because they ca n't go normal with the ac . 
  the irony !, 
   so do you support scottish independence too ? 
  of course !, 
  why i should n't support it ? 
   during your 2014 independence referendum there was an important coverage here in catalonia , and in our public tv channel . 
  you and the quebecois are an example for the catalans , since you already had an independence referendum and we have n't had the opportunity yet ( spain does n't allow it ) . 
  i believe in the right of self-determination for all current nations without a state . 
  if there 's a majority of people there wanting to leave and create a new country , they should n't be silenced . 
  democracy should always win in the 21st century !, 
  good guy diverting to visit barcelona , knowing in the near future it will become the capital of the next eu country catalonia . 
  now my question : in which city did you spent the most time and in which one the less , and why ? 
  because it 's june . 
  wait do you shave your cats for the heat ? 
  o.o i have 2 cats but they do n't seem to complain with the heat , and one of them is pretty hairy . 
  are your cats specially hairy ? 
  yep sure it is !, 
  people from outside coming to barcelona might not be used to this humidity . 
  mmmm well i was talking about intense heat . 
  the problem of china is pollution . 
  you just do n't see the sky and the nearby buildings ... having the feeling you do n't have oxygen . 
  at the middle of tiananmen square at midday horrible experience xd i remember being [ here ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@39.990509,116.3864594,3a,75y,175.84h,102.84t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-kbfjk40cy8u%2fvnuctnbelhi%2faaaaaaaaac8%2f6vsjqwrox-meqd7dxspe_iaqfwq28y83wclib!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh3.googleusercontent.com%2f-kbfjk40cy8u%2fvnuctnbelhi%2faaaaaaaaac8%2f6vsjqwrox-meqd7dxspe_iaqfwq28y83wclib%2fw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya68.99219-ro-0-fo100%2f!7i10240!8i5120 ) one day and having the feeling i was in another planet ( literally ) . 
  there just was n't `` air '' . 
  no wind at all neither . 
  weird experience . 
  it was `` impossible '' this was earth as we know it . 
  i also timed ( in shanghai ) that in about 17 seconds outside you start sweating xd ps : i love china !, 
  hahaha cubans everywhere in miami !, 
  i miss miami :( for me worst weather experience in doha and beijing ( both in august ) . 
  no words . 
   that 's from your biased opinion . 
  sure ... 
  i am catalan and i know what i have lived . 
  [ anti-catalanism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-catalanism ) is a thing in spain . 
  and just watching television ( or telemadrid stuff ) one can see some hate towards catalans . 
  i 've never been to madrid , but i know people that have been attacked and insulted for just speaking in catalan on streets or subway . 
  i 'm sure its a minority , but it 's sad it exists and the fact they focus the hate against catalan people . 
  `` catalufo '' , `` polaco '' , etc. . .  otherwise they would n't want catalonia to stay with us , would n't they ?
