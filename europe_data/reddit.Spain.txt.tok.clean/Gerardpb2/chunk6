  that 's why i hear things like : `` you 'll never be independent fucking catalan '' and similar stuff ... 
  wanting us to stay in spain is not abut `` loving us '' when there 's anti-catalanism behind ... on [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m14ebpj-atm ) video i believe it was pretty much explained . 
  anyway i was n't talking about you ... ( even tho it 's true i do n't like many of your comments about catalonia , where in my opinion there 's some hate ) . 
  i was talking in general . 
  i do n't know you that much ... ps : '' * my favourite spanish accent is the catalan one . 
  * '' for real ? 
  you must be the first spaniard i listen saying that . 
  my spanish accent has improved a lot tho xddddd, 
  apparently there are a considerable amount of bigots in spain then, 
  miami in september-october is paradise !, 
  i also went in august and i do n't think it 's * that * bad ... 
  i was waiting for this !, 
  thank god !, 
  we could n't lose the ~ ~ only spaniard supporting our independence referendum ~ ~ coolest spanish redditor . 
  1 day stopover when traveling to hong kong . 
  it was a `` fun experience '' at least xd there was nobody on the streets and even the most important museum was closed xd everybody uses car , but we managed to walk under the sun a bit during the morning ( 6:00 am to 10:00 am you can somewhat survive on the outside , but breathing at the beginning is going to be a little difficult ) . 
  when heat hours come you need taxis to move , spend time in malls or wandering thought souq waqif in the shadows . 
  before exiting a building we had to plan our `` next stop '' inside a nearby building . 
  resting for a while and preparing the next encounter with the exterior . 
  you ca n't think properly on the outside and every second can be a torture , so you must rationalize every second you spent outside . 
  in a matter of seconds you are already sweating !, 
  next time i come to qatar or nearby country better not in summer tho, 
   you used the official flag of catalonia , that does n't offend anyone here suuuuuure, 
  mostoriginaldeath :(, 
  i went to qatar in august   ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ps : do n't do it , just breathing can be difficult . 
  8/10 visited !, 
  missing brussels and edinburgh : /, 
   london is cold in august ? 
  it was for me :( specially at night ... london in august is similar to what we have here in october/november ? 
  but probably the worst thing was the sun . 
  i do n't know what 's wrong with that island , some evil curse took away the sun !, 
  i have friends that went to study english in ireland too ... and well they did n't say pretty good things ( specially related with the lack of sun and how it can affect your mood ) . 
  the first thing they did when coming back was going directly to the beach . 
  it 's just we are so used to this . 
  right know while i write there 's not a single cloud in sky , full sunny day . 
  and that 's what 's `` normal '' for us , we do n't expect anything different ( raining is the weird thing ) . 
  so when we travel north europe and `` confront/face '' the differences ... it 's not easy for us ; we are not used t.t ps : probably that 's why you can survive with a fan instead of air conditioner ( using it right now ) :p, 
  what is raining ? 
   fair skin and freckles that 's the exact description of the french tourists i usually see here in catalonia hehe, 
  0 \u00b0 c anything below that is crazy . 
  but it rarely happens here in barcelona . 
  ps : i would like to know your answer too ... 
  yeah i can imagine that , i was just joking xd sometimes here we have a misconception about the `` radical religious '' spain . 
  i understand new generations are no longer like this , specially in big cities . 
  but then i see [ images ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hgyitkemoq ) like this one in 2017 , and i feel ashamed of being part of spain again xd, 
   i 'm an atheist too oh i see ... that 's why you escaped to madrid . 
  before talaverianos burned you alive for that . 
  ps : i do n't know why `` last supper '' made me laugh xdd, 
   and apparently madrid hates calalunya `` spain hates catalunya '' also works !, 
  but catalans do n't hate catalunya ... they did n't think about it !, 
  and what do you `` celebrate '' ? 
  i do n't understand ... 
  i 'm too much atheist : s, 
  as a kid i did n't know this was n't a thing in spain ... spaniards looked at me weird  _ < anyway my spanish as a kid was just catalan changing pronunciation xd, 
  still prefer this weather than the one you have on north of europe :p my mind ca n't understand not seeing the sun and being cold in august !, 
  i hated london just for this xd and better not to talk about the beach ... 
   if only the economy would be better i 'd definitely move there . 
  is the economy bad in barcelona ? 
   but it is n't the only art nouveau in spain . 
  that 's exactly what i said !, 
  and you are giving me the reason here . 
  notice `` catalan modernism '' is not the same as `` modernismo in catalonia '' . 
  maybe it 's a bit complex to understand ... anyway do n't worry . 
  i think you are confusing here ( or maybe i 'm wrong , but wikipedia is on my side ) . 
  `` modernismo '' is just the spanish term for '' * art nouveau * '' . 
  in the same way modernisme is the catalan term for '' * art nouveau * '' . 
  now '' [ catalan art nouveau ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modernisme ) '' ( also called `` catalan modernism '' ) is a unique form of '' * art nouveau * '' that was developed and gained big importance in catalonia . 
  it is distinct from the others but shares some similarities with the other forms of '' * art nouveau * '' that can be found in europe . 
  on the other hand there 's no `` spanish art nouveau '' . 
  even though it is true that in spain we can find some art nouveau ( melilla for instance ) . 
  but it did n't form a unique style like the catalan one and did n't get that much of repercussion and importance ( like the catalan one ) . 
  hahahahahah i think you should stop it here before you end up in some weird island . 
  ps : in case you want to continue your risky investigation , the picture ( sagrada fam\u00edlia ) was taken by [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baldomer_gili_i_roig ) guy . 
  i like my nation being a country but maybe we went a little too far, 
  1992 for the olympic games in barcelona ... was n't born then , but i know how important they were . 
  magical . 
  the city was completely transformed , and after them nothing would ever be the same for barcelona . 
  the games itself are known to be one of the best in history too . 
  2017 if we get independence xd ( i know it 's not 20th century :p ), 
  emhmm no ... the `` spanish art nouveau '' does n't exist as an architectural style . 
  you are inventing a concept to call something that already has a proper name . 
  i do n't know where do you want to go with this . 
  you are making a mistake if you call sagrada fam\u00edlia , casa batll\u00f3 and similar catalan modernisme works as `` spanish art nouveau '' . 
  mmmmm you like it more [ now ] ( http://www.godsmurf.com/photos/2007-12-barcelona/barcelona-sagrada-familia-002.jpg ) ? 
  it 's ** catalan ** * art nouveau * ( not spanish ) , called [ modernisme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modernisme ) . 
  as far as i know you do n't have to queue if you buy tickets online :p, 
  what a time to be alive ... self-driving cars , reusable rockets and sagrada fam\u00edlia . 
  well you can enter for 15 $ :p, 
  gaud\u00ed himself said `` people from all over the world will come to visit this church '' . 
  that 's what 's happening , and it 's great , 
  you call the `` passion facade '' the `` new one '' ? 
  xd i love both nativity and passion facades . 
  it would be impossible for me to chose a favorite one ... and i guess same thing will happen to me when the last - and principal - facade ( glory facade ) is built !, 
  we 've changed a lot ;(, 
  [ indeed ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/sagrada_familia_nave_roof_detail.jpg ) , 
  i love old pictures of sagrada fam\u00edlia !, 
  look for the differences on [ this ] ( http://www.elfarodealejandria.es/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/picmonkey-collage_thumb.jpg ) one !, 
  also [ this ] ( https://sites.google.com/site/obrasdestacadas/_/rsrc/1472878366213/la-sagrada-familia-de-gaudi/1926d.jpg ) is what gaud\u00ed saw when he died in 1926 . 
  only the nativity fa\u00e7ade completed . 
  he did it on purpose ; he knew future generations would finish the construction long after he would be dead .
