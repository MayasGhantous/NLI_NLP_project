  decades before dying , when he was designing the church , he knew he would never see it finished ; that 's why during his life he left lots of detailed miniatures , drawings ( [ example ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/pasi%c3%b3n_%28gaud%c3%ad%2c_1911%29.jpg ) ) and explanations of the sagrada fam\u00edlia . 
  so , instead of constructing like one would expect ( gradually , the central nave , etc. 
  ) , he focused all efforts in one single fa\u00e7ade to show the world how it should be done and what it would look like . 
  this technique allowed him to have more time to focus on the design of the most complex parts of the church ( like the central nave or jesus tower ) ; in fact many of the final designs we see today in the sagrada fam\u00edlia were added in the later period of gaud\u00ed 's life ( the project evolved as gadu\u00ed was getting older and more experienced ) . 
  during the last years of his life , sagrada fam\u00edlia became almost an insane `` obsession '' for him , working 24/7 on the project , while putting social relations aside and even his own health ( not to mention the fact he died after being hit by a tram ; as people say , he was known to cross the streets without paying attention to the surroundings , only thinking about the church and his projects ) . 
  constructing one entire fa\u00e7ade first , was also some sort of a `` marketing '' technique . 
  if one fa\u00e7ade is totally completed , future generations will feel `` forced '' to do the same with the rest . 
  smart gaud\u00ed  ps : there 's a [ website ] ( http://www.sagradafamiliagaudi.com/fotocronologia.html ) that compiles sagrada fam\u00edlia pictures from all periods of time . 
  worth checking !, 
  2026 * 100 years after gaud\u00ed 's death  i do n't know if coincidence , but i just posted about sagrada fam\u00edlia too : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6h6zpp/sagrada_fam%c3%adlia_barcelona_catalonia/, 
  it costs us 0 $  that was gaud\u00ed 's desire ( `` no public money should be * wasted * in his creation ; since schools and hospitals are way more important '' ) , that 's why since the start it has been paid entirely by donations ( entrance tickets basically , in our present time ) . 
  the current annual budget is close to 30 million euros . 
   how slow can you ? 
  there are many reasons about by so `` slow '' . 
  there was a war in the middle ( spanish civil war ) and many of gaud\u00ed 's drawings and miniatures were destroyed . 
  there also were n't enough donations for the most time ( current architects for instance explain that as kids they used to go around the streets of barcelona asking people for donations to the church !!, 
  ) , and without them the construction could n't move on . 
  it was n't until the `` tourism boom '' of barcelona when money started coming to the church , and the construction started moving faster . 
  think about that we 've been having 8 towers in the sagrada fam\u00edlia for the last decades ; and they are planning to do in less than a decade 10 towers more ( one of them the tallest building in barcelona ) , for a total of 18 towers . 
  another reason is the fact the project is extremely complex ( you can get an idea by looking at [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8ofie23.jpg ) old picture and imaging on top of that the enormous future central and tallest stone tower ; just thinking the weight ... ) . 
  when the genius gaud\u00ed died , there was no one able to do it . 
  only today with the most advanced computers and aeronautical software available it is possible to finish the church . 
  that 's why it 's said gaud\u00ed as an architect was 100 years ahead of his time . 
  the `` bas\u00edlica i temple expiatori de la sagrada fam\u00edlia '' ( * basilica and expiatory church of the holy family * ) is a large roman catholic church in barcelona , designed by catalan genius architect antoni gaud\u00ed ( 1852 -- 1926 ) in the [ modernisme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modernisme ) ( or catalan modernism ) architectural style . 
  construction started in 1882 and it is expected to be completed in 2026 for the architectural aspects ( artistic and symbolic aspects will remain under construction ; same with the surroundings of the church ) . 
  when completed it will become the tallest church on earth ( 172,5 metres ) . 
  i highly recommend watching this short [ documentary ] ( https://youtu.be/znnwpmdwm1w ) , where many of the questions you may have are explained . 
  ------------ this picture i 'm sharing on reddit is one of the best pictures i have ever seen of the ** [ passion fa\u00e7ade ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sagrada_fam%c3%adlia#passion_fa.c3.a7ade ) ** ( 2017 ) . 
  this picture it great for comparing it with the ** [ finished building ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xrbbysa.jpg ) ** ( 2026 ) ; notice all the differences !, 
  or you can just watch [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zv5gslb.jpg ) image highlighting what 's still missing waiting to be built on that fa\u00e7ade . 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tscofuv.jpg ) you can read the explanations of what 's missing in catalan ( both pictures done by miquel barcel\u00f3 , from the facebook 's group dedicated to follow sagrada fam\u00edlia 's construction ) . 
  on this video ( [ raising the central towers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1ojr2wipai ) ) you can learn more about the process towards 2026 . 
  -------- this next sunday on tv3 ( public tv channel of catalonia ) there 's a new documentary about the finalization of the church ( '' * sagrada fam\u00edlia : the countdown has begun * '' ) . 
  here you have a ** [ promo ] ( http://mp4-high-dwn.media.tv3.cat/1/9/1497362964891.mp4 ) ** . 
  it seems we will learn some new things !, 
  they say they will also show for the first time ever video images of gaud\u00ed himself ( we have only seen [ pictures ] ( https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20170610/be7971a45f20dafd5d1124189471eb4d.jpg ) of him ) !, 
  ------ final curiosity : sagrada fam\u00edlia is the most reviewed place of the world in tripadvisor . 
  being also the first one to surpass 100,000 traveler reviews ( april 2017 ) .

  oh really ?? 
  i thought it was an original tale from your country !, 
  to be honest as a kid i though it really happened xd, 
  same !, 
  you netherlands guys are just used to live there ... as a kid when i visited holland , this stuff scared me xd that [ tale ] ( https://i2.wp.com/cambiopolitico.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/holanda01.jpg?resize=486%2c208 ) about the kid that saved holland with his finger ( pretty popular tale here in catalonia ) ... well it did n't help me neither xd, 
  might be , i know him too xd he 's an urbanism expert and cerd\u00e0 lover :p, 
  it 's crazy when you watch [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/occitan_language#/media/file:occitania_blanck_map.png ) map of the occitan language spoken area . 
  despite that , the only place it is recognized as an official language is in catalonia ( where it 's far less spoken ) . 
  not in france , not in italy ... 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_language ) ...  with approximately 215 to 220 million native speakers and 260 million total speakers , portuguese is usually listed as the sixth most natively spoken language in the world . 
  also native speakers \u2260 speakers, 
  castilian ate it . 
  wise mother . 
  tell her to run for president , please . 
  it 's urgent . 
   they brought blond hair we are a rarity anyway xd specially in the south of spain . 
  in catalonia it is an official language too ( [ aranese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aranese_dialect ) ) !, 
  since it 's spoken in the val d'aran ( aran valley ) , catalonia . 
  that 's why , for instance , the official website of catalonia ( [ gencat.cat ] ( http://web.gencat.cat/ca/inici/ ) ) is in catalan , spanish , english and occitan . 
  i do n't know about the status of the language in france tho ... 
  let 's see if you can help me , because when looking for information i found your language status a bit complicated :p * asturian ( * asturianu * ) is the same language as leonese ( * llion\u00e9s * ) ? 
  are they called different for the same reason catalan and valencian are , despite being the same language ? 
  * and what 's the '' [ asturleon\u00e9s ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/idioma_asturleon%c3%a9s ) '' language ? 
  is it a language that includes the asturian ? 
  and why/what 's the difference with * mirand\u00e9s * and * extreme\u00f1u * ? 
  they are all named in that `` asturleon\u00e9s '' group that , the spanish wikipedia , calls a `` language '' . 
  it 's so confusing !, 
  yep !, 
  i would love to speak basque , such a cool language :( sadly the few words i can say are not the ones `` politically correct '' to use ... same thing happens with german . 
  except for basque , which is of unknown [ origin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/origin_of_the_basques ) , most modern iberian languages descend from vulgar latin . 
  throughout history ( and pre-history ) , many different languages have been spoken in the iberian peninsula , contributing to the formation and differentiation of the contemporaneous languages of iberia ; however , most of them have become extinct or fallen into disuse . 
  basque is the only non-indo-european surviving language in iberia and western europe . 
  in modern times , ** spanish ** ( cf. 
  30 to 40 million speakers ) , ** portuguese ** ( cf. 
  around 10 million speakers ) , ** catalan ** ( cf. 
  around 10 million speakers ) , ** galician ** ( cf. 
  around 3 million speakers ) and ** basque ** ( cf. 
  around 1 million speakers ) are the most widely spoken languages in the iberian peninsula .

  go tell directly to aleix ( the guy who wrote the article ) that * his article is part of the corrupt jordi pujol family in a mafia called `` catalonia '' * . 
  good luck in your life !, 
  this user ( rainymeadow ) is the saddest thing you can find on reddit ... you 'll see him in every post about catalonia criticizing , manipulating and insulting . 
  hate is in his heart . 
  one day he 's gon na be sued for some of the things he says ( `` comparing aleix 's article and catalonia with a mafia ... '' ) . 
  anyway , he 'll see where he gets in . 
   founded ! = funded yep i know , maybe he edited it ? 
  who knows ... 
  anyway it 's just ridiculous because this article is not even in naciodigital . 
  this guy ( aleix ) writes articles in many different media ( international and national ) . 
  seriously is better to not waste time with rainymeadow, 
  no , as i told you i do n't want to waste time with you .
