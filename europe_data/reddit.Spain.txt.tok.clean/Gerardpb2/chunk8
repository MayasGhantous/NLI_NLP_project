  you are just ridiculous ... 
  probably the best thing of being independent is not having to share the country with people like you . 
  i feel sad for all the spaniards that will have to agree with people like you in order to reform spain when we will be gone ... good luck to them !, 
  you are a troll , i do n't want to waste time with you ( ignore trolls , no1 rule ! ) . 
  almost everything you said is false . 
  people already know you here , you are just pathetic ...  receives subsidies from the generalitat of catalonia like maaaaany publications written in catalan , to promote the use of the catalan language ; something clearly spain has never taken care of btw . 
  they receive subsidies ( a small fraction , far from covering all the costs ) . 
  and again , if you do n't like our government promoting the catalan language ( through subsidies ) in media , movies , books ... it 's fine for me . 
  that 's why i want to be independent , i do n't want to discuss with spaniards like you about what us the catalans want for our society . 
  i wonder where will you go to cry when we leave ... 
  you are soooo mad xddd half of what you said is just completely false ... the guy only works at european parliament and writes books . 
  he does n't work for any media ( neither washington post nor naci\u00f3digital ) lol and anyway '' [ naci\u00f3digital ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/naci%c3%b3_digital ) '' was n't founded by the catalan government . 
  it just receives subsidies to promote the catalan language . 
  and better not to continue here , because it all goes crazy ... you must be the saddest human being in reddit / r/rainymeadow ...  any similarity with the mafia is just pure coincidence edit : i wonder if you realize that for some of the things you said you could be sued ... defamation , insults , etc. 
  media like '' * el mundo * '' for instance has been sued for doing similar manipulation as the one you do here . 
  what do you mean with that ? 
  `` aleix '' is a popular name in catalonia ... 
  i personally know many aleix , even in my family . 
  it reminds me of ephesus ( present turkey ) !, 
  love it, 
  i slept in a monastery/convent almost inside the vatican , and i could hear at night they do weird and scary things . 
  like singing at 4:00 am terrifying religious songs and stuff like this ... 
  problem solved !, 
  go for it \u2714, 
  everything you said sounds perfect !, 
  except this : '' * turn strasbourg into an european university * '' what 's an `` european university '' ? 
  well first time i heard it !, 
  thanks for sharing it :d, 
   born too late to explore the world and too early to explore the galaxy . 
  omg, 
  beautiful !, 
  and scary ... 
  i imagine being a roman at that time , how mystical and important that place would be !, 
  watching the sun go down from there ... 
   the fact that an user that does n't like what i posted is celebrating its removal should make you think . 
  are you talking about me ? 
  when did i `` celebrate '' that ? 
  o.o this `` article '' of el mundo is not serious at all ... el mundo is known for his editorialization , and this article is another example of that . 
  i 'm sure you are smart enough to notice it for yourself rainymeadow ... maybe / u/greekball does n't know what 's `` el mundo '' , but i 'm sure that you , being spaniard rainymeadow , are conscious about the polemics related with el mundo ( manipulation , editorialization , etc. ) . 
  just look at one of the points pointed int he article : '' * judicial prosecution for putting ballot boxes * '' '' * artur mas and former convicted consellers were punished for breaching constitutional court rulings , not for putting ballot boxes . 
  * '' and what did those `` constitutional court rulings '' say ? 
  that artur mas ( former president of catalonia ) could n't approve a vote on independence of catalonia ( despite being non-binding ) . 
  he breached the constitutional court rulings by putting ballot boxes , and therefore convicted ( just read [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_self-determination_referendum,_2014#legal_consequences ) ) . 
  it 's obvious when you breach a constitutional court ruling , is because you did something ( on this case , putting ballot boxes ) ... just look at the rhetoric manipulation of el mundo . 
  and the other points are all just the same ... 
  this article is not about `` actual facts '' at all ... it 's even clearer when some of this facts are explained in 2 lines . 
  how can you even explain and demonstrate facts in such a complex matter , like this one , in a short article like this ? 
  el mundo did n't even tried to proof facts . 
  that 's not the objective of the article ... 
   ok first , expect a couple years at least . 
  i do n't think it will be that long . 
  anyway , if that 's the case it wo n't be bad for catalonia neither . 
  catalan government ( 100 % pro-eu and in favor or more integration ) has assured all eu legislation and eu court resolutions will apply after independence . 
  so even if catalonia is out of the eu , catalonia will keep applying all the eu law being approved by the eu institutions . 
  so if you are a citizen from germany living and working in catalonia , for instance , you wo n't feel any difference ( even if catalonia is out of the eu ) , because catalonia will give you the same rights you had prior to independence as an eu citizen . 
  in other words , despite catalonia not being in the eu , catalonia will still consider you an eu citizen in an eu state ( catalonia ) , with all the rights and privileges that come from it . 
   spain or the uk do n't veto the accession ( which they will ) they wo n't . 
  spain is the first country interested in catalonia being in eu for looots of reasons . 
  but anyway , i do n't want to waste more time with you ... if you need more information , go look for it . 
  i 'm tired of explaining you all the stuff , when it 's clear you talk without knowing that much . 
  yep , it requires . 
  as the eu has said multiple times , as for not it is an internal matter of a state ( spain ) and wo n't pronounce until catalonia ( in this case ) is independent . 
  i do n't know what you know for `` rural catalonia '' ... almost all of the cities of catalonia are pro-independence . 
  and many of them are already self-declared `` independent from spain '' . 
   if catalans want to hold a referendum about independence , this is matters for catalonia alone . 
  of course it only matters to the catalan people !, 
  otherwise it would be the first independence in history that is voted by both the nation that wants to leave ( catalonia ) and the state that the first one wants to leave from ( spain ) . 
  imagine how ridiculous it would be that !, 
  it 's like the whole uk voting scotland 's referendum or the whole eu voting for brexit ... my advice is to not even try to discuss with nationalists spaniards , it 's just not worth it ... 
  el mundo doing the best he can , with his spanish nationalism ... `` actual facts '' added by the little spaniard nationalist rainymeadow , because that 's not what the real title of the article says #propaganda, 
  100 % substance . 
  you are just being fooled by spaniards on this sub and their spanish nationalist media ( el mundo ) . 
  i 'm going to be downvoted anyway , but i just warn you ( and / u/magnusmiguel and / u/chrisawhitmore ) about these spaniards that would do anything they can to prevent catalonia independence , even if this is just manipulating or lying  just realize how this propaganda is more voted on this sub ( spaniards horde ) , than [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6gld7f/thousands_of_people_gather_in_barcelona_in/ ) demonstration of thousands of catalans in barcelona in support of the referendum on independence that took place yesterday . 
  yes , catalonia will be an eu member in a matter of days , weeks or months ( in the worst case ) . 
  there will be an agreement/negotiation to make the accession process fast , since all the criteria are already fulfilled , and more than 7 million of catalan people are already eu citizens , the eu legislation is already applied , etc. 
  other eu citizens and eu business have lots of interests in catalonia , so the eu will make it fast and smooth to protect all interests involved . 
  you have to think the eu as the rational and pragmatic entity it is . 
  catalonia is one of the richest countries in europe , so it 's the interest of all to be in eu ; think of all the international companies that think of barcelona as their `` capital city '' for the whole southern europe ( from spain , france , italy to greece ) . 
  of course there 's a lot to study !, 
  one ca n't simply go `` let 's go independent '' without paying attention to all the consequences . 
  you `` ca n't '' be for a surprise when rational economic statistics and analysis are so clear with that . 
  the problem is the people that talk without knowing or having studied anything ( like `` trolls_brigade '' , who is not even catalan ) . 
  it 's important to be informed in such an important topic , which is your nation becoming a future independent state . 
  you ca n't just vote `` yes '' or `` no '' based on your feelings or sentiments . 
  there 's a lot related with it . 
  we are n't that crazy to go for independence without having studied all consequences in detail . 
  and we have been doing that for the last decade , with hundreds of people working that ( some of them are the world 's best economists on their field ) . 
  so do n't worry for us , 
   but that would definitely not be democratic . 
  saying that a referendum `` is not democratic '' is definitely the less democratic thing to say !, 
   you should wonder , instead , why some spanish experts say what they say . 
  what you need more explanations on ? 
  btw we are having a referendum on independence next ocotber 1st , not udi . 
  according to latest [ polls ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/r/godo/lv/p4/website/2017/04/16/recortada/img_scolome_20170416-190643_imagenes_lv_propias_enquesta_ok-kfnh-u421751405001xbf-992x558@lavanguardia-web.jpg ) , it was 75 % . 
  it 's been oscillating on 80 % for the last years . 
   the two nationalist parties neck deep in corruption . 
  esquerra corruption ? 
  and pdcat is 0 corruption too ... 
   how about you get the eu to sign off on that ahead of time ? 
  eu ca n't get relations with internal regions of an eu state ( catalonia in this case ) .
