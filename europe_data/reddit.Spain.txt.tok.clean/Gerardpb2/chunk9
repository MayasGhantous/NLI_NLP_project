  when catalonia becomes a state , then eu will start bilateral negotiations with a state ( catalonia ) in order to solve the accession to the european union . 
  it wo n't be a years long process , like albania or kosovo wanting yo join the eu . 
  it can be a matter of days , weeks or months . 
  at the end it 's a pretty simple procedure , since catalonia already fulfill all the criteria needed , because has been in the eu since 1986 . 
  everything has been studied already here . 
  if you want more info i can provide . 
  or you just can wait ant see , when we become independent what happens , 
  yep , we already know everything you said , we 've been working on that for the last years . 
  nothing new . 
  - we will be an eu member . 
  - we will keep using the euro as the official currency . 
  - eu business will stay and increase , due to better regulations and economy improvement after having left spain ( one of the worst countries in europe to create a business ) . 
  commanded by the lord rainymiedo !, 
  remember that all members of the constitutional court of spain ( 12 ) are chosen directly or indirectly by the government of spain , 
  of course !, 
  you do n't have to tell me , because on that same elections ( 27s ) i was appointed as a * vocal de mesa * ( do n't know the translation ) , and i had to count myself all the votes of my neighborhood in barcelona . 
  the results ? 
  massively pro-independence . 
  but whatever ... 
   but if you were the spanish government how would you allow it without breaking the constitution ? 
  just allowing it , because i do n't believe it breaks the constitution ( if podemos was the ruling party of spain , this would be his solution ) . 
  spain , without catalonia , will keep being spain . 
  the spanish constitution will still be the same . 
  international law will take care of it . 
  if you look at history , we could say almost all the independencies have `` broken '' the constitution of the state they wanted to secede from , right ? 
  how is that ? 
  how they managed to be independent ? 
  because international law recognized it ; and at the end the state that did n't wanted it , ca n't do anything . 
  specially now , in 2017 , were you do n't need a war to get independence . 
  if i was the spanish government , i would feel really `` ashamed '' of not doing anything at all . 
  comparisons can hurt , and both canada ( with quebec ) and uk ( with scotland ) approaches are so democratic and simple at the same time ... 
  it 's obvious in an international level , spain 's image is `` pretty bad '' on this issue . 
  but of course , no country will say it directly ( `` spain is so undemocratic with catalonia '' ) , as it 's treated as an internal matter ( same with quebec or scotland ) ; until catalonia is independent , international states wo n't openly talk about it . 
  but anyway , the image spain is showing to the world is bad . 
  spain ca n't hide it , since it can be seen all over the world on the press . 
  and me , if i was in the spanish government , i would never accept to be seen as this in the 21st century ; specially when other countries next to me have already made democratic solutions to this same problems . 
  how can i go to the european council meetings as if nothing happens , and look at the eyes of the other leaders when i ca n't even solve a problem i have in my own country ? 
  and this problem has an easy solution : referendum ? 
  and i 've not done anything at all about it for the last years ? 
  i do n't know , it just looks so ridiculous to me . 
  ps : [ here ] ( https://translate.google.es/translate?sl=ca&amp;tl=es&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ca&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ccma.cat%2f324%2fles-deu-claus-de-lentrevista-a-puigdemont-i-junqueras-sobre-el-referendum%2fnoticia%2f2793659%2f&amp;edit-text= ) you have a summary of the tv interview that just finished now , to the president and vicepresident of catalonia about the referendum . 
  google translated to spanish for you xd or if you understand catalan and have a free hour of time , [ here ] ( http://mp4-high-dwn.media.tv3.cat/0/3/1497218979230.mp4 ) you have the full interview ( i think i fall asleep for the most part of it ) . 
  #oh shit well i do n't think our [ team ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalonia_national_football_team#recent_callups ) is * that bad * !, 
  well spanish democracy has always been criticized , in an international perspective . 
  same goes with the independence of its judiciary power and specially the constitutional court . 
  there 's a lot to improve ; the democracy in spain is far from the consolidated ones we can see in other european states or america . 
  spain 's democracy is still young and suffers due to the `` non-stop '' transition from the dictatorship ( democracy was created and approved according to the dictatorship laws of that time , instead of breaking with them ) . 
  but i do n't want to extend on that , as this subject has been studied a lot . 
  guardiola was talking about the spanish government non-democratic approach to catalonia : no dialogue and negation of the referendum . 
  you ca n't have +80 % of the catalan population demanding a referendum , and do n't giving anything in response . 
  this approach , has been labeled as `` authoritarian '' . 
  that 's it , i just wanted to point that . 
  now you can criticize guardiola all you want xd, 
  spanish government * in case someone wants to listen guardiola : https://youtu.be/kopgmyaig_w?t=5m40s, 
  we do n't need to wait for that , we already know brexit it 's going to be bad for them !, 
  in the same way we already know how bad it is being part of a country called spain . 
  and the fastest we solve this , the better !, 
  i agree with you , that 's why we want independence !, 
  sadly spain = corruption, 
  hahahahahahaha / u/rainymeadow change your name to that please !, 
   puyol family that ruled catalonia poor [ puyol ] ( http://www.blaugranas.com/media/reportero/25/2/9/4/0/o_20140704160558_puyol_es_dificil_superar_a_bartra_mascherano_y_pique.jpg ) , he has never ruled catalonia but bar\u00e7a . 
  barcelona wanting to say in spain ? 
  are you mad or what ? 
  obviously . 
  but you will be massively downvoted for just saying that xd i mean , just look at the spanish government proposal : all spain voting on the independence referendum ... hahaha that 's their only way to ensuring the `` no '' to independence can win !, 
  that 's what spain makes me feel too  _ <, 
  thanks !, 
  let 's see what happens at the referendum, 
  if you do n't support the current government of spain , then you should n't feel insulted . 
  because guardiola was referring precisely to the spanish government . 
  in other words , another spanish government ( like podemos for instance ) would n't be called that , since they would be in favor of a referendum on independence in catalonia . 
  when he calls your country that , he is referring to the anti-democratic negative of dialogue and opposition to referendum . 
  not `` authoritarian '' in general as a political form . 
  in case someone wants to listen guardiola : https://youtu.be/kopgmyaig_w?t=5m40s, 
  and that 's why we want an independent catalonia !, 
  our biggest barrier/border today is called spain ... 
  actually no ... almost all the people there are from barcelona . 
  and your image tells exactly that , since the most voted political party in barcelona is the pro-referendum one . 
  in fact people from that political party ( podem ) attended today at montju\u00efc : like joan giner or enver aznar , for instance . 
  ps : watchin your flair , i 'm sure you 'll like this [ flag ] ( http://statics.ccma.cat/multimedia/jpg/1/3/1497180890731.jpg ) that could be seen today at the event . 
  ps2 : a '' * comarca * '' is an administrative division of catalonia . 
  barcelona is also in a comarca ... as i have told you before , without wanting to sound offensive , you tend to write pretty `` absurd '' comments / u/enelade ... 
  you see / u/flymighty ? 
  sometimes we do n't even know if he 's trolling or what . 
  he 's talking with his heart , not his brain . 
  we should just ignore his comments at this point . 
  they are just ridiculous ... 
   i hope i was of help , cheers . 
  no , it was n't xd as i told you : -1 . 
  i 've been living all my life in catalonia . 
  you do n't need to explain me this ... -2 . 
  both forms are correct . 
   there is no such thing as president of catalonia . 
  dude i live here and i 'm a jurist ... 
  i can assure you that 's exactly how we also call it . 
  even the media from [ madrid ] ( http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/2645544/0/directo/investidura-presidente-generalitat-cataluna/carles-puigdemont/ ) calls him the `` president of catalonia '' . 
  or the international press , like [ here ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/01f297c8-07e8-11e7-ac5a-903b21361b43 ) , or [ here ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/artur-mas-quits-as-acting-president-of-catalonia-1.2491242 ) . 
  both forms are right : `` president of the generalitat of catalonia '' or just `` president of catalonia '' ( shorter and way more used ) . 
  why do n't you tell the spanish or usa press to '' * stop propaganda fullfilled with blatant lies * '' , since they also say `` president of catalonia '' ? 
  seriously do n't come to cry in all posts , please ...
