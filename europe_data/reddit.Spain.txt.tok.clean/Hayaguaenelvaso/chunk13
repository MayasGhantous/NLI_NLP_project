  yes , autonomies have zero rights and powers in spain , thanks for the info / s, 
  they should replace `` so , you are latino ? '', 
  in the map with the `` so , you lisp ? '' . 
  it would transform a joke into being retarded , but if they wanted to go for annoyance ... 
  being left out is not actually a good thing for a finn ? 
  well , * there * are places to surf in both ... 
  exactly . 
  as human as it is rescuing them , getting them to mainland europe is not `` dealing with them '' . 
  if anything , it promotes the usual strategy of embarking with late pregnant women . 
  i know that radical islam ( and even moderate ) is anathema to whatever europe represents , it has been * the * enemy for centuries , shit is hitting the fan and so on , but i am glad that we got the lowest agreement to this ban . 
  n\u00f6 ... might be legal , but socially is retarded here . 
  as in , i would consider calling the social services if not done in a proper , medically related , reason . 
  it must be a busy morning of damage control for you , i hope it 's paid well haha, 
  heh , worked for that one almost 7 years ago ... 
  i hope it goes alright . 
  i heard the last months have been a bit eventful for the mission . 
  silly puns aside , i find that number a bit low ( 2.7 % ) . 
  it seems like plenty of spaniards moved to uk ( london ) / germany . 
  on the other hand , one thing is numbers and statistics and another is reality : although i did left spain , i still find quality of life extremely good there , and i see no reason at all to have any big number of emigrants . 
  a morning star , http://wstrainingacademy.com/files/single_morningstar_flail.jpg, 
  agreed . 
  6 years so far with it myself . 
  maced as in mace spray , or maced as in `` that pineapple makes a passable morning star '' ? 
  well , as little comfort as it offers , it is said that it 's a `` peaceful '' death ... 
  yeah , right ... 
  this must be right now . 
  i heard in madrid it was raining a lot this week . 
  otherwise it can not have such air quality ; last xmas they had to restrict the traffic as the pollution was reaching catastrophic levels . 
  the easiest kind of enemy is an honest enemy . 
  funny that you mention that . 
  last week i was talking about anything with an english friend , and i do n't know how we arrived at civil wars . 
  he mentioned cromwell as someone he thought could be easily named as a hero in the english civil war ( personally i did n't almost anything about the topic ) . 
  on my part , i told him that no one came to my mind as a `` hero '' in the spanish civil war ... 
  considering the full phrase , i do n't see the problem in the quote . 
  do n't get me wrong , and just focus on the fact that he said that to play down the first part , in which he implied that they were nothing special compared to the models trump is used too . 
  it 's super bizarre to defend this . 
  `` they bark , then we ride '', 
  getting 5cm from time to time do n't make us snow people ... 
  i for sure was not ready to unbury this last friday , http://imgur.com/a/egg3n, 
  pretty much , i have seen that same phrase used in spain and the question implied was clearly `` why ca n't we find engineers for this 1000 $ / month job ? '', 
  it 's called cost of opportunity . 
  you use your limited time to learn more useful things instead . 
  well , the z not being the same in different languages do n't change the fact that when staying within spanish , the `` normal '' alphabet covers the pronounciation of any word , even made up ones . 
  it has no place at school level ; the foreign language level covered there do n't need it . 
  well , personally i never learned phonetics at school . 
  perks of a read as written language . 
  wait ... 
  i can not imagine a less january-ish city than that one . 
  was n't the typical theory that they started to let in all these northern ~ ~ refugees ~ ~ barbarians in and shit went south ? 
  so ... what 's up with the `` they '' , `` them '' , etc ? 
  or are you an english catalan aficionado ? 
  that might be because instead linking the original , http://www.elperiodico.cat/ca/amp/noticias/politica/referendum-independencia-enquesta-5697731 whose main bullet points were , * el 49,6 % recolza una consulta fins i tot sense perm\u00eds de l'estat i el 48,8 % s ` oposa * the 49.6 % support a referendum without permission and 48.8 % are against it * el 's \u00ed ' a la secessi\u00f3 venceria per 8,6 punts al ` no ' per\u00f2 sense arribar al 50 % * the ` yes ' for the independence would win against the ` no ' for 8.6 points but would not reach the 50 % . 
  the op decided for a source that somehow hammered the data into a 79 % for independence . 
  i am sure that it was for a healthy reason . 
  yes , they mention in the article that is a bb gun . 
  maybe this was going to be `` just '' for a robbery . 
  then , if anything , it would have been our own fault for supporting them , not theirs . 
  but the only culprits for me are whoever did it , and the problem was not preventing it . 
  anything else is justifying the terrorists acts , suggesting they were provoked into it . 
  well , looking at the wikipedia , it was more a problem of a first case ; islamist threat was not taken so seriously back then in europe . 
  being targeted could be x fault 's , not preventing it was insufficient attention : * in the investigations carried out to find out what went wrong in the security services , many individual negligences and miscoordinations between different branches of the police were found . 
  the group dealing with islamist extremists was very small and in spite of having carried out some surveillances , they were unable to stop the bombings . 
  also some of the criminals involved in the `` little mafia '' who provided the explosives were police informants and had leaked to their case officers some tips that were not followed up on . 
  * * some of the alleged perpetrators of the bombing were reportedly under surveillance by the spanish police since 2001 . 
  * * at the time of the madrid bombings , spain was well equipped with internal security structures that were for the most part effective in the fight against terrorism . 
  it became evident that there were problems of coordination among police forces as well as within each of them . 
  the interior ministry focused on correcting these weaknesses . 
  it was spain 's goal to strengthen its police intelligence in order to deal with the risks and threats of international terrorism . 
  this decision for the national police and the guardia civil to strengthen their counter-terrorism services , let to an increase in jobs aimed at preventing and fighting global terrorism . 
  counter-terrorism services increased its employment by nearly 35 % during the legislature . 
  human resources in external information services , dealing with international terrorism , grew by 72 % in the national police force and 22 % in the guardia civil . 
  well , sorry about asking if you had any data or it was just gut feeling . 
  since you claim that it is less centralized than germany ... what are your indicators for it ? 
  actually curious , because there does n't seem to be any solid paper comparing them . 
  * on an international scale , the most common indicator used to measure and compare the extent of fiscal decentralization is the percentage of spending by the subordinate regions versus total public spending . 
  the latest figures from the oecd show that in 2012 the most decentralized country was denmark , where local spending accounted for 62 % of public spending , while the central danish government only spent 38 % . 
  this was followed by switzerland , with local spending at 58 % ; sweden , with 49 % ; the united states with 47 % ; and spain with 40 % . 
  * which will make it the fifth , ahead of germany ; but later on the article starts to talk about why is less centralized than that ( basically , the arm wrestling between madrid and catalonia , but forgetting the more favoured basque case ) . 
  well , that 's why i also said nationalistic besides independist . 
  * the ones in the rioja seem purely regionalistic , but of course the `` state of la rioja '' , was already tried in 1883 : http://web.archive.org/web/20100704085955/http://www.bermemar.com/politica/restaura/consti83_texto2.htm https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/regionalismo_y_nacionalismo_en_espa%c3%b1a, 
  there are independence/nationalistic movements for everything . 
  except madrid and castilla la mancha , i think . 
  at some point i considered doing one for madrid , grabbing a seat and living the life seeing what made-up things i could get away with . 
  well , the answer was quite appropiate , so actually i do n't have anything to add . 
  a retort of `` did we really have to lose the time to read you guys the constitution ? '', 
  would have been even better . 
  let it run , and you will see how funny the `` we have more money and speak different '' joke gets . 
  yes . 
  but it is not naivity , it 's stupidity and , ironically , hate . 
  they do n't need to , but it 's rather common . 
  i guess there is too a connection with the grammatical female gender ( most nouns that end in - a are female ) . 
  what ? 
  they are all quite good . 
  those z in zofia and zuzanna do seem a bit strange to me , but i guess that 's how they go around there . 
  afaik the idea is that . 
  the worse the traffic , the more people move to public transport . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lewis%e2%80%93mogridge_position for me , it 's on the same line of thought as solving housing price issues by increasing criminality . 
  you can not neither . 
  i do n't particularly care about the * hundreds * of comments in this same thread where the topic has not been brought up . 
  if you reread my own comment it was n't brought up in the spirit that you think i brought it up ( the `` y t\u00fa m\u00e1s '' ) .
