  groomed since you were born to vote nationalist . 
  why would n't you risk it ? 
  it will be fun , spaniards will be mad af and it will turn out ok . 
  somehow . 
  you can always emigrate if not . 
  cool kids do it . 
  now the people that are not like that and even so want to go for it , will come along to explain the midterm plan ( aka what they will live with ), 
  mmm ... i would have never counted a civil war as an invasion . 
  it could be seen as spain conquering itself i guess ? 
  is the central government actually able to interfere in such a way in andalusia without actually suspending the andalusian autonomy ? 
  the sword cuts both ways , for all the bitching against it , madrid can not interfere in most autonomies decisions without calling the big guns ( taking back all competences ) . 
  otherwise , they can only invest on it and hope for the best . 
  king ( aragon ) and queen ( castille ) got married and obviously allied ... 
  it 's not like that was the first instance of hats in politics . 
  this one was far worse : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/esquilache_riots, 
  it 's more or less clear they just went for a randomised way of reducing the number of regions everywhere without giving a thought . 
  any source op ? 
  i am sure there is a big big step between processed cocaine and coca leaves ... 
  the ifni war . 
  most spanish weaponry was american bought back then , and since they forbid their use , the war had to be fought with whatever old equipment was around ( ie , heinkels from 20 years ago ) . 
  in perejil they were `` used '' without issues because shit never really hit the fan . 
  no idea what would have happened otherwise . 
  the lesson is : your ally 's ally maybe is not your ally . 
  plan about who will your ally choose . 
  very reliable , until you get yourself in a military action they disapprove of and disallow you using your american weapons on it . 
  see spain vs morocco . 
  always loved the name . 
  it makes you think of the humanity hq straight out of a alien invasion movie . 
  what you implied - nay , said - is that the rest of spain is backwards compared to catalonia , because there the bullfighting has been banned , when it was only done for the sake of pushing the agenda ( ban the charnegos form of animal mistreatment , protect ours ) . 
  quoting you , pathetic blindfold you have there . 
  the worst of all , is that i am sure that up to today you * really * thought the correbous were some sort of seaworld ( good lord ) . 
  no wonder we are at the point we are ... 
   any kind of mistreatment is prohibited . 
  do n't try and pull that kind of bullshit , fishing for foreigners to buy it . 
  a couple of them will google it and see through it . 
  this what reality and i think of your `` rules '' : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6pegsje_30&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=55, 
  there are some small , uncannily accurate things there ... 
  besides the funny offensive ones , or the ones to boast about , look at the poles having as science `` foreign languages '' . 
  they * do * are the very best at learning foreign languages nowadays .

  well , that 's democracy . 
  no matter how damaging or stupid something is , it needs a referendum . 
  and if it wins , you have to carry on with it . 
  democracy . 
  to be fair their traditional clothes were developed in extreme heat climates . 
  they ca n't be that bad for it . 
  caesaraugusta -  cesaracosta -  sarago\u00e7a ( \u00e7 pronounced as / ts / ) -  \u00c7arago\u00e7a -  zaragoza they took it from the third variation probably . 
  fake news !, 
  the record for continental europe of 2017 has been reached today in cordoba with only 44.5 \u00b0 c. 
  at leastthey claimed it was a record for this year , the 46 \u00b0 was a prediction ? 
  maybe he is from madrid , so gets more money `` stolen '' than you from these lazy compatriots . 
  not-hiding-behind-an-s /, 
  poor unamuno . 
  caught in the middle of such a shit show , an old man looking at one side growing crazier than the other , trying his best to get some reason into such thick heads . 
  not a change climate denier , but this has been the normal for my entire life , and the one of my parents . 
  if i ask my grandparents back then was much colder and much hotter , so it does n't count . 
  three months of holidays in summer , not allowed to leave the house between 12.00 and 18.00 in a good day . 
  i do n't remember anything different . 
  how did you prepare the trip ? 
  wikipedia , wikitravel , travel blogs , google maps ... ? 
  from that link : * the degree to which the arabic language percolated through the iberian peninsula varied enormously from one area to another and is the subject of academic debate . 
  * *** however , it is generally agreed that arabic was used among the local elites , muslims and christians , and that the prevalent vernacular in many areas was mozarabic , a continuum of arabic-influenced local romance dialects . 
  *** * only the southern emirate of granada in the time of the nasrid dynasty , which had had a large influx of arabic speakers as the reconquista advanced , became totally arabized , or at least no evidence of a local romance in the late middle ages has been found . 
  * * much of the arabic influence upon spanish came through the various arabized romance dialects that were spoken in areas under moorish rule , known today by scholars as mozarabic . 
  this resulted in spanish often having both arabic and latin derived words with the same meaning . 
  for example , aceituna and oliva ( olive ) , alacr\u00e1n and escorpi\u00f3n ( scorpion ) , jaqueca and migra\u00f1a ( migraine ) , alcanc\u00eda and hucha ( piggy bank ) . 
  not any kind of economy . 
  tourist in small places like mallorca can be damaging to the local population in the sense that everything increases in cost savagely and their salaries do n't . 
  there was some articles about the difficulties of finding policemen willing to go there because basically they are n't able to afford being sent there . 
  work to lose money . 
  wrong kind of white . 
  there is a time and a place for both . 
  exactly . 
  you earn , you pay . 
  you save , you pay . 
  you expend , you pay . 
  you give it to someone , they pay . 
  it 's `` a bit '' too much . 
  yeah ... 
  i am paying around ~ 43 % , which feels a bit overkill considering there was such a big surplus . 
  following the example of carod rovira , i guess . 
  did n't expect anyone to follow him on that , but some people do have zero self-respect . 
  charnego is a despective word to name any spaniard coming from outside catalonia . 
  that 's the only use it has now , so do n't give me shit . 
  that 's good trolling , `` charnego '' . 
  the question is whether that 's an action or a reaction . 
  to the last 40 years of this . 
  https://www.dolcacatalunya.com/categoria/pura-raca/ or the effort to delete any trace of `` spanish '' is not there ? 
  the point went over your head as soon as you saw an easy answer ( racist ) . 
  if , as last time , people which are simply registered can vote over such an issue , while having no past , nor future , nor links to the country , you surely see a problem , do n't you ? 
  if it helps , imagine them voting no . 
  `` the same as us '' . 
  i am sure that they feel honoured to get their problems lowered to the level of yours , and will keep showing the same empathy . 
  until they take some holidays in catalonia and see in person the level of oppression , after which they tell you to go **** yourself . 
  https://www.dolcacatalunya.com/categoria/pura-raca/ was it similar to that ? 
  i hope this does n't sound condescending neither ... 
  but you surely do n't want to play the `` copy/paste a quote '' game in this topic , do you ? 
  sure , it 's much better to let vote hundred of thousands of moroccans/south americans that happen to live there today ( no past , no future , no links ) . 
  i am sure they care far more about our common wellbeing and future than any random `` charnego '' living in other community . 
  i will offer you a way out of that phrase of `` shoving spanish identity '' .
