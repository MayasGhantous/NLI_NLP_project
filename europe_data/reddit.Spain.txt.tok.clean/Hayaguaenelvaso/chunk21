  ( which he mentions in the video , saying that a spaniard would n't understand `` capire '' ) , `` parlar/parlotear '' , the omnipresent in most languages `` ciao '' ... and quite a lot more than might come to mind later . 
  look , this is podemos . 
  i do n't know what idea you had about them , because you seem astonished , but ... this fits them ; your summary is not wrong . 
  i thought iglesias fitted a bit better in that role of melenchon . 
  although melenchon looks like a serious man . 
  i was thinking more about the parties than the candidates themselves ; i do n't know exactly what sanchez really is . 
  a shot to appeal to the `` salvame '' audience maybe , or the chosen scapegoat for the elections they were going to fail whatever they did , in favour of podemos . 
  if melenchon have not come out to support directly macron , i guess it 's not that strange podemos wo n't , neither . 
  if we have to draw parallelism , they never supported the `` spanish macron '' ( rivera ) to form a government with the `` spanish hamon '' ( sanchez ) to stop the `` spanish fillon '' governing . 
  i heard before it was about trading with sailors from there . 
  but who knows , googling it quickly they even say it could from `` zueco '' ( a wooden shoe ) , and not `` sueco '' ( swedish ) . 
  never heard that as the origin . 
  i do n't think is a enough known fact in spain to make an idiom out of it . 
  it 's probably quite older than that . 
  edit : in 1817 the idiom was in the dictionary already . 
  well , not that strange ... 
  it 's exactly the same in most christian countries . 
  it 's just going away . 
  was that supposed to be contradictory ? 
  it is ... rather well known . 
  i mean , the `` ninis '' will not know it , but you would n't expect it neither ... 
  kinda . 
  it should be about the us , trump is temporary . 
  and i agree that the country itself was n't even close to existing yet . 
  that 's simply where the , badly explained on her part and magnified , quote came from . 
  yeah , i am not getting into the ape-shit throwing contest between , politicians , journalists and twitter teenagers . 
  but ` tis a case where she was thinking of the first spanish city founded ( cadiz , which supposedly was first reported more than 3000 years ago ) , our journalists see an easy clickbait , the tweeters some memes to create , and whoever hates the woman loses all critical thinking to feel smarter . 
  as fun as the chain gets every single time , every monarch name usually gets translated ... 
  it 's not like when we call the queen of england isabel ii instead of elizabeth ii we are trying to make her ours . 
  as said , this is going nowhere . 
  i think you were triggered , you think i am triggered . 
  at least the rest of europe is already used to us , spaniards , doing this 30-level one to one shows . 
  there was already a 10-level deep exchange of salty one liners . 
  i do n't see the need for another one . 
  sorry if you do n't like it , but language is like that ; look for a new one and hope that is n't ruined again . 
  i do n't think the foreigners knew about the meaning behind . 
  they could have suspected it seeing the post was by `` one of those guys '' , but most people wo n't pay much attention , even after all that effort to shoehorn the cause in every barely related thread . 
  sorry about the reality check . 
  it was n't about spinning anything , it was about making you see that anyone will label you as an eta supporter and not as a happy hippie . 
  thus , the phrase is tainted . 
  could say that they ignorant ; i guess as ignorant as the ones that just see nazis in swastikas and not positive energies . 
  before i fuck off , on a scale of 1-10 , how likely are you to utter that innocent phrase in a random street ? 
  perfectly fine flags , national mottos and hymns have been ruined before . 
  that phrase and eta are one now . 
  do n't play the idiot . 
  and really , stop it . 
  a good troll throws the stone and laughs at the turmoil , it does n't try to stay to pass as the ignorant good guy . 
  there is no problem with viva espa\u00f1a , but there is one with adding `` una , grande y libre '' . 
  there is no problem with gora euskadi , but there is one with adding askatuta . 
  it 's not a matter of `` opinions '' . 
  blood and murder taint . 
  i am making the courtesy to explain this for others sake ; i am sure you did n't need it . 
  because is the only one looking to stir the pot . 
  long live the basque country , death to the trolls . 
  picasso and dal\u00ed artwork is well represented by the pos the thread is about ... 
  this wo n't lead anywhere . 
  if they are like this one , ashamed . 
  did i touch a nerve ? 
  because religion it 's not just an idea . 
  it 's something that people feel deeply attached to . 
  in some cases , more than nationality ( something that is also just an idea ) . 
  more than realities as solid and unchangeable as race . 
  attacking it for the sake of attacking only attack the people that stand by it and breeds hate . 
  it does n't bring anything to the table but that . 
  that picture it 's the 1969 of internet lowbrow trolling . 
  critic it as and where you should , just as you would do with x country or race , instead of just breeding hate ; denounce hypocrisy , interference with politics or the ways of life of other . 
  that will change a lot on how people receives your message . 
  do it as thoughtfully and precise as you would if you decided you needed to critice sweden or black people . 
  really ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  it 's a fine line ... on one hand , you can not have something as a religion being untouchable and above non-believers . 
  but on the other hand , do you really have to attack it so directly as the image above ? 
  where does it start to be a hate provoking image which yes , should be completely banned , as it is nothing but harmful ? 
  critic and provocation are sometimes easy to mistake , they can be intertwined , but come on , here we are going full into provocation territory . 
  well , they were paid for it , so praise they did . 
  but do n't worry , ours already served their purpose ( split and sink the psoe ) . 
  good riddance to both . 
  i think wtfism fits the genre quite well ... 
  if they had started it nowadays it will probably the nickname . 
  well , it was better than magaluf . 
  at least this time the police drew blood . 
  why is n't that a part of the video ? 
  the beggars were not the only ones humiliated, 
  look at the bright side , that much interest in getting an increase of defense budget means he does n't really plan to attack here . 
  ok , it also means that he wants some mates to go in adventures , but at least the first option is discarded . 
  schultz , schulz ... close enough . 
  part ii : https://i.redd.it/krf31acvwwcy.jpg, 
  true , quite sad . 
  they were also extremely popular in spain . 
  there were always films from them on holidays ... great times . 
  one spanish bank went full nostalgia not that long ago ( 2009 ) and hired bud spencer for a commercial . 
  came to mind with that caralho post ( thanks portus ! ) . 
  ( added a few more ( without a number , since people were using the previous numbering as reference ) ) ** cojones used together with a number ** * 1 . 
  un coj\u00f3n = expensive ( ex . 
  tres cojones = to not care ( ex . 
  un n\u00famero muy grande m\u00e1s la palabra `` par '' ( a large number plus the word pair ) = difficult ( ex . 
  lograrlo me cost\u00f3 mil pares de cojones ) this is similar to `` i told you a million times . '' ** when cojones is used as a verb ** * 5 . 
  = expression of surprise * 7 . 
  poner ( cojones ) = to lay down a challenge ( ex . 
  me corto los cojones = a bet or challenge to someone similar to `` i swear on my mother 's grave '' but literally translated as `` i 'll cut my balls . '' * 9 .
