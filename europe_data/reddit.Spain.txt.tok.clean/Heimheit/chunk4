  freak of dogs . 
  it 's that the same as a perroflauta ? 
  the last one have a dog , but the allergy to soap , marihuana and a diabolo are equally important . 
  well , embassy terrain is part of the embassy 's country ... 
  so the bigger terrain the embassy takes , the bigger the empire grows . 
  i can even imagine embassy employees moving the fences inch by inch in the middle of the night . 
  iberia ... 
  i have only used it for flights inside europe , but quite a few times already . 
  for me it is quite ok . 
  i do a lot zurich - madrid , and for that flight is a bit worse than swiss airlines ( they give a free coffee , and the places are slightly bigger ) , but overall i am happy with it . 
  never had a problem , attendants are very nice , but i miss getting some coffee/snack for free in the flight . 
  ps : if you want to compare flight companies for a route , use https://www.routehappy.com/ to see the advantages of each one . 
  they are quite precise . 
  they have a newspaper called `` la farola '' . 
  but i think it was too much and they have left it for the inmigrants . 
  so spanish ones do nothing ( well , drugs ) . 
  the rumanians `` wash '' cars in the traffic lights and fake being deaf in the trains . 
  at the end , is very likely that he was the executor but not the mastermind behind it . 
  just a militar taking orders , as the others that were with him . 
  he has kept his mouth shut , so there is plenty of speculation about who was behind ( this so called `` white elephant '' , maybe the king himself ), 
  how is the number done , to not skew the results ? 
  because in the example both you and me gave , they do skew them . 
  well , they still count . 
  if you have 1m young people , of which 500k do n't have a job , 100k are in military service , and 400k are working , the unemployment is 500k/900k = 55.5 % if they were not in the service , the unemployment would be 600k/1000k = 60 % . 
  so countries with obligatory service ( greece ) have it worse that countries without ( spain ) . 
  i prefer that the uk stays . 
  but i think that whether the rest of eu populace wants the uk to stay or not should a factor while voting . 
  while voting think of what is the best future for you . 
  i would n't care about feeling loved or hated in polls . 
  i am curious about how cruel the candy throwers are . 
  here we throw candy from `` trucks '' at 6th january . 
  and in half the places , the candy throwing teenagers/youngs seem to aim to the head of the people waiting to catch any candy . 
  i guess that 's why some people started to bring umbrellas to the events . 
  which then they use backwards to use catch as much candy as possible instead of protecting themselves . 
  maybe finnish are more kindhearted while throwing candy ? 
  there you go , [ king alphonse xiii in the metro ] ( https://ecomovilidad.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ina.jpg ) . 
  i do n't know why , but it was when i saw this photo in our history lessons that something changed in my mind . 
  up to that point , all those kings felt ancient . 
  and then this one ancient king was there , in the metro that i took everyday which felt so ... nowadays . 
  i just want summer to come :( i ca n't see these things in the middle of winter ... 
  maybe someone that has spent there more years than me can answer you better , but i have seen it a lot of times . 
  more or less the same as bw . 
  only italy + germany ? 
  i guess the interpretation is different , but i remember that the `` four industrial motors '' of the eu were supposed to be ba-wu in germany , lyon in france , lombardy in italy and catalonia in spain . 
  ah ... shit , really sorry to hear it . 
  i hope the casualties count stay as low possible . 
  human error involved ? 
  in the last train accidents i remember , this was the cause , as the systems are very reliable at this point ... 
  nobody is going to ask about portugal ? 
  what are you guys doing there in the south ? 
  i have never heard anything bad before about la albufeira . 
  the whole thing is certainly sad . 
  it 's obvious that it was a shitstorm that the right wind tried to take advantage of to attack the government of madrid , and that the left wind on charge of madrid tried to distance from as much as possible to not be caught on it , leaving the puppeteers hanging in the wind , attacked by both sides . 
  it happened at blinding speed during the weekend , so i guess it will be clarified and they will be released soon without even an apology . 
  it 's a colored map , and the information matches my old prejudices against india . 
  now this is the first thing that * pops * into my mind when i hear slovakia . 
  mmm ... it 's an intonation thing , mixed with some expressions . 
  it 's a not a way of pronouncing things . 
  let me illustrate it with a golden clasic : the `` pija '' ( posh ) drunken girl ala `` there is something about mary '' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=royjwxejmpo * `` you have something white in your hair '' * `` yes , i know , it 's , it 's , it 's ... '' * `` it 's like ... cream ? 
  foam ? ... . 
  toothbrush paste ? '', 
  * `` hehehehe , no , no , no ... 
  it 's another thing , hehehehehe '' * `` er ... what it is ? '', 
  * `` it 's ... do n't remember '' * change topic *, 
  yep , el pais is also published in english . 
  unless you flight in business , where you get nice metallic forks and knifes . 
  the knifes do n't really cut that much , but the forks could do a nice mess . 
  yes , indeed it was a joke . 
  it is certainly sad that i have been a negative number for the balance of the nation for the first ~ 25y , and as soon as i , the investment , start to pay off , i go to another country which has gotten a young healthy , taxpayer engineer for free . 
  who most likely will go back to spain once is older and not productive . 
  some of us are trying to help ... 
  i left the country , so my old job is for the taking . 
  de nada , guys !, 
  mm ... but then the problem is that they are pushing for a `` elite only '' deal . 
  pile on useless non-optional luxury things to restrict access . 
  i guess that if you get there , your money is well spent anyways , as long as you are social enough to get life lasting connections with other rich and well connected people . 
  but if the government is already spending more money than our countries ( % of total taxes , grand total will be of course higher ) , there should be plenty of options to get a good education without debt , with minimal miscellaneous services . 
  but that 's the way i see uni . 
  i do n't have too much personal contact with americans , but i get the impression that uni culture is there a far bigger deal than here . 
  yes , half of the cars i see in konstanz everytime i go there are theirs . 
  that 's why i was wondering how much can they save living close to the borders , or better yet , living at the other side of the border . 
  i think it 's more like the government does n't pay for it . 
  so you have to pay all of it yourself . 
  do you know whether is easy is to live ( or rather , work ) in switzerland , but have as many expenses as possible in france/italy/germany / austria ? 
  it seems a common strategy near the `` dreil\u00e4ndereck '' , but i wonder how well they fare . 
  does n't that come from el bosco ? 
  :p you are right , it 's and adjective and it comes from bosque , although the adjective for something related to `` bosque '' things is only `` forestal '' . 
  also , the more i write bosque , the more strange the word seems . 
  not the first time that a word does that to me . 
  although the adjective for forest ( bosque ) related things is always `` forestal '' . 
  there is none related to `` bosque '' . 
  if anything operating in spain gives them plenty of similar minded freedom fighter idiots to befriend . 
  if you want a link to a certain spanish left minded spanish site ( +50 % podemos voters in the on-site polls ) , i could show you how they are praising the arrested and dishing the law . 
  was watching the intro to see if it ring a bell ... and nothing : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bcdnu6sq0a i was small but not so much to not remember it , so i guess i skipped it somehow . 
  i would have thought about sunday evening if i saw that out of context . 
  funny that is another way of saying saturday . 
  i remember some jokes with mexicans in spanish dubbed family guy . 
  in the original , brian speaks english and the mexican replies in spanish because he doesnt speak english . 
  in the dub , in order for it to make sense , brian was speaking spanish and the mexican was replying in english . 
  it was certainly bizarre to watch .
