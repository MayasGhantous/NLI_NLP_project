  but what he meant is that if a beach is extremely known and full of people , the quality is very likely to have dropped and the price increased . 
  it is fine to come for that , but it is worth it to look for more beach sites besides the already full ones . 
  yep . 
  i hope c 's fares better next time , but looking at the las 20 years , after 4 years of left government , voters will run away en mass to pp . 
  but i still hope that the circle breaks to another party . 
  lets hope that the cure is not setting the body on fire . 
  aka p. . . 
  sympathy to the cause . 
  i am patriotic as far as i thing that union , heritage and thinking about the greater/common good can produce a better place to live for me and those after me . 
  there is also a bit of pride intertwined there . 
  but i am not patriotic symbol wise . 
  i think i have never own something with a flag on it . 
  not so alone , i would say . 
  what i think is that in most languages we took one root and made it the `` standard '' one , but a `` mansi\u00f3n '' is a normal word in spanish . 
  it means luxurious , big house , though . 
  funny that we lost was domus , remaining only in `` dom\u00f3tica '' . 
  edit : actually , seems like in latin the word was `` casa '' , and '' domus '' was just used for the upper classes .

  i do n't know if you are posting milder places , but most of them are simply ugly , not `` worst location '' deserving . 
  or maybe you do n't have such shit holes in your countries ... 
  it should be `` were for a few years , '' instead of `` are '' , but ok , you know better . 
  i am sure that from the pov of the other would-be country is a shining example of loyalty . 
  yeah , i do n't think i am going to get anything interesting out of your mind when the first reply was a `` t\u00fa m\u00e1s '' and the second a personal attack . 
  good day , and good luck . 
  treason to spain is quite popular and accepted . 
  btw , bringing up the shit pp does , does n't defend podemos . 
  also , now that i see your flag , do n't you think that treason to the state is a good thing ? 
  what am i missing here ? 
  treason to the state it 's part of the program of many elect parties in spain . 
  i do n't think anyone will bate an eye to that . 
  it makes sense for podemos and its electorate too . 
  i have never heard anyone taken erasmus seruiously , so i kind of believe all that . 
  for most people there , erasmus equals to partying all the year and getting the exams passed for free , studying as less as possible . 
  you can imagine the kind of students you are getting . 
  only for a very small % erasmus is about improving themselves . 
  postgrads on the other hand , take the opportunity to go abroad more seriously , so i would be surprised to hear the same attitude from them . 
  and yes , cat people can get very special abroad . 
  we do n't really want to hear political speechs each single time someone obliquely groups you with the rest of spaniards . 
  i know . 
  but clich\u00e9s . 
  i always had quite different clich\u00e9s in mind . 
  germans : beers , sausage , industry and engineering . 
  austria : alps , classical music and palaces . 
  stem vs arts . 
  well , if i can make a bonfire in a club , it does sound better . 
  or it 's the bonfire mdma induced ? 
  i think my main problem is that i really did n't like the type of music used in the typical club / `` discoteca '' . 
  so ... really loud music that i do n't care about , smoke and shitty alcohol equals to `` what the fuck i am doing here '' . 
  in a pub i get music that i like , the drinks are better and cheaper , and i can both enjoy the music and talk without going partially deaf after a few years of '' '' '' `` fun '' '' '' '' . 
  i wo n't miss them . 
  pubs are far better for me , i never understood the appeal of clubs . 
  i ended up hating going there because that was `` the plan '' . 
  the main problem is that is the last big war ... and that it is the most , by a looooong difference , touted around war . 
  yes , i am a few years behind of getting picky about everything , sorry about that . 
  paparr , `` madrid '' used in that sense is slowly becoming an idiot detector as good as `` todos y todas '' . 
  use it if you want , but be aware of the implications . 
  last time i checked , madrid was governed by `` ahora madrid '' , aka podemos ( simplifying ) , friendly towards the referendum . 
  mind blown ? 
  i expected some hot water thrown in his direction before he let go the presidency of catalonia . 
  quite telling that he prefered it instead of going for new elections . 
  i also got that impression . 
  most ( all ) houses i have been in germany had n't asked me to take the shoes off , nor anyone has done it . 
  then again , most of the times they were `` big '' parties with a lot of people around instead of a small 4-5 persons dinner . 
  i guess that could change things ? 
  note : a lot of people in my office remove their shoes and wear slippers . 
  german thing , or crazy office ? 
  until the pendulum swings again , which happens if you try to go for the extremes , instead of staying in the fair middle . 
  i guess you are already implying this , but at least in spain , feminism is usually heavily left handed , so these situations are kind of a mental shortcircuit . 
  when the assaulters are men from the country everything is so clear ... 
  thanks  i live not so far away from switzerland , so maybe i will check the places out and do a trip of a few days with the car . 
  i passed over bern , zurich and luzern ( and then a lot of smaller places around jungfrau ) , and i would order them as luzern  bern  zurich . 
  but being luzern quite small i could understand people nor rating it very high . 
  or even not considering it a city , what it is what the thread is about . 
  but it was a really nice place to spend a couple days . 
  if this was not about cities , i would put lauterbrunnen as your best place . 
  * `` it 's a huge sea-change , when you consider that just seven years ago german workers were being sent to work in spain 's then booming economy , '' thomas liebig , a migration expert with the oecd , told die zeit , referring to the time , not all that long ago , when it was germany which was considered to be the sick man of europe . 
  * i really have a short term memory . 
  did that happen seven ( + three ) years ago ? 
  really ? 
  i guess it depends on the sector . 
  i work in engineering there ( ba-wu ) , and the metal union tables for salaries are not bypassed . 
  they pay what they must pay . 
  how strong is the rabenmutter idea in your zone , if you do n't mind asking ? 
  just curious if it is both a government and social thing . 
  in spain it is . 
  i am glad they are friendlier towards wolfs there . 
  i have a fair share of farmers in my family . 
  so i can say first hand that wolf repopulation must be a quite hard task . 
  they are extremely against it , and like them , all the people that live of the land . 
  they will vote against any party that promotes it , and will sabotage it given the chance . 
  wolf , dog and man . 
  what a triangle . 
  he is ( was ) so bad , that when they organized a four ways debate , he sent his second in command to do his job . 
  he also has a nice collection of fuck ups while talking on live . 
  most of them are hardly believable until you watch the video . 
  we kinda forgot is there . 
  i really like that these things are always taped now . 
  they will be paying for it in a couple of days . 
  if they ca n't recognize the faces , at least one of them will be posting they did it on twitter by next week .
