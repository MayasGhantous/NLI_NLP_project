  yep , the year i manage to wake up before it ends , i will certainly watch it . 
  i was really close this year !, 
  ( i would really like to watch it on live , i am not being sarcastic ) . 
  i do n't remember any particular song . 
  but each year we have a new antic related to the 12 grapes in the 12 bells to midnight . 
  some fuck up in live , or something with the dresses . 
  the cloak of ramontxu , or from last year : nfswish : [ pedroche ] ( http://img2.europapress.net/fotoweb/fotogaleriafamosos_99953_430.jpg ), 
  but the one in the front is also without ( rear ) lights ? 
  he was thinking of treasury . 
  they were more or less popular in catholicism : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ossuary poland , portugal , spain , czech , austria , italy , france ... 
  well ... the problem is forgetting or not knowing how to switch to english pronunciation . 
  i do n't see a problem pronouncing them the spanish way . 
  i do n't see a problem neither with how rodeo , cojones , aficionado , mesa , vigilante or peninsula are pronounced in english , nor i say they are wrong . 
  is annoying enough that they do n't work in half of the places in germany , to have another country join the party with its own card . 
  but it 's quite understable in their case , if they are been used against them . 
  avila is not madrid . 
  i would go with cyberpunk for the original one . 
  quite a good photo . 
  i saw the moon as it was raising yesterday over \u00c1vila , and it was certainly worth a photo ... a shame we were driving . 
  imagine this wall with that moon behind : [ walls of \u00c1vila ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/panoramica_nocturna_de_la_ciudad_de_%c3%81vila.jpg ) it was straight out of a dark fantasy setting . 
  we kinda do ... at least in madrid romanian gypsies have made quite a reputation of being more annoying and dangerous than the local ones . 
  like super gypsies . 
  i do n't have the insight on why the us does that , but 100 % of the time if someone has a problem with a rumanian visiting their country ... 
  it is because they think of gypsies . 
  you get some surprises . 
  in a german class , there were a rumanian couple with me . 
  when i heard the guy translate `` rindfleisch '' , i thought they were speaking spanish . 
  done differently than in most countries ... 
  asking for a beer and getting a proper `` tapa '' for free with it . 
  it seems like these `` tapa '' restaurants are now everywhere . 
  but that is not the idea . 
  the idea , for me , is to get them `` free '' with a 2 $ beer and not knowing what you are going to get . 
  just that if you have chosen the place well , it 's going to be * good * . 
  you only know that you are going to dine with 3 beers . 
  i might be an outlier , but i do n't see terrible big differences while living in germany . 
  yes , it is different , but not in the sense of not being able to agree on how things should be done ... 
  in fact , while working i barely see a difference , i see it on how people act in their free time . 
  there are enough cultural differences to stay different countries , but not to not have the same laws . 
  it is usually presented like this , [ pulpo ] ( http://villasincostabrava.com/imagens/fotos/pulpo%20a%20la%20gallega-4.jpg ) someone find it unnerving ? 
  that will make for a good thread . 
  i was surprised about finding people found disgusting octopus or seeing a [ ham leg ] ( http://grupofrial.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/jamon-asado-pata-blanca-400x338.jpg ) anyways , it 's not strange to see people finding other countries food disgusting ... 
  when people from the same country find it so also ( snails , casu marzu ( that rotten cheese ) , surstr\u00f6mming ( that rotten fish ) ) , etc. 
  well , there was always a multiparty system . 
  the thing that has changed , is that the main two parties have lost a lot of power . 
  but they had to reach agreements with other parties to govern before . 
  there was always quite lot of choice . 
  what i feel that have changed now , is that the new two parties really felt like they had a chance to be as big as the two `` traditional ones '' ( which are not so old , specially pp ) . 
  which is a bit of a snowball effect , because there is always quite a lot of people that like to vote to parties that have a chance , even if a minor one fits them better . 
  the so called `` useful vote '' , or the way i see it : `` the party i voted is big , i am winner '' mentality . 
  he will surely buy you a fanta   , 
  if you understood him , it will seem as good looking as a jersey shore guy . 
  but that could be your thing . 
  it is hard to put into words , but to me he is the embodiment of this side of spain [ salvame ] ( http://www.formulatv.com/images/noticias/48300/48369/1_e8fb7404d2.jpg ) chavs ? 
  i guess it 's the closest type of people i think about when i hear or see pdr snchz . 
  and it freezes my heart . 
  i will pick absolutely anyone but pedro sanchez . 
  i really hope that if psoe gets in there , whoever supports them demand the head of pdr snchz as a non negotiable requirement . 
  best part of the zurich one it 's the train . 
  last thursday i needed exactly 20 minutes from train to waiting for the plane . 
  and i was carrying baggage . 
  i have not seen all the airports , but i would vote for this one , just for how easy and fast is it . 
  not the prettiest , the shops and food is highway robbery , but if you just want to get there easy and fly away fast , it is very efficient . 
  yes . 
  not venezuela ? 
  i prefer doing the experiment of a far left party winning in a country , in portugal , if you do n't mind , 
  out of memory , 2/3 of the population did n't speak basque . 
  being `` forced '' to speak the other two languages is nothing but reality showing its face . 
  the difference , in economy , is : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basque_economic_agreement, 
  i hope it goes ahead . 
  it 's small effort to norway but a really cool thing to gift . 
  here you wo n't hear it in the street . 
  only in a book . 
  or a journalist scrapping for synonyms . 
  i think that one is more less extended . 
  apollonian is an adjetive in several languages ( at least in spanish `` apol\u00edneo '' exists too ) . 
  yep , that one does work ( cossack ) . 
  if someone is going to be offended about `` pretend to be swedish '' being used for someone ignorant , the meaning is probably related to the tourists of the 60s . 
  first , more than being ignorant , `` hacerse el sueco '' means to feign that you do n't understand what someone is asking you to do . 
  foreign people that do n't understand the language , and are in holidays ( so they are in happy-go-lucky mode ) , fit quite well on that point . 
  so it 's not because anyone see it as a swedish trait . 
  more like a `` guiri '' trait . 
  seeing how they use the `` spanish '' adjective for sayings in other places , i think we are being quite nice overall . 
  but you know how it gets , in spain the hate is between us , not to other countries . 
  ps : never heard those below before ,  hopefully you would then be able to celebrate your success `` drinking like a german '' ( `` beber como un tudesco `` ) while making sure that your friends are not `` jealous as a turk '' ( `` celoso como un turco `` ) . 
  if i may intervene ... 
  i think his/her point is that if the economic concert of the basque country was the same as in every other autonomy , there will be more money going out of the basque country to the rest of spain . 
  that 's the objective point . 
  what it 's open to discussion is whether or not it will be fair to redistribute more money to the rest of spain . 
  in my opinion , this should be a `` all or nothing '' . 
  everyone does it the basque way , or everyone does it the other way . 
  in my mind , the basque country way will be better for a lot of cases , as having the freedom to tailor the system for each autonomy will lead to a better one . 
  the problem though , is that it will worsen the differences between comunities , as the flow to the poorer ones will slow down . 
  it will allow them to attract people and companies via taxes , though . 
  personally , i think we should somehow aim to stay united as a country , but to descentralize as much as possible companies and services . 
  that almost all engineers ( for example ) must go to madrid , catalonia or basque country to find a job is really far from ideal . 
  to the people living in those cities ( impossible trafic and living costs ) , and to the people in the other communities , which in a lot of cases will be happier staying close to their families and friends instead of flocking to the big cities . 
  kind of . 
  no hot wine in madrid . 
  i was actually surprised to see the one in madrid there . 
  i mean , i think it is a great one .
