ebola summer camp !, 
  but what about switzerland or sweden ? 
  they also have high life expectancy rates . 
  climate can not explain it all , and i 'd say that us being relaxed is more of an urban legend that a reality ... but to each his own . 
  \u00a1 genial !, 
  it 's not just lidl , in spain every supermarket does this . 
  and you do n't have to pay , it is returned to you , 
  bad luck spain : * cuna del segundo idioma m\u00e1s hablado del mundo . 
  * irrelevante en su propio continente . 
  wow . 
  it looks like it 's floating above the clouds . 
  silly zeus stop playing with us . 
  you could just say ` everything ' and it would be pretty accurate . 
  well , you 'll always have el corte ingl\u00e9s , it 's like madrid 's beach . 
  beautiful . 
  so do i. . . :( not madrid in august , though ... 
  well , [ neither of them ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ybrbxrz.jpg ) was in my picture . 
  i do n't know if they count as skyscrapers , although both were - at their respective times - the tallest buildings in europe !, 
  the four towers are indeed lonely , [ but there are more skyscrapers ( or at least , high-rise buildings ) in the city ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zbkalzj.jpg ) . 
  is n't your 17th state mallorca ? 
  well , the first one does look old but also ... charming . 
  i like it . 
  i live in madrid , and whereas it 's not as great as you 're putting it , i could n't picture my life without the city 's metro system . 
  it makes everything easier ,, 
  i 've looked into it and yes , you are correct . 
  the difference is wider than i had previously though , but still the largest ez ( not eu ) economies are germany , france and italy . 
  spain is a distant fourth place . 
  poor spain , nobody wants to stay . 
  only brits and germans looking for fun/a quiet retirement/sex/tapas . 
  it 's a complicated mix . 
  italy is a world power , the 3rd largest economy in the eurozone not so far ahead from france . 
  i 'd say their figure is ( at least ) surprising . 
  hey , do n't blame us !, 
  there 's the south of italy , but we also managed mexi ... ok , it 's not the best example . 
  we owned colomb ... ok , again it might not be the best example either . 
  uhmm ... argentina ? 
  the south of the usa ? 
  ok , on second thought i think we deserve everything bad that 's happening to us . 
  i was n't talking about ebola . 
  you are absolutely right , though . 
  he 's been in africa for 54 years ... and there are lots of things to do in africa besides providing ( much needed ) medical aid . 
  those were the days . 
  good old iberian times . 
  i 've also got safari and i see it in blue ... 
  but again ... tortilla with or without onion ? 
  siesta on the couch or in your bed ? 
  this is gon na take a while , better start making caf\u00e9 con leche pls . 
  do n't forget that we speak spanish , which is a very ` powerful ' language . 
  we tend to create our own communities , i guess . 
  hey , we are relevant !, 
  siesta or flamenco ? 
  tortilla or paella ? 
  ** important decisions ** have to be made , we do n't have time for those trivial matters you mentioned . 
  well , it depends on what you understand for ` recover ' . 
  japan is the third largest economy in the world and a major power in several different fields , from high-tech to culture - so i 'd say they are doing ok . and i was n't comparing anything , just saying that things are - sadly - tough , but old countries like ours have faced worst situations and ... here we are . 
  sorry , you are wrong . 
  [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/japan_public_debt ) is just a recent example . 
  throughout history the spanish crown has gone bankrupt so many times it 's actually ridiculous . 
  just for instance , we defaulted ** 6 ** times during the 1700s . 
  not really . 
  today 's figure comes from a rather complex survey called epa . 
  it takes into account several factors such as the occupation rate or the aging of spaniards , so it 's usually much more realistic than the * actual * figure from the spanish employment agency ( it will probably be at 23 % now in july ) , which only considers people actually looking for a job . 
  as to the median quality of life , not only is it not improving but it 's been in constant decline since 2010 ... such as everything in spain ( even football ) . 
  it sounds terrifying . 
  just for instance , what if there are kids on the boat ? 
  i do n't know about italy , but in spain , by law , they are protected until they are 18 and can not obviously be deported . 
  lol . 
  so sad . 
  i 'm not even going to edit my comment . 
  wow , we receive a ridiculous amount of money . 
  edit : okay , actually in terms of countries ' gpa , it is not a lot of money at all . 
  * dear god * ... 
  we used to be number 1 :( . 
  it 's like we are not even trying anymore . 
  it is fast and ridiculously cheap , so here it 's full of students and people who do n't like to cook . 
  and i happen to be in both of these groups !, 
  ceuta and melilla , interesting ( i assume the majority choose islam ) . 
  trust me , i 'm from spain , we are the switzerland of unemployment . 
  well , it should n't ... they are employed , even though they are under a temporary contract . 
  yay . 
  of course . 
  i 'm sorry , but i still do n't see your point . 
  i meant to say that there are many more things that have nothing to do with franco that make madrid and its region the second richest region in spain by gdp . 
  i just wanted to add that while it 's true that madrid being the capital of spain has helped the region , you can also argue that barcelona 's status as capital of catalunya is also beneficial for the city . 
  that 's too simplistic an argument . 
  i completely agree with you on ` catalans vs spanish ' being a semantic inaccuracy . 
  however , it is true that this fallacy has been used by both sides . 
  the way this is being handled by our politicians in madrid and barcelona - and everywhere in spain - is disgusting . 
  ps : yay the good wife !, 
  / r/forwardsfromgrandma european version !, 
  pls send help . 
  or we could kill them with flamenco , \u00e0 la mars attack . 
  i. . . am confused . 
  but ... but ... anyway . 
  everything i was raised to believe in is a lie ? 
  yeah ... right . 
  too soon . 
  you are just angry because we are clearly going to get gibraltar back . 
  \u00d1 power !, 
  well , to be fair there are lots of good documentaries produced in europe .
