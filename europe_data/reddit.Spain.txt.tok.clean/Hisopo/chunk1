sorry , i forgot the orthodox !, 
  in other words , a map of traditionally catholic and orthodox countries . 
  ireland , what happened to you ?!, 
  edit : forgot the orthodox :(, 
   is n't that catholicism and orthodoxy in a nutshell ? 
  actually , it 's misunderstanding of catholicism and orthodoxy in a nutshell . 
  / r/accidentalrenaissance /, 
  yes , a poll please . 
  first things first . 
   looks more comfortable . 
  it 's narrower , so i think that it only looks that way . 
  i 'm ok if they also move [ its interior design ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/european_parliament_strasbourg_hemicycle_-_diliff.jpg ) to brussels . 
  the design of the brussels ' chamber is [ ugly as hell ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/european_parliament_-_hemicycle.jpg ) . 
  if spanish people decide to allow it , i 'll have to accept it despite the fact that i do n't like it . 
   so i ask once again , why are you against changing the constitution to allow it ? 
  i think [ i 've answered you ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4utijf/catalonia_tells_spain_it_will_push_for_secession/d5tdqvw ) :  because my nation is spain , and we spanish people decide . 
  everybody . 
  not a group of people . 
  i [ said ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4utijf/catalonia_tells_spain_it_will_push_for_secession/d5tdxmr ) `` and then stop '' . 
  because what catalans want is push for a referendum until they get what they want , but after that they are not going to allow any other referendum . 
   legitimacy has to be renewed what happened with this ? 
  until you finally get what you want and then stop ? 
  because my nation is spain , and we spanish people decide . 
  everybody . 
  not a group of people . 
  my position is someway similar to the position of the catalan independentists : they feel catalonia is their nation , and so they think that people from barcelona should accept what catalonia as a whole says . 
  but the fact is that democratic laws give me the reason . 
  spanish constitution says spain is a nation and we spanish people decide . 
  the spanish people are sovereign . 
  this is the only thing that is not negociable : is the key of democracy and rule of law . 
  i thought you were trying to be the most democratic place on earth as opposed to spain . 
  yes . 
   is not physically damaging sorry , but yours is the typical politically biassed opinion that appears always with this bullfighting topic . 
  if setting a bull on fire is not physically damaging , what it is ? 
  every animal right organizations are against * correbous * . 
  those organizations that were opposed to bullfighting in catalonia also were opposed to correbous . 
  but only bullfighting was banned by catalan politicians , of course . 
   this is not how this works . 
  and  we have the recognised right to vote for our independence . 
  this is not how this work . 
  exactly . 
  you 've pointed it out . 
  then i suppose that after the independence of catalonia you 'll have referendums each 10 years asking people whether they want to come back to spain or they are fine . 
   without legitimacy . 
  voted by the 88.54 % of people in spain as a full and 90.46 % of the catalans in 1974 . 
  yeah , sure ... 
  oppression ? 
  wtf ? 
  the constitution of spain was voted by the 90.46 % of the catalans in 1974 . 
  the acceptance of the constitution was 88.54 % in spain as a full . 
  because you ca n't have a democracy without laws . 
  if democracy only means voting ( as many of you think ) then i ( the full population of the flat where i live ) am going to vote not paying taxes and the rest will have to accept it . 
  nonsense . 
  that is the degeneration of democracy . 
  and is the first step to break it . 
  of course , but they do n't want . 
  that is how democracy works . 
  if you lose , you have to accept the result . 
   we have our right to vote who gave you that right ? 
  not the democratic laws ... 
   change the constitution then . 
  they do n't have enough deputies in the parliament , that is why they are trying unilaterally . 
  they do n't like the democratic rules , so they want to break them . 
   the generation that will fight tooth and nail to enshrine animal torture in spanish law because muh traditions ? 
  actually , the generation that banned bullfighting in catalonia for being a spanish tradition but not '' [ fire bulls ] ( https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;biw=1224&amp;bih=843&amp;q=correbous ) '' because they are catalan . 
  that was after , 
  [ an hour ago you said ] ( https://reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4u3v7z/catalonians_in_favour_of_independence_now/d5nwvnl ) :  spanish is not our native language , our native language is catalan . 
  do you still mantain that spanish is not a native language of catalan people after seeing that data ? 
   a native language is the language you grew up with ( ... ) we are forced to learn it beacause we live in spain and that 's it . 
  i 'm expecting you to explain how can you be forced to learn since you 're born and not being your native language . 
  also , again , [ oficial polls by the catalan gov ] ( http://www.idescat.cat/economia/inec?tc=3&amp;id=da01&amp;dt=2008 ) regarding language use in catalonia ( 2008 ) : language | native language | identification with language | usual language -- | -- | -- | -- catalan | 31,02 % | 36,38 % | 36,29 % spanish | 55,14 % | 47,55 % | 50,73 % you are fighting against reality again and again . 
  and then you call me fascist in a very democratic way . 
  those laws are suppose to be against spanish laws or invade the competences of the spanish parliament . 
  a law against national laws is something that is not allowed anywhere . 
   what we have here is a weird merge that have the worst of centralism and the worst of federalism . 
  that is something i agree with you . 
  one of the problems we have with autonomous communities is that there is no legal limit on which competences can be transferred to them and sometimes it is not clear the limits between national competences and autonomous competences ( the catalan laws that you said before are a good example of how big is this problem and how important is to solve not just for catalonia but for spain as a whole ) . 
   spanish is not our native language , our native language is catalan you have three official languages in catalonia at the moment . 
  this is your own law !!, 
  you have two native languages : spanish and catalan . 
  according to polls from the catalan government , spanish is even more spoken than catalan . 
  seriously , you can not hide something that is a fact . 
   the official languages of a future catalan republic will be the same as now : aranese , catalan and spanish . 
  but i wo n't be able to speak in french , so you will be repressing me , acording to your rhetoric . 
  i ca n't believe that you ask me if is so hard to comprehend to me , as everything you says is against reality and common sense . 
  the eu chambers allow multiple languages because we do n't have a common language . 
  we spanish people have a common language . 
  you refusing to speak to other spanish people in a language that is also your native language and you speak perfectly is both stupid and impolite . 
  will i be allowed to speak french in the parliament of catalonia ? 
  will you employ translators ? 
  now i see ... you want employ translators because you do n't want to speak in a common language that you share with the rest of you colleagues . 
  and if not , we are oppressing you . 
  so your problem is that , despite you speak spanish , you want to speak catalan in the congress of deputies , where you know the rest of the members are not going to understand you ? 
  so you can speak catalan in a spanish chamber . 
  until you try to pass a law against a spanish law , just as it happens in every federal state where you can not make laws against federal laws . 
  believe me or not , the parliament of catalonia is a spanish chamber ( it is considered an institution of the spanish state by law ) and catalan language is spoken there . 
  wonderful brand new newspaper !, 
  did you read the part when i ask you to prove your points of view with academic papers ? 
  again , more bullshit . 
   you know what the war of succession was about right ?
