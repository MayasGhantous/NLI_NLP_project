  so even in times of economic crisis , we still have to protect our and * your * coasts and borders . 
  patroling the spanish border means patroling the eu border . 
  i do n't support such barbaric measures even if it 's against the isis . 
  are we nuts ?? 
  avoid cruzcampo though . 
  there are and there always been people that did n't feel spanish themselves , despite having spanish as their second or even first language , and sharing 80-90 % of the culture with the rest of spain . 
  those are not a majority most probably , but i still think a referendum ca n't do any damage . 
  quite the contrary : it will help ease the drama and it will probably help catalonia stay in spain instead of ripping a part of spain ( catalonia ) . 
  the result of that would n't be spain anymore . 
  well at least we are sure they ( or any other ) wo n't have absolute majority . 
  that 's a change at least . 
  probably not too much . 
  the people in spain is not just annoyed by the crisis and its management by first the psoe and then the pp . 
  they 're annoyed for many many other political reasons , the main one being corruption but there are more like not letting the catalans vote ( many of us non-catalan , non-independentists in spain think that they deserve to vote and letting them do it not only strenghts democracy but also make less people want catalonia to become independent because of the `` fuck spain , they 're from the past century '' thing ) . 
  no native sir but hey you tried to trick me :p, 
  look for `` trabalenguas '' :p, 
  nope none that i can think of . 
  but i know this one :  tres tristes tigres tragaban trigo en un trigal en tres tristes trastos . 
   en tres tristes trastos , tragaban trigo en un trigal , tres tristes tigres . 
  random sentence there . 
  how do you measure things that are supposed to be hidden for the state and every other ` researcher ' ? 
  i mean , people do n't go by telling how many hard drugs they bought , i think . 
  besides , `` black economy '' means literally untraceable economy . 
  i 'll keep my skepticism about this one . 
  except the consequences of very high unemployment is not general poverty but an increasing inequality and risk of increasing the crime rate and a staying in a potential revolution state . 
  the first is happening in spain . 
  not the second . 
  and 20 + % unemployment rate , if it were real , it would be pretty bad . 
  but it 's not , spain is still one of the safest countries among the rich and western countries . 
  that means it 's one of the safest * in the world * . 
  oh , and spain is a developed country according to , well , every political and economic organisation as well . 
  in order to read this , you have to understand that spain has a huge black economy , and many people are working in shitty conditions without a contract , at all . 
  otherwise no country would survive a 20 + % unemployment rate . 
  in spanish we call `` libra '' to the pound , so we 're totally fine with the crappy cursive l mwahaha . 
  tanto monta my friend !, 
  good lord . 
  that iberia gave me herpes . 
  unify it !,

  [ or the most retarded ] ( http://imgur.com/a/bfskq ) ... 
  honestly twitter is like the real world : it 's full of fucking idiots . 
  they key is to stress the s a bit less and then they wo n't insult your spanish edit : do you guys know what a joke is ? 
  okay i get it 's `` muh culture '' but , come on ... relax your anuses . 
  to be honest that 's the widest part where you can put the text . 
  have you ever played europa universalis ? 
  wow you really need your siesta do n't you . 
  lmao . 
  errr this has nothing to do with his nationality . 
  stop bringing that to the table because it really has nothing to do . 
  the guy did n't know who was franco at all but not just that : he did n't even know there was a dictatorship by his words . 
  i 'd say that yes , a big majority of young people in spain know who was salazar and probably all of them know that there was a dictatorship in portugal until the revoluci\u00f3n de los claveles ( that 's how we know here o 25 de abril ) . 
  i bet the same can be said about the portuguese regarding spain . 
  so yeah , nothing to do with nationality to be honest . 
  and if it has something to do , maybe it 's that he 's portuguese and that means might know a bit more spanish history than , say , a finnish . 
  but it 's not the case it seems lol . 
  also , `` professional '' footballers are far from that `` lower socio economical strata '' that they do n't know what 's about . 
  no , he really did n't know who was franco :  `` given the controversy over my shirt , i wanted to clarify that i acquired it a long time ago in portugal ** and never knew the impact this historical figure has to part of spanish society ** . 
    `` i lived in portugal and angola and ** i do n't know the bulk of spanish history ** , so was completely unaware of the significance of wearing that shirt in your country , '' he continued . 
    `` i want to apologize to all those who have felt offended or who have been shocked . 
  at no time have i have tried to make excuses for the ideologies professed by this person . 
  i do not have any political preferences . '', 
  i mean , there 's this stereotype that footballers are rather ... silly . 
  but , come on , lol . 
  also `` i do not have any political preferences '' this is the most retarded thing you can say . 
  everybody does , you just do n't want to talk about them . 
  but do n't ever say you do n't have any political options because saying so or thinking that way * is * already a political preference . 
  bullfighting is doomed and everybody in spain knows that . 
  the majority of us are just pushing to get rid of it sooner than later . 
  bear in mind there still are some that defend it and will probably wake some serious hate among the more radicalized , [ like the ones that made death threats against this mayor for asking not to subsidize the bulls-related parties in her town ] ( http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/2506080/0/alcaldesa-paiporta-valencia/amenazas-muerte-facebook/subvencion-toros/ ) . 
  this is probably older than the crown of aragon and the crown of castille . 
   bullfighting traces its roots to prehistoric bull worship and sacrifice in mesopotamia and the mediterranean region . 
  the first recorded bull fight may be the epic of gilgamesh , which describes a scene in which gilgamesh and enkidu fought and killed the bull of heaven ( `` the bull seemed indestructible , for hours they fought , till gilgamesh dancing in front of the bull , lured it with his tunic and bright weapons , and enkidu thrust his sword , deep into the bull 's neck , and killed it '' ) . 
  [ 6 ] bull leaping was portrayed in crete , and myths related to bulls throughout greece . 
  the killing of the sacred bull ( tauroctony ) is the essential central iconic act of mithras , which was commemorated in the mithraeum wherever roman soldiers were stationed . 
  the oldest representation of what seems to be a man facing a bull is on the celtiberian tombstone from clunia and the cave painting el toro de hachos , both found in spain . 
  ^ -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bullfighting#history, 
  thanks for the addition - that 's quite important indeed . 
  they ( pp ) do n't want expats to vote because they know what they will vote . 
  i mean , they do official press conferences to deny an information that came out in the news ... why is that not communist and bolivarian and totalitarian ? 
  it 's the fucking same . 
  that 's what estonians say . 
  and greenland , man . 
  do n't forget about greenland . 
  they will feel offended if you do n't include them . 
  oops , lo entend\u00ed mal :p do n't worry , there are no reasons to think we 're going to disintegrate .
