  also there are many latin americans in spain in the humble districts of the important cities and i think they 're fine mostly mixed and integrated with the spaniards . 
  yes from time to time there are band-related news of violence like ddp or \u00d1etas but that 's not the rule at least !, 
  same lol, 
  and [ mireia del monte ] ( http://fotos00.laopinioncoruna.es/fotos/noticias/318x200/2012-08-09_img_2012-08-02_01.46.39__8001933.jpg ) ( also famous from the sports scene ) is quite pale and blonde ... so what ? 
  do you think it 's very uncommon ? 
  and besides , what does it matter ? 
  did you know that in mexico there are also pale white people ? 
  because they have just european ascendency ( guess from where ... yes spain ) and they did n't mix with the natives . 
  ` hispanic ' is for the language , not the race . 
  this discussion is absurd anyway because it does n't really matter . 
  even if spaniards are white they 're not superior for that ... all humans are equal in that regard . 
  that 's because you 're assuming latin american is the bridge between both sides , or so it appears . 
  guess what : it 's the latin part , not the american one . 
  british are closer to europe than to america , and spain is closer to europe than to latin america . 
  that 's my point here and if you think spain is closer to latin america than british to america then you will have to explain why you 've got that bias . 
  the thing is that there are as many differences as similiarities ... some of the differences might be more about cultural-attachment to the `` western '' and because both countries are on-par with the gdp per capita of its neigbhours than to those in the other side of the atlantic , but those are still substantial differences that shape the image of the country . 
  for example the thing that 's going on in venezuela or mexico with the crime would be absolutely unthinkable in spain or portugal . 
  that 's where we are much more closer to the germanic countries than latin american ones . 
  you watch too many movies as / u/mong _ gei_ta said , and i add : you fail to realize that they 're shooting to scare , aiming downwards , as to not kill him in first place ... 
  i know by this kind of comments that you are not a police or have the slightest idea about their work . 
  a polish friend of mine sent me the link today and since i saw it was `` july '' i thought it was this year for some reason . 
  now i know it 's one year old :(, 
  what i 'm trying to say is that they ( whoever that is that ignorant ) mix spanish-speaker concept with ethnicity and nationality and even culture background , most prob . 
  are you a bot or what . 
  go away . 
  there are pale spaniards and more olive-skin ones , like in most mediterranean countries . 
  but there 's not only one shade of white color in spain , there are more than one , but [ the haplo-map is quite similar to the uk , ireland or the netherlands . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gll0m9y.png ) actually from that map spain looks the most `` western '' ( r1b ) to me . 
  whoever mixes spain and portugal with mexico or latin american countries deserves get bitten by an iberian lynx . 
  there , i said it . 
  well , this seemed interesting to me and a different analysis of what we 're used to see and read . 
  i know it might not be too popular but i still wanted to share it with / r/europe . 
  i mean , there 's a siesta culture , but not in the cities probably and it 's more attached to older people . 
  in the summer though ... siestas might be more common . 
  but in any case it 's nothing different from the rest of the world . 
  siesta means nap , literally it 's this word 's translation , and everybody has done it . 
  * facepalms *, 
  add a / s this is / r/europe after all . 
  literally [ 400 results in google ] ( https://www.google.es/?gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=tpe5vay0d6ip8wfxnj24dw&amp;gws_rd=ssl#q=%22san+cucufato+del+vall%c3%a9s%22 ) ... and a lot of them are about `` top\u00f3nimos en desuso '' . 
  compare that with [ 260,000 results of ensanche de barcelona ] ( https://www.google.es/?gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=mpe5vdodd6ip8wfxnj24dw&amp;gws_rd=ssl#q=%22ensanche+de+barcelona%22 ) . 
  people use it widely , i wonder what else you need to prove you wrong . 
  my point was that if you compare relative numbers spain 's gdp is improving at a faster rate - this is a fact , just like the absolute numbers that you posted . 
  also our chart shows a classic w because of the double recession . 
  but that was n't the point at all . 
  i guess you would agree with me that the way to do that is growing more than anyone else in europe . 
  things are still bad but i do n't think they can get worse growing 3 or 4 % anually . 
  more than the uk and way more than france or italy . 
  spain 's economy is big enough for an annual 4 % growth to matter though . 
  lol yes , historical revisionism is a classic among the most extreme independentists . 
  please stop with the bullfight bullshit when talking about economy or any other matter really ... it does n't represent us at all . 
  maybe if it 's about torturing animals then it should be there ... because it 's barbaric . 
  but stop linking it to spain because no one does it here . 
  it 's really far from our day-to-day life . 
  you did n't , but it is said https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ensanche+de+barcelona https://www.google.es/?gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=zns5vf2hf4gt8we7jqraaw&amp;gws_rd=ssl#q=%22ensanche+de+barcelona%22 http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/te-acuerdas/acuerdas-150-anos-del-ensanche-barcelona/620141/ it 's ok not to know everything , 
  yes but i mean that a 5 m earthquake is not even an important eartquake , it 's a light one . 
  but what you saw in the videos happen when the quake happens in a very shallow distance . 
  i 've felt a few 4/4 .5 m earthquakes in the interior of spain and they were * barely * noticeable . 
  why would no one fuck with russia ? 
  i 've heard it a lot of times . 
  of course franco had to appear . 
  you laugh but look what a 5 m earthquake can do in old european cities or towns that are not prepared for even a light quake : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_0e_ksb83a https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru1ucdsfucu https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orfpc_t4m7s this is all [ from lorca earthquake in 2011 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_lorca_earthquake ) . 
  but we all also remember the l'aquila earthquake in 2009 . 
  it is also said ensanche , in spanish . 
  although eixample is more common . 
  you 're the only one picturing yourself like a fool if you think you 've made a point . 
  a little nationalistic fool . 
  i did n't get it at first ... of course you 're right lol, 
  this is crap  how would you feel if your neighbouring country had absorbed you 300 years ago ? 
  and just a lie . 
  learn some history , and stop saying crap like `` the spaniards always speaking crap '' , ignorant . 
  where you from ? 
  damn it must be frigging awesome . 
  only a true galician could have explained it as perfectly as you did :p, 
  yes , i see , english can be tricky :p, 
  [ here ] ( http://www.citiesatnight.org/ ) you can find quite a few . 
  but only at night apparently !, 
  [ i love this photo ] ( http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/spain_portugalpsp.jpg ), 
  what do you mean cities like this ? 
  nothing wrong with getting lost in bcn though , 
  yeah i prefer that one but that 's because of my political views not because i like the color scheme :p, 
  haha , that 's weird !, 
  yes the referendum would be much more clear , maybe soon since it 's a time of deep political change in spain ... who knows what the future brings , not letting the people have a referendum is probably going to disappear at least . 
  and that itself might help reducing those % of independentists , who knows , it 's all theory . 
  and yes it might not be fair to add everyone to `` spain '' wearing the ikurri\u00f1a , but it may also be unfair to not count those that feel both basque and spanish ( some people might feel more basque and then spanish , or more spanish and then basque , but you get my point i think ) . 
  you guys need a super-ikurri\u00f1a in order to make clear `` we are not spain ! '', 
  like the catalan independentist flag , lol . 
  [ i think it might even exist ? 
  it was someone with a danish flair , but yeah . 
  also should have mentioned that , besides spanish , catalan does n't even have that sound iirc , lol, 
  i did n't say small . 
  i did n't say minority . 
  yes , 40 % or even 30 % is a huge number , although not a majority . 
  i said that most basques ( that 's a 50 +1 ) are not for the independence . 
  that 's what the euskobarometro shows , and that 's what i said . 
  i did n't say anything else regarding that . 
  and the second thing i said is that the basque flag is also the flag of those basques that do n't want to secede from spain and believe spain is also their country . 
  accept it or not but that 's how it is , just like most people outside of basque country accept that some people in their country do n't want to stay with them . 
  not a big deal for anyone i think . 
  no i 'm not basque but i have relatives and very close friends ( both independentist and just regionalists that think spain is also their country ) , so it 's still a part of me !, 
  you talked about a movement though .
