  my point is that * there 's * movement in that direction from certain people in both sides of the border , wether you want to ridiculize it or not is up to you . 
  i do n't even consider myself spaniard in the common fashion sense , but more like iberian which is the true meaning of `` hispania/spain '' , actually . 
  the fact that portugal is a different political entity does n't make it less iberian for me , it only makes me feel a bit more divided with my brothers . 
  ahh ... and all of this came from my original comment talking about union or fraternity ... jeez !, 
  / u/voatwasdown [ told you ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3f0e3f/barcelona_from_the_iss/ctk3ovy?context=10000 ) !!!, 
  hahahaha . 
  looks like you did , yep . 
  i made sure it was enough clickbait-y :p, 
  well i guess it 's easier to get lost at least :p, 
  what lisp ? 
  the sound / \u03b8 / is not a lisp . 
  would you say you have a lisp when saying ... 
  thanks bath month mouth theatre theme thin thing throw thumb earth math and so on and so for * th * ... 
  come on !, 
  i would n't totally dismiss having that in this same thread , soon . 
  so just hold on with me lol . 
  source : https://twitter.com/stationcdrkelly/status/625964921277300736, 
  be gentle pls, 
  what 's your whole point besides `` i do n't agree with you '' ? 
  saying `` this wo n't happen '' does n't make it true . 
  and if i say `` this will happen '' wo n't make it true either . 
  you 're just ranting over the internet because someone else has a differnet opinion of yours : congratulations . 
  i still believe in what i believe . 
  bye , nationalist friend . 
  another nationalistic sentiment triggered !, 
  damn if i knew this i would have bring my laptop so i could provide some links . 
  seriously though , that 's simply your personal opinion , it represents no one , gladfully , 
  so you say this lisbon based sociological institute and the salamanca university are wrong ? 
  could you provide something else rather than `` it just not accurate '' ? 
  wow i 'm sorry if this triggered some nationalistic sentiment on you ... 
  i did n't mean to , but i do n't think you represent anyone with all due respect . 
  oh and no it was n't made by a newspaper , but by the salamanca university with colaboration of a lisbon based sociological institute in a yearly report . 
  you can say you do n't trust it because of your own bias , but do n't lie please , thank you . 
  actually , 46 % of the portuguese are for the iberian reunification : http://www.europapress.es/internacional/noticia-crece-apoyo-union-espana-portugal-ambos-paises-20110405175125.html yours is simply one among many opinions , you do n't have to think you hold the truth . 
  far from it , 
  different points of view , the county of porto was indeed galician , besides the later iberian union . 
  galegoportugues was a thing . 
  it 's all a matter of fact that iberians share many common roots like the germanic peoples do , for example . 
  but i like it !, 
  the current flag of spain was adopted in 1978 , inspired in the 1785 naval flag of spain of carlos iii . 
  the coat of arms changed from the dictatorship , although * some * people still identify the current * color scheme * ( red , yellow , red ) with the francoist regime , even though this color scheme is centuries older than franco . 
  the more you know !, 
  well , if iberia is re-united someday , [ i 'd use this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wo0ukoj.jpg ) and if not ... [ i like the original flag of spain ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kauldj3.gif ) ( cruz de borgo\u00f1a ) that was changed in the ( iirc ) xvii century because most ships could n't differentiate it from the english flag and that was problematic . 
  but sadly it has fascist connotations because it was used by requet\u00e9s in the spanish civil war :( edit : well !, 
  looks like the iberian thing triggered some heat among some fellow iberians ... worry no more : it 's my own political opinion , you do n't need to contest it ... people think differently sometimes , crazy right ? 
  * sighs *, 
  well , yes , i 'm spanish speaker ... what does that have to do though ? 
  basques in spain do speak spanish so you really have no way of telling where i 'm from with that ... oh and yes , i 'm with you , there 's no referendum but there are polls . 
  those are not forbidden , and they show a minority support for independence . 
  it 's incredible to see downvotes in my previous comment though , because someone thought the basque flag only represent the independentists ... crazy , really , showing how little tolerance there is . 
  well , since the catalan independentist flag is the only symbol that 's trully a `` we 're not spain '' symbol , i 'd say that 's totally fine to have it separate it from `` spain '' , but to have separated the basque flag seems a bit off to me . 
  surely there are some basque independentists with it , but bear in mind not even a majority of basques want the independence , and they still get to wear the basque flag/flair if so they want , because it 's their land . 
  i 'd say catalan indep . 
  flair separated then the rest added to ` spain ' ( including 2nd spanish republic flag ) . 
  just my opinion , that 'd be the most coherent solution for me . 
  well , considering it takes the catalan independentist flair then it 's normal to see an independentist bias in there . 
  many ( other , non-independentist ) catalans might wear the spanish flag ( the current one or the second republic one ) , or maybe just the official catalan flag instead . 
  so their messages are n't counting for that matter ( they do , but they 're added to the spain overall ) . 
  only thing i do n't understand is why separate the basque flag then but not the ( official ) catalan , or galician or andalousian ... etc. 
  good spain & ireland \u2665, 
  shut up !, 
  you 're just around the corner !, 
  do you have kids ? 
  have you take them to a zoo ? 
  well congratulations , that 's worse ( for the animals ) than running with bulls . 
  all of this is quite hypocrite . 
  alright , thanks for the update then . 
  feel free to message the mods to label this as unconfirmed or whatever that 's needed . 
  are you serious ? 
  are you comparing running with bulls vs killing them slowly in a painful death that basically nobody enjoys but old dinosaurs and tourists ? 
  it 's two different worlds no matter how you put it . 
  madrid in the rockies ? 
  nice !, 
  no , it really does n't , but there was a debate wether if the spanish that hunted the lion was the king juan carlos ( he 's a fan of this shit ) . 
  that , and because if something with a wrong information gets to the frontpage , i think it 's fair if the correction also gets to the frontpage as well . 
  it does n't really matter wether it 's a spaniard or not . 
  yeah , well , fuck the spanish farmers until then , then . 
  i would n't have waited otherwise : obviously we should support the humble workers in their struggle . 
  but not this . 
  this is different , and i hope you do n't support this way . 
  are you aware they 're destroying other 's humble workers jobs and salaries this way ? 
  it just happen that they 're not french ... -_- if we have an union then we have an union . 
  i laugh when some say africa starts at the pyrenees ... well who 's doing this kind of third-world practices exactly ? 
  yes , yes . 
  they still do ... it 's just that it has not been happening as massively as it used to be . 
  but hell , they keep doing it of course . 
  yeah , best of luck to them , trying to improve their lifes by destroying their southern neighbour 's ones . 
  how reasonable and generous . 
  well , french farmers have always attacked spanish lorries in the border ... they were fans of assaulting and destroying all the fruit . 
  this has been a rule for the past 30-40 years , nothing new . 
  [ in the 90s there were several and serious boycotts against french products ] ( http://elpais.com/diario/1995/04/22/economia/798501629_850215.html ) , because they would n't stop assaulting spanish trucks . 
  the french government * then * did something . 
  but now france is doing nothing against this again afaik . 
  so people in spain will be angry again if it continues . 
  edit : and yes , [ they still do it ] ( http://cadenaser.com/ser/2011/08/12/economia/1313105956_850215.html ) . 
  my picks , by priority : - slovenia ( closest gdp per capita to spain of all of them ) - czech republic ( because seems very western to me , and atheistic ) - croatia ( a mix of everything plus the coast ), 
  yeah , thank you french farmers , looks like you have n't learned a thing from past years and the spanish boycotts ... might be the time to bring up another one i guess . 
  i based on this  the client , who is believed to have paid # 35,000 for the hunt , has not been identified . 
  there were reports on sunday that the person was spanish , but the zimbabwean hunter identified him to the telegraph as `` north american '' . 
  that may explain why the other news sources still have n't updated but the telegraph did .
