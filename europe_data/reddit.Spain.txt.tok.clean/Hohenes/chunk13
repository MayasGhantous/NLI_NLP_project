  in the local institutions ? 
  absolutely . 
  but that 's not only in spain , it happens in a lot of places in the west . 
  we are trying to get rid of that . 
  maybe 20 years ago noone gave a fuck but today is extremely different . 
  dw we were already, 
  might as well buy a brain, 
  you know , the lion-hunting game might stop now , but the spanish-hunting one never does !, 
  yay !, 
  yeah , to rescue your banks from collapsing like a flan . 
  hello . 
  i 'm the next guy . 
  surprised as well . 
  the hunter has been identified . 
  the original information was wrong . 
  it would be good if this reached the frontpage just like [ the original information ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3enrjb/spaniard_bribes_park_guides_in_zimbabwe_with/ ) reached it .

  bribes are just as common in spain than in the uk or sweden or any other ** western ** european country . 
  you wo n't be able to bribe the police , at all . 
  the political system is much more dirty though and it does n't quite represent how the spaniards are in their lifes for the most part . 
  i give you that , i have a very german mindset . 
  spain is zimbabwe now ? 
  til it would n't surprise me that someone from the north defended so in this subreddit though . 
  not really . 
  a half of spain is republican . 
  most psoe voters are , it 's their leaders that want the statu quo regarding the chief of state . 
  the new parties are more open to republicanism though . 
  ** spain ** - ** three spanish journalists disappeared in syria ** .

  many of your friends agree anyway . 
  so austria is western but not spain . 
  hahaha . 
  but really , nah . 
  many people ( like miguel urb\u00e1n ) from podemos have said that they do n't agree with what syriza is doing . 
  supporting syriza when things turn bad does n't mean you agree with everything they do every moment . 
  this is part of the new things that people in this country should understand ... 
  political parties are not soccer teams , you should n't support them unconditionally . 
  oh and critizing podemos because of what is syriza doing even when they do n't agree is simply bullshit . 
  this is unnecessarily stupid . 
  spain and greece are different countries with a different economic status . 
  spain is not at the edge of becoming a failed state ... not at least because of its debt . 
  comparing the situation that syriza faces in greece with the situation that podemos might face in spain is calling yourself an ignorant . 
  if we part from there , then there 's nothing much else to discuss about the syriza/podemos comparasions . 
  well , yes , that * they are commies , omfg , they gon na eat babies . 
  because people is stupid and they do n't know who cooked the figures ( new democracy - the greek partido popular , in case there are still any doubts ) . 
   also , what 's the plural of lynx ? 
  http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/lynx?q=lynx lynx or lynxes , both are accepted . 
  from this same article :  what is a lynx ? 
   * a medium-sized cat which lives in the wild  * there are four different species - eurasian , iberian , canada and bobcat  * the eurasian lynx is the biggest - about 60cm tall - roughly the same size as a labrador  * ** the iberian lynx is one of the rarest smaller wildcats in the world ** - mainly found in parts of spain and portugal, 
  not needed , iberia is already part of the eu and also provides funding to the eu and pays for the three greek bailouts as well . 
  the most iberian thing ca n't just die forever ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1232604/images/o-cachorro-lince-iberico-facebook.jpg ), 
  barbarians !!!!, 
  i have a polish friend that tells me dresy are like the british chavs or spanish canis ( they also wear ch\u00e1ndals aka dresy ) , and they tend to do all sort of things to annoy , screw , offend or beat people around . 
  some sort of hooligans but with even less reasons to be scum . 
  is that exaggerated then or it just depends where in poland you are ? 
  what about dresov ? 
  offensive , arrogant and with a pinch of superiority complex a bit , too . 
  til we were a wasteland with no civilization whatsoever until the guys from the north wanted an union with us too . 
  lol . 
  barbarian peoples these days !, 
  well , valencia or baleares do also share catalan language and culture but you do n't mention them . 
  why ? 
  because independentism is strong in catalonia ( and basque country but it 's not catalan ) and not much else . 
  although a strong independentism does n't mean catalonia is n't as part of spain as valencia or baleares are : they quite are with their differences and similarities , just like other iberian/spanish cultures like with the galicians or the castillians . 
  simple as that . 
  you only need one : delicious [ manchego ] ( http://www.gianteagle.com/productimages/product_node_116/99217.jpg ) . 
  sorry france , ca n't compete with that !, 
  yes , the old people of today \u00b4 s used to marry at 18-19 or so when younger . 
  right now that 's extremely rare , like in most other developed countries . 
  i do n't think that 's a coincidence , it 's the culture , rich way of life etc. 
  culture is a big part i 'm sure , since spanish gypsies still marry at 14-16 and start having kids when not even 18-19 . 
  at least a portion of them , since ethnicity does n't mean having the same culture in all cases . 
  i never said it was made for them but i understand why it has been lower for a long time now compared to other neighbouring countries . 
  `` normal '' spaniards do n't marry at the age of 13 , or 14 , or 15 not even 20 or 30 years ago . 
  it used to be younger but not as low as 13 yo . 
   i know you have taken this piece of information from the / r/worldnews then you clearly have no idea what you 're talking about because i do n't visit that subreddit * ever * at all . 
  it 's a coincidence that i live in an area where romani spaniards are majority so it happens that i actually know what i 'm talking about . 
  gypsies always married much younger than non-gypsies in spain as that 's been part of their culture for a long time . 
  this is simply a fact that i also happen to see on my every day life , wether you accept it or not it 's not my problem . 
  you 'd wonder why 'd you marry with 13 years old and suddenly realize spain has around 1m romani , one of their biggest communities in the world . 
  they do marry when very young - ethnic spaniards tend to do it at late 20s , early 30s on average . 
  industry : +60,800 jobs . 
  those are n't seasonal jobs nor summer-related . 
  the reason why unemployment fell so much is summer plus actually good employment figures . 
  edit : downvotes , lmfao . 
  surely some people find the reality to be a bit harsh for them . 
  no matter how many times you guys repeat it : it 's not going to be true . 
  - spain 's debt prior to the crisis : 35 % - spain 's debt today : 100 % what happened ? 
  unsunstainable goverment spending that raised the gdp to debt ratio from 35 % in 2008 to 100 % in 2015 ? 
  nationalization of private debt from the local banks that owed the german and french banks carried over to the public treasury . 
  this happened in both spain and greece . 
  i do n't know about the other peripheral economies , but i 'd say in portugal happened something very similar . 
  keep thinking it 's all about government spending if you 're happy with that tale , but do n't try to confuse the people with lies . 
   but we do n't need a second catholic wave yes , apparently you do n't , they 're already there .
