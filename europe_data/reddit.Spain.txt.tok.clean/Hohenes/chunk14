  you do n't need spaniards to get catholics . 
  [ belgium has already 75 % of its population identified as roman catholic ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/be.html ) . 
  obviously the reality is probably different , but so is in spain too . 
  so yeah , do n't talk from the rear just because . 
  well / u/modomario was , apparently . 
  because as he probably knows , spain ruled over there for a quite a while . 
  it 's history bud , no need to be salty about it , 
  not bombing boats lol . 
  the government proposed a `` european military or police force '' that would be located in the 2-3 places that have more immigrant/mafia movement and sink the empty boats ( breaking them or whatever ) . 
  no bombing was proposed . 
  suck it estonia !, 
  b-but with a condom ... 
  it 's 0.10 % ( or close ) , not 0.01 %, 
  yeah one can only hope in this case . 
  their families must be absolutely terrified . 
  i was ... 
  i was being sarcastic . 
  please note that telling you what 's my government proposing does n't mean i 'm supporting it , so do n't bash me for it if you disagree with me , but : [ spain pushes for un action against illegal immigration from libya ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/04/22/inenglish/1429690529_087570.html ) the government says the main problem are the mafias , and the solution have to do with not letting the mafias do their thing . 
  obviously sinking empty boats seems ... a controversial solution at least . 
  but do n't say spain is doing nothing or do n't care about this problem because we 're suffering it in our borders . 
  remember that the strait of gibraltar is only 16 km between mainland europe and mainland africa , and we have two ciudades aut\u00f3nomas bordering morocco ( ceuta and melilla ) , where [ things like this happen every week and almost every day ] ( http://img02.lavanguardia.com/2014/03/19/cientos-de-inmigrantes-pasaron_54403822461_54028874188_960_639.jpg ) . 
  yes , i think you 're wrong . 
  but spain should help italy in the central mediterranean too , because we 're the eu too . 
  and the eu * must * help spain as well . 
  because the asian or african countries do n't matter . 
  spain is as lonely in the ceuta and melilla borders as you are in the central mediterranean waters . 
  people in spain are annoyed like italians are because of the immigration problem ... so i would n't say `` nothing '' is what spain is doing today with its problems in ceuta and melilla , where the immigration centers are waaay beyond its capacity and resources are n't unlimited . 
  keep the sarcasm if you did n't know this , please . 
  that 's not indicative of anything , spain had 35 % debt ratio to gdp in ... ** 2008 ** now it 's at 98 % . 
  you have to look at other parameters . 
  * current * debt to gdp ratio is not an argument . 
   spain if someone told me we could swap catalonia for belgium i 'd say no : let them both be free . 
  changing whiny annoying separatists for more whiny annoying separatists ? 
  hell no , lol . 
  keep the land for yourself , i 'd rather live in peace . 
  but ... 
  i remember ... all the time :(, 
  i have a portuguese friend which i speak in the three languages with him , lol . 
  we speak in english most of the time but sometimes we just switch to spanish ( me ) and portuguese ( he ) and we just understand each other fine . 
  maybe not many spaniards would understand portuguese that easily though , because my case is special in the sense that i really like the real spain ( as in the union of the iberians ) so i 've been developing interest and knowledge over the years from both listening and reading in other iberian languages besides spanish ( catalan and portuguese above all ) . 
  so it might not be the best example . 
  why the downvotes ? 
  most stories there have no comments . 
  not even one . 
  how 's that debatable at all ? 
  go & check it instead of downvoting . 
  i totally approve this . 
  olivenza should be a good capital . 
  madrid , lisbon or barcelona are already good by themselves . 
  so you 're saying the voices of less people in austria are worth more than the voices of * far more * people in italy or spain . 
  and you think you 're being fair/not racist/not prejudging . 
  ok then . 
  ** spain ** * in july 18 , 1936 started the spanish civil war by a coup by the militars and commanded by franco . 
  two days ago , the 18th of july of 2015 , [ chants and vivas for franco and the fascist regime could be seen in this known church in a centric street of madrid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb7sfavjqek ) - a `` fascist motorcade '' was also caught in lucena ( southern spain ) , this same day , july 18 - [ video ] ( https://www.facebook.com/miguel.villaluque/videos/vb.1545512690/10204261950939353/?type=2&amp;theater ) ( warning : lower your volume a bit ) - chinese group buys ciudad real ` ghost ' airport for $ 10,000 . 
  the original cost was 450 million euros ( from private capital ) - [ english ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/07/17/inenglish/1437141343_057819.html ) - spain selling its two first space satellites to the canadian urthecast - [ spanish ] ( http://hemerotek.com/2015/07/17/venta-del-primer-satelite-privado-made-in-spain/ ) - [ new spanish senator from podemos is booed ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.es/2015/07/16/senador-podemos-pp_n_7808756.html?ncid=tweetlnkeshpmg00000001 ) by the partido popular senators ( right-wing , ruling party ) when he took the oath of office when he said `` i promise to put the institutions at the service of the people and restore the ability for the citizens to govern themselves '', 
  [ is this politically incorrect enough ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/moabafam.jpg ), 
  that 's much much better and still a title that has been carried away [ by every other major country in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sick_man_of_europe ) . 
  plus not even the so-called `` piigs '' are growing at the same rate nor share the same problems at the moment . 
  non-biased , objective great explanation . 
  thanks . 
  fuck you too , france . 
  you want to destroy the europeist sentiment in spain ? 
  because that 's how you destroy the europeist sentiment in spain if you ignore the 4th biggest economy in the euro and the 13th biggest economy * in the world * . 
   the best way to grow the canarian islander independency movement is to negate/ridicule it who is doing such a thing ? 
  they do exist , and noone is trying to make fun of them by pointing out they are a quite small minority ... catalonia 's independentist movement has between 35 % to 45 % support ( a big part of the population ) and saying it wo n't make you think i 'm trying to ridiculize them . 
  but it 's just another fact . 
  and i had no idea about a canarian independentists terrorist group . 
  i 'm not negating it : it 's simply first news to me . 
  it 's about the problems of the economies in those countries , government deficit , debt ( in the case of italy is much worse than , say , spain , but we 're still the s ) . 
  and we also lend 40 + billion to greece in total . 
  it 's not just italy that should n't be there , it 's all of them that should have never been added in an offensive and derogatory term . 
  `` peripheral economies '' is enough to refer to the more exposed economies to crisis of the capitalist system . 
  oh , and btw , there has been more bailed out banks , like in belgium , but of course they 're too close to the core to be called a pig . 
  or just not southerner enough . 
  fucking sick of this , how does one deal with those motherfuckers ? 
  - no ground invasion !, 
  because that would fuel their campaign - no videos/showing what are they doing !, 
  beacuse that would fuel their campaign - no acting like a human being !, 
  because that would fuel their campaign . 
  well then what the fuckings fucking fuck we do . 
  fuck you 're right . 
  damn , i have to admit my joke could have sound better in my head , but yours is a whole new level of passive-aggressiveness :p, 
  nope . 
  italy is in the original pack ( pigs ) . 
  the added i was because of ireland . 
  i still do n't support this way to refer to any country as it 's overly and unnecessary offensive . 
  source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pigs_ ( economics ), 
  i 've googled francesinhas . 
  omfg it 's so delicious, 
  what a score !, 
  far from hating us you even love us ... \u2665 it 's surprising considering how much hate i can feel sometimes or how they treat us with the stupid pigs acronyms and the like . 
  not complaining now though , just saying i 'm surprised !, 
  i have no idea of this canarian independentist movement . 
  must be like 4 people in total ? 
  catalonia and basque country is where is at . 
  galician is more minoritarian and more nationalist than independentist . 
  the rest of regionalist/exclusive regionalist movements are far too minor to be taken into consideration ( in relative % numbers ) . 
  i mean you can find castillians politically fightning for a castillian country again , but it 's anecdotical . 
  i ca n't give you a source but can speak personally because i have a swedish friend in norbotten and for example he has to pay for a quite expensive medicament that in spain it 's basically free ( free as in it 's covered by the public health system which is funded by spanish taxpayers , obviously ) .
