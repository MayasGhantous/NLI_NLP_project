  i 'm off . 
   obviously , do n't expect the wikipedia to be right about this topic , the invaders have been modifying history for 500 years yeah ... obviously , i bet that 's the reason . 
  for sure . 
  pesky castillians , invading the whole world just as to hide the absolute truth . 
  keep on with the tale , buddy . 
  absolutely !, 
  but it has even more to do with sea proximity . 
  portugal is a rectangle across the atlantic facade in the iberian peninsula . 
  the sea is known for having an impact in the temperatures by moderating/softening them . 
  but [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pamplona ) it says pamplona is the capital of navarre , not the basque country . 
  people might be confused by what you say , but the english wikipedia is actually right . 
  who are the spanish fascists ? 
  also , i thought the capital of the basque country was bilbao . 
  well , you know , spain gets snow very often , but we 're still not in the frigging north pole :p, 
  wtf lol, 
  madrid , in 2009 . 
  latest big snowfall ( there are snowfalls every year , but this one was the big last one ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz4ehckg9ya so yeah , stereotypes about spanish weather are just that , stereotypes . 
  we have four seasons , not just one :p and there is a lot of rain in spring/autumn . 
  yes , we 're in the middle of a heatwave ... 
  i 'm with the ac all day . 
  [ you 'd be suprised . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwn5opcfoa0 ) my friend !, 
  you 've got everything here . 
  of course . 
  have you seen where are we ? 
  we 're quite far from the equator , dear neighbour . 
  spain only has a semi-tropical climate in the canarias isles . 
  the rest of the country has atlantic ( north and north-west ) mediterranean ( east and south coast plus baleares ) and continentalized mediterranean ( basically most of the country ) . 
  this last one is present in most of the plateau , which covers a majority portion of the peninsula . 
  continentalized weather makes us suffer from both very hot temperatures in summer ( up to 42-43\u00bac ) and some quite interesting winters like [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elwbppvptno ) in a spanish town in the interior . 
  then you have the mountains which basically are everywhere and ranges from alpine climate to semi-arid badlands . 
  the peninsula is so fucking diverse . 
  and [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qkx3s0u.jpg ) is winter in the same region . 
  well , that 's some nice data you 've got there . 
  exactly . 
  this is like jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico . 
  do n't buy it outside of spain or portugal . 
  it 's not good . 
  but come to spain and try it . 
  there 's nothing better in the world , i promise you . 
  i do blame nd , but trust me , i do n't want to follow that game of blaming greeks anymore ... they 're already suffering much more than needed . 
  if they had to learn something from this crisis i think they probably did already . 
  and it 's insultating how the eu is reacting to this , trying to block imf reports as to not intoxicate their ` yes ' campaign in the referendum . 
  and much more ... 
  yeah screw those guys that brought greece to what is now ... oh wait , they did n't . 
  with eu 's approval they were lying and falsificating official documents regarding greece 's deficit . 
  that was n't syriza . 
  we * totally * did n't suspect that . 
  ~ ~ winter ~ ~ podemos is coming . 
  yes . 
  so what ? 
  do you know that debt ! = unemployment ? 
  i said  spain 's problem is not the debt though . 
  because it 's not . 
  unemployment is the spain 's problem , which is rapidly recovering , but that was n't the topic of discussion , rather than debt and bonds ... so no point there . 
  this is very very sad indeed ... :'( i really feel bad for them, 
  you are not being honest , and you edited your comment to make it look i was answering for a different reason [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3c112e/a_pensioner_sits_down_outside_a_greek_bank_and/csrvm3g ) , where you stated that it was the ( greek ) government word and that you did n't buy it . 
  that was before the edit to a non-sense comment lack of reason and any possible argument . 
  but you were lying , i told you so , and you edited your comment miserably . 
  you 're unhonest , so here ends our conversation . 
  touch\u00e9 !, 
  yeah , and we have to take your word instead . 
  sorry but nope , you clearly have a bias or at least not very open to criticism . 
  by the way , stop lying : * `` it was n't an easy decision , '' an imf source involved in the debate over publication said . 
  `` we are not living in an ivory tower here . 
  but the eu has to understand that not everything can be decided based on their own imperatives . 
  come on it 's lunch time ... ... leave the coffee for later :p, 
  ok , i might have been a bit too exaggerated . 
  it 's not the imf with malicious motives trying to make an influence in the greek referendum and the negotiations . 
  [ it 's the eurogroup ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/03/us-eurozone-greece-imf-iduskcn0pd20120150703 ) . 
  how absurd and unreal i am !, 
  honestly this is how you build up a proper atmosphere to go to war . 
  not even exaggerating . 
  people is still pro-europe , but that can switch swiftly if many northern europeans , in the right-wing especially , keep that attitude and rhetoric . 
   cyprus cooperated with the imf see , it even sounds like you 're cooperating with a gang . 
  `` cooperate and we wo n't hurt you !! '', 
  you keep your anger and your lack of arguments . 
  thank you very much . 
  [ no they 're not . 
  ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6a9466fa-5d2f-11e4-873e-00144feabdc0.html ) * spanish banks will not need to raise any new capital after comfortably meeting the requirements of the european central bank 's wide-reaching review of the european banking sector . 
  * * most spanish banks were comfortably above the 5.5 per cent tier one capital ratio in adverse conditions . 
  with the exception of liberbank , the capital ratio of all spanish banks tested was at least two percentage points higher than the 5.5 per cent threshold . 
  * * the country 's main banks greeted the results as further evidence of recovery . 
  * graphical bonus just for you : http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1414336069282/failed-banks-map-web.svg spanish system is doing better than belgium or austria 's . 
  yes , noone 's denying that ... that 's how the european debt crisis was held in 2012 for many european countries , allevieting the sense of spreading and contagious . 
  tomorrow we 'll see the next big chapter . 
  noone buys the government 's version of ` we saved spain in 2012 ' . 
  it was mario motherfucking draghi , lol . 
  spanish solvency did n't appear as a problem by its own but rather in the context of the [ european debt crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_debt_crisis ) , which was n't exclusive to spain , and it threatened to affect other countries like france or netherlands ( yes , beyond what some genious despectively and very unrespectful called ` the pigs ' ) . 
  also it had to do more with confidence than anything else , in the case of spain . 
  ~ ~ also i do n't understand the downvotes - you can disagree with my point of view from inside my own country , but it 's not a disagree button , durr . ~ ~, 
  spain 's problem is not the debt though . 
  it was the real estate bubble like in ireland or the us . 
  we 're not at the edge of anything and the country is growing @ 3 % / yearly, 
  i 'll be honest , i love winter and the snow and hate this weather we have so much ... which is terrible for me because , you know , spain is famous for it being like that for like 4-5 months a year : /, 
  pfft , you 're all newbies !, 
  [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/284nuxw.png ) is your normal summer here . 
  by the way that heatwave you are having is coming from the spanish plateau . 
  enjoy and taste what we have to deal with in the winters [ when you send us some polar winds ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elwbppvptno ) lol, 
  [ yes ... yes i do thank you very much .
