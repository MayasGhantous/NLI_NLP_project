  precisely ... olive oil is infinitely healthier . 
  did you even hear about the mediterranean diet ? 
  in any case you might refer to olives in particular , since you can use olive oil for basically everything . 
  i ( we ) use it for cooking , but also salads , for example . 
  it 's just how we cook here . 
  butter is x1000 times worse and unhealthy . 
   mayonaise from olive oil no wonder you ca n't have olives , germoney . 
  but seriously , that 's sick and it 's the fucking first time i 've heard it ... so it 's a thing you guys must be doing by yourselves . 
  it 's the second spanish republic flag . 
  imagine all the olive oil market ... the profits !, 
  gipsis, 
  lol, 
  we should found a club . 
  found , not fund , coz we ca n't . 
  [ extremely decentralized ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yjehc8b.jpg ) in most areas . 
  shuddup eastern europe representative !, 
  ^ ^ ^ yes , ^ ^ ^ spain ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ * also * ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ northern ^ ^ ^ africa ^ ^ ^ country , ^ ^ ^ from ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ geographic ^ ^ ^ point ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ view : ^ ^ ^ ie ^ ^ ^ ceuta , ^ ^ ^ melilla , ^ ^ ^ canarias . 
  yes . 
  spain is a western european country in all its possible meanings . 
  we are not . 
  it 's the government . 
  we will get rid of it right after summer , do n't worry . 
  spanish states ? 
  union ? 
  both are wrong : although spain is extremely decentralized , it still is not a federal country `` officially '' , nor it 's an union of states either . 
  could be earlier . 
  even esperanza aguirre ( pp ) is asking for earlier elections , making them match the catalan parlamentary elections next 27th of september . 
  it 's not so low . 
  it 's the color scheme that is misleading here . 
  uk and france are very close to each other but have different colors , making the uk look like it 's way worse ( it 's lower but not by a big margin ) the same could be said about italy and spain compared to france as well . 
  they 're both lower , but the difference is not big . 
  that makes sense, 
  did you austericied the commas ? 
  25b spain ? 
  i thought it was closer to 40b . 
  i never said that galicia was portuguese in any matter . 
  but many portuguese people [ do ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_portugal ) claim it . 
  why ? 
  maybe [ guernica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_guernica ) and [ barcelona ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_barcelona ) should or what ? 
  no , i 'm not serious . 
  i hope you really are n't , either . 
  no it does n't . 
  they do n't hide their claims in the northern spanish enclaves , including ceuta and melilla . 
  the canaries are just a bit harder to claim . 
  also , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perejil_island_crisis, 
  it 's just a joke , sort of like a popular joke here . 
  not really that important . 
  you can basically find something like that for every other region in spain , we really like to laugh of ourselves . 
  they are usually called `` marcianos '' ( martians ) instead of murcianos :p, 
  sold !, 
  * laughs evilly * adi\u00d3s , pringao !, 
  well , you sure you guys do n't want murcia though ? 
  come on , can become your clay , too . 
  just like olivenza did with spain hundreds of years ago . 
  holy shit the netherlands final form is scary . 
  that 's fucking monstrous lol, 
  many people in spain are fine with the current form . 
  there 's no revanchist nationalism in spain , even after centuries of expansionism across the globe . 
  most people would be pissed though if ceuta , melilla or the canarias were somehow annexed to morocco or something , as those are fully considered spanish clay . 
  but to think morocco can beat spain militarily is laughable . 
  edit : even though * most * people are fine with the current form , i have to say my own idea of an iberian country is not having two important countries and then andorra and gibraltar around ... 
  i 'm all for the full iberian unification , but that 's not a strong topic here . 
  it 's more common to hear about the balkanization of the biggest iberian union today ( spain ) than the contrary ( uniting the peninsula ) . 
  some people just want more borders , even between brothers . 
  i mean , if it 's only olivenza ... it 's a 10k little town ... we can even give you murcia in the pack . 
  murcia is awesome , trust me . 
  no earthquakes happen there , either . 
  madrid and new york share latitude but not climate at all . 
  the sentiment is the same with `` fuck '' . 
  it 's so flexible . 
  oh , i understand now . 
   4.2 % what does this mean ? 
  unemployment rate figures can go down from having 2 digits ? 
  not 100 % sure what are you trying to say , but it seems unfortunate in all of the possible cases . 
    * je m\u00e8ne secr\u00e8tement une carri\u00e8re de gigolo aupr\u00e8s de ta maman *  i secretly leads a gigolo career with your mom, 
  edit : actually ... never mind . 
  actually eventualmente in spanish is exactly what eventually means in english . 
  english + spanish speakers beat french + dutch + german ... lo siento !, 
  my point is that this bullfighter took a fucking selfie of himself smiling with the corpse of a bull that was killed by a police car in the road ... a deserved way to kill such a `` noble animal '' right ? 
  and this fucking idiot then did that . 
  such a dumbass , indeed . 
  come on ... even galician waters are ** extremely ** cold to me in august , lol . 
  i do n't give a damn about bullfightning defensors ideas . 
  if you 're against bullfightning why do you behave like bullfightning defensors ? 
  being happy for losing a life ca n't be civil . 
  i 've been demanding bullfightning abolishment for decades now , yet i do n't expect people that support it should die for that or something . 
  i really doubt that bulls are n't being drugged before that . 
  like , really really doubt it . 
  it might not be as bloody barbaric , but it still got my disapproval . 
  summer in norway ? 
  that water must be so cold  _ <, 
  what a roller coaster of tildes ... are you dizzy ? 
   they are taken good care of by their owners , who always try to make sure people respect them in festivities . 
  yeah , [ about that ] ( http://www.schnauzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/torero-sergio-blasco-se-hace-selfie-con-toro-muerto.jpg ) ... 
  i 'm all for banning bullfighting in the rest of spain ( ... and the rest of shit that was left in catalonia like correbous ) but saying you 're happy because someone died in this makes you no better than someone that wants to see a bull die out of joy and entertainment . 
  it 's disgusting and barbaric . 
  imo the best way to go about it is simply and straight banning it . 
  spain and portugal and mexico and wherever else . 
  as for spain - it does n't represent spaniards , not even a `` big minority '' or something like that . 
  public funding is the only way to keep this shit alive ... so they can kill the bull , oh the irony .
