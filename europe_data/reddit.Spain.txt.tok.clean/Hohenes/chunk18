  it 's not rare ... so i 'd say it 's fairly common . 
  i used it on coffe ( not anymore since i do n't drink it that much anymore ) . 
  it is sweetened and i did eat a bit of it with a spoon because it 's fucking delicious . 
  not sure honestly ... spanish is not a very hard language to pronounce having just a few vowel sounds and basically no exceptions in its pronounciation . 
  maybe names with a mix of strong r sound , z ( as in mon * th * ) and such are the hardest . 
  like `` ribagorza '' . 
  spain and italy going up means the eu will also grow stronger . 
  there 's nothing like a good ol' `` xdddddd '' when something 's fucking hilarious . 
  viva portugal !, 
  i love portugal for the same reason i love catalonia ( and would still love if they decide to split from the rest of spain ) : because we have so many things in common and they 're awesome when you visit them/their cities . 
  got ta love dem iberians, 
  well , i was speaking more about the economy , development , gdp per capita , hdi , life 's quality and expectancy and so on . 
  you meant pigs because of the term to refer to the most damaged economies in this crisis right ? 
  it was never true anyway and some `` pigs '' are already flying again ( * ) ( ireland and spain especially ) . 
  ( * ) i refer to this , that was the main article that popularized that pejorative term = http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/33022296/why-pigs-cant-fly, 
  still not baltic and fully western though . 
  no replies because it 's incontestable !, 
  it has been their thing , just not as much as you say . 
  they are trying to change it now though as far as i know . 
  there has been some corruption scandals in spain related with andorra 's banks , including the `` most honorable '' jordi pujol having his money there . 
  portugal \u2665, 
  so glad to see spanish teams winning !, 
  well madrid has a different climate ( less humidity , it 's closer to continental climate rather than mediterranean ) , so you might want to re-think that about barcelona ... it 's about the climate for sure , not a dirty place , 
  it 's not about the quality , it 's about the microorganisms that live in your digestive tract . 
  they 're used to `` your water '' and if you change that for other tap water that gets the water from a very different source ... you get different microorganisms in your own body that suddenly are incompatible with the previous . 
  hence why you can get diarrhea and similar problems . 
  tap water in spain is totally healthy and the water is always treated , just like in the rest of the western world . 
  people do n't usually suggest not to drink tap water when abroad because it 's not good water , but because it can mess up your digestive tract . 
  they are even for me , coming from the interior of the peninsula so ... 
  i totally understand you lol, 
  especially in the east ? 
  as others have stated , it 's about the climate . 
  that 's not a point . 
  that 's plain stupid and unwelcoming . 
  the more you have , the less willing to give to others you become . 
  seems like a pattern , although scotland might be an exception . 
  even then , the `` no '' was strong because of economic reasons and #bettertogether ... by the way , valencia and baleares are two regions in spain that have a worse fiscal deficit than catalonia and give much more ( in relative percentage ) to the other regions , yet there 's basically no independentism there . 
  but they 're not as rich . 
  just one more hint . 
  propaganda is strong and it comes from everywhere , yes . 
  it 's disgusting . 
  i do n't know if that 's how it works in the rest of europe but here is just disgusting to see how every political `` debate '' in tv can be resumed in `` communism is bad !, 
  look at the other 15 or 20 countries in history that tried it !, 
  it ended really bad ! '', 
  for example , instead of talking about the fucking country and people 's problems . 
  that 's the level today here . 
  and yes it 's time we get rid of corruption and the people that corrupt the politicians ... because politicians do n't become corrupted politicians all by themselves . 
  manos limpias [ is an organization related to the far right ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manos_limpias ) in spain and [ has been investigated ] ( http://www.europapress.es/nacional/noticia-ts-investiga-manos-limpias-abuso-procesal-querellarse-contra-jueces-asedio-parlament-20150217151010.html ) ( and later fined ) for `` abusing '' the justice . 
  here 's an updated story : '' [ public prosecutor from the supreme court does n't see any offence/crime with pablo iglesias and critizes manos limpias for not presenting proof ] ( http://noticias.lainformacion.com/espana/el-fiscal-del-supremo-no-ve-delito-en-pablo-iglesias-y-critica-a-manos-limpias-por-no-tener-pruebas_g5fj9q1uqxehteh9mbpd43/ ) '' there 's a lot of shit being thrown to podemos because , you know , they can win . 
  tell me how are you being caught in a political corruption scandal without having got any political power ever , at all . 
  the answer would be an obvious `` no , you ca n't be caught in a corruption scandal with no political power whatsoever '' . 
  upload all the ( economic ) statistic maps you want . 
  i do n't care . 
  i still pick this over anything northern than the alps or the pyrenees . 
  i guess it 's about priorities . 
  i think both the upcoming general elections in spain and podemos will stop that for now ... they 're shitting themselves . 
  yes !, 
  clearly made by a spanish as he 's a catalan friend of mine !, 
  how did you know :p, 
  who wants some whiskaaas !? 
  youuu little ~ ~ kittie ~ ~ volkswagen !, 
  yes it 's stupid , omg . 
  though [ sgae ] ( http://www.sgae.es/ ) here is not anything better ... 
   you could settle for a half-measure and call it western or central really because it does n't squarely fit in southern or northern europe . 
  yes i agree with the western part , but i do n't agree with the central argument . 
  i think prague or vienna are quite far from paris to just say france is central . 
  i think france is * both * southern and northern , being a bit more southern than northern , and definitely western ( and so is italy or spain ) . 
  france is a very helpful european connector ... as it connects germanic europe with latin europe ( being france a `` germanized '' latin country , just like spain or italy ) . 
  it 's like the transitional europe between germanic europe and latin europe and that 's awesome . 
  if you want to call that central ( because it `` connects '' those two europes ) then i could agree . 
  spain is * also * considered western europe as well as southern europe . 
  i do n't think france is considered northern europe extensively though . 
  i rather see france being part of southern europe ( from time to time ) more often than northern europe ( almost never ) . 
  lol france, 
  if france is northern europe we are central then ... huh ... 
  the fact that let you use vpn is what i presonally like the most . 
  also , nice little website ... :p, 
  but i do n't get why would it have a shit catalogue with 40 + million subscribers in us . 
  either catalogue is not shit or there 's some shady reason as of why so many people would subscribe to that service . 
  holy shit finally ... spain can into relevance once again . 
  catalogue will suck at first for sure though . 
  i 'm wondering how 's germany and france 's catalogue doing by now . 
  damn you !, 
   spain 's anti-austerity movement , the indignados , had little love for eu policies ( photo : tom.tziros ) that photo is absolute bullshit ... 
  i have yet to meet someone from the 15-m ( and i was there ) that would burn an eu flag . 
  it represents nothing but a retard burning a flag . 
  people do n't want to bring down the eu , they want to * change it * . 
  what a bullshit photograph . 
  retards, 
   anyway , it kinda makes sense , it was still the majority of the peninsula . 
  but if we ever unite we need to change the name to iberia  totally , and i 'm up for oliven\u00e7a / olivenza being the capital !, 
  hehehe . 
  portugal gained independence as duchy of oporto from galicia , not castilla . 
  also one could argue that portugal was not too different from the rest of the northern iberian ( aka `` spanish '' because spain/espa \u00f1a comes from hispania ) kingdoms . 
  not trying to say portugal is spain but we have our common history and roots , too . 
  spain is the the result of the union of different iberian peoples anyway . 
  only portugal is left and it still was a `` branch '' from galicia . 
  corbata in spanish ... til !, 
  the upcoming vote is the normal autonomic elections that happens in every single autonomous community in spain . 
  they elect their representatives in a regional parliament that make laws and approves budgets .
