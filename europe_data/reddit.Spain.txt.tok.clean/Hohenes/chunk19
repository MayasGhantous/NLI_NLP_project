  the difference is that the pro-independence parties ciu-erc-cup ( it 's different from pro-referendum parties , which are more ) are trying to reach agreements in terms of what the next steps will be to try and have a referendum about independence ... and that includes taking the what normal autonomic elections would be for any other autonomous comunity , and turn it into a `` independence yes or independence no '' issue , which is obviously not the purpose of the ** parliamentary ** elections , since it 's not even a referendum . 
  that 's the thing . 
  and yes it 's a clusterfuck , but not this ... spain is and has always been . 
  catalonia being part of what we call today spain is not the exception and it 's just another clusterfuck . 
  our national sport is killing ourselves every 100-150 years . 
  pro-independence parties ( ciu+erc+cup mainly ) . 
  icv moved a bit from that position lately so i would n't know , but icv is not pro-independence , more like pro-referendum ( like a big part of psc , which is federalist/unionist and podemos which is federalist too but both are pro-referendum ) . 
  the pro-referendum are a majority , that 's clear , even in the rest of spain there are a lot of people in favour because it will also make independentist lose traction . 
  and also you ca n't ignore ciutadans which is unionist and against the referendum that polls say they will become a big party in catalonia . 
  in any case it 's very clear that pro-independentists mobilize much more in elections that those who do n't support independence ... and this will be detrimental to the later in a supposed autonomic elections that just some parties agree it 's a referendum that will have different outcomes than the set and legal ones ... it 's simply not a far and democratic way of doing things . 
  people should know what are they voting for in every moment and what is their vote for ... and their vote is for an autonomic parliament , not to decide if they seceed from spain or not . 
  it 's very simple , and i 'm pro-referendum myself just because a lot of people want it , even if i 'd vote no . 
  all pro-independence parties are not all of catalonia , why would you hide the composition of your own society . 
  marginalizing people against independence is not a solution . 
  pretty sure not even a majority of catalans are pro-independence - again we do n't know - , only with an actual referendum that i do n't oppose ( mainly because if it were allowed the independentist movement would lose traction itself , since it feeds from pp 's position to ban everything ) . 
  it still does n't make it a referendum and potentially half the people ( and probably more because we do n't know ) wo n't see it like that ... because they do n't want independence . 
  the only way is an actual referendum . 
  and this is why i think pro-independence parties will most prob hit the ground too hard after 27-s when they see they ca n't secede even if they get a 50 +1 majority . 
  lots of people in catalonia will need more than just hopes if they want independence , they might even see themselves supporting parties like podemos in the general elections that at least wo n't say `` no '' to a possible referendum . 
  you ca n't assume everyone think like you and will accept all your conditions of how an election that 's supposed to work to reemplace a parliament you want it to declare independence . 
  it 's not democratic and it is very totalitarian . 
  an actual referendum referendum will be democratic . 
  you do n't get it . 
  people not thinking of an autonomic election as a referendum wo n't pick up sides because it 's not a referendum to them ... thus not participating in something that clearly affects them much more than a normal autonomic election . 
  and we both know that those people are the ones that would potentially oppose the secession ... considering not a single pro-independentist would stay in home the day you mobilize to show pro-independentism ... sounds redudant because it 's just logic and common sense . 
  and no . 
  [ even the dictionary ] ( http://www.wordreference.com/definicio/plebiscit ) says nothing about grabing the election for parliament and making a referendum out of it . 
  please provide a neutral source instead of just say no , because you 're completely wrong . 
  `` plebiscit '' is just another word for referendum , period . 
  i 'll quote it once again :  -- * our autonomical elections in the 27th of september have been pacted so that it acts as one *  -- no it has n't . 
  ** some ** parties have agreed that they want it like that . 
  that does n't make the autonomical elections act as a referendum . 
   our autonomical elections in the 27th of september have been pacted so that it acts as one no it has n't . 
  ** some ** parties have agreed that they want it like that . 
  ** that does n't make the autonomical elections act as a referendum ** . 
  not everyone , heck , not even a * majority * in catalonia against independence will think of the elections as a referendum ... because it 's not . 
  just a `` little '' detail that probably / u/the _ ape_man did n't know . 
  this is the same like when you say `` we want independence '' . 
  yes , * you * do . 
  not all catalans , though . 
  simple as that . 
  when the actual referendum arrives then it 'll be different . 
  you participate in a world cup because you are part of the world , not because you want a global government . 
  the same applies for the spanish tournament . 
  your logic seems a bit more fucked up and your manners are not anything better . 
  not usually . 
  but that 's also common among other non-independentist spaniards . 
  republicanism is strong . 
  honestly , football and politics is the worst kind of mix you can find . 
  it 's always the kind of mix where you can only find idiots and nothing else . 
  also for those saying the name of the tournament is a political one ... spain is a parliamentary monarchy , noshit the tournament 's name is about the country ... en fin . 
  this is the shit that we have to deal with everyday . 
  what about brain damage ? 
  42 minutes underwater and he 's back alive ... holy shit i thought this was not possible . 
  he 's not the eu . 
  not anymore since you `` participated '' it seems . 
  smoking in open spaces should be allowed too . 
  like , not allowed in very busy and commercial streets , or close to schools and hospitals , but should be allowed in open spaces , because people should still have that freedom . 
  i 'm an ex-smoker btw , and never touched a cig again . 
  same reason that of the other ~ 40 european countries left maybe ? 
  american debt/monetary policy : print more paper , they 'll eat it anyway . 
  it does n't matter that the dollar would be worth close to zero if the usa did n't have that military ... because they * have * that military . 
  no thanks i 'm full, 
  it 's because spain 's economy is big enough that tourism , despite topping the world ranks number wise , it 's simply not a lot of % relative to spain 's gdp . 
  `` that guy '' and `` that idiot '' was the president of the generalitat of catalonia for over 30 years . 
  and it has been found he was and is a corrupt involing quite a big quantities of money and comissions from public money . 
  we , spaniards , including catalans , are outraged of people like that , yes . 
  you 've got a nice list there . 
  i actually agree with everything . 
  so sad there 's still a strong anti-spanish/castilian circlejerk sometimes though . 
  imagine if it was against sweden or any other from the `` cool kids club '' . 
  zzzzzzzzz, 
   we have some of the highest home-ownership rates in the world , which obviously contributes to this graph . 
  same here . 
  it explains why portugal is higher than us with a much lower population . 
  and what 's the criteria for saying pp is nationalist but ump is not ? 
  this is juego de tronos right now . 
  so much fun . 
  if pp is `` spanish nationalist '' - which i think they are - then ump is `` french nationalist '' , too . 
  also podemos is not independentist but it is n't a spanish nationalist party either ( not so sure about using the `` unionist '' term is what i mean ) . 
  i do n't know why you are being downvoted . 
  it 's well known that a lot of `` italian '' - labeled olive oil is actually spanish . 
  this is not italian 's fault , they 're just making money by buying massively to southern spanish producers that just want to sell it fast and in big chunks . 
  the italians then sell it for a much higher margin to the rest of the world , and it 's them that get the good image from the ( spanish ) olive oil . 
  more or less the same happens with the wine . 
  nothing to blame to the italians , they 're doing it right ... it 's more about spanish producers not even risking a bit to win much more later . 
  this is quite typical here regarding the business mentality . 
  nooo !, 
  my oil !!, 
  this is stupid . 
  people is who decide . 
  not the economy . 
  democracy is above anything else . 
  and the rest is just your ideological point of view that i 'm not even discussing here . 
  people decide , even if they do poor economic choices ( from your point of view ) . 
  this is basic stuff . 
  i know , i know . 
  but at least you got ta ask for their reasons ... not a single party with power in spain is an anti-eu or anti-euro party . 
  that includes podemos . 
  how so ?
