  [ madrid world 's 5th most desirable city to work ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/20141007/madrid-worlds-5th-most-desirable-to-work-survey ), 
  there 's a bit of everything like in , literally everywhere . 
  please stop stigmatizing a whole country or their inhabitants . 
  thanks . 
  time will tell ... downvotes actually mean zero to me since i 'm expecting france to do ok economically since it 's our biggest client . 
  but as i said , time will tell ... hopefully you 're right . 
  i have my doubts though . 
  france will pass through the same that spain suffered by the looks of it . 
  good thing they do n't have a 25 % unemployment figure - although that 's because there 's a lot more black market of jobs here . 
  seeing the figures now and you can see how france is n't growing at all while spain has started to . 
  i do n't know why you are being downvoted . 
  this is absolutely right . 
  iberian ham is something that gets done right only in ... yeah , not the scandinavian peninsula , but the iberian . 
  it could be the weather , the pigs , the dehesas ... it 's indeed a number of factors that need to be combined for it to be sucessful . 
  and it 's what happens . 
  i just love [ churros with chocolate ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/churro ) ... my mouth is watering right now as i think about it xd edit : something as a proper food instead of snack i 'd say ... paella or [ spanish omelette ] ( http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/sites/bbcgoodfood.com/files/recipe_images/recipe-image-legacy-id--340634_11.jpg ) ( with onion please ... whoever says spanish omelette is best without onion becomes my enemy instantly ) xd, 
  probably but / u/sugusino is right , it might be castilla y le\u00f3n since people is not only very religious there but also very conservative . 
  i do n't think andaluc\u00eda is very conservative in that regard ( very very close to traditions maybe , but that 's not the definition of political conservadurism ) . 
  as in one federalized country or as in a confederalization of `` countries '' like switzerland is . 
  that 's not too relevant since that can be determined by all iberians via votings if we ever reach that point . 
  well , it kind of has for some of us that we actually find `` iberian '' as our national background rather than just `` castillian '' or `` catalan '' . 
  for me , being politcally `` spanish '' ( in reality it would be castillian in this case , but it could be basque , or galician , or catalan , or andalusian ) , i actually feel like i 'm just `` castillian '' then `` iberian '' ( which groups these other nationalities within iberia ) now here 's where i include portugal ... rather than just including it in `` spain '' . 
  in sort , i just think iberia is something we should be aiming for , and i 'm aware more portuguese people are aware of this than `` today 's '' spaniards , since they kind of ... well , ignored portugal since ever , like having a neighbour that you completely ignore and having someone to say `` well , at least we 're not portugal/we 're not in a worse position than portugal '' kind of thing . 
  i wish this changed . 
  i 'm sorry , and i know what you are talking about ( i 'm always been an iberist myself , my flag is not the spanish one but rather the colours of the portuguese + republican spain ) . 
  but i could n't answer a stupid comment with a non-stupid answer , so there 's that and i 'm sorry , 
  but we brought ebola with us to our continent for the first time in history . 
  take that !, 
  not really . 
  spain is the union of diverse kingdoms , you ca n't compare spain vs england , you need to compare similar subjects : castille vs england , aragon vs england , galicia vs scotland for example . 
  and in this case it would be spain vs uk , not england . 
  portugal is an independent country , not the case for scotland , so we ca n't compare it nowadays but culturally and historically it can and i 'd go as far as to say it must actually . 
  portugal is not `` part of '' spain because that 's politically incorrect ... but it is indeed within the same cultural/historical region group . 
  question is why would a portuguese would deny that ( if it 's not a nationalistic point of view ... it always manipulate everything ) . 
  we 've got a butthurt one right here lol . 
  take it easy and bring that towel to me , please . 
  ok , portugal is not * hispania * . 
  then what it is ? 
  iberia right ? 
  \u00ac \u00ac now seriously , obviously he 's not speaking about portugal being part of spain * politically * today ... it 's more like a cultural or historical thing . 
  if we are nitpicky we could say portugal was a secession from the kingdom of galicia due to the duchy of oporto and the nobels there ... so there 's that . 
  * sigh * ok , here , take your dorito and go away . 
  exactly and that 's the first time i see la guardia civil using that car specifically ... so spain in this case is completely wrong . 
  [ here 's what most people will see ] ( http://images.ookaboo.com/photo/m/c4_picasso_policia_01_m.jpg ), 
  thank you , there are so many cases ... it 's hard to count them all lol . 
  also i fixed the jordi 's pujol `` mandate '' of 8 years ... it was 23 . 
  my bad !, 
  ** spain ** , the corruption scandals far from ending are always evolving and getting worse . 
  the economy gets better but the laboral conditions are much worse than pre-crisis times . 
  * catalonia and the rest of the country is still receiving news about catalan ex-president jordi pujol 's hidden fortune . 
  there are hints that could lead to a big network of corruption , involving every contract that the generalitat of catalonia has done during jordi pujol 's presidency of 23 years .

  what about spain ? 
  any reasons to be that high ? 
  besides the roman empire latin thingy :p, 
  yes , i 'm sure they existed before in the nordic countries because we must remember spain was a fascist dictatorship till not so long ago ... ( 1975 , our constitution is only from 1979 ) . 
  so , yeah , i guess it 's not needed to remember but obviously that regime went against homosexuals and certain sectors in the society , either killing or imprisoning them . 
  so that 's why it 's so amazing to see how things can change for the good , in just 40 years , not just being a tolerant country but we can even `` compete '' ( also for the good ! ), 
  with the fellow nordic countries that are a model in any case . 
  thank you ... you two ... really ... 
  i think i forgot all my english now . 
  i more prefer this research ... http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/06/04/the-global-divide-on-homosexuality/ because it makes spain the 1st in the world of homosexuality tolerance and acceptance . 
  as a gay spaniard that makes me happy :p, 
   france has ubisoft i feel pity for them . 
   the economical turn around means people will return to the political status quo . 
  because that 's the only thing that has changed in spanish politics since the 15-m . you sure know your shit . 
  please do n't make me laugh . 
  end of story . 
  this is basically the whole thing . 
  just a friendly minor correction : it 's `` podemos '' ( * we can * ) , not pondemos . 
  so you count it as a yes ... well the reality is that it 's not a yes , sorry . 
  parties for independence do n't have a majority of votes . 
  i 'm sorry but that 's what the generalitat says right now . 
  http://resultats.parlament2015.cat/09au/dau09999cm_l4.htm it 's not like it was n't expected . 
  all polls said enough seats to form majority , but far from a majority of votes ... because it was a referendum-esque election right ? 
  you have to sum jxs\u00ed plus cup , but yes , they 're at ~ 47 % ... not gon na happen indeed . 
  oriol junqueras has just said that the ` yes ' has won in votes . 
  wtf ... there are more than 100,000 votes of difference that are not between the ` yes ' parties . 
  crazy outright lie . 
  it was at the bottom of all comments ... which means it got downvoted hard basically . 
  i was being sarcastic , of course we need to wait an hour or two still . 
  but this is not a poll anymore , and it looks like independentists are going down minute after minute ( ~ ~ 47,25 % ~ ~ 47,18 % and going deeper ) . 
  pro-independence parties are around 47-48 % now with 28.27 % of the votes counted ... so what do we do now ? 
  congratulate the catalans or it 's only ok if the nationalists win ? 
  haha , brave guy , 
  looks like an idiot and nothing else then . 
  not worth the time i see . 
  ... in a poll . 
  chill already and wait . 
  the only real answer and it 's getting downvoted lol . 
  meanwhile , people celebrating the catalan independence ... with no official results . 
   and the discussion with spaniards never leads anywhere .
