  i do n't get it . 
  both barcelona and madrid will most probably have two new mayors from independent candidatures supported by podemos-backed coalitions of different local and regional parties . 
  chances are [ manuela carmena ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manuela_carmena ) in madrid , and [ ada colau ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ada_colau ) in barcelona are going to be two important faces in the new political map that 's opening in spain . 
  a political map that is already very different from the usual two-party system that people in this country used to support . 
  and [ here ] ( http://7www.ecestaticos.com/imagestatic/clipping/cee/add/731/ceeadd731fb0e5c26db558ccc822fecc.jpg?mtime=1425996276 ) is the next mayor of madrid , that you can also find [ here ] ( http://images.eldiario.es/politica/ada-colau-manuela-carmena-democratica_ediima20150506_0553_17.jpg ) supporting the next mayor of barcelona . 
  good in the big cities , bad in the countryside . 
  and a newly dry and very cold galicia/spain because of no more gulf stream !, 
  this guy . 
  catalan is a co-official language of spain and official in catalonia . 
  i do n't see how the catalan culture or catalan languages are being treated in a bad way . 
  catalonia deserves what catalans want , just like the rest of spanish people . 
  and catalans already vote and voted for the constitution . 
  i 'm pretty sure catalans will also vote in future referendums and elections , including a constitutional referendum that would change the part of the constitution that says splitting the country is against the ( old ) constitution itself . 
  this is just the same argument over and over . 
  just getting a bit more nonsense considering independentism is losing traction very fast and independentist parties are no longer a majority in the polls by a margin . 
  keep downvoting freely now , pretty sure noone in madrid is going to ever tell you not to , lol . 
  do you think i do n't want to vote for another , more open and democratic constitution ? 
  heck i can even accept this one if we change a lot of things , but do n't assume i would stand by one side that you consider `` enemy '' , because you might be surprised . 
  3 from portugal , 5 from france , and i was surprised andorra did n't even appear , lol . 
  well , [ this ] ( http://www.msde.es/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/resultados-del-refer%c3%89ndum-constitucional-en-catalu%c3%91a.-1.jpg ) is how catalans voted the spanish constitution , which is that little paper that says you ca n't unilaterally secede from the rest of the country . 
  it was voted * favourably * , obviously . 
  maybe if you try to change that instead of violating the law just because you think are superior to the rest of citizens of the country might bring better results , both for catalans and the rest of spaniards . 
  but of course you can keep on going with your rant and keep spreading bullshit around instead , like if it was any different . 
  haalp , spain is opressing me . 
  i do n't understand it . 
  it was not a winner , but it was a top10 , heck even a top5 , by checking the odds and all opinions around . 
  seems quite disappointing . 
  yes , that 's better . 
  things are cool as shit still :p, 
  honestly i 'm very happy for this and i want to say congratulations ... but being the first to pass it through a referendum is not something special from my point of view . 
  my point is that a majority of people should n't be voting for a minority 's right ... which is the right to be equal . 
  that should included be in the pack of democracy , free of speech and human rights acceptance by the country that signs it . 
  i 'm really happy for ireland though , you 're most welcome to the club . 
  lmfao if you do this you are going to be at the hospital tonight, 
  well , my point is that you ca n't really compare unemployment in a rich , already developed country vs an emerging/still developing one . 
  a bad economic situation is not overcame the same in a country with 30,000 + usd as gdp per capita than other with ~ 7,000 ( balkanic ) or ~ 15,000 ( baltic ) . 
  it 's simply not the same . 
  and italy and spain belong to the western for more reasons than just geographic criteria . 
  i lived in both and i see little difference , aside from the conservadurism of one part vs the other . 
  stereotypes are exactly that , stereotypes . 
  it 's just a stereotype . 
  my answer would be the same as yours to the question `` do you think spanish people stop their work time to take a siesta ? '', 
  just stereotypes , do n't take it too seriously . 
  is a rather typical * stereotype * of spain . 
  like all stereotypes it 's vastly exaggerated . 
  the level of developement , hdi , gdp per capita and so on are ** very ** far from being similar . 
   saying things `` of course [ this thing ] is shitty , what else would you expect ? 
  this is [ country name ] '' is quite another . 
  this is the kind of phrases i was refering to , yes . 
   greece will be taken over by militant goats and yet they will solve the debt crisis . 
  by eating * all * the papers that say `` we own you moneis '' !, 
  i do n't think that 's the case , i have met a lot of british that like to talk really bad about their country , for example . 
  one could say that their view of their own country is worse than the actual image of it out of its borders , and this also happens with spain , italy , greece , portugal ... etc. 
  when i move around . 
  and it does n't feel right to mix spain and italy with the balkans or the baltic imho . 
  but that 's just me . 
  someone 's got ta be the exception so the rule can exist . 
  i 'm way more scared of isis than russia . 
  people say it 's crap , with shitty music and so on , and that you never win there because it 's put-up and the rest of europe hates spain and do n't vote for us ever . 
  those are the most common things . 
  i like it though and will watch it , but never voted . 
  honestly i think laughing about your own country and thinking noone else could do it `` worse '' than you is very latin overall ( or mediterranean , as to not ignore the greeks either ) . 
  the big exception are the french . 
  western europe still present it seems . 
  well , hopefully we can fix that tomorrow  edit : i do n't see portugal in the finale . 
  aww :'(, 
  and surprised to see portugal having france instead of spain as most points received . 
  please vote yes for dignity . 
  we are waiting to welcome you to the club . 
  i shall reclaim madrid being part of the blue banana !, 
  were those scottish flags the official flags of scotland ? 
  i think so ... [ separatist ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/estelada_blava.svg/1280px-estelada_blava.svg.png ) catalan flag is not [ the official flag of catalonia ] ( http://www.velabas.com/writing/wp-content/uploads/catalan-flag.jpg ) . 
  the catalan flag is official and it actually * needs * to be in public buildings . 
  you people need to be informed a bit better before positioning yourselves . 
  ignorance is the weapon that nationalists and independentists use to lie to gain traction . 
  ** you are lying , and you know it ** . 
  as i said in another comment :  * the title is simply wrong . 
  the electoral comission has said they ca n't be put on public buildings like ayuntamientos ... not simply `` banned separatist flags '' . 
  *  * the title is misleading as hell . 
  * keep spitting your bullshit around now . 
  the title is simply wrong . 
  the electoral comission has said they ca n't be put ** on public buildings ** like ayuntamientos ... not simply `` banned separatist flags '' . 
  the title is misleading as hell . 
   perhaps greece should privatize it 's social security and call it a bank , they will get a bailout then !, 
  right on the nail . 
  i 'm grabbing all the popcorn i can find for this sunday . 
  it 's sevilla in semana santa !, 
  fuck you . 
  ] ( http://slurmed.com/fanart/javier/176_zoid-earth-flag-fire.gif ), 
  yes , this is more hard to answer , because i do , but i 'm not that sure about the average spaniard . 
  still , the strong europeist sentiment is still there . 
  actually , spain is extremely europeist and pro-federation , despite being in a corner of the continent ( remember it 's more like europe 's main connection to the americas and also needs to talk a lot with morocco for many things , so people do n't feel very isolated ) . 
  bullshit is `` catalonia was a free nation 300 years ago and 1714 was the year when the castillians annexed us '' . 
  that 's the really bullshit story in this whole independentist bubble that you 've made up . 
  this , / r/europe , is the war that these ( some , not even all of them ) catalan independists claim it was an annexation war , a war about nations ... and nothing to do with heirs , dinasties or anything ... ** [ war of the spanish succession \\ ( 1701-1714 \\ ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_the_spanish_succession ) ** fun stuff . 
  yup . 
  crazy year that was . 
  1492 is an important date : not only the discovery of america , but also the end of the kingdom of granada and the union of spain itself . 
   iberia o_o, 
  1492 best year of my life .
