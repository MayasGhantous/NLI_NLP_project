  / r/eyebleach, 
  and what do you think about both the fact that that 's happening and that it 's not going to change ? 
  well it 's not fun , i would get killed in such a place if me or my husband happened to born there instead of spain . 
  my question is , do you think anything of this is going to change sometime in the future ? 
  i 'm not even talking about homosexual marriage ... 
  i 'm just talking about not killing a human person for the sole reason of loving another human person . 
  thanks . 
   you get to meet many people of different kinds except non-closeted homosexuals , i guess ? 
  it is , considering the kind of stuff they send lately ... :|, 
  happy 17th , * norway !, 
  ouch the butthurt ... come on , you can handle it , no need to * try * to ridiculize others in order to hide it . 
  it 's all ok . 
  madrid 's metro is 96 years old . 
  there are a few older metros than that i think . 
  [ collapsed like a flan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5udwvezzyk ) ? 
  portugal was left for no reason , because i always had the impression they mostly give us 10 or 12 points , when they participate . 
  it should be the iberian union !, 
  imagine if a german used the image of hitler like that , lol . 
  maybe it 's about how close in time it happened . 
  edit : wow , all of the butthurt . 
  woah woah ... let 's not get too crazy and leave the latin alphabet here ... !, 
  i do n't think you 're reading the correct data ... the [ link ] ( http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/import/show/all/0901/2013/ ) posted around here where belgium appears big leads to ** import ** of coffee . 
  not even exports . 
  if i 'm wrong you can always provide the data you saw , i 'm curious now .

  oil !, 
  oil !, 
  i like how you sink !, 
  they told you ... kurwa, 
  fixed lol, 
  i do n't want to be that guy , but run is an irregular verb ( remember , from school ? 
  :p ) so it 's said * ran instead of runed ( run - ran - run ) i keep improving my own english , not trying to sound pedantic . 
  maybe in some areas , but not all of them . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.foixblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/img_0127.jpg ) is also common , in the south and interior , including the summer . 
  but that 's my point , it 's not just the same yellow you see in sahara , in that map . 
  not a chance it 's the same . 
  there is a big plateau , but it 's [ not the sahara ] ( https://airpic.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/wamba1.jpg ) though like this relief map is trying to depict ... 
  the meseta central definitely does n't look like the sahara , indeed . 
  there are not even proper deserts in spain . 
  the peninsula is much more greener than what it looks here . 
  but it still looks nice overall . 
  that 's probably more popular but ... 
  i do n't think it 's very known that it 's related to finland which is what the title says . 
  * unemployment mixed with strong economic growth * old politics / new politics scheme , related to corruption and other issues * end of bipartidism , four main parties now ( podemos , pp , psoe , ciudadanos ) * local , autonomic and general elections all this year, 
  remove the spanish-portuguese border . 
  rosell\u00f3n / rosell\u00f3 back to spain . 
  poor northwestern/celtic spain :(, 
  i meant the eurozone . 
  actually , quoting myself  it is the fastest growing out of the 4 big * eurozone * countries by far . 
  spain is the 4th largest economy in eu and yet europe is growing `` because of france and italy '' . 
  lol , i do n't think so . 
  it is the fastest growing out of the 4 big eurozone countries by far . 
  in catalonia there is an important muslim population , yes . 
  but you should also say that you 're talking about relative numbers , not absolute numbers . 
  and even so , spain only has around 2 % of muslim population , compared to almost 8 % in france . 
  nope . 
  maybe it 's that . 
  it 's only nation-wide known . 
  i 'm starting to have shivers with all the non-stopping news about detained jihadists in my own country . 
  i do n't read that many from france or other neighbours with allegedly more muslim population . 
  that explains hungary but not spain which is not only a main entrance/route but also a rich country and is not even showing up . 
  lots of shit going on once you get into the interior parts of asia minor . 
  moderate/western turkey should try to fix that shit . 
  it did n't turn to be a disaster . 
  the energy sector in spain is . 
  renewable energy was n't the one to blame ... rather than the pp and the oposition that they made against it during the last psoe government with zapatero . 
  they actually made many people to think they were a problem and it that 's what had an impact . 
  renewables are not nor were a disaster . 
  yes . 
  that 's the pp for you . 
  and for everyone else . 
  now let the liberals and right-wingers keep wondering why podemos is a tsunami . 
  well that * should * be a must for everyone \u00ac \u00ac, 
  the region of valencia has been ruled by definitely not left-wingers . 
  [ partido popular ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/people%27s_party_%28spain%29 ) . 
  so i dunno what the hell are you talking about . 
  we have not enough ways to thank greece and/or italy from saving us from the first pos in ranks like these , lol but yeah , we are first mediterrabro !, 
  are they shiny because you also rub them with hair gel ? 
  if it 's mediterranean , it 's beautiful . 
  ** very ** far from reality . 
  yes !, 
  fuck different opinions than mine . 
  before or after the kamikazes appear ? 
  i 'm still trying to decipher `` esquecerei '' . 
  basque is also spoken in france , and catalan is spoken both in france and italy aswell . 
  so the matter is not just about spanish policy . 
  i think that the eu changing its policy makes much more sense than having catalan or basque being an official language of , say , extremadura ... and by the way , basque and catalan are also spoken in more countries than spain : ie france and italy . 
  why do you only mention spain ? 
  of course because france is such a non-centralized state that care about its regional languages ... / s edit : just [ a little bonus ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2bj8dq/catalan_and_the_official_european_union_languages/cj5zdf5 ) . 
  i know , but there are huge actual deserts there , quite the contrary if we talk about spain . 
  it 's not even an arid country . 
   many of the classic westerns of the 1960s were set in texas and mexico , and filmed ~ ~ in spain ~ ~ * in a very particular area of spain called [ desierto de tabernas ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/desierto_de_tabernas ) , the only true desert in europe . 
  * but really , spain is not desertic . 
  it has four seasons and even the south does n't look `` yellow-ish '' if it 's not summer ( or close to it ) like / u/mistshinobi says . 
  well the thing going on in barceloneta is quite annoying i 'd say . 
  it 's so depressing to be in that position being the 13th biggest economy in the world . 
  shit needs fixing . 
  i like this comment being at top for its content but also the fact that has no national/regional flair . 
  today is time for the eu flag , so there we go !, 
  it 's glorious !,
