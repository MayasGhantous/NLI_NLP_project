  i can only think it 's the ignorance of not knowing that ceuta and melilla were part of spain way before morocco even existed . 
  your point is that they belong to morocco because it 's in africa and not in europe ? 
  that hardly makes sense . 
  youtube comments are youtube comments . 
  they are like that in every single language/country . 
  it 's the general feeling though , and you ca n't say `` sudaca '' or `` panchito '' is a word only heard of in youtube comments . 
  it 's ok to dislike an accent though , that 's * still * not racist as of 2015 . 
  castilian spanish does n't have any weird lisp . 
  the ` c ' / ` z ' sound that sounds to you like a lisp is only used in those letters , and not extended to the s or any other of that kind . 
  and the `` lisp '' is exactly the same that you use when you say `` month '' , `` throw '' or `` mouth '' . 
  so if we are lispy then you are , too !, 
  yes that 's an internet classic in the spanish-speaking sphere lol, 
  * we are not lazy , quite the contrary . 
  * we are not partying all day . 
  *  90 % of us hate bullfighting as much as you do . 
  * we do not take siestas more than you do and we do n't stop the day and our work to take them , that 's because of our horrible timezone . 
  * we are not religious . 
  it 's about the tradition for most people . 
  lots of people can follow the most known catholic tradition celebrations being atheist or agnostic , just because `` it 's pretty '' and it 's socially acceptable . 
  * and we are one of the most decentralized countries in the world , without being an actual federal state , though it 's asymmetrical . 
  * most of us do n't give a flying fuck about the ownership of gibraltar , but it 's annoying having a tax heaven micronation right in the backyard that want to make you feel like you own them the world and scream at you when you defend your waters from their incursions . 
  * there 's indeed a bit of disrespect against the old colonies and are seen them usually as inferior . 
  latinamerican spanish is also usually disliked , though i 've seen the sentiment is mutual between latinamericans towards spaniards/europeans . 
  that 's self-reported . 
  am\u00e9rica is europe 's child . 
  who cares if eu or them are better anyway . 
  we made them , people !, 
  sadly , most young people probably wo n't even know about what is [ this ] ( https://marisolroman.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/velacc81zquez_-_de_breda_o_las_lanzas_museo_del_prado_1634-35.jpg ) . 
  if that 's not clue enough , then no , people do n't even care about gibraltar and stuff like that , despite what the news and the uk and spain 's respective governments wanted to tell you . 
  gib breda back pls and do n't remove paella, 
  you should probably add that that 's very rare and barcelona 's homicide rate is probably among the lowest in the world , like in the rest of spain aswell . 
  despite that terrible thing that happened to your friend and his brother . 
  spaniards are also light haired btw , just not as much proportion . 
  but that 's something they probably ignore , like many many other things . 
  so , precisely , your point is ... ? 
  this does n't make britain more xenophobic . 
  it 's just dumb idiots being dumb , and xenophobic . 
  i wished other people , especially in the uk , understood that and stopped saying spain is super-racist for this same reason . 
  it 's not . 
  spain is the mecca of * casual racism * , but that 's because we are not ocd about speaking of nationalities or the skin in our language , nothing else . 
  for example , we do n't have a `` n word '' , we only have `` negro '' for instance , and it 's not a bad word . 
  and yes we use to describe people , beacuse you know , it 's part of the appareance . 
  that 's why spanish language in spain is not so ocd for this like in other places . 
  it 's more offensive for me as a spaniard to have another european tell me spain is very racist than this particular attack from some dumbs in york . 
  such beard , hnnngg . 
  because they do n't even aknowledge the existence of other nations ? 
  franco did n't simply `` came to power '' . 
  that 's the problem with revisionism . 
  that it leads to say stupid things like `` franco came to power '' instead of `` franco did a coup supported by militars and fascists '' . 
  and the church , by the way . 
  the coup failed and that leaded to the civil war . 
  the regime of the second republic was n't a dictatorship nor a communist regime , despite what far-right revisionists want to say . 
  people downvoting this need their head get checked . 
  it 's like downvoting a `` hitler was bad '' comment . 
  it 's a fact . 
  downvotes wo n't change it . 
  deal with it , franquistas de paco-tilla . 
  comparing spain with mexico and its people it 's like comparing france with algeria and its people . 
  spain is comparable with france or italy and their cultures , not with south american countries , despite the hispanic heritage . 
  there are over a million brits in spain . 
  most of them are retirees living in the coast , that 's why unemployment figures do n't matter . 
  and as of ...  think about the number of brits that speak spanish . 
  has another explaination : brits retirees in spain like to form ghettos , immersed in their own language and do n't ever talk to spaniards . 
  they have their own places and they are serviced in english exclusively . 
  they 're just that nice . 
  most interesting : spain most boring : spain * -- signed : [ las dos espa\u00f1as ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_two_spains ) . 
  this comment is not helping either to keep up the good ambience though . 
  wtf what is it with the cuban-controlled spain lol, 
  [ we ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/04/06/article-2126101-127e09cf000005dc-311_634x415.jpg ) [ have ] ( http://m.cdn.blog.hu/ke/ketszersult/image/semana-santa.jpg ) [ many ] ( http://blogs.iesabroad.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/englert.salamanca.cordoba.jpg ) [ colors ] ( http://www.pizzapazza.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/semana-santa.jpg ), 
  people like selfies . 
  even if they do n't appear in the photo itself . 
  feliz semana santa . 
  for spain would be l\u00e5zy in norwegian ? 
  actually , siesta is in danger of extinction in spain . 
  [ some people have started to do something in order to avoid the extinction of this custom ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2010/world/europe/10/15/spain.siesta.championship/?hpt=c1 ) . 
  but i think that dude is high as hell , lol . 
  but is he a member of the police or an admiral ? 
  of course lazy . 
  working more hours than norwegians , but yes totally lazy !, 
  just do n't let the germans command it . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ too ^ ^ ^ ^ soon ? 
  here we 've got 21\u00ba and it 's sunny . 
  it 's closer to 30\u00ba in the south and the mediterranean coast . 
  you can come visit us this spring and leave your germoney here !, 
  we deliver best experience for tourists 11/10 . 
  also mallorca is not for sale , but we do rent ibiza . 
  yes . 
  the main reason could be the welfare system functioning in most eu countries today . 
  human health is not something to use as a currency to trade with . 
  that 's something that has been done right in europe . 
  other reasons are also very obvious . 
  quality of life and life expectancy . 
  the low figures of homicide rates and/or criminal rates overall . 
  the culture , and weather itself ( at least in this side of the continent ) . 
  one developed area in the world with good gdp per capita ( something that we need to push from and beyond western europe ) . 
  and there are quite more reasons frankly . 
  the big chunk of the world 's population is in asia . 
  but who would change europe for india or china ? 
  sadly that 's how it works . 
  that only proves catalans speak spanish more often and that 's it .
