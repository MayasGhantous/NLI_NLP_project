  it 's not the trigger for independentists . 
  it 's not sad , it 's their language aswell ... 
  it 's called bilinguism . 
  shut up germoney and gib more ducats . 
  back to siesta , brb . 
  go back to the shithole you come from aka / r/european here we try to discuss serious stuff like this one . 
  that actually sounds exactly like the situation of spain 's job market right prior to the growth of the unemployment . 
  i think you took too seriously the `` cool '' country joke . 
  remainings of chauvinism ? 
  i do n't think we 're talking about the same here . 
  i 'm talking about current-day spain . 
  and the idea of a united spain ( hispania ) comes from many , many centuries ago . 
  can the uk revert to being england ? 
  answer would be no , because the uk is not england , the uk is england + scotland + wales + northern ireland ( + cornwall , for those that recognise them ) . 
  spain is also like the uk , a nation of nations and different countries , the union of many iberian cultures that are kind of similar to each other ( the basques are our little exception but they 're still iberians geographically and speak castillian which happened to be the language of union between the different nations , but it could have been aragonese , galician , catalan , asturleonese or basque itself ) . 
  do n't worry , / u/aleixasv likes to end discussions like that , no matter where you come from and what you have to say . 
  spain formed in 1714 ... lol . 
  i know it 's used in american ? 
  english mostly for titles . 
  unfortunately that does n't stop it from giving me eye cancer . 
  yes , you 're right . 
  i was exagerating in my last sentence :p, 
  crying about downvotes is what nets you a downvote . 
  that 's my experience throughout all subreddits , no matter what . 
  for the contrary , i 've got downvotes for just saying the contrary of what an independentist think , in this subreddit , but i never complained nor i 'm going to start doing it now . 
  but i have to say i always read you complaining about downvotes in this kind of threads ... it 's always you , for some reason . 
  surely every downvoter has to be an evil castillian . 
  yes , among them more than half the population of catalonia that feel spanish in some degree . 
  did you know spanish is the first language used in catalonia ? 
  catalan comes after . 
  some people actually believe that the people that post in this subreddit represent the political reality of catalonia and the catalans ? 
  nor me . 
  where did you get that from ? 
  feel free to quote me . 
  '' ** i , myself , as an independentist ** , do n't care about spanish constitution . '', 
  ftfy . 
  catalonia is not you . 
  gladfully, 
  why would he be in that side of the war . 
  there were people fightning and dying for democracy and the republic all over the country , not just catalonia . 
  you independentists have some dellusional view of the reality that most people just simply ca n't eat it . 
  capitalizing like this should be illegal in every language , in every country . 
  yes , that 's what it means . 
  but it 's a bit fancy so it sounds sarcastic , too . 
  lol . 
  i spent 30 seconds thinking because i was n't catching your comment , just because i never thought of `` cabeza de turco '' refering to actual turcos . 
  we have another one which is `` no te hagas el sueco '' ( something like ... `` do n't act like a swedish '' ) , but it has nothing to do with swedes , lol . 
   rajoy effectively banned abortion again . 
  you should check the ( past ) news again . 
  that was thrown away because even their voters were against the law . 
  thus the resignation of ex-minister of justice , gallard\u00f3n . 
  seriously , how can you ignore that ? 
  just no . 
  stop with the stereotype of catholics = more socially conservative than super-duper-awesome northern protestants . 
  i mean , i 'm an atheist , but spain is very catholic and was one of the first countries in approving homosexual marriage with a big support from the population ( +75 -80 % ) , beating the untouchable \u2122 ones aka nordics . 
  and ireland is about to do the same soon iirc . 
  stereotypes suck and do not represent the reality . 
  no , alexander olof gustav , i came first !, 
  says the guy that it 's in no doubt well-informed about the spanish empire and falls in the same simplistic ( and false ) argument that people that believes the black legend fall . 
  it 's not that simplistic , and the spanish also fought throughout all europe and won most wars against the french and the english until the 1600 . 
  yet this is the most passive agressive comment i 've read in this thread :  wow you killed and enslaved people with the help of apocalypse diseases much impress so do n't know who are you talking about now . 
  is that you ? 
  except preveza was before lepanto , which was the battle that started the decline of kebab . 
  the actual day [ is not any better ] ( https://www.google.es/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:esp:ita:fra&amp;hl=es&amp;dl=es#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:esp:tur&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=es&amp;dl=es&amp;ind=false ) . 
  i 'm so sorry . 
  ah the good ol' [ black legend ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_legend ) . 
  do n't be so mad for lepanto , bro !, 
  shit happens . 
  c-can i kiss the man in military uniform too , pretty please ? 
  [ bitch please ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/spanish_empire.png ) . 
  * woosh *, 
  of course , that 's before french , too . 
  i 'm sorry if i do n't speak french , but i rather prefer to learn languages that are spoken by far more people and countries , and thus are more useful , like english . 
  or spanish . 
  have n't you seen all the videos of crazy 30-40 + year old british women bitching and being utterly racist in a metro or bus ? 
  they 're everywhere ... 
  i mean the videos , lol . 
  i like all my ( european ) neighbours . 
  yes !, 
  fuck you portugal !, 
  we did it !, 
  edit : france . 
  ouch . 
  edit2 : poland stronk ... it really surprised me !, 
  spanish/castillian , english and attempting at esperanto . 
  i speak only spanish ( and english obviously ) , and i can understand up to 90 % or more of catalan spoken , and 95 + % written . 
  i can even say basic things . 
  some people do n't have it that easy though so when in the national-wide news appear someone speaking in catalan they usually put subtitles in castillian . 
  but i 'd say most castillian-speakers are totally capable of understanding catalan-speakers . 
  another thing would be if they want or are open to it . 
  actually , [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lbd8p1c.jpg ) says otherwise . 
  and [ this ] ( http://www.ayuntamientodeolivenza.com/ ) is the official website of olivenza . 
  say what you want . 
  i still prefer to be in spain than the other 80 % of the world . 
  there are much better places than spain , i 'm sure . 
  but there are way more worse places than the better ones . 
  you can stress that , too . 
  do n't be silly , we can talk about olivenza . 
  exactly . 
  that 's why this post makes no sense and op is basically raging at everything .
