  he could have spoken about the problems that spain will have to face ( like unemployment in the long term , the territorial one , or the lack of resources ) , but he prefered to pick the clickbait titles of irrelevant news that will be forgotten when hopefully the current party ruler gets kicked out of government . 
  he 's probably just a bit young . 
  it 's the end of the ~ ~ woooooorld ~ ~ spaaaaiiin !, 
  but yeah , nope . 
  if you pick spain why not galicia instead of catalonia ? 
  [ yup ] ( http://www.elotrolado.net/noticia_movistar-triplicara-la-velocidad-de-su-fibra-y-llegara-a-los-300-megas_26154 ) , for free or for almost nothing ( 3 or 5 $ more iirc ), 
  i totally did n't know that . 
  til . 
  in spain it 's 2 kisses . 
  nothing less , nothing more . 
  if you do one kiss or more than two you must be one among millions , literally . 
  fucking yes . 
  and fuck the cavernary animals trying to shoot it down . 
  that graph will probably change soon considering the biggest isp in spain will triplicate the speed connection of its ftth 100/10 users for free ( making it 300/30 ) , and switch over from adsl to ftth the rest aswell . 
  i 've got ftth very recently ( ~ 1-2 years ) in a big city like madrid , so i 'd guess it 's changing fast . 
  it was about goddamn time . 
  did you watch it ? 
  i did . 
  it lasted 5 minutes . 
  literally . 
  there were no questions . 
  the journalists waiting for hours could n't ask a single question . 
  i still think that if they arrange to do a press conference then let it be a. . . well , a freaking press conference . 
  spain claims otherwise . 
  that 's why it 's em disputa , right ? 
  lol, 
  the press conference was only made to suck each other 's cock ( yes , including angela 's ) i 'm sorry , but that 's what it looked like . 
  they did n't add any information , they could 've just leave that to the bea , which was providing lots of information in that precise moment , in paris . 
  thank you very very much to the residents of the area involved in the crash for the help and the french for investing their money and personnel effort in this , but fuck that press conference , seriously . 
  we do n't need that to feel more united as europeans , i already feel it . 
  we should have pulled this before the italians . 
  they 're gon na steal us millions of tourists now !, 
  yup . 
  spain is [ at it ] ( http://ep01.epimg.net/politica/imagenes/2014/12/28/actualidad/1419791095_360167_1419853928_sumario_normal.png ) , too . 
  yes , i think it 's pretty clear , and i would say portugal kept a slightly higher gdp per capita throughout the 40s and even the 50s , and it was n't until the 50-60s that the spanish economy recovered and started to grow big industries . 
  you said it three times now , i 'm not denying it . 
  i 'll try it again : how and why ? 
  i 'm asking for something else than `` just because '' . 
  i 'm curious about what portugal did to be richer than us , if it ever did . 
  probably the north of portugal has or had been , than the rest of galicia , perhaps . 
  but that 's a vague idea ... just like saying we were richer without adding anything else , like data , a source , or whatever . 
  yes , they do n't say numbers , but they are confirming there were many spaniards in the plane apparently . 
  civil war made spain poorer indeed . 
  but how it was a poorer country `` somehow '' ? 
  the impression is quite the opposite throughout the history , including recent times . 
  not trying to offend , just pointing out a fact . 
  like portuguese people speak more english than spanish people do , that 's another fact . 
  why not ? 
  well , yes , but you know , we are not expecting to be in economic trouble forever ... the euro is viable in the long-term , at least for spain . 
  gdp per capita has been growing in the last 15 years , not otherwise . 
  they are awesome indeed ... that 's the reason why every city in the world is a bilbao suburb . 
  just one more reason to love spain 's diversity of cultures . 
  and languages , too . 
  he said : ** [ in my region , we like chopping things ] ( http://i.imgur.com/npi6dmz.jpg ) **, 
  here , take mallorca < 3, 
  you guys love to depict us as a non-cool-kid of the club ( tm ) but then you really love coming here for the nice weather , food , party , beaches , and services offered eh ? 
  well we could n't offer the good services if we were n't part of the cool club !, 
  there , i said it . 
  wow , this is huge . 
  cervantes is one of the biggies . 
  lol , k. 
  [ castile ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/castile_%28historical_region%29 ) , but i do know a bit of catalan and half my family is from and lives in barcelona . 
  who is `` they '' ? 
  all catalans and basques ? 
  i do n't think that 's correct . 
  more like independentist catalans ( which are not necesarily a majority of the total catalan population , by the way ) are not content with being part of spain . 
  the same goes for basques ( where polls suggests only around 1 in 3 supports independence , that 's far from being a majority ) . 
  so let 's not start assuming what we read on the internet ( and this subreddit in particular ) is what everybody thinks . 
  if , say , 80 % of catalans wanted independence , they would have already gained long time ago . 
  catalonia is so diverse as its climate and geography : a big chunk ( 55-65 % ) of the population feel spanish , too . 
  and to answer you question ... 
  i tell you the same : it 's about what each person thinks . 
  the idea of an iberian union is not very ~ ~ popular ~ ~ known , but i 'd guess it could please many federalists in spain overall ( including catalonia , where there are quite a few ) . 
  i 'm a republican federalist myself . 
  well you may not know what is it because it 's a political entity that does n't exist . 
  it 's the hypothetical federalization of the current iberian states ( spain , andorra , portugal ) to form a larger entity within the eu . 
  including the iberian nations within them ( catalonia , galicia , castile , basque country etc. ), 
  sorta like the swiss confederation ( except it 's not in the eu , of course ) .

  and [ even more ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/iberismo ) ( spanish ) . 
  wifi ? 
  ugh , it sucks . 
  my ftth gives me the lowest latency possible , with the highest bandwidth possible , with no emi and rfi interferences possible . 
  but thanks . 
  oh you ... do n't be [ obtuse ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j_wvki8iodo/ujikrygor4i/aaaaaaaaaty/f2aoeypni0y/s1600/stop_being_obtuse_copy.png ) . 
  more like ... cabrones hijos de la gran puta, 
  do it or no eu !, 
  exactly , while germany or austria is above ... 
  i just do n't think this map is right at all . 
  sevilla , m\u00e1laga and other parts of andaluc\u00eda would be also affected . 
  but in any case maybe it 's not `` most '' of the population as / u/sambri said ... but it 's a big chunk indeed . 
  spain = galician ( 2m ? 
  people ) , basque ( ~ 2m people ) , catalan ( ~ 9m people ) + castillian ( all the 47m ) , and you say the average spaniard speak less languages than say , austrians or germans ? 
  we are not even counting english here , which is bad in spain , but the other iberian languages should add the difference by ... a lot . 
  sorry but i do n't think i can believe this map . 
  i love the climatic and geographic diversity of spain because of this , compared to the boring flatlands that can be found in many other parts of the continent . 
  i 'd say italy is like spain in that regard , too . 
  we even have wolves , bears and stuff that you would only expect for a nordic country/russia . 
  the key is on diversity guise !, 
  madrid is probably one of the highest capital in europe , and the highest if we do n't count microstates ( sorry bern ! ),
