  this is starting to be a regular thing ... 
  maybe you think this country would be better ruled by the same people that rule a bloody theocracy in the middle of the desert ? 
  i think we can leave the `` marca espa\u00f1a '' stuff for threads that are related to them . 
  spain is just another western european country with its own problems , like any other western european country . 
  let 's try to preserve the western european country part , at least . 
   eta was obviously the most likely perpetrator , since spain had n't had a bombing from anyone else in a very long time , but barely a week later some people were all convinced that it was obviously some islamist group , and even denied ever thinking otherwise ... that is the power of media during uncertain times . 
  this is not how things happened : people were not just convinced , there were evidences . 
  if it was for the media the people would be thinking it was eta still now because of el mundo 's conspiracy ... that by the way costed their jobs and even life to some honest policemen that were accused of manipulation . 
  it was a shame and the vast majority is ashamed of this ... do n't try to put it like the society was divided : today there 's no division , the only ones worried about it are the pro conspirationists , that are a irrelevant minority among the right . 
  stop intoxicating , it 's disgusting . 
  yes . 
  that 's the  they acted accordingly . 
  part . 
  in spain the prime minister is known as presidente del gobierno ( president of the government ) . 
  but yes , s/he 's theorically `` prime minister '' , since we are a parlamentary monarchy . 
  because for them if it was eta = they win elections . 
  if it was islamists = they lose elections . 
  yes , that was their equation . 
  and they acted accordingly . 
  because iraq . 
  because ceuta . 
  because melilla . 
  because some islamic radicals get their ass wet when they think in al-\u00c1ndalus . 
  and most importantly : `` just because '' . 
  i 'm from madrid so this touched me really hard . 
  i was 12 when it happened and i remember i could n't stop watching the tv those 3 days up until the general elections . 
  i do n't remember any other moment in my life like this one , it 's so unique - sadly . 
  memory to all the victims . 
  i hope that not only spain but also europe and the world do n't forget them . 
  a lot of people in spain is against americans being in europe ** at all ** ( they have got some military bases in spain ) while others just do n't care . 
  anti-americanism is sometimes strong in this country , though . 
  especially coming from the left and liberal sectors , the conservatives and the so-called socialdemocrats of the psoe ( socio-liberals more like ) seem to be fine with them .

  basque people : fuck you . 
  fuck you all . 
  xd i love it . 
  ah well , thanks , i see now . 
  i swear my comment was not meant to be islamophobic , or racist or anything like that though !, 
  works for spain too tbh . 
  i do n't quite follow that subreddit . 
  i do n't usually read about world news in reddit ( except for maybe european news , in here ) . 
  i do n't understand this circlejerk . 
  so may i ask what is exactly wrong with that subreddit in particular ? 
  wow . 
  constantinople is incredible !, 
  it was a joke . 
  everybody knows siesta time is for something else than taking a siesta . 
  i want a map with % of people in europe taking siestas in each country ... 
  i could predict many surprises . 
  we 'll need to start having some respect for the siesta time if we want more integration !, 
  it would destroy my coast and my tourists \u0ca0_\u0ca0 our coasts is our oil , man . 
  lots , lots of oil . 
  what 's with the downvotes in this thread ? 
  here , have an upvote everyone . 
  the fuck is wrong with the idiots tonight, 
  i wish it [ looked like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/newmkr5.png ) . 
  it would have been so much fun . 
  hell no . 
  i can only speak for my country but ... this year [ spain 's entry ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnjrk1v8lxg ) is not in english . 
  [ the last one was ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-otum3zvkeo ) , though . 
  partially , at least . 
  [ la alhambra ] ( http://www.tropicopter.es/media/cms_page_media/21/la%20alhambrab.jpg ) frotress . 
  it was also where the kings of the granada kingdom lived ( the moor kingdom , so it 's quite old ) . 
  you did n't have to !, 
  thank you , dear friend , 
  there are maaany many variants of `` me cago en ... '' . 
  that includes the one you 're mentioning , yes . 
  although it 's not very common in my context ( i hear more * me cago en la leche * alone , which is actually a short , more fancy version of * me cago en la leche que te han dado * ), 
   there 's legal immigrants , and illegal immigrants . 
  what 's an immigrant then ? 
  a thing ? 
   but they 're here illegally that 's why `` undocumented migrant '' is not an euphemism . 
  `` illegal immigrant '' is not telling you that `` some humans did n't fulfill the legal requirements to cross a human-made border '' , if you take it literally . 
  hence why it 's not really an euphemism . 
  undocumented is exactly what you are refering to . 
  people is not illegal wether you or / u/santiago _ matamoros agree or not . 
  so for you there 's actually * illegal people * / a human person can be * illegal * . 
  well , at least you did n't hide it at all . 
  good for you . 
  you think it 's an euphemism to avoid describing a person as `` illegal '' ? 
  in spain we 're really into pooping over * every * kind of thing : - me cago en la leche ( * i shit on the milk * ) : it 's like a variant `` damn it ! '', 
  - me cago en tus muertos ( * i take a shit on your dead relatives * ) : this one is self-explanatory ... means literally what it means . 
  - me cago en dios ( * i shit on god * ) : stronger version of * i shit in the milk * / me cago en la leche . 
  - me cago en la hostia ( '' * i shit on the [ communion host ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sacramental_bread ) * '' ) well , i guess they still make sense in english ... at least the literal part . 
  i was being sarcastic . 
  i knew . 
  i read a lot about catalonia . 
  it 's part of my country so it 's in the top of my priorities when reading news about , well , my country . 
  the sarcastic part was because you mentioned the biggest corruption case in the whole history of catalonia . 
  i think pujol deserves that , to be honest . 
  i 'd hit it !, 
   by the way , did you know that this same mayor is now in prison for the biggest corruption case in the whole catalonia ? 
  pujol is in prison ? 
  :o i * totally * did n't see that coming . 
  yes , but you tried to point out that the catalan flag is exclusive to the idea or the political idea of spain , which is just wrong . 
  that 's why i said that you probably meant the catalan ** independentist ** flag , which is what the redditor was wearing . 
  fuck it , let 's just unite . 
  olivenza/oliven \u00e7a for capital nao, 
  lol if that help us being a bit more close to each other sure thing . 
  i wish i could sign it right now .
