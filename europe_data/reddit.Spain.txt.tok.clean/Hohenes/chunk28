  sadly the love is not answered by many spaniards , sorry guys :(, 
  no , i used the term as opposed to the [ real economy term ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy#range ) . 
  there 's something we call the real economy , as opposed to the financial economy . 
  call it intangible if you prefer , for the sake of the saltyness and to accompany the downvotes , but it 's pretty basic stuff . 
  and also a fact . 
   the city of london is the centre of the world 's most shady ( non-real aka financial ) economic activities . 
  do n't worry mate , i fixed that for you . 
  * ... said the french , using the global language of communication , on the internet , an inter-connected international borderless tool *, 
  how salty they are lol . 
  fuck you too i guess, 
  no it 's not , it 's an objective fact : she 's not part of the royal family , but i never said that means the actual royal family has less stuff to explain ... 
  not part of the royal family anymore , but she was . 
  it 's the aunt of the current king , she was part of the royal family when her brother ( juan carlos i ) was in office . 
  not even the investigated princess cristina is part of the royal family officially . 
  inequality is high because high gdp per capita does n't mean it 's well distributed , it 's an average and it 's biased . 
  they have the richest guys ... and many many poor people . 
  it 's better to be poor in europe than to be poor in the us , where by the way if you are poor it 's your fault because you 're a `` loser '' . 
  that 's a shitty mindset that 's simply true in the 0,1 % of the cases . 
  that 's one crappy clich\u00e9 that i do n't think it stands true . 
  the spanish one is so small compared to others from the other big nations :o, 
  that comes back from the english occupation of menorca i bet !, 
  april 1st means nothing here . 
  it 's the 28th of dec for us . 
  ... so i 'll enjoy this day singing the ussr anthem all day long . 
  the sun : `` exclusive '' something that is being in literally every other frontpage . 
  i do n't envy brits for having to deal with such pain of `` newspaper '' . 
  pasta pastosa literally means that in spanish lol, 
  the best it 's the reason given to vote for blas de lezo . 
  he was one of the best sailors in the world and made great contributions to the british ** undersea research ** . 
  also known as forumcars : broken2 :, 
  sure sure ... just a conservative party ... they 're not populist ... at all ... 1 . 
  the [ no more vat campaign ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qfjvtxn.jpg ) when it was obvious we could n't cut taxes off . 
  then when you get to the government what do you do ? 
  automatically raise all kind of taxes , including vat . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clmsjiztbty ) not populist , at all . 
  absolutely not populist mate !, 
  they not populist . 
  they just happen to be there , in a moment of electoral campaign and well ... that 's the thing they do on a daily basis ... just do n't mind the photos being taken for the public . 
  again not populist ofc . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9i0bt2l.jpg ) bonus track : [ do n't forget about our minister of interior awarding a medal to the virgin mary ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jxyo2bi.jpg ) . 
  i know , pathetic ... 
  i hope they do n't notice in europe about this because they will fucking expel us !, 
  partido popular is the most bullshit populist party in spain . 
  so cut your own bullshit . 
  seat is no longer spanish though afaik . 
  [ yes , it is true , historically italy has been closer to spain than to france ] ( http://i.imgur.com/od9w5hz.png ) . 
  the point you refer ( early 90s ) is the exception . 
  and even then , gdp per capita of italy was 20k usd , vs 40k in 2008 ( highest peak right before the meltdown ) . 
  and even then , italy was a the same distance from france than from spain , which was the exception at that time . 
  so ... cut the bullshit . 
  italy is not in any higher league , only in your mind . 
  that 's not really the case , italy 's gdp per capita has always been closer to the spanish than to the french or german . 
  if anything , italy and spain are in the same league , not different ones . 
  unless you , for some reason , want to put an arbitrary line somewhere between italy and spain , just to feel better about your own country . 
  but be reminded that 's not objectively true though . 
  boa sorte :p, 
  i can only conclude you consider or considered spain inferior , if you see the data we have been running a similar gdp per capita for so long , even if it 's only now when the numbers are dancing more than usual . 
  the fact that we were behind does n't mean we were so far away . 
  and this change does n't mean italy will be inferior and super behind either . 
  it will be similar , like spain has been , and still be grouped within the new zealand-south korea-spain-italy group in terms of adjusted gdp per capita . 
  usually if you group germany-france-uk-spain , you include italy too , or germany-france-uk-italy . 
  because it makes no sense excluding spain if you add italy to the list ( or viceversa ) . 
  the only important difference is population-wise ( 60m vs 47m ), 
  oh , i missunderstood the chart that you can see in the original site . 
  in any case , that 's forecast for this year , yes . 
  but i doubt it will change considering the * current * ( not forecasted ) growth of both countries . 
  partido popular is the biggest populist party in spain and it has been for longer , but i guess you already counted them when you said `` the nationalist parties '' . 
  we have nothing to teach the italians about political instability though . 
  this data shows that the gdp per capita has already been surpassed . 
  there is indeed a forecast , but this is 2015 data . 
  i did n't say we need more workers . 
  we need more young people . 
  we 've never been as educated as we are now in spain , and the kind of workers we 're exporting are not low-skilled . 
  that 's not good for us either , we need the best people right now so we do n't lag behind like we used to do while the rest of western europe was progressing . 
  actually i would like more romanians and polish ( and other europeans ) coming to spain like they were doing before the crisis , once unemployment move to more reasonable levels . 
  we really need an influx of young people , as we are turning to be one of the oldest countries out there , and while being a very good symptom of developed , high quality of life , and life expectancy , that 's too a problem for the welfare system over all , and the pensions in particular . 
  the thing is we 're growing at 3.9 % with 20 % unemployment rate ( we were 26 % , though ) . 
  it 's crazy . 
  google translate did all the work [ here ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.expansion.com%2feconomia%2f2016%2f03%2f25%2f56e16ed922601d9c238b457e.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) the average wealth per inhabitant in spain this year will reach 36,650 dollars , compared with $ 36,430 in italy , according to imf data . 
  the statistical rivalry between spain and italy this year will mark a historic turning point : the gross domestic product ( gdp ) per capita spanish closed 2016 above the first italian since 1980 , splitting exercise statistics of the international monetary fund . 
  or , what it is the same : spain exceed the transalpine country one of the main indicators of measuring wealth . 
  the calculation is made on purchasing power parity , thus correcting the distortions caused by exchange rates and different price levels of each country . 
  furthermore , it will not be a single event , since the distance will be extended to 2020 , the last year for which compiles statistics imf . 
  specifically , in 2017 the per capita spanish gdp will be 2.1 % higher than italy , which then will lower a position in the ranking , to be kept there in 27 . 
  2018 , year in which spain will rise another position to establish itself as vigesimocuarta economy in terms of gdp per capita , 3.6 % higher than italian . 
  in 2019 , the spanish income and be above 4.9 % and in 2020 , 6.2 % . 
  in that period , the population variation is substantially similar in both economies . 
  45c is rare . 
  it 's called reading . 
  yes , it is , and the only thing i added was that despite not knowing him i wished he rested in peace . 
  the rest are comments like you paying attention to the detail that i did n't know him ( aka did n't hear about him because you probably did n't know him either ) and answering over and over again . 
  if i cared about the downvotes i would n't have answered and i would have deleted the first comment in first place , so you can keep em . 
  this all started because i said '' [ rip ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4bre3f/johan_cruyff_dutch_football_legend_dies_at_the/d1chebb?context=10000 ) '' . 
  i would agree with you if i did n't know who cristiano ronaldo is , for example , but it 's not the case . 
  i 'm well over 20 . 
  some people just ca n't accept that we are not a copy of each other . 
  their mind is about to explode i tell ya . 
  i do n't think so . 
  i know cristiano ronaldo or messi because of the reason you say . 
  and i could recognize the others most known players , because it 's impossible not to know unless i lived in a bubble .
