  but even with knowing all of this , i did n't know who johan cruyff was . 
  if that 's worth the downvotes i could n't give more fucks about it though . 
  yes , i pay zero attention to football . 
  i had no idea who this man was , but rip . 
  yes , it was called `` our 9/11 '' , and it was , essentially . 
  although we did n't get any `` je suis madrid/yo soy madrid '' from the rest of europe that i can remember , it was still a nightmare and i totally remember that day . 
  some [ footage ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izzxtwstblu ) ca n't be forgotten . 
  maybe it has something to do with victims per capita or something . 
  norway is high because of breivik . 
  on the other hand , eta , while still an active terrorist organization , no longer kills people , for now . 
  and yet we are very threatened by yihadists , up to the french level ... so it 's a matter of time that something happens in ceuta , melilla or [ madrid ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/atentados_del_11_de_marzo_de_2004 ) ... 
   however , the minister of justice resigned in january because she did n't agree with the current politics . 
  who would have thought there was one socialist in the french socialist government . 
  same for spain and terrorism , sadly . 
  yes , fucking thanks france for that . 
   because no one has ever been asked . 
  but i guess you know better . 
  no , you really do , because you seem to know every basque out there . 
  you really are entertaining to listen to ... but just the first 5 minutes . 
  it gets old really fast . 
   the euskobarometro data nobody knows where it comes from http://www.ehu.eus/es/web/euskobarometro/home https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euskobar%c3%b3metro, 
  no , [ you are ] ( http://www.elcorreo.com/bizkaia/politica/201507/24/vascos-quiere-independencia-segun-20150724113736.html ) . 
   you are confusing spanish that live in the basque country and basques wow . 
  just wow . 
  believe it or not , even if you do n't , the basques do feel spanish in different degrees . 
  suggesting that those that feel spanish are not true basques makes you something really , really bad . 
  you are the one that 's confusing spanish with castillian . 
  the basques are n't castillians , but they definitely are spanish , and only 30 % want the independence according to your own public institutions ( opinion polls from them in this case ) . 
  deal with it , racist . 
  i feel no shame for saying what i think even if it contradicts what i 'm supposed to think for being a leftie and voting podemos . 
  some that think like you are just too biased ( not all of them are going to be right-wingers right ? ), 
  and the first thing you need to have is critical thinking , not eating all the bullshit they throw at you . 
  it 's incredibly stupid the amount of manipulation and demonization that there is nowadays . 
  not just the evil spanish state but the evil iranian-venezuelan plans to take over spain via podemos or the ludicrous madrit that steals all the catalan moneis . 
  fucking stupid people i say , they 're like monkeys but with the parrots ability of repeating the same bullshit again and again . 
  so whenever there 's a corruption case in the uk shall we label the country as a * corrupt european country * ? 
  well , maybe some british find more offensive the term `` european '' in that sentence ... so it 's a win-win if i happen to feel like messing with them like the independent does with their titles . 
  sshh , do n't try to counter-argument him . 
  you 'll be called a fascist torturer for contradicting his and this fishy foundation agendas . 
   spaniards always laugh when some portuguese says their age as `` ano '' is year in this side of the border . 
  lol, 
  you really need that tourism though . 
  i mean the canary islands especially . 
  your economy depends on it : / so i would say let them go xd, 
  well , i 'm from spain , but you said `` my country '' . 
  could be galicia , could be spain . 
  i 'm not from galicia but i find it distinctive enough to be considered a nation/country within the nation of nations that spain is . 
  and back to the question , i would agree if you meant spain , but i did n't find galician beaches that much crowded ( compared to the mediterranean ) . 
  do you mean galicia or spain ? 
  i 'm gon na go visit the netherlands now . 
  hah , take that !, 
  what 's the weirdest gpu pic they have sent you ? 
  my belly extends from fucking algarve to madeira . 
  ^ ^ disclaimer : ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ joking , ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ actually ^ ^ thin ... ^ ^ but ^ ^ really ^ ^ * really * ^ ^ love ^ ^ francesinhas . 
  so you say you do n't do any of cultural tourism/travelling around ? 
  no paris , no rome with your family/friends/girlfriend / boyfriend/cat/alone ? 
  nope ? 
  ok , yes , [ that 's ] ( http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3079/3205184849_deec96b933_b.jpg ) fucking spain too , but not * just * . 
  same reason why i almost exclusively travel to portugal :p my diet consists on francesinhas . 
  all the time . 
  spain , as a trademark , is not underrated/ignored . 
  but the interior really is . 
  only japanese people seem to really visit/like it . 
  come on eurobros , not everything is beach !, 
  [ you ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/vista-aerea-del-acueducto-de-segovia.jpg ) [ are ] ( http://primerasnoticias.com/viajesporespana/files/toledo-en-24-horas.jpg ) [ missing ] ( http://cdn-uploads.difusionlibre.com/2015/04/merida-roman-theatre-extremadura-spain-thinkstockphotos-467435165.jpg ) [ a ] ( http://www.joven-in.com/sites/default/files/destinos/galeria/2013/administrador/elpilar.esthercasas.20131.jpg ) [ lot . 
  i ca n't think of anything to trigger a croatian then without resorting to past dictatorships or tyrannical regimes that every other country in the world has had anyway :p, 
  i thought calling dubrovnik `` ragusa '' for the croats was the same like calling istanbul `` constantinople '' for the turks , lol . 
  yeah , well , there are more reasons why , politically , eastern and western europe are still a thing , my fellow westerner . 
  some are improving faster than others though , but that 's not the case of ukraine . 
  ragusa is awesome !, 
  ... ... did i trigger a croat already ? 
  yeah it 's trying too hard i think . 
  the education system wo n't teach you the required english you need to understand this post and actually comment on it . 
  it 's so badly planned . 
  i actually failed all my english tests and i hated it , now i can just speak it just fine because of my own interest on online gaming and now reddit . 
  many are bitching about high taxes here but those that do have no fucking idea about this . 
  then we have this shitty pp government increasing taxes after saying they 'll lower it and then lowering taxes right before elections , even if they knew we would n't meet the expected deficit . 
  too bad you were n't in that bus . 
  conjugations and concordance can be two really tough bitches . 
  because badajoz was n't portuguese and now is spanish , like olivenza . 
  olivenza is special . 
  let them be . 
  could be a good federal district for the republic of iberia . 
  s\u00ed , por favor . 
  this is fucking awesome . 
  some man says in spanish ( with an accent , may be dutch as well ? ), 
  something along `` they do n't do this in their country '' . 
  and i have the feeling that 's true ... 
  please , if you come to spain , do n't do this . 
  we are civil , and if you do this you will portray yourself and your country like the worst shit on earth for every spaniard watching you , and righfully probably . 
  what happens ? 
  i still have n't clicked , i 'm gon na che, 
  i have yet to meet someone who does n't use whatsapp . 
  not saying that is very good ... just pointing out what i see . 
  oh you take that back ... now it 's so fat it 's an american symbol . 
  come on !, 
  ireland had its own huge real estate bubble . 
  probably very little like everything else between both countries . 
  spain has high unemployment , not being a poor country though . 
  otherwise south korea or new zealand would be `` poor countries '' since they have very similar gdp per capita .
