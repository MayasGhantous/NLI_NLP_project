  you seem tolerant and well-balanced reasonable guy . 
  \u00bf semana santa ? 
  [ i guess i ca n't complain ] ( http://www.speedtest.net/result/4697333238.png ), 
  yes , the gdp of madrid is also catalan . 
  fuck off already . 
  that does n't say they 're all independentists ... although it would n't surprise me considering it 's an extremely biased pro-independence digital newspaper . 
  why do you even try if you come up with ... nothing related to what i 'm specifically speaking about . 
  do n't manipulate my words using your own `` they call us brainwashed '' propaganda . 
  i do n't give a flying fuck if it was the case , but you have no right to manipulate my words . 
  holy shit you know a lot of people do n't you . 
  bring me the data , or just stfu . 
  many people will vote independence ... and many people will not . 
  pointless information unless you get some real data , that 's what it 's called . 
  tomorrow we 'll see . 
  i did n't know it was illegal to do classes in spanish . 
  says a lot , thx for the info . 
   why i ca n't see any product labeled in catalan in stores ? 
  same reason why you can see products in spanish first in portugal . 
  reducing costs because more people that speak that language will buy it . 
  it 's not a conspirative measure done by the evil government to make you speak that language . 
  not even ** the private companies that sell those products ** do that for that reason . 
   why do most government conversations still happen in spanish ? 
  spanish is the most common language in the country , and catalan is used by the official institutions in catalonia . 
   why do only 3 out of the 30 + dvb-t channels broadcast in catalan ? 
  ehm , are you aware there 's no equality in terms of quantity of people speaking the different languages ? 
  how can you expect more tv channels in catalan in spain if there are more people that speak spanish ? 
  are we serious here ? 
   they clearly want to go . 
  [ but do they ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mc54asd.jpg ) seriously , those arguments ... ugh . 
  the things that were taken down in the estatut did n't affect any structure that the generalitat and its self-government already had ... what it stopped ( by the judicial power ) was , among other things like infrastructure obligations , the definition of catalonia as nation , and believe it or not the problem with that is not the recognition itself ( it 's even on the spanish constitution , which is totally hated by independentists ) but that some parties like pp really wanted to farm some votes outside of catalonia at the cost of that . 
  it would n't have changed much if that was allowed , considering other autonomic statutes like the andalousian one considers andaluc\u00eda as an ` historic nation ' . 
  and today , even the pp says that they would n't campaign against the estatut if it happened today ... because they 're silly but not to that extent . 
  also the independence is very hard to predict , let alone start guessing what will happen afterwards . 
  congrats but i doubt you represent any majority . 
  the thing is that catalonia is not `` opressed '' nor catalan is in danger ( if anything , the `` immersive '' education program in catalan has been very sucessful and both languages catalan and spanish are extremely well used in catalonia , which i think it 's better than only speaking a single language ) . 
  that `` catalans are opressed today '' is basically political propaganda from a part of the catalans ... which are the most nationalistic and die-hard independentists . 
  it 's bullshit . 
  the fourteen points is not a human right , so that 's you manipulating ... do n't blame others for your own lie . 
  plus you did n't even answer ... because it 's unconfortable to you . 
  why ? 
  because not a single constitution in europe and i 'd even say the most advanced democracies over all recognizes the self-determination of a part of its territory , despite your attemps to make spain look like it 's worse than them all , even if ** it 's basically the same ** . 
  it 's always the same propaganda , again , and again , and again . 
  it does n't matter though , you nationalists wanted referendum-esque parliamentary elections and you are having them . 
  be ready to lose them in votes though , which are the things that are counted towards a referendum 's validity . 
  that 's how democracy works and i 'm very happy with it even living in spain , crazy right ? 
  good luck . 
  are you aware more than half the population in catalonia feel spanish in some degree ? 
  and that spanish is the first spoken language ? 
  and that does n't mean that catalan is being harassed ? 
  did you even know that catalan is spoken outside of catalonia for like 2-3 million people in spain ? 
  including the territories of valencia and baleares . 
  believe it or not , catalans are spaniards , too . 
  surprised ? 
   what it did n't make possible is to respect the right of self-determination what constitution in europe recognizes the self-determination of a part of its own territory ? 
  because that does n't exist . 
  what it exists is the right to self-determination for colonies . 
  catalonia is not a colony , not even the most idiotic nationalistic ones dare to say that . 
  well , yes , [ maybe cucurull ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2l9rgo7eu4 ), 
   what does mas and convergencia have to do with any of this ? 
  so you say you are not able to understand either what i say or is about the language we are using right now ? 
   how can the debate be recorded before the response if margallo quoted the response ? 
  that it was a fake paragraph was not known until that night . 
  the debate was recorded before knowing that the whole thing was manipulated . 
  not the response itself . 
   spain 's dirty tactics are beyond belief sometimes . 
  catalonia is mas ? 
  whatever mas does is what catalonia thinks ? 
  so you 're saying the government of converg\u00e8ncia is catalonia ... because , well , i guess if you consider spain to be the government of pp you must apply this same reasoning to other people . 
  and by the way , that debate was recorded before this was known , that same afternoon , and then aired at night ... 
  i guess you did n't know that . 
  or yes , but you still said that because that 's how you nationalistic people are . 
  quit your bullshit already . 
  independentists are starting to be just a shitty copy of the spanish most backwards arguments with rampant xenophobia . 
  it 's already hard to spot the differences other than the piece of cloth they venerate . 
  just like converg\u00e8ncia in catalonia has been winning . 
  corrupted right-wingers ... no wonder ciu has been supporting pp in the central government in the past , and pp has been supporting ciu in the generalitat just a couple years ago . 
  they 're basically the same corrupted right-wingers crap . 
  this all is a fact wether you like it or not . 
  there 's at least one considerable party that 's either vague or has not explicitly said `` yes '' or `` no '' to independence . 
  so you 're wrong . 
  also , when you intend to count seats instead of votes the referendum-esque picture that you want to draw suddenly collapses . 
  every single time . 
  check my comment again and try to find where i say `` catalonia is not the first in total gdp '' . 
   if catalan society is fractured , it 's because of the spanish state 's actions , it 's not ` the fault of mas ' like many people enjoy to say . 
  if you oversimplify the reality do n't criticize others for oversimplifying the reality ... d'oh . 
  solve it where , exactly ? 
  the biggest problem is the fracture in the catalan society itself ... have you seen the polls ? 
  spanish people outside of catalonia tend to give zero fucks unless you try to dig . 
  also , many catalans ( could even go as far as to say a majority of them ) feel spanish themselves , in different degrees . 
  latest direct poll done by the generalitat regarding the independentist issue said 42 % in favor of it , 50 % against . 
  that was july 2015 . 
  catalonia ranks fourth in gdp per capita in spain , after basque country , navarre and community of madrid . 
  also , madrid is second just around the corner in total gdp ( with less population ) , so it 's not `` a significant margin '' , at all . 
  independentist support has never been this high . 
  the crisis has a lot to do with this , but i wo n't blame you for utilizing it . 
  it is ` now ' because if it 's not ` now ' it simply wo n't be in any other moment unless another huge crisis happens and triggers all the shit ( including the actual political crisis ) . 
  remember that spain has been suffering throughout its history about territorial issues whenever the shit hit the fan . 
  it never changes and long-time independentists are simply impatient and are perfecly aware of this perfect moment to try it . 
  they 're going all-in .
