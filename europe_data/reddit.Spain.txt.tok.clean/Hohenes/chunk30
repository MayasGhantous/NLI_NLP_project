  he does n't . 
  he 's talking out of his ass , like he does with the gibraltar issue . 
  because the spanish are obviously terribad . 
  poor rosbif does n't know we 're not in the 18th century anymore . 
  spaniards are probably more religiously apathetic than whatever shitty country you 're from . 
  it 's wrong about the catalan independence issue . 
  it 's more like `` pro-referendum issue '' . 
  es una broma . 
  and because of that treaty gibraltar has no claims over territorial waters beyond its port . 
  if you think the treaty is correct and gibraltar is british clay for so , then gibraltar has no territorial waters . 
  if you think gibraltar should have territorial waters , then this treaty is no longer valid . 
  you ca n't cherrypick the international legislation , discard the parts you do n't like and act like we did n't notice . 
  i stand by what i said seeing your point on the tax heaven issue is `` omg , spanish journalism , so populist because it 's spanish rabble rabble rabble '' . 
   sorry , but you appear to be picking nonsensical logic out of thin air . 
  how does weather gibraltar is british or not have any sort of impact of wheatear gibraltar is a colony or not ? 
  gibraltar is british and it 's not a colony . 
  wrong , and wrong . 
  first : [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_utrecht ) is still working in the case of gibraltar . 
  i also think it makes little sense but as i said we usually do n't give a damn about gibraltar sovereignity ( except the government , obviously ) . 
  they can root in hell if that 's what they want , what we do n't want and what we really are angry about is gibraltarian police and the royal navy disturbing our own territory . 
  second point : also wrong . 
  gibraltar is a colony and it 's part of the decolonization committee by the un , and it is included in [ the resolution 66 of the unitated nations of non-self-governing territories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_list_of_non-self-governing_territories ) . 
   that 's a myth no , it 's not , and here 's fucking fabian picardo ( such a british name right ? ), 
  chief minister of gibraltar , talking about exactly this : * bad relations between spain and gibraltar prevent the british colony from sharing tax information and other financial data with madrid as it does with other european nations , chief minister fabian picardo said in an interview published on monday in el pa\u00cds . 
  * http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/03/04/inenglish/1362398122_757165.html before you reply again , please do inform yourself first . 
  i reject talking to someone that simply has n't been informed in the matter that we are discussing . 
  but please , above all : stop inventing shit in order to try to convince yourself that what you believe is true . 
  it is not . 
  learn the facts , then we can discuss . 
  thank you very much . 
  would be much better if it was just a fishing rights argument . 
  it 's not about that . 
  it 's about a territorial conflict where gibraltar argues they have control over some waters that they actually do n't control ... because they 're certainly not gibraltarian waters according to the same treaty that defines what gibraltar is . 
  so either gibraltar is not a colony and therefore not british ( can be independent , martian , or whatever the fuck they want because we do n't give a damn shit about it ) , or those are definitely not gibraltarian waters . 
  you ca n't just have everything , being a colony without its disadvantages , a tax-heaven level fiscal system , special legislation with gambling and tobacco that produces an enormous amount of traffiking in the border , and on top of that have control over waters that are not yours ... sorry but nope , the gibraltarian gov can go fuck themselves . 
  and we will obviously keep defending our waters . 
  [ this is a constant in the strait ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.elmundo.es%2fespana%2f2015%2f10%2f09%2f5617914746163ff64e8b4645.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) and it 's them getting into trouble every time , not the contrary . 
  i 'm sorry but [ this is hillary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dy77j6ubhi ) , and it 's disgusting . 
  i do n't think reddit made her being the biggest oportunistic , hypocrite , and compulsive liar politician in the democratic party . 
  it 's all fucked up . 
  bernie sanders can be whatever you want ... but i mean ... at least he 's not ... * her * . 
  edit : wow , calm down hillary fans . 
  this is because / r/europe is mainly populated by british and northerners overall , which will obviously side for gibraltar and the uk , not for the fishermen in algeciras that get their vessels raided by the gibraltarian police and often claim spanish waters are not spanish , when they actually are . 
  i do n't give a damn about it though . 
  we know what 's going on , one uninformed idiot or two wo n't change this , he or she will just feel better after downvoting but will keep living in his/her own shitty ingorance . 
  the evolution of those are also interesting to see . 
  [ here 's one i found of antena 3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdxypjsoraa ) ( spain ) the most popular one was the 1998-2004 one , or at least i can * really * remember that one . 
  hillary counts as 3 or 4 shitty gop candidates though . 
  i wish bernie the best , otherwise the options will be trump or hillary ... unitedstatians are going to have a bad time . 
  i mean , it 's not that i like it ... 
  i actually need it . 
  i ca n't sleep more than 4-5 hours at night . 
  i need to recover some sleep time during the day , not more than 1-1 .5 hours though . 
  it 's not about * taking a siesta * . 
  it 's about having [ a bi-phasic sleep pattern ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polyphasic_sleep#biphasic_sleep ) . 
  and it 's very common in humankind ... not just spaniards . 
  cliches are stupid . 
  and i actually would recommend it to everybody . 
  biphasic or even multiphasic sleep is the best way to keep you full of energy in every moment ( that you 're not sleeping obviously ) w/o needing caffeine or any kind of drugs as such . 
  and at the same time you need less hours of sleep in total to be recharged . 
  it 's more efficient ... but do n't tell those silly northerners :p, 
  olive oil bros of the ~ ~ world ~ ~ mediterranean , unite !, 
  that 's funny because it 's gibraltar that raids spanish waters more often than not . 
  downvotes wo n't change this fact though . 
  paella and tapas white not being catalan per se it is still part of the spanish cuisine overall and can be found pretty much in every corner of the country ... and that includes barcelona of course . 
  good , and you will dislike it and repudiate it . 
  even better . 
  how is this good news ? 
  if anything , the ones that should leave a refugee centre are the ones attacking others for their sexual orientation . 
  and the country , too . 
  i think you take too seriously the opinions of people in this subreddit that do n't even know spain , because you seem not to be well informed at all . 
  thank you , i did n't post it because it has no eng subtitles sadly , but grazie . 
  i laugh at you guys that talk out of your ass without knowing shit ... ... . ... . how do you know they do n't have a bad breath in the star wars universe !?!? 
  jeez !, 
  more or less at this time of the day . 
  here 's a [ wiki article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23-f ) and a [ video record ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pplplbssqqq ) of the moment in the parliament , with some fire aiming to the roof .

  said from an ex-colonial empire to an ex-colonial empire , huh ? 
  how appropriate . 
  took the spares and was so lil cute and tiny to be considered an empire ... but still took them . 
  most likely people wo n't understand you though , as dutch is such a minor language !,

  romania ... pfft ... it 's just about you and me , my loved shit-rectangle \u2665, 
  i 'm sorry you ca n't leave south italy behind , it goes with the pack . 
  lol . 
  all those holandeses ... they need some air to breathe and shit . 
  as big as him being portrayed as a clown ? 
  that 's exactly what i meant , since it 's not just a portuguese thing , it 's quite related to latin europe ( italy and the iberians specially , a bit less for the french ) . 
  my point is we should try to be more objective and look at things as they are , and portugal , like others i mentioned , is a developed , advanced country that it 's very hard to make it look bad . 
  it 's not about that , and it 's not just about portugal . 
  i also include other developed , advanced , first-world countries like spain , italy or greece in there . 
  also , and in case someone misunderstands me , it 's not against estonia either but more about the lack of self-esteem about his own country shown by / u/empirestateofmadness, 
  oh please , stop it . 
  it does take a lot to make you look bad . 
  to make portugal look bad you first need to be a first-world country and that 's already a lot .
