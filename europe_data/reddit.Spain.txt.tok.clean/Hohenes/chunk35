  andalucian separatism is also non-existent . 
  it 's about regionalism and nationalism , not separatism . 
  the same goes for asturias . 
  also , the catalan one is not even representing its own territory , as valencia and baleares are not catalan . 
  the only real separatist movements are those in basque country and catalonia . 
  galicia has it too , but in a much more minor escale ( think of wales or brittany , for example ) . 
  and last , but not least ... why would you leave the current spanish flag for the remainders of `` spain '' . 
  that 's not spain anymore , that 's ... madrid and a bit more . 
  whoever made this map knows little about this , really . 
  unlikely . 
  galician ~ ~ nationalists ~ ~ independentists want their own nation , not getting annexed by portugal . 
  portugalicia is only relevant among portuguese nationalists . 
  that flag would be 1000 % cooler though . 
  january-february-march are the `` maybe it can snow '' months in madrid xd december is like a no-no . 
  yes please . 
  i live in madrid and pass through [ atocha ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyqq3xfb3ea ) almost everyday ... 
  i 'm not scared of those mofos .

  we too hate our government, 
  congrats brothers, 
   sure , the spanish army 's deployment in iraq was defeated in madrid not bagdad . 
  this is simply ignoring spain 's politics and even more , ignoring what happened during 2002 , 2003 and 2004 . 
  spain did n't want war , [  90 % of the population was against , hundreds of thousand if not millions marched on madrid against the war ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/manifestaciones_contra_la_invasi%c3%b3n_de_irak_de_2003#la_peculiaridad_espa.c3.b1ola ) before anything happened . 
  saying that the spanish army was defeated the 11-m is simply like saying us army would have been more prepared in 9/11 if they did n't go to vietnam . 
  exactly . 
  makes zero sense . 
   if spain engages in a high profile deployment to africa , every jihadi and his auntie will be looking to bomb madrid again . 
  not really . 
  africa is not the same as the middle east . 
   if the spanish people react in the same way again , by voting for a government that brings the boys straight home - the hit to the credibility of the spanish state could be huge . 
  even the opposition approves helping france in syria . 
   i certainly think barcelona will be pleased with madrid sticking its head above the parapet here , in the hope madrid gets one right between the eyes . 
  this has absolutely nothing to do with this matter , not like the army was going to be deployed in catalonia ... because it already is . 
  it 's part of the country still . 
  i think you have a huge lack of information buddy ... at least that 's my conclusion . 
  you really do n't know what 's going on here but you still thought you did . 
  there * is * already spanish troops and military equipment deployed in those regions helping france . 
  spain has enough military to increase its presence there without compromising anything in its own territory . 
  after madrid 's attack our military was called back because we did n't want that war from the beginning , and a government change happened . 
  the army did n't come back because of the attacks . 
  welcome to the spacial club , just do n't be so hungry up there or we will run out of spacial doritos . 
  while spain is indeed at risk ( you know , the 11-m , the reconquista , `` al-andalus '' thing ... we are always directly mentioned together with paris , london , rome or washington ) , today it seems france is the center of this horror , and looks like we need to support france in order to help us all . 
  i think spain is at risk , and even if it 's a priority it 's not first on their list ... so i 'd say let 's go help more france in africa , so france can focus on syria . 
  so do spain , although nor your islands nor ours are in the continent . 
  that 's why portugal and spain are the westernmost part of * continental * europe , and not iceland  edit : idiots downvoting just proving their stupidity . 
  portugal is not an island , bro . 
  let me know if you want to know more :p, 
  depends if you 're looking it upside down or not . 
  you forgot 47 million people in the westernmost part of the continent . 
  edit : oh , i 've just read your last sentence . 
  oh no , it happens , like you say , for a few weeks between seasons . 
  my point is that that should 've happened by this time ... in october , not now . 
  we should be freezing already !, 
  lol as you might have guessed , i hate warm temperatures . 
  and living in spain that 's ... a nightmare , at least in plain areas of the interior . 
  so i 'm always eager of the cold , freeze and snow finally arriving . 
  i see . 
  my point is that we ( as in madrid and interior of spain overall ) indeed have a continentalized variation of the mediterranean climate , although we really do n't have such contrasts the rest of the year . 
  sure , the temperature amplitude is larger than in the coast , and also we are around ~ 700 meters above sea level , so things get a little more extreme than being just in the sea shore , but still ... days should be cold , windy , icy ... etc. 
  but we barely have to wear a jacket at mid day , and you see people with summer clothes these days . 
  it 's not usual in this time of the year . 
  madrid at 7 am or so i 'm freezing my ass at 3-4\u00bac at most when i go to work , and just about 4-5 hours later ... bang , 22\u00bac . 
  * really !? 
  * i hate this . 
  i just want to freeze my ass * the whole day * . 
  it 's time already . 
  we iberian bros are bound to suffer the azores anticyclones with southern winds from africa . 
  plus snow and cold and ice and fog . 
  what people call `` bad weather '' is my good weather . 
  only thing is i 'm not galician , but that does n't matter , still iberian . 
  no problem , the day after catalonia goes independent this will fix itself , dw . 
  i hate it . 
  it says they wo n't obey the spanish constitutional court . 
  if that 's democratic for you ... ok , but for the rest of democrats we think it 's not , even if we disagree with the judges and the current politicians . 
  so no , you 're mixing up things . 
  it 's not about a referendum , it 's about creating an independent state ... that 's the quote . 
  unilateral secession . 
  it is for / u/aleixasv because everybody here knows what his political opinion is . 
  but / u/aleixasv 's political opinion is not the reality . 
  too bad for him . 
   we need to ignore the spanish constitution to be able to hold this referendum . 
  i see your point but ...  which is exactly what was voted today in parliament . 
  this is not true . 
  it 's actually absolutely false . 
  [ this is what has been approved today . ], 
  it has nothing to do with a referendum . 
  it literally says : ** `` parliament solemnly declares the beginning of the process of creating independent catalan state as a republic . 
  '' ** and also talks about `` disconnecting from spain '' . 
  not `` exactly '' what you say , buddy . 
   do n't even know the opinions of `` the rest '' of parties . 
  so you assume they want independence in a non-referendum elections despite not saying so ? 
  how democratic . 
  i would n't be so sure ... ciudadanos destroyed pp in catalonia because they represented the anti-independentism better than them . 
  this is going nowhere , so everybody do n't worry . 
  it was n't the unionists that wanted the referendum ... plus i ( you say `` then let the referendum ) do not have competences to do so , 
  no , precisely what i 'm sure is what parties are `` yes '' . 
  and ** the `` yes '' parties in that election had less than 50 % of the votes . 
  ** not talking about `` no '' parties but `` the rest '' . 
  check my comments again . 
  so ... yes , really , i do know what i 'm talking about .
