  it 's a spoken language in spain by about 10 million and recognised by the constitution :p, 
  columbus ' origins have been up to debate in recent times , although i doubt that 's of any importance considering a supposedly italian columbus did n't start off an italian empire in the americas that left a really long-standing heritage ( minus the really bad things that all colonizers have done ... ) plus 500 + million italian speakers in the world . 
  argentina/la plata could have been italy 's america if spanish did n't spread fast there earlier too though !, 
  let 's keep it civil guys ... we want more democracy , not less  the national day * of the democratic era * ... even if an imperfect democracy , fascism has nothing to do with it :p, 
  i mean , portugal is a developed and rich western european country ... but the current economic crisis has put this country ( plus ours and some others ) in the middle of the economic debate and things have been questioned , even if our countries still are well developed , rich western european countries ... but it 's normal that people google things about that when it 's in the news everyday , so i understand it a bit more . 
  although considering portugal or spain ( or any other real rich country affected by the crisis ) not a rich country because of the current economic situation makes no sense . 
  levels of development , gdp per capita , life quality , healthcare ... basically everything excluding unemployment ( which should and is covered ) ... would be like ignoring them all and consider countries like south korea , with a slightly lower gdp per capita than spain , a poor country . 
  no sense . 
  yup . 
  [ spanish national day ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fiesta_nacional_de_espa%c3%b1a ) ( * fiesta nacional de espa\u00f1a / festa nacional d'espanya / festa nacional de espa\u00f1a / espainiako jai nazionala * ) commemorates the anniversary of christopher columbus 's first arrival in the americas . 
  in other countries this day is also known as [ columbus day ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/columbus_day ) , discovery day , d\u00eda de la raza , d\u00eda de las am\u00e9ricas ... etc. 
  depending where you are . 
  also , it can be refered to as d\u00eda de la hispanidad ( hispanicity day ), 
  jaque mate , ateos . 
  lol we might not be too used to spicy food to be fair . 
  corrected . 
  god , it 's ... painful . 
  what did you answer to all of that ... `` have you read a single book in your life ? '', 
  or what, 
  i mean , i love the mexican food ... but i prefer grandma 's [ cocido ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cocido ) more often !, 
  right , i used quotation marks , but i tend not to say it like that ( i use it in phrases like `` the average spaniard ... '' , where it 's correct ) . 
  but you 're right , this time was wrong . 
  as a spaniard myself ... ... ... ... english no bueno :p, 
  oh my god this is so stupid ... 
  i prefer the uk out of the eu before the eu accepting such stupid demands that would totally destroy all the purposes of the union -_- i 'm sorry brits , this looks bad . 
  look at all those mexican countries !, 
  ! 11 ! one more seriously : that 's why i prefer to say `` i 'm * a * spaniard '' rather than `` spanish '' , since the last one has a different cultural meaning in the united states that is almost not related to spain by any other thing than the language . 
  also , tacos and burritos are not popular in spain guys , it 's considered mexican food just like indian food is ... indian food . 
  who the hell asks google if spain or italy are in europe . 
  i mean , i 'm really intrigued and i want to meet them . 
  i doubt it will have vast advantegeous effects for pp ... obviously everything they try is towards that goal , even using public institutions to do so ( not like ciu was any better convocating elections for the 27th being the 11th of september the first day of campaign ... such a coincidence right !? 
  crazy stuff ) . 
  but really , i just think it has more to do with the presupuestos generales and having them polished as to not having the next government ( which hopefully wo n't be them ) getting/able to decide ... that 's even worse than trying to hold elections in a very specific date so they get a little advantage ( or so they think ) - because that 's done everywhere , sadly . 
  i 'm optimistic though and think that they will fail miserably . 
  the `` yes '' vote has a huge percentage ... but it 's not a majority ( around 47 % ) . 
  so i do n't think it 's going to happen ( soon at least ? ), 
  in spain , overall ... things will probably change . 
  and if it does n't , then catalonia will be independent . 
  but i 'm much more optimistic regarding the people of spain ... because they want change , even if the current central government ( and big party pp ) do n't . 
  are n't you getting enough gota fr\u00eda !?!, 
  well , `` bad '' weather ( for me it 's not , ok ? ), 
  happens , windy , rainy and all that shit ... so in madrid ** [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wfuav9r.jpg ) ** happens after the first single drop of water falls from the sky . 
  everyone and their dog forget how to drive and 100km + traffic jams appears ... tadaaa . 
  oh , and cold nights but in the day sometimes you still have to take off your jacket ( only if it 's not rainy/windy/cloudy ) . 
  hopefully that wo n't last long . 
  i want winteeeer . 
  ( spain ) let 's say he does n't help alleviate any of the american clich\u00e9s . 
   he 's an american berlusconi/orban perfect definition . 
  because elections in 3 months . 
  i know that / u/sugusino already said it . 
  why do i repeat it you say ? 
  well because it 's the only reason . 
  really . 
  let 's hope you 're right , i perfectly know that you do n't like ciudadanos but man ... if they happen to steal partido popular 's votes like in catalonia i 'd be so happy even if i do n't care about any of those two parties myself . 
  that 's with every single popular thread , no exceptions . 
  well the spanish one is also the local one . 
  they are fortunate enough to have two :p it 's not swiss level but almost !, 
  no , they 're just plain fallacies . 
   even tsipras ' syriza is following the same path . 
  this does n't mean they are any less socialist . 
  you are mixing what words they use to define themselves vs the government actions taken very recently , which are not left-wing policies . 
  that 's the actual fact , and you 're mixing it to make it look differently of what it really is . 
  the last part of your comment is exactly the same , so it 's not even a new argument , and it 's simply false as stated above . 
  so you are the one with the problem ... the problem of trying to find someone that actually takes your bullshit . 
  stay there in your alter reality for a while . 
  [ galicia ( spain ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galicia_\\ ( spain \\ ) ) we are using english , my friend , 
  ** country ** : spain ** favourite neighbour ** : portugal ** least favourite neighbour ** : morocco, 
   least favourite neighbour : spain spain * minus galicia * ftfy . 
  yes i share your vision plus it 's basically what i had in my mind , prior to getting all the responses above . 
  it just seems illogical to me for a right-wing party to call itself `` social dem\u00f3crata '' , it 's like an actual social-democrat party called itself a `` conservative '' party . 
  obviously now i get why is that , after reading all the responses . 
  do n't worry , i 'm well informed besides the name thing itself and i know very well the bias of those who tell me portugal is very socialist . 
  it actually looks quite conservative to me , being an old iu ( izquierda unida , like die linke , or bloco ) voter , now just aiming for podemos . 
  wow , all your three points are actually fallacies : s, 
  uhm , but psd has been applying all kind of austerity measures and privatizations ... how do you call that `` socialist '' ? 
  i did n't know that was the reason , thank you and / u/estaserrado for that . 
  as for the socialist party , as i said around here , looks totally like psoe ( `` partido socialista obrero espa\u00f1ol '' ) here . 
  so far from being socialist , it 's only slightly social-democrat and becomes your standard economically right-wing party in the government . 
  every . 
  time . 
  we 've learned that already , even if it had to be the hard way though . 
  ohh that makes sense , and i did n't know that , obrigado . 
   today even partido socialista is at best centre-left , and has frequently imposed right wing economics when in government . 
  ha , we know that very well ... we call it `` psoe '' . 
  that 's why 15-m and podemos happened , among many other reasons , because i 'm simplifying it . 
  what surprises me is that portugal is not seeing a podemos and ciudadanos kind of parties , like they are and have surged in greece , italy and spain . 
  i know that bloco de esquerda tried to `` podemizite '' itself but failed . 
  why do you guys call a right-wing party `` partido socialdemocrata '' ? 
  : s socialdemocrats for me are somewhat left leaning , not considered communist but more like moderate centre-left . 
  is the psd in portugal a right-wing party in the economic sense , but very socially liberal and thus considered `` left '' in the social agenda ? 
  anyway have a happy democratic day , dear brothers ... we 'll be watching all the news from portugal tonight from this side of la raya / a raia . 
  love from your eastern iberian brothers !, 
  yeah , about that ... 
  it can also be galician , basque , quechua ... etc. 
  this is a [ patronymic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patronymic ) that means `` hijo de '' which means `` son of '' . 
  as in fern\u00e1ndez : hijo de fernando , * son of ferdinand * . 
  there are more for words ending in - ito/a , for diminutive things . 
  like house = casa , little house = casita . 
  zapato ( shoe ) = zapatito ( little shoe ) and so on . 
  for instance , you can also find - azo , - ato as aumentative , like house = casa , big ass house = casaza  \u00a1 menuda casaza que tiene fern\u00e1ndez !,
