   so it 's just time they tough up and stop complainig like crybabies and asking dady-state to take good care of them poor victims . 
   we 've all got problems serious ? 
  i mean . 
  are you real ? 
  just how pathetic you are lol . 
  looks like someone just needs to accept what happened in the last catalan elections . 
  lol . 
  you 're trying too hard . 
  i care a lot about my portubros :(, 
  welcome to catalan independentism . 
  sshhhh ... let him dream . 
  no u, 
  good thing no one has to die when a politically different option wins over another you like more . 
  democracy has its advantages . 
  you mean the text that says [ iberian federation ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/iberismo ) ? 
  that 's what i did : i did n't count the `` no '' . 
  i just said that the `` yes '' is not conforming a majority of over 50 % ... so independence has lost . 
  every government has negotiated with eta . 
  every one of them . 
   why is that image shorter than my erect penis ? 
  show us , so we can compare ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  amberes/antuerpia pls, 
  articles 5 and 6 of the treaty . 
  here 's a tl ; dr of the story ( sorry , in spanish ) :  en abril de 1949 , 12 pa\u00edses firmaban el denominado tratado de washington por el que se constitu\u00eda oficialmente la organizaci\u00f3n del tratado del atl\u00e1ntico norte ( otan ) . 
  except we 're in 2016 , not in 1949 , and shit has changed , things get updated ... etc. 
  dude , it 's not passive-aggressiveness . 
  it 's business ... money . 
  after two fucking days of international pressure the government did withdraw the shit and the russian ship will probably go 5 km further along the coast of morocco ( very close us ally ) to refuel their crap ... such a huge difference ... except spain will no longer get paid . 
  yes , yes , spain bad , i know -_- like when france sides ( sided ) morocco against spanish interests . 
   spain entering the alliance - you can thank franco for that - what ? 
  we entered nato in democracy . 
  we actually had a referendum in the 80s , during a socialist government . 
  also ceuta and melilla are not considered colonies by united nations . 
  not even by morocco ( they sometimes call them occupied territory , not colonies ) . 
  yeah , shitty countries with little coastline like norway and australia are stupid and buy cheap substandard products because they 're poor as fuck . 
  i know !, 
  it 's ridiculous that nato has articles that talk about how the `` french territories in north africa '' are not covered , and have n't updated those in decades . 
  this is why ceuta and melilla are left out as well . 
  it 's stupid shit i 'm there with you , 
  navantia is a reference in surface warships , having been able to integrate the aegis lm system in a much smaller platform . 
  it has designed and built the f-100 alvaro de baz\u00e1n class frigates ( 5 units ) for the spanish navy and the f-310 fridtjof nansen class ( 5 units ) in service at the royal norwegian navy . 
  the australian warfare destroyer , currently under construction , is another navantia design also based in navantia f-100 frigate . 
  at present the challenge is the f-110 , the future spanish frigate that will have to perform new capacities and missions in a changing and challenging international scenario . 
  in september 2007 , navantia won the contract , as the main partner , for two amphibious ships for the royal australian navy very similar to the lhd `` juan carlos i '' that navantia has built for the spanish navy . 
  in march 2016 navantia was selected as the `` preferred bidder '' to build two logistics support ships for the royal australian navy . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/navantia i 'm afraid you 're poorly informed . 
  indeed . 
  looks like your right arm has left the eu already ( \u2310 \u25a0 _ \u25a0 ), 
  to be fair if nato says ceuta and melilla are not part of nato ... well then , let us have them under nato 's umbrella next time \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af they 're and want to be spanish after all . 
  it 's like trading with daesh . 
  we get it , it 's cold and there are precipitations in the form of solid water . 
  tacos are expensive to get in orbit without having them fall apart . 
  tell the catalans !, 
  iberia , if united , very stronk . 
  better than france \u2665, 
  what 's so funny about it ? 
  we can start with little things , no one will force you ( not anymore ) :p, 
  you get triggered [ so ] ( http://www.movimentopartidoiberico.com/home.php ) easily : /, 
  we let them stay in your country though . 
  this is news because it 's russia , but other countries have also offered help ( in the previous earthquake too ) spain did offer help as well , and i 'm sure many others : http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20160824/404169206177/espana-italia-medios-militares-terremoto.html it 's quite normal to offer this kind of help and the normal thing is usually to reject it while being thankful ( kind of a proud thing ? ), 
  of course . 
  madrid ( italy ) see . 
  everything works :p ( we would be in the north , tho ) . 
  nope . 
  i did n't increase my food intake . 
  i think i was just used to process it faster due to nicotine and once i got rid of it my organism got slower , but i did n't lower the food intake and i gained way too much ( i was super thin before so now it 's not like i 'm super fat , plus i lost 10 kg already , and i intend to lose 10 more ) . 
  i quitted smoking thanks to vaping . 
  now i can live without that shit . 
  but i gained 30 kg for quitting :(, 
  the spanish one talking about unemployment . 
  they 're * incredibly * popular in spain . 
  i guess you sell a lot to spain ? 
  also , are you galician or something ? 
  i 'm actually a cop in barcelona and i was just surveying a bit ( ? ), 
  well you can find tons of * choco * south of my city in almost every bar . 
  not as good as ganja though . 
  i need way more than that to see myself dancing flamenco xd, 
   we can buy it from shops tell me more ... 
  we 're ready and set for a cultural victory !, 
  honestly it 's not like they were n't destroying themselves before the arrival . 
  in any way , the ones that did all the pillage etc. 
  are the ones that crossed the atlantic and stayed there . 
  so in reality , it 's their ascendency to blame , not the common people that stayed in the old continent . 
  disclaimer : not trying to shake the blame off , of course the people that ** ruled ** spain did wrong things . 
  just quit lying, 
  if you mean the speeches , not even pp was called fascist by them in the speeches in the street . 
  ciudadanos was called `` marca blanca '' , but nothing else beyond that ( besides what i said earlier ) . 
  i do n't think they have been as harsh as the guy from ciudadanos has been in that precise moment . 
  the main leaders are , but i 'm talking about the voters and the similarities with psoe voters . 
  psoe leaders are also far from what the voters are . 
  i do n't think there are 5 million people in spain that think exactly like pablo iglesias . 
  remember that iu has had 1 or 2 million , at most . 
  if this was the case , iu would have had 5 million as well . 
  i think if errej\u00f3n was the leader podemos would win many additional seats . 
  i myself vote them but it does n't mean i agree with everything pablo iglesias says . 
  i do n't remember that . 
  i do remember calling them `` cu\u00f1ados '' and ibex35 defensors , but not fascists . 
  care to remind me ? 
  that would be a good spain . 
  well there are at least 5 million of us .
