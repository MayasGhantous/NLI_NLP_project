  i bet podemos is not yet over and they can grow a bit more . 
  also , many of the 5 million psoe voters are basically identical to podemos voters . 
  maybe not all of them , but definitely a lot of them are . 
  well , the guy from c 's called them `` friends of the terrorists '' . 
  he 's a bit insane . 
  it 's only logical that podemos leaders were so angry . 
  you have this idea already built and no matter how the reality looks that you will simply keep this idea in your mind . 
  no matter how far from the truth is . 
  that 's the main reason i dislike irrational sentiments like religion or nationalism so much . 
  but nothing against you in the personal side . 
  also , i never said you call the rest of us `` idiots '' . 
  i said that `` like if we were '' . 
  very different . 
  have a good night, 
  but that 's your view of how others view spain xdd see , you can see how i view spain , the problem is that you depict us ( the rest of spaniards ) like ... like if we were idiots that ca n't see how spain is plural and diverse . 
  but then when asked what you think of galicians or basque or andalusians separetely ... you go like `` they totally ok , awesome people , let them fight for their own turf '' ... well they 're part of this whole thing we call spain . 
  i do n't know , if you think pp is that part of castillian nationalism you refer , then why they use catalan in the speeches in catalonia and everything ? 
  why would they use catalan if they want it to disappear according to you ? 
  plus i 'm not a pp defender at all . 
  quite the contrary , i 'm 100 % against everything what pp represents . 
  the only difference is that i do n't want to split us in order to beat pp . 
  that 's so fucking selfish , like the whole fucking `` espanya ens roba '' shit , that you know it 's not * exactly * robbing ... . -_- also , there are 100 % catalans or 100 % basques in pp and c 's ... that i 'm against what they think does n't mean that i can see what 's going on . 
  why do you think some catalan is less catalan or just a `` castillian nationalist '' for being part of pp ? 
  do you think they among themselves do n't recognise their ... `` catalanity '' ? 
  you 're starting to sound scary to me . 
  if you want to keep chatting seriously about this we can do so in any other way if you want . 
  i use steam :p, 
  every nationalism is . 
  your rhetoric is the one that says that everything spanish is foreigner for the catalans , and what is catalan is the only `` own '' thing for catalonia . 
  this is * very * common among nationalists . 
  also , i 'm a hundred percent sure that your concept of spanish nationalism is wrong , and that you 're mixing spanish with castillian nationalism . 
  by definition , something spanish * includes * the catalan language and catalan culture , while something castillian does not . 
  and you 're using the concept that some castillian nationalists in madrid have about spain ( and they 're very minoritary ) to your own use , that you apply to everything that 's not catalan . 
  in order to you and me agree in something , we need to make clear what we are talking about . 
  because being spanish includes being catalan , including its language . 
  you just simply say that if you let some people that dislike catalan rule the country then catalan will disappear . 
  the thing is ... not so many people contrary to what you think dislike catalan that much . 
  spain is not filled with francoists and right-wing bigots that you think they think spanish should be the only language spoken and catalans are terribad . 
  see how you are trying to depict an image of spain that is absolutely backwards , and you actually believe in that and actively try to make others believe that . 
  you 're so wrong and you 're the one that looks very backwards because of this . 
  i answered directly to what you refer to . 
  the problem is that your concepts are mixed up because you do n't recognise being catalan as something that 's part of being spanish ... because you 're a catalan nationalist independentist . 
  good for you , but that 's not even a majority of the catalans and definitely not what most catalans feel . 
   our nationalism is different no , it 's not , and once you realize this you 'll note the only condescending prick is you because of this . 
  regarding the rest of spain as something you do n't deserve because you feel like a special snowflake . 
  well , you 're not . 
  period . 
   spanish nationalism and catalan nationalism are n't nearly the same . 
  yes , every nationalist has a rhetoric around exceptionalism . 
  and catalan nationalism is not exceptional enough to be unique among nationalisms . 
  even if you , as a nationalist , believe that your nationalism is less nationalistic . 
  you guys need to chill with this shit . 
  it 's not a bad thing being a nationalist * per se * . 
  just accept that your nationalism is not better ( or worse ) than others ... although i guess that 's going to be hard to do for a nationalist . 
  says the guy that did n't answer  who are ` we ' ? 
  in first place . 
  start from there . 
  so you say that one nationalism works to survive while the other works to destroy ... what you do n't get is that spanish is actually part of the catalans and as such part of their culture . 
  unless you 're one of these nationalists that calls everything non-purely-catalan as `` colonist '' . 
  and there are a lot . 
  no i did n't prove your point . 
  i just proved you that your rhetoric is just a lot of bullshit , but you already knew that . 
  that 's how you build up a rhetoric of things that are just inexistent today . 
  the catalan culture and language is protected by the spanish constitution via your autonomic statute , actually . 
  and this is not rhetoric , here 's the article : * 2 . 
  the other spanish languages shall also be official in the respective self-governing communities in accordance with their statutes . 
  * if this is your main concern , let me tell you that non-catalan spanish nationalists wo n't be able to hurt the catalan language because the constitution wo n't allow it . 
  oh , and the ** only ** vehicular language in public catalan schools is catalan . 
  spanish is not even an option , even if it 's laso part of catalonia and the most used language . 
  agreed , but that has nothing to do with being `` minority '' , but more with the statu quo . 
   then you are the one blinded by nationalism . 
  i do n't think he 's the one absolutely blind by his nationalism here . 
  you nationalists think you 're better than others . 
  that 's exactly why i find nationalism disgusting , including pp 's one . 
  it 's incredible how you try to convince yourself saying that your right is less right . 
  pathetic . 
  i 'm starting to think you 're gabriel rufi\u00e1n . 
  or else i absolutely reject to believe that you 're being serious about your lack of ability to understand and follow the conversation . 
  who are ` we ' ? 
  if you mean nationalists , then i think the answer is clear . 
  nationalists are nationalists . 
  what kind of question is that ? 
  oh look , he thinks his flavor of nationalism is * better * . 
  hahahaha . 
   or just with a diametrically opposed opinion as yours ? 
  can you read ? 
  i 'm telling you he 's awesome , but ** the nationalist part ** makes him ** the same as pp ** when it comes to ... guess what ? 
  ** nationalism ** . 
  pp is nationalist . 
  erc is nationalist . 
  they share that . 
  i find nationalism disgusting . 
  it 's you that do n't share the same flavor of nationalism that pp likes . 
  but believe me ( or not , does n't matter , wo n't change ) ... it 's the same shit , really . 
  rufi\u00e1n is awesome , yep . 
  the only problem is that he 's just as reactionary as pp ( as he described them ) when it comes to nationalism . 
  that 's a pitty . 
  it would be my favorite otherwise . 
  but nationalism ruins people 's mind and it makes you go full idiotic without any chance of being reasonable , just like pp . 
  psc will never go full indepe .
