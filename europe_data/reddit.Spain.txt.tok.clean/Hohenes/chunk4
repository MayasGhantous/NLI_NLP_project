  my thoughts exactly . 
  but they 're just like that in every other site , meneame.net comes to mind . 
  only participating to promote their ideology . 
  it 's ok at the beginning because you think `` well , the guy just likes this shit , that 's ok '' ... but when they only and exclusively participate to do that ... . . it 's a nope , you get a downvote for astroturfing and similar crap . 
  the independentist vote in the census is not even above 50 % according to many polls . 
  we just have to wait , because participation will be incredibly high ( 85 ~ 90 % , and even more ) for sure . 
  this is not today . 
  it 's on sunday . 
  and this is not an independentist referendum , but parlamentary elections ... they 're official , though there are two parties that have joined a coalition and ask independentists to vote for them as if it was a `` yes '' to independence . 
  i almost puked as well . 
  well , you beat us in baguette-eaters and we beat you in paella-eaters . 
  then we beat you in many diverse important sports , too :p, 
  well , looks like it 's being the other way around , bud . 
  oh come on , we beat you , get over it !, 
  i mean , [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/embalse_de_pinilla.jpg ) is in the interior of spain , only 50-60km away from madrid . 
  not even the centre/south is exactly like most people thing . 
  for embarrassing ? 
  ( avergonzado/avergonzante ) yes , that 's funny . 
  but you can also say `` embarazoso '' ( embarrassing ) which has nothing to do with `` embarazada '' ( pregnant ) lol . 
  also pregnant = pre\u00f1ada if you want to avoid `` embarazada '' altogether :p, 
  really ? 
  [ antonio molina ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antonio_molina_\\ ( singer \\ ) ) , for example ? 
  it 's not a rare surname at all . 
  so a 54 % you see it like an impossible thing to campaign against and actually win . 
  then you might think independence is impossible because 50 % is against and `` only '' 42 % in favor . 
  `` the political reality of spain '' is not an argument to discuss . 
  it 's your own political opinion . 
   you also know podemos will not organize a referendum . 
  it 's political suicide here 's our difference . 
  you think that a political opinion about something = makes it true . 
  i , simply do n't . 
  and no , `` do you really think differently , are you a troll ? '', 
  is not an argument or proves anything . 
  it 's nearly an ad hominem , actually , which is just another fallacy btw . 
   * podemos is for all referendums , which in reality makes them against all . 
  * --  * argumental fallacies like the one you just pulled off are a pretty cheap trick * lol . 
  oh the irony ... 
  things like you saying that podemos is not pro-referendum is what makes you look like a meaningless troll full of incorrect assumptions and twisted information . 
  you are functioning on the basis that most people in / r/europe do n't know about spanish politics to throw all your bullshit . 
  but they know how / u/aleixasv is at this point , and wo n't believe you . 
  so quit trying so hard . 
  even if you 're right , which there is no reason at all to believe considering you 're simply predicting what 's going to happen in the next 4 years ( considering what 's been happening in spanish politics in just the last one that 's too much time ... ) , then there 's no doubt to me : breaking the law ( the constitution in this case ) using the argument of `` but they do n't want to change it '' is no argument to actually do and break the law . 
  it 's actually a very stupid and childish argument . 
  many of your own political parties in catalonia were using the argument of `` transference of power '' ( speaking of celebrating a referendum by an autonomous community ) to celebrate the 9-n with no problems . 
  you know this , the only problem is that you 're just lying and are extremely biased . 
  and you also know that the inconstitutional part is the actual act of seceeding spain , not the referendum itself . 
  it 's so annoying trying to argue with someone that simply does n't want to have a rational debate and simply manipulate everything done and said with complete bullshit . 
  the thing is that we do n't even know how the next general elections are going to end . 
  this is in just three months . 
  and also , saying it 's * impossible * it 's simply false , wrong , a lie . 
  well , you say it 's impossible and i have tell you it 's not based in your own source , that explains how you actually change the most important things of the constitution , not even the constitution itself because it 's a completely different proceeding . 
  also , you do n't need to modify the constitution in order to let catalonia have a referendum , so that 's just another false assumption ... 
  i 'd say you 're the real troll , clearly . 
  complex does n't mean impossible . 
  even if it 's hard ( because you have to convince ( the total of , or part of ) partido popular ( since it requires 2/3 of the chamber ) . 
  at least for now , we really do n't know how it 's going to look after december 's general elections . 
  using your own source , it 's said it 's complex because it requires two different legislatures and two different votations . 
  that may be shitty but does n't make it impossible . 
  so you 're wrong , again . 
   that text is basically impossible to change it 's not . 
  the problem is ** current politics ** , from pp very particularly ( most probably about to change , at least in government ) . 
  the constituion * per se * is perfectly modificable . 
  independentists are just pushing really hard because with pp you have no other choice , it 's that or nothing changes . 
  not all andalucians , some of them ( in the east mostly ) do the contrary : pronounce every s as z ( as in / th / from month ) ... that 's the lisp that non-spanish talk about , but they 're only a few . 
  the rest of spain , or most at least , pronounce c and z as / th / and s as ... well , s. latin america is completely different and they totally do n't have / th / sound in c and z. 
  i see , thanks for sharing your view , enjoy the stay and eat a lot of jam\u00f3n !, 
  welcome then !, 
  i 'm gay myself and if you 're gay i totally understand why would you want to flee serbia , things look very ugly there to me . 
  i 'm a bit radical with this kind of issues regarding tolerance and `` western '' values , so i have a really bad opinion about serbia joinin the eu ( i think we should n't let serbia join until the society advance about homosexuality and other issues there ) . 
  i know inside the eu there are some more countries that are also known because a noticeable part of its society tend to have an homophobic mind , but letting more countries join with that problem does n't seem a solution to me . 
  anyway , welcome , i 'm spaniard so i can tell you gay marriage here has really really helped to normalize a bit the things . 
  as always , there 's still a lot to do , but the future looks brighter than ever . 
  statistics say gay people spend more money and have higher salaries on average . 
  gay tourists spend 30 % more than the average , according to / u/maigol7 source . 
  agreed , best time to be alive . 
  so , their brain is a waste you say ? 
  your brain is a waste of space . 
  good for russia . 
  not the case of catalonia though . 
  nothing would happen ... all of this is to put pressure to do an actual referendum . 
  you need a really big majority to declare an unilateral independence , and independentists simply do n't have that big majority . 
  sure a referendum should decide that ... but polls are also a thing that lets you know what the people think , in a trend . 
  in any case , let 's just wait two weeks . 
  it 's all bla bla bla now , we need to see what the catalans vote in their regional elections . 
  obviously by popular vote because of d'hondt . 
  independentists are smart enough to know that they ca n't secede with like 45 % of the votes even if that gets you a majority in the parliament because of the electoral system . 
  it would be a political suicide . 
  catalonia is not and has never been a colony though . 
  it 's mainland spain . 
  heh , did n't know that . 
  i do n't get it . 
  is it a political classic right-wing/left-wing joke ? 
  i really do n't know , mediterranean diet is not really a thing anymore ... not since globalization at least , but we do really like our olive oil . 
  almost never use butter to cook !, 
  because we like to slap our own ass cheeks just for the pleasure . 
  ask the italians , they like to do that very often too . 
  it 's our fetish . 
  more important than living generally better and more years ? 
  nooo !, 
  actually i do n't want to die !,
