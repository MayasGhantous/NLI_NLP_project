  their role in the catalan society is to try and offer something that can lead to a third way or trying to be a soft transition between indepes and unionists/autonomists . 
  if they stop representing that , psc will disappear or will just be another small indepe party and podemos will take their place , where there are softcore independentists , but the party is not . 
   i 've gotten the impression that its the pp and the independence movement need eachother to gain votes you 're not wrong and this is said by podemos and other parties and people in spain . 
  they feedback each other . 
  yep . 
  pp fuels this thing . 
  if pp is out , then this thing is probably going to end soon . 
  independentism will never disappear completely though . 
  but this part of the game will be over . 
  i would n't say we wo n't have a pacted referendum in a future though , \u00e0 la canada . 
  i 'd say zero . 
  but the institutional clash is real . 
   boaty mcboatface - unique naval unit just because rrs [ blas de lezo ] ( http://www.badassoftheweek.com/blasdelezo.html ) was banned from the game . 
  was just too cool for england and their navy . 
  [ for salty the downvoters ] ( https://www.thespainreport.com/newsitems/545-160329120728-update-nerc-deletes-offensive-spanish-admiral-blas-de-lezo-as-name-for-new-british-ship ) , 
  i can fap to this, 
  that requires planning for the future more than 4 years after the elections and our politicians do n't know how to do that . 
  we need to stop intoxicating our world and for now only habitat available so much . 
  thank you , we like all of our spanish regions to be prosperous . 
  greetings from spain and in the name of many catalan compatriots . 
  well ... ... it kind of is . 
  believe it or not , it has improven * vastly * in the last 5-10 years .

  well , that 's the consolation prize , i guess . 
  i 'm obviously joking , it 's a disaster and makes me very sad . 
  all these poor iberian lynx in southern portugal and southern spain :'(,

  bienvenidos a [ 2005 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/same-sex_marriage_in_spain ) , llanitos . 
  hillary is the worse choice . 
  does n't check out . 
  * ding , ding , ding * ... the case is closed . 
   how the spanish think are they the best it 's funny because we * really * hate ourselves and we are always prone to consider ourselves inferior to anything we compare . 
  even if it 's far from the truth . 
  only the italians are worse than us when it comes to throw ourselves some shit , and the french are kinda like us as well . 
  i thought that was more of a eastern thing ? 
  are you kidding ? 
  portuguese people are usually mocked as being `` towel-sellers '' at the border . 
  there are many jokes around that xd and the portuguese have a saying that `` from spain , nothing good comes '' or something like that . 
  so go figure out . 
  of course it 's no longer `` checoslov\u00e1quia '' because it is `` checoslovaquia '' , you filthy whore . 
  i call it bohemia . 
  but they got nerfed hard in eu4 . 
  used to be a powerhouse able to fight austria in eu3 . 
  but in all seriourness ... 
  some people use `` chequia '' , actually . 
  but mainly old people/some teachers . 
  young people and the news talk about `` rep\u00fablica checa '' . 
  the northern european countries do n't appear here , and they ca n't just do n't appear or `` look bad '' against other second level countries for them , like spain or poland . 
  so this will be rightfully downvoted , 
  same country , really . 
  and bad for everyone else because we get to keep the rajoy , bruh . 
  of course , just after [ this shit ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20150818/54435885864/mujer-arma-pato-empaitada-roses.html ) happened and it went viral all over spain . 
  but that was way later than the bullfight ban , mate . 
  of course i was downvoted in my previous comment ... the truth is something that catalan independentists ca n't stand . 
  that 's what i tried to imply when i said that they 're quite diverse . 
  the thing is that in latinoamerica is easy to find mestizos ( native americans mixed with europeans ) , that have different features and skin tones than spaniards , by the fact that they 're mixed . 
  i died with that last photo . 
  [ this is the one i was looking for . 
  of course . 
  the ban itself was a nationalistic , anti-spanish move . 
  they did n't ban correbous and shit like that . 
  they even maintained that barbaric empaitada d'\u00e0necs in roses . 
  whoever says that was * only * because of the animal abuse is outright lying or just a full ignorant . 
  fucking nationalism is disgusting . 
  makes people stupid and irrational , quite like religion . 
   i was more into the russian [ \\ ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 \\ ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eern6hz.jpg ), 
   the canary islands banned bullfighting in 1991 not exactly . 
  the canarias banned `` blood-related shows/spectacles with animals '' , which in essence banned bullfightning ... but it 's not a direct quote on that , contrary to the catalan legislation on the issue . 
  also , catalu\u00f1a did n't ban their own bull-torturing shitty games ( as shitty as corridas ) . 
  it was a political/ideological decision , mostly . 
  that 's the first time i hear that . 
  spanish people are diverse , many kind of peoples have been in the peninsula , but today our genetics have nothing to do with north african peoples . 
  they 're much more related to where the celtic groups are in w. europe . 
  it 's ok if it was true , not like it would change something . 
  it just is n't . 
  trust me , you do n't find people that 's been here that says madrid is warm in winter ... 
  surely we do n't have -20 \u00bac winters like in some places of europe . 
  but that does n't mean it 's warm here . 
  your danish friend is blind dude xd, 
  those temps are not normal . 
  they 're 6-8\u00bac above of what it should be by this time of the year . 
  spain has 4 seasons bro :p only exception in the canarias , maybe . 
   a few people that sincerely thought that spaniards were like mulattos  people with degrees . 
  does n't mean they were educated enough . 
  they definitely do n't understand what mulato means . 
  i know a lot of them , as north as northern sweden . 
  they can tell a spaniard apart from northern europeans because we have more brown-ish hair and dark brown eyes more often . 
  this can be applied to other southern european countries . 
  but there 's definitely no significant skin tone difference compared to the french , for example . 
  we can of course find tanned spaniards more easily than you find tanned germans , though . 
  but even a tanned spaniard is easily recognised as such ( it 's not like the rest of features changed because of the tan ) . 
  a different style would help ( right now it 's sad ) . 
  and using the subreddit for something else than just giving tourism advice . 
  the fact that most mods are missing and not using reddit at all for months is also another reason . 
  at least that 's how i remember it . 
  honestly , i 'd like to be a neet and just do my hobbies and activities . 
  i just ca n't afford it . 
  maybe i would not skip the education part though , even if it was only in an autodidactic way . 
  fucking boring and empty .
