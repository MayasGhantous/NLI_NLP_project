  why not extradition to hell . 
  these studies are always so catastrophic . 
  they are super irrelevant . 
  demographic studies are only relevant in a year or two span ... because you ca n't predict migration movements . 
  there could be a huge wave of people coming to spain . 
  we went from 30-35 m to almost 50 m in less than 20 years , and no one predicted it . 
  actually , the old predictions said we would be 35-40 m by now ... well we are 47 . 
  in 2050 spain might be a 100 million powerhouse country . 
  or a 20 million one with very old people . 
  no one fucking knows . 
  do n't you find us too loud when in public ? 
  sometimes i feel some people use that in a xenophobic way ... because you can find very loud people in spain , but also the contrary . 
   will keep living their `` ni-ni '' ( do n't ( `` ni '' ) work-don ' t ( `` ni '' ) study ) the word you 're looking for is neet ( not in employment , education or training ), 
  to be honest it 's easy to see the difference between spanish and non-spanish . 
  spanish people are closer to french/italian/belgian people in their hair/skin tone . 
  spanish-speaking american people are most of the time different ( and quite diverse ) . 
   progress is not linear sooooo many people that do n't understand this . 
  we could be into something even bigger than wwii in a few years yet we think that 's not possible anymore . 
  well i actually think it 's actually likely to happen .

  dude . 
  shuddup , infidel , you belong to us . 
  haraaaam, 
   islamic spain ** oh god i almost had a heart attack **, 
  over 3 % growth . 
  and that 's with around 19 % unemployment . 
   almodovar  well-made movies pick one . 
  and i 'm saying that most countries in their civil law have marriage differentiated from other rights . 
  you do n't have the same rights in a civil partnership than in marriage legally in spain . 
  that 's why in 2005 more than 80 % of the population was in favor of a simple change in our civil code that allowed people of the same sex to marry eachother . 
  and today that support is over 90 % . 
  that 's a huge majority that do n't have the same concept of marriage that you do . 
  as long as civil law treats marriage as something different with different rights and dutties ... there will always be people asking for their rights . 
  even if it collides with your ancient concept of marriage . 
  if you do n't understand this it 's not up to me to teach you . 
   why do you want to hijack the term ? 
  who hijacked the term in first place ? 
  marriage is not a catholic concept . 
   the thing is that the marriage is only reliable way to reproduce the whole society ... based on your own concept of marriage . 
  because by no means it is a necessary step to procreate . 
  the ** actual ** thing is that in the civil law marriage has attached some legal issues that most of the time ca n't be arranged by other means . 
  and this is what we 're talking about . 
  i do n't care about your philosophical/moral/religious concept of marriage . 
  i 'm talking about law . 
  they do n't think `` being gay is bad '' * alone * ... they think `` you should not have the same rights that i do '' . 
  yes , they 're fucking idiotic . 
  oh of course not ... haha , they 're not ... . . right ? 
  ... ... ... ... . right ? 
   you want special treatment . 
  which one ? 
  care to explain ? 
  because all i 'm saying is that if they 're free to think that i should have less rights than them , i 'm free to think that the problem is theirs , not mine . 
   the thing is , that you already have all the rights they have yes , i do have them * now * , and not thanks to them ... it was actually ** despite ** them . 
  if it was for them , i would n't have those rights that they claim and enjoy for themselves . 
  the only wrong approach is to think i should n't marry another person freely because it 's against * their * moral . 
  fuck that , and fuck them . 
  i do n't think of france as a shady place where you have to watch out 24/7 . 
  i live in spain , and feel very safe here ... basically everywhere . 
  i do n't expect less from france , even if spain is kinda one of the best places for this kind of thing ( although we still have attacks and so on ... that simply do n't disappear that easily ) . 
  my opinion about their opinion is that they have something wrong in their mind , what if i just want to think like that ? 
  they think that i should not have the rights that they have . 
  that i should have less rights than them . 
  i should be less free . 
  and you defend their right to think like that . 
  why not defend my right to think that the only problem is theirs ? 
  it 's just fair . 
  that sounds very iberian :p, 
  what a bunch of idiots . 
  if spain is irrelevant it would n't make the news when we are about to collapse , like in 2012 . 
  because if spain collapsed , the 4th economy in the eurozone would have been collapsed , and it could have caused a domino effect . 
  heck , even greece was about to trigger a domino effect . 
  this is weird . 
  i 've seen it quite normal that these kind of people reject equality and common sense and go on a demonstration against other 's peoples freedom ... but that 's it , the law gets approved ( because it 's fucking common sense ) and their voice disappear forever . 
  that 's how it 's been in spain with the gay marriage more than 10 years ago by now . 
  but france has already passed the law , the world did n't collapse , the devil did n't come ... and they reappear ? 
  this is weird . 
  yep and it was fucking expensive , too . 
  spain is over 10 times bigger tho, 
  you think it was invited out of pity or because it was the 8th biggest economy in the world when it was invited ( in 2008 ) ? 
  because it 's strange to think that the 8th biggest economy is not relevant among the top 20 economies ... 
  everything you said are just plain lies . 
  first : yes , the g20 is exactly the top 20 economies , i 'll quote from the wiki :  the g20 ( or g-20 or group of twenty ) is an international forum for the governments and central bank governors from 20 major economies secondly : spain is a permanent member of g20 , a seat that was permanently ceded by france , and now belongs to spain . 
  and last but not least : if you think the 12th biggest economy in the world is not among the 20 most influential countries then you 're just wrong . 
  well we * are * united . 
  we just have folks that think that we should n't \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  and spain is in the g20 ( it would be crazy to leave the 12th biggest economy in the world out of the ... 20 biggest economies of the world ) . 
  well you are basing it in facts that are not true . 
  maybe look for other reasons to think of spain as a shitty country if that 's how you want to set up your mind like that in first place and i might agree with you when the reasons are given . 
  for example you could say we have a third-world unemployment rate ... it 's the truth . 
  but the other reasons you mentioned ? 
  not at all . 
  still with that , i 'd prefer a country like spain over almost any other place in the world ... with good reasons too . 
  i could n't say the same about russia because ( in my own experience ) i might get even killed because of my orientation , whereas in spain i feel very safe and comfortable . 
  things are much more fucked up there . 
  sempre !, 
  there are shitty things , not everything is shitty . 
  from what you said , there are at least two ( internet & infraestructures ) that are [ plain wrong ] ( http://www3.weforum.org/docs/img/wef_gcr2014-15_infrastructure_image.png ) . 
  there are [ other examples ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1325793/original.jpg ) . 
  when you say they 're kind of shit , you mean there are parts of the country that are shit . 
  [ not everything is shit ] ( http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/analytics/images/text/150508_touris_rank2015.jpg ) if you are still relevant [ in many aspects ] ( http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/wps/portal/web/rielcano_en/contenido?wcm_global_context=/elcano/elcano_in/zonas_in/ari52-2014-chislett-spain-leads-world-market-for-infrastructure-development ) .
