  you have a shit-ton of tiny little countries or petrol-driven middle east economies that boost that gdp per capita for them , hence why we rank `` low '' . 
  france and spain are countries that should compare between countries of the same nature . 
  we should n't compare to countries like andorra or luxembourg , because we do n't aim to be tiny little tax haven places . 
  and you earnt more in the us , but you surely did n't have the welfare coverage or healthcare system that we enjoy in countries like spain , france , italy ... etc. 
  til france is a poor country :| seriously , france and spain are n't poor countries . 
  crisis and stagnation ? 
  ok , but we are not turning into underdeveloped shit holes because of this . 
  if spain and france are poor countries i do n't know what the rest of the world is . 
  we 're actually very lucky having being bornt randomly in this side of the planet . 
  [ we are starting a party on both sides of la raya/a raia ] ( http://www.movimentopartidoiberico.com/home.php ) . 
  well , you do n't hear the same news today . 
  are you saying it 's the same like in 2012 , the worst year by far ? 
  it was the case 40-50 years ago . 
  not today . 
  the difference between spain and france today are not big in relative numbers . 
  check the [ previous comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/57qcim/why_is_european_country/d8u5c1j ) for actual data . 
  oh damn does that mean i 'm poor now ? 
  well yeah , but * precisely * because of that i see the iberian union a way out to spanish territorial issues . 
  obviously this would kill madrid centralism ... but that 's not bad . 
  madrid will survive and still be relevant . 
  you have n't heard about independentism in spain right !? 
  they 're probably worse than that xd, 
  so you think the usa in 2006 was a rich country , and in 2008 was a poor country because there was `` crisis '' ... right . 
  i think the problem is yours to be honest . 
  you have to learn that an economic crisis affect rich countries and does n't mean they stop being developed ... d'oh . 
  that 's what i meant . 
  and debt . 
  and deficit . 
  and corruption . 
  and ... why do you think i try to hide that shit ? 
   nobody fucking drives on them since they are all tollroads  the only people using your autobahns are tourists . 
  everybody else takes the small roads this is simply not true . 
  tolls are common around barcelona ... and that 's it . 
  there are a few more that are circunvent of the existing network but they 're actually not used and they 're broke ( in a financial point of view ) , like around madrid . 
  [ the green ones are tollroads ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-abis7skwqzq/t3_d1pyw6mi/aaaaaaaahcq/sdpfizdvv7o/s1600/13+mapa_carreteras.jpg ) . 
  please , do n't spread incorrect information . 
  many portuguese people are super against it ( sad ) , and many spanish people just do n't care about portugal ( very sad ) i do care though , so i hope one day it becomes true . 
  i 've been around northern italy , france and belgium , and i was surprised to see our road infraestructure had nothing to envy them . 
  actually , northern italy looked poorer from this point of view , even if they have a higher gdp per capita than us . 
  i 'll give you one , and just one advice for the next time : you 're trying too hard , it does n't help . 
  my question to you remained unasnwered , so i have nothing else left to talk with you , since you 're just bringing random shit up . 
  easily one of the best . 
  port infraestructure is hard to compete with the netherlands , but railroads ? 
  better than you . 
  roads ? 
  pretty equal . 
  have you been to spain ? 
  ca n't argue about bycicle infraestructure though , lol . 
  i do n't think americans thought of spain as a poor country in 2007 or 2006 ( right before the crisis ) , because i do n't think the average person in america is/was informed about spanish gdp per capita . 
  i think it has more to do with the crisis and all the news about spain , the unemployment rate and the eurocrisis that hit very hard for us ( and portugal , italy , greece , ireland ... ) . 
  that 's what i think at least . 
  so you think spain is a poor country and not on par with the rest of europe ? 
  because that 's what the point was about . 
  if we talked about unemployment rate it would be a different story . 
  if we talked about inefficient administration we would be talking about what you 're talking about . 
  but you 're mixing shit up , and this is why it 's not serious . 
  all i said is that portugal and spain are not poor countries , that they could rank higher and are in mediocre positions among other wealthy countries , but that in no way spain or portugal are poor countries . 
  you will have a hard time trying to find someone talking about south korea like a poor country , yet it has a lower gdp per capita than spain . 
  the difference between you and me is not the amount of flag waving . 
  it 's that you bring bad headlines about spain no matter what the topic is about because you ca n't say `` spain is a poor country not belonging to the group of wealthy/developed countries '' . 
  and that 's the itch you need to scratch . 
  honestly they are very small but if you look around it 's very easy to find something that has shipped from hk . 
  they are a vast international hub and that 's probably not cheap to maintain . 
  i 'm talking about their port infraestructures alone , of course , although that needs to be well connected with the mainland . 
  but what does judicial independence have to do with infraestructures ? 
  you just looked up `` rodalies '' and `` despilfarro '' in google , you are using the same argument in at least 6 links you posted ... do you see why ca n't you be taken seriously ? 
  not proud of being at the bottom ( also i do n't think we are , otherwise south korea or new zealand are also shitty poor countries , which they do n't . 
  ) , but i agree we need a different and better government . 
  oh , and i was refering to portugal , not spain , you should read better . 
  but really , posting a bunch of links that you have n't read and they talk about the same case because you did a lazy search is not winning an argument . 
  it simply shows that you have an irrational itch you need to scratch from time to time . 
  pretty much . 
  but you do n't , yet ... https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/07/these-countries-have-the-best-infrastructure/ top 9 worldwide , fair enough . 
  have you moved around europe and compared ? 
  because i would believe you if you said `` no . '', 
  i doubt we have better infraestructrures than nl in regards to ports and probably roads as well . 
  but overall , spain ranks very high in roads as well , and railroad infraestructure . 
  we are at a disadvantage too , since netherlands is very flat , but spain [ is quite mountainous ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/spain_topo.jpg ) , which makes this shit really , really expensive . 
  or way too many ( bad ) news about spain during the crisis . 
  honestly i do n't care that much , this is because the crisis , even if we maintain the same gdp per capita already prior to the crisis . 
  people is usually badly informed , that 's why they look shit up in google . 
  [ brother !, 
  i mean , we might be partially at fault for that . 
  some data : ** portugal ** gdp per capita : ** 21,961 usd ** south korea gdp per capita : 25,022 usd ** spain ** gdp per capita : ** 30,587 usd ** france gdp per capita : 41,329 usd ^ ^ * all * ^ ^ * data * ^ ^ * from * ^^*tradingeconomics.com * disclaimer : i do n't think portugal is poor ( got a downvote a minute later from posting real data , lol ) . 
  is it at the bottom of the rich countries ? 
  sure , but still part of the rich countries . 
  spain is also not at the top exactly , but we have probably the best infraestructures in w. europe , for example . 
  gdp per capita is not always the best index . 
  are you saying we are naturally close to brits !? 
  i 'm getting dizzy . 
  nah , the butthurtness of the anglogermano/northerner users of / r/europe have stated that this is a bullshit graph where spain does n't belong at the top . 
  the nordics and canada are not at the top of the list while spain is , so it must be wrong . 
  this is an invalid study that they 've made and my reddit comment can refutate it in 30 seconds of commenting . 
  everything is restored now !, 
  that 's nice xd, 
  we have a couple bridges exactly like that one in spain too ... why the french one and not the spanish ones ? 
  because the one in the bill is not any of those . 
  those are nonexistent structures in order not to tilt any country . 
  why would france gets to be in euro bills but not spain or italy or germany . 
  that 's why .
