  yup , it is also one of the most dangerous in the world ( like etna ) . 
  last big explosion was ~ 300 years ago . 
  today would be catastrophic though . 
  teide maybe ? 
  yes , a little more easy have it the us citizens . 
  that 's why i said it is n't much better . 
  it is * a bit * better . 
  because we 're obviously talking about geopolitics and national interests . 
  in that regard , there 's virtually zero differences . 
  they 're all equally hypocrites . 
   ok til that spain is the 2nd biggest country in the eu after france dude , really ? 
  come on ... spain is a big country ( to european standards ), 
  i do n't think the us is much better than russia or china . 
  we just happen to be on their side . 
  i do n't want to defend us interests , just europe 's . 
  a federation with just catalonia but not with the rest of spain ? 
  that 's strange . 
  now that you 're at it ... 
   speak for yourself . 
  that 's exactly what i did , what 's wrong with you lol . 
  are you a valencian independentist or a valencian pan-catalanist ? 
  i 've yet to know a valencian independentist . 
   no reason to only pick one yes , big reason : i do n't want to depend on the usa for my own defense . 
  i do n't want us bases in my country . 
  i mean if those were real figures we would no longer be first-world countries , which is not the case . 
  i wished . 
  because i might be one lucky mofo , but i 've never been unemployed , and since i left fp ( formaci\u00f3n profesional , which is the uni alternative in spain after high scool and bachillerato ) during the crisis i was able to find and stay in my position . 
  and that 's not the only thing , but also happened to most of my ex classmates . 
  and this coming from a humble neighbourhood in the suburbs of a big city . 
  i do n't know if it 's just my field ( it ) , but so far the only thing i have to complain about is the salary ... 
  i could n't save any money if it were n't because i 'm still living with my parents . 
  it 's being lowered at least , we 've seen 50 + percent cases , we 're now around 35-40 % if i 'm not mistaken . 
  although in my particular experience things are n't as bad as the figures suggest . 
  from own experience and surroundings . 
  thank you !!, 
  and sorry for our government not recognising you : / internal politics and all that shit ... 
  it 's little portion compared to [ the whole sistema central ] ( http://www.entrecumbres.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sistema-central-sierras.png ) , that includes a part in portugal . 
  well , i guess for historical reasons . 
  i know right ? 
  but to be honest madrid is the truly shit triangle . 
  i mean , it 's ... [ it 's a fucking triangle ] ( http://www.digiatlas.com/ejem1/cdad_madrid_fis.jpg ) . 
  which is a natural consequence due to human migration ... not because the conquistadores were so awful they were injecting natives with smallpox vials . 
  i do n't know why the downvotes to / u/mate77 if we 're just being a bit cheeky though . 
  catalonia is shit triangle lol, 
  honestly , it was another time . 
  our societies are not proud of that and we can call you our friends because we would never dare to do such a thing in this day . 
  hahahahaha , yep, 
  ah well , i misunderstood the whole story then . 
  good for the french and spanish police then . 
  https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/santa_mar%c3%ada_ ( f-81 ), 
  [ still known like that ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/d%c3%ada_de_la_raza ) in many american countries , actually . 
  it sounds very supremacist , but spain was n't actually the worst colonial power out there , contrary to what the spanish black legend says . 
  in reality , it was one if not the most * least bad * . 
  i hope you 're kidding or otherwise you do n't really know who is hillary liar clinton . 
  it 's ok but why do n't they simply disband completely ? 
  this is a symbolic move , not a real move to me . 
  now we need another government that can end this thing with some talks too , because they refuse right now . 
  no special thread like the rest because that would only get me more downvotes from the haters , just a heads up : enjoy the free day !, 
  although it 's a bit shitty with [ all that rain ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pj0ey5z.png ) :(, 
  we do n't care that much . 
  they both are bad decisions so we already know the result . 
  you have an example in this particular thread , no need to look for another . 
  right in [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/56dm1c/as_a_fellow_european_i_feel_im_no_longer_welcome/d8j2s5o ) answer to the op . 
  well , we could be stronger within the eu itself . 
  being on par with france and germany ( spain alone is not entirely on par with them , although it 's a major player in the eu , like italy ) . 
  that would be useful . 
  that , plus maybe a solution to spain 's territorial problems , even if this is more a selfish motivation ( it would n't matter to portugal 's interests ) even stronger ties between the two countries would probably make portuguese economy flourish though , considering spain is , by a huge difference , the portuguese main client for its exports (  20 % ) and above 30 % imports come from spain . 
  three times more than the second . 
  i still cry too, 
  i mean , who does n't like a big fat san jacobo from time to time . 
  [ the hypothetical country that would be the result of a republican , federated union of spain & portugal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iberian_federalism ) . 
   when if ever did we make anything not war related better ? 
  ehm , the eu ? 
  it is the result of the best and longest peace time in europe , with incredibly high amounts of wealth generation and welfare state building . 
  the eu was n't built during war time . 
  it was a solution to war , actually . 
  and so far it worked . 
  but i prefer to unite with the rest of europeans on a big family common group that can end up making something better . 
  totally agreed , fellow iberian . 
   but i ca n't enjoy roaming this sub anymore , as me and my countrymen are consistently stereotyped and attacked . 
  so i guess you now understand how us southern europeans felt all these years in this sub , filled with way too many bitter northern europeans sticked to their stereotyped ideas . 
  it 's very shitty , i agree . 
  yeah ... johan screwed up this game hard over the years/patches . 
  they have been consistenly nerfing annexing , diploannexation , pus and incrementing the cost of taking just a single fucking province . 
  now you fight like a fucking world war for just a province that takes almost all your warscore , gives you all the badboy/infamy/ae in the world and can only be made every 10-15 years . 
  i do n't really play eu anymore because this and that shitty `` i do n't give a fuck about singleplayer '' phrase he regurgitated in the official forums . 
  it 's sad how one asshole can ruin this game . 
   you are ** still ** pirates arent you implying they could have stopped being pirates sometime . 
   falklands 1982 except spain is not argentina 1982 . 
  the uk hardly will be able to do a shit , pretty much like spain . 
  no matter how nationalistic you feel about your little turf . 
  plus it 's stupid to think of spain inaviding gibraltar . 
  very stupid . 
  right now i 'm culturally assimilating basque provinces into the castilian primary culture . 
  zero . 
  regrets . 
  i only claim it 's propaganda when used in internal affairs , not international context , yes . 
  because it 's only used in that kind of context . 
  you must understand this before we can continue talking , if you 're able to . 
  same reason why we do n't say `` barcelona '' when speaking of the catalan government .
