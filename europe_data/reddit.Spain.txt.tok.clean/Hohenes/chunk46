  and the vast majority of us do n't take siestas , these stereotypes are ridiculous . 
  i would n't even think of swedish or danes as stupid barbarians living in huts , because it 's not true . 
  it sounds ridiculous because it 's not common to mock them like that , but mocking spanish is accepted so it 's rewarded , even if it 's just ridiculous . 
  the kind of insulting/disrespectful stereotypes that actually do n't show the reality . 
  we could portrait most of the world as uncivilized barbarians while we were sitting as the world superpower for centuries , because that actually happened . 
  but this ? 
  it 's not even showing the reality . 
  / r/mexico, 
  i get it , but it still sounds really weird . 
  i cri eveyr taimu when getting downvoted . 
   pontemerda dude . 
  that 's nice , but we care even less about reddit subscribers !, 
  yep , these tiny tax heavens have higher gdp per capita than spain . 
  and * much * higher than portugal . 
  spanish people use men\u00e9ame and other similar media instead . 
  reddit is not known in spain , but we 're still the bigger , wealthier country in the iberian peninsula . 
  how would you remove the di\u00e9resis in verg\u00fcenza ? 
   galician is actually the most spoken language in galicia only in rural areas . 
  and there 's like a 15-20 % of galicians that do n't speak it at all . 
  mostly in cities , yeah . 
  ** make new spain great again **, 
  ah , so you 're all terrible at that then , with those monstrous r 's . 
  not all galicians speak galician . 
  spanish is overwhelmingly present over galician in galicia . 
  well , i can agree with b and v , but j and g are different : juerga , garaje ... g and j represent different sounds there . 
  agreed , but saying that \u00d1 does n't exist in basque is just plain wrong . 
  is it taken from spanish instead of being part of basque originally ? 
  yeah , and so do many words in spanish that come from basque . 
  it 's impossible to not be influenced . 
  why would you reject that kind of cultural exchanges that actually makes the language more rich ? 
  it would surprise me if you said you were basque and yet did n't know that the letter '' \u00f1 '' is indeed part of the basque alphabet . 
  https://eu.wikipedia.org/wiki/euskal_alfabetoa also , `` no \u00f1 '' and `` only in some words '' is the contrary of eachother . 
  ikurri\u00f1a is not a spanish word . 
  of course you have it , in your most used language in catalonia \u2665 also , galicians and basques are smart enough and have take it for their own language . 
   shit ... 
  i think the spaniards are taking their siesta . 
   portugal # 1 hue hue hue hue ? 
  do n't play with my mind like that . 
  such a rollercoaster of thoughts . 
  well that makes sense . 
  teleespe ( now telecifuentes ) is even worse . 
  i do n't meant it that way , in the sense that they 're corrupted . 
  i mean , you 'll always find `` that guy '' ( bit more common in here i guess , and even much more in eastern countries ) , but i was refering to not being transparent enough with these kind of issues ( swedish is very unpopular among finns , but politicians ignore the will of the people just to maintain the statu quo ) . 
  i thought your politicians were better than that . 
  but again , everything ` nordic ' has this false clich\u00e9 that everything is good so i might be biased as well . 
  i 've met swedish people that can speak spanish , actually . 
  one of my friends is a swede that happened to really like spanish and now he speaks it fluently . 
  honestly i do n't find it very weird , it 's a global language , not like italian ( a few tens of million speakers in europe like spanish , but only in europe ) . 
  yes , but i think he was joking ? 
  i think it was just a joke and you misunderstood / u/albertogw instead . 
   otherwise the basque language would be in the same situation as asturian or aragonese doubtful . 
  all regional languages but spanish were persecuted under our most recent dictatorship , but the asturian and aragonese were already at the edge of extinction before that ... actually , many many years before that . 
  basque language was n't . 
  nationalism in the xix century helped the basque language in a way that the aragonese and asturian languages never would have dreamed . 
  again , believe it or not , not everything good or bad that happens in spain is because `` madrid '' ( poor madrilenians always having * pitos en los o\u00eddos * ) and the spanish central government . 
  believe it or not , you have a much greater chance with spain than with france with that . 
  france is the ultimate killer of peripheral regions and identities in its own territory . 
  the french basques do n't have nearly a one percent the autonomy that the spanish basque country has . 
  i do n't think pp is that much better . 
  plus pp de galicia is so fucking populist . 
  they are not galician nationalist but they almost act like them so they can get every vote . 
  what i do n't understand is how can galicians support pp so much ( well , that can be applied to basically half of spain ) . 
  at least i 'm happy we got rid of pp in the city of madrid . 
  that 's why he said  i wish i could say, 
  he 's talking about pp . 
  honestly , euskadi has little to gain from being independent , having control over your own taxes and being in an privileged position where the region receives public investment from the rest of spain but barely participates in the distribution of wealth like the rest of autonomous communities . 
  actually , euskadi would lose more stuff than the potential gains . 
  no wonder not so many people support it , even with the strong basque identity . 
  i do n't know if urkullu is an independentist himself , but it 's a fact that pnv is not seeking independence . 
  they speak of co-sovereignity , which is contrary to independence , but it 's also a slightly different status ( not like it would be huge different ) to what we 've got today . 
  also , i 'm not sure to what point he 's claiming ( if ever did ) to be pro-independence just ... `` de cara a la galer\u00eda '' . 
  exactly . 
  which does n't make him an independentist . 
  just like podemos is not independentist but it 's pro-referendum . 
  there 's a big difference between seeking independence and not oposing direct democracy . 
  so your statement is misleading . 
  urkullu does n't seek independence ... and that 's it , no need to add `` unilaterally '' as a surname . 
  it 's also a very weird way to categorize a party if you do n't categorize the others the same way . 
  like if you wanted to show us a bit of your agenda . 
   no seeking independence unilaterally no seeking independence ... period . 
  at least , that 's what urkullu has been saying in recent interviews . 
  otherwise pnv would n't have won so many votes , he gained a lot of centrist , constitutionalist voters and people that feel both basque and spanish just naturally . 
  also , only around ~ 30 % support independence in the basque country . 
  welp , i get notifications so ...  here 's another one to grind some more downvotes , hah !, 
  the downvotes of butthurt brits and other tards for opinions contrary to theirs in this one is ** so ** cute \u2665 i tell you a little secret : spaniards do n't give a fuck about gibraltar . 
  it 's an irrelevant little town . 
  only officials speak about them . 
  well this is the third election for you in * less * than a year xd ( unless , you know , you 're in the french basque country ) you might even be called to go for a fourth one : /, 
  k . some people find it annoying that i do n't give a fuck about a 30,000 inhabitant town in southern europe , hahahahaha . 
  keep downvoting tards , it * actually * makes me laugh . 
  so first calls to respect the peoples right to decide , just to say that something wo n't happen at all , `` never '' , because he apparently decided it , instead of the people . 
  this one is retarded lol . 
  it 's not even relevant . 
  it 's a fucking village . 
  so tired of elections . 
  and to think we are closer and closer to third general elections in a year ... sigh . 
  congrats fellow armenians !, 
  but i respectfully disagree of this belonging to / r/europe, 
  nationalism is very alive . 
  heck , look at scotland or catalonia .
