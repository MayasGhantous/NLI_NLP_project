  ever !, 
  gib rosell\u00f3n back 1659 never 4get, 
  i do n't know , spanish-speaking internet is big ... but it 's also quite useless ... most of the stuff you find are simply translations from the english-speaking internet , but with just more bullshit , more ads , and more inaccurate information . 
  it 's like taringa and yahoo respuestas are everywhere . 
  i just navigate the web in english , google everything in english and keep spanish only for the local news and not much else . 
  sad but that 's how it is . 
  also , 99 % of the spanish youtubers are crap , and just coming 1-2 years later from english-speaking ones , as usual . 
  : broken2 :, 
  bitch please , quality of life and life expectancy  a few points more of gdp per capita . 
  deal !, 
  you must totally agree with the immense majority of the spanish people then because wert is and has been the most hated minister ever and had like a 10 % popularity or so . 
  i mean , that 's even low for rajoy ... who is not that far from there either way . 
  and by the way ,  public elected politician says something bad in madrid -  `` madrit '' is threatening the catalan culture and language . 
    public elected politican says something bad in catalonia -  oh he 's a retard , plus he did n't mean that . 
  we are n't like that . 
  i support the referendum idea . 
  best way to make sure spain and its peoples go forward instead of about to collapse again . 
  also , hopefully it will alleviate the increasing hatred . 
  `` you always hear about people insulting catalans , basques ... '' well , you always hear about a lot of things , and there 's even the stereotype that `` in madrid , all of them are fachas '' ... you 're falling in the same argument you 're critizing by generalizing about the spaniards ... you think those that insult the basques and catalans and generalize about the terrorist thing are wrong ? 
  then you are too when generalizing about the castillians or the spaniards , in general . 
  it 's also insulting even if you think it 's not . 
  let 's stop for a moment there . 
  i know catalonia , and know quite a few ( now still friends with em ) . 
  even one of the most known independentist leader 's is [ david fernandez \\ ( cup \\ ) from castillian origin . 
  ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_fern%c3%a0ndez ), 
  gdp per capita basques are # 1 ( and navarre ) then madrid , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  some of you want independence , yes . 
  your finances are n't going to magically improve , and your high unemployment rate is not going to disappear even if you were independent beforehand . 
  you 're basically saying everything bad it 's been happening in catalonia is because the rest of spain . 
  oh and catalan is in danger now ... like spanish is like the right-wingers say or what ? 
  stop the bullshit already , noone buys it anymore . 
  most people ? 
  i do n't know , that 's a bit cheap to say . 
  sure there are quite a few that see spain as `` castille '' and nothing else ... but most ? 
  have you been to madrid ? 
  it 's a vibrant cosmopolite and big city and have as much diversity of opinions and political views as inside basque or catalan cities , also big and cosmpolite like barcelona or bilbao ( world capital nonetheless ) . 
  but seriously , most people is a cheap thing to say . 
  we should be changing not just that mentality of `` fuck everything non-castillian '' but also `` fuck everything castillian '' because you * think * ** most ** of them are bad . 
  remember pp is voted outside of castillian regions too ( in galicia or valencia they 're strong ... ) and they 're in the government with just 30 % of the census votes . 
  spain is muuuuuch more than this . 
  basque country and navarre are rich too . 
  and madrid . 
  valencia or baleares are n't too far off , either . 
  the big cities overall are n't too far ... in fact , catalan gdp per capita is not even the highest in spain , even if it 's above the average . 
  by the way , economically they suffer from the same super-high unemployment rate ( unfortunately for everybody ) . 
  note : i 'm not even giving my view or opinion here . 
  just ** facts ** . 
  those are the most hard-core independentists very often , lol . 
  the obvious question here is what 's wrong with hairy men ? 
  lmfao i was there for a moment . 
  translation for the american bros : it 's fucking awesome . 
  exactly ... 
  it 's openly pro-independence though . 
  you would need to look more if you want to see the whole picture . 
  ( i mean ara + others , not just ara ) . 
  i totally feel your pain . 
  the last stolen package of catalan moneys did n't cover [ this metro station in madrid ] ( http://noticias.eltiempo.es/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/metro-inundado.jpg ) in the last summer thunderstorm either . 
  send more pls . 
   they did suffer , not as much people being sent to jail for their faith ( or more like the lack of it ) , or just plain executed for any political or ethnic difference is n't `` as much '' as if it was done because of their condition of catalan . 
  did also gypsies did n't suffer `` as much '' in auschwitz because they were n't jews ? 
  disgusting , i have nothing else to talk with you . 
   but saying that there was as opression in teruel , salamanca , zamora , segovia , ciudad real , ja\u00e9n , extremadura , and huge etc. 
  as there was in catalonia , the basque country or madrid i simply wrong . 
  to me , it looks like saying the people from those places did n't suffer as much ... it 's so wrong . 
  please stop that because you do n't even know the personal stories behind the screen that could lead you to re-think what you 're typping ... remember we still have people in the * cunetas * , and you do n't know where they might be from . 
  i might have a red-yellow-red flair but i 'm nothing but a republican ... including my family and the ones that had to suffer the dictatorship , even if they were n't catalans and were just `` normal '' castillians . 
  yep , i 'll be grabbing the popcorn ... only to see how is going to work a dui with less than 50 % of the popular vote : rolleyes : but really , i swear i wish the catalans had their referendum . 
  it 's not just the best way ... but the correct and democratic one . 
  also the best way to make sure catalonia still forms spain , with the rest of us . 
   show me one of these people . 
  kidding ? 
  have you been under a cave until ** [ 2011 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eta ) ** ? 
  i said idiots are everywhere and that you can also find people that want to put bombs for their independentist cause ... and you say there are none ? 
  wtf . 
  bitter comment , acid comment ... call it x. i do n't even care lol . 
   stupid comments like pretty much all of yours in the catalan threads make it really easy to tilt the balance towards 100 % catalan 0 % spanish . 
  this is something that you ( as in independentists ) keep saying lately . 
  it 's plain false in this case though , considering i was just expressing my own opinion , nothing against the catalans or even someone in particular . 
  you just want to make it look like that ... that 's the whole point . 
  but you know , people are not asses , they have brain . 
  try to say `` that 's not true '' first and then conter-argumentate something next time ... if you can . 
  i bet you wo n't , because you perfectly know that there are many catalans that actually feel spanish and do n't want to secede . 
  even if you hate that , in your insides . 
  there are a few , not a lot . 
  it 's like saying there are a lot of terra lliure-wannabes in catalonia ... well that 's false . 
  there a few idiots every now and then , and that 's everywhere ... so yeah . 
  franco had support because otherwise there would n't had been a civil war . 
  but suggesting that there are ** a lot ** now , in 2015 , is just insulting 47 million people . 
  one old man shouted `` this kind of stuff did n't happen during franco ... '' and automatically spain is full of fascist people . 
  come on , let 's give ourselves a break . 
  i do n't believe that . 
  i do n't think that 's the rule for the people that move and moved to catalonia ... quite the contrary . 
  even today you can find that the most `` hardcore '' independentists are the ones that migrated from southern spain to catalonia in the 60s and 70s , and their sons . 
  i 've found a lot of them ( or at least by their surnames ) in my way . 
  nothing against , just speaking out of personal experience . 
  latest ** electoral ** poll showed a ~ 44 % of the votes were for independentists parties . 
  that makes it a ** majority of * seats *** in the parliament because of d'hondt . 
  ~ 44 % is not a majority of people . 
  the latest poll that clearly asked about independence ( without parliament elections ) was the 42-50 that i was quoting . 
  unless i 'm outdated .
