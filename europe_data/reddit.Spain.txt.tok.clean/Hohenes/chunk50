  ** update ** : some people claiming they were actually disguised as jihadists portraying weapons . 
  ** update 2 ** : some videos related to the incident can be seen [ here ] ( https://twitter.com/eduvancells/status/760587256373575684 ) and [ here ] ( https://twitter.com/nilgarcia10/status/760573985318965248 ) . 
  google translate ( with some fixing ) :  a group of german tourists who were dressed and chasing a supposedly famous figure tonight have caused panic in platja d'aro ( baix empord\u00e0 ) , when bystanders who were in the promenade have believed that it was a terrorist attack . 
  events have taken place towards the 22 hours when appeared the group of tourists running , while showing objects that looked like weapons and made noises that have been interpreted as detonations . 
    this has triggered psychosis and there have been races , and confusion have caused damage of some outdoor furniture stores . 
  two people had to be addressed anxiety , and have been taken to hospital palamos . 
    members of the local police have arrested two tourists , and have made available to the catalan police . 
  some sources suggest that it was a stag party , they wanted to record a flashmob simulating the pursuit of a celebrity . 
  emergencies of the generalitat has asked tranquility to the population , and explained that it was all a misunderstanding . 
  well they are making sure they do n't go poor shit when the oil runs out . 
  because it will run out sooner than later . 
  at least that 's what it looks like to me . 
  sshhh , what do you want ? 
  that they know the truth ? 
  nonsense !, 
  yeah buddy , the politicians killed the asturian language over the centuries . 
  sure thing . 
  nope . 
  tourists `` reserving '' w / towels . 
  spain : this happens everyday , every year , for many years now . 
  huh ? 
  we 're growing at 3.5 percent . 
  i mean right now . 
  unemployment is still high but it 's going down fast . 
  i do n't think it 's going to take a lot of time to get to the point we were pre-crisis ... we are actually approaching . 
  ireland already did it and is showing that they can boost their economy again . 
  i do n't see why spain would be any different . 
  this generation of spaniards is the most well educated . 
  we are actually exporting high-tech workers precisely because we ca n't absorb them all ... it 's not a lack of educated workers problem , like germany has by the way , but a lack of jobs - for now . 
  that 's the whole point we 're talking about . 
  sadly the unemployment rate just does n't serve justice to what spain really is and what it can be . 
  unemployment ? 
  are you even following the discussion ? 
  fair enough . 
  ( un ) employment is our thing i guess . 
  still one of the best places in the world to live in , which can be surprising for many people . 
  well , if we talk about education , sweden is actually on par with spain ... yeah , i 'm cheating here , it 's not because spain is great at that , but because sweden is doing it bad as well . 
  well , at least we are sure it 's not a northern/southern thing   anyone being born today is likely to witness the singularity and the long march of transhumanism . 
  people are n't going to live to 80 or 90 , but to 150 , 200 or more . 
  what the hell . 
  take [ any source ] ( https://www.economist.com/media/pdf/quality_of_life.pdf ) you want . 
  spain usually ranks in top10 in most of them easily . 
  i mean , i live here , and it 's easily one of the best countries to live in . 
  i bet i could say the same about prague ... 
  i just do n't think we are so low in this map , and that 's it - it 's not about `` how high '' is czech republic for me , but `` how low '' we are compared . 
  i do n't doubt that it 's a good place to live in . 
  pretty sure it 's that way , i just do n't think estonia beats spain in quality of life . 
  the only way estonia beats spain immensely is in unemployment rate ... and one could think that 20 % unemployment rate would absolutely lead us to being one of the worst countries to live in ... yet we rank in the top 10 in most quality of life rankings . 
  that 's why i do n't believe this one . 
  that 's not the definition of [ quality of life ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quality_of_life ) . 
  pretty sure the czech republic beats spain in some aspects ( like in the finance/economic side , the unemployment rate , for sure ) , but there are many more aspects where spain or italy are not only on northern europe standards ... but above them , in terms of climate , family , health or life expectancy . 
  also , gdp per capita is higher in spain and italy compared to czechia , and way higher than estonia , as well . 
  actually spain beats italy [ in the quality of life index ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/rankings_by_country.jsp ) . 
  but it 's hard to beat spain as it 's one of the best countries regarding quality of life * even * with our high unemployment rate . 
  that 's why i call bs this map . 
  i 'm reading the source . 
  that 's because this is a bullshit map . 
  [ doubt it ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/rankings_by_country.jsp ) . 
  estonia or czechia above spain is not accurate . 
  quite hard to believe this tbh . 
  dude . 
  we stopped using [ that flag ] ( http://blog.fantasticgardeners.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/national-flower-of-spain-red-carnation.jpg ) two centuries ago ... it 's time to get an update hmmkay ? 
  if not ... am\u00e9rica should be ours and we are back to be the ruling superpower in order to respect the historical stuff , sorry !, 
  of course , and i 'm so confident that it would be easily won by those who think spain should stay united . 
  although there are some conditions that should be met : like those of quebecois referendum in canada . 
  also , if we ca n't change the constitution with a 50 +1 majority , an independence should n't be granted in case it 's a 51 % for and 49 % against . 
  it should be , at least , a 60 % -40 % scenario imho . 
  and do n't forget even now that the independentist parties are pushing for the unilateral independence , they do n't even have 50 % of the popular vote . 
  they 're at 47 % . 
  it makes no sense . 
  i did n't say that , like it 's said `` no pongas en mi boca palabras que no he dicho '' . 
  i said that the un does n't define what a nation is . 
  and no , the un does n't say that a nation is what the wikipedia says . 
  and again , the self-determination human right was set and meant to be applied for the time of decolonization , for peoples that were in a status of subjugation , which is not debatable . 
  same with catalonia being a colony right now or not . 
  not completely true . 
  the right of self-determination is set [ in the framework of decolonization ] ( http://www.un.org/es/decolonization/declaration.shtml ) . 
  catalonia is not in a state of subjugation , which is the actual requirement . 
  and also , the un does n't define what a nation is . 
  spain is a nation for a vast majority of its peoples , including catalans living in catalonia that feel just as spanish as a guy or girl from zamora , el hierro or cartegena . 
  so you would have to be much more specific . 
  i never said i 'm against a referendum , but because i 'm pro-direct democracy and i think everything must go that route . 
  not because i think the catalan people is opressed and it 's a colony and thus have the right to self-determination ... . . that 's bullshit . 
  you did n't say that catalan is opressed ... nor i said that spanish is in danger ... so what 's your point ? 
  we are talking of idiots right ? 
  i think you should read yourself lol . 
   and i said it was ironic reffering to all those idiots that say spanish is in danger in catalonia and i said  spanish is not in danger and it is idiotic to say such a thing , i totally agree with you ... but it is also idiotic to say that catalan is opressed today no me he dado por aludido pero t\u00fa s\u00ed lo has hecho , i simply followed your argument , nothing else . 
  not saying you said that ... 
  but there are hardcore independentists that say that , like there are idiots that say spanish is in danger in catalonia . 
  get it now ? 
  northern europe ? 
  this is not a southern/northern divide , we payed for the greek bailouts more than your country because our economy is bigger , it 's that simple . 
  and we did n't get a single euro from you , so cut the bullshit . 
  dutch bank ing was the same shit that happened here with other spanish banks . 
   seriuosly , you ought to be more grateful . 
  bitch please . 
  edit : i 'm sorry for the bad words . 
  i 'm angry but still an europeist . 
  it 's just that i hate so much this xenophobic idea of rich and productive northerners vs corrupt and lazy southerners . 
  it 's so so wrong yet this subreddit is filled with people from the northernmost countries that think this way ... please just go to that xenophobic european subreddit instead or stormfront , because i do n't think most people in your countries think that way outside of reddit .
