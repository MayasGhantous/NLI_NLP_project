   the stability and growth pact was reformed in 2011 . 
  so right after the crash and in the midst of the eurocrisis , and when germany had already controlled its deficit ... all clear then . 
  spanish is not in danger and it is idiotic to say such a thing , i totally agree with you ... but it is * also * idiotic to say that catalan is opressed ** today ** or that catalan is not favored over spanish . 
  you can agree with both statements , it wo n't turn you into a spanish fascist :p this world is not black or white . 
   using ustedes instead of vosotros over my grave !, 
  not ironic at all , considering spanish is the first language being used in catalonia too . 
  it also sounds horrendous to me . 
  also by that logic spanish is becoming a dialect of english if we keep using words like you say `` algo muy heavy '' or `` selfie '' and stuff like that . 
  it 's just not going to happen in any of those two examples we 've put . 
  there are more defenders of the catalan language in catalonia against castellanization than spanish speakers against anglonization xd, 
  i do n't think that 's bad . 
  that 's exactly how languages evolve ... it just annoys us because it changes * our * current use of the language . 
  and people is very conservative when it comes to this , and many other things . 
  for example : the imperative in spanish is built using `` d '' at the end of the infinitive root , e.g `` veni ** d ** a ver esto '' , but many people find it * strange * ( les suena mal ) because they 're used to `` venir a ver esto '' , which is wrong . 
  if a majority of people or an important part keeps saying `` venir '' instead of `` venid '' ... with the years `` venir '' will impose itself and be correct as imperative form . 
  we could even lose the imperative `` d '' ... it would n't be strange if we have a look at history and linguistics . 
  i respect that you hope that to happen , so respect that i really hope that does n't happen . 
  yeah , yeah ... but they still ask a 26bn $ budget cuts from here to 2018 . 
  i doubt that 's happening with the current political situation . 
  either that , or psoe has to support pp , and that would cause psoe to disappear like pasok did in greece . 
  meanwhile , ` france is france ' and together with germany can break the deficit limit for decades before the crisis and nothing happened . 
  well go fuck yourselves just a little bit . 
  no fucking sun and beaches for you this summer . 
  well , we talk about influence , not a total replacement . 
  spanish coexists perfectily with catalan in catalonia , but it 's so hard to find that coexistence with asturian in asturias ... spanish is * the * language . 
  again this is something that [ took centuries ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/linguistic_map_southwestern_europe.gif ) . 
  if spain is unimportant ( which i think it 's not , as it is , at least , a middle power ) , imagine what would happen if you split it apart . 
  and catalonia is like the 20 % of spain . 
  and if you do n't care it 's ok , but being unimportant has huge disadvantages regardless of what you think . 
  spanish influenced catalan but i think galician was the biggest damnified by spanish influence . 
  not saying it 's a good or bad thing ... it 's just centuries of linguistics and history , but i 'd say catalan is one of the few that , although influenced , it has n't changed as much as galician did ( to the point that there are movements that want to `` go back '' to the old galician ) . 
  also , do n't forget spanish is heavily influenced by the other languages of spain as well , especially basque but also catalan . 
  i 'm from madrid and i do n't spend a lot of time listening to catalan ... but i can understand it perfectly . 
  obviously some words are totally unknown for me , but the context usually gives it away . 
  catalan can be very intelligible for a native spanish speaker . 
  if not , i would n't be able to understand it . 
  it is mutually intelligible . 
  but you can find a bit of xenophobia ( both ways ) , and even if it 's just a bit they are too loud . 
   catalan is in its worst position ever lol . 
  it 's not even wroth to chat with you . 
  next time learn about franco and the repression of catalan during the dictatorship , so you know that catalan is not in its worst position ever . 
  just stop talking out of your ass . 
  i 'll explain it to you a bit easier :  alvia is not a high-speed train . 
  this is false . 
   alvia is a high-speed capable train . 
  this is true . 
  the fact that the train has high-speed capabilities is what ... guess what ? 
  yes , what makes it ... * a high-speed train * . 
  from wikipedia itself :  ** alvia is a high-speed train in spain used by renfe operadora for long-distance service with a top speed of 250 km/h . 
  ** now keep downvoting me . 
  but keep in mind that wo n't change the fact that alvia is a high-speed train no matter how hard you try to convince yourself of the contrary . 
  oh , and fyi , i never changed my point . 
  read [ the parent comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ucrmi/today_3_years_ago_a_spanish_highspeed_train/d5onbfr ) :  this is a high-speed train ** that can be used on regular tracks as well . 
  ** so ... yeah . 
  alvia was created for those cities and regions that still do n't have high-speed rail network that could connect to actual high-speed rail network and function as such . 
  alvia is a high-speed train capable of both , running on high-speed network ( with speeds up to 250 km/h ) and traditional network . 
  it is definitely a high-speed train . 
  the fact that it can be used on a traditional track does n't make it less capable . 
  was the accident on high-speed network ? 
  was the train a high-speed capable train ? 
  yes . 
  that 's all the debate sorted out . 
  the national social security [ has denied ] ( http://www.eleconomista.es/economia/noticias/7721775/07/16/la-seguridad-social-desmiente-que-haya-30000-muertos-cobrando-una-pension.html ) this . 
  so this is either old/wrong or misleading news ... mods should add that to the title . 
  i trust the social security system more than the tribunal de cuentas which is heavily politicized from all sides . 
  this is a high-speed train that can be used on regular tracks as well . 
  ** [ alvia is a high-speed train ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alvia ) ** . 
  the driver ... and the lack of promised measures , like [ ertms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_rail_traffic_management_system ) . 
  ours also rarely derail . 
  but this case is full of controversies that extends up to this day . 
  and i do n't remember any other big derailments in spain . 
  this one was the biggest in like 50/60 years . 
  i think there was a minor one in germany not so long ago though . 
  edit : oh , and italy just recently :(, 
  i 'm weak against trolls , i have to admit i bite their bait more often than i would like to admit . 
  but i insist , you have zero credibility here , and yes , you get downvoted hard , i 've seen your comments get hidden in this same thread . 
  do n't worry they 're surely spanish francoist trolls that helped hitler conquer gerona . 
  lol . 
  just take a break , there wo n't be independence any time soon . 
  stop projecting yourself with your ultranationalistic agenda . 
  you only appear in this subreddit to push your own political agenda with lies and history manipulation that no one buys , even among other nationalists . 
  no wonder you get downvoted hard ... `` but all of them are spanish trolls ! '', 
  right ? 
  you 're pathetic . 
   yeah no buddy , catalonia was conquered and annexed to spain 302 years ago . 
  this is why you have zero credibility in / r/europe, 
   plus if you know anything about sociolinguistics you know that catalan is headed towards extinction on the contrary , you know nothing . 
  catalan has done nothing but grown , and the most hardcore nationalists are proud of their education system as it is used only catalan as vehicular language in public schools . 
  please , stop spitting ignorance if you do n't have a clue what you 're talking about . 
  thanks . 
  spain never had a catalan vs rest of spain civil war , despite what they 've told you about the war of the spanish succession . 
  the spanish civil war involved catalonia as it involved the rest of the country . 
  madrid was on the same side catalonia was , trying to fight to maintain its democracy ... do n't start reinventing that as well , you already did a good job about the war of the spanish ** succession ** . 
  i mean , it 's more than that ... their policies are beyond unreasonable most of the time because they apply their ideology to everything . 
  including education & public institutions . 
  you 're incredibly wrong . 
  he 's not entitled to `` be humble '' on his judgements because of what his country has done ... plus he has told you he 's from the uk , so your whole point totally falls apart . 
  coming from a greek ... are we acepting or rejecting opinions based on origin ? 
  what kind of xenophobic and arbitrary rule is that ? 
  is n't he allowed to form an opinion about other countries ' behavours because `` booh , yours is bad and crappy , go pay taxes ! '' ...
