  or what ??? 
  so that 's the level now ... `` coming from a greek '' , when we are not talking about greece and you almost did n't have a chance to know where he was from . 
  does n't sound like the same ... 
  yes , that 's the reason , people do n't joke when `` serious '' countries do this . 
  not because they do it . 
  yet spain is probably the first country you want to ask about fighting terrorism . 
  ignorance at its finest . 
  i do n't know about the two others but spain is ( sadly because of first person experience ) a top country regarding fightning jihadism , and has key allies for such objective like morocco . 
  surely this is something to be mocked because it does n't say `` germany , france and the uk '' instead which are part of the * kewl * countries as opposed to romania or india . 
  keep being classy , / r/europe !, 
  disgusting self-righteousness and superiority complex for literally no reason . 
  sad times for all the liberal , progressive and secular civilised bros and sisters of turkey . 
  30\u00bac is my minimum temperature tonight ... \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  carlists divided between the `` left '' and `` right '' that we know today , most notably the [ partido carlista , a self-managing socialism party ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/partido_carlista_\\ ( 1971 \\ ) ) ... curious shit considering it was the most reactionary/absolutist movement that spain ever had . 
  you do n't know what `` first language '' means , right ? 
  catalan people first language is spanish for a majority over the catalans that have catalan as first language . 
  of course they might speak catalan anyway , like you make use of english here but it 's not your first language . 
  do you understand this ? 
  pretty basic stuff . 
  the nationalistic propaganda is getting ridiculous . 
  i never said the spanish 24hr news channel was bad . 
  it is not . 
  we have euronews in spanish and some regionals as well . 
  also , antena 3 has a 24/7 too , iirc . 
   edit 45 : us state department saying a coup attempt is underway in turkey . 
  thanks for that guys !, 
  lol, 
  well , i do n't watch tve but the 24hr channel is fine , it helps in times like these . 
  nothing wrong about it . 
  this is crazy though ... estoy flipando . 
  i guess i 'm watching the spanish 24 hour news channel tonight * again *, 
  i mean , spain itself , in spanish means `` espa\u00f1a '' which is pretty much like `` hispania '' . 
  the name comes from it . 
  err ... sorry to burst your bubble but ... catalan people speak spanish more than catalan ... and they do have spanish as first language before catalan . 
  what you 've just said makes no sense at all . 
  i do n't know how but you must have lost in the way , between the independentist propaganda and your own nationalistic bias . 
  because you 're so incredibly lost . 
  just set up a 20-year remind me to check back , it will tell you how stupid it was , and how little you know spain and its history . 
  of course , and no offense but the basic idea appears to be somewhat shared with 68 % of the portuguese though !, 
  are you kidding ? 
  i 'm all for a franco-iberian union !, 
  and with italy ... let 's call it `` european '' , and invite the others , too !, 
  yup , * anti * - iberism ; being * against * the project or political movement that aims to put spain and portugal together in the same country :p this is stupid though . 
  spain itself is the uncompleted version of iberia . 
  we need to fix this uncompleted part ( i.e. 
  making it plurinational for real ) then we would be ready for portugal . 
  the idea of spain ( espa\u00f1a-hispania ) was already that . 
  it 's in the name of our ( current ) country itself . 
  of course portuguese nationalism will be always against that idea though . 
  well ok , we 'll make olivenza/oliven \u00e7a our `` dc '' . 
  like brazil did with brazilia . 
  oh , do n't be silly , you know why i said that . 
  i 've tagged you `` anti-iberism '' in the past , due to previous comments , 
  portubros \u2665 let 's do this . 
  lisbon together with barcelona can be the capital , madrid can just survive being the financial centre . 
  let 's scrap the monarchy and give all the powers to the iberian nations . 
  then make a proper federal country . 
  ** a strong iberian country ** . 
  iberism exists and it 's there . 
  it 's not something `` the spaniards '' have created . 
  it 's a shared sentiment between many portuguese people with the rest of their fellow iberians . 
  https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/iberismo if you are against it does n't mean it does n't exist , or that this poll is fake ( it 's actually done by a quite prestigious institute ) . 
  well , under the new rule the earth will unify and countries will no longer exist . 
  that , plus free kinder chocolate and ice cream for everybody , regardless of race and gender . 
  air travel needs to stop , though . 
  ** this ** is yurop t-t, 
  the bulls run and they are guided to the plaza , where they are killed by matadors . 
  woosh . 
  and then leave the eu ? 
  lol, 
  it 's one event per year , but with more than one bull run in the event . 
  imo for most people is not even about the bulls . 
  it 's a stupid excuse to drink dozens of liters of wine and alcohol [ and assault people ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/item/e9bdbe23-2296-4857-a1cf-6eff6dbcaecf ) . 
  plus bildu ( left-wing pro-independentism basque party ) which is in charge of pamplona 's town hall , absolutely support this but then it opposes bullfighting like something `` barbaric '' . 
  hypocrites and disgusting `` celebration '' just like the bullfightings ... 
  you call slicing a sword through a living animal that takes their life away for entertainment/the show as you want . 
  it 's you and your conscience . 
  i call it torture , objectively , not subjectively and based on opinion . 
  it 's literally a top definition of torture and harming living things for pleasure and entertainment . 
  the spanish film industry does n't engage in repetitive and systematic torture activities against bulls . 
  they can have the subsides because , contrary to bullfightning , they do create and spread culture ... from time to time . 
  also , a bad spanish film wo n't ruin your country 's reputation . 
  bullfightning , on the contrary ... it does . 
  do we want to be among the most advanced and civilised countries or not ? 
  because on this issue , we 're not . 
  there are only a few that attract many people ( san isidro is one of them , that i can recall ) , but what / u/fragkilleresp says is not true and is not mentioning the reason of its profitability : bullfighting in spain is ** heavily ** subsidized and protected by law ... they get tons of public money which is why it has the capacity that it has , otherwise we would only see the most popular * corridas * ( the ones that are profitable ) and that 's it . 
  but instead you get them in every fucking town in their respective local festivities , obviously with public money from each and every town hall . 
  the revenue are subsides in a big portion , because if you do n't have to invest or you do it only partially , you get more revenue when selling the tickets that otherwise you would n't ... just check every plaza when it 's not a major festivity : they 're partially or more empty than not . 
  still get broadcasted on some tv stations , because of its protected status . 
  some * people . 
  and parties do n't want to lose their support . 
  a vast majority of young people ( and not-so-young as well ) are against this barbaric show . 
  that 's why i hate it when some idiots outside of spain think that this is spain and that we 're barbaric . 
  we 're not , the world of toreo is , and it 's facing stronger opposition each day . 
  firstly , canarias was the first region to ban them . 
  and secondly , the parliament of catalonia banned these bullfights , but they did n't ban other bull-related shows where the bull is also being tortured ( putting fire in their horns that cause them blindness and so on ) . 
  and they used it as political propaganda pro-independence , when they actually left their own bull torturing games untouched . 
  it 's disgusting . 
  so ... no . 
  my example of vanguardism is canarias , not catalonia , thank you very much .
