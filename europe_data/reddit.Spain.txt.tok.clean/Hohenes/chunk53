  we could actually kind of function in colder climates as well considering the spanish climate is not tropical ( except in the canarias , which is sub-tropical ) and we do have four real seasons :p it 's not unusual to have -10 \u00bac january nights with moderate to strong freezes in the city itself . 
  although again , with low humidity , which means it 's not as bad . 
  i have to say i hate hot climates so you can guess that i hate where i live in this time of the year very especifically . 
  well we were having some nice storms in the last few days at the end of the day , everyday in most of the country because the lack of high pressure in the atmosphere , but right now that cycle has come to an end and we 're facing the second heatwave in this summer - temperatures around 40\u00bac in the big valleys ( guadalquivir and ebro ) and near that in central and south-central spain . 
  it 's not unusual but it 's not the average daily temperature either : it 's 38-39\u00bac max . 
  temp here in early july when the average is around 31-32\u00bac . 
  the usual thing would be getting this kind of heatwaves from the second fortnight of july onwards , but we are getting it earlier , this year . 
  and no , we do n't have permanent 39\u00bac temperatures across the summer ... that 'd be crazy . 
  although when in northern and central europe they get those unusual temps many ( old , mostly ) people die ... 
  i guess we are more accustomed here . 
  low ( as usual in madrid ) , still far from comfortable if you do n't have your ac on to sleep . 
  but you go to valencia , for example . 
  it 's 26\u00bac ... with 70-80 % humidity . 
  it 's a nightmare . 
  ** spain ** . 
  30\u00bac all around central spain right now ... at half past midnight . 
  that is all . 
  yes , to venerate him as their lord . 
  well , not the worst on earth , but i do n't like to be like `` hey , we 're a normal , developed , rich western european country ... just that we 're in the bottom part of the list '' . 
  i 'd like to say we 're more in the leading part of that list instead of just saying we could be top in the list of not-so-good countries after the list of top ones ... kthx obviously spain is far from being in the leading part of the top countries , even if we obviously could make it up . 
  that 's why there 's strong criticism ... there are quite a few of us that do n't pretend to get comfy with our place and want to improve it no matter what . 
  oh , i failed to see the sarcasm !, 
  [ i know right !? 
  lol, 
  ok we might have not invented it but we 're fucking masters at it for sure . 
  literally `` fuck , i swear ! '', 
  but you could say `` i shit you not ! '', 
  or things like that . 
  it 's like ... urging the other person to believe what you 're saying . 
  like : `` damn it , you * need * to believe what i 'm saying '', 
  ah , so we did n't invented it ? 
  i thought we were top at that xd, 
  well , my ideals are firm , even if i know they 're hard to apply ... it 's like catalan independentism , their ideals are firm , it 's just not easy to make it happen . 
  the difference is that independentism has so much more support ( still not a majority though ), 
  well , there are not many people that think like i do , but my opinion is that a true iberian union ( a federated or even confederated republican union respecting every territory ) would basically make catalan and basque independentism go back to their 20 ~ 30 % natural rates . 
  or probably much less . 
  if that means madrid has to lose the capital status i 'm up for it . 
  a lisbon-madrid-barcelona or even just lisbon-barcelona shared capital status would be awesome . 
  i mean , i 'm a convinced iberist , so i 'm not objective enough  honestly we are two brothers now , but there was a time that we were part of the same idea ( i do n't refer to the iberian union though ) . 
  but you definitely become different things ( even if very similar ) when you spend so many years splitted up . 
  france , considering portugal is like us and that 'd be cheating . 
  the other option was gibraltar and morocco . 
  while morocco is ok i prefer france even if they did n't put much pressure against eta 's hidden holes in the worst years of terrorism for spain . 
  sadly it does n't sound as right as `` la puerta giratoria '' :(, 
  because i already have enough with my manchego , of course !, 
  excuse me , my english could 've played a bad role in this particular case , i dind ' t mean to say he * crossed * the line but that he stepped on it ( i have no footage so no idea if it was just a partial step or whatever ) . 
  thing is , it does look like it was a very minor thing , yet the disqualification rules are clear about that ... so bruno got the gold automatically - it 's hard not to say no looking at his reaction . 
  he will probably feel bad for him as well ... but he also worked hard for the silver . 
  erasmus does wonders xd, 
  well , the disqualification happened because he stepped into another lane . 
  but yeah , must suck for him ... :(, 
  article explaining why the first was disqualified [ here ] ( http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/athletics-martina/2942766.html ) . 
  he actually discovered that during this unfinished inverview :p, 
  we do have a few * procesiones * where christ is represented as black . 
  [ la hermandad del cristo negro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjri6wa5mjq ) was founded in 1490 . 
  i 'm not a fan myself of the holy week ( i 'm atheist ) but all of this is beyond the religious sentiment : it has to be with tradition and festivities . 
  a bit of [ context ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holy_week_in_spain ) . 
  obviously not a tribute to kkk , but it certainly could seem like that if you did n't know about semana santa in spain ( something way older than the irreverent kkk ) . 
  [ exact place ] ( https://www.google.es/maps/@39.954203,-3.5045342,3a,65y,57.94h,83.4t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sgaqllom1t8mg4cbyyo1vsg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) in google maps, 
  it is also the ugliest !, 
  ^ ^ ... by ^ ^ that ^ ^ logic , ^ ^ i ^ ^ mean , ^ ^ let 's ^ ^ not ^ ^ start ^ ^ throwing ^ ^ the ^ ^ cheese ^ ^ at ^ ^ me, 
  hopefully another iberian wins it this time too !, 
  same here in both examples xd, 
  why ca n't we be the united states of europe ; _ ; ask angie , pls . 
  i mean , back in the 2000s germany and france never respected the deficit ... but we are still here ... and it 's not like we hate you for that or something like that . 
  yes , rules should be respected , but let 's be real - this eurocrisis was so badly managed . 
  we either need more political union or else we 're going to have even worse times . 
   wait this one is n't even happening we will see . 
  but my point was that if it happened , it would n't be as catastrophic as / u/zeldzaam said, 
  spain 's banking system was bailout and nothing happened ( for the eu ) . 
  and we 're talking about 100b $ . 
  that 's like 1/8th of the netherlands total gdp . 
  i doubt italy needs more than spain , considering spanish banks are bigger . 
  i mean , who are you trying to fool , you 're part of latin master civilization ( \u2310 \u25a1 _ \u25a1 ), 
  you border us . 
  you also get contagied from there . 
  it 's a party , a celebration . 
  it 's needed for many people around the world . 
  it 's a reivindication . 
  spain is one of the most progressive countries in the world in this aspect , that 's why it 's easy to have millions of people on the streets for this issue . 
  you [ do n't need to move `` to the other side '' ] ( http://www.e-noticies.tv/canales/actualitat/anna-tarres-no-es-catala-el-que-no-parla-catala-17751.html ) anyway , this post is about love , respect , and tolerance , where you can find lots in madrid these days , not idiots , 
  that would be stupid , to hate more than half of the population of catalonia that consider themselves spaniard in different degrees . 
  a catalan hating on spaniards is like a californian hating on americans . 
  it does n't make sense , unless you do like a bit of self-hating . 
  always ruining my diablo 's games and now this . 
  fuck them !, 
  spain has an unemployment problem not a poverty problem ( more than other w. european nation i mean ) , even with the unemployment . 
  we clearly have a problem about unemployment that 's behind western european standards , and that 's what we are trying to fix . 
  edit : downvoted by an idiot for stating a fact . 
  hello , idiot !, 
  found the lonely grumpy bigot , guys !, 
  hahaha , the poor little fucker needs to ... fuck a little more . 
  well , it 's the [ symbol of the city of madrid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madrid#/media/file:bandera_de_madrid.svg ) . 
  `` el oso y el madro\u00f1o '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madrid, 
  easy : we stopped being religiously conservative and we 're a socially liberal , western european country . 
  spain is still culturally catholic , though , even if religion itself is not important anymore . 
  examples of this are the semana santa , bautizos , comuniones ... etc. 
  oh ... [ they are ] ( http://elpais.com/diario/2005/06/19/sociedad/1119132001_850215.html ) ... we , the majority and rest of the society just did n't listen to them  it was just common sense . 
  opposing a human right has little support among a majority , even if you see 200k people in the streets oposing your right to marry whoever you want . 
  you 're missing the concerts !,
