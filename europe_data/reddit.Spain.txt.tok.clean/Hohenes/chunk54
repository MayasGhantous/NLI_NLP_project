  ohhh , prepare yourself then , the next one [ we 're hosting the worldpride ] ( http://www.madridorgullo.com/worldpride ) and we 'll be the world 's pride capital in 2017 , * together * with the [ europride ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europride ) :p we will probably see even bigger numbers !, 
  feel free to x-post it ( please , do it !, 
  if you want ) , i 'm not doing this for the karma :d also maybe to / r/gaybros, 
  i wish the same , especially for the gay people there in morocco ... even today we have to say we still suffer from hate and there has been more than 100 aggresions this year in madrid , so i 'm afraid it must be much worse there . 
  i hope they 'll be safe . 
  today is a lovely day ... but let 's not forget orlando . 
  it 's very present in the people 's mind today . 
  also thank you !, 
  we might not be the prettiest city but we still try . 
  it 's 37\u00bac today in madrid ... but [ we 're still expecting 1.5 m people in the streets ] ( http://www.estrelladigital.es/articulo/espanha/madrid-prepara-manifestacion-orgullo-lgtb-mas-grande-europa/20160702144658290448.html ) in one the biggest pride march in europe , 
  so you would be ok in the case the remain vote would 've won and the government of the uk decided just to leave the eu . 
  considering you would be ok in the contrary ... or you 're just ok with that when your option wins but not ok with it when it does not . 
  as i said ... fuck democracy , we do n't need it . 
  so fuck democracy then . 
  two years ? 
  it 's been the catalan independence since 2012 . 
  i mean the post-bailout situation is their mismanagement , why would n't place their hq in the country they experimented with ? 
  it 's not ironic , it 's pure logic . 
  of course * madrid * is also at fault , but you and me know that 's always true - the dinos could have told us horror stories about * madrid * 's involvement on their extinction event , d00d . 
  you talk like we are n't being tutored by the eu itself in regards of our economic memorandum because of the banking bailout ... 
  i think your self-image of spain is clouding your image of the eu and its institutions . 
  you got ta spread the hate wider . 
  next step : independence of catalonia from the mediterranean !, 
  ara es l'hora !, 
  no , we are . 
  you are n't . 
  i mean , by that time you 'll be independent ... right ? 
  lol, 
   the uk has n't even left yet , ** and may not ** the uk did a referendum and people voted to leave the eu . 
  who are you and what kind of information you have to hold such a statement ? 
  unless you 're just talking out of your ass , of course . 
  like ... madrid , valladolid , castilla-la mancha , zamora , toledo , segovia ... all of them ruled by pp ... amirite ? 
  seriously , your mind is full of clich\u00e9s that are not even true . 
  `` castile '' does n't even exist anymore , and it 's so vague with no clear borders . 
  you 're lagging a few centuries behind , my friend . 
  yeah ... we 'll see that , because it 's the third time it happens , and the third time i have to read that after three different elections . 
  that 's false . 
  he avoided to answer that . 
  so let 's not lie . 
  here we go again ... 
  honestly there are worse places in western europe . 
  first we change spain then we talk , hmmkay ? 
  hahaha . 
  funny how some take this seriously and start trying to offend spain and the spaniards . 
  how sad your life must be . 
  yes , but pp and c 's are closer to a majority right now . 
  we are still in a gridlock , though . 
  you have a series of articles in [ thelocal.es ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/ ) about the elections . 
  then you can visit places like [ el pa\u00eds in english ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/inenglish.html ) . 
  i know they are probably not exactly what you 're looking for , but it can give you more info . 
  thank you mods . 
  the first exit polls say unidos podemos ( podemos + iu coalition ) might be the second party now . 
  but be wary this can change a lot . 
  ciudadanos seem to be in a really bad position , losing relevance by taking a 10-15 mp loss , for now ... again , this is subject to change by the actual results . 
  for now , we 're waiting our canarian compatriots to finish voting ( remember the timezone difference ) so we can start to see official results . 
  i think you 're right . 
  but * precisely * does n't need to be exchanged for * exactly * . 
  but yeah , erc is quite cringe-y sometimes with its xenophobic discourse under the rug . 
  solidaritat at least did n't try to hide it . 
  yes , pnv is extremely pragmatic . 
  i can see them not voting against a podemos government in order to facilitate a government . 
  not the best example for pp and psoe , because their coalition might have worked there , but a pp-psoe coalition in the rest of spain can lead to psoe being a residual party , like pasok in greece . 
  and i 'm all for it ... bye ppsoe . 
  one mod replied saying they 'll sort it out ... 
  i 'm just waiting to check it out later . 
  brexit would be more important if it was the same day . 
  but it 's been three days of brexit . 
  more things are happening in europe . 
  pretty much . 
  you can call populist to everything today in order to win an argument . 
  already have them in ceuta and melilla . 
  i do n't understand why there is no stickied thread in / r/europe , when it has been the norm for every other general election in every other country . 
  are we north africa now ? 
  i just actually messaged the mods about this . 
  1 . precisely - indicating exactness or preciseness it does look the same to me . 
  except spain is a developed country with the problems of a developed country and no political party would transform spain into something worse than a first world country ... even if pp is trying ** really ** hard to make it happen . 
  it 's just the rest of the people that do n't vote pp that we want to be among the * first * first world countries , not at the average or bottom part of that list . 
  literally ruining : pp is the reason why half of spain wants to secede from the other half . 
  pp is the ** forth ** political force among people under 50 . 
  we 're * already * in the disaster because of pp . 
  podemos ca n't be worse than pp even if they tried really hard . 
  i 'm sorry but that 's just how it is even if they told you the contrary . 
  that 's why podemos has 6 million votes . 
  you got ta learn to deal with it . 
   just do n't repeat the same thing over and over again , it does n't make it more right . 
  oh the irony . 
  thanks for the laughs , dear indepetroll . 
  no , you lost it with less than half the people that voted - you ca n't call something a referendum and then say some votes are not counted . 
  ** the yes parties took 48 % of the pie ** while ** the rest ** represented the 52 % . 
  period . 
  yeah trying to secede with 48 % of support is n't `` normal '' . 
  agreed . 
  catalonia is not the best example of that right now , precisely ... 
  in what form or shape does that change what i 've just said ? 
  you can give an id card to saharians and presence on the parliament . 
  they still were colonies . 
  catalonia is not . 
  you see the difference , the problem is you just do n't accept it because of your political agenda . 
  you do n't need to learn history , but just open your mind . 
  you can get independence , but that would be splitting up spain , not `` a colony being free 'd from its colonizer '' .
