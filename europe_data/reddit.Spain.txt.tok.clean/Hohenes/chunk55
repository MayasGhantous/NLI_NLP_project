  period . 
  rip, 
  estrella galicia is not terrible . 
  it 's cruzcampo that is . 
  sounds like franchute ( despective for `` french '' ), 
  no i live in a very humble district ( very similar , and very close to this one in madrid , usera , where this happened ) of a big spanish city ... so i do really know what i 'm talking about . 
  actually , spain plays a higher league than france on this . 
  this obviously has to do with the narcocrime ... otherwise it 's so rare to see this kind of brutal homicides in spain . 
  what is rare is having it here , in spain . 
  we of course have some stupid male chauvinists that think they can kill their wives and their children , but i do n't think that 's different from the rest of w. europe ( sadly ) . 
  that 's why this is news . 
   portugal not part of spain when it was formed de facto ( 1516 ) or de iure ( 1715 ) . 
   flanders a colony . 
  inherited from the habsburgs . 
  not spanish territory . 
   northern catalonia which was part of catalonia . 
  a piece of catalonia , which forms spain . 
  lost in the war against france in the 1500s . 
   gibraltar and menorca both were naval bases for the english . 
  menorca was ceded back . 
  gibraltar is still a colony today . 
  and after 300 years they ca n't be more gaditan , even in their language . 
   argentina , mexico ... colonies . 
  not core spanish territory . 
   cuba and the phillipines . 
  same . 
   sahara and r\u00edo de oro . 
  yup . 
  same . 
  catalonia , on the other hand ... is not anything of that . 
  it 's core spain . 
  it does form what is considered `` spain '' itself , since its very beginning . 
  there you have , i do n't expect you to see the difference , but i do n't need you to , others will though . 
  spain would n't be spain without catalonia like france would n't be france without the historical territory of occitania , or like germany would n't be germany without the southern german states ( that formed the south german federation , with a key state like bavaria ) . 
  so say what you want , but catalonia was , is and most likely will still be in the distant future considered spain by its own deserved right to be considered so . 
  that would n't be iberia then , like spain would n't be spain without catalonia . 
  i would get rid of it now if i had the chance . 
  and many many other shit . 
  you know , we can always unite and form iberia ;d, 
  yep , remember [ spain is extremely montanous ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/sierra_de_gredos_26-06-2010_16-14-43_3888x2592.jpg ) , one of the most montanous countries . 
  second in europe , just after switzerland . 
  so ... most , then ? 
  awesum, 
  and not a single tear because of the youth unemployment , the forgotten 50 + y.o. 
  unemployed that do n't have a chance in the labour market anymore , or the increasing poverty in his own fucking country . 
  what a clown . 
  * spain * - ( 26j elections ) polls confirm there will be `` sorpasso '' of unidos podemos ( united left + podemos coalition ) and psoe will be the third party in the parliament for the first time . 
  - `` la roja '' has resurrected and is starting to become a favorite again in the eurocopa . 
  actually spain and portugal do not have far right parties in their parliaments , compared to pretty much everyone else in europe . 
  it 's not just `` smallest '' , but `` inexistent '' . 
  damn i like those afp globes , where can i grab one ? 
  you start to count each one of those groups and end up with ... around 16,000 people . 
  more or less . 
  they literally have no support among the population , it 's just mono-neuronal people with no support from the spanish . 
  good thing we do n't have a front nationale , pegida , true finns , fp\u00d6 , sverige demokraterna and shit like that . 
  my official statement as a spaniard : it 's fucking hot in here , turn that air conditioner on , pedro . 
  why do they call them fans when they mean radicals/extremists/hooligans ? 
  lol , i bet it 's very common in romania too ... but nope , it 's not just from romania , we share it with many other countries , 
  it 's happening , just need a few more years . 
  i need to visit the azores . 
  hey you . 
  do n't call me moron . 
  [ here 's one ] ( http://ensaladillarusa.es/ensaladilla-rusa-con-atun/ ) , with olives , too !, 
  i am too getting hungry ... and it 's only 13:00 !, 
  no lunch until 14:00 xd edit : i missread you , i thought you said you never seen it * with * tuna . 
  oops . 
  i usually do [ this version ] ( http://ensaladillarusa.es/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ensaladilla-rusa-light.jpg ) with at\u00fan ( tuna in english , i think ? ), 
  and mayonaise . 
  ok , ok ... but it has to be cold because it 's so hot here already and my ac has broken literally yesterday xd, 
  not the one i make , and not all of them , but some people do put olives on it , and it does n't taste bad at all , they are a good complement to many salads . 
  i 'll eat some [ ensaladilla rusa ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ensalada_rusa ) today then, 
  the idea of the project is that every member is `` just another memeber '' and that we 're equal . 
  if that 's not like that then it needs to change . 
  and it will , otherwise it 's going to happen what you say . 
  in spain literally no one asks to leave the eu , yet that poll says 49 % is not favorable . 
  reason is ... that 's not an `` out '' poll , just that there are many people that want to change the eu ... not leave it or destroy it . 
  people in spain against ** this ** eu wants a democratization of it . 
  if the main objector for an ever closer political union within europe is out ... yes , it 's better for that objective . 
  this is basic logical thinking . 
  more concessions ? 
  i 'd rather beg them to leave the union before that happens . 
  it 's pathetic already the exceptions that have been made for a member that 's not even remotely necessary for the continuation of the political union ... quite the contrary , it is probably the biggest challenge in that path . 
  good riddance . 
  as true as pp being francoist today . 
  absurd ... most of the time . 
  trust me , there 's maybe two or three dummies out of the 5 million podemos voters that say that venezuela is an example . 
  i 'm a podemos voter myself and my reference is denmark or sweden , not venezuela . 
  why would i want to go from a mediocre position to a bad position when i can get upwards instead . 
  til the political program of a party is an important document . 
  maybe if they fullfilled them ... 
  spain 's been the 8th greatest economic power in the world ... and shit still happened . 
  france can resist better than spain but the difference in economic size was more about population than anything else . 
  just saying since politicians in france have been using the `` we 're not spain '' card ... when only being true about our labour markets . 
  yeah , well , i still remember when we were told we were on a quickpath for surpassing france 's gdp per capita in two years ... then having everything fucking explode , * mdr * . 
  but , hey , at least we are surpassing italy 's this year . 
  they have identified one of the attackers . 
  yes , they were hardcore independentists . 
  not like the independentists are like this ( they 're not ) , but this one was an intolerant and a fascist . 
  hopefully the rest of independentists repudiate it instead of downvoting ... just wait for it ... 
  i do n't think any of them approves at the moment .
