  i can see that border patrol over there !, 
  set aside italia pls, 
  you know , it can be dirty * and * bushy . 
  just like the stuff that 's between your greasy ass cheeks . 
  get to da pizza factories !!, 
  except they 're around 7,000 spanish , and there are over 2,500 british citizens ( and 1,000 other nationalities ) that work outside gibraltar , so it 's not as one-sided as you claim it to be . 
  and let 's not even talk about that second residence that many thousands of gibraltarians have in costa del sol . 
  as for the rest , we will do as we please , since it will be our own external border after brexit ... the uk is not the only one that has the right to control their borders , are n't they ? 
  so please just shut the fuck up . 
  this is not true . 
  it 's like saying the spanish today are the celt and iberian peoples of 2000 + years ago . 
  it is simply not true . 
  the only one that does n't understand `` a colony is not a country '' here is you . 
  op said some people consider it to be a country , not that he did : because there are people like you that fail to see gibraltar is not a country . 
  good luck in your next trolling campaign in the next `` spain in the title '' posts . 
  because here you just sound ridiculous . 
  gibraltar is british territory . 
  not a country . 
  and calling it a country wo n't make them one . 
  [ or this one \\ ( with some fix \\ ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/abs5xj4.jpg ), 
  they use trump 's dead skin cells to cover their lights with that , thus making them more orangy . 
  that does n't even make any sense . 
  but no , gibraltar is a colony , not a country . 
  the title is ok . 
  a country in the strict sense of an independent sovereign state is the standard definition of a country for most of the world , does n't matter that the uk calls their regions `` countries '' because a. they 're not sovereign , b. they 're part of * another * country ( the sovereign one ) which is what we are counting here and c. the uk is only a tiny part of the world , not the whole world . 
  if you say the uk then ok , because gibraltar is part of it . 
  but gibraltar is not a country , it 's a colony , and it 's british territory . 
  period . 
  unless it 's an independent country ( like andorra which has more right to be mentioned ) , gibraltar does n't qualify . 
  a colony ca n't be an independent country no matter how much self-government they have . 
  ah , countries . 
  so no gibraltar either then . 
  oh look , spain in the title , time to talk about a small 30k pseudo-british andalousian town in the south !, 
  hehehe i 'm so biting that even the queen herself would be super proud of me and my burnt lobster skin ( \u2310 \u25a0 _ \u25a0 ), 
  it 's not irrelevant , a democratic society does n't work with the concepts of conquering other land to their benefit ... that 's long gone and exactly the reason why your comparison is meaningless . 
  the rest of spain is not conquering or colonizing the basques . 
  doing such comparison today is unfortunate from your part . 
  since when there was a democratic , xxi-century society a milennia ago in the iberian peninsula to which we can apply this ? 
  please do n't use stupid , nonequivalent comparisons . 
  but what i mean is that not even they think it 's right , considering what are they doing now . 
  not even talking about morals , but what 's good for the basque independentism ... they look at what the catalan independentism movement is doing and they think `` i want that '' . 
  that plus trying to legitimate every corner of the basque independentist movement in order to achieve more things . 
  no , it 's not right to kill innocent people in a democratic country because you think they 're colonists and they should be out of `` their '' land , no matter from which `` perspective '' you look it at . 
   kingdom of aragon colonised by castille . 
  said not a single historian , ever . 
  edit : you got me . 
  these people are so unreal it 's hard to catch the sarcasm . 
  to lose territory you first need to grab it . 
  thing is , catalonia was n't even grabbed , as it was n't part of any colonial empire ... because it ** is ** mainland spain . 
  you sound as ignorant as the average independentist , and as naive as the most nationalist one . 
  you 're heading for just another disappointment . 
  sadly , i wo n't be able to see your disappointment face . 
  but it will be fun when you find out erc and converg\u00e8ncia are not even in the same ship and will fight eachother for the generalitat and the shitty process to nowhere will be done . 
  erc will probably win , but there wo n't be independence ( there was n't going to be anyway ) . 
  mark my words , 
  caution : the people there is used to the temps , but if you 're from northern europe and you go to sevilla during june-july-august ... prepare to die . 
  it was the first time i almost passed out due to the weather , and i 'm from madrid which ~ ~ can be ~ ~ is hot in summer as well . 
  but it 's worth it . 
  agh ... typical french chauvinism ... ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ joke , ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ love ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ france, 
  in italy ? 
  i mean , everything is bilbao 's surroundings but ... 
  i bet there must be some crazy pan-catalanist in alghero . 
  because spain is the only country with little villages and towns ? 
  besides , how can an italian ask this ? 
  come on francia do n't be jelly < _ <, 
  no such a thing in the picture . 
  the ship is not around gibraltar port waters , mate . 
  manuel jaja bad hombre taco burro my knowledge about those mexican countries is hugh mungus, 
  these comparisons are laughable . 
  way to show your ignorance . 
  spain ca n't break the law for `` invading '' her own waters . 
  no breaking of law when you are in your own waters mate . 
   that 's like me saying ... no it 's not . 
  he was responding to picardo 's comments on the post-brexit negotiations where gibraltar would be left out of the eu ( since it 's a colony that 's not part of the spanish territory ) . 
  and as such , it 's very clear the context was regarding the fact that gibraltar could remain in the eu if they accepted spanish co-sovereignity . 
  not that spain would invade and plant a flag . 
  you should read the whole conversation or just try not to make things up , because the comparison would be right if margallo said that he will invade london . 
  stop with the poppycock . 
  [ march 2010 ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20100308/53897361377/un-historico-temporal-de-nieve-y-viento-colapsa-barcelona.html ) is memorable too . 
  january 2009 was also memorable for madrid , although snow in madrid is a little more common than barna . 
   blockade them and try to force them to capitulate through economic warfare . 
  there 's literally no proof on what you 've said . 
  the spanish government has not said such a thing , you 're simply taking it our your arse . 
  what the spanish minister said is that due to brexit gibraltar could seek a co-sovereignity with spain to remain in the eu , not that spain would force gibraltar to do anything . 
  that was wishful thinking towards his electorate ... nothing else . 
  you 're painting a scene here that does n't represent the reality , just because you are probably more nationalistic than margallo i 'd say . 
  but above all , please do n't make shit up . 
  what 's my current government plan vs franco 's according to you ? 
  what threats ? 
  here is the uk threatening btw . 
  i do n't think you have the slightest idea if you dare to compare them . 
  most gibraltarians have that andalousian touch that 's so easily recognisable , obviously with the british mix . 
  the uk is not as relevant as they think . 
  that 's not an insult : it 's a fact . 
  maybe you just do n't see it yet . 
  if anything , brexit looks like will help towards the objective of actually prove that . 
  you 're including ireland there , which is a country that 's kicking your ass in gdp per capita and many other indicators ... just like spain does with many other quality of life indicators to the uk . 
  maybe you just have nothing else to say than being insulting , because obviously the uk is delusional if it thinks they really matter that much . 
  you can always work for [ the sun ] ( https://twitter.com/thespainreport/status/848841176136515585 ) . 
  not even the economist use that term anymore , you 're just being insulting just because now .
