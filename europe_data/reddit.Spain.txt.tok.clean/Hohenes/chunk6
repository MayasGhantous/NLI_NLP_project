  are you serious ? 
  saying that is like that fucking absurd thing like `` spanish is in danger in catalonia '' ... it 's stupid and simply only a few believes that shit . 
  yeah , spain is so bad today that forbids catalan in its constitution ... oh wait no it makes it official where it 's spoken , oh snap !, 
  so opressive . 
  what 's wrong with that though ? 
  having two languages is fucking awesome . 
  i can only speak two fluently yet i wish it was three . 
  or four . 
  spanish people desperately need to learn more languages , in general . 
  believe it or not , i have a friend studying catalan in madrid :p, 
  ah , so it 's that ... 
  i guess you missed the  this sarcastic description part . 
  seriously , put your glasses on , if you have them . 
  or at least pretend you have something else to say other than `` hurr durr spanish nationalist hurr durr facha '' . 
  your argument is `` you are against the independence of catalonia , therefore you are spreading `` spanish-nationalist '' propaganda '' . 
  it 's so funny i do n't even mind it when you compare me with the extreme right-wing being a leftie myself , lol . 
   not even in a fucking milion years we would say that . 
  i told you many times . 
  `` we '' means `` i '' . 
  you need to improve that . 
   stop spreading spanish-nationalist propaganga kek . 
  franco opressed spanish people ( yes , i include catalans here ) that did n't fit his idea of spain , because for him it was `` una '' . 
  all of that wrapped in a national-catholistic ideology full of bullshit that affected much more than just the idea of nation that he had : also religion and non-believers , for example . 
  you are saying franco opressed catalan people for being catalan . 
  it was n't like that . 
  franco opressed everything and everyone that did n't fit the ideas i described , and culture/language was a main point of this crazy man , yes . 
  franco was galician , yet he also opressed galicians and their language ... as the rest of the country because they did n't fit in for him . 
  not their ` galician ' side at least . 
  only his castillian view . 
  can you see the whole picture now and not just the one that depict the rest of us like we were ok with franco so you feel better with your own political ideology ? 
  exactly . 
  romeva even appealed to his spanish citizenship to remain in the european union if catalonia goes independent . 
  lol . 
  first , the latest poll made by the nationalist pro-independence governement of catalonia shows 50 % of catalans do n't want independence , whilst 42 % are for it . 
  that 's not a majority to me . 
  secondly , spanish people are probably mostly against , according to diverse polls , but there are a lot of us that want to allow the catalans to vote , because that 's how it should be . 
  and also particularly i think that letting the people vote is the best option to keep catalonia in spain , instead of doing stupid comments by our ministers playing the army card even if they do n't actually mean it - they 're stupid and that makes things worse . 
  and last but not least ... catalans also feel spanish , millions of them . 
  independentists do n't , even if they speak spanish and share most of our culture , but the identity stuff in catalonia is quite sensible and you can feel it , mostly in a peaceful way , yet it is there . 
  independentists indeed just want to leave . 
  but again , they 're not a majority , and the source i use for that is their own nationalist governments and their latest polls regarding independence . 
  according to that , basques and catalans simply do n't want to leave spain even if there 's a strong 30-40 % - depending on the timing - of their populations that are all for it . 
  plus if the basques and the catalans leave spain if someday they have a majority , then it would n't be `` spain '' anymore . 
  it would be something else , but not spain . 
  did n't you get the memo ? 
  we the 3.1 m people of the city of madrid are all nazis that want to opress other people and steal all their moneys because we are all catalan-haters and we eat their babies nom nom nom . 
  disclaimer : this is how some independentists want to depict us , actually not that far from this sarcastic description , but the truth is not all catalans see us that way fortunately . 
  there are some that even think we are as diverse and have different political views and have the same desire to change the country as them !, 
  crazy !, 
  it probably wo n't , not the way the independentists want to do it right now , but hell let them vote already ... it 's the only way to end this . 
  otherwise tensions will keep rising and rising and that 's not good at all . 
  i 'm pretty convinced that the catalans will vote to change ... spain , and change it together , staying with the rest of spaniards , because together we are stronger , and because independentists are simply not majority . 
  so let them vote , already !, 
  indeed , idiots are everywhere . 
  you can also find people that want to put bombs for their independentist cause . 
  as i said , idiots are everywhere ... 
  not all of them but yes , the more extreme ones that also happen to be in reddit are so annoying . 
  their comments are like reading la raz\u00f3n but with just a little different background and nothing else . 
  franco opressed all of spain , not just catalan and the catalans . 
  this kind of thing like franco was all ok for spain except for catalonia and the basques is the most retarded thing ever and it 's like saying hitler was ok except for the polish . 
  stop with the bullshit already . 
  franco was a fascist motherfucker for all spain not just the catalans , which i totally agree with them in the fact that he * also * opressed them , and their language . 
  fyi , every region of spain `` has plenty of reasons to be a country on it 's own '' ... because spain is formed by different iberian peoples : the galicians , the basques , the castilians , the catalans , the andalousians ... etc.etc . 
  with their own uniqueness , most of them have their own language attached to the diversity of their culture , and even so only two of the many people 's in spain have a strong independentist movement ( which are not majority according to polls by their own regional often nationalistic governments , by the way ) . 
  i 'm all for a referendum because i want a united spain : it 's the only chance because many people is just asking for democracy and you ca n't say no to that . 
  but really , catalonia is as rich and diverse ( and unique in its own ) as many other spanish regions , castille , galicia or basque country just to name a few , but there are more like asturias ( and the asturian language ) , aragon , valencia ... etc etc. 
  so stop thinking it 's a spain vs catalonia thing : it 's an independentist thing . 
  that 's why i said : ** if you look in the right places ** . 
  the photo you linked is a modern-era built area of an urban city , not even close what we are talking about here . 
  plus the discussion here is not where most italians live . 
  please , take a moment to read again my comment , 
  lovely ... also spain and all the mediterranean europe look like this if you look in the right places . 
  and it 's exactly as lovely/awesome/peaceful as it looks . 
  i would n't change it for just a little bit more gdp per capita . 
  [ my gods ] ( http://i.imgur.com/woaisqj.jpg ) ... it 's getting hot here ... what a policeman o_o, 
  any really ... mediterranean in the winter , atlantic in the summer if i can split it :p, 
  why thanks !, 
  i picked ireland too . 
  ** spain ** spanish ** invasi\u00f3n ** galician ** invasi\u00f3n ** catalan ** invasi\u00f3 ** basque ** inbasio **, 
  uhm , spain is a biggie and grew a lil bit more . 
  only said for the sausage type , for the meal itself it is said perrito caliente or hotdog , at least most of the people . 
  https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/perrito_caliente :p, 
  in catalan yes , not in spanish though . 
  what ? 
  i say perrito caliente xd frankfurt is one kind of sausage , not the hotdog though . 
  oh please , no need to be * so * salty rosbif . 
  agreed , / u/saarp comment served me a couple laughs , haha . 
  inisgnificant uk would face the same issues today , so keep dreaming about the uk having any relevance today . 
  it 's there on par with `` insignificant '' spain wether you like it or not . 
  not even an opinion , it 's plain evidence . 
  it 's just that leaving the eu would only make it even more insignificant , and no , the eu wo n't support an external , insignificant country over one of its ( biggest ) members . 
  i 'm sorry for insignificant uk , it would only become * more * insignificant if they decide to leave . 
  keep your imaginary wet dreams for yourself . 
  like if you could do something with that . 
  well , if the uk leaves , the eu will more than probably side with spain more clearly on the gibraltar issue . 
  interesting . 
  the police is following judicial orders , not landlord/banks orders . 
  podemos , because it 's the most reasonable option right now . 
  the rest are right-wing nuts or just want to split the country unilaterally with manipulation . 
  and fuck ppsoe .
