  also , spain is a ** much ** better place to live than the uk , and maybe that 's the reason why you come here to live the rest of your lives and we even treat you like normal human beings ( see ? 
  we know how to free insult too ) idiot . 
  their strong `` british '' identity is , in reality , a strong anti-spanish sentiment due to franco being a fucking moron ( like if we did n't know ) to them . 
  that 's their true identity , and the reason gibraltar is how it is today . 
  nothing else . 
  gibraltar has a problem with picardo . 
  he 's the biggest fucking clown . 
  drop the tax haven thingy , drop the random incursions into spanish waters , and start persecuting smuggling/fightning dirty tactics against your neighbours and we will have the best border deal with gibraltar . 
  that will : - keep gibraltar fully british - keep gibraltar sovereignity over their territory , with all their self-government - keep gibraltar in the eu , sort of . 
  but they wo n't accept it , because they not only want to keep having full access with perks to spain but also the rest . 
  fuck off then , and good luck trading with morocco and the sea . 
  as long as i can get hawt irish men we have a deal , celtic britain . 
  obviously , just like spain would defend ceuta or melilla . 
  and we actually had to in the 2000s . 
  the thing is , will spain attack gibraltar ? 
  absolutely not , there 's nothing to earn from that even if it was at barely zero cost . 
  and there 's no way spain attacks gib . 
  99,9 % of the population would be against it and actually do something against it . 
  but the uk right now looks like a fucking child . 
  and right now we 're like ... `` maybe that 's the only thing they can do to us , being mean to us , and that 's why they 're acting like this '', 
  rome , not italy :p current-day italy has the same right to the roman empire than france , spain or romania , for example ( just like their languages , sons of the same mother ) . 
  funny coming from someone that wants to actively disobey it . 
  you must be so naive to think you can get independence and still being spanish . 
  if you 're independent , then that 's it , you chose to keep your catalan nationality over the spanish one , and that 's exactly how it works . 
  because they do n't take it off you ... you are droping the spanish one because there 's no agreement with the catalan one . 
  you are so naive . 
  what 's the source ? 
  where is it ? 
  no , have * you * heard about dual citizenship before ? 
  because it does n't work like that : both countries need to have an agreement , otherwise most countries understand that you 're renouncing to your nationality ( although to be fair sometimes this is not enforced ) this is , as i said before , very very basic stuff about international law and how things go about citizenship . 
  calling colonialism ( with its ethnic implications ) a political option you do n't agree with is pretty much that . 
  next step is calling good catalans only those that agree with independentism . 
  and it 's actually very close to that . 
  you can invoke any dank may-mays you want . 
  it 's a very creepy fascist attitude to have . 
  and i 'm not a ciudadanos supporter at all . 
   will the spanish government really take the citizenship away from everyone that decides to keep the catalan one ? 
  that 's exactly how it works in every country between just another country with which they do n't have an agreement about dual citizenship . 
  it 's exactly how citizenships work internationally , yes . 
  except then you can lose the spanish citizenship in that case , which will left you with the catalan one and no eu one . 
   modern colonialism \u2122 found the catalanazi . 
   catalans with non-catalan parents tend to be `` unionists '' more often [ citation needed ], 
  your eu membership comes from your spanish citizenship . 
  there 's no eu citizenship by born , it is only obtained automatically through the national 's citizenship of each member state . 
  if catalonia stops being spain and its citizens are asked wether they like to be catalan or spanish ( because they would have to choose ) , then those that pick catalan over spanish will stop being eu citizens . 
  this is pretty basic stuff and has been said over and over by eu officials . 
  but you look at the spanish basque side , the french basque side , or both at the same time/different intervals ? 
  i simply look at the iberian peninsula because it 's so fucking nice to the eyes . 
  you do n't have literally any proof on wether he was involved or knew what was going on . 
  you only talk about guesses and that 's it ( like `` he would be idiot if he did n't know '' ) , and there 's where your argument crumbles . 
  you call him a corrupt with conjectures . 
  but you do n't know if he 's involved at all , he could have received a discourse that he has to throw there and he just do it . 
  your definition of corrupt is so vague that you can basically clasify almost everything as corrupt . 
  that does n't work like that , because it kind of distort the meaning and the image of actual corrupt politicians that are * actually * corrupt . 
  he is definitely part of the excuses and political agenda trying to hide their shit indeed , and that makes him absolutely an undesirable political figure to have , but objectively we ca n't say he is a corrupt politician . 
  he 's a cynical one , but that 's not illegal . 
  but pp is a political party with very serious corruption cases ... not la cosa nostra -_-, 
  but you 're saying * he * is a corrupt . 
  was he ever caught , personally ? 
  is he in the middle of some judicial process ? 
  not even talking about having a proper trial and he being condemned . 
  you are mixing things up if you do n't see it . 
  he might be in a very corrupt political party , but we ca n't say he is a corrupt himself unless we can objectively say it . 
  and you ca n't objectively say it . 
  so no proof , then . 
  proof on the corrupt accusation ? 
  i 'm at the antipodes of his ideology but still was very moving this speech to me because i can agree with it 100 % . 
  `` la verdad es la verdad , la diga agamen\u00f3n o su porquero '' so much hate against him . 
  i can understand it ... but it 's about the message and that i can totally agree and identify it with . 
  this is why we ca n't have nice things in spain ( disregarding something just because it was said by someone you do n't like ) . 
  it 's also a nasty fallacy . 
  and no i 'm not a right-winger . 
  speak for yourself 8 ), 
  it 's also the deadliest accident in history : /, 
  welcome to the club of civilised people , common trait having very clean buttholes !, 
  naisuuu, 
  sorry , i ca n't upvote you . _ . 
  funny how you try to prove italy 's superior labour market with a list of countries by average wage where spain is just at italy 's levels . 
  the truth is , you have no idea about spain 's labour market and how it works , other than `` oh you have a higher unemployment rate so it might be worse hurr durr '' . 
  pretty much the same can be said about your knowledge on the spain 's different industries . 
   the fact that i wrote different papers about the subject in one of the world 's 50 best universities k. ... aaaand yet spain 's gdp per capita is surpassing italy 's . 
  might want to consider write another paper . 
  or use it to clean yourself . 
  but sometimes you just ca n't or you had shower time just a few minutes or a couple hours ago . 
  but hey , at least we know you clean your butt in the shower , and having no bidet it 's not about that you do n't want to clean it !, 
  lol, 
  you should give a lecture to yourself on what [ a situation of economic stagnation means ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_stagnation ) . 
  it 's not a situation when you have a high unemployment rate but still grow at 3,5 % , but rather when you have very low growth rates * optionally * combined with a high unemployment rate . 
  and i 'm sorry to tell you , italy has n't been growing over 2 % these years , nor it is a low enough figure to be considered economic stagnation . 
  italy has been suffering a low economic growth rate for many years , and spain has not , despite how our labour market works , which you do n't understand because you wo n't be able to explain why we grow at more than 3 % with a 19 % unemployment rate . 
  just like german companies profit from cars being done here , there 's an important amount of undeclared work , and thus not entirely computing in the figure . 
  and still we manage to grow more . 
  not knowing basic things like what a situation of economic stagnation means wo n't allow you to disguise your ignorance insulting my education . 
  you should educate yourself first , then try debating about something you have a slight idea of it . 
  meanwhile , spain is overshadowing italy in gdp per capita while having the czechs at your rear . 
  well , `` less rich '' can be a synonym of `` poorer '' . 
  yeah , [ tell me more ] ( https://www.google.es/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_kd_zg&amp;idim=country:ita:fra:grc&amp;hl=es&amp;dl=es#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_kd_zg&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:ita:esp&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=-276660000000&amp;tend=1427410800000&amp;hl=es&amp;dl=es&amp;ind=false ) . 
  the only year italy had a clear advantage was when we were transitioning to democracy and in the worst year of eta terrorism . 
  world bank data btw . 
  not even now when both countries are growing again after the crisis italy can compete with spain 's growth , and this is shown as a gdp per capita surpassing over italy 's , of course .
