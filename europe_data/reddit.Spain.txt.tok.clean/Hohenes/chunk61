  growing at 0,5-1 % when others are growing 2-4 % is being in stagnation , not actually growing , and the reason why italy fell behind . 
  not assumptions , your nationalistic views wo n't allow you to see it . 
  but we do n't need you to see it , do n't worry . 
  spain could n't be more europeist . 
  there 's zero chance we develop such thing . 
  you can fix that with ** squatty potty ** \u2122, 
  of course . 
  those barbaric northern peoples do not , though . 
  ... which still has 2015 data . 
  look at imf and other organizations pointing otherwise with updated data . 
  it 's only logical though , considering italy 's growing at 1 % while spain is above 3 % , and italy has been stagnating for decades . 
  this is not something spain has done well ( although being the fastest growing country among the big ones helped ) ... it 's something italy has n't done well . 
  and very soon the czechs will be catching you up , it 's a matter of time unless you do something else . 
  these are facts , not nationalistic wishes and/or dreams of still being in the 80s when italy could compete in gdp per capita with the uk . 
  it 's long gone and spain has been comparing to italy for decades as well , it 's just that now you do n't seem to see that . 
  but i tell you , it 's there . 
  sorry bruh , german switzerland is the poor switzerland . 
  yet spain today has a higher gdp per capita than italy 's . 
  my point is , people sometimes make the most stupid choices . 
  tell that to the british or the americans . 
  you 're comparing spain 's todays figures with italy 's 2008 figures . 
  spain 2008 figures were 35k , not 25 . 
  and they 're not 25k $ today , either . 
  it 's about a different kind of leadership , we do n't need else ... we already have the rest that 's needed . 
  that 's why i think spain is not where it deserves to be . 
  spain is representing the heritage of more than 500 + million spanish-speakers around the world , an influential ( former ) empire that has shaped half the globe ... yes i think it 's an important country in the globe . 
  i do n't even think french can compete with that . 
   spain has still a lower gdp per capita [ not anymore ] ( http://www.expansion.com/economia/2016/03/25/56e16ed922601d9c238b457e.html ) . 
  spain 's gdp per capita is higher than that of italy 's . 
  spain had the chance to join the g8 , it was n't until the g20 that we were invited ( as a permanent guest ) . 
  spain 's economy ca n't be compared with turkey 's ... even with their population ( higher than spain ) , they have a smaller economy , so it makes no sense . 
  if you think spain does n't deserve to be among the 20 most influential/powerful nations then you do n't have much idea to be fair . 
  sure , and i get that 's not only about the biggest economies , but spain is important enough to be counted , not only in the g20 but in the previous g8 as well , considering its economic power , strategic place , cultural heritage around the world ... etc. 
  not just talking about population and economy size . 
  we 've been left out for centuries in things that we should n't have been left out . 
  spain is not where it deserves to be and that 's something very recurrent here from time to time . 
  it 's also painful to see our leaders ca n't even communicate in english . 
  because we were left out being the 8th biggest economy in the world at the time ... and france ceded a permanent seat for us instead . 
  thanks , i guess . 
  not really . 
  rioja is only in a small portion of the country , but you can hear it 's the `` best '' in many places outside that portion of the country . 
  but for me it 's not ... because i do n't like red . 
  my fav is albari\u00f1o . 
  my bad , someone sent it to me through whatsapp because apparently yesterday snowed quite more in madrid itself than in the surroundings ( where i work ) . 
  it 's still nice to see some snow around here in this time , 
  over my beaten corpse . 
  i work to live not live to work . 
  spain has [ similar logos ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ros6qwt.png ) as well , in the sense that they 're all built with the same design so it 's easy to spot it . 
  yep . 
  and i had to remove ice from the windshield this morning before going to work , although this happens almost every day ( with clear skies during night ) during the winter . 
  but honestly it 's not falling too much . 
  it 's purely anecdotical . 
  madrid reporting : it 's snowing right now . 
  take * that * , northern europe . 
  til we are germanic . 
  yes . 
  they will come [ this year ] ( http://www.madridorgullo.com/en ) !, 
  we 're not into sangr\u00eda , but we can drink [ this ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/horchata_de_chufa ) , eat [ that ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/oliebollen.jpg ) and have or tolerate a lot of liberal homosex indeed . 
  so true . 
  it 's ok bby we you and me did bad things in the past . 
  now we 're cute democracies sharing the same clearly superior values of democracy and freedom trying to do something big with this european union thingy . 
  with salt and tomato . 
  and sometimes you can add garlic . 
  \u2665 let 's marry like it 's 1482 . 
  remove the chicken , cheese and add olive oil and we 've got a catalan baguette right there . 
  agreed , treating the comunidad aut\u00f3noma holandesa just like that , omfg . 
  the fascist baguette must perish . 
  my brother ... spain and portugal are african countries as well : madeira , canarias & ceuta and melilla . 
  but it 's cool , that means we span more than one continent like the good ol' days , 
  til spain is a communist state with a single party and no liberties ... why the hell would you compare the laws of a democratic country with those . 
  holy shit with all these dumb comparisions -_-, 
  true . 
  til you have to be spanish and a troll one to disagree with you and your ideology . 
  big fucking joke of a troll , you are ( inb4 you come back as a victim after insulting the spaniards ) . 
  totalitarian , authoritarian is ` softer ' , would be erdogan for example . 
  but spain labelled as `` fascist state '' during the 20th century is very much up to debate . 
  if you use `` fascism '' with everything it loses its meaning . 
  we should speak of national-catholicism and isolated far right-wing dictatorship . 
  this is horrible . 
  it is , but due to this it 's getting too much international attention and it 's ** unbelievable ** crowded . 
  spanish , too . 
  [ naranja ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lte3db7fi8m ) . 
  bu\u00f1ol ( valencia ) [ tomatina ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_tomatina ) some idiots outside spain still think they waste all that food ... but they 're just idiotic enough not to know or have though that those are not to eat because ca n't be eaten . 
  each damn year . 
  all of these three peoples ( italian , irish , english ) share the same principles and have common sentiments though . 
  ca n't say the same with the rural and interior parts of turkey . 
  why the hell they think it 's fine having your top government officials rally on another country for your internal constitutional referendum ? 
  hoooly shit . 
  when i mean travel i really mean it . 
  could someone tl ; dr this ? 
  it 's starting to get featured on first page in every spanish media and i 'm not sure of the implications yet . 
  typical dutch : will try to extinguish the hells with a single glass of water if that means bothering the spanish . 
  can we just forget that breda thing and get over it pls ? 
  yep , but this is a nation-wide law : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/historical_memory_law, 
  this is a state-wide law , so it should apply in the entirity of the territory . 
  i thought the same , but then i interpreted as `` unique '' , as in ... there might be others , but this one is fairly singular due to its symbolism ( franco 's remainings are there ) . 
  i say we should take them and flush them on the dirtiest wc we can find , lul . 
  i 'm surprised it 's so low for spain , i have a hard time trying to find one that does n't travel from time to time . 
  it is sad indeed . 
  and the reason many people do n't even try at english , because they feel like others are going to laugh .
