  i just do n't give a fuck and speak english with the most posh accent i can in front of other spaniards . 
  they all look jealous . 
  exactly , the problem is about the 800k britons in spain , and the many spaniards in the uk as well . 
  but 1bn $ is nothing for the spanish exports , which are around the 260bn $ last year , and growing at a good rate . 
  actually it 's not pride , more like we are self-deprecating with ourselves when we see other spaniards trying at other languages . 
  we make fun of ourselves because of our own accent ... even if other people do n't find it funny at all . 
  it 's just another point in the list of our self-deprecating job . 
  this has been a recurrent problem with our presidents of the government ( or as the rest of you call them , prime ministers ) , sadly . 
  hopefully that will change in the future , because i always think that we miss ** a lot ** with this . 
  that can be a misleading title . 
  this is just what a mep said . 
  it was spain and portugal iirc , a few months ago . 
  thing is , we still do n't comply on the deficit , but being punished after doing all the reforms that the eu asked and being the fastest growing economy among the big european economies was just unfair , so they left us more time to adjust with no penalties ( there was going to be a huge fine , which is ironic because you 're trying to get rid of spending ... if you add us more spending via fines is like ... ok you 're stupid or something ) . 
  and also punishing probably the most europeist country just seemed wrong . 
  no idea tbh . 
   spain hasnt been forced , but has been begging to bailout its banks - the netherlands hasnt been forced , but has been begging to bailout its banks - belgium hasnt been forced , but has been begging to bailout its banks - france hasnt been forced , but has been begging to bailout its banks this is the difference , you 're not going to use the same `` terminology '' making a reference to those countries as `` begging for something '' , when they had had banks getting rescued with our money as well . 
  it 's all the bullshit you can eat from bild and the like what matters here for you . 
   by the way , podemos is not much better concerning anti-european populism than right eurosceptic parties . 
  holy shit you know nothing . 
  just so you learn something ... italy has trouble with its banking system now because it was n't rescued back when the others did , and now that window is closed , that 's why they ca n't get bailed out . 
  but let me tell you if something badly happens again , the german banks are not safe anymore . 
  be prepared . 
  that 's a bill that is in our public debt and have to pay with interests ... 
  i do n't see solidarity in having a 60 % -  100 % over gdp debt rise in 10 years that our childrens will have to pay with big interests , being a burden to the future economic growth . 
  and all that just because we could n't let those banks go default ... because , here 's the twist : they owe the german banks and would go default due to their mismanagement ( if those banks could n't afford it , why lend them in first place ? ) . 
  it looks like at the end we 're just saving the german banks . 
  and yes , this is well known in spain and one of the reasons why 11-m and podemos , with 5 million voters exist . 
  the eu is lucky they did n't turn euroskeptic or `` alternative '' right for its most europeist country out of the big ones . 
  and just fyi , spain had to contribute for the greek bailouts or the dutch and belgian ones to their banking systems ... 
  i see you have an anti-southern speech on this , but you are selectively forgetting about the northern bailouts to their banks . 
  they exist and were huge . 
  spain paid for those , too . 
  why do n't you [ wise up yourself ] ( http://www.bde.es/f/webbde/gap/secciones/salaprensa/notasinformativas/16/arc/fic/presbe2016_35en.pdf ) with actual data instead of appealing to good ol' prejudices ? 
  findland is just slightly above spain in gdp per capita . 
  not that surprising to me . 
  it goes like this : italy -  spain -  france -  finland . 
  edit : can be downvoted but ca n't be denied , 
  do n't be fooled - that 's for the german banks and the debt other banks have with them . 
  deutsche bank is a dead walking zombie . 
  or more like do n't be a fool ... 
  come on do n't be an idiot . 
  absurd statement . 
  i refuse to think [ m\u00e5ns zelmerl\u00f6w ] ( http://static.ellahoy.es/r/845x0/www.ellahoy.es/img/mans-zelmerlow-desnudo-en-eurovision.jpg ) wo n't let you touchy touchy . 
  depends . 
  do you give cuddles ? 
  more like iberian * winter . 
  but after this weekend it 'll be over and we 'll go back to take our coats , thankfully . 
  quick !, 
  let 's take a big big [ estelada ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estelada ) and try to cover this asap !, 
  no , no , the political agenda is to use gibraltar as a smokescreen for other internal stuff that you might have n't heard about . 
  common people in spain do with gibraltar like you said you do with olivenza : make fun of it . 
  we laugh about [ the monkeys ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ejonenu.jpg ) there and that sort of stuff . 
  and we are pissed for the other variety of reasons that gibraltar does that causes us trouble . 
  but there 's no real political action pushing for retaking gibraltar ... plus in the 60s the fence was closed during franco 's dictatorship in an attempt to `` show off '' what he could do ... this created a strong gibraltarian nationalism which most fundamental core issue was being anti-spanish ( with good reason because of what franco did , and what the dictatorship represented to gibraltar ) . 
  today , if  95 % of the gibraltarians do n't want to be spanish , it 's not only for their obvious advantages as tax haven , online casino gambling laws or low taxes ... but because of this . 
  it 's the legacy of franco down there . 
  there 's this phrase many people use jonkingly : '' \u00a1 gibraltar espa\u00f1ol ! '' . 
  most of the time is used to mock nationalists or a very archaic way of thinking , not to be taken seriously ( minus the few that actually mean it ) . 
  again , we bitch about gibraltar being a pain in the ass , not about how spanish it is/should be again . 
  absolutely not the same : gibraltar is a pain because of the tax haven , malfunctioning nuclear submarines , random water incursions in spanish waters , harassment to spanish fishermen , throwing tons of sand to get some land from the sea illegally ... the list goes on . 
  olivenza is not a rogue country in portugal 's backyard fucking you up . 
  gibraltar is . 
  to be fair and although i do n't agree with him , you used an ad hominem as well against me , previously in this thread . 
  it is obvious oliventinos are not portuguese today . 
  they were , and there 's literally no one denying that it was taken from portugal , but today they 're simply not portuguese ... but for me it does n't matter that much . 
  why is it so important for portuguese people in this subreddit ? 
  and i say this subreddit because i know a lot of portuguese people irl and most of them did n't even know about olivenza or just do n't care enough to have an opinion . 
  no it does n't because they are n't portuguese anymore . 
  they vote normal national parties and speak spanish . 
  edit : do n't worry , oliventinos wo n't wake up tomorrow speaking portuguese just because this was downvoted . 
  i 've watched their plenos in the ayuntamiento , visited their official sites , watched a few vids and researched a bit . 
  they acknowledge their portuguese past , but they are today fully spanish and do n't have portuguese being used more than any other border town . 
  you can believe it or not , but this is how it is . 
  reason is portuguese is not used in olivenza . 
  it always felt that way . 
  apples ! = oranges . 
  yes , there 's free stuff that is meant to be free ( in more than one sense ) , and you have plenty of linux distributions that do n't look for your data at all . 
  android is absolutely not the case and is of course full of bullshit . 
  because a source code you do n't actually have access to is better and safer than open source that many people can analyze different parts at the same time ... 
  seriously , what kind of argument is that , `` you do n't read the source '' ... well if i do read a line it 's much more than what i can do with proprietary software , holy shit . 
  the point is , with full open source software you are able to know what the fuck are you using . 
  with other kind of software you are not . 
  and this is simply a fact . 
  android is not a full open source operating system though , that 's the worst example . 
  and yes , let 's pretend that open source has problems with privacy and it 's the main issue on this ... because you 're not lazy to read the source of proprietary software ... oh wait , you ca n't . 
  the point is , with full open source software you are able to know what the fuck are you using . 
  with other kind of software you are not . 
  and this is simply a fact . 
  and as we knew and we can see represented in this graph spain was absolutely the vanguard on renewables . 
  one of the best things zapatero did , together with ssm . 
  we could be the prime example of what to do with them today ... but then pp happened . 
  fuck them , they do n't love their country at all , and the worst part is that they say to defend it the most . 
  fuuuuck that party . 
  are you aware open source software is the most safe to use against this in the sense that you actually can see what 's in the frigging code ? 
  i do n't understand your original comment to be honest . 
  it ** is ** a colony and so it was considered by the british themselves until ** 1983 ** . 
  they 're not even integrated into what the united kingdom is , and is part of the crown colonies . 
  that the uk has an euphemistic way to call their remaining colonies `` overseas territories '' or that some of them voted to keep their statu quo does n't mean they stop being colonies . 
  and you 're right , the un still considers it one and is pending on its de-colonization . 
  he 's representative of an important part of the population that hates on themselves for being spanish despite being in one of the best countries to be in the world .
