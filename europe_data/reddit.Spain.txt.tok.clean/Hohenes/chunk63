  nothing unusual . 
  italy and france have similar issues with self-deprecation even being top notch countries in the most important things as well . 
  but ... but ... 
  the spanish !!, 
  it 's the spanish that we are talking about !, 
  and yet gibraltar , as a colony , does n't have any right to it . 
  gibraltar has an airport in an area which is n't even in the utretch treaty and it 's not in the ocean ( not part of any international sea law ) . 
  they took it during the civil war . 
  and that 's just one thing . 
  let 's not even talk about those water 's ownership , the tax haven thingy or the misfunctioning nuclear submarines in the first place ... 
  the ultimate non-response ... he says he does n't care about gibraltar not being spanish , but he 's bothered ( like every other spanish citizen ) that gibraltar is allowed to do whatever the fuck it want even if that means hurting spanish interests . 
  maybe try a proper argument against him next time , instead of replying with a non-response . 
  lying again : i said racism is a problem , in response to another comment about the eastern immigrants in the uk ... are you sure you 're following the conversation ? 
  also , not two , quite a few , and you can count a friend of mine which was harassed in the underground for speaking with his mom in spanish . 
  the same people that have problems with eastern immigrants also have problems with spanish and other considered `` western/white '' populations . 
  because they 're just xenophobic ... and that 's what i 've said and i stand by what i said . 
  try not to manipulate my words anymore , thanks . 
  since when i suggested spanish people should be afraid of racism ? 
  i stated a fact that there has been racism against spaniards in the uk , and you can do a quick google search to find out all the cases we 've been seeing but the next thing you do is telling me the people that have done that have been punished ... no shit sherlock ? 
  what the fuck are you even trying to answer ? 
  did i say that the attacks were left with impunity from the uk institutions or authorities ? 
  you 're trying to say something , but still do n't know what , other than not being able to deny the fact that many spaniards have been the target of xenophobia and racism in the uk . 
  real cases that we 've seen in the news and the tv and you can corroborate through videos and actual experiences ? 
  well , i do n't know what kind of `` evidence '' you want .

  means ** there are ** xenophobic or racist attacks against spaniards in the uk . 
  even if they are highly educated but have to do the jobs that other british reject . 
  http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/10/24/inenglish/1477303145_005915.html http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-attacks-a7386241.html http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-attacks-a7386241.html there were many reports before brexit , as well . 
  it 's just that it 's now harder to find them due to the many cases after brexit . 
  usually the kind of people that reject eastern immigration also find digusting that they have spaniards in their so pure country . 
  that 's what i 've seen through other spaniards living in the uk at least . 
  even if spaniards are within the categories of `` western '' and `` white '' . 
  racism/xenophobia is a helluva problem . 
  latin americans in spain are very affective with spain in their opinions , actually . 
  but i do read comments on the internet from latin americans in the other sense though . 
  and then i also read good comments , too . 
  it 's not really something you can generalise with . 
  mine too . 
  after glorious canarias , 
  he 's beefy af ... but those shoes ... ugh . 
  yes , i did n't forget about mexico , and we know that very very well ( i 'm in my 20s and i know it very well ) . 
  google translate : #spanish snowy peaks tan by dust two days after being transported by air from the sahara desert on february 20 , 2017 , dust blew northward into spain and europe . 
  as the dust particles settled on the snowy sierra nevada peaks , they left the mountains in a very different color . 
  from above , the satellites captured images of the mountains before and after the dust settled . 
  the sentinel 2-a satellite of the european space agency captured a picture of the snow on february 18 , 2017 , before the dust came . 
  nasa 's landsat 8 shows the same area on february 27 . 
  the ski slopes in pradollano , spain ( left side of the top image ) stand out with white stripes in the middle of the tanning powder . 
  below is a larger view of the two images . 
  terrestrial photographers captured images of dust that discolored snow on the sierra nevada , near granada , spain . 
  climbers found the dust as they walked through the mountains , and skiers faced dusty conditions . 
  it is not uncommon for african dust to reach spain , said colin seftor , an atmospheric scientist working for nasa 's goddard space flight center . 
  `` sometimes you see the dust in italy or all the way to greece , '' he said , analyzing the satellite images . 
  `` you 'll see this weather pattern that looks like a storm , with that classic cloud coma shape . 
  the dust drags and moves along with the pressure system . '', 
  dust carried by the wind can travel far from its source . 
  it can also have effects on snow albedo . 
  when the white powder is covered by darker material , such as soot or dust particles , it loses some of its ability to reflect sunlight back into space .

  oh wait no franco was supported by the western democracies and the republic was destroyed , my bad . 
  edit : yes we are salty about it . 
  honestly i wished i could meet `` others '' with just my mind , but i 'm pretty sure it 's not possible without the help of any sort of implanted technology :p, 
   there have been studies that suggest a biphasic sleep pattern - splitting up sleep into two stages - is even natural for humans . 
  yep , when i have time i actually split my sleeptime in two : 4 hours at night , 2 during the day ( being in spain helps with the `` siesta '' thing , although it 's rare to find people doing this ) . 
  it allows me to feel refreshed with just total 6 hours of sleep per day , instead of having to sleep 8 hours ( i do need them if i do n't split my sleeptime ) . 
  as for the rest ... it 's not about being a bad thing , it 's that i 'm quite lazy about the thing and it feels much more convenient to try wild :p, 
  i 've only tried wild , because i do n't like the idea of interrupting my sleep , but i 've read wild is the hardest one . 
  the thing is ... 
  i somehow managed to get to a point where my body ( in my mind , i guess ) starts to shake , but the ` shakeness ' just put me on alert and it fucks up the whole thing . 
  i have n't tried more than a dozen times or so . 
  i know what it is !, 
  i investigated about it a few years ago when i suffered a sleep paralysis and thought i was dying , lol . 
  i 've tried to induce one of those , but never succeeded . 
   erdo more like cerdo/cerdog \u00e1n . 
  i 'm a curious one . 
  how many lucid dreams you get in your inbox each day ? 
  and you think the catalan police will follow something against the law ? 
  or all the state officials in catalonia ? 
  or all the politicians ? 
  or all the citizens and companies will obey and pay taxes to the catalan agency and not the common , spanish one ? 
  things are a bit more complex than a majority ( in the parliament ) of independentists politicians deciding on behalf of another majority ( in the popular vote ) that did n't vote `` for '' parties . 
  there wo n't be independence paradoxically but mainly because catalans do n't want to . 
  it is , and some people has alternatives , something like an attached water hose ( not a hose obviously , i just do n't know how to translate it and google is n't helping me either, 
  we 're not in the 1500s . 
  that 's not spain anymore . 
  even in that case ( not probable ) , nothing will change after that . 
  it wo n't have any big changes . 
  fuet  all, 
  we are antipodes bros !!!!!, 
  it is spain too , i can guarantee . 
  although some people do n't use it ... we call them ** puercos ** . 
  so it 's like pp in spain basically . 
  kidding ? 
  this is the best thing it could happened ... 
  imagine that he was corrupt but we did n't know ... it would have been much much worse . 
  now we know what 's up and that macron guy is probably going to win ... and he seems to be a federalist or very europeist at the very least . 
  le pen is fucked up anyway , no chance she 's going to pass the second round . 
  italy , spain , argentina , \u00bf france ? ...
