  they know what 's up . 
  see ? 
  this is why you ca n't be independent . 
  sorry baguettes , but / u/albertogw is right . 
  duero , la rioja , albari\u00f1o  any french wine . 
  i think we 've found our real and actual common roots . 
  well , obviously . 
  can i still marry some hawt bulgarian in spain ? 
  pls ? 
  hey ... welcome to the club , 
   that type of meat is absolutely disgusting . 
  this is a good detector for people that have n't tried it . 
  i have yet to meet someone that does n't like jam\u00f3n , or chocolate . 
  dude , extremadura is big on this ... do n't forget extremadura please . 
  it 's ... a black mountain ? 
  joke 's on them , they 're now romanized * as fuck * . 
  i think once you learn italian you are going to be a fun time with spanish , catalan or other very bro/sister languages . 
  at least i do have a fun time with them like now . 
  do n't forget just how commie is to have your taxes collected to pay for something everybody has the right to it . 
  as an american you can always defend yourself with that argument . 
  why !? 
  i love this , i should do it more . 
  ahhh ... 
  i love the romance languages . 
  i do n't speak italian but i could * more-or-less * translate that \u2665, 
  those are americans 99.9 % of the time ... for some reason . 
  it 's more the first i 'd say . 
  for example spanish people are much more relaxed about that ... but still think spanish is useful and knowing it or being native you 've earned a lot already for just being able to speak it , as it is an important global language . 
  but if there 's something some people really regret is having english as the most important global language , not because it is english , but because we could have had it very easily . 
  it happened that we fell way before the others and what 's left is not enough . 
  maybe in the future though there will be one equally important global languages : english and spanish , due to the recent explosion it 's having in the us and many other places in the world . 
  but yeah , french ca n't even compete with spanish anymore . 
  our tercios were highly advanced extraterrestrial beings to your cute soldiers . 
  because spain is today culturally catholic but not very religious ( ie , people like baptism because of the tradition and the family reunion and the ceremony , and the same for the marriage in the church , or [ communion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_communion ) ... but apart from that it 's not the religious sentiment that moves people do that , but the cultural/social/tradition ) . 
  semana santa is also included here ... 
  i actually had a boyfriend ( i 'm also a guy ) that actively participated every year in semana santa , was in one of the hermandades ... but he was actually not religious . 
  as an atheist this was weird to me ( being gay + very involved in that ? 
  uhm ) , but with time i understood it 's more about tradition and the community and what you 've learned with your relatives than any faith in ghosts or whatever . 
  spain is one of the most `` meh '' countries when it comes to believe in god and people here do n't consider it one of their core or most important features that define them . 
  yeah let 's forget how we were a pain in the ass to your magnificent empire and the reason the black legend existed/exists . 
  we were a global empire before it was cool being a global empire 8 - ), 
  uhm , it 's not even a nuclear plant problem . 
  it 's about the depot . 
  are you sure you 've read the details ? 
  :| holy shit . 
  so when is germany having hitler ? 
  or is too soon for him but not for napoleon ? 
  i 'll send my [ blas de lezo ] ( http://www.badassoftheweek.com/blasdelezo.html ) for your little paper ship . 
  you need to take more siestas , that way you will earn the right to be a matador and automatically will have 50 surnames the next morning . 
  that 's how it works because stereotyping the spanish is southernly fun . 
  pablo picasso is enough . 
   violence . 
  well , religion has brought that almost always , really . 
  diplomatic leverage . 
  political support , for internal polls . 
  there might be more than one of them , too . 
  nuclear energy is not popular in portugal . 
  so taking the flag against spain which is a nuclear state is seen favourably in the country over all , even if the thing is not near the border at all . 
  yeah but you said there was no hispanophobia ( `` is that even a word '' ) , and i had to make clear that indeed exists and can be see on this same subreddit many times ( not for this , not for portugal ) . 
   these powerful stereotypes prevent an accurate understanding of early-modern , ** and even contemporary spain ** . 
  the black legend assured that many people in certain northern countries , especially the uk because it came from there , believed this and indeed marked something against the spaniards due to the rivalry for the colonies and the control of the seas and europe . 
  today , this is not the case anymore , but we can see some stereotypes are still present in many of the anglo-speaking world , and other northern countries . 
  you can keep on reading the articles , this way you will learn it 's not ** only ** something of the past . 
  it 's about anti-spanish sentiment , not anti-latin american especifically . 
  and no i do n't think portugal is part of that . 
  i think this has more to do about saltyness because of the lack of nuclear energy and having a diplomatic leverage against spain . 
  and that 's it . 
  so there 's no source , just what a teacher , a green organization against nuclear energy and the interested portuguese government said . 
  but still i get downvoted for asking the sources and you get upvoted for saying you do n't have them . 
  i sense a force of portuguese people around . 
  kidding ? 
  you should check the [ black legend ] ( https://www.ucl.ac.uk/black-legend ) . 
  i [ do ] ( http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/01/17/business/portugal-protests-spains-stockpiling-nuke-waste-near-border/ ) . 
  i think you 're an ignorant or simply blind . 
  portuguese people protesting and telling spain what should it do . 
  i was answering to this by the way :  we 're supposed to be iberian bros , not pollute eachothers rivers is it too complicated ? 
  the issue is simple : he 's talking about polluting the river , not that we should prepare an study . 
  hope you understand now . 
   kosovo is part of serbia . 
  [ of course it is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hispanophobia ) because there 's plenty of it ... especially in the anglo world . 
   portugal does n't have any nuclear plant here 's the source of the whole drama . 
  period . 
  what does the law say ? 
  is it close enough to the border for this to trigger ? 
  do you have any sources to back up what you 're saying about spain breaking the law ? 
  no , asking spain not to use nuclear energy * entirely * is what makes no sense at all , which is what many portuguese people are demanding . 
  they have no saying at all . 
  hey france let 's marry so our children are going to last 100 + years and they will speak both spanish and french natively while sharing the perfect cultural heritage combo . 
  it could n't be better !, 
  but what pollution ? 
  you mean spain is going to contaminate the tajo/tejo river with nuclear wastes ? 
  seriously , it makes no sense . 
  the portuguese would n't be like this if they had nuclear energy or did n't want to use it against spain . 
  oh , so we really are the only ones in the world without lyrics ? 
  that 's cool !!, 
  why so sad ? 
  we 're the cool guys and girls actually . 
  [ those pillars though ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kwejdx4.jpg ) . 
  never say never . 
  look at spain , one of the most conservative , ultracatholic and religiously fanatic countries for many years ... transformed into one of the most progressive western european nations , and one of the first in allowing full marriage equality ( incl .
