  adoption , being the very first in this one iirc ) poland could experiment something similar in a few years , sooner than we may expect . 
  the eu does n't represent [ a bilateral relationship ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5vrg3u/britons_see_europe_as_their_most_important_partner/de4h0jg/ ) , and yes , a german-british or french-spanish equal relation is [ far more realistic ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5vrg3u/britons_see_europe_as_their_most_important_partner/de4o109/ ) than a us-uk or us-spain one . 
  so you 're mixing things up , plus the fact that the difference between spain and france are minor compared to the differences between the uk and the us , in different magnitudes . 
  some of the blocks in the right when you open the street view link , if you walk 180\u00ba the direction its facing you will see them on the left . 
  no , it 's not about siestas , but to answer your question while siesta is still a thing it 's mostly for the elders in rural places or when you 've got enough time during the summertime . 
  no one with a job can afford the time to take a siesta . 
  the `` break '' in the middle of the day is just culture/tradition of having a long lunch break , but that 's also not very common in the big companies etc. 
  i meant restoration ... in spanish it 's `` restauraci\u00f3n '' so i basically fucked it up . 
  so he 's very happy i guess ? 
  here 's an incentive you can poke those americans with in the negotiation table next time : `` hey * bros * , here 's a beautiful european labour market law , you want me to scrap it !? 
  '' , or the consumers ' rights , or any standarization over food or health that basically was made in the eu level and the uk has to take control now . 
  yes , i 'm sure they 're good enough incentives to sacrifice for a ** terrific ** deal . 
  yeah , friend , i understand it ... you can * [ try ] ( http://i.imgur.com/p6pt6qs.jpg ) *, 
  no , i 'm assuming that 's what many people that showed up in the `` united states '' option of this poll think . 
  and i do n't think i 'm too far . 
  many british people want to approach the us and think they should leave the rest of europe aside ( which they do n't even consider themselves part of it ) . 
  the uk wo n't be better off that way , quite the contrary . 
  / u/b _ l_sisko goto [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5vrg3u/britons_see_europe_as_their_most_important_partner/de4h0jg/ ) and yes , a german-british or german-spanish equal relationship is much more realistic than a relation of equals with any european nation ** alone ** and the us . 
  let 's just face it . 
  the uk is the us puppet in that relationship , at most . 
  you need more euromonies then . _ . 
  portraying yourself like the idiotic troll you are ... again . 
  keep being useless . 
  yeah , the fact that germany was the most interested in bailing out spanish and other european banking systems because they owed so much to the german banks have nothing to do with this . 
  everything is resumed by `` those lazy southerners that ca n't do anything right asking for help when the shit hits the fan '' . 
  and even after that right now the deutsche bank is a fucking monster with a bomb inside about to explode . 
  let 's also forget we have to pay for the business the german banks had in our countries . 
  lol you 're not serious and nothing serious is going to come out of you . 
  no , it does [ not ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/melilla_border_fence ) . 
  thelocal ( dot ) es/20170126/what-donald-trump - can-learn-from-spains-two-border-fences bonus : thelocal ( dot ) es/20150721/spain-to-take - just-a-third-of-refugees-requested-by-eu  spain had rejected the compulsory quota plan and instead offered to relocate just 1,300 migrants as part of the scheme , a figure representing less than a third of the commission 's original proposal . 
  the reality is we only accepted barely a few dozens ( stating a fact , not implying that i politically agree with this ) . 
  note : fuck / r/europe rules about banning legit thelocal articles . 
  those blocks need some restauration d :, 
  bilateral relationships have nothing to do with multilateral relationships . 
  the eu is theorically a `` club of nations '' , not exactly `` oi germany bby let me do dis '' . 
  with the us and the uk , considering the size and importance difference of both , it would be the latter . 
  sorry but any european nation alone will do nothing in a globalized world . 
  and that includes the uk very much . 
  you guys need to expand [ this ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/de_overgave_van_breda ) article . 
  it 's like you want to hide it or something !, 
  may he rot slowly, 
  what the fuck is that spanish flag . 
  are we in 1700 all over again ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wamkb6qgyms ), 
  it 's incredible how naive some people can be thinking that the uk can have a relationship of equals with the us . 
  yeah , in this sub it 's always spain 's fault on every issue . 
  this is also an anglo-focused site , so even more . 
  do n't be so redundant . 
  looks a bit trashy to me . 
  enie/enhe master race why would you use the american layout though ? 
  spanish one is vastly superior because you cover english as well . 
  the american layout does n't cover spanish , but spanish can be used for english typing . 
  also , the tildes t\u00edo ... 
  sshh ... or i will call blas de lezo . 
  edit : holy shit the butthurt downvotes , lol . 
  it 's called * a joke * . 
  but i guess blas de lezo still does make some people go nuts , 
  good thing the catalans are there to make us add that sweet ce cedilla in the keyboards . 
  just one more reason not to allow them a referendum . 
  in spanish , the `` h '' has no sound at all . 
  while in english you say `` hell '' , in spanish you would read it as `` ell '' . 
  we do use the h as much as you do , but only in written form . 
  so `` hahaha '' would be read as ... `` aaa '' . 
  that mixed with how we say the `` j '' sound ( not like you ) , we get `` jajaja '' ... which is just the same as your `` hahaha '' . 
  same sound , just a different way to put it . 
  people just type `` hahaha '' in spanish and it 's read like `` jajaja '' indistinctly in any case ... because of the influence of the rest of languages , english included . 
  lol rofl i 'm actually transmitting a laugh rofl lmao, 
  `` reality ( fake ) '', 
  same in mediterranean spain . 
  i get dizzy walking on that , but they look good in a static photograph . 
  there was a bubble , which is what you 're describing , but it was n't ( by far ) the first one we 've got , we 've got another 2 big , important bubbles that put us at 20 % unemployment rate in the past . 
  that 's part of the spanish economy , not about southern europe , portugal has like half the unemployment , and when i was speaking about pre-crisis levels i 'm speaking about gdp and gdp per capita , which are at pre-crisis levels right now and rising fast ... the government ca n't manipulate it because we juse the same eu criteria ( we 're obligated to ) , so that 's no excuse . 
  spain is still in crisis , although it 's no longer a `` no growth '' or debt one ... rather one about unemployment and poor employment conditions due to this . 
  this is inherent to the spanish labor market ... and how people work without the state knowing it ( otherwise , we would n't be in peace with a 26 % unemployment , just a couple years ago ) . 
  we know about inefficient spending ... do n't need to tell us lol . 
  but when you speak about that , i have to tell you the biggest failure in this is not a random airport with no planes in spain ... but the berlin airport that 's being worked on . 
  last time i checked , berlin is n't in southern europe . 
  and it 's not the only example , but it 's indeed the biggest right now . 
  you got ta park the prejudices and analyze things objectively . 
  it 's truth what you 've said about inefficient spending ... but there 's no peak reached if your economy which is the 4th biggest in the eurozone is the one that grows faster than anyone else among the big economies , even with that high unemployment . 
  oh , and we still invest heavily on the ave , because infraestructures are key in spain . 
  investnments ca n't stop just because some politicians wanted to do some shady contracts . 
  spain is already at pre-crisis levels of gdp and gdp per capita ( even higher now , surpassing italy due to their decades-long stagnation ) , so saying that a peak has been reached when spain was poor shit in 1950-1960 compared to the rest of europe and has been booming since then ( affected by the crisis when we 've had them ) it 's denying the fact that spain is no longer one of the poorest countries in europe . 
  quite the contrary , it 's very comparable or even very competitive with other western europe countries , like italy , and comparable although slightly inferior to france . 
  but if you said that spain/spaniards were as rich as south korea or new zealand in 1960 or 1970 ... they would call you crazy . 
  but that 's how it goes today , and we ca n't simply guarantee anything about the long-term economic future because it 's just not serious . 
  population is the key . 
  but these long-term economic or demographic predictions are completely and utterly useless . 
  everything could change and spain could have 60 or 70 million by then with a higher gdp per capita than now . 
  it happened .

  i 've been lied to all my life . 
  the * castillian vassal * kingdom of navarra #ftfy, 
  yes , please . 
  what does that even mean . 
  is your long answer `` noooo . '', 
  exactly , it 's always that level of irrational `` thinking '' .
