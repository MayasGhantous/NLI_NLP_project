  leave italy alone !!!, 
  lol your flag & flair combo . 
  spain  france . 
  all is well . 
  sure , we 're not denmark ( most transparent country in the world ) , but we 're not much different than france or the uk in that regard . 
  there 's a higher corruption ** perception ** right now but if you look at most indexes we appear to be very close to the rest of big eu countries being italy just a bit below . 
  you do n't go walking around the streets bribing the police forces so you do n't get fined or stuff like that . 
  that 's how you tell a country is extremely corrupt . 
  spain has problems with corruption but they 're not that different from the rest of w. europe . 
  otherwise we would n't look good in any index , including this one . 
  what 's going on with per\u00fa and what does it have to do with the finnish far right ? 
  also , i could play tennis on that guy 's forehead . 
  take that japan !, 
  or spain is not as corrupt as this subreddit and many spaniards think . 
  which is much more plausible than just giving a `` it 's the exception '' non-reason . 
   sorry guys you never apologize for saying the truth . 
  never . 
  brother !, 
  holy shit that parking gore . 
  yeah , no need to dox me , thanks . 
  trust me , it 's the first time we see it in a while . 
  here at least . 
  [ just a few kilometers north the city of madrid ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vtaumke.jpg ) 6\u00bac outside , but sunny after many days of cloudy/foggy/snowy / rainy/shitty weather . 
  fuck you , pirineos , you only had one job ... 
  til, 
  does n't look like a terrible place from the photos i 've seen . 
  i bet the gdp per capita is higher than here . 
  nah , that 's illios . 
  morella was in the national news three or four weeks ago because it snowed so hard [ they got like 100 l/m ^ 2 of snow in a couple of days ] ( http://www.levante-emv.com/castello/2017/01/22/nevada-morella-intensa-ultimo-siglo/1518808.html ) . 
  all the valencian coast and interior ( and even murcia , cartagena ... etc ) got their good share of snow in that front . 
  a couple of vids just to show how it was : - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gw8-xzzo6bu - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehdd-unqcki ps : driving from ireland to cartagena ? 
  niiice , was it as cool as i imagine ? 
  i have all the books from \u00c9rase una vez el hombre xd, 
  i do n't share your point of view , you start from the premise that there 's nothing else you can do , and every story is a failing story ... that 's a pessimistic way to see it , not a realistic way . 
  being realistic you would have considered all the attempts made by people , companies , governments , ngos ... that precisely look for them and try to avoid things that you describe . 
  but you did n't consider them , you only presented a scenario where they are `` left '' with nothing , no help , no integration programmes , nothing . 
  precisely that 's not how it works in spain , there 's shit going on , although the central government is n't helping ... luckily some regional and municipal governments are . 
  if poor , uneducated/unskilled native people in risk of poverty in spain can get benefits , then they can too because it fits that criteria . 
  ps : we have a muslim population , and they 're ** very ** well integrated actually . 
  they cause much less trouble than the gypsies that ironically have been here for centuries and there 's still a shit-ton of work to do with that . 
  how can you not find more prosperity in spain than in syria ? 
  by that rule , you wo n't find more prosperity in the netherlands than in syria . 
  i said that for someone that 's leaving a place where you simply ca n't live anymore any country in europe is and will meet the following criteria : - is at peace . 
  - will find more prosperity than the land they 're coming from . 
  that 's what i said and it 's exactly the case of spain and portugal , too . 
  they 're safe , rich countries where you can live and develop your life in peace . 
  the criteria is met for what i said . 
  what 's the misconception ? 
   most pp voters are pro-referendum are n't they said by who ? 
  or the contrary to that because of the sarcasm . 
  as i said , your top argument was a downvote . 
  i stand by what i said . 
  no , people do n't agree 100 % in everything whatever the party they vote have to say ... that 's dumb and simplistic . 
  but this is one of those * traditional independentist * law : simplify it , so you can ridiculize it . 
  spain is the most pro-refugee country in europe . 
  sadly ** the government ** is not . 
  holy shit xd, 
  they only want to go to some selected areas , but there 's a lot of ignorance and this is the reason why there are so many news relating how some refugees felt `` disappointed '' when they settled in germany and claimed they wanted to leave . 
  they are told they will have x but when they arrive they find y. 
  it 's common to find disappointment when you live something different to what was you expecting . 
  with spain there 's something similar ... maybe they expect much less so it 's not a priority destination . 
  but honestly if you have got to the point that you have to leave everything behind ... any country in europe can and will be enough for someone to try to live in peace and with some prosperity , really . 
  that 's what he does on almost every issue whatsoever . 
  just have a look at his reddit history . 
  you are talking about pp voters , not pp , so you switch to `` pp is this , pp is that '' when someone points out not all the pp voters are literally hitler and think the same . 
  but i see that your top argument is a downvote so i 'd rather leave it there . 
  there 's no reasoning behind someone that do n't want to be reasonable . 
  believe it or not , not all pp voters are literally franco . 
   it seems that every issue can be used to push for the independence agenda . 
  the few statistics i 've seen about this show that spain is the most pro-refugees in eu . 
  so i would n't say that . 
  like if catalonia was n't spain or something . 
  good to see catalonia is the vanguard on this issue , together with madrid . 
  well they 're very different . 
  toledo ( ohio ) is a typical modern-looking city while this one is millenia old . 
  toledo ( ohio ) might not be very touristy , but i bet it 's also a very good place to live . 
  that photo is depressing . 
  we get it , you lake, 
  i thought it was going to be higher . 
  oh you call it napolitana too , nice . 
  we should just unify our countries , this is the ultimate proof that we are the same fucking people . 
  napolitana is exactly how we call this `` pain au chocolat '' in spain, 
  no u, 
  yeah , medieval cities were n't made thinking in today 's private transport . 
  that 's why american cities are so different to european ones , like this one . 
  toledo could be the most representative example of a typical important medieval european city . 
  yes , you can actually drive through its streets , like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utndoufkya4 ) . 
  [ spain is far more than just a beach resort ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhus5bps65y ) . 
  that 's exactly what pedro s\u00e1nchez did ... before losing the elections ( and the control of the psoe ) lol . 
  good luck , jamoncito . 
  gibraltar comes right after that . 
  and andorra . 
  i 'm a republican but saying that being a republic means you get rid of corruption is just false . 
  also , i 'd vote republic in a referendum , because that 's just how i feel , but you also have to consider that a parlamentary monarchy is not entirely bad : look at norway , denmark , sweden , netherlands , uk ... 
  i do n't think they 're shit countries . 
  spain enjoys some advantages as well ( like a recognised long-lasting international `` vip '' ambassador to the world ), 
  bilbao covers them all , m9 . 
  if you want something similar ( and probably cheaper ) in spain try the provinces of cuenca , teruel or guadalajara . 
  lots of natural things to see , very low densely populated areas , beautiful scenary and fauna . 
  perfect rural places with no tourist massification at all ( just inner tourism , aka other spaniards visiting it and spending a week-end ),
