  in spanish we also use `` agradecer '' in a more formal way , as in `` te lo agaradezco '' ( i thank you - for this or that - ) . 
  idiot , they ca n't hurt a building with a machete . 
  il sorpasso : ** check ** next target : france . 
  let 's do disss . 
  [ * \\ [ a las barricadas intensifies \\ ] * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzagwc9g8wy ), 
  honestly they 're kind of right ... spain is not very used to spicy food . 
  por favor no hag\u00e1is tacos de paella . 
  yeah , best thing to happen to spain in recent years : the surge of a new political order ( at least in the parliament , for now ), 
  you 're watching too much house of cards . 
  i 'd never accomplish something like this ... so bravo . 
  i mean , the germans have mallorca as their outermost island . 
  enjoy it duuude, 
  but ... 
  i was taking a siesta ? 
  and you added a few to the `` yes '' side . 
  as i said , you 're not serious , so i 'll stop there . 
  manipulating is making up a number ( 55 % ) . 
  manipulating is saying there are more than 47 % in favor when those votes are the ones going to parties that explicitaly said `` we 're in favor and you 're voting yes '' . 
  others did n't do this , and they did n't participate ( while others are against and people know it ) and you 're counting them `` becaause it looks to you they belong there '' . 
  manipulating is exactly what you 're doing . 
  yes you need one , and you have to finish the legislature ( disoluci\u00f3n de las c\u00e1maras ) http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/titulos/articulos.jsp?ini=166&amp;fin=169&amp;tipo=2 you 're googling , but you 're not catching a thing . 
  article 168 is the important one in this case . 
  the discussion is `` we 're doing an independence referendum even if it 's against spanish law , and we will break it if needed '' . 
  it 's a much different stage than what you think . 
  plus it 's not me or your task to decide if a referendum must be done . 
  in all case , should be done here , not in the nl , the uk , or any other place , considering spain is a democratic country with its own set of rules and sovereignity , and that 's it . 
  you 're just making up numbers . 
  it 's a joke . 
   it was as illegal in the uk as it is today in spain . 
  i doubt it . 
  the uk did n't need to call for a referendum ( for the entire uk ) in order to change their law so they could then hold general elections and appoint the new people that will change their laws ... in order then to let scotland have their referendum . 
  we 're not the uk . 
  catalonia is not scotland . 
  you need to understand this . 
  you 're asking me how it is related ... 
  i 'm telling you how related it is having access to a taxpayer database that you should n't have access to in order to build your state contrary to the current law . 
  then you bring up corruption and `` others do illegal stuff too '' . 
  you 're not serious . 
  nice little hill you 've got there , holanda, 
  here 's the source for the public poll done by the catalan government : http://www.elmundo.es/cataluna/2016/12/29/5864eaf622601dfb658b45d8.html also 47 % for the independence does n't seem like a majority to me . 
  it never was , it never is , and it never will . 
  on the contrary i do n't think you 're wrong , i * know * you are , because our constitution clearly says a secession is not possible . 
  and in order to change that we must constitute a `` constitutional legislature '' , hold a referendum and then general elections again . 
  it 's not an easy process as it touches the core texts in the constitution . 
  that they are illegaly playing with data they should n't have from the citizens according to the current law in order to build state-related structures ? 
  if you think it 's not related to the independentist process then you have the problem , not me . 
  if you agree law should be respected in the netherlands you should too agree law should be respected in spain , otherwise you 're not being coherent . 
  it could , but it ca n't be hold without a constitutional amendment . 
  and that 's what it must be voted first . 
  otherwise it 's not legal . 
  that 's not a newspaper poll . 
  it 's a public poll done by the generalitat itself ( catalan government ) . 
  and the independentist parties already went `` all in '' with their last autonomic elections : they did not win in popular vote ( something like 47 % ) . 
  all independentists parties said clearly `` you 're voting yes with this vote , vote something else and you 're not voting for '' . 
  and the catalans did n't vote majoritarily for the yes parties , percentage-wise . 
  and you can bet that the independentists voted for them , while others catalans that do n't necessarily agree did n't want to play that game . 
  i think 5 million votes is an enough big sample . 
  is there a problem in not agreeing with you ? 
  there 's your answer . 
  you should check https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5qt5e7/catalonia_seeks_eu_support_for_secession_vote/dd1zegm/, 
  looks like the other does n't want to , either . 
  - 46,8 % are against . 
  - 45,3 % are in favor . 
  also , numbers of those that `` consider themselves only catalan '' are dropping hard . 
  source ( a major catalan newspaper btw ) : http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20170129/413802206756/sondeo-ceo-aumento-identidad-mixta-catalan-espanol.html what you read in reddit does n't necesarily mean is what happens in reality . 
  when an independentist say `` we catalans '' he or she really means `` we catalan * independentists * '', 
  you 're comparing two situations that have nothing to do with eachother : the catalans are able to vote democratically and chose their representatives ( that 's why there are independentists now in power ) ... women were not . 
  you 're not asking for `` let the catalans vote '' , but `` you spanish people need to allow constitutional law-breaking actions within your country '' out of a democratic constitution , on par with the most democratic ones . 
  how 's that democratic . 
  why not you ask us to change our constitution first ? 
  or ask the independentist movement to not hold on illegal fiscal data . 
  good for you . 
  i guess that 's legal in the uk . 
  it is n't in spain and there 's no easy way to hold an independence referendum because there are core elements in our current constitution against that . 
  if you want to suggest something then ask the independentists to try a legal way to push their agenda , instead of collecting fiscal data illegaly or doing political lists . 
   does that mean what norwegians call it is wrong ? 
  i never said `` falklands '' is wrong . 
  the only one that `` fixed '' how it is called was you ... and it still no needs fixing since malvinas is how spanish speakers call them , and * will * call them . 
  there are more spanish native speakers calling them malvinas than english native speakers calling them falklands . 
  try to colonize more next time \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af  we gave scotland their referendm no , you did n't . 
  cameron did , he was a fool and called for it when the results were n't as tight in the polls . 
  he did it for political reasons as he thought it would play good for him , not for the convincement of any democratic value , and he actually almost destroyed the uk . 
  oh , forgot to mention he resigned because after supporting the `` yes '' in a eu exit referendum that he himself called in order to put some pressure on the eu whilst trying to stop ukip eating their voters . 
  so , no thanks , we are not taking any lessons from you . 
  we already have our own cynical politicans . 
   spain should really give them one vote no we should n't ? 
  since when it is `` the only fair thing to do '' to ignore the constitutional law of a democratic country , being suggested from outside the country itself to do something against our own constitution ? 
  i know it 's the cool thing to do , support the independentists that are actually making lists of `` pro '' or `` against '' judges and collecting illegal fiscal data , but i 'm so tired of having to read what we should do from outside when you 've got your own shit as well . 
  well maybe you should give up on gibraltar , malvinas and gtfo of the union without any negotiation because you voted for it and have your monarchy dismantled so you can have a republic and vote different parties because bipartidism sucks and ... . 
  crazy how some people still think `` madrid '' is the one having fascist twitches and ignore that the independentist movement in catalonia is preparing lists of `` pro or against '' judges in case of unilateral independence against the democratic laws . 
  and this was said by one their symbolic figures in one of their meetings as you just mentioned , not me . 
  i died a little - laughing of course . 
  france is one of the big countries ( for european standards ) , sure normandy is not exactly `` southern europe '' but all of occitania and the french mediterranean coast is , i.e. 
  you cut france in two . 
  we 're talking about geography , oui . 
  ### [ fuck yeah , mega ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0wvn-9bxvc ) !, 
  i doubt it . 
  they can , just like spain is grouped in two of them : western and southern . 
  also that france has influenced the rest of the continent more than anyone else does n't mean they suddenly lose their origins , background , romance/latin culture and life style etc. 
  it 's like saying that the us is not an anglo country because it has influenced the world so much .
