  studying and playing diablo 3 when taking breaks . 
  like if those pesky english were going to help you this time !, 
  ** now ** . 
  [ it also reflects how we beat your ass giving equal marriage to everyone before you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if721j69iq4 ) . 
  suck it , portugal !, 
  it 's the only thing i can say about spain that i 'm proud of in recent times . 
  fuck it , i 'm done , i 'm moving to portugal, 
  beer mostly i 'd say . 
  also wine but only during meals , and almost always if you go to restaurants . 
  beer is for snack/tapas time , hanging out with friends in an afternoon and stuff like that . 
  but i do n't drink any alcohol , at all . 
  i do smoke weed occasionally though . 
  less bad consequences imo . 
  we do n't . 
  shut up and deny it if someone else asks you again . 
  look at them , so keewwt ~ !, 
  i never liked this , but if it 's fun for tourism then it 's ok . 
  bad , andorra !, 
  i told you not to hide the moneis !, 
  but at least * i * have the chance to decide . 
  the same happens in a general election when voting for a political party . 
  it 's a drop in a pond . 
  but it 's the pond that counts , and the sum of all drops . 
  no pond , no party . 
  and the pond is the democratic , elective system that sweden and spain have for chosing the ruling party/prime minister , parliament etc. 
  except for the chief of state . 
  because they are more literate with a non-democratic , non-elective chief of state that it 's inherited in a particular family ? 
  in madrid , probably this one https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_castle_of_manzanares_el_real, 
  considering i live in castille ( literally means `` castles '' , or the land of castles ) ... they 're * [ everywhere ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_castles_in_spain ) * . 
  they are all playing dota 2, 
  flamenco and toros . 
  i 'd rather buy an xbox myself than spreading that around & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;, 
  pm 'd you . 
  sorry , interior ones , but close to madrid , 
  i 've been in paris and other minor cities in portugal and france , but going to [ valen\u00e7a do minho ] ( http://www.muralladigital.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/foto-valenca.jpg ) was like time travelling back to the middle ages , in a good sense . 
  it 's like [ toledo ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-02lfzy8ynac/ve6lebupxni/aaaaaaaapyo/mt7x9qs_fi4/s1600/2014.10.toledo015.jpg ) but little . 
  it 's my favorite experience so far . 
  you 're still in time in spain . 
  i know some flats that were 200.000 $ during the bubble that are now 25.000 $ and they still ca n't sell them . 
  the problem is that there are no warranty that it wo n't keep falling . 
  there are a lot of empty houses in spain hold by the banks , 
   `` we 're the master race '' maybe they were not neonazis but members of / r/pcmasterrace i mean , i am also part of the master race and if someone came to my country with an xbox or something i 'd piss them in the face and invite them to get the fuck out , of course . 
  [ ocho apellidos catalanes ] ( http://www.filmaffinity.com/es/film264280.html ) is on its way if you 're interested :p, 
  i would n't mind if people did that this way , and not viceversa ( english in cursive ) . 
  * who * , not * what * , 
  i look forward being able to decide who represents the spanish state . 
   my behind is sensitive . 
  needs more jpg, 
  the thing is that most catalans feel spanish themselves in some degree . 
  some feel more catalan than spanish , others feel more spanish than catalan , but my point is that being catalan does n't exclude being spanish . 
  it 's like being andalousian , aragonese , asturian , galician , basque , madrilenian ... and so forth . 
  sure there 's a quite important portion of citizens ( it 's been around 30-35 % historically ) that legitimatelly do n't want to be part of spain , but that does n't mean catalans are n't spaniards , at all . 
   our own oppressors . 
  unless it was in franco 's time , who opressed all the spaniards and not just two of its people , i do n't think this is correct at all . 
  there 's no oppression against catalans or basques today . 
  even the spanish language is trated as a second-level language today in some places , favoring the catalan . 
  so quit your bullshit already . 
  i promise to you that no one believes it . 
  spanish people do n't hate catalans . 
  spanish people are annoyed of catalan independentists , that 's not the same at all . 
  but trust me , even in catalonia they are quite annoyed of them too . 
  they need to do a parlamentary election with ley d'hondt because otherwise they would n't have a chance to win a independentist referendum when it happens , because it will happen sooner or later . 
  the current pro-independence government of catalonia says 50 % is against independentism . 
  only 42 % in favour . 
  according to the latest poll . 
  do n't forget about / r/spain , if you combine them it 's on par . 
  but it 's quite low still . 
   in the usa as far as i know they have the whole ` foreclosure ' thing where you can just hand the house to the bank and cancel the mortgage ( and the bank are left holding the bag if the value of the property has gone south ) yes , that 's what we call daci\u00f3n en pago , that the pah and most society has been asking for . 
   also spanish property agents can die in a fire seriously tell us something we do n't know !, 
  yes , daci\u00f3n en pago , which is almost non-existant in spain . 
  have you ever heard about plataforma de afectados por la hipoteca ( pah ) ? 
  maybe you have heard about ada colau and the ilp they prepared ... or you heard about that later , when she became mayor of barcelona . 
  you must been hiding in a cave all this time if you 're from spain and did n't hear anything of this and why it had so much traction . 
  becase . 
  you . 
  are . 
  screwed . 
  if you happen to not be able to pay for your house - you are evicted , end with no house but still got to pay for the mortgage . 
  and this is the 99 % of the cases . 
  not nearly a `` half '' truth but a big full one . 
   * please / r/quityourbullshit * kek , so edgy m8 . 
  do you think the average spaniard benefited from something that parimarily benefited the top strata ? 
  hell , even today what benefits the top strata * usually * means it 's bad for the common people , yet they do a very good job selling it as an `` improvement '' for the country and the people . 
  bullshit most of the time . 
  same . 
  playing videogames over the internet ... take that , parents of the world !, 
  it is , i just mean that it 's not the same having 20 % unemployment rate in a developed country than in an underdeveloped one . 
  honestly i 've always found it as bad as it is now . 
  we do n't have the representation we are supposed to have for a nearly 50 million country . 
  personally i do n't feel either way . 
  i just think it 's great to have a huge spanish-speaking world , bigger than the english actually , but that 's just one consequence , of many others . 
  what i dislike is when xxi century citizens in spain get critized for something that xv century citizens did . 
  hell , i do n't even understand why it 's spanish citizens , being and living in spain , getting critized for that , because it would actually be the people that move to america who did the bad things . 
  the people that stayed in europe did n't perform them , and we 're actually the descendence of these people , not the people that moved to america . 
  that 's my only ` complain ' about this , there are others that are more known though , like what la p\u00e9rfida albion did with their propaganda ... [ the spanish black legend ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_legend ) :p, 
  well , we got yours :p, 
  i live in a middle-low class neighbourhood in a big city and i also go to my town from time to time , and tbh the only big problems i 've found all this years of crisis are some people being evicted , although the support from family , friends and all neighbours have been great , because in spain when you get evicted you keep paying for the house ... which is crazy . 
  other than that , the problem is that spain has a huge under-the-table labor market where you work for somewhat shitty conditions . 
  social security payments are very expensive for the employer , and that 's also another reason why this happens and why the 20 + % unemployment is not as high in reality - otherwise we would be in a very delicated problem with crime figures rising over the board ( it 's on a record low ) , or in a revolutionary status ( politics are changing which is very good but not getting out of hand ... we did n't get neo-nazis here for example ) . 
  and i could say the same about my surroundings .
