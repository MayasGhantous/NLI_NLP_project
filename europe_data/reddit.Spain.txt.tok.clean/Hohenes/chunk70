  orgasmic . 
  it 's a mix of reasons , not just a single and simple answer that just `` explains it '' . 
  i 'm on mobile atm but i can resume it in the conjuction of five big aspects : higher undeclared work , higher seasonal employment , industrial dismantlement in the 80s , `` cultura del pelotazo '' and other minor cultural differences that just add to the sum . 
  all in all i have to say that this figure ca n't simply happen in a country like germany or the netherlands , for example , without having a big social implosion . 
  in spain this figure is n't as real though , due to the previous reasons ( especially undeclared work ) , but this does n't mean spaniards do n't want to pay their taxes etc. 
  we actually pay a lot , even people like myself that barely can beat the average spanish net salary per month ( which is 1600 $ ) . 
  i agree it 's a beautiful flag . 
  [ glorious indeed ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pg1j0ox.jpg ) # ** msra ** ( make spain republican again ), 
  nice casual pr there . 
  i 'd take this [ danish policeman ] ( http://i.imgur.com/woaisqj.jpg ) instead \u2665 o \u2665, 
  hard to believe we 've been at 26 % unemployment rate two years ago and even with minus 7 % today still is a massive unemployment figure . 
  with `` around here '' you mean the united unemployed iberian ~ ~ republics ~ ~ republic plus monarchy ( uuirm ) ? 
  for a 30k andalusian village ? 
  nah , it 's just not worth the hassle m8 . 
  since when i defended a territory should be given back to the previous country that held it ? 
  you all seem so defensive about this , i do n't even give a flying fuck about the tiny village of gibraltar . 
  literally no one besides * some * politicians care about gibraltar in spain . 
  it 's just a smokescreen they use when they do n't want to talk about something else . 
  but it seems this issue is used by the british to boost their little ego left . 
  but i also do n't give a fuck about that ( and their salty downvotes ) . 
  i just live happy , man . 
  the point being ... ? 
  ceuta and melilla were never moroccan , that 's what i 'm talking about . 
  i could n't care less about gibraltar and the need the british seem to have to tell themselves they 're still relevant and `` care '' for their remaining colonies . 
  that includes the rage-ish downvotes from them . 
  to give something back means they should have had it beforehand . 
  ceuta and melilla were never moroccan . 
  junkrat is ez , he really has no escape ... and if he uses his shift to escape then he loses a lot of burst `` oh shit '' damage . 
  regarding phara ... just a good ol' hitscan should be enough . 
  but she can be a bitch when poking in and out with her rockets , especially if she has a very good aim . 
  vilaweb is like la raz\u00f3n or even worse . 
  it really makes you think if there are people that actually eat all their bs . 
  aww , that 's some nice love between compatriots , i love you too guys \u2665, 
  lol , do you play competitive ? 
  i 'm sitting around 3.7 k right now in master with no one to play because i ranked way too high for the friend i usually play with this season :(, 
  i mean , soldier 76 and reinhardt are sexy af . 
  i mean , not even the usual shitty topics like flamenco , toros , sangr\u00eda , san ferm\u00edn ... etc ? 
  lol because that 's actually worldwide known . 
  that 's not the spanish or portuguese usual landscape . 
  youth unemployment is over 20 % in most europe . 
  so what makes iberia look like northern africa for a country way below iberia 's standards ? 
  they better do n't know what we think about them if they think * we * are the ones below european averages xd, 
  [ kidding ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tvhbz7l.jpg ) that 's m\u00e1laga , for those who do n't know . 
  unemployment rate in spain is 18.4 % , not 25 % ( it was 2 years ago ), 
  so basically , the past day 29th of december they were detained and some ak47 and ammo was found in madrid . 
  today the judge says they were preparing a `` very serious terrorist act in the capital '' , and a video showing plaza de sol was found , together with a daesh flag . 
  this subreddit wo n't let me post the source , which is fucking stupid because it 's the only source in english , even if it 's a `` tabloid source '' and it 's just a copy-paste of a translated version of this one . 
  but just look for the titlte '' spanish police hold suspected jihadists who were planning to bomb madrid '' , it 's on express.co.uk ( yeah it 's shit but what do i do if it 's the only source in english ? 
  i checked and it 's the same article as the spanish one ), 
  source in spanish : http://cadenaser.com/ser/2017/01/04/tribunales/1483525431_439436.html so basically , 29th of december they were detained and some ak47 and ammo was found in madrid . 
  today the judge says they were preparing a `` very serious terrorist act in the capital '' , and a video showing plaza de sol was found , together with a daesh flag . 
  i do . 
  it 's quite common in spain . 
  we know . 
  i 'm just joking . 
  i know , right !? 
  ... . . ... . russians are europeans , too . 
  til disagreeing from your political views with someone like you is being a troll . 
  trully representative of the intolerance and lack of empathy of the independentism . 
  you win this round . 
  but we have olivenza !, 
  i guess most of the spanish posters are tired of independentists arrogance and ignorance . 
  people is tired of the independentists , but never tired of the catalans . 
  we are not tired of ourselves , because catalans are spaniards . 
  yet you sent me a random link that has nothing to do with me or what i think ... like the terrorist with you . 
  you get me now ? 
  and tbh , you insulted me in the first place with your accusation . 
   without the need to stalk your post history da fuck ? 
  i did n't even know what the fuck were you talking about threatening , i do n't threat people over the internet ( or irl ) , all i did was answering a comment i found in this thread . 
  this one comes with an extra egocentric flavour i see . 
   yes !, 
  well i do n't think you are a terrorist sympathiser , but your accusation and then answer makes me think you 're an idiot . 
  at least you 're graduated in history lol . 
   are you accusing me of being a terrorist sympathiser ? 
  does this mean you were accusing me of supporting what you sent me ? 
  then you might have the answer , trully , it 's all yours . 
   i do support independence congrats . 
  the point ? 
  and another random link . 
  here , i 'll give you another one : http://societat.e-noticies.cat/una-historiadora-tracta-els-castellanoparlants-de-colons--83568.html your turn !!, 
   that boina holy shit i 'm starting to think that you have a weird fetish . 
  you 're such a weirdo . 
  you must find something sexy about those [ boina-wearing tards clapping their own version of nazism ] ( http://societat.e-noticies.cat/una-historiadora-tracta-els-castellanoparlants-de-colons--83568.html ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-determination#self-determination_versus_territorial_integrity  national self-determination appears to challenge the principle of territorial integrity ( or sovereignty ) of states as it is the will of the people that makes a state legitimate . 
  this implies a people should be free to choose their own state and its territorial boundaries . 
  however , there are far more self-identified nations than there are existing states and there is no legal process to redraw state boundaries according to the will of these peoples . 
  [ 44 ] according to the helsinki final act of 1975 , the un , icj and international law experts , there is no contradiction between the principles of self-determination and territorial integrity , with the latter taking precedence . 
   allen buchanan , author of seven books on self-determination and secession , supports territorial integrity as a moral and legal aspect of constitutional democracy . 
  however , he also advances a `` remedial rights only theory '' where a group has `` a general right to secede if and only if it has suffered certain injustices , for which secession is the appropriate remedy of last resort . '', 
  he also would recognize secession if the state grants , or the constitution includes , a right to secede . 
   vita gudeleviciute holds that in cases of non-self-governing peoples and foreign military occupation the principle of self-determination trumps that of territorial integrity . 
  in cases where people lack representation by a state 's government , they also may be considered a separate people , but under current law can not claim the right to self-determination . 
  on the other hand , she finds that secession within a single state is a domestic matter not covered by international law . 
  thus there are no on what groups may constitute a seceding people . 
  there is a shit-ton of lecture about this , but all in all we can agree that catalans are not being opressed or that they are allowed to self-govern ... which is also one of the key things ( self-government ) . 
  nah they actually give a fuck . 
  just a single fuck tho !, 
  let [ them ] ( http://www.echr.coe.int/pages/home.aspx?p=home ) know . 
  and if there 's something and it is proven , spain should be condemned and the people that are victims repaired the best way possible .
