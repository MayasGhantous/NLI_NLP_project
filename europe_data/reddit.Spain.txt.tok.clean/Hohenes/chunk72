  maybe heterosexual men are statistically more insecure of their own sexuality . 
  who knows . 
  you just mentioned an extreme case that does n't actually represent the reality behind transexuality . 
  yes of course there are parents that do all kind of abuses ... including that one . 
  and even worse type of abuses . 
  but this is not about abusing your child . 
  it 's about understanding what 's going on . 
  that mother was crazy and it 's just an example of herself and her crazyness and child abuse . 
  and do n't oversimplify things like that . 
  playing with barbies has little to do with this . 
  or nothing , at all . 
  it 's very common to start at the ages of 8-9 , and even as early as 6 according to the [ university of michigan ] ( http://www.med.umich.edu/yourchild/topics/masturb.htm ) and many other behavior investigations . 
  sexuality is a long road that starts very early . 
  how it is treated in our society because of taboos is another story . 
  i 'm ok with that , but in the usual public bathroom for men there are walled urinals next to eachother and you prefer to use those instead of the stall because otherwise you 're prone to find more surprises ( i mean this sounds comical but it 's the fucking truth ) . 
  i usually just go to the stall just because i feel uncomfortable next to random guys peeing in those . 
  maybe it has nothing with sexual orientation , it 's just how some people are and the need of more privacy ... the degree of needed privacy is not a fixed amount . 
  question : are you not comfortable with women walking behind when you pee in a public bathroom , but you 're ok with a gay guy walking behind when you pee ? 
  i can imagine the reply to that has to do with people usually thinking in a subconscious way someone is straight `` by default '' , but i wonder if it 's something about the gender or just the sexual orientation in your case . 
  as a gay man i do feel uncomfortable with other random guys in the bathroom most of the time . 
  so i do understand the need to have separate bathrooms . 
  maybe / u/kace91 does n't mind his gay friend to be in the bathroom with him , but he 's not considering if the gay friend is fine as well . 
  he might not . 
  of course there might be other gay guys that are ok with the situation . 
  i 'm not asking for separate bathrooms here for gay people , obviously . 
  it 's something i have to live with the entire of my life and take it/accept it in the most natural way possible , though . 
  kidding ? 
  when did you start to masturbate ? 
  do you even remember ? 
  do you really believe the parents are going to induce their child to be the opposite of what they actually are ? 
  that 's what 's dangerous , and asking a child to be something do n't feel in the most basic level is going to be bad for them ... for their whole life . 
  the parents are the ones discovering their child feels something that 's not quite right . 
  that 's the case in ... all the cases . 
  i do n't think you are able to determine that . 
  transexuality is part of the human sexuality and has been like ... forever , and it 's not a pathology . 
  except you 're comparing a pervert in a cheeky cartoon show for adults with a real issue suffered by real people . 
  looks very average to me . 
  white skin , dark eyes/hair . 
  pretty average . 
  it 's ok you 're greek , so you must be hot by default . 
  now kith . 
  yeah , french is quite exaggerated imo . 
  it 's on par with english for diplomacy . 
  that 's not too real . 
  felipe vi is there on par with uk 's grandma . 
  precisely ... a lone wolf is much much harder to predict than organized groups . 
  it is the anglican inquisition . 
  well ... here i am . 
  now come back , arag\u00f3n misses you . 
  and the [ duchy of athens ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duchy_of_athens#aragonese_domination ) as well . 
  also known as mr. toasty, 
  graciasssssss, 
  except not . 
  we had enough in [ march , 2004 ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/atentados_del_11_de_marzo_de_2004 ) . 
  we do n't need another one . 
  ohhh , you think i 'm lame , and you downvoted me on top of that ... ooooh no i 'm going to end my life :'( k no one , goodbye . 
  someone is taking it too seriously . 
  it 's ok it 's ok you 're cool for trying to assert they 're not comparable events due to your superior cultural and educated background that makes it impossible to take ... a joke . 
  holy ** sssssshiiiit ** it 's true i know am a yihadi !, 
  wait , no i 'm not . 
  it 's not flat , quite abrupt and hills-y , with many important mountain ranges crossing the meseta and bordering it , and two big valleys as borders as well . 
  but some areas are boring [ because they 're empty ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uwereak.jpg ) . 
  i would n't be so sure ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  ok it was n't a french art exhibition but relax baguette pls, 
   our highest mountain is a full 887 meters \u0ca0_\u0ca0 that 's * almost * like the average altitude i 've got ~ 500km in a circle around me lol and without counting the ** proper ** mountains . 
  i would have thought like you if we were in the middle of the summer ( or so , i think ) , when turk-rus relations were terribad because of a series of incidents . 
  today they 're kind of friends again so ... while this is bad i do n't think it will trigger a full blown open war or something . 
  heir to the austro hungarian empire is shot dead !, 
   given that i 've got you at around -49 ( now -50 ) in res and tagged as `` that hater '' , oh , [ what a coincidence ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6ad5ho2.png ) . 
   trolls like you  trolls http://i.imgur.com/mkyineg.png keep up the pro arguments btw . 
  lol . 
   nuff said exactly , you have said enough to be considered an irrelevant idiot whose opinion is based on generalisations of an entire country or ethnicity . 
  fyi i do n't think all catalans are like you , do n't worry . 
  catalonia is not a colony , nor portugal was a democracy with the current set of rules internationally accepted when that happened . 
  stop doing such absurd comparisions . 
  they do n't work . 
  they 're not logical . 
  wtf generalising like that you 're proving yourself to be an idiot to be quite honest . 
  it 's like ... no one is going to take you seriously . 
  step up your `` arguments '' , jesus christ . 
  til catalonia is detached from the rest of spain respecting its history , culture ... see ? 
  this is why this is an opinion subject , not something clearly objective . 
  are they independent now ? 
  and now ? 
  and now ? 
  and now ? 
  1600 $ is the average , lol , i wish we had higher salaries ... but overall i wish i had an higher salary . 
  at least closer to or above that average , 
  heh , that 's a good commercial . 
  but yeah , we definitely do n't do economies xd, 
  not really , i do n't have enough to save a lot , and many months i ca n't save money at all . 
  my wage is just a bit more than half the average salary in spain ( which is 1600 $ ) , and i do pay rent and have an old car . 
  so no it 's not about the money , it 's never about the money . 
  spain is quite a enjoyable place , the world out there can fucking shit to be honest . 
  depending what you look for i guess , but here you can find a balanced sweetspot imo . 
  i do n't know , the criteria can be anything , just like who 's the best country . 
  that 's why i say it 's one of the best , ca n't be top at everything . 
  weird , because the spanish quality of life is very high , while having extraordinarialy high expectancy of life . 
  the way of life is known as well . 
  we bitch a lot but the good things are pretty damn good .
