  and yes , people in my surroundings do say this as well . 
  so you already know , at least , one , 
  i hate football , but i have online gaming to cover that , it 's all ok . 
  '' ... and still are one the best countries to be in the world '' \u00af \\ \\ \\ ( \u30c4 ) / \u00af, 
  we are getting crazy foggy days too in all of the interior of spain , too . 
  in madrid particularly , it 's been extremely dangerous for traffic . 
  visibility was almost 0 m. 
  no , not really . 
  but they 're part of the african continent , geographically . 
  together we make the southwesternmost point of yurop , aka best corner in yurop . 
  why portugal ? 
  he 's going to end in tarifa , c\u00e1diz ; the southernmost point of continental europe because he 's doing a north-to-south run . 
  this is definitely portuguese , moroccans , romanians and latin americans going back to their places . 
  we do n't have spaniards emigrating to those places ( we have had spaniards emigrating to uk , germany or other northern locations instead ), 
   do you also prepare food and drink for the kings and their camels ? 
  yep . 
  usually cookies and milk . 
  sometimes ... `` adult drinks '' ;-), 
   half spanish half argentinian holy shit you must hate the british to no end . 
  lol, 
  kids do n't come back to school until january 8th , usually . 
  not stupid , just tradition . 
  it 's not spanish tho . 
  in spanish is `` genital '' xd i did n't know it was genitale in italian . 
  i just made it up because it sounded italian enough . 
  i 'm so glad i nailed it 8 ), 
  reyes magos or three wise men or just the magi were a group of three that visited and bring gifts to jesus after his birth , according to christian tales . 
  remember what christmas represent ? 
  yes ... jesus birth . 
  and they bring gift to jesus because of his birth . 
  there 's no discussion that they 're part of christmas in the most strict sense , and it is celebrated as part of it in spain , wether we are `` wrong '' or not to you , in spain we all assume it part of christmas , therefore they are christmas gift-bringers . 
  probably in the most pure form , most attached to original christian mythology . 
  santa claus is fucking coca-cola marketing . 
  it 's part of the season decoration , but [ bel\u00e9n ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nativity_scene ) is even more popular , inside the houses . 
  you 're wrong , they do bring presents , in spain christmas end the 7th of january . 
  reyes magos is part of the festivities . 
  not just giftbringers but christmas giftbringers , yes . 
  it bacame very common , but it never overrided reyes magos , plus nowadays is quite the contrary , being less relevant than what it was 15 or 20 years ago . 
  kids still get presents , but the most important come 6th of january , usually . 
  spanish news sold it like it was going to be months . 
  what about genitale, 
  ** for spain is so wrong ** . 
  reyes magos is the most important , it 's not fair to put it on the same place as pap\u00e1 noel . 
  this map needs some fixing . 
  reyes magos are the typical spanish xmas gift-bringers . 
  pap\u00e1 noel is just imported shit and it 's much , much more irrelevant . 
  that 's stupid . 
  if they were not going to be portuguese they would have been spanish . 
  and it would n't have been too different . 
  but being an english colony does n't mean shit , look at south africa or nigeria . 
  the only added perk is the language . 
  it is now , too . 
   sorry to ask what the fuck how do you even dare you fucking piece of shi 'm joking, 
  let us remind you of this [ badass guy ] ( http://www.badassoftheweek.com/blasdelezo.html ) , or this [ fight ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_ponta_delgada ) where we kicked your ass for a nth time , you pirate !, 
  oh , and you 're the third language . 
  [ we are second ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers#nationalencyklopedin ) by native speakers \u2665 miguel de cervantes  william shakespeare and please , start paying us for the use of `` the empire on which the sun never sets '' . 
  because [ its ours ] ( https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/philip_ii_of_spain ) . 
  refered to ... us . 
  kthx . 
  i always answer to this with : make olivenza/oliven \u00e7a the dc , and do like brazil and other countries did in the past , building a capital from scratch . 
  but the most obvious choice would be ( to me ) having the three different powers in the three big cities and very representatives of iberia : barcelona , madrid and lisboa , and i do n't care if it 's lisboa the `` head '' of all three or the one with the most political/executive power . 
  you are strongly against the idea and i respect that . 
  good thing it 's not the opinion of 10 + million others . 
  i can see that , but it would be an ad hominem as well . 
  we 're talking about the source here , not if this or that information is exagerated , or manipulated . 
  if you reject all the information without even stopping to analyze , trash the shitty/shady stuff and contrast everything else then we could do that with everything else . 
  abc is shit to me , but denying the source itself is a huge ad hominem . 
  i was too messing around until i got downvoted just for messing with you together , so felt like it was time to let them learn some history , 
  i never complained about that . 
  remember that [ * we * , together as brothers , did fine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_tordesillas ) . 
  as all brothers , they fighted from time to time when they were younger . 
  let 's build a freely , democratically and mutually chosen federalized europe/iberia - the second if the first fails -  no kings allowed . 
  ok , with our pussy . 
  we did that already . 
  sorry but it did n't work . 
  the catalans hated the french kings . 
  that 's why 1714 happened and not because `` hurr durr , muh freedom '' . 
  they did n't want a french king with the french ideals of that time . 
  oh believe me , this is the kind of daily news we have to deal with , here . 
  they just usually do n't make it to / r/europe or outside of spain overall . 
  you just need to learn about the catalan embassies , paid by all the catalans , independentists or not . 
  and you think it would have been different if it was done by conquest instead of inheritance ? 
  also , you 're [ wrong ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_the_portuguese_succession ) . 
  very , very [ wrong ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_ponta_delgada ) . 
  we no need to prove anything . 
  it 's not that time anymore . 
  you can give me a list of battles won by portugal and i can give you a list of battles won by spain/castille . 
  i just find it stupid , spain lost that ambition 500 + years ago , when spain itself was taking shape as one of the first modern `` countries '' . 
  there was a time that every christian kingdom had the ambition to unify `` hispania '' , but this sounds fucking ancient to spanish ears ... so do n't worry . 
  it 's not that time anymore , but spain was a global empire and today the heritage is a language shared by half a billion people in the planet . 
  i do n't think we need to prove anything , so you can have all the curiosity you want , 
  we 'll ask / r/france and / r/unitedkingdom help to beat fascism and for democracy . 
  they 'll totally allow fascism instead and we 'll kill each other trying not to get our democratic republic fucked up by half the army . 
  and that 's it for / r/spain because the next 40 years are boring and we 'll be playing with our dick alone since noone would bang us . 
  you mean before we own it and its colonies for 60 + years or after that ? 
  oh ffs the people in those cities are not moroccan . 
  it 's like saying zaragoza or m\u00e9rida should be given back to the romans . 
  merida and zaragoza are not romans anymore . 
  ceuta and melilla are not maghreb anymore . 
  ca n't you see that ?
