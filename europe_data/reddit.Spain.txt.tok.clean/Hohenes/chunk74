  i think i 'll pass from your bullshit revisionism , thanks . 
  worst part is you probably do n't even know what really happened because of the much bullshit you have to tell yourself and others in extension . 
  speaking of which ... 
  i think that 's the problem ... that you just do n't get it . 
  otherwise you would understand what you just said is unfair for the rest of spaniards repressed ... to say the least . 
  yes , i agree with you . 
  but just to make it clear . 
  it 's not a consolation tho . 
   the `` other june '' is arriving and you are getting nervous . 
  are the farmers revolting again ? 
  and you talk about reviosinism and then talk about a farmer 's revolt hundreds of years before the origin of nationalism and you pass it like it was a liberation war for national freedom . 
  fucking sad you are . 
   in some other ones , the repression reached to many more aspects of someone 's life . 
  my grandgrandparents were fusilated by the fascists , and they were `` castillian '' like you are depicting them ( i mean , they were not awesome enough to speak catalan ) . 
  are you aware there 's no `` more aspects to reach '' in there ? 
  they were eliminated and that includes the ability to speak their native language , too . 
  just fuck off , so tired of your shit . 
  so the only good ones are vilaweb and naci\u00f3 digital amirite ? 
  yes , they 're crap , but those that i 've just mentioned are just as bad . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ad_hominem i thought you wanted to learn something that 's not manipulated by the evil spanish government or those fucking fachas from the meseta , man . 
  you wish , 
  til agriculture is only for poor people . 
  i guess rich people do n't eat anything related to agriculture amirite ? 
  as i said , i did n't mention every place but of course i count with mediterranean france , 
  well , portugal is not a big producer , and there are quite a few more mediterranean countries that i did not mention either , but of course you 're in the list of cool kids ... so you 're welcome !, 
  good , good , but thank * you * for the tree . 
  sadly the olive oil industry in spain is a shame . 
  they sell in bulk to italian producers that then sell that under their own brand with a much higher profit , just because the spanish producers just want to get rid of it asap . 
  if they were smarter , they 'd build a brand around it and sell it like the italians do . 
  this is why italian olive oil is more known in the world despite spain being the top producer , but there 's actually a very high chance that your `` italian olive oil '' was actually produced in spain . 
  varear is the act of knocking down the fruits of trees in order to harvest them . 
  vareando is just the gerund . 
  this video is a parody of bailando ( gerund of bailar , to dance ) , a musical video by [ enrique iglesias ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nusovldfqzg ) . 
  to be honest green olive is the most common in spain as well , so ca n't really tell why is that different from your case . 
  might be a climate thing indeed . 
  fuck that , life without olives is like life without sex . 
  it depends . 
  i ** believe ** september is not really that usual , and depending on the olive type it is done from november until december or a bit more late ( in the case of black olives ) . 
  even in january and february is not super rare . 
  this is obviously a parody though , and it might not represent 100 % the reality of the spanish olive harvest season , actually :p  olives are harvested in the autumn and winter . 
  more specifically in the northern hemisphere , green olives are picked from the end of september to about the middle of november . 
  blond olives are picked from the middle of october to the end of november , and black olives are collected from the middle of november to the end of january or early february . 
  in southern europe , harvesting is done for several weeks in winter , but the time varies in each country , and with the season and the cultivar . 
  -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olive#harvest_and_processing we used to harvest the single olive tree that my grandfather had in his yard , in the town ( also in castilla-la mancha , the region mentioned in the parody video ) . 
  we used to do that in early-to-mid november iirc though . 
  it 's december , which means the olive harvesting season has started in southern europe . 
  this is spain , but the italian and greek brothers will find this very familiar . 
  have a happy new olive year !, 
  pretty or not no one can deny it 's so unique and special and worth to preserve . 
  this is the probably one of the most ancient european language right here !, 
  you are just clueless . 
  s\u00ed , [ lo s\u00e9 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/green_spain ) :p, 
  and madrid annual rainfall is not that far from london annual rainfall , actually :p at work atm so ca n't check but iirc it 's something like 700 mm per year in london and around 600 mm in madrid . 
   great britain time weather :p, 
  portugal is going stronk atm . 
  and austria will be . 
  you should become an expert in charts reading and see what we 're talking about here : ** far ** right wing . 
  not centre-right . 
  extremism is objectively a bad thing . 
  the line between right-wing populism and far right is so thin . 
  voting extreme right wing parties is not loving your country and culture at all . 
  far from that . 
  wtf is wrong with you hungary !, 
  yeah here in spain it 's on the frontpage in most sites . 
  that 's such a low rank , you need to get to platinum at least , bro . 
  they 're official numbers by eurostat , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  but really , personal experience and your surroundings ! = the reality . 
  also , no , it 's average . 
  median salary is [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_median_wage ) , which usually is the fair thing to compare ( average is biased by the people that get paid a lot ) . 
  source ( s ) : http://www.ine.es/prensa/np939.pdf, 
  it 's raining ... * too much *, 
  a shitty minimum * salary . 
  the legal minimum salary is still [ far from the average salary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ) . 
  not that i 'm aware of . 
  we also have `` calle mayor '' in almost every single town . 
  to be quite honest , this one is trully common in every town , while plaza de espa\u00f1a is simply extremely common , but probably not in every single town . 
  oh , and `` calle iglesia '' , as well . 
  calle mayor is how traditionally was called the main street of a city , in that particular moment . 
  in madrid we have calle mayor and plaza mayor , which is [ very touristic ] ( https://www.google.com/search?hl=es&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=920&amp;q=plaza+mayor&amp;oq=plaza+mayor&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l10.252.1188.0.1231.11.9.0.1.1.0.136.885.4j5.9.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..2.9.764.hkux8gghod8#hl=es&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=plaza+mayor+madrid ) . 
  in every spanish town , no matter the size . 
  there are probably a lot too in the americas , including united states . 
  here you have [ just a tiny sample ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/plaza_de_espa%c3%b1a ) . 
  well , i meant the imperialistic/expansionistic mind , lol . 
  open a book before you open your mouth . 
  wow . 
  only in america :d, 
   do n't go in the middle of summer , the heat is brutal . 
  can confirm . 
  i 'm used to 35\u00bac + temps in summer in the interior of spain , but mid-july in sevilla literally made me dizzy and had to stop walking several times because i felt like i was going to fall . 
  could n't stand that heat . 
  hello me , it 's you . 
   it 's not that i want to start speaking spanish or anything why not ? 
  i have an open mind , i 'd love to know portuguese . 
  i do n't know why is it bad to know other languages , and more if they 're brother nations . 
  well , i am , too . 
  nobody said we had to keep the crown . 
  yet here you are , celebrating you won the independence * from us * . 
  well , congratulations !, 
  asturias is the only place in the world where anarchy was applied and actually worked . 
  you should read about that , too .
