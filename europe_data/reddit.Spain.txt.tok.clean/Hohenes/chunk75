  i think it was in 1934 . 
  it 's just a joke , you know like i do that we ( as in both , my country and yours ) do n't do that shit anymore . 
  or at least it 's much more restrained ... 
  the salamanca university used to do a yearly poll among portuguese people about a hypothetical iberian unification . 
  polls said more than 40 % of the portuguese were in favor . 
  that 's quite significant to me . 
  on mobile atm , ca n't link . 
  what , then ? 
  you say that most catalans , which also declare themselves to feel spanish according to official polls by the generalitat are wrong ? 
  yup , remember that the castillians invested all their wealth in catalonia 's textile industry , which was competing for being one of the best in europe , together with flandes or northern italy . 
  that shit needed a shit-ton of money for the infraestructure , as it needed a lot of water . 
  the meseta was n't very suitable geographically , but catalonia was . 
  so much wealth invested and generated in return that would have been lost . 
  basically all of spain had their money invested in a single region , for the most part . 
  it 's funny when some independentists say that spain or `` madrid '' is just a leech , when historically we 've been actually fightning to death for catalan interests . 
  when we lost cuba we actually had an economic boom because the catalan bourgeoisie came back and we boomed like hell - they could n't have been in the colonies in the first place if the rulers did n't want to . 
  catalonia is today what it is thanks to spain and spain is today what it is thanks , in part , to catalonia . 
  it 's been a mutual benefit . 
  good . 
  i 'll give the order then . 
  we can start the reunification . 
  felipe vi at least [ speaks portuguese ] ( http://www.rtp.pt/noticias/pais/coracao-do-rei-de-espanha-esta-com-portugal_a966242 ) in your parliament . 
  well , only for those that do n't feel spanish themselves and/or are independentists , 
  or learn to better crush the damn rebels !, 
  aka the date we decided catalonia was more worth than portugal . 
  edit : not trying to be rude , just pointing out the fact that portugal and catalonia rebelled at the same time , and we could n't suffocate both rebellions at once ... so we had to choose . 
  portugal won the independence because the troops had to rush to catalonia . 
  it 's just history . 
  in any case , nationalism today has nothing to do with this : it 's a 19th century thing . 
  this was about fightning shitty rulers ( or rebel against taxation of some kind ) to get better ones . 
   we liked filipe i ( filipe ii of spain ) . 
  yeah , we did as well . 
  looks like you too have experience in preparing walled/enclosed areas suited for vapor and high temperatures , thanks \u00dcber germany \u2665, 
  i mean , at least they 'll speak our language and we will leave a galactic-scale footprint like no one . 
  also , so much silver and gold ruined our economy tens of times , reaching the highest levels of inflation ever recorded . 
  so we will actually lose it because of our own greatness . 
  shit is still cool . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ec6xsj0c6i ) one really gave me hopes for this country . 
  we can do things , yay !,

  next achievement : finding someone from soria !, 
  why is it bad , though ? 
  [ indispensable wiki article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falles ) . 
  spanish people completely ignore portugal , which is sad to me and good for you if you are afraid of annexation or something like that . 
  great , it 's always good if someone 's happy , even if blatantly manipulated . 
  bitch please . 
  it 's either perpi\u00f1\u00e1n or perpiny\u00e0 . 
  reminded me of that scene in the simpsons/family guy where they go watch aerobatics and they are just there for the possibility of seeing a plane crash , and they start going over the edge at every possibility and then having a sudden disappointing moment when they discover the plane is not going to crash . 
   inside lisbons christmas tree omfg you fucking perv people . 
  if you 're happy in that scheme of things ... that 's ... good ? 
  i think it 's * molt b\u00e9 * , but i appreciate your interest in a very spoken spanish language nonetheless . 
  that 's like saying you miss government manipulated media . 
  missing tve or telemadrid would be the same , not even worse , pretty much the same shit . 
  which is absurd considering how decentralized spain is . 
  which does n't mean it could n't be even more . 
  it looks so soviet .

   it 's snowing in fucking spain . 
  we have four seasons in spain .

  corrected link to the infographic : http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/grafico/sociedad/2016/11/25/chuac-diez-transplantes-24-horas/00161480099249741957278.htm and the google translation for this article in spanish : four donors in a coruna , madrid and vigo , one of them a woman who donates in life one chastised her husband have allowed the university hospital complex of a coru\u00f1a ( chuac ) have been carried out ten transplants in less than 24 hours . 
  this happened between tuesday 22 and wednesday 23 november 2016 and that everything went well the participation of more than was necessary 250 professionals who were responsible for the donor organs arrive in conditions to its receptors and they were implemented as provided . 
  this also includes the cleaning staff made sure that any of the five operating rooms used , some of them on more than one occasion , were ready when you need them . 
  five kidneys and two livers , heart and pancreas are still alive in eight people who will have the opportunity to continue living or experiencing a significant improvement in their quality of life thanks to the generosity of the families of the three deceased donors ; it is all an act and generosity of the woman who donated a kidney to her husband , who is the recipient ninth of these transplants . 
  in fact there is at least one more person who will continue to live through this chain of solidarity , since the lungs boy aged 19 died in vigo traveled to madrid to be transplanted to a patient who was in zero urgency . 
  spain is at the bottom or in unfortunate positions in lots of indexes , but hope as at least in regard to transplants , always occupy one of the top spots . 
  and remember that as much as by law everyone is giving default the last word is left to the family of the deceased , who has to authorize the removal of organs . 
  this great and exciting news has inevitably reminded me of the story titled ane carlos and marta macho-stadler in dissections , a book highly recommended . 
  good lord , bohemia . 
  yeah , and some others too , and while we are at it eastern europe could make a 180\u00ba turn and be nice , too . 
  but i mentioned italy and germany because they 're the only two big nations left , france , the uk and spain already did their thing . 
  i find homosexual marriage is also worth mentioning while you 're at it . 
  i mean , for everyone , but you and italy need to align with the rest of western europe , we 're waiting for you < _ <, 
  dude , it 's the third city of the country . 
  20 % here is better than full employment there .

  appointed by a parliament that was previously elected . 
  just like in spain . 
  we do , but we 're all on [meneame.net ] ( http://meneame.net ) , [ forocoches ] ( http://forocoches.com ) , [ el otro lado ] ( http://elotrolado.net ) ... and so on . 
  wonderful . 
  we 've been very open/progressive in the last decades , even fightning the top countries or surpassing them clearly . 
  we might not have a protestant background but we surely can compete and win right now . 
  you uploaded this just so you could make that joke , do n't you ? 
  that 's exactly what freedom of speech is about . 
  if you start forbidding that you 're somewhat legitimazing it , they being able to show victimisation and so on .
