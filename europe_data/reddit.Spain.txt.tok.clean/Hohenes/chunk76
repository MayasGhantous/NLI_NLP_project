  it 's much better to say that you 're entitled to your freedom of speech , but you 're not allowed to hurt , or to discriminate others , or to apply policies that are against human rights or democracy . 
  it 's much more effective , plus much more convenient for the freedom itself ( even if we do n't like it , you should be free to say it , which is not the same that free to do whatever you please ) . 
  remember all the charlie hebdo thing ? 
  they were not fascists , but they surely were/are offensive for many many people . 
  and `` we have been charlie hebdo '' . 
  honestly i 'm not sure if i want us to forbid it , considering that even these mofos should be able to have their freedom of speech . 
  the problem is when they attack someone . 
  they should be put in jail with terrorism charges asap . 
  i mean , the european nations alone are small and little relevant for this world . 
  that 's why we should remain united . 
  the uk alone can and will be eating shit . 
  france would be , too . 
  spain or italy , even more . 
  and let 's not speak of the more little nations that are out of the top 10 or 20 biggest economies . 
  the guy just seems jelous . 
  that thing north-west of galicia is going to fuck us , too . 
  http://i.imgur.com/vgjtuwl.png and the next day ... http://i.imgur.com/jojhrun.png and for the entire week most prob . 
  they have told us that we are top at fightning terrorism , but that wo n't stop me from thinking that we might see another attack not so far down the road : /, 
  i have the fear that this is going to be used as `` fuel '' by those goatfuckers against us to have another 11-m , or very similar . 
  the treaty of lisbon is not `` just another treaty change '' like you are trying to imply with that misleading sentence . 
  the treaty of lisbon was the reaction of the eu institutions towards implementing much of the rejected constitution in the union . 
  this can be downvoted , but it wo n't change . 
  go downvote this wikipedia article : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_lisbon#background, 
  there 's not that kind of generalized hatred in spain/in catalonia . 
  do n't mix things up . 
  lisbon treaty . 
  pretty much this . 
  this is exactly how i was seeing it . 
  i 'm glad i 'm not the only one who thinks this , especially coming from an irish , who surely knows much more than me about the situation . 
  honestly it 's not like our growth comes from industry or something . 
  it 's simply luck : a mix of cheap oil , being lucky at the tourism game and ecb buying all the bonds . 
  it is n't bad , the unemployment figures are bloated ( lots of unregistered jobs ) . 
  wages are lower for the average joe , but the activity is and looks high , not like they told you . 
  this is the reality that i face on a daily basis . 
  it also looks like a big relative improvement for them between the two periods . 
  i 'm also very surprised by austria . 
  more info and source : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/crime_statistics/es, 
  i must say as an already developed country that growing at more than 2.5 % / year feels good . 
  ireland is cheating , though . 
  germany , beligum , our brothers !, 
  [ it 's quite a rough hour , buddy . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q6cvrbk.png ) only the really close to the coastline areas are saved . 
  all of interior areas of andaluc\u00eda are quite close to that temp , sevilla , c\u00f3rdoba or huelva included . 
  the wind or the temp ? 
  the wind : yeah well , we are at 600-700 meters above sea level , but madrid is not a huge windy city , might be the area around my office ( in the north , closer to the mountains ) the temp : not really . 
  it 's almost winter , that temp at that time is quite common in 90 % of spain . 
  cute onion . 
  i do n't even \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  * checks temperature * dude , it 's not snowing , but [ it could actually be ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hxsv25t.png ) . _ . 
  it 's a bit windy so i 'm quite frozen . 
  good thing we 're so warm in the office now xd, 
  for the asturians : it 's blasphemy to compare them . 
  for the rest of the world : it 's just a fucking big san jacobo ( our name for cordon bleu ) . 
  that 's not cachopo . 
  it 's a big san jacobo . 
  well just like spain and portugal are western europe , but us with even more reason ( because geography ) . 
  but i 'd also include italy into w. europe . 
  but again , this is a cultural/political/values thing more than geographical . 
  it is within the 25-35 % range these days . 
  but really , 31\u00bac is the usual temp in central spain when there 's no heatwave ... and it almost feels refreshing compared to what we 've had and what we will surely have before the summer ends . 
  it was 31\u00bac in madrid today and i was so comfy , not sweating . 
  so chilly . 
  yes i 'm serious . 
  we 're on the same matchmaking at least . 
  isolated case , of course it 's safe . 
  we beat them * and * you !, 
  portland ? 
  i had the feeling portland would have irish-compared temperatures ... so 40\u00bac would be impossible in that scale for that place . 
  until now . 
  and navarra . 
  i 'm seeing the hre . 
  let 's be the emperor . 
  and you should n't make up facts refering to the catalan population . 
  what you should be doing is stop spreading bullshit and blatantly lying , again . 
  that was after it was slashed by the constitutional ... which triggered many of the demonstrations later , but before that not even the 11-s was attended by that much ... so you 're confusing the dates here . 
  no one is saying there have n't been big demonstrations , but you said that the statute was supported by a super-majority in catalonia . 
  truth is , most did n't care ... until it was slashed by the constitutional . 
  do you see the difference ? 
  probably should stick it to the truth . 
  he did n't mention any collective , he called him a chauvinist because he does n't agree with that he was saying . 
  so basically it 's ok to call fascist someone because you do n't agree with him/her now ... 
  you 're a fucking idiot if you 're calling fascists an entire nationality . 
  simply as that . 
  it 's not me that came up with an invented number . 
  it 's not me that has to prove you 're lying ... it 's you that have to back up your fake numbers . 
  there was n't a 1.1 million demonstration before 2010 for the statute . 
   oh , and i agree that a demonstration attended by 1.1 million people regarding the statute ? 
  that 's simply false , like most of your discourse . 
  but that 's nothing new . 
  too bad there wo n't be independence because most catalan people is smarter than that . 
  the demonstrations asking to preserve the statute were ridiculous ... 2012 is when it started to change in that regard . 
  you are lying when you say the statute had an overwhelming supoport from the catalans . 
  that 's simply untrue and not stick to reality : the majority of catalans did n't care . 
   these reforms had the overwhelming support both of the catalan population i could n't read more . 
  [ the turnout was 48 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_constitutional_referendum,_2006 ) ... 
  if anything , most catalans just did n't care . 
  damn , eta bringing down their gdp per capita ... 
  suck it , euskadi !, 
  fair enough . 
  i mean if anything we 're basically twin countries .
