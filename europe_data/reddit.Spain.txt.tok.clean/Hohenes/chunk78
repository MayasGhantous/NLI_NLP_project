  pushing the catalan independence agenda is in the other door , not this one . 
  must be sad having a reddit account with the sole purpose of pushing an agenda , but much more sad is feeling the need of adding something that has nothing to do with the topic just to make a political statement absolutely unrelated to the discussion . 
  we know , you want independence , but we 're not talking about that in this thread , so please stay on topic and go away with your political spam bullshit ( which is against the rules of this subreddit btw ), 
  i think you 're exaggerating * a bit too much * . 
  while we build the tallest church we are among the first countries in the world in having full equal marriage for gay people . 
  spain will have the tallest in a few years when the sagrada familia is finished . 
  obvious troll is obvious . 
  spainguy being the fireguy again, 
  this is going to last in here like an lgtbi parade in moscow . 
  yes . 
  exactly . 
  all these posts make this subreddit a ** n ** am ** azi ** ng place to visit daily . 
  if you forbid them then it 's just not worth it to visit it so regularly anymore . 
  they add the fun that we want but the ** mods ** think we do n't deserve . 
  only if spain is in the middle . 
   portesp\u00e9ire but now it sounds/looks french , what the fuck . 
   let the upvote/downvote function decide what 's on the front page . 
  that sounds like a portuguese or a galician asking you to wait for something . 
  this is not ok . 
  we need to murder this one . 
  you 've been banned from / r/spain, 
  being more awesome than you , 
  i think we should bang and have a baby and call it `` spireland '', 
  can i volunteer for the job ? 
  i mean look at those people in southern extremadura or the guadalquivir valley ... ... rip :(, 
  we have much much better things than ice creams . 
  they 're called gazpachos . 
  but also horchata fresquita ( hiii valencia ), 
   uk more like a tiny andalousian town with little to none relevance on this map . 
  and southern france , northern argelia , tiny bit of morocco , andorra ... let 's be practical , this is the * spanish * meteorologic institute . 
  get an umbrella yo !, 
  then barcelona could n't exist when frankfurt achieves bcn 's climate . 
  i 'm sorry but we 're not going to sacrifice barcelona !, 
  i 'm not talking about the dictatorship , but current-day guardias civiles and current-day opinions among some part of the society . 
  there 's nothing wrong being a guardia civil today , they 're not `` opressive forces '' or anything like some people say . 
  i doubt it . 
  madrid has been systematically the biggest * in the world * for a few years now , and this year it was the world pride in madrid , so even more people came this year . 
  6 million people demonstrated in all the country , in their respectives cities/towns . 
  in madrid there was 500k to 1 m , which is a lot but nothing we are not used to see from time to time . 
   - bicycle  - madrid pick one . 
  killing guardias civiles is n't good , either . 
  i say that because some people still think it was/is ok . 
   kingdom of navarre are you from the past ? 
  just protect your coasts from thirsty real estate spectulators and greedy politicians that recalificate/rezone every single protected natural space . 
  and do n't build too close to the coast ... and you 'll be fine . 
  trust me , you need to do it . 
  the mediterranean coast is nothing compared to what it used to be in spain . 
  before it was probably among the most outstanding/paradise places in the world . 
  now it 's just a theme park . 
  well , it 's a pound . 
   non-european money hey , it 's gibraltarian at least ... xd, 
  finnish people are nazguls confirmed . 
  edit : former prime minister of spain or * president of the government * of spain . 
  we do n't have a president , our prime minister is called `` president '' because of the title of `` president of the government '' though . 
  we never use `` primer ministro '' though , it 's only reserved for foreign media and english-speakers . 
  i mean they 're hot . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cantar_de_mio_cid and still a hero today . 
   to this day , el cid remains a spanish popular folk-hero and national icon . 
  numerous plays , films , folktales , songs , and even video games continue to memorialize the traditions of allegiance that his allegories typify . 
  andal\u00fa, 
  cute couple \u2665, 
  [ i mean ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwn5opcfoa0 ) ... and [ madrid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ose6njbmko ) too . 
  i do n't know what 's going in march . 
  we seem to get everything there . 
  to be honest that was an unusual week in terms of temperatures . 
  we were at 42-43\u00bac at the beginning of june , then at 15\u00bac , now at 30\u00bac ( the usual temp for this month ) . 
  crazy month , it 's like a roller coaster . 
   catalonia has been working in creating a `` new country '' for the last years/decades you 're the only one lying here , and you try to depict the idea that everyone follows you with your fake relate . 
  or you really do n't know what 's been happening in the last decades - as you say - where you live . 
  but the truth is different , and you are just going to see it after this new 9-n happens ( and then nothing , because there wo n't be independence ) . 
  want to bet ? 
   ps : i do n't need your help , i 'm well-informed enough , you do n't even know me or where do i live or lived , or where my family and friends do . 
  so do n't try to disguise your political opinion as `` hey , i just want to help ... '' . 
  no , you 're just trying to push your political agenda , period . 
   everything he said is either wrong or lacks information . 
  not really . 
  you just do n't agree with it . 
  he raised some points you do n't even entered and countered with your own arguments . 
  but s/he 's totally right and what s/he talks about is also perceived by many many catalans ( not just non-catalan spaniards ), 
  i can tell you that the rest of spaniards do n't have strong opinions on the issue ... obviously always speaking about my surroundings , but with full knowledge of their political opinions . 
  all in all , the rest of spaniards do n't really care that much , besides the established idea that most think that catalonia is part of spain and we should remain united ( and this goes independent of thinking that they should have the referendum or not btw ), 
  catatonic . 
  because that 's how it 's going to end all this `` prus\u00e9s '' . 
  the fact that a danish is able to see this much better than any of the catalan independentists that populate this subreddit amazes me . 
  but hey , when we - as non-catalan spaniards - tell them this they would call us literally franco . 
  even if i fucking voted a pro-referendum party in the last three elections . 
  naisuuu . 
  i miss the winter . 
   blue tiles have been here since forever , sure , but not the specific type shown in the picture you have n't visited andaluc\u00eda . 
  the gaza strip of spain ? 
  that article is wrong from the beginning . 
  https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/arte_hispano-mu%c3%a7ulmana https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/azulejo#azulejo_mud.c3.a9jar_.28ou_hispano-mourisco.29 you 're welcome . 
  we 're so awesome we need that much space . 
  i just did a valencia-madrid ride at 295 km/h . 
  there really is not a better way of travelling than a high-speed train ... it 's so fast and convenient , you do n't end up tired at all because it 's half the time than car ( plus you do n't have to drive ) . 
  it 's better than plane itself for distances like these . 
  we have one awesome high-speed network with ave. 
  benidorm is such a bitch ... 
  they did , but many returned in 1898 . 
  we could be one of the important engines if we had enough industry .
