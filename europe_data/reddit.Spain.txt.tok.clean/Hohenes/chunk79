  we kind of have the population to do it . 
  we are fine being the 4th biggest economy though and top10 or 12 worldwide . 
  spain is growing faster than any other of the big ones , and one of the fastest among western europe though . 
  you 're welcome here at any time :p, 
  it 's ok for a spanish autonomous community like catalonia . 
  in order to take you seriously you have to be objective . 
  while spain is , in theory , a centralized state , when it comes to practice , the centralized state of spain has ceded so many competences that in practice it almost looks like a federated state . 
  the negative part for those that want decentralization or federalization ( like myself for instance ) is that there 's no `` protection '' of those powers , and the central government could take away the competences at will . 
  which is not something `` about spain '' , it 's just how centralized states work . 
  there 's nothing wrong in acknowledging the reality in order to have a sane debate and being taken seriously . 
  the thing is that spain is the classical centralized state , where the central government cedes competences ( and removes them ) at will , because in the constitution there 's no saying about who manages what ( in terms of what competences have the different `` states '' [ autonomous communities ] and whatnot ) . 
  contrary to constitutions of those countries that are federated where everything is super-detailed about competences . 
  the catch is ... the central power in spain has ceded sooooo many competences that it actually looks like a federal state ... even if it 's not and it 's still a centralized state . 
  that 's why there 's so many contradictory opinions : because spain is a centralized state , in theory , but in practice it is very decentralized . 
  this should n't be something difficult to acknowledge by anyone . 
  do n't hear this one . 
  there 's not a collective , majority hate against catalonia in spain . 
  they 're the minority , just like there are a very minority of catalans that hate the rest of spain . 
  this one is just trying to push the idea that the rest of spain hate the catalans . 
  which is so far from the truth it 's almost delusional . 
  i do n't care if we have to pour billions and billions of euros on this . 
  it should be as important as unemployment at least . 
  we should n't give up on our natural wonders , ever . 
  bernabeu 's location has nothing to do with florentino . 
  it was built many decades ago . 
  florentino was n't even born probably . 
  plus for now the only one ex-president of a spanish football club is [ the ex-president of fc barcelona , sandro rosell ] ( http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/deportes/sandro-rosell-asi-vida-prision-soto-del-real-6124087 ) . 
  disclaimer : i do n't like football , but the fact that you came with something that has nothing to do with what 's being discussed here ... 
  i just had to , 
  you can see the bernab\u00e9u in the right . 
  also , [ windsor tower is missing because of the fire that destroyed it in 2005 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/windsor_tower_\\ ( madrid \\ ) ) . 
  i can only wish a lot of pain for the rest of their lifes to those who provoked this fire intentionally . 
  strong , unberable , agonizing pain . 
  noisy comment lmao . 
  i thought it was clash royale the most profitable one . 
  i 'm so hooked to that game ... 
  i feel guilty when i say i spent a couple hundred $ over a year in that thing . 
  i do n't think they imply that a terrorist would plan to use them ... it 's more in the case of a non-predemitated , impulsive attack . 
  as others have pointed out . 
  plus people do n't need special measures to put weapons or defensive measures in bars to protect themselves ... you do n't usually put weapons everywhere `` just in case '' someone has to defend itself . 
  quite the contrary , in the us they have this problem with fireguns ... we do n't need to import that . 
   suck it , europe no , suck it * you * - because you 're europe too !, 
  i 'm not going to grab a knife from a bar to defend myself against a guy with an ak ... 
  i 'm just going to run away or hide if i ca n't . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  do i have to remember that i was answering a false statement about how spain `` does n't have any big industry to replace tourism '' ? 
  the fact that there are other industries bigger than tourism in the spanish economy is what i was pointing out ... not that we would be ok losing the tourism industry . 
  i answered someone that said that spain does n't have any big industry to replace tourism ... that 's a false statement : tourism is n't even the biggest industry in spain . 
  while an important one , spain would survive as a highly developed economy without it because it 's not the only engine that fuels the spanish economy ... 
  it would be extremely stupid to think that a 47 million advanced economy survives only because of cheap tourism from other advanced countries . 
  it is simply not true , otherwise we would n't be among the advanced economies or even among the oecd club . 
  tourism in spain represents around 8-10 % of our economy . 
  the car industry alone is more important than the tourist industry . 
  you do n't maintain a developed , oecd country with 47 million with the pitty tips of retired british and germans , despite what a reader of the sun might tell you . 
   i 've downloaded a 500mb map today without even blinking an eye . 
  [ europeism intesifies ], 
  i think most spanish would find it funny lol, 
  `` kazimierz '' always makes me giggle because it sounds like `` casi mierda '' in spanish ... aka `` almost shit '' . 
  but this is not casi mierda ... this is beautifully outstanding !, 
  turkish oil wrestling is the most homoerotic thing two straight male turkish peeps can do together . 
  it can be hot af depending on the attractiveness of the individuals ( which is n't hard if you 're into masculine hairy men ), 
  no crash finally , we 're safe :d, 
  in case you wonder ... no , the canadair planes used by spain or france do n't have emergency ejection system ... so the pilot is probably dead ( i really hope not though ) . 
  this afternoon/night we are going to have massive dry storms in most of the interior of spain after days of having +40 \u00bac temps and low humidity ... ... wish us luck pls . 
  i did n't know we had an extinct volcano there . 
  i knew that the most northeastern part of spain was quite seismically active though ( esp . 
  nearing the pirineos in girona and huesca ) , together with the southeasternmost part . 
  as someone that likes dark comedy ... it 's not even funny . 
  is that so he 's on the photos asap ? 
  i hope it 's not because of that ... . 
   but our poor hermanos of central castile do not really have it easy oh , trust me , [ i 'm fine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eno0jxxejts ) . 
  it does when you are near a swimming pool , a lake , a river , or the beach . 
   my car read 46\u00ba in santar\u00e9m , i sarted driving and it went down to 42\u00ba phew , that must have felt refreshing . 
  [ the same place , three years ago ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idjyusdugsc ) . 
  i remember , that one was a huge ass fire ... 
  i 've read most of the killed (  30 ) were caught by the flames in the road , while in their vehicles and trying to escape ... what a way to go . 
  edit : had to look for the source again ,  30 mortos dentro de viaturas  trinta dos 57 mortos nos inc\u00eandios de leiria morreram dentro das suas viaturas . 
  from publico.pt, 
  for now . 
  [ this is a very foresty area ] ( https://www.google.es/maps/@39.9261092,-8.1619318,3a,75y,245.61h,84.46t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ssygdq-6hhrpikqejulkajw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) , together with the high temps lately and lack of precipitation it 's not very unusual ... but the number of killed is absolutely off the charts ... looks like [ the end \\ ( or beginning \\ ) part of sistema central ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/sistema_central ) . 
  only 2 ? 
  surely we can do more to help : /, 
  this is a catastrophe , our hearts are with you portugal . 
   edit : it 's 4:15 now and it just dropped below 30 . 
  turn on that central heating omfg you gon na freeze !, 
  these are our minimum temperatures these days . 
  but they just tried to say it in the first language used in barcelona . 
  which is not catalan by the way . 
   that 's why in portugal the term `` iberian '' is not so liked anyway ... that 's far from the truth . 
  you or your immediate sorroundings might not like it , but it 's not absolutely the truth at all . 
  you sound like you 're accusing spain of appropiating the peninsula in a. . . weather forecast . 
  and then you try to reinforce it using an airline 's corporates name . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  `` pen\u00ednsula '' is just the way you shorten it up in ... a fucking weather forecast about spain ? 
  well , you just said you lived through 20 years in those conditions ... 
  i think you would be dead if you did n't get used to it . 
  they 're islands considering how isolated they are from morocco . 
  that awesome continental climate . 
  get mediterranean ( like california for instance ) . 
  yeeep .
