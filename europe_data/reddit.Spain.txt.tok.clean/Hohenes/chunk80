  `` espa\u00f1a peninsular '' as opposed to espa\u00f1a insular ( baleares , canarias , ceuta , melilla et al ), 
  high temperatures were never the problem . 
  the problem is actually torrential rains and similar extreme weather events caused by the increasing global warming issues ... spain 's high temperatures during the summer was never the problem nor the cause of desertification . 
  also spain , while at risk , is not a desert , nor has important deserts at all . 
  do n't try to depict an image of spain that we simply do n't have . 
  i hate/don ' t like football :p, 
  absolutely not , it 's just an hypothetical scenario . 
  just a little comment , we never say `` bar\u00e7a '' to refer to the city . 
  we call it barcelona or barna ( or bcn in its written , shorter form ) . 
  but never `` bar\u00e7a '' . 
  that 's only for the football club . 
  yep . 
  but the day the gulf stream is gone ... this is going to be worse than ny because we have a continentalised climate . 
  for me it 's -15 \u00bac when i 'm in the sierra de madrid , where i go from time to time . 
  for the city of madrid itself -5 \u00bac / -10 \u00bac would be `` crazy low '' . 
  remember that we react like you do when we hear ... `` omg it 's over 25\u00bac and i 'm melting ! '' . 
  25\u00bac is a good , comfortable temperature , not a melting one for us . 
  that 's correct . 
  when you have wind with 40\u00bac you wish you did n't have wind .

  we were so rich and had so much gold and rich minerals over the centuries that we have gone bankrupt 14 + times , being the first modern country in doing so , most of them due to the inflation caused by the excess of rich minerals that made our currency worthless ( when you have too much gold/wealth , it just loses its value ) . 
  and then we killed ourselves over and over again , so we had to ` hide ' the good stuff from ourselves ... just to not see it ever again . 
  spain is a sad story . 
  [ i do n't know what gold are you talking about . 
  ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gold-reserves-per-capita-europe.jpg ) we do n't have it . 
  [ ask moscow ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_gold ) and switzerland what happened . 
  i 'm madrid send help plx . 
  so just like us . 
  we try to be inside during the central hours in the day , we have ac everywhere and if we go out during the burning hours it 's because we are going to the beach or the swimming pool for us in the interior . 
  but even so , if you stay out as long as you 're someone that has lived these temps many summers you are probably ok - except if you do exercise or something . 
  do n't do exercise with 40\u00bac , you are risking your life . 
  no chance . 
  we removed couscous long time ago . 
  i 've seen snow in march in barcelona . 
  and in madrid during april . 
  it 's not super common but it can just happen naturally . 
  and we get crazy low temperatures during winter and heavy snowfall even in low areas as well . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.aemet.es/documentos_d/enportada/20170615104641_p52tesp1.pdf ) the special notice that the aemet ( spanish state meteorology agency ) has issued for this high temp event . 
  we are simply used to it . 
  this is how it works . 
  how do you deal with -30 \u00bac nights during winters ? 
  you just get used to it . 
  there are blond hair people in the south , and with crystal clear eyes . 
  it just happens that brown hair and brown eyes are more common . 
  6,5 / 10 ... for the effort . 
   also today was a very hot day . 
  * checks paris weather * . 
  - max temp : 31\u00ba - current temp : 26\u00ba back to madrid ... - * current * temp : 34\u00ba \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  being catalan means whatever a catalan wants it to be ... if a catalan feels spanish for the only reason of being catalan , which is part of the spanish culture and peoples , then that 's exactly what a catalan is . 
  being catalan is not what you want it to be , you can feel spanish as catalan and participate in the collective notion of nation that spain represents , without harming or moving away a single `` catalanity '' out of his/her identity . 
  so no , a catalan is not whatever random shit you say in order to accomodate it to your own political ideology . 
  feelings are stronger , and most catalans feel spanish to some degree according to polls . 
   men sitting with their legs open , not so much , especially since many ca n't help it . 
  it is a problem when a number of people label it as a problem even if you do n't consider it one or do n't recognize it . 
  they use the day of all the catalans ( independentists or not ) as a platform for their ideology , stealing the day of the catalans for a their shitty political agenda . 
  it 's also the only way to boost independentism , because the optimism about the possibility of trully being independent is coming to an end ( not like that possibility exists or existed before , though ), 
  til you ca n't fix multiple things at the same time , and you ca n't talk of anything else than the number one priority of a particular place . 
   from the 90s with dance/eurodance * influence * they definitely used shitty dance/techno vibes for their tunes . 
   do not visit it during summer like i did i did years ago in mid july ... and i fell down due to the weather for the first and only time ever . 
  [ dude ] ( http://www.clublatino.org.nz/greenspain.gif ) . 
  at work . 
  at home . 
  in the car . 
  during siesta . 
  * especially * during siesta . 
  from the 90s with dance/eurodance influence i think we should mention [ camela ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpa5n3eo-rq ) ... jajajaja a bit embarrassing though . 
  yup . 
  those temps are actually usual in madrid ** during heatwaves ** . 
  and there 's one starting to affect all of spain right now , especially the inner iirc . 
  last year we reached 40\u00bac in a single strangely hot day in the somewhere middle of * may * . 
  the rest of the week was hot ( 33-35\u00ba ) , but that day was especially hot . 
  although our 38\u00bac are coupled with a relatively low air humidity ... so there 's that . 
  it 's not like it 's barcelona 's humidity + 38\u00bac ... that would be fuuucking insane . 
  our 38\u00bac + low humidity is like your 27\u00bac + high humidity . 
  i 've never looked down upon the uk , even if i had reasons to . 
  like no giving a fuck about the second spanish republic when we were being fucked up by fascism . 
  but even then , france left us with franco as well , so it 's not like it was a only-british thing . 
  i guess that democracies in the 30s were as hypocritical as they are today . 
  it 's ok to be in denial . 
  it 's even ok to be unable to maintain a mature conversation - at least in the sense that you can carry on with your life - but it 's not ok to be as ignorant as an amoeba and pretend that others try and fall for such an effortless bait  because you are from a third-world country . 
  i bet most do n't , plus some that are like that are usually the most vocal ones , so my perception might be a bit biased due to this . 
  fite me [ irl ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/torrespana-tower-madrid.jpg ), 
  you would expect to have a decent military with [ that spending ] ( http://fromtone.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/j6xp2rh.png ) ( just try to find spain and check how much we spend compared to you ) . 
  and even then , i would n't say the uk could beat france or germany or even japan . 
  this is not the eighties , and they 're not argentina , mate . 
  i 'm getting ready to get myself on a cool swimming pool for the next 48/72 hours . 
  * oh hello there , melanoma . 
   autumn now with even more 30c + temps !, 
  that one is retarded , not even worth a reply . 
  the uk lost its relevance as well . 
  it 's just that some people do n't seem to accept it , yet . 
  spain accepted its fate right after 1898 happened . 
  but some in the uk are still in denial about their own global ( or even regional now with brexit ) irrelevance . 
  until the 21st of june : yes , spring . 
  it 's funny considering the biggest issue was ... the weather . 
  we never thought the british were classy . 
  it 's been a pirate nation since the 16th century . 
  we 've been enemies . 
  there 's [ century-old propaganda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_legend ) for a reason ( and it has influence even today in the anglosaxon culture/peoples as well ) . 
  even today in this subreddit many british disregard spain and they look down upon us .
