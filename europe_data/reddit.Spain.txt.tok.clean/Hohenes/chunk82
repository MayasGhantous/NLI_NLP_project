  gib unification . 
  only 1-3 times per winter , in the last 10-20 years . 
  but it used to be quite more than that . 
  we have many icing nights between dec-jan though . 
  spain both * has * eurofighers ( around 60 + ) and produce them . 
  so same temp than madrid these days . 
  i was having a nice swimming pool day yesterday . 
  my face has burnt a bit . 
  spanish gdp is much higher though . 
  it says the same about italy or greece than france , belgium or the czech republic ... the difference is negligible . 
  also spain has gone through some serious terrorism shit , and we have many policial bodies for different dutties ( guardia civil , polic\u00eda nacional , polic\u00eda local , polic\u00edas auton\u00f3micas like ertzaintza , mossos ... 
  etc. ), 
  i do n't think you know guardia civil at all . 
  and no , you do n't need to be a right winger to disagree with you ... just not an ignorant . 
  they look like they 're everywhere because they have the duty of patrolling and controlling the roads : safety , speeding , drunk people on the road , lots of controls against drugs ... etc. 
  if you were being chased by gc is because you probably were speeding way too much ? 
  they do n't just chase for anything . 
   no you do n't , or else you would 've included them in your initial statement dude , i just put some examples of different regions in spain ... there are many more : murcians , canarians , madrilenians , cantabrians , asturians ... . . also we have 800k romanians in spain , and we have no problems with them , 
  i 've never justified 13tv for doing that ... 
  i only said that they have low audience and you people were giving free advertising to those undesirables . 
  you are simply clueless and do n't know what justify something means . 
  you 're probably just too young . 
  the fact that the basques speak a different language does n't change my notion of spain and the spaniards . 
  i think basques in spain are just as spaniards as any other in the country . 
  where did i oppose ? 
  i always said that in order to hold a referendum first we should change the constitution ... dude , i vote a political party that is ** in favor ** of a referendum in catalonia and i do n't even criticize them for that . 
  i think you have a few prejudices against me but you do n't really know me well . 
  not sure if it 's because of my flag or what . 
  i do n't impose anything , our constitution voted by the catalans themselves with over 75 + % support says that the nation is not divisible ... well then change that in first place right ? 
  or are we just ignoring the democratic constitution just to please you ? 
  portuguese people are my brothers , we are not in the same political entity so i ca n't say they 're spanish , but they 're indeed iberians and very similar to us . 
  i feel the catalan culture and language as part of spain just like the galician , castillian , andalousian or extremaduran ... how hard is this to understand ? 
  why is it ok to respect catalan independentism but not a spaniard that think catalonia is part of his/her country ? 
   the whole point is that girona wants to take part into this idea called `` catalonia '' . 
  but this is not how the idea of nation works . 
  imagine if the inhabitants of morocco wanted to be part of spain ... but that wo n't make any sense for many spaniards , the spaniards wo n't find morocco as part of their country ... because morocco is not part of the idea of the nation of spain . 
  but catalonia is . 
  and girona too ( both part of catalonia and spain ) . 
  and it 's not possessive that you think girona is part of catalonia ... is just how you feel ... 
  i do n't know why would you try to hide what you actually feel just to try to win an argument . 
  and i was n't being hostile , but it 's bullshit when you suggest indirectly or refer to 47 million people as possessive . 
  let 's try to guess you 're from barcelona ... and your idea of catalonia i guess is what the autonomous community is today ( but independent ) . 
  i do n't know if you include the rousillon , l'alghero , valencian comunity and the balears in the idea of `` catalonia '' , but let 's assume you just include the current-day catalonia in your idea of `` catalonia '' . 
  then you might think girona is part of catalonia ... is n't that submissive and possessive though ? 
  you 're from barcelona ( i was guessing , remember ? ) . 
  but ... wait , you do n't mean you want to possess girona ... your idea of catalonia just includes girona , but you 're not an opressive machine that want to subjugate others ... it 's just your national idea of your land . 
  well in spain most people ( and in catalonia millions of catalans as well ) include catalonia as part of spain ... because they feel just the same as you feel towards girona . 
  so quit the bullshit , thank you . 
  most catalans themselves do n't agree with this , so do n't get fooled by / u/raicopk , / r/europe, 
   im not trying to convince an australopitecus like you . . theeeeere you are . 
  that 's the real fascist in you . 
  so glad to greet the real you , finally !, 
  in contrast to you , i do actually have a bit more respect for other people ( even people like yourself ) , so i will abstain from playing your game . 
  have a great day , compatriot !, 
  this is n't a spanish-only thing tho . 
  not at all . 
   the 8th channel most seen in spain isnt relevant . 
  as you have said , there are much more variety now , which makes the audience to widespread much more ... so the 8th most seen channel has a lower audience than you 'd expect . 
  a 2 % is literally an irrelevant amount . 
  you can try harder ( doubt you can ) but you wo n't convince anyone . 
  this one is open , not pay-to-view like most of those `` hundreds '' . 
  it is normal . 
  and no , a 2 % share on average is not relevant no matter how hard you try . 
  do you even know what an exaggeration is ? 
  if you think a 2 % audience is relevant then the problem is yours . 
  that 's not the kind of things i was refering to ... that was actually racist and it was controversial within spain as well . 
  i think it was the basketball national team ? 
  i do n't remember . 
  good read [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanians_in_spain ) about it . 
   romanians in spain form the largest group of foreigners in the country , having surpassed moroccans in 2007 . 
  [ 1 ] as of 2014 , they made up 15.6 % of spain 's total foreign population of 4,676,022 people . 
  [ 2 ] most of the immigration is for economic reasons , as many romanians from rural and underdeveloped areas are attracted by the higher wages of spain , the linguistic similarities between romanian and spanish, 
   i also consider french keyboards shocking . 
  have you considered using one with protected , covered wire instead of bare wire ? 
  in spain , with the influx of romanians , bulgarians and polish during the ` good ' years prior to the crisis there was also a growing feeling `` against '' eastern europeans . 
  it 's not like it was against , but they were seen as poorer and usually more involved in crime ( this being the xenophobic touch probably ) . 
  today that image stands still ... but there are not as many eastern europeans contrary to , for example , south americans , which are the target of such thinking nowadays . 
  also in spain there 's no psychosis/fear about having the possibility of being labeled as ` racist ' , ( for example we use ethnic features to name/describe someone with no bad intention ) so people usually are much more open and vocal about all this stuff . 
  ... and its audience is composed of a 0,01 % of the total viewers . 
  stop giving more free advertising to them . 
  only if a majority is for it . 
  otherwise it 's undemocratic to change the law against the will of the majority of the spanish people , which is inclusive to the catalans , as they actually voted massively for this democratic constitution , by the way . 
  so no , things are not undemocratic just because you think something is wrong or right . 
  a constitution that does n't allow a part of its territory to break away can and is perfectly democratic ... just like the german or italian ones , which work very similarly . 
  the democratic way would be try to change that in first place , then a referendum about independence can be hold . 
  yet you could n't support your claims based on prejudices as demonstrated by your sequence or list of bad things pp has done according to you in the last decade , though . 
  but that was n't what we were talking about . 
  your claim remains empty , and it obviously could n't be discussed because you preferred to make shit up . 
  goodbye . 
  oh , a bunch of links that have literally nothing to do with `` the pp not being content with catalonia 's parliament '' . 
  just tell me when you are ready to back this claim :  pp is ( not ) content about the status of catalonia 's parliament and until then , if you do n't have ** literally anything ** , stop bothering me , \u00bf vale ? 
   pp is ( not ) content about the status of catalonia 's parliament this is your claim . 
  now what are you using in order to support such a laughable claim ? 
  you 're just making shit up based on prejudices . 
  i 'm telling you you do n't need to make shit up in order to bash pp ... they bash themselves with their shitty political actions and ideas . 
  but you 're simply straight up lying in order to gain some points or due to your hate towards a specific political spectrum . 
  period . 
  the only one that needs to check his head here is you , not me . 
  you only seem to make false claims and then link to things that have nothing to do with the government actions . 
  you should probably check your own prejudices , besides your head instead of telling me to check mine .
