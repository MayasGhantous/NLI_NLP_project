  and when you finish , try to post a link where `` the current government is not content with catalonia 's parliament '' , kthx . 
  of course i say it 's not as bad as you try to portray it . 
  pp has done some bullshit with the education system , and you can hear wert talking about the catalan system , but that does n't change anything that has done or that they 're trying to do . 
  if you want a mature discussion about this , i recommend you not to distort the reality ( i.e. 
  `` pp is not content with catalonia 's parliament '' ) . 
  they literally are the statu quo ( together with psoe ) , with a few reactionary members in there . 
  but we 're talking about the government actions , not their ideologies . 
  you 're saying [ decretos de nueva planta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nueva_planta_decrees ) was the result of conquest ... you 're delusional . 
  that was a centralization process after the spanish succession war ... not the `` first catalan independence war that ended up with the capitulation and bombardment of barcelona in 1714 '' or some fucking crazy stupid shit like that . 
  learn history so we can discuss , because you ca n't pretend to have a political discussion when you 're fantasizing or just ignore the history . 
  you said that the ruling party is angry because catalonia has its own parliament . 
  this is just pure bullshit , no matter how hard you try to troll more and how unfitting this is for your own mind and/or how you have arranged your political bullshit in your head ( and i 'm a republican , left-wing , podemos voter myself ), 
  catalonia was part of the crown of aragon ... which was ** never ** conquered by the kingdom of castille , but rather inherited . 
  there were no catalan nationalism back then ... because there were no nationalism at all , which is only 200 years old . 
  after the personal union with castille , aragon and its dependencies ( incl . 
  the catalans ) kept their institutions and laws , but in the 1700s the aragonese law was abolished by decreto de nueva planta . 
  this is not a right of conquest ... it was a centralizing movement like every other in the rest of europe by that time . 
  ** catalonia was never * conquered * by castille , you should probably open a book someday instead of just believing in fantasy **, 
  you called him an ignorant and `` that you know shit '' , but i 'm the insulting one and you 're the paradign of the good catalan that knows good about how evil and harmful are those spaniards . 
  this one is a good one , guys , lmfao . 
  of course it means something : that there 's a clear half and half situation in catalonia , and independence is absolutely not something that easy to achieve when you have over half your population against it ( or not clearly pro-independence , if you prefer ) . 
  oh , and that does n't mean 48 % of ** those that voted ** ( which is not even 48 % of the catalans ) think that spain opress them or steal them . 
  which is what i was talking about replying / u/gautedasuta claims , and it 's non sense . 
  defending that catalonia is a colony is one way to ridiculize yourself and disregard your opinion entirely . 
  like that one guy from institut nova historia , v\u00edctor cucurull, 
  except most catalans do n't feel that way ... this is purely invented by the most hardcore separatists that claim spain is stealing or opressing them today . 
  and some of them can be found here trying to push their agenda , too . 
   get angry at the fact that catalonia `` has its own parliament , laws , and education system '' vs  this comes from the current ruling party . 
  stop lying . 
  some people in spain get angry for many things ... that does n't mean it 's the general opinion of a country . 
  even pp ** officially ** is not trying to change how things work in that regard . 
  only ciudadanos want to recentrlize the most . 
  there should n't be ... except it 's not allowed by the constitution . 
  the democratic thing is trying to change this before doing it ... but they do n't want ( because they would lose it probably ) . 
  you 're saying that the most democratic way to do things is breaking the current democratic law . 
  well ... . it is n't . 
  the fuck are you talking about ? 
  the spanish civil war happened because the coup failed in more than half the country , which opposed and fought to maintain the democratic regime ( although with many problems , it was still a democratic regime ) . 
  madrid , valencia , barcelona ... they all resisted and fought till the end . 
  you 're just a shitty troll . 
   declaration on the granting of independence to ** colonial ** countries and peoples you should probably [ do a bit more research ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-determination#self-determination_versus_territorial_integrity ) , and should understand that catalonia has not been nor is a colony , and they have self government , which is exactly what the self-determination right is about : seeking self-government , not `` independence from another country '' . 
  so , again , no ... there 's no such right because catalonia is already free and has a self-government with its own protected culture and language . 
  there are so many delusional people among the separatist movement . 
  but it 's not something new : it 's always been like that . 
   the coup failed in catalonia ** and worked everywhere else ** if you do n't have a fucking clue then simply shut the fuck up . 
  which does n't seem fair . 
  we should all have the same system , not different ones in each state/autonomy/call it x. . . 
  either we all have the same ( fully federal ) or there wo n't be the same rights and opportunities for all the peoples . 
  but breaking the country apart is not a way to solve it . 
  i 'm a republican too m8 . 
   would catalans respond in some armed way if they see their region being controlled from madrid ? 
  no that wo n't happen but we would see ( probably ) massive demonstrations . 
   spanish oppression there 's no such a thing today . 
  except all catalans do have spanish and more than half of them embrace the spanish culture as theirs , and they include their catalan identity among the spanish , just like many galicians and basques do . 
  no , there 's no such right . 
  well thank you . 
  are you aware the whole spain was opressed during the francoist regime ? 
  it was n't a spain vs catalonia kind of dictatorship , you know ? 
  but more like half of spain vs the other half ( and other minorities ) . 
  did you even know franco was galician and not a random `` castillian '' idiot ? 
  stop buying bullshit from one side and maybe try to look the whole picture before building your own opinion . 
  where is he or she lying exactly ? 
  catalonia enjoys a democracy today , with its own parliament , laws and education system where catalan is the main vehicular language and it 's protected and encouraged over spanish . 
  yes , you separatists act like spoiled children and present yourselves as victims when politically confronted and do n't want to hear this . 
   sounds like a surefire way to become a sort-of pariah state in europe not even that . 
  screaming `` we 're independent now ! '', 
  from the balcony of the generalitat , like it was done before , wo n't make them a new state . 
  it needs to be effective for that ... and it wo n't . 
  an arranged referendum between the central government and the regional gov may or may not happen in the future , but you can be certain that independence wo n't happen .

  there are many french and spanish people under 25 that ca n't speak english . 
  and i know what i 'm talking about . 
  last time i checked , both france and spain were part of western europe ( both politically/culturally and geographically ), 
  not sure if sarcasm or totally serious ... ( and hence , wrong ), 
  literally all countries are artificial entities . 
   pride parades do n't care for lgbt sufferings in other countries . 
  i do n't think you understand what a gay parade is , you just seem to ventilate your hate for lgtb associations and other ways to try to arise visibility of the sexual diversity whenever you see the chance ( just [ another example ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6aay2j/russian_lgbt_network_steps_up_efforts_to_get_gay/dhddlse/?context=3 ) ) . 
   nobody here has managed to explain to me why this is a reasonable event that actually helps the lgbt community . 
  no , it 's you that did n't actually understand a single thing , i can only conclude you 're a poor troll with some sort of obsession with gay people . 
  i 've already told you if you did n't understand this basic point of heterosexual people not being persecuted contrary to homosexual people then it makes no sense for anyone to be discussing this with you any further . 
  we will carry on without you until the days were parades are not needed , do n't worry . 
  even in a ex-sovietic country like estonia . 
  in a world where you are still being killed or persecuted by your sexual orientation these demonstrations do make sense . 
  it 's like you saying why would people donate for people starving ... if there are no people starving in brussels . 
  maybe if their sexual orientation was just accepted and , more importantly , was part of the regular lifes of everybody just like heterosexuality is then these would disappear . 
  i can only conclude you do n't really understand why they do exist , i only see you having a sort of hate for other people to celebrate that they are being recognized after centuries of witch hunting . 
  next time if you hate other people demonstrating their love in the streets try not to opress them for loving the `` wrong '' person and maybe you wo n't find them in the streets asking not to kill them . 
  that 's what `` pride '' is about , not having to hide yourself . 
  yes , it totally has : heterosexual people do n't need to fight for their rights to be respected as heterosexual people ... that 's why there are not demonstrations for heterosexuality but there is , instead , a whole world of things that come naturally , because it 's what it is implanted culturally , socially ... 
  if you do n't understand this basic point then i do n't see why would i waste my time trying to discuss it further with you . 
  where ? 
  i can only see the comment of one entitled redditor . 
  maybe because people have not been killed , persecuted and abused for being heterosexual for centuries ? 
  i dunno , maybe that has something to do ... 
  well that 's exactly what some of you are doing on this subreddit after all . 
  like if you did n't have anything else to do or say here but trying to push your shitty agenda . 
  there should be democracy ... that 's why the democratic constitution of spain should be respected , not outlawed unilaterally and hold an illegal referendum . 
  maybe follow the legal procedure and try to change the constitution first ? 
  it 's not hard : this is how democracy works . 
  i guess it 's a mix of things : while i think it 's important to fight for visibility in a heterosexual-centric society , i do n't feel i need to do it myself , considering i live in a tolerant country with full rights , gladfully .
