  more info , in spanish : http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/espana/2015/08/13/bobbies-britanicos-calmar-hordas-turistas-magaluf/00031439481274371367819.htm oddly enough i ca n't get to make google translate work with that article . 
  it gets stuck loading forever . 
  drunks, 
  some of them look a bit forced and not that exceptional to be honest . 
  fine , yes , but that 's not the `` most common '' :p, 
  honestly more than a curse word it 's a direct insult lol . 
  the most common curse words are joder , mierda , co\u00f1o , puta ... for example . 
  that 's also gypsy curse here but it 's also said overall . 
  i shit on all your dead relatives . 
  this is a reposted old article . 
   i had to push them to a side and i hate to start my day pushing people violently to a side . 
  lol, 
  same in spanish with -  arroba . 
  i love how reddit allows everyone to be an expert in whatever they choose . 
  i mean it 's not a competition ... it 's just terrible as you pointed out so yes i agree . 
  nope we do n't think the world is against us , but we think that everyone in the world is better than us and other people ca n't do it worse . 
  far from reality , obviously . 
  we would n't be a rich , developed , western country if that was true . 
  but it 's in our dna to bash ourselves . 
  i was using [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terrorism_in_the_european_union ) as source . 
  yeah the theory there was that the king prepared it as to gain legitimacy by facing the ( fake ) coup if i 'm not mistaken . 
  ** spain ** [ teor\u00eda de la conspiraci\u00f3n del 11m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/controversies_about_the_2004_madrid_train_bombings ) , known outside of spain as 2004 madrid train bombings , which was and still is the worst terrorist attack in europe . 
  officially it was an al-qaeda cell , but some from pp and el mundo newspaper were throwing garbage information about the authors of the attack , saying it was eta , and even some conspirationists of the right wing and extreme right wing suggested it was psoe + cni ( spanish cia ) + morocco in colaboration . 
  crazy stuff . 
  ok , ok , do n't you worry . 
  here 's another comment where you can press the downvote button as to not drown in your own bile . 
  but that 's the only thing britain can do to stop spain patrolling their own waters , lol . 
  gibraltar has no sovereignty over spanish waters . 
  try to make us stop from patrolling our own waters . 
  oh wait : you ca n't . 
  like you could n't the hundred times gibraltar yelled about this before . 
  stop making me laugh you little rosbif . 
  hah , you wish . 
  first : ceuta was roman , not carthaginian , its name comes from * septem fratres * ( seven hills ) . 
  after that it was even `` recovered '' by the byzantines . 
  second : when rome fell , you probably know that were the germanic tribes that took over the political control of the western side of the empire , and ceuta was one of those places , as it was taken by the vandals ( from the romans , not moroccans ) , same people that settled in the peninsula and founded the later north christian kingdoms of hispania . 
  third : in the 8th century there was a moor invasion of the peninsula , and one of the first places to fall was ... ceuta !, 
  in the 709 , by the omeya caliphate . 
  and not like it matters but ceut\u00edes are mostly ethnically spanish , contrary to the gibraltarians that are not ethnically british but andaluisians . 
  yes , it does n't matter , i agree with you that it 's the people that decide what they want to be . 
  but do n't bring absolutely fake arguments like `` if they want gibraltar back , they need to give ceuta and melilla back to the moroccans '' because 1st . 
  ceuta was n't taken from morocco in the 1700 , and 2nd . 
  it 's 0 % moroccan whereas gibraltar was spanish 300 years ago and are still culturally attached to spain . 
  two very different cases . 
  i 'm proud of the accomplishments and achievements , as you say , that leaded to have this tolerant and open society that we have today in spain and portugal , both so-called `` super catholic countries '' that have now equality in their law for gay people before most other western countries . 
  that 's what i 'm proud about . 
  it 's not a flag or supremacist-thing proud though , at all . 
   if spain want it back they should first give back ceuta and melilla to the moroccans to get back something you must first have owned it . 
  this one sentence here only speaks for your lack of knowledge in this matter , since ceuta and melilla were never moroccan . 
  if anything ceuta should be given back to the portuguese , but you probably did n't know that either . 
  and by the way , gibraltarians are ethnically andalusians : even their accent is strong in that regard . 
  their nationalism comes from the idiotic franco that closed the border in the 60s , and that really fucked up things . 
  they developed an anti-spanish sentiment and that 's exactly what brings them far from want to come back . 
  that and the shitty tax heaven thing , obviously ... 
  it 's a similar sentiment that nordics have with , you know , being part of the nordic countries . 
  except that i do n't assume the rest of the countries are crap . 
  there 's this accepted mantra that everything is top notch and the rest of the countries are shit . 
  then you realize that 's partially fake , in the sense that there are more nice places and can be top too , like in the iberian nations ( no it 's not about the peninsula thing , that was bad sarcasm from your part i bet ) , and i think being proud of the accomplishments that this society has achieved coming from two bloody extreme right dictatorship attached to the catholic church etc. 
  just about ~ 40 years ago and looking how far we have come restores my faith in humanity and makes me happy being part of that . 
  i do n't understand why you have to be such sarcastic though , it 's like you say there 's no reason to be happy : i think there are more things to be happy about than shitty things . 
  it 's easier to say blah blah corruption blah blah you 're broke if what you want is trigger a laugh of someone else and win internet points . 
  hell yes !!, 
  this is why i love iberia , it 's so nice in here in so many levels . 
  i 'm more aware of the situation in this side of `` a raia '' but knowing in portugal it 's the same makes me happier and more proud being both iberian and gay . 
  gibraltar has no waters beyond its port . 
  that 's spanish waters according to the treaty and the european court . 
  it 's so exhausting having this summer after summer . 
  yes , bottom is the opposite to top lol, 
  so are you saying [ this ] ( http://struxtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/italy-279x300.gif ) is the `` bottom of the part of italy that is in continental europe '' ( that 's what he said ) ? 
  that looks north-central continental italy to me ... 
  i mean since when florence is south italy ? 
   europe is just that same foreign land beyond spain ... wut, 
  but san marino is still not at the bottom of continental italy ? 
  huh, 
   san marino is on the bottom of the part of italy that is in continental europe . 
  do you mean the southern part of the boot is not part of continental europe ? 
  in terms of cities , i 'd say it 's hard to tell , could be either london , paris , barcelona , amsterdam ... any big and cosmopolite city could serve that role . 
  in terms of countries though , i 'd say spain and uk are close because of their historical regions with their own culture and language ( scotland , catalonia , wales , basque country , galicia , etc. 
  etc. ), 
  and if we just talk about ethnicity and linguistics [ spain is a champ in diversity ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-39cu7qlswxc/tpsuhdhrupi/aaaaaaaaaoi/0zdnwtj2fc8/s1600/espana-idiomas.gif ) imo . 
  castilians , galicians , catalans , basques , asturians , aragonese ... they all have been their own people with their own culture and languages for milennia , today sharing the same country ( and a common language between them besides their own as well ) in honor of hispania as a result of the union of the old germanic christian kingdoms . 
  no one dares to get near baleares with that germanic horde of tourists , obviously . 
  but that 's because we know we 're too similar . 
  the question is insulting : portugal , obviously . 
  from a cultural and linguistic point of view it 's another iberian nation among the iberian nations that compose spain . 
  they 're more than brothers . 
  that hurts ; _ ;, 
  spain is no small country , being the second in extension after france in the eu . 
  germany is 357,168 km2 while spain is 505,990 km2 and also has more coast than france . 
  we are a main european entrance/bridge to africa , and we have ceuta and melilla in that continent that have to deal with the migration flows . 
  which btw also affects you , central and northern european countries , not just us western or the southern countries .
