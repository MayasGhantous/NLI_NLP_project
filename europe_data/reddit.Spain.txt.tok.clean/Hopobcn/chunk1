that 's what happens when your main focus is tourism : - terciary sector 74,6 % ( tourism , etc. . ) - secondary sector 8 % ( fucked up construction , no industry , ... ) - primary sector 17,4 % ( rural agriculture ),

  our bubble [ exploded ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4g6mhbls0c ) [ spanish construction employment ] ( http://www.personal-view.com/talks/uploads/fileupload/0c/308f949f4effa5efe74123cebb178f.jpg ) for instance : [ housing construction in catalonia ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z1foifl1a0gsn2_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=f_newhousing&amp;fdim_y=housing_proj_type:approved+projects&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=com&amp;idim=com:13:01:02:04:03:06:05:07:08:09:10:11:12:15:14:16:17:18:19:41:40:39:38:37:36:35:34:33:32:31:30:29:28:27:26:25:22:20:21:23:24&amp;ifdim=com&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false&amp;xmax=6.07976360937505&amp;xmin=-2.59943560937495&amp;ymax=39.9649980133737&amp;ymin=43.41749969773984&amp;maptype=t&amp;icfg&amp;iconsize=0.5 ) i would say household constructions is kinda dead . 
  but public despite austerity , spending in ave/highways it 's still going on . 
   without spanish you ca n't work in spain . 
  well technically you can find it positions in barcelona that do n't require spanish nor catalan . 
  you only have to look a bit . 
  multinationals and research centers that atract foreigners . 
  ( but yes , salaries are fuck up ), 
  when you fall into a pit you can only go up, 
  n spain : power term : connection fee : 38,04 $ / kw a year retail margin : 4,00 $ / kw a year energy term : connection fee : 4,4027 c $ / kwh energy term : 7,9443 c $ / kwh ----------------- electricity bill : 5,11 % electric meter : 1.7668 c $ / day ---------------- vat 21 %, 
  nordic flags . . 
  so original xd i like swiss flag . 
  the rest seems too similar from the others . 
  in which bucket falls eu agriculture subsidies ? 
  yes we are : http://www.tradingeconomics.com/spain/unemployment-rate ( it 's stuck in 20 ~ 21 % ), 
  it 's sad but eu it 's made for business . 
  it is unfair that rich have free movement of capitals and the rest : free movement of persons ( limited to shenguen ) , to work ( visas ) , unified tax policy ( non-existent , we even allow tax havens ) . 
  do n't put much faith in the eu . 
  what ? 
  yes , because earning less it 's better .

  lol, 
  of course not . 
  from the 7.516.254 hab , 16 ~ 18 % is immigrant . 
  plus lots of tourists go to camp nou to see bar\u00e7a . 
  no , i was shocked at the possibility of people being on a half frozen lake . 
  as i been told it 's a dangerous thing to do ... 
  personally i 've only seen a frozen lake once in my life ( this one https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/lago_de_puigcerd\u00e1 ) some years ago . 
  we tend to have warm summers around barcelona . 
  wtf is that a lake ? 
  people walking in a half-frozen lake ? 
  is that ` safe ' ? 
   pp is :  pro ~ ~ divorce ~ ~ , ~ ~ abortion ~ ~ , ~ ~ gay marriage ~ ~  pro ~ ~ autonomies ~ ~  pro usa , free trade , capitalism , globalism  pro ~ ~ inmigration ~ ~ ** fixed **, 
  in spain : - adamo ( parts of barcelona and asturias ) 1gbps 35 $ - movistar ( country wide ) 300/300 mbps 48 $ - orange ( poor coverage ) 300/300 35 $ in general internet is far from cheap but speeds are improving . 
  you should watch black mirror 2x03 :-d, 
  shame group ( by gdp/capita ) :  1 . 
  grece : -20,5 %  2 . 
  cyprus : -17,0 %  4 . 
  italy : -10,5 %  5 . 
  spain : -8,3 %  6 . 
  findland : -6,2 %  7 . 
  netherlands : -5,5 %  8 . 
  france : -3,3 %  9 . 
  wtf, 
  7 years have passed from the first detainee to the start of the trial . 
  if that 's a healthy judicial system you tell me . 
  btw , threre is not any sort of whistle blower protection , just see ana garrido ( the woman from the bbc photo ) . 
  she was harrassed when she was in the city council etc. . 
  be prepared for inflation the day after the change . 
  here one coffee used to cost 100 pesetas and after the change the cost was 1 $ ( 1 $ = 166ptas --   66 % increase ) good luck with the $ xd . 
  i visited prague this summer and the prices there were ` competitive ' compared to vienna ( for instance ) . 
  i wonder what will happen if finally you adopt the $ . 
  by the way those figures are in $ . 
  so the image shows almost 1 billion $ not 1 trillion ( a big difference since 1 trillion is almost the whole gdp of spain for a year :-p ), 
  good on paper but it has some problems : 1 ) all the traffic that is not passing inside the superblock is going to pass through the ` border ' of the superblock making the situation worse for the people living there . 
  eixample is not precisely a ` quiet ' place due cars , and diverting more cars to a few streets will benefit the ones inside the superblock but completely fuck up the others outside . 
  2 ) bus lines can not go inside the superblock ( some stops were moved ) . 
  so if you live inside and you need to take a bus you will have to walk more . 
  [ here the example ] ( https://noticies.tmb.cat/sites/default/files/canvis_superilla_poblenou_2016.png ), 
  radioactive heating , best heating . 
  people are lazy . 
  3 elections in a row are too much for the left ( which tends to mobilize its people less than the right in spain ) . 
   appreciate that much of what i just said is circumvented to various degrees by different countries , but the broad point remains intact . 
  countries are not supposed to subsidise their banking industry . 
  italy was prevented from doing so . 
   you were both addressing different types of bailout ( internal vs external ) and getting frustrated with each other . 
   i 'm not sure germany is allowed to bailout deutsche bank . 
  if germany ( hypothetically ) had problems paying down it 's debt however , support could be sought from the ecb or imf etc well , the spanish bailout was for the banks not the goberment with an ammount of 100b $ . 
  spain who ? 
  * republica bananera * in spanish . 
  i did n't know it was used in other parts of the world :-p [ banana republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banana_republic ), 
   once you experience california weather returning to cold , ~ ~ cloudy europe ~ ~ ** northern cloudy europe ** is also a major obstacle . 
  do n't underestimate the lower personal taxes and the high standard of living for people making tech salaries in the us . 
  fixed having good weather means nothing . 
  southern europe has good weather and i still do n't see any silicon valley here ... what matters are #jobs available , salaries , taxes , business angels , etc. . . 
   there must be some sort of solution for this , war ? 
  in portugal what happens to the soil of a forest after a wildfire ? 
  they are able to recalificate it from rural ( no edificable ) to urban ? 
  i think in spain we had a law that forbid for 30years any modification of burn soil just to prevent those fuckers that burn the forest but the pp goverment changed it ... 
  also if no using namespace std ; is provided then the string has to be declared with the complete namespace : std : : string european_languages ; ( same for std : : vector ) :-d, 
  i do n't know the rest of europe but in spain netflix is improving a bit but its still a joke compared the us netflix . 
  ( it 's easier to find something in pop-corn time than in netflix ) there are also local companies like movistar + or yomvi ( also movistar ) are tryig to compete . 
   they can hire some advisors from mugabe 's zimbabwe that would be interesting :-d, 
  i would kill for that interest . 
  in my bank it 's not even possible to do a deposit . 
  before that they were giving 0.05 % interest ... 
  i pay 12 $ and i only get 1,2 gb . 
  yes i could pay more but it goes against my religion :-p . 
  i did n't know the eu was just 6 countries ... 
  at least in germany they have '' zero rating '' . 
  in spain the most common is to have 1 gb . 
  and if you want more , prepare your wallet ... 
  sun, 
  also few to no industry in canarias . 
   his is an international site , so people around the world can see the fanatism in your words . 
  you were probably b man , the fanatic here it 's you . 
  the think that really hurts you is that in 2016 there is still people talking in catalan and not in spanish . 
  lol the name ` eeu ' xdddd .
