   constitutional ammendment ( ... ) -2 / 3 of both the congress and the senate . 
  - new elections being called ( obviously all spaniard would vote here , incuding catalonia ) -2 / 3 of the newly elected parliament ( again , both congress and the senate ) - a referendum in which all of spain could vote . 
  that is one of the problems of spain . 
  chainging it from the inside is so fucking hard that ( now a majority of ) catalans decided that ` leave ' is a better option . 
   lol , why would you travel to that shit hole ?

  spain suffered a coup in 1981 ( 1 year before joining nato ) . 
  hopefully the coup was a failure .

   strasbourg parliament ugggh no !, 
  the problem of strasbourg parlament is the floor , that color is awful , also the blue tables seem like made of plastic . 
  the one in brussels is more warm and packed .

  it also adds inflation from the moment 0 .

  he illegally earned 42000 $ in 1997 , 1998 and 1999 . 
  and that is only what we know ... 
   e in for a long time of pp , in fact the danger would be a more right wing party raising , not up . 
   the thing is that there are people that think that independence is not the answer , but still think that spain needs reforms in its basis . 
  spain ca n't be reformed . 
  just see the past elections .

  this country is fucked up . 
  unless pensions are cut in half they are going to vote pp . 
  i think they will rise again the retirement age again , just to minimize any possible pension cut, 
  in two years we will see spain default .

  keep voting pp . 
  basically they are telling their party : `` rob whatever you want , we will vote you anyway '' i 'm done with this shit . 
  they do n't sum up . 
  right now only this is possible : ( 92 % counted 176 is majority ) pp+psoe = 222 pp+c 's = 168 ( psoe abs ) psoe+p odemos = 157 ( c 's abs -- not going to happen ) ... 
  this country it 's fucked up . 
   i do n't remember the last time we got an accurate election result after midnight ( and i 'm just saying that to be safe because it 's usually 9 p 30 minutes later . . 85 % counted yes it 's fast but i have my doubts if this method is ` secure ' . 
  because the company in charge of collecting this numbers * scytl * could do whatever they want . 
  votes are destroyed after they are counted . 
  dont be rude . 
  if they stay in it 's gong to be better for all of us . 
  brexit is a cliff jump for them and for the eu . 
  they can ignore uk demands . 
  then if uk stops making monetary contributions to the eu , they can activate the expulsion . 
  but that is political fiction . 
  * harmonised document in the context of readmission agreements reached with third countries * interesting . 
  are they going to allow uk nationals to stay in eu ( but with this document ? ), 
  is this to put pressure in the negotiations ? 
  we have elections next monday 26j . 
  pp desperately needs votes , and they think that go nationalistic might report votes . 
  well after brexit , the spanish goverment could close the border and problem solved .

  what a shame of minister . 
  he and his wett dream of manipulating the people with shit . 
  lol, 
  the strategy followed by pp is * divide and conquer * : * you do n't like catalan/valenci \u00e0 ? 
  easy let 's split the language in two so it 's easier to kill it . 
  * if you are from valencia you will know what * blaverisme * is . 
  * greek alphabet does n't have question marks ? 
  there are plenity of fascism supporters in spain : * democracia nacional * plataforma por catalu\u00f1a * movimiento social republicano * espa\u00f1a 2000 * falange espa\u00f1ola de las jons * falange aut\u00e9ntica * alternativa espa\u00f1ola * la espa\u00f1a en marcha you will see them in 12 october in madrid & valencia . 
  but they do n't attract many voters , instead they vote for pp . 
   i love the hate to spain here as always.anyway , if you listen to the radio interview it 's pretty clear he doesnt give a fuck and is in no way angry , just doing a formalism . 
  there is a lot of tobacco smuggling in that border .

  why they want to kick cameron ? 
  to be the good guys that pushed the ` leave button ' or to force a remain ? 
  you were wrong cia . 
  they should let banco popular go down and jail it 's managers . 
  they help corrupt politicians to laundry money ( gurtel case ) . 
  also when partido popular is centenced to pay 1m $ to the judge , banco popular go and paid for them . 
  instead of giving loans to normal people to buy homes , cars , whatever , they were doing loans to invest in their own stocks !, 
  ( facepalm ) .

  i do n't see differences between northern spain and southern france or italy . 
  ( maybe i 'm wrong ) gypsys have darker colors . 
  in the canary islands they also have darker colors ( too much sun and beaches ) . 
  also farmers they get brown .
