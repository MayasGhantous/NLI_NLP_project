  [ our construction bubble was epic ] ( http://ieconomics.com/i/nybrcus4-1606 ) . 
  | europhiles always expect the impossible . 
  like monetary union without * fiscal union * to be a stable arrangement !, 
  the eu has too many open fronts . 
  no need to open another . 
  i do n't think the eu would survive if country a or country b would have to change it 's tax scheme . 
  it 's sad , but ... 
  individual countries ca n't devaluate the $ , that 's true . 
  but still , the eurozone as a whole can control the $ with the ecb . 
  the problem with that is that sometimes not all economic policies are beneficial for every eurozone country . 
  export nations like germany benefit the most from the eu . 
  you just have to check the [ trade superplust ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=grtbale&amp;v=201606110811n&amp;d1=19160101&amp;d2=20161231&amp;h=300&amp;w=600 ) that they have . 
  and then compare it with ` import ' nations like spain [ spanish balance of trade ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=sptbeubl&amp;v=201605261910n&amp;d1=19160101&amp;d2=20161231&amp;h=300&amp;w=600 ), 
  spammer, 
  psoe ( and pp ) just think they can do whatever they want when they are in power ... just because today is us , tomorroy you , then us . 
  how you could argument this : [ the government pardons alfredo s\u00e1enz ] ( http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2011/11/25/actualidad/1322209980_850215.html ) who votes corrupt parties supports corruption .

  you should compare apples with apples . 
  us numbers are annualized while eu numbers are only for q1 ( to compare with us you should add q1 , 2,3,4 ) . 
  free trade ( free movement of capital ) does n't make sense without ` free movement ' ( movement of persons to where employment is ) . 
  depends on which sources that you use . 
  for example [ this ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=wgdpspai&amp;v=201604041651n&amp;d1=20060101&amp;d2=20161231&amp;h=300&amp;w=600 ) gdp actual previous highest lowest dates unit frequency 1381.34 1369.26 1634.99 12.07 1960 - 2014 usd billion yearly in [ gdp ppp ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=espnygdppcapkd&amp;v=201604041651n&amp;d1=20060101&amp;d2=20161231&amp;h=300&amp;w=600 ) we are not in the same level yet . 
  unemployment wise . . look at [ this ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=umrtes&amp;v=201605041809n&amp;d1=19160101&amp;d2=20161231&amp;h=300&amp;w=600 ) . 
  i hope this time it takes less than 15 years to push unemployment below 10 % . 
  after a lost decade , 1 year of recovery is not enough . 
  i think we are not in 2007 levels yet . 
  and recovery in employmen nowadays consists in replacing 1 job of 1000 $ / month by two part-job of 500 $ / month : - /, 
  nonsense . 
  spain has more installed capacity than the required to run the country . 
  we have like 100.000 mw of installed capacity when never we will use more than 50.000 mw ( average peak consumption is ~ 30.000 mw ) . 
  and since green energy enters first to the energy pool at 0 $ / mw ... electric loby was not happy with this . 
  there 's a big push from american it companies to improve machine learning . 
  there 's a lot of money to gain . 
  jus imagin uber replacing all human pilots with computers that do n't earn , do n't eat , do n't strike . 
  the perfect worker . 
  it will happen before you think . 
   beside that the only other unifying element of ~ ~ slavic ~ ~ essos is how much ~ ~ westerners ~ ~ westeros ignore us . 
  said the iron bank from braavos . 
  fixed . 
  if uk leaves it is expected that they will remain in eea from wikipedia : `` the eea countries that are not part of the eu do not bear the financial burdens associated with eu membership , although they contribute financially to the european single market . 
  ... non-eu countries do not receive any funding from eu policies and development funds . 
  ... these countries have to adopt part of the law of the european union . 
  this situation has been described as a `` fax democracy '' , with norway waiting for their latest legislation to be faxed from the commission . '', 
  so maybe they wo n't pay 15b but clearly remaining in the eea has a cost . 
  wow . 
  that 's a disaster !, 
  if the bubble bursts and the prices fall those people that count on selling higher will be fucked up . 
  in sweden if you return the house to the bank the debt is free ? 
  or you still have to pay the remainder ? 
  he is talking about 2070 . 
  but looking at the population pyramid here : http://www.populationpyramid.net/es/espa%c3%b1a/2037/ in 20 years from now ( 2037 ) the biggest chunk of population will be or already retired or in the process of retirement . 
  it will become unsustainable way before that .

  19\u00bac in barcelona , but today it 's so sunny that feels like it 's already summer :-d, 
   in accordance with the procedures at reference , nato has received on 24 march 2017 , a disaster assistance request from ukraine . 
   a fire occurred on 23 march 2017 at 14:45 ( local time ) at an ammunition depot in balaklia , kharkiv region , ukraine . 
  the fire initiated the detonation of missiles and ammunition . 
  only 4 lines of text ? 
  and what kind of assistance ? 
  letters are a thing from the past . 
  now diplomacy is done via twitter xd . 
  if you want some catalan polling data i was able to find this https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/estudis_del_suport_social_a_la_independ%c3%a8ncia_de_catalunya it seems to contain every poll made from spanish & catalan institutions and some newspapers . 
  use google translator to translate it from catalan to english if you want . 
  luxemburg has 3,8 x more gdp/capita than poland, 
  the housing market in spain is growing in some parts of the country and still falling in others . 
  for instance : * barcelona +17 % / year up ( 4093 $ / m2 ) ( at a level of march 2009 , historic maximum of 4731 $ / m2 in march 2007 ) * palma de mallorca +12,3 % / year up ( 2132 $ / m2 ) * murcia -23,5 % / year down ( 1103 $ / m2 ) in general its still far from pre-crisis levels .

  that video is full of treasures !, 
  he only says that he is not going to answer a question in english . 
  he tries to say something later when he noticed it sounded a bit strange but nothing more . 
  it 's good in barcelona , hospitalet , badalona , etc. . as you go further from the center public transportation gets worse and centralized to/from barcelona . 
  as this is going to affect 40 municipalities and not just barcelona . 
  this is going to impact more those who live outside barcelona and need a car to go to work than people from barcelona . 
  you can live in barcelona without a car , outside barcelona not so sure . 
  yep , the spanish government got a couple of lawsuits , but the [ spanish supreme court ruled in favour of the government ] ( http://www.pv-tech.org/news/first-international-lawsuit-ruling-in-favour-of-spains-feed-in-tariff-cuts ) . 
  pp is not much in favor of renewables . 
  they retroactively changed the amount of subsidies to solar and wind and a lot of small investors went broke . 
  wine is for pussies !, 
  [ yes ] ( https://www.google.es/maps/@41.5940417,1.8413183,3a,90y,237.25h,137.35t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sqbrkvnykqe_pylprof8q5w!2e0!3e2!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) . 
  it seems uber dangerous to climb on top of that thing . . more than one died in that mountain doing stupid things . 
  according to the judge , there is no risk of escape because he has police escort . 
  that means that the spanish people are paying urdangar\u00edn a private escort abroad that prevents him from being molested by scum and that also exempts him from problems as the payment of the bond or having to bother to travel to spain to visit the court . 
  or get independence !, 
  it 's not actually lava anymore , it 's just rocks that you can clearly see that geologically are from yesterday ( color + no-vegetation ) . 
  i 've been there and i totally recommend that island . 
  the caldera de taburiente valley is a must . 
  uk - france ? 
  she is not going to pay anything . 
  in 2015 she was forced to pay 587.413 $ as a deposit . 
  since the fine is only 265.000 $ they will have to return him more than 300.000 $ !, 
  meneame.net is the spanish reddit . 
  it 's funny to see how some things appear first here and after some hours/days appear in meneame . 
  which one is the third one ? 
  is people worried about global warming and sea level rising in the netherlands ? 
  firstly i thought it was a joke :-) . 
  those photos are hilarious . 
  it 's cheaper in this cases : * t-12 : you have between 4 and 16 years and travel only in zone 1 : 35 $ in 12years !, 
  * t-jove : if you have less than 25 years : 1 zone : 4 x 105 $ = 420 $ 2 zone : 4 x 142 $ = 568 $ etc. .
