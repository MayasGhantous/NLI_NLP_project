  in barcelona : ( four trimester tickets ) 1 zone : 4 x 142 $ = 568 $ 2 zone : 4 x 192 $ = 768 $ up to 6 zone : 4 x 405 $ = 1620 $ ( nobody buys this ) etc. . .

  there are more extreme cases : * badia del vall\u00e8s : 58,86 % unemployment ( down from 70,97 % in 11/2012 ) and average gross income of 20340 $ / capita * sant cugat del vall\u00e8s : 4,66 % unemployment ( peak at 8.41 % in 8/2012 ) and average gross income of 45035 $ / capita sant cugat is 4,8 km from badia . 
  for the ones interested : an [ interactive map of the unemployment in spain ] ( http://es.goolzoom.com/?&amp;hl=es&amp;hc=es&amp;lat=41.432600&amp;lng=0.354277&amp;zoom=6&amp;type=roadmap&amp;tab=data&amp;iddata=lipoblacionparo ) ( municipal level ), 
  the spanish government always tried to hide to the public the ` real ' spending in military . 
  for instance [ this ( only in spanish ) ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/catalunya/adios_a_las_armas/fraude-presupuesto-militar-espana_6_455364470.html ) shows that the ministry of defense had in 2015 a budget of 5787 m $ ( 0.5 % gdp ) but if someone starts to sum all military-related spendings the real budget was 17464 m $ ( 1.6 % gdp ) . 
  * it 's cold and apparently we have more demmand now . 
  this means we rely on more costly ways of generating energy ( coal , gas & fuel ) when demand rises than when demand is low . 
  * tthe way the prices are calculated does n't help either : the more expensive power plant in terms of $ / mwh dictates the price we pay to the other cheaper power plants . 
  that 's good when only wind , solar and nuclear is enough ( 0 $ / mwh ) but not so much when coal and gas enter in the mix . 
  * oligopolistic market * the fact that some french nuclear reactors were shut down does n't help either, 
  ** spain : ** * energy prices are in a record high . 
  98 $ / mhw [ https://www.esios.ree.es/en/market-and-prices] ( https://www.esios.ree.es/en/market-and-prices ) * the government hires a firm ( gunvor international ) to try to cheapen the energy prices . 
  some claim that the firm is linked with a russian multimillionaire linked with the panama papers and vladimir putin . 
  * two rural agents dead after a hunter shot them in the head after having an argument . 
  * the city of madrid has paid [ 58 million ] ( http://images.eldiario.es/fotos/tabla-importes-abonado-ayuntamiento-madrid_ediima20170120_0703_19.jpg ) in electricity and water of the m-30 that corresponded to the private companies ( dragados , api ( acs ) and ferrovial ), 
  yes , and the [ reconquista ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/spain_reconquista_cities.png/1920px-spain_reconquista_cities.png ) ~ just ~ took 722 years . 
  maybe eurostat data is collected at the ` urban district ' level ?

  for spain , the subdivision shown in this map is the ` provincial ' level . 
  much better than a [ municipality map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/municipalities_of_spain.svg/572px-municipalities_of_spain.svg.png ), 
  is n't that ` risky ' ? 
  what happens if things go south and some country does n't pay . 
  just . . wow , wow . 
  7460 billion norwegian kroner = 828.271331 billion $ this fund is only funded with north sea oil ( apart from investments ) ? 
  or includes pensions ? 
  maybe he is referring to montseny which sometimes has snow and it 's closer than pedraforca to barcelona ( 40 ~ 50km ) . 
  if by the ` mountains around barcelona ' you refer to the pirinees or the pre-pirinees then yes , it 's not rare to see snow there . 
  but in barcelona ( city ) it 's rare . 
  last serious snowing was in 2010 . 
  ( more or less once every 5 years ), 
  1 geneva 2 lyon 10 saint petersburg ? 
  lesson is do n't bailout private banks . 
  bailout people . 
  bigger than iraq deployment ? 
  it might not be paris for the parisians but it is in the eyes of the rest of the world . 
  last month i went to paris and it 's funny how locals consider ` paris ' as the most restrictive definition ( the municipality of paris ), 
  if you like vegetation & volcanoes go to la palma . 
  very green and beatiful island . 
  the [ caldera de taburiente national park ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caldera_de_taburiente_national_park ) is awsome . 
  it was n't my real direction , just ` close ' xd but ok . 
  no , i was referring to just demolish ( :-d ) some blocks and replace them with skyscrapers ny style xd did i already say i love skyscrapers ? 
  also i do n't like the 11 % up in rents from 2014 to 2016 ... 
  because i 'm counting door to door , from my home to my work : walk + train ( rub\u00ed -  sarria ) + bus + walk = 1h 10min to get there . 
  obviously by car is much less : 25min in a normal day and 1h in rush hour . 
  technically agencia tributaria collects all taxes in catalonia , excluding the ones generalitat has the 100 % . 
  the big chunk of funding comes from the autonomic part of the irpf and vat , and those money 's are collected by agencia tributaria . 
  that 's a fact . 
  i know , i live in rub\u00ed and the 2h 20min i spend every day moving to barcelona to work it 's not funny at all . 
  i would rather have dark streets than to be forced to live outside barcelona because of the rent prices . 
  i always wondered why we do n't replace each ` illa ' for a massive skyscraper to solve the housing buble that is starting to form in bcn ( too much simcity i know :-d ) . 
  good luck with your race to the bottom !, 
  then what . 
  catalans should push for deniying the basque & navarra privileges or for obtainig those ? 
   why are you more special than galicia or asturias ? 
  why is the basque country and navarra more special than the other 15 communities ? 
  interesting , portugal has the same energy pattern as spain ( at this precise moment ) but in a smaller scale and without nuclear . 
  pd : awful map projection, 
  and children have to beat the log to force him to shit the presents [ :-p ] ( https://coachingcat.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/tic3b3-de-nadal-estomacat.jpg ), 
  median salary of $ 2,143 gross / $ 1,718 net a month ? 
  i do n't trust those numbers . 
  lol clearly i was refering to 2007 :-d, 
  the housing buble in spain exploded by the end of 2017 just when the blue line and red lines diverge . 
  1 ) is the cold war back ? 
  now the russian army is the ` red army ' ? 
  2 ) when i saw the title i thought it was some sort of joke but they did it lool . 
  you have to add the autonomic part to those tables . 
  from ------------- to ------------- base ( state part ) -- additional ( state | deficit ) -- autonomic part ( catalonia ) -- total -------- 0,00 $ 17 707,20 $ ----- 12,0 % ----------- 0,8 % -------------------------- 12 % ------------------------------ 24,8 % -17 707,20 $ 33 007,20 $ ----- 14,0 % ----------- 2,0 % ------------------------- 18,5 % ---------------------------- 34,5 % -33 007,20 $ 53 407,20 $ ----- 18,5 % ----------- 3,0 % ------------------------- 21,5 % ---------------------------- 43 % -53 407,20 $ 120 000,20 $ -- 21,5 % ----------- 4,0 % ------------------------ 23,5 % ---------------------------- 49 % 120 000,20 $ 175 000,20 $ -- 22,5 % ----------- 5,0 % ------------------------- 25,5 % ---------------------------- 53 % 175 000,20 $ 300 000,20 $ -- 23,5 % ----------- 6,0 % -------------------------- 25,5 % ---------------------------- 55 % 300 000,20 $ en adelante ------ 23,5 % ----------- 7,0 % -------------------------- 25,5 % ---------------------------- 58,9 % if the most common salary is 16490 $ ( gross ) the net would be 12400,48 $ ( or 1033 $ / month ) . 
  * catalonia as the autonomic part because it 's the worst case in spain . 
  best case would be basque country i think . 
  also , nuclear submarines can launch icbms from anywhere ... not even antartica is safe, 
  not everybody gets 14 payments . 
  it depends of each type of contract and the company . 
  for instance in the company i 'm now they pay 12 payments . 
   we try to be inside during the central hours in the day , we have ac everywhere not everyone has ac . 
  for instance me and some coworkers that live in barcelona we do n't have ac . 
  the worst is not +30 \u00bac during the day ... the worst is +30 \u00bac + humid air at night and no ac . 
  that 's the definition of hell :-p . 
  whoa !, 
  he has a time machine !, 
  i did n't say it 's a shame on podemos , more the other way around . 
  it 's a shame on psoe for supporting the pp corruption , like c 's . 
  he is still the secretary general of the party . 
  if he decides a , party has to follow behind . 
  also the courts can elect anyone for president , not only elected diputados . 
  to my knowledge , spain has f18 not f16 . 
  care to explain ? 
  they forced him to renounce . 
  a ` or you renounce or we will fire you ' type of situation . 
   we have been having presidents since 1359 . 
  except in the periods where the generalitat was abolished : - 1714 to 1932 during franco era the generalitat was also abolished but the catalan government was in the exile, 
  nah , he just drew a straight line to decide where to go :-d, 
  exterminate !, 
  in ll\u00edvia they speak catalan and spanish . 
  although it sits entirely inside france , it 's only 7km from the center of puigcerd\u00e0 ( 10min drive ) . 
  i would say the architecture of la cerdanya is a bit different of the one in france . 
  maybe it 's my impression but the feel i think it 's different . 
  also a clear difference are the traffic sings ( as a kid i always found interesting , those curved arrows that french roads have xd ) . 
  to do that you need military support,
