  the most popular music is almost exclusively spanish , the more flamenco touches , the better . 
  and have you ever told anyone that , say , italian cuisine is superior to spanish cuisine ? 
  sets off a shitstorm every time . 
  hyperbole ? 
  probably . 
  but not really wrong either , is it ? 
  note that i 'm not even getting started on the way spanish nationalism confronts the other nationalisms in spain ... let 's leave that one for some other time . 
   spain is one of the most virulently left-wing countries in europe are you serious ? 
  [ look at these election results . 
  ] ( http://www.diarioinformacion.com/elementosweb/gestioncajas/mmp/image/2016/resultados-elecciones-generales-2016-provincias.jpg ) it 's the bluest fucking map i 've ever seen !, 
  i mean , the last time a left wing party won an election , it took the right wing government getting caught lying about a terrorist attack a couple of days before the election . 
  of course , you say ...  the only serious right-wing party is pp , and even they barely describe themselves as such ... which is quite amazing , really . 
  there were actual franco regime ministers in that party not too long ago ( as in : until 4 years ago ) . 
  in what universe is the pp `` barely '' a right wing party ? 
  it 's true that there 's no radical right wing parties with much success in spain ... that 's because all the radical right wingers feel perfectly fine voting for pp . 
   inflict upon spain the same mentality ( bordering on self hate ) as germany , which it already has in many aspects yeah , no . 
  you happen do be comparing my two homelands there and i really do n't see it . 
  a little less pride and cojones and a little more open minds really would n't hurt spain , in my opinion . 
  * at all * . 
  but of course , i suspect we 'd disagree about this german `` self hate '' you describe in the first place , so maybe that 's just what it is . 
  the thing 's part of a exposition , it 's quite silly that it has caused this kind of backlash . 
  man , maybe i 'm getting old or am not as civilized as i 'd like ... but under 3 years for killing someone ? 
  that 's quite something . 
  from the victim 's family 's point of view , i could imagine it almost seems worth it to stab the guy on the day he 's released and just take three years as well . 
  dude , you 're the only one talking about the patriarchy . 
  you 're arguing with imaginary beings ( some would call them strawmen ) . 
  but , anyway , since you asked for sources : [ here 's a source .

  [ or how about some pornhub demographics ? 
  ] ( http://www.pornhub.com/insights/pornhub-2015-year-in-review ) you might also want to check out the world and people around you some time . 
  i mean if you were n't being facetious and honestly needed evidence to know that pictures of naked women are more sought after than pictures of naked men , i 'm afraid you 've spent too much time in internetland . 
  [ you 're advocating shooting people at european borders in this very thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/52vdb8/eastern_german_town_of_bautzen_witnesses_clashes/d7ohe1e ) . 
  i 'm going to go ahead and take a big , fat dump on anything you have to say on the issue . 
  the article clearly states there have been ongoing clashes between migrants and far-right groups in this town in the past couple of months . 
  neonazi groups set an asylum seeker home on fire in that town , ffs . 
  all this information is right there in the article . 
  setting the beginning of the conflict at the moment some migrant threw a bottle is completely arbitrary . 
  and what we see in the video is pretty damn obviously * not * just a group of citizens acting in self-defense . 
  all you non-germans should stop talking out of your asses about what you 're clearly simply not understanding ( talking language here , not intellect ) . 
  more like `` these guys are racist and therefore calling them racist is an accurate description of reality '' . 
  the guy who 's not okay with mobs of dudes chasing foreigners through the streets , while shouting nationalist slogans ... * that * guy is a total edgelord . 
  how did he even come up with such an artificially controversial opinion ? 
  every downvote is a badge of honor , coming from people like you guys . 
  amazing . 
  do you speak german ? 
  if so , have you watched the video ? 
  you 're german . 
  you can watch the video , see these guys do what they do , say what they say and how they say it ... and do n't think they 're racists ? 
  come on , man . 
  concerned german citizens do not behave that way and you know it . 
  nah , that did n't come off as sassy as when i used it . 
  and you do n't have an argument . 
  i 'm calling a spade a spade , based on what we can see in the video . 
  i have n't said a word about the `` other side '' , nor about what might have caused this situation . 
  the only ones concerned with shifting blame around , are those who 're trying to somehow turn this obvious bunch of neonazi knuckleheads into a group of concerned citizens , acting in self-defense . 
  `` but they started it '' . 
  the argument of a 5 year old . 
  anything else or are we done here ? 
  how else would you call a group of angry germans shouting `` wir sind das volk '' while chasig a bunch of migrants through the city ? 
  i mean that 's in the video , no `` l\u00fcgenpresse-tinfoil '' needed . 
  nobody said anything about atonement . 
  i do n't believe in that shit . 
  i 'm talking about cause and effect . 
  former colonial powers have a lot of immigrants from their former colonies . 
  that is a fact . 
  if you force your culture on other peoples , they will come to your country first , if they ever decide to emigrate . 
  happens . 
  to act as if this historical reality does n't matter , is ignorant at best and disingenuous at worst . 
  and again , ** you ** are the one that started talking about your ancestors . 
  either history matters or it does n't , you ca n't have the cake and eat it too . 
  one more thing ... 
  spare me your whataboutisms and strawmen here . 
  if you ca n't respond to my actual points , i 'd prefer you did n't make up new ones . 
  just for the record : that i exclude turkey and the ottoman empire from my argument is pure imagination on your part , so is that supposed `` narrative '' of mine about the slave trade ( you reeeeally tried hard with that one , huh ? 
  ahh , i see , is n't that convenient ? 
  cherry picking whatever vague concepts you have of `` your ancetors '' when it suits you , discarding any negative connotations that might come with that , when it does n't . 
  and god fobrid anyone paint your people with a broad brush , that 's a big no no !, 
  you 're ridiculous . 
  maybe your ancestors should n't have colonized half the middle east/north africa then . 
  i mean you guys do realize that that 's the reason why you have that relatively big muslim population , do n't you ? 
  and do n't tell me that happened too long ago to matter , * you 're * the one who brought up your ancestors . 
  where 's the people calling for censorship , though ? 
  at least in this thread , i 've seen no one suggesting anything of the sort . 
  there 's no need for you to point out how that cartoon is `` allowed '' . 
  seems more like you need a reminder that calling it a shitty cartoon is also allowed . 
  have you ever seen one of those isis `` promo-videos '' ? 
  they look like trailers to some cheap ass hollywood action movie , explosions and badass music and everything included . 
  these fucks think of themselves as the heroes in their own little mind-movie , i 'm convinced of that . 
  and it 's very obvious these people are n't that isolated from the west as they probably tell themselves . 
  do n't get me wrong , i absolutely agree with you on that point . 
  from the moment the video on the roof appeared , it was obvious this was n't islamist terrorism , yet people kept trying to spin it that way for days . 
  all i 'm saying is the kid is just as obviously not a neo nazi . 
  i mean when roof guy confronts him , he starts talking about what happened in 5th grade , ffs . 
  he 's the typical teenage shooter we 've seen lots of times since columbine . 
  man , i 'm starting to get really tired of the word `` narrative '' . 
  especially when you end up seeing a kind of `` narrative-ception '' , where both sides of an argument start identifyig supposed narrative-pushers , which in turn makes them push their own narrative , which in turn gets called out ... rinse and repeat and all we 're left with is some hot air .
