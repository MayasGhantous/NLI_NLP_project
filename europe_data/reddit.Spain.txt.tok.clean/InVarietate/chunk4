  i find this party kind of contradictory . 
  it is far away from swedish principles and democracy ... as any other nationalist movement , by the way . 
  it seems pretty fair ... 
  but i have to ask : does romania have the ability to protect borders from putin 's minions ( serbia , moldavia ) ? 
  i really do n't know . 
  love romania , by the way . 
  hope some day i can visit bucarest properly . 
  in l\u00e9rida ( catalonia , spain ) we have a similar problem . 
  many citizens , journalists and even open-minded muslims have recently reported some kind of ` religious police ' in some l\u00e9rida districts . 
  in my opinion , problem with scandinavian welfare state model is it 's only viable because : * 1 ) they are very few inhabitants , * 2 ) population is concentrated in one or two big cities . 
  they 're model is very good , but it can not be the one to be copied by countries like spain or italy . 
  i believe mediterranean welfare state model is pretty bad , but anglo-saxon ( uk , canada , australia ) is the easiest to be exported . 
  ** spain ** 1 ) every single party is fighting to see who is less racist and who loves refugees more . 
  which is kind of strange , since appart from some non-represented parties and some regional pseudo-fascist parties , no party is suspicious of racism . 
  2 ) central government is releasing an organic law to give our constitutional court power to punish regional governors that do not observe its sentences . 
  this is the case of catalonian government , which has been ignoring several constitutional court sentences in the last decade . 
  we have catalan elections on sept. 27 , so there would be an electoral strategy . 
  3 ) opposition leader pedro s\u00e1nchez ( psoe , spanish workers ' socialist party ) has rejected to pronounce about a national agreement to speak with nato and/or eu in order to send more troops to syria . 
  4 ) cameron called rajoy `` my dear friend mariano '' several times in their joint press conference in la moncloa ( our presidential palace ) . 
  many jokes around this . 
  shall we undress ourselves and move our asses near of their dicks too ? 
  two words : electric car, 
  meh , at least you tried, 
  spain is not worse than denmark in girls ' beauty . 
  well , ignorance is bliss for you , i guess . 
  this is one of those moments you appreciate you 're not scandinavian . 
  man , i can not understand how human life can exist over there . 
  i 'm afraid i live autumn like many of you live summer :p, 
  i meant the fallacy is `` making its own decisions '' . 
  scottish people make their own decisions at regional level ( parliament of scotland ) , at national level ( parliament of westminster ) and at european level ( european parliament ) , so i do n't see why they would be * making their own decisions * if they broke any of those levels . 
  and the second one is that the uk does n't need to intervene in other countries affairs since you have colonies , sovereign bases , commonwealth realms and all of that around the world in orther to control foreign affairs . 
  indeed , the uk ** leads ** ( not like germany in the eu ) a supranational organization , the commonwealth of nations , that includes more countries and more population than the eu . 
   i think that 's mainly because people here believe in a country making its own decisions this is a fallacy . 
  if this were true , come on , give scotland and northern ireland their independence , leave the un and the commonwealth . 
  why is it not compatible with being part of the european union ? 
   but why should we intervene in national affairs and regulate less powerful nations you actually do that . 
  in fact , your chief of state is the same person as in 15 other less powerful countries . 
  do n't know why . 
  uk is a powerful state that gives a lot of money to the eu . 
  they have a powerful diplomacy too , they even lead another supranational organization ( commonwealth ) . 
  and also , eu needs a voice of opposite . 
  maybe federalists do n't like , maybe supranationalists do n't appreciate that , but the truth is a variety of opinion makes eu better instead of worse . 
  well , almost the same can be said about scotland leaving the united kingdom and i guess you would say it is a lie or , at least , a half-truth when snp says everything will be better outside the uk and everything is awful within . 
  as a spaniard , i have to say eu is one of the best ideas ever made . 
  does germany have an overexecutive power there ? 
  yes , it does . 
  but i would prefer if we changed that instead of breaking it all . 
  and for the uk , i see a suicide in leaving the eu . 
  that would increase uk 's costs , decrease uk 's income , stablish new taxes at borders , call for low reliability ( london stock exchange could have a problem ) and take the uk out of its neighbours ' politics . 
  just my opinion , though . 
  i respect there are lots of britons that does n't see it like that . 
  either ways , we would win every single football match, 
  by the way , there are other two villages in extremadura in which they speak portuguese : * [ cedillo ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/cedillo ) , they speak ( or used to speak ) regular portuguese . 
  * [ herrera de alc\u00e1ntara ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/herrera_de_alc%c3%a1ntara ) , in which they speak ( or used to speak ) a very archaic variety of portuguese . 
  in both of them , they invite spanish and portuguese authorities during their festive days as a symbol of brotherhood between the two nations . 
  just passed through olivenza/oliven \u00e7a . 
  but in any case , all those villages , both portuguese and spanish , have a mixture between alentejan and extremaduran food . 
  so gorgeous , yes it is :d, 
  elections in 3 months and we hve a government that approved a general budget for our country ( * presupuestos generales del estado * ) that foresees we are going to spend more than what we get . 
  sad , but hey , it 's like a tradition . 
  it does n't matter if you 're left-wing ( psoe , iu ) or right-wing ( ciu , erc ) , in spain every single government spends more that what we earn . 
  just a rich man that uses racist comments to be in every single american headline , so that he could eventually win primaries . 
  this is absolutely absurd . 
  every single islamic country is vulnerable to islamism and thus to jihadism . 
  well , it 's yours if you want . 
  it 's a 10,000 people village that lies in extremadura , which has a looooooot more self-government capacity than alentejo could ever have . 
  so , if you think you would be happier , then it 's yours . 
  well , i personally would say a iberian state could work . 
  indeed , [ there was a try back in 19 ^ th century emulating italian and german unifications ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iberian_federalism ) . 
  there was even a [ flag for this state ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/bandeira_federalista_ib%c3%a9rica_%281854%29.svg ) . 
  it depends on the way we do . 
  i believe we could be much greater if we unite in a proper way , but unite in a bad way could bring an horrible aftermath . 
  you know , portugal is a presidential republic , spain is a parliamentary monarchy , portugal is unitary , spain is heavily descentralized . 
  not easy i guess . 
  statu quo is a good way , though . 
  i would say dec 20 ^ th has n't the impact you say , guys . 
  i mean , do you really think people is in christmas holidays those days ? 
  most of the people works until 22 ^ nd or 23 ^ rd. 
  i believe the match is different . 
  those days , state general administration is going to get a lot of money from the new extraordinary pay of christmas . 
  and also , rajoy is about to announce lower taxes since jan 1 ^ st. 
  well , you know , in extremadura and alentejo they do n't talk about `` la frontera '' ( * the border * ) , they talk about `` la raya '' ( * the line * ) . 
  that was because they never understood why a border there , they only new it was a line you should n't cross if you did n't want any problem with guardia civil or guardinha . 
  this is huge man !, 
  i love it, 
  congratulations to our best neighbours !, 
  it 's been a pleassure having visited portugal many times . 
  although there was an independence , i can not talk portuguese people as foreigners because they always treated me like a someone very near to they culture . 
  [ ah , those ages in which we conquered the world together ... ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/spanish_empire_anachronous_0.png ), 
   well the west does invade countries always with the proper resolution of un security council . 
   sometimes intervenes uninvited in internal affairs of other sovereign nations this is something every single sovereign state does , from andorra to lesotho . 
   i personally believe it 's an irrational fear that eastern european countries have of russia invading them irrational ? 
  man , georgia and ukraine tried to get into the eu and nato and they got invaded , there are abkhazia , south osetisa , crimea , lugansk and donetsk . 
  and there 's transnistria too over moldova . 
  so there actually is a rational fear . 
  [ ceuta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ceuta ) and [ melilla ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/melilla ) are two spanish cities from northern africa that have land borders with the kingdom of morocco . 
  they 're not colonies , since they have seats in ower parliament and they have an autonomous status similar to any region of spain . 
  and also , they have been spanish since 15th century . 
  i do n't think i said it was better . 
  they do not like .
