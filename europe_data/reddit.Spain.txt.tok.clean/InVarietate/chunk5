  but since it is a monarchy , they have a stability other islamic countries have not . 
  and thus , morocco can afford good relations with eu while punishing terrorists . 
  it 's like jordan , in that sense . 
  we have the problem of western sahara , you know , and they usually try to tease spain with military manouvers over ceuta , melilla and spanish islands . 
  but they 're doing pretty well with all of this terrorist threat . 
  news ? 
  at least in galicia , leon , extremadura and both castilles we have a very good impression of you guys . 
  at least every single spaniard i talked to speaks pretty well about portugal . 
  i 've been several times to alentejo and lisbon and it 's gorgeous . 
  and a couple of times to algarve , which is awesome . 
  maybe they just do n't like to have a russian military base . 
  not the kind of country that would ensure belarus ' * democracy * , independence or economic interests . 
  yes , i saw that yesterday . 
  i must say morocco is very clear and hard about punishing terrorists , which is something i have to appreciate . 
  it is an islamic country , so you never now , but mohammed vi is doing pretty well in this . 
  ca n't say the same with western sahara , for example . 
   after the independence atempt from castille and l\u00e9on that failed in the 14/15/16 century which century ? 
  xd  language was forbidden and persecuted and the `` official '' name changed to the castillian version lie . 
  there was no official opression against any language in castillian-leonese territories ( except for arabic ) . 
  it 's just galician lost influence in poetry and culture since portuguese and spanish were producing a lot of it . 
  but if you think so , would you kindly give as a pdf of that royal messure ? 
  if it were true ( obviously is n't ) , it would be at our registry , such as many others . 
   the danger that galiza would join portugal was high so the castillian crown made every possible effort to destroy the culture and language of that people . 
  another lie . 
  there 's no such a font or a royal law in castille with such a thing . 
  in that years , people did n't change their integrity or loyalty because language or cultural affairs . 
  people were n't nationalist , as you are . 
  and by the way , the crown of castille had many languages apart from galician and castillian . 
  astur-leonese , basque languages , navarro-aragonese , mozarab , arab and berber . 
  only these last two were punished , the other one existed and today astur-leonese and navarro-aragonese are extincted except for very little , rural villages in which they mix castillian with those latin languages . 
  that 's why castillian was started to be called spanish , because it mixed with astur-leonese , navarro-aragonese and mozarab . 
  and , as you might now , basque has an official status within spain . 
  and it had in medieval ages within the kingdom of castille , by the way . 
   the nationalist movement of the late 19th century was only a return to the roots and the way that the people spoke at the time ( and still do ) . 
  this is partially true . 
  but galician official grammar , since it is not a unitary language , is pretty new . 
  in 1970 , while franco 's dictatorship ( who was galician , by the way ) , it appeared the first one . 
   so galiza is n't a name invented by the nationalist movement . 
  far from it . 
  well , ok , it is a name that coexisted with the term galicia a thousand years ago . 
  it 's like calling spain `` spanha '' or `` hispanhas '' , which can be found in very old medieval texts . 
  remember in those years there was n't an official grammar . 
  and remember again galician had n't grammar until 1970 . 
  i could get a medieval text in which alentejo is called * alenteixos * and say that it 's the portuguese nation that opress alentejan people since the 14th century , but i wo n't because i 'm not that stupid . 
  so , in other words , learn history , and do not repeat nationalist free-style interpretations . 
  you do not have a good football team , that makes you weaker in these things . 
  however , you have a beautiful country ( though brussels is freaking expensive ... ) . 
  you embarrassed me for being spanish . 
  please , stop . 
  the local one is galicia . 
  * galiza * is just a name invented by nationalist movements to sound different like castillian , but in galician it is the same term . 
  exactly the same term . 
  in other words , galicia in galician is called galicia . 
  galicia in english is called galicia . 
  galiza is only a term for people that want to sound different and stablish new borders . 
  you have borders with spain and cyprus within europe :d, 
  i really hate what gibraltar is . 
  i do n't mind if it 's spanish , british or serbian ... 
  but i hate it is just a tax haven in which lots of britons and spaniards enter to put they 're stolen money . 
  but , this being said , do you really think that is better than morocco ? 
  i believe everyone in spain loves portugal . 
  * ** country : ** kingdom of spain . 
  * ** best neighbour : ** republic of portugal . 
  * ** worst neighbour : ** kingdom of morocco . 
  by far . 
  you have n't borders with castillian spain :p, 
  the problem is i do n't see the positive points about these `` paramilitary tradition '' , but i see many negative ones ... 
  if you 're proud , that 's good for you . 
  but i 'm proud it 's illegal here . 
  really ? 
  some people here said you can . 
  if weapons are legal , the man that enters in the house has for sure a weapon , probably bigger and more eficient than mine . 
  and i would have to go to the place i have my weapon without being noticed by the alleged murderer or thief , so it 's quite difficult i could do anything with that . 
  in the other hand , i would n't be comfortable if everybody has a gun at home . 
  i 'm proud we do n't need weapons to solve our problems . 
  if texas governor declared independence unilaterally tomorrow ? 
  judiciary would judge him , washington would send us national guard to stop him and the army would be prepared if things get worse . 
  am i wrong ? 
  [ op\u00e1 , yo viaz\u00e9 un corr\u00e1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mkkc2f0gbq ) is another essential of our culture :d, 
  negative feelings ? 
  i believe there are some things of your political system i would change , but hey , it is not my country . 
  i 've been there , yes , couple of times : new york city and boston , massachussetts . 
  i simply noticed people are very fine with spanish speakers and europeans , so if you 're spaniard , they 'll like you for sure . 
  no , sorry . 
  i would love to go some places , such as ancient spanish missions in upper california and florida . 
  no , i like it in fact . 
  as a matter of fact , one of the leaders of the us independence , bernardo de g\u00e1lvez , was spaniard . 
  and half of the current territory of the us ( texas , florida , nevada , new mexico , montana , california , marianas , puerto rico ... ) was spanish a couple of centuries ago , so i 've known many people that tells this to me . 
  and i find it pretty cool and interesting , if you ask me . 
  it dependes on what you want to see . 
  i assume it is a cultural trip , not a beach-n ' - sun one . 
  if this is the case , i can tell you maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaany places in europe , such as lisbon , porto , london , bath , edimburg , prague , cologne ( man , that 's a cathedral ) , prague , budapest , vienna , brussels , rome ... you 'll have to travel several times :d but i 'll talk about spain , which is the place i know best . 
  just take a look to these cities : * [ santiago de compostela ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/santiago_de_compostela ) - [ obradoiro plaza ] ( http://caminosantiagoandalucia.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/la-coru%c3%b1a-santiago-de-compostela-catedral-obradoiro-05.jpg ) * [ barcelona ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barcelona ) - [ sagrada familia ] ( http://www.globo-rojo.com/wp-content/uploads/sagradafamilia00002482731jpg.jpg ) * [ c\u00e1ceres ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/c%c3%a1ceres,_spain ) - [ old medieval city ] ( http://turismoextremadura.com/viajar/shared/galerias/rrtt/monumentos/monumento_00003/img/a_casco_antiguo_caceres_14.jpg ) * [ granada ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/granada,_spain ) - [ alhambra ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/alhambra_l%c3%b6wenhof_mit_l%c3%b6wenbrunnen_2014.jpg ) * [ le\u00f3n ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/le%c3%b3n,_spain ) - [ cathedral of le\u00f3n ] ( http://turisleon.com/export/pics/catedrales/catedral-leon-catedral_de_santa_maria_catedral_de_leon.jpg ) * [ burgos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burgos ) - [ cathedral of burgos ] ( https://burgospedia1.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/burgos.jpg ) * [ madrid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madrid ) - [ museo del prado ] ( http://cdn.disfrutamadrid.com/guias/madrid/fotos/museo-prado.jpg ) and [ spanish royal palace ] ( http://www.residenciacardenalspinola.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/residencia-cardenal-spinola-palacio-real-madrid.jpg ), 
  man , li\u00e8ge is gorgeous ... 
  can you explain the entire process of elimination of the 2 ^ nd amendment , please ? 
  it sounds interesting . 
  here you have official translations of our constitution into different languages : * [ basque ] ( https://www.boe.es/legislacion/documentos/constitucioneuskera.pdf ) * [ catalan ] ( https://www.boe.es/legislacion/documentos/constitucioncatalan.pdf ) * [ galician ] ( https://www.boe.es/legislacion/documentos/constituciongallego.pdf ) * [ valencian ] ( https://www.boe.es/legislacion/documentos/constitucionvalenciano.pdf ) * [ english ] ( https://www.boe.es/legislacion/documentos/constitucioningles.pdf ) * [ french ] ( https://www.boe.es/legislacion/documentos/constitucionfrances.pdf ) * [ german ] ( https://www.boe.es/legislacion/documentos/constitucionaleman.pdf ) * [ italian ] ( https://www.boe.es/legislacion/documentos/constitucionitaliano.pdf ) as you can expect , catalan and valencian versions are exactly the same ( since they are the same language ) . 
  those are official translations by the state general administration ( * age * ) and published into the state official gazette ( * boe * ) . 
  except for occitan language in its gascon-aranese variety , it has been officially translated to every official language of our country . 
  but constitution can be amended .
