  we have a great problem with germany , which believes it 's the only important nation in the eu , and then we have another big country that is kind of blackmailing in the same way snp did a year ago : `` give us more power or we abandon this ! '', 
  not the way to be done , if you ask me . 
  who 's swallowing the uk ? 
  well , if you need a metro and you can afford it , why not ? 
  are you from the us ? 
  what would your supreme court do if texas declared unilaterally their independence ? 
  what would washington do ? 
  what would the army do ? 
  tell us , please . 
  i said this because somalia 's constitution is the only one in the world that recognises self-determination as a right in their constitution . 
  what scotland and quebec had was n't self-determination , but an ` ad hoc ' devolution from the central government , which is pretty different . 
  why do n't you stop saying stupid staff and begin to read the law you say you were going to break unilaterally ? 
  you put another flag just to say stupid comments under the spanish constitutional flag . 
  did n't dublin have a metro ? 
  portugal . 
  no doubt . 
  so ... you only respect somalia 's constitution ? 
  then it 's not a problem of madrid . 
  spain has 350 . 
  this is not the first time you show me you do n't know anything about our political system , so read wikipedia first . 
  thanks . 
  and ? 
  like in madrid city . 
  they wo n't take the government , so they did n't win although they were first . 
  i used a future , assuming you believe someday catalonian autonomous community will constitute as a non-fascist independent state . 
  in that case , i asked you if you would respect the new constitution . 
  against the will of people ? 
  i would say against the will of nationalists . 
  so , you 're not democrat , you do not respect law , you want to make your own law . 
  that 's autarchy , not democracy . 
  if that 's what you nationalist pretend to do with catalonia , i 'd surely flee . 
  you wo n't respect catalonian constitution ? 
  that 's nice to know , another reason to stop independence movement . 
  just with law , not with threats . 
  if we called a referendum for every single measure in every single village , we would be extinct since many centuries ago . 
  this is just racism and nacionalism in the disguise of democracy . 
  accodring to our electoral law : * ** madrid ** - 36 congressmen , 11 senators * ** catalonia ** - 47 congressmen , 23 senators so indeed madrid politicians are involved , but catalonia even more . 
  some people prefer to call it `` butifarr\u00e8ndum '' . 
  i would n't mind a referendum like canada-quebec or uk-scotland . 
  but for everyone that lives in catalonia and know what 's going on there , this is not what nationalists want . 
  they want a recognition of sovereignty * before * the referendum and calling it whenever they want until there is a ` yes ' . 
  that 's the reason why many people ca n't see it . 
  but anyways , they lost these elections , so it 's difficult there is something like canadian act of clarity in the near future . 
  i would support something like that , but not the referendum nationalists are asking for , which is pretty different of what you guys are thinking . 
  this is a lie . 
  man , now i 'm pretty hungry . 
  we should create a thread just for exchanging opinions about european food . 
  never been to the netherlands , i hope i can eat that cheese you guys are talking about :d, 
  well , at least you now ca n't deny you asked for spanish justice to interfere in the election process in order to give you a couple of seats . 
  i suppose that catalan justice in this hipothetical independent catalonia would do that every time there are elections . 
  if you 're nationalist , that 's a good point in favor of independence , that 's true . 
  well , i did n't made a comparison , i just said here we eat a lot of cheese and are not as tall as northern europeans . 
   you are saying that the judicial power has to act completely independently from the other powers , yet you are in favour of hidding an accusation in order not to alter an election . 
  exactly . 
  i want the judiciary of the legal systems that rules my life not to interfere in an election . 
  is that bad for you ? 
  why ? 
   and the word : victimism . 
  this word is becoming the new `` nationalism '' . 
   our democratically elected president has just been imputed for puting the urnes in the street . 
  * this democratically elected president was democratically elected because of the spanish laws . 
  * he is accused of overtaking public office and perverting the course of justice , among other delicts . 
  * if he 's not guilty , you do n't have to worry . 
  * if he 's guilty , why would you rage like this ? 
  he commited a delict , so he is going to pay for it . 
  or is it that these delicts would n't be prosecuted in an independent catalonia ? 
  ** note : ** it was the justice superior court of catalonia , not the spanish central government , who have begun the prosecution . 
  they did n't want to interfere in the elections . 
  you want a country in which political power uses judiciary in order to improve your electoral results . 
  that 's not democracy , thats totalitarism . 
  and totalitarism is , in my opinion , a direct consequence of nationalism , wether it is catalan , spanish , european , alaskan or croatian . 
  well , that could be your opinion . 
  i read many times qu ` ran and i 've been working and living with many muslims . 
  i believe the islam has some political connotations within its religious statements that other religions has n't . 
  and that is what , in my opinion , explains why islam is that mixed with politics nowadays . 
  qu ` ran is not a law book , but it has lots of statements made lake if it was such . 
  for instance , the punishment of apostasy . 
  this statement links political power to execute those punishments . 
  and that 's why i think it 's a religion with a huge relevance in politics . 
  but , as i said in later messages , islam is not the problem itself . 
  it 's just its essential characteristics made it vulnerable to politicians that just want to rule an amount of land . 
  and that 's why i 'm asking that islam must be tolerated , but we must also teach muslims those principles can not be practiced in european 21st century . 
  then jamaica should pay london for all those absolute improvements in their political , social and economic system thanks to the british empire . 
  you just told me you actually do want that , yes . 
  you wanted mas prosecuted a couple of days before the election in order to claim victimism and get a couple of seats for your nationalist wild orgy . 
  but , fortunately for democracy , judiciary waited until their acts could n't have any effect over a democratic election process . 
  as you see in that quote , it 's not judiciary . 
  next time , look in constitution or in any act or law instead of wikipedia . 
  constitutional justice is not judiciary according to political philosophy ( not in spanish system , i mean in every single system ) . 
  it is actually a complementary power for the legislature . 
  do n't let the word * court * confuse you . 
  yes , that 's why i 'm asking a referendum . 
  if they put a referendum , they 'll have the obligation to publish what this treaty is and its consequences . 
  so , you want the judiciary to move in favor of your political results during elections , is n't it ? 
  thanks for explaining us what nationalism is and which their means are . 
  so you wanted him to be prosecuted before the elections ? 
  this article is wrong . 
  judges can never be part of any political party . 
  there are many members of the constitutional court that are not judges , it 's not imperative , and thus , they can be freely affiliated to a political party . 
  remember that constitutional court is legislature , not judiciary .
