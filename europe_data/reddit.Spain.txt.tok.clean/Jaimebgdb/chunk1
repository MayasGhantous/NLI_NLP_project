it 's not only the culture shock , it 's that people get paid barely enough to survive and that 's enough for them . 
  moving to another country also bears a lot of risk ... spain is a great country to * live * in btw . 
  if it also was a great country to * work * in then it would be the best country in the world , but that 's probably france . 
  i find this picture hilarious . 
  to my fellow spaniards : if you 're offended , you have no sense of humor . 
   then the state should intervene not easy when the state is broke ( like spain or italy ) . 
  which areas are the first ones to get government funding cuts ? 
  anything that 's long term and does n't have an immediate effect . 
  that 's by the way why our education system is one of the worst ( if not the worst ) in europe . 
  that 's interesting !, 
  can you elaborate a bit ? 
  which territories in particular were involved ? 
  never heard of this reasoning , but i guess you have a point . 
  i mean , fatigue is a problem yes , but these fighters are designed for very high levels of maneuverability and their servicing intervals are very tight . 
  i do n't think that a couple evasion maneuvers will shorten the lifespan of the airframe considerably ... 
  but hey i may be wrong cause i 've only worked with civilian aircraft . 
  also during an intercept , there should n't be any sudden maneuvers on any side , i mean , that 's what 's expected in combat but not in an intercept ... 
  oh and by the way , this is something many military powers do : fighter jets will enter into the airspace of the other country to check whether they are detected or not . 
  once the other country intercepts them , they return back to their airspace . 
  this gives them a lot of information : response time , reaction etc. 
  it 's a way of proving that `` the system works just fine '' . 
  it 's the classical `` in and out '' game . 
  russians do it . 
  americans/nato does it . 
  it 's very normal ( just that when the russians do it they are called war criminals and when it 's the americans they do n't even tell us ), 
  just some island in the caribbean ? 
  we should have kept the whole of the american continent !, 
  oh you basques always fucking these maps up !, 
  haha, 
  the finnish word , `` lumi '' is slang for `` whore '' in spanish . 
  so i could imagine a funny misunderstanding involving a finn , a spaniard , some snow ( and whores too of course ) haha, 
  everyone else was doing it , so i also wanted our 5 minutes of fame xd west : [ el hierro ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lrpsgan.png ) east : [ menorca ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wncukrc.png ) fun fact : the 0-degree meridian ( prime meridian ) used to pass by el hierro !, 
  they even made a little [ short movie ] ( https://vimeo.com/75864971 ) about it !, 
  bonus map : [ empire !!!, 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/imperio_espa%c3%b1ol_completo.svg/2000px-imperio_espa%c3%b1ol_completo.svg.png ), 
  it 's not dangerous . 
  it 's unprofessional only if they were supposed to have it turned on and it was turned off by accident . 
  but if the transponder is off , it 's most likely not just by accident or coincidence , it 's done on purpose . 
  edit : why the downvotes people ? 
  i know what i 'm talking about, 
  hahahaha you might get away with it in front of the judge if you say you 're gay , and from 4 minorities and the policeman was giving you the eyes, 
  what are art-projects ? 
  unnecessary construction works funded by the government to employ people ? 
  we had that in spain under our labour party , it was called `` plan-e '' , complete waste of money . 
  it would have been better to hand the money to the people directly ... 
  not breakfast , come on !, 
  ^ ( and what the hell am i doing defending france to a frenchman , am i crazy or what ? ), 
  the uk does n't beat france in pretty much anything . 
  ^ ( maybe music and films ), 
  how do you call the german town of `` aachen '' . 
  in spanish it 's `` aquisgr\u00e1n '', 
  it 's the other way around friend , brazilians speak portuguese :d, 
  i imagine an english speaker trying to convince the policeman about that . 
  the guy will be like `` nice try , but yeah ... '', 
  never heard of that . 
  good im still learning my language ... , 
  but wait what has wine got to do with beer ? 
  it 's fermented drinks , so if `` ardoa '' meant `` fermented '' then it would make more sense i guess, 
  oh come on let me have my fun serious man ! ^ ( i thought i 'd come up with that joke myself ... ), 
  careful , you do n't want * that * debate again ... xd, 
  very neat , except the saving money for years part , come on it must be cheap for you !, 
  the canaries are cheap even for mainland spaniards, 
  indeed you do , usanians !, 
  hahahaha , the underlying reasons that once made us ( spain ) the greatest empire on earth are essentially the same ones that made us fall down to where we are at now, 
   luckily there is las palmas !, 
  hehehe , i wonder what the guy is saying !, 
  it means `` you ca n't be sure '' of whether or not it 's true . 
  haha yes . 
  in the eyes of the french , africa started south of the pyrenees . 
  no i meant , what we said regarding our spanish empire !, 
  always thinking everybody else is talking about * you * , france !, 
  ( joke ), 
  but it never actually gets `` completely '' dark like pitch-black , right ? 
  it 's like dark-blueish , the snow reflects some light and so on ? 
  and do n't get depressed , come to the canary islands during your winter instead !, 
  that or have another drink , hehe, 
  same thing happens in spain . 
  having children is good when you can provide for them and secure their future . 
  it 's bad when you ca n't . 
  i want to go to saint martin/sint marteen and see the air france and klm 747 's land pretty much on the beach . 
  should be fun . 
  so you could say that if i went to finland in the winter i could learn some basic finnish `` over-night '' , right , haha, 
  the reason is then that they do n't separate passenger flows like we do in , for example , madrid barajas . 
  i mean , the reason is `` technical '' but not `` legal '' in nature . 
  yes , the usa are kind of * special * to put it mildly when it comes to travelling in/out/through their country . 
  and you can be thankful if you have a eu passport like spain or france , they consider us friends . 
  i do n't want to imagine the ordeal it would be for a russian hehehe, 
  ah yes !, 
  regarding us customs and such , depends on the kind of flight . 
  if it 's just transit you should n't have to go through customs . 
  neither if it 's a technical stop ( refueling only , no change of aircraft ) . 
  but the us is always a big exception to the liberties of the air , or at least lately so after 9/11 and such ... 
  interesting , but i 'd like to see how that affects traffic on the streets that will remain open to cars . 
  also how it will affect life quality for the people living close to those jammed streets ( if they become jammed ) . 
  finally , having jammed streets is highly environmentally unfriendly . 
  what should i use in austria ? 
  not direct flights to the pacific . 
  but there are direct flights from france to the caribbean islands like saint martin . 
  that 's what we in spain used to say in the 16th century . 
  maternity leaves in russia are 2 years , if i remember correctly .
