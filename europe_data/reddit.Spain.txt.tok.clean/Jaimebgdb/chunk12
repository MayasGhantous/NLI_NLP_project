  what i said is regarding `` national police '' . 
  there 's `` local police '' ( they mostly issue parking tickets in the cities ) and then there 's the `` guardia civil '' which is a para-military sort of police ( they mostly issue speeding tickets on the highways ) . 
  that 's cool !, 
  very few people do that . 
  if i ever move abroad i 'll do the same . 
  i was raised in a catholic family , both on father 's and on mother 's side : i was baptized , made first communion etc. 
  my grandparents are ( were ) very religious and go ( went ) to church every sunday . 
  my parents are a little less devoted but still consider themselves firm believers . 
  my mother in particular likes to go to church sometimes and drags me with her ( i just go to please her and so as to avoid having an argument ) . 
  i on the other hand , and as a young adult , could n't care less about religion . 
  i do n't think it 's wrong though ( who am i to judge ) , i wo n't think badly of anyone who professes a religion , it 's just i do n't give a shit about it . 
  i might not like them shoving it onto my face constantly but then again i could say that of any topic ( like football , for instance , which i coincidentally also ignore completely ) . 
  when the time comes to get married , i can foresee a family argument over why i do n't want to marry in a church . 
  maybe i will go along with it just to avoid the arguments ( yeah , sue me ) . 
  in spain not popular really . 
  some irish pubs have them , but people are n't really any good at it , there 's no pool culture here . 
  i knew a pool hall in madrid , they had 10 or 12 tables and looked very cool , i really liked it as an afternoon `` chillaxing '' plan , problem was , it was rather expensive . 
  they had to close it down eventually ( probably lost money ) . 
  eben !, 
  less culinary variety than spain ( italians will disagree , of course , haha ), 
  i ca n't even conceive such a nightmare :d, 
  35h/week . 
  * that * is a decent schedule . 
  haha great question . 
  vegetarians have a problem just `` being '' in spain . 
  depends on the industry . 
  in my case as an engineer i work 8 to 17:30 h with an hour lunch break . 
  i do n't like it at all but from what i 've seen elsewhere i have even to be grateful ... 
  enjoy our food culture and restaurants . 
  spain is probably the country with best `` bang for your buck '' regarding restaurants . 
  sure there 's excellent restaurants in france , but for twice or thrice the price . 
  you mean like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqcswpfnjbu ) ? 
  do n't refuse eating `` jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico '' if a local offers it to you . 
  that 's a serious offence here . 
  ps : no it 's not just `` raw cured bacon '' . 
  just eat the damn thing and enjoy it , it 's delicious !, 
  do n't ever give money to anyone begging you for it . 
  interesting point of view , i 'd like to know what `` liberal '' means to you . 
  i guess i 'm also upper middle class ( whatever that means ) and i do n't consider myself leftist but i do n't really share your views . 
  i 've usually found , within my circles , that left leaning people are usually better conversators . 
  there 's no direct causality relation either so i do n't think it makes much sense to differentiate by political ideology when talking about an european sentiment , at least not in spain . 
  i also strongly disagree about art degrees not constituting an `` actual education '' ( and i studied engineering for the record ) . 
  yeah sure i can imagine . 
  i remember a time a group of close friends came over to my home for a party and i asked them to take the shoes off ... 
  they just gave me the eyes and then broke into laughter ... what other `` faux pas '' did you experience in spain ? 
  we are very similar in this regard then !, 
  i also feel `` isolated '' in my european-sentiment among my fellow friends , colleagues etc. 
  yeah , many brits feel more `` commonwealth-eners '' rather than europeans , right ? 
  i guess living on an island has a lot to do with it ? 
  that 's interesting , do you believe a european sentiment has to do with education and/or social class ? 
  yeah ... 
  the brexit thing saddened me deeply above all . 
  can i do ** russia ** ? 
  it 's just i happen to watch lots of russian films ( by accident ... ) - ** moscow does not believe in tears ** ( 1980 ) - ** brother ** ( 1997 ) - ** the irony of fate ** ( 1976 ), 
  i have n't seen many spanish films and i should watch all the classics from berlanga , almod\u00f3var etc. 
  anyway , from what i have seen : - ** los lunes al sol ** ( 2002 ) story about the closure of a shipyard in galicia and how it affects a group of friends who 've been laid-off . 
  - ** atraco a las tres ** ( 1962 ) a group of bank clerks plan on robbing the bank in revenge for their bank director having been laid-off by upper management . 
  - ** el d\u00eda de la bestia ** ( 1995 ) it 's a wtf movie . 
  i loved it , but non-spaniards will probably not get it , what we call `` espa\u00f1olada '' . 
  la grande bellezza ( 2013 ) is a modern classic . 
  great great movie . 
  i 'd say spain is very hospitable . 
  sometimes even annoyingly so . 
  ( nah , it 's something good about my country for once ) . 
  it 's like unwanted email subscriptions . 
  you * can * unsubscribe if you want , but it requires * your * effort and should be the other way around . 
  interesting , and yeah that sucks . 
  the whole concept of having to prove that you * do n't * have a tv/radio seems fraudulent in my eyes , in any case it should be them proving that you * do * have it . 
  thanks for the link !, 
  interesting , did n't know this . 
  what does a swede from a little town do when he gets a job in stockholm ? 
  they 'll have to rent a room ? 
  live in a commuter-town and travel every day 1 hour to work ? 
  yeah i always thought that german tv sucks . 
  what 's that tax you have to pay ? 
  the one for having a tv at home ? 
  but you 'll only pay the church-tax if you declare yourself as a christian , right ? 
  or how does it work ? . 
  what 's with it ? 
  or what 's there to it that is special in sweden over other housing markets elsewhere ? 
  the usual work-hours . 
  here it 's usually from 9 to 14h in the morning and then from 17 to 20h in the evening . 
  it 's 8 total work hours , but really it eats up your whole day and there 's no time left for doing anything . 
  also hours related , the usual times for lunch and dinner . 
  lunch at 15h or dinner at 22h is just too late . 
  it 's never about equality . 
  it 's about inequality in favor of women . 
  we went from a machist society under the franco dictatorship to a feminist society today . 
  there 's no middle-ground . 
  they * can * ask whatever they want . 
  they * should n't * ask those things . 
  in spain you do n't really know what to expect . 
  if it 's a shitty company with low-level hr personnel they will ask you everything that 's listed there . 
  how it goes in spain ? 
  with an unemployment of as high as 20 % , you 're basically the interviewers bitch , they can get away with whatever they want because if it 's not you there will be 100 others standing in the line behind you . 
  you arrive at the interview room , the interviewer starts asking questions he could have gotten the answer himself from reading the cv ( which they never read , of course ) , then they ask questions about your skills on things that they have no idea how to judge ( as in : do you know how to use solidedge ? 
  well i have n't used that one but i 'm an expert on catia and the transition should be very easy . 
  ah , i see , so you do n't know how to use solidedge then ? 
  ) , then they tell you they will inform you in one week of whether you 've been chosen or not , and then you never hear from them again . 
  political correctness is what i hate the most about my country .
