  spain 's leave is 3-4 months which , as you say , is a joke . 
  the problem with extending maternity leaves is that employers wo n't hire women because of the risk of them having a baby immediately thereafter and being absent for 1 or more years . 
  it 's a complex problem . 
  yeah , you explained it better , 
  because you probably do n't speak either of both . 
  if you spoke just a bit of spanish you 'd notice basque has absolutely nothing in common . 
  the only thing that might be similar is the `` rythm '' of speach , phonology etc , but nothing else other than that . 
  yeah , but you 're strawmaning my argument . 
  i do , i studied science . 
  the thing is that human relations are hardly a science whose truth can be determined absolutely . 
  i think there 's just not one real , absolute and scientific truth . 
  each individual/society makes up their own truths . 
  and the `` truths '' of others that do n't overlap our own views are labeled `` lies '' . 
  yeah i see your point . 
  the problem is then one of life-work balance in western economies . 
  one of having to choose , as a woman , between a career or children but not both . 
  in a country like denmark or sweden , yes , that could be te case ( do it for denmark !, 
  yeayy ! ), 
  in a country like spain or italy it 's mainly because they ca n't afford the kids . 
  yeah that 's true !, 
  the basque word is like `` what the fuck ? '', 
  but then again , the whole basque language is a big `` what the fuck '' on its own , completely unrelated to anything else haha . 
   so what 's the difference between the people of africa/middle east and italy ? 
  industrialization , religion and social culture . 
  russia has a different approach to family and having children than most western-european countries . 
  in russia many women marry in their early 20 's and have their first child by the age of 25 . 
  they know well that fertility dies off with age and that getting pregnant after 30 strains the body much more than when younger . 
  that would be unheard of in spain and italy ( or associated with lower classes ) , where most women have their first kid well past 30 years old nowadays . 
  how is it in estonia ? 
   `` if you want to create a society that invests in its future and has children , you have to make sure the underlying conditions are there , '' i agree with mr. renzi 's comment . 
  people * want * to have children . 
  if they do n't have them it 's because they ca n't allow themselves the * luxury * . 
  bringing a child to the world when ones own future is not secured yet is foolish and a reckless move . 
  the thing about chemtrails wo n't ever stop to amaze me ... 
  instead of trying to disprove it , because some people do n't listen to technical reason , i 'll just say `` look , do the rich and powerful walk on the same streets and breath the same air as you do ? 
  yes , right ? 
  then the chemtrail thing is not true '' and about climate change , i 've heard some other right-wingers acknowledge its existence , but stating there 's nothing really meaningful that can be done about it and hence should be ignored altogether . 
  well , at least they do n't deny it . 
  sounds like nice chaps to me ... not, 
  for an ignorant outsider , someone care to comment on how far right this afd actually is ? 
  and now that we 're at it , are there similarities/differences between afd and the sweden democrats ? 
  yes you are right . 
  while getting in the eu has an effect on the economy for sure , that does n't necessarilly reflect on the gdp graph because there 's many other factors ... 
  in any case , i was just noting the fact that after 2004 the growth rate grew . 
  i wasnt implying a strict cause-effect relation, 
  it 's a great graph , i 'm having fun with it . 
  i loaded spain on top of that and thought : wow , spain is rich . 
  then i loaded germany , `` huh , not so much '' . 
  then i loaded norway `` wow , germany is so poor '' . 
  then liechtenstein `` omg in liechtenstein if you 're norwegian you 're poor ! '', 
  to top it off , checked monaco and the scale got even [ bigger ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=region:ecs&amp;idim=country:pol:ukr:deu:nor:lie:usa:esp:mco:rus&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tdim=true&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) . 
  see how the polish curve got steeper after 2004 and entering the eu . 
  it 's like we studied economy from the same book ( francisco moch\u00f3n ) . 
  please share the source , i 'm eager to learn !, 
  and why are we talking about the ussr anyway ? 
  all i 'm saying is that in certain economies the gdp does not measure well-being or economic activity properly . 
  and comparing two different economies based solely on the gdp is not accurate , it does n't describe the picture properly . 
  good point . 
  not true but okay , i 'll buy it . 
  your point being what exactly ? 
  you ca n't put it into numbers easily . 
  you have to understand the idiosyncrasy of each country/system , that 's all . 
  it 's not a measure of production . 
  it 's a measure of market transaction , which is a different thing . 
  i fully agree . 
  the thing is that it 's difficult to * compare * because they are radically different systems . 
  i 'd like people to understand that . 
  to the ones that are using this as a proof that capitalism is `` superior '' to communism , i 'm not defending either of them , but you ca n't compare apples to oranges . 
  they just do n't sum up . 
  it does n't work that way . 
  you 're using a capitalistic unit of measurement to say that communism is bad , well of course it will under those glasses . 
  ( i 'm expecting downvotes , but whatever ), 
  they did n't experience a 1960 's tourism and construction boom . 
  without having the slightest idea about the military : did n't the whole operation look a bit uncoordinated , even chaotic ? 
  just my feeling as an outsider . 
  yeah , and ron perlam 's voice-overs in fallout intros never change either . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'll have to watch it . 
  `` just '' ... that 's pretty deep what you said . 
  if you 're saying based on the actual `` gore '' than yeah sure , you 're right . 
  it 's the whole situation that 's heavy . 
  not the blood itself . 
  that 's some heavy footage . 
  `` they have to fucking die '' `` do n't they deserve to die ? '', 
  `` yeah yeah , i do n't feel sorry for them '' war is a horrible thing ... ps : the youtube comment section of that video is disgusting ... 
  im reading the comments and feeling retarded . 
  whats going on ? 
  these things with borders are always fascinating . 
  like the large [ chunk of desert ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bir_tawil ) between egypt and sudan , of course an american had to claim it his . 
  yeah . 
  it 's called `` ad hominem '' phallacy . 
  that 's interesting . 
  there 's only ever one an-225 been made , with a second one left half-built . 
  i 'd expect the deal to be over the real workhorse which is the an-124 . 
  yes . 
  pp-voters are the most stable ones , they will go vote no-matter-what . 
  other voters are more volatile . 
  such an experience must be priceless !, 
  well not exactly : the price is being an eton-boy with connections to the son of a high-ranking russian official :d, 
  i can foresee what will happen next : in the second round , 11 abstentions will magically appear out of nowhere ( out of the labour party ) , enough so as to form a minority government and not having to go for 3rd elections .
