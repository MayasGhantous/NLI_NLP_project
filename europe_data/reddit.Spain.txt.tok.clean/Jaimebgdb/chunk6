  you took a very simple and easy thing ( pizza ) and made a fortune out of it ; we did n't know how to do that ... 
  i recently found out that there 's a movement in portugal for a spanish-portuguese union , like it 's a real thing . 
  in spain , the sad truth is that nobody gives a shit about portugal . 
  we are friends , yes , but there does n't seem to be much interest . 
  and i do n't know why honestly , it 's kinda sad ... 
  foro-what ? 
  what 's that ? 
  i do n't know what you 're talking about mate , leave me alone ! ... 
  [ a day in the life ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usnsceov4gm ), 
  yeah , the case with sweden is fun . 
  * technically * and on paper , it 's not that they do n't want to join , it 's that they do n't meet all the conditions to join the euro . 
  but if they * did * fulfill all the conditions they would * have * to join . 
  the condition they do n't fulfill ( of course , on purpose , not to adopt the euro ) is joining the european exchange rate mechanism erm-ii . 
  denmark does , so their currency is tied to the euro . 
  but all of a sudden we could buy german bmws and audis at a `` reasonable '' price !, 
  to sum up for spain : everything that used to cost 100 pesetas went on to cost 1 euro when it should have cost 60 cents . 
  they called it `` el redondeo del euro '' . 
  bad business for spain ... 
  haha , well ... 
  i think it 's fair to say that we all got what we deserved ... 
  yes of course , i beg your pardon !, 
  in spanish `` roman '' = `` romano '' and `` romanian '' = `` rumano '' , so the difference is just one letter and i confuse it sometimes, 
  most of america was a former spanish colony . 
  i feel pretty embarrassed , i mean spain could have been the most powerful and largest country on earth , but eeehhh , no . 
  western sahara : i think spain miserably abandoned these people , who were spanish citizens on their own right . 
  and this happened very recently in the 20th century . 
  philippines : i 've heard older people still speak some spanish over there . 
  well , you have the romanian empire , so that was kind of cool . 
  seems like every mayor european country had its moment in history ... 
  haha okay , so that means yes question : if it 's the hottest chick ever sitting next to you , would that still make you uncomfortable ? 
  it 's actually not uncommon at all having americans say , `` okay , i 'm going for 7 days to europe and i want to visit spain , france , germany , italy , austria , denmark and sweden , and maybe if there 's some time left i 'll visit saint petersburg . 
  so , tell me everything i should see ! '', 
  haha, 
  i heard that the number one rule of saunas is `` not even one drop of sweat on the wood '' , is this true ? 
  but were n't the swedes the only ones who are entitled to the seat they are sitting on , and the next 2 rows of surrounding seats in all directions , which are to remain strictly empty !, 
  `` brit angrily shouting at spaniard who was standing on the left on the metro stairs '' `` spaniard crying while he mumbles : pero si conduc\u00eds por la izquierda , qu\u00e9 pasa que me vuelvo loco '' next day the spaniard is seen driving on the right and causing a huge burnout-style car crash on the motorway xd, 
  no , you ca n't . 
  if they offer , that means you 're * de facto * fit for drinking xd, 
  entertainment value is the most important thing in a monarch . 
  i mean , it 's not like they can do anything really useful for the country and you ca n't get rid of them either , so you might as well have some fun out of them at least ... 
  my opinion is profoundly biased . 
  as an engineer and roads/infrastructure lover , i want this tunnel built !, 
  also i might be moving to hamburg in the future and this tunnel will be great for roadtrips to the nordic countries !, 
  i like how you imply that the other part of denmark is irrelevant , hahaha, 
  agreed on everything you said . 
  except i do n't think ukraine will be fit to join the eu in the next 5 years . 
  if anything turkey is closer to that ( or was closer to joining a few years ago , now they are kind of retreating ) 5 years is not a long time anyway . 
  the only `` big '' thing that will happen is uk leaving ... 
   the monarch used to be consulted/informed when a new government was in the process of being informed yeah but up to what point is n't that whole thing just a `` theater play '' , i mean , monarchies in europe are symbolic , nothing else ... 
  in spain the king also `` proposes '' the next president , and then congress has to vote and approve ( in fact , we are in the process of doing so right now and if we ca n't form a government soon there will be elections in spain , for the 3rd time already ) . 
  but the king always `` proposes '' the candidate of the party that won the election so it 's just like a symbolic act more than anything . 
  but it should be the other way around !, 
  i mean , you drive on the left , 
  what about bergman ? 
  i 've seen the movie idiocrazy , so yes . 
  seriously , that movie has a point . 
  it turns out to be a piece of shit after the first 15 minutes , but the idea underneath it is quite good !, 
  hehe , just an internet recurring joke . 
  i think it will be in late 2016 or early 2017 . 
  within the next 6-8 months, 
  for something * good * that [ montana ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tivamehnxm ) had , they had to take it away from them , oh boy ... hahaha, 
  hehe , now i know what you meant . 
  good to learn something new . 
   stuck behind one truck moving at 57 passing another moving at 54 happens in spain like all . 
  the . 
  time . 
  we have a 90km/h limit , so trucks set their speed limiters to 90 , but in reality there 's slight differences of maybe 0.5 km/h . 
  they overtake over these differences of course , and sometimes it takes minutes for them to complete it ... 
  sorry if i 'm derailing your thread , it 's just i 'm very interested in all traffic matters . 
  spain has a general freeway speed limit of 120 km/h . 
  some years ago you could go up to 140-150 pretty much no problem . 
  nowadays they are fining heavily from 130 . 
  some people ( like me ) have a gps with all speed-camera positions , but there 's still `` portable '' speed cameras mounted in unmarked police cars . 
  once you get the hang of it , it 's pretty easy to detect them . 
  so i 'll typically cruise across spain at 140-150 km/h ( 85-95 mph ), 
  this happens in spain too . 
  actually , now that you mention it i 'll tell you : the spanish language is * very * clear ( we have an official [ institution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/real_academia_espa%c3%b1ola ) that defines the spanish language , so there 's no doubts ever ) when it comes to referring to a group of people of both men and women . 
  in spain you say `` vosotros '' if within the group there 's * at least * one man but you say `` vosotras '' if it 's all women . 
  so when addressing a large group of people with men and women you say `` vosotros '' and that 's the way it is . 
  since feminists are complaining that this is a machist feature of our language , what are politicians doing lately to seem women-friendly ? 
  they say `` vosotras y vosotros '' ( female word first of course ) , which is wrong by the principle of the economy and efficiency of language . 
  and you hear this all the time , it 's ridiculous ... 
  there are more examples like this ... 
  okay , i did n't know this term . 
  i thought it was `` federation '' . 
  the canary islands used to have much more autonomy in the past . 
  now they are a `` comunidad auton\u00f3ma '' pretty much on the same level as the rest . 
  they do have special taxes and particularities , but so do they have it in `` navarra '' for instance . 
  i mean , the canary islands are proper spain , not an `` overseas territory '' like the french or british overseas territories . 
  but special territories do n't turn countries into federacies . 
  if that where the case all of europe would be federacies ... 
  so aland is finnish , but just `` a little '' , like the faroe islands are danish , but just `` a little '' and svalbard is norwegian , but just `` a little '' , hehehe ( well i think svalbard is more complicated than that ... ), 
   the 55 mph speed limit from the 70 's on a side note ... is that still a thing ? 
  do americans have to drive a dreadful 90 ( !!!! ), 
  km/h on the motorways ( or freeways i think you call them ) ? 
  that 's the speed for large transport trucks over [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvv3nn_de2k ) ... 
  bulgaria , because nato and eu . 
  if someone from the uk care to comment on this that happened to me : i went to a restaurant in london , i think it was the red lion next to westminster . 
  had a beer and a hamburguer . 
  the waitress , who 'd been rude overall up until then , took my beer when there still was some left in the glass , like 2oz or so .
