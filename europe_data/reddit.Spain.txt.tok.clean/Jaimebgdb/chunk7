  when she came back i said : `` excuse me , you took my glass with some beer still in it '' . 
  she just said , without looking at me `` oh , yeah '' and went away . 
  i mean , in spain this would be considered extremely rude and the waitress would have to give another full beer ( maybe in a smaller glass , ok ) to the client . 
  then when i asked for the check it came in a bill that had a * handwritten * `` service not included '' note on it . 
  i asked the waitress , `` excuse me , how much is customary to tip in london '' she just said `` 10 % '' . 
  some moments later i left the exact charged amount , then i just stood up and walked away thinking to myself `` fuck them , you ai n't getting any tips from me for such a service '' . 
  yeah , and the meal tastes always better if you 're not the one paying for it !, 
  as a tourist they were trying to squeeze you , naturally . 
  people please , a thread about tipping is not such without [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-qv9wvgb38 ) . 
  i would leave the 40 if the meal was 39.60 or so . 
  if it 's 37 i want my 3 euros back !!, 
  i worked for half an hour to earn those and nobody tipped me !, 
  and if the service is great and the restaurante really deserves it , up to 5 % tip is not uncommon . 
  that 's a difference between spain and france , yes , but not the only one . 
  france has a much stronger welfare state than spain . 
  families are offered way more support and are hence encouraged to have kids . 
  not so in spain ... 
   more than possible sorry , but i do n't buy it ... 
  okay , but do you believe that 3 million people can bump up the national fertility rate of a country of 66 million from 1.3 to 2.0 ? 
  not possible . 
  i fundamentally agree with you in that arabs have more children than white europeans , but the overall impact on the whole country is not that large , in my opinion . 
  well , not exactly , [ no ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_spain ) . 
  romania and morocco are the main countries of origin . 
  those two combined make over 3 times as much as brits + germans which are just a small fraction of the total ... 
  milton-keynes in the uk has a few of those ... haha, 
  i understand your russian point of view because russians are very protective of their families and will have married and gotten kids before 30 years old . 
  but the birth rate is not bumped up that high by immigrants , at least not exclusively . 
  think of spain , 14 % of population are immigrants , yet we have one of the lowest fertility rates at 1.3 . 
  france has around 10 % of immigrant population and a much higher fertility rate . 
  you misinterpreted . 
  that 's exactly what he said , 
  it 's a very interesting question and there are lots of factors involved . 
  - general economy of the country - political stability - economy of individuals - industrialization - religion - socio-cultural values - financial situation and future prospects of young adults ( the ones prone to having children ) - welfare state - women and their role in society - life-work balance there 's so much to it and i know so little that it 's daunting !, 
  edit : of course immigration is also a factor ... 
  i remember once i was on a boat with a spanish `` flag '' ( is that how you say it ? ) . 
  docking in the port there was a little scratch on a german boat nearby and the german guy was so visibly agitated . 
  not angry , he was polite and all but you could tell he was on the edge of a heart attack . 
  when he saw that our boat actually had german insurance he got so happy !, 
  like really , he was `` pfffiuuu , everything will be okay now '' . 
  if germans love anything that 's got ta be insurances . 
  no seriously , have you stopped to watch their tv adds ? 
  like 90 % of them are about insurances . 
  and also very rich cause i 've heard the helicopter ride is not precisely for free , hehehe . 
  ( 3000 $ or more ), 
  oh wow , so gore , i hope the guy is okay . 
  at least now he has an awesome story to tell ... 
  similar to the comment i made about germans and nordic people getting lost/dead walking the mountains of tenerife xd, 
  the feeding the bears thing is the `` disney syndrome '' , believing that cute and fluffy animals are nice . 
  they will eat you !, 
  even if there 's no speed limit , there 's still the rule of being able to stop the car within the field of sight , is this true ? 
  do swedes drink spirits ( like whisky ) when out in bars or is it just too expensive so they stick to beer ? 
  i 'm from tenerife , an island where every year a bunch of reckless germans either die falling off a cliff or get lost and have to be rescued by helicopter . 
  so if you 're german , you love wanderungen and visit teneriffa , be well prepared . 
  do n't think that just because the island is small there 's no risk . 
  agreed , they are geographically european if not politically or culturally , which is up for debate anyway . 
  funny some people say the swedes are cold people . 
  the few swedes i 've met were great fun !, 
  maybe this is anecdotal bias , or swedes who travel are more friendly than when at home . 
  agreed . 
  do n't run in front of a bull . 
  really , do n't do it , it 's embarrassing . 
  i 'd say 99 % of spaniards would walk on the bike lane . 
  if a biker yells at them they would yell back too , hahaha . . 
  yes . 
  do n't get me started with that horrible disgusting nesquick invention of the devil , haha, 
  yeah , russians love their smoked sausages , hehe, 
  do you guys drink kefir too ? 
  i 'd have the `` typical , classical '' english breakfast any time !, 
  my favourite british meal of all, 
  no seriously , your br\u00f6tchens and yogurts are heavenly !, 
  do you like weetabix ? 
  i think those are great !, 
  coffee and cigarette is best after lunch , not for breakfast hehe . 
  in andaluc\u00eda they have delicious `` molletes '' ( a type of bread , similar to a german br\u00f6tchen in concept ) . 
  with tomato and jam\u00f3n it 's just delicious . 
  here 's [ one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/juan_carlos_i_of_spain ) and here 's the [ other ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/felipe_vi_of_spain ) . 
  there are currently two individuals in spain who receive the distinction and treatment of king . 
  haha yeah . 
  and i love the voice of homer up to season 10 or 12 , the actor carlos revilla died and the one that came next was much worse . 
  funny enough , the simpsons to me are up to season 12 , from then on not worth it . 
  could these two things be related somehow ? 
  hmmm, 
  yeah , haha . 
  plus , he 's tall and handsome . 
  believe it or not that makes a lot for our `` branding '' abroad xd ^ ( my russian girlfriend `` awws '' every time she see 's him on tv ), 
  hey it 's kinda catchy !, 
  yeah that 's a great point . 
  uy no , of course not god forbid ... hahaha, 
  hehe , careful with using the words `` cure '' , `` reeducation '' and similar stuff when addressing differing points of view . 
  one might get the wrong [ impression ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_in_north_korea#reeducation_camps ), 
  in a parliamentary monarchy the people retain the sovereignty of the state and the monarch is subjected to the scrutiny of the parliaments and government . 
  in a constitutional monarchy it 's the monarch who 's sovereign , he just chooses to `` share '' the sovereignty with the people and may retain some control over government or parliament . 
  that 's the theory though . 
  in all practical cases it 's the same . 
  both forms of monarchies are ones in which the monarch is pretty much just a symbolic figure . 
  from what i see , denmark is a constitutional monarchy . 
  may spain have a more `` advanced '' form of government than denmark then ? 
  hehehe ( just a joke ), 
  the best form of government is a dictatorship in which the dictator is a nice fella !, 
  xd in all seriousness now , i 'm in spain which still is a monarchy ( our form of government is parliamentary monarchy , not to be confused with constitutional monarchy ) but the king ( or should i say , the multiple kings we have right now ) does n't have much real power since he 's subjected to the government ( executive ) and courts ( legislative ) .
