  - great roads and driving ( i love driving ) - cost of living is low - it 's part of spain and hence the eu with everything good that comes with it . 
  good luck my friend , wish you the best !, 
  and get rid of that inferiority complex if you have it !, 
   i would n't want to be one of those `` i am a white non-gypsy romanian , i am good , they are bad '' sorts of people you wo n't have to explain that . 
  really it 's up to you how well you integrate in society not up to everybody else . 
  do n't worry about that . 
  worry about making a good career first . 
  the country that offers you the best opportunities is also not coincidentally the country that * wants * you the most . 
  you should be fine in any of the countries you mention . 
  in my opinion you should n't choose based on which country will `` hate '' you the least but based on which country offers best career opportunities for you . 
  the bias against romanians is against gypsies , not `` white '' romanians . 
  with your attitude of working , integrating , learning the language etc. 
  you should be fine . 
  and about being gay , i 'd say pretty much every country in western-europe is okay with that . 
  btw : i would suggest spain because it 's a gay-friendly country and the language would be easy for you . 
  only problem here is the job market . 
  being an architect you 'll find a very hard time here ( the housing industry is pretty much dead after the burst of the 2008 construction bubble ) so i 'd advise you to look elsewhere . 
  i agree . 
  i mean , i would n't ban it but clearly warn people `` do at your own risk , a bull is * serious * stuff '' . 
  problem is drunk or high people pretending to be fit to run in front of a bull . 
  selbst schuld if something goes wrong . 
  the people get hurt , not the bulls . 
  there 's fatalaties every year . 
  yeah , sorry for bringing that up, 
  - people i know ( friends , family ... ) . 
  - the western developed world . 
  - rest of the world . 
  yeah , some people use that one too here in spain . 
  but then again mexicans and canadians are also `` norteamericanos '' . 
  that 's great . 
  fptp is a horrible , horrible system . 
  - social support of individuals . 
  family bonds . 
  - knowing how to savour life . 
  [ ray dalio ] ( http://www.economicprinciples.org/wp-content/uploads/ray_dalio__how_the_economic_machine_works__leveragings_and_deleveragings.pdf#page=241 ) agrees with me here . 
  we 're 37 on the [ world happiness index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_happiness_report ) . 
  if we 're that high it 's basically because of what i said . 
  you 're on `` forocoches '' very often ( that 's like the spanish 4chan , 4th forum in the world or so ) . 
  everytime there 's news about sweden people will say `` sweden yes '' or `` so tolerant ! '', 
  haha . 
  ( i guess not funny for you anymore , but whatever ), 
  that 's true !, 
  all nordic countries have similarities and differences , it 's kinda neat , like `` pick your choice '' . 
  just watched `` fucking amal '' , liked it ( except in real life the cool kid never notices the loser ) . 
  will watch `` lat den ratte komma in '' next . 
  and then the seventh seal . 
  that explains a lot of things ... hehehe, 
  nobody 's said yet that slavs can be told apart from a crowd by checking if they are [ squatting ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-8gswzqdbm ) or not ? 
  ( just adding a touch of humour ), 
  that sure is nice to hear , dear sir !, 
  it has no translation !, 
  that 's what i meant we have a better demonym in spanish , there 's not a decent one in english . 
  the `` de facto '' english demonym for citizen of the usa is simply `` american '' , but that 's just wrong . 
  someone once said `` spain is the toughest country in the world . 
  for 500 years they have been constantly trying to destroy themselves , yet they have n't managed to do so yet '' . 
  there 's a lot of truth to it . 
  haha , i say us-anians which is similar . 
  in spanish we have the demonym `` estadounidense '' , which is perfect . 
  the spanish language is just great . 
  sweden is actually a very interesting country and one that gets everybody talking , unlike the other nordic countries . 
  why is that ? 
  it might actually be the best one cause all others ... my goodness ... 
  any kubrick movie . 
  ( i consider them british movies ) christiane f. ( germany ) moscow does not believe in tears ( russia ) in the name of the father ( ireland-uk ) billy elliot ( uk ) la grande bellezza ( italy ) lawrence of arabia ( uk ) my fair lady ( uk ) millenium trilogy ( sweden ) perfume , story of a murdered ( germany ) the name of the rose ( italy , france , germany ), 
  and carpets in bathrooms . 
  that 's just disgusting . 
  same opinion here . 
  thanks a lot for that reference mate !, 
  yeah sure , and they also will charge you double in a bar ( tourist tax ) or the taxi driver will drive you around in circles . 
  but as of physical safety , spain is one of the safest countries on earth . 
  surprised of not seing anyone mentioning spaniards . 
  i guess we 're just loud and that 's it , but not particularly rude or violent . 
  as for spain 's opinion ... 
  it 's got ta be the brits in torremolinos or the germans in mallorca . 
  as long as you do [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-34zqjbg-vq ) , you 'll be fine . 
  it must somehow involve best korea . 
   yes girls go after boys sometimws :d oh wow i 'll have to go visit then :d . that 's something completely unheard of in spain , boys are supposed to do all the `` work '' . 
  it does n't exist per se but in madrid there 's the students that are from madrid and then the ones who come from elsewhere and live in a students residence . 
  these residences are sometimes like sects , they make pranks on freshmen , there 's ranks within them ( novatos vs. veteranos ) etc. 
  so i 'd say it somehow resembles the `` fraternity '' thing . 
  that 's funny about the usa and any left ideologies . 
  you can hear on their media things like `` leftists , radicals and terrorist supporters were demonstrating in favour of blablabla '' , it 's like `` what the fuck , you put leftists in the same group as terrorists ? 
  really ? '', 
  `` no freakin ' commie may ever step foot in this house and that 's for sure '', 
  i agree . 
  as for university education , there 's many professors who do have great knowledge on their subject . 
  it 's the actual `` knowledge transferring process '' that they fail miserably at . 
  they do n't know shit about teaching , pardon my french . 
  that 's a neo-liberal point of view . 
  i 'd rather have a good public education system but when the public system of your country is repeatedly fucked over and messed around with , it 's understandable that people grow up resenting it altogether . 
  i went to a semi-private german school in spain . 
  not that my school was perfect at all , but compared to it the spanish public school system is plain horrible . 
  we have a big problem with education in spain . 
  the whole system is completely fucked up , from kindergarten to university . 
  the spanish never * learn * anything . 
  they memorize like parrots , vomit all the information in the exam and then try to forget as much as possible as quickly as possible . 
  people will literally throw all of their books/notes away after the course has been passed . 
  there 's talks of removing `` philosophy '' from all common curricula . 
  not that the philosophy that 's taught here is any good ( basically consists in memorizing facts and dates ) , but i 'd like to think it encourages * some * people to continue investigating on their own ... 
  in my opinion it makes more sense our way !,
