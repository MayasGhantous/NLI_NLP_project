even santiago carrillo was concerned about this , and he [ expressly ordered ] ( http://elpais.com/diario/1977/04/16/espana/229989610_850215.html ) the constitutional flag to be displayed along the red flag in every act of the communist party . 
  too bad a lot of people did n't pay attention to him and choose to not use it / use other flags . 
  man , no !, 
  what we need to retake is the milanesado ... :p, 
  i went to vacation to the south tyrol/northern veneto a few years ago , and stayed in a [ very picturesque house ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rlg1gb7.jpg ) . 
  this house belonged to a 100 years old lady , and we learned that she was born in that same house ... in the austro-hungarian empire !, 
  he makes plenty of respectful and reasonable arguments :  * crisis is affecting all , but the spanish state has been shit from the 16th century .

  [ 6 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3mlo15/catalan_separatists_win_majority_in_regional/cvg1xhr ) i wonder why his discussions with us , uncivilized iberians , never lead anywhere ... 
   before doing such an analysis you would need to come up with a conceptual framework that explains how you expect nationality to possibly affect the probability of an individual to commit a crime . 
  not necessary , that 's the beauty ( and pourpose ! ), 
  of statistics !, 
  we can describe things ( even those that we can not explain ) and , more importantly , we can predict future occurrences of a phenomena . 
  for instance , we do n't really understand the mechanics of turbulent fluid flow , but we have statistical models that allow us to predict how different factors affect some turbulence-related phenomena . 
  in this case , the anova result would tell us if nationality is `` statistically relevant '' at a given confidence level ( usually 95 % ) . 
  however i agree on you that `` nationality can at best be used as a proxy for cultural background or sth similar '' , surely the administrative action of giving a passport to a person ca n't possibly suddenly change his tendency to crime !, 
  that 's a bit strange no ? 
  i mean , why not using ak-47s or something like that to enhance deniability ? 
  sending a message ? 
   it just seems highly illogical to me that nationality should be the deciding factor for our criminal energy . 
  no one is saying that ? 
  what i 'm saying , and i think we agree , is that there are several relevant prediction factors , and nationality , looking at the data , seems to be one of them . 
  an interesting study would be to perform an anova test adding all those factors you mention ( age , income , etc. ) . 
  if you 're not familiar with the concept , it boils down to ask , `` how much the variance of each factors explains the variance of the crime ? '' . 
  for instance x % of the variance in crime could be explained by income level , y % by nationality , etc. 
  sadly i ca n't do that since the anonymized microdata for these series is not public :(, 
  [ this is the breakdown by category ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rbk0yot.png ) . 
  as you can see the majority are condemned for `` other crimes '' in the `` torture and against moral integrity '' , which mainly encompasses domestic violence , police violence [ which seems unlikely , as cops are usually spaniards ] , and human trafficking/slavery . 
  if anyone else is interested in perusing the data , you just need to go [ here ] ( http://www.ine.es/jaxi/tabla.do?path=/t18/p466/a2014/l0/&amp;file=01011.px&amp;type=pcaxis&amp;l=0 ) and click `` consultar todo '' to get the table . 
   a study is still helpful to understand the factors that can lead to criminality . 
  i agree . 
   just having the percentage of crimes committed by people of a certain nationality or from a certain continent does n't really tell us anything . 
  unless you assume that having a certain nationality makes you inherently more likely to become a criminal . 
  what the [ statistic ] ( http://www.ine.es/jaxi/tabla.do?path=/t18/p466/a2014/l0/&amp;file=01011.px&amp;type=pcaxis&amp;l=0 ) says is that certain nationalities are over-represented in the criminal record considering their population . 
  furthermore , the data is broken down into types of crimes , and this is very important info when looking for suspects , etc. 
  for instance : * 91.6 % percent of `` electrical frauds '' ( connecting illegally to the grid or tampering with the counter ) are committed by spaniards . 
  * 91.7 % of `` family abandonment '' is committed by spaniards however : * 65 % percent of homicides are committed by people of spanish nationality * ** only 15.1 % of `` credit card falsifications '' in spain are committed by spaniards . 
  ** so , if your credit card gets duplicated in spain chances are that the responsible is a person with a foreign nationality . 
  i think this is useful data , but you 're free to disagree , of course . 
  have you by chance read the first chapter of stephan zweig 's * the world of yesterday * ? 
  it describes his youth in pre-wwi vienna . 
  the `` safe , peaceful europe '' vibe is terrifyingly similar to today 's :  `` when i attempt to find a simple formula for the period in which i grew up , prior to the first world war , i hope that i convey its fullness by calling it the golden age of security . '', 
  publish a study ? 
  both nationality of those judicially convicted [ * [ condenados en sentencia firme seg\u00fan nacionalidad ] ( http://www.ine.es/jaxi/tabla.do?path=/t18/p466/a2014/l0/&amp;file=01001.px&amp;type=pcaxis&amp;l=0 ) * ] and resident population in spain by nationality [ * [ poblaci\u00f3n residente en espa\u00f1a seg\u00fan nacionalidad ] ( http://www.ine.es/jaxit3/tabla.htm?t=9674 ) * ] are publicly available data series in the spanish national institute of statistics [ ine ] . 
  you just have to download both and divide them in excel to get the % of convicted people among the population of each nationality . 
  [ here 's a quick chart grouped for major regions ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fp0sain.png ) . 
  my point is , there is no need for debating anecdotal evidences and newspaper stories , we have a modern judiciary , demographic , and statistical system which records and publishes the necessary data , and we can look ourselves into it without the need for journalists or reporters or tv presenters . 
  that 's the meaning of open data and transparency !, 
  welcome to the future , 
  spotted the shur !, 
  what makes a man turn neutral ... 
  lust for gold ? 
  power ? 
  or is it all that radioactive radon ? 
  sorry , maybe i 'm not in my right mind indeed !, 
  so to sum up , on the negative side , there 's no data that allows us to affirm that austerity and deprivation are somewhat correlated . 
  but on the plus side , you consider spain and norway not so different economies and societies . 
  yay !, 
  first of all , that last sentence was obviously a joke , specifically an hyperbole . 
  i 'm sorry if internet does n't always conveys humor in the right way :( as for the cherry picking , i do n't know why you seem to think that austerity analysis can only be applied to western european nations . 
  do n't eastern european and baltic nations ( and others around the world ) have budget balancing policies and material deprivation , thus being valid data points if we look for a correlation between the two ? 
   who in their right mind tries to measure austerity through a change in gross budget deficit aside from suggesting that i 'm not in my right mind , i would have sincerely appreciated if you had suggested instead an alternative numerical indicator of austerity . 
  i just took the definition of wikipedia :  in economics , austerity is a set of policies with the aim of reducing government budget deficits . 
  and assumed ( gross simplification , i know ) deficit variation as a result of the pro- or anti-austerity stance of the country . 
  i find it difficult to test if austerity is indeed correlated with progressing material deprivation or not if we do n't agree on what austerity is ( maybe i 'll find time to perform a detrending or a sarima model fitting as well , but that 's another story ! ), 
  or what a good quantitative indicator is . 
  for the correlation , i said that they do n't pretend to be scientifically sounding , but i find curious that you did n't mention cyclical or causal issues about the date range when you computed those deprivation change percentages and used them to say , and i quote '' ** this ** [ 2004-2014 percentages ] ** does n't seem like a vindication of austerity ** '' . 
  why would you say that if those percentages are unusable to test for austerity effect ? 
  as for the low r ^ 2 values , consider that in social science , it is very common to have < 50 % values . 
  this does n't mean that the correlation is automatically invalid or unusable , this just means that the prediction power is low . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics/how-to-interpret-a-regression-model-with-low-r-squared-and-low-p-values ) an interesting discussion on that . 
  anyway , to sum up since the general tone of your last response looks a bit confrontational ( complete mess , in my right mind , how can i even claim , etc. 
  ) , what i tried to do is to statistically test if we can find a correlation between a quantifiable estimator of deprivation and a quantifiable estimator of austerity , because i rather not discuss about something without data . 
  sorry if my crude attempt has bothered you , i look forward to try again if you have any suggestion , but if you 're not interested , have a very * buona serata * !, 
   this does n't seem like a vindication of austerity ah , i see that you like to cherrypick . 
  ok , no problem . 
  let 's try to correlate those percentages with `` austerity '' . 
  i 've made two correlations : one as `` austerity '' meaning no budget deficit and one with `` austerity '' meaning `` variation in budget deficit '' . 
  [ as you can see ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4hgutva.png ) , the percentages you 've posted do n't seem to correlate with change in budget deficit , at all . 
  but what about deficit itself in 2013 or 2014 ? 
  is it a good indicator ? 
  [ it 's a bit better ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8xdpu55.png ) , but not good . 
  if we remove the outliers ( norway and greece ) it 's even [ a bit better ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qrfgiqk.png ) . 
  but oh hey , seems to indicate that countries with less deficit have less material deprivation !, 
  so while i do n't think budget balancing serves as a reliable global predictor of deprivation ( instead i think they depend more on internal welfare policies , economy strength and social particularities of each country ) it still seems that not spending more than you what earn ( austerity ) is related to less deprivation . 
  it seems to me that a country with a sanitized balance sheet will have more chances to afford better welfare . 
  but maybe , as varoufakis says , i 'm one of those lizard mans waging an undercover class war against the workers of the word ? 
  i appreciate the data from uk , but have you tried the same exercise with latvia , lithuania , china , singapur , korea , slovakia , etc. ? 
  at a quick eurostat glance , i can see that [ % of severely materially deprived population ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=t2020_53&amp;plugin=1 ) between 2005 and 2014 has changed from 39 to 19 % in latvia , 34 to 10 % in poland , etc. 
  yes , uk has gone from 5 to 7 % , but taking the eu27 countries the % went from 10.8 to 9.6 % . 
  so yes , i agree that the situation has worsened in some countries . 
  but it has also tremendously improved in others , and the resulting net average in the eu is even slightly positive . 
  and that 's not taking into account the great improvement in several third world and developing countries outside europe !, 
  as i know that you 're a cultured and resourceful guy , i 'm pretty sure you 're aware of the [ tremendous reduction in world poverty ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hq7nsja.jpg ) that these two last centuries ( specially since the 1980s ) have seen . 
  fair enough , 
   it 's the gap is widening and is therefore more difficult to surmount i 'm curious , your ideal end-game is that of same salary for everyone ?
