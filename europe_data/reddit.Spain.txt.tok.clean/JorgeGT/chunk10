  for if it 's wrong to prevent a person leaving , why is it not equally wrong to prevent that same person from arriving ? 
  for the same reason it is wrong for me to imprison someone in my basement against his will , yet totally right for me to refuse free entry into my house to a random stranger . 
  seriously , who writes these things ? 
  it is active now . 
  `` brussels explosions '' . 
  [ reuters source ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/idusfwn16u06v ) . 
  actually , [ the house ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rlg1gb7.jpg ) where i stayed belongs to a ( then ) 100 years old woman . 
  she was born in that house ... a citizen of the austro-hungarian empire !, 
  it really felt like austria in many places , where many signs were in german and all the people 's names were germanic . 
  of course * you * would say that , mr. rhodes . 
  also i was a few years ago in veneto/south tyrol and liked it a lot !, 
  very interesting small places with a lot of history . 
  there 's in fact a black got banner hanging from one of the doors in the picture !, 
  yep ( it is mentioned in the articles i linked ) that 's why the problem is political : the police has the means to control the place if they are given the order . 
  sadly this solves exactly nothing without further measures such as deportations and prosecution of the drug lords and rehousing and extensive rehabilitation programs for the drug users . 
  wo n't you happen to have an english version ? 
  it is often not just a matter of under funding but lack of political will to withstand the riots that would form if serious police action would happen . 
  politicians prefer to preserve some kind of status quo where crime is contained in a well defined area , instead of having riots and crime spreading over the rest of the town . 
  a good example of this here in spain is the shanty town of ca\u00f1ada real , the biggest open air drug supermarket in europe . 
  see [ this article in the independent ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/in-spains-heart-a-slum-to-shame-europe-6268652.html ) or [ this article by the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/16/drug-clans-shanty-town-madrid ) , which are both spot on in naming politicians as the culprits . 
  they are mandatory in new coach cars since 2007 . 
  looking at the [ website ] ( http://www.autocaresalejandro.com/galeria ) of the company looks like at least one of them [ has seatbelts ] ( http://i.imgur.com/i9owryy.jpg ) . 
  that they were using them , is another story ... 
  this is so terrible ... 
  i have read in spanish media that the bus was slowly drifting until it touched the right hand side of the road until it touched the guard rail , and then it made a hard turn to the left , tipping over and crossing onto the other side of the road . 
  the driver has survived and flawlessly passed drugs and alcohol tests . 
  the resting times were apparently respected as well . 
  for what is worth , latest updates by jordi jan\u00e9 , head of interior ( security/police ) of catalonia have reduced the victims to 13 . 
  if you understand spanish there 's a live feed [ here ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2016/03/20/actualidad/1458470962_622312.html ) . 
  the number for family inquiries is +34900400012 . 
  nowadays the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite ( viirs ) on board suomi national polar partnership satellite flown by nasa and noaa . 
  you can access [ here ] ( http://ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/viirs/download_ut_mos.html ) to the nightly dataset . 
  [ that was done by nasa ] ( http://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/79000/79793/city_lights_africa_8k.jpg ) , they know how it is :p, 
  [ here ] ( http://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/78000/78674/london_lights_2012087_lrg.jpg ) , 
  sadly this is not a real image . 
  it uses [ earth at night 2012 ] ( http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=55167 ) well known [ composite map ] ( http://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/79000/79765/dnb_land_ocean_ice.2012.3600x1800.jpg ) over existing imaginery . 
  the full res version is available [ here ] ( http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/naturalhazards/view.php?id=79793 ) ( someone cropped it and added the lens flare ) :  this new image of europe , africa , and the middle east at night is a composite assembled from data acquired by the suomi npp satellite in april and october 2012 . 
  the new data was mapped over existing blue marble imagery of earth to provide a realistic view of the planet . 
  if you are interested you can browse this dataset in high resolution [ here ] ( https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/?map=-24.484375,14.05078125,50.75,62.14453125&amp;products=baselayers.viirs_citylights_2012~overlays.sedac_bound&amp;switch=geographic ) in a goole maps-style viewer . 
  try to find your town !, 
  :d if anyone is * further * interested , daily ( well , nightly , hehe ! ), 
  images from the suomi npp satellite are freely available [ here ] ( http://ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/viirs/download_ut_mos.html ) . 
  probably !, 
  i would say that the black patch in the center crossed by an avenue is the tiergarten and the round one to the left is the old tempelhof airport , for instance . 
  i grew in that era !, 
  but nowadays with smartphones and data plans i thought i should warn like in the old days :p, 
  [ this one ? 
  ] ( http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/databaseimages/esc/large/iss035/iss035-e-17210.jpg ), 
  i love these hand-taken images , they have a very different feel compared to satellite imaginery . 
  if anyone else is interested , the rest of photos taken from the iss and older shuttle missions can be browsed [ here ] ( http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/searchphotos/ ) . 
  it includes a map where you can draw a box around your point of interest . 
  also [ here ] ( http://issearthserv.jsc.nasa.gov/lunaserv.html ) there 's a different map interface that may be useful .

  ( warning : big images ), 
  `` we could have met the claimed specs with a quick software patch but we preferred to risk billions in damages/fines/bad pr instead . '', 
  i guess similar to a minister of the uk talking about the malvinas islands . 
  this . 
  auctioning the rights to execute arbitrary code from your page to the highest bidder is absolutely crazy . 
  people often does n't realize that adblockers work this way , just denying calls to known ad network domains . 
  if a website manually displays a text/image banner from its own domain , does n't usually gets blocked . 
  of course , that requires the website to deal with clients , whereas it is much more easier to just leave a javascript that lets a third party auction off a chunk of your page and reap the profits . 
  i remember that reddit post about forbes blocking people , i went to forbes to see if it blocked me too and it did . 
  i was just about to disable ublock but suddenly changed opinion and closed the tab . 
  then i read how people were being infected and that cemented my decision to use adblock everywhere networked third-party ads are served . 
  no website is worthy the risk of my machine being compromised by some malicious ad broker . 
  if a website serves ads the old way ( they contract them with the client , the client hands to the site the text/graphic and the admins manually serve it ) at least there is some kind of accountability . 
  nowadays admins just leave open windows in their page and those open windows are assigned to the highest bidder , who gets to put there their code . 
  most of the time is `` harmless '' but sometimes rogue attackers manage to infect thousands of machines like this . 
  [ graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0xicjpq.png ) for the lazy . 
  it used to be very popular in spain ( eta ) but i agree that it is very rare nowadays . 
  however in spain there was [ a very weird case ] ( http://www.europapress.es/nacional/noticia-seis-detenidos-operacion-contra-proxenetas-pugnaban-ocupar-lugar-dejado-cabeza-cerdo-20150129081759.html ) last year where a criminal gang wanted to kill a rival mobster with an explosive rc car . 
  however , the rc car exploded inside the car of the would-be assassin during transport , almost killing him . 
   with that special brand of british arrogance towards the continent . 
  i always though that he does this as part of his tv persona , in a comedic , tongue-in-cheek way . 
  when they go full rule britannia there 's always a counterpoint of funny self-deprecation , like in that [ epic ending on top of dover cliffs ] ( https://vimeo.com/68034189 ) where the e-type fails to start at the end . 
  i think that nothing says `` we 're really friends '' like being able to mock each other in a friendly way , \u00e0 la polandball , 
  i think it looks amazing overall . 
  modern and clean . 
  the only change i dislike is that the header ` < div  ` looks a bit `` sparse '' with the solid blue and monochrome alien ( although i support the design decision of removing the semitransparent map because the view port is too small for a `` meaningful '' map ) . 
  but of course as with all aesthetic judgments this is just my opinion !, 
  congrats / u/robbit42 and / u/tonyquark !, 
  this is correct , and usual practice in modern historical artifact reconstruction : [ see ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/classconnection/146/flashcards/1151146/png/warrior_vase_mycenae1335746538983-14b6ca95898640a237b.png ) [ some ] ( https://heritageofjapan.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/image1.jpg ) [ examples ] ( http://archaeology.jp/sites/2005/magome2s.jpg ) . 
  this allows the viewer to appreciate the original form of the object but explicitly showing what exactly is remaining without the need to fake the rest . 
  as a viewer i appreciate when reconstructions are honest like this . 
  a lot of times i have seen something impressive only to be disappointed afterwards when i realize at which degree it was a modernly reconstructed . 
  i saw the last one but this is much later :(, 
  wow , welcome !, 
  i hope you 're having a great time in here !, 
  the situation in spain towards open data / open government has improved a lot in the last few years . 
  we have now ( finally ! ), 
  and [ open data portal ] ( http://datos.gob.es/ ) , but it is not very organized ( more like , hey random agency , dump your data here ! ) . 
  we have also a transparency law now and associated [ portal ] ( http://transparencia.gob.es/ ) , so figures about public contracts , salaries , budgets , etc. 
  are appearing , often making the news . 
  individual portals for each agency , regional government and municipalities are a bit better , in the sense that their data is consistent and organized . 
  however it is still hard to compare data from different bodies since there are not mandated standards ( for instance an agency will lump age in groups of 5 years , other in 10 from 16 onward , etc. 
  so you ca n't compare one-on-one . 
  the same with gis data , etc. ) . 
  furthermore , there has been a great effort with e-administration , so you can now perform a lot of administrative procedures from home , with an id code or a cryptographic certificate/card . 
  also the administration is now obligated to not ask you for redundant information , so if agency a has your birth certificate or whatever , agency b has to ask them instead of asking you again for a physical copy . 
  lastly , ministries and scientific institutions are also opening up their data ( [ gis ] ( http://centrodedescargas.cnig.es/centrodescargas/index.jsp ) , [ statistics ] ( http://www.ine.es ) , etc. ),
