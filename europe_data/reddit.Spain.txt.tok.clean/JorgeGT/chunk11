  to the public free of charge , something that was unimaginable a few years ago . 
  in summary , i would say that while we started from a very bad position , the open government is accumulating momentum in spain , disorganized still but the will is there , and that 's what 's important . 
  as for resources , i 'm afraid that that 's the worst part . 
  if you are interested in a particular dataset , you can try datos.gob.es but sadly you will probably you will need to : figure out what the responsible institution ( s ? ), 
  is ( are ? ), 
   look up the open data portal of said particular institution ( s )  learn how to acquire and understand dataset . 
  also , the granularity of said dataset will probably depend on the level of government . 
  for instance if you are interested in accessing traffic data / cameras at a national level , the direcci\u00f3n general de tr\u00e1fico will offer you data for national roads , the municipality of madrid for madrid city proper , etc. , without a single aggregator for all data . 
  and that 's all i can think of right now !, 
  ask me if you have something specific in mind , but for now off to eat lunch , spanish time !, 
   edit : see [ this map ] ( http://mapa.datos.gob.es/ ) for a tentative list of spanish open data resources . 
  first of all , thanks for explaining all that !, 
  while i think it is an interesting approach , i lean to the side of open data , open government and data transparency . 
  for a long time governments have followed a `` trust us , you ca n't see the data but we 're doing good things ! '', 
  approach . 
  i prefer myself the `` ok , you 're an adult taxpayer , here is the data so you can assess by yourself how good we 're really doing '' philosophy . 
  of course , there are pro and against arguments against both approaches !, 
  i think it is a very important issue to be discussed in our time , open government and the dissemination of open data vs. the need for individual privacy in an increasingly surveillance environment . 
  but what if for instance there is prejudice against an ethnic group , how can you detect this and form policies against it ? 
  say that * even accounting for socioeconomic background * , [ ethnic group a ] is indeed underrepresented in higher education at a statistically significant level . 
  you will never be able to detect this if you do n't collect the data , and if you are not able to detect it , surely you wo n't do something about it . 
  thanks !, 
  anyone knows if sweden statistical office offers data on the nationality/country of birth of convicted persons ? 
  in spain [ they are available ] ( http://www.ine.es/dynt3/inebase/index.htm?type=pcaxis&amp;file=pcaxis&amp;path=%2ft18%2fp466%2f%2fa2014 ) , but for instance i think eurostat [ only reports a binary variable ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-datasets/-/crim_just_ctz ) ( foreign nationality vs. nationals ) and only for some countries .

   the other powers referred to the spanish as the black legend please , read the first paragraph of the wikipedia entry / u/leberechtreinhold linked to you . 
  the `` black legend '' term was coined in modern times ( 1914 ) by historian juli\u00e1n juder\u00edas y loyot . 
  it is a denomination of a style of nonobjective historical writing or propaganda . 
  tl ; dr : `` black legend '' is a modern pejorative term for anti-spanish propaganda , not an historical pejorative term against spain itself .

  woha . 
  apparently they also have [ a video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rt12wh4a92w ) starring a general with scary soul-piercing eyes . 
  fair point !, 
  but apparently in this case the culprit is ~ ~ bhutan ~ ~ mongolia according to / u/contec . 
  and what is the other one that allows germany and sweden but not us ?!, 
  well , i would advise you that no matter how stubborn people is , name calling wo n't improve your relationship with them . 
  as for the age old debate of os vs proprietary , i could offer you some counterpoints that i 've encountered during my phd research , such as some software being certified to interface with a veryexpensivemachine x and some other home-grown os being not , thus voiding the warranty of the machine . 
  or having a random maintainer pushing a package update to the pypi that utterly breaks compatibility and corrupts a few gb of experimental data - i can pick up the phone and get a mathworks support engineer , yet i ca n't pick up the phone and talk to +10 package maintainers that have engaged in a small war over package dependencies . 
  or a guy cross-compiling several os libraries in his computer that mysteriously ca n't be run in any other computer known to man , and after a few package update they only work when jupiter is above the horizon . 
   and what better way to learn and understand a script than to translate it to an other language ? 
  this , however , i agree completely !, 
  also , the idea of using os software * and hardware * for research is commendable , provided the particular application is indeed suitable for it . 
  ah , you make very fair and accurate points . 
  i should have said that i was referring to * anonymous * website polls where no data is available to the researcher in order to construct a representative population sample . 
  that omission was my mistake . 
  in the case of panel polls where a panelist discloses his information allowing weighted extrapolation to the general population as in your example , they are perfectly fine . 
  in the case of anonymous online polls however i stand by my previous statements . 
  and yes , i totally agree with your final statement that for crime , proactive personal surveys are a very good tool to offset the problem of wildly different criminal legislations . 
  note that regardless of question quality and number of data entries , polls conducted in a website are by definition affected by a strong self-selection bias . 
  the number of responses has an effect on the confidence internal of the results [ edit : see / u/tinyp good numerical example [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/48fo9o/european_crime_index_20122016/d0j91u0 ) ] , but does n't diminishes sampling bias . 
  while surveys are in general a valid statistical research tool , it is required for them to be useful that a strong effort is made by the researchers to reach a truly representative sample of the population . 
  this means young and elderly , internet and telephone users ( and those who use neither ) , rich and poor , city and village-dwellers , employed and unemployed , etc. 
  well , i think that qualifying some of your colleagues of research as `` fanboys '' sounds demeaning and insulting . 
  i use both linux and windows , both matlab and python and both latex and office . 
  as an engineer ( no idea why you are remarking that fact ? 
  ) , opting for closed source software in occasions is not a matter of fanboyism or thinking `` expensive = good '' , but a rational decision taken after a careful exercise of cost-benefit analysis . 
  os is not free , the work hours you spend reimplementing things and getting used to it have a cost , and sometimes is much higher than a license fee . 
  for some things open source software is vastly superior ( latex imho ) and for others vastly inferior ( simulink alternatives , mathematica alternatives , matlab hardware-interfacing toolboxes imho ) , nothing is automatically better because it is os . 
  that said , i 'm a huge proponent of open source in tax-funded research . 
  not only in software , mind you , but also in * hardware * . 
  i have had moderate success in convincing management to substitute expensive data acquisition and control systems for inexpensive and versatile arduinos , for example . 
  that 's why i beg you to not use terms like `` windows fanboys ( engineers ) '' because it sounds disrespectful and diminishes our position , 
  what has matlab to do with windows ? 
  and maybe both are right . 
  we can be several sovereign countries or we can be one sovereign federal country . 
  what we ca n't do is stay in this limbo where we are sovereign for some things and dependent on an unreachable consensus for some others . 
  many people ( seculars , lgtbs , etc. ), 
  emigrated fleeing from other , less tolerant people in their home country . 
  they are n't thrilled to see them joining the neighborhood where they thought they were safe and where they rebuilt their lives . 
  yes , because the fcc , faa , fda etc. , are very lax on regulations and not bureaucratic at all .

  medpacks are much older that switzerland . 
  in fact , they have been positively identified in brightly colored frescoes unearthed from the remains of pompeii , protected from the decay of time by the vesuvius volcanic ash . 
  i do n't know about italy , but young researchers in spain ( source : i am one ) are leaving not because `` there are n't any institutions which are up to standards '' but because they do n't offer us jobs . 
  i would really like my research to benefit my country , even if it means 1/2 or 1/3 of the salary i would have in germany or uk , but there are simply no open positions . 
  how is that mod discussion about what constitutes local news or not going on ?

   just out of curiosity , how much had to change in order to allow greenland to leave the eu ? 
  a [ special treaty ] ( http://www.lexnet.dk/law/download/treaties/gre-1985.pdf ) had to be agreed and signed between all members to modify the european treaties to erase the provisions that mentioned greenland . 
  also fishing rights had to be agreed , etc. 
   i 'm wondering , because the uk could technically empower scotland to carry out all obligations to the eu for its territory technically , not . 
  to do that legally the uk would have to design scotland as its successor state , with all the perks that they have ( that sweet , sweet veto on the security council ! ) . 
  in the case that a partial eu-only succession was somehow possible ( again , no , it would require a custom treaty ) , how could scotland carry out all the uk obligations ? 
  how would they pay the full amount of the uk share of the eu budget ? 
  hint : they ca n't . 
  should they secede , a new full admission treaty ( like the one i linked for croatia ) should be unanimously agreed and signed by * all * members . 
  this treaty would detail all the ( realistic ) obligations that the new member would have , their share on the institutions , the exact amount of money that they should contribute , etc.
