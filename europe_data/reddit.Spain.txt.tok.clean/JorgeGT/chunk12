  not only a seceded state would not be listed on the [ article 52 of the teu ] ( http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-european-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/139-article-52.html ) , but if they were to enter the eu , several other changes should be made such as : * creating an additional seat on the commission * modifying the structure of the eu parliament * shifting the weights of each member when voting acts of the european council and of the council requiring a qualified majority * reallocating members of the economic and social committee , the committee of the regions , etc. 
  * adding a chair to the board of directors of the european investment bank * defining the share of the new member to said bank and the rest of its financial obligations ( much more if they would like to be in the eurozone ) * redefining eu agricultural quotas to account for the new member * defining the amounts from the structural and cohesion funds , the european fisheries fund , the european agricultural fund for rural development , etc. 
  that shall be assigned to the new member * thousands of others , such as simply adding representatives from the new member to * each and every * eu organism . 
  see the [ treaty for the admission of croatia ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/html/?uri=oj:l:2012:112:full&amp;from=en ) for a sample . 
  you can not just `` be '' a new member of the eu without modifying all these things . 
  what are you going to do , just show at the next meeting of the eu commission and ask for an additional chair ? 
  you wo n't even pass the security guard at the door . 
   image is everything , nk style - http://varlamov.ru/1393217.html [ potemkin would be proud ] ( http://www.varlamov.me/2015/ufa_sammit/05.jpg ) !, 
  i agree that the article is overly dramatic , spain has mechanisms for foreign pensioners to legally reside here . 
  however ( except some additional treaty is signed ) uk pensioners would have to switch from the fast and easy eu procedure to the `` foreigners from outside eu '' procedure . 
  initially they would have to apply for a [ non-lucrative temporal residence permit ] ( http://extranjeros.empleo.gob.es/es/informacioninteres/informacionprocedimientos/ciudadanosnocomunitarios/hoja010/index.html ) , that must be [ renovated yearly ] ( http://extranjeros.empleo.gob.es/es/informacioninteres/informacionprocedimientos/ciudadanosnocomunitarios/hoja011/ ) , at the discretion of the authorities . 
  this involves certain conditions ( such as a monthly income of  2130 $ ) and many paperwork and queues . 
  after five * continuous * years ( no more than 10 months absence ) , they could apply to a [ permanent residence permit ] ( http://extranjeros.empleo.gob.es/es/informacioninteres/informacionprocedimientos/ciudadanosnocomunitarios/hoja046/index.html ) . 
  also , they would lose the perks of eu citizenship , such as political rights . 
  as now they can vote and be elected in municipal elections , in many small coastal towns , uk pensioners have secured a few council seats ans thus vote and voice in the matters of their towns . 
  if they would be stripped of eu-provided political rights , they would n't be electable or even have the right to vote in elections . 
  so while no one would be handed a 24h eviction notice like it was 1492 , it is obvious that the loss of eu citizenship is not without unpleasant consequences . 
  having to wait four years to get in-work benefits is outrageous !, 
  human rights violation !, 
  in spain i could get them ... well , never , because they do n't actually even exist :(, 
  may us live interesting times , right ? 
  i saw yesterday ( i think ) a pretty good comment here about how some of the uk conservatives use the `` they want to strip everyone from sovereignty and form a big bureaucratic socialist super-state ... '' argument while some of the left use the `` neo-liberal europe of the merchants wants to strip citizens from rights to feed the greedy megacorporations ... '' at the end , you can portrait an outsider however you prefer . 
  same in spain , you have pay tax for a while in order to qualify for unemployment benefits . 
  and you would n't get in-work benefits either ... because they do n't exist !, 
  i hope so . 
  so far , seems fair to want to retain sovereignty , currency and in-work benefits only for those who have already contributed their money to the system . 
  but some politics love the `` foreign enemy '' scarecrow . 
  your argumentation is spotless from the economical point of view . 
  and , surely , no country has * ever * in the history of mankind done anything economically stupid out of pride and foolishness , right ? 
  i know one case of this . 
  teacher pulled apart two kids that were hitting each other . 
  in the process lightly scratched one of them . 
  lawsuit . 
  when acquitted , she said that next time , she will just call the police and let the kids kill each other while they arrive . 
  out of curiosity , do you know what `` crime '' your great-grandparents committed ? 
  i remember in high school , i had a class with which was alternative to catholic religion class ( so those we elected this alternative class were either from other religions , atheists , etc. ) . 
  of course , among us there were some classical teen `` anarcho-communists '' , complete with standard leather jackets , anarchy logo badges , hammers and sickles , che t-shirts , and so on . 
  it was an open class so we touched a lot of subjects , debated , etc. 
  one day we were discussing the crimes of communists and the crimes of fascists , and our resident `` communists '' were very upset and started shouting . 
  then , the teacher ( who was of russian descent , but we did n't know ) proceeded to calmly explain how , in the soviet union , his father and uncle were accused of being `` intellectuals '' . 
  her father was the lucky one , * only * sentenced to deportation for life to the arctic circle ( vorkuta , i think ) , where she grew up . 
  her uncle , she continued explaining in her calm sweet voice , was just shot in the head . 
  our resident `` communist '' remained pretty silent the rest of the class . 
   even so , the rules require the authorities to print out each submission on a separate sheet of paper . 
  according to the italian news agency agi , this would mean the waste of 412 tonnes of paper . 
  did they really printed it all ? 
  rare seeds ? 
  waaait , that 's not really an elbonian flag ... 
  i love radio yerevan-style jokes . 
  one that has n't been told here yet i think :   q : `` when will communism arrive ? '', 
   a : `` it is already seen at the horizon . '', 
   q : `` what is a horizon ? '', 
   a : `` an imaginary line which moves away each time you approach it . '', 
  [ hear me roar ] ( https://youtu.be/ptybb5ris-k?t=4 ) !, 
  ah , they 've updated the article . 
  but yes , the choice of spokesperson is curious . 
  nato 's standing maritime group 2 is composed of the flagship fgs bonn ( germany ) , tcg barbaros ( turkey ) and hmcs fredericton ( canada ) . 
  we will see , but it is us secdef making the announcement . 
  but at least the guardian can [ ban the comments section ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/31/comments-audience-censorship-criticism ) in controversial stories !, 
  :d  recently , the guardian took the decision to cut down the number of places where we open comments on stories relating to a few contentious subjects -- particularly migration and race . 
  but i though ttip would lower our superior european food safety standards to equate those of pesky capitalist america !, 
  why did you only used some of the countries listed ? 
  thanks !, 
  the article is interesting , but the figure only covers those unemployed after 1 year from graduation . 
  i was looking at the overall figure for all engineers / scientists ( in spain for instance mathematicians and statisticians have an [ unemployment rate of 5.7 % ] ( http://ep01.epimg.net/economia/imagenes/2015/05/07/actualidad/1430988207_261861_1430993285_sumario_normal.png ) compared with the +20 % mean rate ! ), 
  out of curiosity , what is the unemployment rate for engineers and scientists in the uk ? 
  compa\u00f1\u00eda espa\u00f1ola de petr\u00f3leos , s.a. if anyone is wondering . 
  thanks !, 
  it 's a relief to know that !, 
   but having zika and later recovering does not seem to place future babies at risk for microencephaly have a source ? 
  this seemed highly worrying so i 'm very relieved to hear it is not the case !, 
   `` i asked security experts to evaluate whether it would be safe for a family with children to move in , '' he seems to suggest that the concern is more about the family security than about his security ? 
  if we are talking about an order of magnitude of 10 ^ 6 , it really does n't matter if they are \u00bac or k , so i would go directly for mk !, 
   which is better ? 
  depends . 
  specially on whether you 're the grass being stomped or one of those doing the stomping , i suppose . 
  like in that scene from * munich * . 
  i heard it 's better if along with the chemicals you use the trip to also buy your pcbs , wires , electronic components , etc. 
  meet your nato quota with this one weird trick !, 
  i do n't know about military aircraft , but at least in civil aviation it is n't as trivial as this . 
  there is a [ master minimum equipment list ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/master_minimum_equipment_list ) ( mmel ) that defines every equipment that a plane * does n't * strictly need to be considered airworthy . 
  in your example , since the seat cover part # would probably be listed on the mmel , the plane would be both `` in need on repairs '' * but also * airworthy/operative . 
  civilian planes fly lots of times with something broken , and it 's totally fine as long as it is listed on the mmel ( or other mels that may extend/restrict the master on a individual aircraft basis ) . 
  it would be interesting to know how `` operative '' is precisely defined in the luftwaffe but that 's probably classified . 
   `` yeah , i just took a picture of the bones inside you and instantaneously transmitted it to the other side of the planet for evaluation . '', 
  medicine has evolved quite a bit since bloodletting-for-everything ... 
  this is why i do n't believe in ( major ) conspiracies . 
  if the politicians were competent enough to maintain airtight secrecy about them , that would mean they are competent ** and ** capable of achieving long term goals ... two qualities they consistently demonstrate to lack . 
  [ removed . 
   you do need a doctor that knows how to check the age with the bone fusion , a paediatrician or an orthopedist also worth noting that the doctor does n't need to do field work , any trained medical technician can take the x-ray and just email them to a central office . 
  so it 's not really hard to implement . 
  i would say it carries more weight when told by a former kgb lt. colonel x ), 
  that was a very interesting read !, 
  catalan seems to retain more traits of old romance / vulgar latin than spanish . 
  for instance with the days , in catalan they are more close to the original latin form : dies lunae -  dilluns dies martis -  dimarts ... 
  surely the linguists among us can offer more examples , but i 've encountered several . 
  for instance in old spanish texts there are a lot of words with `` f '' that nowadays are written with `` h '' but in catalan they retain their `` f '' . 
  from the top of my head the verb `` do '' is `` hacer '' in present day spanish but used to be `` facer '' , while in catalan it 's still `` fer '' . 
  `` iron '' used to be `` fierro '' in old spanish but nowadays is `` hierro '' , while in catalan is `` ferro '' . 
  ( really , languages are a fascinating topic ! ),
