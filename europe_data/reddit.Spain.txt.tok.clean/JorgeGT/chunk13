  in my general experience , you can not reason someone out of something that they did n't personally reasoned into . 
  * fascists divide themselves into two categories : fascists and antifascists .

  was it the intention to scare people or to charge them with the additional crime of `` breaking '' a signed `` declaration '' when convenient ? 
  can you please make a sticky comment with [ a map of the schengen area ] ( http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2015/08/blogs/economist-explains/20150829_wom916.png ) ? 
  because it seems that a lot of folks are missing how removing greece has zero effect on the common schengen area , which starts at hungary/slovenia . 
  it 's not like migrants can catch a greek plane with a syrian passport !, 
  what does the declaration say ? 
  for what 's it 's worth , i 've made quick [ word clouds ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ywogu ) of the free entry text fields . 
  the mathematica code i used is : texto = import [ notebookdirectory [ ] <  `` content.txt '' , `` plaintext '' ] ; texto = stringreplace [ texto , wordboundary ~ ~ repeated [ wordcharacter ,4 ] ~ ~ wordboundary -  '' '' ] ; cloud = wordcloud [ deletestopwords [ texto ] , colorfunction -  ( hue [ 0.62 , # +0.55,1.2 - # ] & ) , imagesize -  medium , plotlabel -  style [ `` what sort of content do you think \\ n there should be in / r/europe ? \\ n '' ,12 , bold ] ] export [ `` content.png '' , cloud , imageresolution -  120 ],

   even if you reset civilization and start off with anarchy humans will develop communities , factions etc. . and eventually you will have forms of government rising up .

  i believe the us has something like that , an exam for foreign-titled doctors wanting to obtain a license ? 
  while the info is certainly interesting ( i could setup my raspi as a local dns server for my network i suppose ) i doubt that my threat model should include hostile action from five eyes operatives ... ^ ^ for ^ ^ now !, 
  well , i think data-mining for advertising mass-produced consumer products is pretty less worrying than government-ordered imprisonment , torture and murder . 
  not that it is okay , of course , but if you are truly worried about your government arresting you for your browsing habits , google trying to sell you a toaster is the least of your problems . 
  hmmm it 's working for me !, 
  maybe it 's an isp-specific ban ? 
   the vast majority of the population does n't , though . 
  that 's why anti-government graffiti has evolved from the anarchist symbol to [ the ips of google dns ] ( http://www.infostormer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/googlegraffiti1.jpg ) .

  poor thing !, 
   medical data previously suggested that while british pakistanis were responsible for 3 per cent of all births , they accounted for 30 per cent of british children born with a genetic illness . 
  this is seriously wrong . 
  i was born there . 
  thanks !, 
  now i understand why our politicians always praise [ finlandia ] ( http://www.finlandia.com/assets/img/facebook/finlandia.jpg ) . 
   a valencian catalan, 
   sicario was it good ? 
  of course they are innocent until proven guilty , it was n't my intention to accuse them at all , sorry if there was a misunderstanding . 
  in fact , as i said , we 've collaborated with many automakers including psa and never heard of anything illegal , similar to what vw did . 
  moreover , i know for a fact that french automakers spend millions of $ even for small emission optimizations , so ... 
  i would be surprised if they were found to just have a `` cheat switch '' which would render many combustion/after-treatment research investment just pointless . 
   \\  last week  \\  no evidence of a defeat device equipping renault vehicles as someone who works in an engine research lab , i doubt they have been able to reverse engineer all the different ecus and test them extensively in a few days . 
  we will wait and see how this ends . 
  almost all automakers have strategies to reduce emissions on the range covered by the standardized european test cycle . 
  however , that is not illegal under current regulations , it is just optimization ( in the sense that if you actually drive your car on those ranges the vehicle will indeed perform as stated , not like in vw case where only the exact european cycle triggered the modified settings ) . 
  however , it is very possible that more manufacturers apart from vw have secretly used some sort of algorithm to detect that they are in a static test bench and further optimize their settings . 
  including for example the crude and probably illegal procedure of just wait like 30 min after each cold engine start to `` cheat '' , since the duration of the test is ~ 20 min . 
  note that upcoming regulation will introduce more ample cycles and live on-road verification of the lab results up to a certain margin of error so the window of opportunity for these cheats will probably almost closed . 
   greeks sound spanish . 
  this !, 
  hearing a greek speaker is very very weird for me , because the * sound * ( tone , cadence , pronunciation , etc. ), 
  is almost exactly the same as in spanish yet the * words * are totally ^ 1 unintelligible . 
  i wonder if it is the same for greeks hearing spaniards ? 
  save for those whose roots we use , such as democracy etc. 
  i 'm tempted to repost the image as `` country name endings in spanish '' x ), 
  i have a msc-level aerospace engineering degree , a master in thermal engines and i 'm finishing a phd , so hopefully after the inevitable apocalypse of civilization i can work for some emerging warlord haphazardly making crude rockets . 
  with the small difference of the rest of us lacking an israel to go to .

  i mean , if swedish democrats won the national/local elections , would they be the ones deciding if he is fired or kept ?

   the size of the perpetrator group varies from two or three up till 20 people according to eye witnesses , the police said . 
  in the area of the station there were about 1,000 travellers on the 1st of january according to the authorities . 
  is n't it deeply worrying that the police of a major german city could n't detain and process 2-20 assaulters ? 
  and that 998-980 bystanders did n't do anything to protect the assaulted women from these 2-20 perpetrators ? 
  but they do have awesome chocolates !, 
  if you do it consistently for a month , to the point that it hinders their performance in school , yes . 
  i think that even in that case , authorities ( teachers for instance ) should be vigilant about nutrition malpractices . 
  i remember the case of a vegan mother ( of the crazy type ) that was basically starving her child , until teachers alerted social services . 
  mind you , the child had embraced the regime , but he was very weak and his development halted . 
  terrible story . 
  if they do not feed their children , yes , of course it is child abuse !, 
  they are using their free will to actively decrease their performance by avoiding water . 
  what if i choose to hinder my performance drinking heavily before exams ? 
  we must learn to bear the consequences of the choices we freely make .
