  nowhere in the article suggest france 's a400m orders have been cancelled to purchase these planes , so i would say `` in addition '' , not `` instead '' . 
  quick , let 's pool our candidate locations . 
  for spain , [ pe\u00f1\u00f3n de alhucemas ] ( https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-i-xxlvnz1my/ujd01sgmv8i/aaaaaaabxzk/ue81ttt6gsc/w2048-h1365/097-%2528f%25c3%25a9vrier%2b2012%2529.jpg ) or [ isla de albor\u00e1n ] ( http://s.libertaddigital.com/fotos/galerias/espana_secreta-islas-penascos-tesoros-ocultos-dos/isla_alboran.jpg ) . 
  same in spanish ( * b\u00e9lico * ) and catalan ( * bel \u00b7 lic * ) . 
   terrorists do n't need encryption , because they do not hide . 
  the can simply enter a call of duty lobby and talk in some foreighn language . 
  one of the oldest rules of tradecraft is avoiding the perception that you are in fact engaging in tradecraft . 
  if you get searched and you have an encrypted disk in your laptop , encrypted phone , etc. 
  you will rise a lot of questions . 
  whereas if you just have call of duty in your laptop , you 're just another normal guy . 
  this is equivalent to carrying a few ciphered documents vs. carrying a book with a few highlighted passages . 
  even if your opponent ca n't read the documents due to encryption , you 're already burnt . 
  all this paranoia with encryption plays into the public hollywood perception of terrorists being cool-blooded ultra-religious fanatics , spies being suave playboys , etc. 
  in reality terrorists are troubled people from normal backgrounds ( and many of them have an history of drinking , drugs , petty crime , etc. ), 
  and spies are random boring old people . 
  so is there not a separate `` number of rape victims '' metric available from sweden 's statistical office ? 
  only `` number of rape instances '' ? 
  surely it would be trivial to provide both .

  i remember reading a comment here in / r/europe by a turkish guy who was living in germany and opted to support pegida that said the same as you , point by point . 
  he was a muslim but wanted a secular government so he had to restart his life from scratch in a foreign country . 
  he said something along the lines of `` those fuckers made me leave my home once , and now they 're getting here !, 
  i will do whatever is necessary to prevent that in my new home '' . 
  there must be a terrible situation , slowly reviving again prejudice and dirty looks for not going to the mosque , for dressing in a western way , for not making your daughters wear headscarf , for drinking , etc. , after thinking you were finally safe ... 
  apparently it was [ flying close ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/10839095/raf-typhoons-sent-to-intercept-russian-helicopter-over-baltic.html ) to the latvian border with transponders off , but was n't even really intercepted :  the typhoon fighters from 3 ( fighter ) squadron were diverted from a training sortie to intercept an unidentified aircraft close to the latvian border . 
  the mystery aircraft was believed to have been a ka-27 helicopter flying from a russian warship over international waters , but not ` squawking ' its identification code , or communicating with air traffic controllers . 
  the ministry of defence in london said the typhoons saw the anti-submarine warfare helicopter on the deck of a stereguschiy class corvette when they reached the scene , in what was described as a `` friendly visit '' . 
   raf fighters ** intercept ** a russian helicopter this usually means that the aircraft being intercepted has trespassed into an airspace without authorization to do so . 
  this usually prompts the scrambling of interception fighters . 
  in the case of * mercedes * the crucial point was that the frigate was a spanish navy warship . 
  sunken warships and their content remain perpetually under the property of the state they served , in this case the kingdom of spain . 
  the us is one of the most firm defenders of this law , as they have sunken warships ( which are , in fact , war graves ) all over the word , and little desire of watching how random countries start tearing them up . 
  that 's why odyssey was forced to turn back absolutely everything they collected . 
  what saddens me deeply is how much it is said about gold , riches and treasures , and how little it is told about the [ 600 brave sailors and marines of the spanish navy that fought hard during two hours in the middle of the night against a very superior enemy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gmcus4t.jpg ) until their gunpowder exploded and the * san jos\u00e9 * took them with him to the bottom ; an enormous , sunken war grave . 
  will the treasure hunters rummage through their bones to get their precious gold ?

  in spain there 's no letter but there are [ organizations ] ( http://dondevanmisimpuestos.es/politicas ) that [ publish the data ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lba42kb.jpg ) ( which is open sourced by the government ) . 
  they are just outlining modern countries for this particular map . 
  recall that in the comic they use hispania , helvetia , germania , etc.

  :d also , i 've found this bit of info very interesting :  most countries surveyed overestimate the proportion of wealth owned by the 1 % . 
  interestingly , however , when asked how much wealth should the richest in society hold , the responses are closer to the actual levels . 
  not to mention that it 's well stablished that the ring has a will and power on its own , allowing it to deceive and corrupt even the best creatures . 
  if even gandalf or galadriel do n't consider themselves strong enough to withstand the thought of carrying the ring without falling into evil temptation , what can be possibly expected from a simple hobbit ?

  welp , it was a joke , meant to be continued with `` see ?

  sorry to hear that man , i hope things get better !, 
  is n't it true that despite your beers , books and old movies you continue to be stressed from time to time ? 
   it is easier to understand that you would support action against any target in a country that you are in a state of war with so you would understand france carpet-bombing isis-held territory ? 
  so you `` have an easier time understanding '' the assassination of innocent civilian bystanders depending if they happen to live on israel or stockholm ?

  you 're probably mentally comparing with the wwii-style carpet bombing you 've seen in documentaries and movies . 
  these 20 bombs were probably much more effective than a few thousands dropped that way . 
  keep in mind that sometimes they dropped tons and tons of bombs and did n't even scratch the factory or the airfield they were aiming for , while modern bombs are accurate enough to enter through a * specific * window .

  we should confiscate their brooms on the airport checkpoint !, 
  but it is not only a matter of threats , it is useful to know in advance diplomatic/policy positions , negotiating intentions , etc. 
  it 's an old game . 
  i do n't think there 's really any outrage , spying is a fair play game all nations engage in . 
  i mean , that 's why we pay spies for !, 
   catalonia has a right to self determination .

   to ** simplify ** the building permits situation and they say the germans lack a sense of humor !, 
  what i do n't get is those claims of moral high ground ( merkel : [ * spying on friends is not acceptable * ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24659743 ) ) . 
  i mean , the intelligence service is a tax-funded agency , if they were n't spying i would ask for my money back or something !,
