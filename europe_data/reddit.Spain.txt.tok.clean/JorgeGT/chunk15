  well , they are n't keeping the victory around for nothing . 
   by demonstrating erudition on a relatively obscure topic of classical history or literature he does leave a crucial detail off in his historical introduction : when the roman republic and later the empire began expanding outside italy , land grants for veterans were given in newly-founded * [ coloniae ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colonia_\\ ( roman \\ ) ) * . 
  this created hubs of latin-speaking roman civilization in the conquered territories , serving as spearheads of the [ romanization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanization_\\ ( cultural \\ ) ) of these lands :  one characteristic of cultural romanization was the creation of many hundreds of roman coloniae in the territory of the roman republic and the subsequent roman empire . 
  until trajan , colonies were created using veterans , mainly from the italian peninsula , who promoted roman customs and laws , with the use of latin . 
  as it turned out , it was a pretty effective system . 
  the article then follows with :  so why do n't we try something similar with modern migrants ?

  now think if any girl has recently invited you to grelos at her house and you refused because you do n't particularly like the vegetable ... 
  i guess this allows to compare inefficiencies - for instance if you substitute oil by electric vehicles you will replace the inefficiency of the chemical-to-mechanical conversion with that of the electric generation mix . 
  also you can compare the average efficiency of the electric generation mix for different countries , etc. 
  finally , it also indicates rejected heat that could be directed to heat things . 
  but as i said those are my non-expert opinions , probably there 's a good write-up on the iea website that explain this much better , as they are the reference international agency for these things !, 
  keep in mind those are estimations . 
  the data comes from iea , [ which says ] ( http://www.iea.org/statistics/resources/balancedefinitions/#geothermalsolaretc ) :  geothermal , solar , etc. 
  shows production of geothermal , solar , wind and tide/wave/ocean energy and the use of these energy forms for electricity and heat generation . 
  unless the actual efficiency of the geothermal process is known , the quantity of geothermal energy entering electricity generation is inferred from the electricity production at geothermal plants assuming an average thermal efficiency of 10 % . 
  for solar , wind and tide/wave/ocean energy , the quantities entering electricity generation are equal to the electrical energy generated . 
  other uses shown in this column relate to geothermal and solar heat . 
  i suppose 10 % is an average estimation of efficiency , but this is not mi specialty area . 
  no , it is forbidden . 
  only exception is `` smoker clubs '' which have a lot of restrictions ( can not have paid staff , for instance ) . 
  that 's only true if inflation was on a planetary scale . 
  if not , rich people will just diversify their investment on international secure assets that wo n't inflate . 
  or get out . 
  on real inflation crisis , it is the average people who do n't have international assets that suffer , because their money becomes worthless . 
  see [ interwar germany ] ( http://www.warhistoryonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/inflation-2.jpg ) or present day venezuela where people physically fights to buy [ rationed toilet paper ] ( http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/uploads/2013/06/toilet.jpg ) . 
   the assets they have would also lose value , would n't it not if those are apple inc. shares , us dollars , etc. 
  rich people can afford a diversified investment portfolio . 
  in fact , since those investments will hold their value , the difference between them and their countrymen whose only wealth was on devaluated local currency can actually increase . 
  broadly , energy that does n't convert in the intended form . 
  for electricity it will be generation losses ( usually in the form of heat ) , for transportation thermal and mechanical losses , etc. 
  for others there will be also a transportation loss , and so on . 
   the rest heats the ocean it seems that 168 pj of that heat go to residential , commercial and industry uses , not just the ocean . 
  nevertheless , edited my post and added more info . 
  thanks , 
  it does include efficiency but sadly it is aggregated . 
  it would be useful if instead of a grey `` output '' to the rejected energy block , the `` lane '' would be colorized to identify the different inefficiencies . 
   energy rejected as heat during production is not relevant . 
  some of that heat is used in residential , commercial and industrial areas , as shown in the chart . 
  i would say that 168 pj of heat are very relevant , as you would need to substitute that with electric heat if nuclear closed down . 
  nevertheless , edited my post and added more info . 
  thanks .

  let 's hope a great success for the german [ wendelstein 7-x stellarator ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/germany-is-turning-on-its-monster-stellarator-2015-10 ) that is going to be turned on soon !, 
  ~ ~ i mentioned nuclear as the primary source because it alone produced 55 % of electricity and the next source ( hydro ) only 20 % : ~ ~ rank | source | electric energy [ pj ] | % energy | % energy ( accum . 
  ) | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | 1 | nuclear | 660 | 55.00 % | 55.00 % | 2 | hydro | 240 | 20.00 % | 75.00 % | 3 | biomass | 180 | 15.00 % | 90.00 % | 4 | oil | 33 | 2.75 % | 92.75 % | 5 | coal | 29 | 2.42 % | 95.17 % | 6 | wind | 22 | 1.83 % | 97.00 % | 7 | gas | 20 | 1.67 % | 98.67 % | but of course a country needs a mixture of baseload , load following and peak energy sources to correctly balance its needs . 
  ** correction : ** as others have helpfully pointed , nuclear energy gets reported different . 
  i looked at figures [ [ 1 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hdnrj4n.png ) ] [ [ 2 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zdbxntu.png ) ] from the [ swedish energy agency ] ( http://www.energimyndigheten.se/en/news/2015/you-can-now-read-energy-in-sweden---facts-and-figures-2015/ ) and it appears that nuclear input is reported using some unece method to figure out the theoretical energy of the raw fuel . 
  as the usable energy is much less , thus the discrepancy . 
  it is mentioned !, 
   heavy taxes on petrol and diesel fuel , as well as through airport ( ? ), 
  and ** nuclear plant closures ** and the sale of coal mines . 
  i wonder what they intend to use as [ baseload ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/base_load_power_plant ) generation to balance the grid . 
  also , with heavy taxes on fossil fuel and closed airports i wonder how they intend to conduct trade . 
  perhaps the sailboat in the article 's picture is intentional ? 
  for those curious . 
  [ this ] ( https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/content/assets/images/charts/energy/energy_2011_sweden.png ) was sweden 's energy flow chart in 2011 . 
  you can see that nuclear ^ [ edit : ^ + hydro ] and oil were the primary sources of energy for electricity generation and transportation , respectively . 
  on the purely formal aspect , i think that a proper box-and-whiskers plot could be more informative than a lot of blue dots . 
  `` please redirect all my amazon packages to my estonian $ 5 ubuntu vps '' . 
  the devil is in the details i think . 
  you can assert an opinion and you can add data , but it is tricky to do so in a form in which it appears that the data is supporting your opinion while in fact it is not doing so . 
  point in case :  i would like to point out that ** nowhere ** in the past decade ** has there been ** a ten fold increase . 
  let me repeat that : ** there is ** no tenfold increase . 
  see ? 
  you are , in fact , not repeating : you are asserting two different things . 
  one is supported by data , the other is not . 
  the fact that x never happened in the past does n't preclude it to happen now . 
  while i also disagree with / u/megadeathbot666 's claim , i think we can agree that the quality of the discussion does n't improve by qualifying someone 's opinion as `` hyperbolic bullshit '' and then introducing equally non-verifiable opinions such as `` the rise in the number of asylum seekers [ ... ] does not correlate with merkel 's announcement '' . 
  now you ca n't ? 
  maybe it 's a business opportunity !, 
  an autumn/winter evening stroll is not the same without the smell of casta\u00f1as roasting ... 
   there was a constant stream of refugees and migrants before merkel invited them , now it has been multiplied tenfold . 
  to be fair , he said there was a constant stream of refugees and migrants before merkel announcement , which your eurostat data confirms . 
  he theorizes that after merkel 's `` invitation '' ( september 2nd ? ), 
  the stream has increased tenfold . 
  your data only goes until june 2015 , so obviously you ca n't use it disprove his assertion of a tenfold increase in september . 
  nor can you affirm whether merkel 's announcement had an influence in the trend or not , since you do n't have data for that period . 
  anyway , i doubt that a tenfold increase is possible , and i 'll wait until the aggregated stat from eurostat is available , but i 'm interested in seeing how the september/october trend reacts to the announcement . 
  as a researcher , i really like when a discussion involves hard data , but please , do n't abuse that data !,
