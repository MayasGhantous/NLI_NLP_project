   some guy arriving from rural afghanistan might not even know that it 's against the law to take a girl without her permission . 
  i do not know of any human culture where is not against the law to rape random girls . 
  even in the most backwards and misogynistic ones where women are considered property , it is forbidden to take other man 's property without permission . 
  make no mistake : they know perfectly well they are committing a serious crime . 
   so you 're saying that everybody should be like you ? 
  no , i 'm just sharing my personal view . 
  * we used to race them in building outposts in alaska and the pacific northwest ( alta california ) . 
  * the deepest hole in the world is there . 
  because as aristotle said , the whole is greater than the sum of its parts . 
  i feed sad that many people disregard vast fields of the collective human experience . 
  as an engineer , i do n't * necessarily need * to be aware of the works of garc\u00eda lorca , the paintings of turner or the books of antony beevor . 
  but what a waste would be to live without enjoying such displays of human intellect !, 
  and as i enjoy fine arts , literature , cinema , philosophy , history , etc. , i feel that a lot of people is missing the experience of being marveled at the ingenuity and creativity that many mathematicians , physicists and engineers have displayed along the centuries : how they have solved problems , challenged dogmas , shaped the world we live in . 
  welp , that what i was * trying * to convey !, 
  but you have said it much better . 
  what i find strange is how many claim that this evolution of universities from exclusive , aristocratic discussion clubs to scientific workhouses that advance living conditions and allow upwards social mobility for the working class is negative or perverse . 
  there are people today that come from incredibly poor places and are now publishing in the proceedings of the royal society . 
  that would be unthinkable in the `` good old days '' . 
  what i 'm arguing is that there are no * sides * . 
  advancement of human knowledge is culture . 
  is the knowledge of how marine ecosystems or quantum mechanics work `` technology '' ? 
  you forgot the `` non-shia '' in your `` muslim '' . 
  i 'll cherish the day when someone would not dare to call himself * cultured * without knowing newton 's law of universal gravitation or the fundamental theorem of calculus , 
   things like literary critique are the greenhouses in which the creators of the future are incubated so aerospace engineers , surgeons , virologists , nuclear physicists , mathematical modelers , neural network researchers , etc. 
  are n't * creative * ? 
  silly government , allocating hard earned tax money to cancer research instead to numismatics , eh ? 
   people have to pay to go to college so they see it as an investment did n't people had pay to go to college before ? 
  my understanding is that a lot of `` classical humanities '' courses were taken by members of the upper class that wanted to refine/better themselves , more that `` training '' for a job that they really did n't need , as they lived from land/wealth inheritance . 
  as the article puts it ( something you would expect to read in / r/lounge ) :  instead , the undergraduate would simply drop round to their rooms when the spirit moved him for a glass of sherry and a civilized chat about jane austen or the function of the pancreas . 
  where is my top hat again ? 
  nowadays most people go to the university not to master the art of discourse , etc. , but in order to train for a job . 
  i doubt medieval literature programs were intended for us dirty commoners that had to work to sustain ourselves and had '' ** s ** ine ** nob ** ilitate '' written next to our name in oxford and cambridge examination lists to easily distinguish us from the aristocracy . 
  that time is , however , long gone . 
  many people could embark on a pursuit for knowledge 's sake because much more people was dying in the coal mines . 
  ** edit : ** my tl ; dr is : * old man is bitter because the government allocates tax money to scientific research instead to old men who fantasize about drinking sherry with young students in his private rooms . 
  it 's last in `` evolution within digital ecosystem , 2008-2013 '' but has a good score in `` digital readiness index score '' i.e. 
  it 's still one of the most advanced ( n\u00ba 10 of 50 ) but the study suggests progress in these last 5 years has been bad compared with past achievements . 
  there 's an interesting visual representation of what you 're saying in [ this graph ] ( http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/290-width/images/print-edition/20120728_fbc674.png ) , which comes from [ this article ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/21559618 ) ( i really like the [ header image ] ( http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/print-edition/20120728_fbd001_0.jpg ) ! ) .

  correct me if i 'm wrong , but is n't a functional statistical office an actual requirement of the eu ?

   would be like me asking for the restoration of austria-hungary ... at least there are still a few people alive now that were born in austria-hungary !, 
  this is one of the major points :  the worldwide scientific consensus on the safety of genetic engineering is as solid as that which underpins human-caused global warming . 
  yet this inconvenient truth on g.m.o.s -- that they 're as safe as conventionally cultivated food -- is ignored when ideological interests are threatened . 
  the fact that this neo-luddism that disregards science ( climate changes , gmos , vaccines , nuclear energy ) in favor of ideology is gaining support is truly sickening . 
  and amancio ortega follows their trend , he [ just donated ] ( http://www.abc.es/local-galicia/20151022/abci-donacion-amancio-ortega-201510222054.html ) 17 million $ to cancer treatment facilities . 
  or look at [ this $ 20 million donation ] ( http://www.xperedon.com/news/1856/spain-caritas-amancio-ortega-donation.html ) for food , medicines and school materials . 
   that problem is easily fixed but i do n't see it as a problem .

   have you tougth about if the state 's claim on them is legitimate yes , and i 've concluded that we citizens can exercise our sovereignty through the state formed by our constitution . 
  you are of course free to disagree with my conclusion , you asked any of us to express our views and simply i did so . 
  i think that , like corporations have lobbies to pressure for their interests , citizens have government as their `` lobby '' to defend their collective interests . 
  it is true that companies build their networks . 
  but it is also true that we allow them to use public and private land to pass the cables of those networks . 
  or that we agree to free some band of the electromagnetic spectrum for their exclusive use . 
  both public resources that we citizens collectively own through our constitution . 
  so a mutually-beneficial agreement should be arranged , where business secure from us the exclusive use of public resources and we secure from them equal access to the benefits obtained through their use of these public resources . 
  that 's my moral framework on the issue - mutually-beneficial management of public resources . 
  because the alternative is anarchy . 
  should , say , vodafone feel free to disregard the public agreement expressed through democratic representation , i would then feel free to , say , run a 10 kw gsm jammer out of my window - and that would be madness . 
  is n't net neutrality ** asking ** politicians to police the internet in order to prevent private companies from throttling the speed of their own networks at will ? 
  i for one support asking for government intervention on the internet in order to ensure that it remains neutral and beneficial to us all . 
  governments are not an enemy of the people , they are a tool that we citizens must learn to use in order to fight these huge corporate interests . 
  it is not easy , but we often achieve things !, 
  for instance , i think there 's a good change to see true end of roaming charges in europe , 
  * -- many thanks . 
  i love how `` how do you feel about multilanguage comments in / r/europe ? '',

   it wo n't work , and is an extremely stupid thing to do furthermore , it is counter-productive . 
  people will say `` the criminality among migrants is so high that $ ( finnish_government_party ) needed to hide the statistics ! '', 
  or just `` criminality among migrants is 10x that of native finnish people ! '', 
  and without the hard data , you ca n't really disprove them , can you ? 
  i agree on the last part . 
  i remember when lego was very `` standard '' and the only `` custom '' things were stickers or colors . 
  the sight of a `` new '' piece was astonishing !, 
   unless people borrowed against that imaginary value which sadly thousands of people did , with 100 % mortgages . 
  years have passed and i still instantly recall the a38 , everytime .

  i care for my house . 
  my house itself does n't care for anything . 
  you are aware that the planet does n't care for anything right ? 
  it 's just a lump of leftover rocks cobbled together by the gravity of a random yellow dwarf star . 
  humanity is just a blink in its geological scale . 
  as an engineer and scientist , i would n't like to live in a world full of only scientists and engineers !, 
  silly you !,
