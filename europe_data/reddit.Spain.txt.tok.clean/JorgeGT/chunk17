  do n't you know that catalans are an ancient master race , radically different from us filthy moors ? 
  just kidding , [ here is the data broken down ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qpgxjx4.png ) for iberian peninsula regions , you can see how catalans are genetically on the spanish average ( or iberian , really ) . 
  btw , j1 is the most `` arabic '' ( semitic/mesopotamian , really ) y-haplogroup , [ here ] ( http://cdn.eupedia.com/images/content/haplogroup-j1.gif ) is the distribution plot . 
  just because as you said , it was an heterogeneous coalition : monarchic , right-wing , liberal , catholic , etc. 
  so i opted for `` conservative '' to encircle them all . 
  same as the 1936 `` popular front '' was composed of republicans , socialists , communists , anarchists ... as for companys declaration , it was against republican law ( only the ii spanish republic had been chosen by the people - not that confederation of republics ) , and the democratically-elected republican government deposed him . 
  the pacto de san sebasti\u00e1n that you mention was just a private meeting held before the existence of the ii republic , so obviously its conclusions were n't backed by the popular vote - as the 1934 government surely was . 
  it is interesting how you seem to value democratic procedures , except when democratically-elected spanish governments uphold the letter of the law . 
  or do you seriously think that the decisions of a private meeting attended by some individuals in 1930 can trump the vote of the people that chose the 1934 government ? 
  when `` conservative '' parties won the 1934 democratic election ( the first time women were allowed to vote ) companys et al declared independence . 
  there was also a leftist armed revolution in asturias against the republic . 
  the government of the ii republic sent troops to both catalonia and asturias , restoring republican rule of law . 
  however they lost a 1936 election to a leftist coalition . 
  that new government pardoned and liberated companys . 
  then it was the turn of the conservatives to revolt against the democratic republican government , but this time they won . 
  a short time before companys fled to france , but was captured by the nazis . 
  engineers use latex . 
  latex is more of a german thing ... 
  ah , i understood what there were more plastic parts , specially the `` joining '' of the barrel . 
  but glad to hear that !, 
  same in spanish army that i recall ... and it is not a cold country !, 
  i was expecting something like [ this ] ( http://cache1.asset-cache.net/gc/467597516-tents-are-pictured-in-suruc-refugee-camp-on-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=iwsasset&amp;k=2&amp;d=gkzz8bf5zl1ziijumxa7qqqoa5krxjym41edl4vk7av8nxmpv4qkd1e%2bwf89b48rkyftbt6g8vryiuq%2bdecsea%3d%3d ) ( or [ the ikea ones ] ( http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/kqgnrzu3px8acbxkce8k.jpg ) ) when they were speaking of tents , not that ... 
  my grandmother knows a few rat-based recipes . 
  post-war spain , endless fun . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=pdb_lv ) some historical data from oecd countries if you 're interested !, 
  thanks !, 
  the [ graph ] ( http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/print-edition/20150530_brc420.png ) of the economist article illustrates your point and that of / u/meyouyourass . 
  it is a very interesting article indeed . 
   technological advances , aided by collaboration between firms , universities and government are making manufacturing more efficient . 
  i collaborate on research with a certain british automaker mentioned on the article so i can certainly attest that things are moving fast in that front !, 
  is there a perception in the uk that you have a productivity problem ? 
  i just looked at 2013 figures and it [ appears to be on average ] ( http://asset.keepeek-cache.com/medias/domain21/_pdf/media1994/311316-4pgrsnw8xt/large/1.jpg ) . 
  i mean , could be better but does n't look problematic ? 
  there 's a bit of a downwards trend in the latest years but does n't look so bad . 
  additionally to you very correct explanation , if the plane is structurally compromised and not only decompresses but actually suddenly breaks apart , brutal g-forces can render passengers unconscious almost instantaneously ( thus they ca n't even put on masks ) . 
  varoufakis worked for valve , so it checks out !, 
  yep , in general anti-aircraft missiles are set to detonate at a `` kill distance '' from their intended target , showering it with shrapnel . 
  in the case of ir-guided manpads/air-air missiles that target is usually the heat signature of the engines , sometimes survivable in aircraft with very separate engines if it does n't cause fire / take out all hydraulics , etc. 
  in this case as you say it was radar-guided so it exploded when sufficiently close to a radar return . 
  seeing that it was the nose suggests it was fired `` in front '' of the aircraft path . 
  oh no , as others have said the cockpit was obliterated . 
  but the section of the linked report about crew shrapnel is ... gruesome . 
  more than ** 100 ** high-speed metal pieces were recovered from * each * body on the front seats :|, 
   hot pink i was thinking in [ something like this !, 
  ] ( https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53cdd3f3e4b09b69bef6e0ba/53d6bcf6e4b04157ac3c6683/54219c82e4b0423f1491084b/1427224407085/?format=1000w ) :p but interesting article !, 
  ah of course , it was flying at fl330 = 10km high . 
  it could be painted hot pink in full and no one would notice ... even if it was n't a cloudy day , which was the case ( fig . 
  uh , mixed my letters !, 
  meant ftw !, 
   as if launcher crew has used visual recognition instead of usual ground radar system support . 
  i think he says so himself ? 
  probably he meant `` as if ... had ... '' like mocking lack of knowledge of conspiracy-believers ? 
   4 pilot microphones to triangulate beamforming ftw !, 
  -- edit : just saw the video , terrible hit , on one of the worst possible locations ... spraying the crew with shrapnel . 
  some airliners have been able to survive missile hits but this ... it 's truly horrifying . 
  of course . 
  however journals seem to have a terrible approach : their ads are more and more intrusive , to the point that some of their websites are absolutely unusable without adblock ( full page ads with tiny closing buttons , noisy autoplaying high bandwith videos , seizure-inducing flash content , etc. ) . 
  i think that some traditional newspapers are trying to recapture the same volume of advertising revenue that they had in the era of the printing press , where entry barrier cost wast enormous and only a few newspapers dominated the market and captured the advertising . 
  however , with nowadays multiple internet media options , both the intrusive ads and the paywall seem risky strategies : only if your content is of very high quality people will buy a subscription or allow terrible advertisements ... and i do n't know if most newspaper have that quality !, 
  for what is worth , i think that in spain you can get into a master with a three-year italian * laurea * if it can be shown to be equivalent to a three-year spanish degree . 
  about the software dev jobs , there seems to be some movement in big cities like madrid , barcelona , etc. , but obviously not as consolidated as in other countries . 
  legend says that bathing in the beach where the bombs fell granted ex-minister fraga an unnatural long life :p, 
  have you honestly reviewed all the [ position papers and textual proposals ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1230 ) of the eu ? 
  and the [ economic benefits ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/documents-and-events/index_en.htm#economic-benefits ) that the eu wants to reach with them ? 
  nor with the recent iran nuclear deal !, 
  drafts and positions were n't public at all , but surely a negotiation about the offensive nuclear capabilities of an islamic theocracy is way less important for the public than another trade deal uh ? 
  uh ... and tasty food !, 
   i am firmly convinced that spain is the strongest country of the world . 
  century after century trying to destroy herself and still no success . 
  ( attributed to otto von bismarck :p ), 
  this !, 
  i got a pair more than a year ago , plus they 're bigger and easier to carry . 
  fortunately not to my decadent , failed state , 
  i believe so ... maybe [ this graph ] ( http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ourworldindata_world-poverty-since-1820-in-absolute-numbers.png ) helps to put it into context ? 
  same here ... but we know it 's only temporary , 
  i did i did !, 
  in fact the other day i purchased aoe ii on steam ... such nostalgia , 
  yeah , to be honest age of empires singleplayer campaigns were better that some history teachers i 've had :p, 
  the world bank [ has just estimated ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-34440567 ) that extreme poverty will fall below 10 % for the first time this year . 
  look at the numbers of the last 25 years : * 1990 : 1,959 billion = 37.1 % of world 's population . 
  * 1999 : 1,747 billion = 29 % of world 's population . 
  * 2012 : 902 million = 12.8 % of world 's population . 
  * 2015 : 702 million = 9.6 % of world 's population . 
  it 's something , is n't it ? 
  congrats old friends !, 
  remember when we used to [ divide the world ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/spain_and_portugal.png/1024px-spain_and_portugal.png ) between ourselves ? 
  at least we keep the nice peninsular weather , 
  same here ... but surely batteries lasted enough for the politician to appear in the picture ? 
  if it helps , [ it 's pretty cloudy on much of europe ] ( http://oiswww.eumetsat.org/ipps/html/msg/rgb/naturalcolor/centraleurope/imagesdisplay/4m3wxvx4zuby7 ) . 
  to add to this ,  isil considers the name da'ish derogatory , because it sounds similar to the arabic words daes , `` one who crushes something underfoot '' , and dahes , `` one who sows discord '' . 
  so people is supporting this name to show clear opposition to them . 
   was about learning how to work with computers . 
  oh , that i can support , i had computer classes in high school where i learned to code a bit ( flash , html , css , php , javascript , etc. ), 
  and was really great ( it had the computers arranged like you describe ) . 
  the problem here is that they wanted to use the laptop in every class , and that does n't make much sense ... about the proposal , i know that this is not specifically about just computers , but it pains me that the to-go strategy is `` throw money into the problem until it goes away '' . 
  i would really dig eu-wide standardized exams , common educational frameworks , requirements , etc. 
  but member states and unions will never agree to this , they fiercely oppose state-wide standardized tests ... as i said before , the problem of 20 % europeans lacking basic reading/writing/numeracy skills is not a matter of infrastructure . 
  to teach someone language and maths you basically need a blackboard , some chalk , and a good teacher . 
  the second photo made me chuckle in the office !, 
  it is gold !,
