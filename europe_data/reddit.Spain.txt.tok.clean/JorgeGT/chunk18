   i have a vision of school children in thessaloniki walking into a brand new classroom , decked out with computers . 
  then all those computers struggle to access internet through the single adsl line the school has , and after a few weeks they are crippled by lack of maintenance , because the school ca n't pay several the several it technicians required to maintain them . 
  after a few months the only teacher who knows a bit about computers will yield , and all of them would be stored under a blanket at the bottom of the stair well . 
  i know this because it has happened in hundred of schools in spain , which were given 600.000 laptops by the past government . 
  however , no provision was made for maintenance , it staff , data bandwith , etc. 
  ( in my uni we have a dedicated it technician every 2 computer classes , no administrative rights , and at least three 10 gbps pipes , and there 's still struggling ... ) at the end most of them were ditched by the teachers , even more so when there were more a distracting tool than a teaching tool ( teachers had to constantly patrol classes to ensure kids were n't on random webpages ) there were not enough interactive materials in spanish to really profit from having a computer and the teachers did n't had the time nor the knowledge to produce it , etc. 
  --  in 2015 , one in in five european adults struggle with reading and writing and lack basic numeracy skills ** this is the big problem !, 
  ** and it has ** nothing ** to do with not having computers available . 
  schools have successfully trained people not into writing/learning/basic numeracy but into fine literature ( even in ancient greek and latin ) and advanced mathematics for centuries before computers even appeared . 
  i hate to see how politicians only focus on pouring money in equipment instead of solving the glaring problems in schools . 
  in spain , madrid school teachers aspirants ( that had obtained the graduate title ) had to face a test and most of them failed miserably . 
  some examples , just in mathematics : * only 7.09 % was able to complete this equivalence table : data | convert to | and to -- | -- | -- 2 kg 30 g | 2,03 kg | 2.030 g 10 ha | 0,1 km ^ 2 | 100.000 m ^ 2 3h 24 m | 3,40 h | 204 min 2,2 h | 2h 12 min | 132 min * only 21.44 % was able to compute the area and perimeter of a circle of radius 1 cm . 
  * only 21.69 % managed to transform these numbers to irreducible fractions : 0,32 0,75 0,0002 1,02 in other fields such as language , geography , etc. 
  responses were also terrible . 
  you can consult this in full here : [ maths ] ( http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2013/03/13/actualidad/1363201114_422663.html ) , [ language ] ( http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2013/03/13/actualidad/1363196961_731332.html ) , [ geography ] ( http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2013/03/13/actualidad/1363199373_647250.html ) . 
  the obvious result is that most kids reach high school totally unprepared ( both my parents work in education and have to face this daily ) . 
  but of course for politicians it 's way easier to pour money on hardware ( and get those sweet commissions ! ), 
  instead on enacting stricter requirements and tests for teachers ( then you get union revolts , strikes , etc. ) . 
  also , parents saw the schools more and more as a kid jail to keep them behind a fence , instead of a vital learning opportunity . 
  not to speak of when they go to see the teachers to lecture them because their children have failed an exam or they have been reprimanded ... it is a very very sad situation of perverse incentives . 
  good teachers burn out and bad teachers survive by disconnecting from class and just passing everyone . 
  and the kids prefer the teacher that puts very easy tests ( even if they do not learn anything ) , of course . 
  a while ago i saw a tv documentary comparing the system with that of finland and the main difference that i saw was how becoming a school teacher was very difficult ( you had to be on the top positions of the university entry exams ) and how parents would be involved in their children learning , even going to some classes to see what they were teaching . 
  night and day . 
  ** sorry for the rant , / r/europe . 
  afaik , at least 5 articles a day [ must be freely accessible from google results ] ( http://googlenewsblog.blogspot.com.es/2009/12/update-to-first-click-free.html ) in the same extent as was originally made available to the googlebot :  google has strict policies against what 's known as [ cloaking ] ( https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66355?vid=1-635796388068729315-404873558 ) : showing one web page to the crawler that indexes it but then a different page to a user . 
  we do this so that users are n't deceived into clicking through to a site that 's not what they were expecting . 
  while the anti-cloaking policies are important for users , they do create some challenges for publishers who charge for content . 
  our crawlers ca n't fill out a registration or payment form to see what 's behind a site 's paywall , but they need access to the information in order to index it . 
   one way we overcome this is through a program called first click free . 
  participating publishers allow the crawler to index their subscription content , then allow users who find one of those articles through google news or google search to see the full page without requiring them to register or subscribe . 
  the user 's first click to the content is free , but when a user clicks on additional links on the site , the publisher can show a payment or registration request . 
  first click free is a great way for publishers to promote their content and for users to check out a news source before deciding whether to pay . 
  previously , each click from a user would be treated as free . 
  now , we 've updated the program so that publishers can limit users to no more than five pages per day without registering or subscribing . 
  if you 're a google user , this means that you may start to see a registration page after you 've clicked through to more than five articles on the website of a publisher using first click free in a day . 
  we think this approach still protects the typical user from cloaking , while allowing publishers to focus on potential subscribers who are accessing a lot of their content on a regular basis . 
  remember , they ca n't stand iron . 
  i agree !, 
  tell that to my boss :p, 
  there are a bit more photos in [ his site ] ( http://www.laurentkronental.com/souvenir-d'un-futur-\\ ( 2011-ongoing \\ ) / photographs/1 ) . 
  i find [ this interior photo ] ( http://www.laurentkronental.com/media/original/souvenir%20d'un%20futur%20site%20web%20\\ ( 16 \\ ) . jpg ) very interesting - the combination of antique furniture and modern av equipment , windows , etc. 
  gives a certain steampunk-ish vibe to it . 
  totally true , in spain there 's a culture of `` staying in the office '' a lot of hours when in reality having a good rest and free time boosts productivity a lot . 
  but even taking into account productivity ( germans were 24.5 % more productive in average than spaniards in 2014 , in terms of [ gdp per capita ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=pdb_lv ) ) it results in germany having 1713h vs spain 's 1689h , a difference of just 1.4 % !, 
   spanish people and kinda all southeners are super lazy [ :\\ ( ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qfm1wjy.png ),

  ftfy, 
  maybe you know something about swiss law that i do not , and i apologize in advance if that 's the case , but usually federal laws supersede local laws , so the rules that he describes are absolutely valid everywhere in switzerland and following them will get you a gun in any swiss canton , which is exactly what the title says . 
  or do you know of any procedure listed in the post that ca n't be followed in a particular canton ? 
  in any case , i would appreciate that if in the future you flag posts as misleading , you would state why do you think they are so in the comments . 
  thanks , 
  why are you asking me ? 
  i did n't flag this post , a mod did . 
  besides , / u/zorthianator already answered to you that these are federal-level laws ? 
  i do n't understand your question to me at all . 
  why does a mod flag this as misleading ** without ** telling how is it misleading ? 
  since other people from switzerland are saying this is not , i 'm starting to doubt the flags on other posts . 
  why ? 
  their government trusts them to own weapons - they use them to hunt and have fun . 
  their government trusts them to have a pretty direct democracy - they use it to govern sensibly , even approving tax rises if needed . 
  ^ ^ ^ try ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ spain ^ ^ ^ ans ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ would ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ put ^ ^ ^ : roto2 : ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ flag . 
  and the compromise is maintaining a monopolistic model from 1909 ? 
  i think it needs to be changed , but that 's my opinion , of course . 
   uber is not a guy in his garage looking for the best for people , its a multinational company valued in billions that want to cut costs on employees wages those are not mutually exclusive though . 
  i do n't know about you , but before ryanair existed i did n't have the money to afford a plane ticket . 
  from the customer point of view : * you ca n't estimate the cost in advance . 
  specially if they know you 're a foreigner , they will choose absurdly long and convoluted routes to increase the tab . 
  there have been [ several scandals ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/20140113/madrid-taxi-scam ) and hidden camera investigations about this , but the practice continues . 
  they will ask you for 2x , 3x the money and provide you fake receipts in return , so you ca n't complain when your spanish friends discover the scam and tell you . 
  * because they hold a monopoly , the price is much more expensive than for instance the one uber had the brief time they operated here . 
  this is common to every monopoly , but in this case they collude with politicians who get a cut of this money . 
  * some taxi drivers are very rude , specially to foreigners that ca n't speak spanish . 
  even the ones serving tourist areas do n't usually speak english - they 're not required to do so . 
  also , when you manage to flag them down they sometimes refuse to go to certain sites ( for example , far from profitable areas ) . 
  many of them drive at insane speeds and maneuver gta style . 
  * they are not required to carry a credit card machine , and some [ 70 % of them ] ( http://www.consumer.es/web/es/economia_domestica/sociedad-y-consumo/2013/11/05/218468.php ) indeed do not . 
  this means that in order to get a taxi in spain you must have pockey money ready ... but you do n't know how much in advance !, 
  so you must have a good `` margin '' and waaait for the change . 
  they count of you being in a haste and telling them to keep it . 
  * you ca n't `` rate '' them , so pretty much any violation does n't mean anything , as they have purchased the very expensive license and is very difficult to strip them from it . 
  -- as you can see , this is in contrast from the uber service , where you request your ride , get a driver that will accept it , see a google maps view of the itinerary , get a very good estimate of the service price , and pay instantaneously with a click of your phone without the need to carrying money or waiting for change . 
  also , if you have any problem you can report the driver to uber and they will sack him if he does n't maintain a good rating , in addition to uber being able to compare your proposed itinerary with the gps track on the actual trip to judge any suspicious rerouting . 
  why would oversupply exist ? 
  uber ( and other companies ) will accept more or less drivers as the public demand varies . 
  same as any other business activity ... 
  yes , but those licenses ( for call-to-hire drivers than ca n't be flagged down by the public ) have always been much more cheaper than the +100.000 $ taxis are asked to pay . 
  the problem is now that customers can perform the call-to-hire action in a very efficient way . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but i just looked at the uber london website and they say that you a `` pco license '' which seems to cost # 306 - # 500 . 
  this seems to me the best approach : the government inspects and regulates the driver and vehicle , but at the same time does so at a prize almost any citizen can afford . 
  not at all , they want reasonably priced and fair licenses . 
  look at uber london :  ** what are the licensing requirements to drive with uber in london ? 
  **  uber works with public carriage office ( pco ) licensed drivers . 
  at the time of onboarding , you will need to bring with you all up-to-date legally required documents . 
  for yourself this includes :   a valid driver 's license  driver 's license counterpart  pco license . 
   ** for your vehicle you will also need to bring : **   a valid mot  logbook  commercial insurance certificate  pco license . 
   ** i am not currently licensed , how can i become licensed ?
