  **  becoming licensed with the tfl for private hire work is easy !, 
  visit the tfl website which will guide you through the process of becoming a licensed driver . 
  the required pco license costs # 306 . 
  this is a reasonable price and something uber supports , since it adds a layer of official supervision and regulation to their drivers , while at the same time is a price almost anyone can pay . 
  paying +100.000 $ for a taxi license , on the other hand , is something a common person can not afford ( which is the objective of the cartels/lobbies , of course ) . 
   they were n't just magically invoked one day on a caligulan whim . 
  nor did i claim so , i think ? 
  i understand the need for regulation - but i 'm saying regulations should be updated to reflect current day needs and technologies . 
  they should n't be a lifeline for lobby groups , specially if they are prone to exert life-threatening violence . 
  surely with taxi license-holders the dutch public is in safe , law-abiding hands . 
  no need to raid their offices or investigate their activities . 
  * [ a group of masked men armed with hammers and brass knuckles recently attacked uberpop drivers in amsterdam ] ( http://www.nltimes.nl/2015/03/17/armed-masked-men-attack-three-uberpop-drivers/ ) * [ there were several incidents of taxi drivers running uberpop drivers off the road in the hague ] ( http://www.nltimes.nl/2015/02/23/cab-drivers-run-uberpop-drivers-off-road-report/ ) * [ [ rotterdam ] on wednesday night about 25 drivers from different taxi companies followed an uberpop driver via the uber app , z24 reports . 
  the man , who was transporting a passenger at the time , was run off the road and then arrested by the police ] ( http://www.nltimes.nl/2015/02/26/taxi-driver-vigilantes-stopping-uberpop-drivers/ ) nope , not at all ... after all , violently attacking and driving people off roads are minute offences compared with the grave , life threatening crime of offering better , cheaper services without a proper administrative license ( not that i 'm defending uber should n't be prosecuted by it - obviously they should be - but i find the contrast appalling ) . 
  i 'm not defending breaking the law ; i 'm not even specifically defending uber . 
  what i 'm saying is that if when innovative proposals arise , meetings should be held and an honest reflection on changing/updating the law to actually benefit citizens instead of established lobbies should be pursued . 
  instead , the authorities response is having the police force storm their offices . 
  with this attitude , it 's no wonder that innovation happens elsewhere . 
  do n't you worry about the trend i posted ? 
  speaking of the mafia , they thrive on captive markets , specially city-licensed services like [ taxi ] ( http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/adventure/red-line/how-uber-is-ending-the-dirty-dealings-behind-torontos-cab-business/article25515301/ ) or [ garbage disposal ] ( http://mentalfloss.com/article/30738/why-mob-often-tied-garbage-industry ) contracts , where they can put entry barriers to outsiders and keep licenses by bribing politicians . 
  way to go , europe . 
  [ it 's not like this trend is worrying at all . 
  also , impressive [ header illustration ] ( http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/print-edition/20120728_fbd001_0.jpg ) . ), 
  i 've read that they sell the food at net loss prices , in the hope of luring you there . 
  i had a friend who would go every week just to eat cheap meatballs . 
   it looks like a demonstration room from ikea . 
  not enough ikea storage solutions \u2122, 
  and * organizaci\u00f3n del tratado del atl\u00e1ntico norte * as well . 
  for me it gave error when the layer had linked fields , i had to save a new shp with all fields for it to `` start '' working , but veeeery slow . 
  yep , i agree on the plugins ... one thing that i 've totally unable to do in qgis is pansharpening , no matter how many things i 've tried !, 
  but i find qgis to be very powerful for an opensource project , 
  thanks !, 
  i 've tried using the cartogram plugin for qgis but seems very slow ... 
  interesting !, 
  out of curiosity , which software did you use ? 
   spain needs to fix its fiscal model i agree on this . 
  also , i think that the fact that it is called solidarity transfer is part of the perception problem . 
  we all contribute to the extent of our possibilities to the state and we should all be entitled for the funds we need . 
  amancio ortega pays millions in taxes , while i pay mere hundreds , but both he and me get one vote each , same public healthcare , get to use the same roads , trains , etc. 
  am i `` robbing '' him because his balance is negative and mine is n't ? 
  is he being solidary ? 
  no , we are each one complying with our obligations to society . 
  you said 800k in barcelona . 
  and only 414k voted for jxsi + cup in barcelona . 
  are you seriously claiming 386.000 of those sympathizers were underage ? 
  300.000 if we factor the 77 % participation ? 
  i mean , i could pull from idescat the official ratio of +18 / -18 years old people in catalonia , but then probably you would find another explanation . 
   that 's at least 800.000 people curiously enough , only [ 414,164 ] ( http://resultats.parlament2015.cat/09pdf/c09-mun08_l1.pdf ) persons voted for jxsi + cup in barcelona and [ 497,306 ] ( http://resultats.parlament2015.cat/09pdf/c09-comar_l1.pdf ) in the whole barcelon\u00e8s region . 
  i wonder what happened with the other 300,000 ? 
  also , where are the remaining needed to make the 2,000,000 people the [ anc counted ] ( http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/4039552/20120911/dos-milions-carrer-independencia.html ) in the last diada ? 
  because in the whole catalonia jxsi + cup got [ 1,957,348 ] ( http://resultats.parlament2015.cat/09pdf/c09-totalycircuns_l1.pdf ) votes ... and i doubt every single one was in barcelona , since to move 2m-500k = 1.5 m extra people you need like 300.000 buses of 50 seats each . 
  -- the alternative explanation is that the anc claims are hilariously exaggerated . 
  the delegaci\u00f3n del gobierno counted [ 600.000 people ] ( http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/4039552/20120911/dos-milions-carrer-independencia.html ) at the diada , which is much more plausible given the 497.000 votes in the barcelon\u00e8s region and the 100.000 people that [ the anc claimed to have bussed ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20150911/54435220374/via-lliure-calienta-motores.html ) . 
  as you can see 500k barcelon\u00e8s voters + 100k bussed by anc match almost perfectly the 600k estimation of the delegaci\u00f3n . 
  i can lend you my occam 's razor if you need one , 
  cartograms are terrifying ... :|, 
  for reference [ this is a map ] ( http://www.fmr.cat/atles/media/mapes01/images/fmrmapa1.17.jpg ) from * fundaci\u00f3 del m\u00f3n rural * which allows the visualization of urban/rural municipalities based on population and population density . 
  yes it does . 
  it says `` percentage of votes to jxs\u00ed + cup '' right on the top of the image . 
  [ here is the data by municipality ] ( http://resultats.parlament2015.cat/09pdf/ftop_l2.htm ) ( look for the excel icon ) . 
  there are good shapefiles at the [ institut cartogr\u00e0fic de catalunya ] ( http://www.icc.cat/vissir3/index.html?lang=esl ) ( open the cat\u00e1logo y descarga tab  base municipal ) . 
  btw , i do n't know about those guys , but i doubt val d'ar\u00e0 would want to join an independent catalan republic . 
  hahaha awesome : _ ), 
  not bad , not bad !, 
   telebanco por favor ? 
  ^ ^ paging ^ ^ / u/sugusino ^ ^ and ^ ^ his ^ ^ * colla * ^ ^ :p, 
   * pro-tip : in spain ( or italy ) they wo n't put milk in your coffee unless you explicitly ask for it . 
  no , no , father as in biological father . 
  to clarify : * artur mas banet - father [ bio father ] of artur mas i gavarr\u00f3 ( current president of catalonia ) was caught with millions in hidden switzerland accounts . 
  * jordi pujol - [ political father ] of artur mas ( jr. ) confessed in an open letter to have hidden millions in andorra . 
  other members of the ruling class have also been found stashing away money in those places , hence the multiple jokes . 
  who is the hidden spanish-speaker of the mod team ? 
  * no silly , this is the type of quality posting / r/europe needs !, 
  we all should start a series of `` screenshots of google results '' about our countries . 
  and spanish ... oh look , is 15:20 already !, 
  zzzzzz, 
  en fin ... why bother . 
  i 'm happy for the czech republic growth though , i 've been there two times and it 's a beautiful country . 
  the [ sovereign military order of malta ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/sovereign_military_order_of_malta_passport ) disagrees !, 
  having only three citizens and no territory does n't preclude them from having their sovereignty [ recognized by 105 countries ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/smom_relations.svg/1024px-smom_relations.svg.png?1443429171908 ) . 
  this is a very important point . 
  nationalist parties always want to position themselves as the only authorized `` voice of the people '' . 
  they talk about `` we , the scots '' or `` we , the catalans '' , but if you 're not a nationalist then suddenly you 're not a true catalan anymore ( charnego , botifler , etc. 
  ) , you 're a traitor , etc. 
  as the op says :  imho what bugs me is that we have now a situation where there are socially catalans ` de primera i de segona ' , meaning , `` true '' catalans , and `` in reality you 're not '' catalans . 
  about politicians posing as speakerpersons of the motherland , i 've always liked this quote by aleksandr solzhenitsyn :  that 's the way it always is . 
  it is n't just some person who needs you ; it is always your motherland . 
  and it is always some official or other who speaks on behalf of your motherland and who knows what she needs . 
  the father of artur mas , current catalonian president , [ had an unexplained fortune ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2012/11/18/inenglish/1353267110_578761.html ) hidden in switzerland :  in 2008 tax inspectors found that mas ' father , artur mas banet , who died last march , had two million euros in accounts in liechtenstein and switzerland , but he regularized his situation with the treasury and was never charged . 
  the high court in 2010 decided to drop the case because the statute of limitations had run out . 
  but mas banet never publicly explained the source of his wealth . 
  if you 're wondering , we still do n't know there he got his millions . 
  or pujol the fortune he confessed to have hid in andorra . 
  so there 's a lot of jokes about the true motherland of the ruling class in catalonia . 
  go to the library and pick a few !, 
  they were a bit more adult-oriented than mortadelo , in the sense that they had jokes and parodies of real life situations that a kid could miss for lack of experience . 
  i would have said [ superl\u00f3pez ] ( https://bbltk.com/imagenes/portadas/internal/1188991.jpg ) , which is a parody on superman . 
  this is very traditional in spain , our best known novel , * don quixote * , is also a parody on chivalry novels , which were the superhero comics of the time . 
  ferrer-dalmau has indeed painted many episodes of our history that our educational system usually glosses over . 
  i found super interesting the story of [ bernardo de g\u00e1lvez , and his battles in america ] ( http://www.abc.es/cultura/arte/abci-galvez-toma-pensacola-1781-lienzo-augusto-ferrer-dalmau-201511161523_noticia.html ) helping the thirteen colonies achieve independence against the red coats . 
  a relatively unknown figure , g\u00e1lvez is 1 of the only 8 people who have ever been awarded [ honorary us citizenship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/honorary_citizen_of_the_united_states?oldformat=true#recipients ) .
