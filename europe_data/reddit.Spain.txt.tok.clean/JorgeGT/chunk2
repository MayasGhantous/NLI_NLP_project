  i know what it is , but i think that the important parameter is whether if lower rate is positive ( getting richer ) or negative ( getting poorer ) . 
  btw , i took some data from the piketty database to illustrate , but sadly while the top 10 % is very detailed , the bottom 90 % is n't broken down in more percentiles : [ here 's a graph i just made for spain . 
  seems that we agree on that ... for bonus points : do you know the actual , legal name of the 8bn $ local investment funding of plan e ? 
  i understood what you said , what i 'm saying is that the sunken-cost fallacy goes both ways . 
  in this country we have burned billions trying to boost economy . 
  look at the plan e , the first one did n't work and the response was to waste a few billion more in the second , because backpedaling would mean their political death . 
  i feel that neither pure austerity nor pure public spending are the solution , which probably lies in small but focused investment , but since they would be probably very polemic ( stop subsidizing coal extraction and invest in a few applied research technological institutes , for instance ) i doubt there 's any politician ready to implement them ... 
  i think it depends on the region but at least in alicante the very same people later march as `` moros y cristianos '' and then you could ride a boat in the rivers of alcohol :p ( also , you must pay a visit sometime ! ), 
  relatively poorer but actually richer , right ? 
  ] , madrid new highways , barcelona 's forum , valencia 's street f1 circuit , and the myriad of other infrastructure investments that we have burned billions and billions of euros in and now sit abandoned/unused . 
  sincerely , i prefer our politicians not spending at all our actual and future money in anything , rather than seeing this horrible waste and thinking in all the loans we 've taken to pay for them :|, 
  your mileage may vary , but at least in my town many many * nazarenos * are atheist / non-practitioners . 
  it 's more of a cultural thing rather than a religious experience ( your family always was in the same * cofrad\u00eda * , it 's a very old tradition on the town , etc. 
  yep , it is generally accepted that it was formed by refugees fleeing their homes after byzantine power faded from the area . 
  haha i knew someone would complain :p, 
  ah , i get your point . 
  but in any case , people can probably get cheap german/swedish lessons while working , that 's how a lot of spanish migrants learned german back in the 70s : usually some of their fellow countrymen that are established and speak the language make a little extra money teaching newcomers . 
   cant say the same for germany or sweden . 
  * [ integration courses in germany  ( http://www.bamf.de/en/willkommen/deutschlernen/integrationskurse/integrationskurse-node.html;jsessionid=40eb7cb4d7b7bff14aa7724f35b74c44.1_cid294 )  if you received your residence permit after 1 january 2005 and you can not make yourself understood in german , ** you must attend an integration course ** . 
  the local immigration office will decide if attendance is required when it issues the residence title to you . 
   if you receive unemployment benefit ii ( arbeitslosengeld ii ) and the office from which you receive unemployment benefit ii requires you to attend an integration course , then you are obliged to attend . 
   if you receive unemployment benefit ii or social assistance ( sozialhilfe ) , you can apply for exemption from the requirement to contribute to the costs . 
  you can also gain ** exemption from contributing to the costs if you find it particularly hard to pay ** because of your financial or personal situation . 
  * [ sweden support plans to learn swedish and get a job  ( http://www.arbetsformedlingen.se/globalmeny/other-languages/languages/english-engelska/we-help-you-find-a-job-in-sweden.html )  do you have a refugee residence permit ? 
  or are you staying with a relative in sweden who has had a refugee residence permit for no longer than two years ? 
  you may be one of the people covered by the law on introduction activities for certain newly-arrived immigrants . 
  please go to your nearest employment office to find out more . 
   together we will set up an introduction plan . 
  this plan will include activities that will help you to ** learn swedish ** and get a job as quickly as possible . 
  we will give you advice on where your employment chances are good . 
  while you are taking part in the activities in your plan , ** you will paid a special allowance ** called introduction benefits . 
  yep , but i can only compare known wages !, 
  consider that these people also ca n't speak bulgarian , so if the * average * there is 325 $ , what can they aspire to earn ? 
   surely there will have to be some kind of measures be sure that hosting countries wo n't lock up refugees . 
  and under nominal schengen conditions , no checkpoints in the border , so nothing is really preventing them from crossing the border . 
  so it boils down to , is it better to search for a legal job in spain ( 23 % unemployment ) or bulgaria ( 325 $ average monthly wage ) or try to get an illegal job in germany ( 5.3 % unemployment ) or sweden ( 2800 $ average monthly wage ) and hope to regularize your situation later ? 
  i think you 're missing his point ? 
  he 's saying that even that `` they will receive no housing , no financial assistance and no healthcare except emergency healthcare '' , hundreds of people from the balkans and eastern europe still ** do ** find motivation to enter germany illegally . 
  if people native to eastern european countries leave their homes , countries , families , etc. 
  to enter germany illegally ( thus , no benefits ) , why do you think refugees without any emotional ties to their hosting eastern european country will stay ? 
  it is [ a slide from a presentation ] ( http://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/un_geneva/documents/press_corner/news/20141210_protection_at_sea_-_presentation_accompanying_speech.pdf ) entitled `` protection at sea in the mediterranean '' by laurent muschel , director of migration and asylum of the european commission , in the context of the `` high commissioner 's dialogue on protection at sea '' , geneva , 10-11 december 2014 . 
  it appears to have been extracted from [ this other slide ] ( http://www.ft.dk/samling/20142/lovforslag/l2/spm/36/svar/1259495/1540374.pdf ) from a frontex presentation entitled `` latest phenomena at the eu 's external borders , scifa 19 sep 2014 '' but i 've been unable to find this last document . 
  i find interesting that it appears to be written in english . 
  to cater to such diverse `` clients '' that a certain arabic dialect could not be chosen , or translated by frontex ? 
  for comparison , frontex has seized [ this document ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rwydquf.jpg ) that smugglers are using to inform on stay conditions . 
  aerospace here though !, 
  such is life . 
  some classics are `` mortadelo y filem\u00f3n '' and `` superl\u00f3pez '' , but i grew up reading mostly french/belgian comics in spanish , 
  shame on you for forgetting spirou !, 
  fortunately the graph includes a handy button to access the data and edit the chart . 
  it looks [ like this ] ( https://cloud.highcharts.com/images/yjipim/0/800.png ) with a linear axis . 
  access [ this url ] ( https://cloud.highcharts.com/charts/uhutad ) to play with it !, 
  regarding the log/linear axis , linear allows a clear visualization of raw magnitude , but makes some data unreadable . 
  for instance cyprus or malta numbers disappear completely . 
  hmm how i miss hand-making bode diagrams of random transfer functions ... ^ ^ ^ said ^ ^ ^ no ^ ^ ^ one ^ ^ ^ ever !, 
  not only in nl , this happens everywhere . 
  in fact some airlines survive solely by offering those `` type rating + [ base/line ] training '' packages . 
  tens of thousands of $ for a few flight hours and some touch 'n' go in a specific model . 
  what i 'm saying is that after you 've completed your [ degree in hebrew and aramaic studies ] ( http://www.usal.es/webusal/node/4016 ) , complaining about companies / government not hiring you for a position related to your degree , or not taking your degree into account , is absurd . 
  you 're as free to study what you want to study as everyone else is free to not hire you afterwards . 
  studying * anything * does not entitle you to a job , but sadly some people does n't understand this and feel misled / lied to when they realize . 
  refusing to acknowledge that `` what you want to learn '' is often uncorrelated with `` what the labor market actually needs '' . 
  the problem that i see is not only the simplicity , but the rigor . 
  if a person had a graduate/master in sociology decades ago , you were assured that they could write flawless reports , perform archival research , properly cite documentation , have good command of historical and contemporary sources , at least basic understanding of statistical theory and practical application , manage a spreadsheet/make simple charts , etc. 
  nowadays i 've personally seen master thesis without citations ( or those being a few wikipedia urls and a single textbook ) very poorly written ( orthographic and grammatical errors in every page ) , the charts pasted without attribution from internet / the textbook , etc. 
  and yet they pass , because a ) the university tries to admit everyone , as budget is directly related to headcount and b ) the budget/continuity is tied to performance , so if a big % of students fail , the university can lose the degree / budget . 
  so the professors are pressured to let everyone pass . 
  it 's a perverse incentive system , and the effects are clearer every day ( now one of those degrees is seen as worthless ) . 
   if people want to learn a career and can pay for it problem is , [ students only pay ~ 20 % of the cost ] ( http://i.imgur.com/p4srh3x.jpg ) . 
  average cost of university year per student [ is ~ 6500 $ ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kgqi2ql.jpg ) ( facilities , material , university staff , etc. ), 
  from which the student pays around ~ 1300 $ , while the remaining ~ 5200 $ are paid by the regional government education department ( * consejer\u00eda de educaci\u00f3n * ) . 
  so at the end we 're 80 % `` communist '' . 
  it is the government ( this is , us , the spanish taxpayers ) who is paying the lion 's share of thousands of university careers that are totally uncorrelated with market needs . 
  nice , uh ? 
  :d -- edit : if you 're interested in the university system data [ here is the latest report in full ] ( http://www.crue.org/publicaciones/documents/uec/la_universidad_espanola_en_cifras_13-14.pdf ) . 
  [ yup !, 
  let 's hope is valve 's soon \u2122,

   vito andolini ... from corleone, 
   denmark ~ ~ has ~ ~ had the worlds best restaurant . 
  sorry mate , that 's from 2012 !, 
  uhm ... maybe we need / r/europemetameta ? 
  oh i know , but it 's always a good opportunity to tell a bit of history ... this sub is a bit mono-thematic nowadays !, 
   spain never had pesos small correction ii : we had pesos for centuries !, 
  it was the common nickname for the old [ `` real de a 8 '' ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/real_de_a_8 ) [ piece of eight , or spanish dollar ] silver coin that became legal tender in the us and then served as the base for the us dollar . 
  in fact even peseta [ means `` small peso '' ] ( http://lema.rae.es/drae/srv/search?id=hsniqde3pdxx2b8xf4xu ) !, 
  also a sad reality here in spain . 
  even after long time communist leader carrillo [ said ] ( http://elpais.com/diario/1977/04/16/espana/229989610_850215.html ) that they should accept and embrace the flag ( he ordered it displayed alongside the red flag in party acts ) because otherwise only the far right would be represented by it . 
  most of the left prefer to use the republican design ( you see some of them around here ) and socialist leader pedro s\u00e1nchez made the news recently when he used the official flag as a background for a speech . 
  sadly i did n't stop a lot on that area , but contrary to / u/dimitrit94 i got a positive vibe , maybe as an engineer i 'm biased but i liked the sight of the heavy industries an so on !, 
  probably the sunny and bright summer days helped but i got a nice dynamic feeling , like the industrial heart of europe beating . 
  overall it was a great trip , if i only i had more time to spend on the deutsches museum ... 
  imagine if his area of research was those pesky gmos !, 
  actually it reminds me of [ this roadtrip ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9lhixf7h.png ) i made last year !, 
  ah of course , that 's why i used the past tense !, 
  those time are long gone . 
  there 's a perception in europe that the us is some sort of every-man-for-himself dystopia but i have the feeling that if you stop and review those programs you 've mentioned ( and the other city/country/state / federal programs ) you would find that there 's indeed lots of safety nets in place , am i wrong ? 
  [ here 's ] ( https://i.imgur.com/qjtlltu.jpg ) a similar one from the us navy ( but expanded ship by ship , not collapsed by category ) . 
  edit : not including the us coast guard . 
  i think that 's the reason why the united states was able to cope with huge waves of newcomers : at most they could claim a plot of land in remote oregon , but not much more : no pay , no free housing , no free healthcare , university , etc.
