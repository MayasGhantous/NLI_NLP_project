  the city of [ galveston , texas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galveston,_texas ) is named after him ( g\u00e1lvez town ) . 
  a very interesting read of a very forgotten part of our history in north america . 
  the british were so sure about the victory that they printed already a lot of medals , many featuring a kneeling , surrendering blas de lezo accompanied by pretty brave ans inspiring engravings such as : * [ spanish insolence corrected by english bravery ] ( http://www.coins-of-panama.com/vernon/vn4-120.html?size=smallnoen ) * [ the .

  i would add the [ miracle of empel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_empel?oldformat=true ) . 
  spanish tercio soldiers were isolated by ~ ~ goddamn heretic ~ ~ freedom-loving dutch in a tiny mount since the enemy had flooded the lands . 
  without armed boats to counter the dutch ships , their prospect was to surrender or get bombed to death . 
  the dutch , being good sports , offered them an honorable surrender . 
  since the surrendering option seemed to them as fun as stopping dutch cannonballs with the face , the tercio soldiers amicably answered that those conversations about surrender could be resumed after they were all dead , and started digging trenches . 
  later , a digging soldier unearthed a painting depicting mary of the immaculate conception . 
  the men [ paraded the painting ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/el_milagro_de_empel.jpg/1280px-el_milagro_de_empel.jpg ) and prayed to her as the night fell . 
  during the night , a chilly wind started to blow , and for the first time in many many years , the mouse started to freeze . 
  the dutch flotilla had to retreat , and the spanish were able to cross the freezing river in small boats and invade a nearby dutch fort that had been bombarding the stranded spanish from the opposite shore , and they successfully garrisoned until reinforcements arrived . 
  the spanish are too busy stabbing each other over whose side of the cauldron is better to think of an actual escape . 
  imps gather around and make bets . 
   last i heard you ca n't eat/drink anything from the area as you 'll be ingesting radiation ( although apparently you can bring your own if it 's safely wrapped up ) . 
  this is because most of the remaining radiation is in the dust , so as long as you do n't kick up dust clouds or ingest it in any other way you will be ok , as your skin is pretty good protection against alpha radiation . 
  just take one paper from each party if you do n't want to disclose your choice . 
  super interesting , thanks for sharing !, 
  i think your maternal grandparents are the perfect example on how radically wwii changed society : people in the cities experiencing the life in the fields , women joining unheard-of occupations in factories , industry , etc. , boys of humble origins jumpstarting to careers previously reserved for the well-to-do 's and seeing the world ... 
  i find these changes endlessly fascinating . 
  -- as for my family , they did n't participate in wwii but some fought as militiamen against franco troops . 
   run away like an english man : when someone leave a place without saying goodbye . 
  so very discreetly . 
   interestingly , we say the same but with france : * marcharse a la francesa . 
  are there communities of moriscos descendants remaining who still speak a distinctive but almost spanish ( or portuguese ) tongue like ladino ? 
  if they are , they should be given nationality as well i think . 
  not exactly what you 're asking , but i 'm happy that our law has been changed to give nationality to sephardi jews . 
  people who have maintained a mutually understandable language through +500 years of exile should be welcomed back with praise . 
  do you mean the roc flag ? 
  it 's available , in the third column , just after passing sweden and switzerland . 
  nothing . 
  in varietate concordia o7, 
  that 's why we ca n't have nice things . 
  you have the `` advanced examples '' in [ this pdf ] ( https://www.lantmateriet.se/globalassets/fastigheter/fastighetsinformation/lagenhetsregistret/2012/instruktioner_lagenhetsnumrering.pdf ) , pero no est\u00e1 en cristiano . 
  yeah , i found the swedish system very clever and useful . 
  here in spain it 's a mess , each building is different , not only regarding floor number ( because sometimes we have mezzanines , etc. ), 
  but also door numbers ( 1,2,3 , i , ii , ii , a , b , c ) and sometimes even stairwell ( a , b or left , right ) , if the building has more than one ... ... but we have washing machines !, 
  no need to fight for the nice tv\u00e4ttstuga slots !, 
  not that i know of !, 
  i found out the hard way when i retrieved the keys to my apartment in stockholm , located in `` whatevergatan xx , yyyy '' with no other indication of floor or door ... x ), 
  swedes have also [ a really cool 4 digits code ] ( http://blog.engelsmannen4.se/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/lagenhetsnummer.png ) to identify apartments / flats . 
  will you have differential thrust to turn in the water ? 
  i reluctantly concur . 
  valencia here . 
  as in other cases the city itself was founded as a roman colony over an older iberian settlement . 
  specifically , it was founded in 138 bc during the rule of consul decimus junius brutus galaico , making it 2154 years old . 
  the purpose of the newly founded colony , * valentia edetanorum * [ from `` valour '' and the edetanian region ] was to provide land and solace to the veteran soldiers that fought the lusitanian war . 
  some traces of this roman colony can still be seen today in the city center . 
  it does n't matter * , as long as there 's a single faucet . 
  in any case op can [ submit his specific question ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eu-rights/enquiry-complaint-form/home ) and get a response from the staff . 
  if you absolutely have no income you will get provided with welfare money for rent and food , however they depend a lot of the region where you live ( usually called * renta de inserci\u00f3n social * or * renta de ciudadan\u00eda * ) . 
  however , they are dependent on you actively seeking jobs and not refusing jobs offered to you . 
  if you refuse a perfectly fine job , you can go get food to a church or whatever . 
  by the way , there are a lot of people criticizing your lifestyle choice as if it was something inconceivable that a person would do this . 
  however , i 'm convinced that if basic universal income was enacted , lots and lots of people would follow your reasoning . 
  after all , if you have shelter and warm food ensured , it 's probably much more fulfilling to contemplate nature , read books , write poems , build matchsticks models or whatever you do , than consume your life in a boring/repetitive job . 
  you should really do that ama , i think it would be quite interesting and eye-opening . 
   environmental hazard [ here 's a relevant article from the guardian ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/06/bay-of-gibraltar-shipping-pollution ) if anyone is interested in reading more about this topic , that is often sidelined compared to nationalism , smugglers and tax heaven talk . 
  tl ; dr :  on the spanish side freighters refuel in dock , but gibraltar does not have enough space for fuel tanks . 
  so at any given time there are three floating filling stations cluttering up the bay . 
  authorised by the uk authorities , they are forbidden in spain . 
  `` the risk is too great , '' says alfonso marquina , the harbour master at algeciras-la linea . 
  each of the tankers carries up to 100,000 litres of diesel . 
  haha yes , my mistake . 
  i meant to say the opposite , that some people use a * different * sound for \u00f1 / ny , overdoing the `` n '' part like `` espannya '' instead of `` espanya '' . 
  apparently we suffer from [ ye\u00edsmo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ye\u00edsmo ) my friend !, 
  oops . 
  in my defense , i just knew you were very possessive with your fries . 
  well , obviously it 's way better if you can do it !, 
  but if you ca n't and the rest of your spanish is good , you can still be understood . 
  your teacher was exaggerating ... ^ ^ unbelievable ^ ^ from ^ ^ a ^ ^ spanish , ^ ^ eh ? 
  what i meant to say is that some natives can not roll their r 's as well , so if i heard you speak i would n't immediately think `` oh he 's not spanish '' . 
  if the rest of your speaking / phrasing is good you could still pass as a native . 
   i do n't really care that i ca n't roll my r 's there are native spaniards who ca n't roll their r 's , and many people who use the same sound for `` ll '' / `` y '' , and '' \u00f1 '' / `` ny '' ( specially catalan speakers ) so it 's not really a problem at all . 
  we tend to only use fulano and mengano , but in full form ( not diminutive ) they might sound derogatory depending on context , like saying `` a nobody '' . 
  `` fulana '' specifically means a women of bad reputation . 
  i asked him a long time ago [ with this handy map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/share_of_estonians.png ) ( that apparently he made ) if the red regions where  50 % of people are not ethnic estonians could vote in a referendum to freely decide their sovereignty , he said of course not because they were invaders and thus they had no right make referendums or divide estonia . 
   almost all buildings of flats here , have laundry rooms . 
  but if have your own washing machine , you can avoid fighting for the good * tv\u00e4ttstuga * time slots !, 
  you know that missing arm nelson had ? 
  he tried to [ seize the canary islands . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_santa_cruz_de_tenerife_\\ ( 1797 \\ ) ? oldformat = true ) emphasis on * tried * . 
  as for my opinion , he was a great sailor and a man of duty and honor that conducted himself with professionalism and respect for the enemy , which is always praiseworthy .

   i could n't understand the appeal of wanting one massive state that could have all the potential problems the us has .
