  it is also obvious here . 
  * mordidas * everywhere ... :|, 
  is there a possibility of moderate labour members forming another party ? 
  i was n't talking specifically about the uk , for instance pedro s\u00e1nchez , head of the biggest leftist party in spain , said the other day that the ministry of defense [ is `` of no use '' ] ( http://www.lasexta.com/noticias/nacional/pedro-sanchez-sobra-ministerio-defensa_2014100400042.html ) . 
  of course there was a pr storm and he retired that , but a person that thinks that surely is n't much in favor of the nato . 
  the 2nd leftist party leader , pablo iglesias , [ said that if he were to be pm , he would try to get spain out of nato ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2014/11/17/5469bd5522601d79098b4573.html ) . 
  of course the british can be in favor of nationalizing those services as it seems they were good managing them . 
  try proposing in spain that telef\u00f3nica-movistar should have a monopoly in telecommunications or that iberia airlines should have the monopoly in air transport ... as for planned economy , that was i what i was trying to say , that the public will forced them to drop their traditional economic stance , so they radicalize their `` anti business '' / `` anti markets '' , `` anti bankers '' narrative to a extreme that alienates much of the voters . 
  my tens, 
  it 's not that , after all the us has mechanism to impeach presidents . 
  but someone like him could greatly damage international relations everywhere i think . 
   voting for the obvious ` anti-establishment ' choices is , people feel , the only way to fight back but , would you say that this punishment vote is made without really wanting those candidates to get elected ? 
  because i fear a terrible mistake like this strategy resulting in someone like trump as potus :|, 
  that 's the fear i have as well , a cycle of : * politician 1 makes big , unrealistic promises to get elected ( scrap austerity ! ), 
  * gets elected , faces reality , reverses his promises ( more austerity ! ), 
  * politician 2 reacts with even more extreme positions ( leave euro/eu ! ), 
  * etc. 
  because at some point anyone can make a catastrophic mistake ( le pen gets elected ? 
  fair enough , just a friendly lynching advocacy . 
  i still hoped we could discuss about the * content * of the article itself without calls for homicide , but that 's ok . 
  c'mon * shur * , what 's wrong with fc ?

  i feel this is a highly interesting reflection about the latest political developments around the world . 
  i find the following paragraphs thought-provoking :  there is a politics of parallel reality going on , in which reason is an irritation , evidence a distraction , emotional impact is king and the only thing that counts is feeling good about it all . 
   the explanation for this parallel reality is something to do with people feeling empowered by their ability through it , to `` fight back '' against `` the system '' , the traditional ways of thinking about politics with all its compromises , hard decisions and gradual increments . 
  it is the clarity of full-throated opposition versus the chin-stroking nuance of : `` what would we do if we were in government ? ''  it 's a revolution but within a hermetically sealed bubble -- not the westminster one they despise , but one just as remote from actual reality . 
  those in this bubble feel good about what they 're doing . 
  they 're making all those `` in authority '' feel their anger and their power . 
  there is a sense of real change because of course the impact on politics is indeed real . 
  the labour party is now effectively a changed political party over the space of three months . 
   however , it does n't alter the `` real '' reality . 
  it provides a refuge from it . 
  he links this `` unrealism '' policies of corbyn and donald trump as manifestations of the same feelings , and i 'm compelled to agree . 
  a lot of conservatives in eeuu do n't seem to acknowledge that the people wants a more `` socialized '' society : more nets for people falling through the cracks like affordable healthcare , more government intervention against monopolistic practices like those of big telcos , etc. 
  so instead of adapting to the will of the people they resort to more and more conservative values , lots of them i had never though i 'd see like religious extremism in a republic founded by very secular people , xenophobia in a country made up of migrants , anti-scientific views ( evolution , climate , vaccines ) in the country that leads top science and research in the world ... and it seems that the left here in europe is going through the same road : they do n't accept that people does n't want a socialized , centrally-planned economy but instead we like the ( regulated ) free market , the liberalization of markets such as telecommunications , railways , taxi , etc. 
  allowing for competition to benefit the public instead of crony public workers , and so on . 
  and like in the us , some on left do n't seem to accept this and go to more and more extreme positions : re-nationalizing everything , withdrawing from nato , disarming countries , even reopening the coal mines in this case , in some sort of late-19th-century syndicalism nostalgia . 
  we did , after you guys left !, 
  note the funny parts in bold ... 
  i 'm picturing a very monty python-esque scene in my head :p  the falklands remained uninhabited until the 1764 establishment of port louis on east falkland by french captain louis antoine de bougainville , and the 1766 foundation of port egmont on saunders island by british captain john macbride . 
  [ c ] whether or not the settlements ** were aware of each other ** 's existence is debated by historians . 
  [ 23 ] in 1766 , france surrendered its claim on the falklands to spain , which renamed the french colony puerto soledad the following year . 
  [ 24 ] problems began when spain ** discovered ** and captured port egmont in 1770 . 
  war was narrowly avoided by its restitution to britain in 1771 . 
  [ 25 ]  both the british and spanish settlements coexisted in the archipelago until 1774 , when britain 's new economic and strategic considerations led it to voluntarily withdraw from the islands , leaving a plaque claiming the falklands for king george iii . 
  [ 26 ] spain 's viceroyalty of the r\u00edo de la plata became the only governmental presence in the territory . 
   making housing more affordable in general maybe current vacant houses will sell at a discount , but the attitude of the government will surely reduce investment . 
  who will build homes if they can be arbitrarily fined when unable to sell ? 
   cheaper housing means that it becomes easier . 
  as a young person with his fair share of renting houses , let me say that this is not my experience . 
  landlords are increasingly against renting to people who they see as `` risky '' , like young professionals , because eviction is becoming very difficult . 
  so they demand a lot of upfront payments , heavy bank guarantees to be signed by parents , or they outright reject you . 
  he means that , as vacant houses are fined , there will be less buyers interested in buying the houses of those being evicted , so there will be less competition and the auctions will finish with lower prices , increasing the debt burden of those evicted . 
  it is a similar process to how increasing difficulties or even outright banning evictions drive renting prices very high ( as no owner wants to risk their house being occupied without paying ) and dries up credit/raises interest ( as banks feel that the loan carries much more risk if there is no possibility to gain control of the collateral if the loan fails ) . 
  the final effect thus being that accessing a home either through rental or buying becomes increasingly difficult . 
  but i feel that this kind of long term thinking is put aside for short term pr . 
  and they seem to be in talks to build a huge one in the old bullfighting arena of barcelona . 
  * unpaid interns should be banned . 
  same as volunteers working on which is obviously direct competition . 
  but big labour unions do n't get votes nor revenue from them so they do n't care . 
  * going to the shop only for a person to physically hand you a mass produced , standard item that he has previously batch-ordered is an old concept , gradually substituted for better logistic systems that make possible to cut intermediaries . 
  not to speak of the kindle ... * if a judge rules they 've broke the law and abused workers they should be punished accordingly . 
  because i despise people who breaks the law , in this case through unpaid labour . 
  if amazon is more convenient and accessible than traditional bookstores , then so be it . 
  how many hat shops survive in your city ? 
  and video rentals ? 
  was n't it also the one `` employing '' free volunteers on their uk 2nd hand bookstores until they drive all other wage-paying bookstores in the neighborhood to bankruptcy ? 
  damn , i was doubting between those two !, 
  thanks !, 
  i agree ... it must be pretty terrible deal for them , imagine having to flee your home , managing to settle to a secular , progressive country only to see the old nightmare starting again little by little : the dirty looks , the low-voice comments , then the insults , harassment ... :|, 
  or not . 
  i remember reading here a turkish guy living in germany that supported pegida or similar , he said something along the lines that he had to flee his country and leave his family behind because he was a very secular/atheist guy . 
  he said that he had managed to rebuild a free life in germany and was determined to do whatever necessary to prevent the people who in his view ruined his country from ruining again his life . 
  bear in mind that a lot of first-wave migrant have to flee their countries because of prosecution , etc. , so they are the first to hate who they perceive as radicals , freeloaders , etc. 
  are inorganic veggies a thing ?

  hyper short summary : three categories will be established for the operation of drones : -- ` open ' category ( low risk ) : safety is ensured through operations limitations , compliance with industry standards , and the requirement to have certain functionalities and a minimum set of operational rules . 
  enforcement mainly by the police . 
  -- ` specific category ' ( medium risk ) : authorisation by an naa possibly assisted by a qualified entity ( qe ) following a risk assessment performed by the operator . 
  a manual of operations lists the risk mitigation measures . 
  -- ` certified ' category ( higher risk ) : requirements comparable to those for manned aviation . 
  oversight by naa ( issue of licences and approval of maintenance , operations , training , atm/ans and aerodromes organisations ) and by the agency ( design and approval of foreign organisations ) . 
  seems that `` open '' category drones that are not obviously very small toys ( < 1kg ) will require geo-fencing and automatic identification upon challenge : ` i-drone ' means the capability to react on interrogations from enforcement entities and provide information about the drone , the operator and the operation . 
  such systems might use technologies like cell-phone networks or radio-frequency identification ( rfid ) . 
  the principle could be combined with a registration similar to the process of registering sim cards for mobile phones or could be publicly accessible , for example , though a web-based system or direct communication of the drone with smartphones using wi-fi . 
  a portable chip providing that function independently could be attached to the drone in operation . 
  so , it seems like most of the hobby/open source projects will need to implement these two systems . 
  geo-fencing can be easily implemented by software , but this `` iff '' system will need additional technology .

   unemployment jumped in spain , greece , and portugal after austerity measures were passed , heavily packed by germany . 
  i do n't know about others , but unemployment in spain jumped when the lehman collapsed and our domestic housing bubble burst . 
  germany-backed austerity measures came much later . 
  never before has anyone uttered words of that tongue here in / r/europe !,
