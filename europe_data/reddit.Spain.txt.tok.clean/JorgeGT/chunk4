  way to be dismissive of the woman 's feelings !, 
  but they pay vat and property taxes . 
  i saw a tv interview with an old neighbor and he said that the stones came from an old house indeed . 
  maybe it helps to think that even with such threats , the risk of dying on the motorway on route to the airport is orders of magnitude greater ? 
  i 've actually done my fair share of planespotting [ below the ils glideslope ] ( https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3290/2947015993_d31154d3c4_b.jpg ) of my airport !, 
  of course it 's possible to hit an airliner from below , but it 's a exceedingly difficult thing to achieve in a single try , imho . 
  i had a subject on missile systems ( imparted by an af general , such fun ! ), 
  on my aero eng degree and we discussed this kind of threats . 
  rpg/atgm against a parked/taxiing airplane is much more common , airborne ... a whole different thing !, 
  totally agree , but the phrasing `` pilots are unsure how to take evasive action '' made me understand that they were referring to an airborne attack . 
  very little options of evasive action on taxiing/landing/take-off !, 
  yep , but for that you need a pretty near range and line of sight to the airport platform/runway/taxiways , it 's a different tactical problem that airborne interception . 
  bear in mind that while ( for instance ) that landing 747 appears to go slowly , its landing speed is actually 130-160 knots ( 240-300 km/h ) , not slow at all !, 
  but i agree a taxiing plane on the ground could be targeted . 
  `` fire and forget '' atgms are typically ir , laser or radar guided , but in any case since we 're talking atgms i assume we 're talking about a landed or taxiing plane , and i doubt the el al system operates on ground , since it would be pretty ineffective . 
  i doubt any atgm could be useful against an airborne jetliner , as they lack the computation ability/maneuverability to seek such a fast target . 
  some atgms could be used against slow moving helicopters , but that 's all . 
  also , bear in mind that the warhead operation is very different : atgms primary goal is to penetrate thick armor , usually with a shaped charge , while aa missiles goal is to project a wide wave of high speed shrapnel into the light fuselage of a plane . 
   `` airlines have been warned of a possible attack on a plane with an anti-tank missile , '' a source told the telegraph . 
  `` but pilots are unsure how to take evasive action . '' what ? 
  to hit a plane you need a homing missile ( either radar or ir directed ) , an anti-tank missile is typically either straight-flying like an rpg or , at most , cable directed . 
  they are made to hit stationary or slow moving targets , not aircraft . 
  also , how would a civilian plane initiate an evasive action ? 
  you need to detect the missile first , and for that you need special equipment . 
  for instance el al aicraft do have missile detection and flare dispenser systems .

  probably the vintage jet did n't have a radioaltimeter , instead relying in a barometric altimeter . 
  an usual cause of these crashes is forgetting to update the altimeter with the local barometric pressure ( qfe ) instead of the departing airport qfe or , worse , the mean sea level pressure ( qnh ) . 
  but there 's no way to know the cause of the accident yet .

  i believe the government adheres to the letter of the treaty of utrecht :  ** article x **  the catholic king does hereby , for himself , his heirs and successors , yield to the crown of great britain the full and entire propriety of the ** town ** and ** castle ** of gibraltar , together with the ** port ** , ** fortifications ** , and ** forts ** thereunto belonging ; and he gives up the said propriety to be held and enjoyed absolutely with all manner of right for ever , without any exception or impediment whatsoever . 
  but that abuses and frauds may be avoided by importing any kind of goods , the catholic king wills , and takes it to be understood , that the above-named propriety be yielded to great britain without any territorial jurisdiction and without any open communication by land with the country round about . 
  additional waters ( the three miles mark ) were not yielded because the concept of owning water did n't exist at the time . 
  but when that became a thing , the uk claimed them ( as it was its right ! ), 
  and spain disputed the claim ( as it was its right ! ), 
  so a endless legal dispute started . 
  i personally believe that this game of `` playing the colonial empire '' makes the news when either the spanish / uk government need a bit of smoke screen for corruption , scandals , etc. 
  if it depended on me , the matter would be settled in singular combat or something like that :p, 
  maybe !, 
  the text accompanying the straight black lines says , i think , `` straight baseline claimed by morocco/spain '' and the other alludes the 12 miles limit as per the united nations convention on the law of the sea . 
  yep , i [ downloaded the data ] ( http://www.marineregions.org/downloads.php ) they are using and opened it in qgis , here [ it 's the result ] ( http://i.imgur.com/v1vbgqn.png ) . 
  i think they made a mistake when merging land and sea regions together ( the data only includes sea regions as you see ) . 
  ah , that 's right !, 
  not only is not true , is not even the spanish government position , which recognizes some gibraltar territorial water ( those of the port , seen [ here ] ( http://img.irtve.es/imagenes/pesqueros-algeciras-evitan-aguas-gibraltar/1338286474994.jpg ) in green ) . 
  it would be absurd to have a port without territorial waters to dock !, 
  not even the uk/gibraltar claims those waters !, 
  they claim a 3 mile band around the rock itself , not the huge chunk depicted on op 's map .

  but severed head were already in style !, 
  actually no , after complaining my post got upvoted into positives again :d, 
  that does n't make sense , how could i have whined about downvotes before being downvoted ? 
  i do n't know , i got downvoted for just providing a legend to a graph that was missing it :|, 
  from top to bottom @ 1993 , lines are : * total number of crimes reported * burglary * assault * sexual offences ( rape incl . ), 
  * robbery * murder , homicide edit : downvoted twice for adding a legend to a graph , nice . 
  what 's the reasoning ? 
   which means the court can rule that spanish authorities can enter the area for environmental protection purposes . 
  yet the british authorities [ still make a fuss ] ( http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=36140 ) when a research ship tries to collect environmental samples and conduct marine research in those waters , disregarding the decision of the ecj that spain has the right to enter the area :  the research ship \u00c1ngeles alvari\u00f1o , operated by the spanish oceanographic institute , was attempting to collect samples and readings inside british gibraltar territorial waters . 
   the vessel -- and others like it -- has been here before in the past as part of spain 's efforts to exert jurisdiction within a spanish eu-designated nature site that overlaps into british waters . 
   every time it enters , royal navy vessels in gibraltar , together with other agencies , attend and prevent it from carrying out the research work , which is unlawful in british waters . 
  sending royal navy military ships to prevent an unarmed civilian research ship to collect scientific data as allowed by european nature protection law , confirmed by the european court of justice ruling , very classy move . 
  `` return '' ceuta to morocco ? 
  could you please tell from what year to what year has been ceuta under moroccan control ? 
  gibraltar has the right to use the water for their ships , of course !, 
  as it has the right to use the air for its aircraft !, 
  but the same as the airspace is under spanish management , spain argues that the waters are under spanish management as well , because no `` rule of three miles '' existed in 1713 so could n't possibly be yielded !, 
  to sum up : land was ceded , and the use of the water to get in and out . 
  but no water was possibly ceded * because the concept of ceding water did n't exist in 1713 * . 
  note : if you are interested in maritime history , read master & commander , the novel , which takes place in spain . 
  notice how the concept of water pertaining to a country does n't exist in the novel !, 
  and also enjoy a magnificent work of literature of course !, 
  please copy and paste where in the treaty it says anything about three miles or cannon range , ~ ~ as you claimed to have `` digged '' ~ ~ sorry , it was other redditor !, 
  it 's too late at night : s also , are you claiming that the concept of territorial waters existed on 1713 ? 
  because that 's ... well , objectively wrong :| and ... 
  i see that you are deciding to avoid commenting on how the airspace over gibraltar effectively belongs under spain air traffic control :p, 
  impossible , because the `` territorial waters '' concept did n't even exist at that point in history !, 
  in that time , you got land . 
  and if you got nice cannons you could defend some water around your land . 
  but the very concept of `` territorial water '' as in , some `` lines '' on the map that pertained to a country , did n't exist !, 
  you can see that contrary to your earlier claims the treaty does n't mention any such `` sea limit '' . 
  the uk was conceded the land and the port , and that 's it . 
  edit : your commentary about air space is on point : you can clearly see in [ the official eurocontrol map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/eurocontrol_fir_and_uir_in_the_lower_airspace_-_12_march_2009.png ) that gibraltar is under the jurisdiction of flight information region madrid . 
  it should be just the same with waters . 
  is it me , or it reads like a monty python gag ? 
  sorry , that 's ** false ** , but please , do n't take my word for it !, 
  [ here is the full text of the treaty ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/peace_and_friendship_treaty_of_utrecht_between_spain_and_great_britain ) , you can search for cannons or miles or three , nothing . 
  the relevant article concerning gibraltar is article x. 
  here it is in full :  ** article x **  the catholic king does hereby , for himself , his heirs and successors , yield to the crown of great britain the full and entire propriety of the town and castle of gibraltar , together with the port , fortifications , and forts thereunto belonging ; and he gives up the said propriety to be held and enjoyed absolutely with all manner of right for ever , without any exception or impediment whatsoever . 
  but that abuses and frauds may be avoided by importing any kind of goods , the catholic king wills , and takes it to be understood , that the above-named propriety be yielded to great britain without any territorial jurisdiction and without any open communication by land with the country round about . 
  yet whereas the communication by sea with the coast of spain may not at all times be safe or open , and thereby it may happen that the garrison and other inhabitants of gibraltar may be brought to great straits ; and as it is the intention of the catholic king , only that fraudulent importations of goods should , as is above said , be hindered by an inland communications . 
  it is therefore provided that in such cases it may be lawful to purchase , for ready money , in the neighbouring territories of spain , provisions and other things necessary for the use of the garrison , the inhabitants , and the ships which lie in the harbour . 
  but if any goods be found imported by gibraltar , either by way of barter for purchasing provisions , or under any other pretence , the same shall be confiscated , and complaint being made thereof , those persons who have acted contrary to the faith of this treaty , shall be severely punished . 
  and her britannic majesty , at the request of the catholic king , does consent and agree , that no leave shall be given under any pretence whatsoever , either to jews or moors , to reside or have their dwellings in the said town of gibraltar ; and that no refuge or shelter shall be allowed to any moorish ships of war in the harbour of the said town , whereby the communication between spain and ceuta may be obstructed , or the coasts of spain be infested by the excursions of the moors . 
  but whereas treaties of friendship and a liberty and intercourse of commerce are between the british and certain territories situated on the coast of africa , it is always to be understood , that the british subjects can not refuse the moors and their ships entry into the port of gibraltar purely upon the account of merchandising . 
  her majesty the queen of great britain does further promise , that the free exercise of their religion shall be indulged to the roman catholic inhabitants of the aforesaid town . 
  and in case it shall hereafter seem meet to the crown of great britain to grant , sell or by any means to alienate therefrom the propriety of the said town of gibraltar , it is hereby agreed and concluded that the preference of having the sale shall always be given to the crown of spain before any others .
