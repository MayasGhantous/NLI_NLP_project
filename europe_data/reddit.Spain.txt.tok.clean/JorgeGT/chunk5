  please , there 's no reason to spread misinformation in this age where full historical text are at the tip of our hands !, 
   edit : such a racist bastard his majesty the catholic king was , eh ? 
  what is clear is that the treaty of utrecht says :  ** article x **  the catholic king does hereby , for himself , his heirs and successors , yield to the crown of great britain the full and entire propriety of the town and castle of gibraltar , together with the port , fortifications , and forts thereunto belonging ; and he gives up the said propriety to be held and enjoyed absolutely with all manner of right for ever , without any exception or impediment whatsoever . 
  but that abuses and frauds may be avoided by importing any kind of goods , the catholic king wills , and takes it to be understood , that the above-named propriety be yielded to great britain without any territorial jurisdiction and without any open communication by land with the country round about . 
  this is to say , the piece of land and the waters of the port . 
  the three miles limit is an informal limit that exists because that was the usual range of the cannons of the age :  the three-mile limit refers to a traditional and now largely obsolete conception of the international law of the seas which defined a country 's territorial waters , for the purposes of trade regulation and exclusivity , as extending as far as the reach of cannons fired from land . 
  the current international law is [ the un convention on the law of the sea ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/united_nations_convention_on_the_law_of_the_sea ) which establishes a general principle of 12 miles , unless there 's a conflict between the claims of two countries in which case , in typical un style , an endless legal battle is established . 
  no resolutions has been reached for the gibraltar dispute . 
  that is the applicable international law as it is today . 
   that by accepted international standards i 'm interested in this , could you please link me to that `` accepted international standard '' ? 
  i did n't know that the international organization for standardization concerned itself with maritime zoning . 
  if that 's your reason to dismiss a court ruling explicitly asserting the right of spain so supervise the activities of that maritime area , that 's okay , we 're all innocents in here , you know ? 
  those damn judges know nothing !, 
  if by `` international and international maritime law '' you refer to the un convention on the law of the sea of 1982 , that 's an international treaty that imposed some general principles , such as a sovereign 12 mile area around a country shore , etc. 
  but here 's the catch , what happens if the geography of two countries make that principle physically impossible ? 
  at best , they will have agreed on previous maritime limits . 
  at worst , as in this case , they would not , so they could engage in an endless process of litigation . 
  have this [ nice and long pdf ] ( http://www.un.org/depts/los/legislationandtreaties/pdffiles/table_summary_of_claims.pdf ) compiling maritime claims of countries !, 
  as i said above , the european court of justice has repeatedly upheld that the waters around gibraltar are part of [ a spanish special area of conservation ] ( http://eunis.eea.europa.eu/sites/es6120032 ) for nature protection and spain is thus responsible for policing that waters so that fishing practices , ship refueling , land development and so on effectively comply with the restrictions of the european nature conservation law . 
  to my knowledge , all appeals against the ecj ruling made by the uk have been dismissed by the court . 
  the uk still refuses to acknowledge the court decision , but that 's not spain 's fault . 
  for example , the european court of justice has repeatedly upheld that the waters around gibraltar are part of [ a spanish special area of conservation ] ( http://eunis.eea.europa.eu/sites/es6120032 ) for nature protection and spain is thus responsible for policing that waters so that fishing practices , ship refueling , land development and so on effectively comply with the restrictions of the listed site . 
  to my knowledge , all appeals against the ecj ruling made by the uk have been dismissed by the court . 
  but that does n't stop the uk from pretending that those waters are somehow under their legal jurisdiction ... 
  if it was ready to go live , that means 1 ) it had been tested 2 ) it had database access ( login and passwords ) . 
  and in order to get the login and password for a database you have to somehow retrieve them . 
  and then , in order to check if the system is ready for prime time , you have to perform live tests ( or against a data dump ) or at least check if the login is correct and the api is working . 
  or maybe he was ready to `` energize '' a system without testing it beforehand ( what could go wrong ? ) . 
  ** or ** you know , it was all a hollywood-esque bluff he told the investors and they did n't actually do anything beyond discussing the system in a bar napkin . 
  occam 's razor tells me it 's the second one , but of course you can believe all the `` hacking '' and `` laptop-plugging '' and `` system-energizing '' movie !, 
  i 'm hoping jason statham plays v-man . 
  continue listening :  and ** we were ready ** to get the green light from the pm when the banks closed in order ** to move into the general secretariat of public revenues ** , which is not controlled by us but is controlled by brussels , ** and to plug this laptop in and to energize the system ** . 
  he claimed that they `` were ready '' to `` energize the system '' ( i.e. 
  making it live ? 
  ) , it was just a matter of `` getting into '' this room and `` plugging in this laptop '' they had . 
  of course now we know that : * that laptop did n't exist . 
  * the whole system supposedly `` ready to be energized '' did n't even exist . 
  * it was all lies and hot air , as usual from v-man .

  hypersonic flight ( m  4 ~ 5 ) is considered another category because at that speed air starts to lose some of its usual properties , such as molecules dissociating , ionization , ideal gas law inaccuracy growing , boundary layers working differently , and so on . 
  essentially it 's like the aircraft is flying in a different medium , so they must posses different design principles if they are meant to achieve this speed regime . 
  if you go beyond this speed it 's even worse , you start to lose more and more capabilities until the only thing you can do is flight straight with an ablative heat shield and hope for the best :p, 
  fear not , for i have [ abstruse flow charts ] ( http://www.studying-in-spain.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/spanish-education-system.jpg ) !, 
  roughly : * primary and the `` first stage '' of secondary ( eso ) are compulsory ( up to 16yo ) . 
  * afterwards one can join the labour market or enroll into `` bachiller '' ( more high school , `` second stage general '' ) or vocational/professional training `` second stage professional '' . 
  * then there 's university studies which are all `` tertiary education '' . 
  this is where your example would be .

  i just grabbed the data from ine and made [ a quick graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ovzuti0.png ) .

  of course you do n't live very well - but you live . 
  $ 3,000 a year is survivable if you own a house or if you share with 2-4 more people . 
  but i meant that this is something people does while formally unemployed , which was what / u/transcendent-pants was asking . 
  it does n't always mean 4 years without a job , but 4 years without a formal job , not the same thing . 
  this is indeed a big factor . 
  i made a [ quick graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j1wqqaq.png ) to show this . 
  also , the submerged ( informal ) economy . 
  lots of former construction contractors are doing small on-call fixes on people 's homes , paid in cash and without registering as self-employed workers . 
  also if you have domains registered or if email lists are leaked from any web ; there 's a market for these things . 
  but yeah , i used to wonder why i did n't have `` nigerian prince '' emails until suddenly i got a few !,

  allow me to cite from the [ wiki ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/ensanche )   ensanche means `` widening '' in spanish . 
  it is used to name the development areas of spanish cities around the end of the 19th century , when the demographic explosion and the industrial revolution prompted the tearing down of the old city wall and the construction of neighborhoods under grid plans . 
   the program of city extensions in spain began simultaneously in 1860 with the plans for barcelona by ildefons cerd\u00e1 and madrid by carlos maria de castro , influenced by haussmann 's transformation of paris from 1852 ( and , in turn , have been said to have influenced haussmann 's later projects ) . 
  those ensanches extended cities beyond their traditional limits by demolishing city walls , transforming riverbanks and subdividing the `` extramuros '' -- rural land outside the city walls . 
  ensanches were generally based on principles articulated by cerd\u00e1 . 
  these included reserving significant open space by requiring mid-block open space and whole block parks . 
  the height of buildings was set by reference to the width of the adjacent street . 
  many of these requirements were modified , and the building volumes increased , by later amendments beginning in 1864 ( madrid ) . 
  specifically you can see between images 2 and 3 how this `` widening '' of the old city was planned in a very geometric grid . 
  and in the iss pic you can see that they followed the plan !, 
   it was probably put down there for a good reason som ( \u0421\u043e\u043c ) was sunk in an accidental collision 10 may 1916 , according to the wiki, 
  well , but those people often post details to the media to get the help of the public .

  coupled with nasa/usgs landsat , it will provide ** free and open ** information to whoever wants it . 
  this is huge in terms of democratizing access to space-based information . 
  for example , an app could be built where farmers can check the irrigation and health of their crops and use this info to optimize water consumption , take corrective actions , etc. 
  you can learn much more of the benefits of the copernicus program [ here ] ( http://www.copernicus.eu/main/application-domains ) . 
  in each section ( health , tourism , biodiversity , climate , agriculture , etc. ), 
  there are small . pdf leaflets that explain the applications . 
  i am soo eager for it to be fully commissioned !, 
  names are not usually translated in dubbed media in spain . 
  i 'm sorry if that came out as dismissive , but i asked because you talk about `` treason '' charges but nothing about breaching of confidential data , which would be the charges a person who publicly confessed this hack would face here . 
  good night , by the way !, 
  it would n't be treason , it would be breaching of confidential data . 
  people has a right to privacy , politicians can not just privately tell a friend to come by and dump fiscal databases onto their large computers . 
  it is n't like this in your country ? 
  my point is that when one calls a bluff , he expects their antagonists to have doubts , fears and to ultimately to back up . 
  but if you throw a lot of bluffs and do n't act on any , your antagonists will start dismissing them and tighten their position . 
   they never made the jump from the conspiratorial duo to actually setting the plan in motion , so , they seized the database of fiscal numbers for the guy to put `` onto the large computer on his office '' or not ?
