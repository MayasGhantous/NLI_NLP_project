  because i do n't know about greece , but that 's a grave crime in my country . 
   the message is , we 've figured out the infrastructure , we have a plan and we 'll use it if we need to . 
  this is called a bluff . 
  and for bluffs to work , you have to actually deliver sometimes . 
  a framework exists . 
  this is very different from a working banking system able to cope with the demand of a whole country . 
  and still you have to implement his framework into actual hardware ... 
  with hyperbole you mean bluff right ? 
  as in , i say that this system is ready to be switched on but actually is just an idea written by my old friend in the bar napkin ? 
  but , work with me here , he said he was ready to turn the system on , right ? 
  just plug this laptop in . 
  obviously i know he 's not telling the truth , but i 'm wondering where the actual truth is ... 
  but he talks about him alone :  so we had meeting ** just two of us ** - nobody else knew ...  so i authorised ** him ** ...  onto a large computer in ** his ** office so that ** he ** can work out how to ** design and implement ** this parallel payment system also claims that they were ready to turn the system on , so why the 1000 extra developers ? 
   and we were ** ready ** [ ... ] to ** plug this laptop in ** and to ** energize the system **, 
  hmm i do n't know your background , but i can tell you that banking is orders of magnitude more complicated than some cob ** o ** l routines on old ibm mainframes . 
  in fact , for instance , bbva group in spain is investing some 2,100 million $ in technological innovation between 2014 and 2016 ( mainly revamping backbone/website/apps ) . 
  look , i understand the basis of the system , and it 's not a bad system if they have a reliable form of id already . 
  but , believe me , such a system can not have been implemented by one man in a few months . 
  there 's some serious it horsepower behind modern banking systems , specially in terms of real time operations , distributed databases , small latency , safety , encryption , etc. 
  to not speak of the testing and debugging !, 
  or do you believe they installed a big server farm with its network equipment , cooling , power , etc. 
  without anyone noticing ? 
  maybe the whole system runs from `` this laptop '' that v-man says it was ready to `` plug-in and energize the system '' ? 
  this can not be a one man operation . 
  ask any it professional . 
  the part about moving in , plugging a laptop and `` energizing ( ? ), 
  the system '' is out of a bad movie . 
  and talking to hedge fund managers nonetheless , who routinely approve millions in it equipment and tons of engineer man-hours for their own ops ... 
  i wonder how they contained the laugh . 
  are you able to distinguish `` conception '' and `` implementantion '' ? 
  i 'm an aerospace engineer and phd candidate , i have a solid background in turbojet engines . 
  but i ca n't build a turbojet engine myself . 
  do you know the orders of magnitude behind a banking system ? 
  the vast amount of computational resources , i/o , network sync , safety ... not to speak of an incredible large field testing program to iron out any bugs that can allow money to disappear , duplicate transactions , race conditions , etc ? 
  that can not be ** implemented ** by any one guy in secret . 
  not to the point , as v-man claims , of being ready to `` move in , plug this laptop and energize the system '' . 
  i know , but my doubt is if : * it was just a hollywoodesque bluff ( `` we are ready to ** break in ** , then ** plug this laptop ** and ** energize the system ** !! '' ), 
  or * if he actually believed that a working banking system for a first world economy could be really implemented by a lone guy in secret and implemented ( where ? ), 
  without testing at all . 
  they did n't wanted the source code of the website itself ( which is probably some cms , think wordpress , jekyll , etc ) they wanted the full database of tax numbers to build such system :  the plan would involve hijacking ** the afms of taxpayers ** and corporations by hacking into general secretariat of public revenues website , varoufakis told his interlocutors . 
  as for your second comment , the idea is not bad , but i hope that you realize that a single developer hired because he is a childhood friend of the minister can not design nor implement such a system . 
  do you have the faintest idea the security , speed , bandwidth , strength , computational and networking resources a banking system for a first world country needs ? 
  the number of io operations ? 
   and ** we were ready to ** get the green light from the pm when the banks closed in order to move into the general secretariat of public revenues , which is not controlled by us but is controlled by brussels , and to ** plug this laptop in and to energize the system . 
  ** i hope this laptop had a l33t-style cli with greenish windows : vman@uberlaptop ~ $ energize alternative banking system ? 
  [ y/n ] vman@uberlaptop ~ $  y vman@uberlaptop ~ $ please insert master password : vman@uberlaptop ~ $  fuckschauble2015 vman@uberlaptop ~ $ master password accepted vman@uberlaptop ~ $ [ = = = = ] 30 % completed vman@uberlaptop ~ $ [ = = = = = = = = = ] 60 % completed vman@uberlaptop ~ $ [ = = = = = = = = = = = =  100 % completed vman@uberlaptop ~ $ system fully energized and operational :d, 
   ** i appointed a good friend of mine ** , a childhood friend of mine who had become professor of it at columbia university in the states and so on . 
  i put him in because i trusted him to develop this . 
   at some point , a week or so after we moved into the ministry , he calls me up and says to me : you know what ? 
  i control the machines  so i authorised him - and you ca n't tell anyone that , this is totally between us ... we decided to ** hack into my ministry 's own software ** program in order to be able break it up ** to just copy the code of the tax systems website onto a large computer in his office ** so that he can work out how to design and ** implement this parallel payment system ** so he granted an old pal ** physical , unsupervised access to greece 's tax system dbs ** for him to freely tinker , to ** copy the data ** onto his personal computer ** and ** he entrusted him to develop and implement oh , just a full blown banking system for a first word economy with accounts tied to tax numbers and transfer systems between them . 
  no big deal . 
  the kind of thing you just call an old pal to implement in a few weeks . 
  a pair of python scripts on a few aws instances should do well , right ? 
  what ? 
  oh , a nasty glitch erased all money on greek accounts starting with 6 ? 
  that 's too bad , file a bug report . 
  two million euros are missing every monday at 00:00 ? 
  ~ ~ yeah i kno ~ ~ i mean , file a bug report ? 
  i refuse to believe anything of this . 
  or i seriously underestimated varoufakis naivety ... 
  wow , spain can into chemistry !, 
  how is the police not making millions in fines ?!, 
  here in my city we have a dedicated taxi/bus line and the police has these small smarts equipped with cameras and automatic plate recognition software that fines vehicles as it goes . 
  looking at the [ data ] ( http://i.imgur.com/e6pkt8z.png ) from the ine looks that the majority of the cases were related to drug use in the nineties . 
  bear in mind that the 0.3 % seems to be an accumulated total from 1981 to 2012 . 
  according to ine 's [ series ] ( http://www.ine.es/jaxi/tabla.do?path=/t15/a043/a1998/l0/&amp;file=s1003.px&amp;type=pcaxis&amp;l=0 ) : casos acumulados de sida ( 1 ) desde 1981 hasta 30 de junio de 2012 por ccaa de residencia , categor\u00eda de transmisi\u00f3n ( 2 ) y sexo . 
  this total number of accumulated cases is 82,009 people , which divided by some 45 millions is ~ 0.02 % . 
  op 's source is wikipedia and source for that is the cia factbook , which does n't specify a source , but i would say it 's close enough . 
  that the nobel foundation tries to sneak in with the the real prizes established by nobel so that they can keep that sweet endowment from the bank ... 
  the subtle detail of the korean dmz ... 
  you would be surprised !, 
  a lot of research in detecting fires from space !, 
  the fires as seen from space ( aqua satellite ) are [ here ] ( http://lance-modis.eosdis.nasa.gov/imagery/subsets/?subset=europe_3_03.2015198.aqua.500m.jpg ) ( true color ) and [ here ] ( http://lance-modis.eosdis.nasa.gov/imagery/subsets/?subset=europe_3_03.2015198.aqua.721.500m.jpg ) ( false color - you can see the burned extension better ) . 
  it 's kind of an egg and chicken situation : is the civil administration always skeptical because the citizens tend to cheat , or do the citizens cheat because following proper procedure is fruitless ? 
  from what i 've seen in my own country is kind of both : on one hand some people will lie to get benefits ( for example falsely claiming that they are emancipated in order to receive college grants ) , some people will declare the truth to the letter . 
  on the other hand , some administration officials/clerks will do everything in their hand to truly help you and do their work as best as humanely possible , but other seem to be in their post to only help themselves : chaining absences , permits , spending hours `` taking coffe '' ( that said , i have * never * seen money changing hands a la `` fakelaki '' nor i know anyone who has had to do so - i do n't know how prevalent this is in greece ? ) . 
  fortunately from what i seen , the `` open government '' mentality is slowly advancing , with more and more institutions enacting transparency and open data portals , extending online and `` one-stop shop '' procedures , and also interconnecting the different institutions as to not bothering you with redundant requests . 
  in response ( or driven by ? ), 
  the citizens are starting to care about government policies and how they can interact with the administration for their mutual benefit , so i hope it gets better in your country too !, 
  you forgot 10 idle people looking at the `` paleta '' !, 
  same here . 
  i know a case like this . 
  he made the first payment of a nice volkswagen eos with the grant , passed/went to 1 final exam ( to keep the money ) and then dropped uni . 
  ~ ~ but the germans are ruining us with austerity !!, 
   everyone has lied in this . 
  everyone . 
  i mean how the fuck is schauble still in office ... agree . 
   varoufakis at least has the excuse ... 
  they are still lies . 
  he feels entitled to lie to the public `` in their own benefit '' as if they were childs . 
   no politician , or central banker even , is ever going to announce `` hey guys , everyone panic !, 
  there is a difference between `` not saying x '' and `` saying not x '' . 
  i agree that announcing capital controls is stupid , but assuring that a capital control is not going to happen when you are in fact preparing one is despicable , at least to me . 
  then shut up and do n't blatantly lie . 
  have a smoke bomb ready if journos encircle you . 
  politicians knowingly lying should be an offense punishable by law as well . 
  on varoufakis , i think we can establish that he will bare faced lie if he thinks it 's useful : - ** `` there will no capital controls '' . 
  ** they were . 
  - ** `` the bank will open on ~ ~ monday ~ ~ tuesday after the referendum '' ** still closed . 
  - ** `` if oxi wins , we will have a better deal in 48h '' ** no .
