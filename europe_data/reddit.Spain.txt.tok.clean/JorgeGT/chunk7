  - ** `` grexit and ious are not being even discussed '' ** now he says he even proposed it . 
  - etc. 
  you can argue that these are white lies , useful lies , necessary lies , whatever . 
  but it is absolutely indisputable that the guy has no problem in telling ** blatant lies ** if he thinks they are useful for his agenda . 
  so i ca n't bring myself to trust anything he says from now on . 
   when will that be ? 
  he replied : `` on tuesday . '' ah , but see , he did n't specify ** which ** tuesday , delphi oracle style . 
  * when he woke up , christine lagarde was still there . 
  the biggest problem in applying mathematical modelling to the real world is the definition of the application domain . 
  in a mathematical context you can define your universe as being just this `` ideal '' room and these two `` ideal '' players . 
  or these two boxes containing gases if you 're talking thermodynamics , etc. 
  however , the real world is a chaotic system : tiny perturbations of the variables cause changes in a way that negates the possibility of accurately predicting the system state . 
  instead , the `` solution '' starts becoming more `` fuzzy '' as the time scale increases . 
  economy and weather are good examples of this . 
  both are planet-scale phenomena , as no true isolation can be applied to a smaller region . 
  that 's why you are able to predict a short time evolution if you consider a small region , but if considering macroscales , only approximate trends can be constructed : we can more or less determine that there 's a warming trend in a global scale , but we ca n't predict the weather of a certain city more than a few days before the `` fuzyness '' makes the prediction absolutely unreliable . 
  with economic of politics , a similar thing happens : we are more or less able to predict a positive or negative evolution of a certain market , but predictions of a certain company or product are only possible in the very short term . 
  that 's why there 's no algorithm that makes you rich , and even the most complicated financial neural networks are indistinguishable from chance even in very short timescales . 
  finally , considering game theory applied to economic policy , the application often fails because there are innumerable variables at play . 
  maybe the troika and the greeks could reach a solution beneficial to both , but the ramifications of that decision would reach spain , italy , portugal and so on ( * debt relief ? 
  * ) , and those possibilities must be included in the `` game '' . 
  then , the specific solutions for each country ramify again , maybe to baltic countries ( * we ca n't continue like this !, 
  * ) and then the branches extend again ... until the tree escapes any reasonable forecasting . 
  you ca n't isolate the greece problem , it 's not taking place in a paper sheet or a python script ; on the real world , the variables are the lives and hopes of people . 
  and watching tsipras/varoufakis grinning , i do n't know if they realize this . 
  oops !, 
  i always do !, 
  or i use those filled with anchovies :3 :3, 
   california of course , there 's [ a reason ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/viceroyalty_of_the_new_spain_1800_%28without_philippines%29.png/1280px-viceroyalty_of_the_new_spain_1800_%28without_philippines%29.png ) for that !, 
  man , some of these ...  representatives of big business are invited to participate in expert groups to influence new draft laws , even before these are discussed in the elected parliaments . 
  this undermines democracy !, 
  surely is better to have prime ministers wanting to '' [ ban encription on the internetz !, 
  ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/bruce-schneier-david-cameron-proposed-encryption-ban-destroy-the-internet-2015-7 ) '' , after all it 's `` a series of tubes '' . 
  it 's democracy !, 
   the negotiations are conducted in secret . 
  even our public representatives know little if anything about their progress . 
  they receive the results in the form of long agreements ( the ceta agreement , for example , has about 1,500 pages ) only after conclusion of the negotiations , and are therefore able only to either accept or reject the whole agreement without being able to ask for amendments . 
  that 's how nearly every other international trade treaty has been conducted ? 
  the negotiation committee agrees on a pact and the parliaments vote to accept or reject it in full . 
  a single parliament ca n't vote `` we accept points 1 , 7 and 28 '' of the treaty and reject the others '' . 
   liberalisation and privatisation are intended to become one-way streets . 
  the return of public utilities , hospitals , or waste collection to the public sector once they have been privatised would be made more difficult or even impossible through ceta and ttip . 
  and why is this bad ? 
  some of us want liberalisation of public monopolies . 
  in my city the public water and waste management public utility [ was riddled ] ( http://elpais.com/m/elpais/2011/11/30/inenglish/1322634042_850210.html ) with corrupt politicians that would allocate budget for luxury travels , loewe handbags , ipods , jewels , watches , escorts and whatnot , leaving a hole of more than 30 million $ in the public utility books . 
  but because it 's public , the utility ca n't declare bankruptcy , so now i have to pay for all of that in my water bill :d  the eu and its member states are falling under pressure to allow risky technologies such as fracking or gm technology . 
  oh no , not those evil gmos !, 
  we will shortly glow in the dark !, 
  do n't get me wrong , there 's a lot of thing in the ttip i do n't like ( isds for instance ) , and i do n't know if i will support it when i read the treaty in full , but some of these reasons are highly questionable and not self-evident at all !, 
  they will chase me if i forget a receipt for 5 $ in screws . 
  and to spend 10 k $ i have to get three budgets from three different providers , which is almost impossible for certain specialized equipment , so i have to obtain certificated waivers of that requirement instead , pray that some bored clerk in madrid does n't get picky ... and then people says we do n't care about how we spend your tax money !, 
  a few million ? 
  we have to write a long scientific proposal with 40 + citations , state of the art , methodology , hypothesis , previous work , joint ventures , detailed work plan , gantt chart , detailed budget , bom , etc. , to get like 160k $ from the government !, 
  and these people are like : `` we will * somehow * reduce early retirement by * some amount * , at * some point * in the future . 
  please , give a few billions , you greedy terrorists ? 
  you mean , when debtors [ could be slaved ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/slavery_in_ancient_greece#/a_specific_case:_debt_slavery ) if they did n't pay ? 
  when i take/prepare notes for a meeting ( to be conducted in english ) i write in english , so i do not have to translate the ideas / concepts / technical terms `` live '' so to speak . 
  but of course it could be for the show , like those uk `` aides '' that wave their papers in front on downing street photojournalists . 
  i do n't need to , i remember the story : a father had promised his little daughter that she could be a princess , so the only logical thing was to actually travel to bir tawil and proclaim himself king , so his daughter would be a princess . 
  awesome , 
  he is the lord of [ bir tawil ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/bir_tawil ) !, 
  it is , but take into account that at temperatures  36\u00bac , your body cooling mechanisms start to work in reverse ( instead of dumping body heat into the ambient , ambient heat is dumped into your body , by the 2nd law of thermodynamics ) .

  if anyone is curious : ** where do my euros come from ? 
  ** the 11 digit serial number on every note begins with a prefix which identifies which country issued it : german notes begin with an x , greek notes start with a y , spain 's have a v , france a u , ireland t , portugal m and italy s. belgium is z , cyprus g , luxembourg 1 , malta f , netherlands p , austria n , slovenia h , slovakia e and finland l. 
  oddly enough , it was used in spain a while ago .

  the iron bank will shortly cut the ela liquidity lifeline ? 
   it 's tagging along with the other prizes and have people confused more like the nobel foundation trying to blend the prize with the real nobels to keep hold of that sweet `` at perpetuity '' endowment from the sveriges riksbank . 
  true , but note that there 's no `` nobel prize for economics '' . 
  the culprits are always other people . 
  we live in the time of no personal responsibility . 
  exactly . 
  if i decided to stop proving clothes to my ( hypothetical ) child in winter because `` clothes are artificial '' or something and the kid died of pneumonia , i would be clearly prosecuted . 
  refusing to provide food , shelter and medical care for children is a crime !, 
  ho dubte molt , but they clearly should be ...

  correct . 
  being in arrears with the imf will surely mean no more justification to ela lifeline extensions by the ecb , so athens will be forced to provide some kind of money/ious . 
  yeah , ww4 is the sticks and stones one , right ? 
  praise our benevolent overlords !, 
  they are busy watching taxi drivers throw cinder blocks to passing cars !,

  austerity !, 
  can confirm . 
  also , it means that if you want to leave a company which is going south at age 40 , you can have hopes of being rehired . 
  people forgets that market security means that employers will be very hesitant to contract new workers , so workers will be very hesitant lo leave ( and their employers know and profit from this ) .
