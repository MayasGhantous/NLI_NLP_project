  of course there are descendants of expelled spaniard muslims unable to speak spanish . 
  i would glady repair this injustice by granting them nationality as well . 
  but how do we identify them ? 
  if a muslim family can trace their ancestors to 1492 or has any other form of proving that they indeed come from those expelled i think we should give them nationality as well . 
  but as far as i know , the only ethnic group that has managed to hold to that spanish heritage is the sepharadic jews . 
  if you think this is all a scam , ok . 
  but i think it 's , ahem , * curious * that you can assume that you know what we want , what we do n't , what we think and that we do n't think . 
  good afternoon !, 
  then they could apply , i believe !, 
  it is really curious to hear a language that sounds like old books and poems , 
  i think i have not explained myself clearly enough . 
  it is about an historic injustice which was committed against both ** jews and moriscos ** which were ** both ** unjustly expelled from their rightful homes . 
  this is the prevalent view in spain and the one which we learned in school . 
  we contrasted the multicultural integration and cooperation under [ alfonso x * the wise * ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/alfonso_x_of_castile ) and institutions like the [ toledo school of translators ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/toledo_school_of_translators ) ( operated by christians , muslims and jews ) with the religious extremism of the 1492 expulsion . 
  this cruel expulsion was not only terrible for them , but for many christians as well . 
  in lots of regions , expulsion of jews but specially moriscos left villages and towns partly uninhabited , and the economy was severely crippled . 
  friends , families , partners , etc. 
  were separated . 
  ** that said ** , today only a handful of sephardic jews have maintained the culture and spanish-like language of their ancestors , thus being the only group easily identifiable as directly descendants of those aggravated , which is why these measures are directed at them . 
  to my knowledge , no other ethnic group ( muslim or otherwise ) has maintained the knowledge of ancient spanish language 500 years after the expulsion , but if there was , i , and i 'm sure most spaniards as well , would defend as well their right to rightfully return home . 
  i believe they will test their knowledge of ladino , the old romance/spanish language the sephardic jews have maintained alive since their eviction 500 years ago . 
  are there mud\u00e9jar descendants whose [ primary language is still practically old spanish ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/judaeo-spanish ) ( to the point of mutual understanding with spanish speakers ) even 500 years after their eviction of the land ? 
  if they exist , i 'm all in favor of giving them nationality as well . 
  yes , but the sephardic jews ** still ** speak , write , sing etc. 
  in romance ( ladino ) . 
  where are the moriscos that still speak a romance language very similar to spanish to the point of mutual understanding ? 
  if they exist , i 'm in favor of giving them nationality as well !, 
  still , this is for people with penthouses or individual houses , which as you now are usually possessed by people with higher economic status . 
  people living in city flats ca n't access to this technology , yet their taxes would be used to selectively cut bills for certain other individuals . 
  similarly , loans are usually given to people who have the means to offer a collateral , and in any case you must have the economic means for the maintenance and replacement of components , which have a limited lifespan ( specially batteries which have a certain number of cycles before failure ) . 
  at the end , i think that only wealthy people end up installing this kind of setup , at least in my experience ( maybe is different in catalonia ? ) . 
  so i think individual home installations should not be funded by my taxes . 
  as you say , mobile phones or computers have become accessible to many people , and i seem to recall that the government has never funded with tax money my mobile phone or my computer . 
  i think he 's referring to spain as a whole , but specifically speaking of canary islands bugs , what about those fearsome giant , flying cockroaches ? 
  it 's like beta testing spain !, 
  no no , note that this map is about `` country of birth '' not `` citizenship '' ( that is a separate set of data , also available at the ine ) . 
  even if they got spanish citizenship they still show up . 
  the thing is , people from south america come from many countries but eastern europeans come primarily from romania so they `` get '' the color , even if there are more south americans than eastern europeans . 
  22.249 residents in the balearic islands were born in germany , according to the data , 
  i suppose , but it surprises me that switzerland is the most common . 
  i would have expected germany , or even argentina or brazil ( my galician side of the family still has `` cousins '' there ! ), 
  could you elaborate a bit more ? 
  comparison against total population ? 
  that would be interesting !, 
  but unfortunately as far as i 've seen eurostat only offers broad country-wide statistics ... 
  me when compiling the data : * switzerland ? 
   even if it costs money to use the grid from solar energy it should be paid for by tax payers ( assuming the cost is not ridiculous ) because it has a positive externality on the population . 
  the problem with this is that everyone pays taxes , but only high middle class / upper class people can afford the 10-20 .000 $ a good solar installation can cost ( panels + batteries + inverter + control + work + maintenance , not to mention a house with the space to host it , usually a chalet , villa , penthouse , etc. ) . 
  so with this approach , the majority of poor / average people is funding through taxes solar energy that cuts the power bills of those with high class homes and plenty of disposable income to invest , which looks , at least to me , pretty unjust . 
   i just hate the `` they 're charging us to use sunlight '' argument as it 's a more complicated issue than that . 
  `` i bought a car myself , and now they 're charging me to use the roads !, 
  but only if you 're generating power yourself , as i understand from the [ proposed legislation draft ] ( http://www.minetur.gob.es/energia/es-es/participacion/documents/proyecto-real-decreto-tramite-audiencia/20150601-rd-autoconsumo.pdf ) . 
  i fail to see where in the text standalone batteries in your home would be taxed . 
  it only speaks about `` autoconsumo '' ( selfgeneration ) installations , breaking them in categories depending how much power you can generate ( and there 's not a `` 0 kw generated '' category ) . 
  am i missing something ? 
  i 'm an engineer , so i can understand the complicated work required to balance the national power grid . 
  i support an electricity tax to cover the increased difficulty of the grid load balancing , as i support a gas tax to cover the cost of operating the highway system . 
  i * could * even support not paying small scale dumped energy , to discourage low efficiency generation . 
  ** however ** , i fail to see how you 're affecting the grid if you 're not generating nor dumping power , just installing a battery to ease your peak hours with the power you 've purchased at `` valley '' hours . 
  this , in fact , eases the work of the utilities as they would avoid spinning up so much the combined cycle power plants at peak hours . 
  am i missing something here ? 
  in any case , i 'm reading the [ proposed regulation draft ] ( http://www.minetur.gob.es/energia/es-es/participacion/documents/proyecto-real-decreto-tramite-audiencia/20150601-rd-autoconsumo.pdf ) , and i 'm failing to see how standalone batteries are being taxed . 
  as i 'm understanding , only installations that generate power are being taxed , not installations which do n't have generation or dumping capabilities , only storage . 
  again , i do n't know if i 'm missing something or if the articles are a result of poor journalism and tesla-clickbaiting . 
  search in google `` greece can pay its debts in full , but it wo n't '' and click the first link . 
  the paywall does n't activate if you 're coming from google . 
  do n't believe rtve . 
  it 's not the same without good ol' [ andorra ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andorra_in_the_eurovision_song_contest#voting_history ), 
  some people like it , some people hate it , some people want more autonomy , some people want a republic/confederation ... 
  currently the elected government in the basque country favors a referendum to decide . 
  however , note that modern basque nationalism as founded by sabino arana starts at [ the beginning of the xx century ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/es/historia_del_nacionalismo_vasco#/inicios_y_expansi.c3.b3n_del_nacionalismo_vasco_.281895.e2.80.931921.29 ) , while the basque country / navarra kingdom have been an integral part of spain for centuries . 
  in fact , a strong tradition of supporting the ( rightful for them ) spanish monarchy existed in those areas as the carlism movement ( their motto was * god , motherland , king * , later adapted by nationalist founding father sabino arana into * god and old law * ) . 
  they fought alongside dictator francisco franco in the civil war , and their hymn ( the [ * oriamendi * ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/es/marcha_de_oriamendi ) ) was one of the three official `` national marchs '' alongside fascist * cara al sol * and monarchic * royal march * . 
  so , as with lots of things in spain , it 's not a simple black and white question . 
  of course !, 
  we live in an incredibly wonderful time if after endless wars and hatred , a british can cheer for european federation in perfect spanish :d, 
  compare huelva and bilbao . 
  different languages , different weather , food , traditions , culture , economic and social situation ... yet , a long history of pulling together , like in the republic whose flag you wear , 
  as in [ primary ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/primary_school ) and [ secondary ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/secondary_education ) education . 
  as opposed to an institution which imparts [ tertiary ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/higher_education ) education . 
  i meant `` english * college * '' as in the term * community college * of the english language , not specifically the uk term . 
  hope it does makes sense ? 
   uh , teacher , my word equations are all garbled ( or they show as images ) . 
  also , this powerpoint i prepared at home with mom 's computer is totally messed up =(, 
  correct , it 's an awful translation : spanish * colegio * = english * school * ** not ** english * college * ( also , even a college is not an university ... ) . 
  this is a small religious boarding school for ages 3 - 18 . 
  great journalism , uh ?

  :p as succintly explained by an user of the [ infosec stack exchange ] ( http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/30876/can-android-phone-running-without-sim-card-be-tracked-localized-by-police ) :  [ a handset can ] scan the gsm bands to find the bcchs ( broadcast control channels ) of the available base stations . 
  on these channels , the base station transmits all necessary data required by the handset to contact the network , in particular the rach ( random access channel ) used by the handset to initially contact the base station . 
  if the handset is not interested in registering itself with the network ( for which a sim is required ) , it remains passive . 
  if you try to make an emergency call , the handset will request this on the most suitable rach . 
  the ecall will only passively sniff [ bcchs ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/broadcast_control_channel ) which are being broadcasted , without any handshake until a crash occurs . 
  see [ my comment here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/349f84/european_cars_will_automatically_call_emergency/cqsnxjc ) - they are disconnected until a crash is registered .
