  you should n't ... **  the public pan european 112 ecall in-vehicle system ( ivs ) remains dormant ( that means not connected to the mobile phone networks ) until a serious accident happens , therefore no tracking or transmission of data takes place during the normal operation of the system . 
  ** only when a serious accident takes place , the information contained in the minimum set of data ( msd ) is transmitted ** to the public safety answering point ( psap ) . 
   the data included in the msd are those strictly needed by the emergency services to handle the emergency situation , and may include the triggering mode ( automatic or manual ) , the vehicle identification number , vehicle type and propulsion , timestamp , vehicle direction , current and previous positions , and number of passengers . 
   these data are transmitted and stored by the psap in compliance with the relevant legislation on personal data & consumer protection . 
  psap are used to deal with personal data respecting citizens ' privacy in the course of their normal operations in accordance with european and national legislation ( e.g. , when citizens call to the single european emergency number , 112 )  ** while in normal operation the ecall ivs is not registered to any telecommunications network . 
  registration and voice/data communications take place only in case of an accident . 
  during its normal operation , the ivs may only scan the radio spectrum for available networks , but without communicating with the mobile network operators ( mnos ) . 
  ** no intermediate parties ( including the mnos ) have access to the msd that is transmitted from the ivs to the psaps .

   did you know that the word health organization has classified glyphosate as a probably carcinogen ? 
  yes , [ in the same group ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_iarc_group_2a_carcinogens ) as working as a hairdresser , on night shifts or eating red meat . 
  do you support a ban in hairdressers , night shifts , and red meat ? 
  not nearly as eerie as the [ black arrow ] ( https://youtu.be/m4uwykpxuvy?t=41 ) . 
  [ for those wondering . 
  the average electric vehicle is much more expensive than their thermal engine counterparts , so i feel that these subsidies are payed by everyone ( through taxes ) and enjoyed only by the wealthy people that can afford one of these cars . 
  if anything , it seems like reverse wealth redistribution . 
  -- [ examples from vw ] ( http://i.imgur.com/omw0xgx.png ) : * traditional golf ( ~ 20k $ ) vs. purely electric golf ( ~ 37k $ ) vs. hybrid golf ( ~ 40k $ ) * traditional up !, 
  ( ~ 12k $ ) vs. electric up !, 
  ( ~ 28k $ ) i seriously doubt that a person who was browsing 15-20 k $ cars will jump to the 30-40 k $ segment ( double the price ) for a subsidy of 3-4 k $ . 
  more likely , people who already was browsing 40k $ cars ( i.e. 
  relatively wealthy people ) will receive a nice gift from the taxpayers . 
  i too miss top gear ... 
  they have been postponing the launch for a few days in a row so when it finally happened i missed it . 
  yep , red meat consumption [ is in the same category ] ( http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2015/pdfs/pr240_e.pdf ) ( group 2a ) and i do n't see any `` ban red meat '' campaign . 
   a 2013 systematic review by the german institute for risk assessment ( bfr ) examined epidemiological studies , animal studies , and in vitro studies . 
  it found that `` no classification and labelling for carcinogenicity is warranted '' and did not recommend a carcinogen classification of either 1a or 1b . 
  it 's the german bundesinstitut f\u00fcr risikobewertung [ that concluded ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glyphosate#government_and_organization_positions ) it is safe .

   there 's awfully sunny in spain today ... not a single cloud [ i wish :\\ ( ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qgodfnj.jpg ), 
   the cargo transported by the trucks is mainly food , medical supplies , school books and other essentials this remembers me how the finns invented the molotov cocktail . 
  soviet minister molotov claimed that cluster munition bombs being dropped on finland were humanitarian food deliveries , so the finns started to call them `` bread baskets '' . 
  later , when the land invasion started , the finns helpfully reciprocated with the molotov cocktail as `` a drink to go along with molotov 's food '' . 
  yep , a colegio . 
  it was only a few years ( 5 or so ) ago ; when i attended uniforms were only mandatory on days with phy ed class . 
  the school is located on a somewhat poor area of the city , and the logic behind the decision was that uniforms are cheap ( you need two or at most three to cover for the entire week ) and prevent kids mocking those with outdated/non-brand clothes . 
   having said this , there are some elements and values that indeed are shared by all . 
  windows with * persianas * , the true essence of the spanish identity . 
   public schools do n't require it though . 
  not necessarily true , the school board ( consejo escolar ) of a public school can decide to require uniforms . 
  source : my old school did , a few years ago . 
  i know a guy who does this with spanish oranges . 
  his business consists solely of a cell phone and a contact list , not even an office . 
  i would indeed prefer a spanish vessel named * admiral nelson * ( who was by all accounts a great sailor and a great professional ) that * barquito caradeb\u00e1rquez * or whatever the translation of * boaty mcboatface * is !, 
  they have always been shady people ( where did all the money for almost daily lawsuits come from ?! ), 
  but the coincidence in time with the trial of the king 's sister , who is only indicted because of them and could be absolved if they are made to drop their accusation ... 
  in fact he is only mentioned briefly in the panam\u00e1 papers , the most compromising documents ( in the sense that they contradicted his poor excuses ) that appeared in subsequent days were related to uk and jersey companies , as seen in [ this handy chart ] ( http://s2.eestatic.com/2016/04/14/actualidad/entramado-soria_117249664_3662407_1706x960.jpg ) .

  in 1979 , a certain russian jewish called mikhail brin [ emigrated from the soviet union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sergey_brin#early_life_and_education ) , tired of fighting against these policies discriminating jews in soviet academia . 
  his son sergey and a friend called larry would end co-founding a promising start-up called google . 
  truckers are not `` employees '' of the french wine-importing company , they are independent contractors that own a truck and haul whatever they are contracted to haul to earn a living in a country with +20 % unemployment . 
  yet these french farmers attack the livelihood of poor workers like them instead of the headquarters of the french importing company . 
  maybe because the riot police would * then * do something to them ? 
  better attack spanish truck workers trying to feed their families right ? 
  so much for international working class solidarity ... 
  then why french ** workers ** attack spanish ** workers ** instead of french ** companies ** ? 
   a flag is the most important distinctive symbol of the country which emphasizes the importance of its achievements , history , nature and culture . 
  in our case the king was offered [ some designs ] ( http://www.vexilologia.org/bandera/propuestas1785.jpg ) , and just chose the one he liked the most . 
  if he would have placed his royal finger two rows below we would have been a nordic country according to this article . 
  same in spain , i knew it is a unit of weight , but have never used it in that sense , nor i know how many kg an * arroba * of something weights . 
  with 78 % of the calls , turkey definitely has a crush on sweden !, 
  but you can make an anonymous poll of a small population sample and have a very good idea of the languages spoken , you do n't need to record the language of every single person . 
  it 's the same with electoral polls , you do n't record the political stance of everyone in a database . 
  this is how in my country we maintain statistics of languages spoken , religion professed , political party , etc.

  it 's the same with electoral polls , you do n't record the political stance of everyone in a database . 
  this seems to me similar to fight against encryption . 
  again and again terrorists have relied upon cheap disposable cell phones and plain text communication , not on encryption . 
  again an again , these terrorists use military-grade automatic weapons smuggled into europe , not properly licensed semi-automatic hunting weapons . 
  maybe he did n't commit tax fraud , just avoided public disclosure of his assets . 
  it may not be a crime in iceland , just a fatal loss of political confidence . 
  they are not to scale , [ uk parliament ] ( http://www.orangenews9.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/uk-parliament.jpg ) is much smaller than the [ european parliament ] ( http://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/10/05/15/europeanparliament.jpg ) and they have the same height in the graph . 
  that 's why our anthem lyrics are the most fitting !, 
  at least they are true to the very spirit of our \u00bf beloved ? 
  country :d, 
  it really did n't end up without lyrics , it was without lyrics from the start as it was just a very old march that used to be played for the kings in public events , and it slowly became the * de facto * national anthem when those became a thing . 
  there were some initiatives to give the march some lyrics . 
  the francoist version was in fact adapted from the earlier jose mar\u00eda pem\u00e1n version ( some verses were changed to add some fascist meanings ) but the original 1928 is not so bad as far as national anthems go . 
  however , we spaniards have n't ever agreed on which lyrics are the best so it remains at it started , instrumental only . 
  ^ ^ and , ^ ^ after ^ ^ all ... ^ ^ is n't ^ ^ that ^ ^ the ^ ^ most ^ ^ spanish ^ ^ thing ^ ^ ever ? 
  now do `` countries whose national anthem does n't mention anything ! '',
