  not so much what they specifically offer , but what they have to offer . 
  i 'd love bulk discounts and such , plus their hot dogs and such are apparently great . 
  plus reddit seems to be all over it , so it could n't hurt to have it around europe ? 
  wish there was a costco in there . 
  ohhh , thanks for that !, 
  been really interested in learning about india . 
  if i may ask , are you hindu or of another lingustic/ethnic group ? 
  sounds like france on usual business . 
  how did the french react ? 
  no no , you see comrade ? 
  one big lenin the size of skyscrapers and many plaza with many smaller lenin . 
  works !, 
  probably follow in suit with ukraine and march away from russia . 
  might not be like ukraine , but they 'll try their damndest . 
  they want a better future , not a russian oligarchy . 
  and we wo n't get accession if we have corrupt fucks like edrogan in power . 
  people like him are reactionary and frankly will take us back to ottoman times . 
  either we stand in solidarity against him and march to the eu , or fade into obscurity as a sharia backwater . 
  the sub-committee of lenin-to-citizen ratio has concluded taht there must be at least a 4:100,000 ratio at all times . 
  good show , sir !, 
  a superb argument !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ joking , ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ being ^ ^ ^ ^ an ^ ^ ^ ^ ass . 
  ca n't be worse than being mugged in paris by a guy with a nerf sword . 
  jihadists in finland are even dumber than that guy that tried to hijack a plane with a chocolate bar . 
  and yet your government continues to demonize gb over a small rock in the middle of the ocean . 
  have you seen that cartoon they made ? 
  you got wrecked , and your government is going authoritarian over it . 
  do you even america , m8 ? 
  ^ ^ ^ how ^ ^ ^ does ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ feel ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ be ^ ^ ^ america 's ^ ^ ^ buttplug ? 
  the glorious people 's republic of czechslovakistan !, 
  more like your ikea imperialism destroying all our hardworking furniture economies !, 
  will we finally get occitania formed and brittany back ? 
  too bad you got wrecked by britain . 
  that one tiny-ass island right next to newfoundland ? 
  and i think anyone inside the paris region . 
  shhh , your silly lusitanian cultures can not defeat our superior catalan culture . 
  oi m8 i wuz raised in glasgow , lets fukin ' fight on the playground u kunt . 
  how do you guys feel about the lisbon regicide ? 
  i just ... wha ... how . 
  what in the actual fuck ? 
  [ i am revving my imperialism engines for the glorious union of hellas and t\u00fcrkiye . 
  ] ( http://gamerlimit.com/files/2012/06/my-body-is-ready.png ), 
  care to elaborate ? 
  ( \u0ca0 \u035c\u0296 \u0ca0 ) brother , time draws near for us to claim hellas once more . 
  from his comment karma and how he acts , this is one deep-cover troll . 
  they made the mistake of not being fc barcelona . 
  why was fc madrid here and not fc barcelona ? 
  this is travesty !, 
  as much as i 'm a prude with comedy , my lungs are in pain with how much i laughed . 
  i love you , norris . 
  samus , stop acting like you 're not one of us . 
  we told you time and time again , * everyone * knows you 're one of us . 
  did n't your clutch momma teach you right ? 
  it 's the reptilian jewish infiltrators here to steal all your baguettes and fancy painting to fuel their nwo illuminati agenda for galactic domination with the sith . 
  ` wise men speak because they have something to say ; fools because they have to say something . ', 
  the cdu must be one hell of a ride that never ends . 
  we can do our own grunt work , thank you very much . 
  more like a plutocratic oligarchy headed by big vladdy p. 
  because greenland * is * an nearly inhabitable rock of depression and alcohol . 
  give catalonia your delicious fisheries , norway !, 
  we 'll call it an elf . 
  the cup has some very enticing promises , and they really threw the ball out of the park . 
  very agreeable with your points , too . 
  but the party just feels extremely ... off . 
  anti-capitalism ? 
  those points make me think they 'd do far more harm than good for us . 
  on the point , they want to completely scrap nuclear energy for alternatives . 
  to me , that 's a big no-no , we still have * plenty * of possibilities with nuclear energy . 
  ugh , why do they feel so enticing , but also worry me !, 
  we got the harrier . 
  that 's actually a bit shocking , considering their position in catparla, 
  he 's a troll , mate . 
  nah , lets go fight the russians . 
  this is clearly lacking in bricks , might i suggest you buy some more ? 
  basque architecture is so ... pleasingly rustic in a sense . 
  feels like a good break from the stuff we got in catalonia . 
  [ like our lizard statue . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/reptil_parc_guell_barcelona.jpg ), 
  want some more bricks , portugal ? 
  pretty much he 's doing some pretty decent social engineering . 
  what 's going on over in netherlands ? 
  may we build a burn ward in anatolia ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ also , ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ love ^ ^ ^ ^ your ^ ^ ^ ^ flair . 
  is this why people mock the welsh ? 
  all the sensationalism !, 
  yellow journalism !, 
  do n't feed the troll , check his flair . 
  a game of shitsmearing . 
  but there 's some like / u/white _ europa who 's a troll !, 
  twists and turns in the game of racism . 
  i see , thank you for taking your time to tell me . 
  so they employed tzeentch to the propaganda division ? 
  i thought they were always friends with north korea ... 
  what was your market ? 
  genuinely curious , considering i run two shops over here in catalonia . 
  i kinda have n't had any negative experience , since i inherited my store . 
  but when the church starts calling for its people to vote against the party advocating for gay rights and such , what can you do ? 
  it seems like a constant stalemate between the church trying to pin down and the government trying to be forceful . 
  can we have a racist bingo for r/europe ? 
  i 'm completely agreeing with you .
