  hell , you guys have what ? 
  55 ~ languages officially recognized by the state ? 
  it 's simply amazing to see people say it does n't work , when all you need to do is point at india . 
  and i 'm not saying india 's greater than any other , but it has a point to show . 
  and yet people assume china would come in and help russia on a whim . 
  really doubtful because china has far more investment in the west than russia itself . 
  it 'd be more beneficial to either support the west or no one at all . 
  people seem to forget china and russia are ** not ** friends . 
  ever since the sino-soviet split , they 've been cold as fuck between eachother . 
  and it 's sure as hell not going to change anytime soon . 
  5000 old tanks wo n't last when a-10 's come strafing and the ucav 's come knocking . 
  [ oh right ] ( http://www.thinkspain.com/news-spain/21407/same-sex-marriage-is-still-legal-as-rajoys-appeal-is-rejected ) because clearly i 'm a god damn liar . 
  even if he has n't done it in this year , does n't mean he 's scott free . 
  it 's better to integrate with a country you understand than just being thrown in . 
  it helps with people who barely understand the country get along better . 
  if you have a better solution , let me hear it . 
  we 'll toss them up and take lisbon !, 
  just you wait !, 
  no , you 're coming with us whether you like it or not !, 
  now pack your bags and get ready for mr. 
  bone 's wild ride !, 
  agreed . 
  we 're doing it the right way , or not at all . 
  as much as it 'd cause hell for the euro and potentially causing a meltdown in spain , our country is moving forward without them . 
  we have one of the best cities in all of europe , a strong economy , well-defined people . 
  only issue is ciu , they 're still pp fucks . 
  how do we resolve this ? 
  spoken like a true historian . 
  hooray for extremism ruining everything !, 
  if we can get a strong leader in power , one that 's impartial and actually competent at his job , that idea can be realized . 
  though that 's relatively impossible unless we get equal representation from each culture/nation . 
  a pan-iberian federation would probably do so much wonders . 
  maybe if we get economic/political reformers from scandinavia to help , it could work too . 
  breaking news !, 
  uk to collapse with the potential independence !, 
  but first , how fifty million bulgarians will invade london !, 
  breaking news !, 
  yellow journalism is still yellow journalism , just with a dash of populism now !, 
  oh , not any more but he was focusing on it hard enough . 
  now the problem is that the people 's party is in power . 
  they 're considerably a threat to catalan , castilian , basque , etc. 
  interests and a threat to spain 's economy . 
  at this rate , spain 's still a train wreck of corruption . 
  we need a method to resolve this and keep us from ending up into a broken backwater in the middle of the ass-end of europe . 
  and at this rate , rajoy 's government is just fueling basque/catalan nationalism . 
  unless we get someone with actual balls , this is trending towards ` hell on wheels ' . 
  a pan-european integration plan would work wonders . 
  immigrants are given temporary housing , maybe communal . 
  having them alternate their days between working and learning about the country they 're going to . 
  help them deprogram and integrate much more smoothly into the union . 
  have them understand laws , culture , etiquette , etc. 
  it 'd be a slow system , but it 'd assure stability and integration . 
  i 'd like to believe he 's just the vatican 's butt buddy . 
  i 'm honestly sick of spain , would absolutely love an iberia that is n't shit . 
  but nope , more of this right-wing shit going on just makes me hate madrid more and more . 
  bloody hell , man . 
  when will this conga train end ? 
  oi mate , can i borrow a few shillings for some cigs ? 
  go to sweden , they 'll take anyone in with open arms . 
  and do n't worry about him bro , he 's a troll . 
  seems like it . 
  do n't feed the trolls , their bites are filled with bacteria that makes you sick . 
  dunno why you 're being downvoted , but it 's 11 too many in this union . 
  do n't forget rajoy tried to ban it ... 
  * again . 
  it would suck if suddenly the [ ttta ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trans-tasman_travel_arrangement ) was thrown out and you had to go through the entire process . 
  definitely would leave people stranded in australia and new zealand who are a citizen of their respective countries . 
  oh , you want to come to new zealand , aussie ? 
  passport , visa , customs , and searching your butthole for c4 . 
  that 'd be the shittiest thing ever , even with how close the two are . 
  applying that to europe is a god damn clusterfuck . 
  [ ] ( / lpmintals `` praise the sun ! '' ), 
  i nominate / u/bezbojnicul as our future european overlord . 
  cameron is a giant fucking twat , it 's guaranteed he 'll want to opt-out because of muh britain . 
  yes , i know . 
  i was making a joke !, 
  walt did n't make disneyland for those damn commies . 
  so slapping gypsies , enjoying your time there , and yelling which football club is better ? 
  * breaking news !, 
  lynched australian pm thrown out of hell !, 
  satan says ` fuck your shit , i do n't want him down here !, 
  * breaking news !, 
  tony abbott declares tax hike on all alcohol !, 
  australians rioting from sydney to melbourne !, 
  wow , you do n't say ? 
  the past two years of heavy-handed crackdowns are just now being reported !, 
  rajoy 's government declares it illegal and pisses off more people . 
  that 's how it 'll go . 
  [ this is glorious !, 
  we may see eachother , or not . 
  i will be looking for the lone belgian waffle in a sea of tourists !, 
  [ we 's a real country , whatchu on about girl ?
