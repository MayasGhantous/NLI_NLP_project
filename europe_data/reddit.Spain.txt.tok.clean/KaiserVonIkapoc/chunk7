  thanks for the clarifications . 
  i thought any eu nation had access to making deals with non-eu states before . 
  must 've missed that info somewhere . 
  it would seem to be an easily exploitable reason for the ukip . 
  how can we resolve this ? 
  putting on the reich * before * hitler was mainstream . 
  it stops when the hitler train derails . 
  whoever danyxp is , if they 're in this subreddit right now , know that you have made a person extremely jealous of that delicious near-1gb of download . 
  contraceptives are top dollar !, 
   they bemoan that the uk is not allowed to agree these deals with key commonwealth markets precisely because it is in the eu . 
  so ... they 're whining about the fact they ca n't do their own deals instead of benefiting the union as a whole ? 
  wow . 
  all in all , i hope the uk becomes part of a european federation . 
  ca n't have europe without you the queen !, 
  from the recent spate , it looks like it 'd be pro-eu and pro-uk in terms of ` brexit ' and the scottish refrendum . 
  just two months away for the latter and the polls showed a larger pro-union , anti-independence view than before . 
  the thing is that the uk has untapped markets . 
  a deal between the commonwealth of nations and the european union would go a long way to bolstering trade relations . 
  lots of african markets opening up along side the stabilization of the country . 
  mix that with india and a strongly united federal europe , and we can trump the us in being the largest economy in the world . 
  by right , 2013 showed the eu as having 17.371 trillion in gdp together to the united states 16.799 trillion * . 
  a unified , federal europe with a strong central government , well-regulated and well-oiled economy , and a strong democracy would go a long way for us . 
  * taken from the [ 2013 imf report on selected country groups ] ( / http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2014/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=71&amp;pr.y=15&amp;sy=2013&amp;ey=2013&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=001%2c998%2c901%2c511&amp;s=ngdpd&amp;grp=1&amp;a=1 ), 
  russians can make the ak-47 , but they ca n't make a car that does n't look like a box . 
  i 'd love for the uk to stay in the eu to the letter , but the public seems to keep wavering on either ` associate ' status like norway or complete withdrawl . 
  i think it 's borne from a lack of understanding or having an idea what the eu actually does . 
  i mean , from the brits i 've met none have said their education included the eu . 
  if the eu had an education course for all members at least , it 'd hopefully spread how the eu properly works . 
  it 's a daunting subject due to the complexity of the inner workings and treaties . 
  however , it 's one of the greatest initiatives our continent has ever undertaken . 
  from two millennia of war to what is now the most unified european state in the world . 
  it 's a fucking milestone we need to keep going , despite all of our troubles . 
  we need a gluing factor and a hard , scrutinizing look at our members . 
  we ca n't afford to be disunited to self-interest , we need compassion and unity . 
  do you guys even have educational courses on the european union , if i may ask ? 
  i 've seen a trend with some eurosceptic brits saying some generally misinformed info on the eu . 
  also , that 's a bit worrying . 
  are the tories just that stupid or are they wanting to commit political suicide ? 
  crusader kings 2 ? 
  you mean the habsburg simulator ? 
  the issue is when they try to instate pro-sharia in a country ruled by national law . 
  there are still immigrants who try to put religious law above their patron countries laws . 
  and that 's a problem big time . 
  nothing wrong with adhering to your religious laws but do n't expect to come here and be able to pervert the order of law . 
  it 's frankly insulting and wrong . 
  the issue is that islam has * a lot * of sects . 
  an example is the [ wahhabi movement ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wahhabi_movement ) , which is a pretty hardcore even for some of the other extremists . 
  notably their anti-clerical efforts are pretty heineous . 
  another is their neoconservative tendencies against social injustice or the poor-wealthy gap . 
  the [ muslim brotherhood ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muslim_brotherhood ) is another one , who promote [ qutbism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/qutbism ) . 
  it 's virtually a jihadist movement to advance islam across the board . 
  they 're pro-sharia , anti-social democracy , conspiracy theorist , and all sorts of insanity in a can . 
  oh , and in tradition they 're anti-west and anti-semitic . 
  now , there 's always extreme sects in the islamic world . 
  this would be similar to a second crusade as more muslims practice these anti-west or anti-left ideologies . 
  they 're really not happy with the west due to the colonial era . 
  there 's plenty of muslims who are moderate or liberal . 
  it tends to mellow out the longer they 're exposed to western culture . 
  the issue is self-segregation of certain people that cause some of the issues we see . 
  they do n't want western culture , they want to keep theirs while disrespecting the nation . 
  though this is generalized due to its diversity , the [ ahmadiyaa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ahmadiyya ) are a point . 
  some of their beliefs are peaceful preaching if their views of islam . 
  notably they consider the jihad to be spread by the pen and not the word . 
  another part has multiple definitions of jihad , most of which are peaceful sans one : * jihad al-asghar * , which preaches self-defense if your right to worship is being persecuted to an extreme . 
  the worst you might find is them being a bit too pushy in their religion , but they wo n't scream at you . 
  the thing is that it 's not the religion that defines them , but the sect . 
  the more western a muslim becomes , the more secular and ` irreligous ' they become . 
  it 's a matter of * where * they immigrated from you need to factor in . 
  hope this helps !, 
  ( aaand fucking downvoted for no reason ! ), 
  ** muh racist genetics !, 
  stormfront has been known to [ send brigadiers ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1w3fnr/seems_we_are_important_enough_for_stormfront_to/ ) and racists to our area ever since we noticed it . 
  it 's not hard to make connections but they 're common in their attempts to sway their glorious white pure europa ( tm ) comrades to their case !, 
  these guys are either complete trolls or trying to incite shit in here . 
  usually you 'd find them as preaching how multiculturalism has caused all our social ills because we allow immigrants . 
  now and then someone spews how cultures or genes play factor in it . 
  usual anti-intellectual bullshit by people who have no idea what they 're talking about . 
  you can borrow my gold polish . 
  of course !, 
  do n't you know that the jews are the root cause of ** all ** our social ills along side those dirty muslim bastards taking over our glorious european white culture !? 
  you 're a good guy , psy . 
  we need more of your kind to help smash down racists and xenophobes . 
  remember to message the mods about them when you can !, 
  goes a long way since just reporting wo n't do too much . 
  can i spray you down in golden bullshit ? 
  i am ready for the golden shower !, 
  europe is our motherland , i declare it today . 
  [ where is your evidence ? 
  ] ( https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/anecdotal ), 
  we 're gon na sneak into your hague and steal your european culture !, 
  stormfront is lurking . 
  you can feel the racism and xenophobia around every corner . 
  their saltiness fuels my anti-fascism harder . 
  last time i ever got gold was a year ago , i ai n't no forty-niner . 
  at first i was downvoting up above , then i realized my mistake and began upvoting you again . 
  this shit is getting too cray-cray . 
  where 's reasonability when we 're being assaulted by xenophobes and neo-nazi 's ? 
  remember , kids !, 
  multiculturalism is the root cause of all evil in europe and should be removed !, 
  up until it encounters its greatest enemy , the european robin .
