erdogan i of the erddogan empire, 
  that wound will never heal . 
  now , that 's just fear mongering . 
  it 's the equivalent of saying : `` oh , sure , you can build the dam . 
  but do n't come crying when it breaks down and y' all drown ! '' . 
  pure , baseless fear mongering . 
  eh , i 'd say you 've got time . 
  it 's slowly fading away , but i give it another generation or two until it 's completely phased out . 
  [ beautiful . ], 
  ( http://reactiongifs.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/vladimir-putin-laughing.gif ), 
  and the rumours . 
  oh , the rumours . 
  `` this ebola thing was just an experiment go wrong !, 
  '' , `` there 's no cure because it 's a mix of a bunch of diseases !, 
  '' , `` they do n't want to tell us , but we 're all infected already !, 
  '' , `` why did they bring those people here ? 
  this country is doomed ! '', 
  for a moment there , i felt like i was in the stereotypical american deep south . 
  this whole thing is kinda freaking me out a little . 
  not because of the ebola itself , mind you . 
  but because of the gross sanitary mishandling at almost every level . 
  imagine if we were dealing with something much more easily spread . 
  what the fuck are you doing in europe if you 're pro-isis ? 
  blows my mind that people can be this bloody hypocritical . 
  can anyone think of those poor pseudoterrotists ? 
  i say we let them come back to the place they hated so much they chose to travel to dumbfuckistan to join a glorified gang !, 
  nah , but in all seriousness , fuck those guys . 
  but that 's part of the fun !, 
  will you survive without incidents ? 
  will your water chip die after 10 years ? 
  will you be part of some weird society where blowjobs are currency ? 
  who knows !? 
  everything is possible with vault-tec !, 
  i , for one , want to see the reverse anschluss . 
  heh , i love this thread so much . 
  let 's see here ... spain : all tourists welcome !, 
  ... hope you 're good at pantomiming , tho . 
  number 1 !, 
  number 1 !, 
  number 1 !, 
  they 're freaking thirteen , they have just discovered the concept of boners , nevermind understanding the concept of terrorism ... 
  i 'm pretty sure fatima is an arabic name . 
  it 's just kinda popular in the spanish-speaking world because [ reasons ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/umayyad_conquest_of_hispania ) . 
  same for guadalupe and soraya . 
  wow , this guy seems * really * freaking bitter ... sucks to be him . 
  fair enough , i suppose i understand your point . 
  though the same could be said for people until around their mid-20 's . 
  and it could be argued that 16 year olds are allowed to join the army ( with parental consent ) , drive ( at 17 ) and work , so they should n't be underrepresented either . 
  let 's be honest for a minute here , the average voter does n't make an `` educated decision '' for whom to vote for . 
  most follow simple raw gut feeling , while many others follow a simple sense of `` tradition '' , very few of them actually make informed decisions , so it is the same if they voted at 16 , 18 , 21 or 40 . 
  it is completely arbitrary whether to draw the line at 16 or 18 . 
  well , i was expecting that number to be much higher ... why does belgium has so much debt compared to it 's neighbours , though ? 
  oh , for sure . 
  i went to the uk just for around two months over the winter , i have never , * ever * missed sunshine so much . 
  [ seriously ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehgnxbp_jwc ) . 
  i actually tried to do an entire playthrough with serbia in eu3 with that in the background . 
  i 'm ... 
  i 'm pretty sure that song is still the background for my nightmares . 
  i think the coins are pretty nice . 
  they 're eye-catching and ( normally ) pretty clear about what country they 're from . 
  the bills not so much ... and that 's weird , because most of our countries had generally pretty-looking money . 
  did n't watch it 'till the end ... 
  it 's still kind of wasteful , though . 
  could 've been much shorter . 
  i figured it was going to talk about the security features , how to recognize fake ones or whatever ... nope , it 's just an average commercial ... that 's ... nice , i guess ? 
  ... what was the purpose of this again ? 
  welp , nothing much interesting on my front . 
  xvideos at 22 ( expected it higher ) . 
  and obviously marca on top of el pais and el mundo , that 's just predictable ... 
  they just wan na have a space `` reserved '' beforehand . 
  it 's not a german specific thing , most tourist do it , the germans just seem to get up the earliest ... 
  it 's also pretty shitty to `` reserve '' a space you 're not gon na use any time soon ... 
  i mean , it 's pretty normal for people to `` reserve '' spaces at 6 am and then go to sleep and wake up 4 or 5 hours later to claim the damn chair . 
  it 's pretty assholish . 
  they all live in solid gold cabins , though . 
  if you guys are n't hard working , then how come there are so many holes in our beaches ? 
  check mate , ~ ~ atheists ~ ~ diligent people . 
  now , if you 'll excuse me , it 's almost siesta time . 
  again . 
  * visit now !, 
  where is albert einstein when you need him ? 
  as far as i know , `` musulm\u00e1n '' ( muslim ) is only really used for practitioners of the religion . 
  most of everyone uses \u00c1rabe ( duh ) to refer to the ethnic group/s from the region . 
  maybe it 's different in other languages , but i 'd call op an arab , not a muslim . 
  i think there 's either no information on them , or the percentages were lower than 20 % either way , it 's kind of funny in a sad way : `` turkey ? 
  fuck no , i do n't wan na go there ! '', 
  `` romania ? 
  what is that ? '', 
  wow . 
  that actually sounds pretty impressive . 
  i 'm jealous ... been wanting to go for a while now ... maybe next summer . 
  you have a nice trip , tho . 
  fair enough . 
  do n't most people in the netherlands speak good english , though ? 
  at least so i 've heard from friends who 've visited . 
  i 'm surprised more people do n't wan na go to finland . 
  it looks so nice ... 
  when it 's not frozen over , i mean ... 
  such is life in arstotzka . 
  i also think there 's a definite correlation , but would n't be able to tell exactly how big it is .
