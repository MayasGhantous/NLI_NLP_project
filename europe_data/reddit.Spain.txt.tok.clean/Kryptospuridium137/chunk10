  not in the way germany , italy or france are , at least . 
  they do n't see europe as something to be a part of and share in , but as something to be feared / conquered . 
  they create their own otherness , and they seem to like it fine that way . 
  chinese are hardworking and shrewd but also sketchy . 
  they 'll work 18 hours a day and own three stores by age 40 , but only hire family members , never pay them , and overwork them to the bone . 
  my uncle swears one day every store in the country will be chinese-owned because we just can not compete fairly . 
  the same applies to indians , but they 're much less common than the chinese . 
  though indians also have the stereotype of smelling weird ( not necessarily bad , just weird ) and haggling a lot . 
  filipinos are also hardworking and good people , but insular and penny pinchers . 
  they 're also not bound to stay for long . 
  they 'll come here , share a room with 12 other filipinos to save as much as possible , then go back home after 5/10 years with all their euros and live like rich people . 
  i 've never heard stereotypes of the other groups . 
  source : most of my family are ** huge ** passive racists who associate with other racists . 
   tfw spanish is italian and french 's ugly sister # *** hey ***, 
  maybe . 
  my gut reaction would be to say that yes , some people are too despicable to live . 
  but i also know that 's it 's not to me or anyone else to decide who lives or dies . 
  it 's simply not something i can or should decide on . 
  and neither should any government for that matter . 
  also , giving the government the power to decide who lives or who dies sets a bad precedent . 
  i 'm gon na take `` knowing '' as `` can mentally place them on the map '' instead of simply naming them : alaska , washington , oregon , california , nevada , utah , arizona , then ... colorado and ... new mexico ? 
  uh ... oklahoma , then texas ... arkansas ... ? 
  louisiana , mississippi , alabama , florida ... 
  uh ... georgia ? 
  both carolinas , both virginias , uh ... maryland ... ? 
  pennsylvania ... ? 
  new jersey , new york , uh ... massachusetts is the one with the weird hook thing at the end , and vermont and maine are north of that . . and ... 
  i think that 's it ... michigan is the one that 's two bits , and i think ... wisconsin ... ? 
  is the one in the middle of it , and then ... 
  uh ... hawaii . 
  and yeah , i 'm drawing blanks now . 
  that 's it . 
  31 out of 50 . 
  not super terrible , tbh . 
  i thank victoria 2 for that . 
  as for stereotypes , i know washingtonians are \u00fcber hipsters , oregon is borderline socialist , north california is full of hicks and southern cali is hollywood . 
  texas ... everything is bigger , especially the morons . 
  florida is / r/floridaman territory . 
  new york is full of assholes , and new jersey is new york 's little brother with an inferiority complex that 's even more of an asshole . 
  [ and they both speak like this ] ( https://youtu.be/8reihyxb5y0?t=1m6s ) . 
  uh ... hawaii is full of fat people . 
  wisconsin is obsessed with cheese . 
  nebraska is nothing but cornfields and hicks . 
  uh ... that 's it , i think . 
  i really respect the french for this . 
  wish every country 's workers respected themselves as much as french workers seem to do . 
  pretty much . 
  it seems portugal have n't asked for it ever since the treaty so i guess we 've just forgotten about the whole thing . 
  i sure as hell did n't even know about it until i read about it on wikipedia . 
  i was gon na say this one , but i actually think we did the right thing in that case . 
  morocco sent ** actual soldiers ** to the fucking thing . 
  they were basically provoking us . 
  [ ~ ~ they also had a flag . ~ ~ ] ( https://youtu.be/uex5g-gos1k?t=10s ), 
  holding onto a [ little town ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olivenza#claims_of_sovereignty ) of just over 10k inhabitants that we took when invading portugal basically just because we can . 
  quote from the congress of vienna wiki page :  during the wars , portugal had lost its town of oliven\u00e7a to spain and moved to have it restored . 
  portugal is historically britain 's oldest ally , and with british support succeeded in having the re-incorporation of oliven\u00e7a decreed in article 105 of the final act , which stated that the congress `` understood the occupation of oliven\u00e7a to be illegal and recognized portugal 's rights '' . 
  portugal ratified the final act in 1815 but spain would not sign , and this became the most important hold-out against the congress of vienna . 
  deciding in the end that it was better to become part of europe than to stand alone , spain finally accepted the treaty on 7 may 1817 ; however , oliven\u00e7a and its surroundings were never returned to portuguese control and this question remains unresolved . 
  see also the [ war of the oranges ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_the_oranges ) wiki page for the taking of the town . 
  same in spanish : regla . 
  the sixth sense, 
  tagged as `` potential spy '' . 
  but is n't that the same logic americans use to defend their dumb electoral college ? 
  in the end , for the sake of giving representation to a few , you 're shafting a large portion of the population . 
  that 's not how the system should work . 
  less populated areas might have less of a say , yes , but you ca n't ignore half of the country to give some town with 300 people equal weight . 
  in local elections , you do n't give more weight to the periphery areas because the downtown is too populated . 
  everyone 's vote is worth the same . 
   oh i know but its one of the answers i got and i suppose its ` objectively good ' if one is convinced that christian western traditions militate against some socialist , atheistic , globalist sort of political system they want . 
  well , i mean , you can have socialism without completely changing a place 's culture . 
  not the best example ever , but there was ( something like ) [ christmas ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yienlifspws/triup5983ti/aaaaaaaaaec/jkpsqxgyubc/s1600/xmasscan1.jpg ) even in the soviet union , for example . 
   i 'm not much of an economist but it seems like it would just work out mostly the same after all . 
  yes , more goes into social security but then just as many more are taking out/using the social security ? 
  the idea is that more population will mean more kids , so if there 's 2 people retiring today , their 2/3/4 kids will contribute to pay for their social security , and ** their ** kids will pay for their social security , and so on . 
  first and second generation immigrants also have more children on average than natives , so theoretically they would contribute to social security more than natives even . 
  the problem in many countries right now is that we 're not having enough children to `` keep up with the demand '' , so to speak . 
  you always need more people working than retiring , so you need more births than deaths , and we 're not seeing that . 
  and migrants do n't really solve the issue fully either , because by the third generation , the fertility rate of migrant groups falls down to the native level . 
  so you need to maintain a constant supply of migrants to see the effects you need . 
  it 's a complicated issue . 
  and i do n't think anyone really knows what we 're supposed to do about it . 
  not one law exactly , but i think our current party system is ridiculous . 
  our [ system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d'hondt_method#regional_d.27hondt ) to allocate seats in both houses is ridiculous . 
  not voting directly for the president is ridiculous . 
  this needs to go . 
   i do n't know how to fix it rent controls should do the trick . 
  plus maybe opening more of the countryside to construction , but i imagine there 's a reason they 're not doing that . 
  your second point is not objectively good . 
  christians / people who actually like europe 's christian culture would disagree . 
  ( as do i ) the only ** objectively ** good point i can think of is having a larger population base to pay into social security . 
  i do n't think anyone could disagree that having a well-funded social security system is a bad thing . 
  lol exactly !, 
  glad i 'm not the only one . 
  there 's * dozens * of us :p happy new years btw, 
  people call me crazy and tell me i 'm gon na die of pneumonia when i eat ice cream in the dead of winter . 
  but it just feels so right . 
  math . 
  i hated it so much i 've literally forgotten everything i learned beyond long division . 
  and even then i 'll just use a calculator . 
  never missed it .
