   * the cc regional government in the canary islands to finally be ousted ( probably not , but a man can dream ) am\u00e9n ... 
  he is !, 
  anton chigurh is still to this day in my top 3 of greatest villains . 
  eh , there 's worst things to not know . 
  i 'm in a little ashamed to say i did n't know christian bale was british ... 
  reno is so great that he 's amazing both in serious movies as he is in trashy movies like wasabi or the 2000 's american godzilla :p i do n't have anything against her !, 
  i just do n't think she 's as great as the media here paints her as ... to me , she never plays a character , she just seems to be playing herself . 
  in every movie . 
  it 's just boring . 
  it 's a tie between jean reno and daniel br\u00fchl . 
  they 're both great at everything . 
  marion cotillard is great too . 
  and omar sy was pretty great in the intouchables . 
  also til schweiger as hugo stiglitz was the best . 
  and for less favorite i got ta say penelope cruz . 
  she 's always flat , blank-faced and uninteresting in everything . 
  i. . . do n't see much of a difference between those two ... ? 
  one has whitened teeth and the other one does n't , but that 's it . 
  i 'm curious . 
  why is bullfighting not very european ? 
  jordi evole did an entire faux-documentary about this not that long ago . 
  he had me completely by the balls . 
  then at the end it 's like `` nah , i made it all up . 
  do n't you just feel silly now ? '', 
  omg ruben , you ca n't just ask people why they 're white !, 
  `` we did n't came from anywhere . 
  we 've always been here . '', 
  hmmmm ... maybe as the y in yank ... ? 
  with the flat of the tongue on the palate . 
  well , not * quite * . 
  it 's a little difficult to explain but ... 
  the nya in cabanya would be pronounced with the tip of your tongue on the [ alveolar ridge ] ( http://www.odlt.org/images/alveolar_ridge.jpg ) followed by the lowering of the tongue to pronounce the a. 
  it 's a diphthong . 
  the \u00f1a in caba\u00f1a is pronounced with the middle of the tongue touching the hard palate , and it 's a single vowel sound . 
  the difference is subtle , i suppose . 
  a bit like the difference between the s and z in english . 
  it 's not a big deal if you pronounce them the same , but it 'll be obvious you 're not a native speaker . 
  caba\u00f1a ( even though apparently no english speaker can pronounce \u00f1 properly ) sombrero adobe alligator comes from spanish `` el lagarto '' , the lizard savanna salsa siesta coyote patio papaya potato i could go on . 
  that could work out too , i suppose . 
  i had n't thought of that ... 
  i guess there 's still time to think about it thoroughly :p, 
  well , i 'm not expecting my children to continue doing the same forever . 
  i just do n't want my mother 's last name to die with me . 
  if even by just inertia they continue using the hyphenated name , then my mother 's side of the family can live on for a few generations more . 
  and you can always just give the kid both your surnames hyphenated , which is what i 'm gon na do . 
  so something along the lines of ... jos\u00e9 luis aguilar-borja fuentes-ortega . 
  both sides of the family of both parents get passed down . 
   a vegetable salad huh , that 's weird . 
  in spanish , a macedonia is a ** fruit ** salad . 
  it 's dat boi !, 
  i interpret it as more of a `` you 're all heartless snobs . 
  but damn , you always get the job done . '', 
  so efficient and reliable , but stiff . 
  did ... did they confuse eta with farc ... ? 
  that looks 100 % like colombia ... 
  fair enough . 
  uh , am i missing something ... ? 
  what 's cringy about that last one ... ? 
  the civil war . 
  one side was shooting up churches and rounding up the clergy and supporters in the name of state atheism , and rounding up leftists in the name of stalin . 
  the other side was rounding up everyone to the left of mussolini in the name of `` traditional values '' . 
  not our best moment , for all the wanking other leftists like to do about how glorious and brave and whatever the republicans were . 
  well , that 's what i get the op is asking . 
  but yeah . 
  if we 're going dancing or are just faffing about the city , then a good old coke bottle half full with arehucas is * the * companion xd, 
  hahaha we 'll go for some arehucas too !, 
  i mean , it 's made here and all . 
  but that 's more for when doing botell\u00f3n and such , i assumed op was referring to going bars and so on . 
  you are n't gon na sneak in a huge 2l bottle of poor man 's cuba libre into a bar ... often xp, 
  i do n't know , in my experience it 's the standard drink when we go to bars besides just a beer . 
  and it does n't help that it 's usually the cheapest option too . 
  but maybe it 's me and my broke-ass college friends ? 
  well , that 's is only high speed rail , and related lines . 
  [ our rail lines are pretty decent ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/red_actual_de_ferrocarriles_de_espa%c3%b1a.svg/800px-red_actual_de_ferrocarriles_de_espa%c3%b1a.svg.png ) . 
  i was mostly joking , but if you do visit again i 'd recommend checking out the south . 
  sevilla , or m\u00e1laga if you wan na keep close to the coast , there 's lots of history there and a completely different atmosphere from the north . 
  i 've literally never met a single portuguese person that was n't super nice , and it 's fun to talk about how similar spanish and portuguese are . 
  plus i really like the way portuguese people speak spanish . 
   spain : i do n't know much about them to be honest . 
  [ cough cough ] ( http://www.renfe.com/viajeros/larga_distancia/productos/avefrancia/index.html ), 
  both . 
  the revolution was completely necessary . 
  batista was a monster , and cuba was just america 's playground . 
  especially the mobsters ' . 
  his effort to free his country from the american yoke are commendable , and something more countries should 've followed . 
  as with most revolutions , though , the end result was a new elite replacing the older elite , and long-term fidel did much more harm than batista ever do . 
  i. . . had never thought of the netherlands as `` unpopular '' ... 
  pretty much every time i 've seen people mentioning the country is to praise it in some way ... 
  unless they 're talking about wilders , i guess . 
  oh god , no , please . 
  i would n't wish that on anyone . 
  i swear to god , quasimodo could pick up a bunch of chicks in spain if he had an argentinian accent . 
  i love everything about this . 
  i can confirm this as well . 
  the military is not at all respected or liked , and it even has something of a bad reputation in my experience , since most of the people looking to join the military are either immigrants or those with no other real prospects who think they 'll make mad cash while staying at the base all day . 
  older people might have a little more of a rosy view of the military , especially right wingers , because they remember their days at the mili ( mandatory military service ) , but younger generations absolutely do not . 
  honestly , brexit should 've happened much sooner . 
  who even wants at the table the guy that 's always going `` wait , no , not that '' , `` hmmm , no , i do n't think so '' , `` well , yeah , but how about we do this instead ? '' . 
  like , dude , do you even ** want ** to be here or not ? 
  it is !,
