  i was reminded of that perenqu\u00e9 song the other day , and i 've been rewatching it all over again . 
  still awesome as always . 
  honestly ? 
  i think [ negro from malviviendo ] ( https://youtu.be/ztl8kmlj9is?t=2m3s ) is a very accurate representation of the spanish youth . 
  sorry you 're being downvoted , man . 
  [ this is probably the largest thing you can hunt in the canaries .

  i 'd argue that we do n't have a populist far right , but our right wing government it 's taking a lot of cues from the populists ... 
   so do you still get scared you 'll be jumped at night or robbed , just not at gunpoint ? 
  i mean , once in here i said i would always advise people to not go into alleys and the like alone at night , and to be mindful of their stuff in public gatherings , and someone told me i made it sound like i lived in a crime-ridden shithole with no police . 
  take that as you will . 
  for the record , i 've had only ** two ** experiences with crime . 
  one myself and one through a friend . 
  mine was getting my phone taken out of my pocket during a public concert , my friend 's was getting his shoes and phone stolen after he drunkenly fell asleep in a tram stop at 3 am and did n't even wake up 'till next morning . 
  because spanish yt and spanish internet in general is a sea of cringey kids , forced memes and dead english internet memes people think are new . 
  and i said that there 's plenty of options available for people to choose from to minimize the possibility of that . 
  again , the possibility of two different contraceptive methods failing at the same time is so unlikely is not even worth considering . 
  it 's just a matter of education so that people can use them properly and learn to choose the one that 's right for them . 
  i 'm literally just listing all the options available , choose the one that fits you and feel comfortable with . 
  and combine it with a condom to be extra careful . 
  all i 'm saying is that birth control is preferable to abortions . 
  i do n't even know what anyone could find debatable about that . 
  there are plenty of options available . 
  you can use spermicide creams , you can use iuds , you can get a vasectomy or a fallopian tubes ligature , and plenty of options more . 
  and who knows what other methods will be developed in the next 10-20 years ? 
  there 's literally no excuse . 
  use multiple methods ... ? 
  a condom might fail , the pill might fail , both failing at the same time is so statistically improbable it 's not even worth considering . 
  i 'm in the minority , but i 'd prefer it if it was only available as a last resort , in cases where it threatens the life of the mother or the child has very little chance to live . 
  i do believe we should offer much better sex education , however , and increased access to birth control methods . 
  no abortion + abstinence only is a recipe for disaster . 
  jos\u00e9 , juan , francisco ( usually shortened to paco , though paco is itself rather common ) , santiago , manuel / manolo . 
  for women maria , carmen , rosario , cristina ... 
  hahahahahahahahahahahaha * oh my god , man * . 
  the face on that bear . 
  so inciting violence and hate speech . 
  sounds about fair . 
  that has nothing to do with outrage being the wrong choice , though . 
  `` i 'm so mad i 'm gon na throw myself off that cliff ! '', 
  is a stupid reaction . 
  does n't really matter if they get involved or not . 
  they would never just sit back and let europe get nucked , they would retaliate just the same as france , and everyone knows it . 
  not that there would ever be a nuclear war in europe , this is n't the 50 's , but just there being more than one possible target acts as a deterrent . 
  the uk , man ... 
  well , it 's what i 've heard . 
  maybe french food was `` exotic '' enough that americans just thought that 's what it was supposed to taste like ? 
  while british food might have been recognizable enough that it was more noticeable, 
  well , i ca n't really speak for anyone else , but at least in my view being 5 / 10 minutes late is just not a big deal . 
  we say we 're gon na be there at 10 , you get there at 10:10 ... 
  so what ... ? 
  i 'm hardly bothered by it . 
  there 's not that much of a difference either way . 
  it 's hardly even worth commenting on imo . 
  it reaches a point where it just becomes expected . 
  i just * know * there 's friends of mine who i ** know ** wo n't be there on time , so even arriving 15 minutes late * i * might have to wait for them a bit . 
  but it 's just not a big deal . 
  0 % you do n't have to be american to feel for american politics and issues , though . 
  for one , you can empathize with the people suffering under the us backward stance on many social issues and the fact that a lot of their countrymen like it that way and fight to keep it that way . 
  for another , whatever happens in the united states has repercussions on pretty much every other country in the world . 
  it is just natural to think `` this is bad '' when you know whatever happens 7000km away could have very real repercussions for you and yours . 
  neither of us voted for bush , but we all felt the consequences of his presidency in a way we would n't have if we were talking about bolivia or nigeria . 
  well , of course , some work needs to be done . 
  and it 's not like we can eliminate nato come january and fund our alternative that same day . 
  but eventually we 're gon na have to stop relying on others for our defense , and what better time than now ? 
  [ also , to be fair , the germans , danes and poles claimed first , second and third place at a recent usareur-bundeswehr tank training competition , so at the very least we 're doing training right .

  `` the donald '' will probably start demanding we pay up our share of nato ( iirc only the uk , greece and estonia pay the recommended 2 % gdp ) in which case i say we should totally do that ... 
  in our own european organization . 
  we have 2 nuclear states in europe , and germany and france alone have roughly half as many troops as russia does , and ten times more modern . 
  we do n't need the us to `` protect '' shit , we can do it ourselves . 
  there 's just has n't been any drive for it . 
  the whole `` spanish are lazy '' thing is pretty dumb . 
  especially when the explanation most people can muster is `` dae siesta ? '', 
  as if we all like clockwork pull out a pillow at 3pm and go to sleep in the middle of whatever we 're doing ... also , the `` spaniards are always tardy '' stereotype is very hit and miss . 
  i *** am *** always late for everything , but my brother is always there 10 minutes early , so \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  iirc the stereotype came about due to rationing . 
  american gis experienced british food at a time when not even the royalty had access to certain basic things , so of course they experienced terrible food , and then they went back home with tales of the horrible brit food they had to endure .

  `` bro , you 're under arrest . 
  can you , like , show up at hell gate penitentiary early tomorrow ? '', 
  `` i do n't know , man . 
  i have tickets for a concert on friday . '', 
  `` well , shit . 
  ok . just hit me up when you 're ready for prison i guess . '', 
   when everything is completely destroyed in russia you can at least rebuild it from scratch and try to make it better next time . 
  hey , if it worked for the soviets ... 
  well , my mom and my sister would be to differ , mate . 
  they 're both `` de '' of their husbands ... 
  it 's by no means common , but it does happen still . 
   the mother 's name can come in first place ( in fact i have friend doing this with their kids for several causes ) . 
  i know there 's cases of people taking their mother 's last name first . 
  hell , * i 'm * planning on doing this with my kids . 
  but i 'm talking generally . 
  * for the most part * , people do n't do that . 
   also , the `` de '' particle is part of the surname ( first or last ) . 
  maybe i misunderstood what you meant but it 's not exclusive of the last surname . 
  what i said it 's that is most common with toponymic last names : last names that come from place names .
