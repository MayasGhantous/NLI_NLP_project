  so `` de le\u00f3n '' `` de \u00c1vila '' and so on . 
  though i guess i should 've mentioned married women can also take their husband 's last name with a `` de '' . 
   also , the examples of people keeping their grandparents surnames and ending up with more than two words as surnames are very rare , and i 've heard , very costly . 
  basically the only people i 've known to do that are extremely posh people . 
  well , i did mention this , mate . 
  that it was much more common in the old days than it is now , and mostly amongst the aristocracy . 
  usually , yes , names are organized from closest to oldest generation , and people usually take their grandfather 's names , it 's very rare for people to pass down their mother 's last name . 
  so for example , simon bolivar de la santisima trinidad . 
  that 's his first names . 
  then , bolivar ponte , from his father , who 's full name was juan vicente de bol\u00edvar y ponte-andrade . 
  so , bolivar , his father 's last name , and then the ponte from ponte-andrade , which is presumably the last name of his grandfather , on his mother 's side . 
  and then palacios blanco , from his mother , who 's full name was mar\u00eda de la concepci\u00f3n palacios de aguirre arizt\u00eda-sojo y blanco de herrera . 
  palacios de aguirre arizt\u00eda-sojo would be her father 's surname , and blanco de herrera her mother 's , with blanco being her mother 's father 's last name . 
  so you can see , for example , the blanco surname filtered from the father , to the daughter , to the daughter , and then down to bolivar . 
  and i 'm sure if you did a genealogical survey you would find that ariztia came from a third or fourth generation before , but then was lost alongside the rest of the mother 's last name . 
  we have double surnames . 
  one you inherit from your dad and comes first , the other from your mom and comes second . 
  both inherited surnames are usually the first surname , and thus the surname of your grandparent . 
  the surnames of your grandmothers are usually lost , but some people might decide to keep them . 
  you can also have a `` de '' ( from/of ) before your surnames , so federico de sandoval ferrera . 
  this is more common with place name last names , equivalent to italian `` da '' or germanic `` von '' , so that name would be something like `` fernando from / of the town of sandoval '' . 
  also , you can have an `` y '' ( and ) between your surnames , again usually more common with placename last names . 
  so : `` federico de sandoval y ferrera '' . 
  finally , this custom of keeping two last names can be extrapolated over several generations , so you end up with a person with two first names and 4 , 8 , 12 last names . 
  this was more common in the old days , in our latin american colonies , amongst aristocratic families who wanted to keep their lineage . 
  so for example simon bolivar de la sant\u00edsima trinidad bolivar ponte y palacios blanco , manuel jos\u00e9 joaqu\u00edn del coraz\u00f3n de jes\u00fas belgrano , and miguel gregorio antonio ignacio hidalgo-costilla y gallaga mandarte villase\u00f1or . 
  more than something interesting , something baffling : the lack of a second person plural pronoun in english . 
  as a speaker of spanish , it just seems like something * so obvious and basic * . 
  `` how do you address a group of people ? '', 
  `` uh ... shit , i dunno , man . '', 
  *** also , i guess that would be a quirk of * our * language , but i like having inverted question and exclamation symbols ( \u00bf \u00a1 ) . 
  it 's convenient . 
  i already mark the start of an exclamation or a question in long sentences with a comma in english , so having a particular symbol for it just seems like the next logical step . 
  though some dialects of spanish do pronounce the h as a j. 
  even if it 's not grammatically correct . 
  `` daddy , what is that called ? '', 
  `` we call that batdahfuck , son . '', 
  `` but why ? '', 
  `` because that 's what everyone says when they see it . '', 
  i ` member . 
  i would not trust myself to not end up with the fridge , and countertop , and probably the floor too all covered in milk if it came in a bag . 
  at that point i 'd rather just pour it all in a jar and drink it asap . 
  [ rafael nadal ] ( http://wpc.e0ad.edgecastcdn.net/00e0ad/images/the-philippine-star/sports/20150624/ps-nadal.jpg ) is probably *** the *** most successful and recognized spanish athlete right now . 
  been for a while . 
  then [ the ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pau_gasol ) gasol [ brothers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marc_gasol ) . 
  then [ fernando alonso ] ( http://topcar.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/fernando-alonso.jpg ) , i suppose . 
  and [ mireia belmonte ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mireia_belmonte ) was talked about a lot during the olympics . 
  and that 's it off the top of my head . 
  ** very ** rural andalusian spanish . 
  i 've been super hooked to the long dark since i bought it back in december . 
  i basically have n't put it down since . 
  i also play some euiv from time to time . 
  and recently started playing the first witcher game , but have n't gotten too much into it . 
  [ yes . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6c0bndqf3y ), 
  at that point , i do n't think there 's much of a point in keeping the country together . 
  just have everyone be their own thing and that 's it . 
  but i might not be picturing the same thing as you 're suggesting . 
  ludacris is a rapper . 
  it 's a joke :p, 
  perfect . 
  jesus christ , i think i 'm having a heart attack . 
  it 's a shame cervantes is overshadowed by shakespeare somewhat , the guy was super interesting , not just as a novelist but as a person . 
  he worked for a time as a tax collector , and for his hard work he got excommunicated ** twice ** after expropriating two holy men 's personal lands . 
  he got in a fight once and badly hurt some antonio di sigura , so he had to flee to italy for a time to avoid capture . 
  then he came back , enlisted in the navy , and fought at the battle of lepanto , where he was shot in the arm twice and had to live with a paralyzed left arm for the rest of his life . 
  and after ** that ** he was captured by pirates and lived as a slave for 5 years until his family could finally pay his ransom . 
  so he had an ... 
  active lifestyle , to say the least ... 
  \\  construire des ch\u00e2teaux en espagne ( build castles in spain ) : have projects that will never become rea but there are castles in spain ... 
  finally fucking elect a government , for one . 
  preferably a leftist one , but that is n't happening so just give the fucking thing to mariano so we can move on . 
  and by move on , i mean crash the little recovery we 've seen with more austerity . 
  also [ legalize it ] ( https://youtu.be/ds0mjbtjbvu?t=2s ) . 
  that 'd be sweet . 
  `` screw you guys , we will make our ** own ** nordic !, 
  with * penguins * ! '', 
  because it 's completely ridiculous and based on hot air . 
  canarian identity as guanche identity is already kind of a stretch , considering we slaughtered half of them and erased their culture off the islands so hard we ca n't even piece together their language beyond a few placenames and surnames . 
  but alright , i can accept that we can have some measure of guanche identity since they 're part of our history . 
  but to go from `` our history has been kinda different '' to '' *** we 're completely different from the godos *** ( `` the goths '' , our word for the people from the peninsula ) is just silly . 
  we really are not different enough from the average spaniard to claim any kind of separatist feeling . 
  and *** even if *** you could make the case that canarian identity is sufficiently different enough from spanish identity to warrant that feeling , then , well ... 
  so what ... ? 
  what are we gon na ** do ** exactly as our own country ? 
  for one , we will never , *** ever *** be accepted back into the eu . 
  and as a rural region we receive a lot of funds from it . 
  half of my university 's campuses were at least partially financed with eu grant money . 
  ( nevermind that i 'd say at least 10 or 20 % of all students are erasmus . 
  so that 'd be gone too . ), 
  for another , we will still have to import 80 % of our food and other necessities , but now we will do so as a foreign government with all the taxes and tariffs and whatever the fuck else that implies . 
  for a third , there really is no way we can organize such a thing politically . 
  ffs , we could n't even agree on a proper capital and had to go `` ok ok , you ** both ** can be the capital , kids '' . 
  and all of that really painful , really hard shit that would hurt *** a lot *** of people , for what exactly ? 
  some vague notion of `` self-rule '' ? 
  * please * . 
  to be fair , that sounds less like an independist movement than a rabble bought by a foreign government . 
   at its height the ciim had no more than 100 members also , i find it *** hysterical *** they thought we have an iota of berber identity in us . 
  canarian separatism is always such a fucking joke to me ... 
  i fucking detest elon musk and everything he 's involved with .
