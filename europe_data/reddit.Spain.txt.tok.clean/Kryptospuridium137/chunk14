  he 's just built a gigantic , stemlord cult of personality around himself , while selling the idea that if he just leeches a few more hundred millions of off nasa all of our dreams will come true . 
  ( but only if you can afford his products ) the `` private sector '' has no business in space exploration , and giving the bourgeoisie free reign to claim space in the name of capital unopposed , * at best * , will just result in an expansion of the capitalist 's control over the means of production . 
  at worst , it just serves to move more capital into the pockets of musk and his ilk . 
  [ brexit.rar ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2193794/thumbs/o-comres-570.jpg ) seriously , though , i refuse to believe people are oblivious enough to not see the contradiction when answering those questions . 
  considering how many spaniards have been leaving the country in recent years , being against free movement of people would make us all a bunch of hypocrites . 
  i_understood_that_reference . jpeg, 
  i agree with every point except the military part . 
  i 'd be perfectly ok with just having a token defense force at ceuta and melilla and use that money elsewhere . 
  i 'm gon na have to pray to the choir as well . 
  i understand the feeling completely . 
  could n't have said it better , tbh . 
  i for the most part ca n't other than speaking generally . 
  `` he looks british , he looks northern-ish , probably german , he looks slavic . '', 
  but i 'm generally terrible with faces so that 's no surprise . 
  i 'm much better at recognizing accents for the most part . 
  hey , it 's all good if it gets you simone de beauvoir . 
  i do n't think there 's a single person left in the country who thinks the invasion was a good idea . 
  people *** overwhelmingly *** were against it but the president at the time was a bootlicker , so he prefered to go against people 's will and keep sucking america 's oily cock . 
  we got the largest terrorist attack in our history a year later , and then we quickly pulled back and forgot about the whole thing entirely . 
  even today , atocha is remembered as just another terrorist attack and our involvement in making isis happen is pretty much forgotten by both the government party and the opposition . 
  so what i 'm saying is ... we do n't wan na talk about it . 
  none of our business . 
  who 's even saddam hussein ? 
  huh , that 's weird . 
  i live in tenerife , and me and everyone i know learned cursive ... 
  really ? 
  where did you study ? 
  to be fair , i finished primary school 12 years ago so things might have changed . 
  but i 'd assume everyone was still taught cursive in primary school . 
  person from the netherlands . 
  * oh no , * i 've been discovered . 
   `` there are hate crimes being committed against foreigners . '', 
  `` those things have always happened , there 's no need to blow this out of proportion . 
  do you got any proof ? '', 
   `` there are crimes being comitted by brown-skinned foreigners . '', 
  '' *** this is an epidemic . 
  deport the mudslimes . 
  close the border . 
  multiculti pls go . 
  coincidentally , today i forgot the ticket machine at the tram station only spits out coins , never bills . 
  so i 've got about 20 bucks worth of coins . 
  let 's see ... 2 euro : 1 netherlander , 2 austrian , 1 german , 1 belgian , 3 spanish 50 cent : 1 italian 20 cent : 1 french , 1 spanish 10 cent : 1 french , 1 german , 3 spanish 5 cent : 2 spanish and an american quarter i found on the street 2 months ago for good luck . 
  our president is technically `` unelected '' . 
  we still have a standing army . 
  because i support a united europe at all levels and a united european army would be : 1 ) a huge leap towards that and 2 ) make nato completely unnecessary for us , reducing america 's influence on european and world matters . 
  i 'm gon na go with botell\u00f3n . 
  it 's when ( mostly teens / college kids ) gather around in a ( usually public ) place to drink and chat and get all good and drunk before hitting the bars . 
  i 've gone to more than those that i 'd be proud to admit . 
  saciado , in spanish . 
   - complain all the time even though everything is fine til i 'm austrian . 
  i learnt cursive back in the day , and most of the people i knew also wrote in cursive , at first . 
  as me and my friends got older , we naturally shifted to print . 
  i have n't written in cursive in years . 
  afaik , cursive is still taught in pretty much all schools . 
  but i do n't personally know anyone who still writes in cursive . 
  that he was , which is why i think such a rating is incredibly harsh . 
  but you have to understand the situation at the time : the corruption scandals had just started to surface back then , and then we found out the husband of the princess was in it on it . 
  a lot of backlash fell on the monarchy as a whole , and on the king , less of which because there were rumours they had been covering up the whole thing . 
  feelings were really raw at the time , and a lot of the hate was directed at the king . 
  things really petered out after he announced his abdication , and nowadays i 'd say his public image has recovered a lot . 
  not particularly . 
  if you see my post [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/53149x/european_subjects_how_strong_and_advanced_are/d7p5apn ) . 
  there 's a breakdown of the politics / age of the people who support and do n't support the monarchy . 
  there 's some trends , like the young and the radical left being more likely to be republicans , but supporters of center-left and leftists parties like psoe and podemos still generally support the current system over all . 
  personally speaking , i 'd say being ** openly ** monarchical is kind of seen as an `` old conservative '' thing and you may even be called a fascist ( `` facha '' ) by some , but support for the current system is widely broad . 
  i suppose so , though like i 've said , imo a large proportion of that 40/50/60 % is less `` i really support this '' and more `` i do n't really want to change it '' . 
  it 's less `` support '' and more being ok that it exists . 
  but i suppose that 's splitting hairs . 
  and what i heard was that she used to share the republican views of her deceased grandfather , and her aunt is also a hardcore republican , but she obviously is n't anymore . 
  `` can i use your bathroom , please ? '', 
  `` yes , * u kunt * . '', 
  well , obviously , in spain that 'd depend on who you ask . 
  i do n't believe catalonians or basques are too fond of the monarchy , but i can not really speak for them . 
  generally , though , i 'd reckon most spaniards either like the monarchy or do n't really care too much one way or the other . 
  and the numbers seem to back that up . 
  [ this poll from january 2014 ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2014/01/05/52c89f76ca4741f0588b4571.html ) , before the advication of the last king , has support for the monarchy at 49,9 % , with 56,2 % of people having a * bad to very bad * opinion of his reign . 
  ( that 's harsh , imo ) [ this poll from june 2014 ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/politica/abdicacion-porcentaje-espanoles-monarquia-parlamentaria_0_270523743.html ) , after advication , has 42,2 % calling themselves `` monarchical '' ( vs republican ) but with 51,5 % prefering the current constitutional monarchy model . 
  [ this poll from june 2015 ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2015/06/18/actualidad/1434645381_023519.html ) gives the new king a 81 % approval raiting , with 70 % of participants saying the king helps to `` back and safeguard the democratic system in these times of crisis '' 66 % saying he achieves this by the `` impartial , non-partisam '' way felipe vi carries out his functions . 
  [ finally , this poll from july 2015 ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2015/06/15/557dc06f22601d30648b457e.html ) has 61,5 % of participants approving of the current constitutional monarchy system . 
  i could n't find any more recent polls , but these seem to back my personal opinion that most people support the monarch because it serves as a non-partisan element in politics and as a charismatic ambassador to the world . 
  we 'll make denmark pay for it ? 
  ~ ~ lego city ~ ~ copenhagen maybe ? 
  or maybe amsterdam ? 
   the canary islands would be a good option wan na trade ? 
  i fucking love carrefour because of this . 
  not really . 
  especially around this time of the year , it 's relatively common to see groups of chinese and japanese tourist going around the city , taking pictures and so on . 
  it 's nice . 
  hell , recently there was this big thing about a chinese businessman paying for his entire company 's vacation here in spain . 
  they stayed for like a week , and the news was all over that stuff . 
  they were like little celebrities . 
  i do recommend at least some basic spanish vocabulary , however . 
  depending on the area you are in the level of english might not be , uh ... 
  good !, 
  we might not have much over here , but we can feed ya well :p, 
  food mostly . 
  canned citrus , canned fish ( in olive oil obviously ) , pork pat\u00e9 . 
  manchego cheese , palmero cheese ( and [ mojo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mojo_\\ ( sauce \\ ) ) to dip it ) . 
  a bag of [ gofio ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gofio ) , because it stays for months and is basically a meal in itself . 
  i was thinking wine too , but all you could really send is box wine .
