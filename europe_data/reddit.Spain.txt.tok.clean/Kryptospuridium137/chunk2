  either way , i fully support subbing over dubbing . 
  if for no other reason than it allows the viewers to get used to a different language . 
  well , freedom of movement between member countries makes it significantly easier for people to ... well , move ... 
  so people are more willing to visit places they might not have before if they had to go through heavy paperwork and such measures . 
  that means more tourism between member states , which is always good . 
  especially if they also share a common currency that is worth the same regardless of where the tourist came from . 
  from the point of view of the citizen it 's also a great idea , since , if you are n't satisfied with your prospect of life in a place you can always `` easily '' ( as long as you can afford it , of course ) pick your baggage and go where the grass is greener . 
  ideally , this would mean that member states share human capital ( a spaniard who currently ca n't find a job can go work on , say , france . 
  and a british doctor who 's tired of the work load can choose to work on a more relaxed place ) . 
  of course , this second point is a negative from the point of view of the country itself , since one country is losing a job a native could have had and the other is losing a trained professional . 
  this also makes all the economies involved much more competitive , since your workers are n't competing just between themselves but also between the potential workers of all member states as well . 
  this could be a very good or a very , * very * bad thing depending on your point of view . 
  nonetheless , it 's also true that these problems would exist as long as there is any immigration at all . 
  and it 's debatable whether a freedom of movement policy truly significantly worsens these problems or just merely makes them more visible ( i am in no way an expert , so my take on the matter is unimportant ) . 
  my vote 's on cornwall . 
  that 's such a huge `` fuck you '' that i really want it to happen . 
  it 's not often than news can be hilarious . 
  you 're very welcome over here , just please stop digging holes in our beaches . 
  this is gon na go ugly * reeeal * quick ... 
  poland : the inuit of europe ? 
   people living in countries with governments that spend more on social services report being more contented eh ... 
  i would n't really call that a bigger government , just a bigger safety net ... 
  i hope this never ends . 
  * we hate two things : racists , and the danish . 
  [ relevant . ], 
  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj882qyzr-m ), 
  that 's why it 's better to see the general trend at the end of the year instead of individual periods . 
  you ca n't go `` unemployment falls by ten thousand million in july !, 
  '' , when 80 % of that employment is only gon na be there as long as the tourist season last ... 
  well , this could not possibly be taken badly by a lot of people , no sir . 
  chile and ecuador , mate . 
  half of venezuela 's borders are shared with brazil . 
  `` guys , you know what could stop the growth of racist ideologies ? 
  opening the floodgates of arab immigration ! '', 
  brilliant plan . 
  but * there are * a lot of racist bigots in the internet . 
  have you seen stormfront ? 
  heck , even our very own / r/greatapes and the defunct / r/niggers ? 
  these are all self-proclaimed and proud racists . 
  he 's in no way saying or even implying that everyone who does n't agrees with him is a racist bigots . 
  he 's saying that they exist , and * they do * , just like they exist in real life . 
   they rule in all the steppe horde tier states that are sparsely populated . 
  ok , that mental image is hysterical . 
  and i see ... 
  i suppose i had the wrong image of puerto rico , then ... maybe those problems were older and now have been solved ? 
  i have no clue , really , those are just the reasons i had heard about why puerto rico was n't a state yet . 
  but then , yeah , why * is n't * puerto rico a state ? 
  i mean , it ca n't possibly be any more different than , say , hawaii . 
  puerto rico is not exactly first world material , mate . 
  you 'd have literally millions of people who are now legally required to be provided healthcare , pensions and stuff of the like . 
  nevermind that it would also mean the free movement of people from puerto rico into america , no visa or any other requirement allowed . 
  add to that that puerto rico would completely wreck the voter base of half of america 's states on its own , and you can see why it 's in america 's `` best interests '' to not allow that to happen . 
  well , i would certainly prefer going the other way , uniting instead of separating . 
  but whatever the people decide , i suppose . 
  not quite . 
  i mean , humans have always had a sense of belonging to something , of course , tribes are as old as humankind . 
  but `` us '' meant a lot of different things to a lot of different people . 
  sharing land and a language has always been there , but the idea that people who share land and a language are equal is fairly new . 
  even in unified kingdoms , like spain , a galician and an andalusian were exactly that , a galician and an andalusian , with only the king or queen to relate them to one another . 
  all nationalism that existed was based around the enemy , the other , but infighting between regions was n't strange . 
  it was n't until very recently that the idea of nation as `` people who share a common language , culture and history '' took form , and it was n't popularized until after the french revolution . 
  and i only cited yugoslavia as an example of national identities changing . 
  i also mentioned how the national identity of `` german '' came from bavarian , pomeranian and swabian . 
  identities can be both separatistic ( yugoslavia ) and unifying ( germany and italy ) . 
  sure , but national identities are created all the time . 
  every single culture on earth has had dozens , maybe even hundreds of different identities through history , and the same way bavarian , pomeranian and swabian gave way to german , i do n't see why spaniard , briton or italian ca n't give way to `` european '' . 
  i mean , the most recent example of national identity changing ( the breakup of yugoslavia ) happened barely 20 years ago . 
  actually , no . 
  national identities are fairly new . 
  they 've only been around since the 18th century or so , before that people were proud of their king or their religion , but not of a nebulous concept of nation . 
  your same argument could have been use to placate a lot of countries independences ' do n't you think ? 
  `` oh , venezuela , colombia , argentina , do n't be childish !, 
  how can being latin american be more important than being spanish ? 
  a concept that has existed for more than four hundred years , no less ! '', 
  it 's just silly . 
  what people feel proud of today is not the same thing they felt proud of 400 years ago , and not the same thing they 're gon na feel proud of 400 years from now . 
  people 's views change , and they change all the time . 
  well , nationalism has only existed since a couple hundred years ago ... 
  i like to think that , given enough time , we can come up with something different again . 
  it 's funnier if you read the name in an ironic tone of voice . 
  `` oh , good choice , * punk * . '', 
   clever is our supermarkets ' budget brand so many shitty puns could be made ...
