  but the 10 years thing is more like an estimate , * if * someone else wants to join talks wo n't start until at least 10 years from now or more . 
  i personally believe there wo n't be any enlargement of the european union in a long , * long * time , if ever . 
  the only people left for joining are turkey ( not gon na happen ) and the balkans . 
  and anything in the balkans that has n't joined already will probably take several generations to be fit for joining . 
  i agree that the eu maybe grew too fast . 
  but i do n't really see it growing any more . 
  we removed kebab so hard we made it into the history books . 
  * spain stronk !, 
   not mixed lamb and beef kebab . 
  you do n't know what heaven tastes like . 
  to be fair , i do n't think most of these talks about enlargement ( except the ones already confirmed a long time ago , like croatia ) are anything other than a long-term plan . 
  think , 10 years or more from now . 
  take for example iceland . 
  they 've been in talks to join the eu since 2009 , but for one reason or the other they 've been postponing it , to the point where it is n't sure when exactly will they join . 
  same happens in macedonia , where they 've been in talks to join since 2005 . 
  or turkey , which applied for membership in 1987 , was n't recognized as a possible member until 2005 and are still trying to get their stuff fixed to a point even worth considering . 
  only if they stop removing kebabs . 
  i mean , come on , that shit 's delicious .

  do n't forget about `` party european , party american '' . 
  that 's a damn fine command right there . 
  honorable mentions : `` stop money , ireland '' `` dutch specially hate months '' `` europe understand french '' and `` european remember anyway benefits swedish '', 
  the best kind .

  `` romanians insulted by / u/ionuttzu 's comment . 
  ` we feel absolutely dishonored , and he should expect the full weight of our saturday morning drills ' , traian b\u0103sescu said . '', 
  i 'm not saying they * should * , i 'm saying they more than probably would . 
  and honestly , with the high-on-his-horse passive-aggressive tone you 're posting in , is not exactly a walk on the park talking to you either . 
  i just wanted to correct that point . 
  not immediatly after seceding . 
  it ca n't join at all unless the spanish government also agrees to it , and they simply would n't have a reason to do so . 
   membership negotiations can not start until all eu governments agree , in the form of a ** unanimous decision by the eu council ** , on a framework or mandate for negotiations with the candidate country . 
   the types who jerk off to napoleon and probably secretly hitler . 
  eu supporter = secret nazis yup , no false equivalence there . 
  no sir . 
  100 % emer costello , then the next 6 on the list are all from the s&d ... only 7 % match with jean-marie le pen . 
  as a person who has lived for 3 years now just besides the most annoyingly used highway of the island , i say `` fuck you ! '', 
  to that 85 % of spaniards who do n't know my pain .

  what 's wrong with hair gel ? 
  huh ... well , that 's what i 'd say . 
  if there was a `` northwest europe '' that would be the uk for sure ... 
  i guess it depends on the perspective . 
  i 've always thought of the uk as northern because , well , it 's right there at the north . 
  and a french or an italian would probably group it in the north too . 
  but maybe a dane or a nederlander would group it to the west . 
  ` tis weird ... 
  but england is to the north of almost every european country except for northern europe itself ... ( and to the south of iceland i guess ) . 
  i do n't know . 
  i guess it depends on if you group the uk culturally or geographically . 
  geographically it 's at the north of europe , but culturally it 's part of western europe ... 
  you will always be relevant in my heart , denmark < 3, 
  this one makes more sense to me . 
  england * is * to the north of europe ... 
  i 'm guessing czechs do n't like putin a lot ... just a hunch . 
  well , that ca n't be a majority , can it ? 
  i mean , as i said , that would leave them without the possibility of eating in roughly 80 % of the world . 
  eventually , you just have to get used to the fact than not a lot of places prepare halal meat . 
  i think so , yeah . 
  i have n't actually read the law to know for sure . 
  but i have seen it happen many times before . 
  one person smoking a joint , the wrong cop , and you get 10 or 15 people against a wall being searched outside a bar . 
  it 's fucking awful . 
   limited to eating a subset of the items on the menu ? 
  how precious . 
  that 's * exactly * the problem . 
   vegans do n't even get catered to at all , most of the time . 
  we just go out to eat . 
  but that 's your * choice * . 
  you * chose * to be a vegan/vegetarian and have to look for places that offer products according to your tastes . 
  it ** is ** a problem that i 'm limited to eating a subset of items on the menu because * i did n't chose to * . 
  there should be options to eat halal meat , or not eat meat at all if you so feel like , but there 's ** literally ** no reason at all to eliminate the option altogether . 
  it does n't even makes sense from a religious point of view , because no muslim in his right mind is going to stop eating at a place just because they serve pork . 
  they would n't have the chance to eat in 80 % of the first world . 
  thank god you 're always there to show us the way * not * to go . 
  `` you know what you european types need ? 
  * less socialism *  _  ''  actual quote from a louisianian friend . 
  you should visit / r/badpolitics 80 % of the sub is devoted to debunk charts that put national socialism as a leftist ideology . 
  it 's weird . 
  there 's a greater difference between 2010 and 2050 than between 2050 and 2100 . 
  is it because a real difference , or just because we ca n't really imagine how much different things will be by then ? 
  also , why so much difference between papua new guinea and indonesia ? 
  probably irish . 
  though i like italian too . 
  my least favorite ? 
  that incredibly posh london r.p. 
  accent ( i prefer the thickest southern american accent to that ) and andalusian spanish ( even though both latin american spanish and the canarian spanish are based on it ) . 
  darn it . 
  i was gon na go with necesito , but i was n't sure if it had the same connotations as in spanish . 
  it 's kinda sad how transparent this call for attention is . 
  he might as well just dropped his pants on the street and start screaming *** attenzione attenzione ho bisogno attenzione !!!, 
  *** would have been much more interesting too . 
  ( also , that was probably terrible italian , methinks ... ),
