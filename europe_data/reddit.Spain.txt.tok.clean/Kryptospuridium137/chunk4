  well , is this really surprising ? 
  they 're against eu , and they 'll vote against the eu regardless of the topic at hand because they do n't care . 
  they just want to see the eu fail , that 's the entire point of their existence . 
  otherwise they would keep to british politics instead of seeking a position in an organization they do n't stop criticizing . 
  ... what ? 
   between immigrants and skilled workers from countries other than your own what 's the difference again ? 
  i 've got a friend from colombia who 's got a degree in sociology , is he not an immigrant because he 's skilled ? 
  you 're making a distinction between immigrants and skilled workers , when there 's none , or do you really think all immigrants are unskilled laborers ? 
  that 's the russian way , dah . 
  but a nation is n't a state , though . 
  i think the problem lies on both sides of the argument not using the same terms . 
  the spanish government wants to see the autonomias as the same entity as the state , which they are n't . 
  and the catalan government wants to see the autonomias as separate states , which they are n't . 
  they 're nations inside a state , with varying degrees of autonomy . 
  as i see it , it 's not a matter of making the separatists into `` the other '' or as enemies of the state , they are n't . 
  they 're a different nation under the same state ( not unlike what a federal europe could look like ) . 
  i think the debate lies in the separation between what has more weight , being part of a nation inside a state or being part of an autonomous state . 
  i do n't really know why scotland is being blocked in their attempt to secede . 
  i mean , in the spanish case there 's at least the uncertainty of recognizing a nation inside the spanish state as it 's own or as part of the state . 
  in scotland 's case there 's no such distinction , though , because scotland is already internationally recognized as a separate entity from the rest of the uk . 
  i really do n't know what 's the logic behind it is . 
   you would need to assert that secessionists were essentially agents of another state but they are . 
  the members of any secessionist movement consider themselves not part of an established country , but members of their own nation and just ask to be recognized as one . 
  the fact that they are n't recognized officially as a different nation does n't mean that they do n't consider themselves as such . 
  in the case of spain is the right of self-determination of the catalan state to be recognized as an autonomous nation vs the right of the spanish state to keep it 's territorial integrity . 
  in the case of scotland , i 'd argue that it 's even more clearly so . 
  as scotland is already a recognized nation state , which just seeks to further separate themselves from the united kingdom .

  nothing says you ca n't be a federalist without also believing the right to self-determination is superseded by the principle of territorial integrity . 
  after el chiqui chiqui we do n't deserve to win at anything music-related ever again . 
  and is not enough punishment . 
  spain wo n't . 
  so you get to be an awesome nordic country , get hot swedish girls * and * keep the meditarranean beaches and climate ? 
  ... where do i sign up ? 
   we 've never been very good at being catholics well , i 'm not so sure about that part ... 
  but yeah , i do n't think there 's a ban on selling booze on viernes santo . 
  just keep an eye open , sicily . 
  you never know ... 
  i 'm not so sure about that considering countries like spain rely heavily in both tourism and underground water supplies . 
  two things fracking * could * hurt pretty badly if gone wrong . 
  my bet would be on nuclear power . 
  the initial investment and the switch would be pretty costly , but in the end it would be safer , cleaner and more efficient than what we have now . 
  and we could easily buy the necessary materials from africa and south america or , heck , [ produce them ourselves ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_uranium_reserves ) . 
  it 's mostly what you said : brainwashing . 
  people have been taught this stupid idea that all nuclear plants are one earthquake away from becoming nukes and killing half of the country , it 's just nuts . 
  you have the far left pushing for renewables , even though they are n't as efficient and ca n't be used in a good chunk of the country , you have the right pushing to keep the status quo because `` muh businesses ! '', 
  and then you have the average folk crying about how unsafe radiation is and what not . 
  i ca n't think of a safer place to have nuclear plants than western europe ... 
  i do n't really know how starbucks makes a living , really . 
  at least over here in spain you have bars and the like every couple of streets , and you get to have a cup of coffee for an euro or less , so really , the difference in prices and the amount of competition it 's baffling . 
  the same happens with subway , imo . 
  you can eat a bocadillo in pretty much every single one of those same bars for half of the price you eat a 15 cm sub in subway . 
  there 's simply not much reason to go there . 
  well , they 're using the money for their personal tourism , so ... ^ ^ / s, 
  but you ca n't have your cake and eat it too . 
  you ca n't get to have someone else securing your borders and then also want to have the moral high ground to criticize them when they decide to make the border more secure . 
  it 's either let 's help spain dig a deeper ditch at the border , or spain 's a piece of shit for digging that ditch , but not both . 
   unless putin wants to go down in history as the greatest lunatic to ever rule . 
  the scary part is that does n't sounds so out of character for him ... 
   we need to build 200 metre high wall in the mediterranean sea , just like in game of thrones would that make us wildlings ? 
  ~ ~ i 'm ok with this . ~ ~, 
  at first , i thought he had * really * saggy breasts ... 
  in a move that surprised no-one . 
  the spanish government will never accept a catalan , or basque or galician independence . 
  and no european government will accept it either . 
  it 's much more worthwhile for both parties to try and compromise than to throw a tantrum and say `` and now i 'm going to draw a line in the middle of the apartment . 
  this is my side and that 's your side ! '' . 
  especially when one side loses the kitchen and the other loses the door . 
  b-but i love her ... ; ~ ;, 
  wtf , man . 
  my mail-order bride is arriving next week !, 
  do you want me to return her !? 
  * i 'm very lonely !!!, 
  i prefer the term `` freedom fighter '' ^ ** tm ** thank you . 
  you sound like a terrorist to me . 
  * especially * zombies . 
  that people should get some more hobbiest . 
  ones that do n't include damaging property and/or people , preferably . 
  wow , that 's genuinely scary ... 
  i call it the eric cartman effect . 
  * scene two opens with hitler reading the `` v\u00f6lkisch observer '' at the breakfast table . 
  eva braun is besides him doing the dishes * hitler : ** nein nein nein nein nein !, 
  ** * canned laughter * eva : vhats vrong , honey ? 
  hitler : just look at this : `` poland to receive a new diplomatic envoy from germany amidst negotiations for a joint defense treaty against ze red menace . '', 
  eva : but zat 's good , right ? 
  * hitler takes off glasses * hitler : no , eva !, 
  ve should n't be joining vith poland !, 
  * ve should be conquering zem !!!, 
  * * hitler starts hitting the table and his glass of orange juice falls on his lap * hitler : *** ze juice !!!, 
  *** * canned laughter as the screen fades to black *, 
   a good part of them seems pretty determined to have their own thing . 
  not really . 
  as i see it , the big majority of the ones who are pushing for independence really just want more autonomy . 
  but since their government is n't presenting that option ( just `` stay the same vs. independence '' ) they 're siding with independence . 
  every spanish institution has already said that , no , they ca n't actually decide to become independent without the rest of the country also agreeing to it , and that 's never going to happen . 
  not only will the spanish government never allow it , but no european country will ever accept it . 
  it would just give an example to all other independentists movements that `` hey guys , we can do it too ! '' .
