  so we 'll see the referendum to decide whether they independize or not come and go . 
  maybe it 'll win , maybe it wo n't . 
  whatever the result both sides will keep spewing stupid rhetoric to one another until either the next government or the current one grows tired of it , settles a few minor points with the catalan government so they can save face and then they 'll turn around and scream '' *** victory ! *** '' . 
  by that time , the worst of the economic crisis will have already passed , so everyone will just forget about the whole thing until things start to look bleak again . 
  the canary islands also have a separatist movement . 
  but it 's ( thankfully ) ridiculously tiny and made up almost entirely of hardcore right wing old people out of touch with reality * or * hardcore ** left ** wing college kids out of touch with reality . 
  god bless you . 
  even if these whole russian invasion is eventually accepted ( which it will , since no country can do a thing about it by now ) it 's still a good idea to diversify your sources of important resources . 
  one country having that kind of leverage against half of an entire continent is never good , especially considering there 's relatively simple alternatives nearby ( either algeria or norway ) . 
  do n't put all your eggs in one basket . 
  `` i also put down my towel the moment i arrive and not at 5 in the morning ... and do n't wear shoes to the beach either . '', 
   * gasp *  * she faints *, 
  huh ... 
  interesting ... 
  wait , * she 's married ? 
  * i 've never , ** ever ** heard about her husband , and she 's been chancellor for 10 fucking years ... 
  you ca n't make vodka out of corn . 
  which is kind of an interesting case , since ( as far as i understand anyway ) somalia is essentially stateless . 
  so in that case is less recognizing the secession of a country and more the formation of a new country after the fall of an old one . 
  makes me wonder why it is n't recognized . 
  i honestly do n't understand it . 
  they have their own government , can freely speak their own language , have * a lot * of leeway to establish their own laws and policies . 
  i do n't see what the point of all of this is . 
  this is not francoist times , where you could be imprisoned or killed for simply speaking catalan , what `` oppression '' are they escaping ? 
  what exactly is so bad about the current model ? 
  and why exactly ca n't be fixed ? 
  the current spanish democracy has existed for less than 40 years , so can we really say it 's unfixable ? 
  officially , it is n't . 
  it may have its own currency , government and even language , but without recognition it 'll never officially be a country . 
  it 'll never join the united nations , and most of the diplomatic relations it maintains are under the chinese-approved name of chinese taipei . 
  as far as international relations are concerned , they are a city-state inside the country of china . 
  not necessarily . 
  * most * people would agree taiwan is an independent country , but for political reasons they ca n't . 
  both north and south korea do n't recognize the other as a legitimate government . 
  and for 50 years the vatican did n't recognize the kingdom of italy as a legitimate government . 
  supporting catalonia now would mean accepting separatists movements as a whole . 
  so britain ca n't support them , spain obviously wo n't , and any other country with separatist movements in its borders ( read : a whole lot of them . 
  especially china and russia ) wo n't either . 
  it 's a really messy issue all around . 
  it 's not really hard talk , it 's literally how it works . 
  as a new sovereign nation you cut all ties to the country you separate from , and that includes membership in organizations and all agreements . 
  you start from scratch . 
  it does n't work that way . 
  recognition is what makes a country a country , if 90 % of the world does n't recognizes you as a country then you are n't one . 
  this is why sealand or molossia are n't countries , but monaco is . 
  it 's not even about their own children . 
  their children become vectors of disease for other people 's kids , and then what ? 
  i do n't care if it 's `` your '' kid , you should n't be allowed to put other people in danger for your stupid pseudo-ludite views . 
  you can check out [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europes/comments/3s4f6b/catalan_parliament_approves_declaration_of/ ) post in / r/europes if you 'd like . 
  i took the time to translate it in the comments . 
  it 's pretty short , but comes from a national newspaper . 
  the whole gig between rajoy and mas is actually pretty blatant , so it 's surprising more people are n't calling it out : one goes : `` well , * i * am the top dog here , so take this mas ! '', 
  and the other goes : `` excellent , all the more reason to make myself look like a victim !, 
  time for another tantrum . '', 
  one `` looks tough '' on catalonia and pleases the voters in a completely empty way , the other `` has proof '' of the `` oppression '' of the central government and pleases the voters in a completely empty way . 
  all the while nothing is resolved or gained and the demagogy continues . 
  what , you *** do n't *** speak european ? 
  i 've never seen the point of a kettle . 
  ca n't you just use a pot ? 
  i know that kettles are super cheap and all , and there 's fancy electric ones that can be configured to a specific time and everything . 
  but the whole thing just seems kinda wasteful to me . 
  pots are cheap too , and you can use them for something other than heat up water ...

  yeah , i do n't think negro by itself has the same connotations as in english . 
  that 's just how you refer to a black person , it 's not a slur . 
  negrata is despective no matter the context , but negro is much more nuanced . 
  hell , it can be used to affectionately call a person that is n't even black . 
  [ good example .

  corruption . 
  mostly because my family wo n't shut up every time the thing comes up on the news , but they wo n't stop voting for those same corrupt politicians because `` oh they 're fixing the country ! '', 
  and `` oh but the alternative is podemos !,

  i 'm 23 and we still do the o thing . 
  it 's fun ... 
  do n't forget the * other * weird sport with stones and brooms . 
   i will be actually happy if all this leads to the closure of the us military bases in spain though . 
  our politicians are too spineless for that , but i 'd be oh so happy to see the yanks kicked out . 
  we are not south korea , we do not need american boots in our soil . 
  he actually pulled it off , but [ he 's as surprised as anyone else ] ( https://youtu.be/asfcsvqsqfa?t=1m34s ) . 
  it 's great . 
  surprised nobody has said this , but vladimir putin is like a stereotypical cartoon villain turned real . 
  he 's : * rich , * surrounded by and only caring about other rich people , * boastful and prideful , * obsessed with projecting a `` tough guy '' image , * manipulative , * cold and uncaring , * part of a now-defunct intelligence agency , * [ some kind of wizard ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/peoplefuckingdying/comments/6emo37/russian_wizard_forces_bird_to_perform_nazi_salute/ ) he 's cobra commander by way of mr. burns .

  i can hear my neighbor screaming . 
  i shared apartments with a guy from leicester a couple years back . 
  finding new ways to annoy him was like a sport to me :p, 
  but i like the taste of non-ionizing radiation . 
  i also like to leave the baggie inside the cup until i 'm done drinking it , and then squeeze all the liquid out . 
  that 's actually hilarious, 
  ok , i 'm gon na need some context on the pineapple thing ... 
  do n't forget to mention how you thought scots was just accented english , and to ask why does n't everyone speaks with a glasgow accent . 
  be sure to point out how you were expecting more taquerias , and to ask the other person when the next bullfight starts .
