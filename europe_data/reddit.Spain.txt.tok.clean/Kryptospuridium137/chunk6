  i 'm on my way to adding mayonnaise to my fish and chips i 'll be eating with microwaved tea . 
  you 'll start a close , personal friendship with a knife . 
  do you want to traumatize him for life ? 
  well , personally , i 'd say venezuela . 
  my grandfather and two of his brothers emigrated there as teenagers , and we 've had a lot of family coming to and from over the years ( though lately there 's been a lot more from than to ... ) . 
  one of my best friends growing up was venezuelan too , so i 've always had more contact with that country . 
  i imagine it varies from person to person , though . 
  i would n't say there 's one specific country or region * most * spaniards had a connection to . 
  ok , but you have to include belgium in the deal too . 
  i am actually ok with this . 
  i definitely think of latin america as culturally very close , even if latin america at large is more conservative than spain as a whole . 
  ( your region might vary ) i definitely would like to see more cooperation between the two regions , but i 'm meh on immigration to and from . 
  as for the philippines , i got no problem with 'em . 
  but i do n't really think of filipinos as culturally that close to us anymore , and there 's very little we share imo .

  same . 
  my friend from leicester would always get mad if he saw me heating water for tea on the microwave cuz `` it heats up the water unevenly ! '', 
  but it 's all the same to me . 
  and about half of that 52 % is gon na be feeling scared and angry veeeeeeeery soon ... 
  milk and dairy . 
  but mostly milk . 
  me in the morning : `` fuck , i forgot to buy water ... meh , i 'll just drink from the tap today i guess . '', 
  also me in the morning : '' [ we 're out of milk for my coffee ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqi1fvp6rbw ) '', 
  [ map men map men map map map men men ] ( https://youtu.be/enecywms-cc ), 
  italian for sure . 
  it pretty melodic and sometimes it sounds like everyone goes around speaking in sonnets . 
  non-european then japanese . 
  i would n't even know how to do that in the first place , so ... 
  i got a good one !, 
  not the country , but my island . 
  [ we are flag buddies ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/flag_of_tenerife.svg/750px-flag_of_tenerife.svg.png ) !, 
  nobody is ** quite ** sure why we share a flag . 
  some say it 's simply a coincidence , st. andrew 's cross was already the flag of spain at the time , and blue and white were chosen to represent the sea and the snowy peak of the teide . 
  but that 's boring . 
  both of the other alternative explanations i 've read about do involve scotland , though . 
  one says we chose that flag to honor the scottish sailors who valiantly fought during the battle of st. cruz , in which we repelled a british invasion and in which admiral nelson lost his arm . 
  the other one is that it comes from local members of the ancient and accepted scottish rite of freemasonry , who chose this flag to honor the scottish roots of the order . 
  but that one 's a lot more flimsy imo , it basically boils down to `` there 's a freemason lodge in tenerife '' and `` there 's an order of freemasons called scottish '' , case closed . 
  [ that first top post . 
   the middle age era was very short in lithuania huh . 
  how so ? 
  eh , that 's the start of the word , tbh ... first syllable . 
  it 's also not so much a feature of the language as much as a coincidence . 
  must be a day ending in y then . 
  see , i disagree . 
  `` dialogue '' with intolerant people leads to nothing because 99 % of the time , intolerant people do n't want to discuss anything , they just want a space to proselytize from . 
  i 'm absolutely fine with intolerant people feeling oppressed and resented , they * should * , they * should * feel their shit opinions are not acceptable and are not tolerated , and they * should * find it hard to spread their vitriol to others . 
  their ideologies ** should ** be kept at bay the same way you keep septic waste away from your drinking well . 
  the average american 's idea of freedom of speech , a.k.a. 
  `` everyone should be able to say anything they want anywhere at any time with no consequences '' , is exactly part of the reason why they 're having such a problem with racism and why they 're slowly sinking into downright fascism : because the fascists and the racists are finding it easier and easier to speak up and spread their shit ideas to people who would n't normally express those ideas . 
  that 's kinda weird to think about ... 
  though i always prefer to use shop bathrooms since they 're usually cleaner , but still ...  besides that it 's not yet 10pm here , so no april fools . 
  right ... timezones . 
  uh ... are you ... you are joking right ... ? 
  it * is * april 's fools ... 
  ( * the entire country of switzerland turns into a land mine * ) switzerland : feeling lucky , punk ? 
  same . 
  to be fair , i do n't trust the opposition either . 
  oh man , you 're crazy . 
  i love me some callos . 
  i hate to be the messenger of bad news , but considering how the democrats have been acting recently , i do n't see them reflecting on their actions and going back to the left . 
  in reality the american overton window has been shifting further and further to the right since at least reagan , maybe nixon . 
  with the democrats acting as spineless idiots and bending over for the republicans and their center to center right voting base . 
  i only see them going even further to the right , considering sanders was never favored by the party and hillary * technically * did pool better than il douche . 
  either way , you guys have four years , ** maybe ** even eight before the next serious presidential election . 
  you need to organize and start promoting third parties and actually taking your local elections seriously . 
  you might not get the presidency , but the more sane governors , mayors and the like you have the more you 'll be able to move proposals forward , and the more people there 'll be to oppose people like trump . 
  and by god , start kicking congressmen out of office . 
  it 's insane you have had congressmen who have served for over 50 years with no opposition . 
  ( according to wikipedia the longest ever tenure for a senator was 51 years . 
  from 59 to *** 2010 *** ), 
  get rid of the electoral college . 
  establish a movement for people to learn more about their local politics . 
  it 's stupid you keep voting for the president that 'll `` change everything '' instead of starting from your local elections and moving up . 
  this would also help strengthen third parties . 
  educate the people properly on policies and terms : what socialism actually means and what it entails , what an ammendment is and what the founding fathers thought of them , why `` we 're too big / diverse '' is not a real reason it to not have basic social programs , how `` obamacare '' and `` obamaphones '' are not an actual thing but a silly name . 
  that 's enough work for a couple generations so let 's stop here . 
  spaniard here . 
  never seen a broken ice cream machine there . 
  i * have * seen them run out of milk for the coffee machine early in the morning but that 's it . 
  man , that sounds amazing . 
  not the ... y' know , not the getting mocked part , but the other stuff . 
  i do think erasmus is a great programme , but at least in my experience , it does n't really serve its purpose of cooperation and interaction between the international and national students . 
  i became really good friends with this girl from bavaria last semester , and she told me she was kinda sad because she could never really `` click '' with the people here . 
  she spent a lot more time with the other german students than spaniards because she was never invited to anything and she felt like she had to force herself on people just to be included . 
  it really made me think about it , because i thought we were a really inclusive bunch ( hell , we receive like 8 million tourists a year , we * have * to be inclusive ... 
  right ... ? ), 
  but in hindsight you always see the german erasmus with other germans , and the brits with the brits and so on . 
  there 's almost no contact beyond the superficial and the odd party . 
  it 's kinda sad . 
  yup !, 
  fair enough . 
  that 's a pretty interesting historical quirk : a vietnamese exclave on czechia because of communism . 
  i never thought there 'd be a large vietnamese community in germany , but that makes sense . 
  i see ... that 's pretty interesting . 
   most of them are not the citizens though , according to the 2011 census only 824 czech citizens declare vietnamese nationality . 
  so are they all just on work visas or a similar programme ? 
   vietnamese one of these things is not like the others,
