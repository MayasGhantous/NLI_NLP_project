  i really need to visit madrid again ... 
  i 've only been there twice , and both times for a couple days only ... 
  i 've only been to the street-level stuff , like the museo del jam\u00f3n and puerta del sol and such , and once to the zoo aquarium and the bernabeu , but have n't seen the real interesting , historical stuff . 
  i was expecting the stairs from rocky and got a scene from a romantic comedy ... 
   her delivery was completely emotionless . 
  she would describe horrors and monstrosities that happened dozens of years ago right where we were standing , and she did that with no emotion , no change in intonation . 
  it was not ignorance , it was complete , absolute lack of emotion . 
  still gives me chills . 
  i mean , when you 've talked about the same thing every day probably for years , you 're gon na stop caring eventually . 
  good lord , look at that queue ... 
  i 'm a 20 minute drive from [ the highest non-hawaiian volcano in the world ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/teide_a\u00f1o_2011.jpg ) . 
  it 's dormant now , but it 's predicted it 'll probably erupt sometime in the near future . 
  & gt ; we are on pretty good terms with france and spain & gt ; the uk seems to just not care for us yes , yes . 
  no reason to worry , ~ ~ colonial ~ ~ fellow european . 
  we are * friends * now .

  that 's a nice short word . 
  fosas nasales is way too long and unwieldy ... 
  afaik they 're called fosas nasales ( `` nasal pits '' ) but that 's not very used in common speech . 
  i 'd just call them holes tbh or just refer to the whole thing as nose . 
  europe , which is your favorite nostril ? 
  the ones i always remember are toy and tool : spielzeug and werkzeug spiel = game werk = work zeug = thing / stuff stuff for playing , stuff to work . 
  super straightforward .

   blat de moro i mean , indian wheat makes sense . 
  but moor 's wheat ... ? 
  interestingly , a venezuelan friend calls peas petip\u00faa , probably from the french petit pois . 
  why would a french word for peas end up in venezuela is a fascinating question imo . 
  it 's genuinely horrifying stuff , if i 'm completely honest . 
  the idea that any day you could just have an accident or fall ill and then be tens of thousands of dollars in debt sounds downright terrifying . 
  because of austerity bullshit the current spanish right wing government has had a stiffy for privatizing hospitals to reduce public spending , but i 'm thankful people have for the most part refused the idea . 
  exactly the same in spain except change caf\u00e9 for bar xp though i guess you could say our bars work more like a caf\u00e9 would elsewhere, 
  i 'm laughing so hard now . 
  people might think we 're obsessed with shitting on things ...

  this is the only right answer . 
  the emperor protects , brother . 
  ouch . 
  that 's harsh . 
  that first one is pure, 
  depends on the region , i guess . 
  i think in most of spain it would be something like hill or mountain , since those are so common . 
  `` field '' would fit a lot of places too . 
  here in the canaries it would probably be barranco ( gully / ravine ) or cueva ( cave ) . 
  i mean , is there anyone left who ** does n't ** know smoking is bad for you ? 
  most people just do n't care . 
  i know i do n't . 
  i 'd say i know more people who do n't smoke that people who do , but not ** a lot ** more , and older people smoke more than younger people , but again , not a whole lot more in my experience . 
  as in many other places in europe , smoking indoors in most places is forbidden , and you also ca n't smoke around a certain radius from hospitals and schools . 
  the [ most recent numbers ] ( http://www.abc.es/sociedad/20151021/abci-caida-fumadores-diarios-201510211358.html ) i could find say :  the number of people who identify as `` daily smokers '' fell from 26,2 % in 2009 to 23 % in 2014  of these daily smokers , 18,5 % are between 15 and 24 years old  2,4 % say they smoke occasionally  25,7 % say they 're ex smokers  and 49 % say they 've never smoked, 
  we have this one as well . 
  til germans are honorary [ indians ] ( https://youtu.be/lg3klsisrec?t=3m36s ) . 
  well , but what constitutes a `` people '' ? 
  and why stop at ethnic groups ? 
  plenty of modern states are formed from several different ethnic groups , after all , are they all a unified `` people '' since they want to form a unified nation ? 
  and what is the cutoff point for that right ? 
  say my neighborhood is 95 % colombian , and we do n't really like the current spanish government , has my neighborhood , a distinct ethnic group in a specific region , enough of a cause to secede ? 
  what if i extend it to the whole city , but now include all latinos and some moroccans , and we make up 51 % of the population ? 
  it really is a complicated issue . 
  outside of rural areas , especially in the south , not very religious anymore , and the number is dwindling with every generation . 
  spain is not even close to being the bastion of catholicism foreigners , especially anglos , paint it as . 
  my view on organized religion is complex . 
  i generally believe it is a net benefit in people 's lives as it gives people a sense of belonging and unity that 's not really achieved through other , smaller means . 
  rituals and beliefs are a powerful thing that can genuinely improve people 's lives and unite them more than simple laic symbols and tenuous ideas like `` the nation '' or `` race '' or whatever can . 
  on the other hand , it is undeniably true all organized religions are guilty of excesses and missteps that should n't be forgotten and that they should be accountable for . 
  and it is also true that , at least in the west , the disillusionment with organized religion is more than anything the church 's own fault more than any moral failings of society . 
  i also believe more education on the matter is needed , as both believers and nonbelievers have fundamental misconceptions about the catholic church 's teachings that imo cause unnecessary hostilities . 
  ( to be clair i 'm not advocating religion as a subject in schools or anything of the sort , but simply talking about the spreading of information in general ), 
  well , what do you define as `` reasonable '' ? 
  some would say it is reasonable to allow the freedom to any one region to secede at any time for any reason if enough people there agree to it , simply because it is their right to decide what nation they want to belong to , if any . 
  others would say it is reasonable to not allow secession under any reason because far more people would be negatively affected by the actions of the few that would ( or would not , depending on the outcome ) benefit , both outside and inside the seceding region . 
  whichever of the two arguments you consider `` reasonable '' depends entirely on you personally . 
  hahahaha my thoughts exactly, 
  firmly pro-life unless the woman 's or baby 's life is in danger , in the case of rape , or if doctors decide the baby might not live long enough to be born anyways . 
  abstinence-only is stupid and dangerous . 
  we should provide further sex education at an early age , and subsidize birth control for both men and women . 
  i fundamentally disagree with other `` pro-life '' people in this point , but i agree that a fetus should n't be discarded . 
   final volume why are they stopping ? 
  hmmmm ... 
  i do n't know , i would say we might tend to sugarcoat things a bit but not overly so imo . 
  i have plenty of american friends , and i have n't noted a difference in how we break things to others , but i do n't have enough experience with scandinavians or dutch people so there might be a difference there ... 
  that would be the [ dictionary of the spanish language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diccionario_de_la_lengua_espa%c3%b1ola ) ( previously dictionary of the royal spanish academy ) . 
  the first edition , published 1780 , had 46000 entries . 
  the most recent 2014 edition had 93000 entries . 
  unlike in many other languages , though , the spanish royal academy and its dictionary were ** the ** authority in matters of language , whatever they said was the correct way of speaking and writing was *** the *** way you had to do it and the way you had to be taught . 
  until very recently , they had a very prescriptivist approach in that they ( with some guidelines from institutions from other spanish speaking countries ) explicitly advocated for specific rules to talk and ( specially ) write with in an attempt to ensure that spanish did n't diverge too much from its original roots and that spanish remained understandable and unified no matter where it was spoken . 
  nowadays , their rules are more like guidelines , however . 
  and they 've taken much more of a descriptivist role : simply charting changes in language and describing them . 
  that 's why they changed the name of the dictionary , from ** the ** spanish royal academy dictionary , to a more neutral and balanced dictionary of the spanish language .
