  old habits die hard , though , and they 've been very vocal in their hate of borrowings from other languages , especially english . 
  almost all english words have been adapted into spanish equivalents , like changing paddle to p\u00e1del , airbag to airb\u00e1g , or demanding that completely foreign words like ballet or jazz be written in cursive or in quotations to mark them as foreign . 
  i 'd say republicanism is generally tied to the pure left and with separatism , so it 's not really super represented in politics and not something the common person cares about . 
  [ latest poll i could find has support for the monarchy at 61.5 % ] ( http://e04-elmundo.uecdn.es/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2015/06/14/14343133311789.jpg ), 
  can you elaborate what you mean ? 
  \u0ca0_\u0ca0 i can just feel the ushanka . 
  hey its me ur fabulously wealthy nigerian prince i need some mon - * wait * ... 
  hey its me ur brother i just inherited the brooklyn bridge from our long-lost grandfather but i do n't want it . 
  can you buy it ? 
  i 'm selling it for 3000 $ pls respond, 
  well , in greek i imagine it 's a little different , since you guys have words like sphynx . 
  but in spanish , the letter s always has to be accompanied by a vowel , either before or after . 
  so special becomes especial , sphynx is esfinge , scale becomes escala , and so on . 
  for native spanish speakers is very hard to pronounce a lone s for this reason : you simply will never see one unless you start learning a foreign language . 
  and since people are n't used to them , they unconsciously add an e at the start when pronouncing them . 
  so especial k cereal , and such ... 
  it 's a really hard habit to break . 
   wewuzzery this is my new favorite word . 
  touch\u00e9 though i do n't know if indians are considered `` asians '' in common speech ... 
  i think they would be considered their own thing . 
  indio / hind\u00fa vs chino, 
  oh for sure . 
  it 's pretty disrespectful and you normally would n't call a person chinese if you knew they were from somewhere else . 
  but it would be the most common assumption if you asked the average person . 
  asian = chinese . 
  east asia . 
  ( though i would never call an asian person `` oriental '' . 
  not because it 's racist , but because it sounds weird . 
  you 'd normally just call them chinese . ), 
  to be fair , you guys have like , the second fucking coolest anthem ever invented , behind maybe the soviet anthem . 
  it 's about ** watering the fields with the blood of your enemies ** , ffs . 
  with onion . 
  ^ ^ ^ 1vs1mem8, 
  nope . 
  i absolutely want closer economic ties with china now that america has proven once and for all to be not only not an ally , but downright an enemy of europe . 
  but i do n't want any foreign militaries in european soil . 
  kick nato out , and let us defend ourselves . 
  iirc , up to 40 % of iceland used to be forests . 
  but that plummeted to 1 % from a combination of human activity and volcanoes . 
  and do n't you dare say we maybe should n't name streets after fascists . 
  we must ** protect ** ~ ~ symbols of fascism ~ ~ history !, 
  very much not legal . 
  article 543 of the penal code says : `` the offense or insult of word , written word or fact to spain , its autonomous communities , or to its symbols or emblems , carried out publicly , will be punished with the penalty of fines or between seven and twelve months [ of prison ] . '', 
  this also includes things like burning a picture of any of the members of the crown , for example . 
  all of which i find appalling . 
  well , that 's true . 
  but there 's some unexpectedly simple things that can affect life massively . 
  for example , if earth 's rotation was faster than it is , erosion would also be multiplied exponentially , to the point that after a few billion years most of the land would 've eroded away . 
  less land means less space for life to develop and less of a chance for intelligent life to develop . 
  without the earth 's tilt and the seasons , temperature would stratify in bands , getting progressively colder and colder from the equator . 
  so a planet without seasons would be ** much ** * much * colder than earth , at much lower latitudes , so it would have a lot less biodiversity and less of a chance for intelligent life to develop . 
  and that 's not even getting into the most common things that can affect life like being at the correct distance from their star , having liquid water in the planet , breathing oxygen , developing sexual reproduction , developing mitochondria , and so on and so forth . 
  that 's totally my fault . 
  i misread your post ... 
  still , though , that 's quite the mishap . 
  hmmmm , [ polish pavement ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/16/8f/c2/168fc228b82500f528b4dbf6209a4ff8.jpg ) ... 
  i want to believe we 're not alone , but the more i look into it the idea of ever finding another alien civilization seems more and more unlikely to me . 
  from dead planet to planet with life , from life to complex life , from complex life to sentient life , from sentient life to technological life , from technological life to spacefaring life . 
  the amount of `` filters '' life has to go through to reach the stage we have is astonishing . 
   ( no idea why ) gypsies . 
  yeah , definitely some sort of food stamp program , where people below a certain threshold get subsidies towards basic food items could be worked on . 
  and it probably would n't be ** that ** expensive overall . 
  i think the biggest issue out of the fourth is the healthcare , really . 
  arrangements can be made towards towards the other three , even if it means things like subsidizing transportation to far-away schools instead of building new ones , or having shared apartments for poor families instead of individual houses . 
  you know , to drive down the price so the deficit does n't just balloons out of control . 
  but it 's not like you can share someone else 's treatment , and building more hospitals does n't changes the price of the treatment , so out of the three it could be the least sustainable : / at least in our current economy . 
  maybe in another system it would work better . 
  & gt ; los amigos invisibles a venezuelan friend introduced me to that band back in highschool . 
  i love their laid-back style . 
  i 'm doing the equivalent of an english ba . 
  almost all of my teachers are british , except for three spaniards , one australian and one canadian . 
  no americans . 
  well , yeah , that 's true . 
  and even offering free education to everyone , plenty of people still drop out of highschool , but that 's not really the point . 
  we have to offer * access * to the housing . 
  if they do n't take it , well , that 's another issue , but access should never be denied . 
  [ last year there were 3,569 people living in the streets in england , and around 14,670 households are considered temporary accommodations . 
  yet there are 610,123 empty homes in england , of which 205,821 have been unfurbished or unnocopied for a period of at least 2 years . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/mar/10/empty-homes-england-scotland-homelessness ) in other words , in england alone , counting ** just ** the long-term unnocupied houses , there are almost ten times as many empty houses as homeless people . 
  in the us it 's [ 8.9 million empty homes to 3.5 million homeless people . 
  ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-skip-bronson/post_733_b_692546.html ) or more than twice as many empty homes than homeless people . 
  we ** easily ** could offer proper housing to every citizen of the western world , and have plenty to spare . 
  but we do n't because it 's immoral to give people something if some other person is not profiting from it . 
  i 'm sure if you looked up the numbers for food , healthcare and education it would be similar . 
  this kind of depends on who you ask , really . 
  i 've seen people include northern california into cascadia , others also include parts of idaho and even parts of alaska . 
  it 's not a clear-cut thing . 
  not to mention emergency services being more expensive than preventive care , and the loss of productivity from working while sick would quickly pile on to make any savings from denying care dissappear . 
  of course . 
  the four essential rights are : the right to food , the right to healthcare , the right to an education and the right to a place to live . 
  any society that does n't provide all four to * all * of its citizens is a failure , in my opinion , because it can not even offer its citizens the most basic necessities . 
  wow , really ? 
  honestly if push comes to shove , oregon and washington should secede too and form cascadia between the three of them . 
  i 'd migrate there in a heartbeat . 
  same . 
  i 've been religiously voting every time i can since i turned 18 , but i 've never felt like i was voting for something i * wanted * . 
  just voting ** against ** something else . 
  i totally agree with you , but i honestly do n't think breaking away will help them . 
  they will still most likely be out of the eu and with no way of coming back in because spain will * never * vote in favor of a break away state joining the eu , that would just embolden the catalan nationalists . 
  there * might * be a chance we allow it if england recognizes the partition , spain recognizes south sudan and montenegro but not kosovo for this reason , but i honestly doubt it .
