  britain . 
  both scotland and england do n't seem like particularly interesting places to me ... could also be because parts of tenerife are already little britain to be fair . 
  edit : i totally forgot wales is part of gb too ... 
  i 'd say it 's forbidden but not very prosecuted . 
  unless you come across a shithead cop or are being super rowdy , they should leave you alone . 
  at worst they night tell you to go somewhere else in my experience . 
  haha xp well , to be fair , you at least would n't be the only sunburned tourists :p where will you be playing ? 
  in the north or the south ? 
  fair enough . 
  like i 've said , it 's really not that big of a deal , so it 's a bit weird for me to think as something exotic or bizarre :p, 
  fair enough . 
  i can get that ... 
  well , it is * a little * weird . 
  since its made with blood and all . 
  i could see people being a little weirded out by that , even though i like it . 
  i 'm sure you 'll have a good time !, 
   at around that time it should be a little warmer , so make sure to go to the beach a lot :p i. . . would n't recommend * everyone * to live here . 
  it 's a small place and stuff does n't happen often . 
  i would n't recommend it to someone who lives in a hectic capital city and likes that life . 
  but if you just want a cheap , easygoing place to chill and relax , i do n't know of a better place . 
  that 's fair . 
  that 's what i was thinking : black food is just rare . 
  eh , it 's not particularly weird . 
  it 's basically salty water with a * sliiiight * fishy aftertaste . 
  it 's used more for the color than for the taste . 
  i 've been thinking to move to somewhere in northern europe for quite some time now , but i 'm never sure were . 
  denmark , netherlands , germany ... somewhere relatively small , in the countryside , where i can just chill for a time . 
  # *** [ cough cough ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/santa_cruz_de_tenerife ) ***, 
  but why , though ? 
  is it because it 's black ? 
  i like the way you think . 
  it was so bizarre for me to know someone who thinks squid ink is nasty , though . 
  it always seemed fairly normal to me . 
  i 'd consider black pudding or even serrano ham to be weirder ... 
  not local , but a thing that happened to me recently was arguing with an american friend that there 's nothing weird or disgusting about squid ink , and then he telling me [ arroz negro ] ( http://m.melodijolola.com/media/files/arroz-negro-restaurante-isa1_1.jpg ) looked disgusting . 
  which is ** nuts ** to me because that thing is delicious . 
  well , goddamn . 
  fuck this country , man ... 
  on the one hand , iirc the tax was to prop up wind over solar . 
  on the other hand , yeah , it was a pretty stupid idea . 
  i consume all the media i can in english . 
  it 's all the same to me , and english media is usually out faster and is easier to pirate . 
  i mean , that 's far from a dumb idea . 
  part of the reason why western societies are so americanized is because of how * blasted * with american media we are from day one . 
  i 've got no doubt we would see closer ties between eu countries if we were exposed to one another 's cultures more . 
  we have it , but we eat it on the 6th of january : three magi 's day . 
  it 's been my birthday cake 23 years in a row . 
  feet be dirty , yo . 
  i do n't care if you washed them 12 seconds ago , i do n't want them near me . 
  this ^ i would n't take my shoes off in another person 's house unless we were * very * close . 
  but i 'd never wear shoes at home . 
  ha , that 's super cool . 
  too bad they 're closed off , it could be cool to turn some of them into little hostels for people to stay in for a few days . 
  though in the long run , i got ta say [ climate change . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/27/climate-change-rate-to-turn-southern-spain-to-desert-by-2100-report-warns ) [ it 's ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/environment/forests/pdf/meeting140504_wwffirstdocument.pdf ) gon na [ fuck us ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/climate-change-could-see-tourists-avoid-spain-and-go-to-latvia-for-summer-holidays-eu-study-finds-10454643.html ) up [ real good ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/718041/holiday-port-catalonia-spain-barcelona-climate-change-sea-levels-threat-extreme-weather ) . 
  who the fuck thinks pig leg is disgusting ? 
  do n't they have ham in their country ? 
  ffs ... 
   again , i could live under us rule just fine . 
  god , no . 
  we would be like puerto rico ... poor af , abused , and without any real chance of becoming a state ... then again , if the alternative is morocco , then : *** u-s-a u-s-a u-s-a ***, 
  *** ] ( http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/3500/64/16x9/1200.jpg ), 
  took me a while to get that . 
  wow ... how did they even make * that * mistake ... ? 
  i want a painting of that on my wall . 
  so majestic . 
  [ never forget . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tctvihyzejy ), 
  but you 'd have to facilitate people jobs . 
  most people ( in my experience anyway ) leave because they can not find proper jobs . 
  and if you can create jobs that easily you would n't need to keep people from emigrating in the first place . 
  yeah , i have crossed paths with anarchists and even stalinists , but never fascists . 
  canarian nationalists sure , but not outright fascists . 
  well , corruption , as usual . 
  i heard in the news yesterday that , according to the ministry of justice , last year we had 3 people being tried for corruption * a day * ... all the parties but the ruling party are also in crisis . 
  internal infighting and such . 
  almost every day it 's on the news . 
  we 're also in the middle of a really bad flu epidemic , and a lot of hospitals ca n't keep up . 
  they say it 'll only get worse till at least late february ... and there 's still the catalonia issue , that refuses to die out : / the economy is sloooooooowly recovering tho . 
  so its not ** all ** bad i guess . 
  well , it 's not exactly in the middle of the city , but it 's in a corner in a long esplanade with a bunch of restaurants and stuff that also receives cruises from time to time ... 
  so yeah , you 're bound to see it at least once eventually ... 
  i have n't heard the topic brought up in the news at all , but we 're much more focused internally at the moment ... 
  i 'd be against it , though , if for no other reason that it would probably end up hurting us much more than it 'd hurt them . 
  i 'll add that sometimes debate sparks over what to do with the remnants of the francoist regime . 
  with some people calling for the removal of every last bit of francoism from the public eye ( so changing street names , taking down statues , that kinda thing ) and others defending it as a part of history which should n't be forgotten , and most people falling somewhere in between . 
  whatever your stance on the matter , though , i think we can all agree a statue of a hardcore dictator who killed thousands [ riding an angel ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/monumento_a_su_excelencia_el_jefe_del_estado ) is a bit crass . 
  huh . 
  i did n't know that ... was your government opposed to the sanctions ? 
  or was it more of a `` necessary evil '' kinda thing ? 
   mostly because they probably hurt us more than them . 
  i 'm curious . 
  why do you think this ? 
  this guy fucks . 
  a country which seems to have a ** really ** hard time letting go of its hegemonic dreams . 
  they had a czar , and they were hegemonic douchebags . 
  they had a * socialist revolution * , and they were hegemonic douchebags . 
  they have a democratic government , and they 're hegemonic douchebags . 
  no matter what , the constant in russian history seems to be their desire to just rule over as much of their neighbors as they can so they can feel powerful / safe . 
  imo , russia will never be a part of europe .
