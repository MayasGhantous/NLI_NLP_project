yeah , good luck finding them for 1 $ ... 
  france is expensive . 
  even more if we consider paris . 
   now knowing the nurses usually ate the patients ' meals i wouldnt be surprised if someone was dumb enough to pick some personal belonging unprotected . 
   eating food from an ebola patient . 
  that has to be a darwin award . 
  well i 'm going to try and be impartial and give an overview on both sides but i 'm obviously biased so take it with a grain of salt : the 2nd republic was unstable ( hence , the civil war happened ) . 
  it was an highly liberal time , and had some important anarchist and communist movements . 
  the anarchist movement in catalonia was especially important . 
  some unions also promoted revolutions which led to the destruction of machinery and unrest . 
  there was also heavy opposition to the clergy , which had strong influence in spain ( and many economic benefits ) , leading to burning of churches and raping of nuns . 
  people were not happy with this ( especially the falange ) which led the army ( filled with extreme right ) to intervene in a coup d'etat . 
  the army divided , with the vast majority of officers going with the national side . 
  the navy was still in the republican side , but it ended being a nonfactor due to the conflict being inland . 
  so this leads to the civil war . 
  and the reason it 's so controversial , since there are no predetermined sides . 
  obviously some provinces were in one side ( for example , catalonia being republican until the very end ) , but there was still a lot of inner conflicts between all factions , especially in the republican side which had some dislike for stalin 's troops . 
  so you end with a lot of infighting between families , between neighbors and between everything in a big mess . 
  while in the us civil war you can see north and south , if you start looking maps of the scw over time you see rebellions everywhere all the time . 
  in the end , franco wins and the destroyed country tries to get by . 
  with the situation of europe getting worse ( ww2 ) , things go bad : hunger starts biting . 
  the closed policies of franco ( which in retrospective were not a total bad idea since aligning with hitler would have completely devastated spain ) made this worse . 
  smuggling between portugal and france was necessary to survive , but if you got caught you will `` disappear '' . 
  the guardia civil was famous for executing and torturing ( yes , that 's one of the reasons they are hated by half the country now ) . 
  time goes on , and franco 's policies leave spain well behind the rest of europe . 
  highly catholic and centralized , spain could n't compete . 
  however , his power was weakening and lots of foreign influence made into spain . 
  while he died and the current democracy was restored ( partially by the king in exile , juan carlos ) , it was not without consequences : the pp ( partido popular , literally popular party ) was composed by some members of the regime . 
  it 's also the current government . 
  tl ; dr : the scw is basically the current political panorama but multiplied by one thousand . 
  it 's a highly controversial topic . 
  really ? 
  most seem to not care . 
  however , mention the civil war are you deep in the mud ... 
  that chart is quite questionable . 
  barcelona : 1 very expensive , 1 very cheap , 2 average rome : 2 expensive , 2 very expensive yet the rating shows rome as `` expensive '' and barcelona as `` very expensive '' , that is , rome being cheaper than barcelona . 
  it does n't make any sense . 
  my guess is that the national police will arrest him , and the government will try to ignore everything else ( i predict lots of discourses through a monitor ) . 
  it will be up to the catalans to actually carry the elections . 
  i do n't think the police would be able to stop that . 
  just curious , what part of spain ? 
  south ? 
  oh , you are right . 
  my bad . 
  juanjo comes from juan jos\u00e9 , which in english would be `` joan jesus '' . 
  discontent ? 
  they are just trying to motivate people to do exercise and fight obesity !, 
  translation ? 
  france thinks that they are the most arrogant and the least . 
  they may have problems ... 
  the basque country is not stronger ( except per capita ) . 
  it varies , but the minimum is 225 $ month iirc . 
  there are both types of taxes , but the flat is the famous one , because it 's big ( when starting , meaningless for any company of 5 + ) , and you have to pay regardless of your income ( which means you sometimes transform profits into losses ) . 
  a lot . 
  flat taxes and huge bureaucracy . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings ) page details it a bit ( spain is # 52 on overall ease of business , but # 142 on starting . 
  for comparison , south sudan is # 140 , which is both hilarious and sad ) . 
  each country also has a [ individual page ] ( http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/spain/ ) with lots of data . 
  people do n't go to social websites because of it 's features , but the people . 
  google + was really well done and it failed . 
  tuenti is still alive because spaniards find other spaniards there ( there are probably other examples , but i ca n't think of them ) . 
   that 's a bit unfair , because there are also russians who do speak english and who 're not any more obnoxious that anyone else nobody has a problem with those , but the others simply refuse to speak any other language - even more than french . 
  it 's not a problem they do n't know the language , many simply do n't speak and play , but they really speak a lot . 
  yes . 
  it 's common to get at least one russian if you queue in europe west with only english queue . 
  obviously the russian only speaks russian . 
  did n't ukraine have obligatory military service not so long ago ? 
  it seems that getting some people with basic knowledge would be trivial . 
  agreed . 
  i really do n't like gibraltar policies ( nor luxembourg , ireland and all other countries that just sell themselves ) , but this is ridiculous . 
  though i would n't read too much into the article , it does n't look legit . 
  it mentions the telegraph , which everyone knows how it is , and even so , it 's [ quite different ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/10996085/spanish-trade-union-urges-members-to-occupy-gibraltar.html ) . 
  that said , as apology , we can give all of andaluc\u00eda . 
  enjoy it , uk . 
  well , in spain is well known too , 
  it also has happened multiple times , and not only on [ russia 's end ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran_air_flight_655 ) . 
  the whole article is over the top , and boy , does he think highly of himself and silicon valley . 
   the population at large is , statistically speaking , not very bright . 
  many are deranged from overuse of alcohol or drugs . 
  a big number are simply aging elderly rooted in ussr-centric mindset who never adjusted to the modern world . 
  most of them do not `` work '' in the sense we understand full-time employment here : they occupy placeholder positions sponsored by the government . 
  source ? 
   the families , wives , children of russian elite ( think top 1 % of that 1m strong oil & gas service clan ) does n't live in the country . 
  they actually despise russia and it 's people . 
  all of the live in the west , many in london : russian 's oligarch family spending is major contributing factor to london overall economy . 
  they have absolutely no long term interest in russian country or population survival . 
  most rich people will do whatever it takes to avoid taxes and will try to live in the best area . 
   ca n't say the rest of the country is blameless : putin got a stratospheric 71 % support level after annexation of crimea . 
  many in the us approved us iraq invasion , or if we want to go further , other obvious land grabs like spanish american war ( including the maine and a lot of propaganda as `` advanceded '' the author mentions ) . 
  the whole ukraine/russia thing is so over the top that it seems the author does n't know that things happened before the us was a thing . 
   any business you send to them only strengthen the regime . 
  your contract dollars will pay for next buk missile . 
   unlike the us , which totally does n't sells missiles to questionable regimes . 
  that 's a very pretty way of saying `` we become a tax haven '', 
  you are correct , it 's the same / u/angry _ spaniard mentions . 
  the problem is better described [ here ] ( http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/global-observer/why-the-spanish-cant-be-entrepreneurs/ ) , with highlights other problems like the employment types and patents ( which are as ugly as italy 's , no mention of greece however ) . 
  as per the article , the cost of starting is about 1000 $ . 
  spain is # 52 in the [ `` easy of doing business '' index ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ease_of_doing_business_index ) , while greece is # 72 . 
  places like denmark are # 5 . 
  [ in this other index ] ( http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/spain/#starting-a-business ) spain is # 142 , and greece # 36 , but it falls in other categories other than `` starting '' .
