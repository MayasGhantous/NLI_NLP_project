  * spain has successful sportsmen : a disproportionate amount of them are catalan . 
  * the spanish currency , the only one that spaniards have used in the whole country pre euro , has a catalan name . 
  * spain has received many immigrants recently : catalonia has received more than the average proportion . 
  catalonia is hyperspain , and therefore it wants to secede , like most spanish territories have tried during the course of history . 
  i do n't have a particular opinion on independence , but when i read that famous `` catalonia is not spain '' sign , i started to think about it and it 's right . 
  catalonia is not spain , it 's the very essence of spain , condensed , and unsuccessfully trying to spread to the rest of the country . 
  catalunya is hyperspain . 
  everything in spain exists there , augmented . 
  in a place which has seen documented warfare since 400 bc ? 
  do you want to put a curfew or will you wait till your friends take power and put it to us all ? 
  i seldom run into people like you . 
  you can consider yourself special , your mama was rght . 
  that 's a good one , ey ? 
  marriage in today 's legislation is about joining plots of property , you numbskull . 
  no law forces anyone to have children , or to adopt them . 
  marriage is not about love . 
  a doctor wo n't prevent the xenophobes and far right from depriving us from our rights . 
  daesh strikes , the xenophobic right profiteers and try to pass measures that turn our states into something that resembles daesh ever more closely every time . 
  the moment we understand that they coordinate like clockwork will be an enlightening one . 
  `` the customer can choose every colour they want , as long as it 's black '' . 
  they 're actually much more of a problem than daesh will ever be . 
  they are the agents of daesh in the west . 
  then they 'll go to turkey or jordan , and then to syria . 
  what are the grounds to forbid people to fly to syria directly ? 
  the non-provable notion that everyone flying to syria an is recruit ? 
  you lot want to forbid and punish what you do n't understand , which is what makes you the real foot soldiers of isis in european soil . 
  when you are not a war , you give every person a fair trial . 
  there is no one wearing uniforms , except for those whose shirt necks are uniformly filled with foam . 
  in a world without borders intelligence services cooperate with each other so the baddies are stopped . 
  in a world with borders , the baddies simply need to cross to the next border , get checked by a friendly/incompetent guard , and they 're off to the world . 
  for the kinds of funds the is commands it 's trivial to set up safe havens and escape routes . 
  [ spain has not taken special measures ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/11/14/inenglish/1447500317_990979.html ) , keeping the threat level in the same degree as it was before the strike . 
  however , if france suspends * fucking schengen * then we 'd be affected , yes . 
  maybe we 'd have trucks being looted again in the border stops like before . 
  so ... a blend between [ miss congeniality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miss_congeniality_\\ ( film \\ ) ) and [ miss europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miss_europe ) ? 
  apparently until they go the only united european secret service we 're going to have is [ sos croco ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/sos_croco ) . 
  france is , sadly , a much more important member of the eu than spain . 
  i would rather have it not fall for the fn-daesh axis if possible , because it 'd affect spain as well as the rest of europe . 
  besides , if the country with the most common frontiers in the european union leaves schengen , the efficacy of schengen is as good as none . 
  they ca n't `` act '' because they do n't have proof . 
  our legal systems work with the principles of innocence until being proven guilty and * in dubio pro reo * . 
  traveling to syria is not illegal per se . 
  of course , since january they 're keeping an eye on every french citizen . 
  unless you actually act as a european union and share information between france and belgium . 
  `` yo federal police/s \u00fbret\u00e9 , it 's the gendarmerie , we 're tracking one of the bombers and he 's heading to belgium , could you get a hold of him ? 
  he 's x , he looks like y and we know z about him . 
  he would likely enter through these roads . '', 
  this call was n't made , or was n't heeded , and that shows incompetence . 
  no border control will save you from incompetence . 
  [ shared intel , however , does work ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/spain-suspect-sergio-morate-arrested-romania-double-murder-chemical-burnt-bodies-1515504 ) . 
  j'ai voulu voir molenbeek , on a vu molenbeek ... 
  if the police needs a state of emergency to do its job , then it 's not doing police job . 
   in europe ? 
  meh why bother sharing fucking information ...  schengen ftw . 
  so , the fact that belgian and french intelligence services do n't share information can be attributed to a system that allows both of them to go freely through the frontiers to share information ? 
  as a matter of fact , car deaths are expected to plummet soon . 
  you are aware that this happened with the frontiers already closed due to the g20 meeting . 
  they 're right , you know . 
  that your national intelligence services and police ca n't catch the guy is not schengen 's fault . 
  schengen does n't make them incompetent . 
  [ well ... ] ( http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/05/18/national/success-abenomics-hinges-immigration-policy/#.vktnnwgjjqb ), 
  i do have the notion that a sleight of hand of the us could severely weaken the current israeli government , yes . 
  am i mad ? 
  and the real actor in the palestinian side is hamas , not the pa. 
  i do n't think we need to highlight the international ties of hamas , do we ? 
  i 'm saying that a solution wo n't come from the current governments in power , which is , incidentally , why i do n't want europe to imitate israel . 
  the juntas and hawks that have been governing israel since its beginning are not interested in peace in the first place , as is not the european right wing that tends to applaud them . 
  they also have a feedback cycle with the pa and hamas officers who are also uninterested in peace . 
  in the israel-palestina conflict it seems pretty clear that there 's a stalemate in which the governments have sequestered their populations into submission , with the situation unchanged for decades . 
  this situation is also sustained because the two governments are not answerable to their people , but to other international actors , and even to private organisations . 
  if we give in to the fn-daesh axis we 'll be similarly `` battling '' the daesh for the remainder of my life at the very least , keeping those who think like the fn forever in power . 
  you wanted a strawman to argue with and i 'm not one . 
  israel and palestina are two communities and they 're doomed to understand each other . 
  this implies the need for their encroached current leaderships to be gone , and for new negotiations to start from scratch . 
  given the puppet status of both governments , that requires higher level negotiations . 
  their current governments are not going to negotiate anything in good faith , so there needs to be two governments which do . 
  what uprising am i supporting ? 
  are you one of those `` realists '' that fervently wishes the zone 's territory to be covered in blood from an open war ? 
  shinzo abe [ has certainly been keen on making immigration easier ] ( http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/05/18/national/success-abenomics-hinges-immigration-policy/#.vktnnwgjjqb ) , for the very reason that japan is in the middle of a demographic crisis . 
  wow !, 
  so very exciting !, 
  a mind reader !, 
  so how do you think japan is going to weather the secular stagnation they 're going through ? 
  where do i want israelis to be gone from ? 
  what 's telling you that i want the israelis gone from anywhere ? 
  i just do n't feel the actions of the israeli governments are somehow worthy of imitation . 
  the british were instrumental in bringing the original zionists there after wwii . 
  the current people in power , however , are mainly enabled by the usa , and it 's this support which keeps them in power . 
  even [ their racism starts to reflect american patterns ] ( http://www.irinnews.org/report/94819/israel-the-tribulations-of-being-an-ethiopian-jew ) .

  s/he 's the one that wants security at all costs . 
  we certainly do have different experiences . 
  it was a very difficult time with my girlfriend back then , and i would n't wish her relatives on my worst enemy . 
  they did very little to hide their hostility towards me . 
  yeah , your vote will make the intelligence chief resign . 
  tell me another one . 
  you 're taking the is as a serious enemy , when it is n't . 
  the is is an organisation like every other , with funding , members and ideology . 
  the ideology is well known , and it 's spread by the ksa . 
  the members are apparently well known , if we listen to the european intelligence which tell us that they have their people in their database .
