you can try leaving your room from time to time , although i am sure someone who has the estelada as his flair might conveniently * miss * the reality in front on his own eyes . 
  i guess the whole [ `` per una escola en catala '' ] ( http://img705.imageshack.us/img705/9713/concentracio27j.jpg ) campaign was not very popular in your ` pro-independence ' region . 
  good to know . 
  weird i live in a no such ` pro-independence ' region and they put flyers and stickers in half of the schools entrances . 
  read again and/or learn to count . 
  i do n't have time to help you with that or to take a photograph of every school . 
   what do you think happens in catalan schools ? 
  kids chanting anthems and wearing nationalist flags ? 
  exactly that if you venture even 40km from barcelona so either you do n't know or you are misrepresenting the reality . 
  [ secessionist flag in the school entrance ] ( http://www.eltriangle.eu/es/notices/2013/07/las-estelades-en-las-escuelas-encienden-el-parlamento-131.php ) most schools in the little towns of girona , barcelona and lleida have giants pro-independence flags/slogans in the very front entrance . 
  but hey !, 
  i am sure that this is not adoctrination , probably the kids came up with the idea on their own / s, 
  i did n't expect much from this euro but now i want the gold . 
  for pau . 
  just because pau gasol deserves to be on top of the podium once more . 
  i count on lithuania disagreement with the idea, 
  i see your point but honestly they have been crossing countries maybe for months , it is so urgent now whey they reach their desired destination to start finding flaws ? 
  and we did not stop living in huts made of mud because we * complained * but because we * worked * to build better things . 
  you could arrive to sweden and say `` great , i am safe and i can look forward to a nice future in this country . 
  how can be of help meanwhile ? '', 
  or you can say `` the tv is not led , wi-fi is slow . 
  this town sucks . 
  this is not freedom . 
  hunger strike ! '', 
  of course , one should always keep 20,000 flats available in the center of stockholm for the * refugees * . 
  the natives can live in * the middle of nowhere * . 
  honestly if you claim to be escaping isis and the second you arrive you start complaining about facilities , food , lack of leisure options you are an entitled prick . 
  there are * thousands * like you arriving constantly and the people of the country are trying to give you a safe place to live , feed you , give you medical attention and set you up . 
  would it be so terrible to give them even a couple of weeks to sort everything out ? 
  you are not a paying customer in a hotel in case you forgot . 
  no more signs with love merkel / love germany slogans ? 
  they can also thank the 70-80 % of fake syrians that tagged along for the ride . 
  perhaps germany could have taken 500.000 syrians refugees but as soon as you start adding irakis , eritrean , kosovars , egyptian ... well the numbers do pile up . 
  i wish the best to the people fleeing from war but they would be better attended in the countries near their home , that share religions , history and language . 
  it would be far safer to move there and our financial contributions will help far more people . 
  but people in europe wanted to feel * good * about themselves taking a selfie with a refugee and a donated box of cookies so they can get likes in their instagrams . 
  such is life . 
  one thing is how this whole crisis has been mismanaged , an embarrassing fiasco that i do n't excuse . 
  my point was that they have no established right to pass freely , this is merely a stopgap measure because everybody is playing chicken except hungary . 
  first if you want to apply for refugee status in a specific country you should travel ** legally ** to that country , you are not entitled to demand every country in your way to just step aside because you have a whim . 
  second it is a travesty that media keeps insisting to call them refugees ** before ** they have actually filed a formal petition . 
  a real refugee is someone who has been granted ( or is under consideration ) this statute not any random guy without papers , a sob story and wandering eastern europe . 
  this whole affair is a shame for the eu , no coordination , tons of blame-shifting and still no hotspots in greece/italy or centralize registration . 
  current * plan * , as per merkel , is `` do not enforce any borders . 
  let anybody come in , once they are in europe we 'll spread them and 2 years later start checking their claims '' . 
  brilliant . 
   they did n't want to ask asylum here , and that they seek for it in germany its their right from 1951 un convention sorry but where exactly in the convention says so ? 
  do you imply that any person in the world can go through any border without registering or presenting papers just by saying `` i am a refugee but i will only start to prove it when i reach canada . 
  meanwhile let me pass freely . 
  it is my right ! '' ? 
  because that sounds insane , they should be applying for refugee status in the foreign country where they are . 
  and it is their ** duty ** according to the un convention you mention to follow the law & reglaments of the country they are in . 
  occupying railways , highways and rioting do seem like they are not as well informed of their presumed duties as * refugees *, 
  a shocking and unforeseen development certainly , no one could have imagined that thousands of pictures , declarations , signs and tweets about `` refugees welcome '' would cause every inmigrant to suddenly become a `` syrian asking for asylum '' . 
  but at least it 's not like they are not unmasked at the first border control they have to pass / s, 
  it did n't matter , do you honestly think for a second than the tens of thousands of pakis/bangladesh/etiophian / senegalese/afghan/iraqui / iranian/etc people waiting on the fences would have gone : `` oh , she said it is for syrians only , and refugees . 
  no need to apply '' or rather with : `` i guess we are all * syrian refugees * now '' who would have thought that people that did n't give a damn about borders , papers , visas would have the gall to lie ??? 
  when did they applied for asylum ? 
  because you can not be a refugee seeker unless you actually apply for it . 
  this a thousand times . 
  we should be in the eu reception zones and coordinating/supporting turkey . 
  processing people , checking backgrouns and doing things properly and orderly despite how anxious are the refugees to reach germany or sweden . 
  they would no longer be under a death threat so they can wait even a few months to do things right . 
  instead because of hyper-emotional eurohippies , feel-good wannabes and manipulated media we have * decided * that the solution is : * every country by itself * foment smuggling by constant propaganda of `` welcome to xxx '' * increase the number of dead inmigrants trying to reach ger/swe * install refugees in some of the most expensive countries of the world * give the middle finger to those poor/weak enough that have to stay safe in turkey , jordan , lebanon ... 
  but at least the eurohippies can feel good and trendy in their instagrams/facebooks/twitters because they `` helped '' a refugee , made a human trafficker richer , contributed to the nth capsized boat and all that for the cost of helping 45 real refugees in turkey and with 0 loss of live . 
  truly idiocy is the hegemonic ideology in europe, 
  you might be joking but they were spreading the notion that if the eu * rejects * catalonia independence they should offer a port in the mediterranean ... . to the chinese navy . 
  this on [ tv3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fg0qhrowu0 ) which is the rt news of the independence movement . 
  this is a lie . 
  not an exaggeration but a straight lie . 
  spanish government has tried for several years now ( with 0 success ) to increase the number of hours catalan pupils are taught spanish from 2 to 3 weekly . 
  this has been opposed fiercely by the ultra nationalistics forces in catalonia who claim such measure means `` the end of catalonian '' and is fascists and barbaric . 
  obviously some more '' `` extreme '' '' proposals such as spanish being used during 25 % of school hours have never gotten off the ground . 
  this is the ` oppression ' and ` horror ' catalonia suffers at the hands of the ruthless spanish government, 
  because people wo n't leave their home just because they got a letter from the court . 
  people are forced out because they consistently refuse to leave on their own . 
  this is grand , from 2000 spain has had an immigration rate 8 times greater than france and nearly 4 times greater than the usa . 
  we are now the 10th country in the world with more foreigners but angela says we are not doing enough . 
  funny she was n't so worried while africans forced us to build a fence and defend it every day . 
  and we have n't burn immigration centres, 
  i am getting tired of this `` europe is so rich that it could ... '' , a few weeks ago europe was in deep trouble because greece was on the verge on going bankrupt and that would have triggered a catastrophic euro failure with portugal , spain and italy going down the drain as well and then probably everybody . 
  most countries in europe have sky-high debts , are running deficits and are cutting again and again social programs . 
  we are told that `` austerity '' is the new normal and that there is a terrible crisis . 
  but when it comes to play good samaritan now media claims that we are loaded with money and are the richest continent and money is not a problem ... : - ? 
  well , if money is not a problem what was the discussion about with greece ??? 
  that might have been in the beginning . 
  today is mostly people sailing a few miles away from africa and radio in a distress call so they can be `` rescued '' . 
  european navies have become a taxi service for human smugglers and taxpayers are subsidizing the trip so mafias do n't have to spend money on gas . 
  it is a charade but since political correction trumps common sense it goes on and on . 
  you helped keep our gold reserves safe and then * forgot * to give it back . 
  this became a running joke since it was the cornerstone of the anti-soviet propaganda by franco 's regime . 
  [ moscow 's gold ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_gold ) '' according to orlov , joseph stalin celebrated the arrival of the gold with a banquet attended by members of the politburo , in which he was famously quoted as saying , `` the spaniards will never see their gold again , just as they do n't see their ears , '' an expression based on a russian proverb '', 
  what 's exactly the point of the article ? 
  that someone dared to mention that he was born in rural bangladesh ? 
  is n't that true ? 
  should `` the governator '' write an article every time someone says or writes that he was born in austria ?? 
  what are the new `` hyper-pc '' rules ? 
  you ca n't mention the place of origin of a person if it is not fashionable enough and might make him/her look bad ? 
  yeah , britain have a problem with `` otherness '' unlike ... paradise ? 
  the `` pity me '' crowd is getting ridiculous .
