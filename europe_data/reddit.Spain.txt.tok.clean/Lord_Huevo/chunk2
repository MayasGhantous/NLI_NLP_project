  the author considers that the country and the british should commend him for learning the language and the culture . 
  i reckon that learning the language of the country you are going to spend your life in it 's actually beneficial for you and if that language happens to be the preeminent for commerce and science even better . 
  being able to navigate the local culture probably helps a bit to enter balliol college , oxford , and cambridge so again . 
  who 's benefitting here ? 
  if the author drove a cab mumbling broken english the country and the british would n't notice but ** his ** life would be immensely different ... for the worse . 
  so why exactly did he expect a pat on his back ? 
  but perhaps he could use his daunting experience that has merited a nyt article to alert the poor souls at calais that are defying every law and risking their lives to enter for whatever means that country that has a problem with * otherness * . 
  this message may help save millions of lives from people that are spending everything they have to leave their countries in asia or africa to get to europe without being aware of this `` otherness '' problem we have . 
  who knows perhaps in a few decades we can march by the millions to bangladesh and complaint when someone refers to us as `` the europeans '' ? 
  so is this going to be prosecuted like a hate crime ? 
  a concerted attack towards persons of a specific race and sex from people who see them as inferiors . 
  since the basic tenet of the left is that european countries are racists that would mean the newcomers have been succesfully integrated . 
  the attention whorism is strong on this one . 
  the process shall continue forever . 
  i concur , like we have something to fear !, 
  i mean is not like there have been any minor violent incident linked to these enclaves , no reason to justify any kind of alarm but just in case to prevent any possible problem the solution is more ~ ~ integration ~ ~ subsidies . 
  the root problem with the article is that the writer starts denying what we ** know ** to be a true premise : * assuming multiculturalism is double-plus-good * which is a scientifc truth like : * assuming the earth is the center of the universe * * assuming the earth is flat * * assuming the earth is 4,000 years old * all widely and firmly held beliefs that needed no proof because every * sane and reasonable * person concurred . 
  no need for any damn direct personal experience that points otherwise !, 
  tolerate harder my friend !!, 
  lituania . 
  then it would be the same in english and spanish . 
  aim for consistency, 
  imagine the selfies, 
  you are being pessimist here , there is a political and academic consensus widely disseminated by the media of the multiple benefits of mass immigration and how little burden do they pose on social services . 
  you wo n't be insinuating is all a big lie , will you ? 
  ps : congrats for the qualification, 
  this is not a cost but an investment . 
  refugees alleviate the shortages in norway 's workforce both in manual and skilled jobs which will contribute to paying retirement to old norwegians . 
  they also rejuvenate the population and guarantee a healthy raise of birthrates plus of course bringing a lot of diversity and colour to boring norway . 
  obviously you are not going to get all these advantages for free, 
  courts of justice are so spanish ... / s, 
  and the aliens . 
  never forget the aliens, 
  right to vote ? 
  there have been a number of referendums celebrated in catalonia which are conveniently forgotten by independentists because they do n't suit their narrative and are invalid for < list of made-up reasons  let 's see how catalans voted . 
  ** december 6th 1978 ** . 
  referendum to approve the project for a spanish constitution in favour ? 
  90 % with 68 % of participation . 
  the constitution includes the following articles :  1.2 2 . 
  national sovereignty belongs to the spanish people from whom emanate the powers of the state  2 . 
   the constitution is based on the indissoluble unity of the spanish nation , the common and indivisible homeland of all spaniard [ ... ]  8.1  the armed forces , constituting the land army , the navy and the air force , have as their mission the guarantee  of the sovereignty and independence of spain , the defence of its territorial integrity and the constitutional order . 
  this incontestable result is no longer valid because it greatly incovenients the path to secession . 
  ** october 25th 1979 ** . 
  referendum for catalonia statute of autonomy in favour ? 
  88 % with 60 % of participation . 
  the statute reads :  1.1 catalonia , as a nationality and in order to achieve self government , is constituted as an autonomous community , in accordance with the constitution and with this statute , which provides its basic institutional rules . 
   1.3 the powers of the government of catalonia emanate from the constitution , from this statute and from the people . 
  we have learned , thanks to the brillian political scientists minds of the independence movement , that people in the 1980s had it all wrong - you wo n't be surprised if you remember the hairstyles , ugh !, 
  - power does not emanate from the constitution or the statute but from who can assemble the biggest mob . 
  that 's how democracy works . 
  my teacher told me so . 
  ** february 20th 2005 ** . 
  referendum to approve the treaty establishing a constitution for europe in favour ? 
  64 % with 41 % of participation the treaty included the following articles :  i-3  3 . 
   it shall promote economic , social and territorial cohesion , and solidarity among member states . 
  the union shall respect the equality of member states before the constitution as well as their national identities , inherent in  their fundamental structures , political and constitutional , inclusive of regional and local self-government . 
  it shall  respect  their essential state functions , including ensuring the ** territorial integrity of the state ** , maintaining law and  order and safeguarding national security . 
  incidentally the will of the catalan people was not respected by france and netherland were the no won and the proposed european constitution was abandoned for a long series of negotiations & changes culminating in the treaty of lisbon . 
  there are no accounts of demonstrations ( massive or not ) for respect of the will of the catalan voters and for the dignity of catalonia . 
  that would have to wait for the `` nou estatut '' ** june 18th 2006 . 
  ** referendum for new statute of autonomy for catalonia ( or catalans ca n't vote release iv ) in favour ? 
  74 % with 50 % of participation . 
  the statute read :  1 . 
  catalonia , as a nationality , exercises its self-government constituted as an autonomous community in accordance with the  constitution and with this estatut , which is its basic institutional law . 
   3.2 catalonia has its political and geographical space of reference in the spanish state and the european union , and it incorporates the values , principles and ** obligations ** implied by being a part thereof . 
  some articles of this statute were struck down as unconstitutional and that turned on a massive power play from ciu . 
  appealing to the dignity of the catalan people whose will had been harmed ty the constitutional court they engineered the `` mother of all protests '' . 
  it helped that nationalists were already fuming due to the fantastic world cup spain was having ;-) ( they scheduled it the day before the final ) and the ruling was just the straw that broke the camel 's back . 
  obvioulsy only a failing democracy and residually fascist state could allow a decision voted by the people of a state to be overtuned by a - also fascist - court ruling . 
  [ hello proposition 8 ! ], 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/california_proposition_8_%282008%29 ) ** september 27th 2015 . 
  ** referendum for catalonian independence ? 
  ( aka pumped-up state elections ) in favour ? 
  47 % with 77 % of participation this has been hailed as a massive success for pro-independence parties and a `` clear mandate '' to proceed with unilateral independence . 
  the leader of cup - leftist sidekick of junts x si - declared immediately that starting the very next day spanish law should be disobeyed so we can expect an imminent declaration of independence or ... more posturing for the masses . 
  i skip the part where catalans voted in general elections , european elections and state elections to avoid further embarrassing of those who make their living of proclaiming how catalans are not allowed to vote or to decide their ties with spain . 
  tl ; dr : in 40 years catalans have voted on texts that defined their relationship with spain at least 5 times . 
  independentists have lost every one of them , yet they presume to speak for catalonia and demand unlimited chances to break up hated spain . 
  also salty . 
  the constitution of spain was approved in catalonia with more than 90 % of the vote . 
  but i guess this is conveniently forgotten in the jxsi / cup meetings ;-), 
  i am not sure what to think on one hand it seems like a call for trouble , on the other hand i really want a new car but do n't have money to pay for it . 
  decisions , decisions ... 
  more [ like this ] ( http://www.islam-watch.org/images/stories/europe-islamic-paradise.jpg ) * divide et impera *, 
  ok , i am sure the injured people and their relatives along with the dead 's relatives will get plenty of consolation that it was not a `` terroristic attack '' . 
  * he chopped my hand off but it was not linked to terrorism , he just does not know how to handle rejection * no need to worry then . 
  so what does that tell you about how good were the alternatives ? 
  the voters chose the thieves ( pp/cdc ) as the lesser evil , maybe they are all dumb and only up/erc voters are smart and educated or maybe pablo screw the chance to oust pp from government when he could not even abstain in pedro sanchez bid for presidency . 
  he gave a big `` f. . . 
  you ! '', 
  to an alternative government because apparently ousting pp was not that important to him . 
  the voters took note . 
  apparently most spaniards had other opinion and they thought that electing a party that had the same economic program that syriza has obviously failed to implement would make us the `` laughingstock '' of europe . 
  england confirmed now as one of the most powerful sides in united kingdom football . 
  good luck with that . 
  europe is going childless , mea nations have batshit crazy demographics and there is no will to respect or enforce borders from either side . 
  denmark , along with western europe , will be a muslim-majority neighborhood in this century . 
  i take he means that with constant terror attacks happening in turkey tourist may choose to visit a safer country such as spain . 
  in fact the article states that once egypt and turkey get `` back to normal '' we would lose for sure a few millions of these tourists . 
  oh , i have n't seen any news about that .
