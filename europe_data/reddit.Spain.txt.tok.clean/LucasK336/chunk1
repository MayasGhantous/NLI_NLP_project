does someone know where to see what those very same places look today ? 
  i guess much of those buildings were rebuilt ( like in warsaw ) and many others were just replaced . 
  it would be nice to see the before/after, 
   booo japan , their unemployement rate is n't falling . 
  yeah it 's like they are not even trying, 
  that 's weird . 
  i 'm from argentina and i 've been living in spain for almost 7 years now . 
  i still have a very strong argentinian spanish accent because i go back to argentina every ( northern emisphere ) summer , but i can garantee and i 've never , ever , ever , felt `` discriminated '' for my accent and/or nationality , neither during social occasions , when talking to public workers or classmates . 
  there is a little program for android called [ iss detector ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.runar.issdetector&amp;hl=en ) which tells you , according to your location , when the iss will be visible , and what part of the sky you must see . 
  it also shows you when an [ iridum flare ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/satellite_flare ) will be visible , which are pretty cool too . 
  i 've tested it many times and it 's very accurate , down to the second . 
  there is also other program called [ sattrack ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.heavensabove&amp;hl=en ) which does the same but it also shows you other satellites and space debris , but those are much harder to see . 
  if prices going down , why would anyone buy something if it will be cheaper one month later ? . 
  now imagine this at a larger scale . 
  pretty much people and companies stop buying stuff waiting for it to get cheaper ( or just buy less ) , reducing other 's people and companies benefits , they are forced to lower even more the prices , etc etc vicious circle . 
  at last that 's how i understand it , i 'm not an economist so take it with a grain of salt . 
  i 'm going to post this [ this one ] ( https://i.imgur.com/vuixwms.png ) again , also found on / int /, 
  \u02b0\u1d49\u1dab\u1d56, 
  : ddddd1, 
  that 's why we say spain is a donut, 
  and probably more struts too, 
  [ over 300m !, 
  i wish i could upvote you more . 
  i mean , obviously we are not the best of the best but we have people who really think we are worse than africa ... . 
  germoney pay denbts, 
  haha , i park there too ( but inside the building 's garage ) , we have even probably seen ourselves at some point, 
  las palmas de gran canaria , taken a while ago . 
  there was some kind of sailboat race at that moment . 
  indeed . 
  [ here ] ( https://i.imgur.com/wlovcao.jpg ) is my favourite pic of london . 
  til at last 1/4 of europe 's internet users visit r/europe, 
  we are not the worst at employment anymore wohooo !, 
  ! 1 good tyems ahead very good for economy, 
  yes , but as i understand , it could still happen . 
  like [ that accident in usa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1961_goldsboro_b-52_crash ) where a b52 crashed with two nuclear bombs inside , and in one of the bombs , all the security mechanisms , except one , failed ( and thanks to that single mechanism the thing did n't explode ) . 
  also , a b52 loaded with nuclear bombs [ crashed here in spain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1966_palomares_b-52_crash ) too some decades ago . 
  [ ] ( / dumbfabric `` hi ! '' ), 
  edit : two bombs , not four . 
  reminds me of [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vuixwms.png ), 
  for me it looks like the first one two floors of that section were destroyed and the building collapsed partially . 
  it 's strange but a building can start collapsing and after some floors stop and still standing . 
  [ it can even happen during controlled demolitions ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osbzau47asq ) . 
  i 'm sure they had to demolish the entire section and rebuild it again . 
  buy netherlands and sell them as frances . 
  perfect business . 
  austerity works !, 
  ^ help, 
  [ bloody hell !, 
  never read the comments section of any news website, 
  top banter . 
  going to italy for one year next course , 
  italy . 
  we are comming after you . 
  another perspective . 
  it 's a fuckton of money . 
  i would n't call those apartment buildings brutalist , those are just designed to be as cheap as possible ( probably built during the 50s-70s ) . 
  yeah , and they look terrible , even more with that paint work . 
  [ we our share of them here in gran canaria too ] ( https://i.imgur.com/0lmuncz.jpg ) , but at last these ones are painted so they blend with the landscape a little better . 
  so we finally central ? 
  we need to get some dogs . 
  [ ] ( / ajlol ) well duh , germany is ** the ** one stealing err jobs and youth , drowning us in yet more denbts while forcing us into austerity , threatening us of kicking us out of the eu and all of that while merkel laughs furiously screaming * southerneuropexit !!!, 
  * before going to bed every night . 
  confirmed , iberia is a donut . 
  yes , this is awesome and i wish we had this here . 
  i get these trough mail a few times per year ( swiss citizenship ) but i do n't usually answer because ... well , i do n't speak german ... yet ... edit : year , not month, 
   seasons are created by the sun being closer to the earth during summer than during winter . 
  imo that 's because of [ this kind graphic ] ( https://i.imgur.com/xvrykog.jpg ) you can find at every book explaining how seasons happen , mostly , you know , books for schools . 
  a lot of people is then stuck for life with the idea earth 's obrit looks like and that seasons happen because of distance , very few understand the drawing is supposed to be in perspective and the distance difference is negligible . 
  i 've had a few friends and relatives who thought this . 
  wait ... ... ... * it does n't ?? 
  looks like the canary islands will be the first place in europe from where the eclipse will be seen wooo !, 
  to be fair , they called france `` developing '' too . 
  also , [ this one ] ( https://i.imgur.com/gk0liok.jpg ), 
  its fun because portugal is the most western country in europe . 
  i like this one a lot more, 
  i remember as a kid i would see childrens going to bed at 20 in tv cartoon shows and thinking `` what the hell ? '', 
  nice !, 
  the god damn autocorrect, 
  and for muy next magic trick ... 
  bravo estonia !, 
  yuo get to be part of a country with a higher gdp and gdp per capita , and we get to be part of a country with a lower unemployment . 
  it 's a win-win !, 
  i do n't know if we are talking about the same thing , but as far as i know spain has had a `` bad bank '' for a while . 
  i remember how mad my friend was when he got me to play cs on-line with him on a cyber-cafe and i killed him with the knife . 
  i live in the gran canaria and here is now at around 0.79 $ / l. 
  it 's not like you can go very far away being an island , but it 's nice . 
  while breaking the space-time continuum, 
  the low proportion of spanish users ( compared to other european countries ) in almost all the english-speaking websites i use always surprised me . 
  but then , it 's also true that there is a huge spansh-speaking side of the internet , so maybe that 's it ... 
  excelent video , reminds me of the documentaries about bridges or skyscrapers construction that they used to air in discovery channel many years ago . 
  i did n't know my name was so popular, 
  do you want memes ? 
  because this is how you get them . 
  maybe we can even become a meme country like finland . 
  hahah ... like ... 
  * what ? 
  not too much for halloween , but i 've seen some during christmas . 
  traditionally the three kings are the ones who bring the gifts for the children at janaury 6 . 
  but santa claus have been imposing himself to the point where there is people who argue about how you should `` kick the fat in red '' out of your house and stuff like that . 
  nah , it 's also common here and people talk about how are they going to dress and stuff .
