  canary islands . 
  yeah , it 's said spain will break the 70 millon tourists mark this year for first time . 
  the best worst 14 hours of my life . 
  my father came from argentina a few weeks ago and needed to exchage some pesos to $ . 
  right in the plaza del sol we asked in two exhange shops . 
  one of them offered him 400 $ . 
  we went to another one 50 meters away and there we were offered 360 $ . 
  my father said `` no thanks '' and immediatly the guy said `` ok ok i give you 400 $ ! '' . 
  we went away to the first one . 
  i guess there is a difference between `` fightin for my country against an external invasor '' and `` fighting for my country 's interests on the other side of the world '' and stuff like that . . 
  to be fair every time norway is included in one of these graphics you guys always appear on top of whatever good thing it 's being measured , or at the bottom of the bad things . 
  i think norway is usually left out in order not to damage other country 's self esteem so much , 
  shitty economy * shittier governments ^ 2 = this, 
  true , that 's why we have our own iva , called igic , of only 7 % max instead of 21 % . 
  still every factory i 've seen here works almost exclusively for local consumption . 
  beautiful ships and beautiful bridge . 
  thanks for sharing, 
  just woke up , what 's going on here ? 
  also going to take a nap brb . 
  i think it 's good enough . 
  i 've seen [ far far worse ] ( https://i.imgur.com/c9noc43.jpg ), 
  canary islands . 
  our house does n't have ( or need ) heating or cooling . 
  [ yes they did ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tatlin%27s_tower ), 
  i love the mercury tower . 
  it reminds me of the construction of the pillars in the [ rio -- antirrio bridge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rio%e2%80%93antirrio_bridge ) in greece . 
  they first built the lower part of hollow pillars on a dry lock , then [ they moved them ] ( http://www.roadtraffic-technology.com/projects/rion-antirion/images/m1pier.jpg ) with tugs to the desired position and flooded them so they would sink ( i think , watched that documental years ago ) . 
  then once the structure was into place they built the rest of the structure while removing the water . 
  of course , here we are talking about a fixed and much lower structure . 
  i do n't know what is happening with the new bridges drawings , the perspective is slightly wrong in all of them . 
  and in this one the closer arch looks also wrong . 
  she can inside spain , but because she has an eternal temporary contract she ca n't get the blue card which would grant her free healthcare in any other country of the eu . 
  i doubt it , if that was the case the numbers would be waaaay higher , tens of millons for pretty much every western europe country . 
  for example , aroud three millon italians moved to argentina during the xix and xx centuries and now their decendents make up between 20 and 30 millon people in argentina only . 
  not all of them , but many still preserve the italian citizenship or are eligible for it . 
  now add to the mix countries like the us , australia , canada , etc. 
  and the numbers would easily reach a few tens of millons . 
  same goes for the uk , france , spain , etc. 
  yes , that 's very shitty . 
  as an erasmus student i could do it because it was a special case , but my mother is a doctor in the public health system and has a temporary contract . 
  she has been getting called to renew it again every two or three months ( for the last ... 6 years ) , but she ca n't get the card ... 
  best ship, 
  the fourth now , 
  [ it finally happened :( ] ( https://i.imgur.com/oicvjya.jpg ), 
  i can relate to most of these . 
  i tried looking for it but i could n't find it again . 
  forgot to download it and i should have probably rehosted it to imgur . 
  i hated it but started to like it after living in the city for a few months . 
  right below the screen there is a sign which says that . 
  yeah , but not in a 5 hours time frame . 
  also in this gif you do n't see only the flights connecting madrid and milan , you see all the planes taking off from milan only , during those 5 hours . 
  you can see a few going somewhere else and a few others landing in barcelona . 
  yes , i did n't make it , i was just pointing out the website . 
  if i 'm not mistaken the filter was for all flights taking off from milan malpensa . 
  not sure during how much time , but taking into account that a flight from milan to madrid takes a bit more than two hours , i would say the gif lasts for around 5 hours . 
  i forgot to say , i 'm sure a lot of people already know this website , but for those who do n't , the gif was extracted from https://www.flightradar24.com/ , which lets you track almost every flight in the world in real time . 
  edit : also to clarify , the gif was n't made by me, 
  pls no, 
  i live in the canary islands and see this a lot . 
  go to maspalomas in gran canaria , or puerto del carmen in lanzarote , and a lot of times you wo n't even see signs in spanish . 
  stop stealing quotes from abraham lincoln . 
  i was already expecting some doritos and mountain dew logos to appear all over the screen with some airhorn sound effects . 
  * edit : a word, 
  i moved here almost 10 years ago . 
  personally have n't seen those again since but hey , maybe it 's just me . 
  haha , our apartment back in argentina had these , i loved to play with them when i was a kid . 
  according to some un forecast our hdi is supposed to be the 4\u00ba best one in the world by 2030 ... 
  i mean , ok , bring it on , i seriously would n't mind . . 
  finalnd , norway and sweden always get mad when they are not included in the cool data maps about europe , but no one ever remember the canary islands on the other side :(, 
  being fair i never saw anyone do it . 
  if we ( or at last i ) want something red with our pasta , tomato souce with a bit of basil and grated cheese will do the trick , but not * ketchup * . 
  `` 5pa1n lol '' not a football fan but even for me it was a bit embarrasing, 
  what the fuck d :, 
  we will make a wall around ceuta and melilla , and make morocco pay for it !, 
  i love the flags moving with the beat of the song 10/10, 
  same in spain . 
  we used to have `` negative growth '' and it was also a good thing . 
  i got out of high school with an average english level for my age . 
  my english probably would have gone to shit if it was n't for the wonders of the english speaking side of the internet i discovered later , which helped me to keep improving . 
  right now i 'm pretty proud of having a not yet perfect but much higher level of english than most of my teamm8s on college . . 
  was n't the project reduced ? 
  i was just reading this today http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/2743148/0/operacion-chamartin-madrid-puerta-norte/ but i do n't know if it 's official already . 
  i 'm not from madrid but to be fair i would have loved to see a few new skyscrapers next to the cuatro torres . 
  but looks like the maximum height for these was reduced from 250-300m to 160m ( 40 storeys ) . 
  shame . 
  i 'm ok with this, 
  moscow wins , hands down . 
  pls build more skyscrapers . 
  custom fees here are such bs some times . 
  buy something from amazon for 50 $ , pay ~ 30 $ in fees . 
  had fun helping with the creation and defending the eu flag and other euro flags . 
  except for that one time when i added a single pixel in the g of united kingdom so it would read `` united kinodom '' . 
  sorry , i could n't resist :( , then i also helped defending the uk flag a bit . 
  yeah it was fun to see . 
  there was also a similar battle going on in the two small hearts with the spanish flag . 
  well , that 's good . 
  we pretty much could n't even start making a flag anywhere lol . 
  one year in milano . 
  one of the best experiences i have ever had , 
  at last we made it into the list .
