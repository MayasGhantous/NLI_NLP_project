** reality ** : an incredibly small percentage of the pension budget might ( this not confirmed whatsoever ) have been paid to people that were already deceased at the moment of payment , arguably because of administrative errors . 
  ** immediate reaction ** :  * spain is literally the worst place in the universe , everything is corrupt and it 's the all the politicians 's fault , other countries not only have absolutely bug-free software running their bureaucracy but also perfect humans inputing the data , the catholic church must be behind this and i bet your great-grandparents killed my great-grandparents since you 're clearly a fascist . 
  * ^ the average spaniard in a nutshell . 
  but having perspective and applying reasoning skills is hard , shouting and blindly assigning blame is easy . 
  duh ... ban the internet , obviously . 
  that 's also a way to not have to even try compete with american it , so two birds with one stone . 
  that the mods do n't like its contents and/or what is being said in the comments . 
  what you said is even worse , since it also implies banning 3d printing . 
  i know several people that were unemployed for years or jumping between temporary contracts that have started working more long term again , and a self-employed family member talked about how he 's getting more and more work each day . 
  also i just got a non collectively bargained raise after less than two years in my current position ( i work in it ) . 
  it 's getting better but there 's still a fuckton of unemployment , specially for young people . 
   alvia is a high-speed train . 
  then :  was the train a high-speed capable train ? 
  yes . 
  you 're moving goalposts . 
  alvias are not high speed trains and they 're not manufactured nor operated as such , they 're hybrids . 
  in fact , a high speed train might not have derrailed in that exact same situation because they 're much lighter . 
   that 's all the debate sorted out . 
  bitch please, 
   alvia is a high-speed train . 
  debatable , depends entirely on what you want to call `` high-speed '' , officially alvias are not in the same category as aves even if they 're marketered as `` alta velocidad '' . 
   and the lack of promised measures , like ertms . 
  it was absolutely never promised , ertms was not planned for lines under 300km/h . 
   tfw you get to show up in the office pretty much however the fuck you want ** and ** get paid handsomely for it . 
  computer nerds master race . 
  yeah europe , that continent know for the abscence of war and tyranny throught its history . 
  kek, 
  because stupid laws . 
  the eramus is strong with this one . 
   btw , i 'm myself working on open source projects , for free not everyone wants to work for free , open source ! = free . 
  i enjoy eating , sleeping under a roof and going on vacation every year . 
   in that case no company will ever invest in any new software or the like , given that they would be guaranteed to receive no return on their investment since the consumers are allowed to freely share and pirate their property . 
  intellectual entreprise did n't start with patents and copyright , those were created as a tool to try to further improve human development by incentivizing those businesses to ** make more things openly available ** , not less . 
  what is now trying to be sold as intellectual `` property '' completely changes the intent of those concepts , when created they were a tool to incentivize the common good , now `` ip '' it 's a tool to feed greed . 
   by the way : i assume your disdain of ip extends to books and the like ? 
  i do not acknowledge intellectual `` property '' , period , it 's an absurd concept . 
  i have nothing against the government giving a ** temporary ** ( keyword here , ip right now is de facto eternal ) monopoly over some certain piece of literature so he can profit from his work while he works on more stuff and thus ... you know , being incentivized to keep making more books before it runs out , which was the whole point of copyright . 
  if exploiting that monopoly during let 's say 10 or 15 years is not enough to make him a living during that time then he should indeed be at the checkout line of my local grocer . 
   seriously ... 
  the notions kids have these days ... bitch please , i write software for a living and so did my father for probably longer than you have been alive . 
   we can and we do regulate speech and it 's the one single thing that i despise most from the so called `` liberal '' europe . 
   but it 's definitely not thought control it is , what you punish is particular illegal thougths , no matter how much you twist it . 
  today you decide to call it `` hate '' ( as defined by some politician ) while back then it was called `` blasphemy '' ( as defined by some religious leader ) but it remains the exact same excuse to do the exact same thing : persecute people based their thoughts instead of their actions . 
  hate is nothing more than an idea , hating anything is and needs to be completely legal not only from a moral perspective but from a practical one as well , thoughtcrime would n't be enforceable in any remotely fair manner . 
   no digital good should have any ip protections ? 
  there 's an extremely huge logical jump between the concept of `` intellectual property '' ( `` i * own * this idea '' ) and the original government-granted idea monopolies ( `` this idea is public , but for a few years no one else is allowed to profit from it '' ) a.k.a patents and copyright , which were also short enough to actually foster creation instead of hindering it . 
  intellectual `` property '' is a completely illogical concept . 
  someone missed statistics at high school . 
  ip is how the internet works , whether you or the eu luddites like it or not . 
   for a gamer if you 're a gamer apple is simply not making computers for you , they could n't care less about that . 
  do you also fling shit at hp or dell because their servers racks are overpriced compared to your home-assembled pc ? 
   their products are not proportional to the hardware they offer . 
  except they are , if you want to buy a laptop with decent materials instead of the shittiest plastic known to man you 'll have to spend +1000 $ , just like the macbooks . 
  same with the iphones , if you want the good stuff you 'll be spending +600 $ even if you go with samsung or whatever . 
  you also have to pay for ** the software ** , apple is not google , they make 90 % of their money from selling you a product , not by reading your emails or chasing you around the internet ( and outside of it if you use android ) . 
   july 2016  android 5.1 lollipop how about no . 
  the eu still not undestanding anything about the internet ? 
  color me suprised lol . 
  or maybe they 're not stupid enough to pretend that the internet is not a completely public space . 
  you would n't expect privacy in the middle of a park on a saturday evening ... why would you expect it on the internet ? 
  that 's the point . 
  a manifestation from the `` black lives matter '' terrorists turning violent ? 
  oh my , how surprising , there 's no way someone could see that coming . 
  us glorious oceanic climate northerners will be fine from october to may . 
  this particular summer i 'm still poland-ready well into july thanks to overwatch . 
   * the left once again throwing homosexuals to the wolves because we 're not useful anymore * why am i not surprised ? 
  glad to see u/executivemonkey is bringing friends . 
  anyone , depending on the situation . 
  yes !, 
  keep the cubans coming . 
  i 've literally never met anyone that likes baseball irl . 
  how democratic of them . 
  more like spanish digg , it 's has been around for more than 10 years . 
  you 're trying too hard . 
  he learned it in [ men\u00e9ame ] ( https://www.meneame.net/ ) bruh , it 's where all the spanish * intellectuals * gather . 
  the torture was super democratic though . 
  ahh yes , `` equality '' . 
   sch\u00e4uble is worried about the condition of the american democracy . 
  - again , reported speech . 
  how rich , lol . 
  call me when the us starts openly persecuting and imprisoning people for thinking * wrong * . 
  i had to do both for the pau as well . 
  but it was right before the 14 points nonsense , so it might be different now . 
  both are mandatory in galicia ( even for the technical bachilleratos ) . 
   i have to repeat this more often than i like to , but we do not live in utilitarian societies . 
  sounds like a good time to start fixing that . 
  at some point , using the existance of a single christian terrorist to * justify * hundreds of muslim ones becomes pants-on-head retarded . 
  and we 're way past that point . 
  [ europe_fixing_the_underlying_problems . jpg ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mkewd3k.jpg ), 
  duh , what did you expect ? 
  that 's obviously ok because * it 's germany * . 
  the other coup begins . 
  actually ... 
  staying at home playing overwatch with the news in the background is probably the best thing you can do right now . 
  * i want to get off ms. europa 's wild ride !, 
  right after you explain why god does or does not exist . 
  `` art '', 
  hate speech is free speech . 
  how dare they commit such blatant thoughtcrime . 
  clearly that 's not the line of thought that the german state has approved .
