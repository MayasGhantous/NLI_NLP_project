   what the fuck is going on ?!, 
  i 'm already happy developing software and i do n't have anywhere near the charisma neccesary to achieve stuff in politics , so that 's probably not going to happen . 
  i 'll be onboard with any such project though . 
  yes , as soon as physically possible . 
  i used to have some hope for it , in theory it is a very beautiful and inspiring project , in practice the downfall of the 2008 crysis shows that it has way too many structural problems to go absolutely nowhere in the future . 
  they can also be much easily prevented by not stepping into the biggest economic blunder in the history of mankind . 
  but sadly , the spanish democracy is still too young to know better , our parents just wanted to be with the cool kids and with the inferiority complex of those 40 years of oppression i genuinely ca n't blame them . 
  at this point all i can do is hope for brexit to spark either massive reforms or a progressive dismantlement of the eu . 
  i like how some people is awakening to the fact that the eu is even more corrupt than our government , fun stuff . 
  please eucrats , keep those selective fines coming , and make them as loud and shameless as possible , ca n't wait to finally have a mainstream eurosceptic party to vote for . 
  is not going to get better if we pay either , that 's pants-on-head retarded . 
  whatever party decides not to pay will get my vote , that 's for sure , even podemos ( coming from a liberal guy ) . 
  i like how you pretend that we should be happy about artificially low interest rates when they are biggest reason why our economy got beyond fucked leading to 2008 , go tell our lost generation about the wonders of dat cheap credit . 
  the housing bubble must have happened because all of sudden people ** really ** wanted to have more houses , the massive disaster called euro had nothing to do with it , god bless the eu for bringing cheap credit to the poor pigs . 
  brutal . 
   if netflix wants its customers to have low-latency high bandwidth connection to its servers , then it should pay for it . 
  they 're already paying for it , both nextflix and the customers . 
  `` pay me again or i 'll deliberately slow you down '' is pure extortion , by definition . 
  if you `` dunno '' then you should probably stop pretending to know how networks work . 
   i can roam in the eu for free with cellular plans from the us yet europeans do not have that option due to lobbying . 
  what ? 
  [ i 'm pretty sure we do . 
  bandwidth is irrelevant to what we 're talking about . 
  you can have a 1mb/s fiber connection with vastly better routing than a 10gbit/s one . 
  not really , the one playing videogames is having a bad experience because they 're extremely latency sensitive while the one torrenting would not be affected in the slightless even if the latency were 20 times higher . 
  i felt way more safe in warsaw than i did in places like london or paris . 
  i obviously agree that from a purely technical perspective discriminating traffic is the objectively superior approach , anyone arguing otherwise is either ignorant of how networks work or doing it in bad faith . 
  but that 's not the real debate , just like net neutrality is not optimal from a technical perspective leaving isp to do whatever they want with the packets begs for massive abuse and all the possible kinds of anti-competitive behaviour that exist ( and some new ones on top ) . 
  pretty much the same thing . 
  someone who is sexually atracted to lumber . 
  send all the homogay to spain , i 've yet to see an ugly pole irl . 
  but you 're wrong , it objectively did . 
   i watched it a long time ago , but cgp grey is not an economist . 
  i would direct you to this paper , it covers this topic in a lot of detail using empirical evidence . 
  and the author of that paper is not a computer scientist . 
  in fact , you just need to read the first paragraph to realize how clueless he about the current trends and the massive breakthroughts that different kinds of machine learning are making , despite what he seems to think , there 's way more to the present and future of computing than the fairly simple convolutional network that google uses to find cats in his pictures ( that 's 20yo stuff made cheap by current day hardware ) . 
   the spanish economy , did not really get any better since the last time he said that . 
  except it very much did . 
   matadors are n't publicly funded except they are , because supposedly this is `` culture '' . 
  if those soldiers and police officers die gutted when torturing a drugged animal for absolutely no reason then yes . 
  i 'll laugh at that too . 
   you have more in common with russia than you do with the eu you should give a trigger warning before dropping those truthbombs . 
   we dont want lgbt here , and this our right . 
  that 's not how reality works . 
  indeed , gay sex is objectively the manliest form of intercourse . 
  you ca n't resist , we are the homoimperium , you will be assimilated . 
  no , they were busy winning the war on the actual front and losing more than 20 million lives in the process . 
  but hey , you did make more movies about it , so there 's that . 
   maybe we should have left you fuckers to hitler no `` anglosaxon '' country has done absolutely anything for spain in the last centuries , you ** did ** leave us to hitler 's stupid cousing and pretended that we did n't exist for 40 years . 
  and about hitler , you better go thank the former ussr , they 're the ones that saved the world from him . 
  learn some history maybe . 
   * we did n't invent corruption ? 
  spain is not the most corrupt country on earth ? 
  * the average spaniard in a nutshell . 
  that 's cute . 
  stop raping women then . 
  i too am brown during july and august , but i identify as an apache attack helicopter . 
  it 's should be fine as long as you 're not a disgusting male . 
   the br\u00c5 has not released detailed data on rape committed by immigrants since 1996 lol, 
  source ? 
   what should happen instead is swift apprehension and trial of anyone who attacks a woman til sweden does not have laws that forbid attaking people . 
  scary place . 
  you 're definitely not the only one . 
  they 're both straight . 
  i 'll vote for whoever decides not to pay on the next elections . 
  pablo , here is your chance :3, 
  more like he says `` yes '' , you fuck , than he says `` no '' .

  the banter is getting too intense for me . 
   typical irishman , loves to complain . 
  spaniards do exactly the same , absolutely everything is bad , always . 
  and if you disagree you 're clearly a fascist pp voter whose grandad killed my grandad . 
   mysql eww ... postgresql should be there imo . 
  i 'm getting raises , and so is pretty much everyone in the office . 
   starting salary for an engineer is around a 1000 euros . 
  lol no that 's where i started as a code monkey technician ( [ fpii ] ( http://todofp.es/todofp/que-como-y-donde-estudiar/que-estudiar/familias/informatica-comunicaciones/desarrollo-aplicaciones-multiplataforma.html ) ) . 
  how cute :3, 
   you can configure vim to do the same things an ide can do yeah sure , and programming by poking a magnetized needle on the hard drive is an option as well , but that also completely misses the point of what an ** integrated ** development enviroment is . 
  vim does not understand the logic beneath the code , vim does not compile on the fly , vim does not provide hundreds of refactoring patterns out of the box , or tools for in-depth debbuging , or profiling , or building , or completely integrated version control , or ... 
  i 'm sure you could hypothetically have `` vim '' do all those things with 2836423462378462 plug-ins , but at that point you 'd effectively be using a poor man 's ide , not vim . 
   the only handy thing an ide gives is syntax highlighting and automatic indentation , and that 's easy to setup in vim . 
  sounds like you have absolutely no idea of the things vs or intellij idea can do . 
  if you 're going to ignore 99,9 % of their features and just use it like a text editor then sure , there little point in using them over vim or sublime , you might as well save ram and money . 
  brutal, 
   the goal of lighting up the buildings is n't to ward off terrorists with bright colors . 
  it 's to show support . 
  wow , so useful !, 
  how many watts of `` support '' do we need to bring those people back from the dead ? 
  i 'm pretty sure istambul has way more `` white people '' ( whatever that shit means ) than orlando . 
  the kek never ends . 
   and is still soooooo much slower than apt-get * sudo apt-get install visual-studio * ... nope , it did n't work . 
  * sudo apt-get install intellij-idea * ... not working either d :, 
  because desktop linux is shit as soon as you leave bash . 
  osx provides bash ** and ** a nice os for pretty much everything else . 
  because vim is a text editor and therefore any ide is objectively more powerful . 
  one understands text , the other understands code . 
  because : 1 - all big parties have cases of corruption so for many this boils down to choosing the lesser evil , and pp is not even remotely close to being the biggest thief , [ that would be psoe ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gjhv0ao.jpg ) . 
  2 - corruption is not the only issue any reasonable person would look at when considering the alternatives ( ie .
