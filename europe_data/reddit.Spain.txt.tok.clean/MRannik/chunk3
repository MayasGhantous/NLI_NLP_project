  when choosing between corruption of pp and the instability of podemos , many would choose the former , as seen last sunday ) . 
  pp wo n't stop being the most voted party anytime soon . 
  even if santamaria becomes candidate the party 's stance on unilateral seccessions wo n't change . 
   rajoy should stfu and get out . 
  that 's not how the eu works , that 's not how any of this works . 
  am i supposed to believe this ? 
  lol, 
  or maybe they simply do n't engage * enlightened * users such as yourself . 
  i do n't think we face the same problems , most of our external inmigration is from central / south america and they integrate extremely well for the most part , the first generation are basically darker spaniards already . 
  ethnic romanians integrate fast aswell , the gipsies ... not so much . 
  s o r p a s s o o r p a s s o, 
  [ this_thread . jpg ] ( http://i.imgur.com/158dzft.jpg ) once again * the democrats * do n't like democracy anymore because : muh old people , muh political corruption , muh sorpasso , muh current year , muh franco , muh fascists ... 
  either get young people 's asses off the couch next time or keep crying all over twitters and facebooks like the pathetic salty losers that you are while the centre-right keeps sweeping elections without even trying . 
  i ca n't think of something more friendly than helping a bro with that . 
  at least corruption is supposed illegal there , not literally encouraged . 
  [ i 'm pretty sure you would . 
  high energy !, 
  yes m8 . 
  no way galicia would become portuguese . 
  i can assure you that ~ ~ la coru neno ~ ~ coru\u00f1a would revolt and form an independent state with fancy lighthouses , obscene amounts of concrete , gigabit internet , fabulous fashion groups , boats , ~ ~ booze ~ ~ estrella galicia and bitches . 
  you can have vigo though . 
   the muslims were spanish wat, 
  lawl, 
   le cringy current_year guy truly brilliant comedy . 
  i 'm pretty sure you do n't need some paperwork to make more humans , just semen , a vagina and 9 months to spare . 
   see : china such a great sight . 
  i do n't care about silly clickbait . 
  open infojobs and point me to all these moderately demanded positions paying 600 $ / month , because all i see is the exact same kind of salaries that i see in my office ( ~ 1000 $ juniors , ~ 1200 $ seniors and +1400 $ analists , the engineers go from 1500 $ to quite a bit more ) . 
   the free market approach has been tried free market politics ? 
  in spain ? 
  lay down the hard drugs dude ... 
   d ) no more extraordinary spending in defense what the actual fuck ? 
  are we talking about the same spain here ? 
  because the spain i live in would have to more than double its military spending just to reach nato 's agreed bare minimum , cutting the defense budget even more would amount to basically dissolving the army because it is already barely sustainable as it is . 
  fuck off jimmy . 
   `` we see this case not only as a clear violation of fundamental rights , but also as a blow to humanity and tolerance . '', 
  lmao, 
   * implying catalonia is not one of the most corrupt regions in spain *, 
   he gets 600 euro a month for a graduate job sounds like the * que mis hijos estudien * bubble is bursting ... lmao . 
  technicians who never touched uni are making more than twice that salary without much experience , hell , even the people flipping burgers full-time at mcdonalds are making significantly more than that . 
  so either you 're lying or your * graduate * friend is so worthless that not even the minimum wage applies to him/her . 
  all these flavors , and you choose to be salty ... 
   defending family values ( which for me is foundation of society ) is n't silly . 
  nah , you 're not defending family values . 
  if you cared about family values , you 'd want more people to adhere to them , not less . 
   soraya ( she 's the second in charge of the pp ) will be the next pm that actually makes it and it will have to come from a psoe abstention . 
  i 'm not even mad . 
  lol @ western sahara, 
  high energy reasoning here . 
  or maybe parents should just educate their children . 
  but of course that 's completely unreasonable , excuse me while i cram even more food down my throat instead . 
   if models looked fit , few people would complain . 
  [ excuse me ? 
  ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03281/beach_3281978b.jpg ) please come back to the real world . 
  more like combat positive body image . 
  fit people are objetively better than fatties , this is biological fact . 
  til me , most of my family , a lot of my friends and 2 out 3 buildings in my street are central european . 
  back into the boat you go . 
   what do you mean by `` low quality '' ? 
  he means `` i do n't like it '' . 
  oh look , another angsty leftist with his/her glorious second republic flag . 
  how surprising :d, 
   sporting events intend to be neutral on political events #lmfao, 
  i fail to see how two wrongs make a right . 
  i mean ... even your major was ashamed enough to not even go to the match . 
   like penelope cruz 's skintone . 
  the tanning bed skintone ? 
   for all we know , the guy in the pic is a native andalusian . 
  certainly not . 
  banning the vote is an attack against catalonia , it very much includes the ones that would vote `` no '' . 
  i know more than one person that would have voted no a few years ago , but not anymore . 
   but scotland had a referendum but chose to stay , which makes it a poor choice by the catalans ... not really , that 's how democracy works , and that 's what they 're asking for . 
  or just wave whatever the fuck they want , because we 're all supposed to be adults . 
  not even tumblirinas would get triggered by a white star on a blue background . 
  perpetual victimism is much easier than getting your ass off the couch . 
   i did n't hear so many complaints when they hacked the roaming charges . 
  nor praise , because virtually no one cares . 
  they hacked the roaming charges because they were inconvenient to them , the 99,9999 % of the eu population could n't care less about something that barely affects them a few days every year , if ever . 
   we all are just victims and ca n't change our lives because of `` external forces and powers '' that make it impossible for us . 
  [ relevant .

   as a fat man who drinks too much soda , i 'm okay with that . 
  obesity 's a shitty road to go down , and we have n't even figured out how to slow the rise of it . 
  have you tried getting your fatty ass off the couch/pc instead of calling nanny state to direct everyone 's lives ? 
  * inb4 it 's genetic , muh metabolism *, 
   i do n't understand why the eu feels like people ca n't make their own minds up about smoking . 
  the glorious eu commision knows better mate , they 're ~ ~ your parents ~ ~ the experts . 
  another daily authoritarian move by the eu ? 
  oh dear , how surprising . 
  you 're my favourite person on reddit . 
  good shit, 
  they 're a sovereign nation , they can do whatever the fuck they want . 
  that includes voiding any agreement at will . 
  very glad for them , i wish spain followed suit . 
   `` spaniards earn 355 less euros a month than our european colleagues '' ftfy, 
   are very lucky if you even get 1200 $ not really . 
  that 's more or less what a technician with 2 years of education ( fp de grado superior ) and only 3 years of experience earns in the software industry , and we 're certainly not the most in demand , i have friends that are making significantly more than that as freelance automation technicians ( 2 years aswell ) . 
  if you 're only looking at unskilled labor then sure , you have to be very lucky to earn 1200 $ , but who in their right mind would pay decent wages for stuff that everyone can do when we have a ~ 20 % unemployment rate ? 
  that 's the thing , i always laugh when hearing the `` liberals are coming '' nonsense . 
  i wish i had liberals to vote ...
