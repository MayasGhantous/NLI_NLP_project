as a countermeasure , dunno, 
  they have their own culture/language , and and i suppose they feel somehow threaten by catalonia/catalan, 
  check * val d'aran * , just 30 % in favour, 
  [ charrua ] ( https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/charruas ) were the people who lived where uruguay is right now ( + parts of argentina/brasil ) . 
  just like cariocas for brazil , and so on . 
  and i think it is because we do speak * weird * to someone from spanish-speaking areas, 
  how could you improve the current situation ? 
  is spanish imposed ? 
  is catalan threatened ? 
  schools do use catalan as main language in every subject unless spanish and english . 
  from p3 ( 3-4yo ) to 2nbatx ( 17-18yo ) . 
  the public tv/radio is only in catalan . 
  the catalan parlament is mainly catalan , some days albert rivera speaks in spanish but thats not the norm . 
  in the streets everything is labeled in catalan and then maybe in spanish/english . 
  your store must be labeled at least in catalan or you get fined . 
  maybe i misunderstood , but it looks like the whole purpose of everything you said here is to get rid of spanish in catalonia , even when half of catalonia speaks spanish and in the metropolitan area its up to 2/3 [ source ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/vangdata/20150420/54430743206/retrato-linguistico-de-catalunya-en-cinco-graficos-interactivos.html )  spanish is an imposed language  with spanish being protected and maybe having some administrative facilities where you could use it  i would not forbid the teaching of spanish , but i but of course prioritise english and catalan ; then , you can learn spanish , french , or any other language . 
  here is a comparison between the centralist franco and the current autonomous communities [ link ] ( http://www.libremercado.com/2015-09-15/el-balance-de-30-anos-de-nacionalismo-catalan-en-cifras-1276556939/ ), 
  nah , i just want to know if there is something different than * franco was bad * and * madrid steal us *, 
  i 'm tired of that , my grandpa was jailed because he was communist , but seems that he wasnt opressed because he wasnt catalan . 
  while my other grandpas fled to mexico , but hey , they were just gallician peasants living in a shithole , so they werent opressed as well . 
   hard time oppression under franco im tired of the franco card  like that wo n't even let catalan meps talk in their native language at the eu . 
  we have 5 official/coofficial languages plus 2 non official ones . 
  they are fully recognized by our constitution ( the official/coofficial ) . 
  shall we bring 5 languages to the eu parlament instead of 1 ? 
  it seems silly to me, 
   oppressing the richest region of your country is a really idiotic thing to do . 
  can i ask where is that opression ? 
   check your facts . 
  he said per capita , and he doesnt lie : c, 
   does anyone know if the spanish government can block catalonia if a clear majority votes for independence ? 
  if a self-governing community does not fulfil the obligations imposed upon it by the constitution or other laws , or acts in a way that is seriously prejudicial to the general interest of spain , the government , after having lodged a complaint with the president of the self-governing community and failed to receive satisfaction therefore , may , following approval granted by the overall majority of the senate , take all measures necessary to compel the community to meet said obligations , or to protect the abovementioned general interest . 
  article 155 of the [ spanish constitution ] ( http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/congreso/congreso/hist_normas/norm/const_espa_texto_ingles_0.pdf ), 
   catalonia is the most successful region of spain by a significant margin i 've read that madrid will overtake catalonia in 2015 in terms of gross gdp . 
  currently madrid 196m and cat 197m, 
  oh , i thought portus = porto and cale = gaia, 
  [ here ] ( http://pelagios.dme.ait.ac.at/maps/greco-roman/ ) it is , just cale, 
  `` emancipated persons habitually resident abroad who voluntarily acquire another nationality or who exclusively use their foreign nationality attributed prior to their emancipation shall lose their spanish nationality . '', 
  source : spanish civil code , title 1 , article 24 anyway , it says you can still hold your spanish citizenship if you notify the administration . 
  but isnt it weird ? 
  the new state would have 7.5 m spanish citizens : /, 
  when the first bourbon reached the throne , he dismantled every institution in the old crown of aragon ( kingdom of aragon , king of valencia and principality of catalonia ) and centralized in a french way everything unless the basques/navarra , because they switched sides from habsburgs to bourbons . 
  so since then , spanish was the only language in the administration . 
  edit : in the republics , catalan language earned an equal status in the administration, 
  but i want to go to germoney or sweden :(, 
   you can not expel 7.5 million people . 
  he mentions eu citizenship as all those catalans will still have with their spanish passports . 
  they want to skip the 2nd article of our constitution * the constitution is based on the indissoluble unity of the spanish nation , the common and * ** indivisible ** * homeland of all spaniards * and at the same time , keep the 11th article * no person of spanish birth may be deprived of his or her nationality * independence \u00e0 la carte, 
   former colonies guinea was an overseas province of spain . 
   can you show me where does it says that spain can take the nationality from people born in spain that already have the nationality ?? 
  [ link ] ( http://www.mjusticia.gob.es/cs/satellite/portal/es/areas-tematicas/nacionalidad/nacionalidad/como-pierde-nacionalidad ) but at the same time , you can just have two passports ( not dual citizenship ) , so idk what they will do . 
   will spain change the constitution just to fuck the catalans ? 
  i bet some of them would . 
   haha , no . 
  first of all people from equatorial guinea and western sahara born during the colony times can still claim spanish nationality . 
  they can claim it after living 2 years here in spain , like all latam , pt , andorra and the philippines . 
   lso , from day one , catalan citizens will still be spanish citizens ( they 'll hold spanish passports ) and thus they 'll hold eu citizenship with all the benefits . 
  spanish morocco and spanish equatorial guinea were provinces of spain and when they declared their independence , the citizens lost their spanish passport , i wouldnt be that sure . 
   how bad would it be for spain ? 
  terrible , but i think nobody would win in that situation, 
  but he has a point , if they are not in , that would mean that catalonia as state is recognized by at least the eu . 
   why would you assume that a country would be party to dozens of treaties the first day of its independence ? 
  and if you were that country why would you want that assumption made ? 
  ask their leader [ ` no-one can expel catalonia from eu ' says raul romeva ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34197413 ) '' * i 'm spanish * '' and '' * you can not expulse 7.5 million people * '', 
  nobody has cared about our borders , even when immigrants were storming our borders . 
  when they reached spain , europe said that it was an internal issue and we should fix that ourselves . 
  ah , and we cant kick them back, 
   there are n't any syrians going all the way to morocco just to sneak into the eu . 
  they are coming , but in lower numbers and morocco closed its borders . 
  we just won [ exp.all item ] ( http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/kanto_route_15#items ) capturing 50 * spain has arrested some * ** 50 ** * suspected islamist militants and recruiters this year alone , mostly in the spanish enclaves of ceuta and melilla on the north coast of morocco , as well as in the catalonia region . 
   how does this compare to tourism overall ? 
  those visits contribute up to 6.100 millions, 
  at that time , we were being invaded by napoleon . 
  also , the colonies wanted the same status as our metropoli ( mainland spain ) and we denied them , spaniards born in spain were often elected as governors or in administrative places over * creoles * and people from there , so they revolted . 
  the same happened with the philippines before the american-spanish war , [ jos\u00e9 rizal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jos%c3%a9_rizal#in_brussels_and_spain_.281890.e2.80.9392.29 ) wanted : * that the philippines be made a province of spain ( philippines was a sub-colony of new spain - now mexico , administered from mexico city ) * representation in the cortes * filipino priests instead of spanish friars -- augustinians , dominicans , and franciscans -- in parishes and remote sitios * freedom of assembly and speech * equal rights before the law ( for both filipino and spanish plaintiffs ) and we said no again . 
  i think you ca n't compare those times with the current situation , in spain right now , we have the same taxes and the same rights and duties . 
   from about 987 to 1137 catalonia was independent de jure we were part of the frankish kingdom until 1258, 
  here is the [ pic ] ( https://www.google.fr/logos/doodles/2015/22nd-anniversary-of-the-official-recognition-of-french-traditional-bread-5149955048079360-hp.jpg ), 
  here is the [ interview ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncmdjsjhd5w ), 
  madrid and baleares have even more , and after 30 years nobody touched it . 
  i dont want catalonia to secede , but with this strong movement , maybe something changes in the spanish gov. 
  ps : i doubt it . 
   and the source of the 5 family is el pays uruguay which is a very right wing newspaper . 
  ( could be wrong about that . ), 
  there is the same new from a venezuelan newspaper [ link-in spanish ] ( http://www.eluniversal.com/internacional/150907/familias-sirias-protestan-porque-quieren-irse-de-uruguay ) here the protest [ youtube-in spanish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm2g5hsiwqe ) and here a `` specialist '' about arab things [ cnnespa\u00f1ol-in spanish ] ( http://cnnespanol.cnn.com/video/cnnee-intvw-cafe-susana-mangana-syrian-refugees/ ) but maybe they are all wrong . 
  just look at what is happening in uruguay , all is in spanish but i think voc\u00ea pode entender !, 
  [ link1 ] ( http://www.eluniversal.com/internacional/150907/familias-sirias-protestan-porque-quieren-irse-de-uruguay ) [ youtubevideo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm2g5hsiwqe ) [ specialist talking about why they dont want to live in uruguay ] ( http://cnnespanol.cnn.com/video/cnnee-intvw-cafe-susana-mangana-syrian-refugees/ ), 
   spain tries to force their culture into ours . 
  may i ask how ? 
  and where is the different structure ? 
  they do use one word + * voseo * and we use other + * tuteo * . 
   and some of these `` spanish '' have even different structures . 
  could you give me an example ? 
  yes , you can understand everyone , the problem is which words do we use and which words do they use . 
  in many places of the americas , they have kept words that are completely lost here in spain . 
  and even here inside , we do use some words here in barcelona that i doubt people from outside the region would understand . 
  but that happen because 1 out of 2 words are slang . 
   why not ? 
  because barcelona with 5million people is the important part , if bcn doesnt break free , the rest will not secede . 
  all or nothing . 
   different regions should be able to have different result a free catalonia with only lleida and girona ?
