  in spain we used to say '' * \u00a1 santiago y cierra , espa\u00f1a !, 
  * '' invoking saint jacques to aid us . 
  here in catalonia/aragonese crown , the warcry was '' * desperta ferro !, 
  * '' , awake iron !, 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/awake_iron ! ), 
  i think we dont use a battle cry anymore, 
   but it would be a good idea for an independent catalonia to have cultural and educational links with those places . 
  they are already doing it , catalan [ embassy ] ( http://presidencia.gencat.cat/ca/ambits_d_actuacio/delegacions_del_govern_i_representacions_de_la_generalitat/casa_de_la_generalitat_a_perpinya/ ) in perpignan . 
  they forgot about alghero :(, 
  in spain i think people only support foreign teams when they play madrid/bar \u00e7a ( being bar\u00e7a / madrid fan ) . 
  1492 reaching the americas 1492 first grammar of castillian spanish, 
   ban the constitution thanks to that , all the colonies fled, 
  and [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2c2vgojpj4 ) too . 
  the cops didnt have the permission to dissuade those guys, 
  woah , they did a campaign against him at twitter [ #rototomcontractszionism ] ( https://twitter.com/hashtag/rototomcontractszionism ) they all look leftist radicals , boycott against israel , etc, 
  i 've heard people here in catalonia speaking in catalan and switching to spanish to insult . 
  i would say 1492 , reconquista finished , expell of everyone and [ gram\u00e1tica de la lengua castellana by antonio de nebrija ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gram%c3%a1tica_de_la_lengua_castellana ) with the trastamaras, 
  we have that game , with two hands but without singing and without name . 
  you start with your hands under his hands , and you need to hit his backhand with your palms . 
  if you hit him , yout keep hitting , if you fail , the other gets his chance . 
  edit : i found its called * calientamanos * hand-warming and there is an image of the [ game ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-r_6nvcjzzmg/tzy7fvdnp4i/aaaaaaaaab8/j9m76kdapem/s320/image21.gif ) [ explanation in spanish ] ( http://juegosalternativos1.blogspot.com.es/2011/04/juegos-sensoriales-sesion-2.html ), 
  and also the [ 23-f ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23-f ) . 
  where antonio tejero tried a coup d'etat and the former king solved the situation later . 
  the origin of the current flag of spain is the naval ensign of 1785 , pabell\u00f3n de la marina de guerra under charles iii of spain . 
  ** it was chosen by charles iii himself among 12 different flags designed by antonio vald\u00e9s y baz\u00e1n ( all projected flags were presented in a drawing which is in the naval museum of madrid ) . 
  ** the flag remained marine for much of the next 50 years , flying over coastal fortresses , marine barracks and other naval property . 
  during the peninsular war the flag could also be found on marine regiments fighting inland . 
  not until 1820 was the first spanish land unit ( the la princesa regiment ) provided with one and it was not until 1843 that queen isabella ii of spain would make the flag official . 
  [ flag of spain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_spain ) and [ there ] ( http://www.vexilologia.org/bandera/propuestas1785.jpg ) the 12 possible flags,

  outdated . 
  since the football nt success , lolololo is the one used, 
  [ lolo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwah4n6ucum ) is far better, 
   nobody in barcelona calls it `` ensache '' my father does, 
  the two crowns on the pilars are the royal crown ( same as the big one : [ crown ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/corona_real_de_espa%c3%b1a#/media/file:corona_real_espa%c3%b1ola.svg ) ) and the imperial [ crown ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/corona_imperial#/media/file:corona_imperial.svg ) so we have 3 crosses, 
  wow , that link has this related [ iberian lynx released into wild in spain ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-17297900 ) 13 april 2012 . 
  where they say : now though , conservationists from lynx life ** are starting the next phase of their rescue plan - releasing some of the captive-born cats into the wild ** . 
  i thought the spanish one was [ this ] ( http://www.markify.com/images/ctm/originals/006405765.jpg ) . 
   i ca n't understand how on earth tsipras and varoufakis thought that the spanish would be on board in their attempt , the spanish would have nothing to gain from engaging into a ulta-leftist initiative that when succeeding would just make populist gain power in spain and in worst case would drive the eurozone under deadlock and jeopardize economical stability of all member states . 
  syriza/tsipras think/s that podemos can win here or at least have good results to force something in a national/european level . 
   they \u00b4 re too pussy to turn the africans back . 
  which is what any sane politician would order . 
  15000 $ / immigrant kicked [ link ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/court-fines-italy-for-deporting-migrants-to-libya/a-15761455 ), 
   only people born in catalonia with parents born in catalonia before 1980 why not before 1900 ? 
  you would need only 16 catalan surnames, 
   only natives should be allowed to vote ?? 
  wow , we want to take back andorra , and 300y ago we conquered catalonia, 
  i dont know why the pick that colour . 
  even in the first republic the colours used were red-yellow-red . 
  no , [ this one is far better ] ( https://davesplace.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/spanish-flag.jpg ),

  i like [ paco de luc\u00eda - entre dos aguas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oyhlad64-s ) from spain , 
  with or without onion ? 
  it was an accident . 
  the rise of the nationalisms in the 19thcentury activated most of our peripheral nationalisms . 
  as someone said before , our civil wars were traditionalism vs liberalism/republicanism, 
  i dont count it as one , phillip v hadnt centralised the aragonese lands yet, 
  we only had the 1st carlist war , the 2nd carlist war , the 3rd carlist war and the civil war . 
  damn , almost 80years without one #, 
  the wtc was a little accident and nyc was the canvas / s, 
  [ entre dos aguas - paco de luc\u00eda ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oyhlad64-s ), 
  i bet most of our elders play that game, 
  lol true , my bad !, 
   bosnia , croatia , italy , greece , serbia , slovenia , israel , lithuania , macedonia , montenegro , poland , russia , spain and turkey wtf , are they mad ? 
  ( western ) iberia !, 
  we could have a province called lusitania and be the fyrom/greece of the west !, 
   how does spain compare productivity wise with other eu countries ? 
  here is the oecd table about productivity [ link ] ( https://data.oecd.org/lprdty/gdp-per-hour-worked.htm#indicator-chart ), 
   spanish ( 410 million speakers )  portuguese ( 250 million speakers ) western iberia , best iberia . 
  btw , is it normal to have just a few dots in galicia in the 1910 map ? 
  is that tunis on the left ? 
  i thought the gallicians were your irm\u00e3os : /, 
  a random citizen would need 10 years to be spanish , a refugee 5 , and 2 for ibero-american countries , andorra , the philippines , portugal , ecuatorial guinea or sephardic jews . 
  i share mine with saddam hussein : /, 
  i read a few zara/santander , i would have said madrid/bar \u00e7a as brands, 
  if you want 600k users go to forocoches, 
  if they dont reach central europe ... 
  you can post in / r/barcelona / too , this current post is in the 3rd page . . 
  if you are only staying for 1 month , i would stick with spanish , you can add a few catalan words like thanks and goodbye ( to be polite , as you said ) . 
  and consider that in barcelona ( if you come here ) , up to 60 % of the population speaks spanish as first language . 
  have fun here , 
  glad they dont have 48 \u00f7 2 ( 9 +3 ), 
  in spanish we have city + - a , - aco , - a\u00edno , - \u00e1n , - ano , - ar , - ario , - asco , - eco , - ego , - enco , - eno , - ense , - e\u00f1o , - eo , - ero , - \u00e9s , - esco , - \u00ed , - iego , - ino , - isco , - ita , - o , - ol , - ota , - uco and - uz as endings .

  a guy somewhere in this thread said something about image noise . 
  or maybe the [ atlantis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atlantis#in_europe ), 
  philip wanted to set a capital and the contenders were barcelona , but it was soo close to france , lisbon , the castillian nobility would revolt and madrid , because in toledo/sevilla the church had power with their archbishop etc,

   of those arrested , five were spanish nationals of jordanian , moroccan and syrian descent and two foreign nationals from syria and morocco . 
  i think it was just to add that y can be said as ye, 
   i think spain tried to remove the y years back .
