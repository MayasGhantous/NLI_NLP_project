  i doubt it . 
  * the text proclaims catalan as the `` national and official '' language of catalonia , while it recognizes a `` special legal status '' for spanish -- that is , it does not give it the same status as catalan .

  portugal , i went a few summers ago and i feel like i was in galicia, 
  and they lost the northern part to the us, 
  idk why we are still participating, 
  it sounds slavic to me : /, 
  i like the portu-escudos and the greek owls, 
  prior to the ww1 we lost cuba , puerto rico and philipines to the usa, 
  portuguese with * anticonstitucionalissimamente * , french with * anticonstitutionnellement * . 
  why ca n't we use * anticonstitucional\u00edsimamente * ? 
  go back to the steppes , gengis . 
  release the emus !, 
  go back to rac\u00f3catal\u00e0, 
  we also have the '' con franco se vivia mejor '' / `` with franco we lived better '', 
  here in catalonia you need the c1 level on catalan . 
  so i guess it is the same there . 
  so maybe if it should be returned to anyone it should be to the ~ ~ moors ~ ~ romans . 
   coping on her own is now second nature to this single mother who explains that ibu 's father , who now lives in sweden , left when their son was just 18 months old . 
  afaik , they havent developed an app to rate their spanish, 
  80 % of that ngo budget ( 620.000 $ / y ) comes from the catalan gov, 
  judeo-spanish from sephardic jews ? 
  wikipedia says : recognised minority language in bosnia and herzegovina , france , israel and turkey, 
   an where is the basque island ?

  \u3064 \u25d5 _ \u25d5 \u3064 mariano take my energy \u3064 \u25d5 _ \u25d5 \u3064 , already 18 %, 
  ainhoa is also a female name in basque, 
   and we 're not blaming foreigners for our problems i thought everything was merkel 's fault : /, 
  it is ? 
  wasnt it nearly destroyed in the 1700s earthquake ? 
  should we give back everything below the douro ? 
  of course , look at these picts [ link ] ( http://www.elconfidencial.com/sociedad/2017-03-02/banda-simpa-rumanos-leon_1341690/ ), 
  in fact , the anomaly was when we were under 10 % [ pic related ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gxrql7l.png ), 
  [ video of the guys celebrating being in spain ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3lrnrnystc ), 
  i think the main issue is [ this ] ( http://www.mappery.com/maps/gibraltar-1704-onwards-map.mediumthumb.gif ) . 
  they took half the neutral zone when they had yellow fever and had to build * temporary * tents in that zone . 
  later on , they built an airport when we were fighting in a civil war . 
  i still remember [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7yqemebpze ), 
  old soviet tanks engaging combat in syria ( photo ), 
   if we google `` siria '' , the first results come from a news agency called `` sputnik italia '' , which is a pro-putin website full of russian bullshit . 
  i 've heard a few times '' moltes merc\u00e8s '', 
  cervantes in soul calibur, 
  why not to the romans/italians ? 
  here in spain we have ** gala inocente inocente ** , every december 28th they do a tv show where they prank famous people etc , the money they earn from donations goes to the spanish association against cancer on a regional level , here in catalonia we have ** la marat\u00f3 ** , is a tv show where the money goes to different stuff , one per year i havent found how much have they get in the spanish one , but in the catalan one , this ( 2016 ) last marato , they reached almost 8.5 m euro [ link ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_marat%c3%b3_de_tv3#edicions ) year/disease/caster / length/money / #donations,

  i know that both languages are romance but ... really ? 
  i cant grasp a thing from romanian ( when talked ) : / what movie if i may ask ? 
  catalan, 
  i was expecting being more similar to our mediterranean bros ( pt/ita/gr ) than to irish/brits/germans, 
  too bad they are laistas, 
  we have cristiano and ricardinho as hostages . 
  ps : you can keep casillas up there in porto, 
  and then you add eros ramazzotti , tiziano ferro and zucchero , and almost native italian, 
  i still remember this headline ** spain ca n't use force to stop migrants : eu ** * eu interior commissioner cecilia malmstr\u00f6m has warned spain that it can not use force to prevent immigrants from crossing the border into its north african enclaves of ceuta and melilla . 
  the commissioner said that she would not hesitate to take action if she saw clear signs of european laws being broken , reports the p\u00fablico online new site . 
  * [ link ] ( https://www.thelocal.es/20141021/eu-warns-spain-over-border-use-of-force-immigration-melilla-ceuta ), 
  it is [ maps ] ( https://www.google.es/maps/@41.369421,2.147,3a,75y,97.71h,87.62t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1saf1qipo8naqyjrfc1k7wecrwq5vrlbo6wprdeokixdcc!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2f%2flh5.googleusercontent.com%2fp%2faf1qipo8naqyjrfc1k7wecrwq5vrlbo6wprdeokixdcc%3dw203-h100-k-no-pi-19.8125-ya145.79164-ro0-fo100!7i8704!8i4352 ), 
  we have big boards like forocoches , meneame , etc. . . 
   and it 's only 17.2 % !!, 
  thats our average between 1982-2017 , 2002-2008 ( < 10 % ) was the anomally here, 
  he is also the patron saint of spain [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james,_son_of_zebedee#spain ), 
   confusion would be avoid if the original name of the region was used gallaecia ? 
  * the high point was the raid on santiago de compostela ( galicia ) in 997 , in which the town was razed , the church destroyed and its bells taken to c\u00f3rdoba -- on the backs of prisoners-of-war -- to be used as lamps in the great mosque . 
  * funfact : during the reconquest of cordoba , fernando iii the saint moved the bells back to santiago . 
  * the great bells of compostella , which almansor had caused to be brought hither on the backs of christians , st. ferdinand commanded to be carried back on the backs of moors . 
  ** $ 1 billion ** will be spent over the next five years to implement 200 measures wtf i know we must tackle this problem , but 1billion for ~ 50 cases ... isnt that a bit much ?

  super saiyajin heart, 
   catalan nationalists ( terra lliure ) killed one man apparently he blew himself up, 
   catalan nationalists are the most radical they 've ever been and still not terrorists . 
  they tried with [ terra lliure ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terra_lliure ), 
  they are using the old ^ till ^ 2015 [ regions of france ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%a9gion_fran%c3%a7aise#/media/file:1005_regions_colors.png ) where basque country ( france ) should be inside aquitaine, 
  there is a * basque country * with ( spain ) and another without it : o, 
  i hope it doesnt end like bcn world , eurovegas and so on, 
  i prefer fuet , longaniza or chorizo , over a shitty cheap jamon, 
  i think it should be / \u029do\u031en / , like * yo * in spanish plus an n. 
  what is that orange-black-orange thing ? 
  companies want profits , they dont care about linguistic/political agenda . 
  you truly believe than in an independent catalonia , * private * companies will follow the will of people , instead of making profits ? 
  i doubt it . 
   despite catalan language being ** more spoken ** than other european languages like czech , hungarian , swedish , finnish or lithuanian and this is not true , and you know it . 
  it may be known ( iirc 11m ) but not spoken ( at least here in catalonia , a [ publication ] ( http://llengua.gencat.cat/web/.content/documents/publicacions/altres/arxius/eulp2013_angles.pdf ) by the gencat , states that 36.3 % of the catalans use catalan as habitual language , compared to 50.7 % of catalans using spanish ) . 
  well , as an example , the catalan gov ( we , i pay my taxes here so ... xd ) paid 97.000 to dub star wars : the force awakens , while the spanish dub was done by the film distributor ... [ link in catalan ] ( http://www.naciodigital.cat/noticia/100087/plataforma/llengua/denuncia/97000/euros/generalitat/pagat/doblar/star/wars/al/catala ), 
   in my university we had spanish classes ( the majority ) , catalan classes ( some of them ) and english classes ( very few ) . 
  i would like the 3 languages having closer status , but i do n't complain that much about it . 
  specially when there are other students ( recently was on the news ) that complained about the fact in university , they had all classes in spanish for the whole year ; 0 catalan . 
  and if you are in catalonia this should n't be like this .
