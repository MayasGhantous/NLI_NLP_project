if only you guys did n't vote for the most retarded ... maybe those living in villages would n't have to go to beograd for surgeries or to make superior education for example . 
  or they 'd go to beograd in a highway and not in a road with potholes . 
  how much culture , values and richness have lost ( and keep losing ! ), 
  the ex-yu countries because of hate ? 
  maybe you guys would be as rich as the czech republic or slovakia are slowly getting if it was n't for your stupid hate . 
  if you do n't want to do it for being okay with your neighbours , do it for the fucking money !, 
  i 'm a socialist but pasok is like a big joke , really . 
  i really do n't know what would i vote if i were greek and there were elections next sunday ; before tsipras betrayed the referendum i 'd have voted syriza i guess . 
  the only one worth - even if negotiating he was n't too efficient - was varoufakis . 
  varoufakis stayed loyal to his ideas . 
  now you 'll come and tell me `` hey dude !, 
  he 's in the far-left but he lives by the acropolis in an awesome house , he 's rich etc '' . 
  i prefer million times that than the politicians we have in spain , who are rich by getting their hands where they should not . 
  varoufakis is a teacher in some great universities , and i think that should be well-paid . 
  i just hope people around the world do n't think all spaniards are so primitive as to take part in all these bulls ' things . 
  this is mostly from the countryside ( and some stupid tourists but i do n't think they make the majority unless in pamplona ) , and i 'd say most people participating are illiterate or have basic education . 
  i just hope as the spanish population gets smarter ( i have at least some hope this happens !, 
  ) , all this shit ends . 
  this makes no good for the bull but , as we can see , neither does for the people putting themselves in front of the animal . 
  there 's no point to keep them . 
  socialdemocrats , not a right-wing party at all , but not far-left either like podemos or some others . 
  well , at least these have some text !, 
  here the main parties ' texts are `` work , grow , do '' , `` govern for the majority '' and `` it 's the time of the people '' . 
  not much else ... 
  that 's true and we 're already on facebook and twitter . 
  but this is a 6000 people village with many old people whih may not be as keep on new technologies , that 's why we 're not stopping there and we 're using traditional mail to spread what we propose . 
  on banners there is n't even text !, 
  just the face of the candidate ( okay , in small towns that 's useful because many will know the candidate personally ) , and the party 's logo . 
  the thing is that we have some kind of `` war '' with the rest of the parties to get the best places for those banners , and it 's getting a bit stupid on my opinion , since i do n't think many will change their vote just by looking at a piece of paper with a face and a logo . 
  i 'd like to think people read what every party propose , think about it with time , and decide . 
  i 'm not too sure of that though . 
  german supermarkets like lidl or aldi suck !, 
  i 'd rather thank france for carrefour !, 
  i 'd still choose to live in portugal rather than macedonia . 
  and sadly since i 'm particularly interested on ex-yugoslavian countries and culture . 
  that 's why i so dislike this names debate : it does n't allow macedonians to fight for real useful stuff like good public services or measures to get a competitive economy . 
  i would n't give a flying shit . 
  what would annoy me is my government speaking all the times about names , or ignoring unemployed people , or spending all the public money on statues ( ugly as fuck , by the way ) while hospitals and schools clearly lack funds , all this to create on people a nationalist feeling that makes them forget how much they 're lacking compared to their southern neighbour or most european countries . 
  europe has to offer deeper measures that go beyond defending borders and the mediterranean sea , like awareness campaigns in main subsaharian countries : the trip is difficult , unsafe , mafias will use you and steal your money plus you may end up dead in the seabed of the mediterranean , plus , if you 're lucky and enter , you 'll unfortunately face isolation and wo n't have things easy . 
  it 's really sad , but it 's true , and i think if they knew since the very beginning how risky is the trip , they 'd think twice . 
  a smokescreen to avoid speaking about how corrupt the political system in macedonia - or fyrom , however you wan na call it - is . 
  if i were macedonian i 'd rather worry about unemployment rates of around 27 % , for example , and not about my country being called macedonia or fyrom or about how great some guy called alexander was a long time ago . 
  less past and more future . 
  maybe the judge is finally the one judged and ceased , as usual . 
  all the corruption scandals coming out at a time and all elections ( excepting the europeans , obviously ) happening this year . 
  the gods of the glorious real estate years keep falling while the one who supported and loved them stays for now as president of the government . 
  it 's going to be a warm year in spain , no doubt !, 
  it 's quite clear maduro is n't qualified to be president of anything . 
  i 'm a socialist myself and i 'm not a big fan of this system they 've created in venezuela , even if i must admit chavez seemed to be way more ready than this one . 
  and no , i 'm not a fan of rajoy , his government is also big shit and this is why i 've moved abroad for a while . 
  but at least in spain we can kick him out in november in the elections , in venezuela they have it a bit harder to remove maduro . 
  ** ashamed ** : - almost 40 years of dictatorship which only finished when the dictator died . 
  the fact we settled with a monarchy after this . 
  - big problems and stupid bureaucraty when trying to set up an enterprise . 
  entrepreneurs have no help at all from the government and this is really stupid in a country having such high unemployment rates . 
  - we 're unable to have a productive and stable economical/entreprenurial system . 
  if we 're into a huge crisis now it 's been because we got totally crazy with real estate . 
  now the unemployment rate is really shameful . 
  - with the crisis , we 're reducing the budgets in fields such as r&d and education , which is so risky economically in the long term . 
  - we 're unable to admit the church has too much power in our daily society , meanwhile on sundays churches get more and more empty . 
  our constitution says we 're an aconfesional country but religion has its place at schools ( not compulsory though , but still it steals time for useful subjects such as maths , or english , or whatever else ) . 
  - political corruption and an inefficient , slow justice system which prevents corrupt politicians from getting into prison . 
  - being known for building [ useless airports ] ( https://www.google.fr/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=57&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0cfiqfjagodi&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ozy.com%2facumen%2fspain-s-ghost-airports-a-national-embarrassment%2f33041&amp;ei=ixcwvf6oiywisggo24fg&amp;usg=afqjcnekhpy84av4iy0o3v2ia4ov9itqsg&amp;bvm=bv.91071109,d.bgq ) and rail lines , among many others . 
  - many spaniards are too conformist about our country and still think it 's paradise . 
  i recognise some ** positive aspects ** though : - i think we 're pretty welcoming and open towards tourists and i do n't see spaniards as racist people ( assholes are everywhere though ) . 
  we 're not too cold and i 'd say we like to speak and exchange opinions . 
  - the fact some kind of far-far-far-right party still does n't have success in spain , unlike front national in france , ukip or hrisi avgi . 
  - some social decisions like abortion ( now restricted though ) or gay marriage / adoption . 
  laws to protect vulnerable social groups like disabled people and their families ( now also restricted ) . 
  - some strong enterprises like inditex ( owners of zara shops among many others ) , although many of them still lack social responsibility measures , and try to pay taxes in other countries . 
  - the spanish health system ( i hope they stop cutting budget funds there ) . 
  nowadays the govenrment does n't give a flying shit about culture but i think we have some really popular painters , writers or singers . 
  there are also some things which do n't get me ashamed or proud , but which make me ** worry ** for my country 's future : - as i said , the fact we 're cutting budget funds for education and r&d . spain does n't have commodities ( oil , gas , etc ) so i guess the only way to be economically competitive in the future is via added value . 
  an illiterate people which makes no research at all can not create quality products with that added value . 
  - the fact we 're doing nothing to increase our fertility rate : we have a too low fertility rate and that can be catastrofic in the long term . 
  who 's going to pay retired people 's payments ? 
  what shows arrogance is judging people for not wearing a tie which is nothing but a piece of cloth . 
  they 're so horrible they do n't wear ties eh, 
  totally against banning them from voting . 
  but education has to play its role and explain students ( and adults too through media ) how the democratic system and politics work . 
  this way we 'd avoid having people who know totally nothing about how a country is ruled voting . 
  and mercedes benz from the 80s . 
  look , i 'm spanish so i 'm neutral on this and i wo n't enter in the crappy nationalist debate all you guys are having for 25 years now . 
  but if i had to move to albania or serbia , i choose serbia million times since their economy and expectatives are way better than albania 's . 
  what does albania produce ? 
  well they got the independence so they can do pretty much whatever . 
  this said , i do n't see any improvement on splitting from serbia to join albania . 
  the first one is way more prosperous than the other . 
  they 're better alone now living from the eu , us and nato aids . 
  because obviously nothing is produced over there . 
  take a bus and go to budapest . 
  i 've been twice in bratislava and only found some cool underground bars but nothing too great . 
  maybe the university area in the surroundings for some partying . 
  oh yeah , so fantastic to unite with such a rich , succesful country as albania . 
  they can do whatever but well ... it does n't sound too great . 
  only when serbia starts looking forward and forget the dark , horrible past it suffered , this beautiful country will grow , become competitive and people will actually have a promising future there without having to emigrate to germany or austria . 
  i 'm not pro-kosovo 's independence but in my opinion the situation is irreversible nowadays and sooner or later we should accept it . 
  this will make serbia 's entry in the eu easier . 
  also , improving relationships with ex-yu countries could impact serbian economy in a positive way . 
  well if people still vote for them it must be for some reason , like that they consider their lives have improved with them being in the government .
