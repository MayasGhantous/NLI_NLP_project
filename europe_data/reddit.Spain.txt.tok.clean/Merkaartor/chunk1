always is a bad moment . 
  but that 's the natural evolution of eu ( i would say ) . 
  like other redditors said , the existence of the european union is what is making stateless nations rally for independence . 
  senyera , flag of catalonia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/senyera, 
  i 'm just curious , but who is not an idiot ? , that way i wo n't vote idiots . 
  yep , and i believe catalans in general will be ok if we had to increase contributions to 3 or even 4 % , when independent ( more than 4 % it would be excessive imo ) . 
  in catalonia case , we want to keep sharing money with poorest zones , not only from spain , but from all the eu . 
  of course the apportation would change : from an 8 % of gdp ( now in spain ) , to a 2 % of gdp ( in europe ) . 
  we can get poorer , we can get richer or we can stay more or less the same . 
  i do n't think independence movement is that much about economy . 
  aragon and murcia inside of catalonia ( not even catalan countries ) , you go hard xd . 
  why do you write him the last sentence in spanish ? . 
  not sure whats the purpose of that , he seems to understands english well . 
  that one from valls is a big lol . 
  when he totally demonstrated the opposite . 
  you sure they were serious comments ? 
  then why is pp winning ? . 
  we can say pp is the democratic evolution of franchism . 
  have you really heard that ? , i would say every catalan knows that there is only one worst scenario than being part of spain , which is being part of france . 
  and i would say that 's the exact reason why catalans historically have had a better alliance with spaniards , just to avoid our french pals . 
  i did in the past : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4w7x2r/le_figaro_catalan_secessionists_the_push_against/d6573b1 but not sure if it is worth it . 
  we are all grown ups and i 'm sure people does not believe everything what a reddit member says ( including me in the package ) . 
  sadly , i must upvote xd . 
  independence and interdependence are not opposing terms . 
  best korea has closed itself to the world by creating `` walls '' and being `` angry '' with everybody . 
  i do n't know why that makes them the freest xd . 
   really pissess me off ** secessionists ** try to equate being catalan together with supporting the break off from spain . 
    ** their ** mentality is that spaniards are catalonia 's enemies , and if you support them you are n't catalan . 
  you have a large list of comments . 
  i am secessionist . 
  and i do not think spaniards are my enemies . 
  i have disagreements and i defend my ideas , but thy are not my enemies . 
  which is ok , you have your own opinion . 
  well , it is you who pisses me off since you do n't stop generalizing as we ( pro-independence supporters ) are all evil . 
  i do n't know what happened in you personal life to hate us so much , but relax and enjoy our national day . 
   the problem is that many people used it to spread their political ideas , as always . 
  a nation is a social and political product , so it 's quite normal to celebrate our national day defending our language , culture , and show our desire of emancipation . 
  happy national day !, 
  but that 's because of all the muslims killing themselves while trying to kill western sinners . 
  if not for them , suicide rate in france would be lower . 
  hence france it 's not really an outlier . 
  ( not serious ), 
  third elections gets closer a * pp-citizens * government , imo . 
  to be honest , pnv does n't need pp votes to form a government . 
  nothing strange here , in southern europe we are too lazy even to kill ourselves . 
  nice try toiletman , next time will be better . 
  andorra is working hard !, 
  do not forget your past and your roots , that way you will always have a brighter future . 
  lol, 
   but the 4/5 that we did n't send would n't win anything any not sure . 
  south america is very competitive ( brasil , argentina , uruguay ... ), 
   kis also include public administration . 
  maybe that has some influence too . 
  i will fight for my country if the fight is worth it ( according to my standards ) , i.e. , i would not go to syria to fight , but i support kurdistan fight against isis , and i do n't see a problem helping them economically . 
  well , that 's the point of professional armies , if you go , you get paid . 
  and pretty well i would say . 
  if young spaniards want some money , and if they think it 's worth it , they will join . 
  you need to chill , but believe me when i say that i 'm trying to get * the fuck out * as much as i can :d . 
  yeah sure , sure , your text is correct ... 
  i 'm sorry , but i think a counterpart is needed :  the truth is catalans discriminate against native spaniards no . 
  many of us ( pro-independence ) are from native spanish families , and our mother tongue is spanish , but since we consider ourselves catalans , we defend catalan culture and catalan language because it 's ours too . 
  i just wonder how big that discrimination to native spanish people can be when we had a president of catalonia who was from [ andalusia ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/jos%c3%a9_montilla_i_aguilera ) , which was not only voted by many citizens that support independence today , but also had the explicit support of erc ( pure independence party ) , creating a government coalition , [ tripartit ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/tripartito_catal%c3%a1n ) . 
   they are denied access to education in their language and that makes it so kids that grow up speaking spanish have lower grades and higher rates of failure no . 
  public education is public education , that means that because you are giving the same education system to everyone you must find balance , this is , a system where everyone ends up with general decent skills and tries to keep all families with a certain level of satisfaction ( if not , private education is your friend ) . 
  in catalonia we follow a system called [ language immersion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/language_immersion ) , which is implemented to make sure that every catalan citizen has catalan and spanish skills ( and step by step english is being added ) . 
  this system was especially done to help large spanish immigrants settlements , so they could learn spanish and at the same time be part of catalan culture , as long as they wanted to be part of . 
  i dare you to find a citizen in catalonia , under the language immersion system , that does n't speak spanish . 
  and about the rates of failure , if you 're bad student you 're bad student , does n't matter what language you speak . 
  just an example , [ gabriel rufian ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/gabriel_rufi%c3%a1n ) was from spanish family , learned catalan , and got a university degree . 
  and now is an important figure in erc . 
  another example is [ chakir el homrani lesfar ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/chakir_el_homrani_lesfar ) , and those are just two famous politicians , many anonymous people coming from immigrants backgrounds have succeed under our education system . 
  i did n't know that data ( if you have some source would be great ) . 
   books in catalan get subsidized since we try to defend our culture and language i do n't see whats the problem . 
  hence , spanish books are subsidized too , not as much as catalans , but they are . 
  actually , booking sector is a well-known subsidized sector , especially schooling books . 
  not only in catalonia , in spain and probably all countries in europe . 
  anyway , our [ national day ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/23/st-georges-day-catalonia ) is about buying books and roses , a good book is a good book , does n't matter the language :d .  catalan writers that write in spanish are not considered catalan therefore not invited to events what the hell are you talking about ? . 
   if you advertise your business in spanish you are taxed whereas catalan subsidized no . 
  first of all , that tax was not done for advertising in spanish . 
  it was done for not advertising in both languages . 
  so business , in theory , had to advertise both in spanish and catalan . 
  i said in theory , because in practice this law has not been implemented . 
  i dare you to go to a random business advertised in spanish and ask them how much they pay to the government for advertising in spanish , i can already tell you the answer , it would be 0 , if they do n't replied with : what tax are you talking about ? , i 've never heard about it . 
  i could go on with every sentence of your text , but is really exhausting and i think it was enough to show that your opinion has a big bias , and people who wants to have a better image of the reality should not believe your words . 
  actually they should not believe mine either , they should dig deeper . 
  is a different approach with some interesting ideas . 
  like most things in life , the optimus point must lie somewhere in between extremes . 
  i do n't know , but i do n't see asturias as castille , even though they have assimilated the language . 
  a lifetime xd . 
  each person has their own reality . 
  you have your own reality . 
  human behaviour is hard . 
  so ... let 's vote libertarian party ? 
  well , we belong to mediterranean culture , so unfotunately we are less serious people than north-europeans , but switzerland , from all the states in the world , is definetely a good example . 
  and comunidad de madrid , they created their own autonomous community because it was better for their interests of being the capital . 
  but they are also castille . 
  the best political system is basically direct democracy , and is called * market * . 
  every time you buy something or you go somewhere you 're voting . 
  however , for some decisions referendums are not that bad , being better than indirect democracy , which is useful mainly for minor issues where people do n't think they need to get involved . 
  people have misinformation and emotional appeals , but elected representatives have misinformation and emotional appeals too , plus , personal interests and power , which can be even worse than misinformation only ( if you do n't know something , then the outcome is going to be by pure chance , but if the decision depends on other person , your outcome will depend on the interests of that other person ) .
