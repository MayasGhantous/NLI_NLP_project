  you criticize brexit because you do n't like it , but a majority of english people thinks it 's better for them . 
  you can consider them stupid , but they have the right to fail or succeed . 
  and right now the uk is not much worse than 1 year ago , even if people some way is dreaming about it . 
  failing in life is the only way i know of progress . 
  ever tried.ever failed.no matter.try again.fail again.fail better . 
  as far as i know , first , i would say canary islands are overpopulated , and second , developing any kind of industry beside tourism is hard for them since they are far away from europe and bigger markets , their neighbour territories are western sahara and morocco . 
  well , you have the right to take your on choices ;d . 
  i wonder that too , there is only one way to know the answer xd . 
  the reason why spain is so stubborn in not allowing a referendum is because catalonia is extremely valuable , but this value is not only economical , cultural too , since we are the most liberal and progressive society of spain ( imo ) . 
  if we gain our independence , spain will have to rethink what they are and what they want . 
  spain it 's something like a string which is in equilibrium because there are two forces pulling right and left . 
  catalonia is somehow a very important part of the left side ( the right side is leaded by madrid and a more conservative vision ) , and if we quit , spain will lose their equilibrium , as we ( catalonia ) will have already found ours . 
  i would like to highlight another issue people does not consider in this discussion spain/catalonia , and is that 1.5 millions of spaniards are living and working in catalonia ( and they are catalan citizens , who can vote and enjoy the same rights and obligations as any catalan born ) . 
  furthermore , this number could get raise to 2 million if we consider floating population . 
  what i mean with this is , every decision to harm catalonia affects also to this 1.5-2 million spaniards . 
  if spain tries to push catalonia economically , spain goes partially down too , and spain does n't has a market to assume 2 million ( more ) of unemployed people . 
  i am pro-independence , and i 'm aware of the difficulties of having not only spain against us , but also barely no support from eu states , but the economical and labor connection between both countries is very deep . 
  in the case of height is true though . 
   when it comes to finding ways to weaken europe , the russians have a history of being rather effective . 
  i see what you are trying to say , but if they are so effective why numbers do n't show up ? . 
  eu is better than russia in almost every aspect . 
  we just double the gdp per capita ( russia = 15.000 $ , eu = 30.000 $ ) , free of movement and capitals are just making us better , ex-ussr nations are now happier and prosperous in ue ( estonia , lithuania ... ) , we have a better scientific network ( attracting many russians citizens ) , the european space agency is improving step by step , we are reducing our energetic dependence , etc. 
  i do n't know whats the idea of russian government , but life gives you continuous punches in the face , if russian government thinks that the separatists movements of catalans , scots or basques are gon na help to destabilize europe maybe they get just the opposite result . 
  we know where we stand , we can criticized europe for many things , but we do it just because we want a better europe and a better eu . 
  i 've never heard nothing about russian government supporting catalan independence whatsoever . 
  we 've been doing many conferences to explain our situation and goals in many countries , mainly to everybody who is interested in listen our voice . 
  recently [ diplocat ] ( http://www.diplocat.cat/en/activities ) ( organism created for this purpose ) has participated in conferences in [ italy ] ( http://www.diplocat.cat/en/catalan-issues/debates-about-catalonia/997-naples-italy-debate-on-catalonia-in-naples ) , [ sweden ] ( http://www.diplocat.cat/en/activities/awareness/conferences/1013-gotland-sweden-the-european-institutions-in-sweden-organise-a-debate-on-the-catalan-case ) , [ denmark ] ( http://www.diplocat.cat/en/activities/awareness/conferences/1003-catalonia-participates-for-the-first-time-in-denmark-s-main-politics-festival ) , [ england ] ( http://www.diplocat.cat/en/catalan-issues/debates-about-catalonia/984-london-united-kingdom-puigdemont-explains-catalonia-s-roadmap-towards-independence-to-the-international-audience-at-chatham-house ) and many parts of spain ( mainly universities ) . 
  and this does n't mean all of this countries support us ( i wish xd ) . 
  if russia invites us , we should be grateful for the opportunity and we should go to explain them how things are and our vision , since international relationships are important . 
  but that 's it . 
  last time i voted [ erc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republican_left_of_catalonia ) , and i would do it again , so greens-efa, 
  i 'm pretty sure there are some lobbies with interests in creating an atmosphere of excessive uncertainty so they can take profit from the situation . 
  uk is a good place to invest in or outside the eu . 
  the best cap is no cap . 
  money could be use to other things , and at the same time that would be the best thing we can do to help africa . 
  switzerland ( 29 ) - austria ( 17 ) is a good t\u00e1ndem , but far from the tandem catalonia ( 30 ) - andorra ( 54 ), 
  it 's easier in cities to get citizenship ? . 
  anyway , there is some book where all of this is explained ? , i mean how switzerland works in general ? , or a good book of history of switzerland ? . 
  i believe none of us have english as preferred language , so misunderstanding is likely ( no worries , it also happens to me constantly ) . 
  but just read again the quotation you put , i did never stated that * everybody wants to make us spanish * , rather than give an opinion/personal appreciation that it * seems like in spain everybody wants ... * , because you 're right and i know there are parties more respectful with our identity , not everybody is pp-c 's - psoe . 
  about hispania , yes , that 's what im saying , roman empire was 2000 years ago . 
  today hispanic has a total different meaning :d . 
   the nationalistic propaganda is getting ridiculous . 
  that 's exactly what im saying , seems like in spain everybody wants to make us spanish and that we must accept hispania because we are hispanic , and i 'm just telling you that i do n't feel hispanic and many catalans neither . 
  i 'm not telling you what all the citizens of catalonia opinion is . 
  because it strongly depends on cultural background and other conditions , and because each individual takes their own decisions . 
  yup , 2000 years ago . 
  today hispania = spanish = castillian . 
  no need to say sorry , there is no bubble . 
  i 'm speaking about an individual issue based on cultural identification , of course everyone ( me included ) , speaks spanish in catalonia , but that does n't mean i am hispanic or that i considere myself as spanish ( however what certainly i am is an spanish citizen ) . 
  the same way that if i speak english that does n't make me english . 
  and as i said , people that considers themselves as catalan ( not catalan and spanish ) , do n't consider themselves as hispanic . 
  does n't matter how many languages do i speak . 
  better not . 
  catalans are not hispanics , basques are not hispanics , portuguese , galicians ... , we are all from the iberian peninsula , but not hispanics , especially since the term * hispania/hispanos * refers to spanish as the main language . 
  i guess they just want to conquer portugal and iberia/iberian federation seems friendly , but it 's a trojan horse , run guys , it 's a trap !, 
  do n't worry , we will respect your selfdetermination right ;d, 
  i would like to speak with the merkelreich in order to exchange aragon for north catalonia , we can not leave our friends of perpignan and cia in the hands of tyranny lol . 
  we can make a push to the west so you can join the catalan empire and we create * the euskal-catalan confederation * lol, 
  you can always send extra-population to portugal and spain . 
  they will be welcome . 
  in southern europe that 's the weird thing . 
  most young people do n't have constants jobs , and even the ones who have one and can afford to pay a rent , is smarter for them to keep living with their parents while they save money for their pensions , since pensions for people aged now at their 20 's -30 's is at serious risk . 
  check the differences of the pyramid population for spain and norway in 2046 : https://s32.postimg.org/rinqu8eut/sense_t_tol.jpg, 
  in southern europe we have quite a serious issue . 
  portugal is the outsider in western europe . 
  congrats for that and for the eurocup . 
  finally hard work shows up . 
  lol, 
  i do n't know from what year is the paper , because it is too small to see it . 
  but seems it says `` la vanguardia espa\u00f1ola '' , here you have the info about this media from the own website of the [ grupo godo ] ( http://www.grupogodo.net/institucional/historia/index.html ) :  con la victoria del bando franquista , la propiedad recuper\u00f3 el control financiero del diario , pero , ** a causa de la censura , no pod\u00eda influir en la l\u00ednea editorial . 
  english versi\u00f3n in bold :  because of censorship , owners could n't influence in the editorial line . 
  the newspaper was forced to change its historical header by ` la vanguardia espa\u00f1ola ' . 
  it was then when general franco imposed as director luis de galinsoga , who crashed with the catalan reality and even publicly declared himself as enemy of catalonia and all that was catalan , this [ for the newspaper ] was one of its most difficult moments . 
  so pretty much propaganda , and even today the grupo godo is in my opini\u00f3n kind of garbage . 
  i ca n't barely read nothing ( beside the title ) to verify if it 's purely franco 's regime propaganda . 
  if media today is manipulated imagine at that time . 
  no , it is absolutely true . 
  if your neighbor is a rich country more chances you can have better economy , is n't it ? . 
  what i do n't want is to be part of the same government . 
  but i want the best economic situation for spain and france , and also for mediterranean area ( either mediterranean europe or mediterranean africa ) . 
  certainly i agree 30 % is not definitive whatsoever , another facts should be analyzed , in example , if you are in 30 % of habitual language but your tendency is going to 40 % then it 's not that bad , because the language is growing . 
  but that is not the case of catalan today , we went from 46 % to 36 % , is a good approximation that things are not going very well for us . 
  the extinction process is clear : first the cities , then rural areas . 
  and contrary to what you said , i can notice thing are not going well just by stopping at a random bar . 
  catalan wo n't dissapear in 50 years , but we are in a crossroads , and what we do today , will define the future . 
  there is no second language in schools ( well , english , german or french ) , but spain and catalan are both studied as first . 
  everybody knows spanish in catalonia , but not everybody knows catalan . 
  about the money i have put it also as a motivation . 
  i do n't hide that part , but actually is not the most relevant , economically we want the best for spain since having strong neighbors is key to economical success . 
  than basque yes , than galician i 'm not sure . 
  i do n't see the absolute numbers you suggest , but anyway , absolute numbers of knowledge does n't represent well the health of a language . 
  and much less what politicians said to gain votes , cdc said that to keep collecting votes . 
  the measure used is percentage of habitual use ( if people speak it or not ) , and today is 36 % . 
  it is well said in academia that once you cross under 30 % , language is hardly recoverable , and we are getting closer . 
  about irish gaelic , unfortunately it is not growing because it is already in extinguish stage . 
  exactly the thing we want to avoid . 
  actually , i believe irish gain their independence when gaelic was almost in extinguish stage . 
  you are free to accuse me of lying , but at least show proofs of my lie . 
  use of catalan is reducing : * 2003 : 46 % habitual language * 2008 : 35 % habitual language * 2013 : 36 % habitual language here you have the data : http://www.idescat.cat/economia/inec?tc=3&amp;id=da01&amp;dt=201300&amp;x=15&amp;y=10&amp;lang=en,
