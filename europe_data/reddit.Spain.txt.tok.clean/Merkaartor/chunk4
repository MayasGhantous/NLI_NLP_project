  if you can construct a country similar to switzerland , we would n't seek independence , or it would be extremely low . 
  but the spanish state has historically followed , and still follows , a french model , trying to unify everyhting , including language . 
  today pp ( peoples party ) and ciudadanos , both right-wing parties , are the ones being more aggressive with the rest of cultures of spain , but also psoe , in a more paternalist way . 
  and about rural/urban , still disagree with you . 
  urban areas as girona and lleida are independentists . 
  in my opinion the strongest factor is cultural background . 
  another example is hispanic immigration ( from south america ) , which also is mainly against independence . 
  well , it 's kind of logical since the metropolitan area is where the big part of spanish inmigration lives ( [ 1.4 millions ] ( http://www.idescat.cat/pub/?id=pmh&amp;n=674&amp;by=prov&amp;lang=en ) ) . 
  if they are spanish and they do n't speak catalan or do n't feel part of catalan culture it 's hard to vote for independence . 
  however there are spanish people and also spanish/castillian associations supporting independence , such as [ sumate ] ( http://www.sumate.cat/ ) . 
  in some big cities , because of the reduction of living spaces , its getting more common . 
  scotland and catalonia part of the ultra right wing nationalist ? , are you serious ? . 
  and if europe gets divided who cares . 
  finally spanish justice allows waving estelades , decision which was quite absurd . 
  such a shame , the image of scotish flags was great lol . 
  there is n't such a thing as many times for braveheart . 
  your way of learning is interesting , i never mentioned any of what you say . 
  i said that both territories have regional governments and that they could perfectly make a declaration against any kind of violent conflict even if is spain the one involved . 
  those regional governments do not always agree with the spanish one , e.g. , catalan one is trying to achieve independence and the basque one is collaborating in the disarmament of eta . 
  and the spanish one is not helping or agrees with none of the previous . 
  also catalonia and basque country population would be neutral ( maybe even their governments ) and would defend the desire of gibraltar people , which is overwhelming british . 
  that 's something uk could take advantage of too . 
  languages are not exclusive . 
  you can speak irish and english at the same time . 
  we ^ a have to figure out how we can save our languages . 
  if we have respected ( and even learned ) others languages , others should respect our languages too . 
  ^ a small-medium linguistic groups, 
  since you have 15 cousins that makes 15 potential couples , so i would say 1/15 . 
  of course in your case ( like more or less mine ) most of you still have time to reproduce , so the rate is luckily not definite , or we would be facing extinction . 
  this is my family tree evolution : * 1900-1940 . 
  grandparents generation . 
  2 couples , 11 children . 
  then 11/2 = 5.5 * 1940-1980 . 
  aunts/parents generation . 
  11 couples , 16 children . 
  then 16/11 = 1.45 * 1980-2017 . 
  16 couples , 7 children . 
  then 7/16 = 0.43 ^ 1 this generation is at their twenties ( except some who are at 40 's ) . 
  so it 's not the final number whatsoever . 
  i think the final figure will be 16 or 18 children . 
  i agree , but imagine you are a teacher and you have two options : being teacher in a middle-class district school or being teacher in a low-class district school . 
  if your salary depends on results it would always be preferable too teach in the middle-class district , since statistically they usually have higher results . 
  you must consider then also sociodemographic characteristics . 
  it is a great challenge to achieve small progress on low-class districts . 
   let 's focus on my ulterior motives . 
  it 's you who focus this thread as ** your opinion ** , editorializing ** twice ** the tittle . 
  first adding the word xenophobia and second putting * generalitat de catalunya * instead of * plataforma per la llengua * . 
  what 's your side ? . 
  well , as far as i know the side of those who come to reddit and open an editorialized thread to call xenophobes to the people that gives value to receiving a service in their preferred language . 
  like many people does , e.g. , i work with germans and they come to the business because they know we speak german . 
  germans value the fact of being attended in german and we try to give the best service we can for our private interests . 
  i would say the only xenophobe i see here is you . 
  a person who chase others for the language they speak and who tries to damage the catalans image . 
  i guess you are one of the thousands who are just downloading the app for boycotting purposes and to compare catalanspeakers as [ nazis ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ql5tlvr.png ) . 
   why is catalonia the only region without an own electoral law ? 
  because the different parties of the parliament ( composed by something else beside ex-ciu ) had never reached an agreement , and the * de facto * system is not that bad . 
  i do n't see it as a big deal . 
   but barcelona is not as much nationalist as les comarques ... is noticeable that the millions of spanish immigrants and their descendants , in general , do not want to participate in a catalan axis project , and follow rather their spanish origins feeling part of what they feel as their state ( the spanish state ) . 
  which i think is the expected behavior . 
  but they can be as much or as less nationalist as anyone who thinks in catalan political and cultural terms . 
  what they are not is as much as structured , because they do n't have the necessity . 
   i 'm sure you should n't worry for us . 
  if spain is not a unity of destiny in the universal , catalonia is neither . 
  i do worry about everyone and anyone at the same time . 
  what matters is the people and the culture , once catalan culture extinguish ( and we follow that trend ) the xy coordinates will be just history . 
  but we , as the spaniards , deserve an own state , and we should pursue that goal while we can . 
  that state must be an state that protects our language and culture , but that allows the coexistence between all individuals . 
  i 'm sure it can be a good living space for spaniards too . 
  we can try it , if not we can do a referendum to just go back . 
  first , do n't worry , in a referendum 1 vote = 1 person . 
  and second , the nowadays electoral system ^ a is quite correct . 
  it was done seeking proportionality . 
  it uses 4 electoral districts ^ b and the [ d'hondt method ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d%27hondt_method ) to allocate mp 's . 
  the aim is to find a balance between number of population and population distribution . 
  i do n't think the system can be call it unfair , could be better or could be worst , but is quite fair to my eyes . 
  catalonia is a country of 32.000 km ^ 2 , barcelona and their metropolitan area is not whole catalonia . 
  what is true is that in an eventual republic of catalonia , barcelona may need an special formula to better compete against other big cities . 
  ^ a as you said , the same one as the spanish . 
  but is a well established system , similar to others from mature democratic countries . 
  ^ b each of this 4 districts ( representing the 4 provinces of catalonia : barcelona , girona , lleida and tarragona ) has a concrete number of mp 's , which is assigned depending on the population of each district . 
  as long as you have a pure heart and a clean mind , just say the [ name ] ( http://images.mmosite.com/my/upload/9a/22/littleshine/09/1126/2009112612029_200.jpg ), 
  at least it 's not raining , could be worst . 
  does it has a name ? , mozilla sounds accurate imo . 
  this is a typical catalan song dedicated to the virgin of montserrat , call it [ virolai ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-fkh3muqwy ), 
  i see , but it 's not the same, 
  * indeed we 're totally oppressed , how dare you say otherwise !!!!, 
  i would say the most extended one is '' * catalonia new state of europe * '' , not * eu * . 
  and it 's simply because catalans do not have the power to join eu or not , even if we want it deeply . 
  eu is a private club and their members should accept us first . 
  what is obvious is that europe is our natural space and we must work to make sure that peace , trade and cooperation are our fundamental principles . 
  in or outside of the eu . 
  if we can not join eu , there are other ways of establishing relations with our european pals . 
  all times are troubled times when you do n't want something to happen . 
   they chanted long live catalonia and long live spain while marching the correct form is * live long and prosper !, 
  i did n't said so . 
  all credit in general terms are for the basque society and basque culture . 
   with great power comes great responsibility so better divide the power and reduce responsibilities, 
  basque country is the ( today ) spanish territory with better scores in almost everything . 
  and they might do it even better as an independent state . 
  the main quality that gives mean to states today is the monopoly of violence .
