  let 's abolish all states, 
  this just magnifies the trend of division . 
  for people who defend independence , as it 's my case , this decisions just reinforce my desire of an independent catalonia . 
  there is no room for catalans in spain , and the space we once had is becoming smaller every day . 
  i wish it too, 
  oh , those good caliphate days ! , when the south was prosperous and madrid did not exist ! . 
  basque country is basically the capital of europe . 
  the rest of countries seen on the map are just their metropolitan area . 
  the year he arrived to the knicks from glorious latvia is now known as [ * the year of our lord * ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a3wwyyk.jpge ) . 
  the things is that the maximum limit of dialogue for spain ( no referendum ) it stops just right before the minimum limit of dialogue for catalonia ( do a referendum ) . 
  not much room for dialogue there . 
  i 'm not against spanish citizens giving their opinion about catalonia or basque country in a referendum . 
  actually i would be interest in doing such an exercise . 
  anyway , considering the indirect data we have ( general election ) , at least 70 % of people voted no-referendum parties . 
  i do not think so . 
  adding something that people always forget : selfgovernment and more power on local decisions . 
  those fc barcelona hooligans !, 
  ! , if i find those bricks i swear will paint it with the color of the real team , the knicks and the great kristaps !, 
   it is not a nation . 
  what is a nation for you ? . 
  what are the key concepts that you would say it define a nation ? 
  mediterraneans countries stronk ! . 
  definitely . 
  anyway , austria still can not beat norway . 
  which is not on the map , but their hydroelectric production is close to 100 % of total electric production . 
  edit : graph at this [ website ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/visualizations/electricity-production/#country=at:be:dk:fr:de:no ), 
  video of the [ cave ] ( https://vimeo.com/85361441 ) :, 
  that must be a rally stage . 
  keep up the good work . 
  the phrase was just a meme from furutama . 
  also more than 4000 tortures had been identified in the [ basque country ] ( https://translate.google.es/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ca&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fctxt.es%2fes%2f20160706%2fpolitica%2f7024%2fgobierno-vasco-francisco-etxeberria-tortura-policia-nacional-guardia-civil.htm&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) between 1960 and 2013 , and the perpetrators of things like this :  miren azkarate was 18 when the guardia civil detained her . 
  four days with a mask in her eyes , naked , not eating and surrounded by guards who shouted at her . 
  one of them forced her to masturbate . 
  they practiced the bag until she almost drowned . 
  with hardly a breath she heard that they said `` we have gone too far , call an ambulance '' and she thought she would die . 
  she wanted it . 
  in the dungeons they placed a pistol in her hands . 
  she raised it to her temple , aimed and fired . 
  the charger was empty . 
  are not only on streets ( without punishment at all ) , that even probably are living upon public funds . 
  i do n't agree with this rapper but justice seems to not be very impartial . 
  spanish justice is bad and they should feel bad . 
  now seriously , is pathetic , 3.5 years for a song . 
   this is not what has happened . 
  productivity from land has probably increased throughout the last 200 years while rural populations have decreased throughout the same period . 
  why will that change ? 
  hard to argue the rural flight , because is a clear fact . 
  but people goes to cities because their life expectations there are better than staying on the countryside . 
  if you can make more productive rural areas ( robotic automation ) , send better quality jobs ( linked to automation ) and more self-sufficient communities ( renewables and less oil dependent machinery ) , people will be willing to live there . 
  of course they will still be small populous areas , but robotization offers better life expectation . 
  spain has always had high [ unemployment rates ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/es/timeline/2464dde3b88815004c77478d444f67a8.png ) . 
  it 's not because of the euro , probably more about culture . 
  i guess the last time spain had something similar to full employment levels was with franco 's regime , and i 'm not trusting that data . 
  not more than if there was 0 economic productivity . 
  if you make rural areas productive there will always be people willing to live and work .

  * napolitana de xocolata * , with italian accent . 
  both flags are beautiful . 
  to be fair , is not only done by independentist . 
  countries whose people gained independence in the past also use it to reinforce their image as a sovereign state , even using sports , music ... for it . 
  at the end it depends on their parents . 
  if you go to a peaceful demonstration probably your children are gon na come with you . 
  and eventually they will ask you for a flag . 
  at the end the children receives their parents education . 
  the photos you attached are not worst than watching a football game between france and germany , or distinguishing athletes by their nationality . 
   you can only get rid of it by destroying and burning affected trees . 
  yep . 
  that 's the protocol right now . 
  absolutely . 
  i saw both maps , but it seemed for me that the one i attached was more detailed ( croatia is represented but since it 's in the coast is not easy to distinguish the green with the black of the coast line ) . 
  anyway both are good to have a general idea :d . 
  also a map of the [ olive tree ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/olive_niche.jpg ) distribution from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olive ) . 
  lets hope it does not get spread to the peninsula . 
  oil and olives are a must in my daily life . 
  ask s\u00e9bastien loeb . 
  no one can drive better than him . 
  the mentioned bacteria is [ xylella fastidiosa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/xylella_fastidiosa ), 
   more aggressive numerically superior nation , darwinism in reality . 
  check your negative karma . 
  welcome to the [ wild side ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wnkngikkoa ) . 
  i think of more as if they adapted in order to spread their culture through other territories . 
  but i would say castile identity is still strong in historical castillian territories.im not from there , of course , it 's just my perception . 
  sure . 
  sorry then , i just meant that in andalusia they have strong castillian roots . 
  many conversations at the same time :d . 
  what comes to your mind when i said hispanic culture ? . 
  to cristian and to a common language . 
  do n't take this as an attack , but you come from somewhere , you have roots as anyone else . 
  i do n't talk about kingdoms or crowns , i talk about culture and language . 
  i 'm just saying is a product . 
  i understand concepts are not flat . 
  or catalans are valencians . 
  actually i 'm not sure which name existed first , but anyone who is willing to contemplate will see connections . 
  what do you think is a * paella * ? , or a * falla * ? . 
  you are taking this discussion totally wrong . 
  edit . 
  paella in catalan is * sarten * ( spanish ) or * pan * ( english ) . 
  because is where is cooked . 
  and falla is like a * fire * ( english ) or * foga\u00f1a * ( spanish ) . 
  are not they product of castilian culture ? .
