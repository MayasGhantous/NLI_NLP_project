  are not andalusians castilians that expulsed muslims and settled there ? . 
  you can ridicule the argument with stereotypes , but the cultural root is the same with different branches . 
  kinda like [ mr. burns ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/ff/9e/b4/ff9eb4fb9692b93e41b48e6f9ed5479b.jpg ) . 
  no way to get out of here !, 
  because now people call it spain or hispanic culture . 
  i bought just one , but with a 40 years mortgage , what a bargain !, 
  good old days are back again !, 
  i did a research , here you got the [ results ] ( http://ep00.epimg.net/elpais/imagenes/2014/01/08/gastronotas_de_capel/1389217173_138921_1389217173_noticia_normal.jpg ), 
  the basque is even more unacceptable than the catalan . 
  is probably one of the oldest cultures of europe , some people even argue that the language could be an heritage of hunter-gatherers that lived in that region thousands years ago . 
  and still , spain does n't have the dignity of respecting their self determination right . 
  hey , the title is an obvious * [ cat-signal ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-alypet0vk8k/u1ph8nnftqi/aaaaaaaacyq/og31gqtnsck/s1600/batman-cityscapes-dc-comics-batman-logo-fresh-new-hd-wallpaper-.jpg ) * . 
  do n't blame us . 
  mallorca is more german , menorca is more english ( or british ) , formentera is more italian , cabrera is more ecologist and eivissa is of anyone who likes cocaine . 
  true , perpignan is not as beautiful as strasbourg , but it is probably true that is the most catalan of french cities . 
  which is what the other post are about . 
  we are outnumbered . 
  hard to compete xd . 
  the biggest one for sure . 
  in catalan speaking countries ( or basque country ) it would be : so you are spanish ? 
  germans are strong . 
  if they took it seriously are hard to stop . 
  quite good , the only ` but ' that i found is the voice of the narrator , it 's not very trump . 
  i did n't know about the existence of this bridges . 
  i 'm happy you all share photos , this information is always welcome . 
  living is tiring . 
  i 'm not sure if that 's the reason , to be honest . 
  i agree with part of your comment . 
  but it would have to be seen what is the capacity of popular mobilization by unionists . 
  i just said that saying that most of this [ people ] ( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/imatges.vilaweb.cat/nacional/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/img_4147-768x512.jpg ) are councilors is risky , if not an strange affirmation . 
  edit : i just checked how many councilors ( by councilors i considered * regidors * and * batles * ) there are in catalonia , and i got a number around 9.000 , not 50.000 , source [ 1 ] ( http://www.idescat.cat/pub/?id=aec&amp;n=918 ) and [ 2 ] ( http://www.bcn.cat/estadistica/catala/dades/telec/loc/loc15/cloc1108.htm ) . 
   which is ( probably ) what the separatists are trying . 
  what we are trying is independence , there have been a lot of tries to make a referendum with the agreement of the spanish government , but is something they do not consider and will not consider . 
  then , the only alternative way is an udi , which is the most common method for this purposes . 
  but we do not seek any concrete reaction from the spanish government , and much less any violent reaction . 
  that is totally up to the spanish government and we do not have a control on it , although of course , we assume certain reactions from spain . 
  as we should assume too , objective difficulties for achiving our goal . 
  at the end we just want the tools and institutions for our self governance , to give a better position to our culture in terms of survival and to create an state thought for the ideas , needs and desires of the citizens . 
   most of those people were actually councilors if a had to put my money on , i would say most of them were not councilors instead of normal citizens . 
  edit : spelling, 
  not easy , but miss belgium seems the most beautiful . 
  well , the pyrenees are extended also through aragon . 
  you will always have a piece :d . 
  that sounds like rally pacenotes to me . 
  submitting one by one would be more productive , 63 is like an overdose xd . 
  i can understand it , he is * meme-prone * . 
  people i 've known from uk complained about the weather , but not about temperature rather than excess of rainy days and lack of sunny ones . 
  like if was too grey throughout the year . 
  each land has its pros and cons , i guess xd . 
   why does spain have so many ? 
  [ autonomous communities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/autonomous_communities_of_spain ), 
  triple green for estonia . 
  good job . 
  vilaweb is a pro-independence media , it has interesting articles from time to time , which are worth of reading , but also many times is very [ optimistic ] ( http://data.whicdn.com/images/58521048/superthumb.jpg ) . 
  any way , a 79 % is possible ? , yes . 
  it all depends on the turnout . 
  with a 63 % turnout would independence win ? , i believe so , with a 79 % for the yes , i 'm quite skeptical about it . 
  edit : spelling, 
  i agree with you , when somebody asks me about it i just make an easy explanation : valencian is catalan with castillian accent and the catalan from balearic islands ( each island has small differences ) is catalan with more french accent . 
  thanks . 
  i thought it followed another type of logic . 
  still , i think is more natural from higher to lower . 
  if you follow an order from higher % rate to lower % rate . 
  i think is better to put afd after the spd and not at the end . 
  i understand you want to present a counterpart , that 's fine , but i think you 're a little mean in your manners . 
  is not that mallorcan nationalism needs ecologist votes , in any case , they get the votes because nationalism in mallorca ^ 1 has always been very committed to natural protection . 
  from the defense of the beaches against massification , to the defense of our water reservoirs which are contaminated due to salinity in the coast or chemicals elements ( nitrates ... ) in the center . 
  the main ecologist group is the [ gob ] ( http://www.gobmallorca.com/ ) ( an ornitologist group in origin ) , which also has a clear position in the defense of our language and culture . 
  and also the main ecologist motto in mallorca is in catalan : '' * qui estima la terra no la destrueix * '' , which translated is '' * who loves the land does not destroy it * '' . 
  ^ 1 the left movement , which is the big majority . 
  the right movement , well ... 
  i must remember our 9 seats out of 59 in the parliament :d . we still a minority , but not that bad . 
  actually a better ratio than the galician one . 
   because of tourism and overall mentality . 
  i would say is more a mix between prominence of conservative mentality and immigration ( which is just not connected with catalan culture ) . 
  you are right , although the pro-catalan movement is based on the sovereignty of each territory , so in the case of mallorca is just a mallorcan matter . 
  anyway independence is a very secondary goal for the pro-catalan parties in mallorca . 
  the main agenda is a better fiscal agreement ( similar situation to catalonia ) , promotion of catalan and ecological targets ( since the main pro-catalan party is also the green party ) . 
  that 's quite small . 
  navarra or mallorca are more pro-independence than bavaria then . 
  today i learned . 
  yep , i would say is the best alternative to arcgis , you also have an spanish one , such as gvsig and also grass which are both good options , but i think qgis is the best one , i have no complains about stability . 
  really beautiful . 
   however , in the absence of a similar clause in spain 's constitution i fail to see what is the legal rationale for catalonia to become an independent state . 
  you are right . 
  from the standpoint of spanish law there is not legal rationale . 
  the independence of catalonia is simply illegal . 
  the only way is unilateral independence . 
  nope , i did it just for curiosity . 
  i have used opensource software , ** calc ** for statistics ( spreadsheet from libreoficce ) and ** qgis ** for maps ( nice gis software ) . 
  if you want the spreadsheets i can send it to you , it 's just data from idescat . 
  but it would not be rigorous and correct since the catalan government explained it was just a popular participation , with no legal consequences . 
  at the end of this year we expect a referendum , and this time catalan government is supposed to notify to everyone that it will be binding . 
  there are already territories in catalonia with self-determination right , such as la [ val d'aran ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/val_d'aran ) . 
  of course val d'aran has some particularities , such as an own language and culture different to the catalan one . 
  and since they have their own national product the catalan government recognized their self-determination right . 
  a random territory in catalonia does n't have it . 
   the catalan parliament approved on wednesday the law on the val d\u2019aran 's special status within catalonia , recognising its `` occitan national reality '' and ** its right to self-determination ** . 
  this small pyrenean valley , surrounded by high peaks and located in catalonia 's north-western corner , is the last land where the occitan language is widely spoken , although it is called aranese there . 
  then do n't give the money , just explain you do n't give money to separatist and done .
