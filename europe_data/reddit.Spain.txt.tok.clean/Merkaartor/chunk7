  but since catalans pay for being part of spain is logical they ask for a certain budget to pay the catalan public services . 
  they arrived from other place , did n't speak the local language , did n't have any property , house or job . 
  many of them had 0 connections , maybe some had a friend or a relative . 
  but even at that time they knew they were immigrants , i do n't know why it 's always a surprise . 
  and that 's why i said that being immigrant is nothing bad , because many people do n't like it as we normally connect immigrant with something undesirable . 
  yes , as an spaniard in germany . 
  being immigrant is nothing bad , i 'm very proud about my parents moving so they could give me a better life . 
  i see your point of view . 
  but it would not sound fair to me a majority as not enough . 
  i know it 's not political correct , but catalonia has a 36 % of immigration : 1.4 million of spaniards and 1.3 millions of other nationalities . 
  the correlation ( pearson ) between independence and immigration is strong enough -0.6 ( using data from the elections of the 27s and official census data ) , and if we do a simple regression model it reinforces the relation ( [ independence-catalan born ] ( http://imgur.com/j3zqkaj ) , [ independence-not catalan born ] ( http://imgur.com/oybprcc ) ) . 
  also if we do a quick [ map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4icazhj.png ) we see that municipalities where no wins tend to be the ones with more immigration , which is mainly settle on the coast . 
  that 's a significant disadvantage we have , because it 's not easy to convince spaniards and hispanics ( ecuador , colombia , argentina ... ) of being part of a catalan state . 
  so i think 50 % it 's not asking too much . 
  anyway , i do n't know why one more state in the world or in europe is always so controversial ( maybe i can imagine why ) . 
  but we just want a sovereign state with a positive discrimination to the catalan culture , just as many other cultures have in the world . 
  all figures and maps are mine . 
  if you want the calc sheets just ask for it . 
  edit : map information , green more than 50 % in favor of independence , red less than 50 % in favor of independence . 
  and the bigger the circle the bigger the immigration rate . 
  probably one of the healthiest pyramids of europe . 
  an opinion one . 
  it 's a quite normal type of article in journalism . 
  of course , you can agree or not . 
   also if i remember correctly this guy threatened to break someone 's balls or something around those lines he threatened to break the eggs from a random chicken , in catalan : '' * per fer una truita s ` han de trencar els ous . * '' . 
  which translated into english is something like : '' * to make an omelet you must crack some eggs * '' . 
  this sentence was a comment to explain that if we want independence we are gon na have to disobey spanish law at some point , because spanish government has been very clear about a legal referendum . 
  joan coma simply was coherent disobeying spanish law for summoned him for a simple political comment , which for the record was denounced by josep anglada , a famous far-right figure . 
  so police arrested him , he testified , the court took him the passport and we keep trying to go on . 
  if [ uk ] ( https://populationpyramid.net/united-kingdom/2030/ ) will be older just wait and see countries such as [ spain ] ( https://populationpyramid.net/spain/2030/ ) , [ greece ] ( https://populationpyramid.net/greece/2030/ ) or [ portugal ] ( https://populationpyramid.net/portugal/2030/ ) . 
  you are gon na love it . 
   ive read a british study that the move from bottled pills to pills in blisters only significally lowered the suicide by pill rate interesting . 
  never thought about it . 
  done :d . 
  not sure , but if we consider the comment of goheeca :  more like i can see a quite positive correlation with the average english proficiency in given countries . 
  it really does n't say nothing good about greece , spain and italy . 
  3 of the most visited and touristic countries of europe could be the worst in english pro-efficiency . 
   human perception is generally trash . 
  correct . 
  i maintain my words though . 
   let 's just be glad it did n't actually blow up . 
  absolutely . 
  things are going too far . 
  the crowd singing the catalan anthem : http://www.ccma.cat/324/carme-forcadell-declara-avui-davant-del-tsjc/noticia/2763937/, 
  t r o l l, 
  honestly , i would prefer to stay at the same time zone as germany . 
  we would be the new canary islands , but i 'm not sure if that option is on the table . 
  we can make it better . 
  i swear . 
  what about a [ castell ] ( http://enoslowtravel.viatgesindic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/castellers032.jpg ) with a `` caganer '' at the top ? 
  we are between spain and france , we ai n't having a lucky life xd . 
  still , surprisingly somehow catalans still exist and we still try . 
  the guy is really close to the edge . 
  good bye . 
  you need a prescription , that 's true , but i have seen exceptions just like yours a few times , most of the times were people who knew the employee of the pharmacy and they managed to get some ardine , the weakest version i believe . 
  but it 's not that unusual . 
   i take antibiotics as a preventative measure . 
  in catalonia ( and spain in general ) this is a normal practice too . 
  they just want to clean their hands in case of possible infection . 
   that failure of country yep , cause spain is a success of country . 
  not for the catalans , i would say xd . 
  also recently , in 2014 , it was created a new anthem inspired in the beautiful latvian song : * [ saule , p\u0113rkons , daugava ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weovgfneesk ) * call it * [ ara \u00e9s l'hora ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzlzcqmouhy ) * . 
  so all in all there are 3 anthems narrating different things for the catalans : * ** els segadors ** - about the violent response of the catalan farmers against the spanish monarchy because of several grievances to catalans ( killing of farmers , burn of houses , massive raping , stole of food ... ) * ** cant de la senyera ** : speaking just about the flag and their concept for unite catalan people . 
  * ** ara \u00e9s l'hora ** : speaking about the catalan people , their individual hope and dreams , and the need of persistence . 
  the best version ( old version ) of * els segadors * ever done is this [ one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4pw0pq5epi ) . 
  they also cultivate [ potatoes ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/greenland-reaps-benefits-of-global-warming-8555241.html#gallery ) . 
  he was awarded with two ears and the tail from the bullfighter for the performance . 
  consequences are not set yet , it will strongly depend on spain behavior and on their political decisions . 
  and most of them could be temporary . 
  well , if catalonia gains independence that would be almost correct . 
  barcelona and their metropolitan area has almost 4 millions inhabitants , that is almost the 60 % of the population of catalonia . 
  barcelona would be the leader of their own state , it would set their rules and cities like madrid would no longer be a chain . 
  once you are into subtile ethnic comments , how would you call that map , spanish colonization of catalonia ? 
  24gb , lol . 
  from an ethnic perspective yes , you can be ethnically catalan and feel nationally spaniard . 
  from a catalan national perspective is what i said , because just the word nation have strong political connotations . 
  and the catalan national day is just what the word says , a catalan national day . 
  of course you can make the interpretation you want , i have been very clear and i would say objective . 
  and i do n't hide my political position at all . 
   this incident will be reported ^ to ^ the ^ spanish ^ government  [ nooo !, 
   they use the day of all the catalans ( independentists or not ) as a platform for their ideology , stealing the day of the catalans for a their shitty political agenda . 
  being catalan is not an administrative name representing some random x , y coordinates , is a name representing a national group , and the ultimate goal of a nation and a national group is their political sovereignty . 
  the catalans do not exist for showing how well they do castells , not even to be an especial spanish region , catalans exist to defend their own political status and their right for independence . 
  that 's why is call it national day . 
  wait for a legal referendum he said , it will be sooner he [ said ... ] ( http://edgecast.buscafs.com/www.levelup.com/public/uploads/images/364779.jpg ), 
  that one made me laugh . 
  but i use linux and i am very happy , maybe we should try an independent catalonia . 
  no thanks , i 'm good . 
  the bill please . 
  i 'm not sure if it was because of the * comuns * , probably it was strongly defended by erc and the cup . 
  the republic part is also more relevant than people might think . 
  if we win we openly renounce to have any form of monarchy , and especially the borbons . 
  in scottish referendum it was not relevant because they did n't oppose largely to monarchy , we do because borbons have been and are an anticatalan institution . 
   did anyone think for a second an independent catalonia would remain a monarchy ? 
  i do n't think so , but is a necessary political statement , because is a direct message renouncing to monarchy and especially the borbon dynasty . 
  the dinasty that imposed the * decretos de nueva planta * . 
  there are different answers to that question , depending always on personal backgrounds . 
  i have spanish origins and i speak spanish with my parents , they immigrated from spanish speaking regions to catalan speaking regions on the 1950 's / 1960 's because of poverty , at that time millions ( literally ) of people from spanish regions moved to catalonia , basque country , valencia ... in order to seek a better living standards . 
  that massive demographic process generated a big change and an impact on the territories that previously were not spanish from an ethnic or cultural perspective . 
  i say this because it was relevant for me , i have always been a person with a certain political conscious and morality and i did n't want to be part of the cultural substitution that is today in process and that i see advancing step by step .
