  the preliminary results were not very promising and they have [ abandoned the project ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/repsol-abandons-drilling-off-canary-islands-1421422659 ) , so maybe this has tempered spain 's interest in getting into yet another territorial dispute . 
  the pictures are really beautiful . 
  i am aware . 
  i did n't mean to trivialize hate crimes when i said `` not that bad '' . 
  i just wanted to say that i have seen gay couples behave and act in small towns and villages , as they would do in the center of madrid . 
  it was n't like this 15 or 20 years ago . 
   i 'm sure there are many gay spaniards , especially in rural areas , that do n't have it all that super ... i do n't know if you are gay and have had unpleasant experiences in spain , so i apologize if i offend you with my assumptions . 
  i 'm not gay so i do n't really know for sure , so this is just a guess . 
  i 'd be more wary of holding hands in the outskirts of big cities or in certain parks , than in rural areas where everybody knows everyone . 
  my point was that i do n't think there is such a huge contrast between liberal urban areas and a dark rural spain . 
  but i may be wrong . 
   edit : not to say that there are n't challenges for anyone that is different and lives in a small town . 
  i was talking more about safety and general acceptance . 
  in many european countries , personal use is either decriminalized , the laws are rarely enforced , it 's just a fine . 
  our `` concerned mothers '' in the 80s and 90s were fighting heroine rather than cannabis , and treating it like an epidemic and not a war . 
  on the other hand , people in america can get into a lot of trouble for getting caught with a joint , especially considering how punitive and unforgiving the justice system can be . 
  and we have the issue of the war on drugs and minorities , which is another can of worms . 
  because of all this , cannabis consumers did n't feel as persecuted and vilified in europe as in the us , so this is an issue only a small minority of activist stoners care about . 
  my point is , there is n't necessarily a correlation between social attitudes towards cannabis and regulations . 
  generally speaking , europeans are usually more confortable leaving certain unenforced laws on the books , while americans tend to be more activist and challenge `` unfair '' laws in courts . 
  of course this is a generalization , each country is different . 
  i 'm very suspicious of anyone who proposes such a measure . 
  first of all , i do n't like the idea of restricting voting rights to a subset of the population , the idea that some people know better than you what 's best for the country . 
  like when only men or men of certain wealth could vote . 
  it 's easy to look down on certain people and dismiss their opinions , we are all a little bit self-absorbed by nature . 
  but most of the assholes you run into are probably not that much of an asshole as we believe . 
  they probably care about their children and want good services too . 
  we like to think that this or that party is in charge because the ignorant masses vote `` for the wrong reasons '' . 
  at the end of the day , there is people like that voting for all parties , just like there is people much more intelligent than you and me voting for the party you do n't like . 
  you ca n't avoid the inevitable , but there are definitely downsides . 
  the countryside is far from natural these days , and the european landscapes are usually the result of the work and upkeep of rural communities and government agencies . 
  a country like spain , with so much sparsely populated land in the interior , ca n't afford the forestry and rural maintenance of all that land . 
  we do a little bit here and there , but it 's the kind of thing that we sacrifice or cut back on when the money is tight . 
  back in the day , it was the conventional economic activity of these rural communities what took care of the maintenance and management of forests . 
  given the propensity of mediterranean ecosystems to suffer from fires , this is not a small issue . 
  we see it every summer in the news ; they have a huge economic impact . 
  i 'm not saying you ca n't take care of the countryside without traditional rural activities , i 'm just saying they had a very important benefit . 
  there has to be hundreds of economical studies on the issue , but the main reasons are cultural ( call it nostalgia if you want ) . 
  here in spain , each [ * comarca * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:spain_comarcas.png ) has its own little identity and cultural heritage , and depopulation threatens this diversity . 
  i know there are different ideas regarding this , similarly to other cultural issues like endangered languages . 
  at the end of the day is a matter of how many people care vs how many people versus how many do n't . 
  i loled at the original headline . 
  spanish media has been reporting that they were also [ planning to kidnap someone and record his/her execution ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/04/10/inenglish/1428679625_327482.html ) , isis style . 
  if you live in a small village , you can become the official gay of the town , just like you would hear about `` el bar de la rumana '' , `` el hijo de la sorda '' or `` mi amigo el negro '' . 
  so yeah , i agree that you need some thick skin , depending on your cultural background . 
  of course each individual has a different experience . 
  one of my closest friends never came out to his recently deceased father , and has made it very clear he also never will come out to his ( jehova 's witness ) mother . 
  but the situation in rural areas and smaller towns is not really bad . 
  there are many openly gay people in small villages . 
  i would say the worst place to be gay is probably high-school , especially in certain neighborhoods and towns . 
  you know what , those opinions change very quickly once coming out of the closet becomes more acceptable/less risky . 
  i 'm pulling this out of my ass ( no pun intended ) , but i would say you would get similar poll results in spain in the early 90 's . 
  it 's easier to feel that way about gay people when they are faceless stereotypes , rather than your geeky childhood friend , who would rather play d&d than go clubbing ( not to say there is anything wrong with that ) . 
  in spain it varies greatly from city to city . 
  i just googled the national average and it is 1.73 $ / m3 . 
  at least in madrid , the water bill is very complex and the price depends on many variables . 
  the first few m3 are cheaper . 
  and water is more expensive in the summer months . 
  i think the average is around 1,5 $ / m3 in madrid , but it 's more expensive in the mediterranean and the islans . 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carnation_revolution ) :  before april 1974 , the war in africa was consuming as much as 40 % of the portuguese budget and there was no end in sight . 
  that 's a very effective way to get your ass overthrown . 
  although you are right , it is not obvious what might have happened at the end of the war should the republican side have won . 
  the different groups and factions had very different ideas of what spain should be after the war , but most of them were smart enough to understand that they needed to postpone dealing with these issues until the end of the war . 
  the communist party 's allegiance to stalin 's soviet union could have been a destabilizing force after the war . 
  we will never know . 
  and we ca n't ignore there was a very big portion of the population with very conservative and traditional ideas , they were n't going anywhere . 
  spain 's possible involvement in world war ii is another can of worms . 
  no matter what would have happened , i do n't think there are many bright scenarios ** after ** such a war . 
  in my opinion , the biggest `` what if '' of that time is , what if moderate republicans and conservatives could have cooperated better in 1931 . 
  but the 30s were a very difficult decade from a economic and political viewpoint . 
  and the traditional involvement of the army in politics for almost a century did n't help . 
  apparently , this map is not about money or foreign aid . 
  there is a short wikipedia article on the [ world giving index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_giving_index ) , and the ranking is based on a poll asking three questions :  gallup asked people which of the following three charitable acts they had undertaken in the past month :  * donated money to an organisation ? 
   * volunteered time to an organisation ? 
   * helped a stranger , or someone they did n't know who needed help ? 
  you can check page 11 of the [ report ] ( https://www.cafonline.org/pdf/caf_wgi2014_report_1555awebfinal.pdf ) to see that countries have an score on each of the questions ( representing the percentage of people that answered `` yes '' , i assume ) , and the giving score is just the average of these three scores . 
  agreed . 
  something like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/florence_rape_of_the_sabine_women_1.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://www.wga.hu/art/b/bernini/gianlore/sculptur/1620/proserpi.jpg ) . 
  you are right , i should have written `` they claim it was a personal present '' . 
   spain : apollo 11 display is missing after being in the possession of the franco family i 've never heard of that story , you made me look it up . 
  apparently , it was a personal present and was never donated to a museum or anything . 
  franco 's family kept the fragment after his death and his daughter lost it . 
  there were rumors that they auctioned it . 
  [ this article ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/07/20/ciencia/1248121248.html ) ( in spanish ) tells the story and shows another rock , gifted to the then president ( designated , not elected ) . 
  well , only a small fraction of the `` audience '' gets that emotional . 
  it is very beautiful in some places , and it can be very impressive when they have to move very heavy `` thrones '' through very narrow old streets , or they have to kneel to pass under an arch or a power line . 
  but a lot of people go just because `` everyone '' is going to be there . 
  my mom loves it because she can dress up nicely and greet a lot of people , check what they are wearing , etc. 
  it 's simply nice to go out in those occasions where everyone is in the streets and the bars are packed . 
  i , on the other hand , find it very uncomfortable and kinda boring , like taking your daughter and her friends to a one direction concert or something like that . 
  i 've seen it many times and it 's much less exotic to me by now . 
  it can be pretty surreal , but humans are social beings , so if the crowd is excited and cheering , you will feel it to some extent , regardless of your beliefs . 
  at the end of the day , the main thing those people celebrate is tradition and social cohesion . 
  that 's why you even atheists ( or just people with ambiguous beliefs ) sometimes take part too . 
   a presidential system is decisively : the government can do things much faster instead of relying on coalitions and making compromises which sometimes led to lax measures you should tell obama . 
  your two main points are contradictory in my opinion . 
  the president may do things as fast as he wants , but then the legislative has the ability to block all its projects and usually forces the president to make more compromises than in parliamentary systems . 
  in parliamentary systems , you need some sort of majority or coalition to elect a government , but once you do , you basicaly have the same people in control of the executive and legislative powers . 
  i guess it depends on the degree of independence of the members of the parliament , but in spain , they rarely vote against the party leader 's will . 
  when the party leader , the president of the majority in the parliament and the prime minister , are the same person ( or a loyal group of people ) , the government can do things very fast .
