  if they have a majority , that 's absolute rule for 4 years , as the parliament will pass whatever the government throws at them . 
  of course , this can change a lot depending on how parties work and the electoral system ( some parliamentary systems strongly favor the bigger parties to encourage majorities ) . 
  i want a system that allows the presence of different parties , not a two party system . 
  i hate those huge parties with very broad and sometimes contradictory ideas , that people vote for because they dislike it less than the alternative . 
  i hate it when people with liberal ideas are forced to vote for socially conservative parties ( which are sometimes in favor of regulation in europe ) , because the only alternative is an ambiguous block of big-spending socialists . 
  i hate it when a person that feels passionate about their region and prefers a federal state has to vote for a party that defends centralism . 
  parliamentary systems can also turn into two-party systems from time to time , but the ability of third parties to appear and have an influence is far greater . 
  many elections result in an almost two-party parliament , but when the big parties start doing weird shit , they do n't get that many `` pinched-nose '' votes , because there is an alternative . 
  also , coalitions are usually formed between compatible parties with different priorities , so the junior member of the coalition can put forward certain issues that the voters of the senior partner do n't necessarily oppose . 
  for instance , socialdemocrats are usually more focused on building and keeping a strong social safety net , but do n't oppose the enviromental policies that green party voters demand . 
  all systems have strengths and weaknesess . 
  at the end of the day it depends on the political culture of the country .

  i do n't know , spanish people can sometimes be unintentionally nationalistic , even when they try not to ( like german people , but in a different way ) . 
  so even when people do n't say that the language is the best and all that , they still do n't give any value to learning foreign languages , and some people have very passive-aggressive attitudes towards regional languages . 
  i grew up in the south and some people seem to think that catalan was invented by annoying people with the sole purpose of pissing them off . 
  leaving all politics and historical grievances behind , i really think that people should travel more to other parts of the country . 
  i think spoken brazilian portuguese is easier to understand . 
  when i hear a portuguese speaking i have a harder time understanding where the words start and end , with all the shhhh going on . 
  these parties support russia for the same reason they support iran and venezuela , because they are traditionally anti-american and support any government that seems to `` stand against american imperialism '' . 
  all this reminds me of a recent [ russian roulette episode ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epz-ebxhkiq ) where they interviewed some of the foreign volunteers fighting alongside separatist forces . 
  the volunteers came from different far-left and far-right groups of several countries , which makes you wonder to what extent early 20th century ideologies are valid anymore . 
  [ first grammar of a modern european language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gram%c3%a1tica_de_la_lengua_castellana ) ? 
   spain like the uk is made of several country 's not anymore since the bourbons won the war of the spanish succesion in the early 18th century . 
  catalan nationalists interpret all the events of the time as the conquest of catalonia by spain , and the [ national day of catalonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_day_of_catalonia ) is september 11 . 
  it commemorates the day that the bourbon troops entered barcelona after a year-long siege . 
  anyone interested may want to check [ this wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nueva_planta_decrees ) . 
  many nationalists and federalists today believe that spain is indeed made of several nations and that the constitution should recognize it , but the political climate in madrid is very hostile to this idea . 
  a socialist catalan president tried to introduce a new constitution that proclaimed this , among other things , but it was repealed by the central government in courts . 
  you basically need to ammend the spanish constitution if you want to pull it off .

  who would have guessed , after reading the whole article ? 
  edit : just so people can downvote me for the right reasons . 
  the article made it sound like all these kids are failing terribly , but then , at the end , it states in passing that they actually outperform natives . 
  my impression was that the article was leading the reader to think that these kids are having trouble , then it says they wind up okay , and does n't expand on that . 
  in other words , i was n't giving any opinion on immigration policies .

  people get very emotional about these things in europe . 
  it 's a consequence of national identities and 200 years of nationalism and nationalist conflicts . 
  history is fascinating , but moral codes change and most of people living 100 years ago held views that most of us find terribly disgusting and immoral . 
  it may be helpful to remember that most of our ancestors were dirt-poor peasants with very similar life goals , and they rarely were affected by the what you read in a country 's history page in wikipedia , except when there was war , hunger and other bad things .

  i do n't know if it 's really suply and demand when it 's pretty much 2-3 huge conglomerates waging a price war that has nothing to do with the suply and demand of milk , but about getting a dominant position in the market . 
  they usually sell certain basic products like milk at a loss , regardless of the actual suply and demand of the product , in order to attract customers from competitors . 
  they usually make it up with higher margins in other products . 
  i 'm not saying whether this is valid or not . 
  i 'm not really interested in that debate right now . 
  i 'm only saying that the price drop has not much to do with suply and demand .

  some people also think high salaries promote career politicians , people that join the parties ' youth organizations at age 18 , and spend their woking years in the different institutional levels ( local , regional , national and a vacation in brussels if you have been a good boy ) .

  i believe it 's the first time spanish isis suspects were groomed and encouraged by their families . 
  most of the time you see the family and friends speaking with news reporters , saying that they are shocked , that this is not what we taught him , that he made new friends , etc. 
  there are also some pixelated images of the raid on spanish media and the twins still look pretty young .

  you may be right , but i guess it depends on your political views . 
  not everyone thinks that everything must be left to the market forces , as the market does n't care about child miners , acid rain or wars . 
  do n't get me wrong , maybe those farmers need to find something else to do , but i also think european governments should care about the stability and development of rural areas . 
  i do n't know if the french farmers were getting rich , but spanish farmers have been getting less and less for their milk due to the price wars between the big supermarket chains , and it 's reaching a point where producers barely manage to cover costs .

  but hey , we can cover our eyes and wait all we want , but nationalism is n't going anywhere . 
  my instinctive answer would be `` how the feck should i know ? '' . 
  it 's hard to say , but it really depends on whether the pp stays in power . 
  even if they lose their majority , they can still stay in charge with the help of ciudadanos or the psoe ( forming a grand coalition similar to what we have seen in germany or greece ) . 
  if they do n't take part in the next government , and there is a strong nationalist majority after the catalan elections , we might see something happen . 
  there has always been a strong federalist current within the psoe , and the big southern leaders who traditionally spoke against these initiatives have retired . 
  they may bring up again some things that were on the table before 2010 , like the possibility to redefine spain as a multinational state ( akin to the uk ) or giving catalonia the authority to raise taxes ( like the basque do ) . 
  to be honest , things might stay the same for another 10 or 20 years . 
  i grew up in southern spain , and many young people hold similar ideas on these issues than their parents , so there is still going to be tremendous pressure to oppose anything that comes from the catalan parliament . 
  obviously , it was not intentional . 
  there have been countless attempts , but none of them really caught on . 
   the current anthem is called the swiss psalm . 
  in 1981 it replaced rufst du mein vaterland ( when you call , my fatherland ) , which was set to the same tune as the british national anthem - god save the queen .
