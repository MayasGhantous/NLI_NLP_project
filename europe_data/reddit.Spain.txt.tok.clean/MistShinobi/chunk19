  many guys simply follow the preferences of their partner . 
  i love that place too , 
  they have always been like that . 
  the most conservative sectors of the government are children of francoist elites and they give a lot of importance to `` public order '' . 
  it 's always said that your freedom ends when somebody else 's freedom starts , certain rights conflict with other rights and our laws have to regulate those situations . 
  the problem is that these people have very little consideration for freedom of speech . 
  for them , it 's minor right and the first to be sacrified whenever there is the slightest conflict . 
  definitely . 
  there have been countless threads discussing this , and the general answer is that people fear and distrust the russian government , but the baltics and poles of the sub seem neutral or even friendly towards russian people . 
  yes , there is also a lot of talk about how the russian minorities do n't integrate very well and whatnot , and again , there are different opinions . 
  but i have never perceived ** real ** animosity towards russian culture or russian minorities ( as in `` shot on sight '' ) . 
  even in threads discussing the ukranian conflict , a very divisive and heated topic , people tend to use words like militans or rebels to single out the combatants from the rest of the population . 
  to be honest , they find out pretty quikly , mainly due to egregious lack of decent mexican food . 
  he talked a lot about life and death in his books , he clealy thought about those issues a lot . 
  hell , he even made of death one of his world 's main protagonists . 
  but he also talked a lot about living life to the fullest . 
  great writer and great man , will be missed . 
  `` no one is actually dead until the ripples they cause in the world die away ... '', 
  granpa 's post-war stories more than anything . 
  spain uses qwerty but [ our keyboards ] ( http://imagenes.es.sftcdn.net/blog/es//2011/03/teclado.jpg ) include the glorious \u00d1 and accents . 
  the funny part is that olivenza was taken by force a century after the treaty of utrecht gave gibraltar to the british . 
  and portugal never signed anything that gave the land to spain . 
  the border was always very difuse anyways , because most of it sits on resourceless , sparesly populated land . 
  the only reason to take olivenza was to move the border a few miles west to the guadiana river . 
  if you check google maps you will find many backroads and dirt tracks in the middle of nowhere that cross from one country to another . 
  it 's funny , because you see flags , fancy bridges and ( now-closed ) customs buildings on the main roads , but if you take a little hike a few miles away , you do n't really see the border , just some rocky hills and a few dry rivers . 
  smuggling was so easy back in the day . 
  i was 17 , and planning on going to madrid to start university . 
  it was a great shock , but luckily i did n't have to worry about family and friends ( i know people that was going to be at barajas the day of the t4 bombing at that was bad enough ) . 
  i was a goody-two shoes , but everyone cut class to go to the demonstrations . 
  just take a look at the [ chart on this wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reactions_to_the_2004_madrid_train_bombings ) . 
  there was a strong anti-government sentiment in the demonstrations and many people were angry ( * hijos de puta * chants were constant ) . 
  some people said that we should find whoever did this and bomb the hell out of them . 
  oh , and the people that thought it was eta ... well , you heard terrible terrible stuff about the basque and what we should do to them . 
  people were glued to their tvs those 3 days and everyone went crazy with all the different theories on who did it . 
  it was a very confusing few days , but in my opinion , the pp was more damaged by their own actions than by whatever the opposition did . 
  they digged their own grave by not being more cautious when the country was still in shock . 
  they can say whatever they want , but i will never forget [ acebes 's press conference ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylc34i3i8hc ) . 
  you are completely correct . 
  he is the [ prime minister ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prime_minister_of_spain ) and that 's the official english translation . 
  i sometimes use `` president '' in my unofficial activities on reddit , because we call it * presidente * . 
  these things are funny , because the german * kanzler ( in ) * is called chancellor and not pm in english . 
  by the way , there are prime ministers in [ some republics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prime_minister_of_france ) too ( just looked it up out of curiosty , i 'm not trying to be smart or anything ) . 
  it seems we never really liked the term ( too british ? 
  ) , because even during the spanish republic we had a president of the republic and a president of the government . 
  spain was one of the most enthusiast supporters of gw bush military adventures in iraq and afghanistan , and spain 's president at the time was bffs with bush . 
  they would have found some other reason if they wanted to , and al-qaeda has also said weird things about reconquering al-andalus and shit before . 
  well , op said worst islamist attack . 
  i do n't think lockerbie can be considered an islamist attack . 
  it was socialist basque lizardmen , but the government is trying to cover up the truth . 
  the last time we tried , [ it did n't end up too well ] ( http://www.epapontevedra.com/arte/l%c3%a1minas/goya%20 ( los % 20fusilamentos % 20del % 203 % 20de % 20mayo \\ ) . jpg ) . 
  i 'm all for uncersored top-less protesteters on the afternoon news , you ca n't get more european than that . 
  [ this vice piece ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omqolxnqabi ) gives a brief overview of the current migrant situation in ceuta and melilla . 
  morocco cooperates with spain and the eu in exchange of ~ ~ bribes ~ ~ cooperation money . 
  it 's a shady situation , because we are giving money to them , fully knowing that moroccan security forces can and will do whatever they want to those immigrants . 
  sarcasm is a double-edged sword on this sub , too many different cultures communicating in a foreign language . 
  i just find it hilarious that people still say that french women or german women are this and that , after decades of globalization and topless tourists tanning at the beach . 
  it 's just a joke about the stereotype that the women from country x have moustaches , do n't shave their armpits , or something like that . 
  that being said , women in lisbon were surprisingly attractive . 
  the women were less hairy than expected . 
  a truly fascinating place , pictures do n't do justice . 
  it 's not just the palace , but the surrounding grounds , the mountains , and the feeling of seclusion . 
  i would totally buy that shit , it 's hilarious . 
  lol . 
  i 'm not even sure about spain 's 20-29 % percentage , depending on what you consider a conversation . 
  hard to say . 
  i would n't rule out any coalition othen than pp+p odemos . 
  a ciudadanos + podemos coalition also seems unlikely due to their opposite economic views , but you never know . 
  eventually , it will depend on the election results . 
  at the end of the day , our electoral system is biased in favor of less populated areas , where the new political parties do n't have many options to get seats . 
  also , established parties usually get more votes than predicted by polls . 
  i 'm pretty sure the pp will get the most seats , followed by either podemos or psoe ( psoe is really strong in the rural areas ) . 
  ciudadanos may support a pp or psoe government , if they have enough votes and can get something in exchange . 
  if a pp+c iudadanos or psoe+c iudadanos coalition ca n't secure a majority , a pp+psoe coalition is a strong possibility , especially to stop podemos . 
  we saw similar coalitions in greece and germany . 
  a psoe+p odemos coalition should never happen if we are to believe what they say about each other , but it 's not impossible . 
  there is also the possibility of a minority government , it has happened in the past . 
  i think that 's the exception rather than the norm . 
  the left has traditionally supported the the right to decide in spain , or at least has adopted a neutral stance . 
  the unity of spain is not one of the main points of podemos . 
  it all comes down to pablo iglesias saying that he would rather see catalonia continue being part of spain , but he also thinks that the catalan citizens have the right to vote and decide on that issue . 
  before podemos , it was rare hearing somebody from the left saying something like that , with the exception of certain southern psoe leaders like bono or ibarra . 
  the psoe , especially in catalonia and the basque country , has often supported federalism and the idea that there can be different nations within the spanish state ( [ maragall 's estatut ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/estatuto_de_autonom%c3%ada_de_catalu%c3%b1a_de_2006 ) comes to my mind ) . 
  and parties to the left of psoe have usually been nationalist or tolerant . 
  especially in areas where there is the slightest nationalist presence , no only in catalonia or euskadi , but also in places like valencia or asturias . 
  that 's one of the main reasons upyd was called conservative or even far-right , because rosa d\u00edez was a basque against nationalism . 
  and that 's also why albert rivera and ciudadanos has been called similar things , because he is a catalan that has spoken against all the recent catalan nationalist initiatives . 
   they stand ** against ** secession , which is considered conservative in spain i meant that opposing secession is considered a conservative stance . 
  i 'm sorry if i did n't make myself clear . 
   the next ones will probably be most interesting elections on the history of spanish democracy indeed !, 
  i hope we can get something out of all this . 
  almost every democratic system tends to produce a two-party system in the long run , but maybe the next parliament can force some changes in the way political parties operate ( especially closed lists ) . 
  it 's also great that ciudadanos is threatening the pp 's confortable position . 
  i think that particular poll inflates ciudadanos numbers a little bit . 
  they had never managed to break the 10 % mark in most of polls , but they are definitely growing . 
  still pretty impressive , especially considering this is the first party in decades that threatens to steal away votes from the conservative pp . 
  * podemos = the new leftist , socialist , anti-austerity party that everyone is talking about . 
  * psoe = established center-left , social-democrats , * pp = established conservatives , center-right , catholic * ciudadanos = economic liberals , ** self-proclaimed ** progressives , not particularly conservative on social issues . 
  the party was founded in catalonia and they stand against secession , which is considered conservative in spain . 
  so , pp and psoe have been the two big parties taking turns ruling the country since the 80s .
