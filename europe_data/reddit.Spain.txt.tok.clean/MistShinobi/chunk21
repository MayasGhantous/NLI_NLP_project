  podemos could have done things better , especially when it comes to manners , but they had to vote no . 
  the socialists staged a public round of talks with different left-wing parties for a couple of weeks aiming to build a leftist coalition with a suppossedly leftist social agenda . 
  then they sign a pact with ciudadanos out of nowhere , blindsiding everyone , and everyone else had very little time to maneuver . 
  ciudadanos is pretty incompatible with podemos and the rest of leftist parties on many levels , including labor policy . 
  you also have to understand the history of leftwing parties in spain . 
  a lot of leftists see the psoe as `` reoffending '' traitors that will promise a lot when they want your vote and then turn their backs . 
  it has often punished lefwing parties in the polls when they used the votes of discontent socialists , only to support the psoe without asking much . 
  there 's also a lot of mistrust after what happened at the end of the zapatero government , when the socialists surrendered to the troika auterity , reformed the constitution overnight with the pp , and all that . 
  i do n't really want to discuss if that was the best decision or not , but the fact is that a lot of podemos voters are former socialist voters that are extremely disappointed in the psoe . 
  considering all this , podemos has to demand to be included in the new government . 
  i would n't talk about political instability until new elections are called , which may very well happen , but we have seen before that agreements become increasingly easier as the deadline approaches . 
  and i doubt the results will change that much unless there is some huge unexpected scandal . 
  they will probably still need some kind of 3 party agreement . 
  besides , there are renewed rumors of a podemos + iu coalition in case of a repeat election , which would increase significantly their number of seats because of how the electoral system works ( [ this graph ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/politica/grafico-congreso-podemos-confluencias-iu_0_464754323.html ) shows the number of seats they could have gotten if the had ran together in last election ) . 
  we 'll probably see a psoe-led government unless a new election gives a strong majority to pp+c iudadanos ( they are 13 seats away so i guess it 's possible ) . 
  [ `` paja '' with the sense of masturbation is centuries old ] ( http://etimologias.dechile.net/?paja ) , and has nothing to do with hay . 
  it 's also used in some latin american countries , and when certain slang word is common on both sides of the atlantic , it 's usually very old . 
   what i found fascinating when i lived in spain was how certain types of police will not go after certain types of criminals and everybody knows it . 
  okay , yeah , sometimes the national police do n't bother with ...  i was once standing at a busy 6-way intersection and next to me , there stood two policemen chatting with each other . 
  meanwhile , everybody else was running over the street , ignoring the red lights and the honking cars . 
  well ... that 's a clear giveaway you 're not from here . 
  nobody is concerned about jaywalking in spain . 
  it 's not seen as a problem or something that has to be actively stopped and nobody expects any type of police officer to care about that . 
  we do n't even have a specific word for that . 
  have you ever seen the very explicit caricatures of the book [ * `` los borbones en pelota '' * ] ( http://ifc.dpz.es/recursos/publicaciones/32/48/_ebook.pdf ) ( [ you can also check google images ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=los+borbones+en+pelota&amp;tbm=isch ) ) . 
  it 's pretty nasty and half of it are caricatures of the queen servicing many men , often in groups . 
   except her husband , who was gayer than magneto [ `` el rey consorte , primer pajillero de la corte '' ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4669vxrebyk/urr77evqmqi/aaaaaaaaezm/jcwrqvbitsa/s400/rey_consorte.jpg ), 
  the victorian era overlaps with two major periods in spanish history : the reign of isabel ii ( 1933-1868 ) and the bourbon restoration ( 1874-1931 ) . 
  the term * isabelino * ( ~ elizabethan ) is reserved to isabella i of castille . 
  although the periods only partially overlap , i 'd say that the term restoration ( * restauraci\u00f3n * ) provokes a similar mental image as `` victorian '' . 
  to be honest , you need at least two armies or armed factions to start a civil war . 
  there was no group that could start a civil war and the military ran a very tight ship . 
  you can argue that the transition to democracy could have been much messier and more turbulent . 
  it was already difficult to keep the army under control and there was still a coup in 1981 . 
  it 's obvious that you could n't say you are going to arrest everyone and clean the army and the police back in 1977 , but it is still outrageous to have both groups in the same law . 
  because they had been convicted and jailed ( of political crimes ) . 
  at least you can convict some of that people . 
  in spain , there are well-known torturers of francoist police walking in the streets and enjoying their retirement . 
  the worst part is that they are protected by the same amnesty law that freed their victims . 
  holly shit , poor boy . 
  i ca n't imagine how many years it will be before he 's able to set a foot on a locker room . 
  i was expecting two big ass dikes from britain to france and norway in order to drain the whole north sea . 
  spaniards have a complicated relationship with this issue , but on [ this day ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwhpyezslxo ) many feels were had . 
  well , you can always find your own personal way of feeling patriotic . 
  i do n't really think that patriotism can only led to violence in spain , but flag-waving patriotism is used to divert the public 's attention . 
  as much i disagree with pablo iglesias at times , i really like [ his take on patriotism ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rwrnsh_m-m ) . 
  this is just the last chapter of the epic saga of corruption in the valencia region . 
  and the plethora of corruption scandals has had significant impact . 
  in the regional election of last spring , left-wing coalitions managed to take the regional government and the city halls of valencia and alicante after 20 years of pp governments , and the podemos-compromis coalition was the second most voted party in the general election of last december . 
  well , as far as i know , there is nothing retarded about palencia , but you made me wonder about the etymology of both names . 
  apparently , they are completely unrelated . 
  valencia has latin roots and palencia is pre-roman , with several theories regarding its origin . 
  driving down on the a-67 highway from palencia to santander in august is mind-blowing . 
  it 's like finding narnia or something . 
  i also believe that it was more popular than basketball a few decades ago , before the silver medal of los angeles 84 , at least that 's the impression i get when i talk to people from my father 's generation . 
  we have strong tradition of satirical publications , including some very bad-taste and controversial ones ( check out the [ cover mongolia 's last christmas special ] ( http://s01.s3c.es/imag/_v0/550x751/0/1/f/mongolia-contra.jpg ) , ** nsfw ** , like pretty much all the links in this post ) . 
  the only topic that can get you in trouble is messing with the royal family . 
  [ this very famous cover ] ( https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gashnr-e5va/u5g3v-ht1oi/aaaaaaaadso/ncwphdrnvti/s1600/eljueves_portada_censura.jpg ) depicting the then prince and princess ( now king and queen ) was banned and the few issues that were sold became a valuable collectible item . 
  this [ cover about the abdication ] ( http://postdigital.es/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/eljueves_elreyabdica.jpg ) was banned by the publisher . 
  mongolia has been trying very hard to get in trouble and get some exposure with covers like [ this ] ( https://d1qzzfctbfyh6r.cloudfront.net/content-images/contentimage/no-slug/4d375faf7cb8ed65ab42902f1ee3272e.jpg ) ( translation : the king could rape you , denouncing his legal immunity ) . 
  at the end of the day , nobody get in serious trouble for this kind of stuff , and any kind of legal action against offensive satire only creates a huge streisand effect . 
  other than that , you can see [ this kind of stuff ] ( https://anselmolucio.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/el-jueves-merkel.jpg ) all the time . 
  edit : there is also a lot of satire on tv . 
  benevolent satire has been a common criticism tool in leftwing media for ages . 
   but this almost borders on treason ... what ? 
  he 's speaking about making a tv show for the iranian tv , he 's not admitting in any way that podemos received iranian money . 
  i 've watched some of those shows and they 're nothing scandalous . 
  they can be a leftist echo chamber ( though i 've seen conservative journalists in some shows ) , but the tone is always pretty calm and polite . 
  in my limited experience , hispan tv is generally acceptable except when the issue of israel comes up . 
  you can check out his show on hispan tv `` fort apache '' on youtube . 
  do n't get me wrong , i wo n't condone foreign financing of political parties if it 's actually true , but , so far it 's only been rumors . 
  and spanish newspapers often leak unconfirmed rumors from police sources that later turn out to be false or not completely true . 
  they have done this with politicians of many political parties . 
  so at this point , i would n't trust spanish newspapers until a judge opens a real investigation . 
  the prosecutors are busting their asses trying to `` save the princess '' . 
  she was indicted during the preliminary investigation , but now that the real trial starts , she could very well be exonerated as her accusation was n't brought by the prosecutors or by tax authorities ( the alleged `` victim '' ) , but by a private accusation . 
  no matter what happens , the public perception of the spanish monarchy has suffered significantly . 
  if she 's exonerated , most people will say the courts looked the other way . 
  i agree . 
  i 'm also concerned about this mess , but do n't worry about the laws , the government will uphold them , i 'm sure catalan nationalist leaders have wetdreams thinking about handcuffed politicians . 
  i bet they all wanted mas to be that `` poor victim '' . 
  the whole `` proc\u00e9s '' is * suppossed * to be an answer to madrid 's inmovilism and unwillingness to change the status quo anyway . 
  i also think it 's concerning that the major spanish parties are becoming irrelevant in catalonia , while the catalonian parties obviously do n't give a shit about what the non catalan voters think . 
  in my opinion , this is creating very unproductive political dynamics . 
  oh , i agree . 
  i usually bring up scotland when discussing the issue . 
  even though many spaniards are eager to point out the numerous differences between spain and the uk , we still have the ( from a spanish point of view ) very shocking case of a conservative pro-union government allowing a referendum . 
  at the end of the day , neither the scottish government nor the scottish parliament had the power to call such a referendum and the cooperation of westmister was necessary . 
  sadly , after years of using the issue for political gain , a lot of people in spain assume that supporting a referendum means that you seek the balkanization of spain . 
  but i do n't see a referendum happening any time soon , as it would probably require a constitutional reform , and that means you need to have the pp on board . 
  one thing is clear , if a day comes when a certain % of the catalan population wants independence , you wo n't be able to stop that with the means of a democratic state . 
  i do n't know what that percentage is , but those who care so much about the unity of spain should think more about the best way to convince catalonian citizens to stay . 
  and both personal experience and polls show that younger generations are more pro-independence . 
  still , i 'm shocked by the last two paragraphs of the agreement , which can be summed up as : `` the cup have been very very naughty and we apologize for having principles and not submitting to our great leader artur mas '' . 
  in a certain way , one has to applaud their lack of pride . 
  i ca n't see any other political group willing to sign that text . 
  it keeps the momentum going at least . 
  the seccesionist movement has been building up enthusiasm and excitement for a couple of years , and i guess this standstill in the catalan parliament had to be very disappointing . 
  besides , the majority of pro-independence parties in parliament was relatively slim , and a new election could have made them lose a few seats and jeopardize that majority . 
  well , c 's has made it very clear that their top political priority is the unity of spain , and that any other policy or decision is secondary .
