  i can see them justifying a positive vote in order to `` save '' the country . 
  i did n't think this was going to happen , though it was what made the most sense from a realistic point of view . 
  pro-independence forces could very well have lost a few seats in a new election . 
  besides , the timing is perfect considering that madrid is just at the beginning of another political standstill . 
  i like [ this answer ] ( https://youtu.be/xwzlyacvxwy?t=38m15s ) by jose luis cuerda in an interview ( by pablo iglesias ) . 
  people that say there are too many films about the civil war have probably never wached any of those supposed films . 
  there are very few movies that depict the actual war , and there is n't a historical film that tries to tell the whole story or a significant part of it , in a simlar way as other contries ' films have tried to depict similar events . 
  the economy is still not that great and many people are very critical of the government 's enthusiasm , but we ca n't deny that the destructive trend has been contained and the situation has started to turn arond on a macro level ( at a huge social cost ) . 
  that being said , there are still certain misconceptions about spain 's economy . 
  spain was n't technically bailed-out or intervened , and the country was n't subjected to special austerity measures like greece . 
  it would be sad if voters do n't appreciate their integrity . 
  they stuck to their principles under tremendous pressure . 
  i 'm honestly puzzled by erc 's steadfast support of mas though , and i often wonder why they have kept such a low profile during the last few months . 
  for those out of the loop , the catalan parliament will be unable to appoint a president next week , and a new election will be called . 
  that 's a few more months of nobody really knowing what 's going to happen in catalonia , which only adds more fuel to the current stalemate in the spanish parliament . 
  he 's also notorious for avoiding the press as much as possible . 
  most of the time , journalists can only ask him questions when he 's in brussels or in some international visit . 
  his [ no-questions-allowed press conference through a tv screen ] ( https://ignaciotrillo.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/rajoy-transparencia-1.jpg ) became a national meme . 
  driving is a little bit more of a luxury than a necessity in europe than in the us . 
  in most of the us you ca n't buy an ice-cream or a carton of milk without getting on a car . 
  hell , for many people in rural and suburban america , you ca n't really leave your land/subdivision without a car . 
  i honestly think america would n't function today if getting a license became much more difficult . 
  in europe on the other hand , a lot of people get into their 30s without really needing a car . 
  in some places driving a car is not only unnecessary but inconvenient for many reasons . 
  a car is something you buy when you settle down and start a family , for trips and the occasional visit to ikea/mall/grocery store . 
  it was already pretty difficult considering psoe+p odemos were 17 seats short of a majority . 
  cs has expressed its opposition and supports a big coalition that includes the pp . 
  united left got 2 , cc 1 and basque nationalist parties 8 . 
  that means that a psoe+p odemos coalition would require the cooperation of catalan parties ( 17 seats in total ) , and i do n't see why they should help in any way if they are denied a referendum . 
  and podemos is n't going to back off on that issue either . 
  they are perfectly confortable with the current situation and are n't afraid of a second election . 
  their support of a referendum has undoubtedly contributed to their great results in catalonia and the basque country and does n't really hurt them in the rest of the country . 
  and their depiction of the [ cup leaders ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1c0-42uil8 ) is uncanningly spot-on . 
  those guys are amazing . 
  i 'm sorry , but that was hilarious . 
  i was following the news and twitter and , memes aside , it felt like the future of catalonia was about to be decided ... and then they get a tie . 
  i ca n't say who is the greatest . 
  i enjoy art from all periods , but i especially love velazquez 's portraits . 
  you can stare at those eyes for hours ( though you may want to check the rest of the exhibition ) .

  from the bit about spain :  despite the effervescent rise of the anti-establishment podemos party , the partido popular was well positioned to remain in government following ** elections scheduled for late 2015 ** do you mean the elections of last weekend ? 
  yep , this is probably a little bit old . 
  there are sizable romanian ( immigrant ) communities in spain and italy . 
  in spain , i 'd say they are relatively well-integrated and respected as hard workers , especially by those who actually interact with romanians . 
  yep . 
  i assume the spots marked as `` other '' in the map are mostly lamb , which does n't even appear in the legend . 
  we 're having lamb this year ( * pierna de lechal * ) , but each year we cook something different . 
   is n't catalonia wealthier than most of spain ? 
  they are  would they contribute to the country 's budget post-independence ? 
  there has n't been any serious discussion about the exact terms of a hypothetical independence , but i 'd say real independence implies that they would n't contribute anything . 
   why do most cite the scotland referendum for unit as i said , both situations are n't exactly the same , but they have something in common : the scottish institutions did n't have the authority to call a referendum on that issue , they needed westminster 's cooperation . 
  cameron could have very well done the same as our pm does , dig his heels in and keep saying no . 
  from a spanish perspective , it 's simply mind-blowing to see people like the tories allow a referendum . 
  for most spaniards , defending a referendum means supporting secession , so some people use scotland to illustrate that you can be undoubtedly pro-union and still support a referendum . 
   since catalans already voted for secession some months ago ( even if it was n't officially recognized ) there has n't been a real referendum . 
  there was an unofficial plebiscite on november 2014 that most non-nationalists ignored , and early regional elections last september where seccesionist parties got 48 % of the popular vote and 53 % of the seats , so the situation is still very much unresolved . 
  podemos has always been open about their stance on the catalan issue , though i 'm not sure if they made clear it was a requisite to support any government . 
  in my opinion , most podemos voters are indiferent or in favor of a referendum . 
  many believe it 's the best way to protect the unity of spain and often cite the case of scotland . 
  even though the legal and historical frameworks are not the same , we still have a clear example of a very conservative pro-union government allowing an independence referendum in order to contain secessionism . 
  others think this whole face-off between the spanish and catalan governments is mostly a way to keep the public distracted from social and economic issues , and a referendum is a good way to `` nip it in the bud '' . 
  man , the result was historic , even moreso considering our voting system and the way older people vote . 
  you ca n't change a country overnight . 
  look at syriza ( regardless of your opinion of them ) , they took part in [ many elections ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/coalici%c3%b3n_de_la_izquierda_radical#consejo_de_los_helenos ) until they got where they are today . 
  and the situation in greece was worse , which eroded mainstrem parties more . 
  anything can happen . 
  so let me ask you . 
  do n't you know anyone that voted pp ? 
  are they all people you despise or disrespect ? 
  does n't your grandma or some friend vote for them ? 
  if your mother voted pp , would you think she 's a bad person ? 
  would you stop talking to her ? 
  honestly , i think it would be pretty sad if any decent person you interact with has the same political ideas than you . 
  have n't you ever met someone who you totally disagree with but is incredibly sharp and intelligent ? 
  everyone that has different political views happens to be stupid and flawed ? 
  you really need to live in a very limited and homogenous world to see things like that . 
   i can respect anyone having ( in my opinion stupid ) ultra-conservative , catholic , right-wing opinion . 
  do you realize that you do n't have to have that kind of worldview to vote pp ? 
  do you know that there are atheists and people with socially liberal views that voted pp ? 
  there are people that voted pp because they simply think that they are the best to manage the economy and believe that corruption is unavoidable to a certain extent . 
  again , i disagree with them , and i have tried to explain my view to other people . 
  in a democratic system , you have to convince a majority if you want to make a change . 
  considering that a very significant part of the population is inherently flawed and inferior is dangerous . 
  refusing to understand them and their reasons is dangerous and unproductive . 
  you wo n't change anyone else 's mind by belitting and denigrating them . 
  he has also said that he would vote against any government that includes podemos , mainly because of their support for a referendum on the catalan issue . 
  who knows , maybe they can let them through if the forget about the referendum ; or maybe psoe , podemos and ciudadanos can pact a psoe government under certain conditions . 
   seriously spain go fuck your elf . 
  that was completely uncalled for . 
  as much as i disagree with the pp , as much as they represent the opposite of what i support and defend , there is people that i love and respect that voted pp . 
  there is intelligent and compassive people that voted pp . 
  it 's ignorant and dangerous to assume that all the millions of pp voters are stupid , evil , selfish , fascists . 
  it 's like those people that think that all the millions that support the independence of catalonia are gullible fools . 
  there are all kinds of people supporting all parties , with or without good reason . 
  when you refuse to understand or acknowledge why someone else has reached a different conclusion on certain political issues , you become a mindless tool for the party/ideology you support . 
  the senate is kinda irrelevant for the legislative process and the day-to-day political life , but it has a lot of power for many other things , especially if you want to reform the constitution . 
  the senate also has significant influence on the judiciay , appointing 1/4th of the constitutional court and half of the cgpj . 
  spain 's situation has nothing to do with greece 's , so we ca n't have a syriza situation to begin with . 
  technically speaking , spain was never bailed out , and the country does n't need eu money to function . 
  besides , austerity was n't really a major issue during the campaign .
