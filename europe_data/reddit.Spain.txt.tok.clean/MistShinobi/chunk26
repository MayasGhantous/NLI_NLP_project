  even among traditional nationalists , i 'm sure most of them would n't sacrifice much of their material well-being for independence . 
  any kind of violence is right now completely impossbile . 
  it would take decades of escalation from both sides to get to a point where this is even conceivable . 
  i agree . 
  i 've always felt extremely sympathetic towards moderate `` bourgeois '' republicans , but the spanish republic was doomed from the start , and leftist organizations share part of the blame . 
  holy shit , i 've just heard the recordings . 
  you should listen to them if you have n't , it 's disgusting . 
  i mean , we all imagine that 's how things work behind closed doors , but actually listening to those two guys is pretty shocking . 
  but that 's a snitch , it does n't have the same connotation at all . 
  the very concept of whistleblowing is completely foreign to our culture . 
  we do n't even have a word for it . 
  well , i did n't want to imply otherwise . 
  i guess i should have worded my comment differently . 
  i 'm not criticizing the utility of any particular project , i was referring more to the fact thet we were so eager to dive into such projects without really knowing how much they 'll cost and without worrying too much about the unexpected events that may affect the project . 
  i understand big infrastructure projects face problems all over the world , but i do n't know , other countries seem more reluctant and cautious about getting into this kind of projects . 
  even in richer countries , it looks like it takes many years to get public and political support to build that huge tunnel or bridge , and sometimes they even have to call a referendum . 
  and budget deviations can be huge scandals , while here it 's just another day at the office . 
  damn are n't we good at spending money we do n't have in crazy infrastructure projects . 
  i do n't want to be misleading or imply that basque is a problem . 
  the truth is that the basque country regularly ranks very highly and often tops national education statistics . 
  they also spend the most per student . 
  disclaimer , i have nothing against basque , basque-only schools and all the efforts to promote basque , but i do wonder to what extent you can say all those people are euskaldun . 
  my mother 's side is from a small village in northern castille , so i know a shit-ton of basque children of castillian parents , included close relatives . 
  the vast majority went to basque-only schools and learned the language , but a lot of them do n't seem to be very competent with the language a few years after school and rarely speak it . 
  quite a few of them struggled a lot in high-school in part due to the language . 
  i also know people who were much more interested and succesful in learning the language . 
  but i only know a couple of people that speak the language to their children and both of them married to native speakers from smaller towns . 
  i 'm aware i 'm speaking from a small sample size , and i do n't claim to know anything about the reality of basque language , i 'm just curious . 
  i know euskaldun technically means basque speaker , but i also hear it a lot to refer a certain identity and i wonder how many of these young guys consider themselves euskaldun . 
  i know another guy from a small town : native basque speaker , both parents ikastola teachers , super-long basque names , the whole nine yards , and he definitely has a different relationship with the language . 
  well , they invented a thing called contraception that lets you have sex without getting pregnant , and if that fails , women can get abortions . 
  and most people stopped caring about what the church says a few decades ago . 
  even those who consider themselves catholic and go to church will have as many children as they plan to , and that may very well be one . 
  the problem is that most young people is affected by unemployment or terrible job conditions . 
  many people in their 20s and 30s do n't have long-term stability to settle down and have children . 
  to be fair , it 's kinda random . 
  for starters , joking about eta is more likely to get you in trouble . 
  in a recent sentence , a spanish judge openly criticized the actions of spanish police forces , as their investigation methods were too random . 
  they often simply search eta and other keywords on twitter , instead of taking into account the following and social impact of the person who made the tweets . 
  also , many judges will automatically exonerate anyone brought to their courts if it was just a joke . 
  but the truth still remains that there are thousands of similar tweets that will never be prosecuted because the courts ca n't handle that many stupid cases . 
  this law was designed to protect eta victims and their families living in small towns where a significant part of the population supported eta 's actions to some degree , though these laws were used to prosecute all kinds of actions , e.g. 
  a welcome celebration for a released terrorist , people writing opinion pieces , ambiguous song lyrics , etc. 
  and little by little , it has come to a point where it 's used to enforce a single official point of view on eta terrorism . 
  i guess it 's kinda pointless to discuss definitions . 
  in my experience , i 've often heard the term civil architecture ( and art ) used as a generic term for non-religious architecture ( and art ) in the context of art history and history of te architecture . 
  especially when discussing this time period , when pretty much every piece of art and architecture was religious . 
  but your definion is also valid . 
  the point still stands , the domus municipalis is a unique bulding and i did n't want to imply otherwise , 
  i do n't know what you mean by `` the only one of his kind '' . 
  the domus municipalis is indeed a unique and mysterious building , but there are a few ( rare ) examples of civil romanesque architecture in iberia , mostly royal and bishop `` palaces '' ( and many have suffered some alterations ) , like the [ palace of the kings of navarre in estella ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/estella-palacio_reyes_navarra_crop.jpg ) or the [ bishop palace in barcelona ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gm6hvzihpji/vy78nzflfji/aaaaaaaaorg/dv7tchp2-jswz0ne-mvathb06a9z7iofwclcb/s1600/dsc_0086.jpg ) . 
  we should take into account the size of the minicipalities , which varies greatly around the country . 
  capital cities and bigger towns tend to be marked red/pink everywhere , but the northwest is split in smaller municipalities . 
  for instance , [ c\u00e1ceres ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/c%c3%a1ceres,_spain ) is the biggest municipality in the country with 1750km \u00b2 ( look at [ this bad boy ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/mapa_de_c%c3%a1ceres_%28c%c3%a1ceres%29.svg ) : that 's almost as big as the [ guipuzcoa province ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/localizaci%c3%b3n_de_la_provincia_de_guip%c3%bazcoa.svg ) ) , while three times more populated [ valladolid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/valladolid ) has a 197km \u00b2 municipality . 
  asturias , galicia and castilla-le\u00f3n are still the regions that are losing the most population , but the representation sometimes makes areas with similar growth look more different than what they are . 
  in the case of spain , i think a very important factor to consider is the strength of our mainstream center-right party ( pp ) . 
  in many european countries , the rise of the far-right is ( to some degree ) a consequence of the inability of traditional center-right parties to address the demands and fears of part of the population . 
  the pp has been very good at maintaining a huge and diverse voter base that goes from the `` socially liberal fiscal conservative '' guys ( some of them now fleeing to * ciudadanos * ) to ultra-nationalist francoist nostalgics . 
  many of their voters have oppossing views on a number of issues . 
  i know pp voters for and against abortion , for and against strong social programs , monarchist and republican , etc. 
  another thing to consider is that the spanish center-right has always found other issues to rile up the far-right nationalists without having to go against eu dogma on immigration and `` multiculturalism '' : eta terrorism in the past , catalan seccession today , the dangerous rise of podemos communists ... even the good old-fashioned gibraltar can always do the trick . 
  ** edit : ** in other words , spanish nationalism has always had a historical enemy in regional nationalism , so an exterior threat is not particularly needed . 
  so for the time being , the anti-immigration , suspicious of muslims , `` franco-was-not-that-bad '' people are still quite happy voting for the center right . 
  i saw [ that movie ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3626742/ ) . 
  and some of us rejoiced . 
  the `` problem '' with forts is that there are hundreds , probably thousands , of historical defensive structures all over europe . 
  it 's not like those meme map posts , where one post per country was usually more than enough . 
  when i visited the city a few months ago , it was clear who used to be the agressor when those structures were built . 
  there was n't really nothing like that at the other side of the border ( badajoz ) . 
  the forts and the city walls are even more impressive from the ground than from the air . 
  i could n't even begin to imagine what it would be like to be told by some stupid general to march into those walls . 
  it 's a really cool visit for anyone visiting extremadura or travelling to/from lisbon . 
  i get where you 're coming from , and there is indeed a certain degree of contradiction , but i think we should try to see past these contradictions if we 're all trying to understand each other a little bit better . 
  when you write stuff like that , it looks like you are trying to avoid their message based on a technicality . 
  i do n't have a dog in the fight , but trasgender rights activists want to promote the idea that a person can identify with either gender regardless of their genitalia . 
  this is an especially sensitive issue for transgender children , because it has become more accepted in western countries to let them live as the gender they identify with , but they obviously ca n't do things like getting surgery , so they are bound to live many years as `` boys with vulvas '' and `` girls with penises '' . 
  again , i am not an activist or an expert , and i do n't have very radical opinions on this issue , but if you think about the message they want to send , this is a good way to do it if you want people to understand . 
  it 's also worth mentioning that this seems to be a campaign by an association of parents of transgender kids , so they probably have different priorities and things they want to focus on than other groups of people . 
  it 's probably a little bit of both . 
  i also wonder if `` available beds '' includes beds that exist but ca n't be used for whatever reason . 
  at least in spain , they had to close entire floors in some hospitals in order to cut down on labor costs due to budget cuts . 
  it 's the same fucking talk , nothing new . 
  just talk , talk , talk . 
  then maybe they 'll call an `` illegal '' referendum . 
  then the spanish government talks a lot , and catalan leaders talk some more . 
  far right radio hosts will say we must send the police to close down the `` illegal '' polling stations , but the government will simply ignore the referendum . 
  then independence will `` win '' ( because people against independence will stay home ) . 
  the spanish pm will make a speech , followed by months of more talk . 
  spanish and catalan politicians will mention the issue in political rallies and tell people they 'll do whatever it takes to stop/achieve catalan independence . 
  but the catalan government will do nothing , despite the `` referendum '' results . 
  i mean , they 'll probably talk some more , and they might even write some declaration ( that they constitutional court will declare unconstitutional , big surprise ) . 
  and a many months later the supreme court will summon a couple of catalan leaders and charge them with `` perversion of justice '' or something like that . 
  of course nobody will ever get jailed or handcuffed ( because that 's what * they * want ) , but some politicians will be banned from holding public office and a new guy will become the next leader and say he will call a referendum and do all sorts of things whether the spanish government likes it or not . 
  ps : i 'm all for letting them have a legal , binding referendum with well defined terms , it 's just that politicians exhaust me . 
  for additional context , the january 5 three kings parade is an event for children . 
  it looks like [ this ] ( http://www.beevoz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/gal_cabalgatareyes2012_1.jpg ) for kilometers and i just shudder to think what could happen if of those crazies got any ideas . 
  i do n't think so , and i 'm almost certain a city does n't have that power in spain . 
  to be fair , that olive tree part includes some very significant wine regions in catalonia , valencia and andalusia , and [ the largest continuous wine-growing area in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_mancha_ ( do \\ ) ) . 
  maybe , but if i were a catalan nationalist i would wonder if the movement is strong enough if rajoy 's passive strategy is all it takes to stop a nation that suppossedly wants to break free , and i would suspect the true motives of the nationalist elite if they are n't willing to escalate the situation . 
  this is becoming groundhog day .
