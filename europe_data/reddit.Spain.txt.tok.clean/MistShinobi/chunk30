  i can totally see him as some sort of mother figure though , leading a list of more controversial , younger people ( kinda like mayor carmena in madrid ) . 
  i do n't think i 've ever lost power in madrid ( other than the main breaker in the building going off for some reason ) . 
  we sometimes lose power in my hometown in the south ( something like a few streets losing power for 5 minutes during a heat wave ) . 
  i only remember losing power for a whole night once , and that was in my mom 's village ( of 300 inhabitants ) because of a summer storm . 
  i do n't know about germany , but in spain the main reason behind party discipline is that the party puts you in your seat in the first place . 
  you can check out [ this wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/party-list_proportional_representation ) on party-list representation . 
  whenever there is an election , each party has to fill a list of candidates for each province . 
  these are closed-lists in spain , that means you just vote for the party and the candidates that are higher on the list will be elected first . 
  if there are 6 seats in a province and the party is very likely to get 2 seats and has chances to get 3 , that means that the party will put someone that they trust and want to win in positions # 1 and # 2 , and people in position # 6 will not get elected ( and if you do n't do as they tell you , you 'll never see your name on a list ) . 
  people vote for parties , so members of the parliament do n't really have to raise their own funds , promise they will do x for the people of the province , or campaign in their province . 
  i mean , they usually do , but it 's about supporting the candidate for president , not about getting people to know you or like you . 
  if there is a parliament majority to elect a prime-minister , that means there is some sort of working majority to get things passed . 
  in spain 's case , if the government does n't have the majority of seats that means that the parliament becomes more obstructionist ( parties are partisan and monolithic , you need full support of another party ) , but at the end of the day , the parties that supported the government are very likely to support the budget and agreed-upon reforms . 
  i do n't care about people misspronouncing place names . 
  if you do n't speak a language i ca n't expect you to be familiar with its phonetics and spelling . 
  the only mildly infuriating thing is people calling barcelona ( the city ) bar\u00e7a . 
  ir even worse , barca . 
  that 's the team 's nickname , not the city 's . 
  by design , the main function of the spanish senate is to strengthen the government , by basically blocking the opposition 's legislative action when the government does n't have a majority . 
  both houses have 50 districts ( the provinces ) . 
  for the parliament , each province elects a number of deputies ( according to their population ) , so a small province will have something like 3-6 seats , while madrid has 36 , and they will all elect deputies of several parties , proportionally to the popular vote . 
  the parliament seat distribution will be kinda proportional to the popular vote . 
  the senate works differently . 
  each province elects 4 senators , and each voter can pick 3 senators ( from the same or different parties ) and the most voted senators get elected , so what happens is that most provinces elect 3 senators from the most voted party and 1 from the second most voted , so a party with 30 % of the vote can get 75 % of senators . 
  the current ruling party has 134 of 350 seats in parliament ( 38 % ) and 149 of 266 seats in the debate ( 56 % ) , so even though they have a hard time passing laws , they can block every opposition law that they want . 
  the senate was designed to protect the two biggest parties from smaller ones ( for stability ) . 
  the main direct taxes are income tax ( irpf ) , company tax ( is ) , inheritance tax ( isd , very controversial because there are ** huge ** regional differences ) and wealth tax ( ip , which is disappearing because it 's counter-productive ) . 
  the main indirect taxes are vat ( iva ) , itp ( mostly real state sales ) and special taxes ( alcohol , gas , tobacco , etc. ) . 
  cities also collect property tax . 
  pretty much every major tax has a complex set of rules to determine rates , deductions , reductions , exemptions , limits , etc. 
  some taxes are collected by the state but regional governments will take a significant part ( e.g. 
  income tax ) . 
  some taxes are `` managed '' by both central and regional government , which creates complex interactions between central and regional tax authorties . 
  most people do n't do their tax returns , and pretty much everyone that does anything other than work for someone else , buy a house and buy stuff will hire a * gestor\u00eda * ( they 're not only tax advisers but also experts in all things bureaucracy ) . 
  the top comment in / r/spain when someone asks business-related questions is : `` get a gestor\u00eda '' . 
  that 's why i said `` first-first '' . 
  in the general scheme of things , life 's pretty good here , but we do n't enjoy the advanced features of premium first-world country users , like trusting your politicians ( especially local !, 
   what an odd question found the first-first world citizen . 
  god bless you . 
  well , we do have some creepy ( francoist ) civil war memorials in many small towns . 
  it 's usually some plaque by the church saying `` fallen for god and for spain : jos\u00e9 antonio primo de rivera ( founder of fascist party falange ) '' , and a list of town people that died fighting for the francoist side . 
  and we do have bigger civil war memorials that were repurpossed ( changing the plaque or something ) as generic memorials for all those who died serving the country . 
  i think ` spaniard ' is incredibly useful if you 're in america , talking to americans , or just in the internet . 
  in many places the word ` spanish ' is ambiguous and may be used to describe anything related to spanish-speaking countries and peoples . 
  nyc is a very popular tourist destination . 
  with some planning and time , it 's not a terribly expensive trip , and you can get by speaking spanish . 
  visiting other parts of the country is a more expensive and rare , and more of a honeymoon/rich people trip . 
  it 's also common for upper-middle class and wealthy people to send their kids to america to learn english ( some do a month , some do a full school year ) . 
  so you must love good omens . 
  i could n't imagine those two could mix so well . 
  turks never were an immigrant group in spain , so if you meet a turk , they 're probably students or professionals from istambul or another big city . 
  but the vast majority of spaniards never met a turk ( unless they visited turkey ) . 
  i 'm not downvoting ( i think it 's a perfectly fine question ) , but i consider donald trump making out with hillary clinton on live tv tomorrow more likely than god . 
  at least i have some evidence that both people and tv exist , and i have great confidence that there is going to be a `` tomorrow '' . 
  in spain , only people who get informed about american politics ** in english ** are aware of the way the americans use the term `` liberal '' . 
  over here , liberal means neoliberal , free-market , deregulation , etc. 
  it 's usually a socially progressive position but not to the extremes of american libertarianism ( fun fact , the term `` libertario '' also has another meaning in spain and is connected to revolutionary anarchism ) . 
  even if `` liberal '' is sometimes defined as `` economically progressive '' , the truth is that left-wing people use `` liberal '' as a dirty , derogatory term . 
  those `` liberal '' positions are only popular in big cities , especially among younger conservatives , professionals and modern business people . 
  traditional spanish business-making is more about connections and cronyism than about free-market and competition , though . 
  some politicians from the ruling conservative party claim to be liberal , and one of the two new emergent parties is socially progressive and economically conservative , but at the end of the day , all parties and politicians support a fairly strong social protection system . 
  i 'm ok with young-educated people defending liberal positions , but i 'm always extremely suspicious of 60 year-old career politicians who claim to be liberal , as their so-called liberal policies are often covert ways to favor their cronies in exchange for future favors . 
   or is the problem that our further left party is more aligned with the european center-right , and is , therefore , also liberal ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  the term liberal used to be linked to progressive positions in the 19th century . 
  it was the reformist position . 
  streets and public spaces are bursting with life here in summer nights . 
  it 's the best time of the day , as it stops being stupidly hot and you can actually hang out outside . 
  19-hour summer days would be a nightmare in many parts of southern europe . 
  i know , i 've had it in america . 
  i was n't clear in my post . 
  i was comparing our customs with those of other european countries , where people eat things like jelly , honey , nutella and other spreads much more often than we do . 
  we 're not that into spreads ( salty and savory ) and just go for cheese , cured meats and cold cuts when we want to fix a quick meal . 
  it literally means `` bread with tomato '' . 
  it 's a catalan dish that you prepare by rubbing some ripe tomatoes on a loaf of crusty bread with some olive oil and salt , generally topped with some cold cuts . 
  sweet spreads are not that common in spain other than some jelly on breakfast toast or some nutella in children 's after-school snacks , and a lot of people do n't even eat those . 
  most of those names come from names of shrines of the virgin mary . 
  some of them are known nationally , but there are a lot of weird local names . 
  for instance , there are lot of women called monta\u00f1a ( `` mountain '' ) where i grew up . 
  people in the surrounding area are aware of the name , but it sounds very weird 200km away . 
  i honestly ca n't answer that , because i 've never experienced that `` bad feeling '' . 
  to me , it sounds like you are speaking about hate and other extreme emotions , and i do n't think that 's a general way we feel about each other . 
  when i was growing up ( in the 90s ) it was very rare to see girls play football . 
  there was one girl in my class who played really well , and though nobody gave her shit for that , she was more of a tomboy and `` one of the guys '' . 
  i know it 's more common for girls to play alongsidw boys at younger ages , and there are some female leagues , but what i see in parks and public courts is 100 % boys . 
  a month ago a female football team ( ages 12-13 ) made [ the news ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2017/04/10/girls-team-wins-male-youth-football-league-in-spain ) after winning their local league , and there was a lot of talk about how girls can play football too and all that . 
  many sports announcers are also living myths here , but they all just broadcast for the whole country in their tv and radio stations , especially in radio . 
  tv announcers tend to be more diplomatic and try to be more removed/unbiased , while radio sportcasts are crazier , have lots of memes and inside jokes and a bigger , more diverse group of casters ( some of whom may take sides ) . 
  about your question . 
  i 've been to america so i know what you mean . 
  in spain , the national public brodcaster has what they call `` disconnections '' , where they might show a few different things ( mostly news programs and local events ) . 
  we also have public regional channels . 
  but there is nothing like that in the private sector . 
  i doubt there is anything like that in europe . 
  public broadcasters often fill that niche . 
  not really . 
  there are a bunch of differences . 
  i think people spend on average less time watching sports on tv than in america , and we have less relevant sports ; most people only watch soccer/football if anything . 
  leagues are relatively small ( often 20 or less teams ) and extremely unequal , so the top 2-4 teams will get the vast majority of fans , and smaller teams will only have a few very dedicated local fans ( and when i say local , it 's often just the city , they may have some fans in the surrounging . 
  lower divisions have zero media presence and we do n't really have college sports like in the us .
