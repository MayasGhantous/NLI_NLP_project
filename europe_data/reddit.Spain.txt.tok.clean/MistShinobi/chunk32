  we are irreverent and disrespecful of public figures . 
  historically speaking , many potential fathers of the nation were taken down by rivals and political infighting long before they could reach that status . 
  in the last few decades , many people have tried to build a new national myth about the spanish transition to democracy in the late 70s , centered around the figures of king juan carlos and our first president adolfo su\u00e1rez , but revisionist views and recent scandals surrounding the monarchy have damaged that myth . 
  i still think they will end up becoming respected historical figures when the decades have passed , because they 're honestly the closest thing we have to father of the nation figures in our sad history . 
  i have lived in a few `` paper-wall '' appartments and i 've heard neighbors doing all kinds of things . 
  leaving aside the obvious ones like children running and couples having sex , i used to sleep in a room adjacent to a fraily old man 's room , and every night , i could hear him fight not to die in his sleep : lots of heavy breathing and choking sounds . 
  that was lovely . 
  for context , what is generally known as the peninsular war in the context of the napoleonic wars is called in spanish the ( spanish ) war of independence . 
  that period is the foundation of several national myths . 
  the discussion of the events usually focuses on how the spanish decided to fight the invasion as a people , and not because some king ordered them to , and not so much on the british military involvement . 
  desert-like might be an exaggeration though . 
  the summer in most of the country is very dry and traditional houses in rural villages used to have very thick solid walls , especially un ground floors ( ~ 2-3 feet in freedom units ) , among other features , so it was comfortable inside . 
  but poor people had to live like that for centuries , so they put up with it at the beginning of urbanization in the 60s and 70s and it took a few decades before ac was considered a necessity rather than a luxury . 
  as i said , it 's not such a luxury anymore ( it 's pretty common now ) and a lot of younger middle class people grew up with it . 
  definitely , every summer . 
  and we have weeks or months of high 30\u00ba 's . 
  i grew up in southern spain , in a house facing southwest with no ac , so i 'm used to simply riding it out . 
  most houses ( depending on orientation ) shut their blinds almost completely ( we use [ this kind ] ( https://i.imgur.com/tvo7btm.jpg ) ) from 11/12am to 8/9pm , even if they have ac , so it 's pretty dark inside during the day . 
  ac used to be kind of a luxury , so most houses built before the 90s and cheaper appartments rarely have it . 
  i 've never lived in a place with ac because i 'm young and i 've only rented the shittiest , cheapest appartments . 
  a lot of people with a more upper-middle class upbringing has grown up with ac though . 
  schools almost never have ac ( i 'd say none ) so our students have very long summer breaks ( from early june to early/mid september ) , and some places have to delay the start of the school year if there is a late heat wave . 
  people just stay inside until 9pm . 
  streets are eerily empty in the summer during the central hours of the day , but when night falls , after a stupidly late dinner ( probably including some [ gazpacho ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gazpacho ) ) , a lot of people go out for a walk or to hang out in some terrace or park . 
  pretty much every tiny bar/cafe has a bunch of tables outside . 
  traditionally , people in villages used to carry chairs outside and hang out with the neighbors [ like this ] ( https://elkalzador.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/20110818113203-vv.jpg ) , and some people still do if they do n't have ac . 
  it 's a great way to connect with your neighbors and extended family and learn about the latest gossips . 
  i would add the [ spanish protectorate in morocco ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_protectorate_in_morocco ) . 
  the rif wars had a huge impact on early 20th century spain , and the heroes of the war became the conspiring leaders of the military rebellion that led to the civil war and franco 's dictatorship . 
  it was also the place were the war started . 
  there are many living spaniards that were born in places like tetouan and tangiers . 
  god , you kids make me feel old . 
  i was playing arcade games and figuring out masturbation in 1997 . 
  * ( inb4 some redditor tells me he had his third child by 1997 ) *, 
  it 's also a cultural thing . 
  a lot of people simply prefer using cash regardless of what the shop/restaurant allows . 
  in other words , a lot of people will only use cards to withdraw cash , or to make a big purchase , even if the shop accepts cards with no minimun . 
  what 's to cover up ? 
  that human rights were not a thing a few centuries ago ? 
  the spanish inquisition was n't particularly worse than any other `` justice system '' of the time . 
  you may want to check [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2gkjr1/why_is_the_spanish_inquisition_associated_with/ckk6uyx/ ) in / r/askhistorians as well as the [ section on torture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_inquisition#torture ) in the inquisition 's wiki page ( or even the whole page ) . 
  civil and religious courts tortured and killed more people in many countries . 
  to be honest , i was surprised to learn about the connotations of the words `` spanish inquisition '' . 
  that 's another reason there is n't any attempt to cover-up or embelish the history if the inquisition . 
  most spaniards are n't aware of the legend that surrounds the institution in the anglosphere . 
  first of all , you should know that in spain , as in many other european countries , there are local police forces . 
  we have : two national police forces , national police and civil guard ( a `` militarised '' police force o [ * gerdarmerie * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gendarmerie ) , similar to forces in other countries ) ; regional police forces in catalonia , navarre and basque country ; and local police forces in big enough towns and cities . 
  local police depends on local authorities and will usually deal with things like traffic , noise complaints , kids drinking in a park , etc. 
   1 ) does having a national police force hurt local policing ? 
  local police forces are usually in charge of most of the local policing and community relations . 
  as far as i know , national police officers are pretty much like other civil servants . 
  when you get your position as a civil servant , there are so many open positions , but they may not be open where you want to go , so you just pick another one and wait a few years until a position in your desired destination opens up . 
  a lot of officers end up in the community they grow up in . 
  there are national police officers that patrol streets and benefit from `` knowing their beat '' , but many officers deal with stuff like terrorism , child abuse rings , international drug cartels , white collar crime , etc. 
  so they 're more similar to fbi or dea agents , and do n't need that kind of connection with the community . 
   2 ) do you think your national police forces are effective ? 
  do you think they police well , and what are your interactions with them like ? 
  national police forces are usually pretty effective , when they want . 
  among other things , they got pretty good at fighting terrorism after decades of experience with [ eta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eta_ ( separatist_group \\ ) ) . 
   3 ) are you at all concerned with the national government having police powers ? 
  i have a lot of criticism for national police forces , but i 'd rather have things the way they are , and work towards increasing police accountability . 
  in spain , the lower you go in the government ladder , the more corruption and cronyism you 'll find . 
  [ lentil stews ] ( http://bocadosrayza.com/images/lentejas.jpg ) can look kinda gross if they 're not common in your country , especially when they 're very cooked and literally look like diarrhea . 
  there are also plenty of entrail dishes in spain , like [ callos a la madrile\u00f1a ] ( http://www.segundosanz.com/images/callos-de-ternera-preparados/segundo-sanz-g1.jpg ) , made with cow guts , but not everyone finds such dishes tasty . 
  you know what those people mean by that . 
  it 's all a projection of how that term ( ` basque conflict ' ) is perceived by the spanish mainstream . 
  using the spanish word ` conflicto ' has different connotations , and those editors are thinking in spanish and treating the issue as it 's treated in spain . 
  but trying to ridicule them in english , saying things like `` apparently such conflict does not exist '' is , in my opinion , slightly misleading . 
  you know that , for better or worse , many spaniards believe that the term ` basque conflict ' legitimizes or downplays eta terrorism . 
  ok ... let 's google the eu unemployment rates in 2016 ... found it !, 
  so , who 's number 15 ? 
  slovenia at 7.6 % . 
  i do n't even want us to be first , or top 5 . 
  * spoken * brazilian portuguese is definitely easier to understand . 
  well , the thing is , many of the guys that belonged to neo-fascist groups were just teenagers that did n't have very strong political ideas . 
  they were mostly angry guys that wanted to belong in a group and pick fights . 
  it was a relatively visible subculture in the 90s and early 2000s when i was growing up . 
  but some of them could be dangerous and sometimes beat up some kinds of people , so you had to avoid certain areas . 
  like in many other parts of europe , they often were involved in football/soccer ultra groups . 
  sometimes even small-town , third-division clubs had tiny ultra groups . 
  people called them nazis but i 've never met anyone who referred to himself as such . 
  they call themselves patriotic and stuff like that . 
  we also had our own local fascist history , so many of them tend to relate more to our national fascist myths and symbols , and be more concerned about the traditional enemies of the spanish far-right than about jews and hitler . 
  i 've very rarely spoken to one . 
  i used to have long hair , and that was enough reason to get picked on by them ( i had to run away from them once ) . 
  i only had a real conversation with one in a bar , we were both ( friendly ) drunk and he told me all about his baby-daughter and how hard it was to take care of her with all these ( insert several racial slurs ) taking all the jobs and social benefits . 
  maybe i 'm getting old , but i do n't really see them anymore . 
  madrid 's subway is great , but do n't dismiss buses so quickly . 
  buses are more difficult to figure out , but they can be a better alternative depending on a lot of factors ; especially in shorter 15-20 minute trips , where time spent walking to the stop/station or transfering between lines makes a bigger difference . 
  maybe i was lucky , but i used to find door to door bus trips all the time when i lived in madrid . 
  i 've seen some foreigners ( usually european hippies ) attempting to hitch a ride , but i 've heard it can take them hours to get someone to stop . 
  it used to be relatively common in the 70s and 80s , especially for young people in rural areas travelling to and from the bigger town to shop/hang out/party . 
  i think spanish families face similar challenges than many other countries in the western world . 
  most parents want to be loving and supportive and all that stuff while still trying to teach some discipline without being too strict . 
  obviously , some parents are `` better '' than others at keeping that balance , but very authoritarian parenting is frowned upon and hitting children is rare . 
  many parents never ever hit their children , but smacking an `` out-of-control '' young child in the bum is tolerated . 
  i worked in exchange student programs in the us for a few years , so i got to know a lot of middle class suburban families from several areas in the country . 
  i 'd say they main differences between the us and spain are : * ** freedom : ** spanish children usually have much more freedom . 
  spanish children tend have more unsupervised leisure time . 
  spanish kids usually do some extracurriculars too , but they usually have more time to just do whatever the hell they want without any adult watching .
