basque rural sports , known as deportes rurales in spanish or herri kirolak in basque , is the term used for a number of sports competitions rooted in the traditional lifestyles of the basque people . 
  the term force basque is used in french . 
   virtually all regional basque rural sports have their origin in the two main historical occupations , the or baserritarra ( farmer ) and arrantzalea ( fisher ) , with a larger percentage hailing from the rural background . 
  the sociological changes in the basque country have led many of these becoming technically obsolete in the 19th and 20th century . 
  few continue to exist as rural or marine activities connected to everyday life and have become rare but many have managed to transform themselves into popular sports instead , some of which have become extremely popular . 
   winners receive a basque beret ( boina or txapela ) as a trophy , hence the basque word for `` champion '' - txapeldun , literally `` one who has a beret '' . 
   betting , both by the competitors and the audience , is very common and popular at such sporting events in the north of spain . 
   correfocs ( catalan pronunciation : [ \u02cckor\u0259\u02c8f\u0254ks ] , western catalan : [ \u02cckore\u02c8f\u0254ks ] ) ; literally in english `` fire-runs '' ) are among the most striking features present in catalan festivals . 
  in the correfoc , a group of individuals will dress as devils and light fireworks . 
  while dancing to the drums of a traditional gralla , they will set off their fireworks among crowds of spectators . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/correfoc besides catalonia , the `` correfocs '' are also held in valencia and the balearic islands like this one in the video .

  well yeah , you are right . 
  any eu citizens can travel to all those places for vacations without any problem , but i think that / u/ionatan was asking is if all those territories have the same status and freedom of movement like the other places in the european union ( to live and work ) . 
  [ according to this table they are part of the european union , but not part of schengen . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/special_member_state_territories_and_the_european_union#summary ), 
  that `` computer emergency response team '' should block windows in all the eu institutions . 
  it 's malware and a nsa trojan horse . 
  you can travel freely within schengen area . 
  that includes the canary islands and i think madeira and the azores ( not sure ) . 
  all those territories in the caribbean and the pacific ocean are not included . 
  they the same as the pp . 
  do n't worry i 've never voted for them . . 
  getting rid of the pp politicians is common sense :p, 
  they should euthanize the health minister ... if they find her : /, 
  oh do n't worry , the president has just spoken on tv . 
  [ he has said there is nothing to worry about , everything is under control . 
  in fact , hard rains and storms a pretty common in barcelona around the end of august/september . 
  they are called `` tormentes d'estiu '' ( summer storms ) . 
  the only meaning of the starred flag , the '' [ estelada ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estelada ) '' , is the struggle for the independence of the catalan nation . 
  i guess that once as a independent country we 'll use the historical flag , the '' [ senyera ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/senyera ) '' , ( the four red bars over a yellow background ) . 
  his/her username means whispering in the catalan language . 
  and for you question , my answer is ... nope !, 
  [ omg !!, 
  the weather is still a little bit hot but the mushroom season is going to start very soon . 
  mushroom hunting is [ very traditional activity ] ( http://www.orangepolkadot.com/my_weblog/2010/11/catalan-traditions-mushroom-hunting.html ) around here . 
  the catalan tv even has very successful [ tv show aired on prime time specialized in mushroom hunting .

  i 've never seen one in barcelona . 
  the first time i saw a woman wearing niqab was the last year in vienna , quite shocking .

   barcino - barcelona ( phoenicians , founded by hamilcar barca , the father of hannibal ) that 's a legend and there is absolute no proof or evidence about that . 
  the older name known is `` barkeno '' written in coins issued by the laietani tribes in the iii century bc . 
  the city as a such is considered founded by the romans as military camp after the second punic war against the carthaginians/phoenicians . 
  hence the name of barcino that it comes from the loooong roman name `` colonia iulia augusta faventia paterna barcino '',

  i guess ] in the video also appears another catalan tradition the `` correfocs '' ( fireruns ) a group of people disguised like demons dancing in the crowd with firecrackers , sparks , smoke and noise . . yeah i know , we are weirdos xd, 
  no idea , i guess the less conservative , less religious and less violent/crime state would be ok . .

  here we eat them raw all the time . . 
  barcelona has a weird love/hate relationship with trams . 
  the first line was opened in 1872 and the tram network had a major growth till the 60 's . 
  then someone in the city hall decided that trams were a dangerous thing to have in a city a big volume of car traffic and decided to close all the lines . 
  eventually the last line was closed in 1971 . 
  it only survived the `` tramvia blau '' a privately owned line that has become a tourist attraction with [ its historic tram cars . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/o3wfnyi.jpg ) then during the 90 's they thought that it would be a good idea to recover trams as a mean of transport so in 2004 [ two new modern lines were opened . 
  we have the [ same kind of buses in barcelona ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xghg96b.jpg ) but only in one line . 
  no tinc res en contra de cap immigrant , vinguin d'on vinguin . 
  man , that girl is clearly south american . 
  andalusian girls ( southern spain ) do n't look like that . . 
  that girl is not spanish . . she looks more like a south american mixed-race ( european and native american descent ) . 
   it 's current form is recorded from 1691 aww that 's so cute . 
  anyway , this is a medieval recipe it does n't have any sense talking about who invented first cause the modern borders did n't apply those days . 
  occitania ( half southern france ) and catalonia we were very close , almost the same culture . 
  we shared a lot of common history , culture , traditions , food , language and rulers ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/occitania, 
   sobrasada germans ! ... 
  errr i mean maiorcans . 
   if you need to look at the difference , you just need to read about the anarchist movement in spain in the 30 's , and in catalonia during the civil war . 
  they were organized and getting shit done right up until uncle joe stabbed them in the back . 
  this is a very interesting documentary to show to those people unfamiliar with anarchism in catalonia and the rest of spain . 
  it makes me feel very proud of our grandparents : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpl_y3qdb7y, 
  [ . . transition ^ to ^ ^ democracy ^ ^ ^ ... demo ^ ^ cracy . . ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ifoqlao.jpg ), 
  i thought you were implying that the republicans are violent people . 
  when the repressive forces of the regime are the violent ones . 
  sorry if i did n't get the joke but all that is happening is completely outrageous . 
  yeaah right !!, 
  do n't tell these police monkeys that he comes from the republic of the united states , cause he probably are going to receive his doses of baton for committing such a big crime . . 
   are you celebrating the fact that their ancestors used to oppress yours ? 
  do you think you are funny or what ? 
  the last time we kicked the king in the ass we had a brutal civil war and 40 years of fascist dictatorship . 
  this royal family was imposed again by the dictator regime after the death of franco . 
  it was something like : you only have two options , us or the chaos ... again . 
  in fact , in those days we also had a `` failed '' coup d'etat to remember the population what could happen without a king . 
  so you arrive to this conclusion watching this video ? 
  lol man lol .
