  the terrorists behind the 11-m attack were somewhat successful because of the election outcome . 
  before the attack , the incumbent popular party led the polls by 5 percent . 
  it is believed that the popular party would have won the election if it had not been for the terrorist attack . 
  the socialist party , led by jos\u00e9 luis rodr\u00edguez zapatero , ended up winning the election by 5 % . 
  the socialist party had called for the removal of spanish troops from iraq during its campaigning . 
  zapatero promised to remove spanish troops by 30 june 2004 , and the troops were withdrawn a month earlier than expected . 
  twenty-eight percent of voters said that the bombings influenced their opinions and vote . 
  a massive amount of 1 million voters switched their vote to the socialist party after the madrid bombings . 
  these voters who switched their vote were no longer willing to support the popular party 's stance on war policy . 
  the bombings also influenced 1,700,000 citizens to vote who did not plan on originally voting . 
  on the other hand , the terrorist attacks discouraged 300,000 people from voting . 
  overall , there was a net 4 percent increase in voter turnout .

  i thought you were talking about [ violant d'hongria ( violant of hungary ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/violant_of_hungary ) . 
  that girl was married with an important king , james i the conqueror . 
  nowadays , every city and town still have a street named in her honour . 
  ps : i had no idea about the nazi issue , that 's sad :-(, 
  catalan flag : the legend tells that guifr\u00e9 el pil\u00f3s ( `` wilfred the hairy '' ) , count of many catalan counties , was helping the frank king carles el calb ( `` charles the bald '' ) to fight the normans and was mortally injured . 
  the king approached the count 's deathbed , and guifr\u00e9 asked him for a coat of arms . 
  the king then soaked all his fingers but the thumb into the count 's open wound , and pressed and moved them down on the surface of a [ golden shield ] ( http://img30.imageshack.us/img30/6460/guifr5wu.jpg ) , thus creating the emblem of the four stripes on a golden/yellow background .

  like [ spain ? 
  ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2012/05/22/inenglish/1337710033_546746.html ), 
  - the resignation of the entire government , and the dissolution of the parliament and the head of state , for betraying the country and the entire citizenry of premeditated , leading to disaster . 
  - the opening of a transparent and democratic constituent process in order to draft a new constitution , with the participation of all citizens , so that you possibly own because we do not recognize any of the current democratic constitution , drafted by a clique to backs of the people , and consecrated the domination of the heirs of francoism and who made a pact with them . 
  it must be the people who determine the model of social organization in which you want to live , and not vice versa . 
  - the audit of the public debt of spain , with moratorium on debt payments until you have clearly defined the items that must be paid by the nation , as they have served private interests who used the country for their own purposes and not of all spanish citizens . 
  we also demand the prosecution of all those who show suspicious of such maneuvers , and to respond with their property in case of being convicted . 
  - the reform of the electoral law with the design of a new electoral process , so that truly represents the will of the people before any election that is necessary to facilitate the development of a democratic constituent process . 
  - the immediate repeal of all the cuts and reforms against the welfare state taken with the excuse of the crisis , and involving restrictions of rights and freedoms of citizens , it is a disaster not only for the country but taxes have been betraying the people 's will . 
  - a deep fiscal reform , to make people pay more to get more benefit of society . 
  we also demand the repeal of the tax amnesty decreed by the government , whose injustice is a real mockery of honest taxpayers . 
  - the abolition of all privileges of those who hold political office or public , and the implementation of effective control mechanisms in the performance of their duties . 
  - the immediate cessation of all evictions , and the provision of the population to social rental price of homes owned by banks and who have been helped by public funds . 
  - the creation of new jobs , the first premise is sustainability , and whose purpose is the development of humanity and consistent management of available jobs so that all citizens can work to live but is not obliged to live to work . 
  it is a huge deception that has to work increasingly fallacy supported by the greed of the big interests and against the interests of ordinary people .
