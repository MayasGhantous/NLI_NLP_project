  who knows , let 's see what happens [ next week ] ( http://www.urban75.net/forums/threads/planned-event-sept-25th-to-occupy-congress-in-spain.298659/ ) , but it seems that political caste and the police are getting nervous about this issue . 
  * sorry , google translation : * [ the government believes that `` occupy congress '' aims to be `` an undercover coup d'etat '' ] ( http://translate.google.es/translate?hl=es&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.europapress.es%2fsociedad%2fsucesos-00649%2fnoticia-gobierno-cree-ocupa-congreso-pretende-ser-golpe-estado-encubierto-20120830110515.html ) [ a socialist deputy ( psoe ) compares the september 25th protest with a coup d'etat .

  berlin . . 
  i love you , even if you do n't love me :-), 
  cool !!, 
  an european [ urotsukidoji ] ( http://youtu.be/ivakelmw_8i?t=9s ) xd, 
  [ spain 's secret conflict ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzijn8eijui ), 
  why not ? 
  :-( cats are funny / r/catvideos /, 
  hey !!, 
  we can have a cat as an emperor :-p, 
  congrats , that 's one small step for man ; one giant leap for mankind :-p, 
  the spanish political and financial class , the judiciary and the media are deeply corrupt institutions . 
  they are a cancer that must be removed for the sake of europe . 
  there is another interesting article written by a german journalist and economist living in madrid ( stefanie claudia m\u00fcller ) . 
  very accurate analysis if you ask me . 
  sorry it 's not in english , just german and spanish ( do n't know if google translate works well between german and english ) . 
  the scars of war are still visible in many places around europe . 
  why on hell we are going to be proud of the soldiers ? . 
  they are just mercenaries , period . 
  a brutal civil war and 40 years of fascist dictatorship are not the kind of things that make you very beloved . 
  thanks :-), 
  just catalonia . 
  we share history and language with valencia and balearic islands but right now they are pro-spanish ( valencia mainly ) . 
  they should choose their own path . 
  haha . . 
  i guess it 's because there are many south american immigrants living in spain ( the poor english skills does n't help either ) . 
  what surprised me it 's the relation with romania , of course there are many romanian inmigrants but they are not so visible like in that map :o, 
  it 's pretty clear you do n't have a clue of what happen here . 
  have you seen the english guy living here comparing the situation with the anti semitism ? 
  seriously , i learned long time ago to hide my born place when i have to travel to spain , it 's the best way to avoid unpleasantness situations . 
  :-( ps : and no , i do n't usually talk about football since i do n't like it at all . 
  if you are from portugal i guess you are familiar with the spanish language . 
  look what the spaniards are saying in this twitter account : https://twitter.com/apuntem another example ( btw it 's interesting to see the full video to understand the situation here ) . 
  exactly , it 's a symbolic referendum . . 
  catalan tv live streaming : http://www.tv3.cat/3alacarta/#/directes/tv3, 
  haha thanks . . 
  believe it or not , i hate football . 
  i 'm a weirdo because it 's like some kind of religion here :-d, 
  yeah , yeah ... we love to see boobies and pussies everywhere in hispanistan . 
  but the first thing is the right to privacy , and in this case it seems there is a crime . 
  well i do n't know , maybe catalans and portuguese people we have a different concept of what a good coffee is . 
  but for sure , american franchises are not the place to find a good coffee . 
  enjoy your next visit to barcelona ;-), 
  it seems that in barcelona you only have visited tourist traps ... a professional tip : do n't go to a foreigner `` dunkin' donuts '' ( or any kind of franchise shit ) . 
  good coffee at starbucks ? 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  xd seriously , you can find better coffee in any simply and anonymous bar than in that awful place . 
  btw , i 'm talking from barcelona , but any bar in spain has better coffee than starbucks . 
  the police ? 
  they are the voters of those assholes . . 
  lol !!, 
  fortunately , we are not asians xd, 
  ~ ~ amen ~ ~ fuck yeah !!, 
  what village are you talking about ? 
  ll\u00edvia maybe ? 
  it belongs to catalonia . . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ll%c3%advia, 
  i knew it !!, 
  were the basque people . 
  america continent is on the outskirts of bilbao city xd ps . 
  sorry , local joke :-p, 
  the same here . 
  besides , you are talking of a really good beer , not like other places serving donkey piss . 
  i love your beers guys :-), 
  unfortunately the spanish government is full of the grandsons of the franco dictatorship , and the army is the same :-(, 
  you 're right , the `` men\u00fa del d\u00eda '' is the only cheap way to eat without going to a chinese restaurant or kebab :-d just available in working days , between 13:00 h to 16:00 h at bars . . 
  barcelona here , you can buy two cinema tickets : - /, 
  half of the ~ ~ working ~ ~ banks ( greek , french and german ) and greeks politicians were basically stealing money for many years . 
  there is no painless way of paying it back . 
  alternative title : the eurozone demands slaves the next will be to work seven days a week for a piece of bread , the eurozone will cry when the greeks rise up in arms . 
  like this one ? 
  :-)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utx6ro8v5sa, 
  genius !, 
  does anyone know if han solo has been robbed ? 
  lol, 
  amazing , no idea about that . 
  i never meet a single person with that problem , but maybe it 's because i 'm from barcelona , norht-east spain and according with that map it seems we have the low percentage here . 
  anyway , uht milk is a relative new thing . 
  i remember when i was child , the only milk available in the supermarket was fresh milk . 
  i do n't know , i guess the reason for not use fresh milk it 's because we do n't use too much in our gastronomie , it 's not very practical in the day by day . 
  i remember when my mother had to boil milk everyday just to make a glass of coffee , honestly , it was a pain in the ass :-d i like fresh milk , but just from time to time , like when i want to enjoy an expensive wine or a good beer . 
  the asians are the lactose intolerant , not us xd, 
  wow !!, 
  can you guys imagine live a war like that ? 
  sometimes we forget the sad history of our continent , even when in many cities around the continent the traces of the war are still visible . 
  do n't forget our history guys , do n't forget . 
  since the greeks invented the fucking word `` europa '' 3000 years ago . 
  illiterate barbarian ... 
  there is not awesome politicians in spain , they all a bunch of corrupted assholes . 
  i started to think the only way to solve this is using the services of madame guillotine . 
  the freedom of a country is way more important than a stupid football match . 
  i 'm pretty sure that if there are big bussines the french will be happy to adopt the barcelona football club into their league . 
  nothing personal dude , business is business . . 
  look dude , it 's late here and i 'm tired . 
  if you are really interested in this subject youtube is your friend . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mt31tcjdsle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqk2wexokzs have a good night . 
  who fucking cares !!!!!, 
  actually , i always been a federalist , but not anymore . . 
  i 'm in full independence mode rigth now ...
