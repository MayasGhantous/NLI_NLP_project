  i 'm not a football follower , i really hate that shit so i have no idea when a country is playing a match . 
  yesterday i heard a lot of fireworks/firecrackers and i suspected that something like this was happening cause the same happened with the spanish defeat against the netherlands .

  there are certain competition between the most prestigious bakeries to see who can bake the most spectacular mona so they can be pretty elaborate and big but mainly for exhibition purposes like this [ formula 1 car ] ( https://imgur.com/pbvz4sn ) , [ these person size toy figurines ] ( https://imgur.com/5ae0ta6 ) , [ this tennis player ] ( https://imgur.com/hycnim1 ) , [ famous buildinds ] ( https://imgur.com/i64kjlx ) ... and so on .

  there are a lot of dishes in the catalan and spanish cuisine that you use olive oil for cooking the stuff with lower temperatures and higher cooking times . 
  frying things looks like a very limited view of the cuisine .

   you put olive oil into a pan and using it to fry stuff ? 
  yes , everybody cook with olive oil here . 
  there are many different categories of olive oil . 
  there are the ones with premium quality specially to use raw in salads and the other ones with less flavour more appropriate for cooking ( it does n't kill the flavours of the rest of the ingredients ),
