  man look those dates , most of them are post war of succession , before that war the participation was merely testimonial . 
  it 's well known that catalans profited a lot with all the companies they funded in the 18th century in cuba and puerto rico ( barcardi anyone ? ) . . 
  but before that ... meh !, 
   he sailed on behalf of castile !, 
  exactly ... and barcelona was the place where columbus met the catholic kings after his first voyage to the americas . 
  so what ? 
  the thing is that we 've never had the same rights than the castillians in all the `` conquista '' thing . 
  basically because we were foreigners to them . 
  anyway , that statue was built in for 1888 universal expo in a city without any charismatic monument at that time since we just throw down the city walls . 
  geez , they also built a replica of the walls of avila ( a la `` las vegas '' style ) . . so :-d, 
   philip ii was called king of spain and portugal and not king of castille , aragon and portugal .

  ... ... ... ... . . blah , blah , blah ... and part of outer space, 
  wrong !, 
  spain did n't exist as a such until 1716 with end of the war of succession and the signing of the `` nueva planta decrees '' in which the aragonese institutions , laws and borders with castille were abolished . 
  sure , the kings of castille and aragon got married in the 15th century and all that , but in fact they never merged both kingdoms to the point that the aragonese people were forbidden to trade , do business or whatever activity with the castillian colonies around the globe .

  nobody likes extreme temperatures either cold or hot . 
  here in barcelona we have a very pleasant temperature most part of the year with an average of 15\u00bac but in august we can reach 30\u00bac easily . 
  believe me if i tell you that that is fucking too much hot for me :d, 
  there wo n't be eu in 20 years . 
  well i don ' think so . 
  my english is not very good but the vocabulary is the easiest part when learning your language . 
  it 's pretty similar to the catalan and spanish ones and i do n't see a lot of `` weird '' words . 
  of course , it can be a little bit tricky cause despite of sharing many words with the same meaning , there are many others that even sharing the same root the meaning it 's completely different . 
  yeah you 're right , the secession of andalusia is a highly improbable event . 
  anyway , i always found it intriguing that [ one of the most stereotyped spanish region also has its own secessionist movement ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=es&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.publico.es%2fpolitica%2f495992%2fel-partido-de-sanchez-gordillo-dice-que-andalucia-no-es-espana-y-apuesta-por-la-independencia ) . 
  related gif animation : [ imperium fail ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9mf3ftx.gif ) lol, 
  are we talking of real coffee or just dirty water ? 
  cause it 's not the same :p, 
  right !, 
  not to mention the deep ties and shared medieval history of catalonia with occitania . 
  alliances , culture , language , traditions ... damn , even [ our most famous king was in fact occitan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james_i_of_aragon ), 
   i had never heard of him , til . 
  oh , he was part of the franco-spanish fleet that participated in the siege of barcelona in 1714 . 
  apparently lost his right arm while he was attacking us https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blas_de_lezo, 
  i really hope that the ecb is paying the copyrights to mrs. cecilia , 
  not enough vodka ? 
  weed it 's not exactly illegal in spain but there is an ambiguous law . 
  it 's allowed the private comsuption , so it 's legal to grown 1 or 2 plants for your personal use . 
  and of course , we also have our own kind of legal coffe shops : http://marijuanagames.org/tag/barcelona-cannabis-clubs/, 
  if i 'm not wrong the city hall is going to spend about 8,5 millions euros in that street . 
  meanwhile they are closing and cutting the budget for hospitals and schools . 
  also , the owner of the company choosen to do this remodelation was sentenced to 2 years in jail for corruption , and this guy it seems is a very good friend of the mayor . 
  so this is why the people is so angry . . 
  not really , the word that brings europe together is '' [ kalandraka ] ( http://ukdataexplorer.com/european-translator/?word=kalandraka ) '' . 
  i 'm glad you all use this fantastic word ^ that ^ ^ i ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ made ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ ^ up, 
   basque actually want to be independent ? 
  it 's even more complicated than that : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nationalism_in_spain but yes , the stronger secessionist movements are the basque and catalan ones . 
   `` poo '' well , the translation of poo is not right . 
  you better try with `` poop '' for a correct answer ( at least in all the languages i know ) , 
  yes , it 's catalan . 
  unfortunately google translate does n't have occitan translation . 
  anyway , occitan is the closer language to catalan , something like galician and portuguese . 
   he seems way more tolerant now . 
  i think this pope is an expert in marketing more than anything else :p, 
  most population in spain is not religious at all , except maybe in southern spain or the elderly people living in rural areas . 
  different history is the government that is now in power . 
  very conservative and catholic : s, 
  hahaha , goats and romanesque art . 
  the country is in the middle of the pyrenees and one of its co-princes is the bishop of `` la seu d'urgell '' , so i guess it has sense :d, 
  do n't forget [ andorra ] ( http://www.coincommunity.com/forum/topic.asp?topic_id=165763&amp; ), 
  well , someone has mentioned the '' [ crema catalana ] ( https://encrypted.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=crema%20catalana&amp;tbs=imgo:1 ) '' . 
  it 's pretty similar to the `` cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e '' . 
  the parties in the catalan parliament tried to reach a consensus about which would be the most suitable question , so in order to not left behind the federalists they chose these ones . 
  said that , only the psc ( the catalan branch of the spanish socialist party ) supports federation with spain ( a state inside spain ) . 
  [ but yeah , it 's a little bit confusing . . ] ( http://imgur.com/quujrid ), 
  yes , i 'm guilty officer . 
  now ... punish me !!,

  if you want to blind an enemy of yours , then google images is your best ally xd, 
  well , she is really fuckable because she 's a pleb , not a borbonic inbreed freak :d, 
  yeah i agree . 
  i 'm from barcelona and we have a very pleasant and mild weather during all the year but in august is too much hot for me . 
  then i visited viena this summer and they have 35\u00bac ... 
  jeez !!, 
  i almost died i sunburned my face and all the thing . 
  back home they were at 20\u00bac :-d, 
   spanish princess ? 
  that sounds sexy [ be careful with your words ] ( http://imgur.com/ukagzx4 ) xd, 
  dat . . what ? 
  i thought that was an american thing . 
  i never had a date it looks super weird and artificial to me . . 
  well , `` forced '' is a big word of course . 
  as you can imagine it there is no police in every house forcing to see him .
