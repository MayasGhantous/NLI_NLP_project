  it is just that the tradition in spain is to have the family christmas dinner with the tv and all the private and public tv channels put the king 's speech . 
  no idea if there is an official order from the royal house but sometimes it really seems so . 
  fortunately the catalan and basque public tvs offer a different alternative . 
  well , there is no need to lie . 
  he is an asshole anyway ... 
  the spaniards do n't have any option , they must watch the king 's speech yes or yes . 
  fortunately the catalans we can choose . 
  obiously i chose not see this corrupt and parasite piece of shit, 
  kill themselves !, 
  here we have a log that shits candies . 
  we also have the pare noel ( father christmas ) but is less traditional and finally the catholic tradition of the 3 wise men on the 6th of january ... 
  spain !, 
  sorry , i read `` what country would you like to see yours ** broke ** a union with ? '',

   now , seriously , i think the colours in most of south europe should be mixed i agree , although unfortunately the most popular brands are nothing more than a donkey piss . 
  the funny thing is that the earliest evidences of beer production in europe , afaik , has been found down here : http://www.pasthorizonspr.com/index.php/archives/11/2013/neolithic-death-ritual-includes-earliest-evidence-european-beer ironically this archaeological site is inside a vineyard property of a friend 's family . 
  i told him many times that they should take advantage of this and start their own craft beer production . 
  not chemicals bro , we 're more into the mushroom scene :-d, 
  you 're right , the caganer . 
  although those ones are very poorly made .

  no idea in other places but for example here in catalonia we have [ `` el celler de can roca '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/el_celler_de_can_roca ) and you have to reserve with 2 years in advance :p, 
  oh , it can be summarized like this : his majesty juan carlos the first , the cunt . 
  yeah i know , but it 's also the time that parents goes to pick up their children at school and take them back at 15:00 pm . 
  unfortunately there is no political will to change this . 
  lately spanish politicians are speaking about changing the timezone , as if changing the timezone would solve anything . 
  we really need the intensive schedule , so we can arrive at home at 17 or 18:00 as other countries do . . this is the most logical measure to be taken and not the stupid midday break and arriving home at 21 or 22:00 : s, 
  it is not siesta time but the lunch break . 
  no one sleep in those ours except maybe elderly people in rural areas and mainly in southern spain . 
  anyway , i 'm against the lunch break , it destroys the productivity and your personal life as a worker . . 
  it came within a cereal box ... 
   really ? 
  how do you guys expect us to be able to top that ?!, 
  ummm indeed , priorat wines are fucking great . 
  unfortunately i have n't found them for that price in my neighborhood supermarkets . 
  there are `` ribera del duero '' wines for about 2 $ in the supermarket . 
  very good quality for that price . .
