  apparently i have a swede inside me ... 
  i feel very confortable with our current timezone , that 's not the problem at all . 
  the problem here is the stupid lunch break at 14:00 that makes people come home quite late , around 21:00 or 22:00 pm . 
  if you change the timezone but not the lunch break nothing will change . . 
  the last job i had my daily schedule was from 8:00 am to 16:00 pm , with no lunch break , and it was a dream come true . 
  that was the first time in my worker life i had time for my personal life after job . . 
  because is fun ... ps : [ here in catalonia we put giant statues taking a dump on shopping centers :-d ] ( http://www.odditycentral.com/funny/spanish-shopping-center-displays-worlds-largest-el-caganer.html ), 
  i 've entered here expecting to see tons of tits and i get tons of vomits . 
  i hate you op :d, 
  haha yeah !!, 
  i saw the light , i 'm the liquorice apostle . 
  god bless the salty liquorice !!, 
  ps : suck that flying spaghetti monster !!!, 
  whoops !!, 
  sorry , my apologies for spoil your language . 
  i knew it was vondelpark , it 's not a difficult name . 
  stupid tiny cell phones : /, 
  haha what an exageration !!, 
  my girlfriend and i bought a bag in amsterdam by mistake thinking it was the normal sweet liquorice . 
  our first reaction was : jesus fucking christ wtf is this shit !!, 
  :-d we get used to that flavour in less of an hour while we were chilling around voldenpark . 
  yeah , we finished the entire bag . 
  i do n't see why . 
  the spanish gypsies , for example , are very proud to call themselves as gypsies ( gitanos in spanish ), 
  also it 's quite surprising he has the title of `` duke of habsburg '' . 
  i mean , he is a bourbon and they always have been archenemies of the hapsburgs xd, 
  well , if i had to judge the northern countries by the behavior of its youth in spain , then i would think that everybody to the north of the pyrenees are uncivilized barbarians . . 
  i do n't know , i 'm not very fan of `` paella '' , i personally prefer the [ `` fideu\u00e0 '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fideu%c3%a0 ) . 
  it 's almost the same but prepared with thin noodles instead rice . 
  yeah i know , i 'm a weirdo :-d, 
   for example , in spain , being an hour late for a personal meeting at a cafe was acceptable , for an average estonian that is absurd . 
  wtf !!, 
  o_o have you ever been here or someone tell you that ? 
  because it 's not true . 
  no one arrives 1 hour later to a meeting with friends . 
  certainly we can be a little more relaxed than in northern countries but the normal wait for personal meetings are around 10 or 15 min and there people just like me that we think that 's waiting too long . 
  of course in bussines/work environment that 's not admisible at all and punctuality is required . 
  the other things you said like the money on the counter at a store , people do n't talk with strangers it 's not much different of what we are used here in barcelona . 
  for those interested , [ cenntenia software ] ( http://www.clockwk.com/ ) . 
  definitely the decoration , that chili and the bowl , looks more mexican than spanish . . 
  i suppose you call it that way because it looks like a [ paella ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paella ) , but i 'm sure that the 99 % of spaniards ( 100 % of valencians ) hardly consider that rice thing a proper paella :d,

  the senyera is an official flag in use nowadays in 4 countries . 
  my flair says `` catalonia '' and afaik is completely right . 
  good night !, 
  are you retarded or what ? 
   the senyera pattern is nowadays in the flag of four spanish autonomous communities ( catalonia , aragon , the balearic islands , valencia ) , and is the flag of the historically catalan-speaking city of alghero in sardinia . 
  it is also used on the coat of arms of spain , the coat of arms of pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-orientales and of provence-alpes-c\u00f4te d'azur , the flag of roussillon , capcir , vallespir and provence in france , one quarter of the coat of arms of andorra , and on the local flags of many municipalities belonging to these territories . 
  the senyera is also used more informally for the catalan language . 
    it is also a synonym ( in catalan senyal reial or senyera and old spanish se\u00f1al real or se\u00f1era ) for royal flag , although the word normally refers to the catalan and aragonese flags . 
  also in aragonese , it is usually referred to as o sinyal d'arag\u00f3n , i.e. 
  `` the sign of arag\u00f3n '' .

  this type of government corruption is often achieved by the embezzlement of state funds .
