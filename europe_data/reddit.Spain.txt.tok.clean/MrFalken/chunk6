  somebody did n't get the memo about supporting free markets , property rights and entrepreneurship ? 
  misunderstood ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  anarchism always has been a left wing ideology . 
  the american right wing freaks stole the word , also the `` libertarian '' one , in recent times but that 's another history . 
  the anarchists differentiate between personal property ( your car , your house and all your belongings etc , etc ) and private property ( land and things that you are not using but the state , with its coercive force , says it 's yours ) . 
  the anarchists we are against the second one . 
  edit : as for free markets and entrepreneurship , we are not necessarily against : * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mutualism_ ( economic_theory ), 
  our local revolutionary ideology always has been the anarchism !! . . 
  communism were a minority ideology in spain before the war . 
  once the war started the communist started to grow due the military and economic aid of the soviet union . . my grandpa was an anarchist , my father is an anarchist , i 'm an anarchist . 
  we are against of communism , capitalism , fascism and parlamentary democracy . 
  the government can do whatever they want . 
  we are going to be always fighting against them .

   roads , ~ ~ trains , airports ... ~ ~ andorra does n't have airports or trains of any kind . 
  the country it 's just in the middle of the pyrenees , so this is can be a little bit difficult . 
  when they need to fly somewhere , andorran people simply use the french or catalan ones . 
  but definetly they have a few kilometers of roads . .

  andorra has been using the euro since the beginning but they did n't had their `` own '' euro coins , until now . . afaik monaco , sant marino and the vatican already had their own coins ( i have no idea about kosovo and montenegro , though ) . 
  i have the impression the people are posting here their knowledge in spanish history instead reading the article . 
  perhaps the headline is n't very clear . 
   ** mi6 spent # 200m bribing spaniards in second world war **  newly released documents reveal secret services paid out fortune in bid to stop franco joining war on hitler 's side, 
   but really , all it was was weapon testing = practice ; of course , `` practice '' ... it sounds so aseptic , is n't it ? 
  \u00ac _ \u00ac ' actually , those bombings were the first raids in the history of modern military aviation on a defenseless civilian population with thousands of deaths and injuries and the cities of gernika and barcelona completely destroyed . 
  ram\u00f3n comes from the germanic name , raginmund : * spanish : raimundo , raymundo , ram\u00f3n * german : raimund * aragonese : remundo , ram\u00f3n * asturian : ram\u00f3n * catalan : ramon , raimon * czech : rajmund * corsican : raimondu * danish : raimund * eslovenian : rajmond * esperanto : rajmondo * euskera : erraimuna , erramun * finish : raimund * french : raymond , raymonde * galician : raimundo , ram\u00f3n * greek : \u03a1\u03b1\u03cb\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 ( raym\u00f3ndos ) * dutch : raymundus , raymond * hungarian : rajmund * english : raymond * irish : r\u00e9amann ... and the list goes on . 
  because the spanish ruling party is really proud to be a bunch of fascists ( but nowadays disguised as `` democrats '' , as they like to call themselves ) .

  nope, 
  do you have that in a rural area ? 
  the fiber optic does n't arrive everywhere and if it 's a dsl connection then you usually have to pay 15 $ extra every month just for the line to the movistar mafia , even if you do n't any service with them . .

  i think you are talking about the old t2 terminal instead the new one . 
  that terminal became outdate to absorve the amount of passengers . 
  today it 's only used by a few low cost airlines and national flights , obviously it looks empty . 
  nowadays the most flights arrive to the new t1 . 
  in 2012 had a traffic over 35 million passengers , sorry but that 's not an empty airport , it 's the 9th busiest airport in europe . . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_busiest_airports_in_europe, 
  yeah , it 's likely not to be an accurate map . 
  i 've found it in another subreddit . 
  the catalan and spanish words are right , though .

  without a doubt today is the most beloved festivity for catalan people ( despite it 's a working day ) . 
  it 's a very cultural day with all those famous writers signing books on the streets of barcelona and everybody giving books and roses to each other . 
  it 's really special .
