  probably they took the word from the italian word `` borgo '' . 
   the word borough derives from common germanic * burg , meaning fort : compare with bury ( england ) , burgh ( scotland ) , burg ( germany ) , borg ( scandinavia ) , pori ( finland ) , burcht ( dutch ) , and the germanic borrowing present in neighbouring indo-european languages such as borgo ( italian ) , bourg ( french ) , burgo ( spanish and portuguese ) and purg ( kajkavian ) . 
  the incidence of these words as suffixes to place names ( for example , canterbury , strasbourg , luxembourg , edinburgh , hamburg , gothenburg ) usually indicates that they were once fortified settlements .

  excuse me ? 
  the people on the streets are protesting for many reasons but one of them is because are against of bailouts of any kind that only serve the interests of the spanish oligarchy . 
  all those bailouts means economic slavery for the rest of our lives , even to those we 've never been involved in the fucking housing bubble and we 've never asked for a mortgage or a credit to a bank .

  http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/03/14/inenglish/1363264199_406548.html  one of the anomalies of the current law in spain is that if a homeowner fails to meet a single monthly mortgage payment , the bank can initiate accelerated proceedings to evict the borrower and take possession of the property . 
  even if the borrower alleges the contract he has signed is abusive and a court agrees with him , if the eviction has already been carried out the homeowner has the right to compensation but not the right to recover the property . 
  the bank can also ask for full repayment of the loan even after obtaining possession of the property in question .
