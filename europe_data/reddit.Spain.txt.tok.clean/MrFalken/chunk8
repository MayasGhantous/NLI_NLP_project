  what about if we join this pope thing with eurovision ? 
  we are in crisis , cuts are needed . . 
  you win :-d, 
  facewhat ? 
  i canceled my account 3 years ago . . :p, 
  he 's not the only one :-d http://imgur.com/f1gphf3, 
  here there is an animation : http://youtu.be/18hu5eil0y8 if the calculations are wrong at least will be the end of the crisis xd, 
  how disappointing bruce willis , you are not my hero anymore !!, 
  glad to hear about this project , the catalan farmers started a similar project 4 years ago : [ fftf ( fiber from the farms ) ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/guifi.net-bottomupda20201.pdf ) their optical fiber network is connected to [guifi.net ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guifi.net ) , the largest wireless network community in the world . 
  the network is self-organized and operated by the users using unlicensed wireless links and open optical links . 
  and this is a great complement to this map , the pardonmeter : http://www.elindultometro.es/famosos.html ( sorry , not in english ) the politicians and their bankers friends rob without limit and the same politicians concede pardons to themselves and their friends ... and magic !!, 
  no one go to jail ! . 
  hispanistan is lovely , is n't it ? 
  haha i do n't think so , but i 'm sure he will enjoy a lot [ the local bagpipes folklore ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ct62ryxah4 ) :-d, 
  you know , the old [ `` panem et circenses '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bread_and_circuses ) tactics spanish version : football , bulls and trash tv . . 
  the difference is that day by day more people do n't have any bread to eat and the circus is becoming more and more pathetic ... 
  before the ban the only people you see waiting in line those bullfight places were tourists . 
  i 've the impression it 's also the same in other parts of spain , except maybe the southern spain or madrid . 
  ... but without animals , just politicians and bankers . 
  just beautiful : trollface :, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0usjceugwym :-d, 
  like other european countries , there is no tips here . 
  it 's a costumer voluntary thing when you are happy with the service . 
  i do n't considered this is a joke , i 'm not defending the catalan politicians here . 
  all the politicians in the the whole fucking iberian peninsula are motherfuckers thieves ... included the catalan ones . 
  the spanish politicians do n't know what the word `` dimitir '' ( resign ) means . 
  they think it 's a kind of russian name ... 
  this is the first time i hear that not having children is a social stigma , not here at least . . 
  hey , i 'm a time traveler and i have [ a picture for you . 
  fucking rajoy , what a pathetic coward !!!, 
  did you like it ? 
  :-) if you get tired of the autechre 's abstraction , there 's also more conventional music that perhaps you could find interesting . 
  in the electronic dark scene , for example , you could find things like these : [ covenant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qixihamcku ) [ haujobb ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da6dzyhb6so ) [ vnv nation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?nr=1&amp;v=ftyxk_pfmtw ) [ and one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxcnti-tyb8 ) ... 
  i do n't know , there are a lot of variety , just browse among the related videos to find the music you liked more . 
  enjoy :-d, 
  not really , i discovered this guy a few months ago but i think his sound is not very usual nowadays among other producers . 
  he has a very strong influence from the [ old belgian techno scene from the 90 \u00b4 s ] ( https://vimeo.com/26148934 ) ... yeah , i know this video is very stupid but the old school sound is great :-d, 
  aww ... the human being is a very creative species :-d, 
  [ andorra flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_romania ) [ romania flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_andorra ), 
   at first i did n't understand the joke in this ... [ facepalm ] ( http://www.bigshinyrobot.com/reviews/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/picard-facepalm.jpg ), 
  that 's not weird stuff at all , it 's just mainstream shitty music . 
  anyway if you are curious about european electronic music there a lot of `` weird stuff '' ( if you are not used to listen this kind of music ) : [ alva noto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raasxo9u8ta ) [ geistform ] ( https://soundcloud.com/geistform/vector ) [ byetone ] ( https://vimeo.com/6872735 ) [ autechre ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1rrva_axry ) [ gesaffelstein ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fytpobvmyy4 ) [ dark vector ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkbxfgofg1y ) ... 
  knowing those bastards scumbags , amnesties for everyone ... as usual : - /, 
  oh , i forgot city folk , it 's also aired on catalan tv . . 
  the catalan tv has a show called '' [ blog europa ] ( http://blogs.tv3.cat/skins/blogeuropa/mapa.htm ) '' . 
  it 's made by erasmus students and shows the culture , traditions , or curiosities of four european cities in every program . 
  then , there 's another show called '' [ afers exteriors ] ( http://www.tv3.cat/afersexteriors ) '' ( something like `` foreign policies '' or so ) . 
  it 's shows the life of catalan people living around the globe not just europe . 
   they have wikileaks in iceland ? 
  who would even set up an internet connection for a bunch of volcanoes and glaciers ? 
  [ wikileaks has a lot to do with iceland ] ( http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/17/victory-for-wikileaks-in-icelands-parliament/ ), 
  then , you can pay his whores with your money if you want . 
  that son of a bitch soon or later are going to pay for his crimes . 
  well done . . 
  berlin , it 's way cheaper than barcelona :p, 
  they 're extremely popular in hispanistan :-p  spain in particular now has a quarter of all these high-value bills within its borders . 
  [ 20 ] this is far more than expected for an economy of its size and they are rarely seen in every-day commerce -- they have been nicknamed `` bin ladens '' by the populace ( as everyone knows they are there and what they look like but they have never seen them ) . 
  [ 22 ] british and spanish police are using the bills to track money laundering . 
  [ 20 ] [ 21 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/500_euro_note#crime, 
  [ who designed that bill ? 
  cecilia ? 
  ] ( http://blog.cocacola.es/images/2012/11/eccehomo_1.jpg ) :-d, 
  monaco it 's a country for the super-rich , except for gerard depardieu . . [ he does n't fit within the country ] ( http://www.laregion.es/resize.php?pic=imagenes/elementos/181_20130106-634930607853198868.jpg&amp;tipo=350 ) xd . 
  that drawing is not ours , the catalans have good aesthetic taste and graphic design is in our genes but you ca n't understand our language . 
  anyway , paint is a privative software from microsoft , the anarchists only support open source . 
  :-d good night . 
  maybe [ marvel comics ] ( http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2011/11/magentos-house-of-m-uniform-again-draws-royal-objections/ ) xd, 
  [ the dead ones . . ] ( https://lh3.ggpht.com/-8ssfitk16e8/ty4mxtjo0ei/aaaaaaaacim/cwasmodfxnw/s1600/nogod_nomasters_anarchism.sized_.gif ), 
  a good european movie ? 
  well , this summer i went to the theather to see [ `` hodejegerne '' ( headhunters ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pd_vr3akcxi ) . 
  it 's from norway and it 's a really good movie . 
  ps : no , i do n't speak norwegian :-d, 
  we left the sperm in a rock , then the women come to pick it up . 
  the male with the stronger sperm will be the chosen one to get marry with her . 
  he 's a spanish inmigrant living in finland . 
  maybe i 've not been very accurate . 
  what i wanted to say is that seems that the only ones who still care about the church is certain social class like the inheritors of the old catalan bourgeoisie and their conservative party . 
  the most part of society it is not specially religious . 
  what do you mean suddenly ? 
  i 've never met a religious person here in catalonia . 
  most people here do n't give a fuck about religion . 
  it 's a matter of old ladies and rich people . 
  futhermore , in barcelona we have an extensive and long history burning churches : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tragic_week_ ( catalonia ) xd, 
  mass ? 
  what 's that ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  you are comparing different languages . 
  rodriguez is a spanish surname ; nadal is a catalan surname . 
  bon nadal :-d, 
  oh , thanks for the clarification . 
  well ... [ something like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kox2xt1ix8 ) \u0ca0_\u0ca0 :-d, 
  haha yeah , you are right . . 
  surprise !!, 
  the last name of that guy means christmas !, 
  ** iberian peninsula : ** * portuguese : natal * galician : nadal * catalan : nadal * spanish : navidad  what the hell is wrong with you ? 
  xd ps : i do n't count the basque name `` gabonetako '' because it 's not a romance language like the other iberian languages . 
  polish ^ 2 :-d, 
  let 's see ... ~ ~ spain ~ ~ , ~ ~ france ~ ~ . . ummm with no one !, 
  p.s : well maybe with our little buddies , andorra . 
  it seems that came from the proven\u00e7al language .
