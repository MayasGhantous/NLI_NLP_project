   in the south , it 's very common to start talking to other people in the public transport . 
  i do n't think so . 
  maybe it 's true in little villages in the middle of nowhere , or something like that . 
  here in barcelona city if you try to start a conversation with a stranger at the metro or bus , people will think you are crazy :-d, 
  lol !!!!!!, 
  xd i thought that the greeks did n't believe the eu/ecb propaganda . 
  dude , the situations is critical , the country is worst than ever . 
  meh , nothing new these are the usual summer jobs .

  it reminds me of that festival here in catalonia where [ satan ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jjav5pk.jpg ) [ ejaculates over the crowd ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4cy2ris.jpg ) . 
  i agree . . for some reason berlin reminds me a lot to barcelona , i guess because the first time i visited berlin it was summer , the artistic vibe everywhere , the techno parties etc. . 
  i felt like home , 
  we do n't have any mosques in barcelona but the architecture here is pretty varied : from roman , to romanesque , to gothic , to modern glass and steel buildings ... 
  however , the most characteristic architectural style of barcelona is `` modernisme '' , our own version the art nouveau . 
  [ this is a good summary ] ( https://youtu.be/mutmlugwrp8 )  [ or something like this one , a very unique tradition ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd2fsst4mdg ), 
  that 's not an historic tittle , that will be the kingdom of majorca and that belongs to the king of spain since they abolished the crown of aragon in 18 century . 
  spanish : holanda and/or pa\u00edses bajos ( low countries ) . 
  ups , sorry dude : / i did n't want to envolve politics in this . 
  next time i just put `` valencia '' instead and each one choose the political administration they pleased . . 
  i have n't read the books so i have no idea what kind of location they need . 
  but according to the fans [ comments ] ( http://watchersonthewall.com/game-of-thrones-scouting-girona-spain-for-season-6 ) the girona old town and the cathedral fit perfectly . 
  let 's see ... 
  i know the ones at home . 
  they are going to film in girona ( catalonia ) and in pe\u00f1iscola ( in castellon , valencian community ) . 
  the one in girona still not clear if they are going to film in [ the old town of girona ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/girona#main_sights ) or also in [ other locations ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u93fwma.jpg ) [ around the province ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aykjptr.jpg ) . 
  the one in pe\u00f1iscola is probably [ the former templar castle . 
  nope . . 
  andorran modern history has some funny moments :  on july 12 , 1934 , andorra 's monarchical system was challenged by an adventurer named boris skossyreff , who issued a proclamation in urgel declaring himself `` boris i , king of andorra '' . 
  though initially enjoying some support within andorra 's political establishment , he was ultimately arrested by spanish authorities on july 20 of that year after declaring war on the bishop of urgell ( who had refused to relinquish his own claim to the principality ) . 
  skossyfreff was expelled , and was never considered to have been the andorran monarch in any legal sense . 
  also andorra has been officially at war against germany till 1958 xd https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andorra#20th_century  andorra declared war on imperial germany during world war i , but did not actually take part in the fighting . 
  it remained in an official state of belligerency until 1958 as it was not included in the treaty of versailles . 
  who cares ? ... 
   also , it 's 15.30 and the president has n't spoken yet .

  i guess those that answer they are religios is because they see religion like something cultural ( festivities and all that ) rather than spiritual .

  :p absolutely , but we were talking within this [ sub-thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/32jvk1/gibraltar_suggests_it_wants_to_stay_in_eu_in_the/cqby5bc )  bear in mind that even in the southernmost part of the peninsula they have their famous [ ski resorts ] ( http://en.sierranevada.es/ ) . 
  yeah those map are very generic . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subtropics#/media/file:subtropical.png see ? 
  the iberian peninsula it 's not in a subtropical area . 
  i know you guys are n't familiar with the spanish weather outside the touristic areas ( the mediterranean coast and the islands ) but [ it can be quite cold and snowy in winter in the interior of the peninsula and in all the mountains ranges .

  iber what ? 
  lol never gon na happen xd, 
  probably because that 's exactly what the pp government said to the public opinion to remain in power http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_madrid_train_bombings#conspiracy_theories  conspiracy theories   sectors of the people 's party ( pp ) , and certain media , such as el mundo newspaper and the cope radio station , [ 79 ] continue to support theories relating the attack to a vast conspiracy to remove the governing party from power . 
  support for the conspiracy was also given by the asociaci\u00f3n de v\u00edctimas del terrorismo ( avt ) , spain 's largest association of victims of terrorism . 
    these theories speculate that eta and members of the security forces and national and foreign ( morocco ) secret services were involved in the bombings . 
  [ 80 ] [ 81 ] defenders of the claims that eta participated in some form in the 11 march attacks have affirmed that there is circumstantial evidence linking the islamists with two eta members who were detained while driving the outskirts of madrid in a van containing 500 kg of explosives 11 days before the train bombings . 
  [ 82 ] the madrid judge coro cill\u00e1n is continuing to hear conspiracy theory cases , including one accusing government officials of ordering the scrapping of the bombed train cars in order to destroy evidence . 
  [ 83 ]   the public seemed convinced that the madrid bombings were a result of the aznar government 's alignment with the u.s. and its invasion of iraq .
