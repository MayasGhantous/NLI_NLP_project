in spain it used to be great , 13 , until this summer . 
  why did they have to change it ? 
  nothing bad happened . 
  italy ? 
  why ? 
  well they are one of the most voted parties and last year they won mandate in an individual constituency . 
  but yes , they wo n't get into power in the near future . 
  my problem with them is not that they have a different opinion . 
  their main campaign is about discrimination . 
  hate . 
  they 're antisemitic . 
  they 're racist . 
  they 're homophobic . 
  they 're holocaust deniers/advocates . 
  and it means 20 % of hungarians agree with them . 
  they believe that the most important thing when electing a leader is that he hates other races . 
  about 20 % of hungarians believe that hungary 's biggest problem are jews or homosexuals . 
  that is disturbing , if you ask me . 
   you are that stereotypical elitist jerk who hates hungary because '' hurr durr dictatorship muh progressive values i will move to the western paradise '' i do n't hate it , i just thing there are many things wrong with it . 
  and i am aware that western europe is not a paradise . 
   you think you are some intellectual enlightened entity and this country is too plebian for you . 
  no i just think that if i could easily move to somewhere where my life will be easier , why not ? 
   move to london where less than half of the population is british , where i 'm moving 85.5 % of the population is local , if that 's what you mean . 
  ( compared to 92.6 % of budapest )  also the previous government was 10 times worse , whether you admit it or not ( and you wont because muh leftist values , a.k.a. 
  give everything to the banks and use police brutality against protesters ) , so do n't blame it on orban . 
  the previous one was pretty horrible but i would say orb\u00e1n takes the cake . 
  and i 'm not leftist at all , i 'm right-wing . 
  i 'm just not a borderline-nazi like jobbik . 
  my problem is not that orban is right-wing , my problem is that he is corrupt to the core , authoritarian , statist and a populist demagogue . 
   in an infamous speech to supporters in romania in july , he declared the western model dead and cited the authoritarian regimes of russia , china , turkey and singapore as the templates to follow . 
  `` we are parting ways with western european dogmas , making ourselves independent from them , '' he declared . 
  `` we have to abandon liberal methods and principles of organising a society . 
  the new state that we are building is an illiberal state , a non-liberal state . '' if you do n't think this is dubious then perhaps we should just agree to disagree . 
   you probably have n't realized that both jobbik and its supporters are a mixed bag . 
  it 's not like jobbik would be the nsdap of the 21th century even if some of their high ranking members are nwo believers . 
  if high-ranking members can say that without any consequences , it means it 's more or less the official belief of the party . 
   if you think so lowly of the country , you might stop ever talking hungarian in your new paradise , and might as well stop identifying as a hungarian . 
  no need to feel ashamed , you can forget it . 
  i do n't think any country is a paradise and i wo n't stop talking hungarian . 
  it 's a pretty language . 
   yeah , poor hungarians who care not only about themselves and actually can stand blaming their misery on an abstract concept such as `` that country '' . 
  got ta love self-proclaimed wise guys who see into the future and can declare countries dooooomed . 
  please feel free to make the us/uk a better place by adding your unique snowflakiness to the potpourri . 
  i am not miserable and i would not blame it on my country . 
  all of them are terrible , but if i had to choose at gunpoint , mszp . 
   hungary is on a level of a shitty african country and hundreds of people starve to death weekly . 
  i never said that . 
  there is a difference between a neonazi party and a party having a number of neonazi fans and/or members . 
  well ...  on the eve of the 2009 elections to the european parliament , a comment was posted on an unofficial and unverified hungarian political internet forum , allegedly in the name of krisztina morvai , who then headed the party 's electoral list . 
  addressing their remarks to hungarian jews the comment poster stated that they `` would be glad if the so-called proud hungarian jews went back to playing with their tiny circumcised dicks instead of vilifying me . 
  '' [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] news of this comment , which has been roundly condemned , [ 73 ] spread rapidly around the world [ 74 ] [ 75 ] and eventually even featured in an article by the economist . 
  [ 76 ] morvai 's critics have pointed to her refusal to even discuss the issue , [ 77 ] let alone deny it ; [ 78 ] implying that this is sufficient to unquestioningly ascribe authorship of the remarks to her . 
  [ 79 ]  during spring 2012 , jobbik representative in hungarian parliament zsolt bar\u00e1th caused an outrage by commemorating 1882 blood libel against the jews in parliament . 
  the tiszaeszl\u00e1r blood libel , found later to be unrelated to jews , was known as first major anti-jewish event in modern hungary , predating the holocaust . 
  [ 85 ]  in november 2012 , the party 's deputy parliamentary leader , m\u00e1rton gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6si , posted a video speech on the jobbik website in which he stated : `` i think such a conflict makes it timely to tally up people of jewish ancestry who live here , especially in the hungarian parliament and the hungarian government , who , indeed , pose a national security risk to hungary . 
  '' [ 86 ]  in 2014 tibor \u00c1goston , the deputy chairman of jobbik 's debrecen and hajd\u00fa-bihar county organization , referred to the holocaust as the `` holoscam '' . 
   on 4 may 2013 , jobbik members protested against the world jewish congress in budapest , claiming the protest was against `` a jewish attempt to buy up hungary '' . 
  [ 95 ] jobbik mp enik\u0151 heged\u0171s vociferously condemned both israel and jews at the rally as her husband , l\u00f3r\u00e1nt heged\u0171s jr. , stood nearby . 
  [ 96 ] an ordained minister in the reformed church in hungary , l\u00f3r\u00e1nt heged\u0171s himself had served in the national assembly as an mp of the far-right nationalist hungarian justice and life party from 1998 to 2002 . 
  [ 97 ] he invited holocaust denier david irving to his budapest church in 2007 as a `` special guest '' , [ 97 ] and has also been accused of anti-semitism on several occasions for statements he has made about jews at jobbik events . 
  at a 2011 rally , he claimed that jews orchestrated world war ii and controlled the international media , [ 98 ] and a year prior had alleged that the hungarian government was secretly cooperating with mossad to facilitate an israeli takeover of hungary with the assistance of hungarian jews and mainstream churches . 
  [ 99 ] after his wife 's statement regarding the world jewish congress , the reformed church launched an inquiry into the minister 's conduct , with presiding bishop guszt\u00e1v b\u00f6lcskei denouncing heged\u0171s 's activism for jobbik as `` permanent provocation '' which was incompatible with scripture . 
  [ 96 ]  in april 2012 , jobbik tried to introduce a bill into the hungarian parliament that would change the national constitution to allegedly `` protect public morals and the mental health of the young generations '' by banning the popularization of `` sexual deviancy '' . 
  the legislation was drafted by party spokesman \u00c1d\u00e1m m\u00edrk\u00f3czki . 
  this was to target `` homosexuality , sex changes , transvestitism , bisexuality and paedophile behaviour '' . 
  the proposed amendments would criminalise anyone who `` popularizes their sexual relations -- deviancy -- with another person of the same sex , or other disturbances of sexual behaviour , before the wider public '' . 
  the penalty would be three years in prison , or five years if ` popularizing ' is done in front of minors . 
  the draft legislation ultimately failed to pass . 
  if it 's nazi or not is semantics at this point . 
   but if you think that this country is such a `` shithole '' than stop complaining and shittalking about it and gtfo to london or new york . 
  i 'm going to do that in a few months . 
  good luck staying in your sinking ship . 
  at least six more years of orb\u00e1n must be great . 
  hungary , where i live , is pretty much a shithole . 
  not the worse , but it has some serious problems . 
  orb\u00e1n is like a mafia and he is slowly building up a dictatorship . 
  the second most voted party , jobbik , is literally a neo-nazi party https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jobbik . 
  48 % of hungarians live in poverty http://www.tarki.hu/hu/news/2013/kitekint/20131028_szegeny.html . 
  eu money and a mercedes factory almost single-handedly make hungary 's gpd . 
  i guess if you live in a little bubble any place can be fine , but for the average citizen it 's not as good . 
  i live there , i know my fair share . 
  of course , i 'm sure life is great under orb\u00e1n or zeman . 
  is n't it usually the other way , though ? 
  teenagers nowadays speak more languages than their parents and grandparents ? 
  unlike the cultured polyglots on the left , eh ? 
  conservatives are all dumb bumpkins , am i right ? 
  we comprehend him we just do n't like that he 's pretty much a little gangster . 
  there are normal alternative parties , i never said you have to vote the same thing . 
   yes , and they plan to do that how ? 
  they control exactly zero of the mass media . 
  ... just like any dictator or authoritarian leader before he gets to power ? 
  if they do what they plan to do then it 's absolutely possible . 
  even if not , so what ? 
  do n't you think it 's bad enough that they want to ? 
  you should n't be discussing the legal technicalities , you should be straight out against anybody who wants to !, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydcnmmloyws https://youtu.be/iibjiwlcvkm?t=75 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjevbe3dl4q their mass media policy , the refer\u00e9ndum revocatorio , wanting to end with the congress , that 's all tools to achieve that !, 
  do you hate the king so much that you 'd rather have that ? 
  oh , so he wants to do terrible things , but since you feel like he does not have the power to do them you still support him ? 
  what sense does that make ? 
  there are small neo-nazi parties in spain like democracia nacional , and i know they ca n't have any power whatsoever but that does n't mean i 'll support them !,
