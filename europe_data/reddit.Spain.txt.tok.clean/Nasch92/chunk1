it would be such a pity if we had allowed to sprout a society in which governments do not possess proper means to prevent private companies operating worldwide from swindling and cheating states . 
  from what i have read about the catalonian referendum , it appears it has been stated by certain key politicians within the eu that catalonia would not be allowed to go on being a member of the union after the independence process , which sounds one-sided if we take into account what was said about the scottish referendum following the brexit . 
  i wonder which features are assessed when it comes to deciding if a country that followed a secession procedure should or should not belong in it . 
  i do n't care if pablo thinks venezuela is a good example . 
  the current system is putrid , toxic and unequal . 
  i know for certain that nothing will change if pp or psoe get elected again so it is quite comprehensible that people are looking for a drastic change . 
  income inequality , high unemployment , precarious jobs , poverty , corruption . 
  podemos seems to have a very healthy set of ideas , so why not give them a chance ? 
  we ca n't ? 
  do n't you have friends to tell you how things are ? 
  ca n't you see for yourself ? 
  the thing is good things are n't really happening to the poor . 
  that 's exactly what you implied, 
  `` impartial '' ? 
  what are the sides ? 
  rich as fuck and everyone else ? 
  maybe they should speak about how pretty a lamborghini looks in your penthouse garage . 
  ana mato , it seems, 
  well , you know who the winner is anyway . 
  100 years ... 
  socially , turkey still has to make some adjustments . 
  [ 42 per cent of turkish women report having experienced physical or sexual violence ] ( http://www.equaltimes.org/turkeys-women-take-on-gender-based-violence?lang=en#.vdaii_mswso ) and [ there is widespread discrimination towards lgbt people in turkey ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_turkey ) . 
  this might sound rash , but , broadly speaking , i do not think they have this sort of european spirit that we all share in the eu . 
  it 's ok , he 'll apologise when he needs us and our sunny islands to get drunk and [ throw himself off a balcony ] ( http://www.thinkspain.com/news-spain/24484/two-british-tourists-in-ibiza-hospital-after-balcony-falls ) . 
  since everyone is panicking around here and i do n't want people to shout `` zombie '' at me when walking through the streets of amsterdam . 
  i 'll just leave this link here : http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2hb0pb/statistically_what_are_my_chances_of_getting_ebola/, 
  i 'm not even sure if you guys are being serious . 
  it 's just one person and most of the people who are treated in developed countries survive . 
  well , actually , except those two priests who were treated in spain ... 
  by `` they '' i meant laissez-faire apologists . 
  wow , they 're trying really hard to make it seem like france 's anti-austerity policy has left the country in shambles . 
  but we still win when it comes to unemployment and organ donations per capita . 
  i giggled and felt considerably proud when i read my city ( granada ) is amongst your favourites  * dale limosna , mujer , que no hay en la vida nada , como la pena de ser ciego en granada . 
  exactly . 
  i hate when people talk about the 2nd spanish republic like it had been an ecomomic failure promted by a communist regime . 
  nobody mentions the great depression , nobody mentions that the liberal right-wing party and the social-liberal left-wing party were amogst the most voted and that the anarchists and the communists only represented a small proportion of the electorate . 
  exactly , that moustache radiates some good * joie de vivre * . 
  op will surely deliver, 
  it was the thirties !!, 
  the economy was bad from the beginning till the end and many years after . 
  there was a liberal conservative period within the 2nd republic . 
  there was a strong right party throughout the 2nd republic . 
  it is within the second republic that women were allowed to vote for the first time . 
  spain was forced to choose sides . 
  the 2nd republic was following a purely democratic approach focused on the idea of intelectualism and the will of turning spain into a modern country . 
  edit : grammar, 
  equally bad ? 
  democracy versus totalitarianism ? 
  or are you gon na come tell me that boring conspiracy theory about how spain would have become a communist regime had the republican side won ? 
  i am quite sure they will have their own state . 
  it just has to be done through democratic means and when the fruit is ripe . 
  we have been told many times how economically unstable the situation would become for both countries if the independence took place within the current context . 
  i think the consultation ( this is what it is , not a referendum ) should be carried out as planned in order to know what people in catalonia think . 
  only then , if the yes won , a proper date should be chosen to make sure we have a smooth transition . 
  would they really like mas and his party to be the ones to draft the legislation for the new state ? 
  i 'm ok with that flag too . 
  i just think mine is prettier and has a deeper meaning :p, 
  you 're glad a totalitarian regime was stablished ? 
  way to make friends , buddy . 
  or the one i 'm using right now , if you want the king to separate from spain . 
  i have come to learn that it is in balance that the human being can find true happiness . 
  while the article clearly states some misconceptions , there is one thing that is , to a certain extent , true : success is all we seem to care about now . 
  having a normal conversation with a stranger , you can easily notice how quickly it becomes a battle to prove who is the most successful : how many countries you have visited , how important the company you work for is , how far you think you will get . 
  sadly , the current environment does not allow us to live up to our unrealistic self-imposed goals . 
  this often results in utter frustration , self-loath and a feeling of powerlessness that ends up consuming us . 
  we are so obesessed with climbing up the ladder that facing the extreme routine that the real world offers makes us feel like motionless devices soon to be replaced . 
  are we that worn-out to settle for this depressing , soul-consuming lifestyle ? 
  yes , really . 
   [ ... ] the right not to be discriminated against on the ground of `` other status '' . 
  when different concepts for these kind of unions coexist , a different status for gay people is given in this particular matter ( unions ) , thus hinting the idea that gay people are somehow different . 
  being gay should be as big of a deal as being red-haired , having freckles or broad shoulders . 
  after all , it is just on more variable that is received innately . 
  `` we will crush them , with debt '' ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ i ^ ^ could n't ^ ^ resist, 
  this might sound weird , but i wish i was one of those babies . 
  oh , that makes sense ... 
  you can vote more than once , that 's why there are so many `` people '' from the vatican . 
  you and i are certainly not good at polls , it seems :p ( i 'm the guy from the previous poll ), 
  i 'm from spain and i 've never heard about an independent movement in canarias . 
  are they gay too when gay people are being persecuted ? 
  are they women when most religions are not treating women equally ? 
  ^ ^ please ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ downvote ^ ^ me ^ ^ too ^ ^ much ^ ^ i ^ ^ am ^ ^ just ^ ^ trying ^ ^ to ^ ^ raise ^ ^ an ^ ^ issue ^ ^ :(, 
  it is , within the standards of the european society . 
  i do n't understand what the problem with some people in this sub is . 
  when it was discovered that christian priests were sexually abusing children in their churches nobody batted an eye . 
  nobody said it was unfair , nobody said it was a plot to lumberjack the christian religion , nothing , we accepted the facts and reported it . 
  while this article is quite probably overgeneralising , there are real facts that are , indeed , real . 
  those happened . 
  however , every time i see a post like this one , people in the comments talk about how `` this is a world problem not just a muslim problem '' , `` this is outright racist '' , `` patriot yurop strikes again '' . 
  why should it be taboo to speak about what an utterly outdated insitution that is religion does wrong ? 
  why are n't we working towards adapting it to the standards of contemporary society instead of blocking the debate or just ignoring the issue ? 
  edit : grammar . 
  actually , i think there are only two : catalonia and basque country . 
  there 's a very popular book called `` my family and other animals '' ( i think there ' a movie as well ) by gerald durell . 
  anyway , it tells the story about a family who moved to corfu from the uk in search for some sunlight . 
  the book is hilarious and includes some beautiful depictions of the island 's landscape and fauna . 
  i 've wanted to visit corfu since the moment i opened that book . 
  70 $ is the initial price , you have to add other administrative stuff and the count ends up at around 85 $ . 
  there was a 27 $ deal if you brought four people with you , if you 're travelling alone you 'd have to pay 107 $ for the same seat . 
  you could pay less and take longer to get there but that would n't make the train worth it because you 'd take longer than on the bus . 
  from granada to madrid the train takes around 4 hours .
