   but a majority of french people ( 52 percent ) wanted britain out of the eu , with ** a mere ** 42 percent believing brussels should take london 's concerns into account . 
  why are we still acting as if the telegraph was a reliable source of information ? 
  there is only a 10 % difference between both opinions but the article makes it seem like everybody in france wants the uk out of the eu . 
  becuause of what happened 6 years ago , i am kind of skeptical about the benefits of market deregulation . 
  in any case , i think an agreement of such importance should be voted on referendum . 
  actually , there is `` true '' and `` hope '' . 
  hey , gorillas do n't have to worry about economic downturns and wars and whatnot , it 's our intellectualism that is killing us . 
  spain . 
  i do n't think we would agree on that right now . 
  the current situation is quite sensitive and people see europe as an austerity-enforcer rather than a helping hand . 
  funny how you do n't even mention income inequality . 
  having a strong social security programme provides for a constant stream of money towards the formation of a middle class that can sustain the country . 
  some of those countries do actually have good social programmes ( australia , canada , nz ) and not so low-tax , low-regulation policies . 
  i 'm pretty tired of the neo-liberal approach to economics where the only thing that matters is that the gdp growth is positive . 
  so yeah , you can go back to your rich or rich wanna-be club . 
  totally, 
  no , you 've had your share already . 
  lovely how everyone praises our skill at creating jobs with wages that wo n't even cover a meal at mcdonald 's . 
  fools . 
  yeah , they can also make use of our countless loopholes to avoid taxes . 
  i see only advantages here ... 
  i 've lived for a bit in every single one of those countries and i may say , police are jerks , everywhere . 
  it 's like they require people to submit a jerk certificate to be allowed to apply for the position . 
  i think he 's referring to the polic\u00eda nacional , which is state-run , as opposed to the other two ( polic\u00eda local and guardia civil ) you guys mentioned before ( which are local and military-run respectively ) . 
  * actually they have the excellent opportunity of showing off their revising skills . 
  hmm , i 'm not sure if the government or any other consumers association sponsors it but we have a common belief that imported fish is usually not as fresh as local fish . 
  countries hard : 1:38 capitals hard : 2:33 ( oh , the balcans ... ), 
  i feel you , buddy . 
  well , at least you have jobs available . 
  well , about two weeks ago [ we had 1,000 coming to our shores ] ( http://www.europapress.es/sociedad/noticia-imagenes-llegada-masiva-inmigrantes-espana-20140812192939.html ) . 
  those who are not pregnant women and children are going to be repatriated . 
  what makes me really angry about this issue is that some of them are swindled by mafias to [ pay up to 6,000 euros to be smuggled into spain ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/20140813/more-toy-boat-migrants-head-for-spain-africa-immigration ) ... and guess what , most of them do n't make it and the rest are taken back to their contries of origin . 
  i think the eu should take a decision on this topic once for all . 
  it is certainly not fair that spain and italy are bearing all the economical , bureaucratic and psychological burden that this issue brings about . 
  after all , realistically speaking , most of them will probably flock to countries offerring better job opportunities like germany or france ... 
  amazon . 
  funny thing he actually thinks the super rich pay their taxes . 
  basically , france gets told off again because , market-wise , they are not as conservative as they should be : http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/opinion/krugman-the-plot-against-france.html?emc=eta1&amp;_r=1&amp;, 
  welcome to the club, 
  i guess it still works as a way for switzerland to scrub off its bad reputation as a tax heaven ? 
  the anarcho-capitalism is strong in this one . 
  tagged as `` hellbent communist '' , because there is no alternative to jungle-style capitalism other than the north-korean approach to economics . 
  i thought what the king ( or , actually , don rafael ) did was drying it with paper ( el rey se lo lava con papel ? 
  it is , but those two are represented by more than one party . 
  what i meant is that they only think you can vote for pp or psoe . 
  almost half of the votes pp gets come from people above +65 , many of them lack access to information so they think this is like in the old time where it was all about `` right '' and `` left '' . 
  it is so ironic that the same people who helped build the eu after seeing what happened during the war are the ones who just kicked it in the butt . 
  they already did , otherwise this would n't be on the frontpage . 
  yeah , we 've got the [ recortes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bullfighting#recortes ) . 
  a lot more fun if you ask me . 
  have n't you heard of all these commercials talking about the amount of protein in semen and how healthy it is ? 
  pretty sure the gay industry and their shady lobbying are behind it . 
  agreed !, 
  in my opinion it should be replaced with [ bull-leaping ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bull-leaping ) . 
  much more exciting to watch and a bit more respectful towards the bull . 
  i think russia 's gdp decrease was driving finland 's economy down since russia has always been finland 's main trading partner . 
  the finns , however , have invested well into education and , with such a well-qualified workfoce , they will always pick themselves up in the long run . 
  then maybe you and i are not living the same reality . 
  before i left spain , i tried to find graduate jobs in my hometown in the south , only to be offered salaries of around 800-900 euro gross full time . 
  i graduated with a degree that has a very high demand , i am currently earning 3200 a month here . 
  maybe we are all lying and it is all a dream , maybe [ this girl ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2012/03/14/nimileurista/1331738387_869981.html ) or [ this guy ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2012/03/20/nimileurista/1332239096_781420.html ) are into acid . 
  wake up , things are not going to change unless we make them change . 
  exactly, 
  23 , telecommunications . 
   here 's the document isea allegedly provided in april . 
  i have already seen that document . 
  despite the fact that it looks as shady as it gets . 
  it still does not specify that podemos was illegally financed ( which is what we are discussing here ) , but rather that the venezuelan government allocated money for interviews with three people ( which sounds plausible ) , back when the party did not even exist . 
   i have lived and worked in northern europe , and believe me , things there are n't at all like in podemos ' programme . 
  stop paying the rent and you 'll be evicted pretty damn soon , for instance . 
  i am currently working in one of them . 
  and believe me , many of the people being evicted in spain are victims of shady bank practices which would haver never been allowed here ( cl\u00e1usulas suelo , amongst others ) . 
  that is what happens when you do n't set limits , companies like ibm offer you 600-euro job contracts in madrid and banks profit from the fact the political power is on their side . 
  eviction laws in spain are fucked up and the [ european court ruled against them ] ( http://www.lawyersinspain.eu/european-court-of-justice-rules-spanish-eviction-laws-are-illegal/ ) . 
  by the way , de la calle , the woman who was responsible for expelling errej\u00f3n , has now been appointed consejera de educaci\u00f3n ( [ source ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/andalucia/2015/07/22/55af440246163f3d558b456b.html ) ) . 
  how convenient for her ... 
  i appreciate your warning , but i am sure podemos is not heading that direction , not matter what the media wants us to believe . 
  we 've already got examples of good management by podemos in cities like madrid and barcelona . 
  it says , as he himself said , that there are things he liked about latin america and things he did not like about it . 
  i think that 's a pretty fair opinion . 
  he never said he wanted to turn spain into venezuela . 
  and you know , even in the unlikely event that they changed their mind and actually wanted to , with the system their programme describes it could be stopped in days . 
   ... yet . 
  and this is not the same as saying that courts have `` proved '' anything . 
  according to that logic , should we assume that accusations deemed as false are actually nor false nor true ? 
  is this your particular version of how pressumtion of innocence should work ? 
   documents have surfaced in the meantime . 
  i 'm skeptic about this . 
  the last case was closed 1 month and a half ago . 
  are you going to use youtube videos as ` proof ' like inda did on his newspaper ? 
   which is equally foolish that 's your opinion . 
  i see their programme as a great means to bring us closer to what things are like in northern europe ( where are qualified workforce is emigrating ) and clean all the rotten , disabling corruption politicians have bathed in for more than 30 years . 
  anyone can donate money to support a political party , as long as it from individuals ( up to a certain amount ) . 
  donations from countries , companies or political institutions are either forbidden or very limited by law in spain . 
  podemos was accused of receiving money above the limits ( financiaci\u00f3n ilegal ) and the court deemed it was false . 
  many people accused the of being financed by hugo chavez , which shows how little people are willing to go through research to find out what the media tells them is true or not ( chavez was dead by the time the party was found ) . 
  i am inclined to believe that he said that because he would benefit in some way from saying it . 
  it would n't suprise me the media or certain political institutions/financial interests in this country helped with that ( after all , we have an unhealthy history on the issue ) . 
  are you albert rivera ? 
  it has been investigated by several courts and ultimately been deemed false , i do n't see how this question is still hanging there .
