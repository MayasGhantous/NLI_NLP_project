  actually , no accusation against podemos has been successful in court : [ source ] ( http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20160413/supremo-archiva-querella-contra-iglesias-errejon-financiacion-ilegal-cuestiona-informe-policial-sobre-podemos/1336660.shtml ) , [ source ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2016/06/07/actualidad/1465314127_393063.html ) and [ source ] ( http://www.libertaddigital.com/espana/politica/2016-04-13/el-tribunal-supremo-archiva-la-denuncia-contra-iglesias-y-errejon-por-la-financiacion-ilegal-de-podemos-1276571858/ ) . 
  that video does not say podemos was funded by chavez or anyone like that i do n't see how that is an ` oh really ' . 
  i 'd rather believe what courts say . 
  that guy can say whatever he wants to say . 
  courts have proved that did n't happen . 
  i had a friend the other day say he * dreams of * becoming a mileurista ( he gets 600 euro a month for a graduate job ) . 
  you are aware that all the instances saying that podemos was financed by iran or venezuela have been deemed false in court , right ?

  except it 's not . 
  if there is any growth the middle class is not profitting from it . 
  some statistics that prove how weak our economy still is are : * our income inequality is one of the highest in europe . 
  this is quite easy to see just by taking a walk around the centre of any spanish city . 
  [ source ] ( https://data.oecd.org/inequality/income-inequality.htm ) . 
  * unemployment is still above 20 % . 
  although it 's going down , most contracts that have been signed lately were either temporary ( 90 % of them ) , 3-10 hours cheap contracts where they pressure you to stay on the job for longer than the contract says , or seasonal . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/economia/2016/04/04/5702120f22601dc94f8b45c2.html ) . 
  * taking into account how our public debt has skyrocketted for the last two years , one would think the government spending is up the roof . 
  well , it is n't . 
  this is probably the result of our current government losing budget by lowering taxes for the wealthy , above all . 
  [ source example . 
  i 'm not going to say which party we should we voting for , after all spain 's need will be reflected on the electoral results at the end of the month . 
  but saying `` spain is pulling itself out of the crisis '' is nowhere near close to reality , and not only are there statistics to prove that : just look around . 
  friends and acquaintances my age who recently graduated are either working for a salary that barely allows them to eat ( around 600-800 euro ) , unemployed , or have fled the country and are actually enjoying a decent life abroad . 
  of course , to all of this you have to add the staggering amount of corruption cases that are reported every day on the news . 
  exactly , anybody who 'd say spain is out of the crisis has not had a look at what is going on here . 
  unemployment will always be that high as long as we do n't do anything about our crippling income inequality ... yet politicians seem to be more interested in whatever is going on in venezuela . 
  all in all , if there has been any recovery , it has barely been noticed by our middle classes and the youth . 
  i do n't think people would concur with the idea of spain being financially healthier right now than it was back in 2007 . 
  well , it could be worse . 
  it could be just like spain , where 34 out of our 35 corporations within the ibex-35 ( our stock market exchange ) have a presence in tax havens .

  i 've envied your country for a while now : slow yet steady economic growth , a strong middle class that has managed to veer away from the impact of the recession , very low income inequality ( one of the lowest gini ratios in the world ) , very low unemployment rate and from what i 've seen around here you guys are also quite open minded when it comes to social issues . 
  what 's your secret and why ca n't we have some of it ? 
  well , it makes sense . 
  once you 've assured democratic support , you can always use it as an argument to make things follow a certain path ( following the opposite path would mean acting against the will of the people thus making it anti-democratic ) even if , legally speaking , the referendum was non-binding there 's a still a moral background that comes into play . 
  also , in any case , even though it seems that most people who voted leave are now regretting it , most voters do not want a second referendum ( this is the strongest argument against a u-turn ) so , whether we like it or not , may has every right to head that direction .

  this is the imf every year : `` hey guys , the recession in spain is extending into next year , let 's fix this by demanding them some more austerity measures , i 'm sure it 'll work like gangbusters '', 
  there are leftovers from that regime , and i can assure you they are very powerful, 
  trains ? 
  what 's trains ? 
  that 's nothing out of normallity , it happens every year . 
  tourism boosts employment enormously during the summer holidays . 
  even i get a ( horribly-paid ) job !, 
  they have also benefited from the euro going down . 
  as an export-country , they can sell more goods for less , which is basically why their unmployment data is in a record-breaking new-low . 
  not if well monitored, 
  yeah , we party hard today and back to work tomorrow . 
  oh wait , we ca n't , there are no jobs !, 
  more than i can cope with , it drives me nuts sometimes . 
  that sounds like you 'd fit well in scandinavian countries, 
  it 's quite common north korea = democratic people 's republic of korea, 
  the chicago school joined the supply-side economics view in the 70s and started to care less about central banks intervention . 
  e.g : they gladly accepted the interest rate reduction the federal reserve carried out after the 9/11 . 
  that 's true . 
  bankia in spain has been just 100 % acquired by the state , but only temporarly ... 
  whoops , i meant chicago-school , let me fix that, 
  not only banks have taken too high risks . 
  from 1990 on , a series of non-bank lending/borrowing devices ( like hedge funds ) , whose regulation was practically non-existent , emerged massively and contributed to inflate the bubble and complicate the tangled mess the financial system became . 
  it 's simply because our banking system and most of the main economy-oriented organizations ( imf , ecb ) follow an chicago-school view of economy managing . 
  the financial system was strongly controlled after the great depresion to prevent such economic collapse from happening again but some economists started to boast about how stable and growth-bringing a free market is , forgetting about everything that happened before . 
  especially from 1970 , the financial system has been gradually deregulated and its restrictions , those that impeded financial institutions to gather too much power , were wiped out . 
  bubbles followed the usual process ( the same dull process from the tulip man\u00eda of 1636 ) and bursted and once again the panic came about . 
  why not socialise them , then ? 
  well were that be beneficial or not , that wo n't happen . 
  this is capitalism , the best thing we can make out governments do is to make sure their dealings are strictly regulated and monitored . 
  in most cases , deregulated and non-publicly-shared accumulation of power leads to corruption . 
  it 's not a german thing , it comes within human nature . 
  why does this look like a h&m ad ? 
  it 's astonishing how desperate powerful people get when you 're on their way to make some more millions . 
  off now to download nicky minaj 's new album while i go on working on my nuclear warhead and laugh histerically after several bolts project long shadows in my hidden attic base . 
  also i 'm wearing a top hat . 
  yep , austerity is working like gangbusters . 
  you cut down spending , people see this and are afraid to lose their money so they spend even less : demand falls . 
  demand falls so business earn less , namely less money collected by the state , less money to fight the deficit budget : deficit budget remains the same , unemployment rises , panic rises yet investors will claw each other 's eyes out to buy spanish bonds . 
  seems legit, 
  love their accents, 
  banks regulation . 
  you know , to prevent them from investing in bubbles that will later burst in their faces . 
  this is so objective it hurts my eyes, 
  my mom owns an insurance agency . 
  she always complains about having too much work to do . 
  i ask her why she does n't hire a secretary . 
  answer : `` i 'd rather kill myself than entering that bureaucratic labyrinth that making a contract in spain is '' . 
  i guess this is like watching a race . 
  spain wins , though ( 23.3 % ) . 
  you know , we are very competitive at sports . 
  i thought saying `` spain is not uganda '' was ridiculous , but making a comparison about it goes beyond the bounds, 
  and once again we will forget that we are all humans after all , not money, 
  does it still exist ? 
  are they still developing and all ? 
  i had fun times playing that one, 
   if everyone has money but nobody has a place to spend it in a capitalist economy , that will never happen . 
  you certainly have forgotten that the only way to grow in a capitalist economy is through consumption . 
  how 's austerity supposed to promote consumption , especially when it is applied to middle classes ? 
  why do we let the rich hide the money in tax havens hoping that they will use it to acquire some public bonds and then say governments `` spend too much '' ? 
  anything that goes against the middle classes will end up damaging the economy . 
  and btw , a redistribution of wealth is basically what happened during/after world war ii ( marginal taxes reached a 95 % at some point in the us ) , which lead the world out of the crisis . 
  maybe this time we are intelligent enough to prevent catastophic events from happening .
