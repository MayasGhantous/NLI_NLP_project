in spain the police horses have the same consideration as a policeman ( the same goes for dogs ) so punching a police horse is like punching a police officer . 
  i guess same goes for the uk ( correct me if i 'm wrong ) so that guy is pretty much fucked . 
  thanks , i supposed the same but i was n't sure  i find the whole situation ridiculous . 
  it 's also funny how in western media 2 years ago assad was painted as a violent dictator and it was discussed obama could potentially intervene , and he did by arming rebels , but now it seems assad is the west 's best friend . 
  yes , in spain people were like supporting the rebels and now they are like : meh assad was n't that bad . 
  when i said that i prefered assad than some `` moderate '' rebels that we have n't heard of , some people even call me fascist . 
  no , i 'm not fascist , i 'm just worried that the cure can be worse than the disease . 
  hey can you help me with this situation ? 
  so i was wondering what was the problem with assad ( yeah , i know he is a dictator and all that stuff ) but i do n't remember assad atacking turkey . 
  so i understand your point of view with the pkk and isis but why bothering with assad ? 
  i mean he fights against isis , why erdogan want to turn an `` ally '' into an enemy , i 'm not saying to give him weapons or any kind of support but if the coalition says that apart from isis assad is a target too it would make the mission even more complicated , for example the air attacks would need jets and fighters to defend the bombers from the syrian aircrafts because they do n't know who is the target : isis or themselves . 
  now is when i enjoy most all the downvotes that i got for saying that with the current path the 9 n was doomed . 
  first change the constitution , then the referendum . 
  have you seen his comment history ? 
  it 's late , i 'm tired and i do n't want to write anymore in english . 
  so i 'll leave this [ here ] ( http://blogs.periodistadigital.com/desdeelatlantico.php/2014/09/29/el-mentiroso-titulo-de-la-sedicente-ley - ) that says all what i want to say . 
  i 'm tired of saying always the same to the same people . 
  the referendum is illegal with the current constitution , so guess what ?? 
  even if all the court members were pro independence they would say the same . 
  it 's like trying to do a referendum on the legalization of the human trafficking . 
   you 're gullible if you think the spanish government can just say ` no ' and see all it 's problems disappear . 
  i did n't say that . 
  but it 's clearly that saying that the outcome of the referendum is manipulated is the plan of the government . 
  what do you think they are going to do ? 
  send tanks to the parlament ? 
   it 's the correct term . 
  so no . 
  except that the term spain also include catalonia , so it 's not the correct term . 
  the spanish constitution guarantees `` the indissoluble unity of the spanish nation '' in its article 2 . 
  this is literally what the constitution says . 
  is impossible to interpretate other thing rather than what the court said . 
  all the people knew what the court was going to say . 
  the referendum is illegal with the current constitution , no matter what . 
  i 'm tired of saying that first should happen the change in the constitution and later on the referendum . 
  meanwhile this referendum is as illegal as a referendum to restore the slavery . 
   spain will have to stop it as it happens no , the government will just let them vote and then say that the results are fake and manipulated , is just that easy , and then what ? 
  another referendum ? 
  but just one thing , can we stop saying spain ? 
  it 's the government not the whole country the one that is in charge and refuses to do anything . 
  you make it seem like all catalans are pro independence and all spaniards are against the referendum . 
  because it was planned to change the constitution ( human rights , free speech , etc ) not just to approve referendums like you said . 
  you ca n't just simply change the constitution like you change clothes . 
   because the way they are chosen , immediately affects the way the court votes . 
  no , just no . 
  the constitutional court just apply the constitution ( in spain the constitution is above the law ) and with the current constitution what the pro-independence want to do is illegal , thats why all of them ( not the majority , the 12 of them ) said that the referendum is illegal . 
  it 's a court , they can not vote depending of the guy who put them in charge , the court is subject only to the constitution and its organic law .

  never say to a galician that they are n't celtics , is the best way to keep them friendly, 
  [ here it is , please do n't vote , we have enought right now with catalonia ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ know ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ joke ] ( http://www.change.org/p/mr-david-cameron-prime-minister-of-the-united-kingdom-please-accept-galiza-as-an-integral-part-of-united-kingdom-when-scotland-becomes-independent ), 
  more tourism for spain ( and in winter ) fuck yeah !!, 
  our economy is saved, 
   demands somebody thinks we are still in the 80 's , instead of building icbms you should have built an economy, 
  cuba , you know , you ca n't leave your child alone , he met bad guys and now is in his commie phase . 
  thanks usa ^ ^ btw ^ ^ no ^ ^ one ^ ^ here ^ ^ believes ^ ^ that ^ ^ the ^ ^ maine ^ ^ was ^ ^ sunk ^ ^ by ^ ^ its ^ ^ own ^ ^ crew ^ ^ ( ( irony ) ^ ), 
  i hope he did n't called for the protection of the rights of the russians in spain , we have our beaches full of them . 
  inb4 a referendum in the canary islands . 
  yep , they do the same with the spanish oil . 
  `` spain is the largest producer and exporter worldwide ( 849,414 tons in 2011 ) and account for more than half of the production in the european union and 40 % of the world . 
  [ ... ] but italy is the main buyer - 65 % of all spanish exports - and the second largest exporter . 
  in other words , it is our first customer and our most direct and unfair competitor . '', 
  [ source ( in spanish , sorry ) ] ( http://www.elconfidencial.com/economia/2013/02/10/la-marca-italia-se-queda-con-el-aceite-espanol-114533 ) thats why when spain had to sell deoleo ( it brings together the best and most sold brands of olive oil in the world ) the government `` blocked '' the italian companies . 
  fuck the spaghettis ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ a ^ ^ joke , ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ not ^ ^ racist , ^ ^ mods ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ban ^ ^ me ... 
  it was n't supposed to be a threat but anyways you are right . 
   it 's a sovereign territory . 
  its tax affairs are its own business , not spain 's [ that 's not totally true ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/disputed_status_of_gibraltar#spanish_position )  hyperbole yes it is , but is also a fact  what gibraltar does in its own port is gibraltar 's business , not spain 's except when the petrol goes away from the waters of gibraltar and ends in the spanish seas, 
  99 % of the spaniards do n't even care about gibraltar being from the uk . 
  people complain more about other things like [ tax haven ] ( http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/blog/2013/08/17/the-uk-declares-economic-warfare-on-its-gibraltar-tax-haven/ ) , [ bunkering ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2013/08/14/espana/1376447534.html ) , [ stealing territory ] ( http://ep00.epimg.net/elpais/imagenes/2013/08/07/media/1375906103_236505_1375906113_noticia_normal.png ) , [ smuggling ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-23784627 ) , etc. 
  you want to be from the uk ? 
  no problem , but you better start behaving like a nice neighbour or [ this is what you are going to get ] ( http://ep00.epimg.net/ccaa/imagenes/2013/11/12/andalucia/1384284058_069240_1384285891_noticia_normal.jpg ), 
  that question dodging . 
  do you consider yourself an idiot ? 
  you do n't have any argument , so you attack me , ad hominem at it 's finest . 
  catalan is officialy language in catalonia , valencian community , balearic islands and parts of arag\u00f3n and murcia . 
  is an official language only there since in the rest of spain nobody speaks it . 
  the same way the galician language is official only in galicia , because in the rest of spain nobody speaks it . 
  lots of things , the same way that there are lots of things that we have in common . 
  `` what unites us is greater than what divides us '' but the independentist just look at the differences and close the eyes at the things we have in common . 
   we fuck up every day we stay in spain you are free to leave to france if the people that is in charge of rating your bonds tell you that is a bad idea why the fuck will you do it ? 
  maybe because the per capita has literally nothing to do with the first link ?? 
  and in the second link you can see in the picture ( yeah the big one ) that is per capita ( i will help you do n't worry : media nacional : 1946 $ , catalu\u00f1a : 2081 $ , madrid : 1776 $ ** por habitante ** ) blah blah demagogia blah blah blah ... 
  may i ask why ? 
  yes, 
  [ i do n't understand catalan , sorry ] ( http://www.libremercado.com/2012-09-22/cataluna-recibe-cuatro-veces-mas-que-madrid-en-el-reparto-autonomico-1276469235/ ) but [ i 'm sure you understand spanish ] ( http://www.abc.es/20120730/espana/abcp-cataluna-recibe-dinero-estado-20120730.html ) but of course is spain ( and madrid ) the one that does n't understand the concept of solidarity and they mistake it for extortion . 
  madrid is an opressed nation !!!, 
  independencia !!!, 
  moody 's and s&p already warned you and you decided to carry on with your patriotic bonds , catalonia fucked up but you blame spain , tipical catalan behaviour ... 
   and btw , the patriotic bonds were started by montilla , not mas , and were due to our money not returning home ( 15000milion $ per year that we send to madrid and stay there ) and so having plea money from the people , because sadly , spain does n't understand the concept of solidarity and they mistake it for extorsion do you even read what you write ? 
  ps : yes , it was montilla , my bad . 
  a third of all the exports of catalonia are sell to spain , if they secede they would need to look for new countries to buy their stuff since they would be out of the eu ( if things do n't change ) so if catalonia secede both , spain and catalonia would be fucked , but they just do n't think about it . 
  the risk premium laughts at the gpd in high instability moments ( like in a secesion ) . 
  want to play a game ? 
  if catalonia secede from spain please look at the stock exchange and when the catalan bonus get the aa rank i 'll buy you gold but if catalonia gets a rank of bb ( again ) you buy gold to me ok ?? 
  let 's see who is right and who is wrong . 
  ps : do you remember your patriotic bonds ( best idea of mas and his gang ) because rajoy used the money of all spaniards to save your asses , do you remember that ? 
  do you know why ignacio gonzalez was so mad at the central government despite being from the same political party ?? 
  because they force madrid to raise the inheritance taxes because catalonia already raised it ( meanwhile madrid lowered it ) and the corporations were moving to madrid instead to barcelona , because a high inheritance tax destoy the smes . 
  now you can think what you want . 
  i do n't know about other stuff but economicaly catalonia always had preference , and thats a fact . 
  [ you are still our butt .
