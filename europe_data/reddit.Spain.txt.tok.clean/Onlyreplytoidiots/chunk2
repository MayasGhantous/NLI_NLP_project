  i 'm tired of replying to this question so i 'll just copy paste the reply :  it may seem hypocritical for spain to demand the return of gibraltar while consistently rebuffing similar moroccan claims in north africa . 
  its government insists , however , that the two situations are not the same . 
  ceuta and melilla , it argues , are integral parts of spain , not colonial holdings . 
  their residents not only possess spanish citizenship , but vote in spanish elections , pay spanish taxes ( albeit at a reduced rate ) , and have all other rights and responsibilities of membership in the national community , as well as the e.u. 
  the position of gibraltar , the spanish government maintains , is colonial . 
  as a british overseas territory , the peninsula is under british sovereignty yet is not part of the united kingdom . 
  gibraltar even has its own currency , the gibraltar pound , which is not legal tender in the united kingdom . 
  the dispute is further complicated by the fact that spain never formally ceded the isthmus , which remains under british-gibraltarian control .

'' i do n't know if this guy is serious , does this guy think that a bunch of mentally handicapped supporters of the real madrid are going to send the jews to a gas chamber or is he just victim-playing as usual ? 
  this is n't hate towards the jews it is simply frustration , if instead of the tel aviv , the rm loses against morocco , all those tweets would say : fucking moors with torquemada this would n't happen . 
  i bet that 90 % of those tweets are from underage kids full of rage due to the defeat of the rm , probably the next day they do n't even remember it .

  just one question : what knowledge do you have about business practices to say such statement ? 
  ( no , the newspaper and the news does n't count ), 
  powerpointistas ? 
  may i ask why do you think that someone who study a mba is not worth of any kind of reputation and deserve such wanton attack ? 
  have you been in the complutense ? 
  it only has better marks than other universities is because it has a lot of university careers for example medicine gives a lot of points , because the number of thesis in the medicine department is huge , meanwhile others like the economy department ca n't submit as many . 
  the best way to identify the best university it 's not as a whole , its way better to separate it in department ( that way you are not comparing apples and oranges ) . 
  and yes , the campus sucks ( let 's not talk about the student 's protest there ), 
  meanwhile here we still think that the complutense is one of the best universities of spain, 
   educating and encouraging them to adopt the 21st century european values .

  we can create a new meme, 
   people do n't care about the military . 
  they want better lives how people will obtain better lives if they do n't have any military force to keep other forces away ? 
  people nowadays think that the world is flowers and rainbows , and that wars only happen in other countries . 
  people here in europe think that is the duty of the us to protect them . 
   so it 's ok to hold 8 million hostage because the rest does n't want to let go ? 
  that argument works both ways so it 's ok to hold the catalans who do n't want the independence in a country that they do n't feel as such ? 
  why they should be catalans or spaniards when in fact they want to be both ? 
   the catalan stock change would rise ... shortly stabilizing after investors realise that the region now is independent de-facto and safe to invest on ... 
  which they would do undoubtebly given it 's economic prosperity hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha , nice joke , oh wait ... are you serious ? 
  if you think that then you have no idea how the stock exchange works . 
  first , if you do n't pay your debt , nobody will buy your future debt ( who says that you 'll decide to not pay again ) as it will be a junk bond , at the same level of the debt of pakistan . 
  this only if you decide to stop paying your debt . 
  now , the risk will increase if you decide to be independent . 
  why ? 
  simple , the shareholders know nothing about independent catalonia , and uncertainty increases the country risk : will it last ? 
  will be in the eu ? 
  what if spain invade them ? 
  what will happen to my bonds if catalonia does n't gets international recognition ? 
  will catalonia use the euro or will use another currency ? 
  all that matters to the interest rate . 
  if you separate your country risk will increase because the first year ( s ) will be a chaos . 
  it wo n't normalize until at least 3 or 4 years ( this being optimistic ) . 
  safe to invest ? 
  says who ? 
  no one , in the stock exchange things do n't work that way , to be clear , in the stock exchange the people are freaking paranoid , [ think in the apple stocks when 4chan said that steve jobs had a heart attack , apple lost 5 $ billions ] ( http://arstechnica.com/apple/2008/10/sources-sec-identifies-steve-jobs-heart-attack-prankster/ ) . 
  so do n't expect that the international investors will say : `` hey !!, 
  catalonia is independent i 'll put my money on them '' because that 's laughable . 
  do that and all the companies will find other ways to import/export to spain and the only one fucked will be catalonia ( economically and his `` international support '' ), 
  dude what are you doing ? 
  if you do n't support the catalan independence the redditors of / r/europe that know everything about spain ( even more than the spaniards themselves ) are going to downvote you to hell for being a fascist that steals the money of the catalans . 
  because you know , spain is not a nation , catalonia is older than spain and [ catalonia is an oppressed nation ] ( http://31.media.tumblr.com/ffb446bb582dc0445d8ab65e413de007/tumblr_n3q5kyn3q21qeacv5o1_1280.jpg ),

  they were here for 770 years and we fought them for every single year , ofc we are in complete denial about our muslim history . 
  the culture , the language , the buildings , you know , we destroyed everything and make sure that no one remember it . 
  and about the jews , well , they did n't expect the spanish inquisition . 
  in europe it does n't matter , but out of the eu it would be better if we stay together , spain without the basque country and without catalonia is going to be much weaker , and the same goes for catalonia and euskadi . 
  if catalonia or the basque country leave spain they wo n't have the same gpd or the same international influence . 
   global institutions like the un ? 
  nobody cares about the un nowadays , i would say that the g20 is who run the show now, 
  hell yeah , daddy is back south america !!!, 
  we want the three g 's now, 
  ceuta and melilla are part of spain since 1400 ( more or less ) they are integral parts of spain , not colonial holdings . 
  their residents not only possess spanish citizenship , but vote in spanish elections , pay spanish taxes ( albeit at a reduced rate ) , and have all other rights and responsibilities of membership in the national community , as well as the e.u. 
  if israel is in europe then syria is in europe , and why stop there ? 
  egypt , morocco , tunisia , etc. 
  so if the catalans have just decide that they do n't want to be part of spain ( federal or not ) what is supposed to be discuss in the debate ?
