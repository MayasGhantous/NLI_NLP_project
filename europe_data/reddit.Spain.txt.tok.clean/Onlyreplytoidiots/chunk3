  i 'm sure you 've just copypaste that list from any other forum . 
  i say that because some of them are not even close to insult the catalans , ( and no one changes the list , so no one has read all of them ) for example :  ` incultos ' ( m.a. 
  trujillo , 16.12.2013 ; i arturo p\u00e9rez reverte , 09.12.2013 ) http://www.periodistadigital.com/periodismo/internet/2012/12/09/arturo-perez-reverte-estamos-regidos-twitter-analfabetos-eurodiputados-escano-incultos.shtml please tell me where you find the insults to catalonia . 
  i 'm pretty sure that some of them ( or maybe the majority idk ) may have insults ( which i do n't like or support , i have family and some great friends living in catalonia ) but it 's not like all spain is talking shit about catalonia [ and some catalans also insults the rest of spain ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7j72wh2w18 ), 
  d'hondt method actually favors the nationalist parties in spain , so its easier to a catalonian ( or any other autonomous community ) political party to get more members than other with the same votes with presence in all spain . 
  you are talking about a constitution as you will talk about a newspaper so what are you proposing ? 
   and it is this very attitude in spain 's part that lead to the independence movement in catalonia what attitude ? 
   to sway catalans away from independence , address the catalans themselves , not the political parties working for independence . 
  the uk in its campaign against scottish independence is doing this very thing . 
  after all it does n't need permission from the scottish nationalist party to sway the scottish populace . 
  here i 'm right behind you , the government is just talking about the negative effects of a independent catalonia , not about the beneficts of catalonia being member of spain . 
   and the spanish central government only has itself to blame for it . 
  really ? 
  the independentist groups are changing and making up the history to favor the independence ( for example : http://i51.tinypic.com/ilan8h.gif these are the kingdoms in spain in the middle ages : castile , leon , navarra , aragon and granada , now they say aragon-catalonia as arguments to favor independence and against the centralism of spanish nationalism ), 
  because allowing something that is unconstitutional collapses the whole system . 
  you want to change the constitution , well , win the elections and wait that the chambers pass it . 
  meanwhile it is unconstitutional , so it ca n't be allowed . 
  it 's not about freedom of speach and national identity , it 's about doing a referendum that is first in illegal . 
  you can not say : well , this part of the constitution about free speach is okay , but this part about breaking a country is not so i 'll just ignore it . 
   options offered by our government to madrid ( more autonomy , etc. ), 
  `` we will have our referendum it does n't matter what the court says '' , its not like you are offering something , that is just an ultimatum  and the continued insults that came from there . 
  can you please give me examples ? 
  okay , lets do a referendum about limiting the freedom of spech , imagine now that the people vote yes ( althoug the constitution says that the freedom of spech is a human right so the referendum is unconstitutional ) what happens now ? 
  people have the right of free spech or not ? 
  what should prevail ? 
  the constitution or the referendum ? 
  clue : the constitution . 
  voting , joinning lobbies and political parties that think the same way as me , it wo n't be up to me but i 'll try my best , not gona hide in my home . 
   you forget that the text was approved by the spanish parliament before being voted on referendum so what 's the problem ? 
  if they fuck me i 'll fuck them , call it whatever you want . 
  if they get their independence they will like that spain votes no to catalonia in europe , that way they can blame us instead of themselves and they can still playing the victim . 
  there are lots of public debates talking about different ways to try to solve it , like the idea of a federal spain , but they do n't want to talk about anything besides independence , they have said that it does n't matter what a constitutional court says that they will have their referendum . 
  with people like that you ca n't dialogue . 
  do n't say that spain is rejecting calls for public debate and showing a lack of willingness to debate the issue when actually the independentists are the ones that do n't wa n't to talk . 
  get your facts straight if you 're going to make such statements . 
  it 's fun how you say that the spanish government rejects it , if some articles are incostitucional the constitutional court has to edit them , the same way that if someone say that you have to work 20 hours per day the court wo n't allow it because it 's unconstitutional , it 's not that difficult to understand . 
  about the catalan party , you know , there is n't only one catalan party . 
  the spanish government rejects it and re-centralize ?? 
  lol , [ on may 10 , 2006 , the amended text passed through its final reading through both houses of the parliament , with the support of all parties except both the spanish main opposition party , the conservative people 's party , and the catalan separatist party esquerra republicana de catalunya . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statute_of_autonomy_of_catalonia#2005_draft ), 
  fun fact : the independence reborns when the spanish economy crashed . 
  there are a lot of disinformation , lots of people think that they are jobless due to spain , that catalonia is great but the evil , evil spaniards steal their money , yadda yadda yadda . 
  politicians brainwhasing the youngsters so they think that spain has been always plotting against catalonia . 
  i 'm from madrid , and on the one hand i want catalonia to get his stupid independence so i do n't have to listen to any catalan victim playing about how the fascist spain is oppressing them . 
  but on the other hand if they managed to make my cousin from another country , you can be sure as hell that i 'll do whatever i can to keep catalonia out of europe . 
  i mean , they can try : [ it ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-in-juqffljc/u8ggrqy3loi/aaaaaaaac1i/q_c9wbh4k1c/s1600/60.jpg ) [ would ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vpqqhzqwqde/u_wouqbj4ki/aaaaaaaaeu4/2fjhbzg1h-8/s1600/guzman_el_bueno.jpg ) [ be ] ( http://www.fuenterrebollo.com/heraldica-piedra/burgos/cid/cid-2.jpg ) [ easy ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/spanish_military_orders_badges.svg/479px-spanish_military_orders_badges.svg.png ) . 
  marriage is a form of slavery too , you 're thinking of miscarriage, 
  is it wrong ? 
  im not a map expert so i do n't know about the details and such edit : ok , now i see it . 
  in spain most of the people see this just as catalonia wanting more fiscal autonomy ( something like what the basque country has ) . 
  this will end ( maybe not now but someday ) with catalonia getting an [ economic agreement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basque_economic_agreement ) and madrid paying even more to help the poorest regions of spain . 
  madrid is already the region with the biggest difference between what it pays to the state and what receives ( -16700 m $ ) meanwhile catalonia ( -8400 m $ ) . 
  and the basque country despite being one of the richest regions in spain pays less than what the state gives them ( +1500 m $ ) due to his economic agreement . 
  so yes , [ espanya ens roba ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bvwjbmxigaagd_l.jpg:large ) flag request : [ madrid independiente ] ( http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ecfqc5w2uoi/hqdefault.jpg ), 
  in spain all the people have the obligation to learn spanish and the right to use it . 
  for example if a parent does n't allow his kid to learn spanish he can face criminal charges ( iirc ) . 
  about catalan idk since i 'm not from catalonia but i bet they have more or less the same obligations and rights . 
  you can find some people that speaks only spanish but not catalan ( myself for example when i visit bcn in a few days ) but the other way around its impossible , well i guess that if you go to a village lost in the mountains maybe some elderly people . 
  about joining the independence , i do n't know about the balearic islands but valencia , with the bad blood they have with catalonia , i do n't see them joinning them . 
  people that talk about the balearic islands and valencia leaving spain and joining catalonia are just dreaming about conquering naples again . 
  no , greece owes us like 500 $ to each spaniards , on the other hand bankia and the rest of the banks owes 2300 $ to every single spaniards . 
  if the banks said that we wo n't see the money back i do n't see why greece has to pay . 
  also our prime minister , conservative , is one of the most critic to greece . 
  no , all territories are part of the motherland , they are not second class citizens, 
  for now but you 'll need reinforcements , the british are catching you, 
  not in spain , too much stick too little carrot and the donkey is almost dead . 
  oh yes , my bad . 
  much more civilized to kill with a [ captive bolt pistol ] ( https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/b_boddqbdkqlnb5dxkcnc7xfwexcaqko6dccykje1u8wqoant4bohm2z7m5mtn0d4nmznqsfzvhuken61u7q7augbqvct-txhodlrfjpnfuqm-rjo_k ) see ? 
  no fear at all, 
  moving out of madrid . 
  the living cost of madrid is huge, 
  hey bro , educate yourself , seems like the stereotypes about catalans being tigh fisted are right with you . 
  there is no armor , only for the horses . 
  the color red is pointless , the bull charge to movement . 
  those bulls are also send to the slaughterhouse for meat after that and his meat is expensive as fuck . 
  the average lifespan of a normal bull is 2 years , the lifespan or a spanish fighting bull is 4 years until their first corrida . 
  as i see it . 
  the bulls in the bullfighting are like the gladiators in rome and the bulls that die in the slaughterhouse are the slaves . 
  the first die publicily for enjoyment of the people and the latter die anonymously . 
  said that , i do n't like bullfighting before someone start calling me facha , pepero and something similar . 
  yeah , you may have a point unless someone like me put the context in that photo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knqwoql1jl0 the bull escaped and the police had to kill it for safety . 
  the guy is just a dumbass , it 's not like they dropped the bull corpse in the road for fun, 
  i find really interesting what is happening in madrid , it 's like a doughnut of babies surrounding madrid . 
  malta then , see europe ? 
  is not that complicated to find a solution . 
  what 's wrong with the icon ? 
  is some kind of neofascist symbol ? 
  yes , i learned to not talk to third world racist scum, 
  should have learned something more since the independence, 
  woah woah , easy there , i though only europeans could be racist . 
  from the article :  the russian aircraft were not armed , according to a u.s. defense official , and the entire matter was considered routine . 
  i do n't see any difference between both and that simulated attacks against a country needs a source, 
  depend of what you call democratic , compared to african or other developing countries yes , but russia is not at the same level than western europe . 
  can you point me to those bombers in the uk borders ( i suppose you are from the uk ) that were not in international airspace . 
  thats the only thing i 'm proud of my country . 
  if there was a referendum about kicking out the inmigrants or the politicians . 
  the politicians would be out in less than 2 days . 
  if someone wanted to say that the inmigrants are the reason why spain is fucked up they will be shut up at the moment by the people telling him that the ones bleeding out our country are the corrupt politicians and their bussiness friends . 
  the difference between english and spanish during colonization is that women were not allowed in the ships ( bad luck and that stuff ) until very late in spain . 
  so meanwhile the english married between them , the spaniards mixed with the natives , thats why there are some levels of `` white '' depending of the amount of `` purity '' or mixing in the bloodline .
