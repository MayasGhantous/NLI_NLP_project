  and also some facial features like you said . 
  thats why the amount of natives and whites vary depending of the country . 
  maybe someone knows more about this stuff and gives a better explanation, 
  you also have to bear in mind that some of the people leaving are southamericans that came to spain but now with the current situation they are coming back home . 
  i think you wanted to say international airspace, 
  no , we should assume that [ if they have long-range aircraft , they 'll want to exercise them . 
  in order to exercise them they need to fly long-range missions ] ( http://en.cihan.com.tr/news/us-admiral-russian-bombers-send-a-message-we-do-the-same_8010-chmtczodaxma== ), 
  fair enough . 
  and my whole point is that a bomber without bombs is a threat as big as a recon plane . 
  the plane is capable of carrying nuclear weapons , not that is taking its nukes for a walk . 
  do you understand english ? 
  can you explain me the definition of capable ? 
  i 'm spanish so english is not my first language , maybe i 've been wrong the whole time about the definition of capable [ the raf was forced to scramble two fighter jets today after russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons were spotted flying towards british territory . 
  ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3081829/raf-scrambles-jets-two-russian-military-aircraft-seen-flying-british-airspace.html ) maybe the one being dumb as shit is you . 
  i must be another putin bot, 
  feel free to change : `` also some kind of a bully '' with `` not coping well with its loss of superpower status '', 
  so when the uk intercepts russians planes in international airspace russia is a bully , and when russia intercepts us planes in international airspace russia is also some kind of a bully ? 
  ok , thanks , now i understand it a bit better . 
  this gif is better : http://www.muturzikin.com/imagescarte/euskara.gif, 
  woah , c'mon dude , sometimes i like to play spot the troll but with you is like playing in easy mode . 
  i 'm too in favor of a federal spain , each comunidad autonoma should have control over their finances like the basque country . 
  that way maybe we could avoid the cancer we have right now in spain with all regions wanting a university , an airport and an ave station . 
  right now i think that the concierto econ\u00f3mico is just unfair , why should basques have privileges over the rest of spain ? 
  the only argument i heard about it is due to it being the law from the middle ages , just a tradition . 
  well , guess what ? 
  bullfighting is also a tradition and that argument in both cases is bullshit . 
  yes , must be that . 
  i knew the king had to do something but i was n't sure what . 
  thanks . 
  lol , from polandball , check your sources op . 
  spain : community of madrid has an anthem, 
  it is pointless to discuss anymore . 
  believe what you want and i 'll do the same . 
  maybe you are interested in this little [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/374s5i/this_week_i_was_banned_from_400_subreddits_in_a/ ), 
  your point being ? 
  the anthem of spain represents spain and all spaniards not the king and its institutions . 
  the speaker was saying the name of the players . 
  he is the mod of almost 200 subs . 
  except what they booed was the anthem of spain , not the anthem of the king ( if something like that even exist ) . 
  also when the speaker was talking in spanish he was also booed . 
  the language which basques and catalans have to use to understand each others . 
  in a tournament called copa del rey , i see no flaws in your logic . 
  someone that really would like to secede from spain would n't go to a match called copa del rey . 
  i do n't like the church thats why i dont go to mass , i do n't go to the church to boo the priest . 
  it 's called being logical . 
  in spain you need to ask permission to the king ( i do n't know exactly how ) to have the title royal in the team like real madrid , real sociedad , etc. 
  i never have a fa\u00e7ade , i 'm always against the independence . 
  [ and playing behind close door is what france does when the anthem is being booed ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/7671299.stm ) independentist , demanding respect while showing none, 
  no , maybe you ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/srbosjek_\\ ( knife \\ ) _ used_in_croatia _ - _ 1941 % e2 % 80 % 931945 . jpg ), 
  it is what france does when the anthem is booed by the public, 
  indepentards nothing new under the sun here in spain . 
  the next time we should stop the match and play it behind closed doors after the first sign that the anthem is being booed . 
  you do exist and damn good of an anthem you have, 
  hey , how is your anarchocapitalist stuff going ? 
  i bow to this man , man i said ? 
  i mean legend . 
   alone, 
  i 'm right behind you . 
  that works for ireland too, 
  the bullfighting supporters here in spain use a similar argument , they say that the regular cow that goes to the slaughterhouse only lives 2 years , meanwhile the spanish fighting bull lives between 4 to 5 years in open fields until their first bullfight . 
  well , if spain does n't exports olive oil then the exports of olive oil from italy will be reduced to 50 %, 
  cool story bro, 
  [ created just 30 min ago ? 
  ] ( http://a.disquscdn.com/uploads/mediaembed/images/2008/7979/original.jpg ), 
  what have you done dude ? 
  just ignore them independentist gona independent, 
  greece agrees with you, 
  a german friend of mine always says that berlin is a blackhole sucking money from the rest of germany . 
  i 'm not really sure about that , he also says `` nice '' things to brandenburg too , he is from munchen if that clarifies something . 
  if someone from germany can give me some context , or another point of view i 'll be happy . 
  oh god i would love to see some blonde , pale sweden in the fence of melilla when hundreds of africans are jumping the fence . 
  yes , this comment is kinda stupid but it 's the first that came to my mind . 
  i though memes were not allowed ... fascist mods are slacking off ... 
  sure , with a 23 % unemployment the thing we need is more useless people that does n't know even the language and expect to be taken care of . 
  yeah , i 'm talking about the people , if instead of russia it was poland , the tone of the comments would be very different . 
  you are free to fuck whoever you want as long as you do n't fuck me . 
  it 's not that funny , you guys just like it because he is talking shit about russia , if instead of russia the video was about any other country being shit the redditors here wo n't give a fuck . 
  you just have to tell them than they are special unlike the rest of the plebs of the peninsula and that spain steals their money and here you go , another indepentard . 
  3 % of spain ? 
  buddy , gibraltar is literally a rock . 
  they have to close the main road so the planes can take off . 
  it was just a joke , but anyway i 'm sure you would n't mind having a spanish colony in cornwall . 
  how is switzerland n\u00ba 27 and spain n\u00ba 28 ? 
  if we beat them in all columns ( except for 10k soldiers ) , also we spend almost 3 times more, 
  cough cough gibraltar cough cough espa\u00f1ol on a more serious note , please give madrid access to the sea . 
  valencia is practically east madrid , they do n't mind ( who cares anyway ? ), 
  glorious dostoievski master race . 
  with a 25 % unemployment the less we need is more people to take care off . 
  the illegal inmigrants that jump the fence in ceuta and melilla are kicked back to morocco at the spot . 
   except that it is a tradition that works . 
  we historically have been richer and more economically efficient than every other spanish region ( except madrid and catalonia ) , much less corruption , less debt , less unemployment . 
  instead of thinking of taking that right away from us , perhaps we should think of giving it to everyone else . 
  i can get behind that . 
  why do you think catalu\u00f1a deserves that privilege ? 
  i do n't think the basque country deserve the concierto economico just because is a tradition , los toros are also a tradition , so i think that argument is worthless . 
  i still ca n't understand how some people find fair that they should have privileges over the people of galicia , murcia , madrid , leon , etc. 
  you are damn right about it , people that does n't want to vote the psoe anymore and are afraid of podemos ( venezuela , communism and stuff ) sudenly see c 's and decided to vote for them since they are leftist , new and not radicals unlike podemos . 
  if you think about it , is a good strategy , really clever . 
  they take votes from the left and from the right . 
  dude , if you become president i do n't want to live in the same country as you .
