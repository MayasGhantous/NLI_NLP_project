  if you think that 's a fine standard of living , good for you . 
  africa is actually one of my weakest points . 
  but here it goes . 
  i 'm on my way to work , so i 'll just give you some ** specific ** topics to google : * patrice lumamba and the congolese elections ( `` lumamba congo '' in google will probably suffice ) . 
  or how a leader that cuold 've changed the country for the best was replaced by one who sacked and pillaged it . 
  * 1973 opec oil embargo and african economics * african country debt origins * effects of african colonization on the economy ( this paper from the university of tennesse is a good start ) http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1182&amp;context=utk_chanhonoproj that should give you a start . 
  if you have more questions i would be more than glad to answer them later today/tonight . 
  pardon my harsh earlier reply , but the more i reddit on this sub , the more i am faced with the victims of misinformation , and it boils my blood how that misinformation shapes the politics of an entire continent . 
  heck i would consider that instead getting bent over and railed in the ass by the troika any further . 
  people love going on about russia , but just a quick look at the usa 's history leaves you disgusted . 
  putin 's a saint next to the shit the usa 's pulled off . 
  source : i read . 
  what variant of communism ? 
  stalin-lenninist or something closer to actual marxism ? 
  one question . 
  suppose you have two aspiring politicians , pa and pb . 
  now assume that pb has a million euros and pa only has a thousand euros . 
  which campaign do you think will be more likely to succeed ? 
  now , do you see the problem ? 
  ( well , one of many ) . 
  every second i spend on / r/europe convinces me more and more that us southern nations need to form our own union . 
  heck even have a south euro and north euro or whatever . 
  i have no words . 
  you give germans a bad name . 
  if only there was a way to have reluctant politicians ... career politicians are a disease to democracy . 
  i know man , it 's so fucking sad . 
  how dare you bring reason to an / r/europe conversation about greece ? 
  shame on you !, 
  8 uptvotes ?!!, 
  what the fuck ... people say the first sentence out loud . 
  then think . 
  then say it out loud again . 
  repeat until you realize how you sound . 
  nice flair . 
  you got a chuckle out of me . 
   what the hell is wrong with this subreddit ? 
  i often ask this myself . 
  we either get german gov ' t mouthpieces , which are clearly repeating propaganda , or we get sneaky posts like the op . 
  to those not wholly informed and reading critically , it would definitely sound true . 
  shhh , you ca n't speak about that here !, 
  it 's merkel all the way down . 
  im going to hazard a guess and say he was doing a play on words . 
  the op called the slander ( because it 's nothing but slander , truth my fucking ass ) :  objective truth so objective propaganda is simply a play on the original quote . 
  if you 're using oxymoron to also take a jab at oxi ( oximoron ) , then you are not only low on reading comprehension , but a fool as well . 
  `` hey man i 'm just trying to run a business '' , said the loan shark, 
  your last paragraph 9000x !!, 
  it is exactly what i think a good politician should do . 
  his job is improving his country , not getting reelected . 
  he gave greece a fighting chance by not accepting a suicide request for greece from the troika . 
  then he lets power go at the point where others would exploit . 
  i also think it beautiful how he got the eu politicians to show their true colors . 
  um , did you read the first sentence ? 
  also : * 250-300 eur food ( about 8-10 eur/day at the supermarket ) * 50 eur utilities * 50 eur public transport . 
  100 eur `` disposable '' income at most . 
  ** i seem to have missed the announcement where this is a race to the bottom . 
  yeah , we 're nowhere near as fucked . 
  the main problem is there * are * some jobs , but they pay next to nothing . 
  i was working as junior consultant and literally earned 900 eur after taxes , my rent is about 400 eur . 
  yeah , not happy at all , especially with over time . 
  pretty much took the job to get the experience on my resume . 
  i 've met plenty of programmers as well who are lucky to earn 1000 eur . 
  that 's with at least a couple of years experience . 
  cost of living is a bit more expensive ( nominally ) than in germany , but since you 're earning comparatively less you really notice the difference . 
  cannabis is cheap as fuck though . 
  1 eur/gram in some places , 
  idk man , the sentiment here is somewhat in favor of syriza 's decision . 
  if spain gets pushed around by the troika , i would n't be surprised to see us heading down a similar path greek has taken ( in terms of telling the troika to f off ) if a leftist party gets elected ( iu/podemos for example ) . 
  we definitely are : /, 
  yeah not so much in spain . 
  artificial ! = unnecessary . 
  refreshingly polite . 
  have an upvote !, 
  copy-pasting from another comment of mine :  the debt is due more to predatory lending and an aristocracy of the wealthy class than the will of the average greek citizen . 
  it is ** morally unjustifiable ** to punish them further with the excuse of something as artificial as money . 
  as a tax-paying spanish citizen , i am completely fine with this . 
  in fact , i applaud the greeks . 
  they did n't let the troika bend their arm . 
   us southern countries have not only been empoverished due to capital flight towards the northern countries , mainly germany , but we have also been subjected to harsh austerity measures which notable economists such as stiglitz , krugman , and i believe at some point piketty have called out as harmful and counter-productive . 
  we are not major exporting countries ( aside from olive oil/wine ) . 
  we rely on internal consumption for economic growth , which austerity greatly cripples . 
  even more effective if you froth at the mouth while wearing lipstick . 
  i invite you to head to / r/wikileaks , the troika has n't had the greeks best interests at heart from the start ... 
  well , to begin with the country already * was * divided , this referendum simply took a tally of that . 
  second , i think it was a brilliant play by syriza . 
  the debt is due more to predatory lending and an aristocracy of the wealthy class than the will of the average greek citizen . 
  it is morally unjustifiable to punish them further with the excuse of something as artificial as ** money ** .

  beautiful . 
  congratulations to you guys from spain !, 
  let 's keep our fingers crossed , you never know which way things may go . 
  i hope to god not . 
  upvote just for the names . 
  the gay-gee-bee and the cheerleaders . 
  sounds like the line-up for an lgbt music festival . 
  this pretty much .
