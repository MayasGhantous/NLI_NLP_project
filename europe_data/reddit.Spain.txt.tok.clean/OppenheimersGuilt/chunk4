  i 'm actually sorry for the greeks . 
  just so i can get an idea : how much would you normally pay to rent a room as a university student in a city ? 
  how much in sofia ( not city center obviously ) ? 
  how much do you spend on groceries for one day ? 
  how many euros is a big mac ? 
  ** edit : thanks to / u/emk2203 , who provided the following [ link ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=bulgaria&amp;country2=greece&amp;city1=sofia&amp;city2=athens ) . 
  ** data shows that :  indices difference info consumer prices in athens are 54.97 % higher than in sofia  consumer prices including rent in athens are 50.15 % higher than in sofia  rent prices in athens are 30.10 % higher than in sofia  restaurant prices in athens are 92.38 % higher than in sofia  groceries prices in athens are 52.49 % higher than in sofia  local purchasing power in athens is 7.51 % lower than in sofia with the summary that :  you would need around 2,302.89 $ ( 4,504.52 \u043b\u0432 ) in athens to maintain the same standard of life that you can have with 3,000.00 \u043b\u0432 in sofia ( assuming you rent in both cities ) . 
  this calculation uses our consumer prices including rent index . 
  this comparison assumes net earnings ( after income tax ) . 
  ** i have no hate whatsoever for bulgaria , one of my childhood friends who i 'm fondest of lives in sofia . 
  what bugs me is the complete lack of sympathy for greeks . 
  really . 
  we 're all poor nations together guys . 
  and no , that 25 year old unemployed young greek at his wits end still living with his parents is not to blame for the crisis . 
  ca n't believe people would honestly suggest that . 
  ** ** ever heard of predatory lending ? 
  of course i do n't think it 's right she lost her job and think it 's fucking primitive they 're offended , but i can understand how it would come about . 
  these guys all their life have had those values , and are probably at a breaking point where the slightest thing will seem offensive . 
  so while it fucking sucks , give these women ** paid leave ** , have some cultural reaching out and education , and bring together these two conflicting elements and see if we can build some tolerance in this community . 
  p.s i got to share apartments for about a year and a half with south east asians , and the vastly different cultures we had really opened my mind to just how differently some people can perceive the same events . 
  you 're amazing at sweeping generalizations . 
  guess what ? 
  i moved to germany from another western country and the experience was the opposite . 
  no training classes or anything like that . 
  the closest thing was the free language courses from the university , but i doubt the typical refugee is a student at a german university . 
  also , do you even hang around expats ? 
  a huge portion of the time expats ( me included ) complain about the stuff that 's different and how we wish it would be like home and many talk about `` shitty germany '' . 
  before you take a moral high ground do n't forget basic human psychology : ** ingroups and outgroups ** . 
  when you 're amongst people from your own country and you 're in a foreign country , that will usually be one of your ingroups while you 're hanging out together . 
   anyone who comes here and does n't integrate has no one to blame but themselves . 
  once again , you just simplify shit and make a value judgement . 
  reality is much more complex than that . 
  ** did you know ... ** * i witnessed plenty of discrimination from germans towards southern europeans * i witnessed plenty of germans cursing at the amount of turks in germany ( which is ironic given why turks are in germany ) * i saw many foreigners integrate successfully for various reasons ( including never experience discrimination ) * i also saw many foreigners stay isolated in ethnic groups for many reasons including discrimination, 
  the ideal solution would be to have assimilation centers distributed according to refugee density with the aim of having people of similar culture teaching them the cultural differences , what 's right and what 's wrong , etc. . . 
  so this is being treated wrong from the start . 
  i 'm 100 % in favor of refugee and migration in general , but cultural assimilation is a complex process which must be done right . 
  this also includes understanding that those who just arrived will experience some kind of culture shock , not to mention whatever other trauma they may or may not bring from their circumstances . 
  as a socialist , nothing irritates me more than having to spend 20 minutes deconstructing common myths and tropes just to have a meaningful discussion . 
  # socialism is like ice cream . 
  there 's flavors for everyone . 
  socialism ! = big state . 
  many variants are specifically of a decentralized style such as anarcho-syndicalism . 
  there have been socialist projects other than china and the ussr . 
  the history of socialism is intrinsically tied to american interventionism . 
  for more on this : - iww ( international workers of the world ) - eugene v. debs - chile '73 coup - cointelpro # other interesting alternatives to socialism and capitalism ### research : participatory economics - michael albert ; gift economy - piotr kropotkin . 
  because as far as i know , integration is a * process * not an instantaneous event . 
  oh my god the paranoia . 
  well is n't that a shame . 
  ( sarcasm ) maybe the deal creators should n't have made such a shitty deal and should n't try to pass it in democracies . 
  you 're damn right i want every little detail negotiated . 
  i 'm not fond of getting fucked over . 
  are you ? 
  if i 'm not mistaken , assad is n't the sole actor in the situation , and it would be naive to assume no outside forces such as western powers had a hand in making the situation what it is now . 
  it should be clear to anyone that assad is being used , whether legitimately or not , as an entry point into the region for western nations to further extend their spheres of influence . 
  i have to say this is one piece of propaganda whose aims i agree with . 
  it would be beautiful if war stopped being such good business . 
   why are countries exempt from this and not people ? 
  because countries can pay more than almost any single person . 
  locker alter, 
   assad is the reason for the refugee influx funny , i thought it was the ** fact that there 's a war going on ** . 
   teenage virgin nerds awfully specific projection of yourself there , bud . 
  i lived in germany for some years . 
  german media strongly resembles american media . 
  it 's all one big consolidated bubble of propaganda for the most part . 
   that individuals in the gulf states finance isis for ideological reasons is true but also irrelevant from a foreign relations perspective . 
  if you were dropped on your head , you 'd be smarter . 
  i 'd say it 's more of a stretch than a lie . 
  europe has been divided between many different kingdoms over and over again . 
  at one point spain was arabic . 
  at one point germany was 3 different kingdoms , all at war with each other . 
  at one point germanic tribes invaded spain . 
  at one point the uk was nordic and french . 
  etc. . heck , at one point large parts of africa and asia could be considered european . 
  guess what else ? 
  it was bureaucratically simpler to migrate . 
  they can apply for a visa . 
  i do n't understand what is wrong with that . 
  i 'm grateful everyday my ancestors were european because i got to live here , have my grandpa treated twice for cancer at no cost , got a great education and the experience of living in several countries without visa headaches !, 
  i 'm a white hispanic ( my family went to venezuela from spain , italy and france a little before wwi ) and i grew up in the usa before coming to europe ( been here 10 years already ) . 
  migration is one of the most common tropes throughout human history . 
  the search for a better life . 
  heck , anyone who 's ever studied colonial history would know of how intrinsic is immigration to humankind . 
  we should n't adopt the `` keep these foreigners out of my country ! '', 
  position . 
  it 's ridiculous and if you go back far enough we 're all foreigners . 
  do n't fall into the common pattern of saying : `` i 'm all for the search for a better life but all the immigrants that are coming bring < insert bigoted statements  with them '' . 
  it 's a cop-out . 
  prepare assimilation and integration centers . 
  massively recruit syrian \\ lebanese \\ etc. . . locals that will volunteer to counsel on the best way to receive these immigrants . 
  set up cultural crash courses , where immigrants get the basics on the culture here . 
  a 20 minute lecture with powerpoints , some national that has lived here a long time that can help illuminate the differences . 
  no need to touch controversial topics like abortion and stuff . 
  just social etiquette that may differ , the important social institutions like finanzamt or instituto nacional de empleo , o what have you . 
  teach really quickly about free speech . 
  most people might come from a place where censorship was common , so they would not view it as bad . 
  we should be taking these refugees in and helping them assimilate and contribute to our society !, 
  for a country that still retains a strong sense of national identity whilst being ethnically diverse , just look at the usa . 
  they did it right a long time ago . 
  the immigrants also came from widely diverse backgrounds , like the early italian immigrants . 
  when they went to the usa , in italy the practice of fuitina or bride kidnapping was still common in the south and in sicily .
