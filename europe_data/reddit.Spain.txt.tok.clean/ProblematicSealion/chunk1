toblerone mains on suicide watch . 
  i do n't think trump has the blood of hundreds of thousands on his hands . 
  for now , anyway . 
  #high energy, 
  if this is what attention looks like , i want none of it . 
  yep , i 'm hoping for trump as well . 
  i could n't care less about some clown without political correctness and a wall fetish , but i do care about the warmonger saudi-funded maniac that will probably end up razing yet another mena country and dumping even more problems onto europe . 
  fine the shit out of them . 
   you can finish your entire compulsory education without even trying . 
  then what 's the point of 2 hours of daily , useless , homework then ? 
  i literally never bothered with it and got to 2\u00ba bach with perfectly fine grades . 
  i do n't see how not wanting two or three extra hours of useless busywork on an already pretty filled schedule is continuing any particular stereotype , those hours can be used for actually productive stuff or just letting kids be kids . 
  we need good teachers and well developed programs , not completely pointless homework . 
   understand that you ca n't be a moron and get away with it in france . 
  careful , someone is knocking on your door . 
   also why do we want our youth going to hevy metal concerts ? 
  i do n't care , i do n't care if they buy some other particular kind of media either . 
  the real question is why would you care that youth do n't read books in a world where the internet exists and allows anyone to learn and comunicate about virtually anything , for free in most cases . 
  other than the cringeworthy sense of pseudointellectualism that seems to surround books that is . 
  if this had anything to do with `` culture '' they would let them spend it in theathes , videogames , music , movies , open source software conventions or some venue where gaudi people do weird dancing with flower pots on their heads . 
  of course not , only muh intellectual books are * culture * , what are you ? 
  a barbarian ? 
  i bet you do intellectually inferior things like watching movies , listening to music , colaborating on an open source sotware initiative , enjoying a good monologue or even ... gasp , playing videogames . 
  i love the idea of governments throwing away public money to subsidize some particular kinds of media . 
  seems pretty logical , not to mention fair towards other kinds of creation . 
   * mobility of people is closely linked to free flow of finance , goods and services . 
  poor royal highness , such hardships she has to endure . 
  that 's a lot of gipsies . 
  we indeed get special treatment in anything involving agressions , employment , the refusal of a service , etc. . . they call it equal rights but some people are more equal than others . 
  check your privileges . 
   credibility to need for special considerations some of us are actually trying to end those special considerations . 
  oh my god stop being so bigoted , it 's 2016 . 
  brazil / japan or argentina / germany . 
  your argument is invalid . 
  franco !, 
  yeah stuff like `` racism '' , `` sexism '' or the suffix '' - phobia '' are absolutely nothing more than buzzwords at this point . 
  is pap\u00e1 garz\u00f3n aware that you 're sexually harrasing people over tcp/ip ? 
  absolutely disgusting . 
   * everything but the party that i vote for is different incremental versions of party_that_i_dont_like . 
  * it never gets old . 
   that 's why they fit quite well as the new iu , to protest against the heteropatriarchy , makes us check our priviliges and get naked in churches . 
  the good fights . 
  lmao, 
  this is not a football match . 
  shall we remember what happened to the last pp politician that tried to push an anti-abortion law ? 
  it would be wise to look at what they actually do , rather than what their marketing says . 
  no , you broke it . 
  pp gives 0 shits about divorce , abortion , gay marriage , having more local governments ( the more politicians they can push into them , the better ) or bringing labor costs down by importing half of south america in less than a decade . 
  seems like you 're not paying much attention to what they actually do , if any . 
  a bunch of tards burn a catalan flag -  * they 're all fascists !!, 
  ! 1111 ! 1 * a bunch of tards burn a spanish flag -  * they do n't represent us , obviously . 
  * you ca n't make this shit up . 
  24 years living in coru\u00f1a , coming from a fairly conservative family and i 've yet to see a francoist spain flag in real life . 
  i 've seen them on 2\u00babach history book , random internet photos ( stereotypical far lefties seem to love it ) and that 's it . 
  why ? 
  i do n't feel unwelcome , not i would care about it if i did . 
  your problem mate , deal with it . 
  if they do n't feel welcome they should leave as well . 
  leave then . 
  i do n't see why should we stop using american for international stuff , the us is still as relevant as ever . 
  yes . 
  kids doing kid things . 
  i 'd point out that adults behaving like petulant children * should * be worrying , but surely that would be fascist of me . 
   we ca n't just pretend bad shit did n't happen yeah , we should build a strawman and beat it for more than 40 years instead . 
  super productive stuff . 
  and is how some people having different political views a problem ? 
  that 's the point of representative democracy . 
   start a dialogue about the history of spain what is that even supposed to mean ? 
  super cool stories bro . 
  they govern with the support of the people , period . 
  pp has been was the most voted party by a fair margin , and the gap keeps growing with every election , deal with it . 
   ** social security ** , workers rights and ** welfare system ** was created by psoe actually , those were created by franco . 
  we ** are ** running on a unilateral pp budget , but by all means , do n't let reality get in the way of ideology . 
  but `` spain is currently working as usual '' does not get you teh clicks . 
  i was going to do a [ santiago train crash ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozywilevyps ) joke , but you went even darker . 
   i cant think anyone is seriously suggesting your own body is not your exclusive property . 
  and yet deciding to shut down that body is illegal in most of the world . 
  he said spain , not catalonia ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  needs more dramatic music over perfectly normal parliament debates . 
  ahh yes , the good old `` free speech '' but only up to the point that my feels decide . 
  headline should be `` global hypocrisy still the norm '' . 
   thinking outside the box could we not take the stupid buzzwords out of the office ? 
   monarchies are an insult to democracy . 
  all those monarchies are completely perpendicular to demo ** cracy ** , they do n't have any kind of say in governance . 
  the `` king '' is nothing more than a fancier , more neutral head of state . 
  look at that hottie . 
  come on belgium , it 's 2016 . 
   i would risk my own life every time . 
  that 's what you tell yourself anyway . 
  but reality is that humans ca n't recieve stimuli , simulate several fairly complex scenarios , make a decision and carry it out in miliseconds , let alone make pretty hard moral judgements along the way . 
  in that situation some reflex would take over , and god knows what would happen ... we might as well roll a dice . 
   if the software can not be programmed adequately , then the technology should be kept off the roads . 
  sure , but that 's not remotely the case , even with some unexpected quirks and edge cases the average ad software is already ** vastly ** better than the best human drivers at both driving efficiently and saving lives . 
  the only rational decision would be to keep humans off the roads , not the opposite . 
   i like to think i would attempt to swerve out of the way to avoid a child potentially running over 3 other people , hitting another car with 2 babies inside or a tree and killing your entire family . 
  dude it 's current_year , that free trade nonsense is so pass\u00e9 . 
   argentina is predominantly white not sure if memes or memes . 
   becauses it 's necessary to achieve gender parity , which is a mark of a civilized nation ? 
  in your purely personal opinion . 
  the is the most stupid thing i 've read in like 48 hours .
