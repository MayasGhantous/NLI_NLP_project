  you mad bro . 
  it would make more sense to track down and arrest the ones invading countries instead . 
   going `` battlestar galactica '' on it i 'll ~ ~ copy ~ ~ ~ ~ pirate ~ ~ steal this . 
   some un-elected bureaucrat we 've never heard of ? 
  * as opposed to some noble in our feudal-style unelected upper house , the paragons of our glorious british democracy . 
   i 'm being freed from a vile elitist globalist abhorrent supranational political union . 
  that 's a lot of angsty adjectives . 
  a bunch of politicians that have vaginas , how interesting . 
  the germanisation of europe continues . 
  dropbox so haram . 
  call me bby . 
  yeah sure , all people were clearly happy and joyful with what the republic was turning into . 
  war started in a cosmic vaccum and people changed their opinion at that precise instant because franco told them so . 
  yeah , reality is people were fucked either way . 
  super low quality bait . 
   chorizo is a pretty damn good combination with rice . 
  you should throw some ketchup in there as well . 
   ethically wrong lawl, 
   it 's ridiculous why ? 
   so you see how ridiculous it is . 
  i do , that 's why i do n't think we should even bother with any of this stuff . 
  after brexit i would just close the gibraltar 's border , not give any of them visas and pretend it simply does n't exist . 
   when they give ceuta to morocco . 
  more like give morroco back to ceuta . 
  ceuta was a significant human settlement for hundreds of years before the idea of morrocco was even a thing . 
  sleepy , right after siesta time . 
  what is it ? 
  or we could all just enjoy a nice beer every now and then without all that demagogic drama . 
  as in , chunks of ( allegedly ) human brain in a car trunk . 
   it 's europe !!!, 
  it is also current_year !, 
  first scene shows a russian ( ? ), 
  military dude shouting at , beating and humilliating unarmed soldiers on their knees . 
  after that it shows several short scenes of foreheads completely blown up , brain bits laying around and another military guy dragging corpses with completely disfigured faces ( some carved with a heavy knife , maybe a machete ) . 
  last scene is the guys from the first one being rounded up and forced to walk around local population , there 's plenty of shouting , spitting , beating and generally nasty stuff as you would imagine . 
  / u/verylateish / u/aeliandil / u/amyulaw, 
  i was referring to coru\u00f1a because that 's the example i gave in the previous comment . 
  but i 'm pretty sure you could do it in pretty much every city that still has some sort of bull stuff , exceptions being pamplona ( morally superior guiris sure love san ferm\u00edn once a year ) and maybe madrid . 
   * it 's less problematic because we only severely stress and psychologically scar the bull instead of using pointy things * that moral high ground is below sea level already . 
  removing the municipal grant was enough to make it completely disappear , which is the perfect scenario imo , i rather see people organically lose interest in it than ban it for the thrill of telling other people what they ca n't do . 
  and unlike you guys with that fancy plaza at barcelona , we never had a significative demand to begin with . 
  and no one outside a few big plazas ( barcelona among them ) and pamplona likes that shit in the rest of spain either . 
  you would n't need a ban to stop if there was virtually no demand to begin with , case in point : coru\u00f1a, 
  franco 's fantasy of a somehow centralized spain where everyone is * just * spanish , speaks only the `` spanish language '' and does `` spanish things '' died with him , it 's not relevant to current spanish politics in any way , even the most centralist party ( ciudadanos ) is perfectly aware of those differences . 
  but even that fantasy had elements from castille , andalusia , catalonia , aragon ... 
   let 's kill and torture animals for fun ** again ** !, 
  [ implying you have ever stopped . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f341g9i.jpg ) but let me guess , torturing animals * catalan style * is better because reasons , everyone knows that . 
   spanish-spanish tradition what is that even supposed to be ? 
  spain is and has always been a bunch of cultures somewhat stitched together . 
  there 's no such thing as `` spanish-spanish '' outside the context of tourism marketing . 
  i find your comment offensive , i would kindly ask you to remove it , please . 
   but alt-right is pretty hard to define that 's the thing with stupid buzzwords . 
   what makes someone an alt-right these days ? 
  voting for the sincere clown instead of the savage warmonger afaik . 
   2016  valve hats guy, 
   pepe ermagherd the alt-right \u2122 has crossed the atlantic !! 1 !, 
  the massively ugly parts of lebos 's occupation will conveniently not be shown of course . 
   they just tend to have higher grades and test scores but that clearly opresses brown people that do n't work as much like juan and fernanda . 
  they should become stupider , that 'd be the fair \u2122 thing to do . 
   trump wants stonger libel laws to silence press libel laws do n't silence press unless that `` press '' is spouting lies . 
  yeah , better blame the politicians \u2122 instead . 
  looks like we 're finally stepping out of mr. 2008 's wild ride . 
  only took us a decade \\ o /, 
   hang it outside like a barbarian u fkn wot m8 ? 
   it means psoe could be splitted in two , literally . 
  * and nothing of value was lost . 
   if she does , i 'm leaving the country . 
  lmao, 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's how everyone but southern spain pictures southern spain . 
  dev/sysadmin master race ? 
  but * france is france * and * germany is germany * . 
  into the banter folder it goes . 
  ca n't wait for the next discussion on american police brutality , jimmies will surely be rustled . 
   siesta the wall around olivenza just got 10 ~ ~ ft ~ ~ m higher . 
   it 's quite normal for exceptions to be made in all sorts of situations on medical and religious grounds . 
  where do you live ? 
  it 's certainly not `` normal '' to make exceptions on religious grounds in spain and the ones that have been already made in * less fortunate * times are hugely criticized . 
   are you going to deny a passport to stephen hawking because he ca n't hold his head straight and needs his wheelchair in the picture ? 
  if stephen hawking held his face in a weird position and carried around a wheelchair because * an imaginary friend told him to * then he would be denied a passport indeed . 
  but he happens to be physically required to do so since i 'm pretty sure that not having als is not a decision that you get to make , this is by far the most shitty comparison in this thread , and you 've make quite a few of them . 
  we do have the strongest leaders ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) which reminds me , is your body ready to have [ this handsome fellow ] ( http://i.imgur.com/firghyo.jpg ) as pm coming 2020 ? 
  so * spain fails to turn page on franco 's legacy * because some random publisher did n't bother creating new editions of some particular books that hardly anyone cares about ( there would indeed be new editions if the demand was there ) . 
  i wonder at what point did ft become yet another glorified blog . 
  are we doing the whole `` technically correct '' thing ? 
  ** fact ** : cutting people 's breasts out reduces the risk of breast cancer by 100 % . 
   \\ - hello bby  \\ - ur penis is creepy , eww, 
  actual , enforced borders and pragmatic diplomacy . 
  things that holier-than-thou * northerners * used to be anal about before reality knocked on the door . 
  what 's wrong ? 
   we 've surpassed them , leaving them behind would only be logical . 
  people are not logical . 
   except it never will adapt . 
  maybe you should pay some attention ? 
   religion does n't fit in the modern world and it probably never will . 
  ftfy not that i necessarily agree , though . 
   `` please support us . '', 
  we ca n't if you do n't provide us a png to overlay on our avatars . 
   the gitanos probably predate the spanish on the iberian peninsula , but the spanish , who are generally ridiculously racist , hate the gitanos ( except for the flamenco ) . 
  lawl,
