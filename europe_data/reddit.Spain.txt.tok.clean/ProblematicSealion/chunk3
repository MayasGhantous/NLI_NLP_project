   maybe worth remembering what the cops have usually done to us throughout history they 've been lovely to me so far , thanks for asking . 
   2016  nytimes.com lol, 
   just, 
   with the way corporate governance laws are written , boards could be sued by shareholders for not taking advantage of every legal method for minimizing tax . 
  that 's certainly not the case in the eu . 
  the yellow response is completely pointless . 
  you do n't know , that 's a fact , regardless of what you chose to believe . 
   common sense please define . 
  why would anyone care about un 's opinion on anything ? 
  c o u r a g e, 
  it 's worse , actually . 
  i might get an iphone se before they butcher it as well , love that phone . 
  he 's also long dead , which means that not one but two zombies must be running things ... spooky . 
  yes m8 , we 're gon na drive some madrilenian tanks through your house after we done with catalonia . 
  first warning . 
  truly shocking , really . 
  because you 're leeching the benefits of herd immunity . 
  only if the water in unnatural and has * chemicals * in it . 
  * `` i was not taking clients at that particular point . 
  '' * there . 
  it 's all about winning the oppression olympics . 
  logic and reason are not applied here . 
   i 'd say medvedev 's the bottom half in the relationship . 
  i 'd say you vastly underestimate how much stereotypical * tough guys * actually love the d. 
  funny how it actually still holds up . 
   maybe if they stopped drinking and looking for work outside their comfort zone , they would n't be in this situation . 
  maybe if non-whites fixed their shitty countries , they would n't have to come to europe . 
  high energy !, 
  * let me tell you about how oppressed you are ... *, 
  nyt is a glorified blog at this point , i do n't understand why anyone would care about their latest post . 
  but then again , i do n't know how anyone could take one of their 20yo articles , compare to the shit they spew now and say that journalism is not dead with a straight face . 
  the sooner the better . 
  no , they not . 
  that 's like saying i 'm free to kill all your family , with some consequences . 
  gypsies continuously spit on the privileges that our societies ( the spanish one at least ) still offer them . 
  fuck them . 
   `` we have to temporarily accept reality '' lmfao, 
  but mohamed is some fairy tale that irrational adults entertain themselves with while the italian earthquake is objective reality and people ceased to live because of it . 
  the whole comparison is pants-on-head retarded . 
   i think nobody finds it funny you think wrong . 
  but he 's swiss , so he does n't have that silly german guilt . 
  well i did n't , wish you the best . 
  why is shit from a glorified blog like the guardian allowed when other equally or even less shitty sites are blacklisted ? 
  not that i agree with taking the power away from users in the first place , but at least be consistent . 
  how dumb do we have to be to do we reach a point where we need a `` refugee camp '' in france / uk ? 
  who is at war ? 
  is ireland at war ? 
  is belgium ? 
  germany maybe ? 
  the situation is completely absurd . 
  i 've heard it they have ** chemicals ** ( ! ), 
  as well . 
   or is that more of a fluid self-concept depending on the topic ? 
  ah yes , the schr\u00f6dinger identity . 
  works great for ethnic spaniards in the us , you can identify as `` spaniard '' to be white and thus privileged but ocasionally identify as `` spanish '' to pass as a brown people and earn those sweet oppression points when needed . 
  really convenient . 
  but eta is basque , are you implying that basques are actually spanish ? 
  you 're one oppressive fascist m8 . 
  see ? 
  turkey is totally europe . 
   faith is something you have a choice about you absolutely have , 100 % . 
  we 're not talking about computers that were programmed islam , following a religion or anything else that you decide to believe in is 100 % choice , period . 
  completely false equivalence , since he did n't choose to be polish . 
  but i would be perfectly fine with someone not serving me for being spanish , it 's a market and therefore their loss . 
  lol academia, 
  [ what if i told you that spain is not all arid landcapes , sun and overcrowded beaches with boiling water ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/green_spain ) my current city is significantly more rainy than dublin during winter / spring / autumm , i 'll gladly trade more rain for a lower temperature ( around 5\u00bac difference over the year ) , dryer cold is nicer to deal with . 
  keep in mind that virtually all of them have been living here for at least 10 years since that 's the minimum requirement for citizenship if not you 're european / spanish-speaking south american . 
  while some might decide to do that , these are not the usual migrants that just pass by on their way to germoney . 
  absolutely haram . 
  ireland . 
  same weather , mostly english speaking , tons of interesting it stuff going and irish dudes , which are bros all around . 
   wikipedia is an open and community effort lmfao, 
   what happened to the podemos party that won the last elections ? 
  s o r p a s s o o r p a s s o, 
  i do n't know what they want , but making themselves 100 % irrelevant is the only thing these laws will accomplish . 
  clearly this is how you compete with silicon valley . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ lmao, 
  what i believe is irrelevant , it already does in several ways . 
   and the message is the government can control what you wear . 
  ** newsflash ** : it already does . 
  take your clothes off and go take a walk , let us know how it goes . 
  victimhood is a pretty lucrative business lately , but you do n't need a degree to set up a patreon account . 
  do n't forget journalism and biology . 
   * i studied biology because i like animals and wanted to work at the zoo . 
   the most expensive degree in spain would n't cost much more than 1.500 euro a year . 
  not if you go private , and for many fields you need to if you want the good stuff . 
  for example , esade offers by far the best business degree in spain and it costs [ 14800 $ / year ] ( http://www.esade.edu/grados/esp/admision/coste ) . 
   the university is massified , in a good sense . 
  i 'd say it 's massified in a bad sense , a very significant part of the people are going to university just because ( '' * que mis hijos estudien !!! 111 !!!, 
  * '' ) and would be a lot better suited for pursuing technical education . 
  logic dictates that i should n't be making more money with a 2 year fpii than ** all ** the former high school friends with 4 year degrees that i 'm still in touch with , some of them ca n't even find a job related to their field while students from some fps start recieving job offers before even leaving the classroom . 
  is not a strawman whatsoever , every single law ever created is `` forced '' and restricts freedom . 
  whether that 's an aceptable loss comes down to opinion of course . 
  anyone that is not familiar with how ** absolutely essential ** encryption is to modern society should [ watch this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpbh1ew28mo ) . 
  do these retards realize that going to github , cloning some open source encrypted messaging protocol and wrapping it with a simple ui is 100 % trivial for anyone with the most basic software dev skills ? 
  there are quite a few million people in the eu that could completely sidestep that law in an afternoon . 
  he was referring to philosophies that are relevant in the real world . 
   the cops look pretty covered up to me . 
  you need glasses then .
