   no woman or man should ever be forced to undress in a public space . 
  period . 
  why are we forced to dress in a public space then ? 
  sure , and taxes are literally state sponsored theft . 
  the libertarians were right all along , why did n't you listen ??!?!?!? 
  armed forces ? 
  those are police officers , they 're civilians doing absolutely nothing more than enforce civilian law . 
   that 's degrading to all humans to the exact same extent as the parking ticket that i got the other day ( read : none ) . 
  literally every single law is unnaceptable then . 
  nice try anarchists . 
   trying to understand the logic of religious people . 
  \\  religious people \\  logic that 's not how it works , that 's not how any of this works . 
  how is this supposed to be horrible exactly ? 
  if she was a naked atheist the police response would be ** exactly ** the same , they would come to her and give the choice between putting more clothes on or be arrested . 
  if a law says you ca n't present yourself in some way in a beach and you do it regardless the police just comes and forces you to correct it , it 's pretty fucking simple . 
  my friendly advice would be to kindly ignore any spaniard wearing the second republic flag . 
  it tends to attract every single angsty regressive lefty in a 10km radius . 
  you 're now banned from r/polska . 
   sounds like an awful idea . 
  still the best one , until society is somewhat convinced any law you could possibly manage to pass simply wo n't stick . 
   who fucking cares hundreds of thousands of poles who are actively denied a normal happy life ? 
   it normalizes homosexuality . 
  yes it does , and on the other side of the coin homosexuals choosing to marry further normalizes marriage and reinforces it as ** the ** structure upon which our families and therefore societies continue to be built . 
  if you deny marriage to a subset of the population you 're making marriage weaker and therefore our current societies more unstable , which is something that conservatives should fundamentally be against . 
   marriage is a very old tradition and * some * conservatives oppose changing it . 
  ftfy we had a similar discussion a decade ago in spain , some of the people that now ended up being part of ciudadanos argued for a middle ground and proposed using a different name as compromise . 
  personally i can see the value in that , but at the same time giving a different name to something that is objectively the same ( from a legal perspective ) is not logical , and many people argued that it would only make it easier to weaken that right in the future since you could make changes to the `` homomony '' without affecting the `` heteromony '' . 
  others took the * muh feelings * route and argued that creating such a construct would only reinforce that the `` homomony '' would somehow be `` inferior to the real thing '' , i did n't agree because arguing semantics is generally pants-on-head retarded , but they had sort of a point , a weak one but one none the less . 
   marry a pizza if you want i do n't care . 
  i warned you about the slippery slope guys ... why did n't you listen ?!?!? 
   most westerners , however , can not squat flat-footed like that . 
  most americans you mean . 
   what did i just watch ?? 
  [ weird music videos seem to be an staple of eesti music . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/3wjb3htd32c ), 
   should it be the state 's decision what they are allowed to wear though ? 
  can they wear swimsuits to class right now ? 
  can they go naked ? 
  if not , you 're already regulating how the students have to present themselves in public . 
  nice . 
  it should also keep vegans out . 
  two birds in one stone . 
  countries with a muslim majority are dangerous for homo/transexual people ? 
  who would have thought ?!?!??!? 
  sick banter . 
  edit : oh wait , people are actually mad about it ... #lmao, 
  sweden pls . 
  what do you mean it is the current year ? 
  look at those ankles ... absolutely haram . 
  yep , i played 2 years of badminton in school . 
   * pasta industry or what ? 
  italy is n't excatly known for having any significant industries * this is what northern europeans actually believe . 
  he should go it on facebook though . 
   he countries with more multicultural policies are canada and australia . 
  canada and australia have cherry-picked pretty much all their inmigrants . 
  that 's a pretty dumb comparison , i too can make an utopian multicultural society where everyone lives in peace if i get to handpick all its members . 
   she was an atheist , but very body-conscious in public . 
  sounds like she needed a psychologist and/or a gym , not a stupid burkini . 
   we too have a clothing culture that we are pretty much forced to follow . 
  for example , imagine walking outside in public completely naked . 
  not only would you be incredibly ashamed but it 's actually illegal and you might get arrested . 
  and that 's perfectly fine , but they 're in france , not in saudi arabia . 
  if walking around naked were the custom in ... let 's say australia , and i decided to live there i would n't walk around in a t-shirt because i know that i would face problems if i did . 
  i did n't say physical harm , i said harm . 
  slander in something that usually causes objective , direct and measurable harm , an immediate threat also causes harm ( as it directly limits your freedom if they have power to act on them ) , someone saying they do n't like you because x or using the words `` polish death camps '' to refer to the polish deaths camps does n't . 
  and `` hate speech '' is absolutely nothing more than the new `` blasphemy '' . 
  ** fact ** : not a single human has ever been harmed as a result of being exposed to an idea . 
  equally stupid . 
  let 's jail people for using words , good idea . 
  that 's not only reasonable and fair , but also economically sound . 
  good , document everything about them and leave way for whatever comes next . 
  are you going to buy ? 
   deception or lies about the claimed performance of a product does n't automatically entitle a purchaser to ancillary compensation . 
  it should , period . 
  a healthy market requires customers that can make informed decisions . 
  lol, 
  do n't you need two gpus for that ? 
  when people say linux they generally refer to gnu/linux , that has figuratively 0 % of the phone / tablet marketshare . 
   yes , but does linux have lobbyists like microsoft , hp and recently google do ? 
  [ yes . 
  you should lock her up in the kitchen so she 's not showing herself in public . 
   we do n't do political modding . 
  greece is a thing that exists . 
  same with spain . 
  what 's supposed to be the difference ? 
  not being allowed to not use clothes is exactly the same thing , the regulations are in place to determine how people have to display themselves in public , period . 
  if you want to hopelessly cling to the `` no clothes is different than particular clothes '' * argument * , then put on some transparent pants and go see how it holds . 
  put some socks on before leaving for the sake of argument , same thing regardless . 
  lmao, 
   how would you feel when your fellow citizens insist no , you really have to be naked if you want to have a quiet day on the beach with your friends and family ? 
  completely fine . 
  in fact , it would be great if that was the socially accepted way to * no-dress * during summer , no more weird tan lines . 
  literally every single country in the world regulates the use of clothes in public spaces . 
  if you want to know more about it , go take a walk naked , do n't forget to take video . 
  it begins . 
   more money means more capital for medical staff traning , tech investments and research . 
  if that was a the key factor americans would be twice as healthy and live significanly longer lives than western europeans , which is certainly not the case . 
  at some point throwing more money at the problem does n't make it any better . 
   imagine where they would be wih an economy like germany or norway !, 
  money does n't make you any more healthy .
