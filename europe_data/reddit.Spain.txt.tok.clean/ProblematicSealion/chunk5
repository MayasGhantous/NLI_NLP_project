  hey its me ur brother, 
   spoken like somebody who has never experienced it . 
  tell us more about how you have experienced murder . 
  better go to / r/ainbow , the mods at / r/lgbt are literally more nazi than hitler . 
   does n't mean i should think those porks deserve to die . 
  no one said that , stop projecting . 
  yes , because you are negatively affecting the vast majority that is simply not interested . 
  i can think of 298364892364923786423 places better than a city street to make a party . 
  i physically cringed . 
  maybe because it 's obnoxious af ? 
  i did n't downvote but i can see why people would do it . 
   where would you even get a claymore [ how many would you want ? 
   * i 'm going to change all my social network avatars this time . 
   for work ... spain * might * not be the best choice then . 
   and queer poc felt uncomfortable with police marching in uniform . 
  they should get their stupid ass back to the house then . 
  how has the lbgtwtfbbq stuff become such a cancer lately ? 
  i 'm just hoping it dies with some dignity left ... 
  to keep the airplanes out . 
  this is why you build a wall . 
  society has n't encouraged mother to be stay-at-home for decades either . 
  also fuck society , people are not babies incapable of making decisions . 
  what is `` fair '' ? 
   walking down the road no one should/can comment on butt . 
  why not ? 
  it 's a public space , it 's perfectly reasonable for anyone can observe and comment on anything as long as you 're not invading anyone 's else space , if you 're not comfortable with being seen in public or someone just friendly ( keyword here ) acknowledging your good looks there are doctors that can help you . 
  if commenting on some dude 's looks were illegal people would end up 20 years in prison every time they go out . 
   one thing where women suffer inequality ? 
  are you serious ? 
  #are you kidding me ? 
   also , gender studies are a perfectly valid research field . 
  lol 'd, 
   they have the same right to be at home if they want . 
  and they do , there are men that stay at home while their partner works , what 's your point exactly ? 
  if you have the means to do so it sounds great to me . 
  ideally , no one would ** have ** to work . 
   it is really different . 
  because today you ca n't comfortably raise a family with a median salary , you need two of them . 
  that 's not really a choice . 
  [ \\  tfw you go online ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibh4g_ua5es ), 
  ethnic terrorism must be profitable export . 
   if they do n't get them out , they 'll get severe burns on their arms from the concrete . 
  sounds great to me , here i 'm hoping that the police / medics took their sweet time . 
  play stupid games , win stupid prizes . 
   ahem , reddit is american site running on operating system invented in finland , and is delivered over content delivery system ( html ) invented in switzerland , etc. 
  also written in a dutch programming language . 
   and if you want more , prepare your wallet ... ? 
  i pay 22 $ for 6gb of 4g data with unlimited calls and unlimited wifi pretty much everywhere in the city . 
  the numbers are literally made up . 
  genius . 
   * we are deeply concerned . 
   naruto i ca n't believe i actually laughed at this ... 
  brutal . 
  oh i 'm a developer too , i know exactly how it works ... 
   as a web dev , i created a lot of similar sites in the past 2-3 months . 
  those are disgusting as well . 
  california . 
  your argument is invalid . 
  my sides are entering the andromeda galaxy right now . 
  indeed , i 'd definitely take the rape . 
  because that 'd be racist , we 're not brown enough . 
  uneventful week indeed . 
   here is my advice to ilga europe : stop leeching public funds to create useless shit . 
  ftfy, 
  having to downvote this shit more than once a year is getting tiresome . 
  especially when knowing that part of my salary is going to this leeches is already physically painful . 
  that should n't be france 's job . 
  it 's the same in spain , people over 14 need to carry identification . 
  if you chop the entire penis off you can last much longer . 
  indefinitely , even . 
   if you consider all religious customs , rituals , etc to be `` wrong '' then sure . 
  probably only the ones that involve children mutilation . 
  you 're gon na die m8 . 
   and society is happy to lock them out bullshit , they have been given more privileges and easy ways to integrate than any other group and they keep spitting on everything that you can possibly do for them over and over and over . 
  in spain at least . 
   ~ ~ i personally do n't get the gypsy hate . ~ ~ * i 've never personally interacted with gypsies . 
  * ftfy, 
  [ triggered ] he does have a point , even if it does n't fit your agenda . 
   it was written sarcastically * i was only pretending to be retarded . 
  *  i 'm sure a lot of people in spain do n't make mininum wage out picking fruit . 
  paying below the minimum wage is illegal , period , those employers are breaking the law and will be punished if caught . 
  i really do n't see how the existence of crime should stop the progressive improvement of laws . 
   for everyone i 'm not sure you understand what `` minimum '' means . 
  ** hint ** : most people do n't earn minimum wage . 
   i do n't trust those numbers . 
  that 's irrelevant , reality does n't care ... for people in their 40s ~ 50s earning a gross of close to 2000 $ / month is not rare at all . 
  it 's buzzwords mate , it does n't have to make sense . 
  this is the shittiest meme i 've ever seen . 
  i 'm almost offended and i 'm not even polish . 
  low energy, 
   if they ca n't deal with criticism most scientists deal with criticism just fine , especially when compared to the general populace . 
  but so far all the alleged * criticism * that i 've seen is absolutely nothing more than worthless rambling since it does not come with empirical , reproducible evidence . 
  scientists are supposed to engage science , stupidity is already engaged by plenty of fools . 
   * buzzfeed * not even once . 
  low energy excuse, 
  the famous heteropatriarcal stem privilege . 
  sounds like it 's time to scrap that shit . 
   every single case of a genre violence case , whether there 's fatality in it or not , gets covered by the media . 
  not every single one actually , the ones where the victim does not have a vagina are completely ignored by the media . 
  to get a decent answer you should start by asking a decent question .
