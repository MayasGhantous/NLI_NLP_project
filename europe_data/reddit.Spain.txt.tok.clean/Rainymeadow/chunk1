yeah , but still , is one of the `` rich '' countries in the eu , we are closer to france than to the east countries ( way more closer ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage i guess the news about our unemployment rate are doing no good to our country . 
   that spanish shipbuilding industry isnt top ntoch that 's why almost half of the world buy spanish warships , they all must be retarded, 
  can you even read ? 
  if yes , try again , the title is enough and you are not supporting the selfdetermination , you are directly supporting the breaking of the constitution ( independence ), 
  do you support the breaking of another eu country 's constitution ? 
  go where ? 
  no one asked you to care the rest of europe will care about ireland , do n't worry about them . 
  but who will care about the uk ? 
  maybe start worrying about that, 
  so the nato refused to protect ceuta and melilla . 
  now ceuta and melilla refuel russian warships . 
  what are they crying about ? 
  nato gave its back to those 2 cities , and now they expect them to help ? 
  in this case , they are . 
  this one is not a tabloid, 
  i just do n't believe in coincidences , not that much, 
   i 'm fine with xenophobia and racism , unpopular opinion i am fine with them wanting to control the immigration . 
  i ca n't be fine with them for hating people regarding to where they were born, 
  i guess that a graffiti in a spanish school calling the kids `` a foreign pack '' right after the brexit vote is a merely coincidence . 
  the same with the graffitis refering to people as `` vermin '' just right after the vote, 
  well , if some brexiters refer to a group of kids as a `` foreign pack '' i will keep posting about it . 
  let 's see if an article from the spanish most read newspaper is removed for `` lacking credible source '' just like the last time . 
  turns out that it was received pretty good with 70 % of the people upvoting it . 
  i ca n't wait to see your answer about this, 
  not even google understands basque , hardest language i 've ever seen . 
  you know where the door is, 
  it is but if you complain against democracy , then it isnt, 
  some people here self-considered `` democrats '' do n't like that the second most voted party is going to let the most voted party rule ( and the only party that improved its results in the second elections ) they already set a date to surround the congress of deputies to complain about the results ( backed by podemos btw ) they are democrats only when the result is the one they wanted, 
  amazing shots london is just too beautiful, 
  just show me some facts find some news about spaniards hitting british for being british please actually if you google `` spain racist attack british '' the only thing you will find is the opposite , news about british being racist with spaniards , which is funny , cause we have more britons here than spaniards in the uk, 
  she is just trying to look tough cause it is everything she has . 
  she knows that she can not win by any way, 
  facts , you included, 
  in that video there are more british defending the spaniards than attacking them the truth is than in england the percentage of bigotry is bigger than in other european countries , but let 's not generalize , they are still a minority ( at least i want to believe so ), 
  that 's how xenophobia works he noticed they were n't english , enough reason to attack, 
  they placed it there in order to revive some hate from our civil war . 
  there is no other reason to place a decapitated statue of a dead dictator . 
  people that lived the civil war and the dictatorship wanted/want to move on and forget those times . 
  it is the young people that did n't live any of them the ones reviving the hate from the past ( and from both sides ), 
  that is a nice excuse the english never lose , keep it up, 
  33 ships vs 41 , i would n't consider it as a rape ** 30.000 soldiers vs 4.000 , 29 ships vs 6 , thats ** [ ** a real rape ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_cartagena_de_indias ) one is famous , the other one is n't . 
  the history is amazing [ bonus track : `` the pride of spain humbled by ad . 
  vernon '' ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:medalla_lezo_y_vernon.jpg ), 
  it would , and the vast majority here wants it . 
  you can give the same show , but without killing the animal . 
  aparently you prefer to keep manipulating you are crying in every thread about how europe hates the uk , well , thats not ur business since you are not european . 
  if you just do n't like it , just deal with it , but do n't tell europeans how they should behave, 
  and the problem is ? 
  last time i checked , this is a subreddit for europe last time i checked , the brexiters voted against the citizens of europe where is the problem in haiting them ? 
  try to not avoid this one please, 
   i have no idea what you 're on about . 
  mec , wrong answer . 
  if you try to avoid whats convenient for you , there is no point of keep answering, 
  i guess that you will be perfectly fine with trump calling you a stealer and rapist , and building a wall to stop you , right ? 
  oh wait , maybe then you will hate trump voters the same way that we hate brexiters ( not the whole uk ), 
  if it happened in europe , can you tell me why he shouldnt post it ? 
  you use fucking everything to say that we hate the uk , when it is not true, 
  and it is her third child did she need a third one that bad ? 
  it 's retarded, 
  so people in brazil , costa rica or puerto rico are happier than in belgium , uk , ireland or luxembourg , hmm i do n't know if i should believe that, 
  then is a estonian thing cause i 've been all around europe , and i 've seen both things, 
  wtf that has nothing to do with the country for me both ways are normal , i do n't freak out when i see the garbage under the sink , usually it 's the first place i look if i the can is not visible, 
  do you speak spanish ? 
  were you looking for a qualified job ? 
  dont expect anyone to hire you if you dont speak spanish , when we have around 5 million inmigrants from south america with spanish as their native language, 
  yep , thats what i meant , im going to edit, 
  this our gov approved the budget for the whole 2016 long time ago other politicans attacked them for doing that , cause in 2016 they could not be ruling but that saved us, 
  http://youtu.be/co6ry6cjsiq ask the muricans , aparently they know more than us, 
  in orange is the new black they divide the groups in blacks , whites and spanish ( not hispanics or latinos ) and they use that term frequently and let 's not talk about the fact that one of the girls does n't want to come to madrid `` cause the enchiladas make her gassy '', 
  dude , the average salary in bulgaria is 379 $ while in portugal is 984 $ and in spain is 1718 $ . 
  obvious you can not place those countries in the same category bulgaria is one of the poorest countries in europe , that is not new for anyone , i dont understand why you got mad i am just complaining cause they used the same term `` so poor '' for bulgaria and for spain . 
  do you really think u can compare both countries ? 
  i do n't try to compare my country with switzerland or norway, 
  i am not talking about the word `` spanish '' . 
  i am talking about the word `` spain '' . 
  not to be able to place in a map the country that named the states of california , arizona , nevada , nuevo mexico , texas , utah , colorado , florida , montana , alabama , tenesse ( basically half of your country ) , means that your educating system is not working well . 
  i mean , if you can place spain in a map , do n't get offended . 
  i am just complaining about the people who ca n't . 
  and i saw in many series how they call `` spanish '' to the people who speak spanish . 
  i was told that you have to say `` spaniard '' if you want the americans to know that you are from spain , not `` spanish '', 
  i know , but half of your cities and states have spanish names cause spaniards name them , there are even states using the spanish flag , like alabama , at least you should be able to see the difference , i am not asking much i mean , its okay that you use `` spanish '' wrongly when you refer to latinamericans , but many people think that spain and spaniards are from southamerica, 
  firstly , you should google some info . 
  the spanish bailing out was n't to the whole country , such as greece , portugal or ireland . 
  it was a bailing out only for the banks so before asking `` did they '' , better ask `` did their banks need bailing out '' . 
  and secondly , according to you , ireland must be `` so poor '' aswell . 
  a crisis or a bailing out does n't mean that you are poor . 
  before the crisis ( that the us provoked ) our housing market grew up in one year , more than uk , germany and france , combined . 
  meaning that the crisis hit us harder . 
  and still after the crisis , despite the high unemployment , we are still there compiting with the top countries ( this year we surpassed italy in gdp per capita ) , growing up 3 % every year , with one of the best healthcare systems of the world and one of the best infrastructures in europe with the 2nd biggest road network in europe i do n't know , that does n't look to me like a poor country , more like a country that is not in its best moment, 
  now the telegraph , before the independent i ca n't wait to see what comes next . 
  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2014/09/10/13/tax.jpg let 's pretend that the median does n't exist . 
  i do n't know how the rest of the world was able to live without england . 
  according to the english people , you are paying everything to everyone . 
  actually if someone in the world is hispanic , thats us :d but they use that term incorrectly , they should change it for latinamerican , or something like that . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage if spain or portugal are `` poor '' , i ca n't imagine what the east countries are . 
  your ignorance makes you associate `` spanish '' and `` portuguese '' with poverty . 
  at least you learnt something new today . 
  do n't give up and keep learning new things . 
  spanish and portuguese = mexicans and brazilians for the average american, 
  for the muricans we are `` so poor '' like ukraine or bulgaria that explains a lot,
