  an agreement with the perfidious albion ? 
  never , we do n't negotiate with pirates get your ships ready, 
  / r/portugal prepare your anus, 
  tbf , some people segregate themselves from the rest, 
  i guess the fact that they think they are the center of the world and superior to everyone else has nothing to do with that hate to the arrogance , not anglophobia, 
  average russian, 
  anglophobia lol you really think that you are that much important, 
  an anti-immigration politician , emigrating to the country with the biggest immigrant population in the world . 
  makes sense, 
  one in christmass and the other one usually in summer ( by agreement with the employeer ) the current minimal wage is 650 $ per month , 756 $ per month in 12 payments . 
  which is extremely low considering that the average salary is 3 times the minimum salary ( 2100 $ ), 
  just to clarify , in spain you receive 14 payments per year instead of 12 . 
  950 $ per month + 2 * 950 = 13.300 $ yearly, 
  oh there we go , glad to see that my comment bothered you . 
  thanks for playing, 
  canadian talking http://www.mediacoop.ca/sites/mediacoop.ca/files2/mc/seal_slaughter_pic_welcome_to_canada.jpg http://www.thesealsofnam.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/canadian-seal-hunt-12.jpg the vast majority of you back this medieval thing ? 
  huh ? 
  cause i do n't think so , so i wo n't insult all canadians . 
  pp ! = spain, 
  before calling stupid to 47 million people you should at least show your flag , dont you think, 
  i see people blaming 47 million people ( spain ) , for something that the vast majority of us is against and the bull is not `` set on fire '' , still cruel and medieval , but the title is missleading, 
  keep trying to look less fooled by your politicians . 
  wait a second , did n't you leave the eu cause things were going terribly bad in your country ? 
  if the economy is better than ever , why did you leave then ? 
  it 's like podemos in spain . 
  before the elections they used to see kids starving in every corner .

  slightly above the spanish average , and mostly because of barcelona . 
  those mentioned are the top 3 , far from catalonia, 
  the top 3 are madrid , basque country and navarre, 
   i would like to vote for pro-european party but with tough anti-immigration policy from third countries . 
  these parties are non-existent i hope this existed . 
  we have enough people in europe already , thanks to schengen you can get engineers , doctors , construction workers , etc from other countries , you do n't really need to import them from outside the eu . 
  and if at some point some countries need more workers , you have other european countries such as ukraine or russia to offer them working visas . 
  countries with a similar culture and history that would mean no impact whatsoever on our societies . 
  if you like comedy i think the most watched show at the moment is [ la que se avecina ] ( http://www.mitele.es/series-online/la-que-se-avecina/0000000003580/ ) . 
  i personally do n't like it but most of people do , so you could give it a try . 
  it 's a copycat of another serie called [ aqu\u00ed no hay quien viva ( 2003 ) ] ( http://www.atresplayer.com/television/series/aqui-no-hay-quien-viva/ ) . 
  this one is a bit old so you will struggle to find episodes in decent quality . 
  if you do n't mind the year nor the quality , [ los serrano ( 2003 ) ] ( http://www.mitele.es/series-online/los-serrano/0000000000188/ ) was a masterpiece ( ok , maybe i am exaggerating , but it was good enough ) [ los hombres de paco \\ ( 2005 \\ ) ] ( http://www.antena3.com/series/los-hombres-de-paco/ ) was a serie i personally liked a lot , it was a mix of comedy , drama , action , crime and even some mystery . 
  talking about mystery , i also liked [ el internado \\ ( 2007 \\ ) ] ( http://www.antena3.com/series/el-internado/ ) back then . 
  now , if you want top notch series , the best ones at the moment are : [ el ministerio del tiempo ] ( http://www.rtve.es/television/ministerio-del-tiempo/ ) , a serie about time travelling ( something like doctor who ) . 
  [ isabel ] ( http://www.rtve.es/television/isabel-la-catolica/ ) , a serie about the life of isabel la cat\u00f3lica and fernando de arag\u00f3n . 
  if you want to find good series by your own i would recommend you to use [ filmaffinity ] ( https://www.filmaffinity.com/es/main.html ) . 
  it 's like a spanish imdb where the people is extremely critical ( sometimes too much ) . 
  i would say that any serie with a rating of 6-6 .5 + is worth watching . 
  if you have any question feel free to ask and i will gladly help you . 
  just look at the conflict that a small rock ( gibraltar ) created after brexit . 
  many british ~ ~ newspapers ~ ~ tabloids were calling for war already lol, 
  some people here say eypos , but mostly isolated cases, 
   but it sounds ( to me ) more latin than iberian , which i was not expecting , perhaps because the only person i 've discussed this with was another spaniard who said he thought they sounded more iberian ... 
  between all the different spanish accents the guinean is the one that sounds more iberian maybe [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htory__z6yq ) you will be able to see it better . 
   could you elaborate on the speaking better part ? 
  do you think this applies to any of the nationalities in hispano\u00e1merica as well ? 
  i 've heard some suggest that colombians have a particular reverence for correct usage of the castilian tongue . 
  south americans tend to use what for us is a richer vocabulary and lexicon . 
  and the guinean accent for me it sounds extremely similar to castillian spanish , and they also use a richer voabulary just like in sa , that 's why i said they speak better than us . 
   y la \u00faltima preguntilla - has estado en guinea ? 
  nope, 
  why not :d i find it funny and cool at the same time , but hard to understand sometimes, 
  [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vkymojlr7i ), 
  mexican accent meh , i do n't like it nor i hate it . 
  i like the colombian accent ( especially the paisa one , the one of narcos ) , also the one from bolivia and ecuador . 
  the ones i do n't like are the accents from argentina , puerto rico , cuba , paraguay and uruguay . 
  ( no offense to anyone ) also the spanish spoken in equatorial guinea is like another level , they speak better than us . 
  why would you want to enter a war-zone willingly ? 
  i have netflix , hbo , and amazon prime video , and netflix is by far the best , but still a lot to improve . 
  i hate the fact that in many series they do n't provide english subtitles . 
  for those i still use torrent . 
  it 's probably the last place in the world i would choose for travelling . 
  no offense if you are from there , but i think the reasons are pretty obvious . 
  i do n't know why normal spanish words are seen as offensive or racist for some . 
  negro = black mulato = half black/mixed nothing offensive, 
  with english and spanish you will learn french really fast . 
  and german ... [ well ] ( http://www.aaanything.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/life_is_too_short_to_learn_german_by_richard_porson.jpg ), 
  you do n't realize what you have until you lose it . 
  we got that much used to each other that we do n't care anymore , but the love is still there . 
  if you are talking about universal languages only for europe , obviously those are german and french in that order . 
  in general , the most spoken european languages are english and spanish far from the rest . 
   but does every region in europe even want to become its own state ? 
  who would n't want its own state ? 
  you would still live in the same country ( a federalised europe ) and you would have the benefits of having a small country ( see the nordics as an example ) . 
  also , literally every rich region would want its own state so they would n't have to give money to the poorer . 
   nothing would stop asturias or upper silesia from also becoming its own states , if they wished so . 
  all this `` let 's the people decide everything '' sounds pretty cool , but it does n't work . 
  also what are the limits to classify a group of people as a `` region with self-determination '' ? 
  regions ? 
  provinces ? 
  islands ? 
  most of the regions we know today were artificially created many years ago , the same than most of the countries we know today were artificially created not that many years ago . 
  a god did n't come to the earth and created those regions so they could have self-determination whenever they wanted . 
  just for the record , i am from the basque country . 
   regions like scotland , the basque country , flanders , catalonia and the rest should be allowed to form their own states within the union . 
  just curious , what makes those regions different than , let 's say , asturias or upper silesia ? 
  if every region in europe could form a new state , we would have easily 200 states in europe , which would be obviously retarded and not efficient . 
  as for me , i would make a cultural division in big countries such as italy or spain . 
  let 's say north and south , or something like that .
