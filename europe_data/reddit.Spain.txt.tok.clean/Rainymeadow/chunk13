  if you are from the states , there will be transatlantic low cost flights from barcelona soon , so you can always come in a couple of years for a low price . 
  ( we are talking about 250-300 $ both ways ), 
  have you thought about the language ? 
  because you have romance countries where you will be fluent in the language in a few months . 
  what about those ? 
  are you aware of how hard danish is ? 
  or german ? 
  and also you have portugal, 
  from spanish people ? 
  cause i 've never heard anyone here referring to barcelona as bar\u00e7a when talking about the city also i googled it , just to be sure cause you made me doubt , and everyone says the same . 
  barna is the official abreviation to the city , and bar\u00e7a is just used for the football team, 
  i do n't know if you are serious , but just in case , that 's the team , not the city !, 
  because the guy has 2 balls bigger than his head, 
   that 's true , but ilegal . 
  if you fall into that scam just call the police ... are you sure about this ? 
  i 've seen menus with the iva not included many times , and even in really good restaurants , not the typical touristic ones i guess it is illegal if you do n't mention that the iva is not included . 
   my grandma ( an atheist too , go figure ) used to say `` see you tomorrow , if god wants to '' ( hasta manana , si dios quiere ) when kissing us goodnight , which creeped me out beyond imaginable . 
  i think all the grandmas do that . 
  when you are a kid you are like `` pls god do n't fucking kill me i want to make it to tomorrow '', 
  in some restaurants the price is shown without vat , check if it says `` iva no inclu\u00eddo '' . 
  about the tips , forget about it unless the service is good . 
  about the quantity , it is up to you , but i think 1-2 $ is more than enough . 
  5 $ is the maximum i have given . 
  your question is a bit retarded . 
  every country in the eu know that the eu is in fact a good thing for their quality of life and economy . 
  ** there are some countries that dislike the way the eu is getting ruled ** , but that does n't make them dislike the eu , but the current politicians . 
  if your country is ruled by the party you do n't like , would you say that you do n't like your country ? 
  please stop , i am starting to feel bad for him, 
  my company is english , so therefore i work with mostly english and german people , and i have to say i 'm really impressed about how well they speak spanish . 
  the english people that come here and do n't try to learn the language/integrate are those pensioners that go to the south . 
  but the normal english people that come here to make a life in the sunny spain , integrate just well , like any other european . 
  also you ca n't blame the pensioners , you ca n't expect them to learn a language when they are 70 + . 
   these places are shitholes for black and brown people . 
  we only have 5 million of south americans because spain is a shithole for them . 
  only on mexico 's tv shows, 
   i 'd like to name her mar\u00eda marcela luc\u00eda . 
  and you are dutch ? 
  it would be something like ** mar\u00eda marcela luc\u00eda van der wissel fern\u00e1ndez ** are you sure about it ? 
  a common european name such as sofia , maria , mario , etc. 
  a name used in the whole europe ( not only in spain ) and easy to pronounce . 
  for sure not a name like mine ( basque one ) that people struggle to pronounce . 
  ( even tho i like it ), 
  that 's not what cambridge , oxford or merriam webster dictionaries say . 
  and i do n't want to be rude but , why are you telling me what my homeland is ? 
  it feels like foreigners feel with the right to tell us ( and catalans ) what we are and what we should do . 
  to think we are a country is delusional . 
  we are an autonomous community of spain and an historical nation . 
  some people do n't like it and try to change that , that 's it and we respect everyone 's opinions , but even the independentists know what we are . 
  just because the word `` country '' is used in other languages , that does n't make us a country . 
  the original name is euskal-herria , not basque country . 
  also you find everywhere that scotland is a country , but you ca n't find anywhere that the basque country is a country . 
  the basque country ( / \u02c8b\u00e6sk / , / \u02c8b\u0251\u02d0sk / ; basque : euskadi [ eus\u033akadi ] ; spanish : pa\u00eds vasco [ pa\u02c8is \u02c8\u03b2asko ] ; french : pays basque ) is an autonomous community of northern spain . 
  scotland ( / \u02c8sk\u0252t.l\u0259nd / ; scots : [ \u02c8sk\u0254t.l\u0259nd ] ; scottish gaelic : alba [ \u02c8al\u032a\u02e0ap\u0259 ] ( listen ) ) is a country that is part of the united kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of great britain . 
  we are a historical nation , and we were part of the kingdom of navarre , that 's all . 
  the same applies to catalonia and the kingdom of aragon, 
  i am from the basque country and everybody here ( save a few nationalistics ) know that the basque country is not a country but a historical nation . 
  our name is confused cause it is badly translated from euskal-herria , where herria does n't mean country , but somehow it was translated that way kingdom of navarre , that was a country . 
  just like the kingdom of aragon and castille, 
   but like them , there are parts of germany and italy that were independent for a long time what parts of spain have been independent for a long time ? 
  i am curious, 
   catalan thing , not spanish that 's like saying `` that 's a thing in moscow , not in russia though '', 
   my jaw dropped at seeing a 1l water bottle for 25 euro cents . 
  that 's amazing ; how are you guys doing that ?!, 
  that 's because we recycle fecal waters and bottle it . 
  i hope you enjoyed your trip ( im joking , you can stop vomiting ), 
  i am 183 , and i do n't consider myself tall when there are teenagers around me ( those bastards are easily 180 + at the age of 16 ) but i am above the average and i am usually taller than most of people ( save youngsters ), 
  oregon would be like living in / r/earthporn, 
  nothing like eating chorizo after siesta while washing your flamenco dress pd : i have it in the bathroom, 
  https://8values.github.io/results.html?e=58.5&amp;d=56.9&amp;g=53.8&amp;s=62.8 this test seems to work , i would say it is pretty accurate . 
  not even 50 % of the people in bilbao speak euskera which is sad , but it 's the reality . 
  the situation is different if you compare it with other spanish historical regions , like catalonia . 
  in the big cities most of people do n't speak it , you see almost everything in spanish , etc. 
  there are schools for adults to learn euskera , so people keep trying to learn it . 
  the thing is euskera is an extremely hard language , and if you do n't learn it as a child , it 's rather impossible to learn it as an adult . 
  also there are schools for kids , the so called ikastolas , where almost everything is taught in euskera . 
  the problem is , that it is well known that the most radical basques send their kids there , so the normal people try to avoid them . 
  i do n't know , i think it is the city that best represents europe as a whole . 
  for its history , its facades , its streets , etc. 
  plus it is an economic powerhouse , well located , and it is the capital of france , one of the pilars of europe . 
  i would make paris the capital of europe, 
  i love the catalan accent , although many people hate it for how they pronounce the l. 
  the big macs are very big macs and much big macs . 
  it 's very difficult todo esto . 
  yes , for this [ one ] ( http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y271/neutravo/imperio.jpg ) its the first flag we had and we changed it for the current one because in the sea it was hard to distinguish from the english one ( what a shame ) i think it looks cooler and it represents way more than the current one , since it is the flag we had during the spanish empire and during the spanish golden age if the iberian union is a reality in the future , i would take [ this ] ( http://orig15.deviantart.net/8749/f/2014/057/5/7/flag_of_the_union_of_iberia_by_lyniv-d76zpl3.jpg ) as a flag without thinking twice . 
  yes , especially f1 and motogp ( these recent years we are dominating the last one ) also , this year , everybody in spain is suddenly a super fan of the indy500, 
  catholicism in spain is another stereotype . 
  if we were that much catholic we would n't always be on the top of europe talking about same-sex acceptance , gender equality , civil rights , abortion , etc, 
  why should n't we be tolerant ? 
   but merkel for example had to explain to him how he ca n't just make a deal with germany , he has to make a deal with the eu at large and he did n't seem to get it . 
  he just does n't read his notes apparently . 
  she had to explain that to him 11 times http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/angela-merkel-donald-trump-explain-eu-trade-11-times-germany-chancellor-us-president-a7699591.html, 
  right , they do n't understand that we ca n't learn how to dance flamenco if we are sleeping the whole day, 
  to experience something similar to the northern europe cuisine ( im joking guys , i am acting like a real spaniard , the truth is i eat mostly hamburgers ), 
   where do you put it then ? 
  in the garbage, 
  about the languages , the order of difficulty from easier to harder would be : norwegian  swedish  danish use duolingo and check , you will find out that norwegian is easier than swedish , and way way easier than danish . 
  about the cost of living , from cheaper to more expensive would be : sweden  denmark  norway but i would say the rent prices in copenhagen are way more expensive than in oslo/stockholm, 
  well , catalan is a language and not a dialect , but it is my choice , i like how it sounds , it is my favourite by far [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zptpx1kejay ), 
  yes , i am worried . 
  i do n't care from where the immigrants come , but they should integrate to the country they are going , and not the other way around .
