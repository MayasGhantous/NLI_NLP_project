  mercadona  all i hope you guys will have it soon in europe carrefour would be the second i think . 
   trend micro , a cybersecurity firm , said last month that a hacking group , believed to be part of a russian intelligence unit , was targeting macron and his campaign team , adding that it appeared to be the same fancy bear group behind the hacking of democratic campaign officials before last year 's us presidential election . 
  i think russia has crossed the red line thankfully macron will be the next french president , and the eu army will be closer than never . 
  to close our borders and to create the eu army is all we need to stop this alt-right bullshit . 
  you are a the_donald poster , and a le pen supporter , with a 24 days old account . 
   i have been called racist terms , my girlfriend has been as well no you have n't  and i saw the most horrendous domestic abuse etc.etc . 
  in eastern europe . 
  no you did n't i 've been living in poland for 1 year , and i 've never seen anything like that . 
  but you saw the `` most horrendous domestic abuse '' in your holidays , k.  what is it about eastern europe that seems to lack the politeness and courtesy that is more prominent in western europe ? 
  no , they do n't lack politeness or courtesy . 
  it is not at the same level than , for example , in the nordics , but while i was there i was treated perfectly fine , and people was always keen to help me . 
  just like anywhere in europe . 
  in fact , i live in a very touristic area here in spain , and i 've never seen lack of politeness and courtesy from people from europe ( russia included ) or asia . 
  i ca n't say the same about people from the usa tho since you are a trump supporter , maybe you went there with your aura of `` glorious murican '' , and you just got to a country that got destroyed by foreigners a few years ago and nowadays have no time for more disrespectful foreigners and their `` feeling superior '' bullshit . 
  we would have the [ coolest flag on earth ] ( http://orig15.deviantart.net/8749/f/2014/057/5/7/flag_of_the_union_of_iberia_by_lyniv-d76zpl3.jpg ) think about it, 
  since when southern galicia is called `` portugal '' ? 
  i would appreciate if you stopped spreading fake maps . 
  sorry i do n't know what you mean by saying `` portugal '' , i do n't speak greek, 
  from our neighbors : ** france : ** no chance ** andorra : ** we would destroy that tax haven ** uk : ** no chance , they have already conquered our beaches , we have the enemy at home ** morocco : ** ez pz and that 's it , i think i am not forgetting anyone . 
  the wars and colonialism were made by the ancestors of the current south americans , not the ancestors of the current spaniards . 
  many of them fail to understand this , so it leads to retarded discussions, 
  around 7-8 %, 
   but the ones that are still not doing well are finland , italy , spain , portugal , greece . 
  spain has the same gdp now than before the crisis http://www.elmundo.es/economia/macroeconomia/2017/04/28/590250eee5fdea37558b463d.html the unemployment is our main problem right now . 
  after the crisis we had around 27 % and now 18 % , so we are improving . 
  the government expect to have 11,2 % for 2020, 
  inditex by far specially zara and pull & bear, 
  from the comments section : `` the polish squadrons shot down more germans than any other squadron during the battle and won . 
  in the end , britain and the u.s. 
  betrayed them to russia . '' is this true ? 
  lol, 
  i like the people that feel proud of their country and want to protect it . 
  i do n't like the people that feel superior than other people just because where they were born . 
  and this applies to all , from big countries to small regions . 
  nationalism is the same for all . 
  in my personal case , i have no pride for what the moors did here , like the alhambra . 
  i feel proud about the legacy of the spanish empire , our so-called gold century . 
  last time i felt so it was when visiting the royal palace in madrid, 
  all those players that you are mentioning do n't make it to the starting xi , meaning that the spanish national team would still be superior . 
  if this was 2010 and xavi was in form , i would agree with you . 
   without being called all sorts of names by the spanish people who feel offended by his political views . 
  inform yourself before making such statements . 
  pique said many times that he is not an independentist , [ also he feels spanish ] ( http://www.mundodeportivo.com/seleccion-espanola/20161010/41899845005/pique-en-febrero-yo-soy-espanol.html ) , so why people would get offended by his political views ? 
  if he receives insults from the fans , it is because he likes to create unneeded controversy towards real madrid , so obviously those real madrid fans insult him . 
  he is a good player inside the field , but extremely toxic outside of it . 
  that 's the only reason . 
   or should i take your flag as an answer ? 
  to use my nationality as a counter argument is not nice at all . 
  especially you , being polish , should know that no one should make assumptions about a person regarding the country where he was born . 
  ** wales ** ( listeni / \u02c8we\u026alz / ; welsh : cymru [ \u02c8k\u0259m.r\u0268 ] ( listen ) ) is a country that is part of the united kingdom and the island of great britain . 
  ** catalonia ** ( catalan : catalunya , occitan : catalonha , spanish : catalu\u00f1a ) [ a ] [ b ] is an autonomous community of spain , located on the northeastern extremity of the iberian peninsula . 
  the uk is an union of countries . 
  spain is a country with historial nations such as the basque country or catalonia . 
  and who says that the legal status does n't matter ? 
  wales joined england back in the days , but they never stopped being a country . 
  actually it was called `` england and wales '' and not only england . 
  probably when they invented the international football in great britain , they made a national team for each country located there . 
   some mexican friend told me that the world is united by their dislike of argentinians . 
  i fixed it, 
  not really . 
  it would be only busquets , piqu\u00e9 and jordi alba . 
  because wales is a country and catalonia , flanders or wallonia are n't, 
  here automatic cars are for people that are already bored of driving . 
  they do n't sell automatic cars because people do n't want them , not because they are more expensive . 
  the cost of an automatic transmission is around 1000 $ , so if you are paying 20.000 $ for a car , 1000 $ is an irrelevant amount . 
  i do n't have good experiences with mexicans , so i ca n't agree . 
  but i would prefer southamericans over middle easterners any day . 
  the witcher 3 is not just the best european game , it is the best game in the recent history . 
  and the polish cd projekt is probably the most loved company right now in the industry of videogames . 
  i never pre-order games , but i will do so with cyberpunk 2077 , and i am sure that it will be worth every cent . 
  germany is a country , denmark is a country , scotland is a country that it is part of an union of countries called the uk that does n't have a constitution . 
  catalonia is not a country and has never been . 
   you , the person who says to literally only listen to one of the two groups even if they were the tiniest of minorities '' are telling the person who says `` both groups should be heard '' that * he does n't care about one of the groups ? 
  that 's rich . 
  spain should listen to both groups , meanwhile in catalonia the so-called `` bad catalans '' ( those who feel spanish ) are suffering the continious xepnohobic attacks from the independentists ? 
  who is listening to them now in catalonia ? 
  literally no one . 
  if you only knew the xenophobic scum you are defending ... make a test . 
  go around catalonia with a spanish flag , then go around the rest of spain with the catalan independentist flag . 
  you will realise that maybe you are defending the wrong ones . 
   `` the secretary-general of the un agrees that catalonia should remain part of spain '' he said literally that catalonia does n't have the right of self-determination, 
  to be honest i have no idea , but i live in a very touristic area , and it is impossible to make a normal life while the tourists in the next door are having a party at night . 
  yeah , airbnb is so cheap , useful and all that , but it is not a hotel , you are going to a normal block of flats with more people living around you , and that people are not on their holidays , they actually have to work , wake up early , they have kids that need to sleep , etc, 
   yes , of course , wanting catalonia to have a referendum makes me hate all of those damn unionists . 
  / / / s you are obviously manipulating and you are not interested in a debate whatsoever . 
  i was going to answer to all your sentences , but i wo n't waste any more of my time . 
  edit :  i 'm not catalan . 
  i know , you are from one of the 2 regions that spoil spain . 
  at least some catalans have reasons to complain . 
  your case is just anti-spanish xenophobia . 
  it is quite visible in all your comments . 
  have a good day, 
  about that matter , the entire world is on our side and backs our position , but yeah , we are all wrong , go and tell them . 
  you can start with the last secretary-general of the united nations , ban ki-moon, 
   single spanish nationalist who says `` but their not even the 50 % guyzz , why give them a vote in a democracy !! 11 !! '', 
  i never said something like that . 
  even if the polls said that 90 % of the people is against the independence , still an indyref would n't happen . 
  the sovereignty of a country is not up to vote . 
   honestly , i was expecting something better , it 's sad that that 's the best reason you could come up with . 
  you do n't care about the no-independentists catalans , nothing new .
