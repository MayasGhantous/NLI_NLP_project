  it may be sad for you , but it is still the reason why you are not getting a referendum . 
  feel free to cross the border towards france whenever you want . 
  but watchout , they are stricter than spain about catalonia . 
   hmm ... maybe if there was a way to know which side has more support ... 
  i do n't know , something like a piece of paper where catalans would write their opinion , you could count those papers later and according to the results let them do what the majority of catalans want !, 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/64j41i/independent_scotland_would_be_most_welcome_to_be/dg44dff/ you really have to renew your repertory . 
  why would you ask me in the first place if you had your answer already prepared ? 
  this is the reason why i refuse to debate with people with biased mindset, 
  the main one : half of the catalan people feel both catalan and spanish . 
  you can not go and tell them `` you see , you were born in spain , just like your parents and grandparents . 
  i am sorry if you feel spanish , but you are not that anymore . 
  now you live in a new country , whether you like it or no '' some catalan people want to have their own identity ? 
  fine for me , just like they are doing now . 
  they should protect their language and their traditions . 
  some catalan people want to secede 3.5 million people from their country ? 
  wo n't happen, 
  our constitution does n't allow an autonomous community to secede from spain for many reasons that i would explain to you if your opinion was n't totally biased according to your other comments . 
  anyway it is not hard to understand . 
  it is hard only if you do n't want to . 
  [ los serrano ] ( https://imagizer.prod.carbyne.ps.ooyala.com/1800x635/https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ingest-mediaset-production.carbyne.ps.ooyala.com/o2nc5y74bsbb_masthead-losserrano.jpg ) if i am not mistaken it is known in europe , please confirm ? 
  at least someone once told me that in finland it was pretty famous . 
  also it has the best ending in the history of the series . 
  our connection with scotland is the same that with the irish : the historical common hate towards england, 
  what triggers me is that aparently one gibraltarian smokes 4.700 packs of cigarettes per year . 
  somehow also there is this other little thing . 
  there are 3 times more companies than people . 
   why do you care ? 
  or are you afraid you wo n't be able to keep milking them if they go ? 
  here we go , at this point i realised that it is retarded to talk to you since your opinion is totally biased . 
  catalonia contributes 3 times less than madrid , is the region of spain with the highest debt , a debt that only spain buys , cause it has the same rating that bangladesh 's . 
  actually , even the balearic islands contribute way more than catalonia if you keep in mind that the industry in spain is located mostly in madrid and barcelona , you can see that no one is milking catalonia , actually it is the opposite , they are contributing way less than they should . 
  https://gyazo.com/568f00a9a5f03b6202b28e066a40a051 they ask spain for money literally every 2 years ( but i guess you do n't know those things ) , and you still have the balls to talk about milking ? 
  well , you just do n't understand anything , so i will try to explain to you , even knowing that you do n't give a fuck about facts since you will not change your biased opinion , but luckily someone else will understand the problem here and wo n't talk from the ignorance just like you are doing . 
  but see , the people from scotland , are scottish , and not english . 
  the people from catalonia are catalans , and ( according to the last poll ) the majority consider themselves as spanish . 
  let 's say that scotland and catalonia get their independence together . 
  from one day to another , the scottish people wo n't be part of the uk anymore ( there is not even a term for people from the uk , since british is the people from britain , not uk as a country ) . 
  but they will be always scottish , no one will ever change that . 
  from one day to another , half of catalonia will stop being spanish . 
  people who is catalan and feel spanish , will lose what they are . 
  one day they are living in their country , and another day they are suddenly in a new one . 
  that ca n't happen with scotland , cause the scottish people will live in a country called scotland , without regarding if they are part of the uk or not . 
  are you able to understand now the difference between actually being a country , and an historical region ? 
  if catalonia was a country , no one would care if they got an independence or not , since 100 % of the catalan people would be catalan and not spanish at all . 
  i ( and all the spanish people ) could n't care less about what the independentists do in their life . 
  they could just leave the country if they want , no one is stopping them . 
  but do n't be mistaken , we will fight for that spanish and catalan people that want to remain in our ( their ) country . 
   i do n't have to do that in order to tell you that catalunyans have their own language and history and all the requirements to be called a nation thus have the right to self determination . 
  what do you mean by history ? 
  even the smallest region in the world has its own history . 
  that does n't make you a nation and for sure that does n't give you the right to self determination , as the united nations already stated . 
  and it is `` catalonia '' and `` catalans '' . 
  your efforts trying to say it in catalan when talking in english , tell me that your opinion is widely biased . 
  plus it is a bit awkward aswell as i said , if your argument is that catalonia is a nation , please provide the nations that compose spain in order to take you seriously . 
  i am not asking for much , just to show us that you really know what you are talking about . 
  btw , inform yourself before talking , you need to meet some criteria to have the right of self determination backed by the international law . 
  http://arengel.edublogs.org/2013/10/12/catalonia-and-the-right-of-self-determination/ and to back my argument , here you have a source of ** ban ki-moon , secretary-general of the un ** , saying that ** catalonia it is not one of the countries with the right to self-determination ** http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2015/10/30/actualidad/1446231111_709046.html when you talk about breaking a country , i expect you to talk far from the ignorance in order to take you seriously . 
  then spain is a country of nations right ? 
  everyone can name the nations that compose the uk . 
  can you name then what nations compose spain ? 
  i 'll be waiting, 
  if the vast majority of the parliament wants to change it , they can do so without a referendum . 
  but keep downvoting the things that you do n't like even when they are true , that 's so mature, 
  but for that you would need the approval of the majority of the country . 
  so it seems kinda impossible , at least in the next 20 years . 
   of nations exactly , such as scotland, 
  no national constitution in europe allows the secession of an autonomous region , so i do n't think that 's possible at all . 
  scotland is the only one possible , but it is not a regional autonomy but a country, 
  no idea what you are talking about, 
  the 2 meninas on the right side of the infanta were dwarves . 
  people with disabilities were often used as buffoons . 
  economically better than i expected . 
  socially meh, 
  yeah , he is from argentina so i guess he has about less than 10 % of native american heritage and 90 % european he fails to understand that the ones who colonised the native americans were his own acenstors , not mine that never left spain . 
  you hate a country for what it did 500 years ago ? 
  the problem is only yours , not ours . 
  you can keep crying and shitposting about spain all you want . 
  here no one cares about that stupid hate that some southamericans have for spain , since we all know is their way to feel better about themselves . 
  to blame other people is always easier than to assume your own mistakes . 
  you are hating other people for your own problems , exactly the same behaviour that those racist bigots that insulted you have towards immigrants . 
  if you hate other people irrationally , you should n't cry when other people do the same to you . 
  spain may have many problems , but it is one of the most open-minded countries in europe talking about immigration and homosexuality acceptance specially . 
  in my entire life , i 've never heard anyone calling `` sudaca '' to another person in his face . 
  if you had a bad experience here i am sorry for you , but it is not normal . 
  if southamericans were treated badly in spain , we would n't be full of them . 
  edit : you seem to have an irrational hate towards spain https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/634vuq/comment/dfrdvsd that explains a lot, 
  i watch it and enjoy it , but i do n't take it seriously the singers are worse every year , but the shows and the special effects make it a bit better , so i guess it is still watchable if they only sent the best singers of every country 's got talent ... 
  europeans are the most open-minded people in the whole world . 
  i do n't know where u are from or what ur cultural background is , but you will have fewer problems in europe ( if any ) than anywhere else . 
  i am curious now about what ur cultural background can be to be afraid of coming to europe, 
  in our case , we had some rough times during the 2nd spanish republic . 
  some fanatics are going to deny it , but the truth is ( and i am not blaming the 2nd republic whatsoever ) that this country was a total mess back in that time . 
  the population was totally divided and the hate towards other people for thinking different was extremely high and rising . 
  the justice was non-existent , and due to all that , some people started killing each other for thinking different , and sometimes they did n't even need a good reason ( my grandgrandfather got killed for going to work during a strike ) . 
  most of the time those murderers were n't punished . 
  then , following those killings , the mess , and the hate , the army tried to take the control claiming that they had to fix the country , and the republicans defended themselves claiming that they were the democratic elected government . 
  all this ended up in a civil war . 
  the fascist side won , and that 's pretty much the reason . 
  since the population was very divided we ca n't really say that we turned fascist . 
  if the republicans had won , we would had turned communist instead .
