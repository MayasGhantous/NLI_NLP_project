  the fact that you call valencia `` pais valencia '' tells me a lot about you , since no one used that term untill 2-3 years ago . 
  meaning that : a ) you have no idea what you are talking about b ) you are a catalan fakeflaggin, 
  this one is pretty good `` i want to give independence to everybody without respecting the sovereignty of a country , but hey , only in other countries , not in mine '' not the first time i see it here , playing the '' '' '' `` cool democrat '' '' '' '' role but with other countries ofc, 
  the little mermaid of copenhagen is overrated as f ** k the city is beautiful tho, 
  a lot of rain in autum/winter midly hot in summer, 
  i know many cubans living here , and trust me , it is good that he is dead every time they go to cuba for holidays , they take basic things from here , such as medicines , cause they ca n't buy/afford them there . 
  a friend of mine , his mom is a nurse and she is earning 20 $ per month . 
  everybody wants to leave that island , and i do n't blame them, 
  of those 4 cities , san sebastian is the most beautiful by far . 
  if i had to choose a city in spain to move in , it 'd be san sebastian for sure also it is the most expensive, 
  i support almost everything sarkozy is saying these days . 
  unluckily they are only empty pre-election words . 
   are gypsies well integrated in spain ? 
  no , they are not . 
  they live in their ghettos , giving 0 fucks about laws and the police the foreign gypsies like romanians are way more integrated, 
  i highly doubt it, 
  what exactly did you check on rm website ? 
  the match is in the camp nou , so you can not buy the tickets on the rm website , you have to go to bar\u00e7a website anyway , they are expensive cause right now they are selling only the vip tickets . 
  the regular tickets will be on sale 4 weeks before the match ( which is the 3rd not the 4th ) . 
  so i would recommend you to burn the f5 the nov 3rd do n't worry about the money , i guess you would be able to get a ticket for 100-200 $ , the problem is that they are hard to get cause the members have priority , and when they come on sale for the regular people , there are only a few left, 
  cause i have been there and there are only a few , while here there are bakeries in every corner , literally, 
  perfect place for a quick death https://www.google.es/maps/@37.3586914,-5.9625523,3a,75y,57.47h,74.94t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s1839ohbgs71u1hpvzsvmog!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=es, 
  paris and edinburgh i would say , if you want to feel what the old continent looked like, 
  are you going to teach me that `` baguette '' is a french word ? 
  do you think that when i say `` in other countries '' i mean every country in the world except spain ? 
  bakeries are something common in spain , france , portugal , italy , etc. 
  the same with the olive oil . 
  but not in the rest of europe i wo n't ask you if you are 12 , i will ask you a more proper question : are you retarded ? 
  can you even understand what you are reading ? 
  have you ever left your french village ? 
  florida should be us , they even have our flag [ flag of florida ] ( http://cdn.history.com/sites/2/2013/11/florida-state-flag-p.jpeg ) [ spanish empire flag ] ( http://www.viajesyfotografia.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/img_0361.1024w.jpg ) and the oldest city in the us , st augustine , florida , celebrated their 450th anniversary like [ this ] ( https://farm1.staticflickr.com/728/21249963106_657083da4e_o.jpg ), 
  extra virgin olive oil i know , it is not unknown , and some people actually use it , but here is extremely normal to use olive oil ( we do n't use anything else ) . 
  for us , butter or sunflower oil is like destroying the food . 
  i almost died when i saw people frying eggs with butter . 
  also the bread ( baguettes ) here every morning a member of the family goes to the bakery to buy a freshly baked bread . 
  and this happens everyday and in every family . 
  i know in other countries that 's uncommon , actually is hard to find a bakery in the streets . 
  i do n't like paella im sorry, 
  i want to kill with my own hands the creator of airbnb , i hope that answers your question, 
  no with spanish-speakers . 
  we do n't watch their movies/series . 
  not usually , we make exceptions with the very good ones , like narcos , but that 's not common . 
  the spanish that they speak there is so much different than the one spoken here , so it 's hard to watch the same things , since we usually refuse to watch something that is in `` latino '' , and i guess they refuse our spanish too . 
  only the music is connected , but i guess that the latinamerican music is famous all around the world , so it 's not a `` spanish '' thing . 
  that said , all that is changing now with youtube , the vast majority of the viewers of spanish youtubers , are from latinamerica . 
  but i do n't know if it works the same in the other way ( i do n't think so ) about news , not usually . 
  the media usually give us the important news happening in latinamerica . 
  i guess we have more news from there than from other countries . 
  we watch their tutorials around the web , that 's something that i ca n't thank them enough . 
  if there is a country that hates spain , that 's mexico, 
  ramos sucked as rb he became good when mourinho moved him to the center, 
  i am just asking , because in spain we see companys as what he was , a killer . 
  so maybe he was talking about andorra or france , i do n't know, 
  [ blas de lezo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blas_de_lezo ) you probably do n't know about him , i know the english tried to delete him from the history , but he won against the whole royal navy with only a few men ( some were n't even soldiers ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_cartagena_de_indias he is the reason why in south america people still speak spanish and the reason why in south america there are still native indians , or mixed native indians . 
  when the royal navy left england to america , they created coins celebrating the win , even before the battle . 
  they had to throw them all . 
  in which country ? 
  the same one that killed a rival only cause he stole his lover ? 
  the same one that created the called `` checas '' , zones used to torture and kill people ? 
  the same one that took part in the assasination of 8.000-9 .000 people ? 
  is that your hero ? 
  between 0-1 homicides per 100.000 people the same levels than germany , denmark or sweden do n't listen to that guy , he already said that he came to spain 2 or 3 times and he was assaulted at gunpoint many times ( lol ) , he is just saying bullshit , i guess he has an irrational hate against spain . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate just check the map , spain is one of the safest countries in europe . 
  you were stolen at gunpoint in madrid ? 
  hahaha holy shit , what an amount of bullshit me , or any of my friends/family was never assaulted , and any of them ever even saw a gun , and u have been assaulted with a gun a number of times ? 
  now srsly , what 's the point of lying ? 
  do u have an irrational hate against spain ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_best-selling_books i guess those like the bible and quran do n't count, 
  pretty good actually , my girlfriend is polish , we speak in english , our future kids will have to suffer with the languages tho . 
  cervantes , author of the best-selling book in the history ( 300 million of copies ahead from the second ), 
  i live in the center of madrid and i do n't have mercadonas around . 
  only `` small '' supermarkets . 
  lack of space i guess, 
  i almost had a heart attack when i saw a person frying eggs with butter . 
  and aparantely it is very common out there . 
  i ate peanut butter only once in my life , here is even hard to find . 
  i do buy jam , since i usually eat toasts for breakfast . 
  i do n't buy prepared meals , a pizza maybe ( i do n't know if that counts ) , but nothing else from that , we do n't have many options to choose tho . 
  common breakfast items , i usually take a cup of milk/coffe with a toast and strawberry jam . 
  i do n't buy cereals , but i used to , i bought the normal ones , i do n't know . 
  not with colors like the froot loops that you eat there . 
  just normal corn flakes . 
  beverages only water and coke zero . 
  sometimes a zero-calorie monster , but not usually . 
  condiments , if you mean sauces , i only eat sweet chilli sometimes , but again , i struggle to find it . 
  mayonnaise is common here , but i try to avoid it ( 700kcal per 100g , you know ) i never bought made pasta , i always make it from scratch . 
  is this what you asked for ? 
  or you wanted me to be more specific , like brands or so ? 
  you can ask anyway . 
  it is in a way . 
  if 40 % of the people is that much fanatic to go to church every week , the politicians will try to have those votes . 
  meaning that they will do whatever it takes to gain those votes , so in some way , the church is still ruling . 
  not directly tho, 
  we maintain religious buildings cause they are part of our history , we were n't born in 1492 it has nothing to do with religion, 
  hmm , well https://i.redd.it/ok6e25zf1rox.png, 
  [ in\u00e9s arrimadas ] ( http://e03-elmundo.uecdn.es/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2015/09/16/14424239050201.jpg ) guess why, 
  no , any of them will happen . 
  scotland is already a country that is a member of an union of countries ( uk ) , you can not compare that case with the others, 
  ehhh ... no i am not confused . 
  https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/img/question8_large.jpg hispanic is separated from white and as you can see , lebanese and egyptian are considered white and everybody knows that the population in the us is divided by whites , hispanics and black ( the 3 most important ones ) that 's what bothers me .
