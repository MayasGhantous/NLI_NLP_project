  they do n't appear to agree with brits after voting 97 % for the remain . 
  if they do n't want to be spanish , it 's fair and okay , but they would have to migrate to the uk to have a proper life . 
  as i said , you can not live in gibraltar if you have to ask for a visa in order to cross the spanish border . 
  ban flights to spain ? 
  remove santander 's license ? 
  extend gibraltar waters ? 
  how old are you ? 
  i know i may get many downvotes from angry brits , but let 's be honest , after brexit , gibraltar will not belong to the uk . 
  it is impossible for them to live in gibraltar if they have to cross a border every single day ( and let 's not talk about visas ) edit : the downvotes are here already , i guess it 's silly to expect arguments instead . 
  amazing , specially the first one , i watched many videos of zakopane , but never one like that , thank you . 
  yeah , i did n't have time to visit the slovakian part of the tatra mountains . 
  but i will for sure, 
  i edited with better quality pictures ( not mine ), 
  you made me miss my trip to zakopane for those who do n't know zakopane , i 'll leave some pics here ( the following pictures are not mine ) https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3760/19304423259_243dd00d2b_b.jpg https://farm1.staticflickr.com/256/18882007954_6d497434a6_b.jpg https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3688/18896919834_a857064d48_b.jpg https://farm1.staticflickr.com/440/19286782938_a4bcde20f4_b.jpg https://farm1.staticflickr.com/328/19468217292_4deedb2bb7_b.jpg https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3725/18935236764_baf2508e06_b.jpg https://farm1.staticflickr.com/534/19315853038_b0a7164f13_b.jpg, 
  some examples , like a norwegian , living in norway , and having all the surgeries in spain . 
  another one , more recent , talking about how all this stopped ( proving that it is not an invention ) http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2012-04-19/se-acabo-el-turismo-sanitario-para-700-000-extranjeros-y-con-1-000-millones-de-coste_232957/ here you have something else in english http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/expat-health/4198294/dont-take-the-spanish-authorities-for-a-ride.html he said : `` these people are essentially health tourists . 
  there is a huge cost to spain because they have not been contributing to our health system . '', 
  there are even webpages that offer these kind of servicies , just look for it on google with the date until 2007-2009, 
  it is very known here that time ago we had many english coming here only to enjoy our free healthcare . 
  they were coming only for an expensive surgery and then they were leaving . 
  in england some of these surgeries were 8.000 $ , and in spain were 100 % free . 
  all this stopped in 2007 after many years of leeching our healthcare system ( not only by the english , but mostly them , cause in england those kind of treatments were way expensive compared with other countries ), 
   he 's already the people 's politician in the nations eyes , he lead us out of the eu against the wishes of the establishment , now he 'll pioneer voting reform against the wishes of the establishment . 
  just read again he could be talking about jesus, 
  italian waters , that 's cute https://i.sli.mg/3dmhg2.png go into the sea in a wooden raft , that 's all they have to do in order to get rescued for our friends of the ngos . 
  there is an illegal transportation of people happening just under our noses , and everything seems to be allright . 
  no one ca n't even complain, 
  holy shit the brainwashing is real, 
  try googling `` medical tourism '' , you will be surprised about what your fellow citizens used to do here not much time ago . 
  stop calling that thing `` paella '' , thank you, 
  dude , germans already own mallorca , do n't give them gibraltar too, 
  all of the important ones here received funds from soros , i hope that answers your question . 
  i understand that if nigel farage managed to trick you , you can not be so smart , but you should know atleast that if the pound is that low , it is normal that the exports increase . 
  but that is not something positive , you are just selling cheaper , but it is enough to make up the brexit disaster , so your brain can remain washed a bit more . 
  these news always coming from the same source , interesting, 
   the top export destinations of the united kingdom are the united states ( $ 51b ) , germany ( $ 46.5 b ) , the netherlands ( $ 34.2 b ) , switzerland ( $ 33.6 b ) and france ( $ 27b ) . 
  the top import origins are germany ( $ 100b ) , china ( $ 62.7 b ) , the netherlands ( $ 50.7 b ) , the united states ( $ 44.4 b ) and france ( $ 41.5 b ) . 
  [ exports ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xiinb58.png ) asia : 107b oceania : 6.89 b africa : 15.9 b south america : 7.11 b north america : 62.9 b ** total non-eu exports : 199.8 b ** ** europe : 273b ** keep cutting off the nose to spite the face and do n't forget to believe everything that you read on the telegraph and everything that nigel farage tells you . 
  wtf, 
  valencian country xd aparently we have a new country every week . 
  thank god that ai n't gon na happen . 
  if the eu is bad or not does n't matter . 
  what matters is that 67 % of them voted to stay in the eu i am sure that the main reason for the scottish people to vote to stay in the uk was that an independent scotland would be out of the eu, 
  spaniards can not participate , they hate us because we stole their gold :(, 
   they can just go independent without the governments permission no , they can not . 
  it is the second point of our constitution the constitution is based on the indissoluble unity of the spanish nation , the common and indivisible homeland of all spaniards ; it recognises and guarantees the right to selfgovernment of the nationalities and regions of which it is composed and the solidarity among them all . 
  and a sovereign country must protect their territory and their citizens . 
  yeah , `` mediterraneans '' , blame the people . 
  no , i am spanish , not like the op that is argentinian  just do n't be like those american ignorants that call `` spanish '' to everyone who speak spanish , that 's retarded and more important than that , disrespectful . 
  are you an american ? 
  tell that to the people of your country . 
  to remember our brothers from indonesia, 
  i literally do n't know any young person who sleeps siestas . 
  i am from the north tho , i do n't know how is it in the south since there is way hotter . 
  they already made one in 2014 . 
  useless ofc , since it was ilegal . 
  one gipsy woman taking a nap , that 's how they represent spain ? 
  that 's disrespectful as fuck, 
  well , countries with a language spoken all over the world as spain and france usually do n't like it so much when they are being forced to learn a language just because it is spoken in the usa . 
  and they like it even less if you have in mind that in the english-speaking countries they do n't even try to learn any other language . 
  bonjour i hope you etes tres bien moi friend, 
  then you are crying all over / r/europe because we `` hate '' uk , and you are the only ones toxics here . 
  yeah , the bigger the better ( not in the dirty way , you know what i mean ) but there are many differences between the european countries , so i do n't think is going to happen any soon . 
  it seems like the only way to stop the us and russia doing what they want in europe . 
  how ? 
  if every state forget about its youngsters . 
  the indians living in south and northamerica did n't speak any latin language before when we got there , so i do n't know how they could be called latinos . 
  they are ( were ) the same race, 
   north america and southamericans , how were they called ? 
  it will be funny to see them asking for a visa every time they want to leave that rock 96 % voted remain for a reason . 
  does anyone actually believe that ? 
  it 's funny cause we have 761,000 britons living in spain [ ( source ) ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/in_depth/brits_abroad/html/ ) and i have never met a briton here who spoke spanish , or what is even worse , i have never met a briton here who tried to speak spanish . 
  [ most brits in spain say no gracias to integration ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/29/europe-news ) and then you get attacked if you do n't speak english . 
  but you dont have to respond for other people , only for yourself . 
  no one is going to see you and think : `` wow , he is spanish , for sure he likes flamenco '' liking something does n't make you more or less spanish . 
  those things are not liked by most of spaniards . 
  ( i do n't know anyone who likes flamenco or bullfighting ) he is just ashamed of the stereotypes about spain, 
  i am extremely quiet , almost anti-social . 
  i do n't drink , i do n't like parties , i do n't like flamenco ( no one in spain likes fucking flamenco ) , the same about bullfighting , etc and i feel spanish , cause i am spanish , i am glad that i was born here in a such a nice country , with its good and bad things , just like every country in the world . 
  your problem is that you are giving credit to all those retarded stereotypes about spain . 
  you are probably from the north , and you feel ashamed because spain is mainly known abroad for the south and the mediterranean culture ( which is normal , all the tourists go there ) . 
  but what people think wrongly about your country should not affect you . 
  finally the goverment forced the high school to readmit the girl . 
  for those wondering . 
  http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2016/09/19/valencia/1474289825_103412.html ( in spanish ), 
  and do they speak english as good as the danes ? 
  no , there are rules for a reason . 
  according to your thinking , it would be acceptable to wear this hat at school , right ? 
  [ 1 ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/4d/22/da/4d22daf289f13912936028f31b5596bd.jpg ) it 's not covering the face , just like the hijab . 
  it 's rude to wear caps or cover your head inside . 
  who the fuck is talking about religions ? 
  i do n't give a fuck about what religion that person professes , covering your head inside it 's disrespectful here and no one does it . 
  covering your head is not allowed in any school . 
  no caps , beanies or hoodies . 
  mainly because it 's disrespectful , so usually people do n't try to do it in the first place . 
  in an ideal world , i would like them to stay with us in a different eu ( this one needs huge changes ) i love the uk , and i love the british culture , but it makes me sad to see the hate that some of them have against us , the rest of europeans . 
  the brexit for me is more than just an economical matter , it 's about history , it 's about giving the back to your european neighbours , it 's about creating hate withing europe . 
  no to brexit , and no to this eu, 
  lol i do n't think so , i know it . 
  they used the suffering and desperation of the people and promised them impossible things in order to gain power .
