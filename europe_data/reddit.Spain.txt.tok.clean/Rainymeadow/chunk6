  in the other hand , in spain you can grow up more than in poland i know people in spain earning easily 3k , 4k , 5k $ per month , that in poland is almost impossible . 
  i know people in spain that can not find a job as engineer for example , in poland you can find a job way more easily . 
  i have been living in both countries . 
  http://www.accuweather.com/en/es/seville/306733/july-weather/306733 dont go to seville then, 
  you can consider yourself lucky http://www.accuweather.com/en/es/madrid/308526/july-weather/308526, 
  same percentages than france or uk , and 20 % of unemployment . 
  feel free to do the math, 
  which is funny cause i have been in poland and there were many polish guys darker than some arabs . 
  they support it only to take advantage ( money ) of the independists fools , as you can see [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c5jl8wiskg ), 
  schengen helps , the fact that we can go to work to any eu country helps a lot . 
  anyway lot of people work and dont declare it . 
  which at some point is normal , who likes to pay high taxes to a corruption gov ? 
  the real unemployment rate is not 20 % . 
  but the explanation to all this is pretty easy , [ we have the same levels of immigration than uk , germany or sweden ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_europe#statistic_data_on_immigrant_populations ) , the difference is that they do n't have 20 % of unemployment rate and they can handle the immigrants , but we ca n't . 
  i know a guy who wants to vote ` leave ' . 
  he is a great guy , except for the fact that he eats kids and kittens . 
  yes lol , i thought it was obvious :d, 
  because it 's the only thing i am allowed to say in europe, 
  if i said my opinion about this i would get banned , so i will just say the only thing i am allowed to : i am sorry world for being european, 
  the pic has been taken from the top of the palace of culture , right ? 
  yeah , poor them lol, 
  mostly south americans , and spaniards that join them . 
  the british made a full replacement , there were anyone left to complain . 
  our national day is 12th of october , when columbus arrived to america . 
  if you post on facebook/twitter/instagram something to celebrate our national day , you will get insulted , even called murderer , because they thought it was an extermination , so there should n't be nothing to celebrate . 
  true story, 
  damn , m\u00e9xico is like 4 times spain, 
  yeah indeed , it 's not a coincidence that in north america there are n't native americans left , unlike in sa , and we are criticized , but not them , i have never known why . 
  ** but anyway , it 's just that , history , you have to be a fool to criticize a country for its past . 
  it 's starting, 
  ** $ 93.6 billion : ** - 234 hospitals - 19.500 primary schools - 62.400 nursery schools - 117.200 cultural centers - 187.200 sport centers ** and the most important , the are 12 million people below poverty in germany , with that money , you could give them a basic income of 650 $ per month during a year . 
  ** i guess some germans prefer to help refugees than their own people . 
  yep , and margaret was so good too , i thought she was going to win, 
  i love the polski one, 
  [ here ] ( http://en.uefa.com/uefaeuro/ticketing/#availability ) ? 
  oh come on sweden , give some love back to your neighbors, 
  yeah , i am sorry , but i am scared . 
  in the whole madrid region ( 6.5 million people ) we had 31 murders in the whole 2015 year . 
  in paris they had 130 murders in 1 night . 
  we are not in the europe from 100 years ago , we are in the europe of today , and our priority now should be to stop the terrorism and bring back the safety from which europe is admired in the whole world . 
  i am, 
  ** your version : ** refugees in germany : 1.500.000 suspects : 12 ** real version : ** refugees in germany : 250,299 suspects : `` dozens '' ( more than 24 ), 
  lets become the 51th state then . 
  no , i prefer to do everything that the usa says , just like now . 
  how do you think we can have a power in the world if we split up ? 
  do you think a 50-60 million country can have presence against the usa or china ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  what a surprise , not a single european would 've imagined that . 
  i am in shock, 
  the location would be spain , that 's for sure :d, 
  they will pay for the 100 % of the project , including metro stations , new lines , parks , bike roads , etc. 
  the far-right wing movement started in europe way before trump actually if i am not mistaken , it started with marine le pen, 
  uff , not bad at all . 
  glad to see that they dont think we are mexico, 
  you can learn 3 languages easily if the whole europe has a common easy language , the newborns will become natives of the new language and they will learn english at school just like now , so anyway that does n't change much . 
  it should start by the end of the year if nothing happens . 
  but you know , with our politicians you never know, 
  i think i do n't follow you . 
  almost all of the $ 6.000 m come from the bbva bank , a private bank . 
  during the constuction of the whole project , the city of madrid will earn $ 3.340 m from taxes . 
  so spain will earn money , not lose it . 
  its all made with private money if i am not mistaken , so it will cost 0 $ to the taxpayers . 
  80 % of it will be public spaces and green zones , new metro stations and lines , 120.000 new jobs for the construction of it , plus the jobs that the new offices will create . 
  and all with external money . 
  it will be something similar to the separation between westmister and city of london ( in a smaller scale ofc ) . 
  it will have all the commercial zone grouped in only one district just like in london , which i guess in a long long term will help external companies to invest in madrid , because now the commercial zone is far from the centre of the city and separated , usually in the suburbs . 
  edit : wait , do you mean [ this one ? 
  ] ( http://stadiumdb.com/constructions/esp/estadio_la_peineta ) its $ 240m but its the atletico de madrid stadium . 
  the new santiago bernabeu is about $ 400m they are just adding `` layers '' to build it as fast as possible [ explained here ] ( https://youtu.be/ci--x4ccj2c?t=133 ), 
  no idea , but it will have a hotel and a shopping centre inside too [ 1 ] ( http://www.realmadridnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/infographic-santiago-bernabeu-new-stadium.jpg ) its a big club , i guess they can afford it and they can find a good sponsor to pay for that stadium . 
  is a retractable roof , [ here ] ( http://www.l35.com/img/img_prj/aerea%20nocturna%20sin%20cercha%2001.jpg ), 
  thats not unemployment lol, 
  maybe to much wine :d no but srsly , no idea at all, 
  tell that to all the people who downvoted me , aparently they know more about the spanish teachers that a spanish himself :d, 
  as you can see , the people who did this were n't so smart . 
  they used to take loans thinking that they were going to earn that much their entire life . 
  not only for bmws , the same for houses . 
  and as other one said before , 2k euro was the minimum , some of them could get 4k and 5k easily, 
  and what about the english and the scottish :(, 
  high school and primary teachers are usually a joke , basically cause they work for the goverment so they can not get fired . 
  so when a kid is a troublemaker they dont give a fuck about him . 
  not all ofc , but many of them . 
  i am not saying that you are hating , dont worry . 
  yeah , you know , when you are young is so easy to get attracted by easy money . 
  it was normal to see 18-20 guys with a brand new bmw . 
  imagine if you are 19 , you are studying to get your degree , and you see your friends making 2k $ that easy and that fast . 
  and ofc the unemployment in the counstruction was 0 , if you wanted to earn 2k $ per month , you could do it , without experience nor studies . 
  anyway , i am from the north of spain , so i tell my point of view , as you can see [ here ] ( https://lauronda.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/mapa.jpg ) the difference is quite big ( 12-20 in my region ) , maybe one spaniard from the south can explain it better, 
  bad education ? 
  our engineers are ones of the best in europe , with the doctors and nurses . 
  41 % of the people aged between 25-34 went to the university in spain ( more than finland , austria , germany , italy , etc ) the problem is that with the spanish property bubble , you could earn easily 2.5 k - 3k $ in the counstruction without studies , so a lot of people left their studies to work and now they dont have anything . 
  those people should be around 30 years old now , so yeah . 
  anyway , i dont know anyone ( when i say anyone i mean it ) without at least secondary school , so i dont know if you should trust that pic . 
  so much hate in those islands :(, 
   just those we decide we do n't like and do n't want here which ones for example ? 
  being honest , i wont get offended if you say spain , dont worry . 
  because i dont know if you include european countries or not . 
  that 's pretty obv . 
  if you vote for the brexit and close your borders with the european countries , you will be basically saying ` gtfo filthy europeans we dont want you here ' . 
  and if you close your borders to the rest of european people , you will struggle to go abroad within the eu in the same way that we wo n't be able to go into the uk .
