  i do n't know , in my opinion the best for all is to stick together . 
  every country has immigration problems , and we all know that those problems are not related with the european population with our culture ( or quite similar ) . 
  but ofc , is your country , so its up to you . 
  pd : at least thats what i think he means . 
  yeah , cause they know that they can not get in , so whats the point of trying ? 
  100montaditos is the most known here , almost doubling the number of mcdonalds restaurants . 
  australia is an island and they have the borders pretty closed . 
  border noun 1a line separating two countries , administrative divisions , or other areas . 
  great point , keep the borders open , so more of them can come in and the ones that we already have wo n't feel alone and will be more integrated . 
  and portugal is richer than argentina lol, 
  it seems that scotland is not a country anymore according to argentinians , someone 's got ta tell the scottish the breaking news . 
  but no worries scottish friends , according to argetinians we are a plurinational state , so we can adopt you if you want , 
  come on , do it , our gates are open :d, 
  nah , it was a joke . 
  i do n't have anything against the usa , 
  and why is that ? 
  your minimum salary is one of the highest ( if not the highest ) of europe . 
  your average salary is not at the same level of your neighbours , but it will increase at the same time the unemployment dreceases . 
  remember that you are still growing up ( and extremely fast i must say ) and here we are talking about the future , not the present . 
  plus you have a small country , which means that it 's easier to rule , so i wouldnt be surprised if you get the level of the scandinavian countries in some years . 
  at least its how i see it from the outside . 
  microsoft , google , dell , amazon , apple , facebook , etc , all of them in ireland , i dont think thats a coincidence . 
  the low tax policy for companies seems to work pretty well . 
  you are one of the best countries when talking about hdi ( better than the usa , canada or sweden ) and you are still growing up like no one in the eu . 
  only the `` weak '' economies in europe grow up that fast , as you can see on the map , because its easier for them , and then there you have ireland , rich as fuck at the moment and growing up even more than those countries . 
  the spanish woman should go to the dentist rofl, 
  indeed we are so popular to them , majorca is a german colony now :d, 
  portugal , join us to make the iberia country , people is asking for it from all over the world . 
  finally . 
  i cant wear a cap or a beanie and they can go fully covered by that thing, 
  because of its politics , basically . 
  i really think that ireland is the country with the most promising future in europe . 
  do n't mind me , i just want to start a fight between baguettes and pierogis, 
  do you mean fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric fran\u00e7ois chopin the famous french composer ? 
   for the one than vote no , then , if they want , they can leave catalonia people who feel spanish and catalan : sorry guys you have to leave now , this is not your home anymore people who dislike spain : keep fighting guys , do n't ever think about leaving spain , better break its constitution and territory lol the borders are open , everyone can enter just like everyone can leave . 
  the territory will remaing spanish forever tho, 
  how is that a bad thing ? 
  take a glance at norway or sweden, 
   just because your country is very bad xd no , you did n't, 
  read the map again it says $ / km2 , therefore it shows basically the population . 
  the map is 100 % the same than this [ population map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/eu_nuts_2_population_density_2007.svg/1280px-eu_nuts_2_population_density_2007.svg.png ) i guess the worse country in this map is england , since it is overcrowded af stop showing the world your stupidity, 
  it is $ / km2 , so basically it shows the population . 
  it is basically this [ map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/eu_nuts_2_population_density_2007.svg/1280px-eu_nuts_2_population_density_2007.svg.png ) the op is a brexiter that wanted to show us the red color of england and i guess he did n't even notice that it was $ / km2, 
  i do n't really see where is the interesting part of this map, 
  i know but people usually do n't know that beans , peas or rice are seeds . 
  do you know what a seed is ? 
  cause you are probably eating them in your english breakfast every morning , for example, 
   `` the lights would go out in our biggest manufacturing sector , food will rot in the fields and britain will lose the ability to produce and process its own food . 
  ** that is not what a successful brexit looks like . 
  ** '' did they really think that brexit would be successful in any way ? 
  spain has the same levels of immigration than than the usa or germany actually it is higher than the uk or france https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_immigrant_population, 
  it is decreasing extremely fast . 
  i remember in 2000 you could see people smoking literally everywhere , now all that changed the ads about the risks of smoking/drinking do n't work at all , only restrictions and high taxes . 
  looks like someone got mad and proved my point , thanks and yeah , i have to give you that , france is still important . 
  england in the other hand , some of you still think you live in the glorious british empire , and actually you are living in a colony of your former colony , the usa . 
  actually you got surpassed by all of your colonies , sad, 
  [ nope ] ( http://assets.bubblear.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/17155727/eu.jpg ), 
  i meant that i did n't mean to , even if it sounded like that . 
  for sure do n't do it in poland, 
   i do n't think the british are arrogant at all i was n't generalising , i meant that the amount of arrogants it is higher than in other countries . 
  but here in spain that amount is the same , if not higher , than in britain . 
  i guess it happens in countries that were important in the past , just like england , france or spain . 
  some people seem to think that we are still as much important as we were when we had our glorious empires . 
  they think we spend our lives on reddit looking for good news about the glorious britain so we can downvote them they really have a problem with that arrogance, 
  and what exactly do you want to discuss if what you said to support your argument was a lie ? 
   no wonder the post is being downvoted anything that i said was a lie , the downvotes come from people that just do not like the truth , 
  ok , firstly : terrorism noun the unlawful use of violence and intimidation , especially against civilians , in the pursuit of political aims last time i checked this post , the independentists were trying to intimidate the general prosecutor of barcelona . 
  intimidation , just what the catalan government did with the high school director that didnt want to open her high school to allow an ilegal vote [ ( source ) ] ( http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/cataluna/2017-02-07/juicio-consulta-9n-institutos-abrir-artur-mas-rigau-ortega_1327783/?utm_campaign=botonerawebapp&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social ) i could show you videos of teachers brainwashing kids in catalonia , independentists claiming that colon , da vinci , and cervantes were catalans [ ( source ) ] ( http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2014/11/24/catalunya/1416826845_827782.html ) , and many more shits that only a brainwashed person would believe , but since you are brainwashed , i wo n't waste more of my time debating with you . 
  and do you know why i know that you are brainwashed and trying to push an agenda ? 
   the basques still want independence , at least according to the polls and elected parties , but fortunately they are not seeking terrorism as a mean to obtain it . 
  poll by the basque government : only 19 % wants the independence http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2016/03/11/actualidad/1457698284_566725.html obviously you hate spain , it is ok , u are free to do so , but i wanted to make clear some points so you do n't get to trick the people of / r/europe with your lies . 
  have a good night , do n't bother answering , i value my time so much to answer a brainwashed person . 
  you see , intimidation do n't work with us . 
  we already faced independentism terrorism in the past , both basque and catalan , and it did n't work , it wo n't work today and btw , you can read the news again if you wish . 
  as you can imagine , we wo n't leave the future of our country to this brainwashed people . 
  you can always look at the basques , they do n't want the independence anymore , and they have more reasons to be an independent country than catalonia . 
  you may be wondering why , well , because they do n't let anyone brainwash them, 
  and this , european friends , is the real face of our independentists pure fascism, 
  there is no such thing as having a life but if you prefer to waste yours by working like a slave to increase your country 's gdp per capita , who am i to tell you the opposite, 
  the average salary before taxes in slovenia is 1509 $ , while in spain is 2200 $, 
  brexit voters * please, 
  if you want to talk about a country 's salaries , take a glance at the average wage , and not at the minimum ** in slovenia the minimum wage is almost the same than us , and their average salary is 250 $ higher than the minimum one . 
  ** ** in spain the average salary is 1718 $ , 1000 $ higher than the minimum one , meaning that in slovenia the percentage of people earning the minimum wage is way higher than in spain , where is something rare ** we are closer to france or the uk than to slovenia talking about wages that said , our minimum wage is extremely low becuase of the crisis that caused a high unemployment . 
  thankfully the government already accepted a raise to 1000 $ for 2020 if i am not mistaken, 
  yeah , i agree , but people compare the french elections with the brexit vote , and they are quite different i mean , if le pen is elected , it does n't mean that france will leave the eu automatically, 
  le pen already said that she will try to fix the eu from the inside , and if that does n't work then she will call for a referendum . 
  if that happens , i do n't think french people will vote leave and before that , i guess there will be changes in the eu regarding immigration , mainly to stop these right-wing populists, 
  spain 's debt : 99.8 % france : 96.20 % usa : 105 % belgium : 105.8 % are they broke ? 
  those countries have way better economy than the eastern ones , specially spain and italy , maybe stop looking that much towards the south, 
   also , what the fuck is this ? 
  franco is in charge in spain again ? 
  who closes borders in 2017 , come on are you serious ? 
  they closed the border from the inside , how is that our fault ? 
  now they will have to deal with it, 
   trying to enact that would be stupid , just as the current spanish line is utter stupidity . 
  that concrete area should n't belong to the uk , i fail to see the stupidity in claiming that, 
  it is not about buying back , but about returning to spain what belongs to us anyway at this point we know that it wont happen , but it is undestandable the spanish government 's position about this matter ( at least for me ), 
   spain argues that gibraltar airport is illegally located on spanish land . 
  it says the 1713 treaty of utrecht , which ceded the town , castle and port of gibraltar to britain , did not include the rights to the isthmus on which the airport is built . 
  i think this is the key to understand it,
