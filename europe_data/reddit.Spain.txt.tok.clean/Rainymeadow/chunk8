  i just love the way you cry more and more with every comment, 
  do you mean something like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dsg9aco.gif ) ? 
  [ indeed ] ( https://farm1.staticflickr.com/728/21249963106_657083da4e_o.jpg ), 
  look at the other pictures that people posted , then come back to this one . 
  obviously these 2 shoehorned this town between the rest to push something . 
  we are in europe and we use the glorious dd/mm/yyyy date format ( except for a few traitors ), 
  i do n't get why waving your country 's flag = provoking russia, 
  yeah exactly , but as i said , the term `` latino '' is not the same in spanish than in english in english it mostly refers to people from latinamerica , since the north americans were the ones who adopted that term into the english language . 
  in spanish it means what you said . 
  just same word , different meanings depending on the language . 
  that 's why many spaniards are confused about the term . 
  in an english conversation you are not latino , while in a spanish one you can perfectly be if you feel latino, 
  the spanish meaning of latino is not the same than the english one . 
  in spanish latino refers to those countries who speak a romance language , but in english it refers to people from latinamerica . 
  and why spain included ? 
  why not italy , romania , france , portugal . . 
  latino refers to people from latinamerica . 
  even here in spain we use it , for example `` bandas latinas '' . 
  https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/latino when saying `` latino '' no one means the countries with a romance language . 
  no one would call a french or a canadian latino, 
  some call amarna miller `` latina '' , and she is whiter than the average white american i guess they do it for the views, 
  the 83 jihadists that we stopped from attacking the last year i guess they were preparing themselves to attack the glorious center of the world , britain, 
  the unemployment looks bad because of certain areas . 
  in madrid for example there are zones with 4 % , and the average in the region is 9-10 % . 
  it is not hard to find a job the british mostly come to the south of spain to retire , but many of them come to work to other areas aswell attracted by the country and not by the economy . 
  the same with scandinavians , danes and swedes live in countries that look perfect from here , and still there are many of them than come to work to spain ( in ikea you only see swedes , the same with tiger , mostly danes for example ) what i mean with that is that the economy is not everything . 
  many people is happier in spain than in their countries , and all they want is to earn enough to live here . 
  in spain the immigration is at the same level that countries like germany or the uk , and people usually forget that , cause to the eu nationals , you have to add the people from south america and morocco . 
  i always welcome the people that want to live in my country , but at the same time it makes harder for us to reduce our unemployment . 
  we basically have the same immigration than germany , and our economy is far from being at the same level than the german one, 
  i am not surprised how do you think people can survive in areas with 40 % of unemployment ? 
  the shadow economy makes our unemployment looks worse than it really is , i guess it is the same for greece sadly i do n't expect a change any time soon, 
  actually there is an update the op edited the original map , but he only edited 1 country , poland original : https://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/iq-europe.jpg the polish xenophobia looks like a good reason to ban someone , at least for me, 
  you know that in the majority of european countries the university costs less than 1000 $ per year do n't you ? 
  and in many of them it is free ( or almost ) http://elpais.com/m/elpais/2014/06/20/media/1403284776_956685.html, 
  we have europe in our hands and we did n't notice make the spanish empire great again , this time using lettuces, 
  to break the spanish constitution is not up to anyone but the spanish people, 
  eggs , potatoes , olive oil and salt the onion is optional, 
  ** advisory : the following videos may be disturbing for some people ** here the crime : https://twitter.com/buzzfeedtastyy/status/827224436331917313 and aparently is not the first time : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgb_p25b6fc&amp;t=1s the americans did n't have enough with [ italy ] ( http://nedik.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/receta-pizza-hawaiana.jpg ) , like seriously [ poor italy ] ( https://umasueca.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/2587889215_3e7a33ba75.jpg ) , and now we are their next target . 
  ** we need the eu army now more than ever **, 
  i would like to add that 1,4 million of israelis have spanish and portuguese roots , for those who do n't know https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sephardi_jews the used to speak a language ( judezmo or ladino ) that looked like a normal spanish but written by a troll [ example ] ( http://e.canaln.americadigital.pe/ima/0/0/1/4/7/147648/764x480.jpg ), 
  here is otan aswell, 
  too late hopefully now they will think before doing certain things good luck competing with the american farmers and their chemicals, 
  what is your problem ? 
  are n't u able to read properly ? 
   officers from lancashire police made the arrest after receiving a tip-off about dorobek 's impending arrival . 
  so you basically do n't give a shit , do you ? 
  as long as it does n't happen to you , everything is fine, 
  you do n't seem to understand they are in a relationship but not living together , for example while studying . 
  at some point of their lives they want to live together , what can they do if they do n't meet the requirements to apply for a working visa ? 
  you are assuming that both of them live together what if they do n't ? 
   all this ` losing opportunities ' bollocks is getting annoying , just like the 1m + brits in australia if you really want to move to another country you can apply that works for australia or the usa , cause they are just too far , but what if a briton has a german girlfriend , and she does n't meet the requirements to apply ? 
  they would n't be able to live together unless they marry ? 
  40 years ago these kind of situations did n't occur , nowadays with the erasmus program and the free movement everything is different and the relations ( friendships and relationships ) with other eu nationals are something normal, 
  triggered, 
  i do n't get tanned just by walking in the street in a sunny day . 
  i have to be under the sun for a few hours to start getting tanned . 
  that 's why people get tanned in the beach and not in a normal working day . 
  and i know how the summers are in the northern countries , and at least for me , they are not hot enough to stay a few hours outside half naked, 
  many tourists come here and try to get the tan of 5 months in 2 weeks , risking their own skin . 
  i 've seen it with my own eyes here people can get tanned the whole summer so they dont tend to do risky things . 
  plus when you are used to sun you know what things to avoid, 
  people seem to like schulz, 
  we have 4 big parties here , the most right-wing of them is to the left of the democrats of the usa , somewhere close to bernie sanders i hope that answers your question, 
  i love the fact that they are called `` lords '' , it sounds so much epic, 
  and i keep saying the same after brexit , how will the gibraltarians move if the eu blocks the uk ? 
  the fence of gibraltar will be closed , what will they do then ? 
  97 % of gibraltarians voted remain for that reason . 
  if that happens i really believe that the gibraltarians will all fly to the uk cause life will be impossible there and gibraltar will remain empty, 
  i do n't care about gibraltar at all , there is a tiny land of 28k people , come on . 
  i do care about the fact that it is a tax haven and that affects us all, 
   if the usa is entitled to keep their land , which was founded in 1776 ; then why should the british cede gibraltar which was signed over in 1704 ? 
  where did i say that the british should cede gibraltar to spain in the first place ? 
  think a bit before posting, 
  well , we are talking about countries , not about lands . 
  morocco was n't a state , so to who should we return ceuta and melilla then ? 
  i was just pointing out the fact that you can not compare ceuta or melilla with gibraltar , since those 2 were n't colonies ( gibraltar is ), 
  then give back the united states to the natives . 
  we can continue this non-sense all day long, 
  morocco did n't become a state until 1666 with the alaouite dynasty  the kingdom was consolidated by ismail ibn sharif ( 1672 -- 1727 ) , who began to create a unified state in the face of opposition from local tribes . 
  since the alaouites , in contrast to previous dynasties , did not have the support of a single berber or bedouin tribe , isma ' \u012bl controlled morocco through an army of slaves . 
  with these soldiers he drove the english from tangiers ( 1684 ) and the spanish from larache in 1689 . 
  the unity of morocco did not survive his death -- in the ensuing power struggles the tribes became a political and military force once again , and it was only with muhammad iii ( 1757 -- 1790 ) that the kingdom was unified again.the idea of centralization was abandoned and the tribes allowed to preserve their autonomy . 
  [ citation needed ] on 20 december 1777 , [ 43 ] morocco became the very first state to recognize the sovereignty of a newly independent united states . 
  [ 44 ] ceuta was firstly portuguese , then spanish , but it never belonged to morocco, 
  well , one guy already attacked spain . 
  aparently he did n't notice that this news has nothing to do with spain nor the spanish government but with russia, 
  ceuta and melilla have never been part of morocco , unlike gibraltar that was spanish for more than 2 centuries until the english occupied it in 1704, 
  i am just a messenger , i do n't want to start a comment-war between spain and britain , so i think it is better if i keep my opinion for myself, 
  full article here https://gyazo.com/ebf4b3f3d50fd85a7032946f98229a5c ** edit : before attacking spain , keep in mind that this has nothing to do with spain nor the spanish goverment , but with russia **, 
  i will do the 22:00 shift, 
  good, 
  according to book ii of ovid \u00b4 s metamorphosis , jupiter fell in love with princess europe and transformed himself into a white bull in order to kidnap her . 
  he stealthily approaches the beach where she is playing with her companions in order to draw her away and carry her over the sea to crete . 
  the original painting is in the isabella stewart gardner museum of boston . 
  in the museo del prado in madrid hangs the copy that rubens made in 1628 https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/art-work/the-rape-of-europe/a136a9c4-3a2f-44bd-ab8a-97fd47c30d7e, 
  with all the shit-post that we have seen these days , and this is `` off-topic '' ? 
  i do n't think is a good idea to have mods that get triggered so easy and act based on that the fact that the mod who removed this is portuguese tells me a lot about this sub moderation, 
  the same happens frequently with the american flag and the english language luckily we do n't have that problem, 
  that can only mean that we are on the right path ( except for a few things that hopefully will be fixed soon ),
