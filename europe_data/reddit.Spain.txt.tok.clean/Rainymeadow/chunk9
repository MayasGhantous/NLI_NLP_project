  i really think no one can stop china from now on, 
  this is not surprising , our politicians are the biggest pussies in europe . 
  and this works both ways , they are pussies when they have to make deals with brussels aswell, 
  not for long, 
  the thing is , it does n't really matter what info europe gets from you , an independent catalonia would not get into the eu if spain does n't want to . 
  that 's why i said it was worthless , cause its never going to end . 
  we can keep arguing about this for the years to come , or we can all just move on and start using all that money for something actually useful, 
  i am not defending that either i am just saying that it was worthless for everyone, 
  they are not getting in bed with the eu no one invited them , they just rented a room to give a conference , and basically only spanish people attended ( except for a few nationalists from other countries ) and they spent 127.000 $ for that btw, 
  if you wish to give us a source proving that what i said is wrong , i will be pleased to see it . 
  this is not true , not even close ( at least talking about spain ) edit : before downvoting you can always man up and show us a source proving that the map is true, 
   the issue has split debate in the local community , with one birmingham city councillor arguing the ban is in violation of the equalities act they want that girl to wear just like all the other kids , and that 's against equality ? 
  i just do n't understand the term `` equality '' anymore then, 
  this shit got removed yesterday cause it is fully retarded . 
  if you want to use this map to push your own agenda just say it already , it will be faster . 
  that has nothing to do with what people think about it nowadays and if you want to talk about nowadays , i will leave you this [ map ] ( http://vegamediapress.es/upload/img/periodico/img_12395.jpg ) , maybe it will help you with that anti-spanish xenophobia that you showed in previous comments , including this one it is in french tho , i hope you can understand it, 
  there is nothing else to translate . 
  they mostly describe the agression and that the police got 2 of them . 
  the important thing is the video . 
  the reason why they attacked her is already translated in my first comment . 
  source of that ? 
  the victim : `` i was n't wearing any political sign , only a bracelet with the spanish flag . 
   racist newspapers whipping up fear , fake news slanting elections -- had enough ? 
  join opendemocracy and hear from brian eno , caroline lucas , peter oborne , yanis varoufakis , paul mason & many more on what happens next . 
  lol, 
  asturias similar to andalucia \u00bf ? \u00bf ? \u00bf ? 
  another map that makes no sense, 
  since i edited my original post showing how wrong all these people were , i got 3 downvotes in 1 minute . 
  like explaining something is going to work , all these retards will think the same no matter how many proofs you show them once more liberals failing at protecting women . 
  i try to show them how wrong they are , and all i get are insults . 
  there you go , worst countries for gender equality lebanon placed 8\u00ba worst country . 
  but yeah , i guess it was all based in prejudices and racism, 
  if you could quote exactly where i talked about races , i would be pleased . 
  thanks, 
  i 've been there many times . 
  i still wonder , if 36 % of the country see women as inferior , how is it possible that the vast majority voted for a woman as prime minister i guess there are many women in politics in ghana , lebanon or pakistan, 
  how old are you ? 
  and who is talking about races here ? 
  leftist governments maybe not , but dictatorships do . 
  all the media there is controlled by the goverment and therefore is extremely biased . 
  most of people there have a far-left mentallity, 
  offended ? 
  did you see that all that has nothing to do with my country ? 
  how can i become offended ? 
  the blind people , that offends me more, 
  if you follow a religion that says women are inferior , means that you agree with that . 
  is not about prejudices , but we are in / r/europe so whatever, 
  still 60 % of the population is muslim , and venezuela is a far-left country for example only a person out of his mind can believe that the woman rights are higher in lebanon than in any american/european country, 
   i hate poles that much than i want to believe that ghana scores better in women rights than poland, 
  this map is just retarded ghana higher than poland ? 
  lebanon higher than venezuela or mexico ? 
  the us higher than spain or france and still they voted for trump ? 
  this just makes no sense at all ** edit : ** http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/mapped-the-best-and-worst-countries-for-gender-equality/ there we go , worst countries in the world for gender equality pakistan 2\u00ba lebanon 8\u00ba according to this map , pakistan is at the same level than poland for example , and lebanon is way higher ** i am so sorry for all those who are out of excuses from now on . 
  you can all call me racist if that makes you feel better . 
  peace **, 
  did you ever hear a dane speaking danish ? 
  for me it sounds like they are just vomiting a few sounds . 
  but the most amazing thing is that it actually works , cause aparently they understand each other, 
  you wish, 
   the eu collapsing would be a disaster for so many people . 
  she is talking about europe , not the eu, 
  i have no idea about wines , i will die before my 60s, 
  all my grandparents lived into their 90s , 2 grandmas 95 + they all started drinking wine as kids , at the age of 8-10 so you better start drinking now if you want to catch up, 
  if the british leave , richer europeans than the brits will fill their place , such as germans/swedes/dutchs . 
  but we are not talking about richness here , since i do n't care about how much money has a person in his bank account . 
  are you sure ? 
  take the basque country for example , the exportations to the uk are not even the 6 % of the total and the most important thing , we export 1.300 m $ to the uk , while ** we import 1.500 m $ from you guys ** here the source : [ exports ] ( http://www.eustat.eus/elementos/ele0005700/ti_ranking_de_las_exportaciones_de_la_ca_de_euskadi_por_paises_miles_de_euros__2014/tbl0005722_c.html ) [ imports ] ( http://www.eustat.eus/elementos/ele0005700/ti_ranking_de_las_importaciones_de_la_ca_de_euskadi_por_paises_miles_de_euros__2014/tbl0005723_c.html ) with this brexit thing hopefully you will find out that you are not as much important as you think, 
  you should stop thinking that you are better than the rest of spain . 
  for example :  spain has way too many politicians , animal abuse as `` culture '' , ** corruption ** so then , how can you explain the fact that catalonia is the most corrupted region of spain ? 
  [ 1 ] ( http://s.libertaddigital.com/fotos/noticias/cor001.jpg ) in my opinion , you would n't be better than you are now , basically cause you would have to create your own currency , you would be out of the eu , and you would not be able to do any kind of trade agreement with any important country . 
  i guess you know all that , deep in you . 
  i do n't feel represented by the image that people have of spain around the world either , but what to do , those are stereotypes and you ca n't fight against that . 
  sure ? 
  cause almost all your comments are on / r/europe and all of them are about the uk i do n't really care from where you are , but you are far from being neutral, 
  how are you neutral ? 
  the richest areas of spain are the ones without tourism . 
  if tourism is that good for us , why the difference between northern spain ( no tourism at all ) and southern spain ( overcrowed by tourists ) is that big ? 
  and do you actually think that 75 % ppl of spain work in the tourism industry ? 
  lol the english always surprise me and btw , we do n't have 25 % of unemployment , but what to do , ignorance is not a crime, 
  that 's funny , since we have a lot of english immigrants here . 
  oh wait , they just want it one sided, 
  [ change all the british references for polish ones , and place this bar in the uk . 
  it would be insteresting to watch ] ( https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c75d5fb8e7f3ebe778c82e40bd64d15894165847/0_295_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=1920&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=da9166e87cad19b818c44615d3ceb9be ), 
  no , the max speed is 1200 km/h i guess when they say 1,5 h from brno to prague , they mean by train , so they are comparing the hyperloop with trains , not with planes . 
  it would be a bit faster than planes . 
  the main advantages is that you wo n't have to wait in an airport cause it would be like taking a train that goes faster than a plane , it would be way cheaper than planes/trains , and it would be fully eco friendly . 
  lol then you ask yourself why people hate you ? 
  maybe stop thinking that you are better than everyone else, 
  everyone detests arrogance, 
  i could attack england back , just like you did with spain for no reason , but again , i am not like you . 
  who is talking about kicking anyone out ? 
  we are not like you guys, 
  this is even funnier if you speak spanish the way the cities are named remind me of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phct2uhve58 ), 
  do you remember that brexit thing of `` we will lose money , but it is still worth it '' ? 
   you would be doing us a great favour, 
   is there an expression in castilian similar to do n't bite the hand that feeds you ? 
  yep there is . 
  but let me add a little twist to that . 
  change `` hand '' by `` cock '' and say it to the english women that we have around here , 
  you obviously did n't get me i did n't expect you to anyway the fact that you are constantly trying to trigger me tells me that i did great here .
