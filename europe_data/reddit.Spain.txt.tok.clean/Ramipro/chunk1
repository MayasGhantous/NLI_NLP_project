i agree that it 's a bit different since there was a clause that pbligated the government to return the investment if the project was cancelled , but that doesnt remove the fact that there should be a risk in investing . 
  same happened with a gas storage facility in spain . 
  they started it with a very controversial situation , and the government was forced to cancel the project , while indemnifying up to 1300 million $ . 
  you 'll get downvoted , because that 's how democracy works . 
  nobody likes being called stupid . 
  i agree with you , though . 
  even i probably should n't be able to vote at all , since i do n't have a full understanding of how economy and politics , and i do n't want to influence a bad decision because of my ignorance . 
  just so you know , you 're not the only one who thinks like that . 
  thw thing is that technocracy is sometimes associated with fascism and opression , but i feel like they are wrongly associated . 
  youre not the only one who thinka that , sadly . 
  it 's produced by cup , one of pro-cessession parties . 
  i ca n't speak for the majority of catalans , but i personally would like to keep the euro but have a bilateral agreement of freedom of borders , like the shengen area . 
  that might give us some fiscal freedom while maintaining the benefits of free trade between european nations . 
  i am not an economist , so feel free to correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  true . 
  the other countries were so occupied trying to bring up the morale of their citizens that they published false reports so as to not scare the population, 
  well , the father of the president of prisa group was the director of `` arriba '' , the main voice of the falange . 
  he himself was the chief editor of `` pueblo '' , the newspaper of the movimiento nacional . 
  you forgot system of a down !, 
  although they are not technically european ( armenian-americans ) they sing a lot about europe 's politics here 's one talking about the armenian genocide : [ p.l.u.c.k.

  el pais is n't what i 'd call a reliable source . 
  are you a constitutional justice ? 
  then do n't say it 's illegal because we do n't know yet . 
  now that i 've made that clear let 's get to some other points . 
  first , the government says the law of non referendary consultations is illegal and inconstitutional . 
  guess what ? 
  the estatut already gives the generalitat the right to summon a non binding referendum , and the constitutional court already declared that to be constitutional in 2010 . 
  second , that the consultation goes against the 2nd article of the spanish constitution . 
  and again , it does not . 
  a consultation is not a declaration of independence . 
  the integrity of the spanish nation will be left untouched after the consultation is done , even though i do n't know for how long . 
  the aftermath of 9n might end up breaking spain apart , but asking the people of catalonia will not . 
  it 's like the government does n't know the difference between a consultation and a unilateral declaration of independence . 
  the former does not violate article n\u00ba 2 . 
  spain will still be a united nation after the consultation , even though i do n't know for how long . 
  moreover , constitutional justices are n't required to be apolitical , since they are constitutional justices and do n't abide by the organic law http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/francisco_p%c3%a9rez_de_los_cobos#pol.c3.a9mica, 
  what i understood from his text is that , generally , spain is a shithole , which depends greatly on the richer areas to progress . 
  once they realize they ca n't depend on the rich , they 'll try to fix the problems that turn it into a underdeveloped country and actually strive for economic growth . 
  that 's what i understood from his post , and i sort of agree with it . 
  because it 's the small towns that are the most catalan . 
  in the bigger cities ( barcelona , tarragona ) , there 's a more diverse culture , since there 's a lot of immigrants from all around the globe , so the support for the culture is lesser than on smaller towns . 
  this is what truly fucking blows my mind . 
  how in earth can a judge , and mind you , a ** constitutional ** one , be affiliated to a political party ?!, 
  have they not heard of the separation of powers ? 
  conflict of interest ? 
  seriously this country is fucked, 
  c2 catalan , spanish ( native ) c2 english b2 galician ( and to some extent , portuguese ) a2 french working on my russian, 
  yup pera = pear parab\u00f3lica = parabolic -  p ** e ** rab\u00f3lica there are a lot that do n't work though , like the one that says : why do the people of lepe never enter the kitchen ? 
  because there 's a jar that says `` salt '' in spanish , the word for salt is `` sal '' , which also means `` get out '', 
  why do the people of lepe put a pear on top of the tv ? 
  to have a pearabolic antenna . 
  i would kill to get that much !, 
  and it 's not a lot of gigabytes either ... 
  here in spain a common data limit is 1 gb ... 
  mine actually is 500mb it 's truly excruciating knowing that in other countries you can get completely unrestricted mobile access ... :(, 
  i always heard `` donde jes\u00fas perdi\u00f3 la chancleta '' - `` where jesus lost his flip-flop '' and similar to sebastopol , cuenca is a widely used one . 
  also `` la quinta polla '' or `` la quinta china '' , literally the fifth dick and the fifth china, 
  you are right . 
  if he really thinks that spain moved the industry there because it was closer to europe , he has no understanding of the industrial revolution in spain . 
  still to this day , only those two regions are the ones that produce the most industry for spain . 
  the rest of spain is barely populated , with an ageing population that does n't strive for economic growth , only for self sustainability . 
  see [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jyuhdg4.png ) chart for the gdp per capita , and notice how the top regions which produce the most gdp are precisely those ones , excluding madrid , which is the capital and that status is bound to produce economic growth . 
  there 's www.thomann.de/gb/index.html if you 're looking for music equipment . 
  beware , though , since their shipping rates can be a bit high ( 20 $ for spain and hungary , lowest is 3 $ for germany ) . 
  well , that 's what happens in spain as well . 
  to cite an example , the bullfighting arena called las arenas , built in 1900 , has been converted into a shopping centre . 
  most other historical buildings are either owned by private investors or repurposed to serve a commercial function . 
  you ca n't expect people to refurbish and maintain a building if it is not going to return the investment . 
  it 's just the way it is . 
  spain rich ? 
  lol, 
  added paragraph : the commision reminds you in this context that , in conformity with article 3 , section 2 , of teu , the union must respect the < < national identity [ of the member states ] , inherent to their fundamental political and constitutional structures , as well as in reference to local and regional autonomy . 
  it will respect the essential functions of the state , especially the ones that must guarantee its territorial integrity   . 
  the determination of the member state 's territory is exclusively determined by the national constitutional right , not by a decision of an autonomic parliament opposed to the constitution of such state . 
  adding to that , they are in favor of a referendum , but have stated that they might eventually position themselves if a referendum does occur . 
  the estelada flag only represents the independentist movement . 
  if we do become an independent country , the official flag wo n't be the one with the star . 
  it was catalonia 's national day , which sort of has nationalistic connotations , and there were indeed public concerts , etc. . . 
  but this particular event ( the 1.4 m atendees ) was absolutely independentist and anyone who thinks otherwise is fooling themselves . 
  it was organized by an independentist organization and had clear separatist connotation . 
  they 've dabbled with the thought several times , like last year 's `` illegal '' referendum , or , like this time , saying that the army wo n't intervene if everyone does one 's duty . 
  they did n't say it for today 's rally though , but for 27s , the elections for the catalonian parliament . 
  you 've got [ this ] ( http://www.ccma.cat/tv3/directe/tv3/ ) link , from catalonia 's national tv . 
  the main part is done , but the event is not over yet . 
  there 'll be speeches and other stuff , and the final act . 
  [ seems like we got it figured out !, 
  lol , in spain is , the very least , 25 % . 
  with your salary you 'd actually be around 40 % tax . 
  guise , dont feed the troles, 
  so was the nazi salute , yet you do n't see public organizations using it . 
  that 's ... actually really accurate ... 
   anti-corruption organizations lol , theyre a far right `` trade union '' . 
  the anti corruption thing is just a fa\u00e7ade . 
  they regularly submit false reports and false evidence in order to try to delegimize opposing ideologies . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/strawperson i 'm not saying he is responsible , only that he could be . 
  needs more arid wasteland, 
  may i ask what tools you used ? 
  is photoshop/gimp/paint or some mapping tool ? 
  because the result is very clean !,
