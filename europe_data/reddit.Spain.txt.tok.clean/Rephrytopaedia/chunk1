the natural borders of most historical iberian kingdoms were viable for a 4 year old with floaties and/or a sandwich for dinner . 
  on the other hand , most of the boundary line between portugal and spain has annealed through the ages into a long line of fucked-up rivers and mountain passes . 
  i believe anyone could write `` iros todos a tomar por el culo '' in spanish and demonstrate that every single word appears in the oxford english dictionary . 
  it 's that comprehensive . 
  kitchen aficionados : potato omelettes are n't called `` raw potato omelettes '' for a reason . 
   -- what 's the world 's most profitable business ? 
   to buy a spaniard for what he 's worth and sell him for what he thinks he is . 
  is there any chance some of the spaniards you have met are of the madrileno persuasion ? 
  maybe in the * early * 80 's . 
  in the late 80 's we can only document a solved problem . 
  don quixote . 
  a modern novel from the sixteenth century . 
  hundreds upon hundreds of pages of superb narrative and character development . 
  so what ? 
  that target list is from warsaw pact times , and it fits warsaw pact boundaries . 
  as such , all targets in germany are in east germany . 
  what did you expect ? 
  in which grounds would eastern germans be spared ? 
  is horrible , protracted death a czech or a polish ( but not german ) thing ? 
  a macbook ( or some other apple products ) might be inappropriately expensive for a nephew 's gift in spain . 
  it 'd be more like a parents ' or a spouse 's gift . 
  fortunately , there 's nothing that 'd be much cheaper in the us , unless you 'd want to cater for some very obscure interests ( some trendy clothing , some brand of soap you wo n't find here , a laptop with no valid warranty and a us keyboard ... ) what if your aunt and uncle lived somewhere else in the us ? 
  what would you give them , then ? 
  give them that . 
  rejoice with us !!, 
  picasso did most of his deed while being in france !, 
  public safety communication only in the language of the majority of the voters sounds like a really dick move . 
  this book is n't a mere museum leaflet . 
  visitors and language minorities would rightfully find themselves not only alienated , but put in a more dangerous situation . 
  in many places across the eu it 's been decades since it 's usual that the most mundane public announcements ( not to say security announcements ) are routinely delivered in more than one language . 
  fuck the earlier sun . 
  it 's most useful in safe , developed countries like scotland or japan , where children would walk alone to school in the early hours of the morning . 
  everywhere else , late afternoon sun is usually more appreciated . 
  the place to be is m\u00e1laga . 
  quick and cheap connections with lots of places in europe and spain . 
  a very convenient airport that 's not a time-gobbling nightmare come true . 
  a town with amenities , the seaside and lots of other quality options for living and visiting around . 
  and , if you want to stay in m\u00e1laga the town , very convenient , affordable housing in streets that are ... not littered , you know ? 
  in all seriousness , for any specific salary or job , madrid is a filthy nightmare when compared to almost any other place in spain . 
  not to say m\u00e1laga . 
  and plane connections from m\u00e1laga are almost as good , if not actually better . 
  hey i do n't believe [ secret garden 's nocturne ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pgsx9kljxw ) or [ loreen 's euphoria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfo-8z86x80 ) ( among many others ) were meant to be crappy in a contest that 's so prone to reward attention whoring . 
  some countries sometimes ( particularly the uk ) have a tad of self respect and they still take this contest very seriously . 
  in other things , if all we could remember were the crappy songs , for sure they 'd be the right choice anyway . 
  ask eastern germans about the adoption of the west german deutsche mark . 
   britain will be offered a free trade deal before the rest of the european union if the republicans win the us presidential election , donald trump 's trade adviser has said . 
  dan dimicco said britain was `` a friend '' of america and was leaving the eu for the right reasons . 
  i would n't touch this whole thing with a three-foot pole ... 
  it 's almost like this guy has in mind to spite the eu . 
  his only motivations should be the best interests of the us and the mutual interests of the parts to any treaty . 
  not in op 's map as it 's rendered on my browser . 
  opps you are right !!, 
  anyway madrid should be on its own in op 's map , as a distinct nuts-1 region . 
  it 's lots of people and otherwise it 'd dominate statistics in central spain . 
   nuts-1 not in spain . 
  in spain they are just weird . 
  plus , it 's been since the 19th century that we have much more munched up statistical data . 
  grouping up rural areas with geographically close urban areas is just plain stupid . 
  the colours in spain are bullshit , as they are heavily skewed by the prevalence of urban population . 
  no way . 
  a full-on trade war would make the uk hit a slump and the population would go full berserk . 
  the uk would become the little second russia in the west , spain would have to divert their scarce monies to a brand-new blue sea navy , would have to breach the npt to achieve full strategic parity , morocco would immediately follow suit ... 
  funny negotiation ahead . 
  in spain , the formerly warring iberian kingdomlets of castile and le\u00f3n were peacefully united for good in the 13th century . 
  in spite of that , petty grudges and crime ( cross-vandalisation of symbols on public property ) go on to this day . 
  that 's moronic . 
  do n't be a moron . 
  repost from [ r/worldnews ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/ ) . 
  kudos to [ user/maxwellhill ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/maxwellhill ) for spotting it . 
  i do understand why . 
  down here stereotypical brits look like some stern bruce forsyth in a bowler hat . 
  i mean , the brits you would imagine roaming london . 
  this guy deserves an award for patriotism from abroad . 
  the soviet union was dastardly attacked , suffered the heaviest losses by far , and it was instrumental in the demise of fascism in 1945 . 
  yet it was n't until 1989 that they started * liberating * anything . 
  by the 20th century spain was still choke-full of medieval christians like [ these ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yef_komcgs ) . 
  the transition to a modern culture was swift and uneventful , though it 's true it all happened after the war of spain , in a time of relative prosperity and fulfilled ( if modest ) expectations . 
  definitely . 
  here you have a prettier map : http://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvgis/cmaps/eu_cmsaf_opt/pvgis_eu_201204_publication.png, 
  galicia would be the iberian winner of some `` it looks more like ireland ! '', 
  contest , but mediterranean forests in southern france would make for a much better match with most quintessential galician landscapes . 
  funnily enough , from an irish perspective the provence and galicia are also closely related linguistically . 
  galicia owes its lavish vegetation to both rain and sunny spells , whereas ireland only gets the saddest part of the deal : http://www.efi.int/files/attachments/associate_affiliate_members/efi_forest_map_a0_d_191212.jpg http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/figures/average-annual-precipitation https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/europe_sunshine_hours_map.png, 
  just a saddening ( but minor ) side effect of freedom . 
  in spain , the formerly warring iberian kingdomlets of castile and le\u00f3n were peacefully united for good in the 13th century . 
  in spite of that , cross-vandalisation of symbols on public property goes on to this day . 
  free movement of people might be a perfectly reasonable thing to like about the eu . 
  we both the spaniards and the greek risk instant ( or protracted ) death , and the devastation of most that 's dear to us , just because our polities are committed to the defence of faraway countries and people of whom we know almost nothing . 
  hope you 'll grow to appreciate that commitment , at best as much as you appreciate cultural ties with your neighbours . 
  cultural ties are accidental , and lasting . 
  commitment is a choice . 
   yep , this is typical news piece that will never appear on any national tv network . 
   and if it does , they will ensure to make it look as if `` those communist pigs from brussels are threating our sovereignty ! '' . 
  i 'm not fond of spanish tv and i 'm honestly curious about them delivering such a loaded message about `` brussels '' . 
  do you remember any relevant newscast that might be available on youtube ? 
  antagonising foreign negotiators , and doing it against the best interest for her land . 
  treason meet stupidity . 
  i do n't fathom many a spanish politician would try and scare or reassure anything britain . 
  most non-resident spaniards are only acquainted with christmas shopping up and down oxford street . 
  if they ventured into some north england slum they 'd question themselves what 's more scary , whether it is the eu , the absence of it , or britain itself .
