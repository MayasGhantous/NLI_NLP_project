and on the other end we have jorge verstrynge , who started as a neo-nazi , then led pp 's predecessor ( taking over from that same dictatorship minister ) , joined the socialists , then the communists , and was recently arrested in a pro-republic protest . 
  i 've just checked [ his wiki article ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/jorge_verstrynge ) to see what else he 's done and apparently he supports podemos now !, 
  her ex-husband ( also a member of the party ) is being investigated in a corruption case , and she pretended to know nothing . 
  well , just like the king 's sister !, 
  but we need to import more of them this time , to keep the gene pool varied , 
  we probably just lie about it , 
  something something gr8 b8 m8, 
  or a flamenco dancer , or a `` t\u00edo pepe '' ... 
  nah , that uses a proper date format at least , that can pass . 
  that used to be true in spain too , the limit used to be 100 km/h in your first year . 
  right now , you still have to stick a green `` l '' plate on the rear window during your first year , to show you 're a new driver . 
  in the first 3 years , the maximum bac content is 0.3 instead of 0.5 . 
  his grandson likes hunting his own foot . 
  people seemed to tolerate him a fair bit . 
  the expression ` i 'm not a monarchist , i 'm a `` juancarlist '' ' was common . 
  objectively , felipe seems to be better qualified , and now he 's more popular than juan carlos . 
  but i still want the right to vote against him . 
  it 's actually male-preference succession . 
  felipe will inherit because he 's a man , even if he 's the youngest of the three siblings . 
  his first child was a daughter , so when he was expecting the second one there was some debate on whether to change the law to equal preference . 
  then it turned out to be a daughter too , so changing the law was n't immediately necessary . 
  it 's very unlikely that they 'll have any more kids - apparently felipe 's wife was married to another man before and had her fallopian tubes `` tied '' . 
  for a while , price felipe and his wife went on many `` official visits '' to valencia , but they were actually going to the infertility institute to try and get her pregnant . 
  fun fact : spain changed their limit to 110 km/h back in 2011 , because of the increase in petrol prices . 
  they had to put magnetic `` 110 '' stickers on top of all traffic signs , only to remove them a couple months later when prices went down and they put the limit back up to 120 . 
  [ well , of course ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho04r8nwsps ), 
  they 're actually two different things . 
  `` seseo '' is using the 's ' sound for all the cases above ( like in latin america and parts of andaluc\u00eda ) . 
  `` ceceo is using the ' \u03b8 ' sound for all the cases above ( like in other parts of andaluc\u00eda ) . 
  the letter s has an 's ' sound . 
  the ' \u03b8 ' sound is for the z , and for c before e and i ( otherwise it sounds like ` k ' , as usual ) . 
  for example , in spanish we call it `` arroba '' , which is a pre-metric weight measurement ( 25 pounds , or something like that , but i do n't know if it 's in imperial pounds or some other value ) . 
  i could n't drive back then . 
  i think you could be banned for a few months after serious/repeated offences , and it could be made permanent it was very serious . 
  now you can run out of points after 3-4 speeding fines , regardless of how close they are in time . 
  before the points system you might have got banned for 3 months by the time you get to the 3rd/4th offence . 
  in spain we implemented the points system in our driving license , which has worked well . 
  we also have tougher laws , especially regarding drinking and driving . 
  i think we 're down to pre-1960 numbers in fatal accidents . 
  jueves \u2260 huevos ( unless you 're joking and i failed to get the subtlety of north carolinan humour ... ), 
  does la gaceta ( intereconom\u00eda 's newspaper ) still exist ? 
  if so , there 's another contender ... ninja-edit : after some quick googling , it appears that they stopped printing it a couple of weeks ago , but the online edition still works . 
  great argument for outbreeding !, 
  they share the privilege with the dutch . 
  quite a few of them have been created , and some of the existing smaller parties have become more popular , but still not enough to stand against the two big ones . 
  i really hope that when the king refused to abdicate a couple of weeks ago , it was because he thinks that we 're not gon na accept his son . 
  that thing where peope say `` i 'm not a monarchist , i 'm just a ` juancarlist ' '' is a bit of a clich\u00e9 , but felipe will be nowhere near as popular as his dad . 
  same as in [ spain in 1870 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amadeo_i_of_spain ) , but he was kicked out quickly . 
  i tried a.k. 
  damm the other day and i really liked it , although it 's more of a regular pilsener . 
  yes !, 
  everything that used to cost 100 pesetas ( $ 0.60 ) suddenly went up to $ 1 , but salaries did n't change much . 
  if does n't help either when nearly everything that costed 100 pesetas ( $ 0.60 ) was suddenly rounded up to 1 euro , while salaries stayed pretty much the same . 
  but if they have good climate , then they wo n't come to mallorca !, 
  what do we do with all this overpriced sangr\u00eda now ? 
  yeah , that 's why i asked , i 've seen it in segovia , and some other places of western spain , so i wondered if the portuguese did it too . 
  do you do that thing where you cook it in one piece , and then break it up by hitting it with the edge of a plate ? 
  45/45 while drunk , i had to guess which one was montenegro and which one was kosovo , but that was 50:50 . 
  does n't matter , you can still get cheap cds , sunglasses and absinthe !, 
  it depends on the team . 
  rayo fans would definitely be supportive . 
  \\  good men \\  french, 
  arr\u00f2s al forn  paella , any day of the week . 
  [ fideu\u00e1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fideu%c3%a0 ) and [ rossejat ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/rossejat ) ( or * arrosechar * , like my grandma calls it ) are amazing too . 
  my family 's from cuenca , so i 'm partial towards [ migas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/migas ) ( breadcrumbs ) . 
  it 's a very traditional dish from the countryside , they 'd cook a massive pot to use up all their old bread and take it with them when working in the fields . 
  it 's got chorizo and panceta in it , and it 's served with fruit ( melon , grapes or cherries ) , because farmers would grab whatever fruit they had closest and eat it along with the meal . 
  we 'll do it tomorrow . 
  i know that they wo n't take any conditions to form a coalition , but before them pp did n't stand a chance and now they do . 
  rajoy is going anyway , and they 're setting up n\u00fa\u00f1ez feij\u00f3o as his successor , but ciudadanos could get a say in that . 
  actually , i 'd say that a psoe-cs centre alliance would be a pretty realistic option too , ciudadanos definitely want to keep their options open for now . 
  born in spain , moved to manchester . 
  so , the opposite of beckham . 
  which would make sense if you saw me play football ... 
  i 'm scared about ciudadanos . 
  they might grab many votes from undecided voters ( plus the odd pissed-off pp/psoe voter ) , and if they form a coalition with pp , it 's four more years . 
  i would like to see an actual centre option ( i would n't vote for them , but there should be one ) , but ciudadanos ( and upyd before them , if they had been successful ) ca n't hide that they 're just gon na jump on to the winning team . 
  dunno , africa looks all the same to me , 
  after the municipal elections on the 24th of may , all town halls have had their investiture debates to choose new mayors ( the deadline was on friday ) . 
  conservative party * pp * got the most votes again , but lost their absolute majorities almost everywhere . 
  this means that in many places , several left-wing parties were able to form coalitions and win . 
  the new left-wing party * podemos * decided not to run in these elections , but they supported local platforms like the ones that have won in madrid and barcelona . 
  the left-wing regionalist coalition * comprom\u00eds * who won in valencia are ideologically similar , but they were already established before * podemos * came along . 
  the other `` new '' party , * ciudadanos * , did n't win in any major cities , but they 've joined many coalitions . 
  depending on who you ask , they 're centre or centre-right , and although they claimed to have nothing in common with * pp * and * psoe * ( social-democrats ) , they 'll be ruling with both of them in some places . 
  at least they might be able to force some corrupt members of both parties out , and stop some of their more controversial ideas ( a bit like the lib dems stopping the conservatives in the uk ) . 
  [ / u/txobi 's post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/39perg/before_and_after_of_the_ruling_parties_in_the/ ) shows the results in each province capital . 
  we also had elections for most autonomic parliaments , but they have more time to discuss things before electing presidents . 
  for example , andalucia had early elections a couple months ago and they only reached an agreement this week ( * psoe * will rule in coalition with * ciudadanos * after breaking negotiations with * podemos * ) . 
  in general , the results of these elections will be pretty similar , with * pp * losing their absolute majorities . 
  they 'll probably still hold on to madrid and a couple of others with the help of * ciudadanos * . 
  ciu only run in catalonia . 
  in valencia , left-wing regionalists often agree that valencia , catalonia and baleares share [ one culture and one language ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pa%c3%afsos_catalans ) . 
  right-wing regionalists or '' [ blavers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blaverism ) '' will insist that valencian and catalan are two different languages , and hate catalonia in general . 
  hahaha , i knew the joke as  what do you get if you put three trotskyists in a room for an hour ? 
   four internationals . 
  she 's the leader of a citizen platform that started as an anti-evictions organisation , helping people who lost their homes to the banks . 
  the new left-wing party * podemos * announced that they would n't run for the local elections , but they would support grassroots initiatives like this one . 
  they have been the most voted party in barcelona , and the equivalent organisation might win madrid too if they team up with the traditional left-wing parties . 
  as you can see in the picture , their peaceful protests have been dissolved by the police before .
