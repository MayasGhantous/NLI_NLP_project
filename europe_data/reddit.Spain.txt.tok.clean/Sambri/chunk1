note that eez waters are international waters . 
  however , only one country can exploit the resources in those waters ( such as fishing ) . 
  the translated text in this article is quite misleading `` escorted out '' actually means , `` followed and watched them till they leaved the area '' . 
  it 's not only about corruption , it 's also about getting the best people for the job ... if they are not paid as much as in the private sector many would n't take the job . 
  and to make things even more complicated , parts of those criminal activities are legal or pseudolegal ( taxes are paid ) in some countries such as certain drugs ( the netherlands ) , prostitution ( germany , again the netherlands ) . 
  schutzstaffel is most commonly know as ss . 
  those runes resemble an `` s '' and were worn in their uniforms . 
   one motherfucker who was wearing his usual uniform . 
  and not to tell their enemies they reserves were diminishing ... 
  yes , they are supposed to have lived for two years in spain , but they are granted residence permits easily ( i know a couple cases ) . 
  the new law that grants them citizenship is supposed to be put in force soon . 
  in any case , it is an extension of the `` ius sanguinis '' which is what i wanted to remark . 
  in europe , most countries have `` ius sanguinis '' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_sanguinis basically , you are a citizen of the country ( ies ) your parents are from . 
  the difference with the usa and most of the other american countries where the right of birth is followed ( in general , countries that received a lot of immigrants do the same ) . 
  there exist many exceptions , for example many nordic/germanic countries allow kids borned there to become nationals when they are 18 , if they chose so ( but have to reject any other nationalities they have ) . 
  in the case of spain , kids have to live for one year in spain and then they can be spanish . 
  in some cases the ius sanguinis rights go quite far , for example , the descendants of the spanish jews that were expelled in 1492 ( sephardims ) that can prove links to spanish culture ( such as still speaking spanish or having a spanish surname ) can request spanish citizenship . 
  the same goes for the descendants of the spaniards that had to go to exile due to the civil war ( 1936 ) . 
  after telling an american that i was spanish , she asked if i knew how to cook tacos . 
  so that 10 % may very well think we are mexicans or something . 
  the coast is off limits . 
  well , the grammar of the sentence is fine , the content is wrong ... 
  because spain might not want to do so ? 
  ingle in spanish has no bad meaning , it 's just the area that connects your legs with your torso . 
  your brother has no groin ? 
  you ca n't talk to women , you ca n't even look at them . 
  of course this must be implemented by forcing women to wear the burka , not by not allowing you to look . 
  which is a reason we could revive night-trains . 
  take a train at 10pm in madrid , wake up at 8am in oslo . 
  spanish high speed track gauge is already the same than in france . 
  there are systems than convert `` easily '' from one gauge to the other ( takes around 15-20 minutes plus acceleration/deceleration ) , they are used in many of the non-completed lines in spain . 
  well , the problem is that they have sections in which the speed is limited , are there plans to improve those sections ? 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high-speed_rail_in_europe#mediaviewer/file:high_speed_railroad_map_of_europe_2013.svg ) german network is quite nice but some lines are not completely upgraded ( many `` high speed lines '' have grey sections ) and is , in general , not that fast ( mostly yellow lines , 200-230 km/h ) . 
  as for the netherlands and belgium ... with the fyra fiasco i would n't say they have a high speed network . 
  you have no embassy in andorra , but are welcome to use the spanish one , in case of emergency , of course ;p, 
  he has n't said the eu courts ca n't overrule some laws of any member state , they do . 
  however constitutional law is still over eu law ( depending on each country , the uk has no constitution , for example ) . 
  also , the case you mention is probably [ this ] ( http://www.humanrightseurope.org/2014/01/court-italy-discriminates-against-parents-by-banning-right-to-give-daughter-mums-surname/ ) which took place in the european court of human rights , completely unrelated to the eu . 
  most do n't ( except gibraltar ) . 
  part 4 of this [ treaty ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_on_the_functioning_of_the_european_union#treaty_on_the_functioning_of_the_european_union ) covers how they function . 
  those territories have implemented some of the eu agreements , but it 's different depending on the specific territory . 
  ( note : there are still many special territories within the eu such as gibraltar , ceuta , melilla , the azores , \u00c5land and many others ) . 
  in case of emergencies and assuming no embassy , or consulate , of your country is available , eu embassies have the obligation to take the members of other countries ( of the eu ) under their protection . 
  but yes , i meant things like un membership . 
  three of the most importants bits of being a state are not met : having a single army , being a single entity for international institutions , and having its own , independent , tax system . 
  also , calculation of said figures is different in every country `` being able to write and read '' is not very well defined . 
  it already exists : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trans-european_high-speed_rail_network part of the spanish high speed train network is payed by europe ( note that spain and france are currently the only countries with a more or less extended and functioning network ) . 
  the spanish network is already much bigger than that : http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/alta_velocidad_ferroviaria_en_espa%c3%b1a#mediaviewer/archivo:highspeedspain.svg, 
  the line madrid-seville ( high speed ) was completed in 1992 ... nowadays there are a couple lines more active : madrid-barcelona and madrid-valencia . 
  several other lines , including madrid-extremadura are already in construction ; the connection of this line to lisbon was stopped by the portuguese government . 
  countries with low demand may receive the gas only by ship , those with great demands need to install pipelines , which are expensive . 
  depending on who paid the bill for the pipeline the price will go up or down . 
  also , if russia is the only one that can provide for the amounts required ... russia becomes the monopoly and thus can impose the price it desires . 
  china is an ally of north korea , not russia . 
  signaling , communications , respecting chain of command ... 
  could you explain a bit more ? 
  sounds interesting . 
  column on the far right : `` lectores diarios '' ( daily readers ) . 
  ahemm  http://www.marca.com/multimedia/primeras/14/07/0729.html note : most popular as in more readers per day , not necessarily most newspapers distributed , or sold . 
  most countries can be self-sufficient ... at least if we are talking about having enough food to survive ; `` luxury '' food or military equipment are something completely different . 
  of course if an army starts to burn down your crops and steal your reserves , then , you have a problem . 
  similar prices in spain ... 
  guess part of which country cuba was ... 
  does n't the law force drivers to stop every so and so ? 
  ( by drivers i mean professional drivers ) . 
  there 's no `` basic requirement '' , the 2 % dedicated to defence is only a recommendation . 
  in english a princess is any daughter of the king . 
  in spain only the heir can be the prince/princess ( which makes sense as the latin root for prince is `` first '' . 
  personally i think bbc should keep her title as is and not give her a new one , although i understand that most foreigners do n't know what a `` infanta/infante '' means . 
  still , they have already made the move and if they left it 's less probable they go back . 
  it 's even dumber to just put a time frame ; a judge has to accept the new evidences and whether that evidence is enough to reopen the case . 
  and there are always other rules the judges must follow . 
  take into account that it happens both ways , it may put someone in jail or it may `` save '' someone already in jail ... which i would n't like not to see happen `` because you have to wait x years to present that new evidence '' . 
  `` double jeopardy '' or `` non bis in idem '' is not as extreme in europe as in the usa : if new evidence is found or there were procedural errors , the trial must be restarted ( with restrictions ) . 
  i do n't know the details about this case , but it 's certainly possible . 
  tectonic plates are the best approach , in my opinion : http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:tectonic_plates-fr.png, 
  it definitely was n't when they joined the eu . 
  later on they lied to get the euro faster ( when everybody else was going to ) and not look bad . 
  that was for the euro , not european union . 
  by advertising jobs on web pages ?? 
  hardly to believe , the example being the webpage commented in the article ; what is stopping british people to search in that page ? 
   190,000 spaniards left their country - over one hundred times more than the 15,000 who left the year before sure, 
  probably , just a debit card . 
  and that graph is old ( seems to be from 2010 ) and for people between 24-35, 
  more likely : if their parents did n't allow them to stay at home , then riots would happen . 
  whether a country is in recession or not depends on gdp falling , not on unemployment . 
  whatever their parents are having that day . 
  here 's a list of the special territories related to the eu : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/special_member_state_territories_and_the_european_union, 
   yet i 've never meet a tranny maybe you have . 
  they try not to be noticed , you know . 
  also works ctrl + ' + ' or ctrl + ' - ', 
  at the moment there is a time-limit for abortions - if you want to , you can abort before x week of the pregnancy without saying why - the limit depends on why you want to abort : rape and deformations have higher limits . 
  this law was set by the socialist party . 
  previously there was a law that stated you could abort if there were deformations , if you had been raped or if it was a danger to the mother . 
  this included psychological problems so practically anyone could get an abortion stating that you would have problems if you had the baby . 
  currently , the conservative party - which has a majority in the parliament - is trying to pass a new law , very similar to the old one ( although it seems that the controls on what is a danger will be higher ) . 
  note that this new law has n't been passed and , in fact , there 's a lot of opposition inside the conservative party ; something quite rare . 
  some have said that the text is still to be `` amended '' . 
  the halo is gone . 
  the edge of the lips is not pointing downwards , like in a sad smiley :( .
