  it slightly favors the most voted parties ( although this heavily depends in the number of seats in the election ) . 
  as an example you can use the one in wikipedia : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d%27hondt_method you can see how party a - the one with most votes - went from a true proportion of 3.5 seats to 4 seats . 
  party d - the one with less votes - went from 0.7 seats in true proportion to 0 seats . 
  nope , it was someone from austria . 
  a tower might not even be necessary , one guy with a radio and a phone might suffice . 
  the grand national is slightly different : there are quite high fences ( not very common in other championships ) and there are many more horse than usual . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afnpaewk4m4 some of the horses that fall down may be quite scared . 
  nope , it 's mostly spanish and mexican . 
  you can find some events in south france and other countries in latin america . 
  in portugal you also have some ( slightly different style ) . 
   in france , bullfighting is illegal . 
  not everywhere , you can find spectacles , specially in some towns in the south , such as arles . 
  back in the medieval ages , the economy of castilla ( one of the kingdoms that would become spain ) was based mostly on animal husbandry - mostly sheep - . 
  shepherds would take their herd from the north of castilla to the south and back following the most adequate climate . 
  in the xiii century , the king of castilla demanded that certain roads would always be open to shepherds and their animals . 
  those roads still exist today ... and one crosses madrid , so once year , thousands of sheep cross madrid as a symbolic gesture : http://www.starmedia.com/imagenes/2011/10/pastores-ovejas-protesta-madrid.jpg http://www.elmundo.es/madrid/2014/11/02/545629c0ca4741a8118b4577.html, 
  i hate many of those questions , for example : depending on who you ask , birds and other animals are dinosaurs so early humans definitely lived around dinosaurs . 
  we had to do stuff like this : http://www.milejemplos.com/lenguaje/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/04/sint_mod_1.jpg, 
  many banks ( supervised by the bank of england ) fixed the libor rates not so ago . 
  actually ... 
  in madrid airport crossbows are forbidden ( an example : http://www.vuelos.li/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/equipaje_mano_aeropuerto.jpg ) . 
  catapults are included sometimes . 
  a comedy monologue included it as something `` weird '' : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4lrlfyxke ( spanish only ) . 
  that makes more sense now , thanks . 
  does sweden have something like a presidential plane , or were they just using normal/chartered planes ? 
  in the first case , if the plane was in bromma from a previous - local - flight , it still would have to fly to arlanda for the international trip . 
  so no big difference in co2 consumption . 
  the italians said the same ... 
  except ceuta and melilla ... 
  we made an agreement with portugal a long time ago ; they got africa and brazil , we got the rest of america . 
  so basically we were late to the game in africa . 
  also , in the late xix century and early xx we were isolationists . 
   spain in red half of our flag is red ... 
  is n't that archaic ? 
   he = egli ( formal ) , esso ( formal not used ) , lui she = ella ( formal ) , essa ( formal not used ) , lei and in exchange you do n't have a formal `` tu '' , which we do ( usted ) . 
  if you want very formal ways to say he or her in spanish , you can use `` su merced '' , but is very archaic . 
  we also distinguish between `` pronuncia '' , which is informal and almost gone and `` pronunciaci\u00f3n '' . 
  instead of idioma/lingua we have idioma/lengua , but the common is idioma , while lengua is more formal . 
  that 's not always accurate , the beginning of scienza would be an example ; it 's pronounced in the same way than scena . 
  in these two links , under pronuncia , you can see how they are almost the same phonetically : http://it.wiktionary.org/wiki/scienza http://it.wiktionary.org/wiki/scena, 
  and this is just for the army ... 
  the navy , air force and other groups are missing ... 
   does this mean that say , a belgian of-6 would rank superior to the entire luxembourgian armed forces ? 
  if put under his command , for sure . 
  not necessarily , the spanish king is indeed `` capitan general '' of each of the branches of the armed forces , but there are a couple more `` capitanes generales '' , often just honorific . 
  the king is also `` comandante en jefe '' which means that he is over anyone else in the armed forces . 
  you can exchange spanish pesetas , but only in the spanish central bank , up to 2020 . 
  you can do it by mail if you are not living in spain ( please , remember that in some countries it is forbidden to send money by mail ) . 
  for him , or other politicians , choosing one dialect over another is not a good idea , as those who speak the other dialects would get angry because their dialect was n't the chosen one ... 
   the spanish have a foreign legion . 
  no , we do n't , it 's just a `` legion '' . 
  foreigners from certain countries can access ( mostly , spanish ex-colonies ) , but that happens with the rest of the army . 
  it is considered as elite infantry so it has a similar purpose to the french foreign legion . 
   in 1761 portugal became the first colonial power to abolish slavery only in mainland portugal and india , the trade between portuguese african colonies and brazil ( and other countries ) continued . 
  spanish public tv is not only funded directly by the government , every other tv company - and some telcos - pay money to maintain it as well ( which can be considered a tax ) . 
  honestly , deployment in a friendly country is typically not very hard ... 
  i do n't think it 's a good idea to do the maneuver the car in the second photograph is about to execute ... 
  as has been already suggested here , try hola extension . 
  bbc iplayer only requires a licence to watch it live , the program that were already broadcasted can be watched without one . 
  only if relatives . 
   local nobelty i guess you wanted to say nobility , 
  spain 's flag was chosen in the late 18th century as the naval emblem in order to differentiate it from other flags ( all based on the bourbon 's coat of arms of that time ) . 
  the modern coat of arms is the `` important '' part . 
  it shows the different kingdoms that eventually came together to form spain ( castille , aragon , navarra , leon and granada ) with the bourbon 's `` fleur de lis '' in the middle . 
  it also shows the two herculean pillars ( gibraltar strait ) and the spanish motto : `` plus ultra '' ( translated : further beyond ) . 
  this motto is derived from the common roman saying `` non plus ultra '' ( nothing further beyond ) which meant that further the strait there was no land ... which spain kinda proved wrong by discovering america ... 
  there are many big cities that are in the sea , of the ten largest metropolitan areas , 8 would be affected . 
  the affected ones are barcelona , valencia , seville - the guadalquivir valley would be flooded - , bilbao ( sestao/barakaldo ) , m\u00e1laga , gij\u00f3n , alicante and las palmas , the unaffected ones would be madrid and zaragoza . 
   spain and norway lose basically nothing if it was n't because in that `` basically nothing '' lives most of the population ... 
  we also have \u00c7 in the keyboard ( due to catalonian ) . 
  just blinds ( there are several types ) . 
  in spain they are commonplace , and are called `` persiana '' . 
  the ebro river, 
  you can compare with this one with the population desnsity : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_spain#mediaviewer/file:espdens2.jpg, 
  heh , not really , many town were already abandoned way before the europeans arrived ( cahokia and mesa verde are good examples , abandoned circa 1300 ) , while many others survived european expansion ( pueblo culture ) . 
  they are planning to offer literature , theology and philosophy . 
  i do n't think people that get into those courses seek to improve their employability . 
  heh , that 's usually how armies work , it 's a very complex organigram of units , commands , bases and whatnot that is constantly changing . 
  as an example with the portuguese army : this is the web page of the portuguese army where the composition of the high command is shown : http://www.exercito.pt/unidades/paginas/cmdexercito.aspx each of those has their own organization , for example , the logistics department 's organization is this : http://www.exercito.pt/sites/cmdlog/paginas/organizacao.aspx and these sub-organizations are usually dependent on other organizations ... and so on . 
  and do n't even start looking into the nato organization . 
   redrawing of the ** uk 's ** relationship with ** european europe ** . 
  woah ... 
  even funnier if you consider the article is denouncing the alleged use of textbooks in the creation of an european identity . 
  they cut the head and kept it , most likely to put on a wall . 
  but yes , assholes . 
  the eu also criticised the agreement between spain and morocco to send back migrants/refugees back to morocco without having to wait for identity checks and checking refugee status . 
  nowadays , the eu is doing the exact same thing with turkey . 
  the company giving the license gives you the blue prints , specifications , patents rights and so on - for a price - . 
  the company getting the license has to set up the factory and get materials ( sometimes there 's collaboration on both as well , depending on the agreement ) . 
  first one under the `` direction '' of the patriarch of the romanian church . 
  orthodox churches share the same practces , and the separation is only administrative, 
  definitely wrong , there are quite a few in madrid . 
  i also have seen a couple in the east coast . 
  perhaps first in the city ? 
  the thieves are jailed fairly often , several times each . 
  if they are minors they are released quickly , if they are not , they would just move to another city/country and start again . 
  the bracelet scammers are not doing anything illegal by putting the bracelet on your wrist , if you let them ( if you do n't and start a fight , police will intervene , if they are around ) . 
  it 's much harder to prevent than it looks . 
  those laws depend nowadays on the city halls and the comunidades . 
  and in fact the objective was not to build more houses ( not that much of a housing problem in galicia or asturias where there are more fires than anywhere else in spain ) .
