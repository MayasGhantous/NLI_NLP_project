  the eyebrows are not draw in , the black hair has undergone the same change than the normal hair but it is n't retouched any more . 
  in the image posted here it does a clear \u00f4 . 
  ( it may look like that , in the images i posted there 's an extra bit , however after looking to the original one you will see a `` colour problem '' in that area due to a shadow ) . 
  so in general this might seem to be a general `` touching-up '' , perhaps due to colour requirements during print . 
  it is a crappy job , but hardly manipulation . 
  in the retouched image posted here , she looks like as a witch , in the real photo and the one published , she is just angry . 
  edit : in any case , manipulating an image to accuse others of manipulation is ... hypocrite , at least . 
  i could n't find the manipulated photo anywhere , you can see the frontpage here : http://www.lasportadas.es/d/20140109/101/abc and here : http://kiosko.net/es/np/abc.html the halo is gone and the mouth is not touched edit : the eyebrows are n't there either , the only thing seems to be that she is paler and her eyes . 
  these things are quite likely due to a filter . 
  from where did you take the photograph ?? 
  i could n't find the original , nor the photograph distributed by efe . 
  that was in a time that purple dye was very expensive . 
  in the case of spain it was used during the ii republic because it was thought to have been the colour of a revolt against the kings some centuries earlier , although it probably was crimson . 
  in the case of spain you have to validate your degree first ( this can be done in an embassy or consulate ) and then proceed to take the normal exam that every spaniard does to access university , this exam might be done in the network of the spanish distance university ( uned ) . 
  access to certain studies depends on your grades , of your degree and the exam . 
  edit : you have consulates/embassy in san francisco , los \u00c1ngeles , houston , chicago , washington , nueva york , miami and boston . 
  you can also add the i republic flag : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_spanish_republic, 
  the purple is a symbol many would dislike , not a good idea . 
  i meant of the money i spend here ;p, 
  i did an erasmus as many people here it seems . 
  currently i work in the uk but i 'm paid by the european union ( even my salary is fixed in euros ) . 
  and btw , the uk is benefited by this too . 
  no , it 's not , titles are usually not translated or to the phonetic equivalent ( duke -  duque , count -  conde ) . 
  for example zar or shah are kept `` as is '' in english without further translation and are not called `` kings '' or `` emperors '' . 
  note that in the article they make mistakes in the translation , they call her `` princess infanta cristina '' which is wrong , no matter how you see it . 
  that 's now what i meant : we can only have one prince or princess at a time ( well , one an his/her wife/husband ) . 
  other members of the royal family are not princes or princesses . 
  not in spain , here the prince is only the heir . 
  liechtenstein is a member . 
  and switzerland follows most of the legislation as is part of the efta . 
  that 's the husband of the princess in question , basically the same case . 
  note : technically she is not a princess , in spain , only the heir gets to be `` prince '' . 
  they are quite sad , pessimistic and melancholic . 
  these traits are represented in `` fado '' the typical music style of portugal and in the word `` saudade '' which has no translation in any other language and i recommend you to look what it stands for . 
  i do n't know the word in galician , sorry . 
   a lot of conquering and re-conquering back then and sex , do n't forget the sex and kids inheriting their parents fiefdoms . 
  because it has evolved on its own ? 
  being in an island usually leads to faster evolution ( whereas we are talking about species or languages ) . 
  it was part of the kingdom of pamplona at its peak : http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:reino_de_pamplona_sancho_iii.svg but there are many other names ( towns , mountains , surnames ... ) that come from basque , basically this happened because they ( we , in some sense ) were part of the `` reconquista '' invading the south like the other people around . 
  well , to be fair there is quite some lexical similitude between basque and the other peninsular languages , specially spanish . 
  there existed ( and still exists ) and interchange of words . 
  for example the word for left : `` izquierda '' ( spanish ) , `` esquerra '' ( catalan ) , `` esquerda '' ( portuguese ) , comes from basque ( `` ezquer '' or `` ezquerra '' ) . 
  while `` airoportua '' comes from a romance language . 
  note that this map is not a `` family tree '' . 
  beside what igelkotten commented , it 's also because a month is divided better in pieces of 15 days than 14 . 
  i always considered that it meant `` the last night of the old year '' that just ended up in `` old night '' ( it makes a little bit more sense in spanish ) . 
  edit : also , the first day of the year is called `` day of new year '' so it 's quite straightforward to call the last night `` night of old year '' . 
  you also have `` good night '' ( christmas eve ) . 
  twelve grapes , each with the sound of one bell from a clock tower in madrid . 
  it takes around three seconds each . 
  it 's interesting how most of those countries see themselves as the least arrogant . 
  ( thank you italy ) . 
  well , the netherlands seems to have a big `` unclassified '' area , and i 'm guess it 's all the stuff that goes through rotterdam port to other countries . 
  rotterdam acts as a hub so you may have cargo going from china to oslo that stops there , counting as an `` export '' but it 's hard to classify . 
  edit : checking the source ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/ ) it 's divided into classified sections , the netherlands exports 12 % of oil so i think my supposition was correct . 
  this also means that the images in imgur are outdated . 
  well , as a spaniard i have felt the other way around , when girls are interested , they do n't even talk to me , on purpose , trying to appear as interesting or some bullshit . 
  in spanish he is : carlos i ( of austria ) . 
  it 's the surname of many of our old kings . 
  capital is vienna . 
  ... yeah , we do n't have international history . 
  as for asturias , the map is wrong : foro asturias is faaaar from nationalistic . 
  that is , they do n't want independence , just ask more things for asturias . 
  something similar could be said about cantabria , the party on the regional parliament is far from wanting independence . 
  i also have no clue what nominal movement there is in the castille area . 
  i am going to recommend the north coast . 
  most international tourists go to the south and east coasts . 
  those are nice but you have many places up north where a lot less people go , the weather is not as extreme as temperature is typically below 30\u00bac while in the south it 's always over that and food is probably better ( just one word : seafood ) . 
  nowadays it 's pretty easy to do it , either walking or biking . 
  of course , you have to be able to walk hundreds of kilometers . 
  i guess each would be prosecuted considering the laws on their respective side . 
  ( but sex typically follows a bottom-up approach , so be careful ) . 
  in the case of spain it actually depends on the city ( not even region ) , in some cities it is illegal to offer the services in the streets , in others only hiring them is illegal , others have n't regulated it . 
  many times it 's tolerated and only when the neighbours complain , something is done ( the prostitutes just move to somewhere else ) . 
  although brothels are forbidden everywhere , you will see many in spain 's highways , but those are hotels where happen to be a lot of prostitutes that do n't work for the hotel ( or that 's what the owners would say ) . 
  in every newspaper you will also find advertisements like `` an authentic harem for your hottest fantasies '' taken randomly from one of the most sold newspapers in madrid . 
  well , you have the coat of arms of the spanish kings : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_the_king_of_spain basically , you can try to find historical flags and coat of arms of other countries and regions and guess when the region was incorporated and why , depending on the king that has it . 
  some examples are : portugal , austria , brabant , tyrol , jerusalem , tuscany , napoli , parma , flandes , savoy ... to name just a few . 
  ceuta and melilla fences are discussed regularly ( recently about whether barbed wire should be installed or no ) . 
  instead i searched `` greece is '' and the result was :  greece is the word keeping up with the kardashians what the hell is going up ? 
  i think you should read a little bit more about the peninsular war . 
  here you have a few things about spanish participation : - `` we '' forced our kings to stay in spain ( mot\u00edn the aranjuez ) and were latter taken hostages by the french . 
  yours escaped to the americas . 
  - `` we '' started fighting the french due to an insurrection in madrid , despite out king and his family taking as hostages , `` we '' managed to form several armies . 
  these armies retook madrid , defeated the french by first time ( bail\u00e9n ) which led to the fifth coalition . 
  - `` we '' captured the remaining french fleet , stationed in cadiz after trafalgar . 
  - do you know what guerrilla means ?? 
  you should check it out . 
  - only when napoleon ( himself , not his generals ) with a quarter million soldiers entered spain , the french started to control the situation , it still would take them a lot of time , giving time to the duke of wellington to build the `` torres vedras '' forts in portugal , around lisbon . 
  at this time , nor the portuguese nor the british had fought in spain . 
  the rest of portugal fell miserably ( battle of oporto ) . 
  - after 4 years of war , napoleon decided to launch his attack in russia . 
  this is 1812 , napoleon starts to withdraw troops from the peninsula . 
  only then , the british start his attack with , according to wikipedia , `` 53,749 british , 39,608 spanish , and 27,569 portuguese '' inside spain . 
  - and no , i am not proud of that war , you should n't be proud of any war . 
  but certainly , you should n't be proud of the portuguese involvement in the war . 
  those were the british ... and they ai n't coming this time , you should pray to herr merkel . 
  the map is not irrelevant , it shows that the common law is alien to most the eu , with the sole exceptions of the uk and ireland . 
  i guess this map can tell you the answer : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:legalsystemsoftheworldmap.png and i would like to see the reaction of the uk if a judge in brussels , strasbourg or somewhere else could `` create laws '' that were binding in the uk too ... 
  ah , only a few days after she got her coalition in her country , reforms happen to be necessary again .
