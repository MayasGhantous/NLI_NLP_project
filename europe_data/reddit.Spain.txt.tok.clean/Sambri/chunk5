  and i never said we had the same culture , we are different , but comparing with other countries , we may look `` similar '' . 
  p.s : you are the one that compared spanish food with italian food ;p, 
  food/drinks ( wine over beer , similar stuff , big lunch , usually with bread ) , art ( both old and new , you would be surprised by the number of italian singers that have been in spain ) , the language , the importance of family ( and the big meetings in christmas/other celebrations ) , similar weather ( yes , north italian weather is not very far from central/north spain ) and many more ... edit : i 'm curious , why do you think we are more different than usually stated ? 
  she was from the north , i lived there too . 
  i live in madrid , and i have seen belgian , german and alsacian in supermarkets , german/english are very common in touristic areas full of ... germans/english . 
  dutch cheap ones are also common ( heineken , i have seen a couple of grolsch ) . 
  i only have seen american in dedicated stores . 
  beer culture does n't exist , we only drink beer during meals and when we go to bars ( `` irse de ca\u00f1as '' ) during the afternoon ( rarely during night , we prefer whiskey/rum/vodka / gin to get drunk ) . 
  we are more interested in what is served with the beer , you always get a free tapa . 
  note : you can search estrella damm double malta ( doble malta or voll-damm ) , it 's stronger than the normal one . 
  not much , but you can do it ( after running i go directly to my flat ) . 
  the current government , right-wing and mostly catholic , has announced a change in the abortion law though . 
  indeed , it 's some kind of shandy . 
  you might be able to find `` shandy cruzcampo '' or `` mixta '' but those are `` industrial '' and i would go with the `` homemade '' . 
  not a clue about the berliner weisse with syrup . 
  and indeed , it 's not a drink to get drunk ( we do n't drink beer for that ) , but a refreshing , cold drink . 
  now , you can think about how many people was necessary to build all that , and everything that comes with a house ( pipes , doors , house appliances ... ) and you will understand spain unemployment . 
  sure  we got rid of most double consonants : nn -  \u00f1 , mm -  nm or mn and so on . 
  only rr and ll remain , both with different sounds than r or l. 
  really ? 
  i do n't live there but i just checked schedules for alcampo and mercadona ( two big supermarkets ) and all have non-interrupted workdays . 
  do you remember the name of the supermarket ? 
   much like greeks that have they weird attitude that they are really close with italians in matter of culture and way of life , which is imo not true , and many are left deluded after living in italy for a while . 
  having dated an italian , and lived there for a short time , we do have many , many things in common . 
   there was another carthage on its eastern coast carthago nova , nowadays cartagena , annibal campaign started there . 
   housing bubble that burst to understand the extent of this , i recommend this webpage : http://www.nacionrotonda.com/ you only have to scroll the thing in the middle of the images left and right ( left -  around 10 years ago , right -  nowadays ) . 
  `` entradas antiguas '' in the bottom to see more . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joan_pujol_garcia edit : a quick glimpse ( from wikipedia ) : in 1940 , during the early days of world war ii , pujol decided that he must make a contribution `` for the good of humanity '' [ 3 ] ( and to oppose the franco regime ) by helping britain -- which , with its empire , was germany 's only adversary at the time . 
  [ 17 ] [ 23 ] he initially approached the british three different times , [ 3 ] including through his wife ( though pujol edited her participation out of his memoirs ) , [ 17 ] but they showed no interest in employing him as a spy . 
  therefore , he resolved to establish himself as a german agent before approaching the british again to offer his services as a double-agent . 
  [ 17 ] pujol created an identity as a fanatically pro-nazi spanish government official who could travel to london on official business ; [ 3 ] he also had created for himself a fake spanish diplomatic passport via fooling a printer into thinking pujol worked for the spanish embassy in lisbon . 
  [ 26 ] he contacted friedrich knappe-ratey , a german intelligence agent in madrid codenamed `` frederico '' , [ 27 ] and german intelligence accepted him and gave him a crash course in espionage , including secret writing , a bottle of invisible ink , a codebook and 600 pounds for expenses . 
  his instructions were to recruit a network of british agents . 
  [ 3 ] he moved instead to lisbon , and -- using a tourist 's guide to england , reference books and magazines from the lisbon public library and newsreel reports he saw in cinemas -- created seemingly credible reports that appeared to come from london . 
  [ 3 ] he claimed to be travelling around britain and submitted his travel expenses based on fares listed in a british railway guide . 
  a slight difficulty was that he did not understand the pre-decimal system of currency used in britain , [ 28 ] expressed in pounds , shillings and pence , and was unable to total his expenses . 
  instead , he simply itemised them , and said he would send the total later . 
  that would be [ fideua ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=fideua&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=v6z3upmldqep0awdoocida&amp;ved=0cakq_auoaq&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=675 ), 
  congratulations , you have found the best ones . 
  being from a hot country i would recommend you a `` clara '' , that is , beer mixed with `` gaseosa '' ( carbonated water ) or lemon fanta ( yes , we have that flavour ) . 
  em , i usually run in the street with sport clothes , and many people do . 
  when i go to the gym i go on the sport clothes , but i usually come back with normal clothes ; after the shower you do n't want to wear your old , wet clothes . 
  1492 : not only the americas were discovered and the expulsion of the jews , the first [ spanish grammar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gram%c3%a1tica_de_la_lengua_castellana ) was published , in fact , the first grammar of an european language beside latin/greek . 
  basically , once the agreement is signed and implemented , there wo n't be customs between the eu ( and a few other countries : norway , switzerland , iceland ) and canada . 
  important detail : a few products will have taxes , albeit lower , such as dairy products , cow and pig meat and spirits . 
  there are a few more details such as canada accepting patents/branding laws from the eu . 
  for example , champagne can only be advertised , in the eu , as such if the grapes come from the region of champagne in france . 
  from now on , anything sold as champagne in canada will have to follow the same rule . 
  i have seen a `` salsa sauce '' in more than one mexican around europe , i did n't dare to ask for it . 
  not only the old aragonese kingdom is `` related '' to italy , andalusia ( specially with south italy ) and central spain have more in common with italy than portugal . 
  many artists from spain spent a lot of time in italy ( vel\u00e1zquez , goya and cervantes , for example ) . 
  this led to a bigger cultural exchange with italy , not portugal . 
  food is also more similar in italy ( except for pasta ) ; the same with weather ( portugal is an atlantic country , not mediterranean ) . 
  i doubt that any museum opens at 10 pm thus i would say just 10/11 ( diez/once ), 
  the sentences of fissileport1 are impersonal , you are saying that visiting the cathedral is obligatory . 
  that will depend on the specific noble . 
  in any case they probably will say something in very formal situations and in those cases they have specific treatments . 
  the king , for example is `` su majestad '' , the rest of the royal family `` su alteza real '' , the `` grandes de espa\u00f1a '' ( maximum nobiliary title ) `` excelent\u00edsimos se\u00f1ores '' and so on . 
  french is the language that has changed more in pronunciation , you should try spanish or italian . 
  note : it 's quite probable that you can use the phrases given in portuguese and italian for spanish speaking people . 
  in spain some people can feel uncomfortable if addressed with `` usted '' , specially girls/ladies . 
  in america , in spanish speaking countries the situation is the opposite : `` t\u00fa '' is n't used . 
  on the other hand , impersonal sentences avoid this and sentences in plural ( `` you '' is different in singular/plural in spanish ) so i would recommend the sentence of fissileport1 . 
  you 're not the only one ... 
  well , you must understand that with the current schedule we would be working 6 hours working before lunch . 
  if you do that your productivity is going to go down in the last hours ( and you feel tired after 4 hours which is one the first break usually takes place ) . 
  my point is that our lunches are pretty much at the same `` solar '' time than the rest of europe , but the time we start is not ( it 's the same `` clock '' time than the rest of central europe ) . 
  then your employer usually demands you to stay one or two hours more after the `` official '' end of your work time . 
  all this results in two 5-6 hours chunks ... 
  so the breaks start . 
  at the end we work 4 chunks of around 2-2 .5 hours so we work the same as you do , but we stay a couple more hours in the workplace . 
  nope , actually lunch usually starts between 14:00 and 15:00 which after reducing one hour ( difference of solar time with germany ) results in 13:00 or 14:00 which is rather close to the lunch time in germany . 
  changing time is stupid : the time in your clock is just a label , i already gave this example in / r/europe : let 's imagine we turn crazy and decide to change time ( forward or backward ) 12 hours ... we would keep doing everything at the same time , but instead of am , pm and vice-versa . 
  now , it is true that there is a problem in spain : we stay in the workplace between 10-12 hours ( in the case of 12 hours it 's usually unpaid overtime ) , including a break for lunch of 1.5 / 2 hours and probably one or two small breaks for coffee . 
  considering the breaks we end up working less than those who work 8 hours plus half hour for lunch . 
  how to solve this ?? 
  as the example with iberdrola : go for 8 hours shifts . 
  this can be achieved reducing the lunch break ( 45 minutes-1 hour ) , starting later ( it does n't make sense that we start working at 8/9 am , the same time the germans/finns do ) and not working overtime ( in those jobs where this happens ) . 
   pretty much everyone knew greece/spain had cooked their books to get into the eu . 
  greece recognised , but , could you give a citation about spain ? 
  rowers were slaves , in part from those areas , once a galley was defeated those slaves/servants/prisoners would change hands . 
  well , most slaves/servants in spain came from the battles between barbary and spanish galleys , the winner would take the survivors as slaves or asked for a ransom ( miguel de cervantes , for example ) . 
  black slaves that the barbarian pirates took from southern parts of africa ( used mainly as rowers ) changed hands and were sold in spain ( spain , due its treaties with portugal , could not go to africa for slaves ) . 
  and i feel outraged because sinterklaas takes bad kids back to spain !, 
  or at least change it to italy , as bari is not in spain anymore ... or you could stop thinking about these stupid things and just carry on ... 
  the law did n't ( and does n't ) state how the time reductions must be applied . 
   tried to apply that law retroactively technically it is not a law ( no law states if time reductions are applied on the total sentence or on the 30 years ) , it was an administrative change . 
   in sweden that only applies to citizens . 
  perhaps residents before application ? 
  you will have tuition fees as anyone from germany would , i had a friend who was also german but had lived since he was born in the usa . 
  we were both studying in the netherlands , he was paying the same as the locals ( masters degree ) which was pretty much nothing compared to what he would have payed in the usa . 
  prices in general are low since you are an eu citizen but will vary depending on the country , or even region ( for example scotland is free , germany depends on the l\u00e4nder and so on ) . 
  you should take more into consideration the cost of living . 
  some countries may also demand you to have a enough money to survive , at least one year , before arrival . 
  you can easily find masters programs taught in english and you might find many bachelor programs as well , but this will depend heavily on the country and what you want to study . 
  every country in the eu has a nice list of universities on wikipedia so i would start looking there , you can pick a few and visit their `` international '' section on their webpage . 
   each ticket costs 20 $ . 
  you can buy smaller parts ... 
  the same , but it became something unimaginable around ten years ago , you can check this page if you want : http://www.nacionrotonda.com/ it shows many villages and cities 10 years ago/now . 
  that study , that the telegraph recently talked about , includes that number , but it is the number of `` non active '' , not unemployed .
