  * nuclear fusion , not cold fusion . 
  cold fusion is impossible , hot fusion is actively being worked on . 
  looks about right . 
  no , we need them as trading partners , but not as members of the union . 
  the uk has been an obstruction more than a benefit to the eu . 
  pretty much every eu regulation had an asterisk just for the uk . 
  given that we do n't fight the f-35 , f-22 or su-50 ... no , they usually wo n't . 
  how about no ? 
  ... but why ? 
  it 's aimed specifically and explicitly against men , implying that only men take up too much space . 
  that is discriminatory by definition . 
  are you familiar with the concepts of actus reus and mens rea ? 
  they translate into `` guilty act '' and `` guilty mind '' , and they are used in justice to aid in discerning the severity of a crime . 
  i think those can be extended to situations like these . 
  are they telling people to take up less space , or are they telling men to stop manspreading ? 
  clearly the latter , otherwise it might include a picture for bag-spreading , and they would n't call it manspreading . 
  their [ official statement ] ( http://www.emtmadrid.es/noticias/emt-amplia-su-senalizacion-a-bordo-del-autobus-par.aspx ) , however , * does * . 
  in english :  the municipal transport company ( emt ) is going to incorporate a specific pictogram against ` manspreading ( an english term denominating the posture of men opening their legs excessively when they sit , occupying the seats adjacent to those they are sitting on ) into their user information on their fleet of buses . 
  you were saying ? 
  i 'm going to continue bitching about this discriminatory practice until they at the very least add one for women spreading their bags all over the place . 
  furthermore , i did n't mention feminazis , much less feminists or feminism . 
  time was wasted on a non-issue . 
  `` manspreading '' is n't a thing . 
  taking up too much space is a genderless problem . 
  ... but it is n't . 
  their birthrates are in free-fall . 
  falsely label it as a problem , and then purport that it 's only done by men ( hence `` manspreading '' ) . 
  it 's about as much of a problem as chemtrails and cia mind control beams . 
  ** people ** taking up too much space is a problem , when there is n't much space left . 
  ** men ** sitting with their legs open , not so much , especially since many ca n't help it . 
  i ca n't sit with my legs together , for example . 
  i see at least as many women spreading their bags all over the fucking place . 
  but it is n't a problem , that 's the thing . 
  itt : people unironically using the term `` mansplain '' . 
  how has it gone too far ? 
  i propose we print out stickers against `` femspreading '' , with a woman taking up 2 seats with her bags . 
  how dare we sit comfortably , right ? 
  the majority of europeans speak english to varying degrees anyway , i see now reason why i should n't be our `` official '' language . 
  here in spain we seem to have a raging hardon for corrupt politicians . 
  i do n't think they 're defending marriage per se , i 'm certainly not , but rather the equality of marriage . 
  `` heteros get to marry , so why do n't we ? '', 
  i agree that marriage should be replaced with something else . 
  i 'm not saying polygamy is wrong , either , only that i wo n't engage in it . 
  no , it really is n't . 
  it varies from person to person . 
  i would n't date someone who wants to have an open relationship . 
  yes , they are . 
  coal subsidies are ending next year , after which hard coal mining is expected to mostly stop . 
  most new power is renewable as far as i know . 
  germany is phasing out their coal power plants . 
  thanks , i know about the link formating , i did n't think it was needed in this case though :p, 
  well shit , i was some ways off . 
  yeah , but you can research it . 
  the delta 4 heavy costs 435 million dollars a launch , while if i 'm not mistaken an ariane 5 costs about 300 total . 
  it was meant to launch the hermes : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hermes_ ( spacecraft ), 
  * politician , not politicians . 
  as far as i 'm aware , that was one incident , not a common theme . 
  i was in cologne in 2013 , attending gamescom . 
  that thing is bloody massive , you really ca n't appreciate the size of it until you are standing in front of it .

  sargon , vee , kraut and tea ... is wizard of cause actually european ? 
  i think he 's british , but i 'm not sure . 
  jonathan pie , definitely too . 
  does cgp grey count ? 
  he 's american , but lives in the uk . 
  i do n't always agree with them , in fact i disagree with a lot of what they say on quite a few issues , but i do n't watch them to agree with them , but to hear their arguments . 
  i do n't watch any `` main stream '' left or right wing youtubers , to be honest , because they usually go too far to either side for my liking . 
  is this guy fucking mental ? 
  i do n't know what kind of drugs he 's on , but it must be some good shit . 
  i want some . 
  http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-10-03-blogbellcurve.png a way to represent distribution of characteristics in a sample size , with most people falling near the middle of the bell curve . 
  the bell curve can have different shapes based on distribution , a flatter bell curve means that there is more variation within the sample size , such as iq distribution in males and females , where males have a flatter bell curve and as a result , there are simultaneously more male geniuses and complete dumbasses than female ones , or in this case , beauty . 
  there seem to be more ugly and pretty people in western countries , but that 's purely my subjective experience . 
  yes , i 'm sure a capitalist enterprise is implementing communism . 
  much logic , such intellectualism , so edgy , wow . 
  the eu is n't multiculturalist , it 's pluralist . 
  as for globalization : do you think our little 20-million-inhabitant nations are going to have any power on the international stage on their own ? 
  i do n't . 
  a 500-million strong union in turn , has quite a bit more power . 
  democratic values are n't christian at all . 
  the romans and greeks came up with those before they even knew what christianity was . 
  thanks to the good old bell curve , we have both the prettiest and ugliest women and men around in germany . 
  it 's likely using the marxist definition of socialism , where it 's the stepping-stone towards communism . 
  social democracy is what we have in most places , not socialism . 
   socialism  ( in marxist theory ) a transitional social state between the overthrow of capitalism and the realization of communism . 
  the netherlands do n't have a shortage of food as far as i 'm aware . 
  flowers however , are a pretty big export market for them . 
  `` you '' , did you just assume my religion ? 
  :p i 'm not a christian . 
  i 'm not religious at all , actually . 
  by that i mean , it 's entirely legal to discriminate against homosexuals . 
  that 's illegal in most western countries . 
  over 90 % of muslims in the arab world are anti-homosexual , i do n't think it 's unfair to describe that part of the world as extremely homophobic . 
  and it most certainly has to do with islam , primarily with islamic culture . 
  muslims who grew up in the west are a lot more tolerant .
