  if this were to pass , would this affect the uk until it triggers article 50 , or will it continue to affect the uk after they do so , during the withdrawal process that is estimate to take two years ? 
  this is just bull shit , the uk wants out but still the benefits of being an eu citizen . 
  make up your damn mind . 
  the uk should at least offer a fast track or similar offer for eu citizens in the uk, 
  i would welcome that with open arms . 
  i ca n't live without fuet . 
  i get what it represents and what it 's trying to say but i think it 's stupid . 
  the stars do n't even represent the member states . 
  this would make more sense if they did tho . 
  i really hope they never do, 
  no point . 
  just a spelling correction . 
   teached taught *, 
  germany and the uk, 
  * slow clap *, 
  i would like it if spain became a republic . 
  hopefully we get a 3rd one . 
  i looooovvvveeeeeee both, 
  no , i 'm from madrid . 
  just spell it like that out of respect for the local language and the history . 
  it 's a recognized regional language , so might as well spell it in its original form . 
  idk it feels weird to me to spell it as catalu\u00f1a even though it is the correct way to spell it in castilian . 
  also , you got a good eye lol . 
  spanish , english , and i can understand 70-85 % portuguese in written form . 
  what games do you play ? 
  aww :( cool username !, 
  i think it 's a beautiful name . 
  i like bravas as well , but ... do you like [ pictures ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/patatas_bravas_madrid.jpg ) of patatas bravas ? 
  i guess depending on where you go , but bullfighting . 
  thankfully we are making progress and there are more sensible places such as catalunya , canarias , as well as provinces in places such as galicia where it is either prohibited or there are heavy restrictions . 
  there are numerous provinces where progress is being made as well , but it is still declared ` bien de inter\u00e9s cultural o patrimonio cultural inmaterial '' in numerous regions where this practice is more ingrained in their culture or traditions . 
  spain --  us ( minnesota ) --  us ( california ) --  mexico --  us ( florida ), 
  football, 
  toni kroos and luka modri\u0107 , they make an excellent pair on real madrid . 
  as for people not affiliated with that team i 'd say philipp lahm , antoine griezmann , steven gerrard , edwin van der sar , eden hazard , and i 'll also add david luiz even though he is n't european . 
  i love fideu\u00e0 . 
  my grandfather made the best before he passed :(, 
  lived in mexico and us . 
  currently been in the us 5 years . 
  [ i guess it 's ok , could have been better ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jo32_trjq4 ), 
  stay . 
  we have the same exact thing . 
  they are delicious . 
  not really , i feel no connection to the umayyad caliphate . 
  this is true . 
  whenever i get to read anything in portuguese i can understand almost all of it , but when i hear someone talk in portuguese it sounds like the russian and spanish languages had a baby . 
  although , i find the portuguese spoken in brazil way more intelligible than portuguese spoken in portugal . 
  portuguese in brazil just sounds softer . 
  for example : the sentence '' i like to go to the market every saturday '' in portuguese and spanish spanish - me gusta ir al mercado todos los sabados portugese - eu gosto de ir para o mercado todos os s\u00e1bados ( off of google translate ) accents : [ brazil ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zanh1ik9iwa ) | [ portugal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkmf4rqszqi ) also , i 'm curious to know if any portuguese speakers find that it is easier to understand spanish depending on the accent . 
  have you been to novgorod and/or kaliningrad ? 
  if so , did you like them ? 
  - mercadona - carrefour - auchan ( known as alcampo ) - lidl - dia - eroski, 
  done with he survey , looking forward to the responses . 
  latin americans, 
  change up the letter positioning and you get [ murcia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murcia ), 
  malaga - great food , nice city , cool beach,

  south : oaxaca , mexico north : edinburgh , scotland east : berlin , germany west : san francisco , california highest : mexico city , mexico lowest : amsterdam , the netherlands, 
   so most people do n't have really much contact with africans . 
  first time i saw an african i was around two or three in the madrid metro with my mom . 
  not my proudest moment . 
  my mother rushed to tell me to be quiet, 
  i honestly do n't know if this is a troll or not . 
  you just sound ludicrous . 
  i get that you have valid concerns , but you are exaggerating everything way out of proportion . 
  the united states is a first world country and it 's citizens do not need any sort of asylum . 
  syrian refugees * need * asylum , they are being killed left and right , either by their own government or by extremists . 
  you are probably just scared for trump , i am too , but you * do n't * need asylum . 
  if you feel you are being discriminated against , this is a reality , but it would be easier to move to a different , more liberal state than to europe . 
  if you wish to come to europe , i suggest getting a job here . 
  i 'm assuming by your comments you are a minority in the united states . 
  if you happen to be latino/a and can claim citizenship from one of those countries it might ( ? ), 
  make it easier to come to spain to work as you may know spanish and english , but i would n't really know . 
  if you are actually serious about asylum [ scroll down to art\u00edculo 7 . 
  motivos de persecuci\u00f3n in the ley 12/2009 , de 30 de octubre ] ( http://www.interior.gob.es/web/servicios-al-ciudadano/normativa/leyes-ordinarias/ley-12-2009-de-30-de-octubre ) [ here is a quick english rundown ] ( http://ciutatrefugi.barcelona/en/international-protection-and-asylum-seeking-spain ) but again , you do n't meet any of these as no one is really being persecuted . 
  you claim  the usa has daily mass shootings , the kkk , trump , police shootings , no healthcare , no drinkable water , if i do n't get asylum i will die like the millions of other americans who die every year . 
  first off , the kkk has a very very small presence in the united state . 
  [ the anti-defamation league estimates kkk membership at 3,000 people nationwide , while the southern poverty law center puts the number between 5,000 and 8,000 . 
  ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/the-kkk-today/3/ ) now a days all they mostly do is hold rallies and spout their bullshit to other members . 
  they for the most part do not engage in violence , but more so hate speech . 
  this does not constitute persecution . 
  there are extremists like these in europe too , and i am in no way defending the klan . 
  second , donald trump has been elected by the people of the united states ( even though not by a popular vote , but hey , its your system ) and he has said some really awful shit . 
  some of what he has said is unconstitutional and can not even pass . 
  he has not done anything wrong * yet * and even if he does pass some conservative laws regarding education or religion or sexuality , it would n't constitute persecution . 
  the united states can not pass a law to suddenly restrict people of things such as public services and other things because of their race , religion , sexual orientation , nationality , etc. 
  even if some questionable laws are passed , you better believe they will be challenged in the courts . 
  liberals will not be put in jails , and gays will not be given therapy . 
  just chill out . 
  regarding police shootings , it is clear that some or a lot have been perpetrated towards african americans and other minorities . 
  genocide against minorities is n't and will not happen , and most police violence happens in places with high violence and crime rates and people are often wrongly victimized but again , this is not grounds for asylum . 
  i feel that the united states also does a very bad job dealing with drugs , rather than treating addiction like an illness they treat it like a crime . 
  many people are being incarcerated and it is also unjust . 
  you 've also said you want to move to a place that has drugs legalized , but in europe drugs are not legalized , they are * decriminalized * and only in a few countries . 
  healthcare is a problem as well but it is nowhere near in a situation like it is in countries such as syria . 
  you do not need asylum . 
  you and millions of others americans will not die , you make it sound like a second holocaust is happening .
