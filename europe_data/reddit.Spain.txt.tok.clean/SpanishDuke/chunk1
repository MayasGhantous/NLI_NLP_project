that 's the best thing anyone has ever said about my country . 
  you 're going to make me cry , viktor . 
  good point . 
  why even live, 
   you do n't stop being a refugee just because you are safe . 
  but you stop getting free transportation , food , shelter and welfare . 
  that 's the main point of refugees - they 're supposed to be fleeing from a war , not seeking economic asylum . 
  well , clearly it 's the same language so there 's not a complete stucture change , but you 've got a change in the pronoun , the verb and the noun . 
  turkey is not at war . 
  of course neither socialism or communism is in their program . 
  because othewise no one would vote for them . 
  but all their leaders are either socialist or communist in one way or another . 
  lol . 
  portugal is 300 years older than spain . 
  it was n't ` part of spain ' , it just happened to be ruled by the same king for some years . 
  huh , what ? 
  you do n't consider podemos far-left ? 
  til worker ownership of the means of production and affirmative action is right wing . 
  the overton window is sooo crazily at the left in spain . 
  / r/atheism [ is that way pal . 
  i 'll paraphrase blas de lezo 's ( arguably the best spanish commander ) last words :  dile a mi mujer que la amo , y que mor\u00ed como un verdadero vasco : en el fragor de la batalla , defendiendo a espa\u00f1a y al imperio . 
  =  tell my wife that i love her , and that i died like a true basque : in the middle of the fight , defending spain and the empire . 
  to non-europeans : 400.000 = 400,000 in non-freedom numbers . 
  the airport of ciudad real was built by the psoe aka socialist party . 
  you might be thinking of the one in castell\u00f3n , another major fuckup , this time by the pp . 
  long live democracy , right ? 
  yeah yeah , i assume it was a joke . 
  this dark , savage , muslim macedonia is nothing compared to the ancient , pure caucasian thracians that conquered asia , though ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  . ^ ^ ^ today-macedonia ^ ^ ^ is n't ^ ^ ^ located ^ ^ ^ where ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ actual ^ ^ ^ macedonian ^ ^ ^ kingdom ^ ^ ^ was , ^ ^ ^ though, 
  interesting . 
  thanks for the serious response . 
  i mean no offense . 
  i saw the brown-tanned , single-eyebrowed lad at the left of the picture , and he inmediatly reminded me of indians . 
  they ... 
  they do look indian ... 
  ahh , one of the wonderful deeds of the socialist party . 
  build useless airport for 450 million 2 . 
  nobody uses it . 
  fucking obviously ; it 's the same distance ciudad real - its airport as ciudad real - madrid airport . 
  sell it for 10k 4 . 
  some more beauties of this new law : * police are allowed to perform checks based on race or appearance , and they can ask to identify anyone covering a part of his / her face * web pages distributing `` illegal '' content , such as movies protected by `` intellectual property '' , will be actively prosecuted and banned . 
  you 'll be jailed if : * you criticise the government , security forces or the spanish monarchy . 
  * you defend terrorism on the internet you 'll have to pay a 600 euro fine if you * show disrespect of the authority you 'll have to pay a 30,000 euro fine if : * you `` protest spontaneously '' ( not clearly defined , could be three or three hundred people ) in front of a public building and much more . 
  if you can read spanish , the full text of this master work is [ here ] ( http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2015/03/31/pdfs/boe-a-2015-3442.pdf ), 
  dude just show up there if you ca n't sleep :p i was at the demonstration just a few hours ago , there 's a sentada silenciosa ( dunno how to say that in english ) in front of the congress building starting at midnight indeed . 
  y' all know he is against same-sex marriage , right ? 
  rivera is a liberal ( in the european sense of the word ) . 
  if the party proposed exclusively what he wanted , we would see a tax cut and a decrease in government spending , as well as more open borders both physically and economically . 
  he is post-nationalist , which means he seeks a loss of national sovereignity in favour of more cooperation towards europe . 
  do you know the political orientation of franco 's falange ? 
  well , basically the opposite : protectionism , massive government spending and intervention , closed borders , restrictred trade ... 
  holy fuck why the hell are they downvoting you ?!, 
  honestly , browsing / r/europe can be as frustrating as / r/politics sometimes ... 
  i honestly do n't know why you 're being downvoted ... 
  it is known . 
  * mira me cag\u00fcen la hostia dejad de hablar kraut volveos a vuestra cueva a rezarle a un altar con hitler y goebbels * cheers , my fellow germanic friend . 
  right , i know that , i live in madrid . 
  still , i think that propaganda youtube video against ciudadanos may have had something to do . 
  i know quite a lot of young people who do n't like c 's simply because of that video . 
  so why do you think they failed ? 
  i was hoping for bigger results ... 
  there 's a new , small party called vox . 
  they believe in a market economy and strong traditional values . 
  unlike the pp , they ` proudly ' call themselves right wing . 
  i guess you could say they 're the spanish equivalent of the republicans , although much smaller . 
  you mean centre-left , right ? 
   ciudadanos is not right wing in the traditional sense , we could say . 
  the only right wing thing they 've got is they firmly oppose separatist movements . 
  perhaps you could consider that they 're somewhat liberal , though . 
  as a non-leftist , i 'm certainly quite annoyed by the results . 
  the people have spoken , though , and i wish to congratulate the winning parties . 
  what an epic name, 
  well duh , you guys have always been more civilized than my fellows in madrid . 
   ciudadanos is gon na make the headlines tomorrow . 
  hopefully . 
  if you asked this in / r/askreddit you would get 10000 different ways to kill hitler . 
  that 's why i like this subreddit - variety and creativity . 
  exactly , that 's why our friend here / u/aunvilgod is going to tell them about it . 
  / r/europeanfederalists united states of europe when, 
  why not ? 
  may god have mercy . 
  rekt, 
  all eastern europeans are based . 
  italians are ok , portuguese are meh , greeks are ugh . 
  jk i love you all, 
  can confirm , galicians are very * dereita dura * , and traditional . 
  what 's wrong with any of that ? 
  euskadi if my favourite place in spain ( coming from someone who was born and raised in madrid ) . 
  it would be sad to see you guys go , but at least keep your traditions !, 
  [ very patriotic , anti-nationalist . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/traditionalist_conservatism#patriotism.2c_localism.2c_and_regionalism ), 
  you do n't need many shells to blow up a tiny hut like in op 's picture though lol, 
  guerra guerras, 
  really ? 
  not according to this thread lol, 
  not 100 % certain , but i have a good friend who is one of the leaders of podemos , and he told me they are n't going to form coalition with anyone for the moment . 
  so another election is very likely . 
  for a lot of fiscally conservative people like me , pp is the least shitty option . 
  i voted c 's though . 
  i know reddit is liberal ( american sense ) , but y' all have to understand conservative / classical liberal views .
