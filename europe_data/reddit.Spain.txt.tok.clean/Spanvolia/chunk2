  i do n't know , if spain is out of a competition , i immediately go with the next european country . 
  little gestures like this help a lot with the creation of an european identity . 
  there 's no need for a desintegration of spain . 
  we just need to work on a framework in which portugal could keep its autonomy . 
  apart from that , the autonomous communities of spain exercise a lot of self-government , and very often their interests are n't the same . 
  madrid train bombings ( 192 deaths and +2000 injured ) happened in 2004 , so even earlier than that . 
  we had one in 1985 too : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_el_descanso_bombing ( the bomb killed 18 this time ) . 
  the biggest a que no hay huevos ( no balls ) i 've ever seen . 
  i mean ... you have a point . 
  vive la france !, 
  nice match , france . 
  now go , hermanos , do it for iberia !, 
  and the english armada : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english_armada, 
  it 's normal for a new democracy to take funcionaries or individuals that were affine to the former regime . 
  you ca n't exclude all of them from social life . 
  and i thought it was well known that a lot of officials and funcionaries from the nazi germany were in the electoral lists or reelected ( http://m.spiegel.de/international/germany/a-810207.html ) . 
  literally , `` a total of 25 cabinet ministers , one president and one chancellor of the federal republic of germany [ ... ] had been members of nazi organizations . '', 
  but this fact does n't make germany a nazi state . 
  as for the king , and being myself a convinced republican , i agree partially . 
  juan carlos was chosen by franco to be the head of the state , that 's true , but i 'm pretty sure he ( franco ) was n't thinking in a democracy when he did that move . 
  for other part , the king played his cards well . 
  he knew a dictatorship with him as head of the state was impossible , so he went for the only option available . 
  but again : that does n't make us a fascist state . 
  if we genuinely want a republic , we 're going to have a republic . 
  it can change because we 're a democracy . 
  sadly , the thing is pretty even right now . 
  spain is not a fascist state anymore . 
  you can say what you 're saying without lying , or without using hyperbole . 
  a lot of spaniards will agree with you then , but do n't insult all of us . 
  i do n't think so . 
  the full development of one 's nature ends up indeed with everyone doing * whatever * they * want * . 
  he did in the german ideology : ' [ ... ] while in communist society , where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes , society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow , to hunt in the morning , fish in the afternoon , rear cattle in the evening , criticise after dinner , just as i have a mind , without ever becoming hunter , fisherman , herdsman or critic . 
  this fixation of social activity , this consolidation of what we ourselves produce into an objective power above us , growing out of our control , thwarting our expectations , bringing to naught our calculations , is one of the chief factors in historical development up till now . ', 
  pure nonsense , as you can see . 
  there 's certainly a link : `` the purposeless massacres perpetrated since the june and october events , the tedious offering of sacrifices since february and march , the very cannibalism of the counterrevolution will convince the nations that there is only one way in which the murderous death agonies of the old society and the bloody birth throes of the new society can be shortened , simplified and concentrated , and that way is revolutionary terror . '', 
  136 , november 1848 . 
  in his early writings he was all for revolutionary force , like blanquists . 
  later , he changed his views a bit : `` we are aware of the importance that must be accorded to the institutions , customs , and traditions of different countries ; and we do not deny that there are countries like america , england ( and , if i knew your institutions better , i would add holland ) where the workers can achieve their aims by peaceful means . 
  however true that may be , we ought also to recognise that , in most of the countries on the continent , it is force that must be the lever of our revolutions ; it is to force that it will be necessary to appeal for a time in order to establish the reign of labour '' . 
  so we have a first marx that promoted old good terrorism , like the french terror ; and a second marx who thought that maybe violence could be avoided in democratic societies . 
  not the kind of thinking you want to promote , i believe . 
  i was searching for france during the terror . 
  maybe we still lack data from that stage . 
  very interesting , nonetheless . 
  once a notable and important city of castile , now the city of moya rests on a hill of 1.155 meters of altitude , ready to be swallowed by history , and maybe forgotten . 
  i tried to translate the video ( most of it ) : moya does n't breath anymore : it 's an ilustre cadaver situated in its own burial mound , a hill near teruel . 
  moya has a double arab wall , escalated back in his day by the christian knight \u00c1lvaro das mari\u00f1a , who nailed two daggers between its ashlars to do so . 
  moya was the head of a marquessate of more than thirty towns . 
  moya had in its good times seven churches and a hospital , along a castle and a collegiate chruch , and near the skirt of its hillock , a poor neightbourhood called ` el arrabal ' . 
  there 's still life in el arrabal : a few people ( around 160 ) that , when they die , go to moya to be buried in the ruins of an old monastery . 
  [ here 's the gallery with pictures . ], 
  not true . 
  spain 's position , once again , is ` we wo n't veto scotland if they get its independence legally ' , so the point is not secession , but legality . 
  you mean santander , surely . 
  it was a war against habsburg dominance , and rightly so . 
  castile also fought for the independence ( to protect the cortes and defend juana la loca as queen , mostly ) of its kingdoms a hundred years before , the difference being that castile lost . 
  it had more than a geographical meaning attached to it . 
  there was a sentiment of fraternalism , despite the difference in language , laws or kings . 
  what 's the reason behind those colors ? 
  it looks nice , although i do n't like the image of the peninsula there . 
  in medieval times until almost the emergence t of national states , iberian kingdoms were known as ` las espanas ' . 
  i did n't see it at first !, 
  what a weird place for a flag , indeed lol, 
  fyi : cuatro torres means ` four towers ' , so this picture represents 75 % of our skyline ! ^ sorry ^ torres ^ kio, 
  original picture by / u/pablojir1989 . 
  with that silogistic and solipsist reasoning every crime can be exonerated . 
  it 's like when a journalist asked a member of eta if he knew that he killed his rescuer ( when he was a few months old , he was almost killed with his mother and his brother , both of them died ) . 
  his response : ` it was my historical duty towards the basque people . ', 
  and somehow this clueless statement has resonance in some people . 
  ram\u00f3n baglietto was the victim , if someone is interested . 
  his crime towards the basque people : he was a member of ucd , a democratic party . 
  eu , us , uk and canada , i think . 
  all the western world , basically . 
  scots must be pretty small . 
  ` on the morning of sunday , april 2 , jos\u00e9 antonio arrabal sips the contents of two small bottles of medication through a straw . 
  `` it 's horrible , '' he says with a grimace , speaking to the camera . 
  the 58-year-old former electrician has been planning this moment for months , from the moment that the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) he was diagnosed with in august 2015 began to take its toll . 
  he has decided to film his final moments , and within a few seconds he will have ended his life . ', 
  you can see part of the video [ here ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2017/04/06/actualidad/1491501768_688810.html ) ( in spanish ) . 
  i thought it was around 7 million . 
  what a hit it was , indeed . 
  i 'm glad its population is recovering . 
  but you 're comparing north of ireland too ? 
  because that 6,53 millions figure seems to be for the whole island , while this one ( 4,6 millions ) is only for the republic . 
  why the downvote ? 
  lol, 
  we share a common culture and a common lifestyle , which is far more important . 
  and from where does that difference come from ? 
  what jobs , circumstances , whatever ? 
  we did two or three different iq test in psychology , iirc . 
  what i remember clearly is what that psychology teacher told us : askezan\u00ed jews ( sorry , do n't remember how to spell it in english ) are far superior than us ( average ) . 
  literally . 
  and then he said south asians were also better . 
  china , japan and south korea beat all of us , i 'm afraid . 
  that wo n't stop the ` my dick is bigger ' contest . 
  although i 'm curious about albania and what environmental circumstances have lead to that result . 
  do n't bother , he 's a known supremacist . 
  if it was for him , all south europeans should be gone . 
  the point is : the ** new ** eurostat from 2017 ** changes ** the projections for spain . 
  key words : new and changes .
