  come on , you are from a superior race , you should know better . 
  ** ' the rest are boutades from right-wingers . 
  do n't try to impose your cognitive dissonance onto the reality , it does n't work . 
  that data is already represented in my post : it 's the red line , and from 2016 , not from 2014 . 
  are you that dim ? 
  yeah , all the data you have presented neglecting the new data from eurostat is killing me . 
   it 's a perpetually declining and aging population . 
   your average age will rise until you fully disappear from the earth without changes . 
  you are that sick dude defender of the superiority of the northerners , now i remember . 
  with just a look at his historial you can see where he 's coming from : ` spain is going to collapse in the next 18 months and it 's going to be spectacular . ', 
  what an ass . 
  it will , according to eurostat , althought the population older than 65 will be still more than  20-25 % . 
  the hard part is going to come by 2050 . 
  i do n't know how to post gifs here , but the statistic is pretty clear in that regard . 
   using force against their own population is not an option in a modern democracy and eu member , as much as they 'd love to . 
  nice one . 
  i do n't truly know . 
  and i agree , i see them more as tendencies . 
  but in this case the difference was so high i got curious . 
  yes , but after our baby boomers die ( after 2070 or so ) it will stabilize . 
  none of them . 
  comparative made by clara gonz\u00e1lez , spanish economist . 
  if we take into account the ine ( instituto nacional de estad\u00edstica , a spanish organism ) our population is going to fall by 11,6 % in 50 years . 
  however , the last eurostat suggests that spain will grow by a 7 % in the next 50 years . 
  some years easter ( more tourism and thus more jobs ) happens in march , but this year is in april , so a march without easter being record is good news for us . 
  yeah , i felt really at home when i went there the last year . 
  both portuguese people and foreigners took me as portuguese , so i must look pretty alike too !, 
  http://www.amb.cat/es/web/area-metropolitana/coneixer-l-area-metropolitana/poblacio it 's not too different from the rest of catalonia . 
  the lowest rates come from the metropolitan area of barcelona , iirc . 
  urban working class , basically . 
  not too old . 
   no matter what some ill-informed people think over here what do you mean ? 
  there is resentment toward us ? 
  yes , the law should protect the minorities . 
  a 20 % , in this case . 
  those are statistics provided by the own government . 
  maybe you 're the one spreading bullshit , basing your opinion in your personal experience with friends and not in data . 
  why should we believe you and not the statistics ? 
  http://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20140620/54410138178/un-94-3-de-la-poblacion-entiende-el-catalan.html and this : http://www.intercat.cat/es/info/catala-catalunya.jsp, 
  you and your ever growing economy should know better than us !, 
  yep . 
  and as you can see it 's indeed as the first link says . 
  well , it turns out it 's a summary of both laws : the one from 1998 and the one from 2010 . 
  it 's not `` lo que hay '' : the law protects them as far as they understand catalan to speak in the language the want . 
  around 25 % of catalan does n't speak catalan , but only a 5 % of catalan does n't understand it . 
  so say sorry to 20 % of your population . 
  it 's a resume of the rigths of the law . 
  the law i 'm talking about is this one : https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=boe-a-1998-2989, 
  now go convince an aut\u00f3nomo of 50 years old who works 12 hours per day to take classes of catalan . 
  are you a 40-60 years old catalan of andalusian roots which its first language is spanish and can understand catalan but not speak it ? 
  because that 's a very specific demographic category . 
  not all : around 90 % of young people ; which is a lot , gladly . 
  but you 're denying the other 10 % the right to open a business . 
  between older people this is even more true . 
  the owner of a business can speak the language of his preference too , just like the consumer . 
  [ see point 2 . ], 
  ( http://consum.gencat.cat/temes_de_consum/drets_linguistics/index_es.html ) ` in other words , being treated in catalan means that the consumer should be understood when expressed in catalan without being forced to express himself in another language . 
  however , the interlocutor may respond to the consumer in catalan or spanish . ', 
  [ source . ], 
  so someone born in catalonia , in which the majority of its population has spanish as their native language , should n't open a business because their catalan proficency ( maybe they understand it but have no confidence to speak it ) is not good enough . 
  i hope this is just a common thought between twenty years old lads of reddit , because damn . 
  that 's within the law : signs , labels , etc. , should be in both languages . 
  the consumer should speak to the shop owner in the language of his/her preference , but the same is true for the owner : they can respond in the language of their preference . 
  read your law . 
  you do n't understand : they are catalanes as you , but they have andalusian roots !, 
  without them , catalonia would be around 3,5 million of people right now , and not 7,5 million . 
  all of them understand catalan , but they do n't speak catalan as good , and they should not be obliged to do so . 
  that 's what the law stipulates , no more : that they can not force the consumer to speak another language , but viceversa too : they can respond in the language of their preference . 
  what kind of weak ad hominem is that ? 
  you can do surely better . 
  immigrants have to relearn a new language from scratch , specially economic ones , and they should not face discrimination in their process to adquire the new language . 
  the difference being that spanish is the first language of catalonia by native speakers . 
  they 're not immigrants of their own country ( and they should n't be treated as that ; nobody should ) , even if they do n't speak one of the official languages . 
  a public administration should not interfere with private business in this regard . 
  besides , there 's already a law that stipulates that everything should be both in spanish and catalan . 
  take the train seville-barcelona . 
  you would be amazed by the amount of the workers from andaluc\u00eda , a lot of them aut\u00f3nomos . 
  the andalusian/catalan aut\u00f3nomo ( owner of a small business , i do n't know the exact word in english ) is left with two options : to face discrimination subvencioned by the governement because his/her catalan skills are not good enough ( even if he or she is currently trying to improve ) or hire someone who speaks catalan , what is hard to do if you 're an aut\u00f3nomo . 
  hopefuly those scenarios would not happen because most of the people is rational enough to not discriminate based on language skills . 
  so you do n't buy in chinese , turkish , romanian , etc. , shops because their language skills are subpar ? 
  what a nice way to improve integration , indeed . 
  but the ngo is heavily subvencioned by the catalan government , it 's not something that the catalan consumers have created by * motu propio * , as some want to imply . 
  and you do n't see how that will be harmful for immigrants ? 
  ` spaniards ' , what spaniards ? 
  vox ? 
  because no spanish government has paid any ngo to boicot anything , and those ` spaniards ' are still the main consumers of catalan products and services . 
  stop generalizing . 
  public administration = / = private business . 
  as simple as that . 
  imagine if an app like that is made . 
  it would target immigrant business based on their time here , their language skills , etc. 
  we should fight against something like that . 
  i will , obviously . 
  that would be a wet dream for falange : ` this chinese restaurant ? 
  so bad !, 
  they speak broken spanish . 
  sad face in the app . ', 
  you do n't know the shitstorm that would happen here if something equivalent was used but with castilian .
