  i 'm down for it !, 
  it 's not as relevant , though . 
  there is a reason why those territories have not been included in the un list for territories for decolonization : they have been integral part of spain since almost the beginning , unlike gibraltar . 
  ifni , tetu\u00e1n , etc. , were spanish colonies and thus devolved to morocco , unlike ceuta and melilla . 
  the broad brush approach is nice and all that in an internet debate , but when you look a bit closer to history and international law you see pretty easily that these situations are not comparable . 
  so , to be clear , if tarragona and barcelona ( cities ) voted no against the independence of catalonia , they should remain spanish even if the rest of catalonia voted otherwise . 
  because they have the right to be whatever they want to be , am i right ? 
  even if that breaks the territorial integrity of the country of catalonia , in this case . 
  so right now you are blatantly defending the status of a colony , which at the beginning you said it was not your intention . 
  i think his position is pretty clear : in a referendum in catalonia , if tarragona and barcelona voted to remain in spain , but overall catalonia voted to be independent , they should remain spanish while lleida and girona should become a new catalan state . 
  the will of people matters more than territorial integrity , after all . 
   therefore it does n't break shit since it 's just part of another country , british overseas territories are not part of the united kingdom . 
  at least search a bit before open the mouth . 
  and the history of andorra has 0 in common with the history of gibraltar . 
  if you want to play the ` whatabout ' game , you should try with ceuta and melilla , which are what people ( wrongly , again ) normally use . 
  no , [ it 's a resolution of the un . ], 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_list_of_non-self-governing_territories ) nice argument , though . 
  what ? 
  a rich tax haven wants to keep being a tax haven , how strange !, 
  it does n't change the facts : gibraltar is a colony and it breaks the territorial integrity of a country . 
  the '' obsessed '' spanish government should defend the interests of our country against these two facts . 
  his comment is ridiculous , does n't matter if you take it as a whole or not . 
  a catalan independentist defending a colony just because it 's in spain . 
  i want to facepalm so hard . 
  you are sick , dude . 
  grow up .

  ( http://bruegel.org/2017/03/european-spring-trust-in-the-eu-and-democracy-is-recovering/ ) at the end of the article you can see indicators for almost every eu country , i think . 
  very interesting . 
  upvote for jolly schulz . 
  do n't listen to anyone but me . 
  i know my beers . 
  wonderful !, 
  hahahahahahaha, 
  priceless . 
   cherry picked and distorted fact ftfy, 
  i share the general idea of what he 's saying , but he says it with too much imagery and allegory . 
  for my taste , of course . 
  thanks portubros ! ^ ^ and ^ ^ morocco !, 
  that 's what we get for almost 40 years ( although in its last years it opened a bit ) of anti-liberal and peripheral dictatorship . 
  russia has tremendous potential . 
  what a shame . 
  that mighty australia , though . 
  our image abroad is still better than here . 
  we have some self-confidence issues . 
  can you see it on mobile ? 
  i mostly use social media via mobile . 
  maybe i 'm blind . 
  i did n't know it existed . 
  that title , though : ready to create controversy and antagonism . 
  nobody says something like that in the article . 
  spanish officials are repeating the same thing time and time again : scotland ca n't join ipso facto , it has to go throught the join process , and only if , as other redittor has said , gets its independence legally . 
  allow it \u2260 it 's a normal practice . 
  and again : all those territories have different legal and historical realities , as you can see from the un list . 
  none of them are comparable to each other . 
  and that example was bad in the case of spain . 
  just saying that . 
  those territories were never colonies , they were integral part of spain since almost the beginning . 
  or\u00e1n , tetu\u00e1n , ifni or west sahara were colonies , and we renounced to them when the decolonization happened . 
  [ here is the un list of non-self governing territories ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_list_of_non-self-governing_territories ) . 
  you 're mixing apples with oranges , as we say here . 
  ceuta and melilla are as spanish as some part of tracia is turkish . 
  it to be in another continent does n't change anything . 
  we should trade them for israel . 
  i thought it was a word in english too . 
  i tried to say that you were representing individuals in a vacuum , without context whatsoever . 
  catalunya is richer , indeed , but not that much : 203.626 m. $ ( madrid ) and 204.666 m. $ ( catalunya ) . 
  the data is from 2015 . 
  madrid is growing faster , though . 
  i thought you were talking about cities , not communities . 
  [ madrid is richer than barcelona ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_metropolitan_areas_in_the_european_union_by_gdp ) . 
  we wrote the same thing at the same time !, 
  that 's an ahistorical point of view if i 've seen one . 
  not this again . 
  the christians ( gentiles ) did n't follow the old covenant ( specially mosaic law ) since almost the beginning ( saul of tarsus influence ) . 
  the ones who did were judeo-christians , and disappeared as community rather soon . 
  the economy of castile was at its peak in the early 1500s ( around 1520 ) , right after the expulsion , and again in the end of the century . 
  the downfall came with the demographic , economic and military effort that castile had to do to mantain the habsburg hegemony around europe for two centuries . 
  what a failure for europe . 
  i hope they find their new home safer . 
  but curie was also polish ... oh . 
  way to be competitive . 
  spain above portugal . 
  you missed that one . 
  i said to you my definition just right now . 
  the point of your first comment was to say this sentence , i assume . 
  well then . 
  that would be hard . 
  i guess someone who identifies himself within a certain ideological , cultural , etc. , framework ; in this case from west europe . 
  we have large groups of people that are westerners only nominally , not culturally . 
  but this guy was born in europe . 
  we do n't have the legislation to do that . 
  til anticlerical pro sex toys group ( sic ) was a terrorist group of spain . 
  [ there was more ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ex%c3%a8rcit_popular_catal%c3%a0 ) than terra lliure , sadly . 
  apparently nobody knows them . 
  a galician nationalist organitation killed one cop that was trying to desactivate a bomb , iirc . 
  and [ these guys , catalan nationalists this time , ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ex%c3%a8rcit_popular_catal%c3%a0 ) killed a politician and his wife and also an industrialist . 
  [ not really ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ex%c3%a8rcit_popular_catal%c3%a0 ) . 
  catalan and galician nationalists movements have killed at least 4 people , without taking in account their own members . 
  even canarian terrorists killed one person at some point .
