  that was what i meant : more open about social and moral issues ( euthanasia , legal prostitution , etc. ) . 
  ciudadanos has made contradictory statements about issues of this kind , afaik . 
  economically , i want them to promote free market and fiscal reponsibility . 
  yeah , the europeans anarchists usually do n't accept them as equals , at least when i was more involved with these kind of movements . 
  kevin carson is one of their main and most genuine figures , if you 're interested . 
  [ left-libertarianism ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/left-libertarianism ) is a different doctrine . 
  it comes from georgism and the interpretation of proudhon 's doctrine by some anarchists in the us . 
  it 's also more individualist in philosophy . 
  i do n't think so . 
  a more accurate example would be the italian radical party , or at least some branches of it . 
  classic liberalism or socioliberalism in economic issues ; leftism ( very progressive ) in moral and social issues and republican . 
  a kind of left-libertarisnism , i guess . 
  i guess so . 
  but i think the threshold to enter the parliament is usually a bit higher . 
  in spain is 3 % , i believe . 
  man , i wish we had something like d66 here . 
  or maybe a ciudadanos more openly republican and leftist . 
  anyways , go d66 !, 
  crimes committed by anarchists and communists does n't change the point : in europe there has been a battle for the institutions -- to separate the church and the religion from the government . 
  you 're being too harsh , i think . 
  althouh i agree with the last point : when i went to lisbon this year the countryside was empty , even the roads . 
  why is that ? 
  he was visiting the portuguese timor . 
  or he 's from murica . 
  not sure yet . 
  and that alone makes the proposition of mass deportation somewhat right ? 
  i 'm glad this reasoning did n't have too much influence during our struggle against christianism . 
  they ( religious people ) have to adapt to the secular liberal state , and not the secular liberal state to them . 
  i mean , they are in their land just as much as the irish catholics . 
  maybe some are original inhabitants that converted to protestantism at some point . 
  it 's more complicated , i think . 
  absolutely gorgeous . 
  ca n't wait to visit toledo again !, 
  alright then . 
  i thought you were talking about the current legal framework . 
  so we should believe the word of a random independentist redditor that says that ` the spanish civil servants are being used ' ? 
  i guess we can ` kek ' that too . 
  so that 's why the [ govern of catalunya is looking into judges ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/politica/vidal-erc-govern-ilegalmente-investiga_0_605790612.html ) , to know if they 're ` spanish civil servants ' and , thus , loyal to the law . 
  let 's play the conspiracy game all , shall we ? 
  then we must form the glorious uni\u00e3o ib\u00e9rica and rise together , caralho !, 
  different opinions for different paradigms ( history , legal framework , etc. ) . 
  not that weird if you profundize more than ` look !, 
  both seek independence ! ', 
  a lot of companies that operate all over spain are based in catalonia too , to be honest . 
  well , in barcelona to be more specific . 
  we will recover , portubro !, 
  from what i have heard , pedro s\u00e1nchez , at least in his electoral campaign for psoe 's presidency , links this change within the constitution to the possibility of a referendum , so it seems that the article 2 would suffer a deep change . 
  the different nations would have ` legal significance ' then , so to say . 
  but only he truly knows what he is referring to , or if he 's just playing the ` look at me , i 'm a lefty ' strategy . 
  we will see . 
  i did n't downvoted you , but if pedro s\u00e1nchez wins ( with his concept of plurinationality ) , a coalition of nationalists + psoe + podemos could lead to a change in the constitution , and thus a legal referendum . 
  in a future and if they have a majority , of course . 
  in the federal republican movement the majority is in favour of a referendum . 
  or at least that 's my perception when i talk with people with the same ideas than me . 
  although , obviously , a federal and republican spain would be better with catalonia . 
  the problem is a legal one , indeed . 
  the scenary is going to change a bit if pedro s\u00e1nchez wins with his will of include the concept of ` plurinationality ' in the constitution . 
  that change would allow a legal referendum . 
  until then , there 's not much that can be done without breaking the law . 
  you said it was a demagogic lie spread by pp and ciudadanos , and i proved it was not . 
  i did n't say a word about pp or c 's , or what they are , so nice whataboutism there . 
  and we have a law against those things , which is being implemented slowly since pp is in the government , sadly . 
  if that makes you sleep better at night !, 
  oh , yeah , catalan politicians and newspapers have never done any attack against spaniards , especially from the south . 
  the only generalization here is the first posted that says that the ` spanish government and justice system is antidemocratic and corrupt . ', 
  just playing by his rules . 
  you can block him too . 
  [ a demagogic lie , huh ? ], 
  ( https://www.google.es/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahukewiplrw3z9psahue1hokhufxcc0qjrwibw&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.eldiario.es%2fcatalunyaplural%2fciu-lespanya-subsidiada-catalunya-productiva_0_171133131.html&amp;bvm=bv.149397726,d.ewe&amp;psig=afqjcnemdevoqbbzglircvshlb-hp7yzba&amp;ust=1489499299104835 ) cdu stands for christlich demokratische union deutschlands . 
  or graffitis comparing spaniards with apes , calling for the adoption of children from extremadura , calling lazy the andalusians , ` espanya ens roba ' , pushed by the major catalonian parties , etc. 
  and cdu had major members that were nazis , so what ? 
  that 's what happens when you change from a dictature to a democracy : you have to integrate all the previouse people . 
  the law can be broke because they do n't like it , basically . 
  and if you do n't agree you 're a fascist and you must get out of catalu\u00f1a , [ like their chief public prosecutor ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.es/2017/02/14/fiscal-juicio-mas_n_14739802.html ) . 
  there are also castile independentists movements ( izquierda castellana ) . 
  even from extremadura . 
  most of them are communists who do n't have any idea about our history . 
  it 's the same for every european ( at least in the west ) country , honestly . 
  our catholicism is more cultural than anything else . 
  well , it seems that we have a problem . 
  he 's just saying that the killing of civilians is morally wrong , does n't matter the context . 
  finally some good news for us . 
  i hope the trend keeps going a couple of years at least . 
  mass ( and steady ) immigration to the eeuu and to other commonwealth nations ? 
  just guessing . 
  and also two world wars . 
  it goes something like this ( for spain ) : women : two kisses . 
  it does n't matter if you do n't know her too much , but beware : if you see her everyday just say hi , this only works if you have n't seen her in a long time or you just knew her . 
  although in a really formal environment a handshake can be better . 
  it depends . 
  men : do n't do it , even if they are friends ( unless they have said otherwise before , which would be rare ) . 
  you can only give cheek kisses to members of your family ( cousins , grandfather ... ) edit : more information !, 
  if one promotes integration and another misunderstanding and discrimination , why should we allow the later one ? 
  you have been inside your mother too , so i would say you have been in more bigoted places . 
  hazteo\u00edr , the organitation behind this , is ultracatholic , so it was a joke playing with the typical ` god only created a woman and a man , the bible says so . ', 
  i see now . 
  thank you . 
  [ definition of gender ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gender ) : ` depending on the context , these characteristics may include biological sex ( i.e. 
  the state of being male , female or an intersex variation which may complicate sex assignment ) , sex-based social structures ( including gender roles and other social roles ) , or gender identity . ', 
  you 're talking about sex-based social structures .
