someone tell her that the name artur is an acute word please . 
  child-adas ... 
  yeah , and it 's time for the harvest of the grenades and almonds . 
  i 'm talking about france and the hypothetical scenario you pourposed . 
  if majority of the people wants it , why not ? 
  and they only tell us now ... \u00ac \u00ac, 
  imploding ? 
  he is , right ? 
  when i meet some french tourist for more than 5 minutes [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzf-stig-ko ) comes to my mind , always !, 
  not for the lyrics ( ca n't speak french ) but for the great tune . 
  [ jean reno ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean_reno ) has some interesting background . 
  * natural boobies, 
  cool guys , workaholics . 
  because they are lentejos, 
  <  ball, 
  we 'll have longer periods of time when it 's warm enough to go to the beach also . 
  :( not fair, 
  hmmmmmm blooonde vikings ... 
  why are you answering to me then ? 
  he comented in this one . 
  who established that ? 
  pepe mujica said so , poors revenge over the world will be their fertility . 
  ps : could someone tell them to slow down a little so we 'll all a better life ? 
  what those who have organized this mess with isis , kurds , siria , iraq and almost all the middle east is irrelevant to me also . 
  he/she stated that a good terrorist is a dead terrorist . 
  where he sees a terrorist i see a fighter , where i see a terrorist he sees a fighter . 
  for me , turkey is doing state terrorism against pkk terrorists , this guy above is on turkey 's side so for me he is a terrorists and following his philosophy i have the right to kill him because he is a terrorist . 
  anyways , i would n't kill anyone . 
  even the worst terrorist . 
  i 'm giving myself the `` moral right '' to kill him . 
  i use to consider it `` semi/europe '' but ^ not ^ anymore, 
  i consider yourself a terrorist from now on . 
  is turkey europe or not ? 
  i 'm confused . 
  i think you missed the point of the post . 
  do you really think the fighter women are mutilated ? 
  i do n't know what you mean . 
  i 'd be like that 12 months a year if i could . 
  honestly , i hate working . 
  education , my english was learned on the internet . 
  have you noticed the even lower participation during august from spanish redditors ? 
  :d ps : \u00ac \u00ac,

  [ this is what reading the title brought to my mind ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_sy6oijbek ), 
  it 's august , wait 7 more days and you 'll have answers from spain . 
  fills de que ? 
  perfect fodder for fish farms . 
  norway ~ ~ secretly ~ ~ wants to become the 51st . 
   * our and your coasts * you mean they 're going to use one for mallorca ? 
  it 's more a german thing here , believe me . 
  i live next to the church and since i work outside it helps me to know the time without watching my clock . 
  it does n't bother me during the night . 
  i 'm not the traveler , i live in the touristic place , so friends i make year by year come and go , but i keep in touch using the creepy facebook . 
  i 'm blocked at the moment and my facebook name was my `` everyday nickname '' i 'm not sending them my real name !, 
  lol , i 'm going there right now to have a swim :d i was surprised to see it mentioned here . 
  they should also launch investment funds to finance the demolition of failed infrastructure projects . 
  we have plenty of stinky cadavers here at least . 
  i used google translator but it was n't so accurate . 
  * zapping pants, 
  thats the first thing you do after zipping pants . 
  so you had luck ? 
   the h in the begin of words is n't read . 
  so there are some cases where words in spanish start with an h but not in portuguese and vice-versa . 
  you 're centuries ahead of us in this  in other hand , my name is henrique but in spain the name is enrique without the h. true and curious , 
  how did you lose the h from hola ? 
  i 've heard scandinavians like [ the canary islands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canary_islands ) and i think they 're wise when choosing a place to go vacationing . 
  is n't this like saying that radical muslims ans socialists are united because both of them agree that eating is a necessary thing ? 
  beware of the russians and their [ big trolling machine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duga-3 ) . 
  do n't mess with them !, 
  i 'm a painter and decorator and when i went to tuscany i thought if there were any painters in italy . 
  almost all houses needed to be painted . 
  is it maybe that they do n't really care about it ? 
  [ * `` quan el mal ve d'almansa a tots alcan\u00e7a '' * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_almansa ) is our saying here in the east . 
   when evil comes from almansa , reaches everybody ( my macaronic traduction ), 
  solidarity forever , solidarity forever , solidarity forever , for the union makes us strong . 
  is there aught we hold in common with the greedy parasite , who would lash us into serfdom and would crush us with his might ? 
  is there anything left to us but to organize and fight ? 
  for the union makes us strong . 
  he 's not racist , racist means to discriminate by the color of the skin , not by behaviour . 
  listen , the major in my hometown is gipsy , he is a normal businessman doing a good job both in his business and the townhall married to a caucasian spanish woman and no one dislikes him . 
  ( in this case we 're not racists ) in the other hand , there 's a gipsy family living of subsidies , not having a known job and dedicated to roam around in their truck picking public lighting copper , car batteries , brass from the irrigation sistems and any metallic thing they can find . 
  littering through the window to the ravine that passes next to their house and a long etc of not so civilized attitudes . 
  we do not like them . 
  ( yes , in this case we are racists ), 
  ~ ~ trees ~ ~ bushes , scorpions and rocks , 
  wait till the summer has gone . 
  we 'll talk by then . 
  i was thinking the same , then while watching the video i saw the top comment on youtube . 
  came here to to find the same . 
  please , you both go to a hotel !!, 
  true , who knows if a little reproduction of myself is growing in some random country ? 
  i love erasmus programs , 
  that criminal ... we have a `` wanted '' poster of him in every corner here in valencia . 
  bring your women and i gib clay . 
  cause they were negotiating still and trying to get a better deal for themselves ? 
  they they they are playing democracy . 
  voting = democracy, 
  in my opinion they wanted to reafirm theirselves in power , see if the people are backing them and from now keep pushing things or see if they did n't have the suport anymore and convoquing elections again . 
  check out jaen surroundings in google maps , mapvlooks like it has a mosquito net filter because of the trees .
