  if we did a serious investigation about the real origins of the olive oil and tracking it 's procedence it 'd be funny and a big surprise i think . 
  we invented the best product you can do with olive oil . 
  the [ allioli ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aioli ), 
  i guess each country makes the best olive oil . 
  there are little oil producers which produce very good oil everywhere you go , italy , spain , greece ... for me it 's dumb to say that a country oil is better than the other . 
  spain for example has like 5 different climates and do n't know how many different varieties of olives and soils . 
  which one do you choose to be the `` spanish standard '' ? 
  ever been to an `` almazara '' ( oil press ) ? 
  that smell is ... makes you hungry in 2 seconds if you are an olive oil lover . 
  and it 's a shame to see the little cut the farmers get from it . 
  it 's always the same with agriculture . 
  guerra !!!,

  and they do n't believe us when we say that this is northern africa . 
  heard it many times on spanish radios : the person talking says an english word ( to make it sound cool ? 
  modern ? 
  ) , translates it one time so people knows the meaning and then keeps going using the english word . 
  ok , good luck,

  where to ? 
  ( less or more ), 
  facilities need to be painted , they look dirty . 
  wild guess here at least , where i live cities were `` designed '' by muslims so we live all together have narrow streets and usually cities were surrounded by walls . 
  here in the south is good to have narrow streets like that so you 're less exposed to direc sunlight . 
  as i said in a comment before ( which do n't know why got downvoted ) this kind of villages are more eco friendly . 
  we live more eco friendly in that sense .
