  of course any help would be welcome . 
  we do n't need it . 
  our armies are sitting around 99 % of the time and there are no serious threats . 
  there is no point in making them bigger . 
  war because of stupid imperialist original country . 
  even in your hypothetical example , i 'm sure the `` immigrants '' would n't want a war . 
  why are you posting so many examples about immigration ? 
  are you obsessed about it ? 
  it 's not even related to this case . 
  what option are you talking about ? 
  in about 2 months from now , i reckon we will have the national police closing down the voting places . 
  that would make it ok to have colonies if you have the military power to mantain them . 
  which is not cool in my book . 
  mushrooms and soon , chestnuts . 
  yes but that 's irrelevant to the average consumer . 
  and for someone to whom the difference matters ( me , for example , as i do a lot of fem and solidworks drawings ) , we have reviews and benchmarks . 
  for the random casual gamer , it does n't really matter much . 
  and for the casual computer owner it does n't matter at all . 
  it will run firefox and office good enough . 
  yes but the average buyer knows that an i7 is better than an i5 . 
  and so on . 
  that 's a bit misleading . 
  then if people quit having coffee at a bar we could save thousands of millons of euros a year !, 
  usually the ghz of a cpu is a pretty decent indicator because there are n't many mainstream models out . 
  so yeah . 
   we could be driving pickup trucks murica !, 
  in your opinion . 
  free undergrad in spain ? 
  finding a job in spain without spanish ? 
  good luck with that mate . 
  just because she was a porn actress does n't mean she 's the mp 's whores . 
  it kind of is compared to spain , i suppose . 
  in catalunya probably this guy has a few haters too . 
  he 's loved around some parts of town . 
  i have the weirdest boner . 
  laziness , nice holiday destination , corruption and backwards people . 
  i guess they are not wrong except for the laziness . 
  same here . 
  and realistically we do n't have a common language . 
  that 's a big barrier . 
  i mean there 's a lot of people in some of those countries ( including mine ) that know very little if any english . 
  sounds like an asimov novel . 
  this . 
  podemos is just a bunch of shitty populism . 
  money ? 
  but a thousandfold more expensive . 
  unless on a big city , subway is dumb . 
  the source of the article is bbc , dude . 
  if you bribed an officer 50 $ , maybe they would let you go with paying 150 $ . 
  ah , who am i kidding . 
  well that 's arguable . 
  he paid back twice the money he bribed . 
  that 's a net gain to society , compared to sending him to jail . 
  gains and costs to society should also be part of ethical codes . 
  that 's because it fluctuates like crazy and it 's hard to predict . 
  it 's about time to have nationalized energy production and distribution , imo . 
  really dude ? 
  there used to be a wall for some years . 
  also aerodynamics and safety . 
  that 's just plain wrong . 
  i see more of the normal ones and i cross passeig de gr\u00e0cia every day at least 2 times . 
  we have those in barcelona too : http://www.arca-bus.org/images/cent_sprinter.jpg, 
  it 's not much ( if at all ) longer than your typical one connection bus . 
  but it can turn closed angles easily . 
  i am not talking bad about them though . 
  we are not athletically better , so no . 
  i had never heard such a rethoric figure before . 
  mind showing me some examples ? 
  i love my kids murdered in gaza does n't make much sense either . 
  yes , i said spain is very racist . 
  yup . 
  idk . 
  i 'm not sure . 
  it should mean `` i want my kids murdered in gaza '' but that does n't make any sense at all . 
  '' i love gaza 's murdered children . '', 
  this is not what `` quiero a mis ni\u00f1os asesinados en gaza '' means . 
  but still , racist people in spain , surprise . 
  yeah this is disgusting . 
  i did n't know this sub was like that . 
  what 's the problem with progressive tax ? 
  too much . 
  that 's not offensive at all . 
  it is in fact true that euskadi and catalunya are spanish . 
  in spain you have to carry your id or else you can be brought to the police station . 
  it is rare to be asked for it unless driving a vehicle , tho . 
  the first sentence is contradictory with the second . 
  and with a lot of your comments which are certainly not friendly or neutral . 
  so agressive it is . 
  anything -  cows -  methanol, 
  but when we have an overabundance of apples ... yay !, 
  thanks for the link !, 
   none of my comments are aggressive . 
   you 'll probably enjoy this sub if you find that funny : / r/im14andthisisfunny cognitive dissonance ? 
  not only that , but partly , yes . 
  but i will give you my finest selection of funny comments .

  you did n't want to see the funny posts or understand me . 
  you are just shooting agressive comments at me because you are upset . 
  which is ok , but do n't pretend otherwise . 
  that was n't the point of your post .
