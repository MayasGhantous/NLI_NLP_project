  not that it does n't have its faults , off course, 
  ahem ... most countries are older/form part of older cultures than the us , nothing special ... if anything i 'll say you are among the exceptions, 
  everyone 's in church doing ... things ( hopefully not to children ), 
  burnnnn, 
  look at it !!, 
  look at it !!, 
  i just can say that i 'm very grateful to hear this . 
  actually we are quite used to these kind of attitudes against us , its nothing new . 
  having to permanently explain and defend our sense of identity is so common as to be almost second nature by now . 
  it all will be worth it once we get independence , it 's worth all the crap we are getting ( absolutelly not being ironic here , i really think so ) , 
  well , aleixasv is in vocally ( and bravely , if i may say ) in favour of catalan independence , without caring for downvotes or any other imaginary egopoints , and some people clearly , clearly hate him for it . 
  this issue of catalonia is far more serious than most people on the subreddit know , the hate ( violent hate ) against catalonia independence is very real, 
  the kingdom of aragon was * one * of the constituent parts of the * crown * of aragon apples and oranges here, 
  did you hear about the praga spring ? 
  thats what will happen if the army comes down the diagonal again not exactly a victory this time, 
  * some * spaniards hate the catalans that bad and worse, 
  from catalonia it doesnt appear stalled at all , on the contrary, 
  is the scottish parliament a `` regional '' parliament ? 
  just asking do you know what the spanish constitution says about different kinds of `` comunidades autonomas '' ? 
  spanish journalism qualith standards, 
  and in many schools they teach chinese and/or arabic too nowadays i was n't talking about the number of people learning the language , but of the prestige of the language reflected in its use . 
  in this sense it is logical that spanish lags far , far behind french . 
  education and scientific research in the spanish speaking world is pityful , and while there are exceptions , r&d and innovation is quite the shit overall . 
  it is not a prestige language . 
  prestige has nothing to do with your preferences or the number of speakers . 
  it has a lot to do with academic and scientific publications with an important `` impact factor '' so yes , lots of people like salsa music ( certainly more than flamenco or other dandruffy genres ) and want to visit latin america , some even for business , but spanish is far , far from being a prestige language like i.e , french, 
  all of them in latin america , except equatorial guinea . 
  spanish is a major language population wise , but just like chinese , and unlike say , french , it is not a major prestige language used extensively in academic/scientific fields ( tell me of a good impact factor spanish journal , please ) . 
  in europe spanish is barely more `` useful '' than italian, 
  i 'm sure all the people in the south of france will be thrilled to have the main border with spain closed :d, 
  histerically happy tears, 
  sit and watch then . 
  carles puigdemont is a whole lot more independentist than mas . 
  so now we may have : forcadell president of the parliament , exleader of the anc puigdemont president : leader of the ami maybe junqueras as vicepresident : leader of erc ill say is pretty pretty clear who they are and what they want, 
  not even podemos . 
  it seems in the end the podemos brand in catalonia will not even have their own parliamentary group , which is enormously harmful for their credibility, 
  they reached the agreement a fucking 15 minutes before automatic elections were to be declared people is literally crying in the streets here, 
  he 's the mayor of girona and the president of the ami , the association of independentist towns of catalonia ca n't find a more hardcore independentist than that, 
  indesinenter, 
  to compare catalonia and quebec is just plain stupid canada is one of the most advanced , democratic industrial economies of the world spain is ... a ( bad ) joke of a fountry, 
  i meant hung off a tree , as in standing in an upper branch , not like in killing himself, 
  none, 
  do you think catalonia is a nation ? 
  ( in the same way scotland , wales and qebec are ? ), 
  junqueras has the same possibility of being president than romeva . 
  what it is clear is that mas will not be president , either he will step down ( the most sensible and realistic option ) or he will be forced out by his jxs\u00ed partners and independentist public opinion . 
  mas has the possibility of having an `` honourable '' discharge now , at least for his public ; if he sticks to his office and becomes a rock in the pace of the process he will be demonised by his own camp . 
  personally i was in favour of the fabled `` no active politicians '' list that was discussed before the elections , but the anc and omnium were real pussies and bent over to mas , who it has to be admitted that is way , way out of their league in negotiation tactics . 
  well , this is what we have now , i just hope for him to resign quickly and hope not to be forced to have to actually have to go to the generalitat to force him ( by demonstration ) . 
  for the record , i did n't downvoted you , not now , not before ( not even after that message with the overall threatening tone ) . 
  why care about upvotes and downvotes after all . 
  you know how things are , messaging here is only an exposition , we will not conngvince each other . 
  if someone downvotes you , he can suck it , doesnt change a thing, 
  the empaitada d ` anecs was actually banned last march, 
  around 70 years , year up , year down, 
  well , spain does have an extra degree of complexity in this regard with the `` periperal '' nations et all . 
  catalonia and the basque country are overwelmingly republican ( or at least anti-bourbon ... which is mostly the same ) . 
  so in spain , most left-wingers are republican , most people in the `` peripherial '' nations are republican , etc. . . 
  personally i just do n't get how anyone can be a monarchist in spain at all , by principle , but i respect those who do . 
  you also agree there are many , many more republicans in spain than in most other monarchies in europe . 
  in spain republican feelings are highly localised , but where they exist , they are fairly hegemonic, 
  loved in some places , hated in some other places, 
  in a day yes , but a menu del dia is about 8-10 euros, 
  to ciudadanos and to most in the psoe , to be fair, 
  interesting , yet you failed to mention that the main reason there is no government in spain is because several partied have been excluded from the negotiations , you know who . 
  those 17 votes would have been vital to form , in example , a progressive government with psoe and podemos, 
  i 'm a little surprised you banalise poverty in such a way , it 's actually kind of cruel . 
  * going out to eat and expensive holidays * ?? 
  more like living on less than 600 euros a month ( 10 million people ) and in cases of * extreme * poverty , around 300 ( 3,5 million more ) . 
  not being able to heat your home in the winter , having to go to caritas for food . 
  almost 1 in 3 spaniards are either poor or in risk of social exclusion there is ample data on this : http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2016-05-24/umbral-pobreza-hogares-ine_1205320/ http://diario16.com/pobreza-en-espana-15-datos-para-la-verguenza/ http://www.eldiario.es/economia/claves-pobreza-espana_0_519348563.html http://www.eldiario.es/economia/pobreza-dispara-espana-alcanza-poblacion_0_441306739.html the thing is that there is not much public debate about this , and consequently it seems many people is not even conscious of the scale of this problem, 
  spain is not a poor country , china is not a poor country , but both countries have a severe problem with * poverty * , and that was what i tried to highlight , providing sources btw . 
  just because i have a catalan flag in my flavour it does n't mean i 'm trying to `` undermine spain '' . 
  does a person with a spanish monarchical flag - the same with which a mass murderer established a dictatorship of 40 years in spain - as a flavour consistently try to `` undermine catalonia '' ? 
  no it doesnt . 
  i was answering a , to my taste , absurdly triumphalistic message which again , to me , reeked of inferiority complex . 
  as a holder of a spanish passport i have the same right to critisize spain as any other has to defend it . 
  i pay my taxes in spain , i am under spanish law , thus i can highlight the problems of the country since they are my own, 
  nice editing , bro, 
  catalan * `` humor '' *, 
   ** i 'll give you one , and just one advice for the next time ** : you 're trying too hard , it does n't help . 
  this * advice * looks like a veiled threat more than it should , does it * really * looks like i care what you think about what i write ? 
  that is one wasted advice , i tell you, 
  at least you have some sense of humor, 
  maybe it is you who is `` mixing * shit * up '' , being a `` rich country '' does not mean the citizens are well off , because in the case of spain , it is quite the contrary . 
  spain is the country with the highest unequality in the oecd ( where most `` rich countries are , btw ) : http://www.lavanguardia.com/economia/20160118/301484073871/espana-desigual-ocde.html http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/2579829/0/arope/maximos-pobreza-espanoles/2014/ http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2016/06/02/actualidad/1464890699_846293.html ** 29,2 % ** of spaniards ( 13.657.232 people ) as of 2015 are `` in risk of exclusion '' ( they are poor ) the famed 1 % of spaniards hold more wealth than the bottom 80 % from 2007 to 2014 the median salary in spain fell by a ** 22,2 % ** ( the distance between high and low income salaries is among the highest of the eu , only second to estonia ) . 
  of the 35 richest companies ( the infamous ibex 35 ) , 17 do n't pay the corporation tax ( impuesto de sociedades ) . 
  i admit general unemployment is getting better ( spain is not pooor iuhuuu ) and is now below 20 % ( 19,6 % ) which off course clearly indicates that , unlike `` others '' , we are fine http://www.lavanguardia.com/economia/20160831/418845931/paro-espana-eurostat-julio.html youth unemployement is at 46,49 % , so not at the bottom , actually ( there 's still greece , thanks zeus )  http://www.elconfidencial.com/economia/2016-04-28/la-tasa-de-paro-juvenil-sube-ligeramente-hasta-el-46-49-en-el-primer-trimestre_1191465/ i 'm sure i 'll have a hard time discussing wether south korea or italy are poor countries though  ** the difference between you and me ** is not the amount of flag waving . 
  it 's that ** you bring bad headlines about spain ** no matter what the topic is about because you ca n't say `` spain is a poor country not belonging to the group of rich countries '' i can assure you i 'm not part of any freemason 's conspiracy to bring `` bad headlines '' about spain * no matter what *, 
  skynet ca n't come soon enough, 
  i looked up `` cercanias and despilfarro '' i looked up `` aeropuertos and despilfarro '' i looked up `` ave and despilfarro '' finally i just looked up `` infrastructures and despilfarro '' there are links to different newspapers on different dates . 
  cercanias problems are huge and so you can see they are covered in several different dates ; cercanias is also a very used infrastructure , unlike the ave , so there are more sources . 
  oh , and check out the `` wikidespilfarro '' , just a few dozen billions well spent here and there and as i tell you always , i do not really care about some fake internet egopoints , i do not care for `` winning or losing '' arguments here . 
  i was surprised to see how riled up you became after this inocuous map-joke . 
  the amount of flag waving ( we are not pooooor !!! ), 
  almost spoke for itself , so i just wanted to provide some * extra * data on my country ( i guess i have as much authority as you , as a holder of a spanish passport ) to keep our collective feet on the ground . 
  does new zealand have an independent judiciary ? 
  does any comparable `` rich country '' in europe ( france , italy , the uk , germany ) , our neighbours , have a government as innefficient as * we * do ( well , technically we do not have an elected government yet , after two election cicles ) ? 
  this has a lot to do with being a developed liberal democracy . 
   but we have probably the best infraestructures in w. europe http://www.eldiario.es/catalunya/trenes-rodalies-catalunya_0_483652488.html http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2016/02/09/catalunya/1455007263_832128.html http://www.elmundo.es/cataluna/2015/05/21/555d7295e2704e67588b4571.html http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/opinion/rodalies-problema-gestion-4960037 http://agencias.abc.es/agencias/noticia.asp?noticia=1635503 http://www.eldiario.es/economia/renfe-ave-tardienta-puente_genil_0_121438139.html http://www.libremercado.com/2012-01-18/lo-peor-del-despilfarro-30-obras-publicas-que-nos-cuestan-una-subida-de-impuestos-1276447226/ http://www.teinteresa.es/politica/despilfarro-casos-famosos-espana_0_1184882117.html http://www.larazon.es/historico/8727-aeropuertos-un-despilfarro-de-1-300-millones-klla_razon_411583#.ttt1vsr8opbboi9 there is even a wiki of the gross overspending and mismanagement of infrastructure construction and maintenance in spain : https://15mpedia.org/wiki/lista_de_ejemplos_de_despilfarro  is it at the bottom of the rich countries ?
