  sure , but still part of the rich countries judicial independence , 97 of 100 ( still better than azerbadjan ) http://imgur.com/a/pngaa almost out of the ranking , but still hanging on , hurrah !!, 
  http://www.libremercado.com/2016-10-11/espana-a-punto-de-quedarse-fuera-del-top-50-de-libertad-economica-1276584195/ i find it a little pathetic to be so proud of being at the bottom of the `` rich countries '' ; spain could have been so much more than that . 
  but alas , i 'm sure that the next government will finally change things for the better, 
  they believe it , yet ... http://www.worldfinance.com/infrastructure-investment/government-policy/spains-infrastructure-woes-are-more-serious-than-they-appear https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/santiago_de_compostela_derailment https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/valencia_metro_derailment, 
  we have to cope with that `` you do n't exist/you are all just a region '' on the internet everyday , but if you live in catalonia proper these kind of people are hard to find . 
  they are imperialistic , or to be more precise * endophobic * because this is what they learned , this is the ultimate legacy of the not so distant fascist dictatorship : spain is ** one people ** , one * race * , it always have been , and whoever deviates from that point is a separatist , a red , a jew , a freemason , or a combination of those ( jewish-masonic-red-separatist , i kid you not they used these word to denounce catalan independentist not that long ago ; ** rojo-separatista judeomas\u00f3nico ** ) . 
  so you see , in their mentality , those who were so * weak * as to be conquered ( siince the 1970 's they just deny we are a people without reccuring to the `` conquered '' argument , it makes it seem more modern ) , do not exist , and those who dont exist , can not have the right of self-determination . 
  which `` castillians '' are you talking about ?? 
  there are only spaniards in spain, 
  they do not even recognise our right to exost as a people . 
  this is actually a new developement , mostly created after 1939s franco victory and dictatorship, 
  it 's their culture , and it 's what have lead to the current situation . 
  i don t even think we will have to wait for next summer for imdependence , really, 
  thank you , i actually had a hard time crafting my response , after all , the original comment was of such quality and thought that it took me a long time to search the appropiate quotes and bibliography , but at last , i made it . 
  such a rewarding feeling !, 
  allright , but then the first independence referendum would have been a sham since the stay vote did n't win by a 60 % margin . 
  the majority is 50 % +1 vote , again , as in the brexit , which seems to be carriyng on . 
  i think , though , that maybe we have to rethink the way we look at the referendum as the `` ultimate decision maker '' for such important matters , maybe we have to search new ways to reach collective agreements where the will of the majority is respected while the minority still feels represented . 
  i do n't have an answer to this problem at all , but maybe its time to start thinking about it, 
  meanwhile in barcelona during your national day celebrations catalonia square : http://i.imgur.com/wbbvaz4.jpg blob : http://imgur.com/4e354fed-7ee5-4256-8906-a6bfdfdfed58 books being sold there by the pro-spanish demonstrators : https://directa.cat/sites/default/files/resize/lliberia_europa_0-650x365.jpg montjuich mountain : https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/imatges.vilaweb.cat/nacional/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/montjuic5.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/imatges.vilaweb.cat/nacional/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/montjuic-4-768x512.jpg your constitution does n't condemn fascism or nazism and protects the system the bloody murderous maniacal dictator created after his genocide . 
  instead it punishes those who ask for catalonia to be recognised as a nation in a completely pacific way . 
  instead of negotiating , jail , so be it then , how many people can spanish jails hold ? 
  because come 2017 you 'll need a lot more, 
  well a referendum is 50 % +1 vote to win , this is what would have happened in yours , this is what happened in the brexit one , and this is what we would like in ours ( although i think we may have to declare independence first abd on\u00e7y then we would be able to hold s ratification one , and face the consequences of all of it ) , off course asking for a 60 to 70 is always desirable , but not necessary fair . 
  best of luck, 
  our negative margin was 2 % , there is always work to do, 
  i thought the swamps were too humid to lit a fire . 
  thanks for the info , my dear croac-croac ( or crouaque-crouaque , as you say ) , 
  ah , this is the poland most spaniards like, 
  *** somehow ***, 
  do n't you think that writing all the time in spanish in an english majority forum is very ** cateto provinciano ** ? 
  after all languages are ** merely communication tools and * nothing else *** , right ? 
  spanish is an obstacle to proper communication here , so we better use the language everyone here can understand p.s : there is ** nothing ** to debate with people such as you , ** nothing ** , you just think we do n't exist , you think we invented the idea of a catalan people , a catalan nation , as a means to what , * get more money from spain * ? 
  because we are * racists * that believe we are better than others ? 
  this is hate , to deny someone else the righ to be what they want to be . 
  yeah , by force !, 
  we will get our tanks , surround the spanish congress and * force * them to let us do a referendum . 
  then we will use our million-men army and we will * force * everyone to vote in it .

   once the region government breaks the law the central grovernment will take maeasures i hope so !, 
  p.s : catalonia is note a region , it is a nationality of spain organised as an autonomous community, 
  albert rivera 0 ' 0 , the new beer everyone 's talking about, 
  yes , the control of the territory is a main concern and one that surely has been well planned by the catalan government , it is off course one of the most secretely guarded secrets , and from an independentist point of view i 'm more than all right at that . 
  i guess that the massive demonstrations of the past five years and the mobilisation of the independentist camp gives an idea of the kind of answer the civil society will give to an act of force by the spanish state in case we declare independence unilaterally . 
  the 2014 consultation ( it was no referendum ) gives you an idea of how spain may act in front of an act of massive disobeyance by catalan society too . 
  and yes , external support is very important and by the few things we know ( and by the frantic activity of the spanish foreign ministry trying to counter it ) it is being quite productive . 
  as i said the catalan secret service ( yes it exists ) and diplomatic services ( they too exist ) are working very quitely but tiredlessly . 
  we do not expect much support from latin america , a continent we do not have much relations with since they are much more close in all ways with spain , and quite sympathetic to it , maybe , perhaps , argentina may be an early friend , but it is quite a long shot . 
  the countries we are the closest during this process of independence are in europe and the middle east , most of them small to medium . 
  i do n't want to talk much about this , the information is easy to get for anyone interested . 
  well , i guess to follow catalan politics and society from the outside and through foreign press ( including the spanish one , unfortunately ) its a little difficult . 
  first of all , in 2014 there was ** no ** referendum , but a * popular consultation * , it was never presented as a referendum and that 's why the spanish government tolerated it . 
  it was still a very impressive feat . 
  this time it will be binding , as the president of catalonia said , wether the spanish government negotiates or not . 
  it has taken a long time to reach this point , but here we are . 
  there will be a conflict , not a deadlock , since if the referendum wins , the catalan parliament will move to declare independence the same night , and seek international recognition . 
  here is where many spanish ( and other nationalities ) redditors fail the most . 
  it is possible , off course , to try to ridicule this last fact , and to say `` nobody will recognise catalonia '' , etc , but the fact is that the spanish foreign ministry is very , very worried about this , because catalonia is already doing a very intense low key campaign using every mean it has , which includes catalan individuals in very high and influential places sympathetic to independence , of which there are many . 
  just to give you an example , the un undersecretary , just below ban ki moon is a catalan woman , or the former catalan finance minister mas-colell , who was professor emeritus of economy at harvard . 
  there are many , many more off course . 
  its been 6 years and the independence movement still has n't ran out of steam . 
  there are just too many divergences and few incentives to stay in spain , which is , to say it lightly , not a very appealing project for many catalans , probably to most . 
  she wanted $ nu - $ nu, 
  i 've put a link in catalan , but it would be nice if we could keep the conversation in english , so everyone can understand what we are talking about here in reddit ( and there is no need to call me an ignorant , although i know that is your regular tone , quite personally agressive ) . 
  ok , read that , but then again , apart from any publication whith support from the generalitat in any form ( la vanguardia and faes also had support from the generalitat ) , where is ther rebate to the arguments made by jordi borras ?? 
  it is clear the expresident of scc had a profile in youtube with filo-nazi propaganda videos created by him , also he insulted and threatened independentist politicians and media figures hidden under several profiles , he even resigned his position because of the scandal . 
  leading members of scc also were in casal tramuntana making apologies to the division azul and requet\u00e9 fighters , there is equally proof to that . 
  if scc says `` what borr\u00e0s says is wrong because a , b , c , then i 'll read it and will , faced with facts , believe their narrative . 
  but if all their defence is `` they are all against us because we do n't want independence and they are all financed by the generalitat '' i do n't find that a solid enough argument . 
  actually , had scc , ccc , and others foregone such intimate contact with far right organisations such as somatemps and casal tramuntana they would have , maybe , more of an impact in the catalan political and social sphere . 
  it is true that in catalonia , as you know well , its still difficult since most people here , independentists and non independentists of one of several degrees of leftism ( even the new pdc has a strong socialdemocratic vibe , but look at podemos and others too ) . 
  i am a self declared * red-separatist * if you will , just to be clear . 
  interesting that you comment on the `` persecution '' of `` anti-secessionist '' institutions . 
  can you give any insight on this ? 
  http://www.elcritic.cat/investigacio/els-vincles-ocults-de-lextrema-dreta-amb-societat-civil-catalana-2365 it seems the research was quite extensive , and by a proven investigative journalist specialised in far right which often works under threat to his personal security . 
  do you affirm all of his research is wrong ? 
  and also , upyd ?? 
  seriously ? 
  i know we are in an international forum and most people has no idea about spanish or catalan politics , but still ... does the party even exists now ? 
  you start to see what we are against here , many spaniards ( not all of them , off course ) just plainly refuse to acknowledge that we exist as a people , as hard as it sounds . 
  ok , so was spain , it was n't a nation until 1812, 
  thank you for the translation , 
  actually a thousand euros ( after taxes ) per month salary is considered * decent * for youngish ( 25-35 ) people in spain nowadays . 
  yeah , it 's as bad as it looks, 
  congratulations on your rebirth latvia , as a homage to you , and your baltic brothers courage in 1989 , in 2014 the catalan youth choir , in collaboration with ** m\u0101rti\u0146\u0161 brauns ** ( the original composer ) , made a version of that precious song , * saule , p\u0113rkons , daugava * , often considered , i am told , the `` second anthem of latvia '' . 
  [ here it is ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd4wnohiavq ) felicitats , let\u00f2nia !, 
  p.s : for those interested in the background of this version and what motivated it , [ here is an article ] ( http://www.delfi.lv/kultura/news/music/katalonus-apbur-martina-brauna-saule-perkons-daugava-vini-rada-savu-versiju.d?id=44771826&amp;com=1&amp;reg=0&amp;no=0&amp;s=1 ) which covers it ( via delfi , in ** latvian ** ), 
  this is not against anyone , but in the r/europe and when talking about catalonia independence , i do not really care about upvotes and downvotes . 
  next time i 'll put an / s for sure , though, 
  2nd btw , comparing catalonia 's economy and madrid , is more than a little unfair , ther economic outlook and composition is really different : https://sergicastanye.com/2016/07/11/diferencias-economicas-entre-madrid-y-cataluna/ and i have a question , why being different is being * superior * ? 
  a complex of superiority ? 
  where ? 
  in reddit ? 
  just because i consider myself as a catalan and my mother tongue is catalan does not make me * hate * a person from logro\u00f1o whose mother tongue is spanish just as i do n't hate a person from denmark whose mother tongue is danish . 
  why would i ? 
  why would i when half of my family , and most catalans , has roots in spain ? 
  maybe the problem is that spanish nationalism has not been able , for obvious and very tragic reasons , to deal with such differences `` everybody is the same with the same problems '' sounds perfectly natural to you , and that is alright , only that i do n't feel that way . 
  and milions of catalans do not feel that way . 
  and that is indeed a problem we are different societies living under one state , and that * should * be alright .
