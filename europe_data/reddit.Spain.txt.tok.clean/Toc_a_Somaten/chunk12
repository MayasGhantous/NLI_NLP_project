  to which end i can not tell , but it is certainly in its last phase . 
  the only thing that remains now is to clarify if there will be a unilateral referendum and then a declaration of independence or first the referendum and then the di . 
  off course i guess you will not like it , i probably would n't , but seriously , do not take it against me personally , it will not do any good beyond some self satisfaction , i 'm just one vote . 
  1st http://www.directe.cat/imatges/noticies/4-12.jpg the dirty war against independence goes on in all fronts , including the media . 
  the thing is the debate in catalan society is way past many of the things you can read in the press : on the `` foreign embassies '' of the autonomous communities , you can see the image of artur mas , yet andalucia spent double than catalonia in foreign representation ( being a much less internationalised and weak economy with little exports ) : http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2016/07/29/actualidad/1469747920_427935.html btw , comparing catalonia 's economy and madrid , is more than a little unfair , ther economic outlook and composition is really different : https://sergicastanye.com/2016/07/11/diferencias-economicas-entre-madrid-y-cataluna/ and i have a question , why being different is being * superior * ? 
  a complex of superiority ? 
  where ? 
  in reddit ? 
  just because i consider myself as a catalan and my mother tongue is catalan does not make me * hate * a person from logro\u00f1o whose mother tongue is spanish just as i do n't hate a person from denmark whose mother tongue is danish . 
  why would i ? 
  why would i when half of my family , and most catalans , has roots in spain ? 
  maybe the problem is that spanish nationalism has not been able , for obvious and very tragic reasons , to deal with such differences `` everybody is the same with the same problems '' sounds perfectly natural to you , and that is alright , only that i do n't feel that way . 
  and milions of catalans do not feel that way . 
  and that is fine . 
  we are different societies that vote different i hope we can understand each others point of view and i welcome the debate . 
  your comment is a little bit significative of the gap that nowadays exist between a great part of catalan society and well meaning progressive spaniards . 
  there is little black and white identities in catalonia , it is , after all , a society permeated by migration to a high degree , and with an identity that has adapted to it , something you can see in the fact that many ( maybe most ) of the independence support comes from second generation immigrants to catalonia . 
  also , catalonia is not a `` single people '' , i 'm always very surprised by comments like `` pp got an extra mp just after the scandal of jorge fernandez diaz , * in catalonia * '' , it just shows how little you know catalan society ( i do n't know where are you from , and i may be very ignorant of your `` region '' or `` nationality '' , but we are talking about catalonia now ) . 
  the pp vote in catalonia is the most hardcore unionist right , even far right , most of them consider themselves not catalan and spanish , but spanish * y punto * . 
  considering that c 's lost a lot of votes , and the natural transfer between pp-c 's it is normal that the pp took back some of those as a reward for the dirty war against catalan independence , which they saw justified ( its sad but true , this is not the uk ) . 
  and yet , despite their extra mp , the pp came out ** fifth ** , and they were lucky the cup does not participate in the spanish elections . 
  there is corruption in catalonia ? 
  off course , off course there is , as in any country where a political party has dominated the sources of power for almost two decades . 
  now , has corruption been used blatantly as a political tool against political adversaries , well , it has been demostrated that it was so . 
  as i said , in catalonia the independence movement has been quite sensitive to the issue , so much in fact that cdc has had to engage in serious reforms . 
  yet for a taste of what manipulation means , look at these graphics : http://www.elvallenc.cat/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/corrupcio-3-15-9-14.jpg http://www.directe.cat/imatges/noticies/3-16.jpg http://www.directe.cat/imatges/noticies/4-12.jpg the dirty war against independence goes on in all fronts , including the media . 
  the thing is the debate in catalan society is way past many of the things you can read in the press : on the `` foreign embassies '' of the autonomous communities , you can see the image of artur mas , yet andalucia spent double than catalonia in foreign representation ( being a much less internationalised and weak economy with little exports ) : http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2016/07/29/actualidad/1469747920_427935.html, 
  i should put an / s at the end of the sentence , then . 
  it was , evidently , an ironic way of being critical with the way many foreigners see spain , not an actual social commentary on the reality of the current spanish culture . 
  those `` vitriolic stupid stereotypes '' should offend you , as they should offend any spaniard who wants his country to be seen as something more than a sol y playa * siestaland * spaniards work longer hours and with lower salaries than most other western europeans , this is the real drama, 
  not even per % , the pp is just orders of magnitude more corrupt , to an ukranian level , pure cleptocracy , and all of it proved by tribunals , in catalonia the former ciu ( which no longer exist since 2 years ago , in fact nowadays cdc also does not exist ) is comparable , in corruption , to the socialist party of catalonia , which is still too much . 
  and btw , at least in catalonia corruption scandals have some effect . 
  pujol is ostrasized ( even his statue in his town was torn down ) , the party lost enormous support , and is diminishing at every election ( last ones were the 26j , and since the 20d they are the * minor * party in the pro independence alliance ) and most important , the party itself has been totally reformed , showing at least the willingness of many of its militants and leadership to clean up . 
  in contrast you have the pp , which well , just look at valencia , they had to create a * gestoria * to run the party there because there just weren t enough leaders and elected officials which werent being investigated , and that 's ** just ** in valencia . 
  let 's remember that the pp governs most of spain . 
  and also this , always this : http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wr-6yuwv9r8/ux2azk2zz7i/aaaaaaaako4/tj3yefq__jy/s1600/nazismo+puro.gif, 
  the thing is , the last train towards modernity for the spanish state departed in 1939 . 
  spain will never be a `` normal '' western european nation , franco took care of it to such a degree most people are not even conscious of, 
  tourous , sevilianas , sombrerous !!!, 
  you want more , there are more , many , many more, 
  the problem is that most federalists in spain live in catalonia , and even there right now this option ( federalism ) is not even the majority view . 
  federalism was in bad shape after the 20d , but the 26j was its death knell . 
  there is no one to federalise with . 
  i agree with the basics of your argument ; if spain had been ruled by a patriotic elite who really thought in criteria of efficiency and rationality , adapted to the reality of the state , spain would be a unitary state whose only federal units would be the basque country , catalonia , navarre , and if they really wanted maybe valencia and the balearic islands . 
  the rest could be perfectly managed directly by the center , and happily so . 
  but then , this is only a dream , and anyway it is too late now to really change things on this direction . 
  wait , spain is ... * proud * ??? 
  hahah , yes , soooo many things to be proud of just waiting for the third election in a row , won by the most corrupt party in western europe ( do n't let rampant poverty , chronysm , ineptitude distract you from that dying , drugged , stabbed bull ) camarerou , pour favour , mas sangraia , paelia , viva espaniaaaaa !!, 
  i do n't see many people in catalonia or the basque country defending spain from an invasion , in fact , depending on the terms of the invaders , the opposite may be true, 
  at least in the spanish case , i 'm sure you would get some extremely different answers depending where you ask ,, 
  i thought indiana jones killed the last of you guys ... 
  nice of you to bring up an article from 2015, 
  we had one armed organisation like that , and it did n't really worked out . 
  if you choose to use force , you have to go all the way , and understand that the whole society will suffer the consequences . 
  in our case it was decided to follow another line of opposition to spain , strictly pacific and democratic . 
  and to be honest , especially if you look at the basque situation right now , it is working much better for us this way . 
  let it go , let it go ... http://www.diariodemallorca.es/sociedad/2016/07/21/vacaciones-reyes-marcadas-agenda-politica/1135778.html they work so hard all the year , you must be angry that their * only holydays * are threatened by those pesky * politicastros * , right ? 
  maybe they 'll need an extra hand holding their towels , be a good subject and give the king 's household a call, 
  oh , jordi pujol , that great catalan patriot , always the independentist hero ( btw , did you know that he ceased his political carrer like 13 years ago , in 2003 ? ), 
  http://www.elplural.com/sites/default/files/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/pujol.jpg spain is ruled by a decadent , corrupt dynasty of monarchs who destroyed its empire and enslaved and murdered its own people , enjoy being their * subject * your dynasty you can not change it , you can not bring it to trail , it is even banned to shame them for their crimes i 'll preffer being a * citizen * of the catalan republic . 
  and i still would choose the * chance * to become the switzerland of the mediterranean to a decrepit posfascist regime lead by the most corrupt , decadent and dishonest dynasty in europe, 
  yeah , the last general elections were probably the last straw for spain to retain catalonia , the total failure of the podemos platform ( up , unidos podemos ) just destroyed any last hope of a negotiated referendum like in scotland . 
  now many catalan federalists who still wanted to give one last chance to spain are going to the independentist camp in droves . 
  the scenario that is getting more and more plausability now is a unilateral referendum of independence on the first quarter of 2017 . 
  we still do not know if the mechanism would include an unilateral declaration of independence just prior the referendum or after it ( it is complicated for foreign obvservers to understand , and by foreign i mean spaniards too ) . 
  the declaration of independence probably would require some massive act of civil disobeyence and pacific resistance with several hundred people taking the streets ( something catalonia has demonstrated capable of doing time and time again ), 
  i 'd vote cup , the * real * far left unlike those podemos monarchical posers . 
  but since the cup are so eu-sceptic ( they hate the eu , are looking more for a `` europe of united peoples '' away from all the bureacucracy and anti democratic structures ) that they do not participate in eu elections , i 'd vote for esquerra republicana de catalunya , so greens/european free alliance it is, 
  podemos is `` very leftist '' only because is very conservative , just look at the map of the last general elections and see it for yourself, 
  catalonia = noisy ( loyalist ) peasants, 
  the vall d'aran is considered as part of the occitan nation - with their own language and culture - by 99 % of catalan nationalist/independentists , and so whith all the right to self-determination no surprises here, 
  maybe the problem is comparing catalonia , scotland or quebec with bavaria or the riograndeses which do not have massive independence movements, 
  for legitimacy , a 73 % turnout , bigger than most general elections both in catalonia and in spain , its a big deal , and that is what the poll indicates , and its consistent with most other polls which , although they did n't asked directly , they indicated that around 80 % of catalans , regardless of political orientation , do support a referendum . 
  and actually it mades sense . 
  i would say there is a major perception issue regarding the 2014 `` participative process '' ( it was n't even labeled as a referendum ) . 
  yes the turnout may have been relatively low ( still 2.3 million out of around 7 million ) , but that was an entirely simbolic vote , and everyone was conscious of the fact it would have no legal consequences . 
  had the catalan government not backed down and had it announced it would be a legally binding vote , things would have been quite different . 
  what the catalan government is preparing this time is a full on legally binding ( from catalan law perspective , off course ) referendum where the results would be applied immediately , so indeed a much bigger turnout is to be expected since this is tuned with the will of most catalans . 
   you must be so naive ( x2 ) if we are to talk , can you drop the condescending tone / personal insults please ? 
  can you do that ? 
  thank you according to the spanish ministry of justice website : '' \u00bf c\u00f3mo se pierde la nacionalidad ? 
  so if the majority of catalans opt to ** voluntarily ** keep their spanish passports , how do they exactly will lose the spanish nationality ? 
  spanish law does not contemplate this scenario . 
  and this is only in the case spain recognises the independence of catalonia , which is something that you and me can agree will not happen for many many years , if ever . 
  if catalonia is not recognised by spain , how are catalan citizens to lose their rights as spanish citizens ? 
  catalan nationality will not be recognized by spain , so its passport ca n't count as a valid one . 
  for spain , those citizens will not have ceased to be spanish also , spanish law does not make you * choose * between one nationality or the other , it makes you announce you want to keep the spanish one and that is a big , big difference . 
  there are other countries that in some cases makes you choose ( i.e south korea with double-nationality born citizens , they have to choose the korean or the foreign one once they reach majority of age ) , spain is not one of them . 
   the rest of spain would continue to claim they are the same country as before , that they just lost catalonia i agree , and the catalan republic will also agree with that pov , i 'm sure , i do n't think there will be even talks on the `` successor state '' issue, 
  that means that if i choose to keep my spanish passport , it ca n't be taken from me since i am an `` espa\u00f1ol de origen '' according to the constitution , and so are most of the 7 milion catalans . 
  to do so would require a major reform of the constitution , and you know that the constitution was n't made to be reform . 
  are you sure that the majority of the parliament , the senate and the population of spain ( which would have to ratify the reform in a referendum ) would just agree to that ? 
  i seriously doubt it , i mean , there may be political parties and individuals just brooding for `` vengeance '' , but i do n't think that would be the majority of spain . 
  to do that the spanish constitution would have to be reformed , which is nearly impossible , due to the ardorous and broad majorities that would require ( majority in the parliament , majority in the senate , a referendum of ratification and so on ) . 
  it is a very different situation than chzeckoslovakia . 
  i do n't know if the poll is available in english , but the most interesting part is that if the catalan government goes ahead with the referendum , even unilaterally , the predicted turnout will be around 73 % , with the `` yes '' winning ( actually slaying it ) by around 60 something % . 
  there will be a boycott , but only by the most radicalised unionists , which are a minority in catalonia . 
  most people just want to vote , regardless of their sympathy towards independence . 
  politics apart , what kind of history are they teaching people in school these days ??? 
  catalonia was part of the ** crown ** of aragon , not the ** kingdom ** of aragon , which was a different political entity .
