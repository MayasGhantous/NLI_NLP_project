  thus catalonia and aragon had separate laws , institutions and parliaments . 
  the kings of the crown were proclaimed in saragossa , while the royal chancillery was in barcelona ( btw the massive archives of the crown of aragon are in barcelona to this day ) . 
  the ** kingdom ** of valencia and the ** kingdom ** of mallorca were also part of the ** crown ** of aragon . 
  if you are not spanish , i can understand its history may not be something you are very familiar with , in contrast with the scottish one , which is more widely known , but to make those comments on something you may have no idea about appear quite senseless to me . 
  when did the catalan institutions and laws became abolished ? 
  was it the product of a treaty ? 
  because this , i would say , is the main difference with scotland . 
  its because he knows there will be no consequences . 
  its a vital part of the psycgological warfare against independence ; to make your enemies aware that spain can do anything and they can do nothing . 
  in example , santi vidal did some declarations similar to those of margallo and all the press went for his neck , they were weeks talking about it . 
  now an actual exforeign minister makes even worse declarations ( basically that spain knows some huge , unknown favours for going against his own countrymen who knows where ) and barely nobody speaks about it . 
  he brags because he can and , just like witht the undargarin trial , the barcenas issue and so many others , he has nothing to fear, 
  `` socialist '' are from bernie sanders to the psoe to the cnt/fai they are socialists , but not `` marxists '' . 
  municipalisme democr\u00e0tic is one of the main ideological currents within the cup , hence the close ties with the kurdish confederalists ps : i said `` they '' but should have said `` us '' , since i 'm part of it, 
  the cup are not mainly marxist , but democratic municipalists/confederalists , with a huge anarchist element on it . 
  there are marxists and communist for sure , but they are not the majority , and to my understanding , rightly so . 
  marxism is for the * soft left * like podemos or barcelona en com\u00fa, 
  yeah because franco , an ally of hitler and someone who jailed , tortured and murdered hundreds of thousands of his countrymen is the same as some politicians legitimally supporting independence as a political option, 
  catalan : language catalonia : nation 's name, 
  sometimes i just ca n't get your flavour of sarcasm guys, 
  300000 then , still too few but not as bad, 
  absolutely , its just not worth the effort . 
  most of the people who get interested and engaged in the catalan debate are usually those that are ready to go make the * extra step * , which are generally few , but those who do , are outstanding individuals , and you just prove the point . 
  in catalonia right now there is many people which we can qualify of `` hardcore independentists '' ( so not just people who would vote `` yes '' but people invested in the independence movement ready to volunteer , to take an active part ) , maybe around a million and a half , which just will not go back , this is an extremely large critical mass of people decided to go to the finish line and to make independence possible . 
  yes , and your attempts at explaining the situation are really commendable , but well , i would n't waste any time , seriously . 
  you can see some of these people are either fanatics or just interpreting a role . 
  what does it matter what they think ? 
  they are gon na defamate us and the idea of independence wathever we say , wathever proof or reasoning we present . 
  we are going to vote and i 'm sure we are gon na win , because really , there is not much alternative , there is just not many arguments to vote `` no '' in catalonia . 
  we just need 2-3 % more of the votes to win and we are going to be many more , once the referendum campaign begins , because many people of the psc and the comuns/podemos area are going to vote for the catalan republic . 
  so what does it matter what these people say ? 
  yeah , they can say we are egothistic or even xenophobic ( this one makes me laugh so hard ) sobs , we know that in catalonia these kind of people are very few , and most of them unionist / far right anyway . 
  once we are independent we can explain our side of the story as equals as the spanish saying say , ladran sancho , luego cabalgamos, 
  the relations between catalonia and spain are not as amicable as england and scotland ( despite the bravehart jokes , there is no * hate * there ) . 
  behind some of the banter and jokes , there is * real hate here * , which will be promptly denied , but c'mon . 
  as i 've said several times , i 've been threatened by pm by other r/europe redditors several times , and other catalan redditors have too , it was a pleasing surprise to see that some of the spanish redditors with which we had disagreements regarding independence , however , showed immediate support , for which i 'm really grateful , it 's not black and white . 
  the fact that catalonia and the history of spain is virtually unknown among many redditors also have helped to invisibilize the conflict , and well , if you have something that you never heard about before ( catalonia ) confronted with a country that you already have a positive idea of , maybe you 'll tend to hear one side more than the other . 
  arguments like i.e catalonia is not a nation like scotland , catalonia was never independent , catalan nationalism was invented by some rich guy in the 1800 's ( yeah i know , but i 've read it here ) or the best , catalans are rich assholes that do n't want to share . 
  this also added by the fact that the catalan independence movement/debate basically only functions in catalan and spanish , and you need both languages and a knowledge of good sources to have somewhat of a unbiased pov which makes it all extra difficult . 
  just my opinion, 
  why do you even answer to that blavero nut ? 
  well this is something i believe will be hard to eradicate . 
  manipulation and not convincing is a main vice of politics , especially with history , as you said very well, 
  well , its supposed to be * european * languages, 
  you mean in total ? 
  that makes me sad :(, 
  yeah , actually many linguist put them in the same family : occitano-romance catalan and occitan were mostly indistinguible in the middle ages , and still are the nearest language respectively, 
  well , he 's a politician , not a historian . 
  if we get picky we will discover that even the famous `` marca hispanica '' ( which covered the area which would become catalonia ) never existed . 
  i do n't like the term `` propaganda '' used with the maps you linked though , why is it propaganda ? 
  because it is vilaweb ? 
  on the first year at the faculty of history many of the popular myths and legends are busted , but the disconnect between academia and politics remain evident through everyday life in the same terms , the `` reconquista '' never existed , who reconquered what from whom ? 
  the marriage of ferdinand of aragon and isabella of castille did not form spain . 
  all those are myths not supported by historic evidence , but as myths they are powerful for societies to imagine their past and origins and yes , a certain political vision of the state . 
  if vilaweb is propaganda , all the spanish press are , starting by conservative press like el pa\u00eds or el mundo . 
  money well spent , 
  i wouldnt say catalonia sees him as a foundong father but an importantly related person , nothing to do with spain, 
  andorra , its even on the national anthem, 
  please do not misunderstand me , off course you can do it , and no one ca n't tell youn anything . 
  i was just clearing the linguistic pov . 
  neither the valencian government , universities or the official valencian linguistic authority ( academia valenciana de la llengua ) consider valencian as a separate language from catalan . 
  no problem , 
  it was an / s comment ... valencian , like cuban or mexican , are not languages but dialects , at least from a linguistic pov . 
  i was critisizing the other redditor for mixing politics and linguistics, 
  from the article you linked : `` one of the main theories on basque 's origin is that ** it traces back to the language spoken by the early modern humans in the region . 
  ** '' finnish is much younger, 
  if you are going to include `` valencian '' you may as well include mexican , peruvian , cuban , ecuatorian , argentine , chilean and the others as well, 
  c'mon , you know better than to argue with blaveros he 's not interested in reasoning anything, 
  why did you left out catalan ( used by around 10 million people in spain ) and basque ? 
  honest question , i 'm just curious, 
  do n't worry , castellano is the same as spanish . 
  i really do n't get those debates of spanish vs castilian . 
  is the fucking same . 
  in some countries it is called spanish and in others castillian , but `` castellano '' is not a dialect , is the name of the whole language now of course there are many dialects in spanish but that is another matter . 
  and btw , it 's nice to see some reason , the main problem to talk about the catalan independence `` debate '' is to have access to all the info , which in our case is just not there for non catalan speakers, 
  from the spanish ministry of justice : - `` est\u00e9n emancipados , residan en el extranjero y adquieran voluntariamente otra nacionalidad . 
  if spain recognizes the catalan republic , then we can just anounce we want to keep the spanish passport , if spain doesnt recognises the republic , well , we do n't even have to declare anything since for spain we will still be full citizens ( catalonia will recognise the double nationality though ) so yeah , everyone who so wants will have double nationality , with the full benefits of eu citizenship . 
  personally i 'm thinking of voting pp once we are independent , 
  i said * proto * fascist ** and ** far right but in the case of lepen i think it is safe to consider her the heir of the petainist/colaborationist/paponist far right of france , which will make her , imo , a protofascist the dutch guy would be far right , not fascist , and the guys of ukip not even that , and trump absolutely not, 
   and catalonia will never be able to unilaterally decide it wo n't keep its part of the spanish debt then you have n't been paying attention that would be only in the case there is a negotiation , if catalonia is * forced * to keep its part of the spanish debt ( believe me , it is willing ) it means it is recognised as an independent state . 
  how can an unrecognised entity be forced to keep anything , much less when the debt titular is the spanish government ( the government , not the state ) ? 
  as you aknowledged , the flemish and catalan cases are very different , as economic grievances are just a part of it . 
   that 's an non-argument , if catalonia becomes independent speaking of a status quo of any kind in that manner is completely moot well , what will happen one minute after an hypotetical `` yes '' vote ? 
  will a frontier suddenly rise between catalonia and spain and france ? 
  tariffs will be automatically imposed ? 
  what will be the statutes of the citizens ? 
  after all everyone will have double nationality which entitles them to all the rights as eu citizens i would say it is not an easy answer such as `` doom and damnation '' or `` heavenly chorus '' . 
  the status quo will be mantained , for a while , while there is a negotiation . 
   at the end of the day fantasies of catalonian independence as a nation state is as much a pipe dream as the flemish one ok , nice to talk to you too, 
  whith lepen at the gates and protofascist/far right political parties about to get in power ? 
  it is more necessary than ever to have our own state , urgent even, 
  our case is very different from the scottish one , and seriously , i do n't see the point of many commentators comparing them . 
   i wonder why they 're persisting instead of fighting to change the constitution first unfortunately , the fact that we do n't speak english and are not inside the anglosphere means that covering the catalonia independence debate is very difficult for foreigners ( it is difficult for many spaniards already , so go figure ) . 
  to follow the constant debates , headlines , q&a s , demonstrations , parliamentary sessions , etcetc is extremely hard and time consuming . 
  i mean , changing the constitution , moving spain into a more federalised form and all of that is what catalan politicians have tried to do at least for 200 years , since the inception of the spanish state in the xix century . 
  catalanism in its origins was a spanish regenerationist movement . 
  the whole modern independence movement ( after being crushed in the 30 's ) began because the constitutional consensus of 1978 became broken . 
  how can the constitution be changed when catalonia only has 47 mps ( all catalan parties ) in a congress of 350 ? 
  also the constitution was written in such a way which made reform practically impossible , precisely to prevent such changes . 
   i wonder why they 're persisting because catalan independentists , which are a good chunk of the catalan population , including the political center , think there is literally no other way , none , this is why there is such a persistence , and that is why so many people , from all walks of life , are keeping it up .
