  but i also think that this situation would hurt espanya a lot . 
  catalonia is the 20 % of the spanish gdp , it has the main land routes to europe , the second biggest airport , the second biggest , most important city , a major port , and is the main generator of tourism in spain . 
  also , what if the catalan republic decides not to keep its part of the espanya debt ? 
  after all the debt is signed by the spanish government . 
  how can espanya avoid a default under these circumstances ? 
  yes catalonia may be hurt , but it will also be a smaller , more compact economy , while spain still will have to cater to its different , assymetrical autonomous communities . 
  i sincerely do not think that , in case of independence , espanya will choose an economic suicide like the one you are impliying, 
  the case is a little different here . 
  the main routes from europe to the iberian peninsula pass through catalonia , while scotland is relatively isolated from the continent . 
  the situation may hurt catalonia , but spain will hurt even more , without its second ( or first , depending on how one looks at the data ) airport , a major port , the main land routes to france and its main tourism income generator . 
  its in the best interest of everyone to keep the statu quo for a time in the event of independence . 
  why would spain commit economic suicide in the case of independence ? 
  what if catalonia chooses to not keep its part of the spanish debt , which after all is signed under the spanish government ? 
  seeing as things are going , i do n't know if the eu will be around much longer in its current form . 
  many catalans are becoming more euroesceptic as time goes by too, 
  ok , you may be the last person to know about that glorious `` y la europea '' ? 
  catalans in an independent catalonia would keep their european citizenship because european citizenship is linked to a member state citizenship . 
  since catalans will still have spanish citizenship ( unless you explicitely renounce to it , spain can not take away ) and so retain the european . 
  it will be weird because for a time , the catalan state may be out of the eu while its citizens remain ( because 99 ' 5 % will have double nationality ), 
  andorra has ... other problems right now * pobrets meus *, 
  pesetasdewhiskytorrente, 
  your patience and pedagogic spirit is truly commendable , especially knowing the kind of elements that roam around here, 
  i mean , back then , portugal and the netherlands were as `` spanish '' as catalonia or castile was . 
  the thing is that it was not the `` spaniards '' facing the `` moors '' , there was a far mor complex set of dynamics , as you have demonstrated to know well, 
   your version is the cartoonish one , in fact . 
  and why is that ? 
  you misunderstood me , i did n't told him his version was cartoonish because there was or was n't mingling ( kind of irrelevant due to the historically low number of arabs and north africans who made it to the peninsula , most muslims were , surprise surprise , descendants of converts ) but for his use of `` spain '' and `` spanish '' in the xv-xvi-xvii century and prior . 
  no , there was no `` spain '' in the xv-xvi-xvii century , much less prior to that , or at least there was as much spain as there was an italy or a germany . 
  spain was a geographical term , not a political one . 
  that was what i was characterising as `` cartoonish '' , the oversimplistic view of the political situation on the iberian peninsula at that time, 
   the moors never mingled properly in spain and in the end the spanish eventually decided to deport them back to morocco . 
  that 's some cartoonish sense of history you have there, 
  spanish govt = can take refugees in but it would n't catalan govt = would take refugees in but it ca n't what many catalans think = with an independent catalan republic we can take in refugees , with the spanish kingdom we can not, 
  thats why the demonstration was in barcelona , just * another * point were catalana disagre with the spanish government, 
  the guardian has one now too , although i have to be honest , i did n't know if posting it here would be allright . 
  if you put together `` catalonia demonstration '' and `` refugees '' someone in r/europe is gon na have a heart attack, 
  `` independence for catalonia '' * closes the bunker door *, 
   you are all 1 country just different culture or whatever give this man a nobel prize / s, 
  * i want to believe *, 
   i lived in cataluna for a couple of years so you understand spanish * and * catalan enough to follow all developements , all right then i get that you are using your strange spelling of catalonia ( it 's as if you are trying to write it in spanish while we are talking in english , and failing at the same time , every time ) to try to what , insult me ? 
  seriously , you lived here two years and do n't have a clue of what people feel and think ?? 
  ** cataluna belong to the spaniard and not the catalan ** are you aware that fran\u00e7a ( guess you do n't care i write its name in catalan , not relevant after all ) is different than spain ? 
  do you consider yourself a progressive/left leaning person ? 
  because what you 've just said could be easily mistaken by a far right supporter not only in catalonia , but in spain ? 
  you see , in spain many , many people consider their country as a multinational entity were different peoples live under a single roof ; this does n't mean these people support independence , just that they acknowledge that in spain there is a basque nation , a catalan nation , and others , including , off course , the people that feel `` spanish '' , living together in fraternity ; and the federalist pulsion goes in that way . 
  regarldess of the independence debate , the fact that so many spaniards think that way is kind of reassuring , and one of the main reasons i preffer to be part of that country than france , if given the choice . 
  and also , why does people with such meager information such as yourself try always to give such extremist ( nearing the fanatical ) remarks ?? 
  do you follow what is happening between spain and catalonia ? 
  do you read in spanish ? 
  in catalan ? 
  do you follow the permanent debates , the news , the plans , the interviews which are constantly on ? 
  also , do you think you really know how the french government will react ? 
  you know better than the spanish or catalan politicians who have a constant rapport with them at brussels , at the embassies , at the commerce delegations ? 
  i will be bold and say that you do n't . 
  this is not a debate you can follow in english with any degree of accuracy . 
  you can , off course keep trolling saying * `` cataluna '' belongs to spain and that 's it * , but apart from discussing with an stranger on the internet , this has no relevance at all ; very few people in spain think the way you do in the terms you do, 
  why do you write corsica in english and ( try and fail ) to write catalonia in spanish ? 
  that 's exactly what i was saying in my message , that if there is one country which would happily hop in on the repression with a smile on its face that would be france , we know it well . 
  thankfully there are other countries in europe and in our current times deadly force can not be used against peaceful protests asking for a referendum . 
  i think you misunderstood , i was saying france would turn a blind eye ** towards open repression against catalonia ** , which i 'm sure it will edit : this is r/europe , downvotes against pro-catalan independence messages are a given . 
  i do n't really care about some fake internet egopoints when i 'm talking about the future of my nation , but thanks for not being a jerk  ), 
  to be honest , while it still carries an influence , the opinion of the eu on the hypotetical independence of catalonia does n't carry as much weight as it did in the past . 
  also , the only way spain has of stopping the referendum would be mass repression on a turkish scale , but even then what ? 
  they can declare the catalan parliament dissolved , it does n't matter , it will convene at some other place , then what ? 
  and while i 'm sure some of the bigger european countries will turn a blind eye ( france for example , i bet they 'll even be happy about it ) there 'll be other that will not . 
  also spain is not exactly the strongest , most influential country in the eu , their resilience in front of an open mass democratic confrontation such as this is less than assured , mostly because its own citizens will not allow the current government to deploy its full force against catalonia . 
  there is also an extensive white book of the catalan independence which adresses many of the questions ( it is thousands of pages long if i recall well ) , it was ordered to an expert 's comitee a couple of years ago . 
  but the * how * independence will be actually carried out after a victory in a referendum ( hypothetical ) is a closely guarded secret , and whith good reason , since spain will not allow any kind of talk on inndependence and will jail anybody related to the plan immediately . 
  wow , rajoy is such a good strategist , the new alexander they call him, 
  monarchy in spain is way different than in any other european country , there is a reason greece and italy do n't have kings . 
  in spain the monarchy is seen by large parts of the population as the heirs of fascist era spain ( and with good reason imo ) . 
  another problem is that the monarchy , especially this royal family , is seen as foreign and hostile by many of the nationalities of spain , especially catalonia and the basque country , where the overwhelming majority of the population is openly republican and anti-bourbon ( regardless of independence feelings ) . 
  i appreciate your patience to answer the horde of spanish unionists that ponder around this subreddit , but i fear no matter how much you argue , they 'll keep it up , after all , some of them literally get paid for it : http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2016-12-20/caso-punica-alejandro-de-pedro-llamadas-cni-trabajos-antiindependencia-sumario_1306427/ http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20161220/412753175477/cni-imputado-punica-independentistas-catalunya-alejandro-de-pedro.html, 
   pretty much all the polls have independence winning that 's the main reason spain would n't agree to a referendum, 
   btw who the hell names that website like that , it almost sounds like `` the sons of a bitch '' i doubt it 's unintentional, 
   or are you an * english catalan aficionado ? 
  * ** the horror **, 
  well , personally i like the british anthems like god save the queen , rule britannia , land of hope and glory - especially these last two - much more than the marsellaise . 
  seriously kickass * and * coherent with the national spirit . 
  they called themselves `` little china '' and modeled all state structures after them , though ( mostly during the choson dynasty ), 
  start by disolving yours, 
  if by aragon you mean the aragon kingdom , yes , they got `` fused '' with castille , if by `` aragon '' you mean all the * crown * of aragon , then no , the `` fusion '' was never completed , as catalonia still exists , and is quite alive , and even has managed to retain part of its legal system . 
  i do n't really understand your vision of how history works though . 
  catalonia and scotland did n't just began to be assimilated into castile/england 5 centuries ago . 
  catalonia was `` independent '' even longer than scotland ( 1716 vs 1707 ) and then got annexed . 
  the catholic kings do not mean the `` fusion '' of anything , it was n't a political unification , it was a dynastic union . 
  you can delete the `` simply true '' of that phrase . 
  in 1550 no laws of castile applied to catalonia , no foreign armies were inside its borders . 
  catalonia did not fight in the wars of the spanish empire nor did it participate in the american , or any , of its conquests . 
  what `` fusion '' is that ? 
  history is far more complex than the history channel makes it appear . 
  haaha i do n't think i 'll be thinking about you five minutes from now , much less six or seven months \u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b, 
  i believe it 's on the general level of your comments , you do n't seem to go much higher than that, 
  and when did the fusing of england and scotland began ? 
  i would never dare to make those uninformed assumptions on a country i know next to nothing about , but hey if you are more like this guy : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkth6f1jfx8 your life , your choice, 
  well here the spanish nationalists and trolls have to moderate themselves a little , this helps, 
  being the only country on earth were * the man in the high castle * went true has its consequences, 
  actually i do n't care much about the political destiny of spain , it was just , as you said , wishful thinking . 
  my energies are centered on building the catalan republic so wether spain is governed by the pp , the psoe or vox i do n't really mind my apologies, 
   there 's even a special prague dialect !,
