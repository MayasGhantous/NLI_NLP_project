  c'mon , this is beyond pathetic already, 
  the first step towards having a non-franquist `` right '' is removing the source of their power and legitimacy the monarchy, 
  hitler was such a visionary , first the sudetes , then ... 
  too many years behind the iron courtain seem to have frozen some minds in your country shame, 
  ok so now tell everyone here what did you do with the unicorns, 
  yes , that 's what i was trying to answer . 
  the polls shows that in the case of a referendum more than 90 % of the people will accept the result . 
  the people most opposed to independence are usually older and with lower education , and normally have sentimental reasons . 
  this is not the baltic republics or kossove ; the catalan republic is mainly promoted as a way to a better life , and the independence movement is strictly democratic and pacific . 
  off course there are people against , but they have no reason to feel the state will be built `` against them '' ; that 's why most people is eager to accept * any * result in a hypotetical referendum, 
   and let 's see who will recognize the result that 's our business , and there are millions of catalans who are ready to risk it instead of staying like we are now, 
  spain is no federal state , not even close . 
  also you do n't seem to know the basis for the basque and navarrese fiscal treatement  because they managed to get a better deal , when negotiating with the ** federal government ** nice alternative history fanfic, 
  insulting is * his thing *, 
  first step = remove the monarchy see ? 
  a nice option for a spanish-wide referendum, 
   pujol has been the figurehead of independentism for a long time http://www.elplural.com/sites/default/files/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/pujol.jpg, 
  where the hell do you get your history ?? 
  did you know sherlock holmes was not a real historical figure ?? 
  catalonia was an independent country in the crown of aragon , with its own laws and economy and army and foreign relations , until 1716, 
  it usually only happens in r/europe though you can found trolls in other subreddits but the most vicious are right here ( more visibility / desired audience ), 
  catalonia is not an ethnic group the way it is in the balkans . 
  a lot of the appeal for an independent catalan republic is because of the form of the new state ( very progressive legislation , full welfare state , etc ) so many people who `` feels spanish '' are also willing to support it . 
  may the cu\u00f1ado be with you , my friends, 
  yes , off course , a nation is not a prison, 
   and by the way , even if the habsburg won the war of succession , i can assure you that they would have imposed something similar to the `` nueva planta decrees '' eventually . 
  yeah , and if the republicans had won the civil war would have done the same , and feminism is the same as machismo , and ... seriously follow this guy @cunadodetuiter , you have the exact same opinions, 
  very shameful , and i hope it was possible to discuss this issue with some normalcy . 
  i 'm not the only one threatened , other redditors have reported them too very glad to read your comment, 
  i did n't even know what the fuck were you talking about threatening , i do n't threat people over the internet ( or irl ) , all i did was answering a comment i found in this thread . 
  well , it was in a thread on `` infrastructure investment '' . 
  truth be told , once i called `` threat '' you had the grace to edit the comment immediately , not a criticism . 
   well i do n't think you are a terrorist sympathiser yet you called me on that terra lliure member . 
  if i had n't protested , here it stays , independence = terrorist supporters . 
   but your accusation and then answer makes me think ** you 're an idiot ** . 
  c'est la vie let 's shift back to personal insults , fantastique, 
  ok , so if no laws of castille applied in catalonia , catalonia paid no taxes to castille , catalonia did not participate in the spanish empire 's wars and the new emperors had to pledge the catalan constitutions ... what do we have here ? 
  `` autonomy '' ? 
  again , you can have the same chief of state and be independent nations , just like australia and new zealand . 
   does this mean you were accusing me of supporting what you sent me ? 
  yes !, 
  while i ca n't know wether you personally get paid for it but i assume that you agree with the methods used by the spanish government to try and supress / defamate catalonia independence . 
  the point ? 
  at least i 'm open about what i support , and without the need to stalk your post history, 
  are you seriously having this conversation ? 
  catalonia was a ** tiny ** part of `` aragon '' ?? 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/territorio_ramon_berenguer_iv-es.png population : mostly catalan ruling dynasty : catalan main language : catalan main city : barcelona and aragon does not exist any more ???????????????? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aragon also why do you keep confusing the `` kingdom '' of aragon with the `` crown '' of aragon ?? 
  they are different entities i keep saying it , if you know so little about a topic such as this , why do you keep throwing baseles arguments at it ? 
  you did n't even answer a single one of my questions, 
  yeah , they know they can get with anything here because almost nobody knows about us . 
  you can see their pattern quite clearly , a ) they first say something brutally ridiculous ( i.e catalans are neonazi sympathisers ) b ) then you rebate them with some facts from various sources c ) they shift to personal attacks to make it seems you , and you personally are unbalanced/crazy/extremist ( like `` i have many catalan friends , even independentist , but you are the most ridiculous/crazy '' ) . 
  d ) rebate with more data e ) receive threatening pm rinse and repeat p.s : oh , and i love the legions of `` norwegians '' / `` swedes '' / `` danes '' asking for the spanish tanks to roll over catalonia . 
  they could try some more believable `` persona '' hahaha, 
  first of all , if you are jon cobra , i loved your last video . 
  with that sayed , are australia and new zealand independent nations ? 
  do you need any mental gimnastics to understand wether they are or not ? 
  which aragonese laws applied in catalonia ? 
  are those mental gimnastics too ? 
  how come history is manipulated in catalonia and not in spain ? 
  do you have any proof ? 
  did isabel la catolica and santiago matamoros appeared to you in a dream and told you ? 
  the worst thing is that they get payed with * our * fucking taxes and i can feel it every time the check arrives . 
  thank oddin is 2017 , just a few months left of this camama, 
  did n't terra lliure got dissolved in 1995 or so ? 
  is this guy payed by our taxes to threaten people online ? 
  are you accusing me of being a terrorist sympathiser ? 
  you know who to call in these case : http://www.publico.es/politica/expolicia-juzga-titiriteros.html i 'm no pupeteer but i do support independence so ... same !, 
  catalans * and * the other peoples of spain, 
  what i do n't get is why someone that does n't really know much on a topic would make such outlandish absolute comments . 
  do you know anything at all about the history of catalonia or that of spain for that matter ? 
  i mean , you probably ca n't even read any material in spanish ( and i would n't even mention catalan , the main language in catalonia for centuries ) . 
  can you tell me which castillian laws applied to catalonia in 1612 ? 
  where is the difference between the dynastic union of aragon and castile and that of england and scotland ( i give you a hand and tell you i 'm refering to the 1603 union , not the `` acts '' of 1707 ) ?? 
  what was the nature of the crown of aragon ? 
  did catalonia had foreign relations , a state structure , something to hold on ? 
  yes , no ? 
  do n't know ? 
  why even make a comment on something you know so little about ? 
  precisely it shows that there are two peoples with different priorities , as exemplified by the political programs of the parties that won the elections, 
  their main argument is `` you are not a nation , you do not exist , thus you can not decide anything '' . 
  i have to say , though , that as agressive as these people are , it is not a reflection on how most spaniards think , there are plenty of them who see catalonia for what it is and also respect its independence , if the catalans so wish , even if it would sadden them . 
  mmm , personal attacks , well , at least this time you are not threateaning me , which is progress i guess . 
  btw , do you know this guy ? 
  please , refrain your cu\u00f1adismo , mr cloud , this is not forocoches . 
   the name of the war pretty much shows that haha , yeah , and the war of jenkin 's ear was a war fought just to reattach the ear to poor old jenkins . 
  the second world war was the second time the earth and mars fought , * it says it just right in the name * !!, 
  but on one account you are right , because as i 've said the annexation was not * during * but * after * the war , in 1716 . 
  catalonia , which was an state withing the crown of aragon , in 1670 was as independent as scotland was in the same year . 
  can you tell me which castillian laws applied to catalonia or valencia in the year 1620 ?? 
  i know they do n't teach you great many things about the history of spain in school , but there is no need to be outrageous or ridiculous . 
  catalonia was not an independent republic in 1650 , it was a constituent country of the crown of aragon , and independent in that framework . 
   i do n't understand why these people should be allowed to claim some part of spain is exclusively theirs the same way than in scotland in quebec only the scots and qebecois voted `` exclusively '' , not the uk and canada . 
  results in catalonia = yellow = unilateral independence/referendum purple = right to decide/referendum also , podemos ( purple ) is the only spanish party openly advocating for a true federal , multinational state . 
  it just shows different sociopolitical realities of spain , just as the brexit map did with scotland, 
  i 'm going to write this in english so anyone can read it if they wish . 
  do n't feel bad , seriously , several of the redditors here , wether openly spanish or `` foreign '' get paid ( with our taxes ) to trash us online : http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2016-12-20/caso-punica-alejandro-de-pedro-llamadas-cni-trabajos-antiindependencia-sumario_1306427/ once i even got threatened via pm by one of them . 
  people think this only happens in russia or china , but well , here in western europe we have out own paid trolls . 
  then there are lots of ignorance regarding catalonia , actually lots of ignorance regarding spain itself , which is not very well known in europe beyond the most basic points . 
  this ignorance regarding what spain is and how it is articulated is then used against us .
