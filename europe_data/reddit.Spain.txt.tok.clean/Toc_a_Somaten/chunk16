  until we are independent it is futile to try to go to a public forum like this and try to explain our point of view . 
  we are better off working every day for independence at home as we 've been doing it and then , as a state , we can explain our side of the story . 
  well , it could have been that way , but many people in catalonia believe it is more likely to have an independent state than spain changing towards a true federal structure . 
  i mean , just look at the map , the only place where federalism/confederalism has any traction is precisely in the places that have their own national identity http://www.abc.es/media/elecciones/2016/06/27/resultados-2016-2015--510x572-k1bf-u102640461143kog-510x572@abc.jpg, 
  well , i guess we may have a cultural difference , i do n't know if being on the other side of then iron courtain for so long had any effect on how people perceive democracy or even history . 
  also , this seems a very one-sided conversation , because you really do not seem to know very much about the topic of discussion . 
  `` any spaniard can move to catalonia without permission and then procced to vote ... '' do you even know what a ** census ** is ? 
  also you keep repeating baseless , ignorant ideas such as `` they 're just a regular province of spain '' again , quite wrong . 
  wrong because you know next to nothing about spain , which granted , it 's a quite unknown country to begin with , but still , you make quite a fool of yourself . 
  catalonia is not a `` province '' ; it is , as per the constitution of 1978 , a ** nationality ** of spain in the form of an autonomous community . 
  the constitution , while acknowledging that spain is `` one nation '' does makes a difference between the `` nationalities '' ( catalonia , basque country , galicia ) and the `` regions '' ( madrid , andalusia , extremadura , etc ) , but some of the autnomous community statutes ( home rule charters ) acknowledge their nationality as a nation . 
  and these are quite official documents , btw . 
  now , the issue is wether being a nation carries embedded the category of `` political subject '' , but this is another topic . 
  qualifiyng places you know nothing about in your absolute terms seem quite silly to me , . 
  please do not misunderstand me . 
  the situations * are * different , but not due to any kind of flattering circumstances on the part of spain . 
  the main difference is that in 1707 scotland got `` integrated '' in england ( yeah , yeah , let 's be pragmatic ) via treaty - i know , forced , wathever , still a negotiation - by which it mantained its institutions and its identity was mantained and respected by england , while in spain there was a forced annexation after the succession war , not a treaty , and all the laws , institutions , etc where abolished overnight , with very few exceptions . 
  the `` conquest/annexation/non negotiation '' part helps to explain how and why the basques and navarrese managed to keep an important part of their institutional structures and catalonia ( and the other countries of the crown of aragon ) did not . 
  this would be the basic reason of why both situations are different . 
  but still catalonia exists as a self-conscious national community ( more than 80 % of catalans think catalonia is a nation , as well as many spaniards ) , just as scotland does . 
  personally i do not see why spain can not see itself as a multinational entity , or at least as a `` unitary '' nation that just have a smaller nation attached . 
  apart from the basques and the catalans most other national reivindications are fairly diminutive . 
  so you deny catalonia is a nation ( just like scotland or the quebec are nations ) , which does n't really hold true . 
  i graduated in history from the university of barcelona , one of the best in spain and i ca n't tell you that to deny that catalonia is a nation ( in the same grounds poland is a nation or scotland is a nation ) is beyond ridiculous . 
  personally i would never make such kind of statements as `` you do not exist '' on countries i do not know much, 
  i 'm a history licenciado from the ub ( on the top 3 of spain ) , do i count ? 
  uooops , i 'm catalan , i 'll see myself out, 
  april 's 1st , 1939, 
  interesting thoughts coming from a state born just 24 years ago after being the richest , privileged region in their country, 
  according to 13tv you oughta be executed then, 
  no personal threats this time ? 
  evolution is such a great thing !, 
  as a holder of a spanish passport ( so a spanish citizen ) , thanks for minding our business . 
  it really says a lot of where have we arrived than obviously ridiculous statements such as mine are even allowed the benefit of the doubt . 
  thankfully with independence , which no amount of r/europe defamation can stop or influence , we 'll finally be able to tell our own version of history and vision of the world, 
  franco ?? 
  but he helped the catalans a lot , he ** built up their entire industry ** , because despite what some crazy nazi-onalist say , there was none before the war ( they were too busy prosecuting good catholic spaniards , raping nuns , and singing the caga ti\u00f3 song ) . 
  in fact franco got in power * because * of the catalans . 
  you should read more objective free press . 
  it seems that only get your facts from separatist press like la vanguardia or el periodico ( which even has a * catalan edition * , so you know its not neutral or objective ) . 
  instead in spain you have lots of variety to choose , el pa\u00eds , el abc , el mundo , la razon , la gaceta , el confidencial , okdiario . 
  they all have a very objective and disticnt editorial line , especially regarding the catalan independence process . 
  seriously , read more , get out of your small region sometime and embrace cosmopolitism as we do in salamanca , avila and madrid, 
  yes !!!, 
  that 's what no one one is admitting !!!!!, 
  not * even * a kingdom like great kingdoms of kent , of vingulmark , of galicia . 
  well , that just shows us that those medieval legal `` experts '' of catalu\u00d1a who were a bunch of ignorants since they only spoke in catalan - a minor , bastardised dialect of occitan , unlike the glorius and cultured languages of valencia , minorca , majorca and lapao - and a dead tongue called latin said that they got principality from the roman legal term `` principatus '' ( sovereignity / rule by the first citizen ) just as in the roman `` principate '' . 
  so now not only they are ignorant , but also a bunch of losers , rome , from all places !!, 
  did you know that the romans did not * even * have phones ? 
  i 'm not joking . 
  and i do n't mean * smartphones * , i mean those old wired phones with the poles , the cables and all that . 
  in spain ** there are ** phones , many , many phones . 
  so again , ** losers ** . 
  and i agree with all the historians that are honoring this thread by giving us their informed opinions ( i will also like to make a call to move this thread to r/askistorians , since so many are already here ) on how different is the region / portion-of-spain / municipality of catalonia from scotland , because everybody know that while scotland kept all of its state structures after the 1603 dynastic union with england , the crown of aragon and all of its nations ceased to exist on 00:00 am of the 14 december 1474 ( madrid time , taken at the puerta del sol atomic clock ) . 
  seriously , all the parliaments and local assemblies of catalonia , aragon , valencia , mallorca , etc just got together and close shop , burned their documentsts , their constitutions and legal books , vacated their administrative posts and went home . 
  i just do n't understand why are some assholes who claim different . 
  there is even ** a tv series ** on isabel the queen of ** spain ** . 
  i do n't see any tv series on the great empire of catalu\u00d1a !, 
  you do n't seem to understand , we can not be independent because 537 years ago there was a certain marriage were they stated clearly that catalonia did not exist and that everyone spoke spanish in catalonia anyway . 
  `` catalonia '' was invented in the xix century by some rich industrialist in his spare time because he was bored and wanted to pay less taxes anyway . 
  everybody knows that the idea of a united spain comes from the visigoths it 's all very very easy, 
  what was the status of catalonia in the crown of aragon ? 
  was it a region ? 
  too late , they surrendered already, 
  pst , pst , if someone wants to invade spain we here in r/catalonia are just gon na leave the door open when everyone 's asleep ... just saying, 
  that 's cheating , even i 'm bavarian during oktoberfest, 
  no need to trigger . 
  indeed italy is of german vintage . 
  germany were many little states ( and some big ones ) which considered themselves `` german '' . 
  piamonte and napoli considered themselves `` italian '' before unification , right ? 
  `` italiannes '' is a rara avis anyway because it is such an old , old , ooooold sentiment . 
  where are these states now ? 
  where is the two sicilies ? 
  where is pisa ? 
  do they see themselves as a separate nation to italy , as wales or scotland ? 
  this is not an insult , every country has its own history and identity . 
  italy was united succesfuly , and a national identity implanted-forged-created-wathever , just as in germany . 
  that was n't the case in spain , and the results are quite obvious . 
  unlike venice or napoli , catalonia still speaks , for the most part , its language and institutions ( especially in government / public administration ) and mantains its national identity , separated from the spanish one , to which some people adhere , and others do not . 
  and in the basque country more the less the same ( not with the language in their case , but the identity and to some extent the legislation is still their own ) . 
  there are also more than a dozen languages recognised in some form or another in spain ( also with their dialects ) i mean no insult to italy , i was talking mainly about the clear issue than in italy there is one `` nation '' recognised , just as in germany , while in the uk and spain , there are several , without demeaning spain or the uk . 
  how about the uk ? 
  what do you think of how they handle matters ? 
  what about the scottish region and the wales region ? 
  or are they ... nations ? 
  nations without state , which is a different thing from a `` region '' . 
  as far as i know in italy there are no `` home nations '' , excluding the handful of greek towns in the south and a few others , apart from sardinia . 
  nothing like the basques or the catalans . 
  in the basque country and catalonia around 80 % to 90 % of people there agrees they are a nation ( regardless of political opinion ) ; that does n't negate that in spain there is a `` spanish nation '' , off course , but it just indicates there is not a * single * nation identity but several ones that can exist independently of each other . 
  currently in spain things are changing and many people are leaning towards accepting spain for what it is , a plurinational state , where the different `` home nations '' are recognised and protected without room for squabble . 
  i 'll say that is very , very different from italy or france, 
  at least you admitted that you spoke `` from your point of view '' that 's a good start, 
  rita is alive !!!!, 
  i said `` most '' , there is always the odd exception ( like you maybe ? ), 
  most of the spanish people on r/europe then, 
  i think i spotted you in the first row, 
  this is not `` the main difference '' the main difference is spanish attitude towards the different nationalities of spain and the general ignorance about catalonia and spanish history and culture on r/europe, 
  yeah , it 's the `` new one '' compared to the original . 
  i really do n't like the blockish style of the new one ... 
  the new facade is extra shitty ( i see it every day ),
