  there will be people which will not want to pay taxes to the catalan republic ? 
  sure , a few dozen perhaps , just as there is some people now which asks for their children to be taught only in spanish , just five or six families in a country of seven milion . 
  the generalitat is the government of the nationality of catalonia , the central government is the government of the state , who has most of the monopoly of force . 
  in a conflict of legitimacies such as this , my personal loyalty ( mine and that of milions of people here ) is more important than your opinion , because we are the ones that will be called to defend our institutions when the moment arrives ( defend it by non-violent means , off course ) . 
  keep insulting though , that is super effective, 
  ah , but the thing is , according to all the polls , most people * will * go to vote , even if the referendum is unilateral , as long as the catalan government ** makes it clear ** that the results of the referendum will be carried out , wathever they may be . 
  an owerhelming majority will respect those results too what most people want , around 80 % is to vote anyway , this is why the spanish government is so anxious to stop any form of voting from taking place ; they ca n't stop people from going to vote if the referendum is held . 
  in catalonia there is not a situation of violence like the basque and n. irish cases were , in the eyes of most people here there is no problem with `` voting '' , the anomalous situation is that the spanish government would n't authorise it . 
  you clearly have no idea what you are talking about , you should really target someone else for your attempts at defamation . 
  jordi pujol `` respected '' by the independentist left ?? 
  hahaha http://barcelona.indymedia.org/usermedia/image/3/23abril.jpg https://operaciogarzon.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/no-als-judicis.jpg https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o8hhsg4fqh0/maxresdefault.jpg http://ddd.uab.cat/pub/cartellscedoc/1978/cartellcedoc_2688.jpg he was very respected by your fellow spanish nationalists ( banal or not ) : http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5056/5392851284_31386a376c_b.jpg ** `` en lugar de rebelarse y emprender una politica nacionalista radical el se\u00f1or pujol mantuvo serenamente su postura en ** favor de catalu\u00f1a dentro de espa\u00f1a '' ** `` spanish man of the year '' : http://www.elplural.com/sites/default/files/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/pujol.jpg yeah , the independentists loved him always and he was such a nationalist . 
  seriously , you just have no idea about catalonia , our history , our politics , and you just do n't care yet dare to comment on us, 
  i say we go for it, 
  most independentists considered him always an enemy of the nation , he was the main representative of the spanish right wing establishment in catalonia . 
  and we were right, 
  its the president * del gobierno * , not of spain . 
  he is , most accurately , the * first * minister in the government office . 
  the spanish government has rejected * any * referendum , a national one in catalonia or a state-wide in spain . 
  the independence camp has proposed a spanish-wide referendum , off course http://www.naciodigital.cat/lleida/opinio/6958/referendum/tot/espanya/no, 
  well thank you for your kind words ( sincere , not ironic ) . 
  i have a licenciatura on history by the university of barcelona , which has one of the best history faculties in spain , indeed it was quite shocking to discover some things that are partially assumed since our basic educational system is not very good . 
  that is why i understand your confusion ( like with the kingdoms . 
  a kingdom did not mean a country was independent or sovereign , many kingdoms were actually subordinate to other lords and some dukedoms were more important than kingdoms ) . 
  in medieval europe there were independent kingdoms , dukedoms , counties , principalities , empires and even republics . 
  some dukes commanded armies of tens of thousands why some kings could only muster hundreds . 
  first of all it would be better if you can be a little more accurate with your use of terms . 
  what do you mean by `` country '' ? 
  is the basque country a `` country '' for you ? 
  what about the `` pays catalan '' in france ( their government call it as such ) . 
  what about the historical denomination of val\u00e8ncia ; `` pa\u00eds valenci\u00e0 '' ?? 
  are all of those `` countries '' ? 
  as with any old nation , there is no clear cut answer to when it was formed or when it was fully independent ( more on that below ) , given that the concept of what is a nation , what is sovereignity and the rule of law , all change as the centuries go by . 
  basically the catalan counties , lead by the count of barcelona borrell ii were * de facto * independent from the roman empire ( called carolingian empire now ) when he stopped the vassal relationship with the franks , and * de iure * after the treaty of corbeil in 1258 . 
  as you can see the treaty of corbeil is more than a century after the formation of the crown of aragon ( a name which is disputed btw ) . 
  catalonia was sovereign , that is , independent , while it was in the crown of aragon , it has its own laws , parliament , foreign relations and interests , etc. 
  and that is normal , because the reigning dynasty was catalan ( the house of barcelona ) and identified as such . 
  aragon and catalonia were federated , not unified , just as spain is not unified with germany , just federated in the eu ( in fact the eu is much more centralised than the crown of aragon an even the spanish monarchy later ever was ) in example during the crusade against the crown of aragon in 1283 , the war was lead and suffered only by catalonia , since aragon officially refused to participate ( because the crusade was n't directed against , you know , their country ) . 
  so catalonia was fully independent , sovereign until at the very least the xvi century , after which its institutions and laws were slowly eroded ( which included a full on war such as the reaper 's war , known in spain as the separation war in 1640 ) until after the war of spanish succession in 1714 when all of its institutions and laws ( its sovereignity ) were abolished . 
  the thing is i do not understand why you would say `` catalonia was n't its own kingdom '' as if being a kingdom meant more sovereignity . 
  china was n't a kingdom , hell it was n't even a kingdom , it was an empire , a difussed entity which changed names every few centuries . 
  what about korea ? 
  a century ago it was called joseon , it had different frontiers . 
  what about wales ? 
  wales never was a kingdom , also ireland , it never was a kingdom . 
  do these mean these nations were not indepedent once ? 
  these peoples did not exist on their own ( not as part of others ? ) . 
  the same with catalonia, 
  i was meant to say that before making some comment such as the one you did before , you may first actually know a little bit what was the crown of aragon and how was it ruled . 
  yes , by `` legal and constitutional '' they are refering almost explicitely to the article 8 of the spanish constitution : ** the mission of the armed forces , comprising the army , the navy and the air force , is to guarantee the sovereignty and independence of spain and to defend its territorial integrity and the constitutional order . 
  ** as you can see , the spanish army ( the buddies of hitler who somewhat managed to survive ) had * somewhat * to do with the writing of the constitution back in 1978, 
  do n't blame him too much , most spaniards do n't know a lot about the history of their country , it would be the equivalent of all the english beleving that king arthur and the knights of the round table are not legend but strict historical fact ( yeah , there may or may not have been some kind of `` artorius '' or else but the dame of the lake ... damn ), 
  the thing is most spaniards do n't really know the history of their own country , i 'm serious . 
  its incredible the divide between what is teached in middle school and what is teached in university . 
  many myths such as the `` reconquista '' or the `` catholic monarchs unifying spain '' just did not happen or are blatant whitewashing of history . 
  the first year of university is almost dedicated to eradicating these kind of mistakes . 
  but why do you say that ? 
  - why do you always mistake the * kingdom * of aragon with the * crown * of aragon ? 
  - what was the crown of aragon ? 
  - how was it ruled ? 
  - where was the dynasty which ruled it from ? 
  - what was the status of catalonia within it ? 
  - which laws governed there ? 
  - how did they identify themselves ? 
  wales was never `` a kingdom '' , ireland neither , germany neither . 
  luxemburg too , and many others, 
  the constitution states that catalonia is a ** nationality ** of spain , in contrast with a * region * , and that all organise as comunidades autonomas . 
  in fact all of the psoe and podemos `` plurinational '' proposal pretend to build on this fact to move spain further into a federal model . 
  the tanks would have to run over soooo many people in the streets to reach the ballot boxes, 
  seriously do n't waste your time answering this nut , he always try to `` rally the crowd '' against any comment he does n't like . 
  he even threatened once ( he apologised later after there was quite a little ruckus ) . 
  i would block him but do n't know how to do that in reddit, 
   i do n't get your point here ... 
  i think his point is very clear , we do n't exist , the catalan people is just but a fantasy unlike the * real * people ( spain ), 
   catalans are as much spanish as anyone else on the peninsula let 's forget about portugal , andorra and gibraltar your supremacism is so adorable, 
  you can see how it is , they just do n't recognise us to be our own people , i support independence if only for that fact . 
  their point of view was born from the military victory of the fascists in the civil war . 
  one , immortal spain , thousands of years old . 
  everyone is entitled their own opinion , but when you deny the very basic right of a people , a nation , to exist , that is where i draw the line, 
  well thanks !, 
  to be honest though , its understandable that many people just know no shit about us or spain on that matter . 
  the problem is that spain is not the uk , and many spaniards , not all but a majority on reddit and on this subreddit in particular just deny our right to exist , not independence or sovereignity or else , the basic fact that we are our own nation , so you have those massed downvotes and defamations . 
  personally it does n't really bothers me , who cares what they think , we are gon na have a referendum and they ca n't do shit about it in the real world . 
  its not only about catalonia , but pretty much , yeah . 
  40 years of brutal fascist brainwashing , and i mean fascism with a capital `` f '' , not `` god save the queen , the fascist regime '' . 
  basically the spain we have now is the direct descendant from the regime which won the civil war and instaurated one of the most brutal dictatorships in european history , worse than anyone in eastern europe save russia . 
  around 200 thousand dissappeared between 1939 and 1978 , milions of imprisoned and tortured , thousands of babies were stolen and the catholic church was allowed to instaurate an educational system based on physical and psychological violence . 
  women were basically reduced to the state of domestic servants and lost any right they gained previously , such as the right to vote ; they could only work with the written aproval of their fathers / husbands , even if they were 40 years old . 
  this contrast with the advanced educational system from before the civil war . 
  and since in spain , unlike countries such as portugal , there was never a clear break with the past , you have contemporary spain , where the descendants ( both political and physical even ) of the dictatorship still have huge influence on every aspect of life , even after many years of social democratic rule . 
  well , most of the people that oposes the referendum openly denies our right to exist as a people , catalonia is just a recent invention created to get money from the spanish state , acording to them, 
  have an upvote an a hug from my part, 
  here , take my upvote, 
  no there is none , and in any case to change this extremely important law a constitutional change would be needed , which would be totally impossible, 
  ok change the baby for a bullfighter, 
  i can almost see puigdemont , junqueras , pedro sanchez and pablo iglesias in some deep dungeon conspiring against the unity of spain while they sacrifice some babies in front of a menorah and a bust of lenin ... scary stuff, 
  which would be the mechanism to retire the passport from 7 milion people ? 
  because according to the current nationality law a spanish born citizen , or one born from spanish parents can not in any way be denied the spanish nationality if they express the intention of keeping it, 
  interestingly weeks ago there was an international seminar of communist parties in mexico and all of the assistants ( from lots of countries ) signed a proposition advocating to celebrate and respect a referendum in catalonia ... including the chinese communist party , which is kind of a big deal . 
  here you have a source , it is a far right one , but it 's the only one i could find in spanish from the anti-referendum camp http://cronicaglobal.elespanol.com/primeras-planas/comunistas-china-cuba-y-venezuela-referendum_70670_102.html, 
  i know i should n't but i 'm gon na tell you that i 'm relieved that at least you do n't threaten me anymore and limit your insults to `` you separatists '' .
