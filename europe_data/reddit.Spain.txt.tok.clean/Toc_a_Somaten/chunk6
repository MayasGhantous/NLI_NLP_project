  hheeeh , qsqep is neither `` no '' not `` yes '' , its leader , rabell has said so himself a few minutes ago over in the radio . 
  without qsqep the yes camp has won both in votes and mp 's . 
  there is no violence in the streets , friends remain friends , i 'm right now congratulating a c 's friend for their results by whattsapp seriously , if you are spanish you are really misguided on how things work over here . 
  77 % participation and independentists won , this is a huge victory, 
  right now , the would be `` kingmakers '' ( cup ) speaker , antonio ba\u00f1os : `` avui \u00e9s la nit en qu\u00e8 tot comen\u00e7a , la ruptura i la desobedi\u00e8ncia . 
  aquest proc\u00e9s no t\u00e9 aturador , nosaltres no ho aturarem , som l\u2019accelerador '' `` tonight is the night where everything begins , the rupture and the disobedience . 
  this process can not be stoped now , we will not stop it ( on the contrary ) we shall be its accelerator '' `` a partir de dem\u00e0 mateix la legalitat espanyola ha de ser desobe\u00efda . 
  catalan citizenry will disobey any laws made against it . 
  from tomorrow on , we govern ourselves '' i think it is quite clear how things are gon na pan out , at least from the independence camp, 
  right now , speaker of the cup : `` mas will not be president , but there will be independence '' no independentist consider mas a take it or leave it issue , we only care about independence with mas or with another one , the important thing is declaring independence, 
  do you mind if i answer in english ? 
  i know mine is not the best ( far from it , writing in a smartphpme in the rain is also not good for accuracy ) , but maybe it will be more comvenient for everyone here . 
  yes , the cup defends the concept of pa\u00efsos catalans , which include the catalan speaking areas . 
  i really hope your question is in good faith , but rising the question of `` ethnicism '' when the cup is the most radically antiracist party in the whole iberian peninsula does seem a little provocative . 
  catalonia is a culture , not a race , no matter white , black , chinese or else , no matter where your parents come from , if you choose to be catalan ( you respect the language , you feel part of the broader culture , etc ) you are catalan then , your choice . 
  and that is what the cup defends . 
  the pa\u00efsos catalans are the area native to the catalan language and culture , with its variations and differences which are all equally valid and rich . 
  there is a lot of misunderstanding and people that equal the ppcc to the basques and navarre , which is not the case . 
  valencia , balears , northern catalonia have to choose their own destiny , wether is a closer relationship with catalonia ( or among themselves ) or not . 
  their people are the ones who may decide that , not catalonia . 
  the `` votes '' problem is not a very deep one . 
  both jxsi and the cup have independence and self determination as their most important point on the 27s elections . 
  several members of the cup have indeed stated that winning by `` votes '' is very important to the independence process , but the reports that this means a precondition to a supposed jxsi lead majority government are not true . 
  the cup has stated very excplicitely that whichever the case , they will not be a rock in the way towards independec , they will never `` betray '' independence by having `` take it or leave it '' stance , but they will negotiate . 
  in fact the cup , more so than jxsi is for a unilateral declaration of independence and have directly atated that if they are the ones that win will declare independence on 28s written from a slow ipad :(, 
  it is good that most of the wackos are here on reddit and not out in the streets , stay safe and be sure to eat lots of doritos and drink lots of 7up, 
  of course the milions of people in favor of independence , including reputed economists and ir experts are total fools and that is why they support independence . 
  the spanish pm begs to differ ( english subtitles ) : http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticies/el-video-de-rajoy-a-onda-cero-subtitulat-a-langles/, 
  the thing is catalans will not lose their eu citizenship because even in the case of a unilateral declaration of independence , they 'll still be spanish citizens ( spanish passports ) unless they willingly renounce to the said nationality . 
  spain has no provision to strip the nationality from an unwilling spanish-born citizen , so from day 0 catalans will still be able to hold onto their spanish passports as normal . 
  on the issue of double nationality , that is something that can be done unilaterally by an independent catalonia government , and does not need to be negotiated with spain, 
  we 'll decide how to spend our hard earned money , i was against entry in the eu from the beginning , although the proindependence movemente has been very proeu until very recently, 
  catalonia is a net controbutor to the eu by 1355 milion euros, 
  yes , and now it is very probably too late for that , society here is very , very mobilised for the `` yes '', 
  i hope it too , the best solution would be a negotiated referendum , but who knows , things are looking bleak in this way, 
  there is no provision to strip an unwilling spanish citizen from his/her passport , it all depends on the individual will of the citizens . 
  so yeah , catalan citizens will still be spanish ( and most important , eu ) citizens , and enjoy all the benefits of its passport , on day 1 of independence , and spain ca n't do nothing about it . 
  the spanish govt will instantly lose 16bn euros a year and seriously , it will be very difficult to mantain a `` business as usual '' approach with an uncooperative local administration and citizenry . 
  spain cant send the army this time, 
  and that is for * former colonies * , can you show me where does it says that spain can take the nationality from people born in spain that * already have the nationality * ?? 
  will spain strip spanish nationality from the people that voted no to independence ?? 
  how would they discriminate ? 
  will spain change the constitution just to fuck the catalans ? 
  will the spanish government have the political capital to do it ?? 
  seriously doubt it , spain has no provision to strip the nationality from spanish born citizens . 
  you do n't really get it , do you ?? 
  it doesnt matter wether spain recognises double nationality or not , catalonia will , and that is enough in this case . 
  spain will only recognise the spanish passport catalan citizens will hold ( since for spain catalonia will not exist , its citizens will still be counted as spanish as it is now ) , with all its benefits , and that is all catalan citizens will need to live , travel , made business and even vote in spain , as they do now . 
  the catalan republic will issue passports that will be recognised in catalonia and in all the countries that recognise catalonia , independently of what spain does . 
  catalonia will off course accept double nationality with spain which is all it takes for the concept to work for catalan citizens, 
  haha , no . 
  first of all people from equatorial guinea and western sahara born during the colony times can still claim spanish nationality . 
  even descendants from spanish latin american migrants can ask for spanish passports . 
  the thing is if spain does not recognise catalonia but catalonia accepts double nationality ( which it will ) catalan citizens will still be spanish citizens for spain and thus have legal access to their passports and all their benefits . 
  spanish nationality laws do not allow for it to be stripped from spain born citizens . 
  i also think there will be an express membership process , or at the very least a treaty that leaves almost everything as it is now , it is really not in the interest of the eu to just isolate catalonia, 
  the thing is , to expel catalonia , first the eu ( and spain ) have to recognise it as a state . 
  also , from day one , catalan citizens will still be spanish citizens ( they 'll hold spanish passports ) and thus they 'll hold eu citizenship with all the benefits . 
  also i 'm not really sure the eu can stand to suddenly lose a 200 billion euro area with an economy that actually works ( unlike greece ) , with some critical infrastructure like the port and airport of barcelona . 
  and if a north korea-like catalonia would be bad for the eu , a walled off area in the middle of the eu , without contact or treaties with no one ( that would be a first ) , how bad would it be for spain ? 
  how bad would it be for spain to suddenly lose 20 % of its gdp , its main port and airport and land connection with europe ? 
  even with catalonia ostrasiced and marginalised , it will still lose 7.5 milion people , considerably altering its position and bargaining power within the eu ( european parliament mp 's , reduced economy , etc ) , and if we talk about the debt ... well , it will have to take it * all * on its own , which is quite untenable at the moment . 
  just with a little negotiating all of those dire consequences can be avoided , and that 's what i think will end up happening . 
  `` catalonia has never been an independent nation '' just like wales , right ? 
  that 's what the catalans are asking for , not the death penalty, 
  when have i said anything about who will win ?? 
  i was just making the point of mas being the candidate , go buy the lottery tickets you want and discuss it with the ticket seller he will be president in case jxs has absolute majority antonio ba\u00f1os has make it clear the cup will not make him president, 
  do n't get why you use `` jaime '' in english when you could use the catalan ( jaume ) or aragonese ( chaime ) name , he wasnt a castilian king after all , although the most correct would be to use `` james '' , if you are writing in english . 
  `` spain '' as a nation did n't exist until the very last moments of its empire ( 1812 ) , the `` catholic monarchs '' ( ferdinand and isabella ) did not create `` spain '' in the xv century , just as the english and the scots did n't created the uk in the xvii century . 
  from a previous comment of mine i give you some explanation on how was it so : only that ferdinant and isabella did not actually create an unified kingdom in 1475 , what they did is a `` dynastic union '' , just as the english and the scots did in 1603 . 
  both the kingdom of castille and the crown of aragon keep existing under the same dynasty from then on . 
  the political entity ( spain ) did n't exist , the national conscience of `` being spanish '' , as it would become later ( a unifided , coherent idea that all of spain is one and only culture with one language etc ) did n't exist either . 
  back then , `` spanishness '' was , just as `` britishness '' , a geographical definitory term . 
  there had been already instances of iberian rulers using the definition `` empire of spain '' or `` empire of the spains '' already from the x century onwards http://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/2244055.pdf in the british islands there had also been a title coveted my many early kings , `` bretwalda '' ( ruler of britain ) , which did not mean they controled all of britain , or that there was a common british identity at the time https://www.questia.com/magazine/1g1-16416807/the-making-of-england in the concordia de segovia ( 1475 ) both kingdoms debated and reached a conclusion on how was the united monarchy going to govern , specifically by reassuring the position of each monarch on their states . 
  ferdinand ( ferr\u00e0n in aragon ) and isabella became consort king/queen on their spouses nobility ranks , although ferdinand was very ambitious and did try to have his say in the governing of castille while blocking isabella 's access to aragon . 
  although , hernando del pulgar an historian from the xvth century relates that on 1479 the royal council determined not to use the title of `` kings of spain '' because of legal problems . 
  in this article you can find the actual text of the concordate : http://www.google.es/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0cdwqfjac&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fdialnet.unirioja.es%2fdescarga%2farticulo%2f2127860.pdf&amp;ei=ahldvzhpi8mo7abrkocydw&amp;usg=afqjcnhkusq_xnrdx1qdvdpsovq_exwrug&amp;sig2=yjwb_mpnq7tk6hs1bugjta&amp;bvm=bv.92189499,d.zgu&amp;cad=rja `` platicose en el consejo del rey y de la reina c\u00f3mo se deb\u00edan intitular ; y como quiere que los votos de algunos de su consejo eran que se intitulasen reyes y se\u00f1ores de espa\u00f1a , pues sucediendo en aquellos reinos del rey de arag\u00f3n eran se\u00f1ores de toda la mayor parte de ella , pero determinaron de no hacerlo e intitul\u00e1ronse en todas sus cartas en esta manera '' as you see , this was a minority ( at least not a majority ) of people in the council that thought this way , the fact was that the crown of aragon and the `` crown '' of castile were very , very different political-administrative realities that were not easily united . 
  the article clearly states `` la intitulaci\u00f3n pone de manifiesto que fernando e isabel rechazaron la idea de fundir en una \u00fanica corona de espa\u00f1a las de arag\u00f3n y castilla '' spain as a national entity took time to christalise , on the basis of the kingdom of castile , which gave it its language and most of its culture , it did not began in 1469 . 
  the personal/dynastic union treaties were a clear attempt to keep each entity separated under a single monarch . 
  different kingdoms with different administrations , laws , languages , etc. 
  and it was to be this way until 1716 and the dismantlement , abolishment of what had been the crown of aragon . 
  the americas were an exclusive castillian enterprise , and foreigners were excluded ; that meant that not only the english , the french and the italians ( in a geographical sense ) were excluded , but also the catalans , the aragonese , etc. 
  the basques/navarrese were an exception because they were forcibly annexed by castille in the early xvi century and did participate in the colonial expansion , including the philippines ( discovered/conquered by legazpi , a basque ) . 
  unfortunately , being under castillian influence meant they had to abide by castillian laws and their language policy , also basque language at that time - unlike catalan , which was the official language of the crown of aragon 's catalan , valencian and balearic states - already had a hard time surviving outside the little villages , so the language of colonies was mostly castillian ( aka spanish ) . 
  p.s : please do not mistake the `` kingdom '' of aragon for the `` crown '' of aragon . 
  the kingdom of aragon and the principality of catalonia were , along the kingdom of mallorca and the kingdom of valencia ( among many others ) part of the crown of aragon , which was more of a federation-confederation of states, 
  the catalan state will have the same administrative limits the current autonomous community of catalonia has, 
  artur mas is the candidate , romeva is the electoral list chief i know , it is weird, 
  just move again a few hundred kilometers west to saragossa problem solved, 
  herp derp still butt-hurting all the way from omaha, 
  barcelona police did , its actually the third year in a row with massive ( more than a million ) demonstrators , so i think they are getting better at counting . 
  last year we counted ballots and it was closer to two million votes in 2013 we got the 400km human chain and made a `` gigafoto '' of everyone and it was around a million and a half too, 
  well , it was called via lliure ** a la republica catalana ** , dont know how much clearer can you get . 
  non independentists ( including pro-referendum , federalists , confederalists ) didn t went this time . 
  romeva is just one person in a broad coalition , the president will still be artur mas, 
  i saw it too and really , inwas disappointed with sackur , he was didnt do his homework informing himself on the catalan independence issue . 
  in example , he cited francesc de carreras as an * unbiased * economist , when in fact de carreras is heaviky involved in the unionist camp , has been for years , even giving his support to far right associations like societat civil catalana and spanish nationalist parties ssuch as c 's . 
  he normally writes in very , very right wing newspapers too . 
  some of the best economists in the world are catalan , and independenstists , such as xavier sala i martin and francesc mas collel ( finance minister of catalonia , btw ) . 
  mr shackur seemed to have informed himself from a very narrow pool of data , which was a little shocking , and mr romeva was probably a little shocked too , since we ve moved on from such kind of questions ( discussed for years in catalonia ) .
