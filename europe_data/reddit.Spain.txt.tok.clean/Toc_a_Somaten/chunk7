  ~ ~ spanish ~ ~ kingdoms * iberian * kingdoms the concept of spain didnt exist back then, 
  im always amazed by how audaciously ignorant some commenters on catalonia/catalan culture are . 
  if you know nothing about catalonia , why comment at all ? 
  catalan is spoken by more than 10 million people in spain , france , andorra and italy , it has a huge presence ( and i mean huge , compared to the population ) in the internet and is one of most translated languages in the world ( 22nd in 2012 , which is huge considering how many languages are in the world ) . 
  catalan literature is big , big enough as to be invited to the biggest fairs in the world ( frankfurt ) as a `` host culture '' , etc. 
  we have films and music industry , etc. 
  seriously , i wouldnt dare to speak with such bold despise about a culture i know nothing about , much less when is a major one not that far from my own country, 
  correction , the stupidity is * very * strong in this one, 
  `` vasc country '' '' * region * of aragon '' did n't knew rajoy was a redditor, 
  or maybe it just he did n't wanted to be an asshole ( he was n't in any case , btw ) * t\u00edo *, 
  its more like the catalans * and * the spanish are both repressed by spain my opinion, 
  it would n't be the first time for catalonia, 
   look , to me , spaniards is not a single thing . 
  you got basques , and canarians and galicians and extremadurans , and yes it includes catalans as well my point was that you said catalans and castilians were undistinguishible from one another , my bad if i understood it wrong . 
  and off course aljubarrota is more important to you than 1640 , as are the napoleonic campaigns , etc. 
  there are jerks and trolls everywhere , including here ( especially here , in r/europe i would say , sometimes it looks like the stormfront forums ) but i can tell you that most catalans feel towards portugal the same you feel about us . 
  spain , france , italy germany and the uk are our most pressing concers almost always , and the places we have the most relations with , both business and else , so any catalan throwing shit to portugal ( there are stupid , classist people everywhere ) because it is `` poor and sad '' or similar nonsense are just but a minority of the total . 
  and the same goes towards bashing the portuguese language , which is a romance language just as ours . 
  we are indeed quite far removed from each other , and we also live with our backs to the peninsula , looking to the sea ( barcelona is the main city in catalonia by far , like half the population live there almost ) , we do n't figure ourselves an island but we do have more trade with other nations beyond the peninsula than within . 
  and oh , yes we are going to sort it out really , really soon . 
  the `` show me your id card '' trope ? 
  in the xxi century globalised world ? 
  not even the most nationalist spaniards say that nowadays . 
  what if i go to portugal and natuiralise portuguese after marriage ? 
  would that make me portuguese ? 
  at home and with my wife and friends i 'll still speak catalan , and i 'll feel like a catalan who lives in portugal , same happens with many inmigrants all around europe and the world like now . 
  a passport is just a document which can or can not be coherent with the person 's identity / self identification . 
  as i was telling to you , even if i naturalise portuguese i would feel different than you , born and raised there , in this sense , the `` born and raised '' and above all , the * choice * you make to believe every day you are portuguese is more important than what your passport says . 
  what about a 29 y/o person from the chzeck republic ? 
  the country they were born in do not exist any longer , and the name and shape of their `` nation '' have changed names and shapes lots of times , yet they remain chzeck , only this time their passport nationality/identity matches their passport , same with the koreans , and the poles , and many more peoples . 
  even now , in the age of migration , how does holding one passport of the other makes you what you are * automatically * ? 
  look at how many problems france had to make a great part of their population `` actually french '' ( not talking only of the migrants here ) . 
  if you identify 0 % with the passport you hold , that does n't makes you much of a citizen , in fact you become more a liability than anything else . 
  this is the case with milions of catalans , ready to jump ship at the first opportunity . 
  the fact you consider us `` the same as spanish '' does n't say anything beyond your level of knowdlege , yes , we are not an atlantic people , we are mediterraneans ( most spaniards are not mediterranean either ) , but we are a distinct people , just as the scots are from the english ( and they do n't really have a thriving language to rely on ) . 
  many catalans also do n't really see the difference between the `` central spaniards '' and the portuguese ( poorer , sadder castillians ) , and that it is a really stupid misconception , born of ignorance , the same some portuguese harbor on catalonia . 
  i never thought `` you owe us '' , or anything , if anything i congratulate you for succeeding where we failed , and i 'm an actual historian . 
  what i do n't get is the despise of our country ( if you even consider it a country ) , but i have to admitt you are not the first portuguese i 've met ( or discussed with ) which think this way . 
  the spanish constitution recognises the fact we exist ( we are a `` nationality '' vs `` regions '' such as andalusia or extremadura ) . 
   meh , they are all spanish , let them all sort it out among themselves now now , no need to be rude here, 
  we allowed the french invasions ? 
  catalonia was already annexed to spain by then ( or more exactly to castille , spain came after that ) . 
   that wo n't stop them as long as they can blame madrid . 
  catalan people seem to buy that accusing millions of people of `` buying that '' does seems a little insulting, 
  i tried to find several articles , i have to say that i 'm dissappointed at how vicious some of the attacks on this thread were on a situation most redditors here knew nothing about . 
  i would n't assume that in a european region with zero far-right/neonazism suddenly millions of people went mad . 
  the comments on people just calling catalonia `` a region '' were especially laughable , the spanish constitution recognises catalonia as a `` nationality '' , i do n't get the viciousness .

  http://www.wilson.cat/en/missio.html a collective of about 12000 professionals , especially economists and political scientists who also support catalonia independence and try to contribute to discussions on the topic , i 'm sure you can find lots of relevant information there, 
  actually it was * after * the civil war , when germany conquered poland in the first blitzkrieg attacks the spanish fascists started to joke that they conquered `` their poles '' ( the catalans ) as fast as the germans conquered `` real poland '' . 
  oh nazis and fascists , you so funny  ), 
  interesting ... 
  well i 'm pretty sure we do n't see polls because the independentists are winning by far, 
  http://www.insurgente.org/index.php/template/politica/item/14491-entrevista-a-david-fern%c3%a1ndez-cup charnegos everywhere !!, 
  http://blogs.elconfidencial.com/espana/palo-alto/2013-03-16/el-independentismo-esta-cuajado-de-lsquo-charnegos-rsquo_402862/ most of the people you call * charnegos * are independentists , seeing you trying to manipulate and deform reality is laughable, 
  do we have to change its name because some countries , like spain and germany turned out nazi and/or fascist ?? 
  nevermind here too , do n't think we are going anywhere . 
  and after all i do n't care , we will vote the 27s and if we win we will leave all of this pointless discussions behind, 
  again , copy & paste andorra 's example is pretty important in this case , as i 've already stated , the sometent in the catalan legislative tradition is a ** people 's militia for defense of the land ** . 
  under spanish law it was revived only in name and in a very limited scale as a rural police force . 
  the mossos d'escuadra were n't chosen against the sometent , since they were themselves ( the mossos ) a repressive force established by philip the v to hunt and destroy the catalan guerrillas such as `` carrasclet '' . 
  if you want to speak about paramilitary organisations which have a rather obscure past ( even in the recent past ) well , there is one massive and notorious paramilitary organisation currently operating in spain . 
  nobody is saying that this paramilitary organisation/security body is currently a fascist militia in the service of the rich , right ?

  copye & paste comments eh ? 
  ok , me too then : wow , manipulation much ? 
  the sometent was ( since it does n't exist anymore in catalonia , it remains only in andorra , where it is an official institution of the state ) originally a catalan medieval people 's militia which was raised only to defend the land and for internal security issues ( piracy and banditry mainly ) . 
  https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/sometent#cite_note-sapiens127-1 the institution was abolished in 1715 along all the other catalan institutions . 
  there were organisations later called `` somaten '' , but refered only to different kinds of rural police , not to the people 's militia . 
  in andorra , which continuated the catalan legal tradition undisturbed , the somaten is still a people 's militia only to be raised in extreme emergencies to the national sovereignity , as it was in catalonia until 1715 . 
  did you know that the germans are still using the nazi airforce , the luftwaffe ( according to you , since it has the same name ) . 
  yeah and he `` is just reminding catalans that breaking the law ( or `` the law '' as he writes ) , is not something that should be done by a head of government in a democratic government '' * while comparing us to the nazis and the fascists * there is ** plenty of precedent ** to calling independentists nazis by spanish media * and * politicians , from the left , from the right , from the government , from the opposition , etc : http://www.eldiario.es/catalunya/episodios-comparaciones-odiosas-nacionalismo-catalan_0_108839791.html, 
  do n't you * really * mean `` na ** c ** ionalists '' ?

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_air_force edit : fyi i did n't downvoted you i 've stated several times i do not care about imaginary egopoints, 
   editorialising is simply the act of inserting an opinion into a ( submission ) title it says nothing about quoting text * actually * written by the article 's author . 
  also , my opinion ? 
  debatable , german and italian ventures in the 1930 's were nazism and fascism , and he said that meaning it . 
  it is not my opinion , is what he said , i inserted his exact words as written in the article, 
  i did n't downvote you , and i 'm not going to calm down while you spread smears and lies about catalan independentists being fascists and annexionists . 
  in catalonia fascism , nazism and all other totalitarian , genocidal ideologies will be ilegal under the law , as in most of civilized europe ( but unlike your country ) . 
  so yeah , probably we will see a stream of old fascists and torturers leaving catalonia * en masse * towards greener pastures near el valle de los ca\u00eddos, 
  the independentists were anti-franco and anti-fascism and all that jazz back then back then ** and ** now ** and ** ever, 
  http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/08/29/opinion/1440868948_420201.html ha insultado a los albaneses , despreciandolos , y punto, 
  off course !!, 
  with our italian and german friends !!, 
  http://www.historiasiglo20.org/imag/images/gce26%20.jpg or maybe it was the spaniards who did , who knows !, 
  fucking catalan ** speaking ** territories , not ** catalan territories ** , he was speaking of territories which use a common language , ** just as spain does ** please ** do provide the link ** where he is asking to ** annex ** the territories which you talk of , how can you be such an hypocrite ? 
  please provide a link where the president or expresident of `` regional '' catalonia 's express the intention of ** annexing any territories ** . 
  so yes , provide some links on that , by the former president , not some links about someone advocating to * give passports * to whoever wanted . 
  i think that to offer nationality and annexing territories is quite different , as spain offers its own nationality to millions of people abroad in latin america and even to sefardi jews , and nobody says they want to conquer israel or latin america,
