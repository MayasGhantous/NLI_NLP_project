  he was n't refering to former albania , that was changed in the english article ( as i noted , btw ) . 
  i do n't think it is very clever for a person who speaks * officially * as a representative of spain ( in this case he speaks as a former pm , as noted by an editorial note from el pais ) to refer in those terms to a country they have diplomatic relations with . 
  it also insulted albania : '' `` how can they want to take the catalan people into isolation , into a kind of 21st-century version of albania ? '' '', 
  please note that the person who translated the article changed some phrases from the original article to make it appear `` softer '' to an international audience here 's the original : http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/08/29/opinion/1440863481_811526.html, 
  no need to go full retard on this issue , it 's quite clear that catalan and valencian are one and the same language academia valenciana de la llengua : * on the nature of valencian * : on 9 february 2005 the `` resolution of the acad\u00e8mia valenciana de la llengua concerning principles and criteria for protecting the name and identity of valencian '' was approved . 
  in this document , the avl affirmed that ** `` the language native to valencians throughout their history , from the philological viewpoint , is also shared by other autonomous communities ( catalonia and the balearic islands ) and the principality of andorra ** . 
  [ ... ] within this group of speech variants , valencian has the same position and value as any other regional variety of the linguistic system ; moreover , it possesses distinguishing characteristics which the avl have to protect and promote based on local lexicographical and literary tradition , on the true linguistic situation in valencia and on the normative rules already established in the normes de castell\u00f3 ( the castell\u00f3 regulation ) . '', 
  as a consequence of this resolution , the standardised valencian dictionary , diccionari normatiu valenci\u00e0 , defines valencian as a `` romance language spoken in the valencian community , as well as in catalonia , the balearic islands , the french department of the pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es orientales , the principality of andorra , the eastern flank of aragon and the sardinian town of alghero ( unique in italy ) , where it receives the name of catalan .

  no problem , but i think we ( or rather i ) have some trouble defining `` nation '' , as in `` multinational '' state ; in catalan and spanish `` nation '' has a meaning more akin to * volk * in german . 
  germany , in the past was one nation in several states ( with differences ) , this doesnt mean it was a `` multinational '' but a `` multistate '' phase . 
  spain and the uk are one state with multiple , differentiated nations ( peoples , cultures ) which have come together for different reasons . 
  so for us , as for the scots , it is not a thing of `` overcoming '' a mutlinational phase but returning to a status were we , as our own pople ( nation , volk ) can decide our future and how to administrate ourselves . 
  and i understand you dont like nationalism ; if i was german i wouldnt like it either , but you just can not judge the others for the sins your nation commited ( a part of it against us , btw ) . 
  we don t want to annex anything , we dont want to kill or opress no one , we are explicitely and scrupulously democratic and open in anything we do to accomplish our goal of independence . 
  now , the main problem we face in spain nowadays is that a part of the spanish population just refuses to acknowledge * our very existence as a people * , and this is a problem the scots do not have . 
  i think you fail to understand what a multinational country is ( germany it is n't ) . 
  different peoples ( nations ) under one state , not `` richer and poorer * provinces * '' ( now this may sound quite insulting to a scot , a basque or a catalan ) . 
  i think your own german vision of history and nationalism influences your view on at least the catalan and scottish independence movement , which is extremely unfair , since both are completely oppose to what german ( and spanish/japanese/italian ) nationalism represents , and in the case of the catalans , we have suffered for it,

  we did it in catalonia in 2013 ... two milion people, 
  i do n't think so , its an unfortunate but widespread * popular belief * that in 1479 there was a political unification of the crown of aragon with castille when in fact it was a dynastic union ( the same kind of union england and scotland entered in 1603 ) and that the `` spanish nation '' was born there , when it was not . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the op meant `` spain was born with the reyes catolicos '' , at least as a concept . 
  lolololo lololololo would be more * true * to the spirit of the anthem, 
  absolutely , 
  they tried it several years ago and it was a near catastrophe . 
  the thing is the anthem itself is not very singable since it it basically a military march ( an austrian one , made for marching or parade , not for singing ) . 
  also you will never get everyone to agree on the lyrics, 
  or we just dont like it any way , so why change it ... 
  he 's trying to make a joke with the meaning of `` coger '' ??? 
  i dint get it either, 
  the torrente films ( not exactly the most readed people in europe , the spaniards ), 
  in the constitution there are regions and there are nationalities , which are explicitly two different things , not `` two tupes of regions '' ( avoiding the `` region '' thing was the point at the time ), 
  to be a tourist ? 
  madrid !!!, 
  better food , history and people , don t miss it , go there !, 
  1479 was a union , not a `` unification '' yet, 
  union ( not * unification * !! ), 
  is alright but de facto : 1715 ( annexation of the crown of aragon , final unification of the peninsula bar portugal ) de iure : 1812 ( the first legal mention of spain as a nation ) `` spain '' as a nation did n't exist until the very last moments of its empire ( 1812 ) , the `` catholic monarchs '' ( ferdinand and isabella ) did not create `` spain '' in the xv century , just as the english and the scots did n't created the uk in the xvii century . 
  from a previous comment of mine i give you some explanation on how was it so : only that ferdinant and isabella did not actually create an unified kingdom in 1475 , what they did is a `` dynastic union '' , just as the english and the scots did in 1603 . 
  both the kingdom of castille and the crown of aragon keep existing under the same dynasty from then on . 
  the political entity ( spain ) did n't exist , the national conscience of `` being spanish '' , as it would become later ( a unifided , coherent idea that all of spain is one and only culture with one language etc ) did n't exist either . 
  back then , `` spanishness '' was , just as `` britishness '' , a geographical definitory term . 
  there had been already instances of iberian rulers using the definition `` empire of spain '' or `` empire of the spains '' already from the x century onwards http://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/2244055.pdf in the british islands there had also been a title coveted my many early kings , `` bretwalda '' ( ruler of britain ) , which did not mean they controled all of britain , or that there was a common british identity at the time https://www.questia.com/magazine/1g1-16416807/the-making-of-england in the concordia de segovia ( 1475 ) both kingdoms debated and reached a conclusion on how was the united monarchy going to govern , specifically by reassuring the position of each monarch on their states . 
  ferdinand ( ferr\u00e0n in aragon ) and isabella became consort king/queen on their spouses nobility ranks , although ferdinand was very ambitious and did try to have his say in the governing of castille while blocking isabella 's access to aragon . 
  https://cartografic.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/00_esp1.jpg although , hernando del pulgar an historian from the xvth century relates that on 1479 the royal council determined not to use the title of `` kings of spain '' because of legal problems . 
  in this article you can find the actual text of the concordate : http://www.google.es/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0cdwqfjac&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fdialnet.unirioja.es%2fdescarga%2farticulo%2f2127860.pdf&amp;ei=ahldvzhpi8mo7abrkocydw&amp;usg=afqjcnhkusq_xnrdx1qdvdpsovq_exwrug&amp;sig2=yjwb_mpnq7tk6hs1bugjta&amp;bvm=bv.92189499,d.zgu&amp;cad=rja `` platicose en el consejo del rey y de la reina c\u00f3mo se deb\u00edan intitular ; y como quiere que los votos de algunos de su consejo eran que se intitulasen reyes y se\u00f1ores de espa\u00f1a , pues sucediendo en aquellos reinos del rey de arag\u00f3n eran se\u00f1ores de toda la mayor parte de ella , pero determinaron de no hacerlo e intitul\u00e1ronse en todas sus cartas en esta manera '' as you see , this was a minority ( at least not a majority ) of people in the council that thought this way , the fact was that the crown of aragon and the `` crown '' of castile were very , very different political-administrative realities that were not easily united . 
  the article clearly states `` la intitulaci\u00f3n pone de manifiesto que fernando e isabel rechazaron la idea de fundir en una \u00fanica corona de espa\u00f1a las de arag\u00f3n y castilla '' spain as a national entity took time to christalise , on the basis of the kingdom of castile , which gave it its language and most of its culture , it did not began in 1469 . 
  the personal/dynastic union treaties were a clear attempt to keep each entity separated under a single monarch . 
  different kingdoms with different administrations , laws , languages , etc. 
  and it was to be this way until 1716 and the dismantlement , abolishment of what had been the crown of aragon . 
  the americas were an exclusive castillian enterprise , and foreigners were excluded ; that meant that not only the english , the french and the italians ( in a geographical sense ) were excluded , but also the catalans , the aragonese , etc. 
  the basques/navarrese were an exception because they were forcibly annexed by castille in the early xvi century and did participate in the colonial expansion , including the philippines ( discovered/conquered by legazpi , a basque ) . 
  unfortunately , being under castillian influence meant they had to abide by castillian laws and their language policy , also basque language at that time - unlike catalan , which was the official language of the crown of aragon 's catalan , valencian and balearic states - already had a hard time surviving outside the little villages , so the language of colonies was mostly castillian ( aka spanish ) . 
  p.s : please do not mistake the `` kingdom '' of aragon for the `` crown '' of aragon . 
  the kingdom of aragon and the principality of catalonia were , along the kingdom of mallorca and the kingdom of valencia ( among many others ) part of the crown of aragon , which was more of a federation-confederation of states, 
  lots of canadians and australians with british passports and who feel mostly british and canadian , but do like the benefits of having a eu passport . 
  the same goes for many argentinians , americans and else with korean passports who do not * consider * themselves koreans per se yet preffer to have double nationality if they can as its almost always positive, 
  spain may be third-rate , that does not make the collective of its leaders and leading figures stupid , spain generally has chosen to lose a little face instead of being completely smashed ( look at the spanish-american war or more recently the express change in the bibl ... 
  i mean constitution by the ppsoe ), 
  i see you are of an optimistic nature, 
  well , we are here because many people consider than our interests and the different spanish governments are not the same * already * . 
  keep calling it what you want ( lots of ecuatorians and peruvians with spanish passports , guess they are so stupid ) we will still have the eu citizenship , it looks silly to you ? 
  fine , we get the benefits of having our own state , one where we can make the laws we think would benefit us more , and where we can administer our money and cultural politics as we see it fit . 
  all while remaining eu citizens * at all times * . 
  when we have an state that actually wants to harm us in any way it can if we are independent , why help it ? 
  it may look silly to * you * it looks quite sane to me , the benefits of the eu citizenship ( not the * spanish * citizenship per se ) are huge , considering spain will - as it has stated everywhere and all the time - veto catalonia of every international organisation and institution it can ( spain is a third-rate country , but still it does have some influence ) . 
  are you sure spain will , given an hypotetical `` inevitable independence of catalonia '' act against its own economic interests ? 
  they ll just cut themselves off their primary land routes to europe , the most important airport ( in number of passengers ) and its main port ? 
  just like this ? 
  will the eu allow for an economy bigger than greece ( and one that actually works , btw ) to be lost overnight , or will it promote some kind of negotiation between the parts ? 
  many catalans , im not saying all agree that we may have to brave some turbulent waters for a time , but does spain has the luxury to do that ? 
  is the eu ready spend the unprecedented amounts of bailout money that it would be required to keep spain somwhow afloat ? 
  as ive said , spain is not exactly france , the uk or the us , i don t think that come the time , the eu will allow itself to be fucked in the ass because spain refused to negotiate * any * kind of settlement with catalonia ps : you clearly seem to claim that independnce does mean letting go of the spanish citizenship , which is not the case . 
  most catalans are not `` anti-spanish '' and do not hate spain or its peoples , that has nothing to do with wanting independence, 
  the spanish league is f.u.c.k.e.d without the fcb in it, 
  catalans would retain the spanish citizenship , in any case ( those who so wish , which is to say 99 % ) . 
  and spain has no provision to take it away http://www.mjusticia.gob.es/cs/satellite/portal/ca/areas-tematicas/nacionalidad/nacionalidad/como-pierde-nacionalidad, 
  and how exactly would we lose the spanish ( and thus eu ) citizenship ? 
  if spain does not recognise catalonia , and catalan citizens keep their spanish passports , there is no way spain can forcibly withdraw its nationality from them . 
  http://www.mjusticia.gob.es/cs/satellite/portal/ca/areas-tematicas/nacionalidad/nacionalidad/como-pierde-nacionalidad so at least for a time , catalans will mostly have double passports , and thus they 'll enjoy full rights as eu citizens i do n't know of any catalan who would willingly give up the spanish passport just after independence , and why would them ? 
  if we want to be independent , violence must be totally out of the question , it would be absolutely against our interests and im sure many in spain , especially in military and far right circles would like nothing more than to have the excuse to come here ( yet again ) guns blazing . 
  right now beig disarmed is our best defense, 
  here you are absolutely right, 
  you are only half-right , the catalan independence movement bases * all * of its legitimacy in its own * peacefull * , democratic demeanor , there will be no armed resiststance and above all , no financing or support to guerrillas ( basque or not , that is out of the question ) . 
  the most you will see will be a prague spring type of protest if spain does get totally crazy and try to militarilly occuppy catalonia, 
  from region to region , from nationality to nationality , and from nationality to region and from region to nationality in spain there are not only `` regions '', 
  it will matter once we start the process towards independece , which depends on the 27-s vote , right now we are an internal matter of spain . 
  also to gauge the opinion on an entire people based on some comment in reddit just demonstrates how irrelevant an individual 's opinion on this matter, 
  if you are not going to vote in the next elections it does n't really matter what you think about us or `` our cause '', 
  im amazed , with all the wealth of data and information ( in english ) on the catalan independence issue ( economic benefits and challenges , civic organisations , parliamentary support , etc ) there is still so many people that have no clue at all of whats happening here . 
  seriously , as important as the bar\u00e7a is for catalans , do you think that would be a factor * against * independence , or a factor at all when we are talking of something so extremely serious and important as creating an independent state ? 
  we can discuss it , off couse , but im not a seven year old anymore so i wouldnt like to . 
  catalonia , unlike scotland and several other aspiring '' '' `` regions '' '' '' has more than enough going for her to be * very * successful economically , it is already a powerhouse ( and a much bigger economy than greece 's , more like austria ) . 
  it is by no means certain that we will be kicked out of the eu ( which will actually not affect the citizens of catalonia , since theyll still be eu citizens since they will have double nationality catalan/spanish ) . 
  do you think that the eu will kick out an economy that actually works , now that it has been demonstrated that theeu does not want to let go of greece * almost at any cost * ? 
  they wouldn t kick out greece but they will kick a bigger economy that actually works ( catalonia ) ? 
  polls are extremely unreliable ( read manipulated ) in spain , its a shame , but thats what we have, 
  ahem , theres almost no vitriol in either the uk and scotland subreddits ( no sarcasm ), 
  everyone who dares to support independence,
