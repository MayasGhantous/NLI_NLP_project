fjolskylda i can barely type it looking at it, 
  then i do n't see the point of religion if they change things as they please . 
  also i know religious people do n't follow blindly as i.e christianity people are much more `` lgtb-friendly '' than muslims but not they arent its institutions ( church itself i.e ) . 
  as we are discussing for me and imo most of religions are machist and homophobic and for me thats enough for despise them , as i think they 're unnecessiary since the medieval age as they only works now for connect the society kinda and for traditions which are hard to change but they 're finally leaving in the irrelevance . ^ also ^ sorry ^ forbad ^ english, 
  yeah of each religion, 
  beautiful words , nice utopia which wo n't change anything of the religion as those things are written like that in their books are n't going to change anything towards homosexuals, 
  the 46 % + - of catalonia want 's to leave spain , which is still less than 50 % and the majority does n't want , so would you just sucede catalonia from spain when less than half of catalonia does n't want ? 
  also all of the independece thing started when in the 2007 crisis , when the % of leavers were only like 20 % or less iirc . 
  ( all those % are in the wikipedia ), 
  yeah because being gay and muslim is so compatible, 
  what a disgusting bs , i 'd the chechnya gov instead go and use it for themselves . 
  relevant name, 
  yeah i know and im saying you speak like if you were one, 
  you 're speaking like if being gay is bad or an insult ... 
  indeed , up until 2007 crisis there was n't any problem, 
  we can share !, 
  its like they just want to go backward, 
  nobody expects the spanish inquisition, 
  relevant name , full metal alchemist too ? 
  plus ultra lol boku no hero academia anyone ? 
  the only one speaking about war is uk ...

  well spain is a permanent guest to g20, 
  depends the age . 
  agree , i ca n't understand how people can have so less of empathy . 
  maybe traditional for you ? 
  it is n't traditional for the gay russians . 
  it 's just a lame excuse for hide homophobic . 
  and ? 
  one million of retrogrades compared to the whole population of france ( and the rest of countries the gay marriage is approved ) . 
  `` nontraditional orientation '' well then tell that to the first humans and animals that inhabited this planet .

  you guys do n't want to be part of the eu and yet get the benefits like if you were . 
  thats what happens when you have to choose between the lesser bad : /, 
  lol iirc they made fun of spanair when it closed too, 
   but then , italy and spain are always there to cheer me up !,
