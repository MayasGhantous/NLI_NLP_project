wat 's wrong with bikes ? 
  they will just not have more babies aand leave the trouble for the next generation . 
  kingdom of aragon <  crown of aragon and crown of aragon is just a convention name to designate the realms of the king of aragon , valencia , mallorca , sicily , prince of catalonia ... 
  rip saruman , count dooku , dracula ... 
  the question is too broad . 
  it \u00b4 s not the same invading a random middle-eastern country because reasons that defend your country from isis . 
  and the former is much more probable than the latter . 
  they should ask for who would be willing to defend their country of a foreign invasion . 
  france in a nutshell . 
  oh god . 
  what happened with all the imperial eagles and the aggresive symoblogy ? 
  nationalism does n't stand on the cool things that your country has done . 
  that 's just fapping material . 
  even the lamest countries have some nationalism . 
  nationalism is about being a community with shared traits ( language , religion , culture ) , opposed to the other communities and with roots in the land and the history . 
  there 's like 5 italian wars , the meddling in the french religion wars , the french phase of the 30 years wars and its continuation until 1659 , the nine year 's war , the quadruple alliance war , the war of the convention , the 1808 war and the intervention of te 100.000 sons of saint louis . 
  oh , and france allied with the great turk against spain on one occasion . 
  and before spain was unified or created , the crown of aragon also fought many wars with the french . 
  i 'm 24 and i see the places at friday/saturday nights much more empty than when i started at 16 . 
  due to their alliance with the ~ ~ pirates ~ ~ english/british . 
  italy is great at culture but terrible at war , so it seems logical . 
  well , russia considers itself the [ third rome ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/third_rome#russian_claims ) . 
  [ anime was a mistake ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/916/085/570.gif ), 
  russia is fighting on the less bad side in syria . 
  public health and alimentary habits matters !, 
  paella for dinner \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  not even beer or wine ? 
  still you should have seen the classic summer headlines like `` depravation in magaluf '' and `` drunk brit falls from balcon and dies horribly '' . 
  i have always associated the titan with the colossus of rhodes , but that 's an interesting analogy . 
  braavos is clearly venice . 
  a hardresser whose religion does n't allow cutting hair ? 
  what would you think if i had a business and did n't allow romanian people to enter ? 
  they are all gypsies , you know . 
  [ forbidden the entrance of romanian and dogs ] ( https://lalibertadylaley.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/racista.jpg ), 
  i would say that andalusia is the most religious part of the country , but at the same time it 's a socialist feud and seem mostly concerned with tradition and folklore ( semana santa , el roc\u00edo ... ) . 
  more or less . 
  they were deported and went to cologne to take a plane to the motherland . 
  apparently in the meanwhile they decide to do some tourism . 
  but ea it 's their boss and it 's american . 
  i 'll bite : go to mallorca or valencia and ask the people from there what they think about the whole `` catalan countries '' thing . 
  smh, 
  how 's that even relevant . 
  all the independentists i know were convinced that they were going to reach independence very soon . 
  catalonia had to be independent the next september since 2013 or so . 
   mostly, 
  mao was mostly negligence rather than assasinations . 
  ah , i guess the soviet take on history was totally objective . 
  the more they know capitalism , the more they appreciate stalin . 
  as patton said , war is not meant to be you dying for your country-it is by making the other bastard die for his . 
  you 're one to talk : * siam pronti alla morte , siam pronti alla morte * . 
  the french have the best lyrics . 
  at least it 's national anthem and not state anthem . 
  russia has the most boring name but the best music . 
  tell that to `` indivisibiliter ac inseparabiliter '' . 
  no , the franco 's motto was `` una , grande y libre '' ( one , great and free ) . 
  they kinda had it coming . 
  cruzcampo does n't count as beer . 
  * blushes *, 
  roma victrix, 
  the preservation of the roman empire necessarly includes a sane succession law . 
  something something alexander the great airport . 
  cachopos . 
  reeeeeee heretics get out !, 
  the encomienda was a continuation of the feudal system , and had many laws that protected the indians from abuses ( they were n't always enforced tho ) . 
  plus , the encomienda it 's quite opposite to the concept of genocide , do n't you think ? 
  the university of his house , with a research internship at the next bar . 
  an academic historian should know that the vast majority of the deaths were caused by the accedental propagation of smallpox , for the natives did n't have biological defenses against . 
  i 've read a couple of articles and they seem quite insane indeed . 
  yeah , well , you know , that 's just , like , your opinion , man . 
  the url says `` dol\u00e7acatalunya '' . 
  apparently comes from here : https://www.dolcacatalunya.com/2017/03/cosas-pasan-bcn-dia-san-jose-no-surten-tv3/ ( warning : it 's written in a schizo combination of spanish and catalan ), 
  we do siestas when the sun is at it 's peak , so it 's no problem . 
  hey , we kept america for three centuries , that 's longer than any other of the succesive european empires in regards to overseas territories . 
  british india lasted 2 centuries , and most african colonies did n't last a century . 
  that 's true for the low countries , but i 'll argue that italy was conquered by the sword ( and arquebus ) , at battles like ceri\u00f1ola , garellano and pav\u00eda ( plus the heritage of the aragonese crown ) . 
  wwell , we have the electricity companies c\u00e1rtel for example . 
  heh , ever seen [ two sicilies ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/flag_of_the_kingdom_of_the_two_sicilies_%281816%29.svg/2000px-flag_of_the_kingdom_of_the_two_sicilies_%281816%29.svg.png ) ? 
  / jk and it 's still sex . 
  assault and sex . 
  does n't matter , had sex . 
  hum , columbus sailors ( and the whole expedition ) were spanish , not italian . 
  it spread to italy via the spanish army involvement in the italan wars . 
  it 's not like they can send a couple of agents to arrest 160 people . 
  i think there were complaints for the `` no russian '' level ( rightfully so ) . 
  and you still have to see kalimotxo ... 
  for a moment i thought that the europa moon was a bread . 
  that looks like the cheapest ham you can buy at the supermarket . 
  honey is not for the ass 's mouth . 
  it 's interesting how he got the names of the two most noteworthy ships of the spanish fleet at trafalgar ( sant\u00edsima trinidad and san juan nepomuceno ) in his name . 
  iirc he was a scam . 
  it 's just that you have no clue what you 're talking about . 
  we 've had an awful lot of white terrorists in spain , and the right is still quite sensitive about it and prone to call anyone a terrorist . 
  we do n't need your ignorant lectures . 
  `` back '', 
  barca ( bar\u00e7a ) is the football team . 
  the city is barna . 
  french solutions . 
  the us is supposed to be a first world country . 
  aragon was already done by that time , so you 're actually 2nd ( navarra does n't count ) . 
  defeat the turks once and ca n't shut up about it for 400 years .
