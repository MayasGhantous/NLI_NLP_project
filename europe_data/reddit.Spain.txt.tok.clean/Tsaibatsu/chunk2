  i 'd rather die . 
  holy shit , is even worse than i expected . 
  i mean , they even put fucking * onion * !!, 
  a [ guardia civil ] ( https://www.eyeonspain.com/userfiles/image/mac75/history/guardia-civil-tricornio1.jpg ) couple would be more than enough . 
  yes , please . 
  remove moros, 
  meanwhile , andorra has some [ motherfucking cows ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/escudo_de_andorra#/media/file:coat_of_arms_of_andorra.svg ) . 
  [ the muscular , tough officer ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/7c/98/ce/7c98ce0feaa24c0aae58e324253c377d.jpg ) ( police , not guardia civil tho :( ), 
  indeed , i know some girls with that type of face , none of them i would consider particularly attractive . 
  finns confirmed as mongols . 
  most japanese women do n't work there either . 
  frankly i would prefer to be a japanese women than a man : being with the kids , cleaning a tiny house and actually managing the money vs working 16 hours a day , sleeping in capsules when they lose the last train , and killing themselves if they lose their job . 
  lol how that pirate drake ended ? 
  the old town is a massive tourist trap . 
  france is 100x times more centralist than spain tho . 
  say goodbye to autonomy and co-oficiality of catalan . 
  of course , ceremonial often implies archaic . 
  but it also carries other implications that archaic does n't have , like that they wear it only for the show and after that they go home and wear whatever they want . 
  it 's not archaic , is * ceremonial * . 
   it 's too easy to trigger easterners in this sub . 
   do n't call me eastern lol, 
  finland was still capitalist tho . 
  in spain , everything above the pyrenees and the alps is northern europe ( ok , france is kind of a grey area ) , everything beyond the iron curtain is eastern europe . 
  greece , italy , portugal and us are southern europe ( and cyprus i guess ) . 
  the turks are just moors and not europeans . 
  to be fair , the things that did n't build to last fell apart long time ago . 
  survivor bias . 
  do n't fool yourself , you 're still barbarians beneath a civilized surface . 
  it seems that valldemossa was printing incunabula . 
  cool also , stark contrast between north and south italy . 
  boiling them alive , with the temperatures of the last days ... 
  they come as white walkers , leave as red lobsters . 
  praised be r'hllor . 
  they look very sci-fi . 
  literally white walkers . 
  we know where it is , we have to buy our towels somewhere . 
  i thought that france was wealthier . 
  [ knock knock ] ( http://e01-elmundo.uecdn.es/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2015/10/16/14450177448547.jpg ), 
  but you ca n't blame the allies for not wanting to send millions of people to their deaths . 
  it 's so easy to talk while you 're comofortably in your house in 2017 . 
  what 's the point of avoiding millions of deaths ? 
  it 's like the generalitat pays them . 
  but i actually know some people absolutely obsessed with it ( without being paid ) . 
  we 're humans , not seahorses . 
  i ca n't sleep . 
  kill me please . 
  the 5th looks particularly idiotic . 
  i do n't think you understand what `` propaganda '' means . 
  metalheads tend to be mostly nerds . 
  but you can be a vegetarian , therefore eating beef is n't actually a necessity . 
  farm conditions are n't exactly ideal you know . 
  the `` great man theory '' is totally discredited by now . 
  i think the recreations are just lame . 
  where is `` here '' ? 
  i was curious and checked that jarrow thing :  benedict brought workmen from francia to build these churches , the first ecclesiastical structures in britain built of stone , and furnished it with glass windows , pictures , service books and the library he had collected on his travels . 
  window glass being unusual in england at the time , benedict imported glassmakers from francia , who established a workshop at the monkwearmouth site , [ 2 ] which stands on a nearby site on the river wear . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monkwearmouth%e2%80%93jarrow_abbey#foundation lol you had to brought french workers to make stone buildings , such a cultural centre . 
  and jarrow does n't reach 50k inhabitants ** today ** . 
  what kind of fantasy books do you read ? 
  it 's very difficult todo esto . 
  if you work in the tourism industry , you need to know some languages , specially in activities were a misunderstanding can be fatal . 
  and no , we ca n't restrict tourism to countries we know their language . 
  it 's called `` colonial architecture '', 
  the best thing about the wiew from montparnasse tower is that you do n't see the montparnasse tower . 
  spain allowed women suffrage in 1931 . 
  then we had , you know , a dictatorship . 
  mussolini would be proud . 
  as these castles tend to have wells and huge provisions , so starving them would slowly greatly an invading army . 
  and if they just bypass them , they 'll have hostile forces on their rear that will harass them and interfere with their logistics . 
  foreign policy and long standing cultural differences are what makes a country more recognisable from the outside . 
  they certainly do n't have their own foreign policy . 
  i think you overstate the eu . 
  except they are n't countries ? 
  spanish : lordly , miracolous , wise , honorable , fertile land , noble , the best ... 
  seems accurate to me . 
  it 's not spanish , according to our air force : https://twitter.com/thespainreport/status/877203399892185090, 
  well , the eiffel tower is located in the * champ de mars * . 
  `` champ '' in english means `` field '' , so actually it was built surronded by fields . 
  on the other hand , athenians believed they emerged from the attica soil . 
  sure , ira attacks were always labelled as `` mentaly ill loners '' . 
  what happens in cabo carvoeiro ? 
  [ the duke of alba is ready for the fight ] ( http://cdn.20m.es/img2/recortes/2014/11/20/198679-944-1415.jpg ), 
  adopt me plz . 
  it makes sense that italy has a latin feel . 
  names like chindasvinto !, 
  i know `` maite zaitut '' !, 
  medina azahara , though is basically ruins . 
  plus the basque country at that time was already in castilian hands . 
  it 's modern . 
  on navarra it says that was annexed in 1512 by `` spain '' or something like that , so unless the mapmaker could see the future ... 
  wait until you see the sanitation . 
  they went there , saw the atlantic ocean , and said `` nope '' it 's not called `` costa da morte '' ( coast of death ) for nothing . 
  bland suburbs , too . 
  plebiscitarian elections . 
  we ca n't make a referendum so we use the elections for it . 
  that 's what they said . 
  but then they turned out to be just like regular elections . 
  the referendum of 2014 and the `` plebiscitarian elections '' of 2015 . 
  `` but this time is diferent ! '', 
  it will have exactly the same legal basis so ...
