nonsense . 
  rawr, 
  russia just wants a hug . 
  i actually though they had closed rt uk some time ago . 
  did they reopen later ? 
  i though italy and russia got along because russia helping italy with money for earthquake repairs ? 
  the rollercoaster is real !, 
  let 's sanction russia , said spain not . 
  let 's pressure spain to give up on letting russia refuel in their ports , said nato and european union . 
  everyone 's done it . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/saudi-arabia-close-to-deal-to-buy-115bn-worth-of-military-equipment-from-us to pretend we can sanction the entire world is nonsense . 
  makes sense !, 
  risk = / = threat but i guess posting the same thing twice did n't help you understand that . 
  reuters claims juncker said something , while in reality they are interpreting what he said . 
  go on with your insults if that 's what makes you happy . 
  so where is the threat of relations ? 
  because it seems to me that you 're cherry picking . 
  also i notice that you refuse to comment on your claim of juncker not being elected . 
  have you actually read the article and watched the video or are you only reading the title ? 
  though so . 
  jean claude-juncker : `` i think we will waste two years before mr trump tours the world he is unaware of '' . 
  reuters : `` trump ignorant of europe , poses risk to relations : eu 's juncker '' . 
  totally not a tabloid . 
  you read too much ye olde nigel propaganda . 
  the european executive is elected by the european parliament . 
  i 'll remind you that theresa may has not gone through elections , and that donald john trump has been elected with less votes than the opposition . 
  i disagree , i 'm pretty sure russia depends heavily on europe for exporting their goods . 
  specially gas and petrol . 
  on a side note i 'm surprised the article does not mention spain , due to the latter refuel incident . 
  nobody expects the polish inquisition . 
  itt : non europeans complaining about a tabloid that does n't reflect the content of the article . 
  welcome to the european union sir , here your vote matters . 
  an electoral college wo n't ignore your vote and elect the least voted of two options . 
  he 's going to build a wall between the yanklands and yurop . 
  what about skyrim with nuclear dragons and two-headed bears ? 
  we might even develop a powerful shouting skill with adequate doses of radiation . 
  burning is the new black . 
  it 's back in fashion . 
  he 's the new prophet . 
  soon taking pictures of him and painting him will be forbidden and we will rename london to londonistan . 
  this is not a partisan issue as far as i know . 
  nobody understands the scheme behind this . 
  the real purpose is to revalue the price of memes in the market . 
  geez , do i have to explain everything ? 
  welcome to the new age of the uk . 
  space brexit !, 
  wooooo http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/tardis/images/3/30/the_beast_below.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131003104726, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqpzn5ih1x8 video found !, 
  in german though : c, 
  whenever something is partially paid with eu funds it gets advertised .

  meanwhile queso curado awaits its moment to claim the iron throne .

  yo dawg , i heard you like italian flags , so i put an italian flag within an italian flag so you can italian while you italian . 
  but seriously , 6 italian flags ? 
  talk about overcompensating . 
  algeria better diplomatic allies than portugal or france . 
  fact ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  nato 's stability is under question of lately . 
  but then again , debates about a possible european army show up every now and then . 
  there 's a lot of those western alliance countries missing in that list , and a few eastern countries added . 
  great news for the uk that they 're getting a repair hub though . 
  mixing ethnics and politics does n't usually end up well . 
  my exact same thoughs . 
  poland ca n't into joking smile, 
  and of course shopping malls , here called centros comerciales . 
  such a jolly educative video about turkish politics !, 
  so intense !, 
  i 'm going to grab some pop corn . 
  hmmm first one outside yurop is tokyo in 8th place . 
  i 'm not surprised . 
  venezuelan politics are all about distraction . 
  sure venezuelans have to cross the border to get food , but if you can blame it on other countries people will believe it , as they 're not very critic of their politicians . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/17/at-least-35000-venezuelans-cross-border-to-colombia-to-buy-food-and-medicine http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/venezuela-cross-border-buy-food-inflation-mismanagement-colombia-a7156711.html recently a friend of mine came from venezuela to spain saying if he stays there he 'll end up being shot . 
  something that i have to say i 'm proud of is that we can give shit to our politicians when they deserve it . 
  related , i think this video is interesting https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rstl7nir7gs, 
  it 's commonplace . 
  http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/04/08/inenglish/1460123189_836096.html direct insult from maduro to rajoy , `` trash '' , `` colonialist '' , `` corrupt '' . 
  another example ... during the iberoamerican summit in 2007 hugo chavez called aznar ( the previous prime minister of spain ) inhuman , a snake and a fascist , among other things , which led to zapatero ( president of spain back then ) to tell him to calm down and voice his differences with due respect , since aznar was an elected president of spain . 
  chavez kept charging , until the spanish king ( juan carlos i ) told him to shut up . 
  which became kind of a meme in spain for a while . 
  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7089131.stm but yes , this kind of undesirable behavior is very common from venezuela . 
  parents are on a strike this weekend to protest against excessive homework . 
  an eta leader got arrested in france , weakening eta further as they lose more weapons and explosives . 
  glory to arstotzka !, 
  they should have totally used the ost of `` papers , please '' in that video . 
  relevant , the song : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaaxfswv_e8, 
  can penguins still fly ? 
  at this rate next season of game of thrones will be filmed in uk 's parliament . 
  i jelly . 
  i guess i 'll have to keep buying culture with my own money ;'(, 
  not surprised , every year there 's several declarations from maduro ( and chavez before him ) that spain is trying to overthrow them and other nonsense . 
  historical revisionism , lulzy . 
  starting shit and negotiate to get something out of it has always been a very british thing after all . 
  accurate !, 
  i 'd definitely dig a fire emblem game about the eu . 
  yes , ocde ( organizaci\u00f3n para la cooperaci\u00f3n y el desarrollo econ\u00f3micos ) is the acronym in spanish . 
  shit 's flying off the handle pretty quick .
