  ** translation ** the association claims to have received threats from around 40 people linked to the far right . 
  the association of students of the faculty of social sciences and humanities ( fcsh ) of the new university of lisbon denounced on wednesday threats from about 40 people linked to the far right . 
  `` on tuesday , the board of the association of students of the faculty of social sciences and humanities ( aefcsh ) of the new university of lisbon was invaded by four dozen individuals assigned to the extreme right , who identified themselves as such , '' he says . 
  according to the association , in a `` clearly intimidating '' attitude , people demanded to meet individually members of aefcsh . 
  `` along with this initiative , the photos of some association leaders were published on social networks of the extreme right , and the 40 people promised to return in greater numbers to the aefcsh facilities , '' he says . 
  the students of that faculty decided on monday at a general meeting of students not to cede the auditorium to the organization nova portugalidade to hold a conference of political scientist jaime nogueira pinto on `` populism or democracy ? 
  brexit , trump and le pen in debate . '', 
  they claimed that the event was `` associated with colonialist , racist , xenophobic arguments . '', 
  in the statement , aefcsh stresses that `` it never sought to prevent the existence of political debate , nor the presence of professor jaime nogueira pinto in college . '', 
  `` the board of the aefcsh was limited to following up on a decision of the general meeting of students that mandated it not to cede the auditorium requested by the organization nova portugalidade.this organization has a salazarista profile and the direction of aefcsh is reviewed in student concern to which it was linked in the general meeting of students , `` he says . 
  in the statement , the association also explains that it was only aware of the decision to cancel the conference by the media . 
  the aefcsh ends by stating that it `` will not be intimidated by the presence and threats of any far-right group '' and that `` it is not afraid of the free debate it has never prevented and will continue to promote in the faculty , as well as democratic values by which are governed . '', 
  this case caused controversy , to the point that the president of the republic , marcelo rebelo de sousa , asked for clarifications on the cancellation of the conference , which motivated criticism and led to the 25 de abril association to make its facilities available to nogueira pinto . 
  pnr calls for protest this wednesday it was also known that the national renewal party ( pnr ) called for a protest in front of the faculty of social sciences and humanities of the new university of lisbon `` against the totalitarianism of the single thought and the freedom of expression for all '' . 
  `` at least , these media cases that already affect jo\u00e3o braga and jaime nogueira pinto serve to awaken minds and consciences , and that , once awakened , realize that only the pnr truly fights against the totalitarianism of the single thought , '' the party says . 
  announcement on its website . 
  fado singer jo\u00e3o braga wrote last week on his facebook page , referring to the oscar-winning ceremony in hollywood : `` now just be black or gay to win oscars . '', 
  the statement provoked controversy and led the sos racism association to lodge a complaint with the commission on equality and against racial discrimination . 
  in the summons , the pnr points out that `` it always felt in the face of discrimination , boycott , censorship and threat by the owners of established power . '', 
  `` when we warned hundreds of times that this was the reality in 21st century portugal , most of those who heard us ` shake the water out of the cape ' and told us it was because we were ` extremists ' , just to make a difference , think differently and say it without fear , `` he says . 
  for the pnr , with `` nationalist growth in the west , the left , who dominates the system , who dictates the rules and who imposes cultural marxism , begins to get nervous and to harden the struggle . 
  who can have a voice , what is right and wrong and criminalizes who opposes it . '', 
  ** translation ** the court of appeal of lisbon distributed to judge rui rangel the new appeal of jos\u00e9 s\u00f3crates in the ambit of operation marqu\u00eas . 
  the court of appeal of lisbon distributed to judge rui rangel the new appeal of jos\u00e9 s\u00f3crates in the context of operation marquis , according to saturday . 
  jos\u00e9 s\u00f3crates asks for the nullity of the procedural acts and the end of the operation marquis 's investigation because there has not yet been a deadline for the prosecution or the order to close the facts investigated . 
  this is the 38th appeal of operation marquis , and judge rui rangel 's choice does not seem to please the public ministry . 
  `` someone should explain how the distribution of cases in the lisbon relation is being done , '' said a source quoted by saturday . 
  the decision may be appealed by the public prosecutor . 
  the only remedy won by jos\u00e9 s\u00f3crates until now was judge rui rangel , who put an end to the secrecy of internal justice and allowed socrates access to the documents and testimonies of the proceedings . 
  the attorney general , joana marques vidal , extended the investigation until march 17 but did not officially announce whether the case ends within that period . 
  to me it just looks like they replaced local flora with foreign flora .

  is this memes ? 
  do n't be silly , that might cause internal trade strife in the us . 
  yeah , i know , not much ago english media made some shitarticles about police in majorca being scared or something . 
  the real issue stated by the police is that salary is lower than what rent even costs there so they could n't afford working there without housing help like family , so yeah , housing does go up big time in some places . 
  still , there are better ways to solve overcrowding ( < - is that even a word ? 
   uneducated politicians to be fair , the mayor of barcelona is in favor of pushing away tourists and buy houses for occupy people with state money . 
  so if you 're in barcelona and do n't have a place to stay just occupy a place and demand the ajuntament buy it for it , free housing !,

  meeeeeeeeeeeemes, 
  i like how you 're all trying to bash the news because of one source . 
  have a load of the same news in different media : ** sources !, 
  or are they all in cahoots ? 
  actually the ban is not only for old cars but also some newer cars , it depends more on the amount of co2 emissions than the age , though sure , older cars will pollute more on average . 
  weaksauce is not an excuse , it 's the [ difference between conspiranoia and facts ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwlwq5ron_k ) . 
  and no , i ca n't be sad about some supposed screencaps that somebody has to send them and that you saw some years ago . 
  sorry buddy but it does n't add up , you say a lot of things but do n't back them up , you 're fluff , you say i 'm selectively blind to some `` truth '' you 're trying to promote , but the claims you make are not backed . 
  where are these screencaps , who is this supposed respected photo-journalist and where are the threats ? 
  where is the backing for your facts ? 
  i find it really silly that you 're trying to spin a yarn on us with this fluff but you refuse to acknowledge direct source on clearly xenophobic remarks on the catalan counselor of work that are recorded and spread widely . 
  of course you know that , because you know better . 
  you 're one smart cookie that can read the mind of the attendees and the organizers . 
  not smart enough to realize that 's a different article than the others though . 
  i 'm going to note some things a smart cookie like you might appreciate : two assholes trying to boycott a legitimate protest is n't enough to condemn a legitimate gathering . 
  specially with security keeping them at bay . 
  sounds like you 're trying to spin a yarn on us with this , specially knowing that in the other articles ( of the same media ) they flat out refuse to show pictures of said ` fascism ' . 
  the case still stands , a dozen links after the accusation of `` demonstrably fascist '' all you 've got is a bunch of fluff and a picture with two idiots that are not related to dol\u00e7a catalunya . 
  anything else to add , smart cookie ? 
  yes , i did , and they 're full of fluff . 
  they read shit like `` finally , we saw the falange wave their flags '' . 
  yet in the images there 's no sign of fascism whatsoever , only people with spanish , catalan and barcelona flags . 
  no sign of falange flags , not in the same article anyway , the information is so disconnected that rather than information it 's dissociated data . 
  i think it 's funny how you keep trying to portrait me as uneducated , yet you insist on ignoring the logical flaws in your own sources . 
  hot or not !, 
  it 's the same post , with the same sources , and a few images without sources edited by the blogger . 
  the only thing that it says is that one of the supposed founders of dol\u00e7a catalunya is a catholic , and a conservative ... and apparently that 's enough for a bunch of conspiranoics to call him fascists , francoist and amusingly enough , to link him with a blog about nutrition . 
  ok . my eyes have been feasted with your silliness , now , can you actually `` demonstrate '' that they are fascists ? 
  do you even understand that feelings and facts are different things ? 
  sigh , i 'm going to have to get a tinfoil hat when i speak with catalans now . 
  -- you know what , i 'm gon na write a checklist to help you differ between people you do n't like and actual fascists : it 's not a fascist if ... * disagrees with your political opinion !, 
  * writes in a media with a different political opinion than yours !, 
  * has a different faith !, 
  there , hopefully this should help you , unicorn . 
  and yet portugal still insists that spain is a danger to the environment and that they 're green knights . 
  so they ate chorizo and then ran away ? 
  it does n't make the point more or less valid either , the whole premise is vapid . 
  to be fair it 's not only an oss issue as i pointed out , free stuff is never free . 
  ever heard of windows 10 ? 
  yeah , it 's shit . 
  specially it 's obsession with connecting to the internet and sharing your data without your explicit consent .
