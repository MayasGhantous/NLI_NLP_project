  license agreements are a bad joke , ever read them ? 
  most people just scroll down and click accept . 
  [ everybody should check this guy out , but his stuff is mostly in spanish ; c ] ( https://youtu.be/8dbh1octofw?t=3m38s ), 
  until there 's a black box in the code , or the [ code gets obfuscated ] ( https://www.google.es/?gws_rd=ssl#q=code+obfuscation+techniques&amp;* ) . 
  or you just do n't bother reading the entirety of the source code of everything you use ever . 
  tell me you read the source code of the os of your smartphone , if it 's android . 
  which by the by , it 's different from manufacturer to manufacturer because yes , smartphone manufacturers get to modify the source code , specially the databases , which are different in different models using the same android version . 
  wooooo !, 
  -- tl ; dr : open source software is only safe if you actually read the source code , which you do n't . 
  it 'd probably get a autonomous city state like ceuta or melilla . 
  as for if it 'd be able to secede ? 
  it would depend on the negotiation terms i guess . 
  that said , they need not worry about the central government but the other autonomies wanting similar taxes , specially catalonia , who raises a tantrum every time madrid lowers their taxes and starts yelling `` disloyal competence '' . 
  free stuff is never free . 
  not only related to open source software though . 
  after doing his entire life in canada , getting a warm home and some food might be the last of his worries . 
  there 's more to life than that . 
  ever heard of open source software ? 
   please donate your brain to science . 
  i can get you a little bit of cream for your asshole if you really need it that badly , man . 
   great ? 
  spain can withhold a region 's right to self determination because the uk did n't offer democracy to a colony . 
  also yes , if you support self-determination why hold colonies ? 
  let them free !, 
  also , spain is n't withholding jack shit . 
  i 'm going to give [ you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_koeg55vewu ) a couple of [ examples ] ( http://www.constitution.org/cons/norway/dok-bn.html ) . 
   article 1  the kingdom of norway is a free , independent , indivisible and inalienable realm . 
  its form of government is a limited and hereditary monarchy . 
  so i 'm reading this shit , and it 's all written by the same guy . 
  did you seriously [ ` shoop this ] ( https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bm8tkq3d4pu/wgliqnycuni/aaaaaaaaacw/zg1rr6crsz0lhtwhr4ud3q3_a5szvl1-gclcb/s1600/untitled-1.jpg ) and upload it to your own blog ? 
  dude , your sentiments are not a reliable source alright ? 
  you 're not going to convince anybody that some shitposts you made on your own blog are enough to demand public recognition of some people you do n't like as `` fascists '' . 
  do n't give me that , hong kong did n't even get a democratic system until just before they handed it to china . 
  trying to act like a white knight in this cause when the uk is known to undermine it is absurd . 
  i do n't reckon the burning of the white house as a respect of self-determination . 
  i do n't think that the pre-partitions of india were an act of respect of self-determination . 
  more like an act of spite . 
  by `` demonstrably fascist '' you mean some angsty indepentist made a blog and called them fascist ? 
  are you for real or just want to look like a five year old ? 
  [ it 's the lizard-people !, 
  ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_m3mif3huo4/wfgyvof80ri/aaaaaaaaacc/ydbihvmvpgwlieu7vd_mkszyyokf3vbigclcb/s1600/chavales.jpg ), 
  demonstrably fascist . 
  ok , demonstrate it . 
  franco supporters ? 
  demonstrate it . 
  cmon , i 'm waiting . 
  have some extra if you want : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk8actawg0e, 
  well , there 's no shortage of that in the media i mentioned . 
  the whole premise is absurd . 
  catalonia is not even remotely similar to scotland or ireland . 
  catalonia does n't even surge until after arag\u00f3n and castilla merge . 
  and if catalonia is a reference here , is it a reference to their constant xenophobia against andalusia , valencia , andorra , southern france and others . 
  their victim complex claiming that spain robs and kills and rapes them as if we were in 16th century england and they were ireland or scotland . 
  or their constant mentions of absurd imaginary situations like yugoslav wars is coming to catalonia !, 
  boo , scary . 
  the demonization of spain in some territories is just absurd . 
  i did n't mean to direct the reply to you , but to the conversation about annexing gibraltar to either scotland or ireland . 
  [ \u00a1 guillotina guillotina guillotina guillotina !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmm454uv6vu ), 
  majorca bar . 
  fitting !, 
  by all means keep it , fix the tax haven and the propaganda issue and we 're set . 
  spain does n't care about gibraltar beyond that , most spaniards do n't even remember it 's there until picardo tosses the myfranco ^ tm propaganda arround . 
  because he 's quoting tabloid titles to get a reaction . 
  [ reliable , as far as portuguese can be ] ( https://puu.sh/uylmz/11d95b7aa8.png ), 
  you just do n't get it , do you ? 
  morocco has no say in it , never will , never have . 
  the sole concept that `` but ceuta and melilla ! '', 
  is an argument solely exists in far right press , like the daily mail and the express * cough * enemies of the people * cough * . 
  ludicrous , everytime the royal navy has joint operations with the spanish navy picardo tosses his propaganda that the british come to defend gibraltar . 
  even the british navy is ashamed of your behavior . 
  you all do realize you 're all basically hadling gibraltar as prostitues to toss around free of consequences as long as they do n't end in spanish hands , hm ? 
  if i were llanito i 'd feel offended . 
  gibraltar is by far the least relevant military point in the mediterranean . 
  the waters are swallow and the entrance to the mediterranean is controlled between rota and ceuta . 
  not to mention algeciras is closer to africa than the rock . 
  but i have to admit that the imaginarium the british press ( specially your beloved express and daily ) create around trafalgar and gibraltar and the complete avoidance of the english armada fall is amazing . 
  marx and goebbels would be proud . 
  because he 's still shitposting . 
  oh we 're so scared . 
  no , wait . 
  we 're not . 
  scaremongering british bigots at it again . 
  catalu\u00f1a did n't join spain . 
  catalu\u00f1a was born after the union of castilla and arag\u00f3n . 
  how 's that for addressing what he said ? 
  how about we now address the `` imminent franco danger '' propaganda that llanitos have to deal everyday , hm ? 
  what have you got to say about that ? 
  bigots and scaremongers . 
  yell `` franco is coming '' every odd day on the media to keep the gibraltarians happy with their current position . 
  even the rn has to deny the scaremongering your politicians toss around every time there 's joint operations in the mediterranean picardo spreads his propaganda that the uk is sending the royal navy to `` handle the spaniards '' . 
  it 's so ridiculous you 're putting your own country to shame . 
  * cough * gon na play victim and demand help from other countries again ? 
  * cough *, 
  shhh , brits like to think of wooden ships and forget about the english armada issue . 
  so it pretty much halved nearly everywhere . 
  though could be a result of gdp increasing and thus needing a lesser percentage for the same military . 
  oh look , if it is n't infowars ' account , are n't you the dipshit that posts conspiranoia in youtube and sells illuminati parafernalia in your website ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwlwq5ron_k and a newly made account from ` gibraltar ' answering questions from the same news media that claims that vaccines cause autism . 
  well , i guess autism fits the english behaviour in this matter .
