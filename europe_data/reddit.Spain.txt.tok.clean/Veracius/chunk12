   so your position is that if gibraltar do not accept joint sovereignty , spain will close the borders ? 
  they 'll always accuse bigotry and hostility . 
  it 's gibraltar 's job to do so . 
  ** translation ** -  the andalusian parliament approves an institutional declaration rejecting the `` xenophobic and offensive '' expressions of dolors bassa , who answered a question from citizens about young people who sniff glue in barcelona the plenary session of the andalusian parliament has issued an institutional statement signed on thursday by the five groups ( psoe , pp , podemos , c 's and iu ) , in which the `` xenophobic '' statements of the minister of labor are described as `` intolerable '' , social affairs and families of catalonia , dolors bassa , who has accused the regional government of andalusia of `` looking the other way '' in relation to unaccompanied minors , which causes these young people to go to their autonomous community . 
  citizens ' deputy carlos carrizosa called in the catalan parliament to bassa about the minors addicted to the glue of the streets of barcelona and other unaccompanied who come to the catalan capital . 
  the minister urged the spokesperson for the oranges to `` talk to their own , citizens of andalusia , and ask them why they come to catalonia '' these minors . 
  bassa explained that 10 % of the 70 unaccompanied minors arriving every month in catalonia do so `` with drug addictions '' , and that the generalitat , together with the barcelona city council , has provided an educator for each of these minors . 
  however , bassa ignited the controversy by ensuring that `` the majority '' of the seventy unaccompanied minors who arrive monthly to catalonia do so `` from other sites of the state because the other institutions look the other way . '', 
  in reference to the parliamentary stability that citizens provides to the andalusian government , bassa added that two of the territories of origin of the minors are andalusia and ceuta . 
  the insititucional declaration of the andalusian parliament , that has been read by its president , juan pablo dur\u00e1n , considers the intromission and the lack of rigor and respect to the childhood and the minors `` intolerable by the minister . 
  `` they are xenophobic and offensive to minors [ ... ] and threaten the social solidarity that must exist between all the autonomous communities , '' says the letter . 
  for this reason , the groups of other autonomous communities , and specifically the erc , are urged to respect the political and management autonomy of andalusia with regard to the protection of minors , `` where all cases are dealt with , respecting the rights of the childhood , without being disregarded and looking the other way . '', 
  at present there are 821 children , who live in specialized centers in andalusia . 
  they 're just not as fancy , apparently .

   reactionary bullshit * makes an extreme reaction against free speech * le leftist memes . 
  ah , the typical `` far right organization '' . 
  fash the bash , yes ? 
  if the left does n't agree with them , twist and abuse the laws to censor them . 
  it is . 
  gone wild !, 
  gond sexual !, 
  gone mad !, 
  in spain the left did this : https://adriboschmagazine.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/lgtb_0.jpg nevermind that high rates of inclusion , this is the kind of shit that only gets approved when it 's redundant . 
  waste of public money . 
  [ i ca n't take seriously an article that takes memes as fake news ] ( https://assets2.thebureauinvestigates.com/uploads/_storyimagesmall/xye-meme-1.jpg?mtime=20170226184907 ), 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmnfe-0vx_0 ), 
  eu : regulate all the things !, 
  i 'm genuinely proud of the amount of [ butthurt achieved ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sobyg9btf5a ) . 
  fallas are also every year too , you silly goofus mcdoofus . 
  carnaval , but cool . 
  also record downvotes , 21 downvotes in 5-10 minutes :d . the butthurt is real . 
  that could perfectly be mejillones en salsa verde , ajoaceite sauce and a cruzcampo :d, 
  stop trying to copy the fallas . 
  you 're not as cool as spain , germany . 
  since when it 's our fault for their use of our weaponry ? 
  i reckon the second republic would have liked more weapons during the civil war . 
  one thing is trade , the other is direct political support . 
  as for prosecution of international criminals , again it 's not our concern what happens within the borders of other countries , so long it does n't affect us . 
  to be more clear , we spanish people vote spanish institutions , we do n't vote for chinese or venezuelan institutions and i definitely do n't want to waste our money on acting as some sort of world police . 
  as for the gag law it 's a bloody shame as i 'm a libertarian and i 'd rather have the government put less restrictions on freedom , but a turn to the far left is not any better than that , specially when they have a record of re-configurating what freedom means in order to cut down on freedom of speech ( article 34 , constitution of 1931 , definition of act of aggression against the republic , defines as an act of aggression thoughts or speeches that may be against the republic and excludes them from freedom of speech ) . 
  as for the pacto antiterrorista it was signed in 2000 by pp and psoe , c 's was n't even in the parliament . 
  again , as a spaniard , my concerns are within spain , not outside . 
  having to pick , i 'd rather pick a bunch of bureaucrats rather than a bunch of bolivarianos . 
  for quoting `` some sentence in some protest '' he sure does it often . 
  and yes , of course they get shit , they politically support cuba and venezuela 's regime not to mention pablo worked for chavez some years ago ( recognized by himself in fort apache , [ but in other places too ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdlwsnm6fne ) ) , errej\u00f3n has worked for [ venezuela 's ministry of information ] ( http://www.correodelorinoco.gob.ve/entrevistas/%e2%80%9cel-aumento-capacidad-consumo-es-producto-revolucion-bolivariana%e2%80%9d/ ) ( i 'm not kidding here , it 's literally called venezuela 's ministry of popular power for communication and information , in case you think i 'm taking the piss : http://minci.gob.ve/ ) , and monedero 's scandal with venezuela is well known too . 
  you mean they are spreading fearmongering about themselves ? 
  kinda silly if you ask me , good fucking thing spain still has a somewhat educated middle-class . 
  this . 
  of course not , you 're a bonafide right wing republican , kappa . 
  well , the best way to avoid fearmongering so to not spread it yourself : `` el miedo va a cambiar de bando '' - pablo iglesias turri\u00f3n, 
  looks high, 
  if only we were as good at resisting far-left surges too .
