  but i guess with so many unemployed people it 's a daunting task to resist being told that the state can create your dream job . 
  that 's enough to get started with the language though . 
  with that level you can start reading some books and listen tomusic and understand some lyrics . 
  beautiful !, 
  cough english armada cough that went well . 
  to be fair some branches of buddhism think of some violence as ` mercy ' . 
  not a bad choice , but needs real practice to go with it . 
  not surprised , i am surprised by the general lack of response though . 
  yeah , it 's fake .

  i did n't mean to hurt your national feelings . 
  you need to chill , you have so much hate in you . 
  no need to insult , what 's gotten into you ? 
  seriously these portuguese and their attacks . 
  makes sense, 
  the same people that said that spain set up a nuclear bomb on portguese borders before making an study ? 
  they already decided on the outcome of the visit before visiting !, 
  spot on !, 
  jokes aside , i 've always wanted to learn german , i 've never had a good chance to , though . 
  always too busy with other stuff . 
  are you going to provide any source at any point or are you just going to keep bashing at me ? 
  portugal is not cooperating , the portuguese engineers canceled the visit !, 
  bad neighbors . 
  so why complain before you have any knowledge of the situation ? 
  as i said , the dramatization is unwelcome , and you 've shown your true colors . 
  thank you very much . 
  the portuguese republic is very much negligent in it 's international affairs !, 
  you 're not making sure of anything , you 're just pointing at us and demonizing us !, 
  http://expresso.sapo.pt/sociedade/2017-02-21-joanaz-de-melo-nao-existe-nada-para-negociar-relativamente-a-almaraz also , portugal is dependent about 75 % on imports for their energy , that 's why it does n't have nuclear plants !, 
  we 're building the nuclear plants you do n't want to build and then you throw stones at us !, 
   no portuguese authority visited the facilities in almaraz . 
  you mean portuguese engineers are n't trustworthy ? 
  a bit late ? 
  the eu was worse issues that could fracture it . 
  so now it 's `` tourists '' now , huh ? 
  the same `` tourists '' that had to buy the house to keep it from voyeurs ? 
  the portuguese engineers said on portugese tv that spain broke no laws !, 
  your dramatization is unwelcome !, 
  in case of nuclear problems spain is always the first affected and gets the worst of it !, 
  we 're the first interested in the project 's safety !, 
  you 're being silly about this whole notion that portugal should be concerned over evil spain !, 
  the portuguese engineers assured that spain broke no international laws !, 
  why do you try so hard to vilify spain ? 
  actually , we 've had plenty of lyrics for the anthem . 
  for instance : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wnahuahkfu there was even a version that mocked franco . 
  officially though , we do n't have lyrics . 
  it 's not our duty to carry out studies for other countries , it 's portugal 's . 
  portugal does n't want to make a study , they just want to start drama . 
  ** 100 km away from the border is not on the border ! ** . 
  do portugese people not get taught arithmetic in school ? 
  this serious lack of good faith from our neighbors is concerning !, 
  it 's important data , why does it bother you so much ? 
  some people claim it 's on the border , when in fact it 's ** 100 km away ** , newspapers should be truthful when writing articles , do n't you think ? 
  that aside , have a look at this [ gross case of exaggeration ] ( http://portugalresident.com/nuclear-waste-dump-on-tejo-river-begins-construction-%e2%80%9cin-next-few-days%e2%80%9d ) . 
  everything in that article is factually wrong . 
  there is clearly a victim 's syndrome tone in the whole matter , and it 's disgusting . 
  so engineers should n't have canceled the appointment , but it 's hard to say they 'd be neutral after all of this propaganda with `` spanish nuclear bombs on our borders '' bullshit . 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/portugal-nuclearpower-spain-idusl5n1f24mn  we are not saying there is necessarily an impact for portugal , but any potential impacts have to be properly studied , ** which has not been done ** , '' fernandes said . 
  you got it wrong , we do n't need to prove to you and you are going to be fine , you need to prove to us that it might be hazardous to you . 
  we have no reason to play into your victim mentality politics . 
  next to our borders : ** 100km away ** . 
  okno . 
  have you even read the article ? 
  your minister does n't want to study the possibility of a real impact inside portugal , but would sue us . 
  i ca n't possibly be said that the republic of portugal is acting in good faith . 
  nonsense , portuguese minister of environment claimed they would ** file a complain without even studying the case ** . 
  the wastes are ** 100km away from portuguese borders ** , portugal is being as obtuse as it can be in this matter . 
  furthermore , the wastes are inside spain 's borders , the tone and method used by the portuguese for this is , improper , at the very least , and only shows the underlying hispanophobic tone of our not-so-friendly neighbors . 
  even joanaz de melo said that spain did n't infringe any law , and said that almaraz is being used as a diplomatic weapon against spain . 
  the location of the waste is ** 100km away ** from the border with portugal . 
  portuguese minister of environment said that a possible impact of the waste on portugal 's environment ** was n't even studied ** , but they 'll file a complaint anyway . 
  locals had been been trying to bribe the house owner to get a look inside out of morbid curiosity . 
  google translate lisbon withdraws the complaint against madrid after the mediation of jean-claude juncker pablo r. suanzes correspondent brussels 21/02/2017 13 : 18espa\u00f1a and portugal , with the mediation of the president of the european commission , jean-claude juncker , have reached an amicable agreement so that the tensions for the possible cemetery of nuclear waste of the power station of almaraz do not follow climbing . 
  in a statement issued today by the three parties , rajoy and costa point out that `` in view of the immense economic , social and geopolitical challenges facing the european union today , we must concentrate our efforts on addressing these challenges . 
  , disputes between member states that are traditional allies must be resolved quickly , in a spirit of cooperation and consensus . 
  `` at the end of last year , the spanish council of ministers gave the green light to the almaraz cemetery in the province of caceres . 
  did not like anything in the neighboring country where the `` lack of loyalty among neighbors '' was denounced . 
  the portuguese parliament condemned the decision and on 16 january filed a complaint against spain under article 259 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union . 
  the neighboring government understood neither the background nor the forms . 
  they were offended by unilateralism in a matter that they consider of the utmost importance and which affects the security of the nation so close ( 100 kilometers ) of its borders . 
  the plant already has the pools that it uses for the waste very close to its maximum capacity , reason why the executive has authorized the construction of the silo that generates discordia.en the mediation of juncker both countries have lowered the tone and accepted to collaborate . 
  `` the friendly agreement , which is attached to this joint statement , commits spain and portugal in a process of constructive consultation and dialogue to resolve the controversy over the construction of a nuclear waste storage facility at the almaraz nuclear power plant . 
  the visit and the consultation process will allow the parties to analyze and take into account the legitimate reserves of the project and to take proportionate measures to dissipate them `` explains the document . 
  the portuguese prime minister and rajoy had a bilateral meeting in malta at the eu summit a few weeks ago . 
  now , madrid is committed to share `` with portugal all relevant environmental and nuclear safety information and will facilitate it , if necessary , with a view to ensuring that the project does not have significant repercussions on portuguese territory '' and '' as soon as possible , a visit by the portuguese authorities to the plant in order to present to them the technology and safety features envisaged , in addition to all necessary information and clarification meetings '' , with the presence of the juncker team in them . 
  in addition , and most importantly , spain undertakes not to issue or execute `` the authorization to begin operations of the nuclear waste warehouse until the portuguese authorities have examined the relevant information and the visit has been carried out . '', 
  in the next two months , spain shall not take any `` irreversible measure '' and `` shall consider and take into consideration , in good faith and in a constructive spirit , any legitimate reservations expressed by portugal concerning the project and shall be taken into account , for the sake of good neighborly relations , any proportionate measure that may serve to address the legitimate reservations expressed by portugal . 
  `` in return , lisbon '' will undertake , by virtue of contacts made in favor of an amicable agreement , to withdraw the complaint submitted under article 259 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union ( tfeu ) , without prejudice to the possibility of relying on article 259 tfeu in future . '', 
  that is to say , i agree but reserving a bullet in case there is no understanding after these months of consultation and dialogue . 
  flag of spain ? 
  check suddenly i like slovenia a bit more . 
  and our typical portuguese victimist , this thread is so grossly typical of anti-spanish propaganda . 
  nevermind that if afterwards you call a referendum vote to derogate the decision you 'll get bashed for `` anti-democratic '' . 
  according to crazy totally not biased british bigots , we do . 
  you went full retard this time . 
  `` subscribe to read '' . 
  and boy what do we have , the same brit who keeps spamming sensationalist news about spain . 
  why do n't you ask thsun for a job , they 'll like you . 
  do n't be fooled , we just invaded ireland . 
  agreed .
