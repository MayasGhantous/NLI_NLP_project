  i read the article , you 're in no right no modify the title to suit your feelings or pov . 
  this article is , but you tend to ** rewrite ** the titles . 
  i 've also seen leftists putting bombs , what 's the deal ? 
  being from spain you should know about eta , or from catalonia hearing about terra lliure ? 
  also if that 's a terrorist attack i do n't know what you call the bombing of barajas ? 
  oh i get it , left 's class struggle . 
  k . that video is so fucking ridiculous , the only physical aggression was a man shoved , and he was trying to keep the assholes in , who shortly left . 
  sure they 're scumbags , but they 're not blowing people with bombs , your comparison is terrible . 
  also , they asked 17 years for these assholes in prison , for breaking a glass and shoving some old man . 
  k. seriously you leftists have the best of victim 's syndrome . 
  sure , of course not . 
  it 's not like the `` tolerant liberal left '' made a fucking riot at a university and started burning shit because a conservative was doing a talk . 
  free speech ? 
  only if you 're a liberal tolerant leftist !, 
  what , you 're a white american male ? 
  fuck you , we 'll riot if you try to voice out your opinion . 
  ** cough cough uc berkeley cough cough ** also , assuming only white male american fascists vote trump , holy shit you 're dumb . 
   what about his wife ? 
  you keep dodging the topic and pulling new strawmans . 
  quite ironic , is n't it ? 
  reporting in ? 
  they went full potato on this . 
  `` calls on spain to use force to prevent a referendum '' is different than `` if the brother-in-law of the king can go to jail , so can artur mas '' . 
  also i take take shit from a bigot guiri who thinks better than the locals , specially if you keep asking personal information of locals over the internet . 
  `` calls on spain to use force to prevent a referendum '' is different than `` if the brother-in-law of the king can go to jail , so can artur mas '' . 
  also i take take shit from a bigot guiri who thinks better than the locals , specially if you keep asking personal information of locals over the internet . 
  yeah and his family !, 
  you went full trumpster . 
  `` proper justice for once '' . 
  what , it is n't justice when you do n't like it ? 
  as per usual , bigots going to be bigots , leftists going to be leftists . 
  you ca n't take them seriously . 
  false title , you manipulated it . 
  fake news . 
  you 're the impersonation of bigotry , hm ? 
  got nothing good to show for your own country and you intend to cause trouble in mine ? 
  oh boy , the same brit spamming news about spain , what a surprise . 
  got nothing else to do with your life , bigot ? 
  what a load of nonsense . 
  the only colonies in which infrastructure was barely ever built was in africa , as far as i know . 
  to complain that spain did n't build infrastructure in the americas is nonsense . 
  you can see spanish architecture widely in california for instance . 
  not to mention we brought the first european cattle and horses to the americas . 
  which allowed cities to prosper . 
   defeat of the spanish armada ( lets not talk about the english armada ) history of england-spanish relations in one sentence . 
  yeah , let 's look at south africa , that turned out really well . 
  keep it yksinkertainen stupid !, 
  resorting to personal attacks eh ? 
  right liberal republicans 1931 votes : 5.3 % 1933 votes : 0.6 % 1936 votes : 1.2 % sure , keep saying they sent franco to deal with the red revolt in asturias . 
  such power , much decision !, 
  governed ? 
  partido republicano progresista : 1931-1936 , governed ? 
  yes . 
  i do n't take hints from an etarra . 
  honestly republicans blaming other republicans for the oppression during the republic just proves my point further , you should get another argument . 
  republican right-wing . 
  you just killed me there , [ brah ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djvajfkyy40 ) . 
  you wo n't see the republicans complain about that though . 
  start of the civil war : 1936 . 
  red revolution : 1934 . 
  belligerents : spanish republic vs pose , ugt , cnt where your fascists at ? 
  the worker unions or the republicans ? 
  derp , no . 
  also , `` fascists '' aka , everyone who is n't a marxist-leninist , got prosecuted and shot by the government forces . 
  of course they 'd raise against that , holy shit . 
  though policing will always get this , it 's not a matter of ideology . 
  fascism is n't born out of thin air , but from oppression . 
  deal with it already . 
  get in your tiny mind that today 's spaniards are inheritors of neither side from the civil war and that we do n't want oppression from neither , so we will justify neither . 
  nevermind that i 'm not glorifying the dictatorship , but condemning both the republic and the dictatorship . 
  yeah , i 'm such a horrible person . 
  dragged , right . 
  it 's not like political prosecution and mass shootings by the republic made people shit scared to the point where they fought for their lives . 
  the red revolutions ? 
  all fascist lies right ? 
  many of them are from europe . 
  good riddance , they 're ugly as fuck . 
  pre-constitutional flags are illegal , the difference is shitty marxist-leninists think you can twist words and get away with anything . 
  in the second republic they could shot you for though crime . 
  in fact , they did over and over and over until the population exploded and preferred a civil war over the republic . 
  goddamn right . 
  the provisional government of second spanish republic redefined what is free speech to brainwash people into thinking they they talk what they wanted , then proceeded to shot people charging them with `` aggression against the republic '' i.e. 
  thinking kind of like kings . 
  basically execution on though crime . 
  they 're bigots and marxists , you ca n't help it . 
  rich , coming from a republican . 
  trying to start another civil war , huh ? 
  wo n't get so far this time . 
  well , according to the article 34 of the constitution of the second republic you could get sent to jail or fusilated for saying you 're a monarchic . 
  we will always remember ** paracuellos ** , while you mop for some jail time , radical leftists . 
  the republic started a civil war , and it 's as much an illegal flag as the francoist one . 
  hilarious and original , just like iceland 's president . 
  why is that flag even on twitter ? 
  that 's the flag of the sons of a bitch that started the spanish civil war . 
  does it excuse you from holocaust denial ? 
  also , please stop chasing me around and answering my posts , you 're unwelcome . 
  yeah , keep ignoring the fact that he 's basically inciting a civil war , while still complaining about the last civil war . 
  leftist logic !, 
  how to become a martyr , by leftists : 1 . 
  make a culture piece about glorifying terrorism .
