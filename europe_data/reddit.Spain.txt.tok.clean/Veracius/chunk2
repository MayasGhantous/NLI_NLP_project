  trumpmerica best america . 
  that was quite the parody . 
  so erdogan first calls germany a haven of terrorists , then the turkish opposition gets terror charges . 
  logic went 404 not found, 
  is that a giant star trek themed dildo ? 
  relevant : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8j-rxz41-y kill people , burn shit , fuck school, 
  you mean erdogan came for the gulenists and stayed for the coup !, 
  direct democracy , you mean anarchy ? 
  a dictatorship project . 
  i bet boris johnson has a premium membership in 4chan . 
  portuguese irredentist scum using galician flag . 
  this would make for a good final fantasy game plot . 
  maybe if we drain the mediterranean there 's cthulu down there . 
  who knows ? 
  we 're going to have to change the slogan from 420 blaze it to ... 1492 enci\u00e9ndelo ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  breaking news : putin declares that if russia does n't win eurovision he will point another european country as potential nuclear target at random . 
  will decide with a custom made d&d dice . 
  well , thanks for the lesson in dutch politics . 
  it 's a bit odd someone would say criminal x-nationals rather than criminal foreigners or some such . 
  so if i understand properly , his party is anti-eu , right-wing/conservative and anti-foreigners ? 
  sounds kind of like the ukip , but dutch . 
  does moroccan mean moroccan exclusively or does it have other connotations in this context ? 
  could any dutch elaborate on what was the trial exactly about ? 
  you 's it !, 
  agreed , interesting stuff . 
  berlin is pushing for some ** block magic ** * badum tss *, 
  is that a book ? 
  if they dropped that on the ground i 'm pretty sure we 'd have a nuclear holocaust . 
  probably more common in bigger cities . 
  but i 've never seen people do trick or treat . 
  in spain only businesses celebrate halloween . 
  we might need to start moving is news to / r/madlads / . 
  i think this thread is a duplicate of this one : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/59prtx/angela_merkel_internet_search_engines_are/, 
  `` we 're bad , but they 're worse '' i think you 're more spanish than you 'd like to let on . 
  i do n't think being leftist and betraying voters are opposites . 
  might be your train of though , but being clean is n't something exclusive of the left , and being a corrupt is n't something exclusive of the right . 
  i wish people got their shit together before making shitty political statements . 
  just for the sake of fun . 
  i 'm going to point out that vater in spanish means toilet . 
  no , not everyone can edit wikipedia . 
  articles can be locked by mods/admins . 
  edits may be reverted by watching users or even bots . 
  edits made by `` nobodies '' may even be flagged as vandalism and automatically deleted . 
  it 's far from being `` free '' as in `` freedom '' . 
  this thread has been officially taken by t\u00edo pepe http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1752122/images/o-tio-pepe-facebook.jpg, 
  search engines are the tip at best . 
  i personally do n't like how wikipedia can give monopoly of editing pages to certain groups of people , as the internet is used more and more as a source for education this is bound to distort the perception of any given topic . 
  ngos with a political agenda worry me the most . 
  but i agree , i do wonder what 's the motivation . 
  every country at any point has more than one `` current issue '' at a time , i do n't see why ` some ' people parrot reply `` x has other issues currently '' . 
  any issue is to be considered and addressed . 
  my name is jos\u00e9 and i do n't take an offense to that . 
  fite my jos\u00e9ness one on one bruh ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  that is pretty much the summary of the communist manifesto . 
  to define yourself by your adversary . 
  i think it 's a great time to see examples of this , i see many people having an identity because `` they 're not x '' rather than because they formed an identity of their own . 
  not irrelevant in the slightest . 
  so with morocco too . 
  every time there 's a talk about spain-gibraltar the uk yells ceuta and melilla . 
  i agree with letting russia refill in spanish territories . 
  `` legitimacy of a unilateral referendum '' . 
  we do n't pretend it did n't happen , we just know it happened to our parents , not us . 
  we do n't want to pay for the mistakes we did n't make . 
  i was born in 89 , franco was already dead for 14 years . 
  i was going to say he did n't `` invent '' gravity , he only discovered/describe/formulate it . 
  but this answer is so much better . 
  this is wrong on so many levels , podemos said they 'd support the referendum and the catalan process . 
  and the psc just flips sides every time they see a chance to get more voters . 
  it 's hard not to . 
  but i do n't think brits who left the uk for spain necessarily behave like that son of a bitch . 
  although with the amount of race relate incidents the uk has , it might just be a ticking bomb . 
  so what future are we shaping right now ? 
  now we 're getting our fill of other kinds of extremism sadly . 
  what manifested in the uk as brexit , in france as lepen , in italy as lega nord , in greece as syriza and golden dawn ... is propelling the extremism elsewhere too . 
  including spain , see catalan nationalism . 
  i would n't be surprised if catalonia had an outbreak of far right in response as well . 
  these people wo n't just understand two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  to further ridicule your rhetoric , france completely wiped out anything that was not french . 
  see the french shame `` vergonha '' . 
  also , you suppose that spaniards that have nothing to do with said people or acts should be held accountable ? 
  you 're a brainwash hack job . 
  the catalan proposal of creating new victims to replace old ones is stupid . 
  their most notable import was oil and credit for the francoist rebels during the civil war , sadly . 
  you 're not a victim , you 're a perpetrator . 
  two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  two criminals attacking each other do n't make one victim , or two . 
  your brainwash nationalist rhetoric does n't add up . 
  so two wrongs make one right ? 
  is that your point ? 
  pathetic .

  catalans have been burning spanish flags for decades , you get no right to complain now . 
  they already removed it though . 
  get denied then . 
  you read well . 
  straight to what matters , huh ? 
  hero !, 
  radioactive cow !, 
  do n't care , hard ai , can spawn units out of thin air .
