  this is war, 
  what is the `` threat of our world '' ? 
  they look like donkeys with all that fur . 
  looks like a prison to me . 
  groundhog day . 
  at least it has portugal . 
  cute , looks like a little lady with the white stains around the eyes , kinda like makeup . 
  the wife of barros\u00f5 !, 
  til the uk invoked article 50 . 
  so elections are an iq test , and if you do n't vote as these guys you fail . 
  interesting tolerant-liberal view . 
  / r/europe taken over by the welsh . 
  420 cow it . 
  the cattle brought by the spanish conquistadors to the americas . 
  picture : corriente cattle in california . 
  they 're fairly small , athletic , require little water , little space and are really easy to take care , requiring minimal help from humans in their calving . 
  why not ricola cow ? 
  teenage mutant ninja cattle !, 
  well , everytime we make an answer about why catalonia should remain a part of spain they just dodge it , or call us fascists , so in our experience it goes nowhere . 
  you ca n't reason with this . 
  video is subtitled in english . 
  http://www.lasprovincias.es/20130215/mas-actualidad/sociedad/catalunya-china-alianza-nuclear-201302151146.html also i think blocking something that could collaterally damage spain is legitimate . 
  honestly , without all this shit i would have been ( and i 've been in the past ) in favor of a referendum . 
  video 's tl ; dr : if catalans do n't get what we want , we will call for chinese nuclear submarines into the mediterranean and threaten eu countries to persuade them to please us . 
  the actions of many invalidate the concerns of many , though . 
  the propaganda is very real . 
  they involved the people in it and promised them utopia . 
  so is the support real or was it fabricated through this ?

  i 'd say their salary depends on wether people stay riled up about the whole thing , otherwise they might need to get a job outside government positions . 
  maybe you understand why i 'm so skeptic about the groundhog process . 
  it 's actually kind of cute . 
  would n't mind one as a pet . 
  i actually have a morkie pet with cinnamon colored hair and looks like a miniature highland cow . 
  groundhog day . 
  he just wants a glass of juice . 
  we would post bulls , but we already made burgers out of them !, 
  do scottish politicians hold manifestations claiming that england rapes women , kill children and steal their money daily , on their national day ? 
  oh , so we ca n't post about catalonia ... but you can post about everything ? 
  k. just remember to build a great wall to hold off tourists , and keep taking pictures of your governors pissing in the street . 
  how so ? 
  i must admit the mind of tv3 watchers is quite interesting . 
  relevant https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud-mcphjttw, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_self-determination_referendum,_2014 ca n't tell if troll or troll . 
  make pepe great again !, 
  well is n't that a fun comment considering how you keep going around threads about catalan secessionism demanding that spain give the right to hold a referendum . 
  and according to catalans support was 80 % several years ago and keeps increasing . 
  i 'd vote to offer a referendum to the city of london from the rest of the uk . 
  the day parties with a political agenda realize that `` what i want or what i want '' is not a feasible political option then it might be easier to reach agreements , until then , you may keep throwing a tantrum .

  well fuck political correctness , you 're fired . 
   you though i was a christian refugee , but it 's me , dio !, 
  ftfy . 
  something tells me that 's not a healthy thing to do http://www.lasprovincias.es/20130215/mas-actualidad/sociedad/catalunya-china-alianza-nuclear-201302151146.html video is subbed in english . 
  according to catalan mayors prostitution is madrid 's fault and prostitution does n't exist in france http://www.ccma.cat/tv3/alacarta/programa/baixa-el-percentatge-de-prostitucio-a-girona/video/4462413/ totally not insane people . 
  by the way , both from public catalonian tv , totally not propaganda . 
  yes , several times . 
  before : 80 % of catalans in favor of independence after : the amount of catalans in favor of independence has risen to 46.8 % !, 
  reliable as fuck . 
  winter is coming . 
  this shit does n't make any sense . 
  i am aware . 
  make politically motivated economic sanctions great again !, 
  me , technocratic fascist . 
  that would be the title of a good anarcho-capitalist themed book . 
  i disagree , i think italy 's pm is a better choice . 
   i think the real issue , as the article mentions , is that they are n't paid enough for the location . 
  the rest is just clickbait . 
  no doubt it probably is a nightmare of a job , but the quotes given are more likely just the grumbles of a couple of officers they spoke to rather than the real roadblock to filling positions . 
  i would have thought if it was such a big issue they could just pay each officer a few hundred extra for the trouble , since we 're only talking ~ 280 officers here . 
  and the answer  yean , it 's a clickbait . 
  of course , if you get paid the same you go where you like it the most . 
  i 've read other sources and they just say it 's a thankless job , none of them said they 're scared or anything remotely similar . 
  why would you want to deal with drunkards when you can be sent to a small homely town of 3000 people and pretty much get paid to stroll and assist in one or two petty incidents a year ? 
  the wage is the same . 
  this is further below in the comments . 
   greece faces ` explosive ' surge in public debt ** again ** , imf warns ftfy, 
  here they are a bit less discriminating , regular homes are a-ok too . 
  but yes , pretty much the same shit . 
  that a mayor is supporting this and pissing off tourists though ... 
  some people need to get their shit together ... http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/cataluna/2016-05-31/abuela-okupas-gracia-mossos-barcelona_1209035/, 
  do the occupy people in the uk forcefully occupy other people 's homes ? 
  i think you call them squatters ? 
  anti-system obsessed people who occupy houses and refuse to form part of society . 
  ada colau ( barcelona 's mayor - member of a merger party of podemos and pro-independence and anti-capitalist political parties ) has been letting them occupy houses and has had a campaign against tourists for a while . 
  recently they used public money to buy an forcefully occupied place for a bunch of squatters . 
  it 's quite the shitfest . 
  edit : typical okupas : http://ep01.epimg.net/sociedad/imagenes/2009/10/15/actualidad/1255557614_850215_0000000000_sumario_normal.jpg http://i61.tinypic.com/netg04.jpg, 
  a voyeur brit and a sex-shy austrian . 
  quite the couple . 
  yean , it 's a clickbait . 
  of course , if you get paid the same you go where you like it the most .

  i suppose you did not get the sarcasm . 
  it 's a clickbait article . 
  if we send the guardia civil the place might just become empty overnight : ' c, 
  ada colau ( barcelona 's mayor ) is fucking retarded . 
  they 're giving out free houses to okupas and telling tourists not to come .
