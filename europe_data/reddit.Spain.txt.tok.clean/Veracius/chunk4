  the left ca n't get their shit straight . 
  might give you the rabies if they bite you !, 
  local police do n't deal with violence , civil guard do . 
  local police are little more than administrative . 
  nevermind that might be fake news anyway . 
  i remember that one time they asked what was the chance i 'd do a 3 month unpaid internship in barcelona . 
  i live in castell\u00f3n . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ itsnotlikeihopetheygetcancer :d, 
  in which case it might be something like that 1,1 k $ -1,2 k $ plus 500 $ -600 $ social overhead . 
  grats . 
  now go say the same here https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5qj439/average_wage_rates_in_europe/, 
  maybe it takes into consideration social overhead ( 1/3 of your gross salary ) . 
  lol :d, 
  i love how germans say geld ( similar to gold but french say argent ( silver ) . 
  no , i want everything to be translated , as i 've pointed out several times . 
  not to mention i can read it in spanish and i do n't need the translation , i just think it 's the right thing to do . 
  no partiality , no bullshit . 
  and entry level job positions are nearly non-existant . 
  or maybe it 's implied if not noted that the felon is a natural of that country ? 
  hmmm , surely a foreign committing a crime is not as common as a national ? 
  or maybe we 're all racists and we all should feel bad , boo hoo . 
  how about this : let 's not censor information by avoiding to translate it . 
  the tex-mex border tower , famous for containing the mexican illegal immigrants , it 's true , believe me . 
  gustave eiffer was a great tower builder , he is an american hero . 
  it 's true . 
  i believe i already pointed out a neutral reason why the whole article should be translated . 
  for once i agree with the brits . 
  why is information not relevant ? 
  why should some parts be censored because they 're not politically correct ? 
  i do n't care for the race , but i care for the entire article to be translated . 
  oh god not again, 
  portugal had no miss 1930 ? 
  english voices , spanish captions . 
  ** video description ** published on jan 22 , 2017 an extract of a muslim conference for peace ( sic ) celebrated in norway in which the assistants deny being radicals , even though they 're in favour of lapidation , death penalty to homosexuals and islamic law ; such things . 
  can you refurbish and re-register a car ? 
  a sad thing portuguese police are n't taking animal cruelty as seriously in their own country . 
  uk does not have a constitution . 
  hint : you 're an hypocrite . 
  `` english ( uk ) '' . 
  keep living inside your little box . 
  * typical edl fanatic voice * a convincing argument right there , you hear you focking scots ? 
  you better focking keep in the union !, 
  now seriously , scotland negotiating with england and north ireland would be easier than england with the eu , trade deals with two countries instead of 26 . 
  apply for eu membership in the meantime . 
  i 've already explained a thousand times that immigrants were allowed to vote and catalans who were outside catalonia at the moment did n't . 
  which explains the low turnout rate of 37 % . 
  80 % of 37 % is 29.6 % . 
  such convincing yes vote . 
  is she ? 
  they already voted no , but i guess your bigot press does n't inform you of that , 
  you mean american ? 
  because the uk does n't have jack shit on `` english '' , just check autocorrectors tell you how to write color or favor , 
  i 'm not british yet . 
  in spain wages are both negotiated between employers and unions , but the government can also set a minimum . 
  the negotiation can only improve the minimum set . 
  typical , if they ever go alone they just hit and run . 
  they 're little shits . 
  copying someone else 's message and changing left for right only makes you look like a dipshit . 
  the right on the rise ? 
  how so ? 
  unidos podemos , a political party who is openly marxist-leninist , pro-second republic , and who has a record of ridiculing everyone with a different point of view is second in votes . 
  if anything they 're managing to antagonize people from different ideologies against them . 
  i would add she mentioned that she was told `` slut , bitch , we will kill you !, 
  so like in the second spanish republic where leftists would massacre people who `` may not be republican '' , a.k.a. 
  though crime massacres . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paracuellos_massacres https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_terror_ ( spain ) you do n't know if what you said is true or not but hey , kristallnacht and though crime massacres to everyone who does n't support left ideals , it 's not we already went through a civil war and 36 years of dictatorship because this . 
  did we ? 
  also , they offered plenty of sources for this , and was aired on tv during news programs in pretty much all channels . 
  also , what flag do they expect us to use , the republican flag ? 
  fuck them !, 
  if they wan na take on us then we will oblige [ again ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_civil_war ) . 
  you can help pay the wall for drumpf !, 
  funny coming from brexiteering land . 
  mandatory anti-spanish dutch joke . 
  it 's funny because communists in spain burned churches for great lulz . 
  it is called bulgaria . 
  we have an actual beacon close to where i live , everytime ti pass by i remember dragon age 1 mission when they send you to light the beacon . 
  asens of ariandel ! ... 
  ... bad joke . 
  in the nl and pretty much everywhere , except countries with strict policies in favor of natality . 
  uk can into the baltics . 
  he needs a chill pill . 
  http://www.onepeterfive.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/commufix1-1024x490.png hopefully not shaped in the likeliness of a communist symbol . 
  i think the movie is set in spain . 
  i likey waterfall thingy . 
  would have been better is death was a muslim . 
  missed chance : ' c, 
  careful , republicans might hang you for that !, 
  ayy lmao nice find though . 
  is n't latvia the country that has their ministers busy talking shit about spain and demanding catalonian secession ? 
  http://catalanmonitor.com/2017/01/09/latvia-disauthorizes-spains-slander-over-support-for-catalan-independence-process/ http://www.catalanviews.com/node/156 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_way http://www.catalannewsagency.com/politics/item/latvia-and-lithuania-say-the-press-offered-a-biased-version-of-their-prime-ministers-statements-on-catalonia just let latvia burn , to be honest . 
  why defend a country that insists on going against our interests . 
  latvia does n't even get anything out of going against spain , such a spiteful country . 
  spaaaaace https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pb5ikqegaok, 
  europe , you 're fired !, 
  i agree , bin laden was neutral as fuck . 
  not from the us but wanting to see them collapsed . 
  you forget you 're dealing with a special snowflake , he think she 's big because he spends money abroad . 
  nevermind that unemployment is n't 25 % ( probably heard about it and though it was a great idea to parrot it without checking it up ) . 
  and you know what , they 're not your tourists , they 're your citizens , and they have their shitty attitude back home as well .
