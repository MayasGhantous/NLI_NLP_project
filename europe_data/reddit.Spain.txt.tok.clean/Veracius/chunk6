  so to summarize the `` referendum '' ... * immigrants were allowed to vote * minors were allowed to vote * catalans who were outside catalonia at the day of the referendum were ** not ** allowed to vote so we have this situation in which people who might be against independence get ** zero votes ** , people who might be in favor of independence get ** one or more votes ** and people who just have no idea what 's this whole thing about get to vote , based on the other people 's opinion . 
  so this citation ...  actually 80 % of catalonians voted `` yes '' for independence is false , as the vote was manipulated to allow non-catalans with views favorable to independentism to vote and disallow catalans with unfavorable views to independentism to vote . 
  optimistic are n't you ? 
  i never though the vatican would be so right o_o, 
  50 % minus one vote :d, 
  pujol has been the figurehead of independentism for a long time , but he was caught in a corruption case , along with pretty much his entire family . 
  the difference is , he and his cronies are free from repercussion , even though the police documents clearly stated they were stealing money from the region of catalu\u00f1a . 
  because it 's not a scare tactic , they eu already pointed this out . 
  secession means leaving the eu . 
  joining could be possible , but it 's not an easy task , and everyone 's got ta be on the same wagon to let someone join , not whataboutisms here . 
  for instance , spain applied in 1977 , but joined in 1986 , nearly a decade after applying . 
  finally somebody gets it . 
  high five for ya , old chap . 
  very spanish !, 
  the arguments given for pro-secession sentiment are always historical or monetary anyway .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_countries they want annexation of territories of france , italy , spain and the entire annexation of andorra on top of independence based on some sort of monetary or historical pseudo-argument . 
  http://sompaisoscatalans.cat/ and yes , it 's actually a political agenda : http://www.esquerra.cat/partit/projecte-politic/projecte-ppcc, 
  that 's some hardcore telecommunication system . 
  well it was interesting watching and listening to common folk , though i get the feeling their anger and disappointment is misdirected . 
  i know my cousin is working in lisbon as an aeronautic engineer . 
  ^ ... i 'll ^ plot ^ with ^ him ^ to ^ blow ^ the ^ portuguese ^ parliament http://otium.fundacionasimov.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/v_mask_2.jpg, 
  that 's some pretty cool stuff , if he 'd pass nearby my house i 'd offer him free food and gazpacho 8d, 
  the way that you put it is rather obtuse though . 
  it 's not spain not giving away andalucia , it 's andalucia not giving away spain . 
  what i ** know ** is that i 'm andalusian and you 're talking shit , that 's what i know . 
  we 're proud to be spanish . 
   i think spain will hang on to whatever it can get , it still occupies parts of morocco and portugal ffs it 's not giving up anadalucia what the fuck are you talking about , chump ? 
  are you high or something ? 
  immigrants that are not granted asylum will storm the fence anyway . 
  democracy = = dictatorship huh ? 
  but muh hypocresy !, 
  sure , let 's kill eachother everytime we have a fit . 
  independence and constitution changes are opposites , and you do n't get to have the cake and eat it . 
  / logic, 
  again , assuming there are only galician , catalan , basque and spanish in spain . 
  so much for `` catalan supression '' . 
  `` monolingual regions '' . 
  assuming there 's only one way to speak spanish , or that all languages had the same recognition . 
  silly basque with his silly privileges . 
  just recently france told catalonia to respect france 's integrity . 
  apparently not a lot of people abroad realize that catalonia wants to annex parts of other countries . 
  you have serious issues . 
  subjugated children is the only thing i see here . 
  and that franco pseudo-argument is false . 
  support for independence was low until the financial crisis of 2008 . 
  independentism is nothing but a false cure for misery . 
  you mean suppression of republicanism and freedoms everywhere in spain under franco ? 
  because my parents did go through that shit , and i do n't have to take it from you now . 
  for the generation of spaniards that were born in the democracy ` national-regionalism ' is the closest it gets to another dictatorship . 
  eta , terra lliure , and all of the crap that goes after that . 
  it 's by far not the point of self-determination . 
  hey , i want your house and your wife because self-determination . 
  self-determination is not a blank check or a get out of jail free card . 
  i fail to see how you 're not indoctrinating the children to hate spain and support a political movement in the 21st century for a battle that happened in the 17th century .

  ** translation ** this is how they indoctrinate children in a school in cambrils by reenacting a passage of the `` reapers ' war '' . 
  for the political party of albert rivera , the teachers are indoctrinating the alumni in their scenification of the battle that took place in 1640 and in which 23.000 royal army combatants died . 
  `` kill everybody '' and `` destroy the spanish army '' , are said by the children , one of which interprets felipe iv , which repeats the words that the teachers tell them . 
  even though the video was removed from youtube , it has been shared through twitter . 
  * the first twitter says ... * observe how they indoctrinate they children of `` guillem fortuny '' school in cambrils against the `` treacherous spaniards '' . 
  repulsive . 
  `` felisuco '' has been this direct in his twitter account : `` i ca n't believe this !!!, 
  indoctrination based on historical falsehood . 
  they have no limits . '' * the second twitter says ... * i ca n't believe this !!!, 
  indoctrination based on historical falsehood . 
  they have no limits .
