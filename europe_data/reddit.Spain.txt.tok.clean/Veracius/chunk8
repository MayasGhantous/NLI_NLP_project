  the people are tired of experts !, 
  i say just forbid all royal navy in spanish waters , see how they administer gibraltar without having access to it . 
  i say next time a royal navy ship goes into spanish waters the spanish navy fires at them too , that would work , right ? 
  http://www.gibnet.com/fish/waters.gif it happens that you ca n't get into gibraltar without going through spanish waters , but that 's none of our business , you violate our waters we take you down . 
  sounds diplomatic , huh ? 
  all the uk territorial claims wo n't change the fact that for the royal navy to get to gibraltar they need to get through spanish waters . 
  i remember a rt episode of breaking the set had pretty much this exact list . 
  what is this nonsense ? 
  just like jesus as king of poland ? 
  keep calm and wank on . 
  rule 34 !, 
  now we need a picture of the politicians fucking the porn industry . 
  yes . 
  there have been protests . 
  though many were seen as misdirected or as provocations . 
  there 's little political consensus on how to tackle the issue . 
  just as i pointed in another comment , many people against bullfighting buy into the rhetoric of `` tradition , culture '' when in reality it 's a matter of money , but protesters never talk about the conflict of interest . 
  also , just for the sake of completion , this exact `` festivity '' happens in catalonia too , even when the bullfighting ban was on . 
  because they consider `` bou embolat '' to be a-ok while `` spanish bullfighting '' is torture . 
  could be worse , they could be drunk uk marines https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/feb/19/gibraltar.world, 
  so if we 're against it let 's call it for what it is , not for what they want it to be called . 
  it 's not about `` tradition '' or `` culture '' , it 's about money . 
  i do n't see how ranting about `` traditionalists '' is a good point against bullfighting . 
  you mean this ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxak91pltmi i did n't know portugal did that but i could see leapers replacing bullfighting and might be feasible as opposed to banning bullfighting . 
  i disagree , i think it 's more of a conflict of interests . 
  also , the animalist party is a joke . 
  because politics are more complicated than that . 
  i do n't think in 2016 an developed country like denmark would need to mass kill endangered whales to get food . 
  we all know when reds govern they always ban bullfighting right ? 
  i think they might come up with their own alternatives like vk instead of facebook . 
  kind of like china ? 
  did the number of muslims in the uk double ? 
  time to blame people who do n't want this shit happening for this shit happening !, 
  wild reasonable person appears !, 
  run you ran away successfully !, 
  i 'm against . 
  they 're on super saiyarightjin 3 !, 
  even if you you cut their hair it grows back .

  you 've unlocked : the great betrayal http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/steam_achievements_in_civ5/the_great_betrayal, 
  i bet they catch a few with these questions . 
  never underestimate human stupidity . 
  yet !, 
  up in queue , erdogan backs referendum to block reddit . 
  oh democracy , you ;'d, 
   you will live a ~ ~ long and ~ ~ happy life . 
  fixed that for you, 
  i see that greece is a huge fc barcelona fan !, 
  maybe it 's an act ? 
  this is bound to change soon , i think . 
  also they forgot to paint a bit of galicia . 
  for great lulz . 
  which of them all ? 
  i would n't take vice seriously . 
  some countries are more prone to subbing than dubbing . 
  since the netherlands is more on the subbing side i assume it 'd shock you . 
  i did n't know this was a thing though , i do know about film quotas in cinemas around the eu though . 
  catalan nationalist showing their true colors . 
  ca n't not bet angry at everything can you ? 
  you watch too much game of thrones . 
  swimming to spain is probably the worse a terrorist can do and the least of anyone 's worries . 
  i can not agree more . 
  this is why i always have a hard time deciding whether or not study another culture and/or language . 
  must be really hard to dedicate a huge part of your life to something and then not being able to enjoy it . 
  sure , we can put another of your vernon 's in the galleon and set it on fire for old time 's sake . 
  silly yuropians always trying to drag spain in . 
  while ya 'll practice your longbow i 'll go practice my paella and my notgiveafuckism . 
  sounds very silly . 
  i disagree , no man rules alone , specially not a president . 
  germoney do it for harambe !, 
  they 'll leave if they do n't get to germany or sweden https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5cl656/disappointed_refugees_relocated_by_eu_have_left/, 
  we need to build a wall !,

  looks like a normal sized san jacobo to me . 
  britain , stop trying to ruin spanish cuisine . 
  we get it , you like , but please stahp . 
  pretty much . 
  my only complain is they could have put a tortilla de patatas or a paella in the table too . 
  or some tapas , man , that 's a lazy way to do stereotypes . 
  breaking news : politics !, 
  without military bases all over the world and allies sharing information military power gets neutered . 
  but i like muh toblerone !, 
  `` not like sweden or germany , it became obvious we do not want to stay . '', 
  talk about entitlement issues . 
  it 's not like back in their country people are killing each other in the streets anyway !, 
  they might want to go to the uk where they can just talk shit about the eu and have tea with smug faces together . 
  do n't worry , you can build a wall around yourself . 
  here 's some respect for you . 
  like this guy raging at a democratic institution ? 
  yeah , his profession is to be an angry teenager venting on the world . 
   it 's super effective !, 
   media fainted . 
   420 $ received . 
  you mean t&c are not enforceable ? 
  how about they rip up politicspeak/legalese in legal documents as well ? 
  both are responsible . 
  all histrionic yuropkin report in !, 
  maybe if they had n't been doing the same shit , but on a massive level with their own tv , and with all spaniards ( except themselves of course ) . 
  or maybe if the same retards that mass downvote me were n't the same that are quick to call me a fucking blaver or similar xenophobic bullshit , then i may have agreed with you .
