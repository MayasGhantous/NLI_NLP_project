  i say it is a dystopian present . 
  only 15k ? 
  if by `` airforce of the fascist troops of franco '' you mean germany , then yes . 
  let the echo-butthurt flow though . 
  the obsession is real though . 
  tfw politics is about avoiding people to get to power instead of getting people with constructive political programs to power . 
  coming from a catalan nationalist that 's oh-so-fucking-sweet . 
   get a regional flag as flair . 
   insult others for picking a regional flag as flair . 
  and they call me xenophobic . 
  talking about definitions , you 're a book case of retardation and semantics argumentation . 
  say , if i kill your family and then i do n't say they 're dead it 's all good , right ? 
  in fact , why not kill them and argue over what does it mean to be dead anyway ? 
  surely that would be productive !, 
  no , instead they are ruled ` by under ' [ social , de facto apartheid . 
  ] ( https://digital.library.villanova.edu/item/vudl:180065#?c=0&amp;m=0&amp;s=0&amp;cv=0 ), 
  [ i suppose you do n't think shooting political opponents in the back of the head is killing . 
  but reality would disagree . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miguel_%c3%81ngel_blanco ), 
  except they used basques as target practices for training their ` freedom fighters ' to kill people . 
  so ... they want to give freedom by killing their own people ? 
  i 'd personally like to see a report on eta 's ceasefire and disarmament declarations and the result of each . 
  that would be insightful . 
  merkel in that picture : `` my liberalism is this yuuuuuge !, 
  that title is cringy as fuck . 
  i 'm sure they 'll form a coalition , but that 's beyond the point . 
  before coalition vvd is already the biggest influence , pvv will be second unless more coaliations surprass him . 
  except gal realized it did n't work and stopped while eta kept going . 
  got ya there pickle . 
  next time pick politics over terrorism . 
   how many lives could have been saved if it was n't for the `` we do n't negotiate with terrorist '' stance, 
  is n't wilders ' party second on influence in the dutch parliament now ? 
  yes , several times , even last time they had international overseers and they still kept gathering weapons . 
  that was in 2011 i think , but they kept operating , they did n't kill but kept amassing weapons . 
  tried sure and old basque tactic : 1 . 
  declare disarmament 2 . 
  gather weapons in secret , if you get caught say you 're being tortured or repressed or some bullshit 3 . 
  kill people again 4 . 
  get arrested 5 . 
  go to 1 . 
  so if i grab a gun and kill somebody , it 's the government 's fault they 're not keeping me happy enough not to kill people ? 
  if they 're full then there 's noone to benefit . 
  yeah , send more people to the unemployment queues . 
  this is not a dichotomy : technology or tourism . 
  there 's nearly 20 % people unemployed , you 're not going to solve that closing businesses . 
  fucking up one industry does n't make one magically pop up , idiot . 
  for instance , when your beloved castros stumped the sugar industry in cuba to try to turn cuba into a ` technology and siderurgy superpower ' they fucked up big time to the point where their people are starving . 
  norway 's is older . 
  taxing bnb and allowing hotels would be best imo . 
  wealthy tourists , mid-income tourists and families get their hotels , while poor folk or such get their bnb . 
  spot on !, 
  make the emperor great again !, 
  [ they also fucked airbnb ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2016/11/clampdown-catalonia ) .

  ** paywalled ** the phoney war between home-sharing websites and barcelona seems to have come to an end . 
  after months of sparring between the parties , this week barcelona levied fines of $ 600,000 ( $ 636,000 ) each on airbnb and homeaway , which it says have been offering to rent properties that do not have a tourist licence to holidaymakers . 
  the firms had already been fined a nominal amount last year . 
  homeaway says it will pay the fine ; airbnb is appealing . 
  airbnb says that it is `` part of the solution '' in barcelona . 
  that depends on which problem it thinks it is addressing . 
  barcelona is a cramped town . 
  the number of visitors to the city has more than doubled since the start of the decade , from 3.1 m in 2000 to 7.8 m in 2014 . 
  that is close to five tourists for every inhabitant . 
  tourist accommodation is scarce . 
  the average hotel occupancy rate in barcelona is 78 % , the highest of any of spain 's main towns . 
  hotels ' revenue per room , too , is higher than in other cities . 
  all of which suggests a strong demand for alternative accommodation providers like airbnb . 
  yet , ada colau , the mayor , has long promised to crack down on such rentals . 
  some of her arguments will be familiar to residents of other cities , from new york to berlin , which are also trying to rein in airbnb . 
  when businesspeople buy swathes of property in an area with the sole intention of renting it to tourists , locals are forced out . 
  what is more the holidaymakers who set up camp in residential blocks can be anti-social neighbours , particularly in famed party towns such as barcelona . 
  but some issues are more personal to the catalan capital . 
  as tourists swamp the narrow streets around las ramblas and crowd ten deep around gaud\u00ed architecture , ms colau worries that the city is becoming little more than a theme park , in the mould of venice . 
  that can be self-defeating . 
  the more popular somewhere is , the less appealing it gets . 
  ( we might call that the yogi berra paradox . 
  arguing that his favourite st louis restaurant had become too popular , the baseball coach famously lamented : `` nobody goes there anymore , it 's too crowded . '' ) the problem for barcelona is thus not increasing the supply of rooms to accommodate the number of visitors , but controlling demand . 
  gulliver has suggested in the past that one way to do this might be to curtail the number of cruise-liners that dock in the city . 
  when towns such as barcelona are in danger of becoming victims of their own success , the best place to start is deciding which kind of tourists to keep . 
  both barcelona and venice are firmly on the cruise-ship circuit ; perhaps a third of the visitors to the catalan capital arrive on a large boat . 
  for some cities , no doubt , they are an invaluable source of income . 
  but for those perched at the brink of being overwhelmed , they seem like a good place to start the control . 
  they are less valuable than other visitors because they do n't stay in hotels , and very often do n't even eat in restaurants . 
  what is more , the vibe they give to a town is somewhat frantic . 
  they , after all , arrive en masse with only a few hours to hoover up all the culture , architecture and shopping they can before moving on to the next stop on the itinerary . 
  perhaps it is time to initiate cruise control . 
  but as airbnb and its ilk have become more popular , so they have become another obvious target in towns like barcelona . 
  very few are arguing for a complete ban on holiday rentals in residential neighbourhoods . 
  fewer still have a problem with those who rent out the spare room in their house . 
  it does seem reasonable , however , to regulate the supply of such properties in order to ensure that cities do not tip tourism success into failure .

  windshields do n't count !, 
  tried dow 1 , was pretty meh imo = / . 
  then again , played it in 2016 and was a 12 year old game , may try dow 2 at some point . 
  they looked way smaller from outside . 
  valencians already do that , thanks, 
  war40k always seemed to me that was underused in videogames , or at least used pretty poorly . 
  is it me or the igloos are way separated ?
