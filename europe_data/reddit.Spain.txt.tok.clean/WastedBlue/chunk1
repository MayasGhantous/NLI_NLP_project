strong repression of catalan language and culture during the national-catholicist dictatorship of franco ; not having a separate tax system ( as they do in the barque country or navarra ) , which has infuriated catalans even more since the crisis started ( about 9 % of catalonia 's gpd is given to other regions , although its not so bad since my home , the balearic islands , give away awound 40 % of its gdp ... ) ; there are strong associations between spain 's national symbols and fascism ; the current government has responded very beligerantly against catalonia 's proposal of changing spain 's political organization from the autonomus comunities of now to a federation ( to have control of their taxes ) . 
  this is more or less it in a very simplified way . 
  edit : i almost forgot about the rampant corruption and , in many cases , impunity , that is inside of the government right-wing party , the pp , which is also a party of mediocres that came to power basically because socialists were to blame for the crisis ( although the real estate bubble that exploded with us 's crisis in 2008 was originated from the private debt expansion based growth policies that were implemented by the pp in the early 2000 's . 
  do n't bother , people are intoxicated with hatred . 
  life must be so hard to you , right ? 
  suicide please , make me happy . 
  so your point is basically nothing . 
  void of any content . 
  those `` lefties '' that dominate the world ? 
  those ones ? 
  actually that 's what you said . 
  you explicitly said that knowledge is of no use when solving complex problems , and thus , educated people are not better than the average retard when chosing our political system ( with economy being just a subsystem of it ) . 
  your argument is basically that communists do n't do research and that they are arrogant smart-asses . 
  and how can you tell that all the avaiable knowledge of philosophy , history and economics is not enough since none actually posseses it and still those three subjects are not technically knowldege either ? 
  the fact that you were upvoted saying that nonsense and i was downvoted for saying what i said just shows how retarded ( and hateful ) the average moderate is . 
  i swear i 'm generally not arrogant but this sub is ** so ** full of stupid people strengthening their own bullshit opinion and clapping at the shit they spit . 
  tl ; dr : education is useless . 
  the top comment rallies against `` cultural marxists '' too . 
  so cringy, 
  i disagree . 
  most communists and anarchists in my university ( at least ) are very cultivated people . 
  moderates are , most of the time , people with very little knowledge of history , economics , and philosophy . 
  welcome to the machine !, 
  maybe you should not be a racist shit . 
  explain the `` current arabic hygiene '' . 
  this comment combines so much ignorance , racism and plain mental retardation that i have no choice other than insulting you . 
  do you know anything about arabia beyond * arab = terrorist * ? 
  i 'm convinced you do n't even know what countries are in there , or else you would n't have said that . 
  this comment applies to the retarded briton above , too . 
  why is it ironic ? 
  then either you have a really bad memory or some other issue runs in your mind . 
  how can you say you are proud of your government after the handling of the ukraine crisis , the ttip or the current dependance of the nato for the eu 's defense ? 
  germany is an american pawn , as the rest of europe . 
  but of course that will hurt your feelings and you will dismiss any facts for it . 
  all wars were of geopolitic nature since nation-states arose . 
  any other excuse is bullshit . 
  how do you know its better if it has never been tried before ? 
  some things should change , mainly our mass media culture and our desdain for politics , but it 's not impossible . 
  if you do n't limit your deficit your debt keeps growing and growing but there is no limit for that . 
  i 'm not saying i support this kind of economy and its * hu\u00eddas hacia adelante * , which is an spanish expression meaning roughly `` fleeing forward '' but that thing about there only being one choice being it austerity is just not true . 
  ** remember my words **, 
  the reason is that modern states and parlamentary democracies were burgeoise councils created by economical elites to gain political power and perpetuate themselves . 
  the system has adapted to include some modest social-driven changes but works essentially the same as shown in the american , european or russian plutocracy . 
  and aristotles , solon and many other greek philosophers were in for true democracy . 
  plato is just more famous because christianity took its idea 's theory as the basis for its intelectual development . 
  necessary ? 
  how is it necessary to implement further depressive policies shown not to work as expected ? 
  your news are idiotic . 
  stop `` informing yourself '' through them , its not working . 
  fuck yeah , fuck the private banking systems , fuck fincial speculation and the casino stock market . 
  if you were the opposite of british ... what would you be ? 
  please tell me you are voting podemos and not vox or anything like that . 
  except that austerity was a * requirement * for the credit programs . 
  rajoy is just a pathetic asslicking dog trying to feel like he is another european leader by following the others of others . 
  pathetic clown he is . 
  actually greece applied all economic policies that they were asked to , which ruined the economy completely making it impossible to pay all debt back . 
  greece is not a rebel thief , it has actually been the predilect alumn of germany and supranational organizations . 
  greece 's previous government fully obliged to ** all ** the demands of the eu . 
  you are manipulated as fuck . 
  and who forms the public opinion of the masses ? 
  the mass media . 
  who dislikes the greek government the most ? 
  multinational corporations , banks and right-wing parties . 
  people are manipulated to hate and blame the greeks without knowing a small fraction of the full history of the current problem . 
  are you kidding me ? 
  the germans are basically saying * we do n't like your government , put another puppet in place or else we will fuck you up * . 
  how is that in line with european democracy ? 
  why do you approve this ? 
  so now saying that the mass media , which is basically a corporative sector , works benefiting corporations is being a conspiracist ? 
  edit : is not in, 
  yeah , i 'm all for ending tax heavens and tax the rich high enough so that monstruous amounts of wealth wo n't be accumulated while the working classes suffer . 
  still , low class labouring in the underseen ( do n't know the proper term ) market represents , at least in spain , a quite high percentage of the population , probably around 2-5 % of the working force , which is no joke when it comes to tax revenues . 
  stupid spaniards are stupid . 
  probably submerged economy , otherwise it would be very hard for the population to thrive forward . 
  in spain its similar , while we have around 25 % unemployement many people find a black job here and there to get some cash . 
  the problem is that those jobs are very underpaid , do n't contribute to society with taxes and have no job security at all . 
  you probably just joked but idk, 
  do n't waste your time . 
  victim blaming is alright when we talk about low class workers . 
  the us is the global hegemonic power , the eu factually does n't mean shit in the league of world powers and acts as basically a satellite for the us in foreign affairs , independently of how grandious your numbers sound . 
  you are delusional . 
  its not about the population , its about european politians at all levels accepting progressive submission of its sovereignty to the usa . 
  in the 2000s the neoliberals in power implemented a real state ownership policy similar to us 's one ... except it was much bigger here . 
  it had nothing to do with currency . 
  i challange you to find a native french who does that . 
  what if i salute caesar, 
  i 'll admit that i do n't know much about early settling of north america but i still hold on to my point of cultural diversity being an obstacle to a completely unified united european states . 
  even i 'm against that , i 'm afraid that it would create more tensions and problems than it would resolve . 
  the us has a pretty homogenic society . 
  here i do n't even know how many languages are spoken within the eu . 
  ttip is just the beginning . 
  at these pace europe will become no more than another american state with its crazy political and economical panorama . 
  edit : ** remember this comment twenty years in the future and prove me wrong **, 
  after your previous comments i honestly did n't even bother to read your response . 
  do n't make me lose more time . 
  do whatever you want dude . 
  capitalism is the supreme system surely as it has been shown throughout history , money is your god and so on . 
  go learn some xix-xx history , you should do so for the best of all of us . 
  wow that huge authority completely validates your nonsense . 
  ohh i understand now it 's all a consecuence of those damn left governments .
