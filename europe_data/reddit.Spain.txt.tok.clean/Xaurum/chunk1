as pointed out before , spain 's gdp per capita is wrong . 
  it 's really  36.000 $ so they ploted well the color but not the numbers . 
   therefore one could argue that the past government was decent . 
  or that we had already touched bottom . 
  do n't underestimate their heatred towards spain .

  do n't get why you 're being downvoted . 
  catalan has more speakers than most of the languages presented in the posted video , so i 'd say it 's quite important too . 
  they could just have posted the [ 38 languages version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_488511591&amp;feature=iv&amp;src_vid=-y3kzibhn8o&amp;v=dgk40ykaltw ) . 
  dear reddit , as a valencian i can not support this image because paella has no seafood . 
  you simply ca n't completely change a recipe and keep using the same name for it . 
  i wrote a small explanation about why we should n't use the word `` paella '' for any dish made out of rice a few weaks ago , so i 'll just post a link to the comment so that all of you can see what a [ real paella ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lnbo1aiz4ek/uuv9feftv_i/aaaaaaaapde/0yqwzan8hyq/s1600/dscf1503.jpg ) is : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/56g3z0/jamie_olivers_paella_brings_fractured_spain/d8j92vj/, 
   would probably make a guy from valencia mad as hell . 
  can confirm . 
  i felt my blood boil just by looking at the photo . 
  spain is the new texas . 
  but in this case , the [ eagle ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ctqadbccv98/veibffrvi8i/aaaaaaaakza/j5omjpqfkmw/s1600/banderfranquista.png ) represents exactly the opposite of freedom . 
  they repeatedly said that they would ** never ** allow a pp government during the election campaign . 
  so yes , this is a big democratic sham . 
   to the point that spanish-cruisine restaurants have learned to include mexican cuisine because that 's what americans think of when they think `` spanish culture '' oh god , i do n't even want to know what do you do to the paella :(, 
  sure , let 's open the debate about how the spanish media has turned a fight at 5:00 am between drunk people ( even if it started by political reasons ) into a `` persecution '' against the guardia civil in navarre , [ ignoring the testimony of neighbors ] ( http://www.naiz.eus/eu/actualidad/noticia/20161015/ospa-mugimendua-niega-la-version-de-la-guardia-civil-y-denuncia-su-actitud-provocativa-en-altsasu ) of that village that stated otherwise . 
  or how the own city council ( with the support of the spanish [ socialist party ] ( https://twitter.com/ahotsainfo/status/788122457379106816 ) ) has stated that the presence of more police and guarcia civil makes convivence more difficult as i stated on my first comment . 
  not only that , but the in the basque country and navarre the ratio is about 700 per 100.000 , i imagine because eta existed a few years ago . 
  the thing is , when you put too much police control over the population , [ tension arises ] ( http://spanishnewstoday.com/two-guardia-civil-officers-attacked-in-navarra_81251-a.html ) . 
  maybe it 's about time we open a new debate about how many police do we really need . 
  valencian independentist mostly , though i would n't mind a federation if it ever happened . 
  but to be honest , just supposing an independent valencia would be a huge `` if '' . 
  there are many kinds of spiders of the genus loxosceles around the world . 
  the one typical from the mediterranean basin is * loxosceles rufescens * which venom is not nearly as dangerous as the one of its american cousins * loxosceles reclusa * and * loxosceles laeta * . 
   i hope spain remains united though . 
  duuuuude , we trusted you :(, 
  paella was born in the counties of la ribera and l'horta near valencia . 
  alicante is  100km away from that ( plus that guy said his family from the vorder with murcia , where they are mpre culturally bound to murcia so that might explain why ) . 
  if it 's from outside valencia , it probably does . 
  here in valencia we have `` arros a banda '' that is somehow similar to paella ... 
  but still , not paella . 
  in many places when an ousiders ask for a `` paella with seafood '' they just give them an arros a banda , probably because it 's much easier than trying to explain them all this mess . 
  ok , as a valencian i think i need to explain a few things to put this into context . 
  as many of you might already know , paella was created in the region near valencia a few centuries ago , and it has ever since been associated with valencian culture . 
  valencia has historically been a rice-producer region , something that also came to be part of our culture . 
  here we have dozens of dishes made out of rice , including the most obvios one , paella , as well as other less known like [ arr\u00f2s a banda ] ( http://nosoytonto.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/receta-arroa-a-banda-de-calamar-1.jpg ) , [ arr\u00f2s cald\u00f3s ] ( https://bahira1.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/arros-caldos-amb-penques-2.jpg ) or [ arr\u00f2s al forn ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3344/3615559095_f3b6d91e6b.jpg ) . 
  as some of you might have realized , every other dish made out of rice here in valencia recieves the name `` arr\u00f2s + x '' , which literally translates to `` rice + x '' . 
  with paella , however , this is different . 
  the reason we call it `` paella '' without using the word `` rice '' before is because , unlike other types of rice , paella follows a very especific set of ingredients that include vegetables , chicken and rabbit ( link of the video bellow ) , but never seafood . 
  that 's why we get so angry whenever someone , many spanish putside valencia included , uses the name paella for anything made out rice . 
  we have many other dishes made out of rice too , we just do n't call that `` paella '' becouse paella is another thing !, 
  sure , you could maybe change/add one or two ingredients of the original ( but never more than that ) and call it paella too , but the point is it should always ** keep its essence ** , and a paella with seafood and chorizo simply destroys its original flavour and texture . 
  the funny thing is , the own [ jamie oliver 's youtube channel ] ( https://youtu.be/l_dduw_qudu ) posted a video following the true paella recipe , but it seems he just forgot about it . 
  so please , just try not using the word `` paella '' for anything that has rice on it . 
  paella is one of our most beloved national symbols , and it hurts to see what it has become outside our region . 
  i posted this same thing a few days ago ( [ same tittle , same page ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/55u2yf/jamie_olivers_paella_brings_fractured_spain/ ) ) and just got bad karma with it . 
  now this post gets over 100 points . 
  sometimes i feel reddit is broken :(, 
  i could argue against many of the things you say , but i rather not do it now . 
  the point is , maybe we should focus on what 's wrong with r/europe instead of turning this into a debate about catalan independence : /, 
  wtf man ? 
  they even state on the preamble how they were already a nation back in 1980 . 
  even if they finally won in the use of the word `` nation '' in the preamble , that was one of the main reasons why the pp was against it . 
  as i was telling , they did n't say a thing when the andalusian estatuto came out ( even when , by that time , there was no legal resolution yet for the catalan estatut ) . 
  that 's why i was telling how the pp has always shown a will to go againts what is decided in catalonia , even if they have to ignore other parts of spain that do the same . 
  somewhat true , but i 'll try to explain why : back in 2006 , when the catalan reformed for their `` estatut '' ( some king regional constitution-like ) , they included a point where they said that `` catalonia was a ** nation ** '' . 
  not that it was another state different from the spanish or anything like that , but just that they were a nation ( which is correct by [ definition ] ( http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/nation ) ) . 
  no need to say that the right-wing , spanish nationalis , pp party of spain ( the same that is ruling nowadays ) did n't like the inclusion of the word `` nation '' . 
  and so began a series of judicial battles against the catalan government in order to take down that specific part plus a few other points . 
  the thing is , a few months later , the government of andalusia ( plus a few other that ended up doing the same ) changed their estatuto to include , among other things , the concept that they too , were a nation . 
  however , in this chance the pp did n't even bother to ask them to change it . 
  why ? 
  probably because nationalism is much much stronger in catalonia than in andalusia . 
  now we arrive to this situation , where the catalan government , that banned bulls a few years ago , is being legaly forced to undo the ban after they lost a judicial battle that pp started . 
  while in the canary island , where bullfighting has been banned for over 25 , that was never a problem . 
  so yes , kind of a `` fuck you for being catalan '' . 
  so they expected greeks to lead europe 's economy ? 
  [ relaxing cup of caf\u00e9 con leche ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wimvjfawuas ) . 
  btw , that was the former mayor of madrid . 
  i just tried to clarify , because : 1 ) there is no blue senyera on the reddit flag selection ( although i rather keep using the `` plain '' senyera in any case ) , so many people tend to confuse . 
  2 ) we valencians are not having a referendum any time soon even if i wish :p, 
  just to clarify , i 'm valencian , not catalan ( although our respective flags are almost identical ) . 
  say hi to 4 more years with a government of pp . 
  my body does n't feel ready for that :(, 
  are you making fun of how i name my region ? 
  seriously you , an outsider to my land , are telling me how to name it ? 
  just so you know it , `` valencian country '' is a [ historic and cultural ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/names_of_the_valencian_community ) name that is still on use . 
  using the constitution as an argument against independence is quite bs , since laws can be changed if there is a will for that . 
  it makes even less sense if we take into account that in 2011 , pp and psoe changed the article 135 of the spanish constitution to incorporate a `` limit of debt '' in just a few days , without even letting people decide if they wanted to accept that on a referendum . 
  so yeah , the problem is not law by itself , but rather that the main spanish political parties seem to do not like referendums of any kind . 
  i do n't think it was so strong before that . 
  during the 60s , when the biggest immigration wave from spain occurred , the population of catalonia grew from [ 3.9 m to 5.1 m ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/demografia_de_catalunya ) people . 
  that 's an increase of 30 % of their total population in a period of just 10 years . 
  now , considering that most of those people had no relation with catalan culture and that they spoke just spanish , plus the effects of a fascist regime that had prohibited by law the use of catalan or any sign of popular catalan culture . 
  it 's almost a miracle that catalan survived so relatively well to that situation . 
  as i said , with this data i find the etnicity-blood argument a bit weak to explain the actual catalan national movement unless you consider that most people were not originally catalans but ended up `` converting '' to it . 
   really ? 
  can you find a source for that ? 
  most sources i can find list them as an ethnic group . 
  i know what he says might sound a bit strange , but there he is right . 
  the reason for that is mostly due to the huge immigration flux of people from other parts of spain that arrived catalonia in the 60s looking for a better job . 
  the thing is , contrary to what many people would think , after just one generation most migrants had assimilated the native catalan culture and language ( and sometimes even the very people that had arrived in the first place ) . 
  that has created a situation where the `` etnicity '' of a region is no longer driven by blood bonds , but by its cultural heritage . 
  the north atlantic current arribes to the west of he british islands ( as you can see in the footage ) and then it splits into smaller currents going both [ north and south ] ( https://media1.britannica.com/eb-media/24/149024-004-b14614aa.jpg ) .
