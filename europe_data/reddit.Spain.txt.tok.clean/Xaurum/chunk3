  if they do one this time , it should be a total referendum with the word of the catalan government to act according to the results as if it was legally binding . 
  sure , the spanish government would try to ban it , and at that point they would have to ignore any legal threat and try keep up . 
  whether that might end up well or bad , i honestly do n't know . 
  brexit is to direct democracy what trump is to indirect democracy . 
   i mean they still claimed the biggest problem was spain stealing money no , they do n't , or at least they are not the only autonomous comunity that blames the central government for underfunding . 
  the pro-independence movement is far more than that , and your answer is just perpetuating a short sighted vision of the whole problem . 
  do you seriously think about half the population of catalonia - many of those born in other parts of spain - would be so easily fooled to turn into in independence if that were the case ? 
  historically , catalonia has always been one of the regions of spain that wanted more autonomy . 
  they were one of the firsts to ask for decentralization when the actual spanish democracy came to be , and have always had an important national identity . 
  but up until recently , the pro independence movement was minoritary even there ( ~ 15-20 % of population ) . 
  so what did change ? 
  well , the first actual problem came in 2006 with the creation of the new statute of autonomy of catalonia ( a regional-like constitution that every autonomous comunity in spain has ) . 
  there , the catalan courts passed a draft of the new statute of autonomy that was later voted in favour by the catalan people . 
  but the new statute itself had a few aspects that most of the right-wind and spanish-nationalists did not like at all , mainly one that stated that `` catalonia is a nation '' . 
  not that if was a nation different of spain or anything like that , but rather that it was a nation * within * spain . 
  after that there was a campaing all over spain with the pp , actual right-wind governing party of the country , asking for signatures to force the then socialist government to abolish the catalan statute . 
  since the own socialist party was one of those that voted in favour of the 2006 statute they dismissed their petitions , and then the pp appealed the spanish constitutional court ( whose members are decided by the main spanish political parties ... yeah ) , which later decided to abolish the catalan statute . 
  this itself created an initial tension between spain and catalonia , but it did n't end up there . 
  after a few months , that same statement of * being a nation * appeared on the autonomy statute of andalucia , but that time no one raised their voice . 
  this sent an important message to the people of catalonia , the message that the spanish society was acting against them , something they had always thoght a bit ( even using catalan as the main language in catalan schools is seen as an attack by spanish right-wing ) . 
  after that , the tension slowly raised between spain and catalonia . 
  calls for more autonomy , fiscal self-management ( as some parts of spain already have ) and , yes , also the idea of underfunding came as some of the questions that needed to be adressed ... but never got a decent answer by the spanish government . 
  and this is a just short history about how this came out to be . 
  so no , it 's not just because they think that `` spain is stealing money '' bulls *** . 
  an unilateral referendum would certainly be a problem when it comes to recognition , but the spanish government would n't allow a legal referendum to take place even if there every single catalan wanted independence . 
  my guess is that if the catalan government creates an unilateral referendum and the pro-independence option wins ( supposing they can convince enough people to go to vote ) , they would use those results to show to the world that catalans do not want to be spanish anymore , and just wait until international pressure builds up ( if it does ) against the spanish government to allow a * new * but legal referendum . 
  they are not so silly to declare unitalteral indepence , they are just playing the limited cards they have in hand . 
   he could be replaced by an algorithm , not specially fancy . 
  for ( int i = 0 ; government = = false & & i < 3 ; i + + ) { government = ask_form_government ( ) } now , pay me 24.000 $ month + expenses . 
  to be fair , el cid fought many times with moors on his side , [ sometimes even allying with moorish kings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/el_cid#moorish_service ) to fight christian and other moor kindoms . 
  in fact , the term `` cid '' comes from the arab '' \u0633\u064a\u062f - s\u012bdi '' , which could be translated as `` the master '' . 
  he was just a mercenary , but many centuries after his death the castilian-spanish nationalism reinvented his historical figure to create a * national hero * as a way to justify their superiority to other kindoms . 
  i wanted to know , when the west germany ( frg ) and east germany ( gdr ) fused , the germany that first joined the eu ceased to exist and became a new entity . 
  did they have any legal problems to do that ? 
  because this case looks very similar but in opossed directions . 
  technically , when a country secedes from another , the other country is n't the original either . 
  just keeping the name does n't mean that the country is the same at all . 
  so 60 % of those who voted it are dead ? 
  that accounts for most then . 
  there are many problems with that : * after franco 's dictatorship , the 1978 spanish constitution was seen as the ** only ** way to go for a democracy and avoid a new dictatorship . 
  it was n't exactly something people could think much about . 
  * that was almost 40 years ago , people that voted is now at least 56 years old ( 18 +38 ) . 
  most people that voted are dead by now , and we find ourselves on a situation where most people in spain have n't even voted for their constitution to decide if they wanted another one . 
  besides , if we had to keep using laws from 1978 we coul n't even divorce !, 
  law 's are meant to be changed if there is a will for it . 
  they would probably not secede at the moment if they win , but rather use it to show the will of their people and try to push the spanish government to do something . 
  as for today , spain has n't done anything to ease the tension in catalonia , which is just madness . 
  i agree with you in that asking for more than 50 % to win a referendum helps defending the status quo , and somehow blocking any idea that goes against it . 
  the problem here lies in the fact that if they get a 51 % -49 % situation and they wo n't secede they would be acting against the will of their people , and that situation would be much more unstable . 
  asking for more than 50 % to change something might be ok if it 's been a short time since you decided about it , but catalonia got their actual status in spain about 40 years ago . 
  i think they 've had plenty of time to understand their problem . 
  i do n't believe in actively defending the status quo , but rather keeping a * cooldown period * for a few years where more than 50 % is asked to change it and give people time to understant where the problem lies . 
  but after a few years have past , 50 % is ok . 
  nah , it 's just stupid . 
  yeah , was thinking about that before , but the problem i see is a bit more psicological than merely political . 
  remember the whole mess with the catalan `` estatut '' ? 
  many autonomous comunities objected saying they `` were n't going to have any less than catalonia '' ( here in valencia even the pp stood that way ) . 
  the trouble comes because everyone wants what the neighbour has just because they do n't want to feel lesser than the others , even if that degree of autonomy is of no use for them . 
  and if they do n't use their autonomy , many people in those regions will see it as something useless aaaaand ... back to this situation again . 
  but this is my humble opinion , maybe someone can convince people from extremadura that they need less autonomy than catalonia , then i 'll eat my hat . 
  just with the results of the lasts elections , i 'd say i mostly can . 
  here in valencia , we have two distinct regions , one with linguistic castilian dominance and another with valencian ( or catalan ) one . 
  try guessing [ which is which ] ( http://imgur.com/zglttud ) . 
   them paying their fair share to poorer regions is seen as repression valencian here . 
  we are one of the poorer regions and yet we pay ** more ** than the average ( yay ! ) . 
  can i finally say we are being repressed ? 
   spain was a centralized country so autonomy was given to appease the nationalists : more of them became secessionists . 
  there is a term in spanish politics to account for the situation that led to : '' \u00a1 caf\u00e9 para todos ! '', 
  ( or `` coffee for everyone ! '' ) . 
  during the first phases of the modern spanish democracy , a few territories showed nationalist movements asking for more rights and autonomy . 
  to ease thas situation , the spanish courts decided that it was necessary to allow more autonomy to different regions . 
  this created a situation where * the same * autonomy was given to nationalist territories that were explicitly asking for it , and to those that never even asked . 
  doing so , they could give less autonomy to the nationalist regions ( that had been asking for even * more * autonomy that it was finally given ) by giving it to everyone so that , in general , it looked like the central state was giving a lot of freedom to the regions . 
  at this point , the fact that everyone had the same degree of freedom meant that no one could negociate for their explicit needs , but just had to agree on a common regulation . 
  to exemplify why this is a problem , imagine a region with an important sea-trade market that wants to increase their autonomy in port management ( btw , this is an actual problem ) . 
  if they are the only ones asking for it , the central government wo n't even sit to negociate a new model , as it would require to change everyone else 's laws . 
  in the end , when everyone is given the same freedom , no one is . 
  and the worst part is that those so called `` federalists '' are n't even keeping this idea in mind . 
  most of them ( specially the socialist party ) just want to go for a `` autonomy + + '' model that would lead to the exact same situation . 
  this is why i think a federal spain wo n't be the solution , and why i think catalonia would do better being independent . 
  yeah , i would n't pay more than 16 camels . 
  if we are going to play that game , sub-saharian africans own this world . 
   the terrible conditions france kept these refugees ( about half a million ) i 'm starting to see a pattern in european history . 
   i do think chances are that spain wo n't veto either they probably wo n't veto , but that does n't mean they 'll let it go just like that . 
  my guess is that they 'll try to push as hard as they can to delay the scotish re-join to the eu , like they did a few weeks ago being the firsts on oposing any kind of eu-scotland talks until they got their independence . 
   scotland is a separate country and the uk is a union where you are allowed to leave ( similar to the eu ) , catalonia is an actual part of spain and , as far as i am aware , not a separate country . 
  you are right . 
  scotland is part of a union they can legally leave if they want , and catalonia is an autonomous region of spain that has no current legal option to leave other than change the spanish 's constitution . 
  however , putting an independent scotland on the map would surely have an important effect in favour of catalan pro-secession movement that would complicate things even more for spain . 
  so yeah , expect the spanish government to slow things down quite a bit . 
   but if we 're to become another autonomous region of spain with our culture slowly being replaced with the castilian one being from a non-castilian region , i can warantee you that 's what will happen . 
  enjoy your process of castilianization . 
   spain opposed negotiations with scotland only because they are not yet independent so they do n't have the authority . 
  that 's the official excuse , but the fact that spain was the first country to point that out clearly means they do n't like it . 
  if they really had nothing against an independent scotland there would be no reason not to start an informal talking before ( if ) they get their independence in order to help scotland rejoin the eu as fast as possible . 
  that would be the least painful for both sides . 
  just curious , do you know if there was much debate there about banning bullfighting ? 
  because when catalans did it , a lot of people jumped to stop them , and the same is happening now on many other cities too . 
   by listening to those who have made this demand you are giving credit to those who promote tearing apart a nation , money extortioner and supporter of movment that have put explosives upon house of common citizens . 
  ah yes , have also opened fire upon houses of law enforcement officiers and killed a high ranking representant of the state .
