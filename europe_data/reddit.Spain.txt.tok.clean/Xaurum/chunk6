  let 's never forget that . 
   by the way i think our secessionists ( at least the catalan ones ) are idiots saying about half the population of catalonia are idiots . 
  i do n't think that 's precisely a wise statement ... 
  supermajority means you are playing in favor of status quo . 
  ** who decides how much more than 50 % is needed ? 
  ** * can i ask if for  55 % then ? 
  * ** what kind of questions are suitable for supermajority and which should n't ? 
  ** * can i ask for supermajority just in the themes where i do n't want things to change ? 
  * and many more situations like that one . 
  after so many decades being in part of an european organisation , do n't you think the brits have already discussed it more than enough to let them vote ? 
  supermajority ** is a danger ** and no one should back it up . 
   this is the kind of politicians within europe that i want . 
  before that , you might like to know that his party is the most corrupt party the spanish democracy has ever seen , and there are even declarations of him defending corrupt politicians being investigated by the justice . 
  beware of those who come to you with kind words , they might hide something . 
  but there is still a huge difference between a fast and a slow rejoin to the eu . 
  and spain , despite not being able to opose it , might want to push for the slow one just to piss off . 
  `` filled '' i 'd like to have access to the stimations by the police vs organizers , or at least a few more images before . 
  not wanting to change a law to try to solve a problem that can only be solved democratically . 
  beacouse how else could the problem with catalonia be fixed ? 
  i do n't think thete is another way to do it , and yet they opose to do it . 
  at first i was wondering where did the spaniards get their carbohydrates , but being from valencia , i should know the answer is is probably * rice * . 
  edit : `` hydrocarbs '' changed to `` carbohydrates '' . 
  i 've seen many times fascists attacking meeting of people [ they did n't like ] ( https://youtu.be/zvt7jnoig8u ) . 
  do n't know if you ever heard about it , but being from valencia you should know they putted bombs during the 80 's / 90 's on buildings of leftist parties and personalities . 
  also , i never said * just * white males voted for trump . 
  please do n't put those words in my mouth . 
  but hey , keep distorting reality and calling people `` dumb '' that 's the way to go in life \\ s. 
  the same way fascist of white american males background voted for trump ? 
  beacouse they were being `` oppressed '' ? 
  i think your idea of the origin od fascism if far from certain . 
  i hope that 's sarcasm ... 
  the valencian government also wants to welcome refugees , but the central government refuses . 
  you lost your point . 
  actually , spain has quickly become one of the [ least religious ] ( https://m.magnet.xataka.com/en-diez-minutos/en-silencio-espana-se-ha-convertido-en-una-de-las-naciones-menos-religiosas-de-europa ) countries in the eu . 
  maybe religion does matter after all, 
   if letting catalonia go would worsen the lives of 45 million people then spain should perhaps concentrate their efforts more towards those than the 7.5 million people . 
  the same could be said about brexit , but we do n't . 
  why ? 
  beacouse the future of a group of people is decided by themselves . 
   the main reason catalonia wants to break apart is not cultural reasons but political ones , its that they 're more left leaning than the rest of spain and are annoyed their their 7.5 million votes do n't weigh more than the other tens of millions in the country who votes for something else and they ca n't implement the reforms they want as a result . 
  actually , the biggest party of catalonia up until a few years was ciu , a right-wing liberal party , and the proportion between left-right has been kept more or less similar to the rest of spain over time . 
  i do n't think you are correct about your considerations . 
  legality is n't the question here . 
  many laws can be changed if there is a will for it ( for example , that time pp and psoe changed the consititution all by themselves without asking the spanish people ) . 
  if if the spanish parties wanted to solve this problem democratically , they could as they did before . 
  the question here is , why are they holding against a referendum that would solve once and for all this question ? 
  they 're just creating more and more tension with their actions . 
  it 's not a proportional veto system in any way , one big country can veto a decision but many smaller ca n't . 
  why could n't the eu as a whole have the decission to veto but the us does ? 
  next week we 'll have another polar wave , if that works for you . 
  it 's obvious that some interested on independence would vote any kind of referendum they could ( in this case , a unilateral referendum ) , but the contrary is not true . 
  that 's why the numbers are so high in favour of independence in this case . 
  it 's basic statistics : 79 % of a 63 % turnout is 0.79 * 0.63 = 0.497 --  49.7 % of the total population would vote yes in case of unilateral referendum . 
  starting by uniting castile and aragon ... huehuehue, 
  looking at that , at which point did someone decide those were part of the same language ( italian ) ? 
  they seem different enough for me to be different languages : /, 
  i 'd vote you twice if i could just for using jupyter . 
  castille and aragon were separated kingdoms too by that time . 
  is the portuguese `` presunto '' the same as the spanish `` jamon '' or is there any kind of difference ? 
  also with the italian `` prosciutto '' . 
  our constitution also says everyone should have access to a house and job , so ... 
   which most catalans voted for 38 years ago , and not committing illegalities . 
  38 years ago we could n't divorce , nor do many of the things we see today as normal , i do n't think thats a good argument to follow . 
  plus , you talk about `` catalans '' as if all of them had voted it , when in fact most of the people who voted for it ( now they are at least 59 years ) have already died , and we find ourselves in a situacion where most of the spanish people have n't even had the chance to vote it . 
  could you explain me how is that a good thing ? 
  and even worse , you 're talking about a constitution that was the only available option to get rid of the spanish dictatorship . 
  it 's not as if exactly that they could ask for any big change . 
  we sometimes focus on sinple facts , but the background is what really defines reality . 
  very very complete and interesting information . 
  i wish more reports here were shown with that amount of detail . 
  thank you for sharing that information with us , it 's really helpful !, 
  i do . 
  there are no error bars . 
  with no error bars and nor info about how many people were interviewed , no data should be trusted . 
  they might have interviewed just a few random people , which might not be significative statistically . 
  i was going to comment a similar thing before , but did n't want to overextend . 
  the fact that there are not that many people earning the minimum wage ( accounting for the median , as you said in your other comment ) would probably be the best argument to raise it , since it would n't be too economically difficult and we would save those few people from their wage-induced poverty . 
  we 're talking about giving dignity to the deaths of the victims of a fascist regime by moving their corpses into regular tombs . 
  how is that supposed to be worse than the current situation , might i ask you ? 
  it might sound like a lot , but the minimum wage has been kept at about 660 $ ( about 560 $ net , same as greece i think ) during the years of the crisis . 
  compared to some of our [ closest european neighbours ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_minimum_wage?wprov=sfla1 ) , that 's less than half , or even a third , of what they earn . 
  so yeah , an 8 % increase of a shitty salary is still a shitty salary . 
  basically , that 's an aproximate guess of the number of victims of franco that `` disappeared '' during the spanish civil war and the later dictatorship . 
  you can find more info about it [ here ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/desaparecidos_del_franquismo ) ( sorry it 's just in spanish , you can use google translate if you need it ) . 
  both the un and the eu have tried to put pressure so that spain would stop being the only democracy in the world that has n't judged the state terrorism of a previous dictatorship , but still no luck . 
  considering over 140.000 victims of the francoism are still `` missing '' all over spain ( 2nd biggest number in the world after cambodia ) , i 'd say 40 years is a good reason to be even more angry . 
  and even nowadays , most of our political parties just say that it 's better `` not to reopen old wounds '' and let things be as they are . 
  i f *** ing despise the political class of my country . 
  good , it only took us 40 years . 
  i feel you , broh . 
  thankfully i moved to barcelona last week ... but i have no tv here yet . 
  my life is pain :(, 
  valencia itself is not that big , but it 's surrounded by lots of smaller cities that are connected ( or almost ) between them , creating a metropolitan network that extends for a few km . 
   but we 've been a centralised country for centuries hell , you even exported your model to spain when the bourbon monarchy came in . 
  we used to have our own rules and self-government before . 
  watching your culture slowly disappear due to centralisation is really sad :(, 
  we will build a shield and make the us pay for it . 
  1 ) we were talking about why some dialects of italian appear to be a bit more related to catalan than castilian , we are not talking about the relation between castilian and catalan at all . 
  plus , it 's a fact that distance ( or rather , lack of fast communication between different regions ) is a huge factor in the evolution of languages , so i do n't think talking about that is `` stupid '' at all . 
  2 ) this is the second raging comment you post against me today , saying that what my posts are `` stupid '' .
