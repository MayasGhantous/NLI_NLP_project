  `` you '' , `` your '' , `` you '' , `` yours '' , `` you '' . 
  man , i feel i wo n't having this stupid conversation if i had another flag . 
  you are trying to make people think that ftt is a piigs idea or something . 
  pathethic really . 
  ftt is not for collecting , wich in fact , failed to do so , as you could see in france . 
   why do the rest of the eu have to accept a tax to fix your problems ? 
  i wo n't bother anymore , you are not even reading, 
  sweden failed because you did it bad and alone . 
  but the eu is pushing for it as a whole . 
  also , i did n't slander uk because i have n't made any judgement on to them . 
  i perfectly understand why they do n't want it and of course it must not be force of them . 
  but they are blocking it for the mayority of the eu that actually want it . 
  i personally think that right now is not the time for ftt , since there are other problems , but in the future you will see if not the whole eu some kinda of treaty between eu countries to put the ftt . 
  and i repeat again that i do n't think the eurozone problems have anything to do with ftt . 
  sorry if that 's your main point , do n't care . 
  even though what you are saying is mostly true , you have to admit that your title is misleading . 
  good job slandering ftt . 
  people that say it failed is because they look at how much it collected , but it is not for collecting . 
  the only part i agree is that eurozone problems are not because the lack of ftt . 
  once the crisis pass and if uk let us , you will see how ftt actually works . 
  2007 -  36 % 2014 -  100 % well played !, 
  the law is good . 
  selling the land 100years ago and now getting it back for nothing from whoever has it now ( who could be anyone , not just the original buyer descendants ) is bad . 
  no please !, 
  just stay in the same timezone as the mayority of europe . 
  there is n't any benefit by changing it . 
  he/she should talk in his/her mother language , of course . 
  not that i want a ue president , mind you . 
  can i ask for more green but without the rain . 
  or maybe some of the old forests back , this time we will take care of them , promise . 
  [ pandereta ] ( http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/jugar-la-pandereta-1706528.jpg ) [ tambourine country ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bqjcl3z03h8/t90lig08c9i/aaaaaaaadq4/oggrmaclk_s/s1600/pandereta.gif ), 
  i got `` italia dei valori - lista di pietro ( indipendente ) '' 67 % so i look it up on wikipedia : `` feminism '' `` populism '' `` radicalism '' : s i think eurobonds and nuclear power gave me this result . 
  the least one with `` democratic unionist party ( northern ireland ) '' - 13 %, 
  that was n't really unpopular . 
  let me try . 
  in less than 10 years turkey will prove that no muslim country can be truly secular . 
  they are already in the brink of fundamentalism , you will see . 
  spot on . 
  then morocco pls, 
   edit : i mean , i work hard all day to be born here . 
  so , what are you implying ? 
  maybe i did n't work hard for my country , but my parents did it for me , as my grandparents did it for them as i 'm going to do it for my children . 
  i do n't think they have worked it for muhammads but i can ask them . 
  do n't worry , they are going to france anyway . 
  it is kinda of a threat though , more like a discouraging factor for the referendum . 
  the thing is , the independant movement has risen a lot in this economical crisis , and one of the strong points is how better the economy will be . 
  to me , the whole economic point should n't have any relevance whatsoever but whatever . 
  if you read any spanish message board about this particular matter , you will see three types of discussions . 
  - historical claims . 
  `` secession '' or `` succession '' war \u00bf ? \u00bf ? 
  - economical future of catalunya . 
  - where would bar\u00e7a play . 
  kinda of pathetic , stay away for the sake of your sanity . 
   the unionists are always saying that we 'll not be able to use euros . 
  whelp , they are wrong . 
  you can use whatever you want unilaterally . 
  anyway , i strongly recomend you to stay away from the dollar . 
  you are right !!, 
  it is not . 
  you will be xenophobic but that does not sound that bad , does it ? 
   that 's true ( at least in theory ) , but on the other hand , the racial differences between jews and non-jews in europe are basically non-existent try to say that in/on stormfront, 
  it 's horrible , and i 'm as republican as the next guy . 
  the one i like best/most is the old spanish military flag . 
  it is similiar to the england flag , but i like it better . 
  i have worked with people from the philippines and the few who knew english talk it even worse than me . 
  i was told that english had some kind of officiality there and people talk it , but in the end , we needed someone traducing . 
  and by the way , they usually have english names with spanish surnames , like paul santos , claire flores and things like that . 
  greek is not romance but french is . 
  anyway , as a spaniard , to be aligned with anything past italy seems wrong to me . 
  as a spaniard , i always find funny how we are southern europe by the un with people as far as greece and all the balcans guys , whome we dont have any actual interaction nor history between us . 
  all our history is with france , britain and a little bit with italy . 
  also spain alongside portugal are as west as you can go in europe . 
  but whelp , that 's what you get when you have a dictator when the divisions were made . 
  nobody wants to be aligned with a poor and fascist dictatorship country . 
  `` beign able to live anywhere in the eu after you retire and draw your pension there directly '' i find this mindset so bad . 
  rajoy has some of the best quotes in spanish politics , but `` it 's very difficult todo esto '' it 's my favorite , i use it all the time !, 
  do you realize you do n't have a clue what you are talking about ? 
  that the problem with the roma comunity has nothing to do with race and genetics , is all about their culture which is isolationist and will never change . 
  nah , do n't bother , he does not even know what a gypsy is . 
  the problem is , madrid mayor is not socialist , and has n't been one for 25 years . 
  because the spanish fighting bull is a unique breed originated here . 
  but i think we should get some eagles as our symbol , sure no other country thought of that . 
  or better , lions !, 
  you know typical european animal . 
  that 's logic . 
  oh wait ... we already have/had both in our flags . 
  i do n't get the `` no more bailouts for greece and portugal '' , we have already bail them , what do you want ? 
  risk a default ? 
  montenegro wins ... but i wonder about russia , they do n't appear in the graph and for what i know they could give it a shot at the top . 
   supporting human life they ca n't support a tree , much less human life . 
  nobody `` live '' there , it only has one [ building ] ( http://db2.stb.s-msn.com/i/1a/2fbb22e74c0c78d5b1c4596967d21_h422_w598_m2_q90_chrfsczmj.jpg ) for the scientists . 
  oh , come on . 
  it 's not like i had to make excuses for what spain did 200-400 hundreds years ago , but that is the fricking black legend . 
  go to south america and you will see they are still there peru , venezuela , bolivia , and the mestizos in mexico or colombia . 
  invasion , culture destroyed , kind of slavery ; guilty , but `` most vicious mass murderers '' no, 
  romani stole my bike, 
  the games are in a city not in a country . 
  istanbul is okish ... btw , this talk is worthless , the olimpics goes to tokyo for sure . 
  and i 'm thankfull for that . 
  glad i saw this before answering .
