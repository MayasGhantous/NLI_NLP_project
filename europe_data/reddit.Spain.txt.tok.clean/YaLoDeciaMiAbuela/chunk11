  exactly , they are not going to war , they are just going to bomb the syrian army to make sure the rebels and al-qaeda win the civil war . 
  international boicoting of a national custom is probabaly the best way to make sure the custom stays forever . 
  just saying . 
  bullfighting is dying off by itself . 
  i 'm 28 and i have never set a foot in a bullfighting ring , and i have n't seen much interest about it in my generation , let alone younger ones . 
   declared the problem `` fixed '' after doing nothing aka politics . 
  you could have it when you joined , but not changing it afterwards . 
  not that i care , i 'm just telling you what 's happening . 
   there 's actually been great success with simple programs to improve such slums . 
  for example , pay children to go to school where they are fed and get medical help not in spain i can tell you , waste of public money . 
  ( but we have wasted so much in other things that it does n't really matter ) . 
  in my school days , they brought just one gypsy girl to my class , she lasted 3 or 4months coming irregularly to class , in the end she just bit another girl in the arm that got badly infected ( a real bite , she bit hard and did n't let go until the teacher pull her out ) and left school for good . 
  other clases did n't had better luck either with theft and brawls i never thought it was a race thing , it just their culture . 
  not a fan . 
  flaming does not prove your point . 
  i must say though , that when al assad was losing the war they did n't use it , and now that they almost won it , they are using it just so the usa-uk have a reason to involve themselves . 
  come on !!, 
  it makes no sense . 
  all this arab spring crap and rebellions are so staged . 
  that does not matter . 
  civil war did n't go as planned , time to get involved . 
  so you wo n't accept what your country employers offer , but then you go abroad to beg for a two days job ? 
  yeah , you are right . 
  now i feel stupid . 
  i was thinking more like ekray but i forgot we got a fair share of independants, 
  superior to others , not to every other culture . 
  i feel any european culture is superior to cultures based on a fictional bearded man in sandals waiting in heaven to judge you by his random laws ... but that 's just me , eh . 
  because language and culture are more important than political beliefs . 
  maybe if we have stats about what we like to do , how we do behave , or how we spent our time , you will see a real difference . 
  so spain in `` what do you consider yourself first ? '', 
  has a total sum of 75 % ( spanish and christian ) , since there is no other religion followed in spain ... how fucked up is that ? 
  i do n't get the evolving customs . 
  if it is a big bill or you like the service you leave a tip rounding the bill , now and 20 years ago . 
  what has changed ? 
  till german elections ? 
  that would be enough . 
  even if that is true , who are the state to tell me what i can or can not do ? 
  i hate this `` for your own good '' bullshit . 
  spain is n't . 
  it is just the goverment smoke screen . 
  nobody has care about gibraltar in the past decade , and now is the next big thing ... come on . 
  and they are talking about an alliance with argentina that was enemy number one last year . 
  this is ridiculous !, 
   if only the spaniards had such preocupations towards ceuta and olivenza . 
      such gross double standards wo n't allow anyone to take them seriously . 
  this is not about sovereignty . 
  this is about the smuggling and the concrete blocks . 
  the majority of the spaniards do n't care about gilbraltar beign british ( notable exception in some of the more nationalist people , but that is to expect ) . 
  the problem is the tax haven , and all the tax evading that generates in that zone . 
  to be honest i liked the closed fence idea , but if the rest of europe ( sans uk ) is going to bitch about it , then whatever , let them do as they please . 
  about the other claims . 
  i do n't really know ( care ) about olivenza case , if they want to be portuguese let them be . 
  but melilla and ceuta though , the people living there are spaniards , not moors , and they have never been part of morocco . 
  so why give it to them ? 
  makes no sense . 
  wow , do you really buy that crap ? 
  because they pays taxes like everyone else , their salary is justified ? 
  it strike me as odd that netherlands or denmark did n't have wolves , because the only wolves in spain are in the north . 
  then i looked at wikipedia and saw [ this . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_gray_wolf_populations_by_country ) i did n't know that the wolf has been almost eradicated form west europe . 
  here , famers are still asking to temorary lift the wolf hunting ban ... 
  was nemtsov , whom i 've never heard of , even a threat to putin ? 
  i think this theory had all the chances to snowball , actually . 
  i was n't expecting a spaniard anyway . 
  to be honest , i thought we were going to get i\u00f1igo montoya . 
  creepy and it looks small , i do n't think i fit in there, 
  i 've never studied spanish but is n't it like words that end in `` a '' are female and the rest male ? 
  honest question , i have no idea . 
  edit : well ** madre ** is female and does not end in ** a ** but that 's convenient , it may be more irregularities like that . 
  edit2 : there is also ** nariz ** ( nose ) ** perdiz ** ( partridge ) which are female too , there must be other rules i do n't know off ... and ** bendici\u00f3n ** ( blessing ) is female too , and ** cura ** can mean different things if it 's male or female , ok scrap what i said , there is no sense in this, 
  last decade overall : - 1 football worldcup - 1 football eurocup - 3 champions league - 8 grand slams - 4 davis cups - 1 basketball world championship - 2/3 euroleague i 'm not sure . 
  - handfull spanish baksetball players in the nba ( gasol 2 nba rings ) - 2 f1 championship - 4 tours - 1 handball world championship and well 5 handball champions league , maybe that 's less important but i 'm originally from ciudad real so i kind of followed the 3 that we won . 
  overall , it 's not just the amount that it was won , it 's that we were a challenger in everything . 
  so whatever the sport event there was , you could watch a good spanish side . 
  and the downfall has been very soft , and we all know it could n't last so nobody is bitter , like in the last football world cup that nobody got angry after losing so bad . 
  the jxsi makes more difficult to apreciate what happened in the right-left department ; which people do n't care apparently . 
  jxs\u00ed is convergencia ( right ) and erc ( left ) and it 's not clear what happened , combined they have lost 10 seats from what they had , but it 's hard to tell who of the two lost that , convergencia , erc or both . 
  one posibility : before this elections convergencia was with union which were less independentist ( if any ) and since they split it 's possible that part of the electorate has gone to c 's a more young right wingy party and unionist . 
  on the other hand you had the cup up 7 seats , they are independentist and left winger , just like erc but they did n't want to join jxsi because convergencia , so it 's also possible that erc was the one that lost votes to cup which would represent a much serious `` left '' who does not join right wingers . 
  all in all , ciu+erc+cup has gotten basically the same seats as last elections , 2 less seats to be precise ; so while people only talk about independentism , it has not changed of what was before , but we coud really have a real shift in the right-left aspect , but we do n't know . 
   30 minutes to eat . 
  kill me now, 
   to realize that they smoke a lot , drink a lot , and ** eat fried pork as snacks ** . 
  spain has that [ convered too ] ( http://www.totsnack.com/media/k2/items/cache/c82cc4e14a1d2c8c8ffff9840d24b558_xl.jpg ) , ( i once saw a stat that said that denmark was the first consumer of pork per capita in the world , and spain the second ) and we actually won that ranking with 85.5 with compared to ~ 82 of denmark is nothing . 
  pork is love , pork is life . 
  read what ? 
  the title said all i need to sprut my hate . 
  [ no no ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrziivqrxi&amp;t=0m10s ), 
  maybe finland ... 
  if that does not work either ; what 's the next country ? 
  thanks, 
  but why is that exactly ? 
  i 'm curious, 
  why are we against ** mandatory quotas ** ? 
  are you kidding me ? 
  what kind of solidarity is the one being forced by other countries ? 
  it 's called extortion . 
  the ones who support quotas are suppoting extortion to other countries . 
  i 'm not against taking refugees , 15k for spain is nothing , that 's not the problem at all . 
  they 've been saying it from the get go .
