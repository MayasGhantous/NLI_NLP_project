  they do n't stay in turkey they do n't stay in greece they do n't stay in italy they do n't stay un hungary they do n't stay in austria they try to avoid by all means necessary to be indentified in any country but germany because you have to ask asylum in the first country you enter . 
  the thing i hate the most about this crisis , are the fucking bleeding hearts here in spain and the media that feeds them ( i ca n't watch la sexta anymore , insulting hungary every day , and portraying that country as life in hell ) `` we need to take them '' `` what a shame europe is '' and etc ** que no quieren venir aqui , cojones ya !, 
  i 've been explaining this for a month already . 
  anyway ... ** threaten ** , 
  i guess `` seres de luz '' did n't translate as well as i thought since light also means no-heavy . 
  maybe `` beings made of light '' . 
  in spain we love to call germans ( satirically ) light beings , in a [ lovecraftian ] ( http://www.lunarwisdom.net/uploads/8/1/9/3/8193244/3696383.jpg?275 ) way , people that live on a higher plane of thought and ca n't be wrong and do no evil . 
  germans are light beings, 
  wow i forgot about pegida , do they still exist ? 
  should n't we hear more about them now ? 
  not that i 'm complaining . 
  we are n't communists . 
  if people want to learn a career and can pay for it , so be it ; what they can not do is protest after that there are no jobs for them . 
  in truth , they know perfectly that they wo n't find a job with some degrees but they claim injustice nonetheless , `` quien no llora no mama '' `` who does not cry does not suck ( breastfeed ) '' a spanish saying and mentality that keeps dragging us down . 
  so they take the muslims from a secular republic to morocco a religious monarchy to teach them ... what again ? 
  it 's used in pop culture as not caring about others , that 's why the term is used mostly to belittle anti-social people or by emo teens to set themselves apart and special . 
  but on the other hand , if you know you are a nihilist , what 's the point saying it out loud . 
  saying this in spain will really get you into trouble . 
  people will claim that university is to educate yourself and learn what you want . 
  and then , it 's the country 's fault to not provide you a job in the field you studied . 
  take education degree for example . 
  from where i from , there is amost an anual protest of these people asking for more teacher jobs . 
  when in reallity , there are no kids !!, 
  there are more teachers than kids . 
  how the fuck do you demand a job !, 
  `` the man who didnt say something he was n't sure , to someone who could have destroyed the world if he was to belive what he said . '', 
  but it does not have the same ring to it . 
  what it surprise me , it 's the humble house he lives in ; there are syrian refugees in spain that lives in better houses . 
  what ? 
  did you think there would be a thread without mentioning the refugees ? 
  poor you . 
  it could have been traumatic , but you know , in spain they aired this show at midday , while eating , and in between classes . 
  also they aired teenage mutant ninja turtles after that . 
  whatever the scary shit you want to pull on us , finland , it wo n't work if after that comes the song `` raphael is cool but crude , gim me a break '', 
   they are essentially harassing the refugees so they do n't ask for asylum there - the refugees flee syria because they are killed - the refugees flee turkey because the condition are terrible - the refugees flee greece because it 's overwhelmed - the refugees flee hungary because they are harassed that 's why they came to germany . 
  there is people who actually belive this . 
  refugees go to germany because everyone else is terrible , not because the free handouts . 
  you just ca n't reason with them . 
  italy , germany , spain and france is exactly 50 % of eu population though . 
  let 's see first if any of these its true ; i saw that page that same night , and people on other message board who knew arabic said that he was supporting the mujahideen ( who could be anyone fighting ) and the flag was the shahada ; the al-nusra link ( which is a big deal imo ) i do n't see it yet . 
  this news outlet looks kurdish biased ( just by looking at the articles ) so do n't jump the gun and let 's wait and see . 
  as always , the spaniards coming late to a trend and going farther than anyone . 
  more roman than anyone , more muslim than anyone , more catholic than anyone , more revolutionary than anyone , more absolutist than anyone , more progressive than anyone , more fascist than anyone more gay than anyone and now we want to be more welcoming than anyone ; and tomorrow we will be more nazi than anyone , just you wait . 
  spain history in a paragraph ; just following the actual fashion harder and more shamelessly than anyone . 
  the night that guy came to spain ; i almost puked , there were dozens of reporters , the mayor went to the airport , the sport club manager , he was interviewed in the spot by the football talk show ; everyone wanted to be in the photo . 
  what a shamefull display , whatever this guy end up or not being part of al-nusra or not , it does not matter . 
  in spain case , there is ferrero , herrera , herrero or herreros for smith ; pretty sure smith would beat molina if you sum those variations , and that without counting ferrer or ferreria from catalan and galician . 
  usually toponyms surnames in spain comes from jews ; when they changed their surnames , they usually chose the place they were from . 
  so surnames like toledo , sevilla , soria , valencia come mostly from jews ( not all of course ), 
  they are with the rebels . 
  the problem it 's that they 've tell us that the rebels are seculars that want western democracy and whatnot . 
  but as of now , they are led by al-nusra , which has ties with al-qaeda . 
  in syria , there is no good side , choose your evil . 
  i almost always use western or `` the west '' because it encompass people who are not from europe but i feel much closer than some of the other european ( im not meaning that they are not west , just not that close ) . 
  i only use european as european citizen not as a ethnic-cultural thing ; because i do n't get much use out of it . 
  then again , for some people the west encompass very few countries , sometimes not even spain which is bollocks to me but , what can you do ? 
  i do n't have the right to tell anyone what to feel . 
  `` got ta catch them all '' is the motto of the photographers . 
  at this rate , they will have the photo of every refugee kid in no time . 
  does n't matter they are not going to france . 
  1 . - for 10 points ; what are the syrians who are throwing bottles and shouting allah akbar doing in this video ? 
  \u2610 - praying \u2610 - thanking god \u2610 - displaying their faith . 
  \u2610 - attacking infidels . 
  none so blind as those who do n't want to see, 
  thanks for misinforming . . [ takbir ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/takbir ) the ** takb\u012br ** is the term for the arabic phrase ** all\u0101hu akbar ** usually translated as `` allah is great '' , `` allah is [ the ] greatest '' . 
  it is a common islamic arabic expression , ** used ** in various contexts by muslims ; ** in formal prayer , in the call for prayer , as an informal expression of faith , in times of distress , or to express resolute determination , defiance or as a battle cry in islamist protests , islamic extremism , and islamic terrorism . 
  ** there is plenty wrong on shouting allah akbar to other people ; and you people who defend this shit because you want to cover yourself in an hypocritical goodwill , gross me to no end . 
  religion is the cancer of this world ; the abrahamic religions are the most intolerant of the lot and inside it , islam is just the most vicious and backwards of the three . 
  so ** no ** , i wo n't tolerate this bullshit ; some guys throwing stones and bottles to the people from the countries they are forcing to enter , while shouting their fanatical battle cry . 
  ** just no **, 
  what is this thing i kept reading about the manipulation of the photo in the train tracks . 
  from the first time i read/hear they put themselves there ; 've never read otherwise . 
  asylum seekers werent all the rage back then ... even though it 's just roughly over a month . 
  man , i was in holidays at the time ; how slow this last weeks have passed :(, 
  are you people surprised because they are too many or too few ? 
  to me it sounds about right , to be honest i expect maybe more , but i usually underrate the indeferent ones . 
  i tried to answer this up there ; i did n't say that germans pronounce g as `` h '' , i said that when spaniards imitate german accent we put the sound `` h '' in everyword because that is how german sound to us . 
  you ca n't blame us ; look what someone wrote down in the thread `` ich spreche ein bisschen deutsch ! '', 
  no , i say mar ** ga ** rita like radio ** gaga ** . 
  the guy though does an english ` h ' or for us , spaniards , a ` j' i guess i will answer the rest in the other question in this thread to not clog it too much : yes some people in andalusia pronounce stuff differently ; no , not just like latin american spanish ; and that guy does not have an andalusian accent at all . 
  and about the german , basically the first thing you will note when imitating a german accent ( apart of sounding angry ) is to put the english `` h '' sound or `` ch '' , gutural g or whatever you want to call it ; in every word , the more consonants around it the better . 
  that 's how it kind of sounds in spanish . 
   but people were crying that we should n't do anything giving weapons and arms to the rebels and boycotting the syrian government is `` something '' though . 
  and that 's half of the picture , the west supported the `` arab spring '' tunissia , egypt , lybia and syria ( reflect on those countries now for a moment ) directly attack lybia ; and a big help for isis was the ruin iraq was after the americans . 
  so the `` we did n't do anything '' it 's sketchy at best . 
  i have to give props to the spanish guy . 
  trying to pronounce ciencia harshly , when both ` c 's are ` th ' in spain spanish was an impossible task . 
  but i like how he change the ` g ' for `` h ' in marharita which is something we do when imitating german accent . 
  ninja edit : she can speak as softly as she want , calling an ambulance kraken wagon is still scary as hell . 
  i can read `` cantar de mio cid '' ( xii century ) without a problem . 
  but there was a big change in pronunciation ( artificial btw ) about 500 years ago . 
  comparing to english pronunciation : ` h ' became mute ( it was ` f ' ) ; that 's why we have `` hern\u00e1ndez '' and `` fern\u00e1ndez '' ` x ' became ` x ' ( it was h ) ; mexico ( and texas ) remained with the old spelling . 
  ` j' became ` h ' ; jajaja then later ; the z and soft c that was pronounce like `` ts '' ( like italian zz i think ) became the infamous `` th '' sound in european spanish , and another boring 's ' ( three lettes for the same fucking sound ) in american spanish . 
  my uncle used to have a handgun and i 've shoot it , it did n't caught my interest tbh . 
  he is into shooting , participates in competitions and such ; but now he likes the bow better so i do n't know if he still had the gun . 
  people complaining that their succesfull language is not spoken everywhere . 
  language jihadism is a thing . 
  sweden and germany ( among others ) have a welfare system that other countries simply do not have it ; maybe they do n't want it , ca n't afford it or it 's not convenient culturally or politically . 
  spain is ready and eager i would say to take refugees in ; but we are going to feed them , dress them , give them a school for their children and a roof on their heads . 
  but we are not going to give them a house and a monthly paycheck like sweden , because not even our poors have that .
