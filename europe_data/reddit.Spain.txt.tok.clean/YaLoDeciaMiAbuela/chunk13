  so if you offer more , do n't complain later that the refugees only want to go to your country . 
  you do n't throw your people into a war where you dislike all sides yes you hate isis , but the others are al-qaeda and al-assad . 
  why would your soldiers die for it ? 
  we are talking about a century ago , but how is not a `` close '' country ? 
  [ look at sheet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_diaspora ) ps : by the way because of this , i just found out that jean reno was named `` juan moreno y herrera-jim\u00e9nez '', 
   and we all know how it all ended . 
  i do n't , i have n'tr even heard of that city ; did the spaniards do something ? 
  i did n't find anything on google . 
  i think you go to your closest ; during and immediately after the spanish civil war ; spaniards fled to argentina , france and venezuela mostly ( i think in that order ) . 
  not britain , not the us nor russia . 
  later when spain was at peace , the spaniards change their destination to germany . 
  now , the difficult question . 
  can you tell me what spaniards were the refugees and who were the immigrants ? 
   eu needs unified benefits by purchasing power ehm no . 
  hi , for anyone who thinks that what france said made sense ; let 's do a recap of the beligerants of this war . 
  ** al asad ** - the dictator ; brutal and merciless but before the war , syria was kind of decent 2 . 
  ** isis ** - jihadist , murderes and slavers all approved by religion . 
  ** kurds ** - the fan favorites , but they are n't fighting for syria but to not be syria . 
  so they are on another race 4 . 
  ** rebels ** - the good guys right ? 
  these days they are led by al-nusra ; who is al-nusra ? 
  a branch of al-qaeda so choose your poison ; i 'm baffled about why france would say that ; do we prefer al-qaeda to al-assad ? 
  really ? 
  well ... yes , the west have been pushing in the same direction of al-qaeda for a while , and you can see the result on the arab spring ; tunisia , libya , egypt and syria . 
  much democracy , very safety . 
  we ( well spain has little to say here ) keep pushing for the same fail politics we 've been doing the past years . 
  did i ever tell you what the definition of insanity is ? 
  i see that the % is based on the total votes and not in the number of voters . 
  good start . 
  you assumed right . 
  german companies even came to my town ( well i 'm from madrid , more like my father 's town ; in la mancha no more than 5000 pop ) and a couple of friends ( without a college degree ) try this way ; went to germany for a few months working on a hotel , without knowing any german at all but taking german courses ; in the end they were n't really prepared to move to another country and came back on their own volition . 
  i had other friends that just went there on their own , threw some applications around and they got offers to choose from . 
  ( one of them is very succesfull there i may add but he is very talented so ... ) so yeah , i do n't know for sure , but my guess is for an eu citizen it 's going to be easy to get a job in germany ; other thing is if it 's worth it , if they are ready to move ; learn the language and etc. 
  but job offers are not the problem . 
  all of this imho . 
  about if they help more the refugees than us , well , it 's not my country and it 's not for me to decide or criticize who they help more , but one would say that a syrian may need more help than a spaniard . 
  so the problem is ; they not working ? 
  they not integrating ? 
  they staying ? 
  or what the heck ? 
  every spaniard i know that went to germany got a job fairly quickly . 
  now , not every unemployed spaniard , wants to go to germany . 
  they are not waiting in spain saying `` oh , i wish germany would give me a job '' or anything like that ; in fact there 's been programs by german companies that came here to make job offers and courses in germany . 
  if you do n't roll the r , what 's the point anyway ? 
  are you guys seriously discussing real politics of a fictional game ? 
  i side with the nords because the leader kills people with his voice and the other is a random bald guy ; get your reasons straight !, 
   their strange kind of islam random rules that forbid random things ? 
  like , i do n't know , every religion ever ? 
  what 's so strange about that ? 
  how real is this ? 
  edit : since this sentence is funny apparently , let me try again . 
  maybe , but not because of this . 
  accepting refugees from countries you have been at war 30 years ago that pray everyday for the destruction of your country it 's not the sanest thing to do . 
  i 'm totally with you ; i do n't enjoy the driking culture of north europeans and end up hanging out with other spaniards or italians at parties . 
  in a week , i already canceled my erasmus and went back to spain . 
  i did n't really get the gist of berlin ; and there was such a crappy weather too ( at least when i went ) that you could only stay home at day , and go binge driking at night . 
  that life is not for me . 
  [ basque y chromosome ? 
  ] ( http://www.eupedia.com/images/content/haplogroup-r1b-df27.gif ) but it 's still a r1b so i do n't get this super different genetics and stuff ; they are less mixed than france or spain , that 's logical but they are still related . 
  you wish !, 
  the `` neutrality '' thing is a meme right ? 
  because if i remember correctly ( and by remember i mean i just checked wikipedia ) sweden went to afghanistan in the nato operation . 
  interesting , looks like the climate change is also political . 
  i guess it was clear with the us-iran nuclear deal ; no more axis of evil ? 
  yesterday , our foreign minister was in iran too ; he said that we have to make peace with asad , because you can only make peace with your enemies or something . 
  turkey pls !, 
  of course you can sell weapons to war-torn countries ; just do n't get caught like the rest of us . 
  i completly agree on that . 
  i 'm going to do another post . 
  does people realize that this ones are going to be taken from italy , greece and hungary ? 
  that the ones that get to germany without being identified do n't count in this . 
  man , this is not going to be pretty . 
  3 per 10k people . 
  i 'm not sure , but i think we can manage . 
  they are not supossed to work anyway . 
  you get 2 refugees for 10k people ; the minimum , also each country will provide what they can ( want ) ; so pls , it 's fucking nothing ;, 
  i want to apologize to every refugee that will have the bad luck to be sent to spain . 
  i 'm sorry for the inconvenience , i know being sent to spain where you wo n't have half the benefits germany promised does n't seem fair . 
  i know you would n't even have tried that dangerous travel for this ; but this is part of the eu politics , propaganda and self pandering we are used to . 
  you will just have to deal with it . 
  and also , with the spaniards , that will think they are making you a favor for this . 
  eastern europe does not want to take refugees . 
  refugees do n't want to go eastern europe either ( well nowhere except germany or sweden really ) so what 's the problem here ? 
  also ... force solidarity is not solidarity ; it 's extortion . 
  well , if it 's doing better is not thanks to the west , and remember that there is still a three sided war going on there . 
  they lack kurds , iran supporting one side , and a no-ones-land country beside them like iraq to be exactly the same . 
   i never had problems understanding anyone from the americas well i have ; i have received tech support in mexican spanish and i have to call again and pretend i do n't speak spanish and use english . 
  edit : and do n't get me wrong , im all in for the language proficiency certificate , but the reality is that some american countries have taken slang too far . 
  so many things wrong in what you said . 
  germany is giving free movement to all the refugees . 
  second spain is ready to get our share of refugees , by our politicians and our people . 
  needless to say , we are not going to give them the welfare germany is giving because not even our citizens have it . 
  of course without the free housing and the handouts , syrians refugees wo n't bother trying to get to europe and will stay in turkey . 
   it 's not like spain never got help from others ... franco died in bed . 
  the spaniards of today are not refugees nor immigrants not sons of them , they ate dictatorship whole ; so if we help , and belive me , we want to help , it 's because we want to no because we owe the world shit . 
  i do n't know man , it really looks like propaganda . 
  if you enter the news you will see that we had photos of drown kids for a while ( i saw them before from the syrian conflict twitter ) . 
  but suddenly we got this one in the main page of all the newspapers ... 
  i do n't know man , i 'm not used to wear tinfoil hats but this really smells ... 
  well i do n't know , the germans asked for this , so i do n't know why they wo n't want this .
