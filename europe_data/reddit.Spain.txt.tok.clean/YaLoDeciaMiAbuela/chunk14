  what they can not ask is for hungary to do the screening , identification and expulsion for them . 
  they made this problem , let them `` eat their brown '' as we say in spain . 
  ( edit : no race connotation , brown as mess ), 
  the sooner they get to germany the better . 
  come on , they go to germany because of the `` free housing + 400 $ '' welfare pack they got there , sweden is the second destination for the same reason . 
  there are other syrians entering through italy ( the ones with more resources ) and they do n't stay there either . 
  and the refugee cuota is going to be a disaster because of this . 
  i got negative - negative , i always get gandhi but this questionary is bullshit ; i find flaws almost in every question . 
  hahaha ... no no no you did n't understand . 
  i mean that countries with these immigrant problem should put buses to the border , but to the border closest to germany ; where the immigrant want to go . 
  it will happen everywhere , its an endless fight against the capital , and you only need to lose once , and you lose forever . 
  moreso when nationality these days means having a paper that says so . 
  probably because the ones arriving to austria are already identified . 
  i would invite him to a beer for trying but at the same time i would scold him for doing it so bad . 
  no , but that 's beside the point it 's about helping the countries that have to do the heavy lifting ; whichever they are , greece , hungary or whatever . 
  meanwhile , buses to the border would be my choice . 
  this is not a contest ; you save/help people because you want to save/help people ; that should be your reason , whatever others do . 
  i do n't understand how his death is pinned on europe . 
  sorry for being blunt , but the kid died in the pass from turkey to greece . 
  turkey not syria ; someone decide to risk the kid 's life not for safety but for welfare . 
  i will say the same i say about sub-saharian immigration . 
  or we do fortress europe and no one enters so they wo n't even try . 
  or we go and take the refugees/immigrants from a safe place before they risk their lifes in the sahara or the mediterranean . 
  this middleground shit , in which the people has to risk their life before being allowed in , it 's plainly wrong . 
  myself , i belive in both things , fortress europe you do n't accept immigrants who came illegally and go take the immigrants/refugees we want/accept/need saving . 
  you are actually pretty damn far east . 
  and we also tend to look west where we left some things . 
  i do n't know much about georgia ; i met an armenian trader once in france ; he spoke pretty good spanish , and was catholic or something . 
  he was ** bonach\u00f3n ** and ** campechano ** ( ** good-nature ** and ** folsky ** is the translation it gives me ) so that 's the character i assign at the people of that zone ; but i 've never met anyone else . 
  because war in syria there are afghan men trading food for sex with nigerians in budapest . 
  this refugee saga is interesting . 
  the best pro-independence campaign is always done by pp tbh . 
  i would like independence from pp too . 
  australia has always been an important part of europe ; i mean , with all the habsburgs and shit . 
  i was n't really playing the `` americans do n't have culture '' meme ; rereading it now , it may look like it . 
  america has this cosmopolitan urban culture where everything goes but at the same time there is very little that they all share . 
  it 's a nice way of living and easy to integrate to ; i like america , but that does n't mean i want rest of the world to become america . 
  we do n't give benefits and we do n't have jobs ; let them come if they want ; go nuts . 
  you may think that , but actually not , if you ask the average spaniard to name kings during the reconquista , which lasted various centuries , you will barely get the catholic kings and that 's about it . 
  here , we talk about the last civil war , a lot actually ; i hate it . 
  this migrant crisis ? 
  you people are overreacting ; it will create ghetos in some northen european countries and that 's it . 
  in the long run we will become a bland america style of nation with some religious problems thrown in , but that 's about it . 
  here comes the dank memes [ andalusia ] ( http://i.imm.io/128nf.jpeg ) - lazy coming back after collecting the per ( a subsidy ) | hey !, 
  it 's siesta time [ catalonia ] ( http://s21.postimg.org/gxylq8pqv/nota_libre_20130407_105126_01_1_1.jpg ) - stingy what a dilemma ; i do n't know if get that cent or save brakes | fuck it, 
  just when we got rid of ours . 
  summer is always slow . 
  right now , apart from migrant related news , we have forest burnings and a little bit of politics because in a month there are some local elections in catalunya . 
  yesterday or saturday , i do n't quite remember , the third story on the news ( the first one was the austrian truck , and the second one was migrants found dead near our shores ) , was that ingrid bergman was born a century ago . 
  merkel , such friendly , much diplomacy . 
  i bet pointing fingers will help negotiating . 
  coming to r/europe to post and translate this pedro j. story from his blog it 's kind of sad , mate . 
  i 'm glad i ca n't answer any of those questions . 
  ww2 is not a thing in spain . 
  so the same as slovakia , about 200 refugees . 
  well , they should remind the good things it brings . 
  if it 's good or bad its for each one to decide . 
   who have the right to stay there is no such right , a country decides to take them or not . 
  the comments entered that circlejerk about how progressive it is while i was thinking that this centre will be pretty useless , and that it may be just a pr stunt to show the political standpoint . 
  now , this makes way more sense ; and it 's not as superfluous as i thought it was . 
  gypsys and old people ; the first ones i do n't care because their culture forbids them to work even if they have to live like that ; but there is plenty of old people that they really have no options , and they are not `` that '' at fault for the situation ; there should be some mechanism to protect them . 
  `` everybody knows someone who 's been evicted '' i do n't know anyone who knows someone who 's been evicted . 
  i do n't undestarnd either why every shit dug out have to become a tourist atraction . 
  then people go expecting something interesting and they are shown a broken wall and feel scammed . 
  a customs officer in an airport ? 
  that sounds very unlikely to happen anywhere in the world . 
  unless you people count a random compliment while dealing with people `` sexual harassment '' , i would not belive that story . 
  it 's summer ; migrant season and slow news . 
  i mean even the newspapers are like this ; terrorism and immigration it 's the only thing they are talking about today . 
  when the brawl ended , the guy kept looking for a fight . 
  and also , did you see how he opened the refrigerator , that almost trip it over . 
  i think there may be a precursor to this story because the shopkeeper appears just a second after that with a stick in his hand . 
  i would guess the wild pig , i 've seen a friend being gored by one when we were camping , it 's an agresive little fella . 
  another thing i wo n't recomend you to do is to go around kicking ( or , god forbid , picking up ) medium size stones in the country side ; chances there is a little scorpion under it who you just fuck up his siesta are higher than you think . 
  yeah , i do n't know about belgium so sorry for the hijacking but when i did my exchange to france and they gave us a tour on castles i was `` these are not castles !, 
  they do n't have walls , moats , towers , these are palaces '' still pretty cool but we do n't call that castles . 
  te creees que somos italianos ? 
  [ r1b - df27 ] ( http://cache.eupedia.com/images/content/haplogroup-r1b-df27.gif ) iberian y haplogroup the most common here ; so for the most part , even though we talk latin , we are natives . 
  and your last part is absurd ; by definition the spaniards that left are not the spaniards who stay . 
  read the article , because they are not closing it , they are going to open for everyone . 
  here people defending exclusivity and private beaches , the things i have to read , seriously . 
  i think it 's totally legitimate to shut down a beach only for nudists , only for bearded men or only for people with funny hats . 
  i 've never understood this `` nudist beach '' thingy unless you have beaches to boot . 
  other thing , as i said , are the reasons for that ; this defender of the faith thing russia is playing at . 
  so what ? 
  they are americans now ? 
  cry to them . 
  we , the europeans today , come from the people who did n't immigrate so we do n't owe anything to other immigrants . 
  moscow as moscow city ; not moscow as capital of russia . 
  i think it 's totally legitimate thing to do , the whole `` depraved '' angle is lost to me ; but i would pretty much agree in closing a nudist beach , moreso in a place like moscow that does n't have that many beaches to begin with . 
  the 's ' is pronounce 's ' it 's just the ` z ' and soft ` c ' in old spanish both were pronounce ` ts ', 
  why does people say that spanish is lispy but none say that about english or greek ? 
  which probably have the same amount of words with th sound . 
  we have plenty of 's ' sound too . 
  anyway ; for me german sounds angry , always been , and the rest of germanic languages ( sans english ) sound like non-angry german tbh . 
  i must say though that to my ear , the only languages i can hear are italian , greek and japanese even though it 's not european ( and english but because i 'm used to it ) ; i can make the words even though i do n't know what they mean , but the rest of the languages , i ca n't hear them ; well i guess i can hear basque too . 
  there is a concept here that there is [ two spains ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_two_spains ) who are always fighting ; between napole\u00f3n and franco there 've been 4 civil wars , 2 revolutions , 3 coup de etat , two dictatorship ; 3 kings abdicating or forced to flee . 
  an endless back and forth between liberals and absolutists until franco got a perfect win . 
  all that without counting independence wars and insurrections in colonies ( and not so colonies ) which in some way are related to the same struggle . 
  i mean the carriage is cool and all , but if the people attending your funeral goes with propaganda shirts and trainers , it wo n't look elegant however much money you put into it .
