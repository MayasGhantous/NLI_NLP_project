  i 'm sorry but ferdinand vii reign is absolutely embarrasing , people on the streets shouting `` vivan las cadenas '' `` long live the chains '' beliting the constitution and asking for a king , persecution of liberals ; excuting the heroes of the indepence , artist and scientifics running to france . 
  absolutley shamefull . 
  his reign destroyed everything ; created the two spains , condemn us to a whole century of civil wars , game of thrones , assasination of politicians on the streets and two dictatorship ; we miss the enlightement age and the industrial revolution instead we had religious fanatism . 
  that 's why when people ask the whole `` are you proud of being spaniard ? '', 
  i never know what to say , because i 'm proud of the liberal part of spain that had to fight and survive the other religious and autocratic part which i hate with all my heart . 
  so what i see is an article on a blog with this header `` expanding the lgbtq conversation '' that it 's triying to push this line `` new survey from britain suggests that the heterosexual assumption is less justified than ever '' and they push it because half of the people surveyed did n't answer 100 % . 
  making the question in percentages it 's absurd and it was made purposely this way because the aversion people have in giving a 100 % answer . 
  also a gender distinction would be usefull ; pretty sure males have it very clear ; and let me be blunt here , if you can not get a hard on with males how could you not be 100 % heterosexual . 
  it 's an awarded book ; i have n't read it or watched the show . 
  i never pay it much attention because i thought it was another historical soap opera ; which it probably is , but with nazies and spies . 
  it 's probably good , because they actually put big money on it as i 've just read . 
  tv these days is just a reality show cesspool with some soap operas here and there that made me facepalm everytime i hear they are being aired in other countries . 
  there have been some succesfull sit-coms like `` los serrano '' or `` aqui no hay quien viva '' the only i liked , or `` 7 vidas '' which i hate , but i hate `` friends '' too so there is that . 
  serial drama / science fiction / action thriller and such ( my favorites ) , are almost inexistent , there is some historical ones which look interesting but i can not watch because the awful actors make me cringe . 
  anyway and to finish this , if you have to choose a spanish tv show , do n't put 7 vidas ( pls ) ; you really have to put `` cuentame como pas\u00f3 '' which is the really big one here ( i still do n't like , but i must admit it 's high quality ), 
  we have forests but you have to understand that it 's this type of [ forest ] ( http://esphoto980x880.mnstatic.com/bogajo-bosque-de-encinas_7101021.jpg ) no lush forests ( except in the north ) . 
  it would n't surprised if it 's not considered a forest other countries . 
  they lost me when they said that he could n't have jump himself because he was a muslim . 
  i ca n't stand that shit . 
  at least in surveys ; but happiness is basically the corelation between reality and expectations . 
  as good as your life is , it can be difficult to cope with when you notice that succeding in life is being a handsome footballer/rockstar/actor with a sport car in the garage , and a top model on your arms living an exicitng life ; so this survey , imo , shows basically how much pressure society puts on their young, 
  yes , definitely . 
  they are right wingers , but in a more european way . 
  pp are just the continuation of the fascists ; i do n't like the term fascist , but i can not really explain without using spanish words , and without knowledge of spain 's history and the two spains, 
  andalucia is far more different from madrid than madrid from catalunya , but they do n't make it into the list of different regions because they speak spanish , i see how it is . 
  i always celebrate it with my family , because it 's also my mother 's name day ; ( asunci\u00f3n - assumption ) so it 's like a little birthday she only has . 
   like how hummingbirds are named `` colibri '' in countries that have no such native species . 
  and what 's that supposed to mean ? 
  pretty sure they have hummingbirds in mexico and they call them colibr\u00ed . 
  and i would bet that this bird was called colibr\u00ed way before any english speaker set a foot on america . 
  it 's not a thing . 
  i understand that for once , is a war with one clear evil side but still it 's brought up too much in films and etc. 
  [ cerveza and morcilla ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-k-u_hbkyq_o/ttjgeyfbioi/aaaaaaaaawm/0pgsxli2z-4/s1600/sushi_morcilla.jpg ) few of the celtic origin words surviving in spanish . 
  i do n't know what to belive, 
  he is known to go hunting whenever he can . 
  one of the times he went to [ hunt elephants in africa ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zqdkr.gif ) and was heavely critized for it, 
  you will defintley see them everywhere , but you will hardly exchange more words than `` a bag of ice pls '' `` un eulo , galaxias '' / jk, 
  14 % it 's a fucking lot so i had to look the nationalities : 1/5 romania 1/5 morocco 1/5 western europe ( uk leading ) 1/5 latin america ( ecuador leading ) 1/5 the rest ( china leading ), 
  i love how we make the headlines because we have the best footage of immigration , not for real numbers , which are pretty low really . 
  says who ?? 
  says life itself . 
  for the rest , i can accept that the result will be skewed somewhat , but it 's not an honestity test . 
  there is no catch , it 's summer , it always spikes up in tourism ; this year we are breaking records in tourists ( looks like the competition is suiciding themselves , sometimes literally ) . 
  and to be honest the more you have fallen , the bigger the numbers are on your way up , it 's the same with gdp . 
  it 's pretty funny what you are saying . 
  you reject the idea that people from different countries could have different cheating habits . 
  but on the other hand , you say that they are more or less sincere depending on the country . 
  do n't you see your own contradiction ? 
  i think it shows an aproximation of the reality , the same way it shows that men cheats more than women , which is pretty obvious without the graph . 
  just want to point out that pan 's labyrinth is mexican-spanish , but more mexican than spanish , just giving credit where it 's due ; direction , production and script is mexican , and the location and the actors are spanish . 
  the same way `` the others '' is more spanish than ... erm ... american ? 
  with nicole kidman and british actors ... 
  nationalism ? 
  it was ** you ** the one who said `` citizenship '' ; i 'm not where i was born , i 'm not what a paper says i am , i am myself , my language/s and my culture ; i am what i do , and how i do it ; that 's how i wanted to be judge and how i judge others . 
  nationality , citizenship and flags be dammed . 
   not about culture count me out then . 
  there is a whole section about north-african influence in the genetic history of iberian peninsula . 
  it 's pretty weird actually , i 'm going to take a look at that . 
  one thing here aside of the joke , that the bailouts given by the ez are usually guaranteed by the countries for private investors ( usually banks ) , it 's not germany , france or whatever handing down the money , it 's that if greece does n't pay back the investors , the ez countries will . 
  damn spaniards , ruining our otherwise perfect score !, 
  i 'm glad they did ' t get a perfect score either . 
  mexico why ? 
  europe is going to pay this , not only in safety and social cohesion but in an advancement of far right wing parties . 
  the definition is pretty stupid already , it 's sensible try to change it . 
  it 's oficial in its own regions . 
  catalan or basque is not official , for example , in seville . 
  spanish is the only official language in the whole country , and excuse me if i think that it 's pretty normal that in the parliament the language spoken is the one that everbody speaks . 
  there is no official language in the eu , one language that it 's spoken in the whole union , so we have some kind of `` offcial languages '' of the countries that form it ; which again i think it 's pretty normal . 
  if i were in the eu parliament and i could speak english properly i would n't be speaking in spanish , as much as i love it , but in english because i know people will understand me better and directly . 
  if i just want to pander myself for my local voters , i would create the issue avoiding speaking the language that i know i can be understanded , and then throw a fit , about how much of a victim i am and calling for national pride . 
  west of germany you have a sea of slavic ; sure there are pockets of other languages but it 's nothing special , like we have basque here or they have irish up there ;, 
  ok , let 's look at something more important , like , language ? 
  oh look it 's the fucking same . 
  the southern part looks like the leftovers people did n't know where to put . 
  culturally , iberia and italy are romance and catholic . 
  but we are lumped with slavs and orthodox . 
  in spain 's and portugal 's case , we share 0 history with anything past italy ( except greece and barely ) , never knew them , never meet them . 
  and to be honest not even the weather is the same . 
  at least do a southwestern division , i think if we would have been in a division with north africa it would n't feel as wrong as this . 
  yeah sure , let 's downplay the louvre ; just that museum is more interesting to me than the whole eastern europe , but hey !, 
  shitting on paris is popular so why not ? 
  because greece is not going to be able to pay back this bailout as it is . 
  it 's as simple as that . 
  everyday , i 'm snowballing debt . 
  it 's nothing though , less than half an euro for each spaniard . 
  to put in perspective , each spaniard will put 270 $ for this next bailout to greece ( in case they do n't pay back ), 
  ok ok ok , this is funny , and my math will be wrong , but let me play , ok ? 
  spain has put for the bailouts of greece , ireland , portugal and cyprus , 43 billions already now spain has to put another 12 that 's 55 billions total . 
  spain is a significant chunk of the eurozone so that 's understandable . 
  now spain 's bailout for its banks were ** up to ** 100 billions . 
  and the final figures of how much we took before terminating the program vary depending of where i look but they are around the 60 billion figure . 
  so `` lo comido por lo servido '' as we say in spain `` what is eaten for what is served '' ( traslating idioms : s ) . 
  might as well pay our debt with the debt of others and we go 0 , amrite ? 
  the math ** is wrong ** , because the money is not actually lend , its guaranteed/endorsed so we do n't put actual money , also the same way spain didnt get the whole 100 billions , ireland and portugal probably did n't either ; also the interests are not the same and there might be other miscalculations but its funny nonetheless . 
   britain has opted out of the agreement and still controls its borders , but 63 per cent of britons would like to see border checks reinstated in europe . 
  what ? 
  does this mean what i think it means ? 
  ok , you are the good economist then . 
  if you eat iphones and german cars , sure , you will starve . 
  first of all , it 's more like greece is a fisher and after rough patch he needs to take a loan ( because they can not devaluate , which is what currency sovering countries do ) but in exchange of the loan he is told to sold its boat ; if greece had a grexit 4 years ago , they would be in a better shape today imo .
