  yes right , maybe some wo n't have gender segregation , but they will have death penalty for atheist like me or religious courts that dispense the law and etc. 
  people is people and they will try their best in their situations , so i wo n't call them or not moderates . 
  but no muslim country ( cept turkey and some small others ) can be called `` moderate '' by any standards . 
  i 'm pretty sure some people still do it here , it 's called `` celebrar el santo '' to celebrate the saint ; the saint who you are supposed to be name after . 
  my old teacher in school used to tell me my saint 's day and how i should became christian/catholic and get presents and stuff . 
  my family are atheist for the most part but we used to celebrate my mother 's `` saint '' witch is a holiday in spain anyway and not really a saint . 
  [ this is my mother 's name ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assumption_of_mary ) , yes , the whole thing . 
  i would say there is less spoon food in the summer , but apart [ gazpacho ] ( http://www.idnerja.com/es/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gazpacho-andaluz.jpg ) i ca n't think of anything i do n't eat in winter too . 
  `` something happened that i do n't like . 
  it was the joos . '', 
  every fucking time, 
  there is a roundabout to this rule , you can criticize the people if you say it in a general way ; and everyone will know you are refering to the spanish , but do n't say it directly or it will backfire big time ; we do n't accept to be judged by forasteros . 
  also `` derecho '' means straight as straight ahead , like ` pravo ' in croatian so we have come full circle . 
  i still need a explaining about why cutting wages helps the economy . 
  is it not enough with the y haplogroup study ? 
  [ this one ] ( http://gen3553.pagesperso-orange.fr/adn/europemix.png ) in particular , give details of the r1b types which are much younger than plain haplogroups , and it really does tell a story . 
  you can see that normandy matches with this viking thingy . 
  edit : whelp it does not have the legend in the map . 
  i [ link the page ] ( http://gen3553.pagesperso-orange.fr/adn/r1bsousgroupes.htm ) ( it 's in french ), 
  i ca n't understand how he was n't able to convince europe with those great negotiation skills . 
  look at this guy ; from a pacifist against spain joining nato , to become the secretary general of it , and a head figure in the bombing of yugoslavia , now pushing for a military union of the eu he 's got a taste for the military it seems . 
   that brings the total number of languages to six , with english , french , german , italian , mandarin , and spanish all supported , nearly 30 percent of the world 's native speakers . 
  it 's crazy , they need to add arabic , russian , portuguese and hindi and maybe they get to 50 % with 10 languages . 
  is not because that one guy is not nice , it 's because the law had a flaw , what is not that weird since we were racing for democracy before another happy militar leader think otherwise when it was made . 
  the law was corrected 20 years ago when it was first noticed its flaw ( which is the maximum limit of years you can get for one capital crime its applied to all the crimes not for each one ) you can not say that letting those people out is justice , it 's law , they just get out before their time because a technicality , words on a piece of paper . 
  it 's also worth pointing out that european countries actually comply with echr rulings and spain has freed terrorists , murderers and rapists ( [ some of whom have killed again once free ] ( http://www.elcorreo.com/bizkaia/sociedad/sucesos/201501/11/detenido-matar-mujer-primer-20150110233001.html ) ) because of the echr . 
  what i do n't understand is why are they so hatefull, 
  exactly , there is no reason to look bad because of this . 
  get your quota and watch them march westward . 
  just watch calais . 
  looks like france is not good enough for them , meh . 
  nobody is going to come ; that would make no sense . 
  and spain is not doing it for that either , we are giving dual-citizenship so they do n't have to set a foot in spain in their lives ; we do n't give dual-citizenships at all , they are not expected to come or anything , it 's just a gesture . 
  that 's why i used past sense , the sephardic today are not spanish . 
   i understand their rationale for prefering jews to return but they should not call it ` undoing a historic injustice ' i think you do n't , it 's not because ones were jews and the other muslim , is because ones were spanish and the other arabs ; culturally . 
  maybe because originally muslims were invaders , while jews were just immigrants ( and much older ) just saying . 
  also the jews evicted were culturally spanish ( unlike the muslim who were arabic ) and they maintained part of that culture for centuries in other countries , some of them even the language . 
  i 've watched videos in youtube about ladino ( jewish spanish ) and is actually pretty interesting because it pre dates the big changes in the spanish language due to nebrija , it 's pretty neat . 
  let 's say that in a century a bloodline can spawns 4 generations . 
  in 5 centuries , we will have 20 generations , right ? 
  how many ascendants would a sephard guy today had from the time jews were expulsed from spain : 2 ^ 19 = 524,288 great great ( * 16 ) grandparents . 
  accounting for things that happen 5 centuries ago , when spain was n't even a nation is nuts . 
  and do n't get me wrong , i do n't mind that a handfull of people can get the citenship or whatever , it does n't bother me at all . 
  what irritates me is the notion that we have to account for things that happened here more than 500 hundred years ago in a very different world . 
  hell , if i was at the time myself , i also would have been expulsed or worse . 
  fu manchu ... or at least most of them . 
  i 'm willing to fight , for things with more substance than `` nation '' , i could fight for some of my ideas , for my freedom or for the people i like , and just because you are from my country does not mean i like you automatically . 
  i find `` fighting for your country '' a very shallow and meaningless concept . 
  the links are the least important of what i said ( the first link is a dud because ' ) ' closes de link but the link actually end in ' ) ' ) , what i said is that tolerant islamic spain was n't moorish , and in fact because of that north african people invaded again ( this time another islamic country ) berbers , fatimids , almoravids , almohads or whatever they acted like the radical zealots they 've always been . 
  if islam wants to claim the achievments of the cordoba caliphate ok , but no way moroccan or algerians whom actually destroy it can claim them . 
   but an angry mob is hardly state-sanctioned terror a mob that killed 4000 jews . 
  the biggest slaughter of jews in europe until the holocaust . 
  because a human right that is called `` freedom of religion '' , which should have been `` freedom ** from ** religion '', 
  i guess you are moroccan or algerian or something like that . 
  i read this kind of post from time to time from this people , claiming a history that is not theirs , and that it was n't that cool either . 
  the wort and wrongest part of waht you said is the `` religious tolerance was wide-spread '' , well , not under moorish rule that 's for sure . 
  the one who brought the religious tolerance was abderraman iii who was practically basque and lasted like a century until cordoba was invaded [ once again by north africans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_c%c3%b3rdoba_ ( 1013 ) ) , this time breaking the caliphate , and retook their old ways and [ jew massacres ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1066_granada_massacre ), 
  we were a country to immigrant `` from '' not `` to '' , really . 
  i had a romanian flatmate once , sometimes i asked him to speak in romanian and i did n't understand a word , but then he wrote it down and i could read the sentences . 
  the words are latin but the pronunciation and accent i do n't think so . 
  and btw , the guy was one of the best flatmates i 've ever had ( the flat is owned by my parents so i play landlord while living there at the same time ) very polite , ordered and clean , which if you have ever shared an apartment you know [ that that ] ( http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/3418/how-do-you-handle-that-that-the-double-that-problem ) is worth money . 
   you call 200 people per year one of the main immigration routes ? 
  come on now . 
   [ anyway , back in the real world , no individual has had to change their personal culture because of immigration . 
  `` quatorze personnes hospitalis\u00e9es apr\u00e8s une rixe entre migrants \u00e0 calais '' `` catorce personas hospitalizadas tras una ri\u00f1a entre inmigrantes en calais '' can read , but i ca n't understand it when spoken . 
  so one simple question here . 
  how is possible that `` one direction '' is the 8th more searched in the spanish wikipedia , if it does n't even have a spanish wiki page ? 
  i 've actually never heard about `` one direction '' and there is a lot of fishy stuff like `` second world war '' , or basketball but not football . 
  i do n't know . 
  edit : now that i think about it , i realized that we , spaniards , are a minority in the spanish speaking comunity actually . 
  so who knows, 
   but if the culture is non-eu it suddenly becomes a big deal . 
  actually immigrants from china , south america or black people from the caribbean are not a `` big deal '' here as you are saying and they are non-eu . 
  other cultures on the other hand , just can not function here unless they override some of our values . 
  that 's the thing , the circuit is not in barcelona , and they do n't get a piece of the pie . 
  they get some indirect benefits if people who goes to watch the f1 spends time and money in barcelona or pass the night there . 
  and the subsidy is , i think , to do some remodeling , because the fia can break the contract unilaterally if the circuit does not meet some standards ( that they change every year ) . 
  but that 's the fee , montmel\u00f3 already has a contract until 2019 with the f1 . 
  to formula 1 no , to the formula 1 circuit which is state-owned . 
  i hope this tantrum is about competencies since the generalitat is the one who benefits the most with the circuit , but if she honestly think that cutting down something that makes way way more than it cost , is the right thing to do , i do n't see this `` change '' thing working at all . 
  i 've never bought the `` you were once immigrants and refugees '' retoric . 
  if i 'm in spain and not in venezuela or argentina is precisely because my ascendants were n't refugees ; i know who were all my great grandparents ( i got to know 3 of them alive ) , they all lived and suffered fascist spain ; all of them were republicans or downright communists and almost all were atheist or at least anti-clergy ; so they did n't have it easy as some of them did n't make it through it . 
  so i actually dislike that parallelism which sells my forefathers so cheap . 
  am i against taking refugees ? 
  no , i actually think that we are not doing enough to help them ( talking about spain here ) . 
  but it must be done in a smart way . 
  first you need to prioritize ; help the ones more in need , war refugees , or religious persecuted before economic immigrants . 
  second , the country has to be able to maintain them , give them jobs , give them a future . 
  mind you that they probably wo n't have any usefull skill . 
  and third you ca n't sell your society for that , do n't give up the safety we european countries have ; and be a little loyal to yourself , repect other cultures but if in some points it clashes with your own , do n't accept it , it 's that simple . 
   unless you considered a third of spaniards to fall into that category . 
  it 's going to pass whether i like it or not . 
  i 'm not wasting any siesta time crying for it . 
  `` the people who provide the services '' the `` service '' is outright smuggling , human trafficking and sometimes death . 
  but that 's alright , he did n't see any legal problem there ; he saw it in destroying boats in libya , because libyan sovereignty . 
  as if libya still exists , for those of you who do n't know , gadafi is dead , but the civil war is not over , and there is new players in it . 
  i like assange work , i agree with his fight , let people know what governments actually do , but i do n't want his opinion to dress up that information . 
  funny enough , penelope cruz does the same character in the american version , vanilla sky . 
  i like the two first films from amenabar , `` abre los ojos '' and `` tesis '' ( about snuff films ) they were one of the first spanish movies i saw that were n't social protest or comedy . 
  let 's see if he makes a comeback with the new one with ethan hawke and emma watson,
