   it seems like he 's done them on everything oh no , no , no . 
  it 's usually about the same thing , in spain we call his films almodovar-movies as if they were a whole genre . 
  i remember when i was going to watch `` the skin i live in '' and i thought wow this is very non-almodovar ; then about half the film , `` nope , its the same fucking thing , goddamit almodovar you tricked me again . '', 
  `` xylella fastidiosa '' is n't less stupid to be honest , i almost prefer ` olive ebola ' , such a clowny name ; who names things nowdays ? 
  and nobody will be able to make a majority coalition ( it will need to mash up both right with left and anti-independence with nationalists , both ) i do n't know if it 's different in catalunya but in the rest of spain if there is no majority , the first name in the wining list is automatically the mayor , in this case ada colau . 
  i actually like ours , the german one and the one from the uk and all of them got nill . 
  i think the swedish one was bland as fuck and a lot of shitty ballads got voted up too much . 
  not even the banter was good , which is the soley reason i watch this , i think i wo n't next year in fact . 
  edit : i also enjoy latvia weird thingy too, 
   if my aunt had balls she 'd be my uncle hey , we too have that one , even though the most common one i 've heard is : `` y si mi abuela tuviera ruedas seria una bicicleta '' `` and if my grandma had wheels she 'd be a bicycle '', 
  my point is about the `` spanish justice works '' and yadda yadda . 
  not defending the local police which i will always say that it is detrimental , corrupt and just bad , incompetent , i had problems before and i had to call the national police even though the local police is one street away from my home . 
  pardons are political yet again , but if it makes you feel better , know that in spain pardons are given when there is a year or so left from the original sentence . 
  it 's not a get out of jail free card . 
  spanish justice works just fine , slow yes , but the procedures are good . 
  and even if you were to have bad luck to find a douchebag judge that screw you , you can ask for various appeals . 
  now if you do n't like the laws that 's another thing entirely . 
  you have what you voted for . 
   the detainee could sue the policeman , but the policeman would get just a mini-spanking and a message from the judge : `` do n't get caught again , you idiot '' . 
  this is from 2011 , the video is out now because they are in trial . 
  they are asking for 4 years for the kicking police and 1 for the guys watching . 
  `` polic\u00eda local '' no falla, 
  yes , just so this question is n't asked anymore in the sub . 
  but spain is saying two things , i just read it in the spanish news that the actual quotas are not going to be enough for what it 's coming , and that spain should n't take as many because ... you know ... we have a 25 % unemployment maybe ? 
  we are not going to give them work , we do n't have it for ourselves . 
  and as for myself i think the same thing , i can give up some of my economical comfort for humanitarian reasons , what i do n't want to give up is security and social cohesion . 
  and a great influx in a country with a high immigrant per capita and very little job expectations does not seem like a great idea . 
  also that these people are n't coming to spain anyway their sight are upon more richer countries . 
  edit : editing shit , my english is getting even worse these days , i 'm going to stop for a while, 
   one of the most significant things it points out is a complete lack of understanding and reference to muslims within the west , by designating them as belonging to a monolithic ` muslim community ' without potentially considering the multifaceted aspects of muslims , both of internal divisions and of individuals . 
  you surely are n't suggesting that we have to learn about those people magical believes and their magical god people with their magical laws for each and every magical sect . 
  because as an ahteist i can tell you this , fuck that !, 
  it 's funny that they put almeria white like in satellite photos, 
   such an approach is inconsistent with the very notion of fundamental human rights , in which every human being has basic minimum rights . 
  why lie ? 
  its obviously not incosistent , why put a useless lie in an article to dirty the rest of what it 's saying . 
  hardly , but from the start of this year we are having those anti-social threads in this sub against anything perceived as `` sjw '' ( god , i hate that term ) . 
  does somebody care what a random person with a title we do n't know waht it means twits ? 
  angry people is more bold to promulgate their ideas nowdays , it seems they get more support lately . 
  i blame charlie hebdo shootings , but i could be wrong . 
  i may had exaggerate , i tend to do it when someone is way taller than me i 'm 1 '91 and it looked gigantic to me . 
  the thing about him that really shocked me and made me still remember him it was n't the height but his expression ; that grin of superiority when everyone there stared at him ; i did n't even checked out the grills with him . 
  [ something like the older guy here ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gn5uaeltrog/uhdvexd4dgi/aaaaaaaaivu/wmf3hsfmqsg/s1600/debate1.png ) while walking through the terminal, 
  atheist guy asks for visa in sweden ( not asylum ) gets denied , unsurprisingly gets murdered being in a muslim country , somehow sweden is blamed . 
   they were not all fat the first thing i saw right off the plane in chicago was 3 immensely fat women in one of those motorized wheelchairs , and a 2 ' 10m tall pilot with a chiseled chin between two hot fly attendants with a smug face . 
  no mistake , you are in murica !, 
  also a black guy make fun of me because one of my bags was half purple . 
  `` that is a nice pink color bag you had there '' the very first words a native english speaker ever said to me . 
  edit : i found one very similar , [ i literally see no problem with this ] ( http://hbm.hk/images/schoolbags/2.jpg ), 
  really ? 
  my bad then . 
  when i saw the stats it really looked that conservatives + dup+ukip where really ahead ; i must have overlooked the rest of the votes since i only look snp labor and greens . 
  as fucked up as the electoral system is ( at least imo ) , one thing is clear ; by votes the right wingers won easily these elections . 
  edit : looks like i 'm wrong and it was actually close . 
  deluded ? 
  you have to admit that from a starter standpoint is easier , with simple conjugations and no gender , no declinations ; you can start making sense of the language pretty soon , which is nice . 
  spelling though ... 
   i expect that he 's referring to the fact that the haitian half is african-dominant not really , from the wikis you posted i was refering to :  dessalines was proclaimed `` emperor for life '' by his troops . 
  [ 52 ] dessalines at first offered protection to the white planters and others ; [ 53 ] but once in power , he ordered the massacre of most whites , without regard to age or gender . 
  [ 54 ] in the continuing competition for power , he was assassinated by rivals on 17 october 1806 . 
  [ 10 ] this :  boyer passed the code rural , which denied peasant laborers the right to leave the land , enter the towns , or start farms or shops of their own . 
  ( i also learned that they had to met a production quota so basically feudalism but i can find a source on that so discard it if you want ) and this from the dominican one :  threatening the nation 's independence were renewed haitian invasions occurring in 1844 , 1845 -- 49 , 1849 -- 55 , and 1855 -- 56 . 
  it 's true though , did you see how fast this guy called me a racist ? 
  like it 's nothing , well then maybe it 's nothing . 
  but it really drains any willingness for me to discuss . 
  i did n't even mention anything about race , and if genocide , ethnic cleansing , feudalism and invasions of other countries ( not even war ) ala isis style is not acting like savages i do n't know what it is . 
  would i have been called a racist if i say that isis are acting like savages too ? 
  the debt is overplayed , it was cut about a half by the french and it 's not the same having a debt that you have to pay in at most 10 years , than pay it in 40 when you have double your population . 
  also the dominican republic paid 20 years of that debt anyway . 
   calling people savages ? 
  you 're totally not a ** racist ** i was going to answer you , but whenever i heard a buzzword i lost interest . 
  `` comedian '' `` popular '' is he completly german , can we put more things between quotes ? 
  it does more good than harm in my opinion . 
  but it 's true , there is two themes that my flair triggers , separatist movements and colonialism the first , people will asume i 'm against independence , and if in one case i am actually against , my opinion is disregarded because spain . 
  the second one is that i can not criticize anything about colonialism , native americans and such because `` but you were so much worse '' , me ? 
  what ? 
  not really , usually for most of us there is no party that we can agree 100 % you vote the party that it 's closer to your convictions/believes , if voting the closest party to your ideas its basically uncounted , like it 's the case , the most sensible option it 's to vote the next one that have a chance . 
  i mean , you wo n't change anything voting ukip , but it may if you vote for laborist or tories , do n't you have a preference ? 
  last elections : ** national parties ** ** pp ** - 58k votes per seat ** psoe ** - 63k votes per seat ** iu ** - 153k votes per seat ** upyd ** - 228k votes per seat ** regional parties ** ** ciu ** - 63k votes per seat ** amaiur ** - 47k votes per seat ** pnv ** - 64k votes per seat ** erc ** - 85k votes per seat it 's all about how much people can you get to vote in a region the more they vote for you the cheaper the seat is . 
  in that regional parties have it easier . 
  scottish national party - 1,454,436 votes - 56 seats ukip -3,736,717 votes - 1 seat . 
  i know , i know . 
  it happens exactly the same thing here too ; but my god , voting for ukip is literally throwing away your vote . 
  i do not agree with what you have to say , but i shall defend with an upvote your right to say it . 
  i 'm surprised that this surprised you, 
  is that march supossed to make people less islamophobic ? 
  i think i have n't read so many falacies since i stopped reading conspiracy blogs . 
  it does n't matter the definition , a language it 's defined by how it is used , not what a dictionary says . 
  at the end of the day , terrorist will be anyone that uses violence who is n't us . 
  waste of a word if you ask me ; i do n't use it either . 
  you have a long post there , but this is very simple ; he is running a business and if he keeps playing the no generalization thing and yadda yadda , he will lose his clientele . 
  i 've seen that phenomem here in spain with romanians , romanians !, 
  not even talking about muslims or africans . 
  a group of them start to frequent the same pub , the spaniards move out and stop going there . 
  i 've seen that a lot in my hometown back in the day , right now there are romanian pubs and spanish ones . 
  i agree , `` false flag '' and `` occupied '' seems the best . 
  then again i love the fictional geopolitic theme . 
  by the newly definitions of the word `` racism/racist '' i think you are right . 
  then again i do n't care about that anymore . 
  how would you phrase what juncker wanted to say and not be racist .
