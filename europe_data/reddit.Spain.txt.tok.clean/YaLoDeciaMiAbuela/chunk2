  the joke goes `` los andaluces duermen 8 horas diarias ... y 8 nocturnas '' , so yeah i changed andalusians for spaniards . 
   educated latin american spanish sounds better than educated european spanish . 
  uneducated manchego is best spanish can you see my indignation from where you are ? 
  i like colombian and i can tolerate cuban , that 's about it . 
  everytime i hear `` el dise '' i cringe ... 
  i mean , i barely tolerate andalusian . 
  blame the users , blame the hackers , as long as nobody says anything about the security faults of the cloud everything is fine . 
  have you heard the : `` the spaniards sleep 8 hours daily ... and another 8 nocturnal '' i 'm not sure if daily works the same in english though . 
  letting spain do something apart from the drone hood is asking for disaster , and even that it 's risky . 
  in a more serious note , before i enter the thread i expect spain to be doing something about radars and comunications . 
  i know that our military is focused on that ; not disappointed, 
  i always find weird how latin americans banter with this nonesense . 
  it makes no sense since the 's ' is pronounce perfectly fine . 
  what always gets me is a briton telling me it 's a lisp . 
  the fuck !, 
  you have a similar sound , imagine if the americans tell you that the correct way to say `` think '' is `` sink '' , or `` katherine '' is `` kasserine '' and you are lisping . 
  `` i sink kasserine srew a sermonuclear bomb !! '', 
  tell me you wo n't rage . 
  i 'm actually impressed by the quality of the photos . 
  i have photos of the same places and they do n't look half as good as yours . 
  how to piss off any european call football soccer . 
   the best way to piss off a romanian is to act like you do n't know the difference between roma and romanian , for sure , but they ca n't say that in an article . 
   insist that the spanish spoken in latin america is much better . 
  if you say mexican instead of latin american , and call our pronunciation a lisp , you will get maximum rage , it will work on me . 
   ask them why they are such a lazy nation . 
  meh , i mean i 'm proud to be a lazy fuck , but i 'm the laziest person i know so maybe other spaniards will be pissed off by this , not me though . 
  i would advice you not to take to heart any of what redditors say , they act like they know everything when the economists still argue about what will happen . 
  economy is not a science but a religion because it 's based on faith , not only in numbers . 
   but i guess even his voters did n't believe he 'd risk going to prison for this . 
  exactly this . 
  this is as far as he goes , which is understandable i would n't even be mad at him . 
  if you want to fight farther you need another one . 
  i do n't even know why they put that section . 
  there are several ones , and none can be qualified as the most common one , i guess that happens with other languages ; also depending of the type of surprise you will use different ones . 
  in the end i 'm mad that there is n't much spanish , we could have so many memes ; ayy , mother of god , etc. . . :| wasted chance . 
  i did have lybia in my list , but since nato followed the us as their lapdog i delete it , but it 's the same : - iraq started selling oil for euros , got demolished by the most retarded reasons ever . 
  of course first bill under us ocupation start selling oil for dollars again . 
  - iran does not sell oil for euros , enemy number one . 
  - gadafi wanted to sell oil for gold and end up with a stick in its butt , literally . 
  - syria does not sell oil in dollars , enemy number two ; go fund their terrorist , now it backfired . 
  so the mayority of nato countries do n't care about that , and i do n't think is necesary for us to spend more than we are already spending , i would change the otan for an european self defense anyday . 
  of course france and the uk who still have overseas interests wo n't want that , understandably ; it 've never been about defense . 
   spanish downvotes . 
  awesome , victimism and blaming the spaniards . 
  there are plenty of other catalan independentists like sugusino that receive upvotes for their reasonable opinions . 
  as it is , people from r/europe are very pro-independence even some of us , spaniards . 
  the difference is that they are not propagandists like you , that only write to encourage blindly everything that supports independentism or to bash spain . 
  i 've been offended by you several times because the shit you say about spain , even though i support the consult and the independence if the mayority want it ; and other redditors have downvoted you for that , not only spaniards . 
  let them , as long as you do n't read them it 's ok . 
  i 've gotten emails late-night ( like 2:00 am or so ) even on sundays from one of my many bosses asking the reasons for the casual decisions i have to make everyday . 
  it 's more like they are trying to prove something and asserting their authority than caring from work . 
  only that it 's % gdp based , and it 's going down not up . 
  but really , there is no burden , countries spend what they think they need for themselves , nobody thinks about the 2 % nor the one that spend 0.5 % nor the one that spend 5 % do n't let them think they are doing you a favor for spending billions on attacking iraq or syria for their own purposes . 
  does this correlate with population density ? 
  it looks like it . 
  by median salary which is [ my favorite ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_median_wage ) , not that far from us , italy is a good leap though . 
  [ el milagro de p.tinto ] ( http://blogs.estrellagalicia.es/rickydepor/files/2014/07/el-milagro-de-p.-tinto.jpg ) it 's a dumb comedy , that at some point you realize it 's actually witty ; all the lame jokes thrown at first get brought back through the film and have an actual impact on the outcome ... it 's weird but it 's my favorite movie , not only the spanish one . 
  [ i 'm weird like that . 
  ] ( http://www.otraparte.org/actividades/cine/img-cine/milagro-p-tinto-4.jpg ) fun thing i know , is that director of the film , fesser , is a guy who only wants ugly people for his films ( at least the comedy ones ) and i actually know a guy ( super ugly , but kinda of intelligent ) who met fesser and was aked to joined his next film , ( at that time was mortadelo y filemon ) he thought about it but he said no . 
  beer in bars , wine while eating , and rum or whiskey ( mostly ) in pubs/botellon . 
  pretty straight forward , we do n't drink that much either -  [ map totally stolen from someone up there ] ( http://i.imgur.com/o0weqte.jpg ), 
  i think it 's not [ morocco ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1814255/thumbs/o-apellidos-ms-frecuentes-espaa-900.jpg ), 
  just because those kids have been born and lived in germany , does not mean they are or feel german . 
  they live apart from german society , they made friends with their own people and not care about anything of their host country . 
  it 's easy to recruit people without roots , just explain them that they would be part of something important that they can relate to and human nature will do the rest . 
  i know i would , i do n't understand why is it so hard for you to understand this . 
  i get the joke , but they are in the book because they were popular names to begin with . 
  upvoted anyway . 
  i prefer the khaleesis over our new shakiras . 
  anyway , i do n't see any problems with that , much better than more traditional names like dolores ( pains ) soledad ( loneliness ) , angustias ( anguish ) , martirio ( torment ) or olvido ( forget or oblivion not sure ) ; and if you are wondering , yes , they are commonly enough . 
  in spain is ladislao , it 's an old man 's name really , you wo n't meet any ladislao below 60 or 70 and in remote villages . 
  i 'm pretty sure the most common male name in spain for newborns is daniel . 
  maybe because they split catalunya and euskadi from the rest of spain it disrupt it . 
  and that label is probably not about morocco but spanish ceuta and melilla . 
  `` we can '' sometimes i remind that they are not called pablemos . 
  exactly , unless i fear for my life , i would visit any country no problem . 
  agnostic and persian ... 
  sorry but the problem is with religious sunnis , you ca n't relate to that . 
  too big , too different , buffer zone , problems with other members , not in europe , south east is like another country , muslim . 
  i think that turkey should enjoy some preferential treatment , but a full member ... 
  i do n't see it ; we are very mixed and far apart as we are right now to add another new fucking level . 
  all cultures are valid and respectable come to europe !, 
  we accept all cultures and religions !, 
  wait , what you are doing is not acceptable let me teach you about your culture the retoric is getting dumber by the day . 
  what we are seeing right now with the popularity of isis is the fail of multi-culturalism , we are seeing not just immigrants , but their european born sons turn down any western value and go back to their actual [ ethnicity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_group ) ; they were never british/french/german as we were force to believe . 
  i 'm getting tired of this `` brainwashed '' thing . 
  they are not brainwashed can you people accept that already ? 
  definitely cuba , it 's the only one that was n't considered one . 
  it has to be an ex-colony not an actual one, 
  because that would make people think . 
  think about the other islamists in our countries . 
  that 's why the media always say that all this people are brainwashed , radicalised or groomed by terrorisst . 
  yeah right ... 
  there is no `` most credible '' source here . 
  you can believe the government that is pushing for independence or the one that not . 
  and we are talking about a difference of 470k to 1800k ; obviously i do n't belive either of them , and i think with a referendum you wo n't need this absurd counting people . 
  i prefer not to talk about places i have n't really lived there so between chinon ( france ) when i did a student interchange in highschool and erasmus in berlin , i will go with chinon by a mile . 
  but i guess italy or portugal will fell more at home but i can only guess . 
  two color is better , but you put white too [ three colour ] ( http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/022/9/d/stock_gradient_red_white_blue_by_einstud-d37sihg.jpg ) [ two colour ] ( http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/022/a/8/stock_gradient_red_blue_by_einstud-d37scl4.jpg ),
