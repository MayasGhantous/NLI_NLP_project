  camarada was used a lot in the spanish tercios in the xvi century as divisions for example , it 's funny that of today spaniards think that that word is from german or soviet origin :p, 
  yeah , the whole 5 of them that knows english and use reddit . 
  come on now . 
  to be honest `` hermandad '' ( brotherhood in spanish ) is genderless . 
  but i think this is called `` cofradia '' , translator says `` brotherhood '' , `` guild '' , `` fraternity '' i guess it should be guild ? 
  i mean usually in games the `` thieves guild '' is translated as `` cofradia de ladrones '', 
  while it 's true that i do n't like cold , and winter is my least favorite season , i 'm pretty sure i can get by that , and we all know that northern countries have lots of advantages . 
  but the problem is that i 'm not happy if i do n't talk spanish ; i do n't think i can express myself as who i really am if not in spanish and get burnout fast , it was one of my main problems when i did erasmus in berlin , that and the rain , the fucking rain . 
  yeah we have `` chivo expiatorio '' too which is scape goat ( well literally is `` atoning baby goat '' as `` atone for your sins '' so basically `` goat baby jesus '' ) but we use turk 's head like 90 % of the time . 
  you mean apart from `` scapegoat '' being `` cabeza de turco '' , `` turk 's head '' in spain ? 
  we used to have `` judeomasones '' ( jew free masons ) in dictatorship times , and without sarcasm which is even worse . 
  no , not as big and pretty as `` cerezos '' . 
  it 's like [ these ones ] ( http://miradordepozuelo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/dsc00839.jpg ) , you can see the before and after . 
  they bloom practically overnight , and after a week the pink flowers fall , and they only have the dark red color of the leafs . 
  the ones in my street bloomed early march , it 's never that soon it 's usually about now really but they are all dark red now . 
  to me spring starts when the pink flower trees on my street blooms ( i do n't know the name of the trees ) , they last a week before falling off leaving only some garnet colour leafs , this was like a month ago so to me it 's almost summer now . 
  we know , but we like the joke, 
  i guess france or italy , maybe argentina also , just not portugal . 
  some may be wondering , any northern country ? 
  nope , i censure any country where it 's acceptable to eat while walking . 
  and murder, 
  [ ** highest healthy life expectancy ** ] ( http://www.scotpho.org.uk/population-dynamics/healthy-life-expectancy/key-points ) there is a new stat everyday . 
  no , he is not . 
  we have 4, 
  humans are born with trousers , it is known, 
  and getting closer , one of my coworkers is saying that he knows one of them . 
  he is telling us that lately he is being getting into fights and shit . 
  and where does that road pass through , iran ? 
  more people than russia in the same space of greece, 
  it reminds me of the tv program about alcohol and driving . 
  they stopped a visible drunk maghrebi . 
  - `` i have n't drink , i 'm a muslim '' - `` ok , then let 's do a drug test too '', 
   oliven\u00e7a you mean the other way around ? 
  if it were portuguese it would look like [ an exclave ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9pqj4athtyo/tdoxa8fqtxi/aaaaaaaab-a/hqvumgtckis/s1600/olivenza_map.jpg ) . 
  at least war between european countries, 
  to relax ? 
  i do n't know about portugal but we have a russian town in alicante , and every summer there is a police raid to arrest some mafiosi . 
  in fact , i think spain arrested some corrupt ukranian politician just there last week . 
  fighting social injustice with legal injustice . 
  3/11 for me but the questions about `` too much control over ... '' are so ambigous , subjective and stupid , perfect bait . 
  i do n't agree , it 's not that the government it 's islamic , it was n't some years ago , it 's been the other way around , the government change because the population demanded . 
  i enter the thread because i was triggered by the term `` asian gangs '', 
  because i follow international news enough to understand that if putin had a rival with options , i would have heard the shit out of it . 
  that 's why i asserted my ignorance and proyect it to other people who also have n't heard of him to see if they get/got to the same conclusion as i did . 
  recently ? 
  we 've been doing civil wars sine celtiberan times where the national sport was tribal raiding . 
  - we had civil wars as rome ; i like this emperor better than this other one let 's kill ourselves here about it . 
  - as visigoths , is god singular ? 
  or a trinity ? 
  let 's talk this calmly over a nice civil war also about two thirds visigoths kings were killed . 
  - as muslims , who are better muslims , arabs or berbers , only war could answer this . 
  - what 's reconquista ? 
  civil wars inside a civil war inside a religous civil war . 
  civil warception . 
  - as spanish empire , rebellion at every and each one of the king 's decision , i do n't want to go fight in italy , rebellion !, 
  i do n't want to go fight the netherland , rebellion !, 
  i do n't like the accent of the king , rebellion !, 
  - spanish succesion war , nuff said . 
  - as napoleonic spain , let 's follow napoleon , he is the best , so modern !, 
  but he is a foreigner , i will war you to put the worst king in spain history . 
  - should a woman inherit the throne ? 
  let 's have 3 carlist civil wars over the century to discuss this . 
  i mean , we had a terrorist group until very recently , let 's just not focus on the last civil war , this is tradition . 
  it depends in the humidity , 30\u00bac in spain is ok . just avoid direct contact with the sun , he is a douche . 
  pink -  yellow -  greens -  purple -  red bonkers !, 
  some numbers would be good to make an opinion , sadly there is none . 
  as far as my country is concerned , even if we only spend 1 cent our contribution is still net positive . 
  we gain absolutely nothing from nato . 
  so about the 2 % ; pass ... 
  i should also add that other countries , who are more threatened or seek to more influence in world politics should spend accordingly . 
  i 'm at a point that i care very little about muslim countries . 
  it 's not fixable , let them do whatever they want just do n't bring their problems . 
  there is plenty of trouble ridden countries in south america or south east asia and such with better chances to make it to a good spot and contribute to the world . 
  let 's forget about muslims already . 
  not worth it . 
  i still think it 's better to declare islam a sect , and apply current law . 
  so on top of my head and checking the wikipedia for the names ; since xvi century : [ revolt of the comuneros ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolt_of_the_comuneros ) and [ revolt of the brotherhoods ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolt_of_the_brotherhoods ) also called ** germanias ** : about the same time and against the new king charles v. [ rebellion of the alpujarras ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/rebeli%c3%b3n_de_las_alpujarras ) war with the muslims left in spain with genocide and enslavement included . 
  [ catalan revolt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_revolt ) - that will end up losing part of catalunya to the french forever . 
  [ war of the spanish succession ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_the_spanish_succession ) - the disaster , an european war where whoever win , we still lose . 
  [ peninsular war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peninsular_war ) - we call it independece war so people forget that spaniards , usually the smart ones , fight alongside napoleon too . 
  [ hundred thousand sons of saint louis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hundred_thousand_sons_of_saint_louis ) - the worst king in spanish history , ask for help from the english and french to crush the constitutional monarchy and make it an absolutist one again . 
  [ carlist wars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carlist_wars ) - three of them , each one even more absurd . 
  [ cantonal revolution ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/rebeli%c3%b3n_cantonal ) - my personal favorite , in which cities and regions declared themeselves independent with the highlight of the city of cartagena declaring war to madrid and prussia !!!!, 
  [ spanish civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_civil_war ) - almost a century ago but still going in our hearts . 
  those that i remember , and i 'm not counting succesfull independence wars , independence from us , the american ones , portugal or even all those dutch-flemish wars . 
  and all those change of governments , two coup d'etat , two republics , random italian king . 
  not enough bullets for all the firing squads we use . 
  what i mean is that we , spaniards , fight more inside our borders , than outside them . 
  my country is the civil war capital of the world . 
  i put this because it 's in english , the spanish ones are not different . 
  there is one from my home town that it 's the most infuriating thing you will ever hear if you understand what they are saying . 
  they are interviewed by a very left-wing daily . 
  [ here it is ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsz_i6s2tio ) but the highlight its all the bitching and asking for more money and stuff . 
  `` we are people , they have to give us a payout and that 's it '' `` we live like rats , they have to give us a house and that 's it '' the `` y ya esta '' = `` and that 's it '' gets me on my nerves , like nothing else in this world . 
  [ gypsy slum in spain ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lygemtajiq8 ), 
  one of the few conspiracies i really believe , and gets me angry every time i hear about it . 
  it 's all because the subsidized agriculture , if you want to know why those countries exactly . 
  i sometimes hear `` chequia '' in spanish but i always thought that it was just lazy speak . 
  we do that a lot though . 
  i mean both , calling ambassadors and posturing .
