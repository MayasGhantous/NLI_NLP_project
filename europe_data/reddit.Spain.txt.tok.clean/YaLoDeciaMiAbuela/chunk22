  its just not possible . 
  i see no failure nor fault . 
  what you can not expect is to have people in prison without trial . 
  cant hear the king 's discourse without thinking about [ this anymore ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiajupzltzo#t=04m20s ), 
  grey for english is a bad decision since it 's the language that you could see more in other countries . 
  kind of hard to notice how much each country tweets in english, 
  you got it backwards , in spain we call it castellano ( for the most part ) latin american countries are the one that only call it spanish , except argentina and some others . 
  i will definetly watch it later , well ` hear it ' actually . 
  i do n't care about tommy robinson , but let 's see where dave rubin stands , he is usually on the sane left i also consider myself in . 
  so i want to see him in a less comfortable position . 
  i came to give my condolonces but after reading this douche quote in the first comment i lost interest . 
  ugh celebrities . 
   the open vowels ( like in portuguese and catalan ) were suppressed on porpoise !, 
  best decision ever . 
  the ` f ' sound was written ` ph ' . 
  so in old lazy spanish they decide to only use ` h ' as the ` f ' sound , then when all the sounds and letters were reorganized in the xv century people kept writing the words as they were and changed the way the pronounce it . 
  have you seen people with last name fern\u00e1ndez or hern\u00e1ndez is actually the same one . 
  and the same with the ` x ' ` l' and 'll ' . 
  reorganization and you have alexanders as alejandros , mexico is pronounce mejico and so on . 
   i do n't understand why this is n't higher up and why this appears to be controversial . 
  -  this is the only debate i 've seen so far that covers a wide spectrum of viewpoints without both sides extremes shouting down the moderates . 
  you just answer yourself . 
  well i have n't eaten breakfast since high school , but back then i ate biscuits and different kinds of muffins?cakes ? 
  : [ magdalena ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/madeleines_de_commercy.jpg ) [ sobao ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sobao ) . 
  there were cereals , and try it some times but i do n't think it was a thing , at least not from where i 'm from . 
  maybe it 's not important to you , but he was actually recognised by two of the victims and a witness . 
  just saying , because i see people talking about him like he is completly innocent or something . 
  i asked because here in spain we call catalans poles and catalonia poland . 
   please sit down a pole and tell him he 's practically a catalan . 
  is this random or on purpose ? 
  i only want to say that anthropology is not a science . 
  that does n't mean it 's without value though . 
  the jail is basically for the `` gora alka-eta '' part which i still do n't understand the context . 
  so yeah , i do n't get why they are in jail , but hijacking a child show with your edgy shit , does n't win you any sympathy from me . 
  so i hope everything is resolved smoothly but forgive me if i dont give a crap . 
  it 's this year popular disease . 
  i 'm ok with cl\u00ednex . 
  i mean , jeans and home run are useless words in spanish , whiskey as whisky is very minor . 
  but kleenex is used and i refuse to write kleenex and pronounce kl\u00ednex , sorry but that does not comply with our rules , so or we pronounce like it writes , as we do in wifi , or we change the writing . 
  bacal\u00e1 , now let 's find the `` funny '' guy who cause the alarm, 
  ok , but i do n't think spain should waste a single $ on this . 
  if france and portugal want to control borders again suit themselves , but we do n't need to . 
  patriotism in spain has only be used to do [ this ] ( http://www.unizar.es/departamentos/filologia_inglesa/garciala/images/fusilamiento.jpg ) to other spaniards . 
  so i will pass . 
  as a leftist myself , if that 's their solution i prefer the neo-nazi groups roaming around , tbh . 
  i did erasmus , and i quit within a week . 
  so it 's not an experience for `` everyone '' . 
  it 's mythified because it 's used by students to take a vacation , stop studying and party only . 
  but i could do that anyway and better without leaving the country . 
  i 'm not saying it 's bad or anything , it 's just that its not an automatic good experience , it can be a bad or in my case a shallow one ;, 
  while i agree to make the visit as smooth as possible , this is stupid . 
  another bad decision in a long streak of bad decisions . 
  wow , now i do n't know who to belive , [ nasa ] ( http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/ ) or reddit user u/paulusmagintie . 
  what a dilemma !, 
  i was offended at first but after reading your experiences i can see those things happening and i totally understand you . 
  i 'm still glad that my people ca n't speak english though . 
  imf did n't involve themselves in the las bail-out , right ? 
  so it 's not today 's refugees but yesterday 's refugees . 
  ok then . 
  crisis started in 2008 , it 's fucking 2016 . 
  and this is the first time we did n't destroy jobs . 
  so it 's not like we have recuperate , it 's that we stopped free falling . 
  now . 
  for the first time . 
  and btw , i do n't blame the germans , at all . 
  spanish ruling class choose austerity ; and those are the ones i held responsible , do n't care about germans . 
  i do n't understand why this was n't a thing on the news . 
  one fucking thousand people doing this stuff . 
  i really do n't understand . 
   so we let violent , mentally unstable europeans first they are not european and second they are not `` mentally unstable '' , it 's perfectly logical what they are doing if those believes . 
  if only we had a film about the civil war ; _ ;, 
  so , on what is it built exactly ? 
  hearing may not seem like it , but writen it 's pretty clear is romance . 
  i would guess that each home in spain , changes the main dish every christmas . 
  whay i 'm sure is , but the time of the main dish we are all stuffed already with the starters . 
  jam\u00f3n iberico and seafood galore . 
  they will form it though , but in spain there will be new elections . 
  2 months without president . 
  and at the end to avoid new elections , psoe absteins . 
  i can spoil you the new star wars film too if you want . 
  when i hear greek , i can make the words , i could write them down ( with spanish phonetics ofc ) even though i do n't know what they mean . 
  it 's weird , because i ca n't do that with portuguese for example . 
  the only languages i could be somewhat able to do that is greek , italian and catalan . 
  that 's a hard andalusian accent with a funny voice . 
  it 's not only that it sounds different , i do n't understand what he is saying half of the time . 
  `` hey let 's see these 40 new posts in the thread '' nationalistic crap all over the place , `` nice !! '', 
  maajid nawaz is making a killing with all the muslim drama . 
  did n't know he existed 3 weeks ago , now i 've read more articles and more interviews than any other muslim guy in my life . 
  in spanish , at least , `` des - '' gives more of a sense of `` devoid '' `` without '' or even `` take out '' . 
  jack the ripper in spanish is jack el ** des ** tripador ( literally `` take guts out '' ) or shredder is ** des ** pedazador ( `` take pieces out ) actually i just search [ ** desrazonable ** and it exsits in spanish ] ( http://buscon.rae.es/drae/srv/search?val=desrazonable ) . 
  means `` out of reason '' . 
  never heard that word before though . 
  edit : for more trivia , i guess we change the nickname of `` the ripper '' because literally it would be `` desgarrador '' but we use that term for sad things about love and stuff , so it would sound like `` jack the heartbreaker '' or heartbroken . 
  it 's even worse thatn i thought, 
  one of my favorite words in my language is `` culebr\u00f3n '' it literally means `` big snake '' but it 's actually a cheeky slang for soap opera . 
  it 's soooooo satisfiying when someone is telling you a long and messy story and you can stop that by just saying `` culebr\u00f3n ! '' . 
  now it 's mostly used in sport press . 
  anyone ? 
  i know , that 's why i used the term `` trasfondo '' ( background in english if i 'm not mistaken ) for this reason . 
  the fact that they celebrate christmas without any actual or historical christian background is already alien enough .
