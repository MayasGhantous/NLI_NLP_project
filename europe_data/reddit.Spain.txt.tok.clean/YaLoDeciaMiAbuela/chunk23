  street names . 
  every time there is party shift in government , street names will be changed . 
  that guy was a communist take it down , that other guy was fascist take it down too ; let 's make a street named `` diversity '' ; i want to reinforce the image of my virgin/saint/patron put her/his name on that plaza . 
  and etc etc etc. 
  that 's absurd . 
  tourist are one thing , and retirees another . 
  pensioners do n't pay taxes and they do n't spend much . 
  just buy houses which is more of a problem for the average spaniard because they rise housing prices on the coast . 
  i must add that i do n't think spain has any interest on booting them , so as long as we are getting a symetrical agreement i do n't think there 'll be much of a problem with this . 
  sometimes they call themselves `` cal\u00e9 '' here . 
  but actually they came to spain in 1415 , so that 's 600 years , at the time the emirate of granada still existed . 
  the whole point of gypsy culture is to not integrate ; they 've been here more than 500 centuries and they are still the same . 
  we had more luck hispanicizing america than the gypsys next door . 
  we only call them gypsys , so , can we send our own breed to egypt then ? 
  me too , i enter the thread to know about these antibiotics used on plants . 
   have the spaniards paid for it or have they exchanged it for something ? 
  for christianity ofc . 
  are you puting a price on baby jesus ? 
  and the polarization of society keeps it course ; now normal people think it 's ok to vote far right , sad but understandable . 
  this is what happens when politicians ignore what the people really want and care and keep waving old slogans . 
  the irresponsibility from the ruler class is going to put us in even more problems . 
  upvote for visibility, 
  nah , while the king was away ( sucking napoleon 's dick in france ) the people that was fighting for him against the french made the first constitution ( even representatives from the american colonies came to war-torn mainland to make it ) , you know , to do what the french did but without becoming french . 
  so when napoleon eventually fucked up and lost , he returned us the king ( seriously france , fuck you ) and he was made to swear the constitution , he did n't take that too well . 
  so when he restored absolutism again with the help of [ france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hundred_thousand_sons_of_saint_louis ) , he executed all of the people he could get his hands on that supported the constitution , including `` el empecinado '' but then again , we are talking about the indisputably worst king of spain ever . 
  [ ferdinand vii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferdinand_vii_of_spain ) made the xix century spain a battlefield ; even in his death he gift us with a civil war that repeat itself 3 times . 
  i like [ el empecinado ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/juan_mart%c3%adn_d%c3%adez ) ( the stubborn one ? 
  the relentless one ? 
  something like that ) because of him guerrilla warfare is overall known with the spanish word ( which it just means `` little war '' ) . 
  he fight against napoleonic france to put the `` legitimate '' king back . 
  too bad that king came out to be the worst king in spanish history and the first thing he did after getting back was to execute him . 
  spain in a nutshell , each and every great hero/personality of spain , end up antagonized by the government ; that 's how you know you 've done good . 
  viriato ? 
  really ? 
  if an average portuguese today were to talk to him he would put an axe though his skull the moment he hear portuguese . 
  fucking nationalism mate , to glorify someone who has no portuguese culture , probably not even born in portugal , just because he fight against rome with a bunch of farmers in a place that romans called lusitania . 
  that 's grasping . 
   so we 'll see soon enough if you guys `` bend over '' for us once again . 
  i still remember the swiss referendum and the lot of treaties the eu would cancel if they vote yes , they did anyway and what happened was : ** wow i ` ts fucking nothing \u2122 **, 
  oh i did n't know about r/politics , i take a look and looks like a place i can keep up with what donald trump will say next . 
  i find him so entertaining . 
  fucked up badly with unemployed women and even so i made # 1 anyway . 
  there are questions , like the number of foreign borns in spain , that i call bullshit on what they claim the average spaniard answers . 
  that would be almost 1 out of 4 people ; nobody would answer that , ( and that 's the average ), 
   dependientes de madri ** z ** '' that 's what triggered me the most , to be honest, 
  ladino is basically that, 
  you are totally right , the norm should be to wash your hands ** before ** going to pee . 
  seriously are you going to touch your dick after grabing a door knob ? 
  looks about right for what i 've seen at work . 
  but i do n't always use soap though . 
  the egg was first, 
  imho , this past year they 've been focusing in things , that the average spaniard does not want . 
  * they still supported syriza after the debacle with the whole referendum meltdown . 
  `` they wanted to do good but the eu didnt let them '' is not a good selling point that you are going to change things . 
  * kind of supportive of the catalonia independece feat asking for a binding referendum . 
  i dont discuss about this topic but nevertheless , the average spaniard does n't want that . 
  * anti-borders , and `` no-one is illegal '' type of speeches at the face of the immigrant crisis . 
  even after the paris attacks they are still singing kumbaya and lets make peace with isis and shit . 
  the main appeal for them is their anti-corruption stand , but c 's are on the same level on that . 
  and do n't get me wrong but as someone said before in this thread iu+p odemos ( which politically are the same ) is also 22 % so they are not ** that ** bad . 
  i heard that for spain it is [ `` el principe '' ] ( http://i.blogs.es/76504d/elprincipe/650_1200.jpg ) , even though it 's considered part of ceuta which makes ceuta the poorest city in spain even though `` el principe '' is kind of detached . 
  btw the photo is from the tv show , but it 's hard to google one that it isnt :p, 
  yes actually , to enter melilla or ceuta if you are moroccan [ it 's not that difficult ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpzvqmwp6_4 ) , but leaving it for mainland , no so much . 
   that 's why 3rd generation immigrants are generally the worst , because that 's exactly what they feel due alienation or perceived persecution . 
  islam is alien , doing islamic stuff is alien , no wonder they still feel like aliens . 
  also  alienating people over religion does n't make them want to be part of secular french culture . 
  search the definition of secular , it does not mean what you think . 
  even so you should be against that anyway . 
  it cuts your own liberties to try to go around the real problem , islam . 
  fsa have n't existed for a year now , a bunch of them were able to carve their own chiefdom and they are not fighting but dealing , some others left the weapons completly and the majority affiliated ( integrally or partially ) with al-nusra ( al-qaeda ) the kurds do n't fight for syria so they are n't even a contender . 
  so 3 options for syria !, 
  al-qaeda , al-assad or isis ; choose your poison because no other power will win this . 
  2015 motto . 
  `` we need a wall '', 
  syria for what ? 
  send people to fight and die to give syria to al-qaeda ? 
  to al-assad ? 
  to isis ? 
  people need to understand that those are the 3 options . 
  why would anyone will send their people to die for one these ones , it 's absurd . 
  we just throw bombs to isis to make sure they do n't win and that 's it . 
  looks like you did n't get it back then and now . 
  nobody dropped a tear about his death . 
  what was/is regrettable its that it was an assasination op , no detention , no due process , pure revenge murder and celebrated as a feat . 
  and also kind of shady . 
  i dont care much about the brothers ; there is little room to be done there ( not until we adress islam as hate ideology and apply them the same rules we give to nazism , but that 's not gon na happen ) but what about the weapons ? 
  why we do n't we hear anything about the weapons and the explosives used ? 
  in the madrid bombings that was the a line of investigation that actually yield results . 
  rome is not an anlogy though , is history , and you are supossed to learn from history . 
  spying is not only about geopolitical stuff ; there is economics . 
  and knowing what another country is trying to buy , build or sell ; can give you or your companies an edge . 
  i do n't think he wants that at all . 
  two speed europe is actually one europe ; a core europe and the others . 
  so the ones that do n't want further integration do n't slow down the rest , but i do n't see how that benefits the uk in its actual idiosyncrasy . 
  is it bad that i am ok with that . 
  i do n't envy those countries when someone can get by without speaking the language of the place , with english is enough . 
  i do both , the only rule i 'm aware is to start on the top . 
  i do n't think we are praised too much about anything , sun and beaches , but they are pretty great so meh ... 
  the muslims had/have the horrible habit to change names of the places they are in . 
  so it 's not like the visigoths did n't get to the south , it 's that the arabs did n't stay long enough in the north to change the names .
