  also the ones that start with ben too . 
  benicasim benidorm abenojar or the wombo combo benalmadena, 
  in my humble opinion . 
  when you make a gradient and apply it to a map , if the map end up being binary , you have n't done a great job . 
  ( besides the decision of drawing rivers to make it more confusing ) so fyi , a province , has around 1000km2 , and the highest gradient goes to  100 toponims ; which means 100 things named after arabic for province , pretty low bar for a place where a civilization who liked to build stuff and rename shit settled . 
  so yeah , the scale is bad , but i do n't think the one who did that care about that but to say `` this was germanic , this was arab , godspeed '' when apart from the local toponims ( spanish , portuguese , basque etc ) we have , celtic , greek and mostly latin toponims . 
  that 's about right , we have both the 's ' sound and the ` th ' one , which is handy and i do n't get , less so from the english speakers , how is that funny . 
  me voy de casa - im leaving home . 
  it means very different things , and in spain 's spanish you can differentiate it while in american spanish you ca n't . 
  smoke . 
  no one has claim it , it defeats the purpose of a terrorist attack . 
  let me tell you how your country works : the thread . 
  i 'm one of those lucky people that still have lunch at home since i work 5 minutes on foot from where i live . 
  but when i have to travel somewhere else , it 's almost always 11 $ . 
  2 dishes a drink , coffee and/or desert . 
   i do n't know of a single eu country that was n't saying how inhumane we were for not taking every one of them in with open arms . 
  pretty sure countries didnt say anything , redditors of some eu countries on the other hand ... have n't even heard of that wave , less so spoke about it ; in january we were all charlie . 
  we do n't do halloween , but it 's a good excuse to sell monster goodies and do themed parties in pubs around that date . 
  `` it 's hard to lobby politicians in each country . 
  can you just have a handfull for all the eu , we will apreciate that . '', 
  yeah i could have done that . 
  and you could have said `` i 'm an eu skeptic because the refugee crisis '' so lots of us could have roll our eyes , and think `` another one linking their skepticism with the infamous migrant crisis . '', 
  and pass on like i 've done with any other migrant thread for the past couple of weeks . 
  lots of the things you are complaining about are solved precisely with a federation . 
  not that i support federalism , but you are full of bullshit tbh . 
  the inmigration thing is at the bottom of my list `` things i care '' and wo n't affect my voting and you have made like 8 of 10 points out of that . 
  i 've come to hate proffesional sport lately and there is lots to be said about that , but i agree with you ; this comic is directly against the `` game '' part of the sport which can be argued the same way against any kind of entertainment really . 
  did it burst ? 
  i 've always hear how housing prices keep growing in the netherlands . 
  the realpolitik , as you say , is that if turkey enters the eu , the eu will be bordering syria , iraq and iran . 
  turkey will have the same voting power as germany , and 80b turks will be able to roam europe which will go from 2 % muslim to 15 % . 
  this will never ever going to happen . 
  and everytime it is brought upon the farther i think we are from a real relation with them , a special treaty turkey-eu that it 's due . 
  but turkey in the eu it 's not only never going to happen , it 's a blatant lie . 
  i had a similar line of though as you acutally . 
  but i continue it , so i wiki him , saw that he was n't a nobody that his opinion would have some weight in france and shows a tendency in the left on the rest of the world . 
  it does not outrage me but it worries me . 
   like teenagers trying to be the most dissociated with what is considered uncool at your school . 
  funny that you say that , when i went to school i was the first kid to ask ( well my parents obviously ) for a no religion class in my school . 
  what happened next was that i had to get my chair and table out of the class , and sit alone in the hallway . 
  suddenly my school started gifting candies and trinkets in some religious days which of course i did n't get , and my parents got harrassed by other parents with no letting their sons befriend me . 
  this went on for two years until a scottish kid came to my school , and since he was a protestant they finally give us an alternative non-religious class . 
  so as i said , i find very funny this `` atheist cool in the school '' narrative , you people have taken to try to shame atheism as an inmature thing . 
  i did n't became an atheist to be cool , i 've always been one ; i was never led to believe in magic stuff and the concept is alien to me ; my parents are atheist , most of my grand parents were atheist , and some of my great-grand parents were atheist in a peculiar time of war for atheist . 
  so yes , i 'm an atheist , i 'm not angry , but i am vocal about it ; and you can meme it all you want i 'm not going to shut up or feel ashamed about it . 
   then a leftwing historian called them a totalitarian sham -- and his critique of ` zombie ** catholicism ** ' has outraged a nation still pretty bad . 
  whatever you say mate , but the reality is that because rt filmed how some syrians took their kids where there was tear gas cans and then put them on front of the cameras crying . 
  while the western media only showed me that hungarians were gassing children . 
  as i said you have to know ** what ** it is and how to use it . 
  it is putin news , and i 've never said that their news will always have some truth , but if putin get his hands on some truth he can use and our media do n't want to show it , you will still be able to see it . 
  how is that not valuable ? 
  like i saw that video of asylum seekers mistreating their own kids for their victimhood claim with my own very eyes , and then you tell people here that have never watch that and think you are making that up . 
  from someone who have never eaten in a school dinner in his life ( not even when i did a student exchange in france , actually . ), 
  i have to ask . 
  is it mandatory to eat there ? 
  are there no cost similar alternatives ? 
  does people think that the school is responsible to take care of the religious beliefs of their kids ? 
  i 'm not pro russia in the slightest but i appreciate rt a lot . 
  it 's a counterweight to our own media . 
  you just have to know what it means , and how to use it . 
  i have n't watched this specifically because ... 
  i do n't care ; i mean it 's a tragedy , i heard that it was full of hiv experts on top of that ; but nobody wanted them dead or anything it was an accident near a war zone . 
  it does n't really matter who was it ; and i 'm not going to waste time watching pr . 
  [ fraga 's bath ] ( http://www.manuelrivas.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/fraga-en-palomares.jpg ) is the only reason that [ event ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_79e0emityck/s3zrohr-ati/aaaaaaaag7c/639yd_ln2dk/s400/dibujo+del+ba%c3%b1o+de+fraga+en+palomares.jpg ) is still remembered, 
  i call playing the spanish guitar , spanish music tradition , so i would say we are all and well . 
  ( of course there is folk stuff , which depends on the region ), 
  i know . 
  it will piss off the anti-feminism guys who thinks that they should get things too and that they are getting right back at them . 
  and the other side , bleeding hearts , saving the souls of those who never asked for it , that feel good about themselves by saying `` i support this '' ; even though these centers are completly pointless . 
  not too shabby but i like this , to give my opinion , a sensible one i think , based on my perception of reality and no ideology , and get this many downvotes to show the ** `` my dogma  your opinion '' ** trend that we got in any discussion . 
  pretty useless thing to do , no one asked for this and the thinking behind this is devoid of any sense of reality , but whatever , if someone sleeps better thinking they are helping people , so be it \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  i thought you were going to say that the quotas are worse because it forces countries to be solidary and punish them if they do n't which is basically the definition of extortion . 
  instead you went with the whole , refugee crisis thing , which is a problem of course , but one that quotas has nothing to do , because quotas is about taking the asylum seekers which schengen countries at the border receive , that by international law , they ** can not ** kick , so we could redistribute a ** few ** them in the rest of schengen . 
  so whoever wants to fight immigration , quotas are the wrong front . 
  quotas are the front for people like me that are against this anti democratic shit ; even though i agree with spain helping hungary , greece and italy taking part of the massive strain they are getting . 
  but even with the whole extortion thing , i still think that ttip is way more important ( and dangerous ) because it will change law directly . 
  and experience has taught me that this bullets stay once they hit, 
  not literally but he said both things need to happen . 
  i 'm searching for it because it was linked in this subreddit . 
  i doubt it 's a smoke screen though , because the ttip has been postponed . 
  the quota system was made precisely to aliviate the refugee pressure on your country and the other refugee receivers ( italy and greece ) so those countries do n't have a quota , obviously , because we are taking the refugees from you ; and even so you will end up with more refugees than us . 
  i do n't know how your politicans and media are spinning this , but so you know . 
  about ttip i do n't know what will happen , but i can tell you one thing ; if we end up doing it , you will end up doing it . 
  what it really bothers me , as an overall leftist ( i buy more things in the left stand that from the right one , but i buy in both ) that the right-left discussion is about lgbt , feminism , inmigration and such things , that in the west affects very little while discussion about economy , development , law or foreign relations are completly ignored . 
  just look at this sub , thousands of threads about the refugees , `` my cat was scared by an asylum seeker '' and we have ttip over our fucking heads , juncker came and said ; `` we have to put immigrant quotas and accept ttip one way or another '' and everyone was shouting `` no quotas !!! '', 
  the heck ? \u00a1 that 's not the important part . 
   other people get a house i want a house too . 
  i do too , let him prove it . 
   the west made me radical , the moderates de-radicalised me eh, 
  do n't live in saudi arabia or do n't get wine while there or do n't get caught or get your 350 lashes he had plenty of options imo . 
  it 's not their idea anyway , it 's the ngos that guide them and explain them what they had to do and stuff . 
  it 's not really that they are `` entitled '' , as people say . 
  they 've been instructed already where and how get stuff done . 
  not only you came insulting , you also fail to see the point which was that history has many takes , insufferable brat . 
  each country tell history different . 
  i was taught at the school that colombus was a douchebag , tax evader , slaver , despotic , sadistic son of a bitch , stripped of the governor title , end up in prison and died thinking he found the indias . 
  not even the `` earth is round '' thing is attributed to him , since it was something discussed at the time . 
  so we give more credit to queen isabella , ( so us , spain ) that actually give the boats , the men and paid the expedition on the bet that it was possible . 
  and the colombus ' landfall is taught as a national feat ( even though there was no spain back then ) that linked two continents , not as a personal one . 
  as a i say history can be told in many different ways .
