  we did n't have a national day , in 1981 someone decided we needed one and choose `` d\u00eda de la hispanidad '' hispanity day or something that we shared as a link with other hispanic countries . 
  it 's retarded and lately latin american countries hate it , so whatever free day , weee . 
  this is what google does in english probably americans , so let 's try it in spanish `` es espa\u00f1a ... ? '', 
  i give up . 
  i forgot that there are other spanish speaking americans . 
  it does not look like it 's isis but if it is , pretty sure something will happen . 
  if it 's speaking ** english ** , it 's probably us , we have 5 vowels which are always pronounce the same while in english ... you know . 
  have you heard us say wifi ... so yeah . 
  ( and we are not going to change it btw , because we are not going to give up our pronunciation rules . ), 
  if it 's the accent they had in their ** own language ** , to me it 's mexicans but since we are talking europe it will be the scots . 
  probably because i know enough english to recognize the english without understand it . 
  if it 's the accent speaking ** my language ** i would go with brits ( and mericans ) because their lack of interest in using stress in words ( even people who are fluent ) which is actually very important in spanish . 
  ingl\u00e9s ( english ) and ingles ( groins ) are only differentiable because the stress , mind you . 
  armies ? 
  morocco acutally asked some years ago to be a member of the eu ... just saying :d, 
  anyone that is not red white and blue , it reminds me too much to the flag of the most evil country in the world . 
  yes , north korea . 
  because you do n't identify with them ? 
  because you do n't feel they are your people ? 
   an ethnic group or ethnicity is a socially defined category of people who identify with each other based ** on common ancestral ** , social , cultural ** or ** national experience . 
  i will mark the ** or ** too , to point out that it can be whatever of those . 
  and i do n't know if it 's racist to think/feel that way ( i really do n't know ) , but it 's not more racist than when black people from america indentify themselves as african-american , as their own thing ; that 's also an ethnicity like irish americans or black irish or suomi or whatever . 
  and i 'm not here discussing if english people have to be white or not ; i do n't know , i dont care and i do n't have a saying in that . 
  i 'm telling you that your definition of ethnicity is wrong and i 'm giving you the offical one which is also the same one as people on the streets use ; if that makes the `` ethinicity '' concept racist , so be it . 
  but get a grip on reality . 
   spain 's angel maria villar is expected to head uefa - european football 's governing body - while platini is suspended . 
  ay , furball for everyone . 
  he is as corrupted as those two , but retarded and can not even spell football , he says furball every fucking time . 
  does the eu have to get to this [ point ? 
  ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/4/4a/no_homers_club.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130205212807 ), 
  not two-tier . 
  just one union , why people think it 's difficult ? 
  a eu , with its parliament , commisions and stuff and then treaties with others . 
  how is it that hard ? 
  if you are in , you have a saying in the common policy , if you are out you can negotiate your agreements , but obviously you ca n't decide what the union does . 
  whatever the wording hollande had , its clear that we are getting to a point about integration that all these cherrypicking treaties that we 've been laying for a while are a hindrance and not sustainable . 
  i 'm not really that into further integration , but if we do that ; it 's only sensible to break some agreements with countries that wo n't have/want a place in a more united europe , not because despite , just plain common sense ; i think its pretty obvious , i do n't understand the animosity these discussions usually create . 
   an ethnic group or ethnicity is a socially defined category of people who identify with each other based on common ancestral , social , cultural or national experience . 
  that 's what it means officially and unsurprisingly that 's also what it means colloquially . 
  so it 's for english people to decide what their ethnicity is ; what they feel it 's their own ; being white , tea drinking , english speaking or whatever . 
  i need to ; what can a turkey do to a man ? 
  a joke that has become the republicans worst nightmare . 
  not only is someone that would lose any elections , he is also a living over exaggerated caricature of a republican . 
  i think it 's pretty bad for a two-party system to weaken one side this much . . 
  so i would stop the trolling to be honest . 
  what a fucking disgrace of a guy december 20 ; when people is busy with christmas and stuff , some people get vacations and move near their families . 
  it should have been in november , this is the biggest gap without elections in the history of spain democracy . 
  and he is also taking 5 national budgets in 4 years . 
  and political campaign in december , puagg . 
  comparison 2012 - 2015 pp : ** - ** 123k votes c 's : ** + ** 459k votes there is something that people tend to forget , that this elections has a turnout of 77 % when last elections were 67 % . 
  that means that a seat cost 13 % more votes ( not really because d'hont , subscriptions etc , but you get the idea ), 
  because he is a meme, 
  so help me understand , what is x ? 
  x ------- christianism islam -- islamism, 
  muslims are people , and they can believe whatever they want , in magic guy in the sky , aliens , that the earth is flat , or in the evolution theory ; whatever you want to believe . 
  now , islam , on the other hand it 's a guide of customs , norms and laws adorned with mysticism , that are nocive for weste ... for any country really , and should be denounce like we do with fascism , machism and etc. . . 
  but apparently now , you can be called racist for criticizing ideas . 
  just check the message above me . 
   ** normal **  [ nawr-muh l ]  adjective  1 . 
  conforming to the standard or the common type ; usual ; not abnormal ; regular ; natural . 
  anyway , the idea is to denounce `` islam '' not muslims , neither the `` normals '' or the `` abnormals '', 
  it would be ce ce ese ese , but we do n't do that . 
  if the acronym makes a word like otan or onu , sure , we pronounce the word but not the letters . 
  lately you can hear `` be ce e '' for the european central bank , but i cringe everytime . 
  this is too sad , people treat this crisis as a joke like there is no problem at all and at the other side , with a lack of humanity . 
  i feel that we are going to take the worst of both stands . 
  funny statement since hillary got more votes than trump , yet the later won . 
  they will make a special deal between them , do n't worry about it . 
   education laws used to last at least 20 years . 
  you mean when there was a dictator that did whatever he wants to ? 
  wow hard to belive he didnt revoke his own laws . 
  i do n't know about celebrating or the euro trip , but that guy is under the effect of cocaine that 's for sure . 
  i was writing a big response to this , but i 've stop halfway . 
  educate yourself . 
  which if true , would tell a lot of the kind of refugees we are taking in . 
  people still do n't understand that this is a alqaeda vs al assad vs isis , and the west , government and media , is rooting for alqaeda . 
  i have n't read the article . 
  is it about muslims or vegans ? 
   i 'd like to know what constitutes ` harrasment ' in this survey . 
  tweets , it says so in the article, 
  who cares though , what is the downside to let other countries in as long as is hosted in europe ? 
  reminder that ceuta is actually no part of nato, 
  fucking this , they 've always had this fame , this is not new and surely not brexit related . 
  the only time i 've been to the uk , when i went there to watch us lose 4-0 against liverpool , some drunk guy kick me in the head . 
  and a friend of mine who did erasmus in plymouth told me that everytime he hang out with some mexican friends he made there was harrassed by young roamers that apparently had nothing better to do . 
  i would rank dal\u00ed and velazquez before picasso as painters , and way way before them cervantes ... 
  i went to see the rankings on the web and i saw number 2 trajan , does this have anything to do with current trends because civ vi ? 
  because you do n't hear from trajan much . 
  i 'm looking at the ranking and 4th is hadrian so this is from people who really like history and romans , or game of thrones fans search too much about the hadrian 's wall in scotland ... 
  i would have gone with one of the mj 's way before any politician, 
  i would have gone with suleiman even though no idea where he was born . 
  that or arda turan to be honest ... 
  i have no idea who the nordic ones are . 
  if you would ask me i would have answer : laudrup , nobel , breivik , bjork and raikkonen tbh . 
  edit because i forgot iceland ... 
  this , after reading the title i came to post a famous fleetwood mac song , but i see that it is only the wishfully thinking of a dreamer . 
  and with that , and after getting 4 political parties , i wo n't be able to vote in the next elections . 
  and got a job in spain in the football training school of madrid . 
  he was fired last week , btw , beause he have n't learn a word of the language . 
  you are right but , the ` fun ' of bullfighting is the torture and the killing .
