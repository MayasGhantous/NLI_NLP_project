  i do n't care about animals , i do n't agree with prohibitions , but as a spaniard , bullfighting ashame me , because it tells a lot about ( some of ) our people, 
  25 % of the scots who voted leave the eu , prefer to be in the single market than in the uk . 
  that 's cold, 
  true , i welcomed the superhero trend to stop the fantasy/dystopian teenager love drama trend and i immediately regret my decision . 
  as someone who has always like the nordic mythos i hope this viking trend in media die off soon . 
  i did n't even read the whole title , i just saw spain and start reading comments . 
  just for information what result could that hypothetical referendum probably have ? 
  it actually affects me , when they send me to another city , i have to get up 2 hours early and come back even later . 
  not that its going to change anything at this point , but at least i know i 'm in the right . 
  spain more gdp than canada and italy , i do n't need to look at the date to know we are talking about the year 1 b.c. 
  before crisis . 
  i read otherwise in the thread , my bad . 
  everything is cool then . 
  because is just the symbol of communism , while the nazi flag is the symbol of nazi germany . 
  if you want to talk about the totalitarian ideology you have the fascim symbol which in spain is part of the uniform of the [ guardia civil ] ( http://images.teinteresa.es/espana/nuevo-uniforme-guardia-civil_tinima20110915_0489_18.jpg ), 
  i do n't mind but its not consistent with the ban on the nazi flag . 
  is this a joke ? 
  it looks so good that marvel copy the [ royal uniform ] ( http://blog.adlo.es/images/2011/12/umvc3houseofmmagneto.jpg ) for [ magneto ] ( http://estaticos03.elmundo.es/elmundo/imagenes/2012/02/24/navegante/1330107044_0.jpg ) . 
  i got envious i went to see what happened in spain in 1066 ... [ 1066 granada massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1066_granada_massacre ) sweet jesus !, 
  biggest jew killing in europe before the holocaust . 
   the ** direct ** will of the people do n't delete pls , parliament is a scam , a rigged system where you can not vote what you want . 
  a referendum is a direct question `` do you want out of the eu ? '', 
  `` yes '' `` so fucking be it '', 
  going against the result of a referendum , the direct will of the people . 
  literally the worst possible outcome . 
  so what does poland need to do to be fully westernized ? 
  i 'm honestly asking . 
   i do n't think the us is much better than russia or china . 
  but they are . 
  sure they are not anglels but they are better than fucking russia and better than fucking china , come on now . 
  how many more times do we need to read the same shit ? 
  i kind of think like that too because i always thought that in the last moment people will vote `` status quo '' but with brexit there is no `` status quo '' option . 
  whatever you choose , everything will change . 
  its weird , im 50/50 if nothing changes but i would assume that may will have a play yet to make before the vote and can sway it in her favor . 
  all those things about `` fighting for freedom '' `` choosing to be a dane '' sounds pretty good , it flatters some ego and it does a very good job at appealing to emotion . 
  but honesty it lacks of any intellectual or logic behind it . 
  no arguments were given for any definition of nationality we know of . 
  no offense but the real problem you guys have is the voting system , bipartidism or bust is not a good way to handle democracy . 
  how is gender theory not controversial . 
  some people need to get out of their bubble . 
  social science is not science this stuff has no place in school , period . 
  you want to teach those theories , perfect , get a plataform , do your work , bother people who want to hear you , whatever . 
  but , let 's have political and social doctrines far away from our education system . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  that stuff has no place in the schools , kids already receive enough indoctrination as it is . 
  actually , i almost got run over by one this monday , i was walking down a pedestrian only street with some friends and i just notice a sound like a bycicle so i didnt care to look even though you could notice the vibration of the ground , my friends pull me out of the way , and it was a fucking electrical van . 
  if they become a thing its going to be hard adjusting . 
  25 % of foreign doctors do seem like a problem and there is nothing wrong to invest in your medic school so you produce more doctors instead of importing them . 
  the wording though is concerning . 
  people is reading too much into this . 
  fmi get things wrong all the time for ** all the countries ** spain forecast was half point less than what they say now ; they say they have been overly pesimistic ** with everyone ** the only one who get less than they thought is france . 
  i do n't know why the guardian makes it all about britain . 
  it will be a non-non-governmental organization very usefull much solidarity . 
  this decade ? 
  that 's actually something no to brag about . 
  how sad it is that this is the best comment on this thread . 
  i literally do n't know who these people are , and why are always on the press ; i just learned that west is an actual musician . 
  pretty bad , but i would n't want it any other way . 
   but how could you oppose ... 
  the cancer of this century debates . 
  it 's because `` muh equiality '' , it makes no sense , euros to pr , its like watching an ad but you paid for it . 
  the place where he 'd find a job quickly and get well paid it would be a major city , which besides language there is no culture shock at all ; they are all the same . 
   ciudadanos , and pray that they can purge the pp 's corruption as much as they can ( which means not much , but better than nothing ) i 'm an atheist , i do n't pray to things going my way , also i do n't believe in the free market magics of c 's and also i do n't believe that they have any desire to reform pp . 
  the reality is that they accept rajoy as the president , setting aside that everyone close to him ; barbera , ana mato , rato , de la serna , soria , ar\u00edstegui , barcenas and on an on have a proven corruption scandal . 
  ** no fucking way ** my vote is going to get near those people ; that would be conceding to this scum who made me wish we had chinese law ( death penalty for corruption ), 
  i 'm the kind of guy who thinks that you should always vote , but right now ? 
  there is no way . 
  i 'm fucking powerless and depressed . 
  whatever happens with psoe now if you go to vote next election you are : a ) supporting corruption , totally in your face , like ; yeah do whatever you want , there is no backlash , you can keep governing whatever horrible bullshit you do . 
  b ) supporting independent movements that held spanish congress hostage with a minority of votes . 
  i am personally in favor of independece if they have a good majority , but i wo n't bend to a hostage situation , when is clear that the rest of spaniards are against it . 
  and there is no other way about it . 
  any vote in the next election will go to ** a ** or ** b ** . 
  ** i literally can not vote now **, 
  it 's a terrible idea , but for each uk flag saying that , a new person gets keen on the idea . 
  i think i 've never shake hands with a woman . 
  i mean i do n't have anything against it , but there is n't any custom that requires it here . 
  its european sterotypes , you silly, 
  ok thanks . 
  i guess they thought they could get away with it because she agreed to have sex with two of them and then she wouldnt dare to denounce or nobody would take her seriously . 
  and just like that you have 5 guys , sportsmen , well off , showing their true color just because they thought they could get away with it . 
  that makes me think about how many closeted psycopaths we have in our midst and how many of them do get away with their crap . 
  also i 'm mad that the last guy who in my view did even worse gets a lesser punishment . 
  at my job almost every woman drink tea instead of coffee ( i do n't get it btw ), 
   western europe has progressed more and currently way way better place than poland . 
  debatable , i do n't think western europe has progressed much in this past 20/30 years while poland has . 
  so you say that you have been living in the uk for few years , so i take you have some years under your belt , i thought at first that you are at `` that '' age and at `` that '' phase . 
  also to not feel like an oddball about point 3 ) , you will have to live in morocco or jordan or something like that ( and even so ... ) . 
  in fact , as a no drinker myself , i would say that spain or italy are the few places in europe where that is not a social handicap . 
  only that britain has left the eu mainly because immigration , australia leave boat people stranded in an island and there is candidate in the us a bomb away to become president whose big policy is to build a wall at the border . 
  and i think it should be in a country that is not in nato . 
   `` each one of this reds dots is an anti-islamic tweet '' oh no !, 
  call the cops !, 
  the army !, 
  wo n't somebody please think of the children ? 
  ok , you are being ridiculous now, 
   `` when i started to watch these dramas , i realised how tired i was with all the violence and sex of american tv . '', 
  i know i am , the `` fight '' scenes are sameshit all the time i usally check internet on my phone while i hear the `` thud `` s and `` plank `` s of the fights . 
  and the sex scenes are even more retarded , there is 3 types ; sexual tensions that will always be resolved , wife gets depressed and cheat on husband or just tits and asses for the masses got style . 
  still i would n't touch a soap not even with a stick .
