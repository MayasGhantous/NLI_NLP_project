   but i would n't act on it because you have to respect peoples ' choices as long as ** they are not forced upon you ** can you see the irony of what you are saying ? 
  to me the problem is not the animal , we do worse things to animals on a daily basis in the food industry or in pharma . 
  the problem for me is that people think is fun to go and see a real living being , a big one , get tortured as a spectacle . 
  i do n't care about the bull , its the `` show '' what is clearly wrong . 
  i want spain out of nato with or without eu army . 
  ca n't imagine what that could be ? 
  first , i do n't care what isis wants . 
  i 'm not going to do something i do n't like just because isis do n't want me to do it . 
  second , people do n't like muslims , they do n't want muslims , and they made them uncomfortable so they do n't come again . 
  see ? 
  people are not stupid and what they do is easy to understand . 
  i mean if the western values can not defend themselves , maybe they are not that good to begin with ? 
  just a thought i am a pragmatist i dont care about ideologies , so this values you speak of meh , i despise religions and i would like to see islam the worst of them all to be treated like scientology since apparently nobody had a problem with how that one is treated . 
  it is dying in south america too , fast and steady . 
  also spain can very well be the country where catholicism have ravaged its people the most . 
  and next time spare us from your history conclusions ( morocco is more devout than spain so they win ? 
  what ? ), 
  which is also based on false premises . 
  just the term ** reconquista ** is a sham , it was a concept that appeared later on when two thirds of the peninsula were already `` reconquered '' by kingdoms that happened to be christians , but they fought between themselves , ally or even marry with the muslim emirs . 
  nobody was reconquering anything , less so in the name of religion , that bs came later . 
  i mean , imagine an arab seeing us pronounce , gibraltar , benicasim or cordoba, 
  exactly this , there is nothing else to add . 
  i 've been saying the same points until i got tired of it , `` look what turkey is doing right now ; they can not enter the eu '' threads should stop . 
  the turkey discussion in this sub is the never ending groundhog day and have been for 4-5 years, 
  i must say that this 21 % is pretty high . 
  i mean it says people aged 18-24 , those are not the dropouts due to the housing bubble to put bricks like it happened in my generation . 
   pork gyros i didnt know this exist and i want one now, 
  sure , 2 +2 is 4 whatever the majority says . 
  but if the people you are explaining this still thinks that is 5 how are you not `` losing the argument '' . 
  but what merkel is losing is not a math argument , its national policy in democracy , which is the will of the people . 
  actually , if losing votes is not the objective indicator of `` losing the argument '' i do n't know what could be then . 
  haha what ? 
  nations , nationality and all that goes with it is politics . 
  like when sports form national teams ? 
  then why is it happening in the uk and not in continental europe ? 
  it 's not , it 's rather obvious . 
  what profesional formation can you expect from women ( or a man ) 30-40 years ago in places like la mancha or andalucia , which people live in towns and villages , dependant on agriculture , and almost null urban economy . 
  have you seen women working the fields or putting bricks down , because that was the economy of the red part of spain , and probably for the other countries . 
  also the difference in the hue of the colors is bigger than in the numbers they represent , mind you . 
   `` mental issues '' can we denounce this trend and kill it the sooner the better . 
  it gets me very angry when the media treat me like a retard . 
  no , they are smart enough , they also saw first hand that it does n't work and more importantly they do n't need to , separatists will win eventually . 
  maybe , but there are better plays to earn independece . 
  i can tell you that a catalan terrorist group will assure that a independent catalonia will never happen . 
  the thing is a pole would prefer to work and get 3x 4x times that . 
  while others will just contempt with the 450 and be a parasite for life . 
   what is the goal of the catalans that try to gain independence ? 
  new switzerland, 
  i 'm going to guess that they do . 
  no we are n't , we were , we won . 
  i would be ** delighted ** if islam had the same rejection in society as fascism , racism , anarchism or even communism . 
  i would totally settle for that , and stop posting about this theme . 
  muslims are not helpless retarded kids that need my approval or from the west to tell them where should they stand or what they should be , they can decide for themselves , that 's not my business nor my interest . 
  what it is my interest is what we , the west , do in the face of something so antagonistic to our way of life as islam is , and how we can change the hypocrital narrative that is puting our society in the hands of the far right populism . 
  uh what ? 
  there was a referendum that said what was the national interest . 
  i would have said to have at least 60 % of the vote or something like that , since it 's kind of irreversible but they did n't and everyone voted knowing what they were doing . 
  so politicians are doing the only thing they can/should do , people 's will . 
   which has requested his extradition for crimes related to running the site has he even put a foot in the us to be extradited to it ? 
  ok if podemos is able to push forward the referendum about nato , i will vote leave and try to convince others . 
   spain : 1.2 why should we spend more ? 
  we have no feasible enemies . 
  our contribution is a net gain to nato , nobody will need to defend us and we will if others are attacked . 
  also if you do n't like it , throw us out . 
  spain joined nato against the wish of the people , we do n't need it , it 's a commitment to defend the western world , but if you are going to bich about it , we better leave . 
  yup , and the government should be prepare to be replaced by populist and extremist right wing parties . 
  that 's the cost of inactivity . 
  actually two weeks ago i went to my home town to visit my parents and i was walking near a park on a sunday morning and i 've never seen so many black people , they were playing baseball with their wives and kids watching around the park . 
  mostly dominicans from what i got , but pretty weird for a small town . 
  this post is a fine example of `` intellectual dishonesty '' take a good look , tag the user and carry on . 
  la mancha , but you guys are making me feel old , 2007 ... that 's when i finished university . 
  i know that my history exam was about fernando vii ( worst king ) so i 've actually searched for it ( it 's a slow day at work ) and you could choose between two forms , one about 20th century stuff or the other one with fernando vii stuff . 
  i chose the later , but maybe we knew that it had two options so we/i did n't studied what we never got to in classes . 
  i 've had like 3 rewinds through my high school . 
  and i for sure did n't study anything past ww1 for `` selectividad '' . 
  i did high school on aznar period . 
  i 'm a spaniard and i never learned it at school . 
  this is how history classes worked for me : prehistory + celtiberans -  punic wars -  roman empire -  visigoths -  al andalus -  reconquista -  catholic kings + america -  habsburg kings -  spanish succesion war -  shitty french kings -  napoleon -  industrial revolution and rewind !!, 
  it 's celtiberans again !, 
  just because you agree with some ideas doesnt mean you have to defend whatever is done for them . 
  in fact they 've given the moral high ground to erdogan , i think turkey secularism is done for the count . 
  to be honest i think the 15 % total brexit will happen and i only give a very small chance that scotland leaves the uk . 
  i also think that the relation between uk and the eu is not going to be good . 
  that 's my prediction anyway , who knows what will happen . 
  we have isabel queen of castille , not spain , for us . 
  the problem is that there is no one else , felipe ii was king when spain was at its highest but its more despite of him than because of him . 
  and after that it 's a shitshow really . 
  gibraltar out of the eu is one of the few good things brexit brings . 
  i do n't understand why scotland would think that allying itself with a tax haven will help them stay in the eu . 
  the difference is that you can leave the eu whenever you want . 
  but leavin the eu will be irreversible . 
  i 've never agreed with the just  50 % but eh ... 
  it is what it is . 
  this feels like discussing if it was penalty or not after a lost match . 
  who cares anymore !, 
  sure , also i want a saying in that , because i do n't want gibraltar to have anything to do with spain . 
  but meanwhilte when uk officially leaves , lets close the frontier with that tax haven . 
  or 26 when denmark leaves . 
  let 's see what happens next , the night is young everything can happen now . 
  feels like we are witnessing history .
