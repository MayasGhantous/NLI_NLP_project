  that feel , that you would like to have a peek 3 or 4 years into the future . 
  it 's interesting , probably nothing will happen at the end . 
  the article is true , but this title we have here is misleading . 
  they were trying to find dirt on them to expose them for political reasons , and all they got was weak stuff to show . 
  but there is no lie , no forgery or false accusation . 
  it just shows how spain really works inside , disgusting really , . 
  hi , i 'm a lawyer specialiced in the eu . 
  let me tell you why you should n't make me jobless . 
   i mean when did politics turn into high school do i need to give you an exact date ? 
  myself on the other hand , i like his humour but his `` points '' , in everything he does , are skewed and bullshit for the most part . 
  always , it does n't matter if i 'm for what he says , against or meh like in this one . 
  i think its like the 20th time they have withdraw the application since im in r/europe its a recurring new, 
  from the article :  % of respondents think that islam is not compatible with the west over 50 % in lots of countries but it 's constantly ignored . 
  its the subsidies for agriculture , not cohesion funds . 
  checkmate atheists, 
  i really doubt the question was formulated like that . 
  i think this is a valid point if it really bothers you . 
  if you are in the eu you can not kick out eu citizens even if they have commited a crime and paid for it ( if they do n't pose a real threat and yadda yadda ) i myself do n't mind this , and believe me we have our fair share of eu criminals , british included in our coasts . 
  but that is part of being in a union . 
  criminals that have paid their sentences can move around , from poland to the uk , or from uk to spain . 
  if that bothers you is good point to vote for brexit ; the uk doesnt have to deal with eu criminals , and the eu does not have to deal with british ones . 
  is n't that censorhip ? 
  i will call it indoctrination if you do n't mind . 
  it 's funny to see britain one of the countries that have been more favorable of turkey joining the eu , saying now the contrary and pretending that it 's being forced upon them . 
  to be honest the thing that bother me the most is that its close . 
  i would be happy with whatever result stay or leave , if it had a larger majority . 
  this 50 % ~ kinda sucks whatever the results , it felt like the future of eu-uk relations is a gamble more than a conviction . 
  one thing is citizenship and another to be really czech ; and `` race '' can have something to do or not . 
  each identity is different . 
  but you can not tell me that to became really czech is enough to do what lots of british pensioners are doing in spain , lots of them fulfill all your criteria , and they will be the first to tell you they are not spanish in the slightest . 
   mostly no matter his language . 
  i ca n't take you seriously with this . 
  yeah , when i saw that one i was , oh i know that 's a slavic language , lets see the responses . 
  czech , croatian and slovenian fuck you the romanian one was easy , though . 
  20/28 educated guesses for the win . 
  whose national dish is this ? 
  the fuck i know , there is bacon , so denmark . 
  yes !, 
  btw , fuck your tulips hungary, 
  i do n't understand how anti-immigrant is hate speech , i just do n't . 
  they do this every summer , anti tourism warnings and stuff . 
  to be honest the ones who are more probable to have a terrorist attack at this point is the us to shift the elections . 
  i 've been saying it , we are one terrorist attack away from president trump . 
  help is such a mild term though . 
  i wanted to help so i gave money to unhcr so they could feed the refugees , give them medical treatment , tents in the refugee camps and stuff like that . 
  when i saw that what unhcr was doing is to help the refugees to cross borders breaking the laws of the countries i stop giving them `` help '' . 
  please take them , you only need a cheap flight , cheap booze and invite david guetta , and they are all yours . 
  men i do n't know how you all got those high scores ... 
  i had a 63 % and it 's much better than i expected from what i did . 
  i did n't know the vast majority of stuff they were talking about . 
  laws , people , dates , the fuck you know about all of that ? 
  i think i have answered like 5 that i was sure of the answer , football , churchill , falklands and the joke in the last one . 
  i do n't know how common is [ this ] ( http://diy.ahorro.net/files/2012/08/como-arreglar-un-persiana-de-cinta-que-se-atasca.jpg ) outside of spain but i do n't see them too much . 
  same in spain . 
  my parents have them in their rural house , but i do n't really see much of the point , i think persianas are far more useful than that little feature and there is no persianas thread . 
  i mean , there is nothing wrong with those windows , its an extra option so that 's cool but it 's still super meh to be so excited about . 
  this looks like satire , or at least false flag looking at the youtube channel its in . 
   easy i would go with possible, 
  1050 - cordova 450 ( or 150 ) 1200 - cordova 60 i know what you are thinking ? 
  reconquista ... nope , cordova was conquered in 1250 ~ by the christians . 
  in that interval was taken by the almohads , basycally the isis of the time . 
  they were angry at the muslim spaniards , because they drink wine , have jews and christinas in positions of power and nobles could have male harems . 
  first germany second brexit third sweden that was my guess , i totally forgot russia , surprised by italy , and turkey does not count . 
  why do you speak with a lisp ? 
  bonus points if the language of the one saying this , also have the ` th ' sound in its vocabulary . 
  i think it was unnecesary to do the `` allahu akbar '' thing but the aftermath is what scares me really . 
  ** community activist in peace & conflict resolution **  good question . 
  we need to move away from stereotypes if we want to achieve real learning . 
  a terrorist can be any one ** manchester university 's diversity officer ilyas nagdee **  stupid decision by @gmpolice to decide attackers should be seen as muslim . 
  maybe that 's why islamophobias gone up 300 % in the uk ** communitysafetyforum **  this sort of thing panders to stereotypes and further divides us . 
  it will increase anti-muslim hate crime . 
  pretty sure it 's only in duolingo . 
  it makes sense since it 's popular in the us and it 's always mentioned about learning spanish . 
  she always stated that the painting was n't finished . 
  i know zero about painting , but could this be like a base paint , to then paint the details over it . 
  im pro brexit but what you said is a lie or ignorance . 
  the eu does not restrict immigration from outside , each country can do whatever it wants . 
  and inside the common market we have free movement of persons , the fact that brits still do n't get what it means , speak volumes about how useless are these conversations . 
  9 % are just taking the piss, 
  infanta cristina is a good name to break the law with . 
  more seriously , i do n't belive this new ... sorry , i mean this tweet . 
  in spanish we always translate it as `` cornudo '' which we already have graffitis dated back from the roman empire with that word already ... claiming that its a new invention is kind of a stretch . 
  anyway picardo did n't call the eu cucks , only donald tusk . 
  no , it 's not a good solution , i do n't like gibraltarians , and they do n't like us , how is it good to be together ? 
  i understand the government would like the territory for geographical integrity , nationalism or whatever , but the people there !? 
  the only good solution is a wall . 
  good , so no problem then . 
   according to most of the european union 's leaders and many academic institutions , europe needs mass migration from africa and the middle east to fill current and future gaps in the job market . 
  they will argue that the only workable and sustainable policy involves a safe , legal route for large numbers of these people to enter europe and settle here . 
  this meme needs to die [ https://www.statista.com/statistics/266228/youth-unemployment-rate-in-eu-countries/] ( https://www.statista.com/statistics/266228/youth-unemployment-rate-in-eu-countries/ ), 
  build a wall , build a wall , build a wall now i know how a trump supporter feels, 
  upvote for visibility, 
  my take is that it should work like healthcare , sure you get the same treatment as anybody else , but then you pass the bill to the governmet of the country where that guy is from . 
  easy and already working . 
  there is also the leave the eu solution . 
  fair enough it 's their bargain chip , i do n't see anything wrong with using it . 
  and i may be wrong but i do n't regard intelligence services that much . 
  trump is president with the meddling of russia and anyday of the week a muslim can get a van and mow down some people , so this intelligence thing is kind of meh . 
  that 's what the people of this country voted . 
  i have a dream , a r/europe without brexit threads .
