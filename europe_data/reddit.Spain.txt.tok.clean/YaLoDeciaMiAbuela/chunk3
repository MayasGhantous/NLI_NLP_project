  extremely butthurt spanish magazine about racism and immigration . 
  as an atheist who has always despise any religion i must say that he is right , i ca n't deny my christianity as part of my culture and life values . 
  so in the end i agree with him except the part where he says `` a religion teaches ; it is a form of life that gives one peace and happiness . '', 
  that 's laughable . 
  to be honest , i know 3 people that has gone to germany and 1 to the uk , and none of them are planning on staying there , mind you . 
  it 's just than in spain only some of us are luck enough to have a job . 
  while i do n't really belive this story , i think there is a middle ground between report some poor sod and to let him live in your home . 
  even more than poland , that 's surprising . 
  what it 's not surprising is the little interest of spain . 
  ukraine , a country at the other side of europe , that we know nothing of , and with the romatic view of russia from the spanish left , 48 is even higher than expected . 
  i do n't get this nuclear war nonesense . 
  it 's a proxy war just like korea , vietnam etc. 
  you just put the troops on ukraine and that 's it . 
  other thing is if nato should intervene , that 's another question enterily . 
  not nato soldiers , and the bait about spain still does not contradict anything i said . 
   do n't wait for germany , france , italy & spain all those countries you mention have acted everytime nato has been called upon . 
  in defensive war as in afghanistan or the offensive one in yugoslavia . 
  will a nato country be next ? 
   i am a phd . 
  candidate at the london school of economics with a longstanding interest in politics , both domestic and global . 
  i also have an abiding belief that the local drives the global - ** that the motivations for countries ultimately reflect the motivations of their leaders , not an amorphous `` national interest '' ** and it shows mate and i do n't agree , at least about democracies . 
  i 'm sorry but i just do n't belive that a 4-8 year ruler will dictate the geopolitical guidelines of a nation ( neither its populance , mind you ) the text talks too much about obama decisions but does not mention the us even once . 
  also it makes a very weird comparisson of how europe push mussolini to hitler ; then again who is putin supossed to be ? 
  mussolini , hitler or both ? 
  i really do n't understand the aprehension to join nato . 
  it 's basycally europe + usa , it puts you in a block you are already in . 
  it 's a defensive pact , not an agressive one , and excuse me but you ( as sweden , finland ) are already benefiting from its existence . 
  what are the reasons against ? 
  seriously ? 
   show me proof that ukraine did n't shoot first at the 40000 combat-ready russian patriotic forces, 
  and in spain we have [ this ] ( http://tendido1.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/jamon_iberico_bellota_plato_650.jpg ) i think we are second in pig consumer per person , just behind denmark . 
  i do n't think is the diet but culture , drinking culture to be more specific . 
  over 83 reporting in . 
  i just want to say that this map is to show the difference between european nation but overall that difference is negligible . 
  [ in short ] ( http://tlb.hwcdn.net/a7t8j9h8/cds/resources/jpg/2/7/1331577097872.jpg ), 
  merkel yesterday ask for the same thing in spain , that he should back up a woman for the economy comission . 
  is this real life ? 
  if our navy can go around the world selling drugs , why not the guardia civil . 
  also it 's the fucking guardia civil , we have standard police too . 
   i really like the fect that it does n't have an official lyric i also agree . 
  usually , since you hear it in other languages , you just listen to the music and the singing , without knowing the meaning . 
  but when i hear latin american ones , my god that shit is awkward . 
  this sounds like being a taxi without paying the taxi license , so as long as they pay some equivalent tax , i do n't have a problem with it . 
  very diplomatic yes . 
  yeah what a shame ... 
  i have one question , the girl can go to uk or france and get her abortion without a problem , right ? 
  i mean is good to have the rights to do it , but while we wait the society to evolve and such , she is not stranded in the desert . 
  i must say that if it was my case i would have even bother with the law , and i would have got the abortion as quickly as possible . 
  whelp , i for one do n't like this `` public language '' you are talking about , learning other languages should be a personal option and t i do n't find it right to force feed a country with a foreign language . 
  just because we are in a union that does not exempt me for having to learn polish if i go to poland . 
  and while r/europe will disagree with me , let 's remember that it does n't reflect the opinion of europeans , but the opinion of europeans that speak english ( or try to speak it , like me ), 
  that 's cherry picking really . 
  my mother was a cook for a hospital and the food was pretty decent . 
  and now that she is working in a mental hospital , i can assure you the crazies eat better than the majority of people in their homes . 
  i feel that the day spaniards learn english , we would have truly lost ourselves . 
  let 's all pray that this never happens . 
  and i say this as someone that maybe does not speak it , but at least understands english . 
  i knew for sure it was going to be paella . 
  i do n't fancy rice too much so i would have choose '' [ jam\u00f3n iberico ] ( http://www.mandicplace.com/archivos_web/image/ibericos3.jpg ) '' and fuck the police , it 's not even a dish and we kind of share it with the portuguese but i do n't care . 
  the caliphate of cordoba is the only time when islamic spain was peacefull , and it lasted two generations before collapsing . 
  then they became `` reinos de taifas '' ( taifa 's kingdoms , where taifa is islamic kingdom , so islamic kingdom ' kingdoms ) which became a 1000 year old idiom in spanish for a multisided conflict . 
  not peacefull at all . 
  my salary , i 'm pretty ok with my life except for that . 
  but i guess we are talking more of a geopolitical thing , so i would change the 2 spains mentality that the last civil war left . 
  without that i think we could fight corruption by our own , which is the second biggest problem . 
  renaissance was pretty good too , going hammer on people it 's not a must . 
  about the german rulers , the dinasty was austrian yes , but the first one charles v , was half spaniard , half german and his son philip ii 1/4 . 
  i cringe everytime i heard about the spanish habsburg being germans , they were direct descendants of the catholic monarchs . 
  and you do n't know the half of it . 
  it 's the fucking sat , ca n't get more comical , i hope for a disproportionate response from gilbraltar authorities . 
  ( even though it 's tax haven , sort of ), 
  so no kingdom and not united ? 
  yeah but it job prospects will come even if you are bad at it . 
  whelp , i did n't expect r/europe to think this way to be honest . 
  i 'm an atheist , i do n't have any kind of problem with abortion but still i acknowledge that there is a moral question about it ( beyond religion ) , wich results are anything but trivial for the ones who belive is wrong . 
  ( unlike the dogs in muslims cabbies ) so i think a mechanism of conscientious objection for public institutions is in order . 
  most certainly . 
  since ` x ' in spanish used to be pronounced like nowdays ` j' which is similar as the english ` h ' ( mexico = mejico = mehico . 
  anyone ? ), 
  but `` xeno - '' , it 's scientific wording , while `` ajeno '' is an everyday word for things or concepts that are not your own . 
  the `` xeno - '' prefix has this `` unknown '' or `` unfamiliar '' sense to it , at least in spanish . 
  edit : but nice catch , i 've never noticed and it 's my language . 
  i would say that it 's because in usa 's case , there is this perception that any foreinger could become extremely succesfull , that no other country really has it . 
  that 's why the us triples the next ones , which are other english speaking countries associates with them . 
  that 's what i thought `` cringe '' means , but i 've seen them using that word for gore on movies ( game of thrones to be exactly ) so it seems it 's more like `` uncomfortable '' . 
  it 's not really `` verguenza ajena '' . 
  and btw , i do n't think they have a word for `` ajeno/a '' it would mean like `` someone else 's '' , `` foreign '' , `` not related to you '' or something like that , feel free to correct me if i 'm wrong, 
  yup , that 's how you discredit feasible theories, 
  you can have as a neighbor a smaller mountain nation wihtout the need to anex it , really . 
  i think it 's more like [ this ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pjto7yqljao/tt-rpa0xnfi/aaaaaaaaaiy/nf2asxal2qg/s1600/nursing%2bhome-717588.jpg ), 
  we are talking about religious nut jobs , in the 90 's we had our own freak : [ carlos jes\u00fas ] ( http://rehabilitacionymedicinafisica.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/carlosjesc3bas2.jpg ) he said that he was the reincarnation of jesus christ , that an asteroid would change the rotation of the earth and after 3 days of night 13 million of ships will come from ganimedes to earth to save the humans with the jesus sign ( that he could bestow it upon you for a small fee ) and then they ( the aliens i guess ) will make you younger , immortal and without anus to repoblate the earth which will be wasted by a bactereological war and cleansed by thermo nuclear bombs . 
  he dissapear from the tv but i hope james cameron makes the film though . 
  yes , they go to church on sundays . 
  there is no need to do that for the muslim , they are all back anyway . 
  blocked by my job proxy , reason : adult content . 
  rich prisioners live better than poor students , color me surprised . 
  when i did the 66 route , i spend 3 days and a half in las vegas . 
  it was an awesome and fun place , and suprisingly cheap or if you want to extremely expensive . 
  the luxury was impressive and it was a fun break in the trip . 
  i would go again if it was closer , but i woul n't go to america just for las vegas while i would do that for ny for example .
