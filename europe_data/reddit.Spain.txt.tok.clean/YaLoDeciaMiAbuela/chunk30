  really ? 
  that 's the real world ? 
  let me tell you the real world : the real world is that trump is president of the us , that the far right is on the rise in europe , that the authoritarian regimes like russia go unchecked , that there is more religous fanatism in the world , and that western politicians say whatever they need to get elected . 
  and you are forwarding an article that pretend that a bunch of politicians are making the world better by selling out to fanatics ? 
  we 've had 30 years of walt disney politics and look what they got us . 
  enough bullshit , enough virtue signaling , it is time to take politics seriously and read a book or two instead of your stupid twitter feed . 
   do you think the spanish gov will sort these people out too ? 
  or they do n't matter ? 
  no , they fucking do n't . 
  they are the tax evaders and smugglers i 'm talking about . 
  i do n't have to protect them or their `` 50 % businesses '' based on felonies . 
  and the other 50 % btw is from drug trafficking from morocco , la linea is literally a rogue town not in small part due to gibraltar . 
  i 'm not gon na shed even one tear for that place . 
  also current year and franco are always good arguments , yes . 
  but the border has been closed more time in democracy than with franco , and we only open it because they forced us to enter the eu . 
   they clearly did n't ask for this they kind of do though . 
  under the eu umbrella they 've have pull off some fast ones that i 'm glad they are going to pay now . 
  the airport is one , but i think that closing up the border for good is the most important one we have to do . 
  if they want to be a tax haven , good luck but no access . 
  feminism is great to get you elected , now is time to defend swedish companies . 
  let 's not forget that is a swedish company , ericsson , who is in charge of censorship and surveillance technology for the government of iran , human rights and human decency be damn . 
  i think that would be short sighted from russia , not gon na happen . 
  i dont buy it, 
   not radiation fallout what 's the point then ? 
  so why is fillon good for russia exactly ? 
  im pretty sure he is going to win . 
  and also language , we do n't really know english , and the majority of content in spanish in the internet are angry mexican comments on youtube . 
  so , meh, 
  wait , what ? 
  wars have been declared for less, 
  i 've seen them at work , they piss and then head out of the bathroom , and am i suposse dto grab the door handle afterwards ? 
  but i must warn you i only use soap in the shower and when i 'm going to cook or handle food . 
  when i take a piss i wash my hands with water , rub , rub , but i 'm no using soap , its overestimated . 
  we 've been always more `` fight against '' that `` fight for '' kind of country . 
  and if it is `` fight against ourselves '' that 's where we really excel at . 
  i do n't know obviously but i think the uk will be able to get a deal in which he is still part of the investigation and research cooperation plus with easy access for students and such . 
  i mean i 'm talking out of my ass but we will havce 2 years of negotiations, 
  good timing , there is going to be a lot of those . 
  because this is the type of [ forest ] ( https://i0.wp.com/farm2.static.flickr.com/1367/5148195457_eab1b7a636_z.jpg ) we have in the majority of spain . 
  it is still forest but its not what you think about when you say ` bosque ' as we call this ` campo ' , country land . 
  man , the spanish one looks exactly like a thiner version of a coworker i 'm looking at right now , she is easily the less atractive girl of the room ( of all 5 of them in a room of 30 people , it in a nutshell ladies and gentlemen ) , how times change . 
  anyway , we can all agree that the belgian one got this , right ? 
  no , you do n't understand if they want to patrol the border , good for them , we do n't have to waste our money to reciprocate . 
  and schengen is not the `` free movement of persons '' , so i can still travel to/through france the same way i can go to the uk for now , with just my national identity card . 
  that 's why i said , if that 's what they want to spend their money on , to make me wait 10 minutes at the border , go fucking nuts i do n't care . 
  what i would say is that a real candidate , not those guys of the fn , would serously announce this ludicrous idea is a very sad picture of the pool of voters that has generated in europe for not doing things right . 
  if that 's what the french people want to spend their tax money on , godspeed . 
  we are not doing that though . 
  have fun at the border . 
  i thought i read that in the parliament they will have to explain the brexit plan and that will handicap them in the negotiations with the eu ; but from what i 'm reading now in this thread it does not appear som since it appears is going to be a yay | nay vote . 
  so im with you , i do n't understand why would they go against the rules . 
  of course they are translating it !, 
  what is a `` mad '' ? 
  and why is it ` dog ' ? 
  and the translation is off , since they translated as `` crazy dog '' , i would have go with `` perro cabreado '' to be honest . 
  i wathced the confirmation hearing ( hear it really ) and yeah , a serious person for a serious position . 
  here the press have been very unfair to him and talk mostly about his nick name ( `` perro loco '' sounds way worse in spanish ) , but the man seems smart and responsible with his position ; he clearly is not an extension of trump 's crazyness . 
   in the sense that mostly grumpy old men did this , but it 's the young people who are going to suffer and who have been robbed of a lot of opportunities that is why , for certain things that are irreversible or game changing you usually ask for more than simple majority ; for example in lots of countries you need a double majority to change the constitution . 
  but of course you have to do that before the vote not cry about it after . 
  cameron is out of the picture these days but he was more important for brexit than farage . 
  so yeah , it 's sad when you look at the demographics but i still think that brexit will be a net positive . 
  the picture they have is from a very niche strategy videogame from japan , werewolves vs nazis basically ; with skellies , dragons , hitler and all the other good stuff . 
  operation darkness . 
  you could n't play it in europe at the time , it was region locked and you needed an american xbox to boot it , to my dismay . 
  so this is which national account is most followed in the world . 
  i very much doubt so that ozil is the most followed person in germany but he probably is the most followed german in the world . 
  i must say that all this brexit + trump as a same movement is not going to help their cause in continental europe . 
  and also pretending that a paradigma shift is happening when brexit won by a small margin and trump got 3 million votes less than hillary is scretching it too far . 
  they should let me as negotiator . 
  i would go ; put [ this map ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2012/june/tradoc_149622.jpg ) on a table and say . 
  `` choose color '' spoiler , anything that is not blue or green has tariffs except switzerland who still have free movement of people . 
  [ cuttlefish ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/naturelibrary/images/ic/credit/640x395/s/se/sepia_genus/sepia_genus_1.jpg ) cuthulhu now i know, 
  i 'm also too lazy to search it but i also read that pigs are smarter than dogs , i also think it said that an adult pig is smarter than a 2 year old kid which is the time a human get self awareness . 
  but more than a whale i do n't think so , the only animals who have self awareness in this planet are some primates ( go us ) , whales + dolphis , elephants and crows . 
  that 's it , so that 's where i will draw my moral line . 
  i heard that they are unsure about the octopus , i hope they are not because i 've eaten plenty of those . 
  meh ... from this map we eat : blood pudding/sausage , frog legs , snails , horse meat , tripe soup ( more like a stew really ) , salted pig fat , liver paste and head cheese ( hog head in spanish ) ; and i 've hear about sea urchins before but i 've never saw them in a menu , neither the bull 's testicles but i know they exist . 
  for spain you could also add [ lamb brains ] ( http://xabiergutierrezcocinero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dsc08980.jpg ) , [ fried pig skin ] ( https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/cortezas-del-cerdo-en-el-plato-blanco-34237486.jpg ) or [ bull 's tail ] ( https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-xez1u5czsxq/vmabunao0mi/aaaaaaaaa94/lon5btqyaku/w1018-h844/oxtail.png ) the only thing in the map i would n't eat is the maggot cheese and the testicles . 
  also whatever the turkish one is , since the first image in google is [ this ] ( http://shoebat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/1457646_628243443912015_1171574324_n.jpg ) . 
  the rotten fish doesnt interest me neither but i could try a bite . 
   why we 're the only western country with a system literally designed to circumvent the people 's vote you are not the only one . 
  the uk has a system almost as bad as yours , spanish one is rigged to stop small parties , the greek one give extra votes to the winner , the second round in france can lead to orwellian situations . 
  imho the us has one of the worst , but almost all of them have cheats built in . 
  62 % of remain voters think globalization is a force for good . 
  that is crazy , anti globalization used to be a left movement . 
  i mean , it still is around here , i do n't know what happening in the uk and the us . 
  the comments on this thread ... 
  i want to get off mr. bones ' wild ride, 
   the literal translation of the spanish version of the san escobar 's tweet is : san escobar fully supports poland as candidate ** for the dick ** of the security council . 
  hahaha , that 's funny but not real . 
  it says `` miembro '' which means `` member '' and also `` limb '' ( in english too i think ) , a penis can be called ` the `` virile member '' so in some context `` miembro '' can mean penis , but clearly this is not the case . 
  i will admit that the wording is weird though : `` como candidata para el miembro '' `` as candidate ** for the ** member '' , that is as bad in spanish as it is in english . 
  the first news i read today was : `` why is spain spared from the cold wave that is ravaging europe ? '', 
  thank you azores high . 
  the only trauma i still have from when i was a kid , was when my uncle bought me a toy , i asked my father if i could take it to school he said no but i sneak it in my backpack anyway . 
  then that night he came to my room to check my backpack to see if i put all the textbooks for next day class , and found the toy . 
  he got very angry broke it on my face and trew it to the garbage before i could even play with it once . 
  that is the punishment i recall more lividly , even now as 30y old man , but my father never spanked or hit me , my mother did and i can not remember anything specific from her . 
  this whole trauma because spanking is pretty stupid in my opinion . 
  im not saying i 'm in favor of it , i 'm most certain i will never do it , but i do n't think people who does are literally hitler , that you have to go around making laws about it .
