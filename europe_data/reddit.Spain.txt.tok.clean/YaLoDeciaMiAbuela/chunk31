  i still remember when people here in spain said `` we are european now '' with sarcasm . 
  how the tide has turned . 
  i always like to add the [ density of population map ] ( https://viajeporlascienciassociales.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/densidadpoblacion.gif ) for non spaniards so they can get a better picture . 
  i think that importing problems and try to solved them is a worse solution to do n't import them at all . 
  islam is a garbage that we can live without . 
  self affirmation and propaganda , it was never about us . 
  others might also say that is also hatred , envy or just religious drive, 
   the danish army , which is part of the anti-isis coalition led by the us what a joke, 
  the most disgusting bullshit i 've read in the whole year . 
  this is exactly what i do n't want the left to be . 
  i would start by typifying islam as a dangerous sect or at the very least get the same treatment as scientology which is by far more benign and banned in various eu countries . 
  that would be start . 
  it 's not that i blame the eu , i actually go one step further and i blame germany directly for all the faults of the eu, 
  is there any chance that fn and the ps both get to the second round ? 
  if not i do n't see any chance for le pen , there has to be something i do n't understand for all this `` scary '' le pen news, 
  you need an unanimous vote and spain does n't even recognize kosovo as a country . 
   my friend has spoken at length with them and with the british government ( ehic ) about the situation then he know more than anyone on this sub . 
  it 's as if there were a civil war going on in that country , nuts !, 
  my question is , when did she realized it was a bad idea and denounce it ? 
   eu nationals ` want guarantee they can stay in uk ' or what ? 
  what kind of bargain power do they have ? 
   `` we are not bargaining chips , '' the letter reads . 
  `` we are people . '', 
  of course they are not bargaining chips , they have no value , no sway , i do n't understand this . 
  shifted schedule ? 
  how stupid is that concept . 
  we will still wake up at the same fucking time , one hour later than the rest , you just change the ** made up ** numbers of the timezone , is like cheating at solitaire . 
  how is this bullshit still a thing ? 
  like i do n't really care if they change the numbers , nothing will change , is just that is so intellectually dishonest it infuriates me , how can people be so stupid ? 
  none , this whole concept is absurd , that just because made up social numbers you do more or less work is so fucking stupid . 
  let me explain spain : year | number of immigrants | % of immigrants ** 2000 ** 923.879 ** 2,28 % ** 2001 1.370.657 3,33 % 2002 1.977.946 4,73 % 2003 2.664.168 6,24 % 2004 3.034.326 7,02 % 2005 3.730.610 8,46 % 2006 4.144.166 9,27 % 2007 4.519.554 10,0 % 2008 5.220.600 11,3 % 2009 5.598.691 12,0 % ** 2010 ** 5.747.734 ** 12,2 % ** 2011 5.730.667 12,2 % 2012 5.711.040 12,1 % 2013 5.546.238 11,7 % ** 2014 ** 5.023.487 ** 10,7 % ** this is legal immigrants , illegal usually bumps it a 2 or 3 % more . 
  the flow chart is between 2010-2015 the worst years of the economic crisis here . 
  only women ? 
  edit :  both sexes have the naked checks , and for female staff they are conducted by women . 
  meh , i just lost interest on this `` news '', 
  bullshit like this make conspiracy theories a fucking joke and the real ones get away with it . 
  it 's crazy that we come to a point where people will believe every of them , or none at all . 
  better movies, 
  so i was more sympathetic to the ` si ' because eliminating the spanish senate is a sexual fantasy of mine but i understand i can not compare the situations and i do n't know enough about the italian referendum to position myself . 
  still i see the left shooting itself in the foot and i keep wondering if this has become the norm . 
  i choose pannetone but i wo n't eat the dryed fruit . 
  i am a contrarian like that . 
  he really does , it 's still hard to believe that the republicans chose him as their candidate , it really makes you think . 
   ... ai into sentience so far . 
  i stopped reading after that . 
  that 's one way to put it . 
  another one is that american companies invest heavily in english speaking countries with access to cheap educated labor . 
  but whatever floats your boat, 
   german islamist spy of spanish descent gay porn actor that works as a banker i do n't know if its news or a new movie from almodovar . 
  to be honest i do n't need an `` illegal israel settlement '' label , just tell me if the product comes from the middle east and i will try to avoid it . 
  yeah it 's a very emotional ad , his grandaughter will never speak his language , really sad . 
  you are completly right , the agents of the state should n't have a said in whether you want to kill yourself or not . 
  or was n't that what you were saying : ^ ), 
  if there is something we need to learn from 2016 is that trolling win votes . 
  that is what this is , do n't get it wrong , it 's not about the funds . 
  there are various forms and i would say that each person has his greeting of choice . 
  i say `` buenas '' which is like `` good ... everything '' , day , afternoon , holiday , year , to meet you , whatever . 
  its short , it works in every occasion , it 's affable without inviting to conversation neither denying it . 
  i want a `` hide brexit threads '' button, 
   and she could use this argument as a answer not really , because nato is not popular here . 
  i 'm with you actually , but let me play devil 's advocate . 
  there is 28 eu countries , that 's 4x7 , so you make 4 divisions of 7 countries , and you give the top of the class a premium color . 
  its just bad luck that uk was the 8th . 
  so it 's not that far fetched , even though i do n't buy it for a moment, 
  i have nothing good to say about the people i know who play chess seriously , and some are family, 
  i 'm going to riot if there is no wall, 
  there is no `` objective truth '' in any media . 
  everybody knows exaclty what propaganda each newspaper is trying to feed the population . 
  the same with rt. 
  this resolution makes no sense . 
  there are some decent salaries and there is plenty of jobs , but there is not a plentifull of decent salaries in it, 
  info wars is a pretty fun channel but you are not supossed to believe it mate . 
  i myself have not strong feeling one way or the other so looking at this for a democratic standpoint what i see is this : for people like me that is not comfortable making big decission with a simple majority ( like brexit for example ) , if we do n't count the uk votes and we only weight the ** yes ** vs ** no ** we have a 63-37 % , close to the 2/3 but not quite . 
  also , these countries have more votes against that in favor : denmark sweden finland germany austria greece ireland so , with this landscape i do n't think it should be done , if you want it you need to convince more people ( up to two thirds ) and more countries ( all the euro countries at the very least ), 
  i understand that if the victim does n't want to marry her rapist it 's not forces upon her . 
  meh , small numbers in small population anything can bump this graphs . 
  i think you are reading too much into it . 
  yes , nice !, 
  the reselient , the strong , the ones with nothing to lose , the ones who wo n't stop for nothing . 
  those are the ones you want to come here with you softened by your commodities , and educated in tolerance and kindness . 
  good trick really , ca n't wait to see how it ends . 
  europe migration policy right now is : we let you die on the sea , we let the mafias profit from your misery but if you make it here , then we will let you stay and we will take care of you even though people here do n't really like you . 
  its like the worst possible system you could have . 
  i said this a million times ; or you send ships to bring the needy or you do n't let anyone stay ; the middle ground is a mess , absurd and criminal really . 
  orange bar is bullshit though we should rank higher, 
  i 'm also against these laws to ban guns but your way to debate this is pretty stupid but whatever idc . 
  what really stroke me is this pearl :  `` in addition there are almost no border controls on the external border of schengen . 
  if hunderds of thousands illegal immigrans can cross the border , than illegal firearms can flow across '' is people really that ignorant about what is happening at the borders and about immigration ? 
  i do n't see anyone sharing my opinion in the comments so here it goes for the record . 
  i do n't care . 
  it says clearly ** native speakers ** in the title as well a in the article it says ** mother tongue ** i do n't know if the numbers are right , but these comments !, 
  swear to god . 
  it says clearly ** mother tongue ** , i do n't know if the numbers are right but i do n't think you understand what they are showing . 
  i always find funny how the name caesaraugusta decayed into zaragoza, 
  i have a question though . 
  who is the bleeding heart that goes around denouncing tourists for the stupid shit they do on their photos . 
  sure is illegal , whatever , but who goes to the police for that ? 
  so putting aside the race baiting and identity politics and all that stuff ; is that video supposed to be deep ? 
  i do n't know i find it pretty dumb . 
  look , we just want to ** learn ** what it taste like , for scientific purposes .
