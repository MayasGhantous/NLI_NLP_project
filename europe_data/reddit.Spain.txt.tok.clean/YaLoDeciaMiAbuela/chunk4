   at least they have oil . 
  and they sell it for dollars ... 
  we are going 10 years back in time though, 
   `` donde mahoma perdio el gorro '' : where mohammed lost his hat . 
  no , i do n't understand it either ... that 's kind of unusual , the most common on that format is : `` donde cristo perdio el mechero '' `` where ( jesus ) christ lost his lighter '' but still in spain the most usual thing to say is `` a tomar por culo '' ; `` where they fuck you in the ass '' ?? ... 
  i do n't really know how to translate that , and is used to point something far away or to just say `` go fuck yourself '' and about places , it changes a lot depending in what region of spain you are , where i 'm from , sebastopol ( sevastopol ) is the most usual one i think . 
  `` sergio ramos mando el balon a sebastopol '' - [ `` sergio ramos sent the ball to sevastopol '' ] ( http://www.whoateallthepies.tv/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ramos.gif ), 
  yeah , like serioulsy , if you are not blonde or pale skinned you are risking it , the `` white '' standard could change overnight . 
  man , internet is full of swedish action . 
  a neoliberal will tell you that it was n't liberal enough . 
  check, 
   looks interesting not really it 's just like any game of thrones chart , family names and titles ... 
   which are way more valuavel than german unless you want a job ... but in all seriousness , who wants one of those \u30c4, 
  that 's scary ... what about `` the definitely not nazi fourth reich '', 
  since nobel prizes are considered i call this index bullshit . 
  edit : wait what ? 
  spain in the bottom 5 for international peace and security , what the actual fuck is this shit ??? 
  and number 1 in health and wellbeign ? 
  what 's going on here ? 
  `` holy islamic republic of europe '' or just `` europistan '', 
  yeah , seriously , use is reserved for the future united states of earth , jesus !!, 
  if the referendum is held ( doubtfull ) the result are going to be 90 % in favor with a turnout below 50 % . 
  and the royalist pig-dogs wo n't be worried at all . 
  am i seeing a `` white '' guy with an argentina football shirt ? 
  oh wow , i feel retarded , i thought they were two different places . 
   that can be easilly closed . 
  but wo n't, 
  not really , i always go with the `` spaniard '' thing , i 'm ready to clarify it as european if needed be but i 've never had to , not even in america . 
   but it loses manchester city striker david silva , whose mother is from japan ** and whose father is from the canary islands . 
  ** wtf !, 
  i remember the : - `` there is a spanish song number 1 in america '' . 
  - `` really ? 
  which one ? 
  andalusians , close enough, 
   but logically i support it . 
  what 's the logic in it ? 
  is it the destiny or the objective of the human race to become more intelligent , better , more productive or something ? 
  eugenicists talk like they know the meaning of life and shit . 
  leave the people in peace to make the most of their lifes and shut up ; you are dead meat anyway . 
   let 's not forget that spain executed more than 100000 innocent civilians in the thirties . 
  i do n't, 
  i 'm impressed !, 
  this is what my code looks like when [ i 'm working ] ( http://www.styleite.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/reddit2.jpg ), 
  i do n't know . 
  ask [ the locals ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4136/4883372463_382a7280bf_z.jpg ) what do they think of this melting pot . 
   remember this : brazil is * huge * and full of terrors, 
   anyone with a historical understanding of the war knows removing any of the major allied contributions will result in a lost war tl : dr everyone who disagrees with my hypotetical `` what if ... ? '', 
  knows nothing about history . . way to go . 
  also the question ( which is pretty clear `` which nation contributed the most ? '' ), 
  is about the perception of the people back then and 70 years of american films later . 
   overall `` spanish '' culture . 
  i would like to know what is that overall `` spanish '' culture ; as a madrile\u00f1o i hope is not bullfighting , flamenco and siesta . 
  because i 've never done any of that and i have my 8 castillian surnames , 
  exaclty, 
  and franco comes to the conversation ... seriously people , any country big enough have dubbing . 
  you probably do n't speak to old people, 
  not with that attitude, 
  one day every ~ 30 years !!, 
  the dream is real . 
  [ the first rule of the fight club ] ( http://www.flascinder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/fight-club-de-la-lucha-rey-de-espa%c3%b1a-flascinder1.jpg ), 
  campechano, 
  at least in spain is the range of people who will pay pensions all their life but get none . 
  go home iceland , you are drunk . 
  what about `` national pride , world wide '', 
  in highschool i did a student exchange to france ( chinon to be exactly ) and the french family i lived with , they always give me a sandwich before school . 
  it became a ritual when we , all the spanish students , gather in the break to open the sandwiches and start picking out the butter slices to the surprise of the french . 
  one day i received a sandwich with just butter and cheese and i told my french family that this could n't go on ; remove butter from the premises !, 
  butter is ok for cooking though . 
  probably because there is none below 100 , but they should have shown that in the legend, 
  oh look , south europeans ca n't be expats . 
  when talking spanish i never refer spanish as `` espa\u00f1ol '' , i always say `` castellano '' , castilian ( and a lot of latin americans does that too , not just spaniards ) there is people still rooting for calling it just `` castellano '' but you can use both really . 
  congratulations crackovia , that 's actually very smart . 
  older version of football players who have already won everything there is to win . 
  i predict france 2002 but i have enjoyed the run so far . 
   so why do we worry about the far-right , and not the far-left , when both are horrendous ? 
  short answer , because at least far left is not xenophobic, 
  whenever something bad happens in spanish elections i used to say : `` whelp at least we are not italy '' now what ? 
  in my city we only received sex tourism . 
  yes , i mean erasmus . 
   southern european nations by forcing them to fix their economies and giving them bailouts . 
  economies fixed = 0 , just austerity to make sure the debt is paid back while the economy goes down . 
  the bailout to avoid the possible default which will hurt foreign lenders . 
  khthon is wrong putting the blame on the germans , but there is also no room for `` high horsing '' ( if that 's not a word i 'm claiming it now ) and tell us that they are helping our economy . 
  gross, 
  spanish troll pretending to be a catalan independentist ? 
   we need smart , inteligent and educated people here not the opposite . 
  debatable, 
  islam is not only believing in a magical grandpa . 
  it compromises behaviour and moral values . 
  well if the minister of finance is asking i do n't see why not . 
  i helped the nigerian prince once . 
  ah the uk , the turk 's head for every unpopular decision that the eu actually wants to make . 
  so yellow vs blue , and whoever wins goes against brown in winter so at the end green wins because island ? 
  3 artistas polacos, 
   lack of a unified military / defence force -  difficult to project meh . . 
  i think you left out the most important one , population ageing . 
  mmm it looks like english does not have a clear word for [ victimismo ] ( http://diccionario.reverso.net/espanol-ingles/victimismo ) i wo n't comment then, 
  i would n't say cultures , but expectations , if you look at mexico 's bars it shows they are discontented with everything as much as an estonian , but they have a high life satisfaction . 
  that 's why greece , portugal , etc are so low after the crisis and also the austerity , even though their countries are still in better shape than other happier ones . 
  that we have a `` lisp '' .
