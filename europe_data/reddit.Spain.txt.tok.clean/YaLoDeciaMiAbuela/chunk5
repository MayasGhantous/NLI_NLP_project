  we do n't have a lisp we do n't say ethpa\u00f1a , we can pronounce the 's ' perfectly thank you . 
  we change the pronounciation of some letters centuries ago and it was decided that c and z was to be pronounced like the greek theta . 
  but that was done before teaching americans spanish, 
  officially 10th place - public 17th place . 
  nice !, 
  the jury gave us almost 3 times the votes public gave us . 
  i have n't heard spain song actually , i only follow the votes , they are hilarious, 
  whelp they did n't save ** us ** so thanks for nothing soviets . 
   then why not advocate leaving nato ? 
  the purpose of it is collective defence , and if a country feels it is getting nothing out of it i think that is more a reason to leave than not meet the agreed threshold . 
  i 'm a little late to answer but whatever . 
  about what i quoted . 
  i 'm ok with spain helping other western nations if needed be , even if we do n't really get nothing out of nato , but having to waste money with no real purpose because of it , no so much . 
  and that 's why nato is what it is , and nobody really complains . 
  never heard that actually , but i would bet that almost half of that 5 % blue are swedes or other scandinavian ... we , on the other hand have almost as much `` reds '' as norway total . 
  edit - i think this needs a clarification : i 'm talking about the view of norway as not homogenous which i think you really are . 
  i 'm not discussing the reasons of the economical and social success of the country . 
   and the 2 % figure is hardly a figure the us pulled out of their ass to bully the european nations , it was something that was agreed upon . 
  different contexts . 
  you guys use your military to project influence into the world , that 's ok ( i guess ... ) but the rest of us do n't and there is no sense in spending more money in shit to just store it away . 
  this is just the military industry lobbying because the crimea crisis give them a good excuse . 
  as a spaniard i think we are doing more than enough to contribute to nato since we get no global influence , nor security since we have no threats . 
  it 's really about foreigners though . 
  spain usually votes for romania , uk , portugal and germany . 
  if you look what europeans are the most numerous in spain ... 
  surprise !, 
  nice analisis but about the second point . 
  the bolliviarian alliance is a joke . 
  it 's just venezuela teaming up with smaller countries trying to get a better play in sa . 
  the big south american nations are out of that shite . 
  if mexican spanish is the alternative , i will root for chinese or something ... 
   as long as english has the ~ ~ combined prominence , in ~ ~ us ~ ~ , uk , australia , india and most of europe , ~ ~ its not going away for a long time . 
  there are some novels that can give very different feelings about spanish literature so i prefer if other spaniard point out ** `` the novel that foreigners should read '' ** too much presure for me . 
  but just for enjoyment , i think `` the dumas club '' could be interesting to read for any foreigner , is about a book hunter/searcher ( ? ), 
  that works on `` two books '' ( a satanic one and a dumas one ) ... shit happens , and he does n't know which one is the cause . 
  it 's from a modern writer , p\u00e9rez-reverte , he is a total douchebag , but i really like his soft novels ... and some of his twitters : `` i 've spent two hours killing russians '' ( call of duty ) i also want to mention `` the house of the spirits '' of isabel allende not european but argentinian , ( but argentina is europe right ? 
  ) , which is very `` thepillarsoftheearth `` ish but with colonialism , ouija and shit , it 's very enjoyable . 
  i came here expecting to have read lots of the books mentioned . 
  and the only one i 've read is `` gulliver 's travels '' and mostly because `` la puta '' in my defense i would say we have lots of good novels in spain , and half a continent writing in spanish too ; i still expect a russian mentioning `` crime and punishment '' though , it 's my favorite . 
  source : gypsy palm reader, 
  do you need a viking to tell you ? 
  i mean , i always knew i was loud . 
  it is how it is ... 
  also the division is in both things ; trust given and trust received . 
  this time was al-qaeda vs al-qaeda drop out . 
  hezbollah is not jihadist . 
  he is a fucking aussie , it 's not like we are talking about a chinese or a tanzanian . 
  he is from a country with a heavy european background already . 
  source ? 
  castillian  spanish  romance european  south european ~ = western  christian background ( i 'm an atheist but religion background is kinda of important for values and culture )  earthling to me the whole eu thing so far east is a little meh , cool but meh . 
  if you were to ask me whom i feel much closer to , an argentinian or a polish the answer is kind of obvious , and i loved poland and gda\u0144sk when i was there . 
  that 's not the purpose of the eu , but to take the fragmented countries of europe to form a block that is able to play in a world of usas , chinas , russias and such . 
  metta world peace is just a basketball player . 
  seriously , do n't look at the pretty colors and look at the legend the lightest blue is '' < 1 '' and asturias blue is `` 1.5 - 2.49 '' . 
  yeah that 's exaclty what is happening in this map , right ? 
  it looks like a latin origin word ; in spanish is `` patr\u00f3n '' from the latin patronus which also meant prototype and such ... 
  baby steps , at least i did n't write `` ocuod '', 
  i do n't agree . 
  `` akward '' is a big word that covers too many meanings . 
  akward can mean clumsy , uncomfortable or embarrasing for example . 
  it 's pretty hard when translating words to conserve all their meanings , in english , in french or in chinese . 
  imo akward can be perfectly translated in each context without losing meaning . 
  what the women look is too tan ; it 's like the opposite of the rest of the world , pale males , tan females . 
  also , very sunny photos , never been in sweden , but i spent almost a month in berlin and did n't get to see the sun in all that time . 
  im always so skeptical when i see photos of northen green sceneries bathed by the sun . 
   `` ei guys look how we have done ... injected massive amounts of dollars in the economy and now we aren \u00b4 t bankrupted '' if you got the aircraft carriers to support it i do n't see the problem, 
  the same link you provided is the one that says that the data was goten from each contruy , right at the bottom ... 
  anyway it does not matter because that was n't my point . 
  what i meant is that you should present your data better if you want a real discussion , and dont pile up the number that suits you to make another post of murica !, 
  against eu . 
  also not cool to throw spain numbers at my face ; like i have something to do with it , or make my point less valid . 
   we 'll soon be reaching a stage where violent riots are going to become standard practise in demonstrations across the country nah, 
  i do n't know much about this theme but ... do n't you think the numbers you are comparing do n't match with each other . 
  i mean , you have gone back to the 1980 to take the number for the us ( the 3 million figure i do n't see it ) and you compare it with the ones living in europe right now . 
  then you compare the rejection rate between the us with the whole eu , which makes no sense , because the same guy usually applies for several nations in europe ; meaning one guy can get 5 rejections while he can get only one acceptance . 
  i do n't know i could be wrong and i did n't understand it well , but i think you should give this a thought , or present better those statics . 
  let me be a little bit douchy : so the strategy was to convince russia to attack easier countries , and wait for other nations to save the day . 
  i still do n't understand why sweden and specially finland do n't join nato , when they are already benefiting from its existance . 
   also , who 'd stop them ? 
  nato wo n't lift a finger . 
  of course they will , this statment is getting repetitive and boring lately . 
  we have our hands full with our christianity , pls do n't add an even more backward religion , thank you . 
  playing ck2 right now with a finnish tribe , ca n't wait to form the kingdom of finlad and get that magnificient lion as my coa . 
  that 's it , if the swedes and the russians with that bullshit alliance of theirs leave me the fuck alone for a little while . 
   it 's all over the western countries , is n't it ? 
  not in spain , but then again people put us out of the west sometimes . 
  anyway we have a prank day the 28th of december `` el dia de los santos inocentes '' which commemorates [ this scary shit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacre_of_the_innocents#feast_days ) many jokes that day , see ... 
  born in spain with spanish origins yes ; but she is french , really . 
   the catholics in the west also commited genocide on us , no one remembers that . 
  we tried to defend our people both from the west and from catholic slavs and we 're the bad guys ? 
   the west is consistently trying to destroy slavs ( and the orthodox culture ) the catholics !?!, 
  in what world are you living in , muchacho ? 
  ok , just a little more centuries to go and we will have our own tv show on history channel . 
  exactly , i 'm a lazy slacker redditing from work . 
  but i do n't represent my country goddamit . 
  ... because i have a job . 
  not true !, 
  so gypsy is now offensive ? 
  that 's what they call themselves here in spain . 
  `` gitano '' or `` cal\u00e9 '',
