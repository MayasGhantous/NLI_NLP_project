  debatable, 
  have you seen youtube ? 
  it 's ok to have a beheading or some guy eating a human heart , but do n't you dare to show a nipple . 
  ** la mancha : ** rednecks, 
  it was surprising , when we were there , we hanged out with some irish guys , and they challenged me to bring some girls to the group . 
  so i just went to a group of good looking girls grabbed one and carry her on my shoulder ; she started yelling , punching and kicking , i could n't even finish the joke because she actually kick me very hard and i had to let her go . 
  when she saw she hurt me she started apologizing , which i find very funny , i could have been a kidnapper for all she knew . 
  i had a really good time in the euro , and also we won the damn thing . 
   gdansk / seaside : bad mannered such high standards , i 've been there a week in the euro2012 and it seemed like they apologized for everything if it was n't perfect . 
  there was a girl that even apologized to me for hitting and kicking me repeatedly . 
   television in denmark is rubbish national tragedy !, 
  how is this important ? 
  why do the brits think this is an issue ? 
  tv is rubish , you have to be very idle and bored to waste your time on that shit . 
  i would say serbia and montenegro at the same time . 
  and depending what happens , ukraine in the far future . 
  apart from that , i do n't see norway , switzerland or iceland joining in unless the world stage changes ( what it usually does ) . 
  and i also do n't see the other islamic countries entering , one or another country will veto them , with 28 nation , they can take turns if necesary . 
  the ussr does not count . 
  ( that includes belarus ) and that 's it , that 's europe endgame . 
  will they succeed before collapsing ? 
  stay tuned . 
  sorry , i did n't mean to troll . 
  people usually take advantage of these speculative scenarios to push their political/social beliefs without the need of any proof to back it up , and with the safety that they ca n't be refuted . 
  so in the end , the `` what if ? '', 
  transform itself in a `` i 'm a x '' and this is what would have happened according my beliefs . 
  that 's why i dislike them . 
  i think it is because the legitimacy that calling yourself macedonia will give you like claiming north greece , or calling your language macedonian when it is some kind of bulgarian , etc. 
  to me macedonia is just a [ fruit salad . 
  ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonia_de_frutas ), 
  i hate `` what if ? 
  you know the gema direction ; the opposite way . 
  amost the same exact titles [ as our friend juancar . 
  ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/juan_carlos_i_de_espa%c3%b1a ) ----------------------------------------- king of castile , of le\u00f3n , ** of aragon , of the two sicilies * ( naples and sicily ) , of jerusalem * , of navarre ** , of granada , of toledo , of valencia , of galicia , of majorca , of seville , of sardinia * , of c\u00f3rdoba , of corsica * , of murcia , of menorca , of ja\u00e9n , of the algarves * , of algeciras , of the canary islands , of the east indies * and west indies * and of the islands and mainland of the ocean sea * ; ------------------------- and catalunya has an autonomy , so they were as independent as today . 
  i said `` the king of spain and portugal '' because that was the name he went when he inherited portugal , to explain to you how castille , aragon and navarre was already considered spain and not portugal . 
  i was n't counting titles . 
  it 's kinda of pathetic that half of catalunya nowdays belive in the shit you are saying . 
  there are good reasons to proclaim independence without twisting history . 
  also i 'm not going to keep discussing this . 
  believe what you want . 
   wrong !, 
  spain did n't exist as a such until 1716 sure , that 's why philip ii was called king of spain and portugal and not king of castille , aragon and portugal . 
  nobody is saying that aragon or navarra did n't have some autonomy , but saying that spain did n't exist until the spanish succession war ( that people is trying to call seccession war o_o ) is just propaganda . 
  if you want catalunya to be independant tell good reasons like differences in culture , customs , feeling of nationalism . 
  but historical reasons based on feudal kings territories is stupid if you think about it . 
  maybe play good cop , bad cop ? 
  the us threatens and the eu offers a cup of coffee p.s. 
  i feel like i should n't be joking though, 
   and superfluous letters that do n't mean anything ... 
  they are not superfluous goddamit !, 
  first time i 've heard of this shit . 
  cute, 
  i think the trick is in the exchange rate to $ ; we got 1,37 while finland for example has 1.25 . if we had the same ratio we will have 200 $ less . 
  i understand that the data was taken at diferent times but at least take the same $ to $ exchange . 
  apart from that , 1615 $ in average it 's ok , maybe a little high this days , the real problem of spain is not the wage is the high unemployment, 
   but i do n't know , back then , the guys coming back from fighting franco might very well have been labelled as terrorists too . 
  i think you are not too far off . 
  my great grandfather was a dutch that came here to fight in the civil war and then have some problems to go back because something like that . 
  he stayed in spain for a while and tried to get to france with my great grandmother but did n't make it . 
  at least he left my grandmother with an exotic surname though . 
  but i still think that if someone has gone to fight in the syrian war , it 's a giveaway that he is a jihadist . 
  or more but the thing is , it happens more often in english because of that . 
  in my opinion it 's a pointless question , people tend to think : + words = + vocabulary + vocabulary = + meanings so + words = + meanings . 
  english best of the world . 
  vocabulary is everything not only words , meanings can be achieved by all kind of means apart from words ( conjugations , affixes , polysemous words , etc ) . 
  so you ca n't go around saying your language is more rich because you have a bigger dictionary . 
   if it has to be english or nothing , i 'd agree to english . 
  i 'd agree to nothing, 
  that purple thing in sweden looks scary ( 10 degrees less than the green ) . 
  does someone live there ? 
   introduce english as an additional official language in all eu countries . 
  nope, 
  but that 's an insult right ? 
  it 's to offend . 
  in that case we switch to `` me cago en tus muertos '' that would be `` i shit on your dead relatives '', 
  ukraine is a democracy right ? 
  i mean you can vote , and you are not kept in total ignnorance . 
  there is no legitimate reason to `` step in '', 
  i think in spain we still have some kinda of blasphemy law that also protect atheism , i think . 
  but it 's not really enforced ... like really , the number 2 swearing quote in spanish is `` i shit on god '', 
   rajoy told members of the u.s. chamber of commerce in washington . 
  `` it 's the axis of a vigorous , healthy and long-lasting economy . '' i remember half and a year ago when the bonds were all time high , he was saying that the bonds were not representative of the state of the economy . 
  does n't europe stop at the urals ? 
  i think there is not that big of a mistake . 
  i would say that because the absurd idea of religion = culture that is often protrayed in the media we are surprised about this . 
  i 'm an atheist , not even agnostic , but if someone call me christian , i would probably comply ( do n't call me catholic though ) because religion has set a scale of values ( is that english ? ), 
  and morality rules in europe . 
  again morality it 's not just `` culture '' , and it 's only normal that you would prefer immigrants with a similar set of values , christians or not . 
  about the eastern immigrants , we all know that when people say `` romanian '' or `` bulgarian '' they are really saying `` gypsies '' whom have quite a `` peculiar '' culture . 
  in murica maybe ... just maybe . 
  but in the uk ? 
  a relatively small country with a population density 10 times higher ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  europe should stay away from that shit . 
   you are a sunni woman . 
  pretty hard for an atheist male to put myself on that shoes . 
  what are you talking about , the main article in the front page is `` j.k. rowling recorded two dubstep albums as burial '', 
  i was so suspicious the first time someone gave me that toy money . 
  fuck it !, 
  lets be [ honest ] ( http://www.que.es/archivos/201007/iniesta-gol-reutersnormal-365xxx80.jpg ),
