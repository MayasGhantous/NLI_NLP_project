  it is going to turn into a thread against banks not against islam . 
  a guy that lose body parts in every battle . 
  spanish heroes usually have to be prepotent and insult the king , like `` el cid '' or `` el gran capit\u00e1n '' though . 
  we are/were a hardcore catholic nation so boring people like monks , bishops , missionaries were more regarded than soldiers . 
  i do n't understand , if the euro dies , every country will switch to their own currency thus the debt since there is no euro and whoever has too much debt will start printing . 
  how is that sound money ? 
  ok now i 'm getting the picture using the translator i always thougt that : strawberry = fresa so : wild strawberry = frambuesa wrong !, 
  also blueberry = ar\u00e1ndano azul ( blue ) cranberry = ar\u00e1ndano rojo ( red ) which does not help either . 
   raspberries , brambles or blaeberries whenever i see the anglos talking about berries i have no fucking clue what they mean . 
  [ pls have mercy ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/brambleberries.svg ) [ fresas ] ( http://www.puraproteina.com.es/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/la-fresa-un-alimento-hidratante-y-protector.jpg ) y [ moras ( moors ) ] ( http://www.catalunyaplants.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/zarzamora-moras-en-la-planta.jpg ) thats all i know . 
  we have a lot of sweet desserts that will met this criteria , but since the origins will be discussed a lot with italians , frenchies and such ( flan , mazapan , crema catalana ) lets go for something iberian even though i 'm not a real fan of it . 
  [ carne de membrillo ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ew9cjfp174e/tm-zpbhcrni/aaaaaaaaamo/zqswvgvaehc/s1600/portada.jpg ) i have n't eaten it for a while but i usually take it with cheese like a sandwich . 
  [ example ] ( http://www.velocidadcuchara.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/membrillo-con-tmx.png ), 
  oh , i 've also watch that film , i didnt recognise it at first because it was called `` sonrisas y lagrimas '' ( smiles and tears ) in spain . 
  it 's carrefour which is french btw . 
  the security firm is casesa which is in the [ logo on the back of the guards ] ( http://www.wikiblues.net/sites/default/files/upload/promo%20turismo.jpg ) , but it 's censored in the video for whatever reason . 
  edit : here . 
  [ the uncensored version ] ( http://www.diarioinformacion.com/sucesos/2014/01/08/turistas-denuncian-agresion-vigilantes-gran/1455659.html ), 
  mind you that with the new law for private security , we are giving more autority power to those suckers ; enjoy !, 
  i just saw the pictures and they are beatiful but as the title says ; `` summer holiday '' you should be showing beaches and bitches and not woods and snow . 
  that the pillars of hercules should be in the union jack not in the spanish coa, 
  everything i 've read about this guy in the spanish press it 's so extreme that makes me think there is really a campaign against him . 
  the somalians did n't chose , there were a lot of somalian refugees and norway , sweden and i think the netherlands accepted to grant them asylum in their countries . 
  nowdays i guess is just the natural call , since there are somalians already living there . 
  in spain our habsburg kings , were called `` the austrias '' , and even though they were originally half austrians , they were mostly regarded as germans because the hre in spanish were called `` sacro imperio romano germanico '' or just `` sacro imperio alem\u00e1n '' holy ( roman ) german empire where the roman word is just a religious adjective ( and not even used that much ) . 
  then austria is not mentioned until wwi basically , we just keep tabs on uk , france , portugal and a little of italy . 
  every fucking time . 
  you may have resources untaped , let me ( sometimes `` pay me to '' ) do some digging with a very low chance that we find somthihng while fucking up the enviroment , you are bankrupt but this could save you . 
  i think the only leaders of other nations that got mentioned in school , was napoleon , von bismarck , henry viii because the religion thingy and ww2 leaders . 
  that does not mean that we do n't study foreign history , is that we do n't focus at all in whose king/emperor/dictator did whatever . 
  imho people like too much the whole personality , celebrity history . 
  i do n't know about the eu but i 'm against those three ocupations : s, 
  everything he said it 's true from a north european perspective , but a lot of those things are also common outside south europe , we are not that weird . 
  even though i get a little upset when they call me/us out because `` staring '' . 
  i 'm just looking or watching , i 'm also breathing is that a problem too ? 
   like when the uk tried to sue google over our citizens data being stolen and retained google said they 'd move the case to the us . 
  then , the uk did n't try much ... 
  it happened to me when i went to the us . 
  i landed on chicago and i did n't need to use my broken english in two days , mexicans galore . 
  things got more merican when i went deeper into the country though . 
  we have some of those here in spain too . 
  but that one has also a heart , so it 's better . 
  we used to have one with a black guy in chains too . 
  i think they changed it or something . 
  i 'm going to look edit : i could n't find it . 
  [ but i had this one also . 
  ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/valenzuela_%28c%c3%b3rdoba%29 ) i read an article about racist simbols in spain that have n't been changed yet , and there were a lot like this . 
  i always have fun when a foreigner comes here and struggles with this custom . 
  seriously people , it 's something automatic and mundane , you should n't givey it two thougths . 
  on a side note , when i was in france , i had to go to a wine a cellar and met with a lot of people , apparently in that region the custom was 4 kisses , i spent half day giving kisses , that 's excesive please . 
  eliminate al qaeda in mali and aid them in syria . 
  no , they are more like the rural police , they are also responsible of the frontiers , coasts and etc. 
  they came for a militar background i think they even sent some of them to fight for the nazis at some point , or something like that . 
  they were usefull some time ago but right now they feel kinda outdated so there is always talks about integrate them into the police force but it never happens . 
   canary islands and spain 's north african enclaves what ?!, 
  our insurance policy does not cover `` las canarias '' , it 's time to search for another provider with more coverage . 
  what 's the number of this `` eu collective defense '' you are talking about ? 
  it has nothing to do with our foreign policy because it 's about the collective defence not the `` defense '' euphemism where you mean `` army '' . 
  but i kinda of agree with cameron , there is nato already about defense so i do n't see the point . 
  on a side note , is there a difference between `` defence '' and `` defense '' ? 
  yeah i meant here in spain , it 's not like we are completly ignorant but if you ask a spaniard where is wales chances are you wo n't like the answer . 
  ( we know scotland because braveheart and trainspotting though ) also , we do n't use the `` great britain '' at all except to swear the infamous : `` hijos de la gran ... breta\u00f1a '' = `` sons of the great ... britain '', 
   as far as i can see the cities are in their respective native languages yup , all the spanish cities are with their real names . 
  feels bad after what we did to `` copenhague '', 
  we call them georgia but with our `` g '' sound , so heorhia anyone ? 
  `` paises bajos '' is just too long , but you are not the only one . 
  who calls the us `` united states of america '' ? 
  and the `` united kingdom '' , everyone here just call them england . 
  uk government under fire , this time for rejecting eu food bank funding . 
  moreover , the `` referendum '' needs to be held to be `` won '', 
   the spanish government ca n't do anything about it short of starting a war they can suspend the autonomy , i think , and the central government takes the power , which at that point i do n't dare to forsee the amount of shit this will bring . 
  did n't use the word `` forced '' . 
  also the bible is a book like the qu ` ran ; the sharia on the other hand is a rule book . 
  also , yes , the christians are supossed to follow their rules as absurd as they are . 
  do n't you really have anything to confuss you ? 
  we are more or less like that , but there are words that unless you know beforehand , you do n't know how to write it like : jirafa-girafa = giraffe harina-arina = flour vaca-baca = cow cacer\u00eda-cazer\u00eda = hunting ( the first one is the right btw ), 
  we can do that too , but do n't stop just at `` small '' we have for `` big '' and a pejorative one perro - dog perrito/perrillo - small dog perrazo/perraco - big dog perrucho - worthless dog ( the word evolved to chucho at the end ), 
  if i could ? 
  do you mean i ca n't if i want to ? 
  yeah , it 's probably a language thing . 
  in spanish we have [ `` v\u00edctima '' for casualty and victim . 
  yeah but this language existed before the latin alphabet was introduced , using letters that exist to represent sounds in other language . 
  spanish on the other hand came directly from latin . 
  anyway what i wanted to say is there is no `` proper '' spanish but the way americans speak it with less sounds , make it more confusing and less diverse , also make their writing more prone to errors ( which you could see if you enter any mexican/colmbian/etc webs ), 
  i reached a point already where i do n't care if the muslim are fundamentalists or not . 
  yeah fundamentalist want to implement the sharia as the law , but that does not mean that the rest of the muslim do n't follow it . 
  that 's what i fear most of our media , they forget to explain that every muslim is supossed to follow it . 
  now , i 'm not going to bother you with examples but you can look sharia for yourselves , there are parts that are n't really up to interpretation that goes against human rights , democracy and tldr , western values . 
  so sorry but i say pls no islam in europe . 
   i learned mexican spanish which uses proper pronunciation til proper pronunciation is having three letters ` c ' 's ' ` z ' with the same sound . 
  also , you just have to see them writing , since they use the same sound they do n't know what letters go in what word , making their writing pathetic and this is not a bigoted opinion is fucking reality . 
  that list looks so random, 
  for what i heard ( rumors yay !! ), 
  the embassy is tired of expats , overloading the embassy for matters that they could solve themselves just by learning a little bit of the language . 
  on the other hand , thinking that retirees are really going to learn a new language when they have n't tried in their whole life is just whishfull thinking . 
  i do n't know about the `` get out '' part . 
  but talking the language to get the citizenship looks reasonable to me . 
   sir stuart rose claims it 's not the fault of bulgarians and romanians if they are prepared to come to the uk and work longer hours , and for less money of course it 's not their fault , is yours . 
  no he said it right :  `` political and cultural hegemonony of the us and israel '' do n't cut parts , i do n't see anything wrong from what he said ; well , m maybe , the part about christian nations maybe ...
