if you call a * billion * euros cost project a mega project , then i guess not only my country is making one but also i 'm working on it . 
  the [ s80 class submarine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s-80-class_submarine ) , which had an initial cost of ~ 2000 million $ for 4 boats , but being a disastrous ( some people would argue that it 's a r&d project , not a failure ) development , it will cost more than those initial * 2 billion * $ just for the first unit ( if it ever gets finished and delivered to the navy ) . 
  in my case : * our top three guesses for your english dialect : 1 . 
  us black vernacular / ebonics 2 . 
  english ( england ) 3 . 
  scottish ( uk ) * * our top three guesses for your native ( first ) language : 1 . 
  german 2 . 
  finnish 3 . 
  english * well , i 'm spanish . 
  but the last language i learnt is german , so i do n't know if i should take it as a compliment . 
  well i use them almost always when texting or twitting . 
  call me old fashioned , but when i write in spanish , i like to adhere to its rules . 
  - spanish ( native ) - english ( good level , same as you ) - german ( i have an oficial c1 level ) - japanese ( took 3 years in college , i did n't starve when i was in japan :-) ), 
  i loved villers-la-ville . 
  bruges is a tourist trap , indeed , but it 's also a beautiful city . 
  useless bloodsuckers . 
  the king of spain 's sister is married to a sentenced felon . 
  enough said . 
  - belgium : westvleteren 12 ( triple karmeliet very close , though ) - germany : paulaner weissbier/kloster andechs/erdinger pikantus - ireland : guinness/kilkenny - spain : alhambra reserva 1915 - scotland : brewdog punk ipa, 
  i just ate a couple of them brought to me yesterday straight from b\u00e9lem . 
  yum indeed !, 
  i try to read at least 1 or 2 books per month . 
  i usually achieve the 12 books/year mark , hardly have time to reach the 24/year mark . 
  i 've just read jim knopf und lukas der lokomotivf\u00fchrer to hone my german skills , and yesterday i began reading stephen king 's it . 
  my first book in 2017 was terry pratchett 's the shepherd crown , after a 2016 in which i almost exclusively read what i had left unread of his books . 
  it felt as a painful farewell , not having any more new books from my favourite writer . 
  friday before holy week starts - viernes de dolores, 
  [ pinchy - * tenacitas in spanish * ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-an8z_ibkelw/u3yfnjmf_ci/aaaaaaaadlo/fpldihwwz2g/s1600/tenacitas.jpg ), 
  from c\u00e1diz ( southern spain ) here . 
  around 3000 years old ( 3100 aprox . ) . 
  according to the locals and wikipedia `` c\u00e1diz is sometimes counted as the most ancient city still standing in western europe '' . 
  i remember watching german subbed swiss moves at my german school . 
  i always thought they were subbed for us , foreign students , until one day our teacher told us they were films subbed for them to be shown in germany o_o . 
  to be honest , the very first episodes of narcos i needed the subs to understand the guys speaking in ** spanish ** , not in english , so every language has its dialects , but i think that 's much more evident in the german language . 
  it 's not that i find the whole akk/dat/gen business difficult , but the ( apparently ) random way each word 's gender is decided . 
  i realice that i 'm biased because spanish is my mother tongue and gender ( with some exceptions ) is pretty straightforward . 
  but i 'm supposed to have a c1 level in german and i 'm sure i will never stop having huge problems with genders . 
  also the amount of verbs that come in the form of ( pr\u00e4position + verb ) that change the meaning of the original verb drives me crazy . 
  apart from that , i love the german language . 
  also from spain , and i 've never ever heard this . 
  scottex is a really well known brand of toilet paper here in spain . 
  all its commercials include a cute labrador puppy . 
  and it 's a scientifically proven fact that labrador puppies are the cutest puppies . 
  right !, 
  i love it :d, 
  i love the viktualienmarkt when it 's sunny outside . 
  grab a masskrug of helles bier , some gurken , leberk\u00e4se and brezel , take a seat and enjoy the life , 
  i 'm torn betwen germany and ireland . 
  i love both countries , would n't hesitate a bit if given the change to move to one of them and live for some years ther . 
  ireland : astonoshing landscape , lovely people , small towns and guinness . 
  germany : superb work culture ( at least , in comparison with spain , and in my branch , sw development ) , great food , multikulti cities . 
  [ scottex ] ( http://www.compraslanzarote.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/_/m/_mg_2990.jpg ) but , seriuosly , a ** neutral ** spanish newspaper ? 
  cold . 
  snow . 
  gorgeous women . 
  i do n't know anything about poland , i 'm afraid . 
  i agree . 
  it 's not a luxury one , but it 's way higher than , say primark . 
  florence   rest of italy , 
   lisbon/madrid/barcelona ( one of the 3 will suffice imho ) then i 'd say barcelona  london/dublin ( again , just one ) if only visiting a city , go for london . 
  if you 're visiting the surroundings , go for dublin . 
  ireland is amazing . 
   paris/nice/strasbourg ( pick two if possible here ! ), 
  paris is beautiful but a bit overrated in my opinion . 
  i 'd rather go north and visit normandy . 
   berlin . 
  do n't you dare miss berlin it 's quintessential for everything ever you 're right there . 
  i would add a visit to m\u00fcnchen . 
  i guess , if people living in germany say so , using cards must be difficult there . 
  i 've been three times in germany and i never ever had any kind of problem paying with cards , though , even in small towns . 
  at least not the cash-hell i experienced when i went to japan . 
  want to know what a cash society is ? 
  go to japan !, 
  what the actual fuck ? 
  it takes me less time to arrive santander , and i live near c\u00e1diz !, 
  right you are !, 
  i forgot to add : - i 'm half asleep and confused all day long . 
  - wake up at 5:55 a.m. - commute to work as a defence/combat systems programmer ( c++ ) - finish my workday at 2:40 p.m. , then commute back home - after lunch i play and take care of my lovely almost 3 years daughter ( boy i love that girl ! ), 
  - as i am currently training for the [ seville marathon ] ( http://www.zurichmaratonsevilla.es/ ) , i go running 5 out of 7 days a week . 
  an hour at least . 
  i live 3 km away from one of the [ most famous beaches ] ( http://www.cadizturismo.com/media/fotos/image_62608_jpeg_640x480_q85.jpg ) in spain , so it 's a really nice place to run . 
  - i bought a house with my wife a year ago that need a hell of a reform ( including chopping a huge amount of trees ) , so currently we 're almost on a daily basis doing something or worrying about it . 
  - i try to cook for the next day and make dinner for my little girl , and feed her . 
  after that , brush her teeth , take a bath with her ( sometimes it 's me , sometimes my wife ) , and put her to sleep telling her some tales . 
  - after she 's asleep ( usually too late , we 're working on it :( ) , i fix myself a quick dinner and watch something on netflix . 
  - finally , go to bed , read a bit , fall asleep . 
  rinse and repeat . 
  my life has changed a lot since we had our daughter and bought a house ( a lot less money and freedom , i do n't have time for gaming anymore , for example ) , but all in all , i have a nice , happy life . 
  there are shadows , troubles and difficulties , but nothing a smile from my wife or daughter can not fix . 
  edited : wrong time format !, 
  be careful not to eat * bolachas baratas *, 
  exactly the same way here in spain . 
  at least , in andaluc\u00eda . 
  idk if the rest of communities handle it the same way . 
  spain here . 
  i take them off ( my so and daughter take them off too ) at home , but i 'm just the weird guy . 
  everybody else keep them on . 
  almost everything means dick in spanish, 
  kudos for your spanish !, 
  in spain , the only thing not measured in metric are screen sizes .
