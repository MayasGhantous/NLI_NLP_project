  but i think that 's almost universal , everybody measure their tv and phone screen in inches . 
  edit : car tires also, 
  dutch sounds like drunken , toothless german . 
  would love to learn it , though , 
  i am spanish and i when i say i like german better than spanish i get a lot of awkward looks from almost everyone . 
  spanish just happens to be my mothertongue as a matter of chance , i just do n't love it :|, 
  i even find irish people nicer compared to those from n. ireland . 
   however , your government is a little bit fucked as of late well , if with a * little bit fucked * you mean corrupt and useless and with `` as of late '' you mean * since the dawn of times * , then you are really optimistic . 
   to fart higher than one 's ass ( p\u00e9ter plus haut que son cul ) that expression has finally conviced me about learning french next year . 
  in spain we say : `` me suda la polla '' = my dick sweats = i do n't give a fuck . 
  wise words, 
  as far as i know , you must use some of your free days to `` build a bridge '' . 
  if you do n't want to spend one day or do n't have enough days off , you must work the in-between days . 
  that 's at least my experience of 12 years working , and pretty much everyone i know that does not work in education . 
  spain . 
  if a public holiday falls on sunday , you get the next monday off . 
  in fact , the whole holiday changes to the next monday , meaning shops , schools , administration and so far are closed . 
  well , i do n't live in a mediterranean part of spain , and i 've only been in the mediterranean sea once in my life , but i 'd say i 'm mediterranean . 
  it has nothing to do with geography , in my opinion . 
  same in spanish : the only time h is pronounced is after a c , then it becomes the sound `` ch '' ( as in english * charming * ) . 
  and it is important : * hola --  hello , but ola --  wave * hora --  hour , but ora --  ( he/she ) prays * hay --  there is/are , but ay --  `` ouch ! '', 
  well , i myself am 38 y.o. , so no , but close enough o_o . 
  nevertheless i do n't pay much attention to the spanish music panorama , so those are the names i know . 
  of course i know the shitty-wide-spread names ( bisbal and such garbage ) , but i ca n't honestly recommend that , lest i cause an international conflict with op . 
  i have 25 paid holidays plus 12 public holidays . 
  by contract i must work 1676 hours/year ( 7h48min/day ) , so i get any day that would excess that as paid vacation . 
  that amounts to 7 additional days this year . 
  compared to a lot of people in my country ( spain ) , i have a lot of vacations , as the vast majority of people only has the minimum amount of holidays : 22 days + 12 public holidays . 
  or it may be worse : 30 `` natural '' days + 12 public holidays . 
  a `` natural '' day means that the weekly non-working days ( usually weekends ) must be substracted from this total . 
  imagine you do n't work on weekends and you want to take a holiday on a friday . 
  if your holidays are measured in `` natural '' days , you do n't take just one ( friday ) but must also take saturday and sunday ( even though you do n't usually work them ) up until the day before you get back to work . 
   otherwise we would have to vote a third time , and nobody wanted that i wanted to vote again . 
  a lot of people wanted to do so . 
  that 's democracy for you . 
  pp , psoe and ciudadanos spared no effort to convince the people of the opposite , though . 
  apart from that , it 's pretty accurate . 
  although i 'm spanish , i do n't like listening music in spanish . 
  one of the few groups i listen once in a while is celtas cortos . 
  based on what my friends listen to , i could recommend you : * vetusta morla * los planetas * fito & fitipaldis * a lot of people like amaral . 
  they make me sick , though . 
  * a lot of people also like extremoduro . 
  i ca n't understand why . 
  not a place you would want to get lost . 
  i lived 11 years a couple of km away and never ever had a problema , though . 
  where i live ( southern spain ) is never too cold . 
  i 've run with temperatures near 0 and rain , you only need to use warmer clothes , gloves ... on the other hand , it is usually too hot to run ( 35-40\u00bac ) . 
  during summer months , i usually have to restrict my training sessions to early in the morning or late in the evening . 
  and even that wo n't do sometimes . 
  as i recall , the commas vs. periods is not a french thing . 
  in spanish , for sure , we use the same ( comma for decimal numbers , periods for thousands , millions ... ) and at least in german they do as well ( correct me if i 'm wrong ) . 
  and a lot of languages have irregular numbers for the 10-20 interval . 
  i felt the same way . 
  complain and go on strike has nothing to do with being lazy workers . 
  i would argue that they tend to be opposite . 
  i envy the willingness the french people have to stand and fight for their rights . 
  that has nothing to do with lazyness . 
  people should stop linking strikes and lazy workers . 
  do you know strikes cost us , workers , money ? 
  do you know it endangers our jobs , that we put ourselves , and our families , in danger when we fight for what we think is fair ? 
  cut the crap , no one 's going to make that `` because they 're lazy '', 
  native : spanish fluent : english good : german basic : japanese, 
  munich and firenze, 
  i 'd say www.infojobs.net, 
  spanish here , i ca n't agree . 
  evoo is used by a lot of people , but sunflower oil is really really common . 
  you 've got to be kidding me if you think using sunflower oil `` is like destroying the food '' . 
  either that , or you do n't go to any restaurant or bar . 
  none is going to use olive oil to cook fries , for instance . 
  it 's way way more expensive and it degrades faster at high temperaturas than other seeds oils . 
  and about the butter , well , you 're right with that one , but in spain a common ingredient in a lot of dishes is pig fat . 
  pig fat . 
  tell me that 's not disgusting and complain about the butter . 
  and about the bread , i do n't know where you live , but bread in spain is frozen precooked rubbish . 
  only a tiny portion of bakeries do n't use that . 
  therefore the 3-4 loafes of bread for 1 $ . 
  with quality bread you ca n't sell at those prices , and that 's the bread the average people eat every day . 
  came here to say that . 
  burn it to ashes . 
  with a nuclear blast . 
  language : spanish moon : europa continent : europa, 
  came here to say exactly that . 
  also , with our current government , error 418 . 
  in 4 months i 'm going to spend nearly 2000 $ in dental care . 
  so same here !, 
  i 'm not very fond of romance languages . 
  a bit tricky , because spanish is my mother tongue o_o . 
  i love the sound of english ( i hate the randomness of its pronunciation ) and german . 
  i would kill to have the chance of learning suomi ( finnish ) . 
  i just love the way it sounds . 
  i would also love to learn irish . 
  i 'm a language freak, 
  i am ashamed to have a spanish passport . 
  so there you go , i 'm the opposite of patriotic . 
  fuck patriotism , nations and borders . 
  they 've done nothing good for people , they 're just a excuse to wage wars and instill fear and hate into people .
