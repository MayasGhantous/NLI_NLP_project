  i live in a university town and i do n't find this shocking at all . 
  in the summer , when the classes are over and everybody return to their home town , there 're only old people and tourists left . 
  this is what happens when nato does n't want to include ceuta and melilla under its protection,

  would you like him to make a fish sausage and claim he did his german bratwurst ? 
  and come on , all the responses are obvious jokes, 
  it 's because of the trials, 
  the uk considers everything that does n't goes its way an economic attack, 
  franco may have closed the border but we did n't open it until we entered the eu , and even podemos wants to close the fence if there 's a chance, 
  oh , does it ? 
  is it claiming the whole al-andalus ? 
  because it would have the same base as claiming only either ceuta or melilla . 
  not comparable, 
  why ? 
  for closing the fence as the uk has chosen ? 
  i 'm sure the brits would stop coming to get drunk because they care so much about the rock, 
  there wont be a declaration of war , just economic siege to a rock of pirates .

  get hyped !, 
  call me cynical if you want , but i 'm so tired of politics as to be naive enough to not see a clear agenda through a facade of excuses , the same way i do n't believe the pp when they say that they want the best for spain, 
   cup is not anarquist , wtf ? 
  they 're anti-capitalists . 
  you are right , they are not anarquists , i 'll correct that  they do n't want to take it down because it 's related to spain , and you 're talking out of your ass . 
  sure thing . 
  that 's why they want to take down the spanish flag from municipal buildings too . 
  no hate for spain at all, 
  let 's clear some things here . 
  the ones asking for this is the cup , an ~ ~ anarquist ~ ~ independist group that is always saying stupid shit , afaik no one else has supported this bullshit . 
  the statue has been there for over a century and barcelona has always being bragging about it and catalans have claimed many times that columbus was a catalan . 
  this morons do n't really care if he was a monster or not , they just want to take it down because it is related to spain and anyone with a pair of eyes have seen that from the begining edit : the cup is not anarquist , their ideology is catalan independence , socialism , anti-capitalism , environmentalism , municipalism , marxism , libertarian socialism , direct democracy , , euroscepticism , pancatalanism , communism and tumblrism, 
  the only good thing about this is that pp wo n't have an absolute majority in december , other than that the rest is just sad . 
  rancid old psoe and felipe gonzalez have won, 
  it 's the meaning of the word , but most people just know it as a mexican insult with no other meaning attached to it, 
  i 'm going to guess he was n't selling pubic hair but something `` tipical mexican '' and wanted to used the most representative word of the country . 
  i mean the first thing one thinks about mexico is `` pinche pendejo wey '', 
  because the elections would be on christmas day , people are tired enough of the politics and the only ones staying in their home town and not having to vote by mail are the grandparents who always vote for pp, 
  it 's because of this `` false socialists '' why so many people turned to podemos,

  i was n't talking about the malvinas but of a country that its outside of the eu and history lesson : they were from argentina at least from 1820 to 1833 , but i already know how the british historians love to hide facts so i understand why you would say that they never were, 
  better than our own government, 
  you are free to try to charge once you get out of the eu, 
  why would argentinians have representation in the eu ? 
  the uk has thrown away its representation voluntarily so once the exit its done it 'll have to behave as any other external country to the eu, 
  you misspelled acid, 
  in a holy war you can conquer all you want . 
  your god gives you all the rights, 
  the main requirement to be a spaniard is to not want to be a spaniard . 
  so that would make catalans the most spaniards of them all, 
  you forgot this / s right ? 
  edit : i see from your other comments that you live in your own bubble disconnected from reality and wishing the death of those who do n't agree with you . 
  so maybe you really think that would happen, 
  i thought it went to andorra, 
  morroco has no claims to either ceuta or melilla . 
  so they can see whatever they wish . 
  only calling a jihad they would have a claim,
