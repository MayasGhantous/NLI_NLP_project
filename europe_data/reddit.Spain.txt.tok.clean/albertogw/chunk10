   now the academy has adopted selfi as the orthographically correct version .

  i agree with your views except the last point  writing catalu\u00f1a in english makes no sense as much as writing it in catalan because ...  at least they write it in the local language . 
  ... spanish is also a local language, 
   even most spanish media writes catalunya there you are lying . 
   when writing is spanish , most catalan media writes catalunya  when writing in english it is spelt catalonia .

  the germans did n't succeed at invading england either , 
  the british navy was objectively better , but what could the spanish do if the french commanders force them into a suicidal mision and then fled in the middle of the battle ? 
  yes , i am, 
  lesson to be learnt : do n't let the french be in charge of anything, 
  * las gallinas que entran por las que salen * there must be a trade off , you simply can not teach everything .

  the inquisition is blamed for everything bad that ever happened .
