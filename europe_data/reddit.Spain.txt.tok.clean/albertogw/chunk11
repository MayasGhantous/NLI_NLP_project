  i eventually ended up ditching the subtitles altogether and i can understand even the thickest of accents now . 
  using the english part of the intenet has also improved my vocabulary a lot my problems is the speaking part , there is no easy way to practise it without natives on sight, 
  oh , this is an old comment . 
  i think you can tell i was angry when i made that comment you probably have not seen [ his disaster ] ( https://twitter.com/jamieoliver/status/783251738509836288/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw ) either , it looks like a dehydrated soup , nothing in common with a dish refined by centuries of well done experimentation . 
  [ and the motherfucker has not learn his lesson so we have to keep being insinting ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp-kkj4rqka ), 
  thank you for the traslation . 
  so this is from the very start of the war then , i ca n't imagine how demon-like he would be presented by the end of his life, 
  i 've looked up who miguel hidalgo was , and it makes sense he would say that , he was executed in 1811 , we were still under french occupation . 
  fernando vii was nicknamed as `` the desired '' after all , people wanted him to be king , what nobody expected is that he would be worse than the french, 
  yes , he is probably considered one of the best ones we 've had by most people too , which is n't saying a lot but at least he defended us from the english and the turks . 
   one must always be careful judging historical figures exactly . 
  and you were doing a great job not being biased which is not what usually happens with most people . 
  i mean , try to discuss history with an english ... and i do n't doubt the duke of alba is the most hated person in the netherlands . 
  [ he eats babies ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/an%c3%b3nimo_-_duque_de_alba.jpg ) , 
  i 'm not denying the massacrers , but i 'm pointing out that one must be careful while judging them because what the propaganda did was to blow out of proportion anything the spaniards did to portray them as the bad ones while everyone else was doing the same or worse things, 
  [ fernando vii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferdinand_vii_of_spain ) this moronic traitorous asshole destroyed our rights , the empire , brought back absolutism , divided the population forever and made us loose a whole century of progress . 
  and to finish it all he is the reason the carlist wars happened after changing the succesion law, 
  fun fact : he is considered a hero in spain and he 's burried in my city ps do n't believe the black legend propaganda without questioning it , those were the first `` fake news '', 
  chinese - stop following me in your store , i 'm not going to shoplift anything japanese - tourist groups taking photos thais , vietnamese ... - do you really eat grasshoppers ? 
  indians - [ this , i guess ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2-40pcbk5y ), 
  [ why do you smoke ? 
  to be keeewwl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx9ytoosmpw ), 
  if the government was n't paying for it , it would have disappear long ago, 
  sad thing is that this year they were already doing like in the usa and looking for the vote of the swing states . 
  so the system we have also fails at not leaving areas unatended . 
  those with regional representation in the parlament . 
  d'hont would disregard those votes if it were in a whole country level and those parties would n't get as many seats, 
  it 's more that regional parties would get even less representation , and we know how some regions feel about that do n't we ? 
  i thought `` payo '' meant non-gypsy, 
  and fat people are called gordos , and ginger people are called zanahorios and so on and so on . 
  so what ? 
  sincerely , it 's much better to make fun of everyone and treat it lightly than make like the americans , cry that everything is racist and then think that an entire race is inferior to other . 
  anglosaxon 's twofaced crybaby behaviour is what it 's racist, 
  i 'm willing to bet that people still remember `` el chikichiki '' song much better than any of the other songs we have sent since, 
  chinese store owners are odd , they do n't really like to mix with other people , older ones may not even learn the language . 
  i think this is a culture thing rather than a race thing ( at least from our part ) as adopted chinese kids have no problem mixing with the rest at all . 
  also many of them get married very early , as soon as they finish highschool with the children of the next corner shop owner, 
  why would i promote anything like that ? 
  afaik there are no barriers of racism to break regarding relationships in spain , no one is going to bat an eye if you date someone of other race . 
  do n't they ? 
  unless my highschool teachers lied to me , letter combinations always sound the same way in french, 
  it 's because there are n't that many blacks or asians . 
  and for the record , i 've seen a lot of interrracial couples over here, 
  but at least they follow consistent rules, 
  so i can shit diarrhea and ** sell ** it as cocacola ? 
  i mean , who is going to care if i destroy the reputation of it ? 
  if he wants to experiment and make crap he should n't use the reputation of other things, 
  pronunciation there are no rules for the stupid sounds there are in english . 
  every mispronounced vowel ends up being the / \u0259 / wildcard that sounds diferent each time it 's supposed to appear, 
  last time snow stayed in the ground in my city was 8 years ago . 
  i live at 800 m over the sea level and gets under 0\u00bac everyday in winter, 
  i do n't necessarily believe it but some people say that [ the failed coup d'\u00e9tat in 1981 in spain ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysemfam3odg ) was staged to make the monarchy be felt as our saviour, 
  this one reminds me of [ gomaespuminglish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rotwyvjff3a ), 
  stupid jokes mocking how other languages sound how do you say `` bus '' in german ? 
  suban-empujen-estrujen-bajen ( get in push squeeze get out ) how do you say `` to park '' in arabic ? 
  ata-la-jaca-a-la-estaca ( tie the small horse to the stake ) how do you say `` armpit '' in swahili ? 
  tu-tufo-me-tumba ( your smell overthrows me ), 
  it 's not that weird . 
  it is to make easier the registration of family members , and still much better and flexible than being forced to have only the father 's surname for the family, 
  all siblings have to have the same surnames in the same order by law until they are over 18 when they can change them if they want, 
  [ hating half of spain ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/ri%c3%b1a_a_garrotazos.jpg ) does n't matter which half on whatever topic since at least the 19th century, 
  that would be for only one country though . 
  each country has diferent coin designs, 
  i 've seen plenty of jesus costumes in carnivals and parties and no one has a problem with that . 
  i do n't understand how americans do to get offended of behalf of others . 
  i find that more disrespectful and patronizing than anything else , specially when they do n't have a clue about what the fuck they are defending , like that girl that thought hawaii was a continent, 
  we see it as our grandpa too, 
  edgy teenagers and garz\u00f3n though , not even close to the mess they have in the us, 
  in spain if someone starts crying about something `` ofensive '' , it is usually laugh down by most people for being a crybaby . 
  and over here political correctess censorship is not just a left-leaning thing for example , a politician from podemos made some black-humor jokes on twitter and he was send to court by the conservatives because they felt it was offensive, 
  either that or not knowing anything about it, 
  no , what i meant was that the attack was the casus belli the us needed to enter the war, 
  with the same relevance as the sinking of the lusitania in ww1 , just the excuse for the usa to join the war . 
  it obviously can not have the same sentimental value in europe as it has in the usa, 
  we do . 
  maybe not everyone does it with the same intensity , but in my opinion the people in the video do n't feel as exagerated as the stereotype implies, 
  the chinese corner store shopkeeper . 
  for fucks sake lady , you 've been living here for a decade , you could at least have learnt the numbers . 
  i do n't want your five years old kid telling me how much to pay, 
  spain : hahahaha no i can not trust a government so corrupt and rotten to the core that every single week a new scandal is discovered . 
  hopefully now that no party has absolute mayority in the congress the stupid laws that have been passed can at least be changed even if it 's only to keep appearances and please the opposition, 
  weather presenters speak with canarian accent nowadays, 
  not just porn actor , ** gay ** porn actor, 
  we used to buy towels in portugal , but then they make it so you had to pay for the roads, 
  oh , i do n't know . 
  maybe because of the expropiation of the goods of the whole population of a country while him becoming a multimillonaire ? 
  you are completely right . 
  i was n't really comparing to our civil war , i was just commenting the worst case scenario of alienating half the population of a country, 
  if you do that , you 'll end up with a civil war and forty years of fascist dictatorship, 
  the duke wellington is a hero in my city . 
  i think he is the only foreigner that gained the honour to be represented in the main square, 
   goya , supported napoleon you mean godoy , right ? 
  i know goya was n't fond of the borbones but i can not believe he supported the french after the war, 
  i 'll upvote you for reminding me of malviviendo . 
  such a good show, 
  and gafapastas have started a renaissance on barbershops . 
  i still can not believe how crowded they get, 
  you put the one with lyrics . 
  that 's the francoist one, 
  if someone cuts in front of you it 's because you are weak and deserve it , not even old ladies would allow that ... actually they would be the first ones to cut in front of you and you do n't argue them,
