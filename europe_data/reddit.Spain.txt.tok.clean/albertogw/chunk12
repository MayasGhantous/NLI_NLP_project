   it reminds of some '80s game show it was made in the 80 's so that makes sense we have some songs with very heavy connotations : [ the national anthem with the lyrics from the franco dictatorship ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi6viw2ggke ) [ `` el cara al sol '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srwjdegx6rg ) the anthem of the fascist falange party [ `` el himno de riego '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfygsaf-xyc ) the anthem of the republic, 
  you mean political parties ? 
  i hate that the damm pp has such a [ catchy song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7vysfwexeo&amp;t=30s ) [ here , have a merengue version with pikachus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmgfcoszcge&amp;t=38s ), 
  [ here you have a little collection with some other images of the time ] ( http://www.taringa.net/posts/ciencia-educacion/11467201/la-flaca-la-revista-que-salia-cuando-podia.html ), 
  [ my reaction to the topic ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/la_esp_rep._federal%2c_rep._unitaria_%282%29.jpg ), 
  i do n't get your point about empires . 
  are you saying that the brits did n't stole the `` sun never sets '' motto or that the spanish empire did n't have colonies in every single continent ? 
  britain is as european as the rest but with a superiority complex and constant annoying behavior, 
  those are the reasons you do n't like tourists ?!, 
  you know nothing , you lucky bastard ... 
  in my grandparents home . 
  i do n't recall if there are any crucifixes but there are many baby jesuses, 
  probably [ el caminito del rey ] ( https://www.google.es/maps/@36.9161404,-4.772066,3a,75y,337.11h,88.01t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s-64e3xkddtwq%2fvywtntywd0i%2faaaaaaaaicq%2fee-tl62dynkvzoqsxpk0xmatdtd_bjswwclib!2e4!7i8704!8i4352 ) they even made a tv special on how they recorded it, 
  wow , hey there , argentina has its fair share of imperialism , or are we going to forget what the desert conquest was all about ? 
  as for us , we 've been too busy killing each other to care or notice what happened over there , only cuba and puerto rico got the privilegde of being missed, 
  is an argentinian telling me that ? 
  notall but when even the stay campaign was `` if we stay in the eu we can keep crying for extra priviledges '' and the reactions of `` i told you so , you stupid '' to their compatriots after the vote ... it ends up being the other side of the same coin, 
  crybabies with superiority complex, 
  proper spain ? 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  [ how we are supposed to use them ] ( http://ep01.epimg.net/verne/imagenes/2014/10/20/articulo/1413804261_000126_1417026459_sumario_normal.jpg ) red , pink and yellow are the ones doing it wrong, 
  why would they ? 
  asturias is spain , the rest is conquered land, 
  the period is usually taught in good light , while in the rest of europe everything was shit , al-andalus was the best place in the world , an advanced and tolerant place , a crisol of cultures . 
  specially aderram\u00e1n iii and the califate . 
  then in a corner of the book it may explain the jizyah and the constant raids for virgins . 
  the reconquista is also taught in a good light too though moro is usually used as a peyorative for muslims . 
  but morrocans today have nothing in common with that period, 
  well , that 's working , `` refugees '' do n't want to come to the south, 
  mostly salty latinos and trolls with a * `` what have the romans ever done for us '' * syndrome . 
  it 's just banter like what they have between their countries all the time , the thing is that they can band together a continent against one country and it becomes more noticable, 
  we have many immigrants , tourists , workers , students , etc from latin america , and many spaniards have emigrated to there too . 
  wow , i 'm surprised how little relationship there is between latin america and the rest of europe . 
  in spain there are tons of conexions , for obvious reasons . 
  it would be weird to not know someone from latin america . 
  the worst experience i 've had is reading any youtube comment section in a video of the simpsons , so no problems at all, 
  late to the party , many cartoons have already been commented . 
  i 'm going to add [ las tres mellizas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4okm5vdabm ) they were big back in the day . 
  in each episode the witch and the girls enter a popular story like the `` three little pigs '' or `` little red ridding hood '' and mess with it . 
  i meant expats from britain or germany . 
  over here they are the only ones that call themselves expats instead of immigrants like the rest of the people does, 
  when in rome do as the romans do you do n't have to renounce to your culture , but you can not go to a place and impose it or reject your host 's culture . 
  and yes , expats are not integrated at all . 
  they live in their own selfsegregated communities feeling superior to the locals , not even trying to learn the languaje or anything, 
  here it 's mostly the kind of tourist that goes to magaluf who does it . 
  so young drunkards from everywhere in the world, 
  do n't the tourist you get do this ? 
  they are mainly drunk assholes trying to show off, 
  it 's not suicidal , it 's just druken recklessness you may be onto something though . 
  in spain people has been doing dangerous things with bulls for centuries , it may be correlated, 
  no , more like natural selection drunkards betting they can get to the swimming pool from their hotel room or climbing walls to visit friends in other rooms, 
  every year there are at least half a dozen deaths and countless injuries . 
  throwing themselves out of windows , also known as `` balconing '' then you see paraplegics , amputations and deaths, 
  tell that to [ suaseneguer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73guur8zlw ) at least we try now , my grandparents still read the names in spanish as they are written , so fun when they see actors they remmember, 
  in the past we used to make them as spanish as posible , nowadays it 's more of a middleground , for example : `` facebook '' is read as `` feisbuk '' `` twitter '' is read as `` tuiter '' acronyms are read as if they were in spanish , this is the opposite of what they do in latin america , they pronounce them more as in english . 
  for example : cd in spain it 's `` ced\u00e9 '' , in latin america is `` sidi '' if you pronounce the loan words in its original way , using sounds we ca n't comprehend , no one but your snob friends would ~ ~ respect ~ ~ understand you, 
   loving jam\u00f3n ... heretic !, 
  to the fire with you, 
  our government appart from that , the most famous one used to be the [ timo de la estampita ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjnxmyy3q2e ) basically a mad man offers you `` estampitas '' for a small price , but he does n't know that those are actually big notes , then you try to scam the mad man buying him more without you realizing that it is fake money what you are buying with your real money, 
  nah , portuguese prefer the atlantic ocean before us , i do n't have a doubt about it, 
  well , trump is crazy and hillary wants to start a war against russia , so i would say until your elections are done, 
  you forgot [ cola cao ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkm7wpi8z40 ), 
   the best form of government is a dictatorship in which the dictator is a nice fella !, 
  like they were during the roman republic times , where they would resign when no longer needed in regard to the monarchy , we are lucky that felipe vi `` el preparado '' is a nice fella and does represent spain in a good way . 
  could you image if we had a froilan as king ? 
  pretty common here . 
  i usually go looking for boletus , parasoles and n\u00edscalos in some places at some point it had to be banned because people are stupid and take them with plastic bags fucking the whole ecosystem , or cleaning the whole mountain to sell them afterwards, 
  oh , hahahahaha that 's because of the vowels , we know only five and we need at least one in every sound, 
   locals drink tinto de verano exactly , completely diferent things  also d is sometimes z , occasionally - ad is - \u0104 those are actually mistakes , but making the distinction between s and z is not . 
  the lisp or ceceo is what there is in granada for example , not what foreigners say it is . 
   and the black legend  huh ? 
  the black legend is the propaganda against spain that started in the xvi century in the [ netherlands and england ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_legend#/media/file:illustrations_de_narratio_regionum_indicarum_per_hispanos_quosdam_devastattarum_%e2%80%94_jean_th%c3%a9odore_de_bry_%e2%80%94_14.jpg ) , and then all the countries that were an enemy of spain at some point, 
  please , tell me what i wrote that is wrong . 
  you can not learn if you do n't know where 's the mistake, 
  * the whole of spain dances flamenco , aka we are all andalucia * that sangr\u00eda is a thing locals drink and not made for tourists * that we have a `` lisp '' for speaking the correct way : s ! = z * and the black legend, 
  do n't give money to the gypsies begging in the streets . 
  in spain yes , a lot , we even dub your [ beeps ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz5eoeverco ) of your programs . 
  and when more blasphemous and offensive the swear is the better . 
  my grandfather was shitting on god several times everyday we ca n't understand the puritan obsession the us has with censoring words . 
  like people censoring themselves as if they were four years olds trying to be edgy, 
  oh , damm , i forgot about it . 
  i guess the tv telling us men are murderer monsters and women are always little inocent flowers every single day made me block it . 
  we do have a problem with feminazis abusing that law and no one willing to correct it because of the backlash they would get, 
  i know , that 's why i said english instead of british . 
  well , to understand podemos you have to be familiarized with spanish politics because i 've seen too many generalizations and comparisons from foreigners that are not accurate at all . 
  in spain there has always been a clash between conservative and progresive ideas , and we 've had at least 4 civil wars because of that , the last one being the one in 1936-1939 which the fascists won making franco start his oppresive dictatorship that lasted for 40 years . 
  when franco died we have a transition to become a democracy , at this point the socialist party psoe reappeared and a party founded by the members of the francoist government would later become our conservative party pp . 
  after the transition this two parties dominated the spanish government going back and forth in power . 
  at first the psoe was in power with felipe gonzalez until there were so many scandalous corruption cases that was unforgivable to let them stay . 
  then it came the pp with aznar , that not only made us intervene in the irak war making us a target for al-qaeda , but he is responsable for inflating the economic bubble that would fuck us over in a few years . 
  after the 11m attacks in madrid , psoe won the elections again this time with zapatero . 
  this government was very social progresive at its time but zapatero kept inflating the economic bubble until in 2008 the crisis started , the bubble pop and everything went to shit . 
  the government started the austherity , making budget cuts , reforming labor laws and people became annoyed . 
  at this point protests in the streets started and the 15m movement of the indignados was born , where many people was part of . 
  then the elecctions came , everybody was pissed with the government and those who voted for the left did n't go to vote , only the loyal right did , and our current government of pp with mariano rajoy got in power with absolute majority , meaning that they could do everything they wanted without opposition , and they did , we 've been losing rights since then . 
  also because of their ineptitude catalan independence parties got strong and every single day we have to hear about a new pp corruption case that has been uncovered and will not be punished but forgiven . 
  at this point podemos appears out of nowhere as the political platform for those indignados of the 15m , made out of normal citizens as a coalition of diferent political ideas . 
  no political party takes them really serious until last december they managed to become a strong third force in the parlament . 
  a new center-right wing party , ciudadanos , founded by banks and the ibex35 appeared opposing catalonia 's chance for a referendum and podemos ' rise . 
  now we have a political deadlock because no party is strong enough to form a government and neither is willing to make a coalition with the others , we had other elections this summer but the situation is almost the same , the only change is that pp gained some votes at the cost of ciudadanos , and that fewer left wing people went to vote podemos is the left wing , anti-austherity , anti-corruption , anti-stablishment party basically taking votes from the traditional left wing psoe that is seen as too corrupt to be trusted .
