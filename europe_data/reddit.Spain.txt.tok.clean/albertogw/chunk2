  you are thinking too highly of the human race . 
  catalonia is a nation . 
  there no doubt about it . 
  but it is not a country , and it was less of a country when it was under the crown of aragon under the habsburg control back in the 1600s, 
  catalonia was n't a country even back then, 
  because google needs to know, 
  pyromaniacs are disgusting . 
  [ just look how quickly they fuck everything up ] ( http://videos-cdn.farodevigo.es/multimedia/videos/2016/08/11/106445/incendios-galicia-vecinos-arbo-graban-como-prenden-siete-focos-monte-1_m.mp4 ), 
  we call them [ catalan independentists ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocv4dgh7kg8 ) ... ok , ok , bad joke that video is just la cup how many points will independence support be raised by this comment ? 
  it was n't, 
  it is n't . 
  it 's curious how those who go to the most expensive universities with daddy 's money are the ones who attack normal people saying they are privilege, 
  if there are third elections we are going to beat your record , not bad for amateurs, 
  i 'm not sure if the war would have ended faster or would have been drag for years , but anyways all those pros you get them with stannis too and with a stronger claim, 
  oh , but renly was the selfish brat that wanted to battle against him . 
  stannis offer him a perfect deal where he was named heir before shireen and he refused it because of greedyness, 
  buff , i 'm walking a minefield and i do n't want spoilers , but did they do that already or the opposite ? 
  he was the only one to go save the wall and it 's now trying to liberate the north from the boltons . 
  that 's the opposite of selfisness, 
  they always hated stannis and wanted to make him a zealot monster from the start . 
  i stopped watching the show after that but i 'm sure they are still wanting to suck danny 's cunt over everything else, 
  i think they have pretty strict laws regarding piracy in comparison with the rest , that makes casual piracy harder for inexperience people, 
  oh , it was n't that bad , but each country media would highlight when something like that was said even if it was hidden in what the whole pile of shit the campaign was . 
  there was n't much sympathy for the brexit cause to begin with, 
  it was expected really . 
  it 's not as if the brexit campaign ( nor many supporters ) have been kind to any eu country . 
  `` eastern europe invading you , southern europe leeching your money , france being france , germany bossy nazis , the nordics too dumb to realize you are better ... '' that does n't leave a great impresion really, 
  i 'm giving the point of view of what the treaty of utrecht estipulates and also the un law , made specially for the gibraltar situation . 
  what would have stopped gibraltar for pulling a netherlands and gain space to the sea if those waters were really theirs ? 
  the fact that those waters are a protected marine conservation zone maintained by spain under the order of the european comision . 
  throwing concrete blocks and bringing broken nuclear submarines sure does n't help to protect that . 
  so definetly not gibraltar 's . 
  [ a map of their claims ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/limitesgibraltar.svg ), 
  polish immigration have kinda been the main reason many have voted to get out the eu . 
  you ca n't blame him for feeling resentful, 
  well , even podemos would close the border , they have say it, 
  that 's what gibraltar claims , the only waters they have are the ones inside their port, 
  led zeppelin ? 
  forget that !, 
  i want my mozart ticket, 
  good luck trying to make that tax haven as succesful as it is without access to the free market . 
  the spanish government offered a solution for the mess england has made for the citizens of gibraltar , let see what the corporations want, 
  enough to destroy it as a tax haven , those business registered in gibraltar that then operate in spain would be outsiders of the eu and whould have to pay what they do n't now just because of the brexit . 
  the area aroung gibraltar seems the `` poorest '' because almost no business pays taxes in spain and are evading taxes in gibraltar , then fucking the whole area nobody really cares if they stay as a british colony , we have plenty of that already here . 
  but you are getting out of eu are n't you ? 
  when that article 50 ? 
  you would be as morroco then and the fence is pretty tall, 
  yeah . . no we are going to starve economically that fucking tax haven . 
  no need for invasion . 
  [ romanians are the biggest nationality group that comes here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_spain#major_immigration ) even more than morrocans , and as he said many them are gypsies that live stealing copper and in violent gangs , our gypsies seem civilized in comparison, 
  hey , but at least we 've got spanish government soap opera and the crossover with the rest of the world becoming shit this season . 
  the plot thickens, 
  i would n't consider being in exile after the civil war has already ended as being in office . 
  there 's the option of neither of them, 
  they do n't really want to solve the situation either , both parts get benefited for being at each other throats . 
  fucking nationalism ... 
  to be fair , they revolted because the ceda got into power without elections not because they wanted independence and they were n't the only ones who revolted either . 
  in the rest of spain there were insurrections as well . 
  in fact in asturias they were at war until the very end , fighting the fascists like yag\u00fce and killing priests . 
  it is n't called `` bienio negro '' for nothing, 
  yeah , sure , that 's how the world works . 
  there are roads with tolls everywhere in spain , and the comunidades who asked for them are the ones buying them now , not the central government . 
  is the generalitat who should have the money saved because that money ends up returning to the comunidades . 
  if they do n't have it , it has been wasted in other thing and you may think that your community pays more than the rest , that 's what happens when you 're the rich part of a country . 
  in every country the rich part pays for the poor part , but not that much and without it being good for all . 
  pay back ? 
  are you pulling an espanya ens roba argument ? 
  because that has been disproven multiple times already and even if that was the case , you having shitty roads affects all spain the same way it should affect you that we have shitty roads . 
  why would the government not do anything if it could ? 
  because spain hates catalans is that it ? 
  even if that is throwing stones to your own roof we want you to be opressed do n't we ? 
  because the government ca n't do that , those roads are competence of the generalitat , the only thing that can be done is force the genelaritat to buy them but no one is willing to do that . 
  i think that only the ap-2 and ap-7 are from the state , and they should be bought as fast as posible but they should n't be prioritized over the rest of them in spain just because independists are crying now . 
  if there is no way to escape barcelona without paying tolls is because the catalan politicians and their deals with private companies want it that way . 
  it 's not spain 's fault, 
  afaik the government ca n't build a better road in a route where someone has given a concession to a private firm , and that goes for everything in catalonia , galicia , andalucia and everywhere in spain . 
  as you said :  you ca n't have both . 
  if you consider cities of more than 100k people small enough to not be well comunicated between them , i will grant you to tell me i live in a remote place . 
  it 's all useless countryside west of lleida anyways am i right ? 
  no roads are needed there, 
  we did n't even know that island existed until this happened, 
  i do n't think so , it was n't needed anyways , probably after the confict was over it supported spain like everyone else , but this showed that if something happened in north africa we were in our own because those territories are not protected by nato, 
  those [ monkeys ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=gibraltar+monkeys&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=923&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjz8dk6s5boahugsbqkhdrrcfeq_auibigb&amp;dpr=1 ) are very dangerous and may attack us at any time, 
  of course it would have being and overreaction , what spain did was also an overreaction . 
  but the point is that nato does n't care about its members . 
  nato would n't move a finger for ceuta and melilla if they were attacked as they are not included in the pact . 
  that is insulting . 
  also during this crisis only italy supported us from the begining while france decided to side with morroco . 
  not cool france, 
  oh , [ but they did ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perejil_island_crisis ) , and nato did n't want to help , not that we needed help anyways, 
  since when not even half of the population is a ** clear ** mayority . 
  there should have been a referendum a long time ago before both sides started with the nationalistic bullshit , now its worse than the brexit campaign, 
  are you seriously crying about the fucking roads ? 
  less than 10 years ago i had to spent 5 fucking hours in a 200 km ride while you had over there highways , trains and everything one can think of . 
  if the generalitat made a shitty deal and you had all the infrastructure already made when the goverment finally decided to not let rot the rest of spain you ca n't blame spain for making highways where there were none, 
  [ i 'm not scared ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zohnxmnuafg#t=23s ), 
  there 's a worse political deadlock than last time and the current goverment party has won more seats in the second election . 
  i do n't see a new goverment incoming . 
  and the position of spain is this :  `` if scotland becomes independent in conformity with legal and institutional procedures , its request to form part of the eu can be considered . 
  in the contrary case , it can not . '' http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/06/30/inenglish/1467273803_871148.html http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/02/03/inenglish/1391425089_214995.html,
