  new spanish goverment ? 
  when has that happen i must have been sleeping spain would veto an unilateral independent scotland to join the eu , it needs the westminster approval, 
  a year of a new case uncovered each week . 
  i we were to consider everything we would have to start counting a few centuries back, 
  will a river change make that land part of germany though ? 
  [ i 've seen worse borders ] ( https://www.google.es/maps/@44.7872567,19.3312846,12z ), 
  it 's a fetish . 
  do n't jugde, 
  oh well , i 'm glad it 's not what i thought but you ca n't blame the average spaniard for thinking the worse after a year of discovering a new corruption case week after week . 
  one ends up tired of checking the facts , and i admit my mistake, 
  fuck this country . 
  then we ask ourselves why we have a goverment full of thieves when everybody is one . 
  btw it would n't surprise me that those dead people were in nursery homes run by nuns, 
  to be fair , it is n't as common to have people from the other side of the globe than another german guiri that comes to get drunk, 
  beware the day they pass an anti-spech law with the excuse of inciting terrorism . 
  that 's what they did here , [ the mordaza law ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/06/30/inenglish/1435681072_581012.html ) because we ca n't really have strikes and demonstrations anymore and they can [ arrest anyone that disagrees with them ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/12149201/two-jailed-over-terrorist-glove-puppet-show-at-madrid-carnival.html ), 
  i do n't know what the situation in france is , but i can tell you that the labour law reform in spain did n't help anyone but the huge business . 
  because of the crisis and the law reform there were massive amounts of people that were made redundant , small and medium enterprises went bankrupt and people would n't get hired even if asking for precarious jobs with shitty salaries . 
  thousands of business places got sold to huge enterprises and banks . 
  trying to make a startup is an odyssey because of the bureaucratic hell and all the money you have to spend . 
  the gap between poor and rich has grown a lot . 
  the increase of number of millionaires in spain is the biggest in europe while many people has been without a job for years . 
  so i would say that this law was good for the big business owners , not for the normal people , but good for the big business owners that exist already . 
  we were also threathen with bussiness leaving to other countries , we just had to become a third world country for them to stay, 
  i like how this is n't an echochamber with just one or two political points of view . 
  this is good for discussion . 
  at least for how the poll looks now , it feels like it is pretty evenly divided, 
  something like this kinda happen in spain years ago . 
  the socialist goverment pass a labour law reform that destroyed a lot of worker rights because of the austerity the eu imposed . 
  people riot in the streets and the 15-m movement started . 
  then in the next elections many leftists did n't bother to vote but the loyal right did , and then the right wing party won by absolute majority . 
  with that power they have stripped us of every kind of right they 've wanted because they did n't have a real opposition . 
  that 's why the new parties have appear with such strengh in spain 's political scene . 
  i fear what 's going to happen in france, 
  oh , i thought brits used 10 ^ 12 as billion , i 've look it up now and aparently they stopped using it this way in the 70s driving on the left , the imperial scale and now this billion ... no wonder they wanted to get out of the eu, 
  cows are gods in india remmember, 
  real billions or american billions ? 
  is turkey trying to get kick out of nato ? 
  i feel cheated . 
  neither kazakhstan or portugal are rectangular enough to be in the top 50 ? 
  worthless shit rectangles, 
  stability and peace in the rest of the world, 
  [ if it weights like a duck , it 's probably a witch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3jt5ibfrzw#t=196s ), 
  i remmember when that was happening . 
  the day after brexit right ? 
  the old modern art , not only the bullcrap of today, 
  of course the pope it 's on the list, 
   im personally glad that we stopped interfering since the end of ww2 . 
  sure you stopped . 
  i do n't want you intervene , but do n't be a fucking moron who thinks that we always wait for you to restore order and peace , because america has done the complete opposite . 
  you are the ones that call themselves the world police while messing everything up, 
  what if i told there 's oil involved ? 
  would you ~ ~ invade ~ ~ intervene then ? 
  i think he means the pau exam , that is where i had to chose ( at least four years ago , i do n't know if they 've change it ) . 
  in bachillerato you had to study both , and at least in castilla y le\u00f3n, 
  the nazis were planning to invade spain before franco talked with hitler , they would have invaded a republican spain without a doubt, 
  nobody expect us, 
  oh , they do it . 
  i 've seen them even with flip-flops, 
  and all that while wearing sandals with white socks ... mad dogs ... 
  in spain we say that only mad dogs and the english go out in the midday sun, 
  at least it 's not last year 's heat waves . 
  those were unbearable, 
  yes , have n't you noticed how everywhere in the wolrd politics are getting polarized ? 
  the extremes are getting more powerful at the cost of the moderates, 
  i do n't believe sobbing stories that clearly have an agenda, 
  yes , what far-right-wingers say is bullshit too , because of the same reasons , fake or tergivestated stories pursuing an agenda . 
  the only thing this kind of stupid reasoning accomplish is feed the other side and make it more powerful, 
  because if i were to believe everything on the internet without any evidence i 'll have a relative in nigeria that is the heir to the kingdom and needs my money to reclaim it, 
  because it 's a bullshit article . 
  let 's tell the story of an imaginary muslim kid that was called names in school , wished the dead of everyone of them and went to fight in syria , then he came back , we payed jizya and he has n't killed anyone yet ... over here . 
  nah , spain is western europe 's yugoslavia , we can have a balcanization at any moment now, 
  there was a succession crisis . 
  the council of governors supported him over the rest of claimants and then he won the necessary battles, 
  did she finished it ? 
  [ a can of shit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/artist%27s_shit ), 
  well , the portuguese asked him to be their king . 
  phillip iv is probably laughing harder, 
  i guess they have tried to make it representative but i do n't know . 
  also people are exagerating things in this thread as if there was going to be a full unification . 
  the question was `` if spain and portugal should work towards ** some kind ** of political iberic union '' , that i would interpret as some kind of benelux or nordic council, 
  so sinterklaas makes the zwarte piet take the bad children to spain because the moors would punish them ? 
  times have surely change , now it would be the opposite . 
  i assumed it was about the duke of alba because i know that he is like the boogeyman over there . 
  [ here you have the complete study they have made ] ( http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/wps/portal/web/rielcano_es/encuesta?wcm_global_context=/elcano/elcano_es/observatoriomarcaespana/estudios/resultados/barometro-imagen-espana-6 ) it 's about how spain is seen in diferent countries . 
  this data of portugal is taken from a sample of just 400 people, 
  oh netherlands ... are you still scared of the duke of alba ? 
  you sure knew how to make propaganda , even better than the english . 
  be careful , he may wake up and eat your children any time now, 
  the eu is going to make an example making portugal and spain pay a nonsense fine and we are and will be inside the eu . 
  of course it 's going to make an example out of the uk so get ready, 
  [ but that is fun ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vooq-fph7fc ), 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzdqwx39wbg ), 
  divide the whole world between ourselves once again !, 
  and it was highjacked by 4chan and became a shitshow . 
  feminazis were so offended that they are still moaning to this day, 
  we 'll see what ends up happening but this has been going on for a time now and there 're less signs of it being forgiven each day that goes by . 
  in this same article says  impose fines of up to 0.2 percent of gdp that is that much money for spain 's case [ here you have another article in english ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/spain-portugal-in-line-for-penalties-on-budget-deficits/ ), 
  because paying 2000000000 euros in a fine while you see the rest of the countries violating rules for years and nothing happening to them kinda feels unjust,
