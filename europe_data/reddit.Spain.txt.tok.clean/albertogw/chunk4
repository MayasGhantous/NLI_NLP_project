  [ you can always vote for the third party ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rat_bujai70 ), 
  implying politicians are people ... do n't you know that they are lizardmen ? 
  by now most people in europe just know that hillary is a woman , is not trump and is supposed to have experience . 
  when she starts to interfiere where no one has called her we 'll see how opinions change, 
  wait for donald trump to get elected ... or hillary, 
  you left us to hitler 's pet, 
  [ race war !!!, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oicsk2zoaty#t=41s ), 
  this coming from a german makes it actually scary, 
  stereotypes do n't come from thin air, 
  are we going to start posting the highest person in our countries now ? 
  just tying the noose a bit more harder, 
  [ really ... ? 
  but those are the units , the system is metric, 
  do n't your supermarkets have a butchery and a fishery inside of them ? 
  in spain we have that , looks like [ this ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=carniceria&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=923&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiunsd91ohnahvqcsakhfrkbx4q_auibygc#safe=off&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=carniceria+y+pescaderia+supermercado&amp;imgrc=bx9a3jafrr6twm%3a ), 
   someone who genuinely enjoys learning about history is more than keen to learn about the low sides as well as the highs , it all becomes impartial in the end . 
  as it should be but i was talking about the education at school in spain more than anything , at home anyone does what it wants . 
  in spain we really focus much more in the defeats than in the victories , just for an example , almost nobody knew about [ blas de lezo ] ( http://www.badassoftheweek.com/blasdelezo.html ) until the [ boatymcboatface thing ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2016/03/31/how-spanish-trolls-tried-to-sink-a-british-boat-competition/ ), 
  that may happen from where you are from , but in spain we only learn about the defeats , the ones who enjoy history are the only ones that know about the high sides, 
  why do you think don quixote wanted to kill them ? 
  they love to remember battles they won but never acknowledge that they lost the war . 
  i 'm sure you have heard how they brag about the armada invencible, 
  you can never be sure of the stupidity of people on the internet . 
  many americans think that we are in mexico , mexico being the whole south america, 
  of course the peninsula is in europe . 
  this expresion is a joke from when spain was a backwards country with the dictatorship . 
  nobody would really consider the iberic peninsula part of africa ever, 
  africa starts at the pyrenees, 
  just look at the last elections . 
  the country is divided as fuck . 
  probably not , there are plenty of reasons to choose from to hate our goverment . 
  what may happen to a foreign nation should n't be the one to prioritize, 
  there 's the acting one , likely to be the one who stays if we do n't want another elecction, 
  more than half of spain is pissed off at the spanish goverment, 
  makes sense . 
  they are completely diferent situations and the biggest obstacle for and independent scotland to join the eu is a pissed off spanish goverment, 
  those are the reasons, 
  tourism has increased a lot , because of reasons , that creates jobs for the summer and then everything will go to shit again, 
  do they really want to be more like spain ? 
  no wonder they said it was scaremongering if the rest of the campaign went in this line of thought . 
  what were the remain campaigners thinking ? 
  you do n't want to open the pandora 's box allowing a part of a country to skip the law as they wish, 
  he got reinforce but he does n't have the mayority , he also has to make a coalition goverment if we do n't want to have another elections, 
  everything but america is east of portugal, 
  it dominates because any vote that does n't go to the pp goes directly to the trash , those votes does n't count, 
  hate and fear of the others, 
  he could kill babies in television and people would still vote for him, 
  not yet , it got just the bar raised , so non-crappy comics are allowed, 
  the uk has been copying the steps spain has done in history for a few centuries now . 
  enjoy the recesion you 're going to go through, 
  this is for britain what 1898 was for spain . 
  the realization that they are not a relevant empire anymore, 
  yes i 've seen it , the nuns stay in the doors of the electoral college with a bunch of envelopes and other nuns bring old people in and give them those envelopes . 
  if someone tells them something they leave and come back later . 
  and i know this happen all over spain because there 's a ton of videos that prove it . 
  if they do n't even know how they are called ... maybe . 
  or at least let them choose and not give them a closed envelope to put in the box, 
  the only way to stop a scottish referendum now is for england to pull a `` spain '' at them . 
  and you see how good the relationship between catalonia and the rest of spain is going on right now, 
  please do n't leave , you are the only hope to save this country, 
  and galician , but as you said , the rule is stupid, 
  they have lost a million votes, 
  pp has been trying to recover the votes that went to ciudadanos . 
  they have succeded . 
  ciudadanos was created to not lose rigthwing votes to the left anyways , so their purpose has been accomplished, 
  where i live i see the buses of nuns bringing old people all the time the day of the elections . 
  and i live in a city, 
  i wonder how much shit will appear the day the pp loses this cortijo, 
  well , the caciquismo is still a thing after all this years , so no really that surprising, 
  when they take the old people that not even know their name to vote for them in a country that 's getting older and older it 's imposible for them to fall, 
  they did the polls in the cities , that 's why, 
  euro-sceptic - none really anti-stablishment - unidos-podemos, 
  well ... the right likes to compare one to stalin \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  today are the elections , but this was the party that could oppose it the most, 
  [ spain would n't oppose scotland in eu as long as it is n't declared independent in an unilateral way ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/02/03/inenglish/1391425089_214995.html ), 
  greece is saved ? 
  podemos has shown support to the [ malvinas for argentina . 
  ] ( http://www.elconfidencialdigital.com/politica/errejon-carmena-baltasar-garzon-malvinas_0_2636736312.html ) i 'm sure that 's because of something, 
  we love you portugal !, 
  actual monkeys , the only ones in europe in fact, 
  because gibraltar is a tax haven , filled with smugglers and the spanish goverment ca n't do anything to prevent that as it is now, 
  we are going more to the left, 
  ftfy what they want is to be in the eu, 
  we can butcher english as much as we want now , that 's what they get for being the lingua franca, 
  we may be eurosceptic , but i can assure you that no one would ever think about leaving the eu here in spain, 
  [ this ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/rebeli%c3%b3n_cantonal ), 
  venezuela is constantly in the news in spain , sometimes even more than spain itself . 
  but this is because they want to scare people to not vote for podemos, 
  lacks moustache, 
  well , it says that one was detained by the police and the others escaped swiming so ... 
  so irish fans are a meme already ? 
  just hate , those tourists do n't bring anything good, 
  we burn the useless homework that we have been forced to do in the year , and we jump the flames too . 
  we burned fake christians though , the witch hunt was an english thing , and they burned more people by the way, 
  an army of socialist saharawis refugees in algeria who only have a ceasefire signed with morroco and that many wanted to break, 
  i wonder what 's going to happened to the polisario now that their old leader died a few weeks ago . 
  i 'm sure isis is trying really hard to radicalize them, 
  and our internal relationships, 
  we 've been trying to fix spain since at least the xix century ... no results yet ...
