  was n't it england though ? 
  i think we are more like siblings and that makes your comment unconfortable, 
  `` integrating '' more like throwing them into small reserves and guettos, 
  i think it was known that even the homo erectus knew how to use fire , but what they have found is even older than this, 
  scramble for mallorca, 
  we can say `` hijos de la gran breta\u00f1a '' , 
  we are louder , so no problem, 
  i 'm not going to defend the corruption of my country . 
  but this does n't answer my question, 
  how many tax havens are british territories ? 
  probably killing elephants, 
  it can led to confusion . 
  i 've seen translations where a quantity ends up being x1000 times bigger because of it . 
  we should all use scientific notation, 
  i have just read the translation and you are right , it is not that outrageous . 
  i do n't agree with the conclusion it has but it is not as bad as i first thought, 
  what the fuck ? 
  is that author on drugs or just hates human decency ? 
  for us it is : 1 000 000 = million 1 000\u00a0000\u00a0000 = thousand million 1 000\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0000 = billion 1 000\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0000 000 000 = trillion 1 000\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0000 000\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0000 = cuatrillion, 
  i thought brits used thousands of millions , but you are right , apparently they use the american way now . 
  i hope that does n't start happening in other languages, 
  real billions or american billions ? 
  only indigenous monkeys in europe . 
  i doubt it entered the port . 
  yes . 
  weaponized memes on spain 's side, 
  forocoches is our secret weapon . 
  they do n't know that we also have weaponized autism plus them being able to be zealots to this only cause . 
  add the argentinians from taringa and the english-hispano meme war will be won, 
   unsettlingly high population of bitter leftists who have outright hostile attitudes towards their country hahahaha oh sweet summer boy you know nothing, 
  gibraltar has no waters but those in the port . 
  the uk will not be able to disrespect treaties and do what it pleases anymore after brexit . 
  holy shit . 
  this is hilarious . 
  picardo is trying to get 4chan on his side . 
  because i think the eu can be fix . 
  i do n't see how throwing everything out of the window solves anything, 
   it 's always the british who are made to look like the bad guys not in the uk  the eu has a very totalitarian `` fall in line , or be punished '' attitude to it 's members and you ca n't even see it i do see it , and it is the only thing that stops our government from doing the same . 
   the world does n't need the eu , it needs the united nations to step up and globally unite the entire planet , much like humanity in star trek . 
  that wo n't happen unless aliens invade us,

  i know trump is n't really fascist . 
  it was a stupid answer to stupider comment . 
  spain will not do anything the brits have not chosen themselves . 
  they want the borders closed , the border will be closed . 
  i 'm seriously tired with the cherrypicking attitude the uk has . 
  and that about `` begging for money '' when we are now putting in the eu is pretty dumb, 
  i should n't bother to answer you but ... 
  i do n't want them to join . 
  i want them to be tolerable neigbours , which they are n't and do n't want to be . 
  now keep trolling if you want, 
  if i 'm a fascist you better hide in a bunker because the world is filled to the top with way worse monsters . 
  go fuck yourself . 
  gibraltar is a colony . 
  the un says so . 
  and it is a tax haven at the cost of spain . 
  thousands of companies that operate in spain go to gibraltar to evade taxes , constant smuggling of tobacco , perfumes , fuel , etc. . . leeching the services from spain , not respecting the treaties and violating them constantly , being a hazard for the enviroment . 
  they deserve a wall higher than trump 's, 
  not destroying gibraltar , destroying the tax haven that it is . 
  they can stay as another isolated british colony like the rest in the mediterranean , but they will not stay as a fucking tax hole . 
  destroying a tax haven or being called fascist by a fascist . 
  very dificult decision, 
  have you seen ours ? 
  a magnificent reflection of reality, 
  quite a strong negotiating position spain has . 
  shame the uk does n't know how to deal without gunboats, 
   so which is it you are proposing ... to enforce spanish rule upon the residents of gibraltar , or to eject them ? 
  just closing the fence . 
  the government offered them shared sovereignety with the uk . 
  picardo wo n't accept , well , then fence closed . 
  it is open only because of the eu, 
  that does n't make the us less hypocritical, 
  do they have the same classification though ? 
  gibraltar has been considered a tax haven until very recently and it is very likely to return to the tax havens list . 
  and neither ceuta , melilla or the canaries do harm to the economy of the neigbouring regions from morroco, 
  kinda . 
  the lower taxes are nowhere near to what gibraltar has , and they have this situation because , unlike gibraltar , everything they import or export is overseas so it compensates with other taxes . 
  why do you think closing the fence is such a deal ? 
  i did n't know that superpower status meant you can go and change a democratic elected government in a foreign country with a `` friendly '' dictatorship whenever you want, 
  ask latin america, 
  the normal people living there were problably enslaved as the rest of extremadura to be honest . 
  the fields and dams were not going to build themselves alone, 
  plenty of shit happened to everybody in the war and after it , being `` castillinized '' it 's not the worst that could happen . 
  the war and the dictatorship affected all of us , not only the non-castillians, 
   it 's a tax haven [ gibraltar is not considered a tax haven since last year ] ( https://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/new/1372016-bulgaria-definitively-removes-gibraltar-%e2%80%98tax-haven%e2%80%99-list ) , it is now `` low tax '' , a fancy way to hide that you 're still a tax haven but ok , it is not a tax haven . 
  regardless , it has at least 80000 companies that operate in spain registered in a place where only 30000 people live . 
  i honestly wonder why . 
   refuses to cooperate on border control and as such it 's the biggest entry in spain for smuggled tobacco and hasish [ this happens everyday ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd902rvnshc&amp;t=1m30s ) gibraltarian police does colaborate in big operations againsts drug smuggling , but it is constantly blocking the capture of smugglers when they enter the disputed waters . 
  [ one example ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/08/10/inenglish/1439197223_231387.html?rel=mas )  it 's airport is the dirtiest one in the iberian peninsula using all posible cheats on environment regulations the airport is shit and it 's in [ occupied land ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/xibraltarplano-es.jpg ) i do n't know if it is the dirtiest one in the peninsula  regularly harasses fishermen in spanish territorial waters so spain has to continuously protect them this is constant . 
  mainly because of the situation of the disputed waters . 
  [ one example that resonated ] ( http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2013/07/24/andalucia/1374696095_921767.html )  refuses to cooperate on inmigration but it 's quick to ask spain for help whenever a stray migrant boat heads there . 
  i do n't think migrant boats are able to get near gibraltar before being caught  hosts nuclear bases , something that is n't even popular in the uk ( see trident and scotland ) [ no one likes nuclear shit near them ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/07/21/inenglish/1469086225_143828.html ), 
  the population was indeed expelled by the british and their descendents still keep the keys of their old houses, 
  trump is a meme , not a troll . 
  he does n't have the stamina to be a troll, 
  yes , because that feeds more independentist sentiment, 
  not available on mobile phones because of the song, 
  what a shitty website . 
  [ a link to the entire video on youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqrg7wh_fc0 ), 
  this is why freedom of speech should be defended no matter what .
