  i do n't understand why all those german posters in r/europe are giving it up so easily,

  what 's the opinion of the irish from the republic on unification ? 
  norway is part of the schengen area . 
  i agree it wont probably be hard border in ireland after negotiations , because ireland is not in schengen the same as the uk , but the comparison with norway is not really accurate, 
   where do you wash your hands during peeing ??!? 
  where i live it has n't snowed in years , not even this winter , and now after a week of summer weather this happens . 
  i do n't understand . 
  i refuse to believe those alternative facts . 
  those socks must have been for an actor in a theater or something . 
  estatues and mosaics are on our side , no socks in those sandals , you uncivilized barbarian ... 
  their 80000 tax evading companies, 
  how do you wear your sandals ? 
  sure . 
  yes . 
  i 've read that generation z is becoming the most conservative since ww2 in rejection of all this regresive nonsense, 
  luckily i 've never worked in a place where the word `` man '' is frown upon, 
  have you read what i wrote ? 
  i agree with you . 
  but the problem is that lately things have scalated to a ridiculous point . 
  like for example the `` estudiantes y estudiantas '' or `` bomberxs '' in spanish that some people were trying to push so rejection of everything on the same light should be expected for obvious reason, 
  no word should be banned even if it is offensive to everybody . 
  i do n't see a problem for having alternatives , but i do see a problem if i 'm forced to use them and they are n't really banning anything , but look at the title of the article , that is why people may be saying that free speech is dead, 
  i mean , the article says they want to ban words ... and to top it of the words are common usage and not bad or offensive at all , unless you are a retrograde crybaby, 
  newspeak, 
  goddamm elves , may armok take care of the tree-huggers, 
  the inquisition was a bitch and a whole century of constant civil wars wo n't help either . 
  so it is all praise and good feelings and then ... 
  not cool finland . 
  fuck you finland and fuck your trees too, 
  you are just jealous of our antipodes bros ;p, 
  sangr\u00eda is for the guiris . 
  we would n't waste our far-better-than-the-french wine on them, 
  true that , but now everbody will see it for a month in the national news , which i think was their plan since the beginning to be honest, 
  and the message of the bus is now heard way beyond what was expected for wanting to ban it . 
  great job, 
  that cathedral thing works for the uk , diferent countries have diferent definitions for cities . 
  if a few thousand over 10k is too few people for a city , then \u00c1vila ( 59k pop at 1132m ) is the winner over andorra la vella ( 22k pop at 1023m ), 
  that would be capitals [ here you have a list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_cities_by_elevation ), 
  [ the treaty ] ( http://www.gibnet.com/texts/utrect.htm ) , still in place , gibraltar is from the uk or it returns to spain , no other choice and ratified by the onu ) i do n't care if they stay british or mongoloid as long as they stop being pirates and pay the taxes they should . 
  it is so easy to demonize evil oppresing spain and victimize the poor little tax haven, 
  sure thing , we should `` return '' everything up to oviedo too, 
  you asked for the position of spain . 
  do n't tell me about treaties you have not read and the uk does n't respect and the stupid greater morroco wet dream, 
  but you brits are always whining about the eu not enforcing its exterior borders . 
  what is it you silly brats want ? 
  there is already a fence and we are the ones who will close it, 
  that it never was from morroco and ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perejil_island_crisis, 
  [ but we left him in china ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7nyqpma77m ), 
  this is important to pay atention to . 
  we are not paying morroco for nothing, 
  are n't those from the sun brexiteers ? 
  saying that castillian culture is the `` spanish '' one , and therefore denying the existence of diferent cultures among the regions that are not pushing for special treatment . 
  that is what spawed this discusion when it was said that andalucian was basically castillian culture whatever that was refering to . 
  i sense that you are being dense on purpose, 
  that castillian ! = spanish, 
  maybe under the thousands of comments from independentists claiming that `` castillians are oppresing our culture '' or `` we are no spanish '', 
  [ a few days ago they were blaming the spaniards for hoarding letucce to not let then have it .

   you are taking this discussion totally wrong . 
  because the catalan special snowflake complex pisses me off when it denies that we are all special and not a fucking uniform blob, 
  so valencians are catalans . 
  got it, 
  at first glance i find it pretty accurate . 
  congratulations for explaining this mess, 
  they are fatter, 
  this is sad . 
  it 's been years now since i saw a fucking sparrow in my city . 
  they used to be everywhere , now they are all gone, 
  or the town hall allowing the [ cow owners to burn half the mountain without control ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_eofp2kclk ) or to get authorization for building shit in the burned place, 
  do n't worry , they can afford it . 
  i 'm not sure about the workers from la l\u00ednea though, 
  maybe they were talking about what is spoken in the americas , the language is spanish no matter the accent i do n't know . 
  anyways i assure you that we do n't call those who are n't spaniards spaniards, 
  spaniards do n't call all spanish speakers `` espa\u00f1oles '' . 
  that is a us thing,

  the german host already did that , but i expect several versions comming from spain competing to be the shittier one anyways,

  what is the racist remark ? 
  do n't get me wrong , it is horrendous that people were laughing at a man dying but the article does not say what they were saying that was racist . 
  it seems race is the only thing that matters nowadays for the press, 
  [ another map ] ( http://pelagios.org/maps/greco-roman/ ), 
  i 'm not just refering to the trump thing though , misleading titles are far too common on every topic . 
  and as i said in other comment , the trump thing could be true , i do n't know , with that person everything is plausible , but it was blown out of proportion without any kind of evidence . 
  that behaviour is going eventually make trump scandal-proof if it has n't already, 
  well , those are the top articles of a quick search on google so they are probably not the best examples but i 'm not going to waste my time looking for one in which they slip and outright say what they are implying in the title or the head paragraph . 
  journalists are profesionals of the word and that is not going to happen easily , specially when those `` mistakes '' are edited inmediatly . 
  there is probably a database somewhere doing that already , but i do n't know .
