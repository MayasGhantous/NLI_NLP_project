  and what was my original claim ? 
  this one ? 
   lately the mainstream media is accusing everything that does n't go its way as `` fake news '' regardless of that statement being true or not . 
  ok , i 'll refine it just changing the word `` accusing '' for `` implying '' and misleading people is the same exact thing why `` fake news '' are being criticise i 'm tired of you all doing me the third degree just because i do n't like how the media is behaving lately or for not feeling fond of methods of control that can be very easily abused, 
  that the media is doing no one a favor by reporting things as : this `` respected person '' has said `` this undeniable false statement that we are not going to even try to clarify why it 's false '', 
  i know they are not going to be censoring stuff now , but this is setting a dangerous precedent, 
  and they sure made special emphasis on that to not make people believe certain narrative, 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38370630 https://twitter.com/wltaskforce/status/816645680517312512 http://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/13/politics/russia-us-election/ http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/top-russians-celebrated-when-trump-won-intel-report-says-source-n703741 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dcatg9qy_a do those work for you ? 
  or you can not see how they are trying to discredit wikileaks and mislead people everytime they mention russia ? 
  ok , i did n't say anything about the americans but ok, 
  fine , i can trust them , but i can not trust them as if they were holy saints and i definetly can not trust facebook . 
  i do n't want to set a precedent for censorship, 
  the propaganda on the internet ? 
  sure . 
  way before that . 
  but that is n't what i was adressing in my comment, 
  any random article regarding wikileaks would probably be a perfect example and you can not deny that everytime the media uses the term `` fake news '' they are implying `` everything that is n't us is fake '' i could also look for one of the hundreds of times the spanish media has been saying lies about podemos and discrediting the online media until the judges closed those allegations and made them stop, 
  [ just because the wind is fast does n't mean it can be used ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oupnpamdly8 ) the turbines in my area are most of the time stopped because of that, 
  it is n't just that one and you know it . 
  i do n't want to implement censorship methods just because i think the opposite opinion of a nobody is wrong and misleading dumb people at the moment, 
  that 's not the same , because journalism has never been an objective science and even the most respected journals are spreading misinformation on purpose nowadays . 
  you have for example the `` golden shower gate '' of trump , that even though it could be true , it has being reported as news without a checked source or proofs . 
  that is the literal definition of fake news, 
  i know . 
  that 's why i said :  media has made people resentful of it to the point that outrageous false information , blatant propaganda and what is generally called `` fake news '' is being masivelly spread on the internet turning public opinions . 
  and that would be the perfect utopia if everything that is fake was label as that , but we can not blindly trust someone to do that objectively, 
  you are missing his point . 
  who is the one deciding what it 's fake and what is n't ? 
  yes , of course [ crappy journalism has been a problem since forever ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/journal98.gif/527px-journal98.gif ) but after the us elections and hillary losing them , [ she started blaming her losing on the `` fake news '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8qrjyjtxgy ) and the term has [ grown in popularity since then ] ( https://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=fake%20news ), 
  crappy journalism , totally biased articles and spreading unchecked misinformation on purpose by the mainstream media has made people resentful of it to the point that outrageous false information , blatant propaganda and what is generally called `` fake news '' is being masivelly spread on the internet turning public opinions . 
  lately the mainstream media is accusing everything that does n't go its way as `` fake news '' regardless of that statement being true or not . 
  most of the times it is going to be really fake news , but that 's because this is the internet . 
  [ arag\u00f3n is confused ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qxbkhatnzc ), 
  oh , some care , we did n't let the uranium fever fuck my province up yet for example , but the portuguese are in general overly worried about anything nuclear , in all those surveys on the matter you are always up there with the austrians in not trusting it, 
  i know . 
  and i applaud the portuguese goverment for not acepting it or shutting up like a bitch, 
  yeah , probably the `` ignoring portugal '' syndrome made me not realise that that place is lisbon 's outskirts . 
  we should send the waste of the nuclear plants of that town to new zealand , that way the portuguese paranoia of nuclear power wo n't be trigger . 
  i get the portuguese position and i kinda share it . 
  it is an old nuclear plant in the tajo river and building the dump site is to keep the plants alive for longer , but it is complete bullshit to say that place is in the border, 
  a 100 km from the border is pretty much in central spain , unless you want the waste under the puerta del sol . 
  she is not crying about those cowbells but the regular ones , the photo is misleading , and i do n't know if you have read the article but she is regularly complaining about the things the locals do . 
  i do n't support the punishment the locals are giving to her , but i can see why they are pissed with her, 
  does n't matter if they do n't attack other countries , nuclear winter would kill everyone, 
  and a hot war would kill literally everybody . 
  best choice is no war, 
  your heartbreaking story reminded me of [ this scene ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxo1poo8f2i&amp;t=9m40s ) of the best series ever done . 
  it has subtitles in english, 
  [ original video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9xd0xn7ahs ), 
  thank you , this is exactly what i wanted to know, 
  i do n't care about her opinion and i was sure that photo was to sensationalice the article . 
  but why are those so big though ? 
  is it a tradition or it has a purpose ? 
  it happened like that , the car appeared in a terrace in the other side of the building, 
  damm , those cowbells in the photo are huge . 
  how can the cows get to the ground to eat with those ? 
  and she sounds like a cunt that just wants to annoy everyone else , no wonder their neighbours are pissed edit : this comment is downvoted ? 
  i guess people are too touchy today, 
  in which universe is a toilet room where women go efficient ? 
  americans come with mexican hats , because they are dumb and irrespectful as fuck . 
  go learn how to troll , seeing your comment history makes it clear that you need it . 
  one thing to note is that over here we understand the diference between refugees and economic illegal immigrants , there is n't a fence in ceuta and melilla for nothing, 
   eta only did one thing right [ how about starting our space program ? 
  ] ( https://i0.wp.com/www.abc.es/media/201201/14/atentado-carrero-blanco-retrato.jpg ), 
  of all places . 
  do n't you know that we are the fascist capital of the world , the complete opposite of the progresive and perfect catalonia ? 
  [ literally everyday ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5gr8uspdis ), 
  and every fucking time they are refuted in the responses because the `` espanya ens roba '' argument is a lie,

  til valladolid is benavente . 
  video way too creepy, 
  a shot fired from a gang member is most likely not aim at an inocent and unrelated person on the basis of an ideology, 
   what kind of article is that ? 
  tl ; dr `` everything i do n't agree with is fascist , we are the poor opressed victims that do nothing wrong '', 
  so she is on trial , not in jail . 
  and no need to downvote i was seriously asking because i do n't know, 
  who is jailed ? 
  what ? 
  no vigo on the list ? 
  [ but what about all the stereotypes ? 
  ] ( http://e04-elmundo.uecdn.es/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2016/03/17/14582437713784.png ) and how the fuck does a town of 70k inhabitants manage to get in the 6th position ? 
  but that money has to go there to keep the ex-politicians working in those energy plants companies . 
  is no one going to think in the poor defenceless politicians and their job security ? 
  heartless monsters thinking in the enviroment and the normal people, 
   you just change the made up numbers of the timezone exactly . 
  i do n't understand why policians are so convinced that changing the time would have any effect in productivity . 
  they would benefit if there was any benefit to it . 
  the only one i can think of is that foreigners wo n't think we are lazy for waking up at the same solar time as them . 
  this is just to make your assimilation to unification easier, 
  [ timezone map to see the issue ] ( http://ontheworldmap.com/europe/europe-time-zone-map.jpg ) the consequence is that we have a [ shifted schedule ] ( http://ep01.epimg.net/verne/imagenes/2016/03/18/articulo/1458309794_132930_1458310068_media_normal.jpg ) it is about time to chage it,

  [ reminds me of this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oei2lb9mbo0 ), 
  yeah , no . 
  that 's what the uk claims , not what it 's internationaly recognized . 
  those waters you 've marked except the port are a protected area under the protection of spain designated by the european comision . 
  definitely not british, 
  those marked are n't even the gibraltar waters, 
  here we go again , i wonder whose politicians are trying to hide something this time .
