   puidgemont has said he will declare unilateral independence no matter what  not true ok . just if the independence wins the referendum . 
  right ? 
   they do n't have power to actually , not even article 155 gives this power . 
  is n't article 155 supposed to create an organism to replace the funtions of the organzations of the region but without disolving them ? 
   in any case it 's gon na be a mess if the spanish government do n't come to terms we all know this is what it 's going to happen . 
  you ca n't really be expecting the government to accept the independence like that, 
  please , tell me what you think will happen . 
  i ca n't tell , we will have to wait and see what happens . 
  i honestly think he wo n't declare independence , but instead use the referendum as a tool to show the world how serious catalans are in their feelings for independence and force spain to give a real one . 
  that 's why a higher turnout is important to give it more `` legitimacy '' . 
  then the goverment being jackasses and feeding more independentism . 
  so i expect basically the same as the other time , . 
  this time they really really mean it . 
  puidgemont has said he will declare unilateral independence no matter what , so the goverment will be forced to revoke the status of autonomous community and take care of catalonia directly . 
  catalan independentist politicians will be prosecuted for disobedience and prevarication , they 'll be seen as martirs and there will be even more discontent . 
  international opinion is what matters next , so catalans will try to make other countries to preassure spain on to accepting their demands . 
  or puidgemont chikens and we stay the same .
