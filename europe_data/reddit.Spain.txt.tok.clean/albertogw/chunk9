  i think the pp wants catalonia to end up leaving . 
  well , for starters there are all those catalans that share your opinions :p, 
  it 's made with [ bomba rice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bomba_rice ) for a reason, 
  oh , so the hate preachers funded by saudi arabia & co. are europe 's doing . 
  i do n't see how classifying us as incubators of terror is a good way to to tell anything, 
   `` ** saudi arabia is more keen to fight terrorism than the ... europeans ** , '' sheikh abdullah said during the tweeps forum 2017 . 
  `` ** the voices we hear calling for murder and shedding blood and stealing the wealth of people are in london , germany , spain and italy . 
  ** `` there will come a day when we see ** far more radicals , extremists and terrorists coming from europe ** because of ( a ) lack of decision-making , and trying to be politically correct . 
  `` from now on , ** we will name and shame these countries . 
  we will classify them as incubators of terror ** if they do n't address this problem of terrorism in their lands . '' he and his ideology can go fuck themselves .

  the chiki chiki did better than most of what we sent since then, 
  of course segovia is castilian . 
  but if for the first time a catalan independentist does n't group us all in the fucking blob then he deserves a bit of recognition , even if it is obvious why he 's making a fuss about it . 
  besides , the term `` castile '' is too vague . 
  is it the old crown of castile ? 
  the original kingdom ? 
  this . 
  if i live in a made-up region at lest keep the made-up region name as it is . 
  we re not madrid 's outskirts, 
  not my call . 
  if it were up to me , you would have had the stupid referendum already and fucked off if that is what the mayority wanted . 
  i assume that by your definition anything pro-catalan is anti-spain, 
  again : i 'm not saying it is n't catalan and modernism is now exclusively catalan ? 
  i guess we 'll have to demolish our buildings in that style outside of catalonia, 
  i 'm not saying it is n't catalan nor claiming that it is from the `` good old backwards meseta '' . 
  but cry the `` cultural appropiation '' all you want, 
  you people are obsessed . 
  everything is a fucking attack to your excepcionality . 
  it is tiring you know , you can point out something without crying how offended you are , expecially to a foreigner that most likely does n't know it . 
  snow-white juncker, 
  stupid opinion piece . 
  there are plenty of better reasons for catalonia to stay in than those idiotic ones presented in this article . 
  pp and ciudadanos would show their true colours . 
  i think it will eventually happen sooner or later, 
  i hate gibraltar 's behaviour as much as the rest , but this thread has gone too wild in comparison to the other times the topic appears . 
  in fact the treaty explicity excluded the waters . 
  we could n't , did we ? 
  this was a military coup because the army was pissed for the wars in the colonies . 
  was n't it ? 
  the army in spain was pretty much on franco 's side .

  there are a lot of french students tourist groups that come to salamanca . 
  after the chinese groups , i think they are one of the more common type of tourist to visit . 
  oh , and because i 'm sick and tired of gibraltar i supposedly love what corrupt politicians do . 
  i do n't care about their soverignity , but other than closing the fence what do you think spain can offer . 
  to accept their demmands and leave them be as they are ? 
  tough luck . 
  who said they are ok ? 
  you could have added andorra too . 
  tax havens are harmful shit and need to be dismantled . 
  for starters , gibraltar stop being a smuggling tax haven, 
  as a good average spaniard , i know nothing  obviously not true , but it 's sad how little we care in general about portugal :(, 
  ireland and the rights of eu citizens already in the uk and viceversa are the only things i care to be dealt with before the two years limit . 
  on the rest of issues , if they do n't know how to negotiate and expect the eu to bend over and open its buttcheeks , then they can have a no-deal , go fuck themselves and be bought by china . 
  sadly this scenario is more likely the more time passes, 
  not much support by the public since the very begining of joining it 2 . 
  inexistence of the blindly trust the us has for the army 3 . 
  inexistence of a real threat . 
  being dragged to dumb wars that only brought problems home 5 . 
  allies siding with the enemy in the verge of a conflict 6 . 
  waste of money that can be used on things that actually matter 7 . 
  zero recognition for the colaboration that it is done . 
  not owning shit to the us .
