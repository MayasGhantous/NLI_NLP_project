when i visited barcelona one day was about 35c . 
  it was nice because i was on holiday . 
  after finishing the first year of no mandatory high school , one of my friends , 17 years old , took a job in construction for the summer . 
  he had to work many days under the sun at +30 c. 
  he dropped school and became a full time construction worker . 
  and he had good grades . 
  now he is jobless , unskilled for anything else and living with his parents , of course . 
  secret ? 
  besides the already shameful knowns ? 
   out of interest , how accurate are opinion polls in spain generally ? 
  they are accurate to a certain point . 
  they sort of agree in the raw data . 
  but the cooking is varying a lot . 
  and it 's logic as we are in uncharted waters , from the government poll the one that favours more the ruling pp ( [ official 38 pages pdf in spanish ] ( http://cdn.20minutos.es/adj/2014/11/05/3009.pdf ) ) : * pp : 11 % of the polled people answered that would vote them , 27.5 % after cooking . 
  * psoe : 14.3 % of the polled people answered that would vote them , translated to a 23.9 % in elections . 
  * podemos : 17.9 % of the polled people answered that would vote them , translated to a 22.5 % after cooking . 
  * united left : 3,7 % of the polled people answered that would vote them , translated to a 4,8 % . 
  * upyd : 2,1 % of the polled people answered that would vote them , translated to a 4,1 % . 
  it 's hard to work with this material , the people that declares that will vote to the pp is disappearing at a pace even quicker than podemos is growing ; podemos is mostly growing from the left and centrist mostly people that did n't vote in the last elections or psoe or iu . 
  it 's hard to see what the conservative voters that declare that the wo n't vote again to the pp will do . 
  upyd , that party founded by rosa d\u00edez , when she lost the internal elections to the psoe , is trying to target them without the same level of sucess as podemos . 
   when is the next real electoral test that podemos will face ? 
  25th of may of 2015 : municipal elections in all the country . 
  and regional elections in ten autonomous regions . 
  the party is n't going to trust its bases to participate in the local elections . 
  but , it 's going to encourage the participation in voters associations candidatures . 
  in fact the mentor of the leader , may become the candidate to the municipal elections in one for madrid . 
  [ pablo iglesias announced that he would back him ] ( http://www.publico.es/552290/iglesias-propone-a-monedero-como-alcalde-de-madrid ) [ the party got 200,000 members in almost no time ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/podemos_%28spanish_political_party%29#membership_history ) , becoming the second biggest party in spain by membership . 
  however , the leadership does n't trust them ; they do n't have to pay membership fees and many come from other parties with their own agenda . 
  they had problems in galicia with the influx of left wing nationalist ( mostly former members of anova and bng ) that took over local circles and ignored the official party line  the success of podemos was extremely surprising in that election , to outside observers ) . 
  there is a lot of left leaning people at spain , and the official left is corrupt , pro-austerity and disorganized since the lost of the 2011 elections.and united left was in a bad situation , with a very unpopular candidate that later was discovered using luxembourg for tax avoidance ( legally ) . 
  edit : [ english article about the government poll ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/11/05/inenglish/1415191449_131878.html ) , and [ metroscopia puts podemos first ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/11/03/inenglish/1415011542_341454.html ) edit2 : and these polls are missing another 80 pp and psoe elected officers charged for corruption of the last week . 
  what would happen with rajoy and the leadership of the conservative party if they lose the control of the justice and the government before their illegal financing and other accusations expire ? 
   podemos with pablo iglesias is doing the discourse of we are the decent people that will recover the country from the criminals that robbed it . 
  and it 's working according to the [ polls ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/electionmonthlyaveragegraphspain2015.png ) ( purple ) and the eu elections . 
  edit : we had threads about them : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2l1e3r/podemos_european_left_largest_party_in_spain/ http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2l56u4/new_leftwing_party_podemos_overtakes_major/, 
   narrative of the old struggling a losing battle against the new . 
  i would say that the narrative is that after being decades looting , the corrupts of all the establishment ally to get some extra time to steal whatever remains and keep themselves out of prison . 
  because if they lose control of the government they will go to prison . 
  maybe i am projecting my country . 
  but , i think that sadly greece is similar . 
  italy has also lived similar situations . 
  edit : if berlusconi would have quitted politics 10 years ago he would have gone to prison . 
  i would say that the guys from new democracy and the pasok are in a similar situation . 
  ^ ( and my government ), 
  are you feeling spanish ? 
  i think that it 's not about border conflicts . 
  the south is poor and full of unemployment . 
  the most conservative city is ~ ~ fachadolid ~ ~ valladolid the capital of the region castille and leon . 
  all the region except the province of leon is very conservative . 
  galicia and murcia are also very conservative . 
  catalonia big right wing party is the only liberal party in spain . 
  that makes catalonia having a different center than the rest of the country . 
  aragon ( zaragoza actually , the rest is empty ) and asturies would be more progressive than average also . 
  madrid is more conservative than barcelona , but not the most conservative city ( but ruled by conservative mayors 20 years that have ruined the city with not really needed public works and olympic bids with associated constructions ) . 
  i probably should n't have put this in territorial divides . 
  22.2 % of unemployment for 2016 at spain . 
  they do n't even pretend to be believable . 
  or they expect a lot of people to leave without destroying many jobs with their absence . 
  if you are talking about the psoe , they are corrupt . 
  and that 's the government that i was meaning with half of the previous one deserves prison . 
  the corruption of the pp ( conservatives ) is higher , because they are better organized . 
  i mean schemes where the national leadership gets a percentatge of the black money in exchange of protection of the national leadership and their power over the justice . 
  building ghost airports ? 
  nuns varrying old people with dementia to vote because the party gives public money to the catholic church ? 
  ghost cinema studios ? 
  the psoe has a lot of corruption also , like the irregular employment regulations in andalusia ( that were used to pay full pensions to party members , that did n't deserve them ) , participation in the looting of some regional saving banks , training funds fraud with the collaboration of business and workers unions and suspicious public works contracts . 
  and they wo n't be acceptable in a normal country . 
  and that 's the reason why i would prefer podemos to the psoe despite that in ideology i am closer to the last one . 
  the pp has a corruption level so high that may make seem the psoe normal , but nobody should think that what the psoe has done these years is acceptable or they should go back to the government because the pp is even more corrupt . 
  edit : they do n't ask for money to the eu , only to the eurozone to perform quantitative easing to the spanish finances , or something similar where the ecb funds the spanish government . 
  you can ask them in their official forum / r/podemos . 
  it 's the official forum of the party . 
  linked from their web http://plaza.podemos.info/ i would like to see a foreigner asking those questions in their forum , i have the feeling that if i am the one to ask i wo n't be taken seriously or they will think that i am trolling . 
  however the answers that you would get are n't official or anything . 
  looking about information about them in english i found [ an article of the wsws ] ( http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2014/05/01/pode-m01.html ) angry because their program was n't enough socialist . 
  i am going to vote to a social-democratic valencian nationalist party , but i expect and want them to support podemos instead of the criminals that are ruling the country right now if they have to make the choice . 
  no for the economic policies , only because all the current government and half of the previous one deserve prison ( maybe the others also for complicity ) . 
  that 's usually included in the first one . 
  the progressive spain against the conservative . 
  the fight is represented by the picture to the right in the [ wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_two_spains ) . 
  no , if you ask our pm . 
  the reality ... :( * the two spains . 
  * catalonia * basque country * madrid against the rest . 
  * the rich against the south . 
  what am i missing ? 
  state intervention in the economy , nationalizations , a strong raise of the effective corporate tax , blockade to fiscal heavens , quantitative easing , strong rise of the minimum wage , basic income ... 
  i am against . 
  catalonia still wants it , even more . 
  the reaction of the spanish government to the scottish vote . 
  it was funny in a sad way . 
  they have forbidden the last version of the catalan referendum , a non-binding consultation or something like that . 
  and that reminded me this . 
   and a popular party in power and getting hit by corruption scandals on a ** monthly ** basis [ weekly basis ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2l1iyo/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_02112014/clqsz99 ) . 
   mportant conservative topics , like small government , supporting creating new small businesses , fighting beurocracy ... 
  these points are considered liberal at spain and the only party that considers itself liberal is cdc , ruling at catalonia . 
  the poll was done for [ a spanish mainstream newspaper ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/11/03/inenglish/1415011542_341454.html ) by metroscopia . 
  they usually favour the psoe . 
  even if they have been getting subsidies from conservative administrations and you can notices in the editorial line , and the appointment of a new director . 
  edit : whatever at the end pp and psoe are together in this .
