  all the taxes involved ( corporate taxes , and natural resources taxes ) are exclusive of the central government ( except in basque country and navarre ) , and all the possible costs and risk are in things that have to be paid by local and regional administrations . 
   the government has n't actually proposed anything , that was the exaggeration , rajoy is never so clear . 
  they have said that the laws will be applied and that everything is being done according to law . 
  but , they have n't addressed one single concern or offered something specific to calm the people . 
   or do you think that somebody as corrupt as paulino rivero would be against the petroleum extraction if his government gets a cut ? 
  edit : my english gets worse when i am actually angry . 
  are n't you trying to leave the country already ? 
  ( check flair ), 
  what rise of conservatives parties are you talking about ? 
  the fn is not exactly a traditionalist conservative party . 
  this does n't mean that the charity is the only source of income for this people , many people that goes for food and clothing to the catholic charities has welfare that they use for rent , utilities and transport . 
   monday through friday , griselys and her three children eat at a soup kitchen in villaverde and live in an apartment provided by ivima , the madrid housing authority , which she pays for with the $ 532 she gets every month from the regional government 's renta m\u00ednima de inserci\u00f3n ( rmi ) welfare program , which ensures a minimum living income . 
  the bridge is not needed without the port . 
  and the tram has had so many project * errors * that deserves a book , [ there is an article ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=es&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fpolitikon.es%2f2014%2f08%2f19%2funa-de-esas-infraestructuras-el-tranvia-de-cadiz%2f ) . 
  and years of prison for some people . 
   i doubt that . 
  if there would be enough housing , young italians would move out from their parents either when they start to study or atleast when they graduate and get their first job . 
  however as that is n't happening , i would think there to be a problem with the amount of housing . 
  if there is a country that has enough housing is spain and still ... 
  do you mean with ` left ' you mean ump ? 
  is complicated to extract information of the composition of the foreign debt . 
  the first creditor country to the spanish economy before the * bailout * [ was germany ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15748696 ) ( only private holders of the debt at that point ), 
  off topic ?

  what 's your explanation for the low german private demand ( compared with countrie with similar purchasing bubbles ) ? 
   so they did n't invest into shady things they loaned billions to spanish banks that now my government is paying back . 
  if that 's not a shady deal on a housing bubble i do n't know what it is . 
     savings are a problem only when literally nobody , not even the bank , spends or invests that money , this is what the normal keynesian models say . 
  i have been told that this is happening at germany . 
  is it true ? 
  why ? 
  [ the referendum has been suspended ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ht78m/spains_constitutional_court_suspends_catalan/ ) , i would be interested in participating on the thread if it happens anyway . 
  artur mas has presented secession plan , a white book of the national transition beside the poll , from the article :  at 7 p.m. in barcelona , he was presenting a 1,300-page white paper compendium on the `` national transition '' towards an independent state . 
  [ spanish ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20140929/54415529597/mas-presenta-libro-blanco-transicion-nacional.html ), 
  that 's before 2012 reform , now it should be 1,500 euros . 
  there is plenty of people that do n't know the existence of catalan or sardinian . 
  yes , the real budget is around 1 % of gdp . 
  and it 's not going to grow if the right stays in power and it 's going to fall if the left goes into power . 
  the grand coalition expected after 2015 will keep it with some symbolic cuts . 
  politically is impossible to raise the defence budget , and the government is unable to fulfil dozens of compromises that has done . 
  and this one is not even popular . 
  probably it should be also in corruption ,, 
  i added a others crimes section , but actually that 's not very big even if the media loves it . 
  the media once in a while jumps on it . 
  but spain is one of the less violent countries in the world . 
  it 's sort of strange with all the unemployment specially on immigrants ( [ over 30 % ] ( http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/1712423/0/tasa-paro/extranjeros/espana/ ) ) . 
  if i wanted to be representative of spanish mainstream news i would have at least as much football as corruption and politics ( sometimes connected ) . 
  and some advertorials : from calling the people to invest in a scam like gowex to the last marvel 's movie .

  it would make a person that is not mas having to make that decision with a more clear mandate . 
  erc , pro-independence left , leaded by oriol junqueras may be leading the polls right now replacing president mas ' ciu , the pro-independence liberal ( cdc ) - conservative ( udc ) coalition . 
  and the conservatives of udc are not very happy with going with the two first options anyway . 
  artur mas seems like he would be happy if somebody else crosses the rubicon for him . 
  i do n't think that a personal union is the same as a federation . 
  and there were still independent counts at el pallars sobir\u00e0 at least when the personal union started . 
  what 's the question mark ? 
   they will side with the law . 
  why ? 
  serious question . 
  is that high or low ? 
  at spain are both . 
  wait for the burst of the real estate bubble . 
  they are n't adjusting for purchasing power , probably ( i did n't check ), 
  if a employee takes 9 sick days or more becomes a justified lay-off ( since 2012 reform ) . 
  it 's very handy for getting rid of old employees with cancer . 
  who takes iberia once everybody has left ? 
  some minor annoyance with the health care insurance ( they may have to get a private one if they plan to stay long term in a country ) and they would have to register as residents if they plan to live in other country ( only like a third of the brits at spain bothers to register ) . 
  and it will be traumatic : the paperwork is in spanish !, 
  ( you can also get it in catalan if you ask for it ) . 
   kind of crazy in my opinion . 
  why ? 
  they probably earn more money ( if they were n't losing money ) . 
  demand for bars is at free fall at spain . 
  the number of bars has fallen more from 250,000 to 190,000 in the last 7 years . 
  [ 50,000 bars closed in 2008-2012 ] ( http://www.abc.es/economia/20130926/abci-cierre-bares-50000-201309251817.html ) [ 10,000 closed in 2013 ] ( http://cincodias.com/cincodias/2014/03/05/empresas/1394044208_666070.html ), 
  i would add from spain : * drama : [ the holy innocents ( 1984 ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088040/ ) . 
  a drama in the old southern spain . 
  it 's very realistic , even if it 's not like that anymore . 
  * comedy : torrente [ already said ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2hblpc/whats_your_favorite_movie_from_your_country/ckr6m6l ) , the first one is not so simple as he thinks torrente is an extrem parody of something real .
