  if we want to make the companies and rich people pay taxes we need to leave the eu . 
  do n't worry my government is not interseted in that . 
  remember all the people working for minimum wage currently . 
  they will get lower salaries and wo n't be able to pay their loans and will have less disposable income . 
  too many people with low salaries and high debts are hurting the economy . 
  demand is still a part of the economy . 
  you can expect more unemployment from retail comerce . 
  why do you think that lower salaries will generate more jobs ? 
  i expect this . 
  lower salaries : lower demand , layoffs in retail and consume related business , more defaults , more expenses in unemployment benefits , lower tax income ( corporations do n't pay taxes almost , and lower salaries means lower taxes ) . 
  about the motto of the protest the translation is : yes , it 's posible , but they do n't want it . 
  it is * stop the evictions . 
  * the protests are organized by the pah ( the platform for mortgage victims ), 
  ireland + netherlands antilles is the most common option with luxembourg , you are inside the common market . 
  before the eu a company that operated in spain needed to pay taxes in spain . 
  what 's special about that ?

  the austerity is great until affects you . 
  some context to the spanish decision . 
  * from the data of the report of the court of auditors that healthcare for foreign citizens in spanish nhs spending generated each year close to 1,500 million euros , of which the government only recovers 30 % . 
  thus , in the year audited by the court , 2009 , the expenditure was 1,362 million euros , of which only 445 million were billed by the nhs , leaving the other 917 million uncollected from countries of origin of each alien . 
  we are in a similar path . 
   justice minister alberto ruiz-gallard\u00f3n , of the ruling conservative popular party ( pp ) , has announced legal reforms that will eliminate abortion on demand until week 14 and go back to the earlier system . 
  we are doing reforms , we are making official the crony capitalism as our economic system . 
  seriously , saying that we are having a low progress is too optimistic . 
  they 're like us . 
  they cheated to join . 
  we do n't care . 
  it 's the most honest answer . 
  we know that is far away and seems to have well preserved nature . 
  and that peter jackson does movies there . 
  it 's all . 
  this is n't new . 
  the conservative party was founded by a former minister of the dictatorship . 
  however , they are becoming more right wing than usual lately [ spain 's partido popular blocks motion to denounce franco and pays tribute to the blue division ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/spain-s-partido-popular-blocks-motion-to-denounce-franco-1.1402043 ) . 
  [ blue division ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_division ), 
  i moved to sweden and you do n't care about the taxes if you have a real salary instead of the pocket change that they pay in spain . 
  the unemployment is also bad for the birthrate . 
  i think that in hungary should be the same and serbia seems to be worse than us . 
  the [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unemployment_benefits_in_spain ) contains the main info : ** requirements ** in order to receive a contributory benefit an employee must have contributed at least 360 days in the last 6 years , be registered with the employment authorities as available for work ** minimum / maximum ** * person with no children : 497.01 / 1087,21 euro * person with 1 child : 664,75 / 1242,52 euro * person with 2 or more children : 664,75 / 1397.84 euros ** the non-contributive benefins ** not in the english wikipedia . 
  it 's a 400 euros payment . 
  * if you are over 45 years you have right to six months if you retrieved benefits a year at least . 
  * if you are over 52 and you worked at least 6 years you can be paid 400 euros until you retire . 
  then you will be paid the minimum pension 450 euros because you did n't work enought for a full pension . 
  * you have the right to six months in other circunstances if the income of your family per capita is under 75 % of the minum wage . 
  * if you are an emigrant , you worked at least 6 months abroad and you come back to spain you can qualify to 18 months of benefits . 
  * if you went to jail 6 months you have 18 months of benefits . 
  two unemployed parents with two kids and do n't retrieve any benefits by default . 
  and it 's usual . 
  they are sent to live with the retired grandparents . 
  people without any work experience do n't have benefits never . 
  it 's out of proportion .
