  can you work legally ? 
  i never had a clean job in spain . 
  the government takes law enforcemente easy , i have never been officially unemployed in spain . 
  i have been in gray aereas usually . 
  however , besides internship and weird collaboration agreements university-foundation-fool ( that 's me ! ), 
  i had jobs paid social security a year and half . 
  however , when i had a * formal * job it was in illegal conditions : * i have been working as a illegally transfered worker hired by a private company working for a public adminstration . 
  * i also worked breaking collective agreement as a software developer with an administrative assistant contract ( employers and unions agreed in minimum wages for different positions , employers prefer to hire breaking the agreement paying less . 
  it 's not legal ) . 
  i moved to sweden some months ago . 
  it 's my first job without anything illegal . 
  [ are you sure ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/importance_of_religion_by_country ) spain officially is 50/50 . 
  but , it 's lower actually . 
  the conservatives have strong ties with the church and if you are conservative you are supposed to be catholic . 
  i find this amusing . 
  in a 4 years old poll : do you believe ... ? 
  that god exist : * practicing catholics : yes 89 % ... no 11 % * non practicing catholics : yes 54 % ... no 46 % * atheist : yes 0 % ... no 100 % http://imagenes.publico.es/resources/archivos/2008/12/25/1230219758457publiscopio-creenciasgc6.jpg, 
   you 're not allowed to be self-employed if you only offer services to a single entity , or something like that . 
  it ** was ** the same in spain . 
  but , it 's legal since the * free-market * reforms of 2010 . 
  we call that legal position * trabajadores aut\u00f3nomos econ\u00f3micamente dependientes * ( economically dependent self-employed ) . 
  you can register in this page and start to be an employee earning under minimum wage tomorrow https://sede.sepe.gob.es/contenidossede/generico.do?pagina=proce_ciudadanos/info_taed.html, 
   1 ) the minimum wage prevents a race to the bottom from happening . 
  if you are self-employed you can charge whatever you want . 
   2 ) it 's your country 's fault that its laws have loopholes like that . 
  improve your laws so that the minimum wage is actually applied . 
  is it different in your country ? 
  forget the pensions : * gib more monei to mai rilaible gobernment , nazi . 
   another case would be spain , but this one i know only second hand from a guy doing exactly what i described ( a few years ago ) . 
  if you are farm day laborer who worked at least 20 days ( this year , 35 days a normal year ) you get six months of unemployment benefits if you live in certain regions in spain like andalusia or valencia but not catalonia . 
  the government gives also money to municipalities with a high rate of workers in the program to employ them doing construction work ( usually unneeded ) when they are out of benefits http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/plan_de_fomento_del_empleo_agrario this is the biggest loophole , the benefits for unemployed or temporary workers in other sector are too weak actually . 
  before the arrest https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgzv02juol4, 
  i understand more about what 's happening in hungary now . 
  spanish conservatives : the spanish pp was founded by a former minister of our conservative militar dictatorship . 
  they give public money to companies owned by whoever bribes them , that does n't mean that they are pro free-market . 
  conservatives are paternalistic , authoritarian and want that the catholic church and the state control everything . 
  he announced [ structural reforms ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1degcl/french_president_announces_10_probusiness/ ) two weeks ago . 
  spain is in deeper shit and we changed our government a year and half ago and we are still waiting for the structural reforms . 
  government is raising taxes , and applying austerity to investment , r&d , education and health care . 
  that 's all . 
  i think that france is doing more to handle the situation than countries that are in deeper shit . 
  i am more worried about spain . 
  and then italy . 
  the people do n't blame the eu for the current shit . 
  we destroyed ourselves . 
  however , nobody is giving solutions and eu is not helping . 
  edit : btw , giving money to my corrupt government is not a solution . 
  maybe you should leave by yourself . 
  ~ ~ that 's female only . ~ ~ edit : by default , you can change it . 
  rate of people between 16 and 65 years working . 
  counting everybody : a student is an _ unemployed _ , a retired is an unemployed ... 
  there is a important discrepancy between unemployment and employment in countries like italy . 
  that 's due to that a lot of women are n't part of the labour market . 
  they do n't count as unemployed or employed usually . 
  graphs in spanish : * [ italy had a low employment rate always ] ( http://politikon.es/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ocupaci%c3%b3n.png ) and ireland destroyed as many jobs as spain or greece , but they are going out of the labour force . 
  * [ italy and ireland have high level of female inactivity ] http://politikon.es/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/inactividadmujeres.png translations : * alemania : germany * espa\u00f1a : spain * francia : france * irlanda : ireland * italia : italy * reino unido : united kingdom, 
  maybe we should break the union . 
  does it matter ? 
  government legislates by decree and applies the decrees . 
  spain does n't have separation of powers . 
  you can trust that germany will be a bully with weak countries . 
   still , from my point of view the real test to eu will be during the period just after the crisis when growth , hopefully , returns and things get back to ` normal ' . 
  this is the new normal . 
  that explains the thousands of layoffs and bankruptcies in retail trade . 
  this is from the previous banking crisis : [ santander chief pardoned in 17-year-old case ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/0/c7dee9b6-1764-11e1-b20e-00144feabdc0.html ) judicial system is very slow and government has been supporting the banks in all the cases . 
  the former vice-president of spain and former imf chief is facing court , however his party is ruling the country and they are trying to protect him . 
  i ca n't talk about other countries but i seriously think that bankia and him broke some laws . 
   [ fraud , price-fixing and falsifying accounts are among the accusations . 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/04/us-bankia-rato-idusbre8630mu20120704 ), 
   has the building been actually solidly build ? 
  yes , the buildings do n't fall usually , the government checks that . 
  my main concern will be building insulation that is not mandatory : * acustic insulation * thermal insulation  has constructor really done everything legitimately ? 
  is that your problem ? 
  the constructor tried to robe my parents , they had to go to court and find somebody to finish the construction . 
  would you buy that house ? 
  the construction quality is good . 
  the initial constructor only tried to robe everybody without doing real work . 
  you should check that the house is not in national parks and that stuff . 
   is the property really mine if i buy it ? 
  what do you mean ? 
   adding this new decree will only make thing worse . 
  why would this affect you ? 
  too many homeless will affect you .

   [ 80 spain ] ( http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/05/06/investing_overseas_baseline_profitability_index?page=0,2 ) spain brand \u00a9, 
  i did n't have a car . 
  it 's too expensive . 
  i use the past because i moved abroad , shitty salaries and high taxes are a bad mix . 
  [ edit ] no , however gas and circulation taxes are higher . 
  i am talking about spain but that tax has been raised in greece and portugal . 
  spain has a big car manufacturing industry ( all foreign companies ) that has fought successfully all the attempts to rise the taxes . 
  ford closed the factory in belgium to move production to spain recently . 
  they got public money for some cars sold until 2 months ago . 
  the government was giving public money to buy new cars . 
  they can do whatever they want with the government , they are * our * only industry http://www.diariomotor.com/2012/09/27/nuevo-plan-prever-2012-ayuda-para-la-compra-de-un-coche-nuevo/ it 's in spanish , sorry .
