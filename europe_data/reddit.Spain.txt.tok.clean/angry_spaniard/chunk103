  you seem to be living in 2008 . 
  that 's a long time ago . 
  you forgot that with 800 $ the average eastern european worker has wife and one kid and a car . 
  you can live alone in denmark with 800 $ . 
  i live in sweden , i think that the cost of living is similar . 
  you can live with 800 $ in stockholm . 
  you have too much welfare . 
  you need some austerity . 
  :p you do n't get anything from the government in spain . 
  the schoolarships are aimed to people living with their parents in poverty . 
   there was a 10.4 % `` death rate '' , which is the proportion of companies de-registering for vat purposes in the year , according to the latest figures published by the ons . 
  in comparison , the north-west has a 10.5 % new business birth rate but a 10.7 % death rate . 
  this surprised me . 
  i think that 60 % of business close in less than a year in spain . 
  however , opening a business in spain is * quick * ( for spain ) after the last reforms , however tt 's still actually expensive . 
  what 's more surprising ? 
  edit : constantino romero was 65 years old . 
  * alfredo landa and constantino romero died . 
  * king 's daughter was spared of the corruption inquiry by senior officials of the judicial system that reverted a decision of the judge . 
  * education : general education strike against education cuts and an education reform that increases the power of the catolic church and does some other polemic changes that are supported by the conservative party only . 
  * health care : illegal immigrants dying without medical care , disabled people should pay the prosthesis . 
  * more cuts in welfare for disabled people . 
  * government is going to bailout the private highways to nowhere built by construction companies . 
  * minor corruptions affairs as usual . 
  * tobacco and alcohol taxes are going to be raised . 
   i knew people in southern europe usually live with their parents until they marry , the people do n't marry anymore until they want to have kids . 
  however , people move out usually when they have a stable relationship . 
  i moved out at 23 , my parents married and moved out at 24 . 
  that was normal for their generation . 
  however , the average age is increasing because the people ca n't afford to live by themselves with the lower salaries and high unemployment . 
  the culture of home ownership also matters . 
  there are many couples who do n't consider moving in together until they bought a house together . 
  and with bubble prices first and then with the economic depression many ca n't afford a mortgage . 
  i was surprised by eastern europe . 
  did you pay your bills ? 
  when i was 18 i did n't have enough income to live on my own . 
  i moved out at 23 . 
   the debt as gdp percent is still inferior than germany 's [ not anymore ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=ds22a34krhq5p_#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=gd_pc_gdp&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:eu:non-eu&amp;idim=country:es:de&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=es&amp;dl=es&amp;ind=false ) it 's too late for spain . 
  read icanthelpit :(, 
  wait for it . 
  your salaries are high and your public sector is big , you have the best welfare in the union . 
  the eu will use any chance to destroy you . 
  maybe they will use the private debt . 
  maybe you will be unable to compete with the poverty level salaries that are paid in southern europe and eastern europe . 
  i will be surprised if you are n't asked to inflict austerity to your society . 
  universities did n't have big budgets these years . 
  did they misuse part of the budgets ? 
  yes , and their hiring rules are shit ( inbreeding ) , no mobility between universities , researchers need to waste too much time with bureaucracy . 
  i worked some time in the university i know how it works . 
  however , i think that we should solve the problems instead of cutting the funds . 
  i love that empty research labs that were built 4-5 years ago . 
  my former university is trying to rent them to private companies with not much success . 
  maybe he is talking about spain . 
  we have been hearing that if we cut expenses and salaries for public and private employees and raise taxes we will get jobs and growth too many years . 
  it 's hard to believe now . 
  should i believe that the new austerity pack will save us ? 
  the public spanish funding will be frozen after the last cuts until 2020 . 
  the forecast expects that the eu funding to increase from 5 % of the funds to 15 % and the private sector to cover the rest of the growth . 
  \u00bf do you think that 's realistic ? 
  i do n't understand why somebody cares about the government forecasts . 
  [ edit ] : btw the 1.4 % gdp funding was in 2011 before of the last cuts . 
  25 % in 2012 and 7 % in 2013 http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-01-16/features/sns-rt-us-spain-sciencebre90f0bz-20130115_1_prime-minister-mariano-rajoy-research-and-development-madrid, 
  all the counties can base their economy in exports and low salaries . 
  sure !, 
  all countries can be net exporters !, 
  i am sure the current cuts in r&d , education , infrastructures are going to improve the finances . 
  i mean people are dropping college because them ca n't afford it . 
  they ca n't also join vocational education or find a job . 
  they stay unemployed living with their parents . 
  that 's a great plan . 
  we wasted 4.4 % of the gdp in bailouts for banks the last year . 
  and now we are going to bailout the private highways to nowhere , with $ 608 millions initially . 
  i ca n't find info in english http://www.lavanguardia.com/economia/20130508/54373920838/valorada-608-millones-sociedad-publica-rescate-autopistas.html we can pay that but no , we ca n't afford r&d , we ca n't afford education and we ca n't afford universal health care anymore . 
  * that 's bullshit . 
  * the royal family has a budget of a 8.2 millions and a real cost of $ 60 millions . 
  spain expended 5 % of the gdp in education that 's 55 billions . 
  btw , i am republican . 
  more austerity for the education . 
  welfare for disable people and programs to help young people to emancipate also enjoy the austerity . 
   this amounts to a double assault on citizens : they have not only lost jobs and benefits , but are seeing higher prices . 
  they need immigration with the current demographic situation . 
  if somebody goes to spain to enjoy the welfare he is going to be disappointed . 
  i wish upyd was more respectable . 
  it 's a toll road . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/autopista_ap-7 there is also the n-340 , but it 's not a real highway . 
  i was talking about both things . 
  there is no free highway and there is no high speed train . 
  i did n't say that . 
  i was saying that the spanish government invest in connecting the capital with everywhere with trains and highways . 
  however , there are no investments in connections between big metropolitan areas that are close to each other . 
  two big metropolitan areas in the mediterranean without good connections . 
  that sucks . 
  and it 's a political decision . 
  the government prefers to invest in building highways from the capital to 80.000 inhabitants cities than connections between the other big spanish cities . 
  ps : i am from valencia . 
  if you say that i am catalan i am supposed to get pissed off with that . 
   is there any urge to equalize the obligations of the regions ? 
  i want that , but it 's not a popular position . 
  there is a small party that supports that . 
  however every region has the same rights and obligations except the basque regions ( basque country and navarra ) * pp ( conservatives-ruling spain ) : they want to keep the basque fiscal privileges because they have had the privileges 300 years and then it 's a tradition .
