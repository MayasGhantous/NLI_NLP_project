  * basque parties : fiscal privileges or independence . 
  they are hapy because they have fiscal privileges * ciu ( catalan conservatives-ruling catalonia ) : fiscal privileges or independece . 
  * psoe ( social-democratic ) : fiscal privileges only for basques as usual . 
  * iu ( ex-communists now anti-capitalism ) : they do n't talk about such mundane issues . 
  * upyd ( conservative party founded by former psoe 's member ) : the only party that supports removing the basque privileges . 
   you need to have the ability to fire anybody at any time . 
  european companies need to have the ability to for example imitate what jack welsch did in ge ... you have the ability to fire anybody at any time . 
  however you need pay different amounts of money . 
  a company having record profits can fire anybody paying 33 days per year counting since the last labour market reform and 45 days per year for previous experience , this is due to that the court ruled that you ca n't reduce layoffs payments retroactively because constitution says that reforms harmful to the people can be applied retroactively . 
  there is a maximum of 42 months with the previous laws and 24 months months with the new law . 
  but you can fire anybody . 
  what 's the law in finland ? 
  spain : * you can fire employees with temporary contracts for free the first three years ( two years before ) . 
  new : you can fire for free permanent employees under 30 years the first year . 
  if your company is losing money or revenue ( even having a net profit ) the government the firing costs will be 20 days per year and the government will pay 8 days per year . 
  and the government allows you to use interns as employees and you can fire them for free and you can pay them under minimum wage . 
  * spain has maybe the strictest personal debts legislation if you have debts they are for forever until you pay them . 
  * culture and language : catalan culture and language are threatened due to immigration from others parts of spain and south america . 
  the immigrants speak spanish and keep their culture and traditions . 
  the spanish language and culture are very strong . 
  the cinema is in spanish , the tv is in spanish , the books are published in spanish ... 
  there are limits to what catalan government can do to preserve language and culture inside spain . 
  * financial : catalonia is the biggest contributor to the spanish budget . 
  however the basque country is richer than catalonia . 
  but the basque country has fiscal privileges and only gives to the spanish government for the services that retrieves , catalonia pays for the services that retrieves and to a fund to help the poor regions ( andalusia and extremadura ) to have the same public services . 
  the unfairness is clear . 
  but they do n't to get help from the basques to pay the services of the poor regions , they want to stop paying them . 
  * the spanish government favours the capital too much like uk and france . 
  however the catalan government does the same with barcelona . 
  [ edit ] example : [ high-speed lines ] ( http://www.adif.es/en_us/infraestructuras/lineas_de_alta_velocidad/lineas_de_alta_velocidad.shtml ) there is no connection between barcelona and valencia ( 2nd and 3rd cities of the country ) , there is no free highway neither . 
  if catalonia proclaims independence and starts to behave like an independent state . 
  what do you think that spain should do ? 
  yes , spain can do a bloodbath . 
  but , i do n't believe that you advocate that . 
  i am not sure . 
  the catalan government and rich elite are more interested in getting a special fiscal status like basque country than in independence . 
  the independence for them is a plan b. 
  however , the most popular option is the independence not that . 
  if catalonia proclaimed independence , would you want to go to war ? 
  are you serious ? 
  where are you from ? 
  the corpse is rotting . 
  * metro derailment accident that killed 43 persons could have avoided easily , we had a tv show ( salvados ) about it and then a big publc debate http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/valencia_metro_derailment * miguel \u00c1ngel rodr\u00edguez , caused a traffic accident driving drunk . 
  he is a conservative poilitician and a member of the ruling party . 
  * more details about the austerity ; e.g the government will cut welfare for disabled persons . 
  spain is full of abandoned villages . 
  more than one hundred in catalonia only . 
  spain raised the retirement age 2 years ago http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/04/24/inenglish/1366815611_896390.html  under changes to the state pension system approved in 2011 , the retirement age is being raised gradually from 65 to 67 years in 2027 . http://www.advoco.es/advice/14-health-a-social-security/100-spanish-pension-benefits-2012.html  the retirement age will increase by around a month and a half every year from 2013 so that for example , by 2018 , the retirement age will be 65.5 . 
  do you love me ? 
  that 's nothing , i mean a real ghost airport . 
  would it happen at any other place ? 
  ;-) some extra info http://www.npr.org/2013/01/29/170561273/how-a-spanish-city-went-boom-then-bust i ca n't find a good link in english , this headline says city but was the regional government . 
  it also talks about the crazy museum city that cost more $ 1 billion to build . 
  do n't forget the [ ghost airport !,

  and he was acquitted by a jury , 5-4 . 
  canary islands are n't a fiscal heaven . 
  http://i.imgur.com/7b57rse.jpg corrupt regional president driving a ferrari in a political act with fernando alonso and the mayor of valencia.they got us a formula 1 grand prix paying twice as much the others and they did unbreakable with a huge penalty . 
  their popularity increased after it . 
   however , we expect unemployment to stabilise below 30 % next year i love how it sounds . 
  :( btw , i find amusing when somebody talks like the spanish government was concerned about unemployment . 
  i 'm not an advocate for terrorism either . 
  but i think it 's going to happen . 
  the government does n't care about strikes , demostrations , escraches , collecting signatures ... after a strong campaign of peaceful harassment ( escraches ) spanish government has approved a law strengthening evictions and perpetual mortgage debts , after the eu earlier declared illegal the previous law . 
  http://www.eitb.com/en/news/life/detail/1303652/spain-escraches--spaniards-take-fight-evictions-doorsteps/ [ edit ] if you make impossible peaceful change you make inevitable violent change . . 
  we have the 30 % unemployment now , we have millions living under poverty level now . 
  the banks are being bail out now . 
  50.000 evictions every year . 
  the education and the health care are being destroyed now . 
  are you saying that the people should wait to the next elections ? 
  it will be too late . 
  maybe , it 's too late anyway . 
   i ca n't see them reducing salaries anytime soon . 
  the salaries are being reduced , an average of 12 % in the public sector and the private sector is difficult to say due to the massive violation of labour laws . 
  i know that the person who replaced me at my job when i fled to sweden makes 10 % less . 
  and i was underpaid . 
  the average salary has not gone done much , due to that the temporary workers and hired last lost their jobs first and they have lower salaries . 
  and how do you get that ? 
  with smiles ? 
   200,000 jobs ok , we lose that every three months . 
  do you have a better idea ? 
  because we are running out of ideas . 
  trying to kill a major ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  if politicians fear for their lives they may try to solve the situation that generates the social unrest . 
  nothing , politicians will postpone anything resembling a solution . 
  welcome to new romania . 
  what are the chances of cyprus leaving the euro ? 
  short-term ? 
  it does n't seems probable . 
  the major parties support the euro . 
  long-term ? 
  who knows ? 
  we are in uncharted waters . 
  economic depresion and unemployment above 25 % until 2018 , and no recovery in sight . 
  500 evictions every day . 
  and this is only the beginning . 
  [ interm\u00f3n oxfam ] ( http://www.intermonoxfam.org/es/sala-de-prensa/nota-de-prensa/espana-podria-alcanzar-18-millones-de-pobres-en-una-decada-si-se-manti ) says that 38 % of the spanish population will live in poverty in 2022 . 
  it 's a train !!, 
  i do n't understand what 's going to change with the capital gains taxes .
