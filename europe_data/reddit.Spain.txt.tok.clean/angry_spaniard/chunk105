   a few last ideas , like removing the obligation for private companies to publicly declare their revenue/cash flow , which may help keep competitors from keeping tabs on their french competition , but it may help raise the valuation of french startups as well i think that everybody should make public their tax returns , people or companies . 
  otherwise , these are measures that i like . 
  do not expect the spanish government apply any of them . 
  and justice works . 
  the spanish royal family has some power and use it for [ corruption . 
  ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/mar/04/spain-king-juan-carlos-scandal ), 
  i was giving you context for my question . 
  this is a left leaning forum and i translated the most popular coments . 
  i think that this can be interesting . 
  the political situacion is becoming uncomfortable in spain, 
  i liked this [ story ] ( http://www.abc.es/local-toledo/20130427/abci-parado-lleva-cinco-meses-201304271545.html ), 
  star a business is easier than 4 years ago . 
  however , no real tax incentives or any help from the government . 
  the creation of new businesses and the bankruptcies are in all time records . 
  starting the business is the * easy * part , the problems begin with the clients that do n't pay you and the government that request the vat taxes of that income you did n't get . 
  besides that the goverment does n't help you to get the bills paid . 
  2 . some non-sense talk , but nothing happens here . 
  the government plans to make easier construction in beachfront . 
  opposite direction . 
  the biggest cuts have been in education , r&d and infrastructure , 4 . 
  the conservative party is involved in too much corruption , including the current president of spain . 
  the government is working in the opposite direction because they want to hide the rampant corruption . 
  it 's done without agreements with the unions and with some strikes . 
  salary cuts of between 5 % and 12 % bigger in education of course . 
  spain has lost 200 000 public employees . 
  spain has 46,900,000 inhabitants and 2,900,000 public employees today . 
  i want to remember you that the unions are really weak at spain . 
  the government can do whatever they want without agreements . 
  the official public sector has a lot of restriction in hiring and firing and it 's mostly ok . 
  however the government can create companies that do n't follow the public recruitment rules , like the public tvs . 
  my regional government had a public tv with more employees that the national public tv . 
  this is a problem with some regional governments and local governments that did some crazy things and hired party members using that companies . 
  the problem has been really big at valencia , galicia and andalusia . 
  what do you expect from spain ? 
  now i have two questions . 
  what do you expect from spain ? 
  * a combination of a wide range of initiatives would be helpful . 
  * explain , please . 
  sometimes . 
  but we are talking about spain nowadays . 
  it 's not working . 
  the depression is worse than before . 
  spain is losing jobs quicker than before . 
  as spaniard i want to say that allowing your government to gift electrical companies to their friends as a monopoly is a bad idea . 
  expect 50 % increase in prices and worse service . 
  are they lower ? 
  i am software developer and me and some coworkers got a job offer from brazil earning twice as much in spain . 
  i did n't check ppp , because i was moving to sweden and brazil has other problems but you can find higher salaries for skilled labour at south america . 
  there is a shortage of skilled labor in most of south america . 
  most companies do not have significant income from abroad . 
  low wages often means fewer customers . 
  and that means that you are going to fire more employees because you have fewer consumers . 
  companies that live of domestic demand are having a really bad time right now . 
  higher income tax , higher vat , lower wages for everybody whatever the employer can afford them . 
  and then fire the employees that became unneeded due to the depressed demand . 
  great !, 
  yes , the companies can hire , but why would they want to hire in spain ? 
  there are countries much cheaper , if that 's what matters . 
  and denmark is more expensive than spain , do you think that denmark needs lower wages ? 
  i do n't understand that theory . 
  why do you think that lower wages means higher employment ? 
  i moved to sweden . 
   depends what those taxes are used for . 
  if they 're invested in education , infrastructure , and a strong social security net that allows citizens to take risks without fearing for their children 's future , i 'd say `` yes '' it 's the opposite , [ budgets 2008-2013 ] ( http://especiales.lainformacion.com/economia/presupuestos-generales-estado ) . 
  * education : central government handles scolarships and some other things : 2008 : 11 billiones . 
  2013 : 2 billions . 
  * infraestructures : 2008 : 14 billions , 2013 6 billions * social security net : more budget , but more people . 
  the average benefits are lower . 
  two millions unemployed do n't retrieve any benefit . 
   if that energy is unsustainable , then yes . 
  incentives should be put in place to encourage investment in sustainable energy sources -- in spain 's case , that 'd probably be solar power first , hydroelectric power second , which would eventually lead to very cheap energy . 
  * solar : [ no really ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/14/us-spain-renewables-idusbre91d1a020130214 ) * hydroelectic power : built mostly in the dictatorship and the first social democratic government . 
  [ two former presidents work for energy companies ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/11/endesa-aznar-iduslde70a1ap20110111 ) the prices are regulated by the government . 
   if the alternative to `` lower wages '' is `` no wages '' , which is what the ~ 30 % unemployed are experiencing , then that 's the way it has to go . 
  if there 's another alternative , i 'd go for that . 
  lower wages means lower demand , employees being unable to pay the mortgages , workers under the poverty threshold , more empty homes and emigration of skilled workers . 
  do n't come back . 
  why are returning to spain ? 
  what 's your background ? 
  there are people that believe the spanish government forecasts ? 
  amazing !, 
  they also said that they did n't fund the election campaigns illegally . 
  spanish software developer in sweden here . 
  i had a job and emigrated anyway . 
  i had a job in spain and emigrated anyway . 
  working conditions have degraded a lot including the companies that have great profits . 
  if you want to know about salaries for software developers in spain . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1d2jjl/spain_unemployment_hits_new_record_of_27_percent/c9me4pb ), 
  the small business owner can be a evil guy . 
  i worked for a small spanish business . 
  he cheated with his taxes , used internships as workforce , payments under table , broke a lot of laws , violated the collective agreement . 
  a small software development and it services company with 20 employees and 20 colleges students doing internships . 
  mcdonalds has better working conditions that the small bar usually . 
  the employees do n't work overtime , do n't retrieve payments under the table and follows the collective agreements . 
  i am tired of that small business crap . 
  * the right structural reforms * do you mean higher taxes , more expensive energy , lower wages , no formal courses for unemployed , more expensive college , more expensive vocational education and worse mandatory education ? 
  because that 's what we got . 
  ( i moved to sweden . ), 
  you can fire all your employees legally at spain , to fire you need to notify with between 15 days and to 2 months in advance depending on the collective agreement and category of employee . 
  there are layoffs restrictions for pregnant or on maternity leave .
