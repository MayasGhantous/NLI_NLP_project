  more than two years in a big city ? 
  the city hall does n't want and ca n't afford to buy the houses . 
  the idea is getting them on the market for sale or rent . 
  yes , and the most representative unions are the ones that get the best results in such elections .

   i do n't know anyone who knows someone who 's been evicted . 
  remember that if you are the kind of people that hangs on an english speaking web site you are n't representative of the lower levels of spanish population . 
  people usually has friends and families of similar social status . 
  this point is more for the journalist than for you , but whatever . 
  i know people that has lost their house , but without eviction and reaching an agreement before going to court . 
  the only one in my close circle is an uncle that did some stupid decisions running a business . 
  and that did n't make him homeless even if he had to go to live with the grandparents ( he also divorced around the same time , so his wife did n't maintain him , making everything better ) .

  rajoy/pp is still first , but he has bad relations with all the other parties and he would be lucky if he gets one third of the parliament . 
  however politics is the art of the possible , so he may stay . 
  or the psoe may lead a minority government backed by podemos and c 's . 
  who knows ? 
  do n't expect a clear majority and podemos will probably get some points less than the psoe . 
  if that party is n't eurosceptic , then it is pointless anyway .

  they expect to be allowed to flee .

   nothing . 
  stay until the war is over , then back to their countries .

  you end with refugees that stay decades and have children or even being born in your country .

  something better than what ana mato , former spanish healthcare minister , said : `` it is the first time that i see that jaguar that the police found at my garage . '', 
  you can get something like that for a couple of millions at spain and live from the other 5 . 
   the median price in the city is about $ 1500 / m \u00b2 , although the suburbs also have some pricier apartments , for example : http://www.warzelnia.com that is more than the prices at valencia ( spain ) . 
  even if it is way less than at madrid or barcelona . 
   surely it must be possible to have this overturned in a court of law ? 
  why ? 
  everything is conforming to law . 
  the law is at the constitutional court and in some years it may be nullified . 
  it depends of which parties have the majority at the court and how blatantly partisan they dare to be . 
  still it does n't mean that all the fines and punishments derived from the law will be reverted . 
  the delay interest rates went up to 25 % in mortgages at spain were declared illegal by an european court due to something about usury in the echr , but the payments and evictions derivated of those terms were n't reverted . .

  wikipedia article for [ rodrigo rato ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rodrigo_rato ) . 
  and the article . 
  i am not sure if it is ok copying an article under paywall . 
   spain 's government was on tuesday facing a potentially damaging scandal after the country 's interior minister was revealed to have held a private meeting in his office with rodrigo rato , the disgraced former head of the imf at the centre of multiple fraud investigations . 
   jorge fern\u00e1ndez d\u00edaz , the interior minister , said he would give parliament a full explanation of the meeting with mr rato , but his officials have insisted the talks were `` exclusively personal '' . 
  a statement from the ministry said the discussion between the two men did not touch on any of the ongoing judicial investigations against mr rato . 
   opposition leaders , however , sense an opportunity to inflict damage on the government ahead of a regional election in catalonia next month and a general election later in the year . 
  `` when a minister receives a formal suspect it can never be a personal issue , '' said antonio hernando , a senior socialist party member . 
   he also pointed to public comments by mr rato himself , who said he spoke to the minister `` about everything that is happening to me '' . 
   the meeting , which was first reported by the el mundo daily , appeared at the very least politically awkward . 
  mr rato is widely regarded as a toxic figure in spain , and has been shunned by former colleagues in the ruling popular party ( pp ) , at least in public . 
   the former finance minister and deputy prime minister was for decades one of the most high-profile figures in the pp , before becoming the first spaniard to head the imf . 
   his reputation was demolished , however , during his stint as chairman of bankia , the sprawling financial group that came close to collapse in 2012 and eventually had to be rescued by the government . 
  hundreds of thousands of retail investors were wiped out in the process , sparking widespread anger and numerous law suits . 
   mr rato has since been named as a formal suspect in at least two criminal probes related to bankia , including a scandal over the alleged misuse of corporate credit cards by top managers . 
   his standing reached a new low in april , when he was briefly arrested in connection with a probe into alleged tax fraud and money-laundering . 
  television footage showed him being unceremoniously pushed into a police car -- a public shaming that is likely to mark mr rato in the eyes of the spanish public for years . 
   mariano rajoy , spain 's prime minister , on tuesday declined to comment on the controversy . 
  but with media interest showing little sign of waning , the issue has -- at least for the moment -- deflected attention from the theme he and other pp leaders are seeking to push in the forthcoming elections : spain 's accelerating economic recovery . 
   according to at least one recent poll , the country 's new-found economic confidence is indeed showing signs of boosting the pp 's standing after years of decline . 
  the cis research institute said last week that the pp had shown a marked improvement in its poll ratings , and was now on course to win 28 per cent of the vote -- more than three points ahead of the second-placed socialists . 
  that would still leave mr rajoy far short of the absolute majority he currently enjoys , but well placed to lead the next government . 
  you should n't use the army to do the work of the police . 
  ask anybody that has lived at a dictatorship . 
  and tax cuts . 
  [ the government approved tax cuts starting the 1st of july ] ( http://www.thinkspain.com/news-spain/26112/rajoy-cuts-income-tax-retentions ) the 3rd of july . 
  i have seen many times tax rises with emergency procedures . 
  but it is the first time that i see them for cuts . 
  edit : it is kind of real even if it has weak fundamentals ; tourism is booming , car manufacturing is growing , the financial sector is giving loans again . 
  edit2 : i would recommend to watch [ this presentation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p7bj3okh7k ) of the full professor of economics of the university of pennsylvania jes\u00fas fern\u00e1ndez villaverde . 
  it 's in spanish the subtitles translated to english can sort of work .

  it is not realistic to ask you to watch a one hour video so : tldr : the structural problems of the spanish economy are n't solved . 
  the current recovery is due to the internal devaluation ( fall of 20 % in salaries , 40 % of prices of housing and real estate ) , the cleanup of the financial sector , ecb intervention and cheap oil . 
  the economy is as unsustainable without real reforms as it was at 2002 , or even worse due to the terrible demographic situation ( three years in a row of population fall , and the 2nd lowest birth rate in western europe after portugal ) . 
  he also proposes some reforms . 
  but i am stopping here . 
  is he even a citizen of any other country ? 
  do you think that exile should be a legal punishment for citizens of a country ? 
  yes that is true . 
  and the economic reasons layoffs are very fluffy and many go to court in lawsuits that take years . 
  so in general is better to reach an agreement . 
  i did n't want to get into details . 
  [ the average duration of a contract is 56.3 days ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3amuoo/at_spain_25_of_employment_contracts_last_less/ ) , down from 75.6 days at 2009 ( before we started to liberalize the labour market ) . 
  25 % of contracts last less than a week .
