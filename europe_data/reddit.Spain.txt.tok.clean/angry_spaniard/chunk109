  difficult is not the word . 
  spain has employment at * will * . 
  you can always fire , ~ ~ even ~ ~ except if we are talking about a pregnant woman ( restrictions apply for union representative ) and without economic reasons . 
  however , unjustified layoffs can be expensive , they go to ~ ~ 35 ~ ~ 22 days for year employed . 
  to a maximum of two years of salary . 
  disciplinary layoffs are free . 
  economic reasons layoffs are 20 days per year . 
  [ a source ] ( http://cincodias.com/cincodias/2012/03/22/economia/1332555819_850215.html ) , not 22 ( what / u/giputxilandes said ) . 
  edit : / u/samuel79s correction about pregnancy is right . 
  [ see ] ( https://www.google.se/search?q=estatuto+trabajadores+despido+nulo+embarazadas&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=-wbbvy2tfimfgws55js4bq ) . 
  but , i remember , employers ' union asking to reform things like this . 
  but it did n't happen . 
  gypsies do it . 
  it can happen also at spain . 
  yes , but the spanish government has said that they wo n't collaborate as the plan requires to work . 
  a plan is a list of things that do n't happen . 
     the first one is that catalonia 's culture is quite different from spain 's . 
  many people here do n't identify themselves as spaniards , but rather as catalans . 
  these are the people that have traditionally wanted the independence ( not that many people ) . 
  what 's spanish culture ? 
  is my culture spanish as catalan-speaking valencian ? 
  what about galician ? 
  andalusian ? 
  aragonese ? 
  castilian ? 
  manchegan ( sub-castilian culture ? 
  canary islands ? 
  this country has big variations in culture from region to region . 
  submerged economy by country ? 
  * spain 19 % * sweden 14 % * germany 13 % * greece 24 % * poland 24 % * lithuania 28 % [ source at page 4 ] ( https://www.atkearney.com/documents/10192/1743816/the+shadow+economy+in+europe+2013.pdf ) and you can compare with [ unemployment figures ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z8o7pt6rd5uqa6_#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:sa&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:eu:non-eu&amp;idim=country:pl:lt&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) . 
  and i want to insist that in my experience most of the shadow economy is in the hands of employed people . 
  we had similar levels of shadow economy when we had 8 % of unemployment . 
  a guy that i know that does it may earn $ 3,000 in a year , you do n't live very well with that here . 
  and he also did under-table jobs when he was employed . 
  btw , most of the people that does submerged economy that i know have regular jobs and do their informal jobs in their free time . 
  even some web developers and it people doing some small free lance work under table for small companies . 
  or a doctor with a private clinic . 
  * menos de un a\u00f1o * is * less than a year * . 
  * seg\u00fan el sexo * is * according to gender * * seg\u00fan la edad * is * according to age * * hombres * is * men * . 
  * mujeres * is * women * i do n't know if i need to translate more . 
  for me it is obvious . 
  no , of course . 
  i am spanish . 
  the cdu has moved to the left with merkel , but the spd moved to the right with gerhard schr\u00f6der . 
  it is very common that the two big parties sort of defend the same political positions , i am not sure what differences there are in effective policies at spain between pp and psoe . 
  i mean they have some differences on education if the catholic doctrine subject should count for calculating the graduation grade of the students and stuff like that . 
  no , some people wants one . 
  i personally oppose . 
  sorry busy may answer later more . 
  [ table with neet percentatge 2008 and 2011 ] ( http://nadaesgratis.es/wp-content/uploads/dolado4.jpg ) hard to find . 
  spain has 49.9 % of youth unemployment , but only 21 % of the youth is actually jobless and 21 % working , the others are on education . 
  youth at spain is from 16 to 24 years old ( both included ) so most are on some type of education including many of the ones working . 
  i guess that this must be similar at italy . 
   this is fmi torpedoing the deal now , which is something they 've been doing for a while . 
  the deal deserves to be torpedoed if it is in unrealistic terms . 
  the same in capitalist russia . 
  and also [ he went with his mistress ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/04/spain-king-juan-carlos-scandal ) :  sayn-wittgenstein 's name first became public knowledge after she appeared as the mystery woman who travelled to botswana when king juan carlos -- then honorary president of the spanish branch of the world wildlife fund ( wwf ) -- secretly joined a free elephant hunt . 
  in general he was also ignoring his duties and leaving his son in charge for things like this . 
  and it is not like he had many . 
  and he had more scandals : * king spent $ 2m in public funds on personal hunting lodge . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/20131219/spains-king-spent-2m-on-hunting-pavilion ) * it has been proven that the king tried to cover the noos affair . 
  [ link ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.abc.es%2f20120311%2fespana%2fabcp-casa-advirtio-2005-inaki-20120311.html&amp;edit-text= ) * the [ princess cristina was involved ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/10555615/king-of-spains-daughter-cristina-summoned-in-money-laundering-case.html ) * the spanish royal family paid reforms corinna 's house , the * friend * of the king , with public funds [ link ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2ffinanzas.excite.es%2fla-reforma-de-la-casa-de-corinna-en-el-pardo-fue-pagada-con-dinero-publico-n33941.html&amp;edit-text= ) in addition , and this is a personal opinion , he talked and behaved in public like an alcoholic . 
  and his personal life was train wreck , with the bastards doing paternity lawsuits and ; not that we should care , the old queen apparently was living with the greek royal family in london at that time . 
  [ he gets drunk , hunts and has 100 bastards . 
  what king i am talking about ? 
  but , i do n't know how to dance flamenco . 
  flamenco is typical in a region where less than 20 % of spaniards live . 
  [ die linke ] ( https://www.greenleft.org.au/node/59515 ) i remember a guy from iu said so . 
  but checkin i found that the coalition is divided about the question , as usual , and [ they are having an internal debate about it ] ( http://www.teinteresa.es/politica/garzon-posicion-rescate-entiende-absolutamente_0_1395460671.html ) . 
  i am not sure if this is convenient for his interests because these voters are going back to psoe or c 's . 
  metroscopia did a poll putting psoe in front for first time in years , and it has n't been because pp is going down more , it has been more or less stable . 
  [ the profile ] ( https://twitter.com/pablo_iglesias_ ) . 
  the number two of the party [ has also said that they would vote to start negotiations for the bailout in the spanish parliament ] ( http://www.publico.es/politica/inigo-errejon-votaria-al-rescate.html ) ( yes , he looks like a kid ) , unlike die linke in germany or united left at spain that said that they would vote against . 
   `` you did n't manage to find a job during the last 2 years , so you might as well become homeless instead '' . 
  would they become homeless without benefits ? 
  do n't your families take care of each other ? 
  i mean i know that if things went really bad for me i would go back with my parents . 
  my 54 years old uncle , that is not getting any unemployment benefits , has been living with my grandparents the last two years ; and he will with them until they die and then inherit the right to use the house until his death even if there are more siblings . 
  if greece has n't left the union already it probably wo n't even then . 
   using these funds to build ghost airports to bloat their economy who has n't built some ghost airports ? 
  seriously , i do n't think that the bottom of the service sector , or the fruit pickers at croatia are better treated than the spanish , so you may want to be more aware of your environment . 
  and the spanish ones are treated like shit paid minimum wage salaries , but hired for less hours than they work , are fired if they get pregnant or refuse to do unpaid overtime , work with per-project or fixed duration contracts without any job security ... slavery is relative . 
  but if we are realistic the workers in the us are n't in hell and the europeans in heaven ( not all of them at least ) . 
  [ only 57.88 % of the jobless registered at the public employment agency gets benefits ] ( http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2015/01/05/empleo/1420450862_340352.html ) . 
  after you are used all your contributory benefits , and only if you had , you have the right to 6 months of non-contributory of 426 euros/month if you have been seeking employment actively and used the ( useless ) public unemployment services . 
  this program has been extended to 6 extra months for some special cases since march ( before the local and regional elections of may ) to the end of the year ( national elections at november-december ) . 
  and there is almost a million of people considered jobless that is not seeking employment actively . 
  and only 10 % of the job-seekers get benefits at greece . 
  sweden and denmark have universal benefits even for people that has never worked like ireland . 
  [ it was discussed recently ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3bri60/denmark_to_cut_asylumseeker_benefits_under_new/cspoind?context=3 ) . 
  pyramid ? 
  we use ghost airports as mausoleum at my country . 
  get to the 21th century !, 
  and they are effective as such , we are certainly going to remember them a long time . 
  twist : glorious viktor orb\u00e1n becomes the emperor of the 2nd austro-hungarian empire and stays * lucid * more than mugabe . 
  and it is an absolute monarchy . 
  why ? 
  i am still a spaniard . 
  germany ( or sweden ) is not most of the world , most of the world sucks , and germany also has things that do worse than other countries . 
  i still do n't understand why health care is organized as it is or why the country does n't try to do something about the birth rate ; other countries like denmark , sweden or france have more family friendly policies in general .
