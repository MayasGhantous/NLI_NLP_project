  that 's not so bad , poland is very cheap . 
  the living standards in poland are similar to the spanish ones and probably will be much better in some years despite the nominally higher wages in spain .

   what do you mean by `` this situation '' exactly/what incentive does the iu have to crack down on this illegal practice now ? 
  ** this situation ** derived from the construction madness : * 25 % of unemployment classic . 
  * 3.5 millions of empty/closed houses that nobody uses for living or second residences . 
  * 25 % of of the economy was construction and auxiliary sectors . 
  that disappeared and has left a big hole in our economy that partially explains the first point . 
  * massive private debt . 
  * many sparsely populated new developments that more to public administrations than the taxes that they generate . 
  * 3 millions of long term jobless many of them unskilled construction workers . 
  * the rule of law is seen as a not funny joke ... a construction company can build a golf course with 200 homes in a natural park and the justice will say that is illegal 7 years after is finished . 
   what incentive does the iu have to crack down on this illegal practice now ? 
  they are supposed to be a left wing party that push the defense of the environment , publicly controlled urban development , the law is the same for everybody ... real incentives ? 
  good question , after all these years of rampant disregard of the law seeing the guy that built a ghost airport and claims that won the lottery 8 times free , it looks like going for the small guy . 
  and like with communism everybody defends the rule of the law for the others , not for themselves and many people has a relative or a friend that owns an illegal house . 
  however , during the campaign looked good . 
  my * prediction * , they will accept the amnesty that the psoe has announced with some minor modifications . 
  and another one : the anger towards the construction sector is calming down and the tolerance for new illegal construction will come back . 
  spain has learned nothing . 
  during the bubble there was a lot of tolerance to illegal housing construction , specially at andalusia , where there are more than 100,000 illegal homes . 
  many of them full urbanizations , invading protected beaches , forests , farmland , also isolated houses ... thousands of these homes were bought by british expats ( other expats collectives like the germans have had only some isolated cases ) , the majority bought by spaniards of course . 
  let 's go now to 2012 : the psoe that tolerated all that illegal construction loses the absolute majority in the regional elections but can rule in a coalition with the iu ( united left ) . 
  and this left have been saying that one of the reasons that we are in this situation is the tolerance with the illegal construction . 
  and the new coalition government started a policy of zero tolerance with illegal housing , and started judicial procedures for demolishing many of the houses . 
  there were also procedures that allowed legalization in many cases ( not natural park , not protected beach or similar ) paying very big fines , some homes even got demolished actually . 
  brits have been trying to get amnesty refusing any deal that meant recognizing any illegal action in their side ( we were good will customers and so on ) . 
  and probably almost everybody is going to end having an amnesty . 
  there was one already for big developments already . 
  the british government , or embassy at least , fought really hard for the legalization of this illegal houses : went to the eu parliament , threatened with trying to get an international investigation about what has been going on spanish real estate ... and many spaniards were also affected , people do n't care so much about rule of the law and we are getting close to elections . 
  let 's give an amnesty to everybody . 
  you can watch it [ here ] ( http://www.antena3.com/programas/el-hormiguero/invitados/pedro-sanchez-hormiguero_2014091100296.html ) , i did n't watch completely .

  and he also talked in salvame . 
  i only going to say that . 
  i seriously do n't expect anything good from him .

   ** arturo ** mas what ?? 
  he is called artur mas . 
  arturo is the spanish form of his name . 
  spain : mariano rajoy was the conservative candidate in 2004 and 2008 also when the pp lost . 
  he became pm in december of 2011 . 
  and the illegal financing of the party under his leadership is known ( g\u00fcrtel and other networks ) since 2009 . 
  and he will be candidate for the next elections also . 
  as he said : life is resisting . 
  edit : felipe gonzalez also lost the elections at 1977 and 1979 before becoming pm for the psoe at 1982 , and jose maria aznar ( pp ) lost the 1990 and 1993 elections before winning at 1996 . 
  if you control the party bureaucracy overthrowing a party leader is almost impossible in spain . 
  we need to get rid of madrid is draining castille . 
  it 's going to be at spanish in all the cinemas in my country anyway . 
   independent scotland will be in the eu . 
  only if 28 states say yes . 
   if scotland is not the successor state of uk . 
  it 's a new state applying for membership .
