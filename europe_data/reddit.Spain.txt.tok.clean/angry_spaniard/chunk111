  you need to choose between european and left . 
  why is the eu getting involved ? 
  [ greece has been in deflation 30 months ] ( http://www.inflation.eu/inflation-rates/greece/historic-inflation/cpi-inflation-greece.aspx ) . 
  and the greek deflation is expected to last 3 years more at least . 
  and we are adding another austerity pack full of deflationary measures . 
  thw inflation rate is negative . 
  i do n't see the interest going to that . 
  i doubt that 0 % interest would be enough , greece is not going to have positive inflation in more than a decade and the debt is going to be over 200 % of the gdp in two years . 
   what 's wrong with that ? 
  that we have 25 % of unemployment . 
  and the mothers that are n't working is not usually because they do n't want . 
  and in fact they usually need more support than the others . 
  if somebody wonders many benefits at spain require having a job and that in a country with 25 % of unemployment . 
  and some require a well paid job for being relevant . 
  [ as exemple the maternity subsides at spain ] ( http://www.consumer.es/web/es/economia_domestica/familia/2012/03/01/207458.php ) : a maximum of 1200 euros year for each child under 3 years old . 
  only working women can apply for it you can never get more money than the one that they pay as income tax . 
   i would say my faith is better than 7 or 8 days ago in the light of the referendum . 
  i also think thtat the very character of the negotiations is that there can not be winners but * there are * winners and losers and very obvious . 
  greece lost completely and is going to stay in depression , lose all their state assets in fire sales , destroy all their remaining public services and be burdened by an always growing debt ; and germany is going to get all their proposals and veto over legislation in greece . 
  i think that what are we going to see now is that the left wing parties at spain are going to become euro-sceptic . 
  [ the candidate of iu to the pm position is already insinuating that ] ( https://twitter.com/agarzon/status/620689816347394048 ) , united left . 
  probably australia ; he has australian citizenship , a daughter living there and he also lived there many years . 
  honestly david cameron and the british conservatives has shown many times that he is not as ideological and irrational as other governments . 
  if a debt ca n't be paid it ca n't be paid . 
  and let 's try to get a deal that the greek government can own with diginity . 
  i honestly i have better opinion of the british conservatives than yours . 
  we can see it with the scottish referendum . 
  david cameron is also a self-serving cunt and his positions about the european court of human rights scares me . 
  but , i expect him to be more realistic . 
   `` the lesson for the future is that members of the eurogroup should never create this kind of uncertainty , because than you yourself create the bank run . 
  you can create a bank run in any country in the eurozone like this , if you would say a similar thing tomorrow about for example spanish banks . '', 
  and that 's one of the many reasons why we should scrap the eurozone . 
   i hope it will change in the future . 
  let 's say that i disagree . 
  i do n't like the eu or the people that we are sending ( or trying to send ) to the eu . 
  i wonder if it is a coincidence that [ the election of president of the eurogroup ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3d52vp/dijsselbloem_reelected_head_of_eurogroup/ ) , lost by de guindos , was the same day as this . 
  not that i complain , the sanction is completely deserved . 
  and i dislike de guindos and i do n't know enough the dutch guy . 
   now for a fiscal and political union . 
  now for an ordered break up of the eurozone . 
  for the next one sarkozy may be there again . 
  what about the political company . 
  the troika veto over all laws in greece , transferring assets to a fund in luxembourg , removing collective agreements . 
  also a conventional devaluation is quicker than the current approach , does n't have to deal with the stickiness of prices to downward changes . 
  by the way , do i actually need to remember to you that tsipras went to brussels with a plan that includes all the measures that you list . 
  the problem is that finland , germany have moved the goal ( with the less loud support of other governments ) . 
   if greece leaves the eurozone , the greek people will be a lot worse off than they are now and if they stay also . 
  i am not talking about the terms of the loan that is the less important of the conditions . 
  i am talking about the political concessions . 
  please stay !, 
  we need you to block further integration !, 
  italy , spain and portugal are in way worse shape . 
  and let 's not talk about greece for once . 
  probably leaving the eu would be better than staying under proposed terms . 
  and i was n't euro-skeptic . 
  and i am not emotional about it but the euro was a bad idea , we should be trying to scrap it in a controlled way . 
  spain is not ready at all , it would make more expensive rolling over our debt and scare investors . 
  maybe . 
  why ? 
  is it because i could have seen his comment saying that he is spanish refreshing the page before answering ? 
  he is catalan-speaking from spain . 
  the name jaume is the catalan version of the english james and the spanish jaime . 
  honestly spain got 41.3 billions to use in bank bailouts with a way better deal . 
  and nobody did a fuss . 
  maybe it did n't go to the budget and it went straight to buy for 1 euro bankrupted banks and cover their loses ( even if the government is the one that is paying it ) . 
  spain does n't even start to pay until 2022 . 
  [ you can check details here ] ( http://www.esm.europa.eu/assistance/spain/ ) . 
  and the reforms required did n't affect the budget only required to establish normal regulations and supervision to the financial sector . 
  and that was needed by the way . 
  we must be the only country that was required to increase regulation . 
  what a big percentage of [ portuguese ] ( http://www.statistiques.public.lu/stat/tableviewer/tableview.aspx?reportid=384&amp;if_language=fra&amp;maintheme=2&amp;fldrname=1 ) . 
  i do n't see any reason to hope . 
  why ? 
  he would take only cash . 
  [ after that they went to the supreme court ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/cataluna/2015/05/08/554c81f9268e3e73768b4587.html ) , that has said the same this may . 
  i though that the catalan government went to the constitutional court after the regional court sentenced that , but i ca n't find it . 
  not that it matters . 
  the government ca n't enforce the law even the constitutional court says that it should . 
       if the law is undesirable and , after examination we can conclude that it is clear , then the best course of action is to change the law rather than to breach the law . 
  weird people , that 's not how we do things . 
  if we did we should jail half of our regional governments for ignoring the conservative party main education law ( the 7th since democracy ) . 
  edit : however , they are doing it some pretense of legality sending appeals to constituional court , and approving laws that they do n't have competence to approve but they need to be derogated by the constitutional court . 
  recently the constitutional court declared that catalonia should teach 25 % of the subjects in mandatory education in spanish as the education law says . 
  i bet it wo n't happen for the next school year . 
  his english is fine , everybody has an accent , he is easier to understand than many english people from the north . 
  donald tusk on the other hand ... but he also is understandable . 
  the crazy polish mep , janusz korwin-mikke , was impossible some times on the other hand . 
  i found his name writing ` crazy polish mep ' on google , that says enough about him . 
  :d * translation : rich port ? 
  more like bankrupted port ? 
  i am sorry . 
  but i ca n't avoid posting this . 
  without foreign money ? 
  he is not talking about sending money , simply stopping debt service without calling it default . 
  and it is the most logical solution , but it wo n't be done . 
  he is 92 years old and he is retiring this month . 
  [ the picture ] ( https://twitter.com/ahorapodemos/status/618734186283859969 ), 
  i do n't have enough information for answering that , and i do n't think that many out of the syriza leadership know that . 
  but , for good or bad i think that both options are better than status quo . 
  however this is not the best way of leaving the eurozone at all .
