  are you entitled to benefits simply for looking for a job ? 
   so why would podemos and their affiliates be out in front of this when all the media will show is how much worse life is in greece after syriza and then show all the solidarity between them . 
  because ideology . 
  no , because i do n't see a way out of the spiral of deflation , recession , cuts and growing debt-to-gdp inside the eu and without default . 
  the troika has n't offered a realistic path to recovery and it does n't seem interested at all . 
  maybe if the eu governments were different , but they are n't . 
  the only realistic way out of this is bankruptcy and leaving the eu . 
  i think that to leave only the eurozone would be the best for greece , but that is wishful thinking . 
  it will probably have to leave the eu . 
  the eu is going to make things as hard as possible to greece . 
  that 's absurd . 
  the savings accounts are also en euros . 
  you could also say the same for them and it would be equally foolish . 
  the government has the same authority over the currency for the deposits as for the mortgages . 
  it would n't affect the debts of the greek banks with abroad and they would burst . 
  but that is another question . 
  do you think that the ** current ** greek budget is overspending ? 
  i remember that user from estonia saying that if salaries were falling to levels similar to estonia ( for new hires , because salaries are also sticky for current employees ) greeks should be fine because they can live with that and the prices would adjust . 
  but the prices are too sticky to fall a 40 % and the debts do n't reduce by themselves , even if the price of a house has fallen 40 % in 5 years your mortgage has n't . 
  what i have learned of this is that currency devaluation is less traumatic than internal devaluation . 
  [ pools ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=pool&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=n0isvaqcjctmygohhikadg&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=2144&amp;bih=1104&amp;dpr=0.9 ), 
  sticky prices , this can be solved with devaluation out of the eu . 
  the treaties say that the legal tender/currency of a country that joins the euro shall be the euro . 
  but , it is not clear what would happen if greece breaks it . 
   i really hate when people say ` there is no way to leave the eurozone ' . 
  i did n't say that . 
  i said that there is n't a way of doing it and staying in the eu with the current rules . 
  the rules can be changed , of course . 
  but that will require the approval of all the countries in the eu . 
  if only one government wanted greece completely out they could simply refuse the change and force the situation . 
  if all the eu members agree they can approve something , of course . 
  but maybe they do n't . 
  and anything that implies modifying a eu treaty needs a referendum in ireland at least , so it would take time . 
  and the spanish government wants to make the things as hard as possible for internal reasons ( podemos ) , at least until the elections of the end of the year . 
  so it would n't be allowed tomorrow . 
   also , i want angela merkel and company tried for high treason . 
  charge : giving away 100s of billions of taxpayer money to a country that was obviously not going to give it back . 
  if it makes you feel better 91 % was used to pay/buy private debt not went to the country itself . 
  and your government would have end using a similar amount of money in covering the loses of your banks . 
   i do think the greeks should leave the eurozone under the current circumstances because even though they will be in worse shape economically , it will at least force the politicians to admit that the problems are structural and deal with them , otherwise its just debt driven life support with no reform and that clearly has not worked . 
  i suppose that you mean the european union . 
  there is no legal way to leave the eurozone and stay in the eu and greece does n't have the years that would take to approve it . 
  but it is true : they are contradictory . 
  the union ca n't last with them . 
  this only makes sense if greece leaves the union during the capital controls time . 
  maybe it is better , after these years seems to be worth a try . 
  they would n't be able to act according to their political platform and stay in the eu . 
  if they were able to get a majority at spain , and that seems unlikely . 
  i disagree with that , i do n't think that the troika proposals were feasible . 
  greece has been following them 5 years with known results . 
  medicine is an even worse euphemism than austerity . 
  you can find some very vocal at / r/podemos , however the party officials wants some undefined other europe . 
  why do you think that greece will be able to stay in the eu ? 
  maybe , i have seen employers withholding salaries without consequences at spain also . 
  exactly . 
  it 's for making them feel like at home !, 
  a prison would be an upgrade in living standards . 
  and more expensive . 
  [ more like suicide by drinking and acting stupid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wxhrxj5ylm ) . 
  and if you have one you count as employed for its month . 
  where is * here * ? 
  is it devon ? 
  if it is a typo and it was a there meaning spain . 
  well the people does n't want per day contracts . 
  but with current unemployment there is always somebody taking them . 
  nop , it is early elections . 
  the headline is misleading or a lie .

  yep , but there is people that seems to believe that if you call for early elections enough times you would get independence .

  one of the biggest trends , at least at spain , is the massive growth amount of people that only works per project contracts of short duration . 
  it is a trend that started before 2008 , so it is not only due to the * crisis * or to recent labour market reforms . 
  but it seems to be getting worse . 
  edit : [ graph ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/06/05/media/1433527878_480010.html ) with more stats . 
  the average duration of a contract was 56.3 days at 2014 , it was 75.6 at 2009 . 
   were n't the treasury bills supposed to be rolled over ? 
  and they need to be roll over again and again . 
  the term of the tbills is three months . 
  [ check the table ] ( http://graphics.wsj.com/greece-debt-timeline/ ) , with the amount of money that greece would get they would n't be able to pay the imf payments of september . 
  and that 's assuming a balanced budget . 
  and there is also that imf account deposit to pay back ( that greece used in may ) , probably some greek local administrations that transferred most of their cash to the greek national government want it back , government providers owed quite some money ... edit : i am ignoring the tbill , and pretending that the greek can roll them somehow . 
  then this debate is pointless , because even if syriza obeys greece would default before the end of the year because they would n't be able to service all the pending debt payments . 
  if there is n't haircut in a way or in other greece will default now or in three months . 
  why ? 
  the liquidity problem is so bad that it would n't make a difference without this measure they would n't be able to pay anyway . 
  and for the private sector a way of delaying tax payments when they do n't have access to credit can be positive . 
  you can do that at spain paying a 4 % interest right now . 
  probably is bad timing , but the system introduced is not so bad . 
  then allegedly made it already . 
  and now somebody has to react to that ( maybe themselves regreting ) . 
  i think that tax collection rates have n't improved . 
  the tax collection has growth because the people that was paying before is paying more . 
  the audit of the debt by a committee of the greek parliament was a fun political posturing , but it does n't have legal consequences . 
  this requires a polandball . 
  with their disability pensions money . 
  flawless plan !, 
   i heard that there was a dislike regarding paying the vat before , did that change ? 
  nobody likes to pay vat anywhere . 
  if it is collected more is due to a strong tax services .
