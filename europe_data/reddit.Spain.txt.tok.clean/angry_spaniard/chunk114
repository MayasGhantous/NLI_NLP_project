  or maybe i am cynical but people tries really hard to avoid taxes at spain . 
  spain has some things that greece does n't have like a more staffed tax service , a cadastre , integration with all the public administration databases , also with banks ... [ some estimates of shadow economy in europe ] ( https://www.atkearney.com/documents/10192/1743816/fg-the-shadow-economy-in-europe-1.png/2db244cd-9989-447c-8499-ea9043c4d0f3?t=1374166115940 ) . 
  as you can see greece is not a big outlier for its development and tax levels , and tax fraud is present to a certain point in all countries . 
  that 's the britain that we love to hate !, 
  are n't things like this common in europe ? 
  i mean people looking in the garbage for something to sell , eat or use . 
  i admit that it gets a weird touch with the pro-eu message . 
   not a single flight ? 
  yeah that 's definitely a scam . 
  we are going to have flights now . 
  after years of every airline ignoring the airport we are going to pay ryanair for flying there as i said before . 
  if the new regional government does n't stop it somehow . 
  we have another and better placed airport close anyway . 
  if an airport has ( or has had ) flights does n't mean that it is n't a scam . 
  the pyrenees airport had some commercial flights the first two years or so for pretending ( paid with tax money ) . 
  and the same the one in ciudad real ( the one that was in top gear ) . 
   with some luck they 'll probably nail him down at some point . 
  like after his political patrons most likely covering his ass get housted next elections ? 
  [ he is since december in prison for tax fraud that committed before the ghost airport ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/02/spain-carlos-fabra-begins-jail-term-ghost-airport ) . 
  it was amazing , he is the most powerful person to go to prison in my life . 
  and he is/was a powerful patron by himself he was the 5th president of castellon provincial council of the fabra family ( 4 direct ancestors ) . 
  his family has controlled politics in the province of castellon , since the borbonic restoration after the first republic except during the second republic years . 
  [ his daughter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andrea_fabra_fern%c3%a1ndez ) is in politics , she is a member of the parliament . 
  but , the party conservative party did n't let her become the successor of his father in his offices . 
  so they seem to be losing grasp of the power after all this time . 
  [ from before the judge that put him finally in prison ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/03/10/inenglish/1362921351_078749.html )  the case had already gone through ** eight judges ** as fabra and his stable of lawyers kept delaying the investigative work in a stifling climate dominated by the local power of the defendant 's clan there was a joke that when fabra had problems in a trial he did n't change his lawyer he changed the prosecutor and the judge . 
  \u00b4 [ the airports are often corruption scams from the begining ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/20131025/the-politician-who-reinvented-the-rules ), 
  you are offering more than your government is offering for less than what the greek government is currently offering . 
  the current proposal does n't give enough funding to greece to get to september . 
  and besides what you are asking : * cutting pension spending for the last 6 months of the year a 1 % of the gdp ( but they removed the request for lower pensions written as that in the last leak , but you ca n't reduce the pension spending a 12.5 % in 6 months with removing early retirements ) . 
  * express privatization of some government assets . 
  * higher vat for electricity at least and some other things . 
  the joke that the greeks that got rich during the crazy years are in london or the caribe has some truth in it . 
  so the others can pay . 
  yes , but that would also prevent a future government to reopen and pour more money on them . 
  and we should n't take political declarations literally . 
  [ the previous valencian government signed agreements to finally open the ghost airport of castell\u00f3n ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/10/ryanair-first-airline-spains-ghost-airport-castellon ) . 
  they lost the elections , but i we are going to have to pay it anyway . 
  and cleaning employees , control tower staff , security detail , canadian management company ... 
  if the airport would have been demolished , they could n't think about things like this . 
  and for sure we ca n't afford such thing . 
  valencia is the most indebted region of spain . 
  abandoned airports deteriorate also . 
   let 's not exagerate . 
  just because the use is n't instant or does n't jump to eyes does n't mean it is n't usefull . 
  airports ** ai n't going anywhere ** and are an investment . 
  spain may demolish some of the abandoned international airports that has built in the recent years if the left wins the elections . 
  so some may go somewhere . 
  edit : also the airports abandoned during years cost money to reopen . 
  we had an experience at castellon recently . 
  usually they wait to be in the government . 
  their internal problem is that he and some others do n't want to go to the national elections with the manifesto that they published before the eu elections . 
  because it is very radical and they are aware that half of it is simply impossible . 
  in fact there is a faction of podemos trying to force an internal referendum to include the promise of universal basic income for the end of year elections . 
  [ they have something on reddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/podemos/comments/3491qb/comunicado_del_c%c3%adrculo_renta_b%c3%a1sica_sobre_las/ ) . 
  this is the most visible , but there are others . 
  i do n't like him and the fact that he went to the european parliament with only a manifesto for national politics that promised everything , was n't very nice . 
  but i think that not doing the same for the next elections is good , he said that he wants to go to the next general elections with electoral promises that can be done . 
   hopefully one , one day , non ? 
  why ? 
  this is as old as the [ world ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ab4ap/cover_of_the_economist_for_this_week_at_europe/csb6x89 ) . 
  stop the circlejerk . 
  [ this is also done at spain with gypsies frequently ] ( http://www.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-20-10-2008/abc/nacional/un-propietario-vizcaino-acusado-de-meter-una-familia-gitana-en-su-inmueble-para-echar-al-vecino_91709746511.html ) .

  this has been only the beginning . 
  and we do n't have a federation , and there is n't a majority supporting one . 
  2011 was the last year that the spanish population grew . 
  \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2606 ca n't wait for the sequel !, 
  i lost it when i saw the name below that . 
   ... assuming linear paying back . 
  in reality with a ( hopefully ) growing economy that 's cute . 
  but not going to happen in the next few years in any case . 
  but it is n't helping to make the debt sustainable with the growth of the debt/gdp rate . 
  greece is not able to service its debt without a third bailout ( besides completing the second ) , and it is not due to syriza ( but nd would have probably agreed to the terms for completing the 2nd bailout and getting the 3rd ) . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3a5sbq/the_opinion_of_spaniards_about_international/cs9zs4z ) is my opinion . 
  i would value him higher than any other eu leader in the poll . 
  disclaimer : i am social-democratic leaning . 
  from the gay marriage , to going through the scottish referendum and probably the eu referendum to doing a vote in the british parliament about the intervention in syria and respecting the outcome . 
  he also is able to communicate his agenda and seems to have a clear idea of what 's his country how it works and what it stands for . 
  he is also a self-serving prick ( career defining elections comment ) , not interested in improving the situation of the poor , and i am very disgusted about his opinions about the european convention on human rights . 
  and he did that reform of the university payments ... 
  in general he is a way better conservative primer minister than rajoy and actually of the list of european leaders in the poll is the one that i would value higher ( mostly because i have a terrible opinion of all the others ) . 
   pp as corrupt at the moment . 
  the current informations about the possible illegal funding of the popular party [ point that the party financed itself illegally between 1989 and 2009 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g%c3%bcrtel_case ) . 
   citing sources within the partido popular , the newspaper appeared to clear the party 's current leadership , saying that the reported payments were made between 1989 and 2009 . 
  [ at 1990 was already discovered information ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/caso_naseiro ) that pointed to illegal finacing of the party . 
  i need to quote and translate this from the wiki :  the wiretaps were only ordered to investigate the case of ** drug trafficking ** and , therefore , its use in the crime of illegal financing did n't enjoy judicial oversight . 
  the court ordered the subsequent destruction of the tapes of the incriminating conversations of those involved . 
  however , recordings can be found in libraries given their historical value , but legally do n't have probative value . 
  the current conservative president of galicia has a long personal and business relationship with one of the most important drug lords of spain marcial dorado ( currently in prison ) , [ he vacationed with him ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/galician-premier-under-fire-as-links-to-jailed-drug-smuggler-revealed-1.1345639 ) and was very close with him when he was the number two of the health care regional ministry of galicia during 1995-1996 . 
  and the leader of the bigger union in health care met also with them during those vacation . 
  [ an article with a picture ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.publico.es%2factualidad%2flider-ccoo-galicia-yate-feijoo.html&amp;edit-text= ) of them together . 
  some pictures and some suspicious circumstantial stuff were published shortly after dorado went to prison for 14 years at 2013 pointing to the involvement of many ruling conservatives pp members and the leader of the galician health care worker sub-federation of the ex-communist union ccoo in his operations . 
  honestly , the psoe has been terrible and corrupt , but some of things that have been discovered from people currently holding public offices from the pp are simply at a level that i ca n't believe . 
  or that the conservative voter is so stubborn of voting exactly this party always . 
  ciudadanos is not managing to get so many votes from pp as podemos from psoe . 
  seriously the pp has been always terrible , the [ founding leader ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manuel_fraga_iribarne ) was a fucking francoist dictatorship minister of * information * and tourism . 
  there is right wing people , there will be always be right wing people . 
  so spain needs a right wing party that is not this , so let 's hope that ciudadanos has more success than the one that is having . 
  and i think that is more realistic replacing pp that cleaning it .
