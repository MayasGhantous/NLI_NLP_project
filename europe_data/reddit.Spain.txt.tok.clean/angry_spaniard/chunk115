  the current pope has been working very hard in his reputation and quite successfully . 
  about your real question of religiosity . 
  i did [ this submission ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/23xxz0/percentatge_of_students_in_spain_attending_to_the/ ) with a map of the percentatge of students in spain attending to the catholic religion subject in public elementary schools at spain by region . 
  also this point : being catholic in spain is not like in other countries. , from a poll at 2011 . 
   even among these `` catholics '' 25 % claiming not believing in god ( and 20 % doubt its existence ) ,   incluso hay entre estos `` cat\u00f3licos '' un 25 % que afirma no creer en dios ( y otro 20 % duda de su existencia ) , [ source ] ( http://www.publico.es/espana/186215/la-fe-espanola-hace-aguas ) the catholic church is also the first private employer and owns : tvs , radios , schools , hospitals , universtities ... 
  so it has a certain importance . 
  bonus , today a church in madrid does a homage to a [ gay activist key the approval of gay marriage at 2005 ] ( http://infocatolica.com/?t=noticia&amp;cod=24221 ) , [ pedro zerolo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pedro_zerolo ) , he died from cancer recently . 
  remember : * pp : conservative . 
  * psoe : social-democratic/progressive . 
  edit : yes i would translate this to center-right * podemos : complicated left .

  i do n't like to use words like right or wrong . 
  but with the plan greece would default anyway without a 3rd bailout before the end of the year . 
   then it had the temerity to assume the improbable , that it wo n't have to repay . 
  i understand what you mean with * have to * , but greece is not solvent enough for servicing its debt without a 3rd bailout . 
  beside the 7.2 billions under discussion . 
  and that was from before syriza . 
  so that they would n't pay as agreed was inevitable , but whatever let 's the circlejerk go on . 
  but ... but !, 
  your flair !, 
  why would somebody come to reddit and put a lying flair !? 
  :( it says/said :  opressed heterosexual conservative russian minority . 
  the oppressed russian minority is growing !, 
  there has been contradictory efforts . 
  some people is too big to fall : * i mean the ruling party financed itself illegally and the only one involved that has been charged is the treasurer because all the public contractors gave money to the party without the knowledge of the public officers that gave them contracts according to our justice . 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c3%a1rcenas_affair ) * and also the royals . 
  [ seeing the prosecutor of a case trying so hard to let free somebody that is everywhere in a corruption case walking free because is the sister of a king and the daughter of a king ] ( http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news-spain/opinion/editorial_the_hypocrite_horrach.shtml ) . 
  still there are hundreds of elected officers being prosecuted . 
  and [ unions ] ( http://spanishnewstoday.com/trades-unions-offices-raided-in-andalucia-ere-case_18832-a.html#.vx_uo5rswnw ), 
  [ another corrupt spanish politician has started his prison term ] ( http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news-spain/valencia2/rafael_blasco_was_imprisoned_in_valencia_yesterday_for_looting_money_destined_for_the_third_world.shtml ), 
   what they 're asking for is a removal of incentives for early retirement in order to increase the pension entry age to one the system can sustain . 
  i am almost sure that this was the syriza counter-proposal . 
  and it was rejected because this wo n't reduce the expenses in pensions a 1 % of the gdp in 1 year . 
  i mean this wo n't undo retirements done before the measure . 
  i know that it is illegal at spain . 
   if a state , even a tiny state like greece leaves it throws the entire institution into doubt . 
  what 's the doubt ? 
  the eu is a reversable agreement of severeign states that do n't have bonds strong enough for caring about the eu itself . 
  but we knew that from the begining . 
  i do n't understand why we put ourselves in this situation . 
  spain is having way more emigrants than immigrants and i expect that trend to continue the next few years . 
  so i do n't expect it to become a big issue . 
  however spain has already 5 millions of immigrants living at the country , plus their children . 
  and their unemployment rate is around 30 % ( the locals are above 20 % so is not so weird ) . 
  and the biggest xenophobic party is getting 20,000 votes like 0.1 % of the vote, 
  it seems like stricter tax collection would be a requirement of any bailout to attempt to ensure that the funds will be coming in . 
  it has n't until now . 
  why would it be now ? 
  yes i know , what has been done until now has n't worked very well ( or syriza would n't have been elected ) . 
  raising the vat so the ones that pay now pay more is over the table again , but measures to reduce tax evasion has never been in a signed agreement . 
  it is not like the greek government has the capacity of enforcing the taxes . 
  seriously they do n't have a working tax service . 
   and then have a frank conversation where i 'd tell them they have to increase their pension age from the current 55/60 years for public servants and employees respectively to a uniform 65 years , greece already raised the retirement age to 67 . 
  you can check the [ retirement ages for eu countries ] ( http://www.etk.fi/en/service/retirement_ages/1601/retirement_ages ) . 
  but , you ca n't legally send the guys that already retired back to the labour market and anyway even if you send then back they are not going to work . 
  and no country has uniform retirement age . 
  spain has early retirement programs for miners ( and even earlier for coal miners ) , police and fire-fighters and school teachers . 
  people that has been seeking employment more than 5 years unsuccessfully can go to early retirement when they are 61 ( being raised to 62 ) . 
  spain was not asked to remove these cases in the implemented pension reforms . 
  and germany probably has similar cases . 
  during the crazy years greece had early retirements at 55 for many other collectives like journalist , that 's true but it disappeared already . 
  what greece is being asked now is for lower pensions for the currently retired people . 
   liberalize the labor market , reign in unions that has been already done , going further away than anybody collective bargaining has been destroyed also . 
  however , [ syriza has promised restoring it ] ( http://www.uniglobalunion.org/news/greece-uni-europa-well-bring-back-collective-bargaining-bigger-and-better ) . 
   install a tax authority . 
  yes , this is critical . 
  of course , this has not been mentioned in the negotiations . 
  and in the last 5 years the greek tax service has become weaker not stronger . 
  according to syriza the number of tax inspectors has fallen to only 100 for all greece . 
  starting a real tax service that can do more than automatic tax collection ( vat from big supermarket and picking the transfers of the income tax of declared employees ) would take ages ( the initial training of a tax inspector at spain is a full year plus the recruitment process that includes already training ) and a lot of money . 
  and many of the reforms that are almost pre-requirements for getting effective tax collection , like the unified land registering have not been even started in all these years of bailouts and reforms . 
   and then tell greeks in no uncertain terms that they wo n't be part of the transfer system until they did the reforms . 
  on the flip side they would get a right to the transfers once they implemented reforms . 
  your terms are n't so bad , even if you do n't know the full situation . 
  the problem is that greece is being offered only the money needed to service the most immediate debt payments for all the cuts mentioned and it would need a full featured 3rd bailout or restructuring before the end of the year for repaying the 1st bailout . 
   the most they can expect is 1.54 billion euros , so we can continue with that bullshit for a couple more years . 
  i think that a default is better than continuing with this show , even for greece . 
   our economy , for example , has just started to pick up again after 2008 and it would be a huge hit if greece were to not repay its debts , since we now hold one of the highest per cents of gdp as loans to greece in the eu , which means that our government will protect its interests and vote against countries we generally agree with on most matters . 
  well , if there is no agreement greece wo n't pay anything in the foreseeable future . 
  and if greece repays anything in the close future in that case would be imf , that is senior debt , and remaining private creditors that are owed less and would help to recover access to the credit markets . 
  it is right wing in a different way than pp , it is not confessional catholic for starters . 
  economic-wise their proposals are more conventional right wing than the pp in some way : their proposals include a less progressive tax system with two levels of vat ( raising the minimum vat from 4 % to 8 % ) and a reform of income tax that benefits the middle class . 
  i call that reform regressive because that collective is not exactly the most vulnerable or the one that has it worse . 
  they also defend to break some of the traditional restricted markets that work on government exclusive concessions like pharmacies , notaries and taxis . 
  the people that control these sectors typically back the conservative party . 
  people tends to dramatize a lot . 
   do you throw that large group of people in prison ? 
  yes . 
   their kids in an orphanage ? 
  and adoption later .
