  most spanish emigrants come back in less than a year even if there is not a job waiting for them . 
  and most people has strong family networks that can support them . 
  my parents would provide for me without blinking an eye if i needed it . 
  also the people that has the skills to get a job abroad is the people that usually has the jobs at spain . 
  this country is full of people with university education that prefer to work as butcher or picking garbage at spain that work as what they studied abroad . 
  while the people without qualifications stay jobless . 
  in addition , the strong culture of home-ownership and huge drop in housing prices putting many people underwater in their mortgages means that the mobility is for young people . 
  it is complicated . 
  and i am aware that my environment or myself are not representative and i have n't done a careful study . 
  agriculture is big , but employs nobody . 
  and industry is not so big , it has some oil refinery .

  [ and income per capita is the third lowest , or 4th if we count melilla ] ( http://www.datosmacro.com/pib/espana-comunidades-autonomas ) . 
  why castilla la mancha ? 
  it is poor . 
  spain is heading to repeat the andalusian elections . 
  ruling psoe ( progressive or whatever , you know modern social-democracy ) are too corrupt for everybody except their voters . 
  and podemos ( left wing ) and the pp ( conservatives ) reject even negotiate with each others . 
  i think that both hope that the dozens of arrest since the last elections , [ including some more today ] ( http://sevilla.abc.es/andalucia/20150608/sevi-operacion-detenidos-201506081016.html ) , will weaken the psoe in case of new elections . 
  but i doubt it . 
  [ translate ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.economiadigital.es%2fes%2fnotices%2f2015%2f06%2feconomia-real-miles-de-personas-para-14-puestos-de-trabajo-en-un-lavado-de-coches-de-pontevedra-72477.php&amp;edit-text= ) all the jobs are part time jobs ( 30 hours/week ) with undefined duration ( permanent if you prefer to call it like that ) . 
  so the employer would only have to pay 50 % of social security . 
  now he only needs to find the people with a minor disability , under 25 years , over 45 long term jobless for not having to pay social security . 
  edit : the province of pontevedra has around a million of inhabitants , but pontevedra has only 80,000 . 
  the big city is vigo with 250,000 . 
  spain has done less reforms than greece . 
  but if you say so . 
  spain still has collective agreements , universal health care , unemployment benefits that last more than a year . 
  and in the actual reforms side spain still has the old local monopolies for tobacco distribution , the energy sector is still not liberalized ( even if it was privatized 15 years ago ) , a dominant private telecommunications operator ( that paid a salary for marketing services to the wife of the pm until the day that he won the elections ) favored by the government . 
  the judicial system and the tax collection are less effective than 7 years ago after all the budgets cuts that they had , franco taxi law is still in force ... 
  i can tell you the main reforms : * two pension reforms . 
  * the retirement age is being raised from from 65 to 67 . 
  many people still retires before : the long term jobless retire at 61-62 ( after more than 3 or 4 years of being out of work before ) , and school teachers at 60 , police officers 58 years , some coal miners are retiring because reconversion at 45 ... * the pension are going to be raised a 0.25 % a year until the pension system has a budget surplus , actually is expected to need cuts or a bailout or it will default around 2018 . 
  * most coal mines are closed , or will close for 2018 . 
  * labour market reform : promoting part-time and short duration contracts , adding more reasons for justified ( cheap ) layoffs of workers with undefined duration contracts , and making cheaper to fire undefined duration employees without a reason . 
  * subsidies to car manufacturing hidden under a plan for renewing the spanish cars ( plan pive ) . 
  it has gotten investments of 5.4 billions from volkswagen , and 3.2 billions from ford , and some from nissan and maybe others ... * the government is allowing companies to hire employees from vulnerable collectives ( youth , long term jobless or women above 45 ) without paying social security , but promising full pensions ... this is going to create a big problem in the future . 
  there was the austerity : raising vat to 21 % , cutting 90 % of scholarships , raising income tax , less infrastructure investment , axing development aid 80 % , reducing r&d budget a 35 % , public salaries cut around 7 % and frozen 5 years ... am i forgetting something ? 
  is this a model for greece ? 
  greece has done all the austerity measures that spain did , but more intense . 
  spain does n't have many turks , but i think that [ we are the country were they vote less to the akp ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4vny1ev.png ) . 
  there are quite some * white nationalist * redditors . 
  since when juncker is an ally of alexis tsipras ? 
  greece is not going to be able to pay the first bailout without a third bailout . 
  that 's absurd . 
  leaving the eu . 
  europe does n't . 
  the estimates according to bbva research for spain are between [ 16 % and 20 % ] ( https://www.bbvaresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rdomenech_structural-reforms-and-recovery-extended-11may2015-v2.pdf ) , and this private bank is leaded by a [ ruling party member ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francisco_gonz%c3%a1lez_%28banker%29 ) and it is quite pro-government as it is logical . 
  they also give advice to the government to fix this . 
  they propose to do an fiscal devaluation raising more the sales tax ( currently at 21 % ) and reducing the corporate social security payments . 
  the report is too benevolent with the government and attributes calls increasing efficiency by the cora agency to following certain recommendations ( i agree with some of them , but the government is providing less or worse services with this ) : budget cuts in scholarships , increasing the recommended number of students by classroom in high-schools from 30 to 35 ( reducing professors and groups ) , programs to reduce the time than the patients stay in hospitals , and reducing the abuse of cesarian sections , give more priority to more employable jobless in the unemployment services ... 
  the analysis is too benevolent in some things . 
  however , spain is having a serious growth in tourism and automobile industry , at least , even if they are n't my favourite sectors . 
  do you know that the biggest factory of ford outside china is the one at spain from this year ? 
  this is about eu citizens . 
  and eu citizens have the right to move in the eu without visa . 
  and to access to benefits the requirements have to be uniform for all the eu citizens in a country : for example to get full access to health care as spanish resident you need to have a spanish social security number and having paid more than 6 months to the spanish social security . 
  or being the spouse or child ( if you are under 26 ) of somebody that has . 
  in the link case :  mr pena cuevas was refused basic german benefits for august and september 2012 , as they had spent less than three months in germany . 
  it looks like the requirement is having lived more than 3 months in germany . 
  the only country that is having any problem with this system is uk that seems to insist in having non-conditional benefits for its citizens even if we are talking about conditions easy to fulfil for somebody living in the country . 
   some refuse it though why ? 
   some fall between the chairs ( cracks ? ) . 
  what does this mean ? 
  is that they do n't do the paperwork correctly ? 
   oh , and other eu-citizens are are not eligible . 
  you ca n't do that . 
  you have to put the same requirements for all eu citizens . 
  the trick is putting a requirement that prevents benefit migration . 
  spain is requiring having work at the country at least six months or your spouse , or a parent if you are under 26 . 
   f a government decides to consider everybody receiving benefits as being employed by the state , that will make the rate 0 , are all the jobless getting benefits in your country ? 
  does jpii make you want to have babies ? 
  the president of the spanish federation is even more corrupt and has backed blatter to the end . 
  just saying . 
  an american forced regime change !, 
  radical islamist will get the power now . 
  23 % is the figure from unemployment services . 
  [ the comparable figure is 23.7 % ] ( http://www.ine.es/prensa/epa_tabla.htm ) . 
  the only people getting those from the government is a bunch of first level politicians . 
  and those are like $ 90,000 year . 
  however , however for the private sector there is a bunch of people people with pension plans in the order of millions every year . 
  jose ignacio goirigolzarri , former ceo of bbva and current ceo of bankia ( both banks ) , [ had 52 millions in his pension plan from bbva when he retired at the age of 55 years at 2009 ] ( http://knowmore.org/wiki/index.php?title=spain%27s_bbva_under_fire_over_huge_payout_to_ceo ) . 
  he went back to work at 2012 anyway . 
  the spanish female public works minister and the female chairman of the board of the spanish main contractor of the high speed train to meca were all over saudi arabia without an islamic veil and nothing happened . 
   not unlike turkey , although that might be an unfair comparison . 
  why ? 
  i found erdogan and orban quite similar . 
  you are right . 
  and also the mountain ~ ~ jews ~ ~ germans . 
  not likely , it would require reforming the constitution with a super-majority in two legislatures and a referendum . 
  and the two traditional big parties , pp and psoe , are pro-monarchy . 
  i just saw [ this map ] ( https://twitter.com/_kroosified/status/604340541346729985 ) , and then i see your reply . 
  do you know who is the largest employer at the us ? 
  or at spain ? 
  and i have n't check germany , but it would be surprising if it was n't the public sector your government weights a similar % of the gdp than the spanish one and way higher than the smaller us government ( that is also the first ) . 
  and your first private employer probably is something as boring as the catholic church like in spain or a retail chain like in the us ( walmart ) . 
  you have only a * government * ( including all public administrations on it ) but there are millions of corporations at a random country . 
  that 's the spanish name .
