  [ not exactly ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/circuito_de_barcelona-catalu%c3%b1a ) , regional and local and the racc . 
  barcelona does n't have shares , it is not in the city ; but it foots part of the bill . 
  absurd . 
   ada colau , whose anti-austerity coalition won the most seats in sunday 's regional election , i love how the she is supposed to be the one anti-austerity and the pro-austerity crew are the ones that give non-refundable subsidies of millions to formula 1 . 
  i am saying that you will be ok , you are n't white . 
  come on !, 
  this thread asks for edgy comments . 
  am i supposed to take seriously this thread ? 
  \\  implying that gypsies are white . 
  why is university politics from an unknown university getting so much interest ? 
  i do n't like that you , i am not in the government . 
  so i wo n't be involved . 
  but my politicians have stolen from eu funds like the cap ( [ flax case ] ( https://casoscorrupcion.wordpress.com/2014/11/23/caso-del-lino/ ) ) , infrastructure ( so many unneeded projects , and so many politcians with winning lottery tickets ) , training funds ( [ edu case ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/caso_edu ) : 25 % of the money from the eu ) ... 
  so i would n't be surprised if part of the money disappears again . 
  the joke is on them . 
  we do n't give anything of that to the refugees . 
  from march of 2007 : [ the reception of immigrants fails to refugees that sleep under a bridge of the turia river at valencia ] ( http://elpais.com/diario/2007/03/14/cvalenciana/1173903478_850215.html ) . 
   for the third consecutive winter , valencia 's ademuz bridge has become a makeshift shelter that houses every night a hundred immigrants who have made this site their home . 
   police filed for expulsion 18 of the foreigners for not having documents all the others were legal residents of spain so they can legally live under a bridge . 
  :d and that 's before the austerity . 
  aguirre , the gift that keeps delivering . 
  the basque country is going to pass [ a 5 years moratorium on fracking ] ( http://www.vascopress.com/el-gobierno-vasco-apoya-la-moratoria-al-fracking-20052015/ ) . 
   rajoy basically has to go now as you ca n't really survive having senior officials start to question if you should even be there . 
  why ? 
  you know rajoy as well as everybody . 
  the creation of the party of the no-rajoys with all the other members of the pp is more likely at least before elections . 
  the leader of the pp only answers to god and the history between party congresses , so nobody can kick him out now . 
  the next one will be in 2016 , and even then the president of the party is automatically candidate for re-election or somebody proposed by him and there has n't never been an alternative candidate . 
  how an alternative candidature would work is not even clear . 
  you need to recognize that the most stupid or strangest politicians that we hear about are republican . 
  from michele bachmann to santorum , and all those homophobic homosexuals . 
  he did a declaration saying that . 
  without more details and i have n't heard again . 
  how would that work ? 
  is it for advice ? 
  for collecting taxes personally ? 
  the tax code is completely different and there are obvious problems with languages and infrastructure . 
  anyway , establishing an independent working tax service would take millions and years that greece does n't have at this point . 
  and it is not one of the redlines of any of the sides . 
  and valencia is going to have a left wing valencian nationalist mayor with compromis !, 
  the first time that valencia has a nationalist mayor . 
   the only right wing thing they 've got is they firmly oppose separatist movements . 
  what about the economic policies ? 
  that nun is a leader of a political movement that backs her for the local elections . 
  you thought that you put 10 socialist . 
  but you actually put libertarian socialist , trotskist , social-democrat , social-liberal , socialist , progressive without clear ideology , eco-socialist , chavist ( whatever that is ) and some others that i may be forgetting . 
  what happens in denmark once the bank has seized all your assets and you still owe half of the mortgage ? 
  in spain you have to continue paying . 
  and your creditor will confiscate a part of all [ your future income above minimum wage ] ( http://www.laboroteca.com/2014/01/salario-minimo-inembargable-2014.html ) . 
  and if you ca n't pay a minimum your debt will grow at a maximum rate of three times the legal interest rate ( 4 % ) . 
  so there is people that it 's going to be on bankruptcy for a house that they lost when they were 30 years old the rest of their life . 
  this generates also incentives for moving to the underground economy . 
  if part of your legal income is going to be seized always and your are n't never going to be able to get a house , having a pension plan , or get a loan ... what 's the point of being legal ? 
  that happened with the previous government . 
  the current government claims that it is trying to collect taxes from them , but that it 's difficult due to the lack of a effective tax service , because you need to follow the due procedures so it will take time . 
  * what are you doing with a estelada if you are valencian ? 
  still at / r/podemos . 
  they have done well at urban areas , and poorly in rural areas and all andalusia except cadiz . 
  local elections : coalitions backed by them are going to rule madrid , barcelona and other cities . 
  but in regions they are less likely to rule . 
  there 's also c 's ( ciudadanos/ciutadans ) liberal unionist catalan party that has gone national the last year . 
  they have reduced the voting expectations of podemos and become the 4th party . 
  that 's from before that law . 
   now what is going on with greece is that the creditor nations want to force reforms designed to address tax evasion , make it easier to start businesses and so on , but the only way to do so is to basically threaten economic hardship onto the whole nation unless it agrees . 
  sure ? 
  i have n't heard about any of those . 
  i have only heard about raising vat , cutting pensions , eliminating collective agreements and reducing staffs in the public administration . 
  and i am not discussing if those things are good or bad ideas . 
  ada colau has been the most voted candidate of barcelona . 
  i was wrong expecting them to be second . 
  [ live results ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/05/24/inenglish/1432491787_375015.html ), 
  the party of god and the old laws seems to be headed to win the three basque capitals . 
  has it gotten the three before ? 
  edit : it looks like they are n't the most voted in vitoria as usual . 
  way before the last civil war . 
  goya painted [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/francisco_de_goya_y_lucientes_-_duelo_a_garrotazos.jpg ) for a reason . 
  nuns and ruling pp members ( the catholic church supports them , but they are n't members usually ) caught again carrying old people with dementia to vote for the conservatives . 
   i do n't see how that it 's going to work it 's not question to decide at the municipal level . 
  and barcelona en com\u00fa is not going to participate in non-local elections . 
  and the two biggest parties in the coalition are icv and podemos . 
  icv does n't have a firm position , and podemos said that doing a vote is the democratic thing to do but something about acting according to law . 
  i am compelled to put [ this picture here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8cotfyq.jpg ) the leftist candidate of barcelona en com\u00fa , ada colau , with the leftist pro-independence nun teresa forcades behind her . 
  all the founding leaders of podemos worked and/or studied at the ucm ( universidad complutense de madrid ) . 
  and all of them are also from madrid ( except carolina bescansa that is from galicia , but she has been working at the ucm since 1995 ) . 
  the only person outside of that group with weight in the would be [ pablo echenique ] ( http://www.elespanol.com/nuevos-lideres/el-espontaneo-pablo-echenique-podemos-aragon/ ) ( i like this profile ) . 
  his wife is from venezuela , btw . 
  he is general secretary of the party in arag\u00f3n and candidate to regional president . 
  podemos can be the second party only in the regional elections at madrid , valencian community and arag\u00f3n if we trust the polls . 
  from the article :  as\u00ed son los votantes de cada partido seg\u00fan las cifras del ** cis ** if you do n't know , this is the poll that the government does every three month . 
  so this is only as accurate as a poll can be . 
  from the same guy , polls for the 4 biggest cities : * [ madrid ] ( https://twitter.com/kikollan/status/602438697942921218 ) , this is going to be interesting . 
  nobody except pp wants to see esperanza aguirre back . 
  and ahora madrid number one is not a member of podemos ( the number 2 is ) . 
  i would bet for a coalition of ahora madrid ( podemos and others ) , psoe and c 's . 
  * [ barcelona ] ( https://twitter.com/kikollan/status/602438608113573888/photo/1 ) : the unionist right and the pro-independence right refuse to collaborate , as the left and the right unionist the same . 
  the most likely result ciu stays in office with a minority government . 
  * [ valencia ] ( https://twitter.com/kikollan/status/602438784584699904 ) , c 's is the second . 
  the pp has been very corrupt , but my city is very right wing . 
  * [ sevilla ] ( https://twitter.com/kikollan/status/602438840125681664 ) : welcome to the south . 
  it 's a consequence of the population distribution by age groups and education .
