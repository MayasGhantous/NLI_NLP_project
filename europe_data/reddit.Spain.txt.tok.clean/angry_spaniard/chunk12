  i wonder why the spanish government has not said that . 
  it 's not true , it was a personal union . 
  everything were properties of the king . 
  but , there were n't common institutions excepts the [ consulate of the sea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/consulate_of_the_sea ) , the court and some diplomacy . 
  [ the wikipedia already says that ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crown_of_aragon ) leaving the confederacy would have been as hard as not being ruled by a bourbon to revolutionary france . 
  the whitehouse ( not obama himself ) made a press note saying that the situation is an internal matter that should be handled within the spanish constitutional framework ( that forbids self-determination ) . 
  this is exactly the spanish government position also . 
  that means that he opposes to the referendum . 
  bildu by itself is not going to get independence . 
  if the conservative nationalist are happy with the current status ( and they are for now ) you are not becoming independent , simply because they are the biggest group and they do n't want it . 
  and an independent basque country with the pnv ruling would join the nato . 
  the biggest party is the pnv that is pro-nato . 
  however , they are n't pro-independence or against independence or the opposite . 
   except madrid . 
  basque country has a stronger economy than madrid and barcelona . 
  but , they have fiscal autonomy and do n't contribute to cohesion funds . 
  that is nothing seeing spain . 
  and probably somebody from venezuela would say the same if i talked about ferrol , cadiz and valencia . 
  it 's relative , but if that 's hardship we need new words for the real hardships, 
  you 're not invited azeri region located in asia . 
  i think that those should be called russian unionist . 
  as spaniard is very common : a government with members very successful with the lottery gave the it contracts to a company owned/advised by a retired ruling party politician . 
  the energy companies depend completely from the government for keeping their cartel and artificially high profits . 
  the santander group controls a massive amounts of financial assests bigger than the spanish gdp and may be able to bring to their knees the energy companies with their credit situation . 
  the energy cartel is strong thanks to the government . 
  santander and inditex are strong because themselves , and in the santander because they have a massive amount of savings , pension and investment funds to play with and use to control other companies . 
  here goes the most powerful spaniard . 
  i guess that ana patricia bot\u00edn will replace him . 
  however , they also feel that they are something different that basque specially the traditionalist , the ones that vote upn , specially . 
  sarkozy should go to prison not back to politics . 
  can you redo it with retard-looking pictures ? 
  another romanian planning to leave ? 
   you ca n't expect them to take whatever spain or italy is giving out for charity , can you really ? 
  we do n't give them anything . 
  we have had big groups of real refugees with recognized status living under bridges during months . 
  and even [ at the peak of our bubble ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2ftranslate.google.com%2f&amp;edit-text= ) with a budget surplus . 
  if spain gives refugee status you are on your own for getting a job , housing or learning the language . 
  edit : they are allowed to stay in the concentration centers for illegal immigrants for free if there is room there , and go for food and some help like legal residents . 
  and they may ask for stay some times in homeless shelter if there is room like any other immigrant or spaniard in similar situation . 
  probably the constitutional court is also in hands of fidesz . 
  i do n't expect it to happen . 
  greece has 48.6 % and italy 55.1 % . 
  and italy claims to have around 12 % of unemployment . 
  from [ eurostat ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/file:youth_unemployment,_2013q4_%28%25%29.png ), 
  the youth unemployment is twice the overall unemployment . 
  like in france , united kingdom or belgium . 
  the definition of youth is people under 25 in the labour market . 
  the proportion has been similar the last twenty years at spain . 
  people in this age range that is looking for jobs is more difficult to employ and lacks experience . 
  the only countries that do n't keep that proportion are germany and austria were the unemployment is usually only two or three points higher in that age range probably due to the apprentice system . 
  btw : we are n't at 2008 anymore . 
  the spanish labour market , is more flexible than the french or italian but less than the british . 
  however spain has twice as much unemployment that the first two countries . 
  maybe there are other reasons . 
  and anyway this thread is not for spain , at least only . 
  you are the one that said that the law needed to be changed in a direction , despite not knowing what the law currently says .
