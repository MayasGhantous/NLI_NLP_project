  check the [ this graph ] ( http://2q2ad02pehur1wobow1wbxv3.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/radiografia.png ) the [ full article ] ( http://www.elespanol.com/actualidad/asi-son-los-votantes-de-cada-partido-segun-las-cifras-del-cis/ ) in spanish , but i do n't think that it is going to be a problem . 
  edit : using lines is probably the worse representation for this data . 
  but it is the only acceptable representation that i found . 
  however , barcelona en com\u00fa includes icv , a green catalanista ( i translate this made up word to moderate catalan nationalist ) party and euia ( irrelevant catalan branch of iu ) . 
  and it is backed by some other social platforms . 
  ahora madrid is backed by podemos , equo ( spanish greens , the greens are only stong in catalonia with icv ) , and some factions of iu . 
  so you ca n't attribute 100 % of the votes to the local platforms to podemos . 
  #spain * regional and local elections today . 
  mildly interesting facts : * the conservative ( ruling party in the city and the country ) candidate to mayoress of madrid does n't have electoral programme . 
  [ es ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/politica/esperanza-aguirre-presenta-elecciones-electoral_0_389511718.html ) * andalusia , basque country catalonia and galicia are the only regions that do n't celebrate elections now . 
  * you can follow the elections [ here ] ( http://resultados.elpais.com/elecciones/autonomicas-municipales.html ) . 
  sort of . 
  and winning the lottery also . 
  you can be successful effortless . 
  you only have 3 comments and you do n't have submitted links , but you have karma for links . 
  yes , the 2nd one . 
  why do you delete your old comments ? 
   the bank bailouts in the most case were to deal with liquidity , the bailout for greece was based on solvency . 
  the spanish bank bailoult was n't . 
  the government took ownership of many of the banks and is selling them losing money . 
  if you give billions to the banks and you do n't ask them to pay them back they may have solvency . 
  the spanish government adquired a majority share in certain banks ( bankia , banco valencia , caja castilla la mancha ... ) filled the holes with public money and some of them like [ banco valencia were sold for one euro ] ( http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2012/11/27/valencia/1354030631_275898.html ) . 
  from 52 billions put in the nationalized banks [ 36 billions are confirmed losses ] ( http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2013/07/26/actualidad/1374856943_526101.html ) . 
  the government also put 4.8 billions on a [ bad bank ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sareb ) that bought real estate at bubble prices . 
  we still do n't know how much it is going to lose . 
  there are been more bailouts some as low interest loans , some cosigning loans but those do n't affect the eu . 
  greece has been expected to pay back the money the spanish banks are n't , the spanish government is paying remember that . 
  i have to insist . 
  it would be very weird otherwise . 
  but i understood something else from / u/poisonjoey . 
  seat was fully integrated in volkswagen . 
  some seat models are made in czech republic and some volkswagen models are made at former seat factories . 
  why is n't dacia integrated ? 
  china , maybe worse . 
  he said that he does n't live in uk , he is taking a sabatic year or something to focus in politics . 
  however he can go back if things go bad . 
  marginal rate in [ catalonia was 56 % during 2012-2014 ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/economia/20121022/54353326513/catalunya-irpf-alto.html ) . 
  and even now it is 49 % and also at andalusia and asturies . 
  [ spain wide map ] ( http://estaticos.expansion.com/opinion/documentosweb/2014/11/18/tarifa_autonomica.pdf ), 
  then you should go to spain : federal republics with separation between church and state are a lefty thing . 
  no , we do n't have enough in common : shared identity , the democratic mandate , the economic and social situation . 
  that 's the joke !, 
  i will remove shit from the sheet while i sit . 
  from lost to the river inc. translations . 
  america for the native american !, 
  thy gypsy ghettos of seville and valencia ( la coma is actually in paterna , but whstever ) . 
  and with that i think that i have said all the really bad areas of spain . 
  edit : unless you are into disorganized crime , of course . 
  those are rocks !, 
  nobody lives there . 
  and sometimes it gets worse before getting worse again . 
  they need to stay in power to avoid prison , so there is no time to think long term . 
  and maybe the investing by the car manufacturing industry where agreed in exchange of the billionaire investments that the sector is getting from ford , volkswagen , renault and some minor investments from others . 
  direct subsidies to production are forbidden in the eu , but subsidies to renewal of the cars for safety and environmental reasons are legal . 
  the spanish conservatives are doing significantly different policies since podemos and ciudadanos appeared . 
  they did also a reform of the income tax that made it progressive again , after having done them in december of 2011 one in the opposite direction . 
  cancel the plans to eliminate free abortion , and the minister that backed them . 
  and the people actively seeking employment in insertion programs that had right to contributive benefits , but has used all of them already , have right now to a 1 year of a $ 426 benefit if they live in a household with an average income bellow minimum wage . 
  and they are restarting the construction of high speed trains of questionable need that was stopped around 2010 . 
   output gap . 
  how big is that output gap ? 
  i would think that is getting smaller month after month . 
  with people so many years out of the workforce , capital goods going so many years unused ( abandoned infrastructures , factories and others ) , a significant part of the skilled young so many years abroad that it is not going back , the fall on the quality of the education for the people currently studying ... 
   a greek default or recovery . 
  continuing with extend an pretend with anemic growth around 1 % . 
   the greece issue should be resolved one way or another in the next year or two . 
  i would n't bet on that . 
  i am sure that most of the eurozone governments would prefer to continue with extend and pretend with short-term deals that do n't give breathing space to the greek government to make autonomous decisions at least while syriza is in office . 
  even if it means keeping the current environment 4 years . 
  i mean , if they are given breathing space they may try to rule according to their electoral promises . 
  well christianity originated in the middle east , so we may consider it . 
  and it has shaped the culture of most european countries in different degree . 
  and it also has been shaped by the european cultures . 
  and also only a few days after volkswagen approved a [ $ 4.2 billion investment in spain ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/35m516/volkswagen_to_invest_42_billion_in_its_spanish/ ) , and ford completed a [ $ 2.3 billion investment ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/05/us-ford-spain-iduskbn0l925b20150205 ) recently . 
  it 's a big mac for every american . 
  do you hate freedom ? 
   i believe the principle asturias and garibaldi are currently also used as helicopter carrier , but both could also be equiped with fighter jets ( and both have had fighter jets before ) the [ principe de asturias ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_aircraft_carrier_pr%c3%adncipe_de_asturias ) was decommissioned in february of 2013 because austerity , so it does n't carry anything . 
  it is the 5th busiest port in tonnes in europe . 
  and the busiest in the mediterranean . 
  does anybody know why marseille is declining so badly ? 
  well , nobody is going to invest in greece until the situation stabilizes . 
  after six year this bullshit approach has n't stabilized situation . 
  it may flight but for being a bomber it needs bombs , not broomsticks, 
  the [ spanish wikipedia ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/programa_erasmus#la_cuant.c3.ada_de_la_beca_erasmus_en_espa.c3.b1a ) explains quite well how it works at spain . 
  the erasmus grant has three main components . 
  in the first place , every student gets a eu grant of aproximatelly 110 euros/month . 
  at national ( spain ) level , the ministery of education , gives a grant of a maximum of $ 185 , depending of financial situation of the the student and the destination . 
  and the regions can increase the amount , but some regions do n't . 
  a student can get between 200 and 800 euros/month . 
  if you are a studying in some parts of spain you could go to norway getting only 200 euros/month and zero loans . 
  and in others 800 euros/month . 
  btw , there are n't student loans at spain . 
  not every country is so rich . 
  out of touch norwegians !, 
  * the rulers of non-democratic countries are more successful . 
  * fixed !, 
  when successful means staying in office more years . 
  well , if you want something to disagree . 
  i would seize without indemnification and then sell on pieces or full quite some companies : including acs , wnagas , telef\u00f3nica . 
  even if many shareholders are n't involved in their management for acceptance .
