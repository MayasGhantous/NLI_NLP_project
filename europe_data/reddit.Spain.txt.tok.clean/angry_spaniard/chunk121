  and forbid to sit in a corporate board quite some people from cesar alierta ( caso tabacalera ) to florentino p\u00e9rez . 
  and of course all the politicians that are on their boards . 
  it may be unfair and create and legal insecurity . 
  but i am tired of seeing too many things unpunished . 
  try [ this ] ( https://www.dropbox.com/s/b3zk9m1qefycj3s/rafaelpino_2015.pdf?dl=0# ) . 
   could you translate the legend for me ? 
  it is about the levels of education of the population between 25 and 34 years old at 2011 . 
  colors : * red : only primary or basic secondary education completed . 
  * gray : high secondary education completed . 
  at spain this means training in a trade or completing the additional two years of secondary education that qualify for university . 
  * weird blue : tertiary education . 
   and ` paises bajos ' is the netherlands right yes, 
   why do you say that their platform is not clear ? 
  you ca n't say that you can fix the deficit without services cuts simply with : fighting tax evasion , reforming local administration , building less high speed train ( the planned network is almost done anyway ) , and improving efficiency of other expenses . 
  and in less than a legislature . 
  if you say that your model is denmark and honesty ( as everybody says also podemos ) , you need to recognize that you are going to put higher taxes on the middle class and on everybody with a vat at 25 % . 
  and that the reforms of the previous point in a legislature ca n't balance 6 % of gdp of deficit . 
  and that a country with a 100 % of gdp needs to balance its budget as soon as possible . 
  if it is normal electoral bullshit , what should i expect them to do ? 
  and their income tax reform proposal does n't raise effective taxation , and the same with the vat . 
  and they are the only party that has gone to the boe level of detail on that . 
  economy !, 
  something that i can take seriously , please !, 
  i expect more from a team leaded by a professor of the london school of economics . 
  this may work with averge ~ ~ fool ~ ~ voter , but not with me . 
  i may end voting for them in some national elections , but not for the regionals now . 
  even if compromis does n't have a serious economic program is the only opposition that the mafia valencian pp had these years . 
  i love those italics . 
   * single market inside spain . 
  licenses for performing an activity in a part of the country should allow you to have clients in all the country . 
  this is not true in a lot of sectors . 
  * eliminate barriers to competence in many sectors , from taxi where we still have the system that franco created after giving for life licenses to veterans of war of his side . 
  to tobacco where every estanco has a monopoly in distribution in every postal district ( orban has done something similar as this in hungary recently giving the monopolies to his supporters ) . 
  good and independent regulators for telecomunications . 
  we do n't have to hear again that the government is favoring telefonica/movistar . 
  * the other labour market reform . 
  spain has a brutal rate of temporal employment . 
  25 % of the work now ( 33 % at the peak ) is done by temporary workers and day laborers . 
  a single contract labour market . 
  25 % of the contracts last less than a week . 
  this makes impossible personal independence for a big chunck of the society . 
  i am not getting into details . 
  but , there are some proposals around . 
  many would be better than the current one , from the austrian version , to some customs with small severance at the beginning grows quickly the first years and stops then . 
  * incentives for better corporate management , and better stock market controls . 
  * better education , specially professional training . 
  * redoing completely the r&d policies , killing the current endogamy that the flexibility for hiring without the standard public servant red tape has created in the universities . 
  * a functional judicial system would be nice also . 
  a conflict for a possible non justified layoff that in worse case should not mean a trial starting in a year during a year with a cost almost always higher than the amount of money over the table ( if the worker is unionized it makes sense for him always , and if they win the company has to pay all the costs , if they lost also ) . 
  * a personal bankruptcy law that allows a clean start when you can not pay your mortgage , even if it is after seizing all your savings , pension plans , car , assets and part of your income during x years . 
  now at spain mortgages are forever , even if you lost the house ages ago . 
  the internal devaluation was unavoidable to a certain point inside an euro with the german hegemony . 
  and it was stupid , needlessly painfully , the scars of people still underwater in their debts , dropped from education , the sharp fall in birth rate ... and we are doing now anyway the qe . 
  when it was needed during . 
  this process should n't have needed 6 years . 
  us was able to do it in 2 years , and uk maybe in a little bit more but whatever . 
  i am not saying that . 
  c 's has talked about some of the reforms , specially luis garicano , but the party does n't have a clear platform . 
  [ the situation of the portuguese education for the youth is even worse ] ( http://i.imgur.com/d8skzhb.png ) , as most of the portuguese indicators . 
  spain had a stronger university system that reaches enough people ; it is not great , it is not a joke . 
  the most critical for spain is a better professional training for adults and give training for something to the people that does n't go to university . 
  even nowadays , not everybody has to be an university graduate but everybody gets to get skilled in something and get some post-basic secondary education . 
  the source is [ this article about the duality of the spanish education ] ( http://politikon.es/2015/03/24/politikon-grafico-la-dualidad-en-el-sistema-educativo-espanol/ ) . 
  i would recommend to watch [ this presentation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p7bj3okh7k ) of the full professor of economics of the university of pennsylvania jes\u00fas fern\u00e1ndez villaverde . 
  it 's in spanish the subtitles translated to english can sort of work . 
  [ slides ] ( https://www.dropbox.com/s/b3zk9m1qefycj3s/rafaelpino_2015.pdf?dl=0# ) ( spanish ) . 
  it is not realistic to ask you to watch a one hour video so : tldr : the structural problems of the spanish economy are n't solved . 
  the current recovery is due to the internal devaluation ( fall of 20 % in salaries , 40 % of prices of housing and real estate ) , the cleanup of the financial sector , ecb intervention and cheap oil . 
  the economy is as unsustainable without real reforms as it was at 2002 , or even worse due to the terrible demographic situation ( three years in a row of population fall , and the 2nd lowest birth rate in western europe after portugal ) . 
  he also proposes some reforms . 
  but i am stopping here . 
   think the only reason they will be the most voted party there is not information or accessibility for all the young people living outside to vote [ one of my first comments ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1dmmjk/reurope_what_story_defines_your_country_best/c9rv58t?context=3 ) . 
  however is true that most of the media public and private , backs the regional government ( and the pp in general ) and avoids to talk too much avoid its corruption ; but it is still losing support [ check a recent poll ] ( http://www.electograph.com/2015/05/comunidad-valenciana-mayo-2015-sondeo.html ) . 
   or accessibility for all the young people living outside to vote i live abroad , and i asked for the bailouts for voting . 
  i have to send them before the 21th , the last day for arriving to me according to the government is the 12th . 
  still nothing . 
  you should have indicated that it was a region , exactly mine . 
  not the national government . 
   spain became the first casualty of beefed up eu rules on statistics after the european commission thursday ( 7 april ) recommended the country be fined $ 19 million for misreporting of deficit data ** by the region of valencia . 
  ** we are the same region that finished a ghost airport 4 years ago that has n't seen a flight . 
  also the cinema studio the city of the light , abandoned and built with public money . 
  and i could continue . 
  so it should not come as a surprise , that the same guys are doing this . 
  they are losing votes , but they are expected to be the most voted party in the elections of the 24th of this month . 
  and as the link says volskwagen spain already has a turnover of 13.8 billons ( 1.3 % of the spanish gdp ) . 
  [ ford also completed recently an investment plan ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/05/us-ford-spain-iduskbn0l925b20150205 ) of $ 2.3 billion in the almussafes ( valencia ) factory . 
  it has become the biggest factory of the group outside china . 
  edit : i checked volkswagen news , and a year ago the group announced that they would invest [ $ 800 million in a new factory in poland ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20pngg/volkswagen_to_build_eur_800m_factory_in_poland/ ) . 
  he has said that wants to be out of the european convention on human rights , like belarus . 
  or he has said something that sounds like that . 
  it is not from his real estate investments . 
  inditex is having crazy levels of profits . 
  he got $ 894,4 millions of dividends in 2014 . 
  everybody is investing in real estate in london . 
  amancio ortega is investing all the dividends of inditex ( zara and others ) on real estate . 
  his first target is london as usual : * http://www.auraree.com/real-estate-news/amancio-ortega-pays-e335-mn-rio-tinto-headquarters-london/ * http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2861535/spanish-railway-worker-s-son-britain-s-richest-landowner-billionaire-zara-fashion-chain-owns-large-parts-mayfair-city-office-blocks.html * http://www.cityam.com/213540/zara-founder-s-buying-spree-oxford-st he also has bought the full picasso tower in madrid , half of the shopping space in paseo de gracia in barcelona , a lot in manhattan ... [ he has invested more than $ 10 billions outside inditex/zara ] ( http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/tmg11275203/zara-founder-amancio-ortega-ranked-uks-richest-landowner.html ) , but only real estate . 
  come on !, 
  former yugoslavia has been too much time without popping out a new goddam country !, 
  those are at spain already . 
  maybe it 's because i have seen some people fall really hard these years at spain .
