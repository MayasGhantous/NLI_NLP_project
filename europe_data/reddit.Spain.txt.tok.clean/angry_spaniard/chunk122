  but usually it is like your husband and you lose their job , money runs out , and at some point the husband simply leaves . 
   that 's also why you should n't have kids without a secure job ( or set of skills ) and some serious savings . 
  jobs and careers are n't forever , at least for many people . 
  who wants as many welders at spain anymore ? 
  i wonder how you define secure job , or set of skills , and if more than 20 % of the population in age of having children at spain fits the definition . 
   as a single parent , you get free daycare in germany otherwise how would you work ? 
  that is worth about 400 euros a month where i live . 
  you need some austerity . 
  the children can be taken care by grandparents or relatives that are retired or jobless . 
  we have an autonomous region with [ the same name and borders ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aragon ) . 
  proper aragon had another language also , and in its borders catalan is a minority language in the eastern part . 
  13 autonomous regions have elections the 24th of this month . 
  he said something like that in [ an article ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/retrones/discapacitado-feliz-gilbert-insultar_6_130596952.html ) one year before joining podemos . 
  the journalist said :  i imagine that getting to where have you gotten has been difficult . 
  * she was refering about his phd , and doing his work as researcher . 
  his answer was :  the truth is that no . 
  actually it has been quite easy  * pues la verdad es que no . 
  * mostly he is happy with his different set of capacities , and for him his work was easy but drinking water or going to the toilet difficult . 
  the article is interesting , but hard to translate in geral . 
  pablo echenique , the candidate of podemos . 
  [ mep for podemos ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/125036/pablo_echenique_cv.html ) and he worker doing research in theoric physics until 2014 in the csic . 
  he also wrote about disability in an online newspaper . 
  i liked [ this article ] ( http://m.eldiario.es/retrones/discapacitado-feliz-gilbert-insultar_6_130596952.html ) . 
  looks more like many selfies together . 
   hsbc are always threatening to leave . 
  hsbc is not the only one always threatening to leave . 
   were we 're, 
  you get a written reprimand from the european commission . 
  well , and it usually means that your economy is n't going very well . 
  but we noticed . 
  our target is slightly above of what spain had in 2007 . 
  it is completely absurd to expect spain to be there before 2030 . 
  unless they want to fund the construction of another 5 millions of homes and some airports . 
  the basque country got those privileges because they were in the winning side in the succession war . 
  c 's does n't want to abolish them because the dispute itself , because nobody else can have them and it is unfair . 
  but it is very dangerous to touch , or not touch . 
  check the [ nueva planta decrees ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nueva_planta_decrees ) . 
   they abolished internal borders and customs except for the basque territory , giving grant to all spaniards to trade with american colonies ( not only castillians , as before ) . 
  the privileges have been changing , but even today the basques have a separated tax service . 
  they have a corporate tax 2 % lower always than the rest of the country and autonomy to decide exclusively their income tax levels . 
  and the basque foral ( from fueros , the old laws ) institutions collect taxes at basque territories while the rest of spain has the spanish normal tax service . 
  basque country and navarre do n't contribute to cohesion funds of the spain ( the found of territorial compensation ) , at least nowadays they have to contribute to the national budget and they ca n't customs anymore in spanish products . 
  and nobody else can have this status . 
  and do n't talk about touching this . 
  the [ basque dominant party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basque_nationalist_party ) is literally :  in basque it is called euzko alderdi jeltzalea ( eaj ) ( literally meaning ` basque party of supporters of god and old laws ' , or fuero ) a very traditionalist party , and for them preserving the old laws ( from basque fiscal system to the separated and strange inheritances law ) is more important than anything . 
  another example of the old laws , [ bayl\u00edo privilege ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/fuero_de_bayl%c3%ado ) . 
  a separated marriage land that some muncipalities in the border with portugal and ceuta have . 
  the party that it 's raising now , c 's ( ciudadanos/ciudadans ) was originally a liberal unionist party at catalonia , that has gone national recently . 
  you do n't understand spanish politcs , and you are lucky . 
  catalan and basque nationalist people in this thread are concerned about what effects would have that in spanish politics . 
  more importantly because nobody likes the spanish political framework , and there relevant political blocks that want to move in different directions . 
  why the basque guy : c 's has always wanted to remove the fiscal privileges that basque country has because they supported the bourbon in the succession war 1700-1714 . 
  of course touching that is impossible without risking the return of eta and for sure the pnv , the party that has been the most voted in all the basque elections in 40 years , will become pro-independence . 
  then there is the catalan situation . 
  the catalan nationalism is incredible unhappy with the extension of c 's to the rest of spain . 
  they have a tendency to talk shit about it everywhere they can . 
  the status of catalonia and basque coutry may change after the next elections , and for certain people is the most important thing at stake . 
  in some way , people with an agenda . 
  but this is spain everybody has an agenda . 
  but nobody can create a majority to go anywhere . 
  spain is sort of frustrating , i love it somehow . 
  we are a very complicated country with a lot of history and an institutional framework that is a bunch of legacy bullshit and improvisation to keep it together and sort of working . 
  we ca n't even have have lyrics for the anthem ( i prefer it like this , honestly ) . 
  edit : bonus , do you see any other country with so many users with an alternative national flag ? 
  ted cruz is a commie comparing with some people that you can find on reddit . 
  and this guy is spanish . 
  it will affect the approach to the greek question . 
  but reaching an agreement that includes any concessions to the greek government was unlikely anyway . 
  spain and portugal are probably going to keep a harder line also . 
   did they remove the minimal wage ? 
  no they do n't defend that everybody should earn the same either , and cut the power of unions to negotiate collective agreements . 
  nobody is arguing that they are liberal . 
  conservative ! = pro-free market , at spain . 
   did they make energy market free ? 
  no is the energy market public ? 
  no , it is private . 
   did they make the water market free ? 
  no but it is privatized in most of spain , and the dominant company at valencia [ agbar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grupo_agbar ) is foreign owned . 
  and if we continue , your definition of socialist is interesting . 
  according to that the us republican party is socialist . 
  the [ weighted average of the polls of polls by electrograph was saying that ] ( http://www.electograph.com/p/electograph-poll-of-polls.html ) for a while and they are more accurate than the official . 
  they use the same metodology as nate silver 's fivethirtyeight . 
   pp that got build by ex-franco & co friends raised the vat increased taxes recently hired more bureaucrats put in place more regulation pp has n't moved a lot in economic stuff from those days , maybe in decentralization of the state , and social issues . 
  and i would n't call socialist-like their way of handling the economy , this was the spanish way before marx was a thing . 
  private concession , the [ royal manufactures ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/manufactura_real ) . 
  the way of handling the economy of the pp is the line that conservatives have followed also in franco times . 
  remember the tobacco system with the estancos was established by franco . 
   psoe leader is pretty good looking , charismatic and serious he is not charismatic . 
  there has n't been a really charismatic politician leading a big party since felipe gonz\u00e1lez . 
  and what do you mean by serious ? 
  from his ambiguous discourse , to the silly apparitions on tv on `` el hormiguero '' and others ... 
  i mean he is mainstream , and wants the things to stay as they are , so that may be what you mean . 
  the lowest is portugal with 1.28  can someone with more knowledge of policies in those country tell me ? 
  poor childcare , parental leave only for women ( and 4 months ) , firing pregnant women is common , high unemployment , big chunck of the population in the age of having children is temporary workers and day laborers without savings ... 
  for that you should send him to cadiz . 
  [ 42 % of unemployment ] ( http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2015/04/23/empleo/1429775002_829054.html ), 
  it will be absurdly hard for everybody . 
   i highly doubt this would benefit the economy it would n't , maybe cheaper rents , but that would n't compensate . 
   given than tourism is actually a growing industry . 
  well , that 's what they want to stop , or move out of barcelona .
