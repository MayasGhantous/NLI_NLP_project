   why not try to employ more residents in the industry what do you mean ? 
  tourism employs people living in barcelona or the metropolitan area mostly already . 
  if you mean resident in touristic areas , the salaries in tourism ( other than the highest paid jobs ) do n't pay enough for that ( or if you prefer the higher cost of living of the areas makes more attractive long commutes ) . 
   while developing other industries as well ? 
  yes ... that is easy to say . 
   anyway , they are polling [ second with 17 % of the vote ] ( http://www.electograph.com/2015/05/barcelona-abril-2015-sondeo-feedback.html ) . 
  and most other parties support the current tourism model . 
  forbid the construction of new hotels and put restrictions/taxes on renting private apartments . 
  barcelona en com\u00fa includes [ something like that in their project ] ( http://barcelonaencomu.cat/ca/programa/navega/detall/establir-una-moratoria-en-la-concessio-de-llicencies-dallotjaments-turistics ) . 
  they are backed by podemos and icv ( catalan nationalism and eco-socialism ), 
  i am not sure if i hava an opinion , if i understood the situation correctly these are the main complains : * the tourist are dirty and noisy . 
  * tourist are too rich and are pushing prices up and replacing the businesses targeting locals for tourist traps ; forcing spaniards to move out of the city for living . 
  the venecian version of gentrification . 
  * simply : * `` the unsustainable numbers of tourists visiting the city each year . 
  '' * edit : the elephant in the room is that this is the only sector that is bigger today than in 2007 and it is the sector that shows the strongest growth ( a third of the jobs created are in tourism , and many others in retail and services targeting tourist ) . 
   i 've heard podemos even wants to wave spanish flags in their speeches , for god 's sake !, 
  the left has always had spanish flags in their speeches , although the one that i have as as flair not the official one . 
  why ? 
  the openly corrupt politicians have a clear majority and are able to form a government . 
  they should rule . 
   president of the country has privilege to drop down any penalty , however the current guy promised not to use it . 
  is he using it ? 
  i mean at spain pardons are so common that they do n't get into the news . 
  [ a normal year is like a pardon a day ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sehfhdo.jpg ) . 
   czech justice ( tm ) : former policeman was sentenced to 3 years suspended . 
  he tried to blackmail a businessman , asking for 400k euro . 
  is the government able to give a pardon over the suspension ? 
  it is the logical next step . 
  the political landscape is not stable so is hard to tell . 
  podemos wo n't do significant changes until after the regional elections ( at 13 regions ) and local elections the day 24th . 
  the party has been losing votes around the same time that c 's has been gaining it according to the polls . 
  we still do n't know who is going to replace monedero in his position . 
  the party has been moderating its discourse to compensate the appearance of liberal party that competes for the reformist/angry/anti-establishment voters . 
  it is hard to know how this is going to work : is it going to work ? 
  is it going to send the leftist back to iu without getting new voters ? 
  whatever happens in andalusia , is also important . 
  andalusia had elections the 25th of march but there is no new government for now . 
  if this lasts to the end of june they would have to repeat elections ( at most spanish regions you have to repeat elections every few months until somebody is able to form a government ) . 
  [ this is a good forecast of what would happen in case of national elections ] ( http://www.electograph.com/p/electograph-poll-of-polls.html ) now , as you can see this is sort of volatile .

  what do you mean ? 
  no , but students are n't part of the workforce unless they work . 
  think about this , with simplified figures with the current definition : * 60 % of the youth is studying full time and not working , even if some of them are seeking jobs . 
  * 20 % of the youth is working , they may also be studying . 
  * 20 % of the youth is looking for work and not studying so 40 % of the youth is part of the workforce . 
  and 50 % of that workforce is unemployed . 
  in addition , the definition of studying includes only formal education like universities , official professional training and official arts schools ; so many of the people defined as neet are going to language academies , non-official education ( the solar panel installer courses have been very popular and they have never been recognized ) , getting professional drivers license or whatever ... 
  so you may think that the definition is not perfect . 
  i checked some data according to the continuous municipal data the population fell in 1991 . 
  but not to the census projections used in wikipedia , that as far as i know they simply did linear interpolation between census until 1998 . 
  the comparable annual series corrected with census data only goes back to 1998 . 
  so i am not sure where that graph comes , but apparently there was at least a year with a population drop . 
  if you want have * fun * you can start digging [ here ] ( http://www.ine.es/jaxi/menu.do?type=pcaxis&amp;path=%2ft20%2fe260&amp;file=inebase&amp;l=1 ) . 
   again spain has financed always its budgets through the markets . 
  the 40 billions that spain got from the esm [ went straight to the financial sector ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/11/spain-banks-idusl5e8nbgef20121211 ) . 
  that banks bailout was an interesting play , the government refused to bailout directly the banks if the eu did n't provide at least low interest loans to fund the bailout . 
  but spain has never had troika visits or imf loans . 
  spain still had to use more money that the retrieved from the program . 
  the total direct bailout was 61.5 billions and [ 42 billions lost for now ] ( http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/economia/las-perdidas-por-rescate-bancario-disparan-42852-millones-3401070 ) . 
  beside that the government also put 2.2 billions in the [ bad bank ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sareb ) that bought assets worth nothing from the banks . 
  there were other short term loans and assets purchases , with non clear losses . 
  investors have n't expected seriously that the eu would let spain go bankrupt . 
  but during the negotiations of the esm the interests of the public debt to 10 years reached 7 % . 
  maybe you heard that . 
   they were good at cutting , firing , and dismantling the state but had no plan for taxes , corruption , bribery , etc. 
  i have heard that took some bribes and evaded taxes in a quite organized way . 
  they probably had plans about that . 
  [ spain has n't balanced its budget ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/30/spain-economy-budget-iduss8n0sq02720150430 ) . 
  even if you trust government forecast . 
   how much can you earn from such part time job ? 
  the rules for part time work are the same has before . 
  btw , 641 euros was with 14 salaries with 12 salaries it was 748 euros . 
  check [ google public data ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=ml9s8a132hlg_#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=minimum_wage&amp;fdim_y=currency:eur&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country&amp;idim=country:es&amp;ifdim=country&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) for more info . 
  748 was for full time , 40 hours/week ; so for 10 hours/week you would earn $ 187 . 
  from that you would have to take the worker contribution to social security ( there is no discount for that ) a 6.4 % . 
   i 've never checked if this was implemented , was it ? 
  no , of course . 
  part time employment was subsidized ( with charge to the pension system ) for a while . 
  so now a higher percentage of the workforce works part-time . 
  i think that they decided to pretend that was the same . 
  spain still has social security discounts ( that still generate the right for a full pension without full contribution ) for hiring long term jobless under 30 and above 45 , and women in sectors where they are a minority . 
  i checked the discounts still enforced [ here ] ( http://www.infoautonomos.com/informacion-al-dia/gestion-empleados/tipos-contratos-de-trabajo/ ) . 
  all these social security discounts are probably helping to create work and the economy on short term . 
  but they are also making worse the situation of our pension system . 
  edit : since the current government took office the money in the pension fund [ has fallen a 38 % from 66,815 millions to 41,634 millions ] ( http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2015/03/23/actualidad/1427112290_513286.html ), 
   and if i 'm not mistaken , spain also saw a demographic decrease for a few years when it joined the european communities in 1986 . 
  you are mistaken . 
  the population did n't fell until now : [ you can see the figures ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_spain#vital_statistics ) you can take a peak at 1 of january , [ with the municipal registration figures ] ( http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/np904_en.pdf ) . 
  it fell another 170,000 inhabitants in 2014 . 
  this is still missing some cooking , the municipality registered population and the census projections adapted usually differ a little . 
  the spanish budget is not balanced . 
  not even at primary level ( before debt interest cost ) , that would be the greek .
