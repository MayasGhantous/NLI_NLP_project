  and this year there has been [ an income tax cut ] ( http://www.ey.com/gl/en/services/tax/human-capital/hc-alert--spain-reduces-personal-income-tax-rates-as-of-2015-and-modifies-tax-regime-for-inbound-assignees ) . 
  and the deficit is going to be like 5.4 % of the gdp . 
  the only year without net growth of unemployment at the first quarter in our comparable data was 2005 , the hottest year in the bubble . 
  the spanish economy has strong seasonal component . 
  [ check the epa figures ] ( http://www.ine.es/prensa/epa_tabla.htm ) . 
   but how long will it last ? 
  i keep hearing that the reasons are structural in the pro-government press , but they do n't look like it . 
  honestly , mostly looks like qe , cheap oil , governments taking it easy with budget cuts ( in fact the government gave an extra payment to public servants to compensate some cuts ) in an electoral year . 
  that does n't mean that the economy is going to tank at any second but the growth is going to probably to slow in 2016 . 
   thanks to the positive impact of structural reforms implemented over the past couple of years . 
  which reforms ? 
  it is not the first time that i read that , and it never explains the reforms . 
  there is a more detailed table below . 
  the number of ethnic latvians has also fallen it 's 1,229,067 at 2014 from 1,370,703 at 2000 . 
  russians are leaving at higher rate that 's true . 
  latvia is in a very bad situation long term with all that mass [ emigration and population aging ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_latvia ) . 
  latvia has lost 10 % of its population since it joined the eu . 
  i would n't say that latvia is firmly on track to something good . 
  edit : the article also talks about that :  latvian gdp shrunk by 16 % . 
  state spending and social services were slashed . 
  up to a tenth of the population emigrated . 
  edit : the [ latvian gdp is still below the peak before the recession ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:lva&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) . 
  even if the per capita figures are probably above due to emigration . 
  seriously i do n't think that this is a good scenario . 
  it is part of my character . 
  :p if you want to get really angry spaniards you need to discuss with / r/podemos . 
  do n't forget to defend austerity . 
  i am a software developer with a job ( in sweden ) . 
  so no . 
  well it sort of matters . 
  i think that remembering that the 60 % of youth unemployment is over a workforce of 40 % of the age work is relevant . 
  they pay , but the iron price . 
  not so many at spain , more like 200,000 . 
  wikipedia [ has an article about this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bolivarian_diaspora ) . 
  italy and portugal have surprisingly big venezuelan communities ( around 150,000 ) , maybe because many people from those countries emigrated to venezuela in the first half of the 20th century . 
  but usa is the biggest destination specially if you include illegal immigrants . 
  remember that most of the people in the age range is studying . 
  according to the epa * only * 20.5 % of the spanish youth are neets and the spanish young unemployment is 51.4 % . 
  austerity . 
  and some countries are closer to 50 % of young unemployment than 25 % . 
  he was an adviser of [ hugo ch\u00e1vez between 2005 and 2010 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/juan_carlos_monedero ) . 
  not sure of what 's going on . 
  if he is actually stepping down for ideological and strategic discrepancies as he has said . 
  or because the party does n't want to keep somebody in the first line that has had a so close relationship with venezuela , and that suspicious affair with all the money that venezuela and alba paid for consultancy services about esoteric affairs that ended in a left wing foundation and producciones con mano izquierda ( the media group that the founders of podemos use to produce some tv shows and documentaries that popularized them ) . 
  that 's not how free market reforms work . 
  at spain only the government and the blind people ngo once can organize lotteries . 
  there is a lot of pressure privatizing the public lottery without liberalizing the sector , of course . 
  do you want to invest in the spanish natural gas distribution monopoly ? 
  electricity distribution monopoly ? 
  or better in the airport management monopoly ? 
  other monopolies are in the stock market . 
  and the two private companies and half that control the oil ( bp , repsol and [ petronor ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/petronor ) ( owned in a 85 % by repsol ) ) . 
  and have kicked out any other companies like the french total with monopolistic practices . 
  [ that 's the greek the parliament ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:attica_06-13_athens_09_parliament.jpg ) . 
  i think that it has been full of riot police around the last 7 years for obvious reasons . 
  edit : [ that image seems to be from 2012 ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/debt-crisis-live/9073437/debt-crisis-as-it-happened-february-10-2012.html ), 
  see my [ other answer ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/349gdv/oecd_memberstates_by_average_hours_worked_per/cqsj85v ) we should have an economy 01 thread one day . 
  that 's not how productivity work . 
  the structure of the economy is more important . 
  if you worked in retail in a rural area in spain , you would be expected to be in the shop 60 or 70 hours a week but you would only have 2 or three clients an hour out of rush hour . 
  does n't matter how hard you work . 
  many low productivity jobs have really long hours in general , at spain at least . 
  [ they do n't ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuela-president-lays-path-for-economic-reforms-1421910454 ) . 
   he asked his countrymen to consider accepting an end to a gasoline subsidy that costs the cash-strapped government more than $ 12 billion a year , a politically sensitive proposal in a country where the fuel costs about a few pennies a gallon . 
  do you even poortugal ? 
  and [ greece is also close ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28nominal%29_per_capita ) . 
   do you think that 's because of rato or 27-s in catalonia ? 
  knowing rajoy , it can be for generating confusion internally and externally . 
  and to stop internal conspiracy inside the party . 
  rajoy is an electoral burden for the conservatives . 
  it 's unpopular , bad orator , the party has been financed illegally under his leadership , has lied too much and too badly to people ... a goat would get better electoral results . 
  if there is a realistic risk of early elections a palace coup for overthrowing rajoy would n't have time to succeed . 
  you may want to read [ this article about the debate about the succession of rajoy ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/04/20/opinion/1429555125_838503.html ) . 
  is n't the first quarter always like this ? 
  i mean [ spain has destroyed jobs the first quarter in all the years of the historically comparable data ] ( http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/epa_tabla_en.htm ) , including years when more than half million of jobs have been created except the hottest year of the construction bubble , 2005 . 
  can we get annualized data and a more detailed report ? 
  fyi , the anticorruption prosecutor is appointed by the government and the popular party is ruling with an absolute majority . 
  well , i do n't know any corruption affair of the other spaniards . 
  [ jose mar\u00eda chiquillo ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/jos%c3%a9_mar%c3%ada_chiquillo ) is also from my region . 
  he backstabed his own regionalist party ( that he leaded until some months before ) in exchange of a secure seat in the congress in 2004 . 
  but nothing illegal about that . 
  he has n't been relevant since then ; his original party entered in a dead spiral , and his new party has kept him in low profile high pay jobs . 
   d\u00cdaz tejera arcadio , spain from canary islands , unknown for me . 
  a quick check says that he was a former local left wing union leader . 
  he joined the socialist party , former senator . 
   [ agustin conde ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/agust%c3%adn_conde ) i have seen him before , but did n't recognize . 
  not very relevant middle level deputy of the conservative party . 
  he had a chance of doing big in the regional elections of 1999 . 
  but he had a big defeat . 
  since then he has been a low profile backbencher . 
  good luck with the government !, 
  do n't expect external help . 
   agramunt pedro , spain , epp/cd pedro agramunt is a politician from my region . 
  he was key in the illegal financing of the pp in the 80s . 
  he was investigated in the [ naseiro case ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/caso_naseiro ) . 
  he never went to prison because the recording of the conversations that proved his involvement were obtained in a narcotics case . 
  and they could n't be used in the illegal financing case . 
  edit : you can guess where the money came from . 
  we do n't have any formal conclusion . 
  not the last time that we seem some [ politicians with suspicious connections with drug dealing ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/03/31/inenglish/1364758860_166213.html ) .
