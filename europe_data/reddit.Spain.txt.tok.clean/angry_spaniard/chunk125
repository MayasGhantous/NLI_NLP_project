  do you even purple ? 
  why is your flair upside down ? 
  greece has the freedom of defaulting and probably leave the eu after or having government policies that are acceptable for the troika ( that probably excludes most of syriza electoral program ) . 
  that 's about it . 
   the `` troika '' only demands that greece actually balance their budget , ceases to be dependent on piling up additional loans just to keep their state working , and actually gets on their collective feet . 
  that 's not true . 
  the members of the troika want to dictate the policies for doing that . 
  the troika also demands that privatize state assets even if it is at a lost , a more regressive tax system based in stronger indirect taxation , co-payments in the health-care system and some other many concrete policies that are considered classic right wing policies usually . 
  the troika is not neutral and is trying to force the greek government to follow right wing policies . 
  * tldr : the situation can be worse . 
  * i would have taken another to years of extend and pretend for applying my political agenda locally . 
  with qe and the extension of a third bailout greece could have had the financial needs satisfied for a long while . 
  i personally think that an uncontrolled bankruptcy would be worse for greece that ruling within the margins that greece had . 
  and everybody except the greek government seems to think the same . 
  so they put themselves in a weak position . 
  greece got offered extending the length of the payments and reducing the interest . 
  that 's a reduction of the burden of the debt over the government . 
  but they insist in defaulting over the principal . 
  \u00bf qu\u00e9 considerar\u00edas una victoria for greece ? 
  * what 's winning to the troika ? 
  what would you call a victory for greece ? 
  * edit : this is an english sub-reddit and i prefer to keep the discussions in this subreddit in english . 
  so i am not a true republican if i do n't like how syriza has handled the situation . 
  is that ? 
  that 's absurd . 
  i understand , but i am not very optimistic i do n't like the odds . 
   first they ignore you , then they laugh at you , then they fight you , then you win or you lose , there is that other option . 
  are you fixing this with the new government ? 
  martinez-pujalte , the other politician involved , claims that [ it may not be ethic but it is legal ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2015/04/23/actualidad/1429776225_103601.html ) .

  edit : it happened , that is not under discussion , they have recognized it . 
  what is in question if it was legal , the company managed to get contracts and licenses with public administrations thanks to their advice . 
  they even paid taxes over the advice money .

  are n't the governments of the greek new democracy or the spanish pp too corrupt for backing them in public ?

  [ more than 100 millions of packs of cigarettes ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/11/eu-crackdown-tobacco-smuggling-spain-gibraltar )  the amount of tobacco brought into gibraltar has continued to rise in recent years , from 110m packs of cigarettes in 2012 to 117m packs in 2013 .

  wait for the official figures !, 
  i think that they will be published today or tomorrow . 
  we seem to be managing fine ( at my country ) . 
  and old people wo n't be consuming as you would be expecting because old people will see their pension reduced due to the aging of the population , the many years of unemploymen , during their careers and the pension cuts mandated by the pension reforms introduced in these years and wo n't have many saving due to these many years of unemployment either . 
  maybe i am extrapolating spain so much . 
  but this is going to happen in spain at least except surprises , and surprises can be for the worse . 
  struggling with economic stagnation , population aging and high unemployment . 
  but ignoring it and pretending that the problem is the unbalanced budgets .

  ( http://www.vistoenlasredes.com/vefs/2013/01/vef_329205_twitter_diferencias_por_elmediohombre.jpg ) the guy at the left is obviously an actor . 
  but , they are a small minority . 
  and it feels too french . 
  andorra , so we have a fiscal heaven less and all the culturally catalan areas in spain . 
  i am not sure if the french catalonia could be considered catalan anymore . 
  you should unify with macedonia , because they are asking for it . 
  here all the benefits ( not only the unemployment ones ) depend of being registered , and the access to training programs for jobless . 
  for example [ a 426 euros/month benefit for a maximum of a year for long term jobless over 45 ] ( http://www.sepe.es/contenidos/que_es_el_sepe/publicaciones/pdf/pdf_prestaciones/folleto_rai_esp.pdfl ) also require you to show proof that you asked for a job in at least x companies and did at least a job interview per month , and that you were registered in the unemployment service more than a year before ( and many other things ) . 
   what about the fact that pretty much nobody is hiring or wants to hire nowadays ? 
  the same at spain . 
  why then we have this difference in people considered jobless when the rate of working age people working is similar ? 
  [ your employment rate is similar ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ebd0a/eurostat_employment_rate_in_europe_2012/ ) . 
  but , your jobless do n't look for jobs so much . 
  and even better employment benefits . 
  they can create a fiscal heaven federation with luxembourg . 
   the lower class rents , the higher class owns . 
  [ 80 % of the people owns at spain ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_home_ownership_rate ) . 
  and if spaniards can go very long lengths for owning a house . 
  that has its problems for sure , specially for the working class . 
  a lot of families of with two salaries of 1,200 euros/month and a mortgage of 800 euros/month have evolved in families of a job of 1,000 euros/month and some seasonal job picking oranges / waiting tables . 
  a growing number of [ homeowners are being feed by charities ] ( http://www.lne.es/centro/2012/02/27/familias-hipotecadas-hijos-nuevos-demandantes-ayuda-caritas-nava/1205309.html ) , because if you ca n't afford to pay you mortgage and buying food you stop buying food and ask for food at charities at spain . 
  however , there is the factor that mortgages are for life until you pay them and if you stop paying one you are headed for permanent bankruptcy for the rest of your life with the 12 % of delay interest . 
  so it is the logical choice . 
  that would be in you country . 
  in mine the working class , precariat and the jobless are indebted ( in many cases owing way more than all their assets ) . 
  the middle class owns one or two houses , has one or two cars , savings , undefined duration contracts if they do n't own their own business and the ones that have debts have a mortgage that they do n't have problems servicing . 
  however , i am aware that some people is confused about their social status . 
  also the size of the middle has been shrinking the last years .
