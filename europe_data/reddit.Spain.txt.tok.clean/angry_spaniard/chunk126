  the current eu treaties do n't contemplate that possibility . 
  leaving only the euro would require the approval of all the eu parlaments and a refer\u00e8ndum in ireland at least . 
  leaving the eu . 
  no , you should complain more , or you would end with rulers like him . 
  the flag of the 2nd spanish republic . 
  yes , but i would only describe like that the part until zaragoza . 
  what about jobs that allow you to have a good living ? 
  most refugees want to work in my experience . 
  all the rural areas are losing population except mediterranean touristic villages . 
  i want to point that we have a big continous area without any city : if [ this area ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jjac6h8.jpg ) ( called by some the serran\u00eda celtib\u00e9rica ) was an autonomous region it would : * an area of 63,098.69 km ^ 2 , twice the size of belgium . 
  * 503,566 inhabitants . 
  * 7,98 inhabitants/km ^ 2 . 
  it would be the only region outside the lapland with less than eight . 
  [ article in spanish ] ( www.eldiario.es/sociedad/espana-desaparece_0_323717749.htmlfce ) and most of, 
   a ) an european manufacturer they are * designed * ( using generic components ) at spain . 
  manufacturing is done at china . 
  far right is very small at spain , but they are catholic and homophobic . 
  take [ 2011 elections ] ( http://resultados.elpais.com/elecciones/2011/generales/congreso/ ) from 24,590,557 votes the far right parties : * pxc : 59,781 votes . 
  you can see it as the catalan version of the national front , but it has never been in the catalan or spanish parliament . 
  and it is bigger than all the other together . 
  uses the name of the dictatorship single party and claims to be its heir . 
  but most of the high officers of the dictatorship integrated in the currently ruling pp ( its first leader was an information minister of the dictatorship ) . 
  after 3 years of civil war and 36 years of dictarship , the far right is very hard to sell at spain . 
  spain and portugal are probably the two countries with the smallest far rights . 
  far left : the only pure far left in those elections were the pcpe ( soviet union nostalgic , they do n't talk about this ) with 26,436 votes and izquierda anticapitalista ( not very well defined economic ideology , but socially progressive ) with 24,456 votes that has been integrated in podemos . 
  including [ the leader in andalusia ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/teresa_rodr%c3%adguez ) . 
  spaniards ca n't go to spanish universities without paying . 
  the same rights as the local citizens . 
  and only for eu citizens . 
  do n't think that you can move to spain and go to university without paying . 
  the spanish financial sector is against a more debtor-friendly law . 
  and the two big parties have very interesting relationship with the financial sector . 
  * [ santander group and bbk have forgiven 22 millions in debt to the psoe ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2010/01/21/espana/1264105308.html ) . 
  surprisingly the psoe has done a lot for the santader group , [ including a pardon for a former ceo ] ( http://www.tumbit.com/news/articles/6910-psoe-went-too-far-with-santander-pardon.html ) * [ pp also got forgiven 2.8 millions ] ( http://elpais.com/diario/2005/11/19/espana/1132354803_850215.html ) . 
  and the [ santander group has paid rodrigo rato as adviser many times ] ( http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20130917/banco-santander-vuelve-fichar-rodrigo-rato-para-consejo-asesor-internacional/747092.shtml ) . 
  and rodrigo rato as former director of the imf , former minister of economy and former vice-pm is influential in the party . 
  i probably could put more examples of revolving doors . 
  the current minister of economy worked in lehman brothers . 
  [ the european union and the imf asked us to reform this ] ( http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2014/02/02/actualidad/1391361928_983094.html ) . 
  but it is not going to happen with a conservative government . 
  or reforming the property register notaries system , the pm and two of his brothers are * registradores . 
  mostly due to family traditions and to participate in the holy week celebrations . 
  you can be a member of a * cofradia * and atheist , [ it is not unheard ] ( http://www.andalucesdiario.es/ciudadanxs/un-hermano-de-monte-sion-no-soy-creyente-pero-me-encanta-la-semana-santa/ ) . 
  rajoy and pp have been doing lately some stuff that goes in the opposite direction of the first uears of government . 
  * they did a regressive income tax reform in december of 2011 with an emergency rdl , they did a progressive in 2014 . 
  * they removed primary and emergency health care for immigrants in irregular situation with health care cards ( mostly immigrants that lost their visa when they lost their jobs , but are staying ) . 
  they are restoring it this year . 
  * they started the legislature with a pack of measures pandering the catholic right and dictatorship nostalgic . 
  they reverted almost all of them ( catholic religion grades now computes for calculate the mean mark for high school , but that mark is mostly symbolic anyway ) . 
  some hard right people created vox , but nobody is voting them . 
  * they cut contributory unemployment benefits in 2012 . 
  the long term jobless that participate in insertion programs ( after +2 years seeking employment ) get noncontributory $ 426/month if they live in households with mean income below minimum wage during a maximum of a year . 
  before it was 6 months . 
  a total of 3 years on benefits ( 2 years of contributory around minimum wage and a year of noncontributory is the longest in our history ) . 
  and some other things . 
  although we are in an electoral year , so this should be taken with a pinch of salt ( or something like that ) . 
  edit : the law that you are pointing has not been relevant until now . 
  unless the creditor has goodwill is hard to get a clean up . 
  * pressure group : pah ( literally mortgage victims association ) , they got a [ european citizens prize from the eu parliament ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_citizens%27_prize#2013_winners ) . 
  * political party : podemos , iu ( united left ) and some regional hard left parties . 
  ada colau , the former spokewoman of the pah , is a candidate to mayor of barcelona by barcelona en com\u00fa , a voters 's platform ( not a formal coalition ) backed by podemos , iu , icv ( catalanist eco-socialist party ) some other minor parties . 
  she is not a member of any of the parties . 
  [ and she is leading the polls by a small margin ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/cataluna/2015/04/07/5522e4cee2704e293d8b457c.html?cid=smboso25301&amp;s_kw=twitter ) . 
  so this is going to an important matter in the near future . 
  ciudadanos does n't have a position about the matter as far as i know . 
  it depends of laws . 
  bankruptcy is for life at spain . 
  unless you pay everything and the official delay interest is a yearly 12 % right now . 
  almost nobody gets out . 
  edit : how is the bankruptcy law at italy ? 
  good luck !, 
  the federal eu . 
   really when people say this they mean it is the slowdown of the transition in to a closer more federal type eu that 's not gon na happen . 
  would it increase them ? 
  you know nothing !, 
  i suppose that everything is relative , for somebody in china spain may be a paradise of tolerance , co-existence and respect without tension between different cultures . 
  and yes switzerland handles better the relations between different communities that keep different languages and traditions better than belgium or spain , and i do n't like the elimination approach that france has mostly used . 
  me too , please !, 
  who counts the votes is critical , and should be a way difficult to manipulate and easy to audit . 
  advantatges of bailout boxes : * des-centralized counting , . 
  * easy to audit . 
  * privacy i still do n't know a e-voting system that can ensure secret voting and protect against manipulation . 
  i do n't trust my institutions so much . 
  the risks introduced are too high for so little gain . 
  voting with bailout boxes and paper is n't so hard guys !, 
  how switzerland manages to keep different cultures together without the level of tension that we have on spain , or the french frenchification . 
  protect the oppressed russian minority . 
  spain : you can have weapons ( hunting and handguns ) . 
  you only need to check if you are a drug addict , convict , alcoholic , physically and psychologically able , and you have to do test theory and practice . 
  what would you change ? 
  why ? 
  the point about how the votes are counted is true . 
   rodents one of the traditional ingredients in paella was a [ rodent ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/southwestern_water_vole ) . 
  you ca n't find paella with it anymore . 
  i blame all this modernization shit , the next thing will be stopping eating rabbit . 
  try [ sueca ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sueca,_valencia ) and suecia ( sweden ) in spain . 
   that would only apply while greece 's ppp adjusted per-capita welfare payments are below the eu average . 
  greece has an unemployment of 27 % , saying that the welfare payments should stay below eu average means that most of them should keep getting nothing . 
  [ spain also ] ( http://elpais.com/diario/2010/01/05/madrid/1262694258_850215.html ) . 
  and the catalan tv was good when we had it at valencia at least .
