  when jordi pujol was in power 20 years was probably its best moment . 
  edit : way better than the others at least . 
  now self-improvement cliches !, 
  for god shake !, 
   but i can not imagine to make a decent living off $ 25000 a year , most spanish people earns way less like that . 
  and it 's more than twice the average is romania . 
  calling that salary ridiculous seems almost offensive . 
   without having to deal with extreme cold . 
  4 years of prison pre-trial at spain . 
  but only a maximum of 72 hours without seeing a judge , a week if the police suspects that you are a member of eta . 
  and after that time you to have an accusation/charges . 
  even if the trial takes 10 years . 
  [ according to the wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_greece ) : russia is the biggest ** import ** partner , turkey is the biggest export partner . 
  edit : but i do n't know about agriculture only figures . 
  an order of magnitude weaker than the typical in western europe . 
  i am lazy . 
   so i am quoting the [ link about podemos ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30wo5y/the_podemos_revolution_how_a_small_group_of/ )  spain is not greece . 
  austerity may be hurting -- the roman catholic charity caritas distributed food , clothes and help to 2.5 million people ( one in 20 spaniards ) last year -- and [ 43 % of the jobless without benefits in november ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/economia/2014/11/05/5459d73a22601d65398b456d.html ) and growing . 
  however , we also have a legal mandate of taking care of parents or children if we have means and they have n't . 
  i remember a [ case from the news ] ( http://www.farodevigo.es/sociedad-cultura/2014/09/18/condenan-padre-gallego-mantener-hija/1096107.html ) . 
  the justice forced a father to provide for his 30 years old daughter , that did n't a close relationship with him or lived with him . 
  usually going to court is not needed because we have strong family networks . 
  short explanation of the benefits for non-disable people at spain following : the unemployment benefits expire in a maximum of 2 years . 
  the insertion income , for people that is in programs for increasing chances of getting a job can last a maximum of 6 months . 
  and it pays 426 euros , but only if you live in a household with mean income bellow minimum wage ( 753 euros ) . 
  a complementary program for 6 extra months has been created for only this electoral year for people that completed successfully the previous one paying the same . 
  after that you are of of benefits unless you are older than 55 years and have worked more than 18 years then you get the 426 euros forever . 
  edit : clarification . 
  there is not public housing ( at most of spain ) or housing allowance programs ( there were , but austerity ) . 
  madrid had public housing but [ it has been sold to goldman sachs ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/24/us-spain-housing-specialreport-iduskcn0id0gp20141024 ) . 
  it was not enough for all the people that needed it during the crisis anyway , and the people that did n't need it could n't be forced to leave easily so it was n't very effective , but it has not been replaced with anything . 
  pp ( spanish government ) is not posturing . 
  they have the law in their side and they could have negotiated earlier if they wanted . 
  artur mas is sort of posturing ( for keeping power ) , but a big chunk of his coalition ( ciu ) and most of the party ( erc ) that supports his minority government is not . 
  he is waiting for a majority in the spanish parliament more open to negotiations and a constitutional reform for saving face . 
  if we check the [ current polls ] ( http://www.electograph.com/p/electograph-poll-of-polls.html ) , pp is going from absolute majority with 44 % of the vote to 23.8 % and it 's the only pure pro-status quo party . 
  podemos , c 's , iu and upyd want constitutional reforms for their own convictions and psoe does n't have a firm position ( about anything actually ) . 
  the president of the generalitat ( catalan government ) and his party did n't support [ independence until 2012 ] ( http://catalannewsagency.com/catalonia-independence/item/the-main-catalan-nationalist-party-points-towards-catalonias-independence ) . 
  he only moved to support it when he was put in a position when was that or losing power . 
  native speakers around 7 millions . 
  the others are people learning at school or the streets . 
   most of the benefits systems in western europe will give you this i believe are spain and portugal western europe ? 
  it should have separated level for countries with more than 20 % . 
  why are n't we providing them with benefits ( cash , housing , training ) now ? 
  [ this is not the first time that the unemployment is over 20 % in spain ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z8o7pt6rd5uqa6_#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:sa&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:eu:non-eu&amp;idim=country:es&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) . 
  the point of podemos is internal . 
  it is asking for money inside spain . 
   even if you include the unemployed as having no income . 
  what you are saying it 's true . 
  and that does n't change the fact that we have 5 % of the population living from private charities . 
  [ 43 % of the jobless without benefits in november ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/economia/2014/11/05/5459d73a22601d65398b456d.html ) and growing . 
  as average my neighbor and me have a car per capita . 
  that does n't mean that i have a car , that i do n't have two cars or zero . 
  there is many wealthy people at spain and people with high salaries , but there is also a lot of poverty . 
  both things are truth . 
   there 's no way a federal system would be an acceptable middle-way for both parties ? 
  it makes sense , but the current majorities in both parliaments are against it , at least in rethoric . 
  except , for the ethnic turks this rings some bells . 
  we did n't have commies , but we had national-corporatist economy and then third-way post-social-democracy . 
   unlike the greeks , we 're not in any immediate danger of bankruptcy . 
  with the demographics of portugal at some point you are going to have a problem due to the pensions even with the current ones . 
  do n't you have ? 
  what are you commies ? 
  it would have been their soil if they would have won . 
  and part of the last one was in their soil . 
  what 's the status of the rocks/islands between madeira and canary islands ) ? 
  has portugal got the international recognition of them as portuguese islands ? 
  i see that the map claims them . 
  that looks old-fashioned . 
  black humor is like legs some people do n't have but they should n't be angry with the people that does . 
  podemos + pp is very unlikely . 
  podemos + c 's is the easiest to sell for podemos if you listen the anti-establishment discourse of podemos . 
  removing the corrupt old oligarchs that have ruled spain since the transition to democracy and all of that . 
  the new allying for removing the old ... of course , agreements between the new parties and the establishment are possible but complicated . 
  for c 's allying with the ruling pp seems hard to combine with the promises of fighting corruption and regeneration . 
  specially with half of the leaders of pp including the pm suspected of corruption and illegal financing . 
  psoe at least changed the leader by somebody not very smart , but without a criminal record and that looked good in a camera . 
  the main [ economist of c 's said that rajoy must go in the ft ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e2362e6a-64e5-11e4-ab2d-00144feabdc0.html ) , a couple of months before joining the leadership of the party . 
  and in general i do n't think that nobody will want to ally with pp if rajoy does n't leave , it may happen but it would be very hard to sell . 
  remember that syriza in greece preferred to ally with the anti-establishment right than with the establishment left . 
  tldr : * pp ( epp ) : spanish conservatives . 
  ** 23.1 % ** * podemos , the purple and the circle ( sits with gue/ngl ) : anti-establishment left . 
  ** 22.6 % ** * psoe ( pes ) : spanish traditional center-left . 
  ** 19.9 % ** * c 's ( alde ) : new liberal party . 
  ** 15.0 % ** * iu ( party of the european left ) : establishment anti-capitalist left . 
  ** 4.3 % ** * upyd ( sits with alde ) : sort of moderate conservative party founded by a member of the psoe that lost the elections to the leadership of the psoe and saw the market niche of moderate center right . 
  ** 3.3 % ** c 's is going to eat upyd , that it 's heading for a big internal crisis . 
  other than that it 's hard to forecast changes . 
  metodology :  electograph poll of polls is a 30-day weighted average of spanish general election polls . 
  its aim is not to predict the outcome of the election , but to gauge opinion trends . 
  the following polling firms/institutes are taken into account :, 
  private monopolies & overpriced management contracts of public hospitals and others are n't free market reforms . 
  well , that 's a tricky question . 
  you hava a point . 
  modern psoe is monarchist , contrary to derogate the concordat , support the peculiar system of restricted markets capitalism that we have ... 
  i mean the registradores de la propiedad like rajoy . 
  a left wing party , , would think that their should be done by the government . 
  a liberal party would try to adopt a free market that give the option to select between different notaries . 
  the economic discourse of ciudadanos puts them in liberal positions . 
  the discourse of podemos in social-democratic positions ( they may have a hidden agenda or no but the discourse post eu elections is social-democratic ) .
