  but putting the psoe anywhere is complicated , they do a mixture of social-democratic discourse and some socially progressive policies combined with the same economic policies of pp when they are in power . 
  it does n't work : * the candidates for the andalusian elections were andalusians . 
  * no quiero que en andaluc\u00eda mande un partido llamado ciutadans y su presidente , albert '' i do n't want in andalusia a party called ciutadans ( catalan for citizens ) with a president called albert ruling . '', 
  the leader of pp is not andalusian either . 
  it is not about the andalusian branch of the party , that is andalusian people . 
  the allusion of the party being called ciutadans is because that 's the founding name , being a catalan unionist party created because nobody trusted anymore the spanish national parties in catalonia . 
  they decided to expand to all spain because the point is also true for all spain . 
  it is not the first time that all the leading team of a party created from scratch by a group of friends is from the same area . 
  all the leaders of the re-founded psoe from 1976 to around 1990 were for people from seville ( andalusia ) . 
  all the leaders of podemos are from madrid ( all of them worked or studied at some point at the complutense university of madrid ) and all the leaders of ciudadanos are from barcelona . 
  we will know more in may when we have municipal elections in all the country and regional ones in all the regions except andalusia , basque country , catalonia and galicia . 
  they seem to be eating voters from pp as podemos is eating the ones from iu and psoe . 
  so they do n't compete directly . 
  except at the center . 
  * well , they are sort of centrist , to right of psoe , to the left of pp . 
  * they are pro-gay marriage , they are n't confessional catholic , that probably makes them socially liberal . 
  * they are also sort of pro free market , unlike the spanish traditional right that prefers the economic model that franco left . 
  at least in theory , pp sometimes also talks about free markets and liberalization when they are n't in power . 
  imagine that an ulster unionist party decided to go to national politics , started to do well in the polls , and then the british conservative party started to insinuate that people from northern ireland is not actually british and members of the government said that they do n't want to be ruled by someone called cearbhall , and that britain should n't be rule from belfast . 
  bonus if the conservative party in question has been always refusing a self-determination vote because the british nature of northern ireland is not under question . 
  maybe , it 's because i am also catalan-speaking ( from valencia ) . 
  but this disturbs me a little bit . 
  there are municipal elections in all spain and regional elections in all the regions except andalusia basque country catalonia and galicia in may . 
  bonus : an article about the [ xenophobic declarations of the pp ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/andalucia/2015/03/12/5501bd86e2704ecc628b4573.html ) in spanish . 
  and there are been more by low profile members of the party . 
  some times you feel like many castilians do n't actually see catalans as spaniards . 
  of course !, 
  germans are of nazi !, 
   edit : bonus . 
  [ leader of podemos singing a protest song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qlrovso3ja ) , it was against the us and the nato , but with a small wink against germany and merkel . 
  no , for sure . 
  why would you think that ? 
  they are anti-establishment party , they ca n't reach agreements with the establishment unless the they are the bigger party . 
  the most likely is a minority government of psoe . 
  podemos and ciudadanos will not vote when it 's time elect the regional president . 
  podemos has bad relations with the psoe , but all the parties including podemos has worse relations with pp . 
  pp has even damaged its relations with ciudadanos needlessly with xenophobic saying things about if you want to be ruled by a party that it 's leaded by catalan people . 
  all the leading team of ciudadanos is catalan , that 's true , but all the leading team of podemos is from madrid and nobody has done this with them . 
  no , but andalusia is their weakest region and the candidate was n't very good handling the media . 
  if this is translated to national level they would get around 100 members of the spanish parliament and pp and psoe around 200 of 350 . 
  not enough for ruling . 
  probably pp first force , podemos then and psoe after ( psoe is very weak outside andalusia ) . 
  as requested by / u/ycyc * psoe : social-democrats , ruling andalusia since it got self-government in 1981 . 
  the psoe in andalusia is n't the same as in catalonia and it 's more socially conservative . 
  * pp : spanish mainstream conservatives . 
  * podemos ( we can ) : anti-establishment left wing party founded by a group of university professors and researchers in political science connected throught the complutense university of madrid . 
  * ciudadanos ( citizens ) : the catalan center-right unionist party ciutadans has gone national three months ago . 
  * iu : united left : from 12-5 . 
  the traditional coalition of anti-capitalist left around the spanish communist party . 
  it includes cut-bai , the party of the mayor of marinadela . 
  it 's a good result for psoe and ciudadanos , and really bad for pp and iu . 
  podemos has behaved as expected , but they expected the heaven by assault or something . 
  to portuguese . 
  the orgaziners want to label these protests as pro-dignity and not anti-austerity for pr-reasons . . 
  the motto of the demonstrations was * `` pan , trabajo , techo y dignidad '' * , that translates to * `` bread , work , roof and dignity '' * whatever , the press seems to be ignoring it . 
  btw , these demonstrations have happened the day before elections in andalusia . 
  i said something similar in other thread . 
  ** spain ** * elections in andalusia today . 
  [ psoe , repeats the same number of mp ] ( http://www.resultadoseleccionesparlamentoandalucia2015.es/01au/dau01999cm_l1.htm ) * madrid pp mayoral hopeful aguirre 's campaign aide targeted in p\u00fanica case . 
  isabel gallego under scrutiny over use of public money for work to improve officials ' images . 
  not a big case , but this adds to her vice-president and half of the regional ministers from when she was the regional president . 
  [ en ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/03/20/inenglish/1426861537_343392.html ) * finance minister stresses his lack of ties to consultancy under scrutiny that he founded and directed and he is favoring now as minister . 
  [ en ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/03/20/inenglish/1426866310_018785.html ) * demonstrations pro-dignity ( they noticed that anti-austerity sounds bad ) , the motto was `` bread , work , roof , dignity '' . 
  [ en ] ( http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news-spain/madridnews/the_second_march_for_dignity_once_again_brought_thousands_to_madrid_to_demonstrate.shtml ) * supreme court jails eight over 2011 catalan parliament siege . 
  [ en ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/03/17/inenglish/1426598981_909872.html ), 
   being `` anti-austerity '' is a ) negative and b ) really broad . 
  it has no specific demands for the government to actually do . 
  the orgaziners know that . 
  the motto of the demonstrations was * `` pan , trabajo , techo y dignidad '' * , that translates to * `` bread , work , roof and dignity '' * [ spanish article ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.es/2015/03/21/marchas-de-la-dignidad_n_6915942.html ) . 
  and the press knows that . 
  so they call the demonstrations anty-austerity and do n't talk about what they are asking for . 
   if you want change , vote . 
  spain even has proportional representation so there 's no excuse . 
  with provinces as circumscription . 
  it 's proportional in madrid that elect \u00a1 36 , but not a lot in soria that elects two . 
  the final effect is that the system favours the two most voted in each province . 
  btw , these demonstrations in madrid happened the day before elections in andalusia . 
  \\  implying blacks are human . 
   well , one of the guests , a journalist from the newspaper taz , said greeks do not get any financial support after one year of unemployment , not even welfare . 
  spaniards after a maximum of 2 years . 
  if they live in households with less than minimum wage income per capita they have the right of a welfare check of $ 426 for six months to a year ( depending of cases ) if they participate in programs to increase their employ-ability that have almost zero success rate . 
   how bad could it possibly be though ? 
  it 's bad . 
  and you are right russia is only a small portion , and this has happened before without problems with russia . 
  we can blame the cap , the trade agreement to import mediterranean fruits from morocco or whatever , but the russian crisis is only a small factor . 
  i would only blame the cap in the sense that without subsidies there would be less production and less people working on farming at spain . 
  i do n't have a complete explanation . 
  i only can tell that there are farmers producing fruit that they are n't able to sell . 
  oranges in my area , near valencia . 
  but , you need factories or something for processing it . 
  no factory is interested in buying spanish apples even for almost free . 
  the same happens with oranges , lemons and others . 
  once in a while spain produce a lot that nobody buys and has to be left in the fields , given away for free or destroyed . 
  it is complicated to give a non biased summary . 
  the founding team is group of professors and researchers of political science of known left wing ideas connected by the ucm ( complutense university of madrid ) . 
  however , they are avoiding left wing symbols to no alienate non left-leaning voters . 
  some of them worked as advisors or something to the government of venezuela , but they are trying to minimize their connection with venezuela . 
  their program is mostly democratic regeneration , corruption fighting . 
  generic center-left proposals ( universal access to university , health care , housing , progressive taxation , make expensive temporary employment , more generous retirement pensions ) the typical things the psoe has promised always , but never deliver when they get power ( well they legalized abortion and gay marriage ) . 
  i am not getting into if they can be realized , if they are good or bad or even if they will actually try to apply their program if they win the elections ( they would be the first ) .
