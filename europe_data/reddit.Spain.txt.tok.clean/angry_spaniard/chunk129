  they have an official subreddit / r/podemos , if you want to get an insider view . 
  edit : [ they had a thread or something with an outsider ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/podemos/comments/2vcwsp/he_recibido_un_comentario_ingl%c3%a9s_a_mi_hilo_de/ ), 
   spain is well known commie sympathizer . 
  spain is a well known extremely divided country . 
  it sort of comes from the history . 
  the conservative party is also to the right of most eu epp parties and was founded by a former information minister of the dictatorship , and to a certain point is a continuation of it . 
  you can also find plenty of austrian economist defending the golden standard . 
  btw , the government is in the hands of that party right now . 
  also missing gibraltar and andorra . 
  going to buy tobacco there is a thing . 
  then [ this happens ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_latvia ) . 
  do i need to explain the problems of these demographics ? 
  i am sure that podemos hates this call for early elections . 
  andalusia , basque country and catalonia are the regions where podemos is weaker . 
  and in andalusia is not due to a strong regional left wing party like bildu ( basque abertzale/patriotic left ) at basque country or icv ( eco-socialist ) and cup ( catalan nationalist and libertarian socialist ) at catalonia . 
  rent is also expensive and in a country with 25 % of temporary workers and day laborers ( actually more , because at employment survey 25 % of the people working at the moment are that , but many people goes in and out of short contracts ) is the way to go unless you are happy with living with your parents forever . 
  many apartments are out of the market . 
  with so many precarious workers and there is a 24 % of unemployment a significant amount of people become unable to pay their rent . 
  and people tend to force to stay as much as possible , the old good i would get a job soon and so on . 
  and going to court to get an eviction is slow and expensive , however there are insurances for that . 
  the courts are slow and understaffed so it also takes a while . 
  so you better ask for a big signal , a high monthly rent , and proof of long term employment . 
  otherwise better let it empty . 
  for selling : private homeowners do n't like to sell bellow what they paid , specially if they still have a mortgage , and the banks tend to keep the houses in their balances as much as possible to pretend that they are n't bleeding as much money . 
  and the banks are n't giving mortgage as in the bubble days . 
   let 's work from some favela towns because social justice . 
  i was actually thinking that we should allow to built fabelas or having regulated shanty towns seeing as the empty homes all over the place at spain are too expensive for the people to afford them . 
  well they are as average as white as the spanish . 
   spain received just 444 million eur more than from the eu that it contributed . 
  that is a tiny fraction from the spanish current account surplus .  spanish current account surplus . 
  [ spain had account surplus of $ 1.2 billions in 2014 ] ( https://www.bbvaresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/bp_dic_20151.pdf ) ( bbva foundation analysis in spanish , i think that a web of the government has data in english but it is a mess ) , 0.1 % of the gdp so that would be a third . 
  and spain had an account deficit of 10 % at the peak of the real estate and credit bubble . 
  [ it was 0.8 % of the gdp in 2013 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00043 ) but the people is starting to be able to get loans again . 
  `` we also had in germany a time when a man came telling nice things , `` declared j\u00fcrgen donges , economist and adviser to the government german . 
  according donges , the similarity between the german dictator and the formation of pablo iglesias is that both `` capitalized discontent of citizens '' . 
  he also advised against appeasement and/or concessions to the left . 
  at least he did n't compare the people that defends concessions to the left with chamberlain . 
  like restoring the universal access to justice . 
  the currrent government introduced some high fees for [ physical persons and they are removing them now ] ( http://icapalencia.es/blog/2015/03/01/el-gobierno-deroga-las-tasas-judiciales-para-personas-fisicas/ ) . 
  not anymore , with like 2 million of long term jobless coming from construction the salaries have become lower and will stay low for the foreseeable future . 
  [ there are cases of people working for 4 euros/hour ] ( http://blogs.20minutos.es/arsenioescolar/2013/01/22/la-hora-de-peon-de-la-construccion-cae-a-4-euros/ ) , and that 's notorious in a country with a minimum wage equivalent to 5.15 euros/hour . 
  still , usually no so extreme but a construction worker ca n't expect a higher salary than a waiter . 
  and i do n't expect construction to grow a lot in the country of the 3.5 millions of empty homes , empty commercial areas , empty technological parks , empty office space , empty airports , empty motorways , oversized ports ... or at least it should n't , but with spain you never know . 
  the times when an unskilled construction worker earned more than a software engineer are gone . 
   ironically , spain has increased its share of europe 's industrial gross value added even as it has lost manufacturing jobs due to big gains in productivity . 
  it 's a significant point : coca cola invested millions in modernizing 7 factories in spain closing another 4 and reducing the number of employees in 750 . 
  increasing their production capacity at the same time . 
  many companies are performing restructuring restructuring plans that are sending many people out of the labour market while their production and profits increase . 
  i understand that the point of a business is not creating jobs . 
  but they should be smarter with this . 
  with all this cases close to elections , they are asking for some backslash if the left gets to power ( i would n't bet about it ) . 
  and also sucks that most of the job creation is still in tourism , bar/restaurants and construction . 
  / r/podemos is that way . 
  this sub is in english also . 
  some of them are . 
  i recomend you [ marina d'or ] ( http://www.valenciaplaza.com/ver/130309/las-grietas-de-marina-dor-jesus-ger-entre-concursos-y-fracasos.html ) if you want the experience of a freshly built ghost town near the sea . 
  it 's near the ghost airport of castell\u00f3n for more references . 
  and there you have why i stopped with the weekly news . 
  well that and that i do n't live at spain anymore . 
  almost every sunday . 
  and briging the leftovers to work on monday . 
  if you manage to get pregnant sure . 
   actually , russian-speakers make up even higher share in estonia : in harjumaa ( capital area ) : 37 % , ida-virumaa : 82 % ( census 2011 ) . 
  does it include ethnic belorussians and ukrainians integrated in the russian speaking communities ? 
  thinking loud . 
  this may be an explanation for the discrepancy . 
   with stronger institutions improving the institutional framework of the eurozone is not realistic with some actor with veto rights with opposite views . 
  that was bad !, 
  that should n't have happened and it should n't happen again !, 
  and one good way of preventing it is scrapping the euro . 
  i would say that the eu as political system is distrusted . 
  but the spanish political framework is even more distrusted . 
  the euro was a bad idea . 
  but it seems that it 's going to stick and without measures to make it work . 
  i would like an eu without euro if that was possible . 
  many of the things done are worth it . 
  there has been a big error and some other smallers . 
  i still think that part of this mess should be saved . 
  if possible . 
  you should thank the immigrants for that . 
  but you are living in croatia . 
  they needed to build something to get bribes and illegal funding from construction companies . 
  giving infrastructure to rural areas and small cities is always popular . 
  and there was n't so much to build that was needed in those areas . 
  * [ there are also many unneeded toll roads that are bankrupt-bailout ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/03/26/inenglish/1395835284_329391.html ) * or trains like [ an unneeded train to a warner theme park that has never been popular ] ( https://translate.google.es/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.elmundo.es%2fmadrid%2f2013%2f12%2f09%2f52a63ea90ab7405c1a8b456c.html&amp;edit-text= ) the responsible of the ghost airport had 3 millions of euros that he was n't able to explain . 
  and [ he had already cleaned $ 2.2 with lottery tickets ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/20131025/the-politician-who-reinvented-the-rules ) . 
  that 's why it was actually built . 
  finally there is a saying `` the box at the bernabeu ( real madrid stadium ) is where big businesses are done '' . 
  [ florentino p\u00e9rez ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/florentino_p%c3%a9rez ) , the president of the football team , is also the ceo of acs the company that it 's the biggest contractor of spanish public administrations , specially for the conservative party from building airports to garbage picking . 
  he started his fortune when he worked as city councillor in madrid during the transition to democracy . 
  http://wiki.15m.cc/wiki/lista_de_aeropuertos_fantasma some of this airports have some empty flights to pretend to have usage like burgos . 
  well and the malaga is not a ghost airport , but it has less traffic now than before duplicating the capacity . 
  edit : huesca is missing in that list . 
  [ it has not had commercial flights since 2012 ] ( http://www.abc.es/20110405/espana/abci-aragon-aeropuerto-201104050343.html ) it was not a good list of completely ghost airports . 
  it should be demolished like this one . 
  they may be after the national elections in november . 
  it was a success for the politicians , the only problem for them is that the brain of the operation was caught with 3 millions that he did n't try to explain ( probably the smartest strategy ) and he is in prison for tax fraud . 
   carlos fabra , a local politician and the brains behind the project . 
  fabra , a member for the governing pp and the former head of the castellon region , is unlikely to see the first plane land , however , since he is now serving a four-year sentence for tax fraud . 
  no , that 's [ another ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ciudad_real_central_airport ) we have many ghost international airports .
