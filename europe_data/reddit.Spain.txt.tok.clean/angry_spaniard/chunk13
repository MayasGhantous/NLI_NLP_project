  the first thing that i would mention is the around 40 different employment contracts models . 
  training contract , per project contract , day laborer contract , per project contract for trainning , weird per-project outsourced contract ( these one can be transfered to other company without cost if the employer loses the contract ) ... all these limited duration contracts are free to fire or less than a month of salary to pay , by the way . 
  between 25 % of 33 % of the employed people has one of these depending of the economic situation . 
  there are also undefined duration contract ( severance variable depending of the reason to fire and the situation of the company ) and promotion of employment contracts . 
  there are versions of the contracts with bonfications for disabled people , mentally challenged people , youth ... 
  there are two types of self-employment excluding business administrators . 
  one for depending self employees that only work for a company and in practice are not allowed to work for more by their employer . 
  and other for normal self-employed people . 
  stats : * [ spain has 3,000,000 of self-employed people ] ( http://www.infoautonomos.com/informacion-al-dia/el-autonomo-en-espana/autonomos-en-espana-evolucion-numero-altas-bajas/ ) . 
  * around three millions of public sector workers , not all of them public servants . 
  [ es ] ( http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/1540303/0/espana/cola-europa/empleados-publicos/ ) * 4.5 millions of jobs with limited duration contracts ( many for the government , overlaping with the previous figure ) . 
  * 17.3 millions of employed people . 
  [ en ] ( http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/epa_tabla_en.htm ) ( including self-employed people ), 
  honestly . 
  you or the article are n't going to the detail of what needs to be changed of the current laws . 
  not generalization , the actual law . 
   the issue may be the salary may be much lower than you are used to in the uk . 
  and the working conditions and the general treatment from your employers . 
  as spaniard i have had too many bad experiences with spanish employers . 
  they offer low salaries in not very worker-friendly work environment and they are surprised of having problems finding employees . 
  talking from my personal experience , not any serious analyisis . 
  i just remembered the [ esquilache riots ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/esquilache_riots ), 
  i have never seen one at spain . 
  the only time that i have seen one with niqab was at stockholm , by the way . 
   i have heard that at el vendrell ( catalonia ) , there were some . 
  that 's probably the best on the long run . 
  it 's not like spain is getting a better country . 
  the previous pm of the ruling party is [ an advisor of the biggest energy company ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/01/11/endesa-aznar-iduslde70a1ap20110111 ) nothing suspicious . 
  tell me more about the labor laws that we have . 
  his only current affair is his interest in [ bunkering done on gibraltar ] ( http://campopulse.blogspot.se/2012/09/minister-asked-about-his-connections.html ) in conditions that would be illegal at spain . 
  he also has a pension plan in luxembourg , due to the friendly fiscal legislation . 
  edit : i do n't know nothing illegal even if it 's not popular or ethic . 
  no serious injuries . 
  i recomend to watch the others that did n't fall . 
  the audio is in catalan . 
  for pretending ( not very well ) that the project was a success . 
  dialog : a : we have flights !!!, 
  this project is a succeess . 
  and * they * called us crazy . 
  b : are n't you paying to the airlines for flying to the airport ? 
  and the airplanes are almost empty . 
  \u00ac \u00ac this was ciudad real ( madrid sud according to some marketing ) the airport built 150 km south of madrid by the regional saving bank of castilla la mancha . 
  top gear used it for their program at spain . 
  it 's completely empty and all the employees have been fired . 
  however , castell\u00f3n 's ghost airport still has employees including a falconer [ currently charged with smuggling of species ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fpolitica.elpais.com%2fpolitica%2f2013%2f07%2f22%2factualidad%2f1374522234_535698.html ) . 
  that without a flight in all its life .

  i read the title . 
  and the article . 
  and maybe the author is also wrong . 
  these guys :  countries in southern europe , which are suffering high unemployment , have been left to face this problem on their own . 
  immigrants are arriving in huge numbers . 
  in the first six months of 2014 around 100,000 undocumented migrants crossed the mediterranean to italy in 2013 there were 42,000 . 
  spain has a very similar problem . 
  thousands have drowned as their makeshift boats have foundered in the mediterranean . 
  these are the sub-saharan . 
  have you seen the boats ? 
  you have this [ shitty article ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2626216/hundreds-immigrants-feared-drowned-italy-libya-says-swamped-human-tide-trying-europe-says-help-unless-gets-aid.html with pictures . 
   the tragedy comes after libya 's interim interior minister salah mazek said the north african country could not cope under the strain of thousands of sub-saharan africans passing through it and you can notice that the racial make up the boat people and libyans is n't exactly the same . 
  it 's sad that even after a civil war libya is more liveable than eritrea . 
  that has had a stable crazy dictatorship 20 years . 
  90 % of the ones coming to spain come through morocco , but they are n't from morocco . 
  they are from senegal , mali and former french sub-saharan colonies mostly . 
  there were some syrian once . 
  i am talking about the boat and fence jumping immigrants . 
  illegal moroccan immigrants often manage to come with tourist visas and overstay , or something less extreme . 
  but , they have n't been a problem lately . 
  then the sub-saharan immigrants are welcome ? 
  are you actually following this crisis ? 
  they are n't north african . 
  the black economy is n't booming . 
  there was more black economy 8 years ago and [ less unemployment ] ( http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/epa_tabla_en.htm ) ( historical series ) . 
  why are there some redditors denying that there is unemployment at spain ? 
  it 's not the first time . 
  ok , we need a referendum in catalonia . 
  gas from the french colonial empire , like spain . 
  the most likely outcome is early elections for that day after the spanish government/constitutional court stop the referendum expected for that same day . 
  nobody feels like giving more power to orban let 's be honest . 
  why ? 
  do you know about him or is due to the name ( if that explain , please ) ? 
  i mean is a shady man that was part of the team did the reforms of the spanish financial and construction sector in the 90s that helped to join the euro and to create biggest bubble in our history . 
  later , when conservatives left the government he went to lehman brothers ended directing their operation in spain and portugal until they went to bankruptcy in 2008 . 
  then he came back to politics managing to become minister in december of 2011 . 
  since then his focus has been : financing public debt , protecting rodrigo rato from prison , giving bailouts to regional saving banks ( looted by rodrigo rato and others ) , taking over the regulators and very erratic cuts without a clear path and doing less liberalizations than the socialists did . 
  he is a perfect fit for a president of the comission that was the pm of a fiscal heaven . 
  i do n't think that would work , the government would simply emit debt to pay the fine .
