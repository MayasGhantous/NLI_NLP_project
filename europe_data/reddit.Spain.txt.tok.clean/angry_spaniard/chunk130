  do n't get confused . 
  the regional government will be paying ryanair . 
  the current ruling party built this airport that opened 4 years ago . 
  they need to justify it a little bit . 
  even if the responsible is already in prison for tax fraud . 
   intimate do you mean intimidate ? 
   the opinion piece does n't back up anything it says , from all i 've seen it seemed that the greek were on track paying back their debt with a third bailout . 
  to start to pay the previous ones . 
  that 's bullshit . 
  just in time for the regional elections in may . 
  i am wondering how much the regional government that owns it is paying . 
  [ the responsible of the airport is in prison for tax fraud ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/02/spain-carlos-fabra-begins-jail-term-ghost-airport )  in its 118-page ruling the court said fabra and his wife had $ 3.3 m in unexplained earnings . 
  but , non-guilty of corruption . 
  he did n't explain legal how he got the money . 
  but nobody else was able either . 
  it is going to be a short prison term because the corruption was n't proved . 
  it 's also exactly in the point were the path from madrid to barcelona and the path from valencia to basque country met . 
  casuality ? 
  the policies of viktor orban are very similar to the ones of franco : from social to economy . 
  the tobacco distribution reform is almost the same that we have at spain since franco used local tobacco distribution monopolies concession to compensate war veterans of his side . 
   would be legally inconceivable i can think about a reform of the treaty making it possible . 
  it would require all the eu governments to agree , but it 's possible . 
  we have a bankruptcy law . 
  but you do n't get a clean start . 
  you stay in the bankruptcy procedure until you pay your debts or your creditors give you a pardon ( and they do n't have any obligation of giving one ) . 
  the bankruptcy procedure is there only to protect part of your income from seizure . 
  but , it does n't remove your debt in fact it can keep growing to a rate of 3 times the government official interest ( the one that the government applies to companies that are delayed in paying debts with the government currently 4 % ) if you are unable to service it . 
  edit : this is one of the reasons why the pah ( mortgage victims platform ) is a thing . 
  its [ former spokeswoman ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ada_colau#barcelona_en_com.c3.b ) is going to be a candidate in barcelona ' municipal elections (, 
   in general terms , i am very surprised that there is space for two insurgent parties within spain . 
  both parties are targeting very different voters . 
  the psoe and the pp are smelling too bad lately . 
  podemos is targeting the center-left and the anti-establishment . 
  ciudadanos is moderate right wing party . 
  and the only party of the 4 that would support free market reforms . 
  the spanish traditional right is not very enthusiastic of free market thing . 
  i find amusing that none of the parties are racist or seriously euroesceptics , the founders of podemos were euroesceptic before . 
  [ pablo iglesias defending leaving the euro in 2013 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h59icqt98fs ) . 
  he also defends capital controls during the process , and says that it wo n't be possible if only one country does it . 
  he ends the video with a * southern europeans , unite !, 
  * edit : a catalonia the libertarian socialist cup that got to the catalan parliament in 2012 with three mp may multiply by three their members of the catalan parliament in case of new elections . 
  and they are pro-open borders . 
  and the mediterranean . 
  sarkozy is a dreadful person and was a dreadful president . 
  i hope that the ump comes with somebody better . 
  all the treasurers of the ruling party charged , but none of the party leaders knew anything !, 
  are you serious judge ruz ? 
  do i have to believe that rajoy did n't know that the envelops with cash that the treasurer gave him were all illegal ? 
  that he did n't know that they were black money to pay the campaign staff including himself and the reform of the party headquarters ? 
  slave wages or slav wages ? 
   yes , i know that you are n't slaves . 
  but ... but ... austerity !, 
  the next thing that you will say is that everybody should live in homes , and those homes should have electricity . 
  if the french right has sarkozy as candidate in the next elections they are asking for trouble .

   seat is the only spanish automobile trademark i know of seat is part of the volkswagen group since ages . 
  the only spanish companies in the sector are the small urovesa ( trucks and special vehicles ) and tauro ( sport cars ) . 
  well and gta spano , but i do n't know if they are real .

  slovenia is out of the top 30 . 
  it is less than half than 10 years ago , but not all . 
  [ check the source ] ( http://www.oica.net/category/production-statistics/ ) . 
  less than australia , and outside the top 30 less than portugal and austria . 
  so sweden is the 33th producer . 
  [ radagast91 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2xwfg5/the_30_countries_were_more_motor_vehicles_were/cp422oo ) found it . 
  [ source ] ( http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2015/03/04/actualidad/1425466359_034852.html ) the article , like the legend is in spanish , it has the flags at least . 
  i ca n't find in a one minute search an article about the 2014 figures in english . 
  greece is going to need a bailout package every two three years to refinance the debt for all the foreseeable future . 
  a future of low growth and low inflation or even deflation . 
  and the structural reasons for that forecast are getting stronger as the population ages and the brain drain and the young people emigration becomes permanent . 
   we do n't need huge fiscal transfers do we need the eurozone to work ? 
   unless you think a country goes from massive primary deficit to relatively large primary surplus with no structural reorganisations . 
  well they did budget cuts , and tax raises . 
  i do n't know if that qualifies as structural reorganizations . 
  many people say that in reddit about their countries . 
   what about if greece used some of its islands as refugee camps if you wanted to do that to my country you would have to make war to it and conquer it . 
  but , greece is in a worse situation so you may have it your way . 
  that never happened , [ the building has eleven elevators ] ( http://www.abc.es/tecnologia/redes/20130816/abci-intempo-rascacielos-ascensor-201308161027.html ) that go to the top in a minute . 
  there were some discussion about the changes that were done ( the building is taller than the first draft and it uses elevators with four engines ) , and it somehow become that rumor . 
  the construction company that built it has gone bankrupt and the building was bought by the government through sareb ( the bad bank that spain created ) . 
  paying an absurdly high price that we will never recover . 
  the hotel is in the same autonomous region , but this is in the province of valencia and metropolitan area of valencia , that building is in benidorm ( province of alicante ) . 
  we have too many scandals for needing made up ones . 
  felipe gonz\u00e1lez , pm by the psoe during 1982-1996 , has called his party to support a minority government of the pp just today . 
  nice timing . 
  not at all , they will probably improve their results . 
  because right voters that voters that voted liberal ( c 's ) will go back to vote pp to make sure that they get a right wing majority even if it is by an openly corrupt party with an openly corrupt leadership .
