   it 's in the very early process of investigation , charges have n't been brought up . 
  and i wonder which charges could be brought up . 
  none with what we know until now . 
   and im sure the ` pablo iglesias started his career as a pawn of iran 's conservative islamic anti-women 's party ' will have some sort of effect . 
  maybe if that becomes the message . 
  however , i have n't heard nothing new . 
  [ he has been quite open about his relationship with hispantv ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjevbe3dl4q ) . 
  maybe this was n't of public knowledge until know and it will change public opinion about pablo iglesias and podemos , but what has been published these days is a sensationalist version of what for me was old news . 
  edit : for example : sham companies . 
  produccions cmi is a real company that has real products like fort apache and la tuerka . 
  iran/hispantv did n't donate money to podemos . 
  they paid the producciones cmi for tv shows like [ fortapache ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/uczoe2gegticsibmloolyswq ) . 
  the money that was paid was higher than the cost of the programs and the leaders of podemos that control the company since before founding podemos used the company to promote left wing politics with more tv shows and acts , paying themselves ( and they donated personally significant amounts money to podemos ) . 
  so , what are the charges ? 
  and the moderate vote does n't care about foreign politics . 
  none , i can only say what 's public . 
  the support to the spanish hard left by iran predates the foundation of podemos , and was given in the context of a conservative government was supporting sanctions to iran , and selling weapons to its enemies . 
  podemos and the united left ( a coalition around the communist party ) defend that spain should end its support of saudi arabia and israel in middle east politics . 
  none of them defend alliances , with iran , but maybe they are happy with their enemies having less allies . 
  [ an article from the last november ] ( http://www.infolibre.es/noticias/politica/2015/11/17/espana_vendio_720_millones_armas_arabia_saudi_catar_kuwait_40930_1012.html ) . 
   spain sold more than 720 million in weapons to saudi arabia , qatar and kuwait in the past three years  ** pablo iglesias ** called on monday to stop spanish exports of weapons to these three countries when asked about ways to curb the islamic state, 
  the spanish conservative party was following a foreign policy quite hostile to iran , supporting the sanctions and others , and very friendly one to saudi arabia . 
  and the spanish hard left was very critic of both things . 
  bonus , picture of the [ kings of saudi arabia and spain ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hxnmchh.jpg ) ( the old spanish king ) . 
  edit : the support to the spanish hard left by iran predates the foundation of podemos, 
  i do n't expect any consequences . 
  legally the spanish law tolerates this type of things . 
  and their followers , at least the most vocal ones seem to be ok with it . 
  the end justifies the means and whatever . 
  he has been open about his relationship with iran fro the beginning , ` [ check this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/41e165/theory_on_possibility_of_spains_leftist_party/cz1ob4y ) . 
  nothing that has surfaced would be illegal financing as is defined in the spanish law . 
  the scheme is similar to the one used by esperanza aguirre with [ fundescam ] ( http://www.europapress.es/nacional/noticia-esperanza-aguirre-dice-totalmente-ridiculo-decir-caso-fundescam-va-acabar-ella-politicamente-20090604124054.html ) . 
  and the money did n't touch the coffers of the party and was not used to pay acts of the party . 
  even if producciones cmi ( con mano izquierda , with left hand ) was/is the same people defending the same policies . 
  yeah , it looks nastier because hispantv is controlled by a foreign government . 
  but the spanish law has few restrictions with the financing of organizations in the environment of the parties that support the same policies . 
  it is like the money that monedero was paid for advice on currency unions from venezuela/alba , absurdly highly paid without public bids and he is not an economist . 
  the only thing that was illegal , is that he was paid directly to a society that did n't even exist when he got the contracts and did n't figure in the contracts . 
  but he was legally allowed to put the money in the environment of the party ( before the party was formally created ) . 
  what you call reward does n't compensate that . 
  destroy your economy and you may get debt reduction ten years later does n't seem so good . 
   `` cheat the system , get rewarded '' greece has lost 25 % of its economy , has over 20 of unemployment 4 years and counting and the economy is still falling such reward . 
  giving more money and powers to an eu agency is impossible with the current poltical situation . 
  to produce political change in spain and to get a more friendly government . 
  [ pablo iglesias talks about his relationship with iran here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=va5nlsxc-ia ) . 
  this is from before founding podemos , that he and his cronies have tv shows about politics ( fort apache , la tuerka ) . 
  [ fort apache was emitted by the iranian channel in spanish , hispantv ] ( http://www.hispantv.com/showprogram/fort-apache/106 ) . 
  note : there is n't any proof of the sponsorship of podemos by iran , but that was probably the reason for supporting left wing tv shows and emitting them in their tv . 
  or for having that tv . 
  remember that spanish is also the second language with more native speakers , so we are n't talking only about spain . 
  honestly i find the quote offensive even when it is understood correctly . 
  it is an insult comparing democratically elected governments with a dictatorship . 
  even about the original quote : francoist spain was occupying catalonia as much as it was occupying madrid . 
  for giving context for / r/europe he is not calling muslim and/or non-white immigrants invaders ( as many users of this subreddit do ) he is calling invader to the spanish government , he is talking about expelling the spanish government of catalonia . 
  and he was quoting a catalan writer that was calling invader of catalonia the francoist government . 
  you need to grasp nationalism . 
  the nation and its independence is more important than concrete policies . 
  getting independence for the nation and sovereignty is more important than getting progressive or left wing policies . 
  i find funny that a party like the cup , ends supporting a classic right wing president , in exchange of a shot of independence and vague promises of more social spending . 
  nationalism has an interesting effect in people . 
  main ideological positions , from wikipedia : catalan independence socialism anti-capitalism environmentalism municipalism libertarian socialism direct democracy euroscepticism pancatalanism edit : the only point that cdc also supports is the first . 
  most euro-sceptics in reddit are far-right ( they prefer to be called patriots , white nationalist or something ), 
  spanish things . 
  most of the price is taxes and the taxes are lower in canary islands . 
  i would n't like to have an apartheid state that denies citizenship to almost half of its subjects and puts them in bantustans . 
  everybody in my family speaks spanish and catalan . 
  but almost nobody speaks anything else . 
   so , to all the spanish redditors here , what type of political coalition do you think would be the best for your country at this moment ? 
   repeating the elections a couple of times , for keeping government mostly paralyzed for a year . 
  only half-kidding , the provisional government is even more terrible than the possible replacements , but it ca n't do a lot of damage for now . 
   i wonder where cs stand on the issue completely against a referendum will vote against any alliance that would allow a referendum . 
  [ they ratified this recently ] ( http://www.abc.es/espana/abci-ciudadanos-no-descarta-abstenerse-ante-pacto-psoe-podemos-si-renuncian-referendum-catalan-201512281052_noticia.html ) pp , psoe and c 's are against self-determination . 
  they have been very clear since forever about this . 
  do you want to move to the mediterranean ? 
  according to my government you are being redundant . 
  * let 's see how polonia ( a catalan tv show about politics ) handles this . 
  they have [ celebrated the result at twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/poloniatv3/status/681197906209148929 ) already . 
  an independent federation covering covering the full [ catalan countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pa\u00efsos_catalans ) ( being those countries all _ countries _ that are or have been catalan speaking ( if you include french catalonia ) . 
  this is as spanish as a movie by jose luis cuerda or berlanga .

  main ideological positions : * catalan independence * socialism * anti-capitalism * environmentalism * municipalism * libertarian socialism * direct democracy * euroscepticism * pancatalanism, 
  it 's probably pointless , you do n't get the feeling of too many tourist everywhere as in barcelona . 
  and you are right . 
  madrid is not a touristic city . 
  government tv : one channel of ruling conservative propaganda and old people stuff . 
  and also masterchef , some us movies ... 
  the median voter of the conservatives is 60 years old . 
  then a 24 hours news channel also pro-government . 
  and another channel with documentaries , classic cinema , some sports , catholic masses on sundays ... take my opinions with a pinch of salt , i do n't watch tv often . 
  against unless we find better population and political class first . 
  honestly you do n't like spain and you do n't think about us as your countrymen . 
  it does a second reading of laws also , but its opinion does n't matter . 
  the congress can ignore all its observations . 
  it has a veto on constitutional reforms , appoints 1/4 of the constitutional court and half of [ judges ' government ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/consejo_general_del_poder_judicial ) . 
  it is an automatic process . 
  catalonia will have to repeat elections also if it is not able to form a government before the 8th of january ( it said september before ) . 
  nobody knows . 
  if it is by political positions pp+psoe are the more similar that add . 
  to 800 euros ( according to one of their electoral manifestos ) , i assume that using the 14 payments bullshit ( that should be scrapped ) , because otherwise the minimum wage is already 756.6 euros , it is 648 euros with the 14 payments . 
  i still disagree .
