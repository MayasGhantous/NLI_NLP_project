  yes , i am not saying that is the most common salary , but it happens . 
  [ or professors and teachers ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20150415/54429939692/cuanto-gana-maestro.html ) . 
  not all the jobs pay the same . 
  i think that the pm should earn more than a high school professor or me , but that is my opinion . 
   three minium salaries as their max for everyone , including the pm i know that everybody is pissed of with the low salaries for the majority of workers , but i feel like that is going too far . 
  a sofware developer with less than 30 years can earn more than that ( just saying ) . 
   ( thus letting pp form a government indeed ) . 
  podemos ( and his coalition allies compromis , icv , anova et all ) + psoe will vota against a minority government and they together will get more mp than pp . 
  so if c 's abstains always that would mean a government of psoe + podemos , if they can agree ( bec has said that they would n't support that government without a referendum of self-determination for catalonia ) . 
  there is no national minimum [ geroa bai ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geroa_bai ) usually gets a mp with less than 1 % of the vote . 
  the polls are published from andorra . 
  publishing polls of the spanish elections in andorra is legal , mentioning them in spain is illegal but it is impossible to enforce it if people is slightly smart , like this . 
  to where ? 
  to where ? 
  honesty i thing that is a bad idea to have schegen without being a member of europol and without justice colaboration . 
  so i think that denmark should leave schegen if it is leaving europol . 
  catalonia is n't closer to independence than 4 years ago . 
  me too , but if catalonia wanted independence actually they are n't going to get it with demonstrations and votes . 
  and it has n't gone anywhere . 
  except keeping artur mas as president instead of oriol junqueras . 
   do they really think they can be self-sufficient country without spain ? 
  only 10 of th 72 mp that supported the declaration want that . 
  the other 62 want independence being directly a member of the nato , eu , oecd ...  also what with this so desired independence ? 
  nationalism . 
  so much in common with [ his _ former _ hero ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyjlr2l39r0 ) .

  if you think that terrorism is a good tool for supporting your agenda you should n't be allowed in a civilazed society . 
  they have to be many to keep up with so many accounts and commenting , sending news and voting so much . 
   as the far-right brigade do you mean the majority regular user base since more than half a year ? 
  another tasteless prison-lunch eater here !, 
  and he also probably thinks that there are too many immigrants born at germany ( read germans with turkish ancestry ) , i have read some comments about the excessive number of 1st and 2nd generation immigrants in germany at this subreddit . 
  remember that most / r/europe users are right wing nationalist that do n't want immigration from other eu countries to their countries either . 
   you were convinced by random people on the internet that the eu is to blame for the refugee crisis and not the national governments no . 
  i do n't think so . 
  i was convinced that the eu ca n't work without a democratic mandate and if the youngest and english-speaking europeans are so strongly nationalist and eurosceptic the eu ca n't work in the long run . 
  and the opinions about migration between eu countries are also interesting . 
  this subreddit convinced me that the eu is a bad idea . 
  and i do n't mean the news i mean the users . 
  and schegen of course . 
   probably because the irish can sympathize with being a migrant given our economic history . 
  we had a right wing nationalist dictator in power . 
  0.001 / 10 would try again . 
  also : the countries that have social hostilty to immigrations have it also in good times . 
  what makes so hard to build houses at uk and sweden ? 
  at spain building whatever you want is very easy and [ it had effects ] ( http://topspanishhomes.com/blogs/some-facts-about-spanish-housing-bubble ) :  each year almost a million homes was built in spain , more than more than in germany , france and england altogether . 
  you may want to check the meaning of middle class . 
  spain had massive immigration during the bubble years , a net immigration of four millions of people in ten years , mostly young and with children now . 
  even with immigrants with around 30 % of unemployment and the locals with 20 % the society remained very stable and the crime rate very low ( whatever media wants to say ) , the 80s with the drug problems and the local gypsies being really dangerous were way worse . 
  and the most voted far right parties are bellow 0.1 % of the vote . 
  maybe it does n't decide completely the elections but the most voted party in aragon has been the most voted party in all the spanish general elections . 
  there are bad leaders like mariano rajoy and clownish bad leaders like silvio berlusconi and donald trump . 
  honestly i think that george w. bush is a member of the first category . 
  i wonder if there are clownish good leaders . 
  he could do for usa what berlusconi did for italy , if you know what i mean . 
  fucking tax haven !, 
  being able to get ride of employees that are n't profitable to keep without problems is something that actually attracts investment . 
  the official name of the position of head of the spanish government is `` presidente del consejo de ministros '' , usualy simply called * presidente * even if he is a primer minister . 
  you do n't need so many employed people to have a working society if the country is developed enough and has strong family networks . 
  even if you do n't have a job you may have benefits and/or family network . 
  my cousin husband is jobless from more than 4 years the all the companies in the industry where he worked imploded ( maybe he has picked oranges some times ) . 
  and they are ok , she has a job as school teacher and the grandparents give them money once in a while . 
  they are paying their mortgage , bought a * new * ( three years old ) car and they have two children . 
  i have also an uncle that had to back to the grandparents , but that was something that can probably happen in more normal economies . 
  losing job , let 's create a company in the same depressed sector , followed business bankruptcy , also a divorce around that point losing everything that he had in total , followed by long depression leaving him completely unemployable ( according to the public unemployment service ) and without any assets or savings . 
  currently in his 50s without benefits , without access to employment access programs and living with the grandparents . 
  at least they have somebody with them now that they are starting to get really old and he seems to be better emotionally lately . 
  the people that has it worse are immigrants and people without family around . 
  and that 's why the country is divided in 17 autonomous regions and 2 autonomous cities ( ceuta and melilla ) . 
  every region has its own constitution ; parliament ( one chamber ) and handles health care , education ( from primary school to universities ) , most environment , roads , public transport , ( catalonia and basque country have their own police forces ) ... look at [ the figures of public servants by government ] ( http://blogs.elpais.com/.a/6a00d8341bfb1653ef016768bbd877970b-pi ) . 
  slightly over half at autonomous community ( comunidades autonomas in the table ) level . 
  so they have powers the funcionarios are the ones with a tenure one of the highest percentages in europe , by the way . 
  the current system is a compromise between a centralized state and a federal achieved during the transition to democracy . 
  the main difference is that the spanish parliament has to approved the regional constitutions by absolute majority . 
   maybe the us could be a model ? 
  i do n't know how big of an improvement it would be . 
  you always find funny bits at spain , that are always hard to accomodate . 
  for example at the plains of valencia instead of using the modern water resources confederations used at most of spain for deciding about disputes about the usage of water we have a [ court operating since islamic times at least ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/water_tribunal_of_the_plain_of_valencia ) . 
   well , accept that the cataolonains are a people different from spain but or that 's not true , or there are at least a dozens of peoples inside spain ( already recognized ) . 
  there are many peoples at spain and all are types of spanish people : galicians , leonese ( the ones from `` el bierzo '' being culturally special ) , basque , aragonese , catalan ( being the aranese special ) , castilian ( having significant subcultures in areas like la mancha ) , asturian , andalusian , valencian , balearic islands , canary islands ( having special differences every island specially la gomera with their [ silbo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silbo_gomero ) ) . 
  i am from the valencia ( city and region ) and i am a native speaker catalan ( like many others ) and the language is also official in this community , and there are also many in balearic islands . 
  there is many people in galicia speaking galician and basque at the basque country . 
  and some speaking aragonese and asturian in their respective areas . 
  let 's not pretend that there is a uniform spain and a uniform catalonia because it is simply not true . 
  i remember seeing the figures of productivity growth that venezuela was pulling from 1998 to 2012 , and they were n't rigged . 
  they simply were getting 14 dollars from a barrel in 1998 and $ 100 at 2012 . 
  therefore , if x workers extract the same y oil barrels in an hour in both years : the productivity measured in dollars per hour with exactly the same workers producing exactly the same oil changes varies a lot . 
  and * '' [ about a quarter of our gdp is related to oil and gas extraction ] ( http://www.norges-bank.no/en/published/speeches/2015/27032015-olsen-new-york/ ) '' . 
  * so it should affect a little bit . 
  even if that oil and gas is not 100 % dependant of oil prices . 
   just give them nation status with own rights ( cf. 
  scotland ) , what does that means ? 
  what would they get that they do n't have already ? 
   do n't be so greedy on the taxation the taxation in catalonia is as greedy as in the rest of spain , except basque country and navarre . 
  the fact that those got a privileged status , puts spain in a bad situation with catalonia . 
  basque country and navarre have also a corporate tax two points lower than the rest of spain ( whatever is the one at the rest of spain , they have always followed ) . 
  from the [ basque fiscal agreement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basque_economic_agreement#third_stage:_1981.e2.80.932009._the_present-day_agreement ) :  `` d ) the contribution of the basque country to the state will consist in a global quota , made up of those corresponding to each of the territories , as a contribution to all of the costs of the state that are not assumed by the autonomous community '' . 
  that is to say , the conception of the quota changed from the traditional conception of the hypothetical income of the treasury , to payment of state expenditure on costs not assumed by the autonomous community . 
  so they do n't even contribute to [ solidarity funds of the spanish government for poor regions ] ( http://www.seap.minhap.gob.es/web/areas/politica_autonomica/info_basica/4asecorelcol/fci/fci_func.html ) and they can keep the higher corporate tax income . 
  spain needs to fix its fiscal model , but it is almost impossible for political reasons . 
  i mean andalusia and extremadura would be completely unable to offer universal single payer health care , public universities and others if spain generalizes the basque agreement .
