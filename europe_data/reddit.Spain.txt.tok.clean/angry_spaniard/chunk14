  finning somebody with excessive debt , it 's only going to increase the debt . 
  you need to punish the politicians , not the population . 
  too many politicians do n't care about fines if they are paid by the public administrations . 
  switzerland they want to hide the corruption money of both sides . 
  that 's truly neutral . 
   actual consequences when a country breeches the terms of the maastricht treaty . 
  such as ? 
   an ex-kgb man who more or less openly tries to restore the sovjet union . 
  let 's call it russian empire , it was called soviet union during a while but let 's be honest about what it was . 
  it was a communist version of the russian empire of before minus finland and parts of poland ( and the baltics , moldova , and some bits of ukraine and belarus before wwii ) . 
  should we take over the citizenship of these guys ? 
  i mean they are fighting for the enemy . 
  if you think that it 's right, 
   today large amounts of immigrants are third generation interesting definition of immigrant . 
  maybe the problems is how europe is dealing with immigration , chinese immigrants are n't integrating either even if they do n't turn terrorist . 
  ok , enjoy our lehman brothers gift !, 
  it 's funny that i said exactly the opposite for spain ( not in reddit ) just some moments ago . 
  i am tired of the government with absolute majority ruling with emergency royal orders . 
  politics should require colaboration . 
  could apply to the french foreign legion ? 
  they are in some deep shit in the ^ ^ former french colonial empire that would qualify as war . 
  however , this is spain they can keep doing business during 5 years before a court tell them to stop . 
  relevant bits :  surprisingly , uber decided to operate in spain with uberpop format  uber outside spain offers chauffeured vehicles ( vtcs ) and taxis interchangeably . 
  you can see it in chicago , for example . 
  if uber offers the services of companies that rent vehicles with drivers ( vtc ) is not doing anything against the law . 
  a vtc competes with a taxi that hiring is prior to the service , users can not pick up at stops and on public roads if there is no prior contract ( call / internet ) . 
  the contract involves agreeing a collection point and another descent and conditions . 
  uberpop , i believe , allows individuals to hire the services of a transport provider . 
  if the provider does not have vtc taxi license or conduct shall be punishable as very serious ( 197 rott ) they are only offering the service that is obviously illegal according to the spanish legislation . 
  however , they have a service in other countries that would be legal . 
  people paid close to half million euros for taxi licenses , because there are few and the government does n't create more . 
  the taxi licenses are perpetual and privately owned and the titular can sell it and if they retire when they sell it all the money that they got for the license is tax free . 
  the system is a mess and it should change , but you can not legalize uber before fixing it . 
  remember : everything is complicated at spain . 
  [ catalonia 's anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-bdn3zih2w ) : the reapers . 
  tldr : catalonia will rise again ( and will be rich ) with a good blow of the sickle . 
  pump more oil . 
  if that counts for something . 
  :d she is a second degree cousin of [ noem\u00ed sam\u00edn ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noem%c3%ad_san%c3%adn ), 
  it 's a woman . 
  you forgot the the guy that since new democracy got back to power says that greece is recovering . 
  greece has lost 9 of its gdp since i heard that neutral opinion the first . 
  if makes somebody feel better the previous spanish pm denied that spain was having serious problems until the unemployement was over 15 % . 
  do n't be silly . 
  [ ceuta and melilla are in the eu !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ceuta#politics )  ceuta is part of the territory of the european union . 
  the city was a free port before spain joined the european union in 1986 . 
  now it has a low-tax system within the european monetary system . 
  as of 2006 , its population was 75,861 . 
  and melilla the same . 
  that happened to british people in britain . 
  it seems like something that should be solved in britain . 
  first time that i hear about both things . 
  am i western ? 
  it does n't get more western in europe than portugal and spain !, 
  there is no chance that uk 's oversea fiscal heavens get incorporated in the eu . 
  fix that . 
  it 's still a dictatorship . 
  you are creating them !, 
  most of the people we are talking about have born and have in raised in uk . 
  why should other countries have to deal with them ? 
  and the other minorities are integrated ? 
  i am not talking about that . 
  but what you are doing is not working . 
  in fact britain is creating more islamic radicals than morocco . 
  and i care about that . 
  edit : i do n't talk about what 's morally or whatever better i am talking about results and uk results are really bad , probably the worse . 
  just saying from turkey to morocco , to algeria with more muslims there are less yihadist . 
  i am going to blame the uk for it 's way treating the immigrants and the british people of immigrant parents . 
   nonsense , other immigrants do n't cause such problems , only muslims do but they are n't integrated . 
  i would like to say francisco franco , but he is still seen as a needed thing by part of the right . 
  from the subreddit that should not be linked . 
  back then scania was part of denmark . 
  were n't many of those vikings from there ? 
  we should put some oppresed spanish population at gibraltar while you are distracted . 
  you can also join russia , do you want some local self-defense forces ? 
  switzerland is missing all the gold . 
  islamic state is not a state . 
  that does n't apply . 
  university education is not a social service . 
  i think that specialized education is not considered part of the basic services . 
  what part of africa ? 
  they are n't from the mediterranean countries that they came directly and you can not force them to take illegal immigrants . 
  spain once fleets an aircraft to senegal and countries like that with the ones that can be deported according to law . 
  spain has an agreement that allows to send to morocco some immigrants caught in ceuta and melilla , but we have to pay to them . 
  spanish too . 
  it may be the lack of a significant jew minority . 
  and there is also certainly mobilized left that would protest against crimes humanity committed by usa or their allies . 
  i do n't know why is different in other countries , but these are my two cents . 
  ** spain ** not a lot . 
  * the industry ministry has authorised repsol to make soundings off the canary islands .

  yes , my government is going to [ bailout the toll roads ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/03/26/inenglish/1395835284_329391.html ) to nowhere soon . 
  it will be paid with more austerity as is tradition . 
  the details of details of the bailout have been under negotiation the last months . 
  the final agreement has to be signed before the end of this month .
