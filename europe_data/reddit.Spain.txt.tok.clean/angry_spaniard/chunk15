   wnd again in case of costs , the calculated price for the tunnel would be 2 billion eur why would be it so cheap comparing with the [ channel tunnel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/channel_tunnel#construction ), 
  and let 's be honest . 
  is there enough population and economy around to justify the project ? 
  if it 's done is for political reasons , because an investment like that would n't be recovered in our lifetimes . 
  the purchasing power of the median citizen has n't been on free fall the last 7 years in our countries , you should know . 
  about the one at otxarkoaga ( district of bilbao , spain ) was put there in with a [ right wing nationalist mayor ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ayuntamiento_de_bilbao ) ( bilbao has been ruled by the pnv all the democracy ) by an abertzale ( * patriotic * ) left group . 
  the statue was in the soviet embassy until it become the russian embassy . 
  when the russian embassy retired it the group proposed to put the statue in a park in bilbao and the mayor ( that leaded a minority government accepted ) . 
  off-topic : you have to admire they ruled bilbao 32 years of stable governments in minority without doing any concession that they had applying ther right wing policies with the support of the pp and their nationalist policies with the support of the pro-independence left . 
  and not only at the city , the same at the regional government . 
  and the pp was founded by a francoist minister and at the beginning was very dictatorship nostalgic , and the abertzale left had connections with eta . 
  some times had to do weird concessions ( why you want to put a lenin statue ? 
  do i have to pay something ? 
  whatever if i can keep the office with that ... ) , but bilbao has been one the best managed cities at spain . 
  no , that 's the [ ghost airport of ciudad real ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ciudad_real_central_airport ) . 
  however , that airport had flights ( paying a fortune to the airlines to move almost empty planes ) and was property of a regional saving bank that ended bankrupt . 
  castellon 's airport has never seen an airplane . 
  most of the austerity happened more than 2 years ago . 
  now we are with an expansive economic policy : giving more bailouts to banks , buying bankrupted private highways owned by the usual cronies , cutting corporate tax ... and with a 7 % deficit . 
  one week seafood paella , another week meat paella here . 
  well , when i lived with my parents . 
  however , i am from valencia . 
  western ireland is the part with the worst economy . 
  everybody invest in eastern ireland/dublin . 
  it 's not one of the core ingredients , but it works with the meat version . 
  you can also add artichoke to it . 
  if you add snails and artichoke , i would remove rabbit . 
  i do n't like to have too many ingredients . 
  edit : there are many ways of making a paella work . 
  but never put beef , pepper , marinaded meat , mix seafood and meat ... 
  paella is cooked with small variations at ingredients in different parts of valencia , already . 
  and nowadays you can find the basic ingredients all over spain : * meat version : chicken , rabbit , judias verdes anchas ( wide green beans ) , tomato . 
  and the other ingredients in the standard version are easy : saffron ( or the saffron dye ) , rosemary , garlic , sweet paprika , butter beans ( garrof\u00f3n ) can be replaced by other white beans ( tavella is used at some areas ) ... * seafood : cuttlefish ( i had to look for sepia ) , prawns , green beans , mussel , and some little fish for giving taste to the soup to cook it ( but you can use dehydrated cubes i do it often ) you are probably right . 
  i have n't seen any * foraster * do it correctly . 
  i do n't know why , i have done paella right outside valencia with ingredents bought at mercadona . 
  forasters , you even screw the basic ingredients . 
  :( in addition , gazpacho is from southern spain . 
  and there were other regional dishes called gazpacho : [ gazpacho manchego ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/gazpachos_manchegos ) . 
  spanish also . 
  can you link their official subreddit ? 
  this only means that poland has passed spain . 
  per capita data is better . 
  an article [ where an oppsitton deputy calls him for his political connections ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.elmundo.es%2fcomunidad-valenciana%2f2014%2f08%2f06%2f53e23e6d268e3ef43c8b4598.html&amp;edit-text= ) . 
  these declarations were made after calatrava was charged for the [ irregularities on the construction of a convention center in castellon ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.elmundo.es%2fcomunidad-valenciana%2f2014%2f08%2f06%2f53e2185b268e3ef43c8b457c.html&amp;edit-text= ) . 
   why mix politics and art ? 
  because all his big , expensive and crazy projects have been contracted by politicians of the pp . 
  and a lot of irregularities and corruption have been going on his projects for public administrations . 
  however , i admit that he has n't convicted for any of the corruption cases . 
  he has been fined for some negligences on some projects and he has been paid by public administrations through his society on switzerland to avoid taxes , but there is n't anything criminal on that . 
  i think that [ this ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=spain&amp;country2=portugal ) is mostly accurate . 
  i think that [ latvia has the record ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_latvia ) . 
   but in fact if companies get all the vat they 've paid refunded , only companies that sell electricity ( and other high-vat goods or services ) will be inconvenienced . 
  that 's capped to the amount of vat that your clients pay , you ca n't get back more than that ( spain at least ) . 
  for many farmers is a * problem * ( they do n't get all the vat that ) because they pay 21 % vat for everything and they sell fresh food with a vat of 4 % . 
  edit : however , we have an alternative system called objective estimation , that allows some self-employed people ( like taxi license owners ) to pay almost no taxes , and keep part of the vat for themselves while other self-employed people pay more taxes than profit have ( mandatory self-employment social security contribution included ) . 
  you should remember where is the average . 
  you could have drunk clown as pm and be better governed than average . 
  [ one article ] ( http://viewfrommadrid.blogspot.se/2014/01/calatrava-update-heads-up-for-falling.html ) about some of the problems of the city of the arts and the sciences ) . 
  and this megalomaniac project has cost 1.4 billions of euros plus exhibitions and maintenance . 
  it includes the biggest imax cinema of spain , the biggest aquarium of europe , a stupid opera house with bad acoustics and not good visibility of the scenario , a park , an science museum ... and calatrava 's as architect got paid $ 70 millions ( for him and his team ) . 
  he is the architect of the conservative party . 
  he also designed [ this monster for oviedo ] ( http://leolo.blogspirit.com/media/00/02/979836193.jpg ) it 's nice and except the opera everything fulfills the requirements . 
  but it 's so bloody expensive to maintain . 
  i hope that we ( valencian ) change the regional government after the new elections and the new government let 's it fall apart . 
  edit : do you see the stairs of the museum ( near the building that seems an eye ) . 
  they were added at the last minute when the building was almost done because the architects forgot the emergency exits . 
  disclaimer : spaniard . 
  they are paid better than the entry level/young people in the career , but less than the people close to retirement . 
  you can see some [ salary information for medical doctors in the eu ] ( http://www.redaccionmedica.com/contenido/images/salarios_medicos_hospitalarios.pdf ) , the tables have the name of the countries in english . 
  this data is for the public health care , 2011 figures ( the salaries have been cut slighly since that ) . 
  spain only ( i do n't know the portuguese system ) : future retirees wo n't be able to get maximum pensions almost never ( at least at spain ) because more the cotization base of more years will be included for calculate the pension ( 25 years from 15 ) . 
  and almost nobody gets to a level that qualifys for a maximum pension 25 years before retiring . 
  however this wo n't concern to people retired before the reforms . 
   ca n't be serious . 
  800/month ? 
  talking about spain the entry level for software engineer with some brains and english is 1,500 euros/month before taxes at valencia . 
  and around 2,000 euros/month at barcelona ( the rest of catalonia is at the lower threshold ) , basque country and madrid . 
  and lower at southern spain . 
  it goes to 1,200 euros/month at extremadura and andalusia . 
  that 's before taxes , people tells his income after taxes often ( / u/justgohomealready may be doing ) . 
  but the salaries at portugal are the lowest in western europe . 
  if you are thinking about moving to be a software developer in europe you will be better off at romania than portugal or spain . 
  however , the things that he says about the public servants being mostly true need to be taken with a grain of salt . 
  * that pension is the maximum pension paid by the government ( similar to the spanish one ) to non-politicians . 
  reserved for university tenured professors doctors . . and people at the the highest possitions of the public services . 
  many public servant retirees are paid less . 
  the ones with high salaries get high pensions , the ones with low salaries get low pensions . 
  and they have seen pension freezes and stuff , but way less that the current workers or jobless . 
  being at portugal i got the feeling that the cost of living is similar to the spanish one . 
  the lower cost of some stuff compensated by the higher taxes and the co-payments . 
  if you go for food and clothes to the catholic church you may be able to afford your other expenses with that minimum wage . 
   by no longer drawing unemployment benefits but , [ most of jobless do n't get unempleyoment benefits at spain ] ( http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/en/news/nations/spain/2014/05/13/spain-4-million-jobless-lack-unemployment-benefits_a23f4279-2a14-4bdd-8fea-0b600ebd56f9.html ) ( and portugal as far as i know ) . 
  some people gets other benefits . 
  250,000 are in training programs that pay them an income of 400 to 450 euros . 
  and another 250,000 colect some other type of benefit . 
  if you have first degree relatives ( parents or children ) , spouse or flatmates that including you in their househould keep an average income above minimum wage you do n't get benefits after unemployment expires . 
  the welfare is n't the same in all europe . 
  there is a convincing excuse for that . 
  shitty populism ; the economic program seems written by juan carlos monedero or a 5 years old , and i fear that is the first . 
  does n't try to fix the underlying issues in out institutional framework , in fact it opposes to independent regulators and proposes to put the ecb under more control of the eu parliament .
