  the proposal of basic income is incredibly expensive , let 's not talk about the earlier retirement age that spain ca n't pay . 
  and it 's also anti-transgenic . 
  the economic and social agendas would destroy the country . 
  i see 2 options if they pretend to fulfill their electoral program they are dangerously stupid , if they do n't they ca n't be trusted . 
  however , i want to see organized the pp and psoe out of government and they are also going to destroy the country anyway . 
  however , it 's very likely that i am going to vote to compromis ( i am valencian ) , if we ignore the nationalism is more similar to my way of thinking . 
  tldr : i do n't like them even if may vote to them . 
  i talked about [ the issues that spain actually have with gibraltar ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2d4ji3/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_10082014/cjm7asi?context=3 ) . 
  and the tobacco smuggling and the money laundering are becoming more significant the deeper in debt we become , the bigger becomes the tax evasion/elusion and collaboration with organized crime and political corruption . 
  and they stopped at 2011 , but [ it gets worse ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_portugal#vital_statistics_since_1900 ) . 
  the population and the political framework . 
  they can but it 's not likely . 
  psoe is more likely to join pp than to podemos . 
  the more likely outcome is coalitions of the two traditional big parties like in germany or greece . 
  and podemos has said many times that they want to rule and win but if they are n't able to rule by themselves and similar minded parties they prefer to stay in opposition that to reach agreements with the ruling * caste * ( understood as pp , psoe and traditional nationalist ciu , pnv , cc , prc , par ) . 
  he has n't been caught whoring , building a hunting lodge for the money for preservation of his historical patrimony , reforming the house of his mistress with public funds ( under advice of the secret service to improve the security of a place where the king spent so much time ) , or hunting drunk with businessmen currently in prison for now . 
  that means an improvement over his father . 
  he has been trying to get involved in the catalan question ( he has even learned some catalan ) , but nobody seems to listen him . 
  a mixture of hostility and indiference . 
  and i am excluding the minority that actually wants to get gibraltar as part of spain . 
  most of the time we do n't think about gibraltar , but when we do we think about it is due to one of this reasons : * one of the fiscal heavens of the uk where our political class and businessmen laundry their illegal income and avoid taxes . 
  * tobocco smuggling : 100 millions cigarretes cross the border to gibraltar legally from spain . 
  then 99 % are sold to spaniards that cross the border to gibraltar legally , but cross back without declaring having bought any tobacco . 
  and it 's not only private consumers ( and probably not even the majority ) many bars that are authorized to sell tobacco get tobacco from this channel . 
  * thanks to friendly tax rates , it has attracted many business that use gibraltar for fiscal reasons . 
  * they are helping the online gambling industry to be opaque and tax free . 
  [ nytimes ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/03/business/global/british-gambling-tax-plan-annoys-many-in-gibraltar.html?_r=0 ) * they have started to forbide spanish fisherman to fish in their territorial waters . 
  however , they would be open to reach an agreement . 
  but that 's not going to happen because the spanish government sees it as recognizing that gibraltar has territorial waters . 
  * many ships perform bunkering in these territorial waters to avoid the spanish taxes for fuel and the environment regulations . 
  resulting in missing taxes for spain and pollution because the operation are n't performed with the due to precautions . 
  and these are only the more points arised recently . 
   monarchs can serve as good political unifying figures it does n't work at spain . 
  ** spain ** ** politics ** * podemos ( the new left wing party ) is polling at around 15 % of the votes . 
  the psoe ( traditional center left ) it 's at 20 % . 
  pp does n't go bellow 30 % whatever they do .

  [ en ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/20140808/judge-stops-madrid-mayor-from-evicting-185-families ) * * they still qualify for social housing but this raises a point for me : only 1 % of the people that qualify for social housing get it . 
  * * spaniards think that unemployment is the first problem of spain followed by corruption and the economy the third .

  how many tax heavens do you need ? 
  they should be in the least favourite section anyway . 
  even if they are n't so bad they a fiscal heaven and many politician ( pujol recently ) hide there the money that steal . 
  * spain * * least favourite : * it 's hard to decide morocco ( we have a land border , ceuta and melilla are part of mainline spain ) , france ( would you even stop knocking over fruit trucks !? ), 
  or the fiscal heaven to the south that the government uses to fool the people ... * favourite * : portugal , by elimination . 
  but these guys were at kindergarten ( 22 and 27 years old ) when the soviet union fell . 
  the one from murcia is from an actual [ communist party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_party_of_the_peoples_of_spain ) . 
  the other one is the more catch all [ united left ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_left_ ( spain % 29 ) . 
  the first one can be expected anyway . 
  anyway for the spanish * anticapitalist * left the references are venezuela and cuba .

  your media mogul also has [ an antena 3 ] ( http://www.antena3.com/ ) !, 
  i am going to ask for some money in exchange of looking to the other way . 
  i am going to quote [ myself ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2c502p/spanish_soldier_who_penned_a_bestselling_novel/cjc77xt?context=3 ) some days ago . 
   the army is corrupt , despotic , full of drunks , half of the mules that bring drugs from morocco are military sent to ceuta and melilla ... the spanish military is no very respected . 
  and it seems the thing is n't going on only with morocco and weed only . 
  you are right . 
  it depends of how you twist the definition . 
  andalusia has the highest unemployment rate , but the gdp per capita is higher . 
  any advice to them ? 
  they are a union , there is a [ friendly party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collective_for_the_unity_of_workers_%e2%80%93_andalusian_left_bloc ) that currently rules marinadela in coalition with the pce and others as part of iu ( united left ) . 
  if we go to the aftermatch the union is a failure . 
  the salaries of the workers that represent are in free fall , and their unemployment is skyrocketing ( due to a mixture of automation and competition of morocco in the farming sector ) , and the government has cut the welfare for them . 
  but , they have don more actions : * [ dignity parades ] ( https://es-es.facebook.com/sindicatosat/photos/a.10151298490168296.512851.145631348295/10152681830653296/?type=1&amp;theater ) with the motto : bread , jobs and homes for everybody . 
  * [ they squatted a abandoned estate ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/03/07/inenglish/1362688641_939016.html ) twice , the estatewas used for raising horses for the army . 
  they claims that the government should give it to jobless farm day laborers ( the bulk of the union ) . 
  the estate 2 years after the conflict started is abandoned still and the government is not even trying to sell it . 
  * they did the same to the andalusian government . 
  and the andalusian government ended giving them the [ farm land ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2012/07/08/inenglish/1341754799_139657.html ) * the robbing school material and giving it to whoever asked for it . 
  it was like 2,000 euros . 
  it should be understood as way of asking to the government for paying it . 
  it was actually effective , the government listens more to an angry multinational that has been robbed 2,000 euros by a mob , that to the same mob demonstrating and collecting signatures during months asking the government to recover the subsidies for school material por poor people ( they got austerity ) . 
  since 2007 when the union of farm workers became the andalusian workers union ( because they decided to spread to more sectors ) , the situation of their members has become worse ; but the unemployment at andalusia has gone from 13 % to 36 % . 
  [ spain already produces too much energy ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ttdx3/too_much_gas_for_so_scarce_energy_demand_in_spain/ ) ( for our economy + what we are able to export , because france is never going to accept becomming a net importer of electricity ) . 
  we are spending billions in capacity payments to the companies that run the unneeded power plants ( casually these companies have in their payroll felipe gonz\u00e1lez y jose mar\u00eda aznar ) . 
  my personal advice to the uk is : ignore them . 
  they will demonstrate and leave , some of them may think about doing a sit-in . 
  but , you can keep ignoring them unless they generate some type of problem . 
   though i would n't read too much into the article , it does n't look legit . 
  but , it 's .
