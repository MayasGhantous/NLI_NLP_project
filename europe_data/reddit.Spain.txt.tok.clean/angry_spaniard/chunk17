  [ they also squatted a government estate that they want to get for jobless members of the union ] ( http://www.cronica21.org/en/project/farm-workers-movement ) remember , it 's a union of the poorest social group of the poorest region of spain . 
  do you know that this a mostly farm workers union ( stopped being farm day laborers only at 2007 ) seeking media presence mostly ? 
  what 's the point of going if nobody knows ? 
  it 's a union of the poorest social group of the poorest region of spain . 
  then who is going to pay education , health care and the roads ? 
  vat to fresh food and electricity ? 
  somebody noticed that i am valencian . 
   alfafar : mostly working class , without really bad areas . 
  ikea valencia is located there as some commercial areas . 
  it 's bigger and has very good and bad areas : * mas camarena : nice residential area . 
  * terramelar : urban and recently de ( some half empty buildings that are being sold very cheap ) . 
  * la coma : [ gypsy ghetto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg3euhyknoe ) * core paterna : ok . 
  it depends about what are you looking for . 
  between the two options i like more paterna if you are n't close to * la coma * . 
  good leisure commecial areas and stuff close , and well connected to the city . 
  what are you thinking about this/what are you looking for ? 
  and where are you from ? 
  edit : maybe we should talk about this with private messages . 
  if you do n't want to give personal information . 
  \\ - the chaos or us !!, 
  \\ - the chaos !!, 
  the chaos !!, 
  \\ - whatever , we are also the chaos . 
   unless they 're all in the same `` gang '' and share their corruption income that 's what happening in valencia and andalusia . 
  one thing to remember in spain is that the regional governments almost never change of gang/party . 
  and except united left ( the irony ) all the parties have strong cohesion and discipline . 
  * andalusia has been ruled all the democracy by the social-democratic psoe . 
  * the basque coutry has been ruled by the consevative nationalist pnv 34 of the 37 years of self-government . 
  * galicia the same with spanish conservative pp . 
  * madrid and valencia 20 years in a row of conservatives . 
  before 12 years of psoe . 
  * castilla-la mancha and extremadura are having their first regional pp government after 28 years of psoe . 
  * castilla-leon and la rioja have been conservative the last 28 years . 
  * catalonia 23 years of liberal-conservative ciu ( coalition of cdc and udc ) ; 6 years of coalition of psoe , pro-independence left erc and the eco-socialist icv and ciu is back since that . 
  * canary islands : the dominant party is canarian ~ ~ corruption ~ ~ coalition , but always in coalition with pp or psoe . 
  * asturies : 5 years conservative ; 27 social-democratic . 
  he has confesed that commited tax fraud ( at least ) from the first year that he was elected . 
  jaume matas , that went to prison this week , looted balearic islands in only 4 years , at an amazing level . 
  and eduardo zaplana that i mentioned in my ampliation looted my region during 7 years . 
  jordi pujol , government was a lot of low profile corruption during many years . 
  other regions ( including mine valencia ) had very high profile corruption . 
  however , i admite that low profile corruption ( small irregularities in normal contracts , some exceptions to zoning laws in exchange of hiring a relative as advisors , cultural subsidies at the service of the party , irregularities in the usage of the institutional advertising funds , and the same in tourism promotion ... ) is harder to fight that fuckers like the ones in valencia that build a ghost airport , a highway to a village in the middle of nowhere , ghost cinema studio ( ciudad de la luz ) , a crazy museum city ( ciudad de las artes y las ciencias ) ... and that with short governments : eduardo zaplana ( 1995-2002 ) , jose luis olivas ( 2002-2003 ) , francisco camps ( 2003-2011 ) ... do you think that term limitations should be introduced ? 
  andalusia has a bigger problem of low profile corruption , and has had 3 presidents in the last two term ( from the same party ) , the elected president ended fleeing to the senate because senators can only be judged by the supreme court , and the regional governments can designate some senators ; the supreme court is controlled by the government that is protecting them . 
  the problems came from things more complicated to change than too long terms . 
  yes , you 're right . 
   `` i love my kids murdered in gaza '' querer means want and love in spanish . 
  love is the right translation in this context . 
  she was calling the children that have been murdered in gaza her children . 
  it 's a rethoric figure . 
  do n't trust a catalan translating spanish . 
   b **** should be w **** , for whore , just saying . 
  puta means whore . 
  edit : i know that it comes from the article . 
  you forgot more corruption : * the anti-corruption prosecutor is investigating the tomato throwing festival in bu\u00f1ol . 
  [ en ] ( http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news-spain/valencia2/the_anti-corruption_prosecutor_is_investigating_the_tomato_throwing_fiesta_in_bu_ol.shtml ) * the terra mitica case in the valencia region is reaching its end . 
  the theme park built with public funds had a final cost of 400 million $ and was sold a decade later for 65 million , but it was with a complex scheme of fake facturas , probable the second figure is closer to the actual cost , but the first is what was paid . 
  * eduardo zaplana is not going to be charged , is definitive , only the two directors of the park from the public adminstration * . 
  [ en ] ( http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news-spain/blanca/the_forgotten_case_of_terra_m_tica.shtml ) * the former president of the ourense provincial government and parent of the current one , jos\u00e9 luis baltar , has been handed down nine years of disqualification for holding public offices . 
  he signed 104 work contracts in three months , between january and march 2010 , without the position being advertised and was charged with continuing prevarication . 
  * that happened during the internal elections of the conservative party for the provincial leadership , and the people hired were key ruling party members for these elections * . 
  [ en ] ( http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news-spain/galicia/the_president_of_the_ourense_provincial_government_jos_luis_baltar_has_been_handed_down_nine_years_of_disqualification.shtml ) and we still could add some more . 
  :( other news : * a [ strike in the trains ] ( http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news-spain/national/spanish_railway_strike_starts_today.shtml ) . 
  * i do n't know if the traditional transport strikes on turistic season qualify as news . 
  * * medical negligence alleged after a 23 year old polish vagrant died in a hostel in sevilla . 
  ** his weight was less than 30 kilos ** and he showed clear signs of malnutrition . 
  [ en ] ( http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news-spain/sevilla/medical_negligence_alleged_after_a_23_year_old_polish_vagrant_died_in_a_hostel_in_sevilla.shtml ) rant : our judges are coward or corrupt ? 
  zaplana knew and got nothing about the crazy corruption of terra m\u00edtica and rajoy discovered the ilegal financing of the party that leaded by the press ( and knew nothing about g\u00fcrtel and all that shit ) . 
  am i supposed to believe that ? 
  and baltar not going to prison after using 700,000 euros of public funds in irregular hirings ? 
  edit : it 's nice to see another spaniard writting news here . 
  could you change the name to include a vowel in the 5 first letters ? 
  or give a clue about how to spell it ? 
  edit : that 's my though . 
  the spanish government would oppose and nobody except basque and catalan nationalist would care . 
  my forecast : after the next elections rajoy will stay in power with the support of the psoe , and they will keep the current policies . 
  the primaries of the psoe were won by pedro sanchez the conservative candidate . 
  he was the only candidate that supported the current economic policies and that from opposition . 
  they had also a eduardo madina , social-liberal candidate ; he was the favourite , his wife was * hired * by telefonica for the same type of position that rajoy 's wife had . 
  pedro sanchez was involved in the fall of caja madrid , as part of the assembly . 
  the only candidate without known dirty stuff was the independent left candidadate jose antonio perez tapias . 
  both big parties are too conservative to change . 
  the psoe turned to the right a month after the best results of the parties to its left . 
  i am using conservative as opposed to change . 
  i mean the tobacco distribution is done with a system of a private monopoly for every postal code , both big parties support it . 
  it was established by franco . 
  it does n't fit with liberal or socialist policies , but it 's a strong lobby . 
  one of the errors of madina was defending the liberalization of things like that . 
  this country is very complicated to reform , cutting healthcare and education and raising taxes is easy . 
  edit : and the only national parties that propose reforms are too chavist , i voted the center left valencian nationalist compromis , and i am not nationalist . 
  sorry for the rant . 
  i was on vacation , and nobody sent the new leader of the psoe . 
  am i the only that sends news about spain ? 
   was there a big debate among major spanish politicians before singing maastricht ? 
  if by major you mean pp ( conservative ) , psoe ( progressive ) , the pnv ( conservative basque perpetual ruling party ) or ciu ( catalan liberal-conservative coalition ruling then and now ) ; then no . 
  all of them supported the euro and used their public media for selling the project . 
  the only opposition came from : * iu : coalition built around the communist party . 
  not communists only , many different groups ended there . 
  it was the third party and was mostly against the euro . 
  * abertzale left ( basque * patriotic * left ) edit : and now the soft eurosceptic left is moving to podemos . 
  julio anguita `` the caliph '' ( he was the mayor of cordoba and has certain personality ) , former leader of the united left .
