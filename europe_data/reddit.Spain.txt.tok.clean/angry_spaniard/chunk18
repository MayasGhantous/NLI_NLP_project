  [ youtube video ] ( http://youtube.com/watch?v=i38svjek9fi ) , spanish sorry . 
  and he leads a platform nowadays [ that wants to leave the euro ] ( http://www.frentecivicosomosmayoria.es/anguita-o-nos-arriesgamos-a-salir-del-euro-o-nos-morimos-de-inanicion/ ) . 
  however , the current leader of the coalition ( cayo lara ) is a former farmers union leader and is more europeist . 
  but they have a lot infighting about it and other things . 
  as spaniard i can tell you that my hometown cooperative is having problems for finding buyers for oranges . 
  the supply is way bigger than the demand many stayed on the trees and many fields are abandoned . 
  we had a thread where some people say that mediterranean coutries should increase military budgets . 
  the army is corrupt , despotic , full of drunks , half of the * mules * that bring drugs from morocco are military sent to ceuta and melilla ... the spanish military is no very respected . 
  and do n't forget the war . 
  after more than six years of economic downfall we are n't fixing these issues only cutting budgets , selling public services to cronies , raising taxes and fees , and cutting the quality of everything . 
  edit : a female captain that denounced sexual abuses [ has left the army ] ( http://www.diariomilitar.es/?p=8311 ) , without managing to get a investigation . 
  himno de riego will rise again !, 
  * spain * from my phone : * the tripulation of the air algerie were six spaniard . 
  * the 2nd quarter of 2014 was the first quarter with interannual job since 2008 . 
  * the economy grew a 0.5 % the highest growth since 2007 the highest growth since 2007 . 
  * jordi pujol , president of catalonia 1980-2003 has recognized that had money illegally on fiscal heavens and that did n't pay succession taxes from the inheritance from his father that kept abroad on andorra and switzerland . 
  * spain has approved the cannon on news aggregators like meneame , reddit or google news that link to spanish media . 
  therefore , the ca n't give up the cannon an it will be collected and administrated by the spanish media cartel cedro . 
  i do n't know how they plan to collect the money from abroad . 
  edit : * the supreme court confirms that carlos fabra , the ghost airport builder that won the lottery nine times , must go to prison 4 years for tax fraud . 
  the welfare and benefits are bigger in uk than on spain , but if you say so . 
  he also * won * the lottery [ nine times ] ( http://thelocal.com/20131025/the-politician-who-reinvented-the-rules ), 
  the problem is that spain has all the infrastructure needed for the wc . 
  and it organized one successfully on 1982 . 
  and the government does n't have money for a lot of corrupt construction . 
  not a chance for fifa . 
  spain , the governement needs a sports event to fool the people and tried to get the olympic games recently . 
  the money should not be a problem . 
  the thing that hurts more is seeing unionist writting xenophobic comments about the catalans . 
  that does n't work very well . 
  valencia has the highest debt to gdp ratio . 
  catalonia has a bigger debt and an even bigger economy . 
  it 's different basque country supported the winning side on the succession war . 
  because the basque regional institutions supported the bourbon on the succession war and the institutions of the crown of aragon supported the hausburg 300 years ago . 
  history !, 
  welcome to spain . 
   catalunya would take a part of the spanish debt based on population and gdp , but for the rest of spain it would be harder to pay the debt . 
  that 's for a negotiated independence , and that is n't going to happen . 
  ** you 're ** butchering ** your ** language . 
  they are minimized to an 80 % of civilian causalities . 
  i call bullshit that they only want the tunnels . 
  they want palestina and all the current inhabitants death or exiled, 
  french , austrian and italian are more unfriendly to foreigners . 
  uk is sort of ok . and probably other countries are worse that these three . 
  but , that does n't imply the euro . 
  the british minimum wage is already already a [ 79.95 % higher ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_minimum_wage ) , and the cost of living may be a 20 % higher . 
  and the people is already migrating . 
   it should be able to cover a single room plus food and bills . 
  in london ? 
  or in rural areas of wales ? 
  unions are for everybody . 
  the guys that pick olives at andalusia join unions like sat . 
  a pm of a fiscal heaven . 
  i am not exactly happy with this . 
   no , it is the result of decades of heavy corruption and nepotism . 
  maybe , but this is n't a solution to it . 
  it 's perpetuating the situation . 
  that 's the vat only and you get a disccount for the vat that you pay . 
  good for some businesses not so good if you are a software developer than only can apply for the vat of his laptop and maybe some transport . 
  and you are forgetting the income tax for the net profit unless you a company . 
  then there is corporate tax for company profits and income tax for the business administrator . 
  and the minimum social security fee for business administrators is 300 euros . 
  we are talking about the mandatory payment to the social security for getting a minimum pension of around 550 euros . 
  and the basic fee is flat . 
  if you loss money you pay 255 euros , if you earn millions you pay 255 euros . 
  it 's mandatory and you ca n't get out . 
  however you are allowed to pay more for a higher pension . 
  almost nobody does it . 
  the people paying is n't the people who profitted, 
   the scheme paid out an average monthly grant of $ 272 , ranging from just over $ 150 in spain to over $ 600 for lithuanian erasmus students . 
  i can confirm the spanish figure , but i am surprised that lithuania is the country that pays more . 
  do you want retroactive cuts ? 
  changing the rules affecting decisions done before the change is very popular with investors . 
  all the big foreign investors are suing spain .

  wage have n't stagnated , [ they are falling ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/12/17/inenglish/1387290287_375964.html ) . 
  a population with falling purchasing power : high unemployment , high private debt that is falling ( slowly ) , and falling wages . 
  i do n't see how you generate inflation in this context . 
  and i am not sure if want inflation with falling salaries . 
  edit : salaries in general are stagnated , even if many workers have been seen their salaries fall . 
  but most of the workers have not seen salary rises in 5 years with high rises in prices in energy sales taxes going from 16 % to 21 % ... spanish inflations has been higher than eu average since the euro . 
  it 's time to reverse the trend , a big part of the lost of competitiviness has been due to the higher inflation than other countries with the same currency . 
  if the rest of the eu wants to have low inflation , spain must have deflation to compensate that . 
  it 's not going to happen . 
  spain has way more electricity production capacity than needed and the subsidies to renewable energy sources have been cut ( retroactively ) . 
  and saudi !, 
  we are the first region in all europe in being investigated about that . 
   selvagens islands spain does n't claim the * islands * . 
  spain claims that the * islands * are rocks and therefore they do n't have eez . 
  [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/savage_islands#dispute_over_the_eez ), 
   of course , the spanish might reasonably retort that , whatever the legal niceties , the population of oliven\u00e7a is loyal to the spanish crown . 
  the spanish government is against the self-determination for defining borders . 
  the governments of both big parties are consistent about that . 
  [ better the english ine report ] ( http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/np854_en.pdf ),
