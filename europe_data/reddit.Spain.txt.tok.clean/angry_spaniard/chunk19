  the reason why the american media called dictator to hugo chavez in venezuela and not rajoy at spain and orban at hungary is very obvious . 
  i distrust him because it sound fantastic . 
  do you promise everything that is popular and do n't give details about are you going to do it ? 
  come on !, 
  i may vote him but i do n't trust him . 
   marxist he avoids the traditional marxist rhetoric , even if that is his political background . 
  he uses one more similar to the ones used by the french jacobin at the revolution and hugo chavez : `` we are the lower class and we are going to take this country from the oligarchs . '', 
  he avoids the marxist rhetoric and the more ideological part of the left wing discourse because he wants to win . 
  [ he even said that in a discourse ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yizw-ryszni ) . 
  he simply promises the things that the people wants : a progressive tax system , retirement at 60 years , basic income , nationalization of the energy cartel assets ( does n't promises this for all the sectors but the private monopolies of the energy sector are very unpopular ) , not paying the banks debts that the current government has promised to pay , getting back the fully universal health care , more democracy ... 
  he avoids any of the traditional left wing proposal that are n't popular . 
  feeling like invading now ? 
  what are you going to do ? 
  :d if you want a more serious answer this is due to a three causes : * the government has been taking out things of the defense budget because the spanish army is very unpopular on the country and it 's cheap populism . 
  * the isfas ( social security for military ) is now part of the social services budget , and it was 20 % of the personal cost for the army . 
  * the military r&d has been moved partially to industry and economy departments because the zero interest loans done by the public credit institute depend of the economy ministry and some others are because the military contractors are also industry go to the industry department . 
  ( however , with this two things we would be with 1.1 % of the gdp or arround that ) * the spanish army is very unpopular , only the conservatives sort of like them and not a lot . 
  the spanish army has killed more spanish civilians than all the foreign armies together . 
  the left distrust the army after the coups d'etat and the overthrowing of republic , and the nationalist want it as small and weak as possible . 
  i do n't think that you could convince the people to give the army a 2 % of the gdp even if the budget was balanced . 
  * spain is not paying the defense providers . 
  we have debt of 3 % of the gdp with them . 
  the budget would be higher if we were paying them . 
  [ en ] ( http://www.forexcrunch.com/spains-defense-ministry-cannot-pay-26-billion-euros-of-debt/ ) edit : if somebody wants to increase the defense expenses [ spain is trying to sell a 25 years old aircraft carrier ] ( http://www.navyrecognition.com/index.php/news/defence-news/year-2013-news/may-2013-navy-world-naval-forces-maritime-industry-technology-news/1059-several-countries-interested-in-buying-ex-spanish-navy-aircraft-carrier-principe-de-asturias.html ) . 
  or maybe we already gave up . 
  nobody has showed interest in a year . 
  * balearic islands : sort of the same as catalonia , but weaker . 
  * castille la mancha : half-castille half-andalusia , poor and jobless . 
  * canary islands : islandic andalusians ( no economy except tourism and the dialect is similar ) * castille-leon : fake community , ruled by the closet fascist of valladolid ( fachadolid ) despite leon being full of left-wing people . 
  * extremadura , retirees , public servants and farmers all living from the government . 
  they are still moors . 
   it 's in the region and they speak spanish they speak catalan . 
  andorra is an independent country . 
   blacks are seen as poor hardworking people . 
  and nobody hates poor hardworking people that competes for them for jobs . 
  the only that i know is [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/29qg7h/europe_what_townscitiesregions_are_looked_down/#cinpvvo ), 
  i think that the catalan nationalism admires poland for surviving to the neighborhood . 
  most of the people does n't care about poland . 
  like most of the people does n't care about spain at poland . 
  the thing started at the xix when poland was n't independent . 
  maybe because the catalans talked in foreigner and they were bitching about being opressed . 
  and catalan nationalist started to like the thing after the polish independence . 
  catalonia is n't still lost after centuries of being divided between france and spain ( france got a bit of catalonia at 1648 , culturally french now ) . 
  the public [ catalan tv has comedy show about politics called polonia ] ( http://www.tv3.cat/polonia ) , it 's mostly about politics . 
  and the tv and the show has a serious bias to the pro-independence field . 
  nobody hates you polan . 
  coalition translates to coalici\u00f3n in spanish and to coalici\u00f3 in catal\u00e1n . 
  it 's the bilingual touch . 
   while having the infrastructure of kabul 3 weeks after the invasion . 
  what invasion ? 
  there are so many !, 
  i do n't think that anybody cares about la rioja and cantabria . 
  even if some people thinks that the regions should not exist . 
  you know , leon independent region and cantabria and rioja with the rest of old castile . 
  maybe they are hated as part of the generic hate against the castillian hegemony . 
  galicia , valencia and andalusia are winning the corruption league . 
  for now . 
   pro-madrid and that the language is similar to catalan but you call it valencian valencia is very pro-madrid and we even had an anti-catalan spanish nationalist party ( blavers , first called uni\u00f3n valenciana and then coalici\u00f3n valenciana ) on the regional parliament ( the only region in having something like that ) . 
   i know that valencianos are more pro-madrid and that the language is similar to catalan but you call it valencian the differences are very small . 
  there are more differences within catalonia ( they have [ eastern and western dialects ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_language#dialects ) ) . 
  valencian is very similar to the catalan spoken at tarragona , lleida and andorra . 
  it 's a political thing , being from bosnia you should be able to relate . 
   los che or levante ? 
  los che is used on football context for the followers of the valencia cf team , levante is also the name of a smaller team and a name the is given to the valencian community often , but other times includes also catalonia and murcia ( the spanish levante ) . 
  i sometimes wonder if the ches thing comes from calling the catalan * polacos * ( polish ) if they are polish we are obviously czechs ( southern smaller neighbour ) .
