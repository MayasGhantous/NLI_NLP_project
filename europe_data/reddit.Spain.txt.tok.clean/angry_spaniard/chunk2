  old , but it 's still of actuality . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/vinetas/terrorifico-monstruo-escoces_10_301069892.html ) , uploaded to imgur because reddit . 
  the guy is [ rajoy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/077nhdd.jpg ) , spanish pm . 
  no , that i am aware . 
  other than some declarations about fiscal heavens . 
  [ this article ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/10/08/opinion/1412786141_675847.html ) is signed by the leader . 
  [ this proposal ] ( https://web-podemos.s3.amazonaws.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/medidas-internas-contra-los-paraisos-fiscales.pdf ) is under discussion in the party . 
  it 's the official forum . 
  click in http://plaza.podemos.info . 
  however , nothing said there compromises the party . 
  sweden does n't have an opt out , technically sweden has to join the euro . 
  after being a member of the erm two years . 
  and that 's not going to happen . 
  some people has a tendency to exaggerate . 
  they are a party without a lot of ideology that appeals mostly to moderate conservative voters , mostly due to the strong competence in the left and the nonexistence of liberals outside of catalonia ( and these are in name only in my opinion ) . 
  it was founded by [ rosa diez ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rosa_d%c3%adez ) after losing the internal elections to the socialist workers party leadership . 
  she made some 180\u00ba turns in politics compared with her previous positions . 
  he party is having some problems with her personalism lately . 
  she doe n't have a lot of ideology , and she even hired a [ regional actor ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/toni_cant%c3%b3 ) for leading the valencian party . 
  my region . 
  i would define them to generic populist that without scare anybody , and target the voters of that the pp is losing . 
  the current ruling party ( pp ) is way more scary with the 20 years of illegal financing , the hundreds of corruption cases , the connections with drug dealing , being funded by a former minister of information of the dictatorship that was in the senate until 2011 , confesional catholic ( but fortunately refuses to illegalize gay marriage ) ... 
  i personally think that upyd would n't be as bad as the pp if they have to play the role of conservative party . 
  but i am finding hard to take them seriously , trying to play that role with a leader that was a former socialist high officer . 
  and she now wants derogate the special old fiscal status for the basque country when she ( basque ) was in the basque politics defended it also and was key to reestablish it with the basque nationalist party ( she even signed a coalition with them ) . 
  and then there is the lack of internal democracy , all the electoral list are elaborated or vetoed by the leader ... edit : i find funny how much some left wing spaniards hate the parties that target the right wing voter usually . 
  even if podemos has been doing some discourses to appeal to the decent people that are conservatives , but do n't want their country ruled by criminals . 
  edit2 : i forgot the actor . 
   i 'm betting a few eurozone members are kicking themselves now for not doing the same . 
  yes . 
  about the french case : [ alstom sold the energy business to ge at the end ] ( http://online.wsj.com/articles/ges-alstom-deal-shattered-frances-dream-1403728034 ) . 
  and the declarations were sort of right the governments have the right to veto corporate operations in many cases . 
  maybe we should scrap the euro , no making it mandatory . 
  i would understand that he means that theecb should be under political control . 
   retirement age of 60 ? 
  does spain not have the problem of population aging ? 
  yes , one of the worse in the world . 
  still the main reason why the pension system will need a massive injection of public funds in the next years is the unemployment . 
  the leader said in an interview that lowering retirement age and forcing the companies to hire younger employees would contribute to increase birth rate and make more sustainable our demographics . 
  however , he also said that being the average retirement age 62 years and many people going to retirement recently jobless the previous 5 years or more it would n't be a big cost to the spanish government . 
  then you make think that it would n't make a difference for the youth either . 
  long term jobless , people affected by collective layoffs , police officers , school teachers , firefighters and some other collectives can ask for early retirement at 60 or 61 years . 
  and the police , teachers , and firefighters with full pensions if they worked more than 35 years . 
  they are doing a more moderate discourse that what they were doing a year ago before becoming a party . 
  [ the leader did this in his tv show for chavez death ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyjlr2l39r0 ), 
  do you have any questions for them ? 
  i have curiosity about what an american would ask , and how their bases would react . 
  i am going to put [ this video here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyjlr2l39r0 ) . 
  you do n't need to know spanish to get a feeling of where this university professor and showman was politically a year ago . 
  in fact their program is very clear : democratization of the ecb , nationalizations , separation of church and estate , auditing the public debt , basic income , retirement age set up at 60 years . 
  another thing is that you believe or like them , but they are n't founded on empty . 
  slightly off topic . 
  i recommend you to distrust everybody by default . 
  i do n't distrust germans more than spaniards . 
  trust is something that has to be earned, 
   seriously ? 
  do you think that the political positions of the average psoe militant and voter are closer to the pp than to podemos ? 
  i do n't know why the opinion of the average voter matters . 
  and i do n't have very high opinion of the militants of the party at this point if somebody continues there is probably for connections and/or getting a public office to use for corruption . 
  [ there is support in the party for the grand coalition ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2014/05/12/actualidad/1399875819_660624.html ) . 
  there is a lot of people in the party that would fight a government with a party that would try to reduce corruption or push for left-leaning policies that would threaten the interest of the companies that fund the party and have the elders of the party in the payroll . 
  if we want a clean start an organization like the psoe should n't be near the government . 
   the main interest the party has is self-preservation , and a grand coalition certainly would n't serve it . 
  this is why s\u00e1nchez has now swerved leftwards . 
  a grand coalition would keep anybody that wants to clean the public administration out of power 4 more years . 
  that will seem like self-preservation for a lot of people with a long political trajectory . 
  and they can let the pp have minority government with their support in the parliament . 
  erc is having a lot of success according to the polls and the eu elections with this strategy . 
  talking is free . 
  rajoy promised lower taxes , honesty , transparency and so on . 
  we have all the reasons to think that he is simply bullshitting . 
   are you under the impression that i like him , perchance ? 
  nope , i just said that , for the party to recover , he 'll have to stand up ( or at least be seen to stand up ) to the regional barons . 
  of course that will mean betraying those same barons who have put him where he stands in the first place , but treachery is no novelty in politics , or the psoe for that matter ... 
  it 's not only the regional barons : felipe gonz\u00e1lez , alfonso guerra ( who is still in the parliament ) . 
  a general secretary does n't have as much power . 
  and he is n't going to be automatically candidate for the elections , like zapatero . 
  he promised primaries for electing the candidate separatedly , that means that the barons still can fuck him . 
  he is a fruit of the party bureaucracy that has been only a city councilor in madrid and a backbencher deputy . 
  and a member of the assembly of caja madrid where he did nothing except ratify the decisions of the board and getting a mortgage with employee conditions . 
  he does n't look like somebody passionated for making a difference or serving his country let 's be honest .
