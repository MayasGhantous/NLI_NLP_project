  should we * blame * the agenda 2010 for this ? 
  germany was ages without minimum wage and without a significant problem of working poor getting welfare or not earning enough to live before these reforms . 
  i have heard that these reforms helped to make germany more competitive , but it may have had other effects . 
  most of them , i am going to write the things that i have heard from : andalusia : * corrupt . 
  * full of gypsies , * socially conservative , bullfighting loving people that has voted the socialist party 36 year and counting * subsidized * they are lazy and live from welfare schemes * they work 60 hours/weeks in the submerged economy to live in poverty ( both are true for different people ) * corrupt : eres , marbella , jesus gil , sandokan ... basques * privileged fuckers , still with the old laws ( fueros ) . 
  their corporate tax is always 2 % lower that the rest of the country . 
  * terrorist * unsupportive , they are the richest part of the country and they do n't contribute to the national solidarity framework ( because they supported the right king in a civil war 300 years ago ) * brutes : because terrorism and basque sports . 
  and not only to gypsies and black people like everybody . 
  to the spaniards ( maketos ) . 
  they believe they are special with their old language , their old traditions and their odd surnames . 
  therefore the successful comedy [ 8 apellidos vascos ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ocho_apellidos_vascos ) ( 8 basque surnames ) catalonia : * believes that is better the others . 
  * wannabe rich * they waste their money in promoting their language and trying to have a regional foreign policy and stuff like that . 
  * they should accept that their language is useless and the immigrants from of other parts of spain to learn it . 
  * edit : this was important . 
  the worse thing that you can be ** polacos/polish ** . 
  [ there is even a catalan show called polonia due to all the jokes ] ( http://www.tv3.cat/ptv3/tv3totsvideos.jsp?idint=200292966 ) galicia * corrupt ( feijoo & dorado , clan of the baltar , case pokemon , case beb\u00e9 , case muralla , case campeon ) * drug dealing : most of the drug cartels are based on galicia ( marcial dorado and his friends ) . 
  madrid : * fucking capital bastards , they live from use they are ruling us ... the rest of the country hates them . 
  * madrid would be nothing if the government stopped favouring them . 
  ** valencia ( my homeland ) ** * full of corruption ( ghost airports , ghost cinema studios , highways to nowhere ) * it has a weird relation with catalonia . 
  * it has always to try to show that is better than catalonia . 
  if they build port aventura , we build terra m\u00edtica . 
  they have formula-1 circuit we had to have an urban formula-1 circuit . 
  but it always ends badly and costing a lot of tax payer money . 
  :( * the spanish nationalist identity is stronger than the local ( the catalans look down on us for that ) . 
  * ceuta & melilla * full of moors * isolated * they live from public money and i think that i could keep going .

  [ spain has even surpassed italy on gdp per capita ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pz8it8b.jpg ) . 
  spain is the second car manufacturer in the eu , second biggest alimentary industry , second biggest touristic sector , chemical industry , developed telecommunications ... and spain like italy , has also a north-south divide , and the capital . 
  edit : however , that was rhetorical , of course there is still some submerged economy . 
  even at urban southern spain if you avoid ~ ~ the gypsies ~ ~ certain areas like [ las tres mil viviendas ] ( https://www.google.se/search?q=las+tres+mil+viviendas&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=rtu&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us:official&amp;channel=sb&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=kj2tu8e3cajpywp_goggda&amp;ved=0cb8qsaq&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=963 ) it 's fine . 
  and urban areas do n't have a lot of economy either . 
  but ... but ... they pay so well !,

  you need to go to rural southern spain . 
  there is n't even submerged economy any more . 
  and there is almost no crime . 
  i know that i am foreigner , but from here he looks like a piece of shit . 
  sure , if you pay the bill . 
   why not just increase the taxes of companies that use automation because they move to other countries . 
   and at the same time increase social help programs ? 
  that 's not going to happen because we have a big and growing public debt . 
  i am amazed that the presumed brain of one of the more complex corruption networks at spain was in that position without any public reaction from other countries .

  wow , very prosecutor :  anti-corruption prosecutors had already opposed his decision to name cristina as a suspect , saying there was insufficient evidence against her .

  edit : it 's not funny anymore , but whatever . 
  [ duke of alba , never forget ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fernando_%c3%81lvarez_de_toledo,_3rd_duke_of_alba ), 
  you 're worse ~ ~ slave ~ ~ slav . 
  let 's be honest . 
  10 years ago the republicans , the opposition to the establishment , catalan independence movement , anti-corruption movements , chavist left ... were very small . 
  if the living standards were improving instead of falling most of the people would be happy the rotten country . 
  even now , rajoy was elected with an absolute majority in 2011 despite financing illegally his 2008 campaign . 
  and everybody knew it since 2009 . 
  but he promised higher salaries , more jobs and less taxes and who cares about anything else ? 
  ( he has given the opposite , and that 's why he is n't popular anymore , no all the corruption and authoritarian behaviour ), 
  germany always has too much ambition . 
  the next thing is wanting siberia . 
  before cameron all the left ( at least the spanish ) was opposing to juncker . 
  the republican furor is more like a signal of increasing social unrest . 
  the king has been used by the establishment as a symbol of itself . 
  and the more unpopular becomes the establishment the more unpopular will be the king . 
  therefore , if the things do n't get better for the population the monarchy will become more and more unpopular . 
  it 's not the fault of the king ; he does n't get involved in politics ; he has been drinking , whoring , hunting and doing tourism full time the last 20 years and 10 years ago the monarchy was very popular . 
  the new king does n't have the powers to take action about any of the problems of our society , and a king ca n't denounce a government . 
  and if the openly corrupt government wants to use him as a shield he ca n't avoid it . 
  the coronation has been used by the conservatives and the catholic church and he ca n't do anything about that . 
  the furor against the monarchy will probably calm down . 
  but it may appear against the mortgage law ( again ) , against the lack of separation between church and state , against the corruption , those small outbreaks there and there were the government tries to do a shady construction project and a group of people ends fighting against the police to stop the project ( they succeed in gamoral and barcelona ) ... 
  the pressure is growing . 
  this country ca n't continue forever as it has been these years . 
  it may fall apart literally as yugoslavia , or reform peacefully , or go chavist ( a newly created party [ podemos ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2yx35fm.jpg ) got 8 % of the vote at the eu elections and was created 100 days before by the university professor and tv showman at the picture ) . 
   that does n't mean warsaw is poor , average wage , after taxes , is something like $ 1750 . 
  that 's higher than my home city ( valencia ) . 
  it would be $ 1,500 and valencia is more expensive than warsaw . 
  ** spain ** the big news are the world cup elimination and the new king and you know both . 
  * felipe vi has become the new king with a surprisingly strong republican reaction . 
  * spain has been eliminated from the world cup . 
  * the government is working in a fiscal reform to reduce income taxes to middle and higher earners , but [ the severance pay tax exemptions will fall to 2000 euros/year ] ( http://www.abc.es/economia/20140620/abci-despido-pago-irpf-201406192125.html ) ( before the severance pays were tax free , and at this country some years 3 % of the gdp has been severance pays ) , reducing the corporate tax for big companies to the same rate as sme ( 25 % ) , and a flat rate capital gains replacing the current progressive one .
