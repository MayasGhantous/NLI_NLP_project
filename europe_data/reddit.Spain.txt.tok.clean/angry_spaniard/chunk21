  but they have n't finished and spain has been eliminated from the world cup . 
  therefore , they have to water down the reform now . 
  * tax cuts with the debt at 100 % and the deficit at 6.8 % , however spain recently raised also the vat to basic needs and did a weird reform around the energy sector that should mean that the deficit will remain similar but with a more regressive fiscal system . 
  * justice minister 's son ( the second ) alleged to have fled scene after crashing into several cars . 
  * it 's him or somebody was using his car . 
  * [ en ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/06/17/inenglish/1402996495_533225.html ) it has been a slow week as you see . 
  i start a new thread because the other spanish guy has written a one line against the monarchy only . 
  i says something about our public opinion , but it 's not a news resume . 
  el pa\u00eds has [ a very complete article ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/06/17/inenglish/1403009562_383719.html ) ( biased of course ) about the training funds in english if you are interested on it is good . 
  but all the corruption affairs have moved slowly this week . 
  he seems to handle the fucking fine . 
  [ he gets drunk , hunts and has 100 bastards . 
  what king i am talking about ? ], 
  ( http://www.vistoenlasredes.com/vefs/2013/01/vef_329205_twitter_diferencias_por_elmediohombre.jpg ) the guy at the left is obviously an actor . 
  [ so muslim ] ( http://forward.com/articles/190257/how-quenelle-salute-creator-dieudonne-built-bridge/?p=all )  three years later , he joined the front national 's annual `` bleu , blanc , rouge '' celebration -- a visit returned by jean-marie le pen , who as godfather , presided over the ** baptism ** of dieudonn\u00e9 's fourth child, 
  that 's part of transition agreements . 
  they won the war and they ruled 40 years and they managed the transition to democracy . 
  and they created the current conservative party ( pp ) [ spain is also protecting the tortures from others governments ] ( http://m.thelocal.com/20140425/spain-rejects-extradition-of-franco-era-torturer-argentina-human-rights ), 
   the harmless monarchies ** everyone loves ** today only exist because they were presented with the guillotine as the alternative . 
  what about ** no ** ? 
   they can get out but not back in . 
  you know that 's contrary to your constitution ( likely , mine for sure ) . 
  you can not deprive of citizenship or forbid a citizen to enter the country . 
   vmro the other two are nazis , that would be hard to sell . 
  what about this party ? 
  i know that they are right wing , but they have the greens . 
  however , i think that they are going to stay . 
  it 's not like the average voter knows shit about this and pnv is n't seeking independence at this point and [ this guy ] ( http://www.alde.eu/alde-group/alde-meps-list-member-european-parliament/alde-mep-details/personal-info/tremosa-i-balcells-ramon/ ) from cdc was expected to get some important office with alde for this period . 
  and they care more about that that about coherence . 
  however ; let 's see , upyd and ciutadans may change everything . 
  if cdc does n't get something good they may try to move . 
  luxembourg is a [ fiscal heaven ] ( http://www.dw.de/luxembourg-the-eus-top-tax-haven/a-16729339 ) and has a lot of international institutions . 
  spain has gone from 105 to 95 since 2006 . :( and greece has fallen even more . 
  the spanish social democratic party supported separation between church and state in the 30s ( nowadays it opposes ) . 
  i do n't think that the old left was conservative and christian anywhere . 
  i do n't understand . 
  if you oppose austerity that 's the wrong candidate to back . 
   david cameron has risked some of his credibility in fighting to get a reformer into the post when * reformer * means eurosceptic . 
  sweden has had a very bad problem with alcohol and it 's doing better now . 
  it 's less corrupt than romania or bulgaria . 
  you do n't have to pay bribes to get health care and the public administration is hired with independence usually . 
  ** spain ** ** corruption ** * santiago mayor , charged in the ` pok\u00e9mon ' case ( got ta catch em all ) , resigns . 
  \u00c1ngel carr\u00e1s has been the last one to add to the list of resignations , after last week as many as nine of his councillors , charged and condemned , announced their departure from the city hall . 
  9 of 13 councillors condemned already ( and the other 4 charged ) . 
  * and they were in opposition before 2011 . 
  this has been the quickest looting even more than jaume matas in baleares ( 2003-2007 ) . 
  * [ en ] ( http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news-spain/galicia/corruption_takes_the_head_of_the_mayor_of_santiago_de_compostela.shtml ) * the court of auditors minced works projects and contracts to circumvent the contract law for public administration , and awarded to a businessman who arranged the private houses of the number two and chief audit institution , javier medina , and his brother enrique , manager of the court until the end of 2012 .

  why are they saying anti-immigration when is simply racism ? 
  is not like the jews or the gypsies are immigrants in hungary . 
  should we expect any change from him ? 
  i would have liked to read opinions from foreigners about this . 
   many cultures has this mindset . 
  it 's surviving in spain sort of . 
  that 's one of the things that makes collective negotiation between workers and companies a mess . 
  employer change unilaterally working conditions . 
  the business has problems or the unemployment is so high that he thinks that can replace anybody who leaves due to it and earn more . 
  workers : strike !, 
  maybe also going to court to check if it 's an illegal breach of contract ( who trusts our courts anyway ? ), 
  if the strike is successful : negotiations or directly the changes are withdraw . 
  the strike fails , or the business is able to take the losses more than the workers to be without pay . 
  the changes stick . 
  aftermath : whatever happens at the previous step . 
  the company becomes a toxic workplace and key employees leave in the next months and the company develops long term problems . 
  this happened in my previous employer . 
  and it was a software development company that was doing ok before . 
  i think that france does things like this also . 
  i have the feeling that countries like sweden or germany employees and employers negotiate before going to strike or changing the working conditions . 
  is like that ? 
  i want to remember that the office of king is for life .
