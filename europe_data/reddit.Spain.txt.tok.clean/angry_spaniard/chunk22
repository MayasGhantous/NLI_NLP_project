  [ article in english ] ( http://english.pravda.ru/news/society/sex/06-08-2004/58504-0/ )  in the financial report about the trip to moscow they included tickets to an ` erotic theatre . ', 
  spanish guests paid 129 euros for tickets , although they indicated them as ` taxi expenses . ', 
  you can have a pm owned by corporations with executive and legislative powers and a king . 
  and it 's not fine for the countries that are seeing how taxes that should be paid in their countries are avoided thanks to the fiscal heavens ( most of them commonwealth or part of the uk ) . 
  seeing the guys that we have been electing does n't make anybody optmistic . 
  i know that our elected pm is an order of magnitude ( or three ) worse than the king . 
  and the position does n't have power ; only money , legal immunity and diplomatic immunity . 
  the constitution reserves some power to the king but he has not used it . . 
  however , if i am going to pay somebody to hunt , whore and drink with my taxes while ~ ~ he ~ ~ his family is in shady deals with his shady friends ; he should be at least be elected . 
  i disagree . 
  gibraltar is fiscal heaven and there is a serious smuggling problem specially with tobacco . 
  gibraltar has the right to be a fiscal heaven and spain has the right to have a strict border policy . 
  therefore the situation is perfectly fine . 
  what 's wrong with having an actual border ? , both countries can make their own decisions . 
  it 's a message to them ( and other things ) . 
  if you declare independence spain would close the borders .

  he is the leader of the businessmen federation in madrid , and the number 2 nation-wide . 
  with my current government , no . 
  personally , yes . 
   the eu is not supposed to be another layer of politics , but a supranational organisation driven by consensus that 's under debate . 
  and it 's politics , it 's deciding political questions, 
  you are talking about 2020 at least . 
   ii 've seriously been saying we should legalize marihuana since the recession started , not because i smoke ( i do n't ) but because of the jobs and tax revenue it would create i have said the same with heroine and i am not kidding , it would be better than afghan war lords . 
  i ca n't find anything about that now . 
  but there are popularity polls , maybe i was thinking about the popuarity [ polls ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2014/06/02/actualidad/1401704469_632570.html ) the monarchy has popularity of 3.72 . 
  edit : spain has n't included in the official cis polls the monarchy [ since 1982 ] ( http://www.lasexta.com/programas/el-objetivo/noticias/1982-pregunta-espanoles-prefieren-monarquia-republica_2013110300391.html ) . 
  this was the last one popular printed . 
  there is also [ mongolia ] ( http://www.revistamongolia.com/ ) that is independent , but it 's not very well known . 
  all the printed media and tv-channels are monarchist . 
  there are two sort of popular online publications http://wwweldiaro.es and http://www.publico.es but that 's it . 
  well and the pro-independence basque and catalan media that 's true . 
  you need to remember that most of the media needs the favour of the government to work . 
  and all the printed newspapers live from things like institutional adds ( the government annouces that is doing some construction work and pays overprice for telling in the media , or campaigns for vial security ) or less transparents subsidies like the public adminsitrations buying thousands of copies for libraries and offices because reasons . 
  you need to have a good relation with the government for getting adds from the government . 
  it has n't been censored by the writers of the magazine . 
  it 's an order of the main shareholder rba . 
  [ 8 writers have left the magazine ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fecoteuve.eleconomista.es%2fecoteuve%2fprensa%2fnoticias%2f5840411%2f06%2f14%2focho-firmas-abandonan-el-jueves-tras-la-censura-del-ultimo-numero-rba-prohibe-hablar-del-rey-en-portada.html%23.kku8uwyn9yi2byn&amp;edit-text= ) ( scroll down google translate screws the layout , but it 's there ) . 
  edit : the company has decided that they are monarchist . 
  nobody expected the republican reaction , due to it the editiorials are starting to restrict republican opinions and put a strong monarchist campaign in the media to try to change the public opinion . 
  i am republican , but i did n't think that the question is so important . 
  i am surprised of the strong defense of the monarchy by the establishment and by the surprisingly strong public hostility that has been shown these days . 
  edit2 : why are all the spanish media groups monarchist ? 
  it 's weird that with a support in the polls of 38 % all the newspapers , tv channels , radio and magazines owned by big companies and if the journalist or cartoonist do n't like it they know where is the exit . 
  i do n't understand why our ruling class wants the monarchy so hardly . 
   when you make a investment you can make money and lose money thats the way things work yep and now the financial sector is broken , 90 % of the construction companies died , millions of families have underwater mortgages , we have millions of long term jobless that only have worked in construction or picking oranges who are n't going to work in the rest of their life . 
  the effects of the mixture of unregulated of a wild west were you were allowed to build everything , cheap credit , and tax breaks for buying with mortgages are going to last decades . 
   goes down at least you got the housing we are going to end tearing down half of it sooner of later . 
  * 3 years of net emigration . 
  we are expected to have a net emigration of 2 million of inhabitants the next ten years . 
  * the birth rate is falling even more and we will have more deaths than births starting on 2017 according to the government * higher taxes on property , expensive utilities . 
  lower pruchasing power of the population . 
  nobody is going to live in the new suburbs . 
  * high unemployment that keeps the families together for sharing expenses * for the public administrations is also a waste to provide services and utilities to sparsely populated areas were almost nobody lives but that are full of houses , parks and stuff . 
  a construction bubble is more complicated to fix . 
  spain has a third of the empty homes in europe , and the population of spain was growing then . 
  and this houses are new no old houses in rural areas of romania and bulgaria were everybody has left . 
  spain got billions in loans for its private sector and built millions of homes were nobody lives . 
  the lost opportunities on this hurts . 
  london is the biggest metropolitan area in th eu . 
  how big and dense has to get it ? 
  uk can let london grow even more . 
  but we may want to make grow also other areas . 
  did n't we do that ? 
  sort of the laws regulating it by the spanish government were declared illegal because it was a local and regional matter . 
  and the local governments authorized everything . 
  it 's true the prices of housing have fallen 7 years in a row , but massive construction has had more effects in our economy . 
  can spaniards emigrate to wherever the jobs are created ? 
  putting the head of the imf there in these conditions . 
  this would be a great gift to the left in spain specially to podemos . 
  if they managed to stay in the eu it may be better for them . 
  they would keep all the money that they are sending to territorial cohesion and do n't lose any access to the internal markets . 
  but , spain wo n't let that happen . 
  if they leave the have to be worse to teach a lesson to basque country . 
  spain has made clear that spain will force the eu to either not recognize the independence or if it actually happens to put borders . 
  i already said what i actually think about the a republic [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/273in4/the_king_of_spain_juan_carlos_i_has_resigned/chx926u ) ( tldr : nice , not actually critical )  do n't forget that it was a right-wing government of the republic that ordered the bloody repression of the 1934 revolution ) . 
  an answer logical to an attempt of overthrowing a democratically elected government even if too brutal . 
  and the germans are already w\u00f6rking that plan . 
  hey !, 
  our monarchy is also corrupt . 
  do you wan na trade ? 
  that did n't happened on the week that finished the first of june . 
  it 's a possibility of course . 
  the outcome is n't clear . 
  i think/hope that it is n't the more likely . 
  spain would need to do serious reforms to avoid it . 
  he was a king in a democracy . 
  he got a 10 millions euros/year to spend in whatever he wanted , read discourses written by government officers , went to honorary dinners , give medals approved the government and a lot of protocol activities ... and his heir was replacing him in that more and more often lately anyway . 
  this is n't going to change a lot . 
  unless the new king wants to get involved into politics you know like negotiations about a change in status of catalonia and/or the catalan language . 
  but i do n't that nobody wants to see somebody a royal involved in actual politics . 
  i am republican ( check my flair ) , but honestly the king has been a small parasite that drained money and has n't done anything in 30 years , but he has n't done a lot of damage either . 
  he was n't in my top ten of people to get ride of ; like [ the pm that financed ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/01/mariano-rajoy-denies-illegal-funds his campaign illegally , the [ galician premier ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.eldiario.es%2fgalicia%2ffeijoo-narcotraficante-dorado-politica-gallega_0_116888510.html&amp;edit-text= ) with drug dealing connections , the non-existent * opposition * leader ( he has finally step down after the european election results ) ... 
  if i had to choose between a working judicial and protected in the constitution and a republic i would choose the first . 
  even if i want both . 
  for me the flag is only a symbol of that i want a new/better country . 
  no removing the king and business as usual . 
  the options were constitutional monarchy and non-constitutional monarchy ( surprise !, 
  surprise ! ) .
