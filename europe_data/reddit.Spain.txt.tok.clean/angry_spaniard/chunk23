  there was n't a vote about monarchy and people accepted because there were more pressing issues . 
  change flair then !, 
  even if actually nobody cares about changing the official flag . 
  i was talking more about his public reputation . 
  he started with most of the people having your opinion . 
  he managed to become popular with his firm push to parliamentary monarchy despite even a coup d'\u00e9tat . 
  and he screwed everything at the end again . 
  this should be understood as an attempt of saving the monarchy . 
  the current king has a very bad reputation at this point for many reasons . 
  the popularity of the monarchy was 38 % in the last official poll . 
  i was n't expecting him to step down because he is risking criminal prosecutions for his lasts affairs : * king spent $ 2m in public funds on personal hunting lodge . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/20131219/spains-king-spent-2m-on-hunting-pavilion ) * it has been proven that the king tried to cover the noos affair .

  you are welcome . 
   stealing is wrong , and they stole . 
  is destroying it more moral ? 
  is the government going to do something good with it ? 
  it gets more complicated when you ca n't trust your government ; the government does n't follow the law either : * the police is n't identified according to law . 
  * the identification of the protestors is n't happening according to law . 
  * the secret police is using illegal extendable clubs . 
  provided by the government of course . 
  at this point nobody believes that the government is fighting for the rule of the law . 
  probably they have some shady reasons for this . 
  this is being done by the catalan government leaded by a * liberal * pro-independence party . 
  however , it 's full of oligarchical authoritarianism , of course . 
  one of the sintoms why the riots are happening : ruling class using the police as their personal army above the law . 
  what 's the point of following the law if the government does n't ? 
  * the police is n't identified according to law . 
  * the identification of the protestors is n't happening according to law . 
  * the secret police is using illegal extendable clubs . 
  provided by the government of course . 
   good or not does n't matter , right matters . 
   the protesters are wrong , the government is right . 
  why ? 
  because the government wrote a law saying that this is right ? 
  they can approve a royal decree that changes the law tomorrow . 
  would it change the affair ? 
  i feel that you overrate the law . 
  it does n't make things right or wrong . 
  only makes them legal or illegal . 
  at some point you may find the difference . 
   that the neighborhood is supporting the rioters just makes the whole neighborhood look like a bad place to me . 
  like they 're all criminals . 
  having riots is never good for pr , it makes places look bad . 
  even worse the neightbours support the * extremists * or whatever . 
  it may make the people wonder what 's going with the institutions and the political framework in the country . 
  maybe not to you i guess . 
  but that 's actually the reason why the mayor withdrew his plans , the pr . 
  and beating more the rioters and going on with the plans of the mayor wo n't fix the deeper problems that have put us in this situation . 
  it will make the situation worse and make the state look even more like the toy of the ruling class . 
  the building is publicly owned and the city hall had it abandoned 17 years . 
  i know that i should side with the law and order and all that shit . 
  but i do n't think that the government has a better use for it . 
  probably they will give it to some cronies for some pocket change and keep half of it . 
  think about this : the neighbours sided with the squatters even after all these fucking riots . 
  this may said that there is something wrong with our institutions , honestly i find hard to believe that the politicians were planning something good . 
  i prefer to trust the squatters . 
  and i know that this bad . 
  but it 's my country . 
   who 's the owner ? 
  the municipality , exactly the public transport company ( tmb ) . 
   the people who used the building ? 
  did they have contract/permission to use it ? 
  no , they have n't . 
  they have been using the building during 17 years without permission . 
  being allowed to give more subsidies to its agriculture that the ones that it 's currently getting . 
  btw , [ the cap has been renegotiated for the new budget ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/policy-perspectives/policy-briefs/05_en.pdf ) . 
  what do you mean with renegotiate the cap ? 
  yes , but you only see that there . 
  you can not see that from the search interface .
