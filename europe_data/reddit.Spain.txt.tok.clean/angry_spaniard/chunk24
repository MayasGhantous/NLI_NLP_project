  it seems unlikely that the system is changed in the future . 
  spain is n't alone , italy has the same system for the catholic church . 
  the leader is an university professor of working class background . 
  he does n't have problems with money but he is n't rich either . 
  and lola sanchez one of the elected mep is a jobless graduate in political sciences ( master level ) who worked as waitress at weddings at weekends lately . 
  in fact [ she was working today ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.radiocable.com%2flolasanchez-eurodiputadapodemos-camarera-bodas555.html&amp;edit-text= ) . 
  what / u/anarchisto says . 
  many people do n't understand the magnitude of the bubble . 
   while the uk has barely expanded its housing stock during the past decade , spain has gone on a construction spree , building about 800,000 new homes a year -- more than france , germany and italy combined . 
  analysts believe there is demand for less than 500,000 of those , leading to a glut of supply . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.building.co.uk/spanish-housing-market-the-pain-in-spain/3114067.article ) spain has 3.4 millions of empty homes of the 11 millions in the eu . 
  and the ones in spain are n't old homes in rural areas of romania and bulgaria . 
  most of them have been built recently . 
  * spain * yes catholic religion is a subject of mandatory offer for all the public schools in spain for all the mandatory education . 
  the subject is optative for the students no for the schools . 
  the teacher is selected by the catholic church but is paid by the government . 
  the lessons are done in the school . 
  what 's ~ ~ teachen ~ ~ taught can very between areas a lot because the government can not regulate what 's ~ ~ teachen ~ ~ taught in the subject and the catholic church let 's the bishops handle the hiring of the teachers . 
  the contents of the subject depend of the teacher and the bishop . 
  it 's a subject offered for at the 10 years of mandatory education . 
  and it 's also offered at the first year of the two years of optional high school . 
  all the details are regulated at the concordate signed between the catholic church and the francoist dictatorship at 1953 . 
  spain also offers an official islam at schools of ceuta and melilla . 
  remember that spain uses the . 
  for separating the thousands and the comma for the decimal part like everybody should do . 
  somebody said that this graph was very telling about what has happened with the spanish economy . 
  it was n't only the 15 % of the population that worked building homes who lost their jobs when the bubble exploted . 
  the auxiliar sectors got crazily big also and died at the same time . 
  i found 2013 figures . 
  [ europa press ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.europapress.es%2feconomia%2fconstruccion-y-vivienda-00342%2fnoticia-economia-macro-consumo-cemento-cae-19-2013-retrocede-niveles-mediados-anos-sesenta-20140128110325.html&amp;edit-text= ) tldr of the article : * the production fell another 15 % * the annual production was 13.16 million tonnes . 
  a level bellow any year in the seventies ( the google translation screws this and say above ) . 
  * the number of workers has fallen to 4,354 workers . 
  * the workers agreed to freeze their salaries until 2015 * the monthly production was 1,232 thousands of tonnes at 2012 , 1,096 thousands of tonnes at 2013 . 
  i do n't think so . 
  however , riots were due to harsh policies against squatting , corruption and growing poverty . 
  and these leaks in other places . 
  [ 3 nights of fire + rage in streets of barcelona , no mention in international press ? 
  ] ( http://itsafunnyoldworld.wordpress.com/2014/05/29/barcelona-burns/ ) article ironically published almost at the same time as the guardian article . 
   there was no regulation to avoid or stop the bubble because of the corruption , and the corruption is the main point of podemos . 
  what / u/hmunkey is saying that the regulation actually promoted the bubble . 
  you blaming the corruption on the regulation , and the regulation on the corruption . 
  both are wrong , the biggest problem is the : * lack of independent regulators * lack of separation of powers . 
  an independent justice would be nice , even if montesquieu is dead . 
  * a xxi century justice would be nice . 
  with enough resources and using new technologies . 
  * professional local administrations . 
  * improving the property register system . 
  a private monopoly for every judicial district , wtf ? 
  i know that rajoy had one , and two of his brothers have one . 
  i am tired of not seeing the left addressing these issues . 
  podemos in fact wants less independent central banks . 
  doing promises is free . 
  it 's not costing them any money at this point . 
  about eu money . 
  they want to audit the public debt and default on the * illegitimate * part , and that would include the 41.3 billions that spain got from the [ european stability mechanism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_stability_mechanism ) to bailout the banks . 
  they also want to reform the ecb to make it more democratic ( read under eu parliament control ) , and give it a mandate to stimulate growth and allow and make it to directly buy debt from the governments directly . 
  probably they would misuse that power if they had it , but anyway germany would veto this . 
   r to pay some politician 's football crony for building a superfluous road to nowhere . 
  i am putting [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8bg8hiy.jpg ) here . 
  i think that the pp+psoe is more likely . 
  pp+c iu + pnv+up yd wo n't be enough and it 's already a too complicated alliance . 
  and they had italy in their side . 
  germany was amazing . 
   that 's the whole point . 
  there is no economy left , which means spain needs to attract money from outside . 
  or from inside . 
  amancio ortega , founder of inditex and richest man in europe , is collecting 900 millions euros every year in dividends and investing all of it on real estate . 
  6 billions invested outside and 4 billions inside . 
  [ article about that ] ( http://business.financialpost.com/2014/03/21/how-zaras-founder-amancio-ortega-has-quietly-built-a-us10-billion-all-cash-real-estate-empire/?__lsa=ce71-aa23 ) . 
  it says something that the rich people in spain does n't invest a cent inside the country except in real estate and construction even after the bubble . 
   what foreign investor would ever put money into a country with unstable politics where a notable party is openly discussing the seizure of private property and labour policies that would lower productivity while increasing costs ? 
  the same that would invest in a country that has a bigger party that wants to withdraw the eu and put a border again with its biggest market ( if you count the full eu as one market ) . 
  it 's not like the two big parties does n't support the imf program and are planning higher taxes for fresh food and energy for domestic users to fund more cuts on the corporate taxes . 
  and we are raising the retirement age to 67 from 65 . 
  and spain has introduced a sostenibility factor to the pension system that would have the pension growing a 0.25 % nominal until the social security has budget surplus ( read never ) . 
  and there is a chance that we approve a new labour market reform that would allow the employers to decrease the salary of their employees unilaterally . 
  it has been requested by the imf and business owner association , but this is n't moving . 
  be honest spain has very stable politics . 
  and the government is the hands of conservative party with absolute majority and after the next elections they will rule in coalition with the progressive psoe . 
  you can count with stable pro-austerity governments that will keep the current policies until 2019 . 
  and spain may go into bankruptcy before that year anyway . 
  edit :  it 's the dumbest thing any county in an economic crisis could ever do . 
  it 's not like the economy is going to recover with the current policies . 
  i am not so worried because podemos may destroy the country because the establishment is destroying it already . 
  podemos is n't a communist movement .
