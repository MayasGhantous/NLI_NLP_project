  they are n't promising making spain a communist country , they are promising : * 35 hours week * retirement at 60 years * basic universal income . 
  * significant rises of the minimum wage * maximum salaries * very low salaries for politicians . . everything within a capitalist framework . 
  and a lot of more free stuff . 
  this is generic left leaning populism . 
  they may have a hidden communist agenda ( juan carlos monedero a former hugo chaves economy advisor is a member of the leading team ) but , it 's hidden then . 
  they have n't talked about it . 
  and i heard people asking for this stuff in 2010 . 
   i would understand the scare with iu and erc , but podemos have a different discourse even though they come from the same political current ( communism ) , they avoid all the traditional leftist talk and concentrate on concrete problems . 
  instead of traditional leftist talk they promise free money for everybody . 
  that does n't make me feel better . 
  i understand that they do n't plant fulfil their promises that they are only bullshit for getting the fools to vote for them , but that this works better is depressing . 
  my government seems more focused on looting and saving banks than in fixing the economy . 
  bitch please , we worship it more . 
  do you study poems to the money in school ? 
  because we do . 
  [ what the money can do ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fantologiapoeticamultimedia.blogspot.se%2f2006%2f08%2flo-que-puede-el-dinero.html&amp;edit-text= ) by the archpriest of hita ( the google translation sucks , like always with the poetry ) edit : we have a system for dealing with insolvency . 
  it 's only that you are insolvent for life after using it . 
  but it allows you to keep part of your income . 
  [ 100 % until minimum wage and a decreasing percentatge ] ( http://www.laboroteca.com/2014/01/salario-minimo-inembargable-2014.html ) after that . 
  blood for the blood god !, 
  they also talk about an insolvency law that allows clean starts , but without any detail and in internal pages . 
  for the ones that does n't know it , the debts are for life in spain and the bankruptcy laws allows you to save a part of your income for living expenses but the laws do n't offer any way out of debts . 
  there is people without homes or any patrimony owing 200,000 euros or probably more ( i am talking about the highest case that i know ) . 
   `` consideration could be given to introducing a personal insolvency framework that would allow insolvent debtors to have a fresh start after having given up their non-exempt assets and a substantial period of good faith efforts to pay the outstanding debt , '' the report says . 
   a high speed rail network between countries ? 
  spain has the biggest high speed rail network in europe . 
  overrated and expensive . 
  we do n't have eurosceptic far right , but we have populist . 
  the 5 stars movement and podemos are populist movements . 
   this is all over the news in france but the international media has n't picked up yet . 
  it may ruin sarkozy 's chances for 2017 since when the illegal funding ruins a political career ? 
  rajoy and the spanish pp where caught in 2009 and they went to the 2011 elections and won . 
  rajoy said that the treasurer did everything without his knowledge and that 's it . 
  the treasurer is now in jail and rajoy pm . 
  he is talking about the 1989 results . 
  spain and portugal joined in 1986 . 
  and the actual far-right got their best results in european elections at germany in 1989 . 
   he good and the bad from both sides . 
  there are more than two sides . 
  when did germany do that ? 
  german parties are all centrism and coalitions of the more moderate politics . 
  i do n't think so . 
  if they have i ca n't find it . 
  they support the self-determination of catalonia , that may mean something . 
  i do n't think they have one . 
  they talk about you in keeping an hostil foreign and comercial policies against fiscal heavens specially those inside the eu . 
   ( tipo impositivo de inversiones procedentes de para\u00edsos fscales del 50 % en sus transacciones ) english :  ( 50 % tax rate for investments coming from fiscal havens in their transactions ), 
  speak english motherfucker !, 
  first time that i hear about them . 
  i thought that you were talking about the writers of the spanish constitution . 
  i lost track of all the groups created from the 15-m, 
   constituyentes who are those * constituyentes * ? 
  the [ francoist minister ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manuel_fraga_iribarne ) , the [ corrupt right wing catalan nationalist ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/miquel_roca ) who is the lawyer of the princess cristina nowadays ? 
  [ the three generic right wing ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/padres_de_la_constituci%c3%b3n ) ? 
  seriously . 
  they only wanted a peaceful transition to democracy . 
  the constitution does n't say shit about that . 
  and most of them would oppose ( maybe the guy was communist then would like this , but i do n't think so ) . 
  what makes you think that this guys would have liked podemos ? 
  it seems very unlikely . 
  edit : i am talking about the guys that wrote the spanish constitution he seems to be talking about somebody else . 
  for the 2015 i would expect a similar outcome to the greek elections , without far right . 
  instead of them the moderate populist right upyd ( founded by a woman who lost the internal elections to the leadership of the socialist party ) , maybe they have some hate against catalans ( just what we need ! ), 
  but that 's it . 
  the pp and psoe would form a coalition government for keeping the current policies in place . 
  the most likely outcome is a government that would keep the current economic and social policies until 2019 at least . 
  you may be interested in some of their proposals : * basic income . 
  * higher pensions , minimum pension = minimum wage . 
  * making more expensive to fire employees . 
  restrict/forbid discretional layoffs in companies with profits . 
  * the standard retirement age is beign raised from 65 to 67 years . 
  reduce it to 60 . 
  * nationalize the assests of the energy cartel ( honestly , something needs to be done about the cartel and the two big parties are allied with it ) . 
  * 35 hour work week . 
  * legalization of squatting for poor people ( but was n't everybody going to have enough income to afford a home ?? ) . 
  * mortgage debt moratorium * auditing the public debt . 
  translation not paying back the eu bank bailout if the banks ca n't pay it like the eu-eurozone govenments and the spanish government agreed . 
  * i seriously think that you deserve this for giving the bailout . 
  * * and more things , some normal : free university , scolarships , public housing , restoring universal health care , better public transport , anti-nuclear , anti-transgenics ... edit : where are you from ? 
  our rulers money is already there . 
  do n't believe that they are radical right . 
  they are populist , but no radical . 
  they moved from social-democratic to moderate right . 
  and they hired [ an actor ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/toni_cant%c3%b3 ) for better populism ( he is a member of the spanish parliament now ) . 
  but they actually avoid being in extremist positions . 
   if you call ppsoe organized crime i called the pp organized crime only , psoe is disorganized crime obviously . 
  about ciu , i do n't hate them so much , but i am not catalan . 
  this is my definition of the parties . 
  * pp ( epp ) conservative organized crime : ** 16 mep ** * psoe ( pes ) progressive disorganized crime : ** 14 mep ** * la izquierda plural/the plural left ( gue ) : coalition of left leaning coalitions mostly the united left ( leaded by ex-communist pce ) and icv ( catalan nationalist eco-socialist ) : ** 6 mep ** * podemos ( gue ) : populist chavist-like socialist left ** 5 mep ** * upyd ( ni ) : ex-socialdemocratic currently progressive populist center-right or something like that ( they changed ideology because there are too many left leaning party and almost no right wing , the leader lost the internal elections in the psoe ) . 
  ** 4 mep ** * ceu catalan conservative nationalist right ( udc with epp ) , catalan nationalist liberal right ( cdc with alde ) , basque nationalist right ( pnv with edp ) , conservative very corrupt canarian nationalist ( cc with efa ) : ** 3 mep ** * coalition epdd ( catalan independentist left coalition with efa ) : parties erc , necat , cat s\u00cd . 
  erc is ten times bigger than the others . 
  ** 2 mep ** * ciudadanos/ciutadans ( anti-independence catalan party ) : ** 1 mep ** * lpd ( with efa ) : basque independentist left eh bildu , galician nationalist left that says that it 's pro-sovereignty but not exactly pro-independence ) . 
  and some minor pro-independence parties from everywhere . 
  ** 1 mep ** * european spring ( egp ) : coalition of the spanish greens ( equo ) and social-democratic nationalists clearly no pro-independence . 
  compromis ( valencia ) , cha ( aragon ) and other small parties . 
  ** 1 mep ** ( the head of the list was valencian nationalist ) about podemos , the new guys : one of the founders of podemos is the former advisor of hugo chaves of economy [ juan carlos monedero ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fes.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fjuan_carlos_monedero&amp;edit-text= ) . 
  this is a bad signal for me . 
  but the people did n't care . 
  they promised everything : * basic income . 
  * higher pensions , minimum pension = minimum wage .
