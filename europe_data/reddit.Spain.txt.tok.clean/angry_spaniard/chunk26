  honestly , farming is 3 % of our economy , vehicle manufacturing  6 % and tourism 12 % . 
  but you are right . 
  the ruling party is sending the former agriculture minister to the eu and when the campaigns are n't talking about corruption , economy or catalonia and try to talk about eu stuff they only mention the cap . 
  you are missing ~ ~ chavismo ~ ~ [ xxi century socialism ] ( http://podemos.info/ ) . 
  i expect the popularity of the first one to be higher . 
   so how do spaniards feel about their future within europe ? 
  the future seems grim . 
  and a future outside the eu seems even worse . 
   do most people feel salvation lies in the current configuration of being members of the eu and the ez ? 
  do people want to leave these institutions , or do they want spain to stay in these institutions and just wait out the crisis ? 
  most of the people the people do n't care about these institutions honestly . 
  we sort of like them because we get more money than we put it , but that 's it . 
  most of the people the people think that the problems come from the spanish institutions ( specially certain nationalist that call spain madrid and talk in 3rd person about the spaniards ) even if they are asking to the eu to do something about them . 
   i guess i 'm trying to get a feel of the discussions taking place at the dinner table , or at a cafe or a pub . 
  in random order : football , corruption , unemployment , economy , government waste , shitty working conditions and precarious contracts , tv , sex ... 
  the countries that seem to be more eurosceptic seem to have better economies and some people vote to far right/anti-immigration parties . 
  spain does n't have any far right party in any regional or national parliament . 
  and nothing will be elected . 
  the only eurosceptic party in a regional parliament is the catalan pro-independence [ cup ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/popular_unity_candidates ) that defines itself as libertarian socialist and many other classic hard left things . 
  i would expect to be different from country to country . 
  the spanish people is disappointed with the eu but the people is even more disappointed with spain , and that 's being used very successfully by the independence movements . 
  some people blame the eu and ecb for the monetary policy too aligned with german interests . 
  but the spanish governments have made decisions and order of magnitude worse than the eu for our future than that . 
  edit : eurosceptic parties are n't going to be big here , and after the francoist dictatorship the far right either . 
  therefore we have independence movements and some new weird left-wing stuff like [ podemos ] ( http://podemos.info/ ) . 
  a mixture plebiscite about the corrupt conservative government that ca n't recover the economy and the catalan independence here . 
  the left has had an explosion of new political platforms that now are going in different candidature and trying to decide who should lead the anti-capitalist left . 
  like they would agree with an alternative . 
  germany wants them more than you . 
  why do they have to be your countrymen ? 
  the party that is ruling greece should qualify as populist right . 
  the stupid arms race with turkey with a 1/8 of the population the populist projects ( olympic games ) the generalized waste of money for buying supporters . 
  populist right is not the same as fascist . 
   i do n't know the solution , obviously we ca n't force them to stay , maybe western european countries should reevaluate their immigration policies . 
  maybe you should try . 
  or funding their education with * loans * that they have to pay if emigrate at least . 
  come on !, 
  everybody knows that it 's about oil money and fishing rights . 
  i am a catalan speaker myself , and i am from valencia . 
  despite my nick , spanish is n't my mother tongue .

  [ the current public information about how the shooting was done ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/05/16/inenglish/1400258487_919041.html ) and [ the history behind the shooting ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/05/15/inenglish/1400148015_425867.html )  montserrat triana mart\u00ednez , the daughter of the self-confessed killer , would have normally gone down as just one more anecdote for internal party consumption . 
  mart\u00ednez , a 35-year-old telecommunications engineer , wanted a professional and political career for herself under carrasco 's protection . 
  but something went wrong and she fell from grace , like so many others in the northern spanish province . 
   montserrat triana joined the provincial council on a personal recommendation , occupying a temporary position in a technical capacity . 
  she was qualified for the job thanks to her engineering degree from cantabria university . 
   she became a card-carrying member of the pp and ran in local elections in astorga in 2007 . 
  she was seventh on the party list and did n't make it as a councilor by just one position , but nobody was to blame for that . 
  what about the health care reform that is being approved ?
