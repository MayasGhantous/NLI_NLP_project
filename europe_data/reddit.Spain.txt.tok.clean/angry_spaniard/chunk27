  [ en ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/05/16/inenglish/1400232016_588758.html ) * talks about our underground economy , due to things like this : * police in valencia enter a small , shabby workshop in the old quarter of callosa de segura , a small town in the south of alicante , a region traditionally known for shoemaking . 
  inside they find eight women hunched over sewing machines , along with the husband and wife who own the premises . 
  * [ en ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/05/14/inenglish/1400071195_322476.html ) * the platform for the protection of the c\u00f3rdoba mosque is taking the case to the european court . 
  the fight between andalusian left and the catholic church for the control of the mosque will continue . 
  [ en ] ( http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news-spain/andalucia/the_platform_for_the_protection_of_the_c_rdoba_mosque_is_taking_the_case_to_the_european_court.shtml ) i did n't follow the news this week , i may add more stuff later . 
  feel free to complete . 
  extra : the spanish national police have arrested 740 people in their largest operation against fictitious companies . 
  [ en ] ( http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news-spain/national/the_national_police_have_arrested_740_people_in_their_largest_operation_against_fictitious_companies.shtml ), 
   i feel like that 's what the eu ( as in countries individually ) should focus on than - more wage equality . 
  we are moving in the opposite direction to increase our competitiveness . 
  [ this is the variation between 2008-2011 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aa9kpfe.png ) by deciles . 
   have any countries outside estonia and maybe slovenia had an increase in the average wage ? 
  poland , slovakia and germany have been doing ok . maybe them ? 
  the actual salaries for unskilled jobs already out-do university degrees jobs in eu countries . 
  check some salaries [ unskilled retail job ] ( http://www.payscale.com/research/ch/industry=retail/salary ) , compare with [ skilled jobs in romania ] ( http://www.payscale.com/research/ro/country=romania/salary ) . 
  even taking care of purchasing power there are salaries in unskilled jobs in switzerland higher than what skilled jobs earn at part of the eu . 
  90 % of the workers earn more than the proposal in switzerland . 
  it would be a high minimum wage for their economy , but it would n't be so extreme as some people say . 
  when is the vote ? 
  i am tired of hearing about this without real resolution . 
  edit : tomorrow , and it 's at the link . 
  in my defense : this has been sent a dozen of times without the date i expected that would be an article without date like all the others . 
   berlusconi was a danger berlusconi is going to be a danger until the day of his death . 
  this elections are about national politics and the future of spain ( or if it has a future ) . 
  european policies are in second plane . 
  some of the new parties that have these elections as their first serious national elections do n't even mention eu affairs . 
  what about crosspost to / r/mapporn ? 
  edit : probably unneeded given the answers . 
  a polish has called compatriota a spaniard . 
   just adding a bertolli label to a bottle of virgin olive oil from greece and spain , doubles its price . 
  and that despite the fact that [ italy is a net importer of oil ] ( http://www.olivarsantamaria.com/?blog=6&amp;articulo=30 ) . 
  most of the olive oil sold in the eu is from spain usually . 
  i think that romania is n't being so relevant as the media portraits . 
  we may have had a report about that here already , i think that the more relevant sources inside the eu were ( sort of random order ) : * poland * spain * italy * lithuania * ireland * portugal, 
  you can see the list of jobs [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/25di5p/isabel_carrasco_a_top_female_politician_in_the/chgaewl ) . 
  it includes being an * advisor * of two real estate agencies and being in the assembly of the regional saving bank that loaned to the agencies . 
  i would n't frame it like that because we know that she was killed [ by a member of her party ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/05/13/inenglish/1399970219_342953.html )  the younger detainee , triana mart\u00ednez , who was a member of the le\u00f3n popular party , was included on the party 's slate for the municipal elections in astorga in 2007 , but was not elected as councilor . 
  that same year she began working in the provincial council of le\u00f3n as a telecommunications engineer , assessing councils on matters related to high-speed internet and digital terrestrial television . 
  the suspects are this woman and her mother . 
  she lost a job that she had provisionally for the province during 7 years , becasue the council finally had to make a normal procedure to hire somebody permanent for the job and the more qualified candidate got the job , that was n't she despite being a party member and doing the job provisionally until the entrance exams were celebrated ( with a delay of years ) . 
  and the father/husband of the family is also a high officer of the police with strings to the ruling party . 
  the family is sort of wealthy and well connected . 
  not exactly common people . 
  it seems like a revenge , but like the less apropiated revenge ever . 
  -- edit : a more valid revenge would have been by the relatives of an 85 years old man that died because the leon municipal firefighters got instructions of no operate outside the limits of the city because the province is n't paying the service . 
  the provincial council of leon has cut its firefighters because austerity , despite its resposible of the service in all the populations with less than 20,000 inhabitants ; and there are only two as big . 
  and it 's not even paying municipalities for the services that their firefighters have done since then .

  the regional saving bank was ruined with shady operations in real estate that had her support . 
  i think that her corruption is very likely . 
  that 's supported by the right in spain , and opposed by the united left . 
  we have strong family networks at spain . 
  my uncle 52 years old uncle is living with my grandparents and if/when they die he will probably move to live with my parents that are employed ( for now ) . 
  there is social unrest , of course , but the situation would have to become way worse to be serious . 
  i have said :  i have n't seen the underground economy growing , more like the opposite actually , like all the economy . 
  it maybe it 's my english , i am saying that all the economy tanked including the underground . 
  i have n't seen growth . 
  valencian here . 
  i am spaniard , and i have n't seen the underground economy growing , more like the opposite actually , like all the economy . 
  it was bigger 6 years ago . 
  edit : i know that it exists but fuck , it has been always there . 
  my grandmother made trouser illegally in dictatorship times . 
  with full-employment . 
  i also heard that explanation often . 
  the submerged economy exists , but it has a similar size or even smaller than 6 years ago . 
  all that illegal construction activity is n't here anymore . 
  the same problem as 6 years ago when we had 8 % of unemployment . 
  the underground economy is also depressed . 
  why is so fucking popular denying that there is unemployment in spain ? 
  can you back those statements ? 
  i am getting tired of the people that insist that in that there is n't real unemployment in spain . 
  it is not a problem that was a joke . 
  obvious problems of this submission , * op is lacking a flair ( i encourage you to get one ) * you should indicate that it 's in spanish and provide a translation or a link to google translate . 
  * i know that it 's the original headline . 
  but , we also know that the press lacks ethics . 
  that 's the number of jobless that do n't get unemployment benefits . 
  but , 600,000 of them get other benefits according to the government . 
  beside that . 
  is 4 millions high or low ? 
  that 's low for a country like the usa and impossible for estonia , and an international reader may ignore details about the demographics features of spain . 
  a think that a better headline would be that only a third of the jobless get unemployment benefits ; or that less than half of the jobless get any benefits . 
  maybe i think too much . 
   the younger detainee , triana mart\u00ednez , who was a member of the le\u00f3n popular party , was included on the party 's slate for the municipal elections in astorga in 2007 , but was not elected as councilor . 
  isabel carrasco is also a member of that party . 
  she has been probably killed for reasons related with her actions as overlord of le\u00f3n , but it 's not for ideological reasons , that for sure . 
  that happened this week , this monday . 
  it was a massacre . 
  they 've just killed : * leon 's popular party president . 
  * leon 's provincial council president . 
  * leon 's culture institution 's president . 
  * leon 's provincial garbage management consortium 's president . 
  * a leon 's town councilor . 
  * a caja espa\u00f1a ( government managed non profit bank ) adviser . 
  * a caja espa\u00f1a 's shareholder assembly adviser . 
  * an adviser for 2 real estate agencies . 
  * invergestion 's ( investment management firm ) vicepresident . 
  this is almost genocide . 
  -- [ source ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/25di5p/isabel_carrasco_a_top_female_politician_in_the/chgaewl ), 
  there are politics around it , about separation of church and state and certain conflicts . 
  the building become property of the catholic church paying a fee of 30 euros , because the church has been using the building the last 700 years but they were 'n' t the owner until 2006 .
