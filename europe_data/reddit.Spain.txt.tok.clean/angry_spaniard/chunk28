  they do n't seem able to actually remove them . 
  they did n't succeed , kosovo and bosnia are full of kebabs . 
  ^ ( not like spain ), 
  i want to remember that occitan is different enough language , no a set of dialects of french . 
  you may say that of the langues d'oil . 
  for spain i would say that the only languages that can die are : * aragonese language : 10,000 of speakers . 
  mostly spoken in some pyrenees valleys by old people in areas without many jobs or opportunities . 
  there is n't media in aragonese , the language does n't hava a good health . 
  and it 's under the presure of a very strong language without having a nationalist movement supporting it . 
  * aranese dialect of occitan : 5,000 of speakers . 
  it may seem more endangered , but . 
  it has been declared official for all catalonia that it 's protecting the language . 
  65 % of the inhabitants of the val d'aran speak the language . 
  and occitan is sort of a bigger language than aragonese . 
  in addition the valley has better economy ( baqueira-beret ) and they are transmiting the language more often to the new generations . 
  however , i expect the language to decline more . 
  it 's under strong presure of spanish and catalan and occitan is ~ ~ being killed ~ ~ dying in france .

  [ according to latest figures ] ( http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/np838_en.pdf ) we have 5,000,258 foreign residents that represent 10.7 of the population, 
  i think that we would leave the nato . 
  edit : if somebody is into increasing spending we are scrapping an aircraft carrier . 
  [ it 's only 25 years old ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_aircraft_carrier_pr%c3%adncipe_de_asturias ) , it could be used another 20 years . 
  they can have it . 
  would you like to reach the level where you build more homes than uk , france and germany together ? 
  and the housing sector with auxiliary industry is 20 % of your economy . 
  what i am meaning is that even if your economy is growing like crazy it can be a stupid collective craziness that can end with the country in horrible situation that can be fixed within the eurozone framework . 
   it creates jobs in exports and creates jobs in domestic businesses if imports get to expensive it has more advantages the debts also devalue ( like the savings ) . 
  i think that it can be beneficial when most of the private sector is in massive debts and half of the mortgages are underwater . 
  not that i am thinking in any particular country . 
  exactly like spain 1996-2007, 
  [ spain also had < 40 % debt to gdp in 2007 ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=ds22a34krhq5p_#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=gd_pc_gdp&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:eu:non-eu&amp;idim=country:es&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=es&amp;dl=es&amp;ind=false ) , you will be surprised about how fast the ratio rises when your economy disappears , half of your financial sector goes to bankruptcy and millions move from generate income to ask for benefits . 
  it does n't count it will be in one of his drunken stupors . 
  spain can veto that recognition of the declaration of independence . 
  the eu does n't recognize kosovo thanks to spain , romania and greece . 
  despite strong majority supporting it . 
  and that means ? 
  a strongly worded letter ? 
  i have the same situation and honestly the spanish social-democractic party is to disorganized crime what the conservative is to organized crime . 
  i would likely vote to the coalition of center-left nationalists parties and the green party ( equo ) . 
  the spanish constitution authorizes the spanish government to use the army to stop the independence of parts of the country . 
  i do n't know who would be considered the aggressor if the spanish government uses its constitutional powers to recover sovereignty over catalonia . 
  we are living interesting times . 
  let 's hope that we do n't go full yugoslavia . 
   unfucked not actually , the economy is still dead . 
  we may want to care about this point sooner or later . 
  seasonal employment is big , but it 's mildy spread between the ~ ~ years ~ ~ seasons . 
  from picking olives , grapes , oranges , spain has also some winter tourism with skiing resorts like baqueira beret at the val d'aran . 
  the seasonal differnce at a normal year would be around 300-400 thousand .
