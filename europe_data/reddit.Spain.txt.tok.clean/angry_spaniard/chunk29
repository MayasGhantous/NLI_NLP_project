  you can see the eu-standard data without seasonal adjustment [ here ] ( http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/epa_tabla_en.htm ) ( three months interval , the unemployment service has less reliable monthly data ) . 
   it drives me crazy when the media and the government use the employment growth of ** 4,000 new jobs ** as this major accomplishment are you sure that we are having net creation of jobs ? 
  [ according to the epa ] ( http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/epa_tabla_en.htm ) we are at the lowest point since 2002 . 
  if you read only the social security figures may seem different because the new public servants ca n't choose muface and there is less and less people in the isfas ( social security-like for the army only ) . 
  including everything the total is still falling .

  a person is defined as active if it 's working or looking for a job . 
  sweden is the country with the highest activity rate in the eu ( but lower than switzerland or iceland ) and croatia has the lowest one ( but higher than turkey ) . 
  it 's interesting comparing this with the unemployment figures . 
  edit : i am sending a link that does n't make spain look specially bad , at least our jobless are registered and looking for jobs ( i am looking at you italy the same rate of people working but 12.7 % of unemployment only ) , even if there are n't jobs . 
  sweden has the highest rate active population of all the eu ( the rate of people working or looking for jobs ) . 
  spain has 74 % and croatia has 60 % . 
  [ source ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=lfsq_argan&amp;lang=en ) for me this means that the country with the worst labour market is croatia and not greece , and that italy has the same rate of employed people as spain . 
  but they have low unemployment somehow . 
  but i do n't see anything to distrust sweden . 
  it 's falling , do n't worry . 
  \\ - [ spanish government ] ( http://i.imgur.com/luusp4b.jpg ) ^ ( tm ) -- actually , the number of employed people keeps falling . 
  but [ the active population is falling more quickly ] ( http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/epa_tabla_en.htm ) the problems are here already . 
  being catholic in spain is not like in other countries . 
  yes , i have . 
  anyway , i do n't feel like talking about morality in english . 
  a lot of people has lost everything gambling . 
  i have moral problems with the two extreme outcomes of gambling not only that : * somebody loses everything and ruines his family . 
  * somebody gets wealthy without any effort . 
  but , it 's barely after dinner !, 
  when did we get used to this !? 
  the number of employed people [ has fallen bellow 17 millions ] ( http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/epa_tabla_en.htm ) , we need to go back to 2002 to see figures like this !! . 
  the only reason why the unemployment has stopped growing is because the emigration is starting to outpace the job destruction . 
  the rules are in the [ law that the dictatorship approved in 1964 ] ( https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=boe-a-1964-7524l ) . 
   to reward extraordinary services performed by the public servants working for the government police  if the ** people ** awarded these decorations do not belong to the corporation specified in the first paragraph of this article , they may grant the same , either with entirely honorific or assigning any of the annual pension specified in the fifth article of the decree of june 18 of 1943 , as granted the award , and as determined in the order of grant . 
  the dictatorship was confessional catholic , but they did n't even think in this situation . 
  they simply wrote a normal law for giving medals that assumes that the medals are for humans only . 
  edit : and using the highest medal available for the security forces in some cheap pandering for the catholic vote before eu elections sounds plainly stupid . 
  these are the requirements for the medal : a ) be injured while on duty or in connection therewith , without prejudice to the honor , nor imprudence , or accident . 
  b ) participate in three or more services , which , upon assault weapons , at the circumstances of the previous section , where the official was injured . 
  c ) conduct , in circumstances of danger to his person , a devoted fact or one that evidences a high bravery on the official and prestige to the corporation or utility for the service . 
  d ) engaging in conduct that does not fully meet the conditions required for the award of the medal of police merit , deserve special reward , in consideration of distinguished and extraordinary events in which a risk has become apparent or personal danger . 
  has the virgin mary risked her life since 1964 in a successful action for the security of the spaniards ? 
  it 's the basic requirement for the medal . 
  despite the music [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o77g6yvv3t8 ) is informative . 
  i think that the only people that would fit in that requirement in spain are the inhabitants of the [ val d'aran ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/val_d%27aran ) more than 30 % speak natively their dialect of occitan/language that has been so infuenced by catalan and spanish that is difficult to understand for native speakers of occitan but it 's still difficult to understand for other catalan people . 
  and still you do n't answer my questions . 
  you do n't make people that is fleeing war turn go back with words . 
  you did n't answer to my questions . 
   hello , yes but someone has to finance that . 
  around 1 % of the population is collecting non-contributory benefits including disabled people . 
  are you seriously pretending that this is what wrecking the spanish economy ? 
  despite the fact that most of western europe has more people collecting non-contributory benefits and expending more on welfare ? 
  edit : you have a duplicated comment . 
  spain pays a pension of 5,122.60 euros/year to retirees that do n't qualify for a full pension that life in households with an income per capita lower than that figure . 
  and the total income with their housband/wife is under $ 8,708.42 . 
  what would you do with them ? 
  what 's done in your country ? 
  it is n't a reference to the romans . 
  it 's a reference to a reference to the romans . 
  it 's a reference to [ this article ] ( http://www.segundarepublica.com/index.php?opcion=7&amp;id=36 ) from ortega y gasset . 
  \u00a1 reconstruidlo !, 
  ( spaniards , your state does n't exist !, 
  rebuild it !, 
  i use that line from the article , if it is an error it 's not mine . 
  the article is great from title :  ** el error belenguer ( the mistake belenguer ) ** belenguer was the militar that alfonso xiii appointed to head his government after the fall of the dictatorship of  no , it is n't an errata.it is likely that the future books of spain 's history will have a chapter with the same title . 
  because the appointment of a general as head of the new government with the mission of restoring the double single party system and the anti-democratic 1876 constitution was the error . 
  belenguer himself was the error . 
  the chapter that explains the fall of the spanish monarchy in spain 's history books is usually called like that . 
  the city is full of drunk , divorced , unemployed expats , who use their whole day complaining about how bad norway is . 
  they never leave though . 
  if my experience means something they were doing the same in their home country . 
  it 's easier to change the country where you live that who you are . 
  the us does n't actually demonizes immigrants . 
  some politics try but their society is more welcoming than the uk . 
  if it makes you feel better you are more welcoming than france . 
  remember that the reforms that generated this system happened 5-10 years ago , the people who was convicted before these reforms are getting out . 
  spain tried to increase prison terms retroactively but [ the decission has been overrun by the echr recently ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24606155 ) . 
  edit : spain has also a [ very big police force ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1g9y8s/number_of_police_officers_per_100_000_inhabitants/ ) and a low ( in my opinion ) crime rate . 
  the new penal code was approved in 2006 that means that we are n't seen a lot of people in prison more than 18 years until 2024 . 
   are such sentences common in spain ? 
  this needs some context the ruling party is being investigated for their rampant ilegal financing between 1991 and 2008 . 
  and the treasurer in these years is currently in preventive jail . 
  the pm is n't being charged because he said that he discovered the illegal financing by the press and the judge and the prosecutor decided believe him . 
  part of the money that the party collected 45 million euros has been found in switzerland .
