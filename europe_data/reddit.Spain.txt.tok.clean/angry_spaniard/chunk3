  it 's more similar to syriza with a touch of 21th century socialism ( that horrible venezuelan thing ) . 
   actually , a left-wing coalition is by far the most likely outcome , even though negotiations between podemos and the socialist party would be tense , to say the least . 
  why would the psoe negotiate with podemos when their interests and political positions are way closer to the pp ? 
   he still has to overcome the resistance of the party 's regional barons , and meanwhile podemos is siphoning off all young militants . 
  he was backed by the most powerful one from andalusia . 
  and pedro s\u00e1nchez is part of what is wrong in politics . 
  we do n't have any reason to think that he will be different from rajoy as pm or will be doing different politics or less corruption .

  ** catalan : ** [ l'estaca ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1ozxr3emd4 ) ( the stake ) by lluis llach with english lyrics ( with some errors ) . 
  this was an important song for the opposition of the francoist dictatorship . 
  probably there are more appropriated songs for this thread , but this two came to my head . 
  where do we get these users ? 
  who the hell upvotes their links ? 
  less than two years ? 
  sure !, 
   you said it yourself . 
  do you mean that we would be better with a dictatorship ? 
   and it 's funny that you mention university when we have shit tons of people thinking they are entitled to a well paid job just because they sat there for four years . 
  that 's not the point , sending children to the university was expensive . 
  and they were able to do that . 
  and even if it 's not a well paid job they expect at least a job like their parents had . 
  many people with college degree in their 30s can not afford to have children , do n't talk about sending them to university . 
   but of course , only ~ 15 % of those would be willing to take the risk of starting a business in the medium-term , because we all know that avoiding responsibility and shifting blame is always easier . 
  starting a business without contacts , capital and experience in the sector is a very big risk . 
  or simply impossible in many sectors . 
  in others is simply saturated . 
  2/3 of the new business that i have seen start in the last 5 years were bars . 
  despite that there were too many already and now there are less than 5 years ago . 
   are you implying that people lived better under franco 's dictatorship ? 
  or that more than 20 % of the population was n't under the poverty line ? 
  or that everyone had access to education when plenty of elders did n't even get to finish basic schooling ? 
  elemental education become universal in the 60s , and the university education acccess was universal at the 80s with more than 20 % of unemployment and way less productive jobs for the employed than now . 
  i am implying that we are moving the society in a direction were simply the people does n't want to go . 
  and our society has serious long term problems like birth rate that are n't solved becoming more competitive . 
  and we have terrible figures of [ childhood poverty ] ( http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/2274416/0/espana/tercer-pais-pobreza-infantil/unicef/ ) . 
  the only worse in the eu are latvia and greece . 
  that 's real . 
   wow ... get real dude . 
  i was overacting , but i do n't think that i am the one that needs to get real . 
  spain is a country with a gdp per capita of $ 24.000 per capita . 
  not a third world economy . 
  is n't that enough for having a population that lives in dignity ? 
  if we continue with austerity , making the fiscal system more regressive and worsening labour position i have to believe that the situation will get better ? 
  because that sound like a lot of crap for me . 
  most of the jobs are n't skilled . 
   if we talk about low skill jobs then well ... you ca n't expect to have stable well paid jobs when you 're 100 % expendable , that 's completely foolish . 
  well paid is relative , and my grandparents had a stable job live in a fucking dictatorship without significant skills . 
  they bought houses and raised children that went to universities and were able to live stable lives in the same area . 
  are you telling that what was possible with less of a third of the current gdp per capita is not possible now !? 
  then what 's the fucking point of being a rich country if the people ca n't live better ? 
  if being a rich country means more poverty and personal instability always moving changing jobs and homes , not being able to have childrens i do n't want spain to be a rich country . 
  [ podemos ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/podemos ) will be happy . 
   the big problem with these kind of arrangements is that some get them while others do n't . 
  was there any legal requirement to set the rent so low ? 
  there was , but you are right in that this does n't work with a 25 % of unemployment . 
  there were requirements but there were 10 times more people that needed the housing that housing . 
  now everybody is equal !, 
  no subsidized housing to anybody !, 
   the problem is n't with income levels , it is with the distribution of income well , i think that two mean workers should be able to buy a mean house and have it paid with a third of their income in 30 years . 
  and that is not true . 
  despite all the empty housing . 
  however , spain is n't the worse country in that sense anymore ( sweden would be the worse in that these days ) . 
   to solve this you need to dismantle over protective labor laws . 
  that 's another problem . 
  ok , now what .
