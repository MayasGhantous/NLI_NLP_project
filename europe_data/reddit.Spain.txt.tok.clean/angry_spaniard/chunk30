  and rumours are that the treasurer gave some confidential information to her wife . 
  it seems like the guy tied the older son of the treasurer , his wife and a servant pointed them with a handgun ( using a handgun in any crime in spain adds ten years of prison even if you do n't shot ) asking them to hand him all the confidential information . 
  and we are talking about a family of a man who has been the [ nucky thomson ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enoch_l._johnson ) of spain twenty years , at least of the conservative party , even if he is now in prison and has lost most of his power you do n't mess with somebody like him . 
   how much would he get if he murdered someone ? 
  30 years of prison in that context , for every murdered person . 
  the maximum time in prison in spain for non-members of eta ( our laws are like that ) is 30 years for eta members is 40 ( disputed in the eurpean court of human rights , and it 's only for eta members convicted after 2005 ) . 
  the sentence reductions for work , reinsertion or whatever are calculated for all the total term for people convicted after 2008 and for the 30 years for convicted before that . 
  we had an hysterical period with crime those years even if the actual crime rate was one of the lowest in our history . 
  and that was the * solution * . 
  we have a very high incarceration rate . 
  we are also putting people in [ prison for speeding or driving drunk ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.europapress.es%2fsociedad%2fnoticia-fiscal-pide-alternativas-carcel-reincidentes-delitos-trafico-20120924162349.html&amp;edit-text= ) . 
   the 2007 reform introduced road safety offenses against the criminal code fired the number of people admitted to prison for such crimes to more than 900 prisoners in 2010 . 
  nevertheless , a later amendment to the penal code , rush in 2010 , that eased the penalties , allowing judges choose alternative sentences to prison , as the fine or work to benefit the community , has reduced the number of inmates in prisons to 771 in december 2011 . 
  except for all the conservative-liberal moderate nationalist people in basque country and catalonia that after decades of being grumpy but ok with the status of their countries become radically pro-independence . 
  the ruling nationalist coalition at catalonia was against independence until 2011 . 
   i 'm curious , what convinced you not to vote for him ? 
  * the messianic campaign , with pictures of himself everywhere . 
  * he did primaries in his freshly created party , but he was the only candidate . 
  and because that all the other candidates will be appointed by him * the arrogance and lies . 
  * his behavior in interviews .

  the teachers are selected by the catholic church , but paid by the government . 
  it 's catholic religion , in ceuta and melilla the government also pays teachers of an official version of islam .

  that in public building with people paid by the government . 
  you know separation of church and state and that other shit .

   i do n't have to pay for electricity if i 'm not using it , right ? 
  you have to pay fixed fees and the electrecity that you use . 
  there are fixed terms for contracted power and the * rental * of the electricity counter . 
  do n't worry about different companies since we liberalized the market all the companies charge the same . 
  [ an example ] ( https://www.iberdrola.es/clientes/hogar/info/factura/factura-electricidad ) for two months . 
  total $ 102.28 total . 
  go to the fixed costs then : * $ 1.81 for renting the electricity meter . 
  * $ 30.55 of contracted power ( 4.6 kw ) * $ 1.56 electricity tax ( 5.1127 % ) * $ 7.12 sales taxes ( 21 % ) . 
  33.9219 total : ** 41,01 euros ** every two months whatever you use electricty or no . 
  the spanish average has been < 1 % , but 2.3 % in valencia , my region . 
  no , i was saying that because / u/paludosa2 sent an [ article ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/23raqk/end_to_mediterranean_dream_for_90000_britons_who/ ) about this already . 
  ^ ( i live in sweden actually . ), 
  why are you call gamberro ? 
  linking the official press release because british press is looking only at themselves . 
  i sort of agree with you . 
  i think that many of them thought that they were buying legal real estate . 
  i mean . 
  would you expect something like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jaipzpn.jpg ) to be illegal ? 
  the problem is when some people translates that to : `` we should n't allow muslims and black people to live in our country . 
  the population of spain has fallen 400,000 people !, 
  your headline can work for british press , but not for an international level ( or for an spaniard at least ) that 's more important . 
   the departure of immigrants saw the total resident in spain slide from 47,129,783 to 46,725,164 . 
  btw :  `` many people no longer wish to stay in spain because of the never-ending fight to legalise their properties . 
  or they can stop buying illegal homes . 
  why ? 
  we have our own , the conservative party is to organized crime what the social-democratic is the disorganized one . 
  [ they have been seriously chased ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/01/25/inenglish/1359129285_206640.html ) !, 
  we already have an expert in corruption as pm . 
  what else is needed ? 
  my questions for debate : one point that we should n't miss is that catalonia does n't have any way within the spanish legal framework to declare independence . 
  if catalonia wants to be independent its government must break the spanish laws . 
  what do you think that it 's more likely ? 
  catalonia stops seeking independence 2 . 
  catalonia seeks independence within the legality and never gets it . 
  catalonia breaks the law . 
  and what would do the spanish government in the last scenario : 1 . 
  * police intervention , martial law , direct administration of catalonia and her 8 million inhabitants . 
  accept it . 
  pretend that it did n't happen , ignore the declaration of independence and keep the current status quo . 
  ( this would be very typical from rajoy ), 
  username : angry_spaniard . 
  nothing else to say . 
  not all the poor immigrants are unskilled . 
  hey , not only jobless . 
  i was employed in my country and i migrated anyway . 
  but also in spain . 
   so while he managed to swindle them out of 500,000 temporarily , they would still be able to recover almost all of that money after the fact . 
  no you can check it even in [ the wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enric_duran ) this happened 5 years ago .
