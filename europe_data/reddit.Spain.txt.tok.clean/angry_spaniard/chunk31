  he even used all the money in printing magazines . 
   i really respect this guy , and it \u00b4 s a powerful symbolic gesture regardless of the practical consequences . 
  i am not sure if i respect him . 
  i mean put himself in a lot of trouble , but he does n't accomplished anything . 
  and he was 33 when he did that . 
   if spanish insolvency law is anything like the dutch or french , this simply does n't work it doesn ' work because this does n't solve anything . 
  however , it worked because he managed to seize 500,000 euros . 
  it 's illegal of course , but that 's another question . 
  the guy has been already 2 months in prison ( before being bailed out and fleeing ) and he is facing 8 years of prison .

  spanish monarchy . 
  he may want to have a corrupt drunk womanizer as head of state for life , like us . 
  and the fact that we are giving partial immunity to the crown prince makes me think that the new generations are as bad as the current one . 
  i personally think that the other corrupt cronies have to win elections at least . 
  * independent justice and police to fight the corruption . 
  * a efficient r&d system even if it 's not better funded . 
  * non-endogamic universities that do n't rig the oppositions to hire people that did the phd inside the university . 
  * education and training for long term jobless . 
  * a conservative party without dictatorship nostalgic people , that does n't work as organized crime if posible . 
  * a liberal party that is n't catalan nationalist . 
  * a new social democratic party would be nice also , the current one is too weak , divided , corrupt and without any project . 
  * a project as a nation that can generate thrill , that 's something that catalonia has , but not spain . 
  and that 's a fucking big problem . 
  not only due to the catalan nationalism . 
  if was nationalist i would be spanish nationalism . 
  but i am starting to think that the balcanization of spain is n't a bad idea if the country is going to stay as it is otherwise . 
  the two big parties screaming that everything is ok and nothing should change in the country does n't help . 
  * the only three sectors that are doing ok in our economy are tourism , assemble foreign cars and farming . 
  if your economy has any sector that it is n't housing/real estate doing ok i want that also for spain . 
  edit : a republic , obviously . 
  do you think that you have a serious problem with that ? 
  so cute !, 
  spain is country culturally catholic . 
  that does n't mean that the people believes in god or believes catholic church bullshit . 
  according to [ a poll from some years ago ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.publico.es%2fespana%2f186215%2fla-fe-espanola-hace-aguas&amp;edit-text= )  even among these `` catholics '' 25 % claiming not to believe in god ( and 20 % doubt their existence ) ,, 
   no , i meant it as a completely voluntary opt in opt out policy like uneployment . 
  if you work , you get benefits ( that make you more competitive than other companies ) , if you do n't you only get money . 
  i think that i do n't understand what you mean  your whole population is 50 milion , think about it , it 's like every person including children recieve 200 euros each month . 
  something is wrong . 
  the whole population is more like 46 millions . 
  the number of retirees is [ 8.3 millions ] ( http://www.seg-social.es/internet_1/estadistica/est/pensiones_y_pensionistas/series_de_pensiones_en_vigor_y_pensionistas/estc_005257 ) . 
  the mean income for pensioner is 14328 euros/year , before taxes . 
  the mean salary is 22.500 euros/year and the median 18.500 euros/year for giving context . 
  the pensions go from a minimum of around 7,000 euros to a maximum of 40,000 . 
  the percentatge of gdp is near 11 % of the gdp , similar to the eu average ( italy is 15 % and uk 7.7 % for example ) . 
   so 40 billion in administrative bureaucracy ? 
  i am so sorry man , i would pity you if i did n't think that my government would be worse if people had enough money . 
  what ??? 
  no , why do you say that ? 
  the regional governments administrate the education , and health care for example . 
  the spanish government is mostly pensions , unemployment , tax collection and redistribution , almost everything else is transfered . 
  what are you doing there portugal ? 
   so 66 % of your budget is financed by 55 % of actual workers ? 
  may you explain this ? 
  not all the population is working as you may know . 
   i would give them tax breaks , motivate them to go into liberal jobs or even start companies in exchange for opting out of the pension for the time they are self employed . 
  that would be problematic , because nobody will stay in and would hope that if everything goes south the government will take care of them . 
  and there is another problem , the pension for somebody that has paid the minimum 36 years is 550 $ / month for some elder that has n't paid anything and does n't have any income ( legally at least ) there is a check of 450 euros . 
  the incentive for paying the minimum is very low . 
  most of the self-employee are already paying the legal minimum and skipping the unemployment insurance . 
  if their business does n't work like most of the time happens , they end often without income and asking for some kind of basic welfare . 
   in parallel i would audit all pensioners and the minister of social issues because there is a certainly fraud here and i am certain it is there for several decades . 
  why would you think that ? 
  i mean , there are many companies that try to avoid payments to the pension system of course . 
  the number two of the employers association [ has been convicted ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/01/14/inenglish/1358183883_085848.html ) for that at least twice . 
  the only fraud that seems widespread is people and companies trying to pay less that they should more than people collecting more than they should . 
   also what the hell is transfer to other administrations ? 
  is it exclusively administrative costs because it seems huge and vague . 
  it 's money that the central government transfers to regional and local governments and the eu . 
  it 's vague , the retrieving institution handles it . 
  the most expensive part of the education is regionalized : schools and universities are managed by the regional governments . 
  that 's the budget of the [ uned ] ( http://portal.uned.es/portal/page?_pageid=93,24305391,93_24305392&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=portal ) ( national online university ) , student grants , scholarships , erasmus program and that stuff . 
  taking that into account , the national budget has been axed like that . 
  the regional budgets have seen more moderate cuts . 
  edit : the health care is regionalized also . 
   at this point is would suspend all worker taxation could you define worker taxation ? 
  if you are including social security and mandatory unemployment insurance with the income tax you are talking about two thirds of the income of the state . 
   cut central govermental spending drasticly that part is easy . 
  where would you cut ? 
  [ you can see the evolution of th last budgets in spanish ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=es&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fgraficos.lainformacion.com%2fespana%2fen-que-gasta-espana_goknxnskes9pthknt1yds5%2f ) things that are n't translated : * cit sec .

  pen : prison system .

   their unions are too strong .
