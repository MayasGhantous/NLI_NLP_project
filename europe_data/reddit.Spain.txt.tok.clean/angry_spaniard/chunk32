  if the unions are so strong why we had the three labour market reforms and the pension system reform that the imf and ceoe ( spanish business cartel ) required ?

  the spanish government launches the plan e in may of 2009 * 1,180,000 more jobless * dramatic unemployment spreads all over spain . 
  soria multiplied its unemployment by 2.2 . 
  some provinces like almeria , soria and salamanca saw small interanual falls in unemployment .

  that 's one of the problems that you can solve with one devaluation . 
  actually . 
  the things did n't get better in greece . 
  [ check figures ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z8o7pt6rd5uqa6_#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:sa&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:eu:non-eu&amp;idim=country:el:es&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=es&amp;dl=es&amp;ind=false ) the problem is the north-south divide in spain . 
  greece is more uniform . 
  you should know about countries with that situation . 
  we ca n't be sure about that . 
  it has been very bad . 
  i thought that it happened anyway . 
   whichever way you look at it , option b was by far the better choice are we saying this even after all that has happened ? 
  seriously ? 
  many countries do n't have liberal parties . 
  spain has only the party leading the current catalan government , converg\u00e8ncia democr\u00e0tica de catalunya . 
  they are in a coalition with the basque moderate conservative nationalist ( pnv ), 
   a recent public opinion research found that only 27 % czechs thinks eu is effective , 41 % thinks eu is democratic and 22 % thinks eu knows what they are doing . 
  these numbers are somewhat lower than last year . 
  what 's the czechs opinion about the czech republic . 
  if you ask to spaniards the eu figures are similar but the national figures are like half of that . 
  spain may try to sell them again . 
  spain has a license to build leopard tanks .

   or is this scenario just not possible ? 
  that 's not legal with the current laws and 86 % of the spanish parliament would vote against that .
