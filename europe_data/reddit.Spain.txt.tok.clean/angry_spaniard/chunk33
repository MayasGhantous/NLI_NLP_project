  eyebrows !!?? 
   so can i ask what are ( of there are any ) the main threats to the language/culture ? 
  the elephant in the room is that spanish is one of the biggest languages by a long shot , and way more cultural material is produced in spanish than in catalan . 
  and almost everything that is produced in other languages is translated to spanish and not to catalan . 
  beside that , the catalan-speaking regions have been way more prosperous that the rest of spain except valencia lately . 
  therefore , we have been getting a lot of immigration from the rest of spain . 
  and the spanish governments specially the dictatorship saw this immigration waves as a tool to culturally assimilate us . 
  and since we got self-government . 
  catalonia has had strong policies to assimilate the immigration and to integrate them in the catalan culture . 
  not so much in valencia and balearic islands in a middle term . 
  fast-forward catalan is a minority language actually in most of my region and balearic islands . 
  the spokeman of the cup ( pro-independence party ) david fern\u00e0ndez is a 2nd generation * immigrant * . 
  however , i am not sure if i care about the survival of the language and specific features of our culture . 
  i think that most of valencian people does n't see a problem in that . 
  so cute . 
  is that actually true in germany ? 
  still spanish republic . 
  they are n't being kicked out they will stay renting illegally or living in the house of other immigrants . 
  they are losing the access to german benefits , but they are n't being kicked out . 
  yep , riot police doing what the government wants them to do . 
  i felt like a spaniard who is n't from catalonia had to talk ill about our riot police and our government . 
  there is also the employment rate uk and france have similar gdp per capita with very different [ employment rates ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/7/74/employment_rate_persons_aged_15-64%2c_2012.png ) however the productivity for worked hour is similar in uk and germany , but the cost seem lower in uk . 
  i have been looking at eurostat figures . 
  i may be exaggerating but i do n't think so . 
  all the taxes involved ( corporate taxes , and natural resources taxes ) are exclusive of the central government ( except in basque country and navarre ) , and all the possible costs and risk are in things that have to be paid by local and regional administrations . 
  the government has n't actually proposed anything , that was the exaggeration , rajoy is never so clear . 
  they have said that the laws will be applied and that everything is being done according to law . 
  but , they have n't addressed one single concern or offered something specific to calm the people . 
  or do you think that somebody as corrupt as paulino rivero [ would be against the petroleum extraction ] ( http://www.lasexta.com/programas/mas-vale-tarde/entrevistas/paulino-rivero-petroleo-canarias-naturaleza-mayor-riqueza_2014021000330.html ) if his government gets a cut ?
