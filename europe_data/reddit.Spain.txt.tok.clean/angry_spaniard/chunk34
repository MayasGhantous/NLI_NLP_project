   if you live in a market economy , there 's nothing stopping you from starting a business and doing the work yourself . 
  i would n't get paid for it . 
  the existence of demand does n't mean anything if the people that has the demand does n't have the resources for paying for the costs . 
   if the gap in services is so obvious , you should have no problem convincing investors . 
  what 's the business case of providing care service for elderly people without resources . 
  i know many in that situation . 
  the minimum pension for people that did n't work enoug years is 5,058 $ / year . 
  that 's not enough for living anywhere in spain . 
  what 's the business case of giving them services ? 
   but i do n't understand why you going to leverage a house purchase with a bankloan if you understand or no does n't matter . 
  it already happened . 
  the millions of families that dedicate half of their income to pay mortgages of houses that are n't worth what they paid already exists . 
  [ and the loan default rate is already over 13 % ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/02/18/inenglish/1392718714_038584.html ) . 
  and the spanish default law does n't remove the debts even if you have lost all your patrimony . 
  the debts are for life in spain . 
  this does n't happens in vacuum . 
  it happens with a population and companies with extremely high debts that the deflation is going to make even bigger . 
  if your salary and the value of your house fall a 5 % you still have to pay the same mortgage payments and you are losing purchasing power and you ca n't sell it to pay your remaining mortgage ( homes have had an average fall of price of 32 % according to the government and 37 % according to real state agents ) . 
  the devaluation its going to maker harder to get rid of the debts . 
  shut up and gib oil monies and access to fisheries !, 
  we are n't going to stop asking until you do . 
  [ russians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russians_in_estonia )  the population of russians in estonia is estimated at 320,000 . 
  most russians live in estonia 's capital city tallinn and the major northeastern cities of narva and kohtla-j\u00e4rve . 
  some areas in eastern estonia near lake peipus have a centuries-long history of settlement by russians , including the old believers ' communities . 
   in may 2009 , the population register reported that 7.6 % of residents have undefined citizenship and 8.4 % have foreign citizenship , mostly russian . 
  many russians have gotten the estonian citizenship , but not all of them . 
  fear for [ aragonese ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aragonese_language ) . 
  the spanish government would make the things go wrong to scare the basque . 
  more private debt is becoming public debt . 
  yeah !, 
  and le\u00f3n is pushing for the breakup of the region of [ castille and leon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/castile_and_le%c3%b3n ) not for independence . 
  and valencia and aragon do n't have actually independence movements . 
  i am from valencia and i can tell that valencia has only like is a 1 % that wants to be part of the independent catalan countries , but nobody wants an independent valencia alone . 
  and i think that balearic islands is the same . 
  the situation in basque country is similar to the catalan 3 years ago : center-right pro-sovereignty no pro-independence ( that 's a real thing ) government and there is a smaller pro-independence left wing party . 
  and like in catalonia the conservative nationalist that always rule the basque country are pushing for a reform of their home rule , but not independence . 
  i wonder if the spanish government will give the same answer that they gave to catalonia when they asked for having fiscal sovereignty like the basque have already . 
  [ however the basque have gotten the support of the socialist party ] ( http://www.abc.es/espana/20140220/abci--201402201645.html ) ( spanish ), 
  self-defense forces , please . 
  spanish-speaking countries also . 
  no many people . 
  this was submitted 2 years ago . 
  the thing that surprised me was the bottom 10 in non-eu national . 
  that poland . 
  why it has even less foreigners than bulgaria ? 
   google are always hiring people with language skills in dublin which irish people do n't have . 
  sorry , stockholm called first . 
  i still know people that has a degree technical degree and are working in call centers . 
  : / and i do n't want to talk about some young architects that i know . 
  [ you can see other pictures here ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/marchas-dignidad-toman-madrid_12_241595839.html ) .

  you can read their manifiesto in english [ here ] ( http://marchasdeladignidad.org/objetivos/manifiesto/manifesto/ ) .

  andalusian , catalan , basque , anarchist , communist , united left flags , republican ... 
  [ you can read their manifiesto ] ( http://marchasdeladignidad.org/objetivos/manifiesto/manifesto/ ) . 
  the tldr is in red i skipped it the first time due to that . 
  i am pasting it here :  no to pay the debt  no more cuts  out governments troika  bread , work and shelter for all, 
  the constitution , electoral law , and political framework that he left were bad , but it was way better than the previous dictatorship and spain should have been seen as something temporary for getting the transition to democracy done . 
  the problem is that we have n't been able to improve the results of the transition . 
   the did n't have to witness what his successors have been doing to this country since 2008 . 
  the liberalization of the real state and construction sectors and the complete take over of the regional saving banks by regional politicians happened between 1996-2000 when he was still healthy . 
  and that is more important for getting to this crap that politics that we had post-2008 . 
  it was too late in 2008 . 
  in addition , he was n't corrupt , i think that he and calvo sotelo ( 1981-1982 ) are the only post-civil pm war in not being involved in shady businesses . 
  i am still wondering when we are going to have somebody non-corrupt leading the government . 
  rip . 
  yep , that 's a good point . 
  more than eu average university degrees and a lot of people with only basic education or not even that . 
  and almost nobody filling the gap . 
  most of the jobs for vocational training people are done by people with college degrees that maybe are n't even in the field . 
  spain has the higher rate of people with degrees doing jobs that require lower quaifications . 
  [ spain is the eu country with more overqualified workers ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fsociedad.elpais.com%2fsociedad%2f2011%2f12%2f08%2factualidad%2f1323298804_850215.html ), 
   and unskilled ones get automatized . 
  do you still poor concret per hand nowadays ? 
  or maybe you do the fields per hands too instead of using a harverster ? 
  skilled jobs are also getting automated . 
  many industrial jobs or in accounting have been replaced by robots and software that increases the productivity of workers . 
   so what 's remaining ? 
  i do n't know . 
   we ca n't with 60 + % of youth without any income . 
  woud it be better if spain gets the employers to fire people in their fifties to replace them by young people ? 
   and when all the boomer will retire , you 'll have pensions to pay and an entire `` active '' generation without any form of income to run the economy . 
  i 'll let you do 1 +1 . 
  and we ca n't afford to send to retirement or benefits the same amount of mature people more difficult to train and with lower return of investment . 
   so either you find them a job or give them welfare , because if money only sleeps in state coffers and 1 % ers ( oligarchs ) bank and inversters accounts and kids ca n't buy food , things will turn euromaidan pretty quickly . 
  that damn rhetoric . 
  there is n't money in state coffers . 
  and i wonder how you can force the people to invest in spain . 
  spain is screwed , but you are n't proposing anything that would work . 
  ** spain ** * big demonstations against the * austerity * according to the media ; or against according to the demonstrators against paying the debt of private banks , labour market reforms , cuts in education and welfare , economic and social policy and the governments . 
  we can call austerity to that , but i have the feeling that other people may have other deffinitions .
