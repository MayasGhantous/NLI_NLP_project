  i find interesting how biased an pro-spanish government are getting all the big media groups . 
  edit : adolfo su\u00e1rez has died . 
  i am sending this gallery the that does n't include pictures of the post-demonstration riots . 
  all the official media focus in that too much already . 
  we can talk about other things like the fact that you do n't see official spanish flags in the demonstrations . 
  there were : * republican * communist * united left * anarchist * andalusian * catalan but not official spanish . 
  one of those things that always angers to right-leaning people in spain . 
   worst than austerity the issue especially in spain is partly that most employers only recruit people from the baby boomer generation . 
  that 's for skilled jobs . 
  for unskilled jobs nobody wants to hire all this people from construction industry that the burst has left . 
  you do n't see gray haired people working in mcdonald even if many would like to do that at least , from family experience . 
   we need a real youth employement policies and we 'll need it really soon : / if half your population is uneligible to social insertion you have real problems coming . 
  we 'll probably need to think of some sort of worker program or largescale welfare ( which is n't lost since it recycle in the economy almost instantly ) to keep things stable . 
  spain has twice as much youth unemployment as overall unemployment . 
  and it was also like that in 2007 with an 8 % unemployment . 
  spain needs ~ ~ youth ~ ~ employment policies . 
  i feel this headline too focused in the violence . 
  if somebody wants my version 1 . 
  250,000 demonstrate against government policies , after many previous actions . 
  2 . some people was talking about camping in the streets to keep the fight alive 3 . 
  the police says that the demonstration time is over , and tells to everybody to leave . 
  some people throw objects to the police when the police was already concentrating to kick them out . 
  the police charges against everybody . 
  some people fight against the police , some people vandalized some bank offices almost everybody else flees . 
  the big spanish media focuses in the violence and tries to convince the people that we should ignore the protests , because everything is getting better ^ tm . 
  [ el pa\u00eds has changing director ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/world/europe/spanish-paper-el-pais-ousts-its-editor.html?_r=0 ) , [ other source ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-19/el-pais-ousts-editor-who-published-documents-on-spanish-graft.html ) . 
  tldr for the links : el pa\u00eds ( traditionally pro-psoe ) and elmundo ( traditionally pro-pp ) have changed this years their directors that opposed to the current government to ones more friendly to the government . 
  seriously elpais has published latelly editorials supporting the immigration policy , the policy towards catalonia , and the ** economic ** politics of the government . 
  maybe they are still pro-psoe , but there has been a certain turn in the positions of the paper . 
  and elmundo is more friendly with the government . 
  the government approved giving them subsidies in the form of official advertising and is preparing a google tax-for news aggregators . 
  the turn that elpais has given is sharp and i expected them to become pro social-democratic policies like they are usually when the psoe is in opposition . 
  psoe has n't turn to the left like they usually do in opposition , but it has n't turn to the right more like the paper . 
  however , turning to the right would mean doing something and they do n't seem to be into that or doing opposition . 
  you 're replacing a pro-government source with a leftist who supports the protesters . 
  just to give context . 
  edit : take any source with a pinch of salt . 
  that was carlos arias navarro again . 
  we had a ~ ~ dictatorship ~ ~ non-democratic government some time after that . 
  the firs su\u00e1rez 's government was n't democratically elected either . 
  he was appointed head of government by the king after being the general secretary of the single party , i think that being in reddit we need to be accurate when we talk about spanish history . 
  first spanish pm ? 
  this is wrong at many levels . 
  that in 9 years of republic ( 3 in civil war ) . 
  * dictatorship : carrero blanco , arias naviarro and i am not checking the double single party heads of government of the first borbonic restoration . 
  it 's for getting them to stay in the other side of the sea . 
  do you think that you are big power ? 
  and do not forget catalan referendum . 
  it smells like a reincarnation of the pasok . 
  not to spain . 
  spain still considers kosovo a part of serbia . 
   local vvd-politicians ( conservative liberals , same party as prime minister mark rutte ) think it would be more efficient to go straight after the criminals , and want a special police department that only focuses on ethnic minorities . 
  are politicians an ethnic minority ? 
  have you thought about sending a professional clown ? 
  [ spain did that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_pqtwa7c_m ) . 
  and he got an acceptable number of points . 
  if you are going to make laugh , you should sent somebody that makes a living of that . 
   i want to buy some costa brava property is n't better for you that we do n't get our shit together ? 
  if we do n't put our shit together the real state will get cheaper . 
  fewer families can afford to have a 2nd residence and trend is still downwards and we built too many even for 2007 levels of demand . 
  anyway i do n't see why you should wait to spain putting its shit together . 
  i would say that you can get some opportunities now that you would n't get in a normal economy . 
  ** spain ** this week have been 5 years , since the 11th of march when a group of islamist terrorist committed the most murderous terrorist act in spanish history , and the government and rajoy 's party tried to stall the investigation and lied to everybody to make the people think that was eta until the elections three days later . 
  they failed and they lost the election . 
  however the same people keep the leadership of the party and were caught financing illegally the 2008 electoral campaign in 2009 . 
  and my people elected them with the second biggest majority in our history in 2011 . 
  ** corruption ** * magdalena \u00c1lvarez : socialists ex andalusian minister of economy and treasury , ex-minister of public works and current vice-president of the european investment bank . 
  she has been asked to pay a civil bond of 29.5 million for the irregular usage of a fund that she established to subsidize layoffs . 
  143 persons have been formally charged . 
  the irregular layoffs has surpassed the number of traditional galician oligarchs that have been charged in the pokemon operation . 
  143 persons involved in the irregular layoffs . 
  and 2.2 billions in bonds for the charged people .
