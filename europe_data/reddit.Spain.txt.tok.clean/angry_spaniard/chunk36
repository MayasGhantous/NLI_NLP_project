   there will be none of the rehabilitation that is provided to danish prisoners . 
  some people want them to stay criminals . 
  i am not talking only about the public sector . 
  the spanish economy is full of families with underwater mortgages and companies with very high debts .

  half of the spanish private sector in on their knees with debts that are actually bigger that the value of their assests . 
  the banks keep refinancing their debts hoping that at some point they will be able to pay . 
  now , let 's be realistic . 
  with a zero inflation now ( and with deflation in the horizon ) with private and public sector in financial troubles and generally unable to access to credit , for good reason in general . 
  and we are n't talking about the other problems . 
  seriously , the most likely scenario is in the long run for spain in 10 years is a public debt going to 150 % of the gdp , unemployment of 20 % ( if there is n't a new crisis , that 's down 5 points ) , a social security struggling with bankruptcy ... and that with the full featured austerity : a slow rise of the vat to the 25 % , a retiring age at 67 years with 38.5 worked and shrinking pensions , most of the jobless without benefits , public health care managed by companies owned by cronies , public r&d system destroyed and public education seriously underfunded and understaffed ( we are only ~ ~ allowed ~ ~ replacing 1 person for every 10 that go to retirement until spain balances it 's budget and that 's not going to happen , edit : it 's a decision of the spanish government even if it 's applied by the regional governments ) ... edit : maybe we should do something , but hey it 's not like we are in a hurry !, 
   what 's next ? 
  bankers being punished for money laundering ? 
  i think that flying pigs are more likely . 
   although , southern european nations could really use the lowered borrowing costs . 
  to reduce the amount of interest paid . 
  but our consumers , and companies and governments have already too high debts and are paying over their realistic possibilities only in interests . 
  if we can refinance the debt with lower cost that 's nice . 
  but we ca n't get out of this with more debt . 
   i would suggest printing money to create a european navy for the mediterranean . 
  we were into a similar scheme but in the real world the [ eu declared illegal our subsidies to civil shipbuilding ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-23344489 ) .

  i am not sure if it 's an effective way of getting orders , but it 's not like the workers have anything better to do , except looking for new jobs . 
  * demonstration in ferrol ( galicia ) asking for the future of the sector . 
  the city has been called in spain the detroit of the shipbuilding and 63 % of the people employed in the sector have actually work to do . 
  the companies are n't very eager to do layoff because almost all of them are going to bankruptcy very soon anyway . 
  half of the auxiliary companies have defaulted already .

  and most of the remaining companies are going down soon . 
  tldr : the spanish civil shipbuilding industry is going to disappear this year . 
  the joke is over , we ca n't have industry . 
  the government may be allowed to keep alive the military industry but that 's it , and spain wo n't be allowed to increase the size of that with public funds . 
  my personal question is : can openly corrupt politicians continue winning elections after +5 years of economic downturn and falling living standards while the structural problems of the society are worsening ? 
  it seems like yes , and this worries my a lot .

  so high that refinancing mortgages does n't make sense anymore . 
  the banks have been putting off this problem many years because they did n't want to reflect the high default rate in their balance sheets , they had the hope that the economy would recover and the people would find jobs in the next years . 
  but it did n't happen . 
  anyway , it 's interesting the government has forced the banks to execute the mortgages . 
  more details , please . 
  you ca n't tell that only . 
  yep , it can be cool . 
  deliver , please !, 
  they think that the spanish real state is cheap !, 
  if you add the insurances and other financal services it goes to 12 % of the gdp .
