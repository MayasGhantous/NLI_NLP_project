  it 's bigger in others countries , but i wanted to complete the data . 
   ( a newer annoying myth is `` xenophobia in switzerland '' even though we have the highest amount of foreigners ( 23.3 % ) in all of europe ( except for luxemburg ) . ), 
  i have the feeling that it 's due to that your xenophobic people does n't give a shit about hidding . 
  you know those propaganda posters . 
  there is xenophobic people everywhere , but it seems like in your country they do n't feel ashamed about it . 
  we do n't think that you are racist . 
  why are you so brainwashed pro-fracking ? 
  those are comercial portals you are n't going to find anything free there . 
  they are n't going to offer anything that does n't gives them a fee . 
  the two cheapest properties that i found : * [ $ 8,000 ] ( http://galicianrustic.com/amplia.asp?id=781 ) * [ $ 10,000 ] ( http://galicianrustic.com/amplia.asp?id=782 ) if you want something * free * you have to contact directly some mayor and offer a rural development plan that involves some jobs and/or investment . 
  the situation in spain is complicated due to the excess of capacity . 
  we had also a bubble of combined cycle natural gas plants . 
  we have way more capacity of producing electricity than we consume or export . 
  thus the government has created a capacity payment tax for domestic users and self-generation for supporting the unused capacity instead of forcing the closing plants and/or let the companies go into bankruptcy . 
  it has made simply stupid to build new plants . 
  we could add more renewal plants but then we should close some coal plants , natural gas or nuclear plants . 
  [ i sent an article about this that had little repercussion ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ttdx3/too_much_gas_for_so_scarce_energy_demand_in_spain/ ) . 
  we could close all the coal and nuclear plants tomorrow and spain still would be able to supply the current demand . 
  edit : at least we are cutting the coal subsidies for 2018 . 
  i hope that spain will close the plants then . 
  if only the people that is happy having corrupt representatives votes everything will go ok . yeah , sure ... 
   franco i would n't tell that about franco . 
  he was the calmest backstabbing motherfucker that you have never seen . 
  he did n't get involved in another war in 36 years and died in his bed . 
  no so extreme , many of them are at a distance of half an hour in car from the city , at least in valencia . 
  however , what 's the point ? 
  the people that can afford to live there , paying the expensive utilities , high property taxes and expensive community services , and going everywhere with car prefer to live in the city or closer at least ; having public transport and everything closer . 
  i know that these things are successful in the us , but they are n't in spain . 
  the only hope is selling it to british expats or something like that . 
  edit : this article is a reminder of the magnitude of the spanish construction bubble more than a proposal to fix the homeless problems . 
  it 's not like the homeless can afford to live there even if we give them the homes for free . 
  [ miguel sebastian ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/miguel_sebasti%c3%a1n ) , socialist minister of industry between 2008 and 2011 , [ wrote an article in the 2003 about the bubble ] ( http://elpais.com/diario/2003/06/22/negocio/1056286344_850215.html ) and the problems that would cause . 
  i remember that then already everybody except the government , the central bank and the construction companies talked about the bubble . 
  / u/merkozy2012 is partially right some people seemed to pretend to think that we discovered a way of having infinite growth . 
  always growing number homes built every year sold for an always growing prices ( +15 % every year ) . 
  even when it did n't make sense in 2007 we were building more homes and employing more people in the construction and real state sectors than uk , france and germany . 
  edit : tldr : somebody told , nobody did anything . 
  you do n't turn off the music in the middle of the party . 
  some belong to the government , some to construction companies , some to banks , some to investors ... spain has two millions of homes that have n't been inhabited . 
  and three million and half of homes that are currently unused as first or second residence . 
  [ the housing prices have fallen already a 37 % since the peak ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/03/07/inenglish/1394192463_592178.html ) . 
  and there is no reason to expect the trend to stop the number of empty homes is still growing due to emigration , long term jobless moving to live with relatives , decreasing salaries and decreasing job security . 
  one third of the empty homes of the eu ( 500 millions of inhabitants ) are in spain ( 46 millions of inhabitants ) that was a hell of a construction bubble . 
  edit : i should read before saving . 
  that did n't make sense in any language . 
  ** spain ** * it seems like rajoy not only got financed illegally his 2008 electoral campaign . 
  the court has made public a police report that tell us that the g\u00fcrtel network financed the eu and national campaigns in 2004 and the local and regional elections in 2003 . 
  * it does n't matters because nobody in the party knew that they were financed illegally , the ~ ~ scapegoat ~ ~ accountant did everything without telling to anybody . 
  and even if the court could proof anything the crimes already expired .

  ana botella has urged interior ministry to limit number to protect businesses . 
  there were 392 demonstrations in the square in 2013 more than one in a day . 
  * an interesting thing about this government is that never reacts to demonstrations whatever the demonstrations are asking for stopping the illegal hunting or asking them to not being openly corrupt , i think that they expected the people to stop demonstrating seeing that they did n't get anything . 
  * [ the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/07/madrid-central-square-protests-puerta-del-sol ) * the government continues with its plans to illegalize abortion except rape and risk for the life of the mother despite the growing opposition , massive number of demonstrations , party members defections and so on .

  you seem extremely well informed / s  illegals coming from morocco , you could end up being new morocco in a few decades . 
  most of these illegal come from senegal , mali and nigeria . 
  morocco is n't so bad ( if you are native ) . 
  most of them actually would prefer to go to their former metropolies ( france and uk ) . 
  [ for 2012 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-22251840 )  although the number of native spaniards grew in 2012 by some 10,000 - it only minimally offset the overall fall of nearly 216,000 among registered foreign residents . 
  native spaniards includes people of foreign background actually that are spaniards . 
   although seriously there is nothing to worry , because violent extremist groups would gain popularity before that , some times i wonder why the far right is growing in other countries . 
  i do n't wonder why the most voted far right party got 20,000 votes , 40 years of oppression and looting were enough . 
  maybe other people does n't know . 
  and franco used [ moroccan troops ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regulares ) , and his ~ ~ royal ~ ~ ceremonial bodywars were moors until 1956 . 
  * tldr : when you have an economy like the spanish one you do n't need to worry a lot about being overrun by immigrants . 
  do you think that spain is in a risk of getting too much immigration ? 
  spain is expected emit 300,000 emigrants this year . 
  and we emited about that amount in 2013 ( waiting for final figures ) . 
  and the main source of immigration were emigrants from previous years . 
   here 's the thing : this has been going on for years . 
  it really surprises nobody . 
  [ actually , the current illegal immigration is half of the record that was 5 years ago ] ( http://spanishnewstoday.com/numbers-of-illegal-immigrants-higher-in-2013-than-2012_19494-a.html ) . 
  * during last year 7,550 people were intercepted while trying to enter spain illegally from the south , an increase of 7.4 % on the total for 2012 but still a long way short of the 15,572 who were picked up by the authorities in 2008 . 
  * the government is trying to create a * crisis * that they can solve . 
  the expected legal or illegal immigration is very low for this year . 
  we are expected [ to lose 246,649 inhabitants this year ] ( http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/np813_en.pdf ) and that with a natural growth of 40,654 inhabitants . 
  you fell in his gypsy tricks . 
  i thought you were a parody . 
  you have an * interesting * comment history . 
  oh , [ are you serious ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1yxgft/ugandan_minister_for_ethics_integrity_says_men/cfp36dd ) with this ? 
   most men would rape someone if they had the opportunity to, 
  lol, 
  i am confirm . 
  can german . 
  what makes you think that ? 
  they won the war and the transition to democracy . 
  they got an amnesty and kept all the products of 40 years of oppression and looting . 
  they have never been prosecuted . 
  adolfo suarez , the first spanish pm democratically elected since the republic , was the last general secretary of the single party . 
  and the current ruling party was founded by a former francoist minister ( manuel fraga ) who was in politics until 2011 .
