  [ a recent history ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/08/22/inenglish/1377194475_590024.html ) where are you from ? 
  where are you living ? 
  flair up . 
  spain was almost there . 
   i+d r&d, 
  [ spain is going to remove the universal justice law ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/11/spain-end-judges-trials-foreign-human-rights-abuses ) due to a the conflict that it 's generating with china . 
  does it make you feel better ? 
  the members are : * ana palacio : former foreign affairs minister and mep * antonio hern\u00e1ndez mancha : was briefly leader of the party between manuel fraga and aznar and former senator and member of the andalusian parliament * isabel tocino : former minister of environment * gonzalo solana : president of the ** competence court ** between 2000 and 2005 * luis valero : responsable of industrial policy until some weeks ago . 
  the government is actually the owner of 5 % of the company . 
  but 95 % is private , there are more politicians in the payroll now that when it was public and they have higher salaries . 
  maybe russia wants to invest in eastern poland again . 
  said the true fascist . 
  this link was sent also to whiterights and we got some commenters and voters from there like / u/ieatanusrockets the user that you were having a debate before . 
  [ you can see him here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/whiterights/comments/1yhzj0/nyc_more_blacks_are_killed_by_abortion_than_the/cflh28d?context=3 ), 
  [ first about the crowdfunding ] ( http://www.europapress.es/portaltic/administraciones/noticia-gobierno-limita-cantidades-captadas-via-crowdfunding-millon-euros-donaciones-maximas-3000-euros-20140228162243.html ) : the project can collect a maximum of a million euros , it 's the individual contributions what 's limited to $ 3000 . 
  actually , you got the most important , but you forgot the crisis that the media is promoting : * there is an artificial immigration crisis , even if the figures of illegal immigrants are similar to last year and way lower than in bubble times and we are actually having more net emigration than never ( we may have broken the dictatorship record in emigration , i am waiting for ine 's data ) . 
  in the list of things that are storms in a teacup actually we have : * rajoy promised a social security flat rate of $ 100 for new permanent contracts that increase the net amount of permanent employees in the company and actually last more than 3 years . 
  if he actually delivers and this is used it could send the social security to bankruptcy if you get the same pension . 
  fortunately , he is liar and he is n't going to deliver it as something that the companies can actually use . 
  * the business owner association has been caught doing fraud with the training funds . 
  they are blaming the company that they hired for * doing the courses * , 15 millions ended in the training of non-existing students . 
  the nice thing is that you need two to tango , the companies that provided the * students * are n't being prosecuted at this point . 
  yep , but i think that the figure is similar in 2013 , but i ca n't find the data . 
  yes , as far as i know . 
  this has been going on for years . 
  i do n't understand what 's happening with the media , that is talking about it . 
  it 's not like anything has changed . 
  the 2013 's figures are higher than 2012 but it 's still the half of the 2008 figures . 
  [ english-link ] ( http://spanishnewstoday.com/numbers-of-illegal-immigrants-higher-in-2013-than-2012_19494-a.html ) -- edit : [ spanish source if somebody dares ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2014/02/19/actualidad/1392827741_796285.html ) * 57.7 % of the illegal immigrants that went into spain did it through ceuta or melilla . 
  * 7.550 entered spain illegally , that the government noticed . 
  4.354 through ceuta or melilla * 36,000 illegal immigrants got into eu territory in italy , 20,000 in greece and 18,000 in romania . 
  [ if you check another article ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2012/04/17/actualidad/1334663606_813893.html ) you see that around half of them are expelled . 
  the comments are * interesting * in youtube . 
  the current government is a coalition of the corrupt traditional parties . 
  the most known opposition has n't had a lot of power . 
  syriza , the left opposition coalition has n't ruled greece . 
  that does n't make impossible the corruption , but i have n't heard anything in that sense about them . 
   and why is n't he removed yet ? 
  because he has the support of the pm , the majority of the greek parliament and troika for the policies that he is applying . 
   why are n't opponents making a huge deal out of this ? 
  the political situation here could always be better but i 'm pretty sure some opposition politicans would surgery for more index fingers to point at shitstains like this guy . 
  maybe there are opponents trying to make a huge deal of it but the international media does n't find it interesting . 
  who cares about the access of greek citizens to health care ? 
  25 % of the economy is black market . 
  many people forgets that a big chunk of the black market is in the hands of regular companies and people with regular jobs . 
  remember that there is underground economy in germany around 10 % of its gdp even with full employment . 
  there is n't detailed data anywhere but [ theguardian checked the social security ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/feb/27/net-migration-uk-jumps-30-percent?cmp=twt_gu )  registrations of new national insurance numbers for adults entering britain rose by 19 % to 617,000 in 2013 with the highest increases for those coming from poland ( 31,000 ) , italy ( 18,000 ) , spain ( 14,000 ) and portugal ( 10,000 ) . 
  we need to define healthy market before saying that we have one . 
   not what works for the high numbers of unemployed in portugal , italy , greece and spain . 
  and nobody cares about that . 
  did somebody say that the bailouts will help to fix the economies or reduce the unemployment ? 
  would you shoot to somebody who is n't threatening the life of anybody ? 
  interesting . 
  the border police recently stop using rubber bulleta after killing 15 immigrants that were swimming with them . 
   how does this impact the safety of the exclaves ' citizens ? 
  there is n't more crime than usual ( not a lot ) . 
  the [ smuggling is openly tolerated ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl6dtovwflm ) by government and the police . 
  but , it 's done by moroccan people mostly . 
  at this moment there are 1,100 ilegal immigrants detained at the concentration center of melilla ( that has capacity for 480 ) . 
  the ones that spain does n't manage to send to somewhere in 60/90 days are allowed to roam by the country . 
  the average is around 50 % sent back . 
   can a huge wave of migrants break in and overwhelm the authorities ? 
  once in a while happens , but they anyway are usually catched by the police and if it does n't happen they head north as soon as posible . 
  -- if you want some figures [ from an article in spanish ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2014/02/19/actualidad/1392827741_796285.html ) . 
  * 57.7 % of the illegal immigrants that went into spain did it through ceuta or melilla . 
  * 7.550 entered spain illegally , that the government noticed . 
  4.354 through ceuta or melilla * 36,000 illegal immigrants got into eu territory in italy , 20,000 in greece and 18,000 in romania . 
  the operative that spain and morocco have in the border is big and morocco is * helping * ( they are actually paid ) a lot . 
  a double fence six meters tall full with razor wire , hidden blades , strong light , militarized polices from both sides ... [ this is from before adding the blades ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/desalambre/grafico-valla-melilla_0_198780906.html ), 
  why is this one that failed in the international news ? 
  and the successful from the night is n't ? 
  [ 100 immigrants force their way into melilla , says civil guard - english ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/02/24/inenglish/1393238141_294262.html ) -- [ two weeks ago 80 syrians including women and children ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/international/wirestory/spain-close-enclave-border-avert-migrant-push-22512026 ) edit : this one is n't even specially big . 
  [ there was an assault with 1,000 immigrants in december ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2013/12/migrants-storm-morocco-melilla-border-2013121717543867693.html ), 
  remember our traditional territorial divide . 
  the eu is n't the rich only northwestern europe anymore . 
  [ 3.5 millions only in spain ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/20130418/spains-empty-home-count-hits-new-high#.uxfjnar3vku ) the number has increased in half million since the end of the housing bubble due to the evictions , defaults and people that goes back to live with their parents even if they are also parents now . 
  however , if we are honest the people that would like to live in the empty homes do n't have enough income for paying utilities or any rent . 
  and the government would n't pay that for them . 
  and we do n't have almost social housing and we are selling part of it to vulture funds because austerity . 
  the amount of people that ca n't have a normal life even if our society has the resources for it feels wrong . 
  we have the empty houses we have new built shut down power plants because the people ca n't afford the cost of using the electricity that they produce . 
  and millions of persons that would like to work for paying it but they ca n't . 
  the prices have fallen a 40 % in the last years but that does n't matter , many ca n't pay 1 euro anyway . 
  this feels like a waste and like there is something wrong . 
  they are n't reducing production they are going to upgrade some factories . 
  they are closing 4 factories with 1250 employees , and upgrading the other ones that will have 500 more employees . 
  they are also offering relocation packages . 
  i should n't talk about news in development . 
   every developed country that has a history of having several ethnicities has more than one official language except france . 
  yes , i already knew and i decided to skip it . 
  that discussion arises too often in english-speaking media and i am tired of the mixture of stereotypes , prejudices and actual data that it carries .

  the judicial power say that they need 64 new judges full time for the corruption cases .

  it also happened with el mundo and la vanguardia that were critic the government until recently that got a new direction more government friendly . 
  * interesting times , the government has increased the budget also for institutional advertising and is in process of approving a new copyright law . 
  it seems like rajoy is asking for a payment as usual . 
  * [ nytimes ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/world/europe/spanish-paper-el-pais-ousts-its-editor.html?_r=0 ) * coca cola crisis : the bottling company has offered : `` for the voluntary buyouts , workers will be offered 45 days ' salary for each year worked , with a 42-month maximum , plus an additional 10,000 euros '' . 
  they offering more than twice the laws requires , but they want to keep the closure of 4 of the 11 factories . 
  the unions keep claiming that they only would negotiate if the closures are canceled .
