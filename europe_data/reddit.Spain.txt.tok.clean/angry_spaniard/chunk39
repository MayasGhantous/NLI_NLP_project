  the arbitration of the government has been required . 
  the government is expected to tell the workers and unions to take the offer .

   unemployed and poor people complain and vote for populistic politicians . 
  if that 's true . 
  why less people vote populist in spain than in finland ? 
   the greek 2014 budget includes no austerity it includes the austerity measures of the last 6 budgets . 
  what else is missing ? 
  greece has the primary surplus that the troika required . 
  * massive emigration * coal subsidies , coal 's plan ( for moving the economy out of the coal ) * highest average age . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.ivie.es/downloads/2013/01/np_tablas_mortalidad_ivie_220113.pdf ) * asturies has a very good educative system ( the figures are only behind the basque ) . 
  but has almost no jobs for skilled people . 
  but this is n't the crisis . 
  the crisis has been as weak as the bubble in asturies . 
  the decline started like 30 years ago . 
  spain has been throwing a lot of money in asturies and the money has been better used than in andalusia , but the things are n't very good there . 
  if you check [ this map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mcibuks.png ) . 
  and some old [ fiscal balances ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qlf9slt.jpg ) ( fun fact the richest region basque country gives 1.38 % , but catalonia gives 8.7 % , the balearic islands was an special case they are usually giving slightly less than 10 % of their gdp ) . 
  a case : extremadura : 32 % of unemployed , aged population lot of retirees ( expends a lot in health care ) , low population density . 
  it 's getting 17.78 % of its gdp on fiscal transfers at this point . 
  with the due to respect : you are comparing a democratic system that allowed left wing and right wing elected governments with genocide dictatorships . 
  what about the massive amount of right-wing eurosceptics mostly from britain and a lower degree france ? 
  it 's different they got their privileges because they supported the right side in a war 300 year ago . 
  [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_the_spanish_succession#aftermath )  with regard to the political organisation of their kingdoms , philip issued the nueva planta decrees , following the centralising approach of the bourbons in france , ending the political autonomy of the kingdoms which had made up the crown of aragon ; territories in spain that had supported the archduke charles and up to then had kept their institutions in a framework of loose dynastic union , separate from the rest of the spanish realm . 
  on the other hand , the basques -- kingdom of navarre and the basque provinces -- having supported the king against the habsburg pretender , did not lose their autonomy and retained their traditional differentiated institutions and laws ( fueros ) . 
  and we still have the same royal family . 
  biscay and gipuzkoa lost their privileges ( fueros ) because they supported the wrong side in the civil war . 
  but alava and navarra kept the self-government and the fiscal privileges even during the dictatorship . 
  and they got them back after the second bourbonic restoration . 
  edit : if you suspect that i defend this check my flag . 
  the spanish territorial administration is a flawed mess with hundreds of years of baggage that nobody likes . 
  everything is solved !, 
  now they will go their homes and forget about this silly thing !, 
   but i am certain things will improve , why ? 
   little adjusts will need to be made . 
  what adjusts ? 
   but the fundamentals of spanish society are strong . 
  can you explain this ? 
  i am not sure if we are going to have a spain with its current borders in 5 years . 
  * things are starting to get better for europe , slowly , but still getting better !, 
  * they are using forecast figures that imply that the spanish social security will go into bankruptcy in 5-10 years ( depending of the amount of austerity ) , or many retirees will get way lower pensions than expected ( like 25 % lower ) or we fund them with taxes ( but we are n't collecting enough for paying all the things that funded already with taxes . 
  and for the unemployment the most optimistic forecast from my government gives us an 18 % unemployment in 2023 . 
  and we are applying already the social security discounts that they recommend for hiring young people and nothing changed except that the social security deficit is growing more quickly . 
  you can be optimistic about the future of your union , i will be pesimistic for the future of my country . 
  and as they said our labour market reform has been a * partial success * has reduced costs but nobody is hiring anyway . 
  actually no , [ toyota owns a factory in venezuela ] ( http://www.eluniversal.com/economia/140215/ejecutivo-no-cree-que-toyota-se-marche-de-venezuela ) . 
  this is only an example . 
  but the size of the public or worker owned economy is smaller than france or denmark . 
  chavismo ( called by his creator xxi century socialism ) is another variation of a south-american populism like peronism . 
  to the left of this one ( even if i am not sure if peronism is an ideology ) . 
  north korea could be an example because everything is owned by the state , even if the state is a monarchy and the workers do n't have any control over the state or the means of production . 
  but that 's mostly what has been all the actually existing communism/socialism . 
  anyway , i am missing a social-democratic party . 
  i would like to have one back . 
  no to big neo-liberal ( aka moderate conservative at the end of the day ) parties . 
  the same in spain . 
  [ from the spanish wikipedia ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/centro_de_internamiento_de_extranjeros ) you do n't need to check very far away : the immigrants that get ilegally in spain are put in a detention center until they are expelled or a maximum of 60 days . 
  in percentatge of immigrants expelled . 
  [ around half of them are expelled ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2012/04/17/actualidad/1334663606_813893.html ) however , in ceuta and melilla there is an agreement with morocco that they would handle all the illegal immigrants that we catch there if spain pays for it . 
  touching soil does n't mean that they have the legal right to stay . 
  but it means that a formal expulsion procedure must be done and if they are wounded they have right to medical attention . 
  edit : it means that the spanish police officers ca n't simply give them to another moroccan police in the border without filling any paperwork . 
  this is what the government proposal would legalize . 
  how many people qualify for social housing ? 
  how many social houses exist ? 
  marbella , an urban area , is also in that province . 
  spain used rubber bullets recently against a group of immigrants that were trying to cross swimming . 
  [ reuters ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/13/us-spain-migrants-idusbrea1c1my20140213 ) as you can expect if the bullets hit you it 's very likely that you drown , twelve bodies have been recovered already . 
  spain also added recently blades to the razor wire in the fences . 
  yes , like valencia . 
  it 's interesting that the two regions with the two biggest housing bubbles had the most corrupt governments ( balearic islands had an openly corrupt government between 2003 and 2007 , valencia since 1995 to nowadays and in andalusia the socialist always rule and have been corrupt at least 15 years ) . 
  i follow italian politics , i admit that not very closely . 
  and i think that the only things that have seen political action are berlusconi 's crimes , decentralization pushed by the northen league and anti-immigration policy pushed by the same guys . 
  how accurate is this observation ? 
  [ less detailed map , by autonomous regions ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mcibuks.png ) from [ a source ] ( http://www.elblogsalmon.com/mundo-laboral/epa-2013-el-mapa-de-la-desolacion-en-el-empleo ) that i do n't like but the data is right . 
  you can see 4 levels : * lowest : basque territories . 
  this can be explained by fiscal privileges ( foral fiscal system ) , a controled real state sector , and higher qualified specializations . 
  * remainder north and the capital : includes some regions that are n't doing very well but they have aged populations and high emigration rates : galicia , asturies , most of castilla - le\u00f3n , huesca and teruel in aragon . 
  * green : valencia , murcia and castilla - la mancha . 
  valencia and murcia had the biggest construction bubbles . 
  the three regions built ghost airports . 
  valencia ( my region ) was one of the rich regions , but not anymore , has a fight with andalusia for the position of the most corrupt region . 
  * blue : over 30 % deep south : low emigration rates , lack of industry , more religious , economy based in farming , tourism and corrupt real state operations , the farming reform to cut the aristocracy 's power and balance relation between masters and day laborers has n't been done ... there have been some attempts of industrialization that have ended badly . 
  the last the subsidized shipbuilding in cadiz . 
  the subsidies have been ilegalized by the eu . 
  ok canary islands does n't have even the farming ( except bananas ) and the tourism in extremadura is n't so big . 
  i have the feeling that the author forgot to colour some places . 
  at least alicante/alacant has 39,000 registered jobless that means at least a 20 % for alicante . 
  but the city is white . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.sepe.es/contenido/estadisticas/datos_estadisticos/municipios/enero_2014/muni_alicante_0114.pdf ) edit : you can check the [ population of alicante by ages ] ( http://www.alicante.es/documentos/estadistica/edades_2013.pdf ) something as low as 20 % would require a labour participation rate of around 100 % . 
  seriously what kind of person is orb\u00e1n ? 
  i still do n't understand the son of a bitch . 
   former romanian agriculture minister decebal traian remes has been released from jail on parole , after serving a year of his three-year prison sentence for corruption after being caught accepting bribes in sausages and plum brandy . 
  now he looks like j.r.r.martin he looks exactly like you would expect to look somebody that accepts those bribes . 
  ** spain ** * spanish police fired rubber bullets to people that was swimming trying to immigrate illegally to spain . 
  at least 15 persons have died .
