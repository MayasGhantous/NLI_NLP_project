  as many as 14 are believed to have died in the crush the legality of this is not clear . 
  some people asked here to spanish and italian government to put dead people in the table to discourage immigrants . 
  here we are . 
  yes , that and berlusconi 's evil tentacles extend to spain also he is the main shareholder of the spanish media group telecinco . 
  edit : and he has used that for promoting somebody like [ jesus gil ] ( http://www.telecinco.es/elprogramadeanarosa/2012/julio/18-07-2012/los-mejores-momentos-jesus-gil-telecinco_2_1446405141.html ) . 
  former major of marbella, 
  please , do n't give more power to berlusconi . 
  he should get into politics . 
  you could put all the inhabitants of israel in empty houses in new residential areas mostly in mediterranean spain . 
  and it seems like the [ spanish government is actually trying to do that ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1xciq4/the_spanish_government_approved_a_law_allowing/ ) . 
  the serbs protests are n't so big at this point , but you are mostly right . 
  romania and bulgaria are cheaper . 
  we also had that . 
  spoilers : the demand was from investors , nobody lives in the homes and the investors are in bankruptcy . 
  how the hell romania can have tuition free education and spain with higher taxes and gdp ca n't ?

  turkey is also going to build an aircraft carrier mostly designed by the spanish navantia with the collaboration of some spanish companies , and it seems like spanish companies are getting some construction contracts in turkey . 
  gibraltar has 30,000 residents . 
  i would say that it 's because a mix of : * the country is also popular as touristic destination . 
  * the mediterranean weather is nice . 
  * we are culturally very tolerant with the guiris . 
  we do n't ask to integrate or to learn spanish even if we are n't very good in english . 
  * marbella and ibiza are in spain . 
  maybe you have heard about them . 
  * once there is a certain population size the growth a feedback loop starts and there is a network effect . 
  their population is so big that they can buy real state in english , go to english supermarket , have english schools , english friends ... 
  they can move without having to integrate in the spanish society . 
  * the country is not polish cheap , but it 's cheaper than france and italy . 
  * we always build too much real state and we try to sell it to foreigners . 
  you can buy a nice home for cheaper prices than france or italy . 
  * low violent or visible crime rates . 
  there is corruption , drug dealing and smuggling but you do n't hear of violent crime often . 
  * food is better and cheaper , but at the same time they have effect british supermarkets if they are into that . 
  what i do n't understand is way this does n't work in portugal . 
  it 's more atlantic , but it 's still nice . 
  many of them pay that amount of taxes . 
  not everybody can commit tax fraud . 
  many people are public employees for the government or for a serious company and all their salary is known by the government . 
  when there is a 25 % of tax fraud does n't mean that everybody is paying a 25 % less that they should . 
  it means that some people is paying the fucking 100 % and some people the 10 % or less . 
  generalizations !, 
  too old !, 
  do you know if it 's available with english subtitles ? 
  barcelona is too bloody obsequious with the damn tourists , specially the city hall and does n't seem to care about the opinions of the citizens only the tourist . 
  the guy that is bringing sangria to the tourist and being so attentive with them is the mayor and it ends when he hears that group of neighbours that are having some problems want to talk with him and he says * `` but . . what are they thinking that the city is of everybody ? . 
  '' * and he goes back to be obsequious with the tourist . 
  edit - moral : everybody can be feed up with a group of foreigners even if they are what it 's keeping the economy of your city alive . 
  i am putting this [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zez_vxwo_ro ) ( not even spanish , catalan because fuck yeah ! ),

  thanks for the respect and the lack of prejudice . 
   there 's nothing controversial about the irish example , yes , there is .

  [ el diario-es ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/complejo-turistico-marina-isla-valdecana_0_226078019.html ) it seems like a slow news week . 
  i usually have to cut a lot of stuff that i find interesting . 
   banana republics are giving citizenships to anyone with any excuse . 
  banana ** republic ** !? 
  where is the republic ? 
  and least be honest , this only going to affect some symbolic cases and some rich shady people will pretend that some of its ancestry were sefardi jews . 
  it 's not going to be anyone like malta is n't going to be anyone . 
  it also says that [ this private asociation ] ( http://www.fcje.org/ ) will have to give you a certificate of suitability . 
  i expecting that they will simply will sell the certificates to whoever pays a high price . 
  maybe i am too pessimistic or i know too much my country . 
  but i think that this is an scheme to selling citizenship like malta but the government is not the one to collect the money here .
