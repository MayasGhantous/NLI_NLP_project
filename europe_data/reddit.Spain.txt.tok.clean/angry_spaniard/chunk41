  it * was * an island . 
  [ it 's connected with a road now ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/preview/@39.8423584,-5.3678916,2538m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=fi ), 
  this has also the support of the mayor that approved the project and gave a license to the project , like he was able to override national laws . 
  and some surprisingly friendly first instance judge that had the case 5 years and did n't suspend the construction works . 
  this project was in court almost from the begining in 2007 . 
  and once it was in court the regional government approved also an executive order trying to remove the protection of the * island * ( it 's connected with the land with a road now also ) . 
  like a regional government can change the status of a place protected by the eu and the national government . 
  edit : i should have given some context before , but i had n't time . 
  the law and the court say that it should be demolished , but the things are n't so simple in spain . 
  who knows ? 
  edit : [ pictures of illegal hotel in public protected beach ] ( https://www.google.se/search?q=el+algarrobico&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1c1ggge_esse508se508&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=7rj1upmzdmhiywo984caaq&amp;ved=0caoq_auoag ) .

  [ it has been confirmed by the supreme court ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/complejo-turistico-marina-isla-valdecana_0_226078019.html ) , it 's illegal . 
  a mayor can not allow because * reasons * to build a touristic complex in natural parks . 
  i put the picture because it 's what i find amusing . 
  putting this in the middle of a natural park edit : i can not into inglish . 
  tldr : business as usual . 
  that 's not done by a government . 
  sorry , but i was wrong [ they were caught again in 2012 ] ( http://www.elperiodicoextremadura.com/noticias/sociedad/marruecos-expulsa-desierto-argelia-inmigrantes-isla-tierra_678951.html ) . 
  spain pays to morocco and does n't ask questions . 
  they have n't been caught throwing them without water in a long time [ in the desert ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4319828.stm ) . 
  edit : yes , i said dessert . 
  i can not into inglish . 
  i ca n't find information about this in english , but [ business income for the first time exceeded the salary income in spain in 2012 ] ( http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2012/02/16/actualidad/1329424061_546148.html ) and business are less taxed than workers . 
  a very clear example of the labour market reforms destroying jobs is happening right now with [ cocacola partners spain ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/coca-cola-workers-protest-layoffs-spain-160152672.html ) ( the company that bottles cocacola in spain ) . 
  they are having good results and the sales are going well . 
  however , the management has decided to close 4 factories ( madrid , asturias , majorca and alicante ) and consolidate the production in the factories in basque country , catalonia and andalucia . 
  the will keep the same production with 750 employees less of a total of 4,000 ( including the ones that do n't work in the factories ) . 
  before the labour market reforms doing a reestructuring like this while having profits would have been extremely expensive . 
  but , now this is affordable for them . 
  i think that they are offering to the workers more than the legal minimum . 
  however , this does n't make the workers like it . 
  the are extremely scared , deseperated and angry . 
  and they are striking , organizing boicots asking the government to give subsidies to the company to keep the factories that does n't need ... 
  job creation in spain ? 
  [ our social security disagrees ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/02/04/inenglish/1391509697_531592.html ), 
  i had to submit this . 
  it seems like there is some confusion about the nature of our recovery . 
  the number of people working in spain has hit the minimum in twelve years . 
  [ that 's a recovery nowadays ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/02/04/inenglish/1391509697_531592.html ) . 
  edit : we have had one quarter with 0.1 % growth and another one with 0.3 % growth , but spain is still destroying jobs and creating poverty . 
  however , you are right this is what we call recovery . 
  you forgot irish . 
   you 'd get complaints about eu powergrabs , and rightly so but , they are still pushing privatization , a more regressive fiscal system and welfare cuts . 
  let 's be honest the eu leadership likes the corruption . 
   goddamit that 's sick . 
  are there any protests against it ? 
  i do know that it happens though . 
  yes , there are ; but everybody expects it to continue . 
  the government does n't have to hear the demonstrations if they have a [ silent majority ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2012/10/09/inenglish/1349787062_669831.html ) in their side ( yes , rajoy said that ) . 
  like richard nixon in the famous `` the great silent majority , '' in november 1969 . 
  could one the guys who do n't see the corruption as institutionalized come here and explain us ? 
  are the the blind people or something ? 
  but [ it happened ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/06/26/inenglish/1372267790_233390.html ) . 
  the judge that handled the case of the looting of caja madrid ( regional saving bank ) was replaced by one more friendly with the personal friend of the former conservative pm jose mar\u00eda aznar who allowed [ him to avoid provisional prison and to keep his passport ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/01/24/inenglish/1390583796_525585.html ) . 
  the new judge is also working hard in making the case not go anywhere . 
  and this is only and example . 
  [ carlos fabra ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/20131025/the-politician-who-reinvented-the-rules ) changed his judge seven times , but with him they pulled out and got promotions . 
   a total of eight judges have investigated fabra 's financial dealings but they all pulled out when it came to reaching a verdict . 
  for implementing that you would need to recognize kosovo as an independent country . 
  i support it to be a part of uk if they are into that . 
  but without being a fiscal heaven or a colony , as a constituent country like scotland or wales . 
  do you mean hand-egg ? 
  probably poland has ( like spain ) a flat mandatory payment for self-employment to the social security . 
  if you have lost $ 10000 you pay 261.50 euros/month you had a profit of 100,000 you pay 261.50 euros/month . 
  there are a lot of weird corner cases and subsides in the law of course . 
  if you have an ltd you have to pay slighly over 300 euros , if you are under 30 you have to pay a 30 % less , the first six months in your life as self-employed there is another deduction that can be a 50 % ... edit : this gives you the right to the lowest retirement pension , you can pay more at your will . 
  yes , it even has a section in the main [ galician newspaper ] ( http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/temas/operacion-pokemon ) count the number of articles ( they only let you read the first ten pages ) . 
  this case is big , it seems to involve hundreds of persons from the three big parties and almost all the important local businessmen .
