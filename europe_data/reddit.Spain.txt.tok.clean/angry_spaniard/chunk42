  traditional cap discussion . 
   if sweden and the uk and denmark do not like payments to the eu and the cap but find it difficult to reform - can we just stop payments and following the cap ? 
  the cap has been reformed for the next budget with the support of those countries , and the reform has made worse some of the most stupid things like the giving subsidies to farmers for not working . 
  there was a lot of anger about the new system that is going to give subsidies to people that let their farmland become a wasteland . 
  there has been a big debate about the las reform of the cap and his effects almost everybody agreed that the subsidies based in farm space even if it 's not completely worked is stupid . 
  what do you think about this headline about the effects of the last reform ? 
  [ on alert for `` sofa farmers '' ] ( http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2013/03/17/andalucia/1363545633_541154.html ) . 
  what do you think about the last cap reform ? 
  are you pushing in that direction ? 
  --  everybody knew that greece lied . 
  what more - the debt etc increased , something they should have bin fined and taken to task for . 
  probably yes , but when the procedure for finning greece started in 2005 germany and france were also being analyzed becaused they broke the treaty also ( germany had a justification with unification costs , but the treaty did n't care about that ) . 
   if germans respect the law and treaties - why not follow them ? 
  [ france and germany acted against the treaty just around the dot-com bubble crash ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stability_and_growth_pact#criticism ) , and nothing happened to them . 
  germany ca n't pretend to have a high moral position in this they were with portugal the first countries in ignoring the treaty . 
   is that is how the ez countries want to run things ? 
  i hope that not . 
   anarchy - do what you want ? 
  how can they expect that to remotely work . 
  do you think that acting strictly according the treaties around the ecb and the euro in gerneral would work ? 
  this can be a rhetorical question . 
  you have said many times that the ez ca n't work with the current framework . 
  even if we do n't agree about what 's needed to make it work that 's out of scope of this discussion . 
  ( this comment is too long already )  if the ez counties are responsible and serious - why not follow them , apologise , throw out countries , fine and punish - and renegotiate . 
  even if you are responsible and serious the consequences of acting according the treaty are worse that not doing nothing . 
  and reforming the treaties was against the electoral interests of some governments like the german and austrian . 
  that is also bad . 
  the treaties should be reformed , but that 's not happening . 
   and - whole ducking arrogant is it to put themselves above the law ? 
  the law is something that they ( the governments ) wrote . 
  are you actually surprised of seeing governments acting like the laws are for other people ? 
  i am surprised by the shortsightedness of the political class , six years and none of the long term problems have n't been solved , but not by this . 
   and what about greece greece published figures that said that they were following it . 
  i do n't know if somebody actually believed them , but that another question . 
  and the treaty is not reformed because all the countries should agree to do that . 
  but , it ca n't be applied because most of the countries oppose to it and are n't in conditions of acting according the treaty . 
   should we all just ignore/disobey treaties we do not like if the majority wants to disobey a treaty it becomes very hard to enforce , you can see this with copyright laws . 
   it 's supposed to dissuade people who will immigrate and then have to live on benefits . 
  i do n't see how putting a burden in the people that stay in romania is going to dissuade of emigrating . 
  it makes even less atractive staying in romania from my point of view . 
  have you thought this seriously ? 
  romania and bulgaria have lost the a big chunk of their most skiller workers ( 25 % of the romanian doctors have emigrated ) who have costed a big chunk of their scarce resources . 
  and the massive emigration of working age people is destroying their pension system . 
  if romania has to pay for every person on benefits belgium should pay for every romanian working . 
   he is suggesting that the romanian government should pay for those romanians on benefits in the uk . 
  how much should the romanian government pay for them ? 
  they are n't going to be deported . 
  are you asking to countries like romania to give you for people living in your country more money that their minimum wage per capita ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  why do we have the flames about spain when i am working ? 
  that 's ~ ~ murica ~ ~ murcia . 
  ok , it 's the region where the conservatives get the best results , but it 's not exactly as rural and southern as that .

  do you think that i should change something ? 
  is it official ? 
  the party has published already the [ foundational manifest ] ( http://www.voxespana.es/index.php/manifiesto-fundacional ) . 
  they are proposing to eliminate the autonomous regional governments . 
  it 's almost the only concrete thing that they say . 
  i ca n't trust anybody who has started negotiating an electoral law with berslusconi that it 's even worse than the spanish one . 
  having an agreement with the rest of the uk to be recognized as a continuation of the uk being part of the same international treaties by default . 
  i am not sure about how legal is having more than one . 
   i ca n't see them doing it . 
  i can see it happening with the current government at least . 
  you should try to the get the status successor state of the uk if you want to avoid problems . 
  good work with that electoral law . 
  it seems to combine the bad things of the british uninominal majority system with the bad things of the small districts and closed lists of the spanish law . 
  ** spain ** * spain is still destroying jobs , [ 198,000 in 2013 ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/23/spain-unemployment-rise-26-percent ) . 
  * the area with the highest rate of unemployment is andalusia ( 36.3 % ) , followed by the canaries ( 33.1 % ) . 
  the lowest is the basque country ( 15.7 % ) .

  contents of the package : * maximum salaries table for mayors . 
  * 175 millions in subsidies to the motor industrie , [ plan pive 5 ] ( http://www.planpive.net/ ) . 
  * reduced social security payments for companies that hire part time temporary workers . 
  * some transport reforms . 
  except that the government is going to charge more for resques in the sea everything else seems very technical * the vat for import and purchase of artworks goes from 21 % to 10 % .

  * it seems like the only big retail comerce groups present in spain not-involved in something nasty are the french . 
  and that 's probably because i do n't know enough about them * edit : i forgot some more corruption : another politician from canary islands is being investigated for his involvement in illegal real state operations . 
  he has managed to get for himself 116 states and 6 boats . 
  i think that it 's the end of housing market bubble . 
  6 years ago with the minimum wage you would have had a hard time trying to live by yourself renting a room in a medium income city like valencia ( my hometown ) and it would have been simply impossible in madrid , barcelona or the basque country . 
  you could have end paying 400 euro/month if you wanted an acceptable area . 
  with that kind of money you can rent an apartment for a family in a good area in valencia nowadays . 
  a precarious worker can risk to live by himself having something for 150 euros/month for rent . 
  my parents generation left their parents ' home around 22-27 . 
  spain did n't have the kind of * tradition * in this thing until the construction bubble . 
  spain got similar prices to sweden in the peak of the bubble , you would be surprised by the current prices . 
  and the big albania ? 
   not sure what you mean with this sentence , i wanted to express ambiguity because i do n't know what that involves either . 
  however , i am going to state the most likely behaviour of spain if it 's not able to block the effective independence of catalonia . 
  even if catalonia get the independence there is still the basque country thus the future of an independependent catalonia has to be made as painful as posible with peaceful means . 
  spain will block the eu membership of catalonia , and not only that . 
  spain would also block them from signing any free trade agreements and joining any posible international organization where spain has some leverage . 
  what is the eu going to do if catalonia declares independence ? 
  is it going to let spain handle the situation without restrictions ?
