  or is it going to hold an independent position ? 
  yeah , kosovo and bosnia are kebab-free . 
   the leader of the center-right is still b. 
  this is sad . 
  ** spain ** * a corrupt and polemic construction project in burgos generated a week of massive riots in the city with some small events in other cities . 
  * the project has been finally eliminated . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1vj35n/spain_mayor_of_burgos_scraps_definitely/ ) * the government is thinking about making mandatory for self-employed people to join the public unemployment insurance due to the high rates that end ruined . 
  [ link in spanish ] ( http://www.abc.es/economia/20140117/abci-empleo-suavizara-acceso-cobro-201401171326.html ) * presented spanish ~ ~ dictatorship nostalgic ~ ~ nationalist party . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/16/us-spain-politics-idusbrea0f1hm20140116 ) * a eurosceptic left wing professor has announced also a candidature for the eu elections and has collected the signatures already . 
  [ links ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/01/17/inenglish/1389965500_020449.html ) * catalan police officers will be prosecuted for murder for beating to death a 50 years old business owner . 
  [ link ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/01/17/inenglish/1389972486_365153.html ) * some petty corruption cases * the biggest conservative newspaper is n't getting subsidies from the government ( conservative ) since they required the pm to resign for corrupt and incompetent . 
  i do n't like the article , but it 's the only one updated in english . 
  things that i do n't like : * it accepts the official cost figures : 8.5 millions . 
  that 's a blatant lie . 
  the cost of the project is 20 millions but they * expect * to get almost 12 millions selling parking spots for 20,000 euros in the underground parking that was planned . 
  * however , that seems unlikely . 
  there is already a cheaper parking nearby . 
  and [ it 's completely empty ] ( http://www.estrelladigital.es/articulo/espanha/aparcamientoa-fantasma-150-metros-nuevo-parking-gamonal/20140116151851007797.html ) * m\u00e9ndez pozo the guy who got the contract is the local * cacique * who also owns the [ local newspaper ] ( https://twitter.com/masaenfurecida/status/422330785325404160 ) . 
  * there are [ serious irregularities ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/escolar/exclusiva-adjudico-obra-bulevar-gamonal_6_219138085.html ) in the procedure for selecting the bid for building the project . 
  and mendez pozo has been in prison already for its participation in other corruption affairs . 
  doing an openly corrupt and unneeded construction project like this , in the most austerity striken neighborhood of the city that lost its only daycare center recently and most of the public services in these years was too offensive . 
  however , nobody expected this reaction the people has accepted worse shit without blinking an eye . 
  blame the source . 
  the eu does n't have an official position about kosovo . 
  spain and romania at least ( maybe greece also ) are going to side with serbia about kosovo . 
  spain has promised not recognize kosovo independence unless serbia does it first . 
  a country as rich as romania ca n't pay more . 
  my government says that this will be good for us , like the construction bubble or the absurd public works . 
  we are so fucked . 
  they have higher unemployment and retire earlier . 
  i am going to explain that when you explain a satisfactory plan for dealing safely with the risk of nuclear energy in a world a corrupt , inefficient and greedy companies , governments and people that ca n't plan anyway for everything . 
  the risks are lower in the other path . 
  btw : i am not defending shutting down all the nuclear plants tomorrow ( however , spain has to shut down a lot of our mix soon ) . 
  but , i am defend not building more and closing them when it 's planned . 
  he was talking about the three provinces that are in the basque country autonomy , navarre is * independent . 
  * and the language seems to be dying there still . 
  the provinces are : alava , biscay and gipuzkoa . 
  the last one is probably the one were the basque is getting stronger . 
  however , i am valencian no basque . 
   you have no plan for that do you ? 
  if you are talking about spain . 
  spain is going to put some radioctive waste at a [ temporal deposit in cuenca ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/almac%c3%a9n_temporal_centralizado_de_espa%c3%b1a ) ( spanish only sources ) . 
  it 's supossed to be good enough until 2050 . 
  somebody will think something by then . 
  spain at this moment thanks to our expensive mismanagement has twice as much generation capacity as we need . 
  an average day spain can generate : * all the energy that we use with natural gas mostly from algeria . 
  * 40 % with a mix of renewal energies . 
  * 30 % with nuclear plants . 
  * 25 % with coal . 
  seriously i have a hard time trusting people with something as dangerous as nuclear energy . 
  why ? 
  because , we are still waiting for the first country to have a definitive plan for the waste that the nuclear plants generate . 
  any idea about what to do with that radioactive waste that it 's going to last thousands of years ? 
  can we kill the eu already ? 
  the only new factors in the last twenty years are : * no population grown * berlusconi as the most powerful man . 
  he has n't given a fuck about the italian economy . 
  * the currency union with germany : but at their peak italy was in a common market with germany already . 
  * you should n't forget the new eastern europe competition specially poland . 
  every week you see a new company ( specially germans and americans ) closing their operations in spain and moving to poland . 
  including some emblematic products like the most popular [ chocolate bar ] ( http://www.abc.es/local-aragon/20130425/abci-historia-marca-dulces-huesitos-201304251829.html ), 
  what 's that thing that you call kosovo ? 
  are you talking about the serbian province ? 
  how many of them are under 65 ? 
  there is no reason italy ca n't be on par with britain , france and germany [ it was some years before before berlusconi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_italy#from_stagflation_to_stagnation )  as a matter of fact , in 1987 , italy had a period when it surpassed the british economy ( an event known as il sorpasso ) , becoming the fifth in the world . 
  on 15 may 1991 italy became for a while the fourth worldwide economic power , overcoming france , [ 28 ] with a gdp of us$ 1.268 trillion , compared to france 's gdp of us$ 1.209 trillion and britain 's of us$ 1.087 trillion . 
   respect for the great bulgarian and romanian people . 
  welcome to our community . 
  i 'd love to visit your countries some time . 
  unfortunately , paris is going to be an even bigger roma-begger paradise than it already is . 
  roma beggers outside every supermarket , bad musicians in every metro wagon , pick pockets all around . 
  do you want the two poorest eu countries to deal with the problem by themselves ? 
  yes , that . 
  it 's the old fashioned dictatorship nostalgic with the support of some victims of eta angry with the government because is releasing eta prisoners when they are finishing their sentence . 
  we should be angry because the government tried to keep them more than that but the echr stopped them . 
  about the insurgent ideas , some people have tried to create parties like the national front and the biggest got 20,000 voters . 
  there is n't the kind of xenophobia in spain that there is in other countries . 
  and this would be a weird moment to be anti-immigration when we are a net emissor of migrants . 
  and seriously even our non-democratic right is n't specially xenophobic . 
  the personal guard of franco was muslim only the first 20 years of his dictatorship . 
  [ a picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ydww1su.jpg ) in addition , this party is the reason why the ruling party is reforming the abortion law even if the pm has never given a signal about caring about the abortion . 
  btw : a mildy known university professor eurosceptic and anticapitalist has done a similar announcement also . 
  [ both organizations will be presented this thursday ] ( http://www.publico.es/politica/495077/pablo-iglesias-dispuesto-a-presentarse-a-las-elecciones-europeas ) . 
  i talked about this recently http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1udsm3/europes_tea_parties_insurgent_parties_are_likely/ceh4315, 
  as a valencian impartial party i have to tell you : both * languages * seem the same only with a strong spanish influence in galician . 
  maybe it 's because i am spaniard but this is more embarrassing for the spanish government that has said that would make as difficult as possible the access of an independent catalonia to financial markets . 
  i see a government trying to show ( at least ) that it 's taking care of its current citizens . 
  whereas the spanish governments bullies catalonia . 
  it 's easier to defend to stick together with the british attitude . 
  spain has now 16,357,640.05 ( yep that 's a thing , because part time and day laborers ) workers . 
  a year ago it was 16,442,681.23 ; but two years ( december 2011 ) ago it was 17,229,921.50 . 
  it seems like the economy is stabilizing , with a 26 % of unemployment falling slowly due to emigration . 
  edit : [ sauce ] ( http://www.seg-social.es/internet_1/estadistica/est/afiliacionaltatrabajadores/seriesafiliacion/serieafmediareg/169413 ), 
  shut up !, 
  the government is saying that we have a recovery because we only destroyed 87,000 jobs in 2013 . 
  registered in the public unemployment service . 
  i do n't expect a lot from the protest forbbiden and not forbidden . 
  the spanish government is going to pretend that nothing has happened . 
  but , the moderate nationalist conservatives supported the second demostration . 
  and they started recently the proccess for changing the self-government estatus , to increase it . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.eitb.com/es/noticias/politica/detalle/1863338/nuevo-estatus-euskadi--el-debate-parlamentario-arranca-jueves/ ) the real risk is that the moderate right-wing nationalist get humilliated by the spanish government like with catalonia when the spanish government rejected even openning negotiations for getting the same fiscal status as the basque country .
