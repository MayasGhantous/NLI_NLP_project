  the basque right may react the same way and start seeking independence also . 
  my government is stupid , lazy , incompetent and corrupt . 
  but i hope that they do n't commit the same errors again . 
  in politics if you want to say no you announce the creation of a bilateral comission with expert advisors that will create a framework for bullshitting , and then you give them some minor concession when they are losing momentum . 
  you do n't simply say no and reject to meet one of your regional premiers . 
  can you tell any other way of stopping the project ? 
  this deadly spiral of corruption and waste has to be stopped . 
  [ some context ] ( http://www.ultimocero.com/articulo/algunas-claves-sobre-el-conflicto-gamonal )  another source of reluctance is the award of the project to mbg engineering and architecture sl , located in promecal building and property m\u00e9ndez well , an old acquaintance of the panorama of corruption by his conviction for document forgery in the `` case of construction '' of burgos , for which he spent 2 years in jail . 
   javier lacalle himself , who was then planning councilor , and in 2006 found himself involved in another controversy to have made a trip to the french riviera with all expenses paid by several builders headed son m\u00e9ndez pozo . 
  two months after these builders got the contract to build the tunnel street balearic islands . 
  the mayor juan carlos aparicio and party colleague repobr\u00f3 this attitude , which was reproached by the opposition . 
  edit : thinking about it they should by attacking the politicians in their homes instead of fighting the police in the streets .

  how much time wants the government to keep [ arnaldo otegi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arnaldo_otegi ) in prison ? 
   the ecb really needs to get with some qe and turn this shit around . 
  this started as a demonstration against an obviously corrupt and expensive public works project actually . 
  i am not sure about how qe is the solution for that . 
  except maybe that would stop the demonstrations , because nobody cares about those projects when the spanish economy is ok . 
   what do you think ? 
  is there a solution ? 
  referendum and leaving the union if they want . 
  what about vampire gypsies ? 
  i find spain insulting to spaniards, 
  spain started its austerity program in the summer of 2010 . 
  we have destroyed 2 millions of jobs since that . 
  put restrictions . 
  i accidentally a word . 
   in the case of the uk , what is the eu really for ? 
  i think that [ it 's obvious ] ( http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/yes,_minister ) . 
   ** sir humphrey : ** minister , britain has had the same foreign policy objective for at least the last five hundred years : to create a disunited europe . 
  in that cause we have fought with the dutch against the spanish , with the germans against the french , with the french and italians against the germans , and with the french against the germans and italians . 
  divide and rule , you see . 
  why should we change now , when it 's worked so well ? 
   ** hacker : ** that 's all ancient history , surely ? 
   ** sir humphrey : ** yes , and current policy . 
  we ` had ' to break the whole thing [ the eec ] up , so we had to get inside . 
  we tried to break it up from the outside , but that would n't work . 
  now that we 're inside we can make a complete pig 's breakfast of the whole thing : set the germans against the french , the french against the italians , the italians against the dutch . 
  the foreign office is terribly pleased ; it 's just like old times . 
   ** hacker : ** but surely we 're all committed to the european ideal ? 
   ** sir humphrey : ** [ chuckles ] really , minister . 
   ** hacker : ** if not , why are we pushing for an increase in the membership ? 
   ** sir humphrey : ** well , for the same reason . 
  it 's just like the united nations , in fact ; the more members it has , the more arguments it can stir up , the more futile and impotent it becomes . 
   ** hacker : ** what appalling cynicism . 
   ** sir humphrey : ** yes ... we call it diplomacy , minister . 
  or maybe they should * put * ^ ^ edit restrictions to emigration like cuba . 
  they are having way more problems due to the migrations than uk . 
  is this possible ? 
  romania is jailing one of their corrupt former pm while all our corrupt former pm walk free ? 
  being a head of state without executive powers is n't the same as being a figurehead . 
  he certain powers over the society that currently owns some royal palaces and he got part of the budget to be used to build a private hunting pavillion for him . 
  besides that , the king uses his diplomatic status to get involved in some shady affairs mostly in arabic countries . 
  it 's true that he ca n't pass laws , declare wars , sign international treaties ... 
  but , he has some political privileges still . 
  the other comments seem to forget that he is completely corrupt not only a drunk , whorer with an expensive lifestyle . 
  the king was hidding the involvement of his son in law in the corruption and money laundry networks of the conservative party with his noos fundation . 
  when he discovered that , he got him a job in washington for our private dominant telecommunications company ( telef\u00f3nica ) and tried to hide all the proofs .

  [ the public prosecutor opposes indicting king 's daughter ] ( http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/131115/spain-prosecutor-opposes-indicting-kings-daughter ) . 
  it 's amazing how far they are going with this . 
  besides that , the king is using also his diplomatic immunity to get involved in shady ( may not be illegal ) business in arab countries . 
  [ he got a * gift * of two ferraris from emirates in 2012 ] ( http://www.motorpasion.com/ferrari/el-primer-ministro-de-emiratos-arabes-le-regala-al-rey-dos-ferrari ) . 
  8 millions ? 
  that 's only wages and mantaince of the royal palaces . 
  you should add * [ 12 millions for acts ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/politica/millones-incluyen-cuentas-casa-real_0_174982702.html ) * the national heritage agency is traditionally under his control . 
  [ and he spent 2 million euros irregularry in building a hunting lodge ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/20131219/spains-king-spent-2m-on-hunting-pavilion ) edit : the total budget for head of state related stuff is [ around 560 millions ] ( http://www.loquesomos.org/index.php/es/autores/91-amadeo-martinez-ingles-/1771-561654350-euros-coste-real-de-la-monarquia-espanola ) . 
  however , most of it would be spent anyway . 
  i do n't like the article , but the figures are right . 
  and there are details like the 20 millions of the army budget used in the prince 's wedding . 
  semitic, 
  if you are talking about russians the idea was making you assimilate to russian culture . 
  spain did the same during the francoist dictatorship in the catal\u00e1n speaking territories . 
  is being a monkey better ? 
  ok : the picture means that romanian is used as synonym of eastern europe rome . 
  the rest of the comment means that the eastern europe gypsy are being extremely problematic and unpopular . 
  and this backfires surprising nobody . 
  if they ca n't have their national identity it 's very likely that they will focus in their religious identity . 
  this is something that usa does surprisingly well . 
  why most european countries seem to be completely against assimilating the immigrants ? 
  i am putting [ this here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/myo4hqp.jpg ) * translation : forbidden the entrance for dogs and romanians . 
  otherwise they will be blow out violently . 
  * we have our local roma population , but 30,000 from eastern europe are generating more problems than our 600,000-700 ,000 local * gitanos * ( that have a higher crime rate than the average also ) . 
  for example , the pickpockets in barcelona 's metro are from bulgaria .
