  from [ an interview ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/20131122/the-crisis-makes-spains-gypsies-even-more-invisible ) to the international spokeswoman of their spain 's gypsy foundation ( the fsg ) . 
   ** what is the relationship like between spain 's gitanos and the roma from eastern europe who live in this country ? 
  **  there is no relationship . 
  gitanos have tried to integrate and they see the roma of eastern europe as having traditions they have given up . 
  are you calling somebody living in the country where he was born immigrant ? 
  wtf ? 
  a party that lately is being a spanish nationalist ( within the acceptable ) moderate conservative founded by a woman that was pissed of after losing the primaries of the spanish socialist workers ' party . 
  she moved to right because the socialist party was competing already with the united left . 
  she also choose a [ not very successful actor ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/toni_cant%c3%b3 ) to lead the party in valencia , because the actor was popular there . 
  and it has worked ; he is a very shitty mp , but he was elected the only mp outside of madrid . 
  their positions are acceptable even if they are populist . 
  but , i have problems taking the party seriously . 
  this subreddit has an eurosceptic majority now . 
  and seriously , hidding behind an eu flag for saying eurosceptic arguments does n't seem right . 
  there is [ falangism ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/falangism ) . 
  worse than free market capitalism and socialism . 
  it 's responsable of some of the most stupid things in the spanish economy . 
  a third way system that actually consisted in private monopolies owned by the cronies that financed the rebellion , a weird civil law system that nobody understand but made rich the current pm family , a very rigid labour market that tried to make difficult for the employees changing employer or starting their own business , that made impossible to adapt the companies in the oil crisis ... 
  i do n't know why our civil law notaries [ registradores de la propiedad ) work with a private monopoly for every judicial district . 
  but , it came from them . 
  and it 's one of the burdens that our economy has . 
  if you do n't know that most of the users of this subreddit are right wing nationalist you do n't use this sub enough . 
  i will vote probably to euroesceptic left . 
  why them and no the movement for france ? 
  the swedish left is eurosceptic , and the ( not actually ) united left in spain is divided about that . 
  i would n't call socialist the francoist nostalgic . 
  they are very anti-free market capitalism and liberalism , but they hate more the socialist ; their grandparents won their rebellion against the government leaded by socialist . 
  there are serious rumours about the creation of a tradionalist , nationalist , catholic , anti-liberal and anti-socialist party by some members of the ruling party . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.elboletin.com/nacional/88436/derecha-emocionada-partido-abascal-quadras.html ) the back-history : [ santiago abascal conde ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/santiago_abascal_conde ) , former mp of the basque parliament and the grandson of the major of the basque capital during most of the dictatorship , left the ruling party in november . 
  he has been seeking supports for creating a new party that goes back to the traditional positions of the spanish right . 
  however , if they want to have a party ready for the european elections they are running out time . 
  catalonia would be a net contributor ( and the rest of spain would qualify for cohesion funds ) . 
  2nd generation immigrant , born in france and with french citizenship . 
  stay classy british press !, 
   who is this ignorant to sign some weird contracts with some shady companies ? 
  * [ 70 % of the spanish banks sold preferencial shares irregularly ] ( http://cincodias.com/cincodias/2013/05/28/mercados/1369769877_097391.html ) * [ bankia sold preferential shares to people with alzheimer ] ( http://www.europapress.es/economia/noticia-condenan-bankia-colocar-preferentes-cliente-alzheimer-20131221123934.html ) * preferential shares : [ bankia convicted for not doing the fitness test to their clients ] ( http://www.burgueraabogados.com/preferentes-condenan-a-bankia-por-no-hacer-el-test-de-idoneidad/ ) . 
  the government made mandatory a test about finances before buying complicated financial products . 
  the law was hard , sadly it was n't enforced . 
  the bailout of bankia and the other former regional saving banks by the eu had a strong local opposition . 
  and besides that , the bailout is going to be paid by the government instead of the banks . 
  why would increasing medicine 's prices for retires would require an emergency procedure ? 
  or reforming the labour market three times in 4 years with emergency procedures ? 
  the spanish government approved 28 laws with emergency procedures in 2012 and only 16 with normal procedures . 
  do you have the equivalent to royal decree-laws ? 
  that allows the government to legislate over things like labour market or pension system that are exclusive competence of the parliament . 
  the procedure is simple : 1 . 
  the ministers council approves the law . 
  the law is published in the official bulletin and it 's enforced immediately . 
  the lower camber of the parliament has 30 days for confirming the law , usually ratified with an express debate the same day as the law started to be enforced . 
  the last 3 labour market reforms were approved this way . 
  like the law that removed the council elected by the parliament elected by a qualified majority from the public tv and handed its control to somebody designed by the pm . 
  i knew about romania , hungary and greece . 
  not about estonia . 
  i can say that , you no . 
  and even that it is n't completely true for spain . 
  feli\u00e7 any nou !, 
  you can check the raw data here : http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/np822_en.pdf ** too long tldr : ** the first six months of 2013 : most of the emigrants are foreing residents . 
  migratory balances : * spaniards -24,860 * born in spain -19,202 * born abroad -5,658 * foreign nationals -100,056 * born in spain : -7,834 * born abroad : -92,222 destinations for spaniards : 1 . 
  united kingdom : 3,986 3 . 
  france : 3,908 4 . 
  germany : 3,275 5 . 
  united states of america : 2,514 6 . 
  switzerland : 1,931 7 . 
  colombia : 1,769 8 . 
  venezuela : 1,692 9 . 
  argentina : 1,371, 
   god knows why though , given our only slightly better situation . 
  we should change notes one day . 
  but i find that hard to believe . 
  edit : i gave more details about the destinations in other comment . 
  it 's not stable . 
  it has started to fall this year due to the massive emigration . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/np813_en.pdf ) edit : the government has approved also subsidies to companies that hire young people even if they are firing old people to hire them . 
  spain had a conservative dictatorship and it 's also very common . 
   are catalans insane . 
  leaving the eu would spell collapse for the local economy . 
  the economy is already collapsing . 
   ca n't this independence be somehow negotiated in a framework similar to that of the uks ? 
  why the radicalism ? 
  the spanish government does n't want to negotiate . 
  it * started * with small things like the catalan bullfighting banning , trying to replace replace catalan language as vehicular language in catalonia , basque country has fiscal privileges and catalonia ca n't get those , madrid is being privileged in investments by the central government . 
  and the actitude of the spanish government has n't been the best . 
  * fucking catalan people always crying even if their region is richer than average . 
  * you may know how it can be . 
  the catalan reasons for the independence are n't pure , of course . 
  the lack of fiscal privileges reason , they do n't want participate in the solidarity system . 
  ** the important bit . 
  ** the current catalan included in his program for his first period getting the same fiscal privileges that the basque country has , and the spanish government rejected to negotiate with him in a sort of humiliating way . 
  and artur mas ( the catalan president ) and his supporting media transformed that in an attack of spain to catalonia . 
  and it worked . 
  the independence became even more popular and went over 50 % in the polls and after a massive pro-independence demostration in the national day of catalonia ( 2012-09-11 ) he anounced that he will seek the independence . 
  artur m\u00e1s is probably the most capable politician in spain , but he has lost control of the situation . 
  he is a center-right liberal without any solid political principle other than some catalanism . 
  and at this moment he is losing in the polls to the independentist left that promised that they will declare independence unilaterally even if that means being out of the eu and not being recognized by the un . 
  the catalan situation is radicalized and spain has a spanish nationalist conservative party founded by former high officers of the dictatorship . 
  it 's too late for negotiations inside spain . 
  i am not going to forgive the bailout , never . 
  however , i am more angry with my government that with the foreign governments . 
  spain has also nuclear 21 % . 
  natural gas is n't so expensive .
