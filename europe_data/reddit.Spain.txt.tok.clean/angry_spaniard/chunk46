  the main problems of the system are : * volatility . 
  * market manipulation : * subsidies everywhere : capacity payments for combined cycle plants , bonus for special regimen renewal energy , subsidies for burning spanish coal ... * excess of capacity . 
  * bad regulation that made profitable to build an unneeded combined cycle plant . 
  * [ too many politicians in the board of the companies ] ( http://dd.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1qhzhf/spain_toughens_up_new_sun_tax_law_homes_can_now/cdd807e ) . 
  * the industry associated with a construction bubble is energy intensive : concrete , cement , steel ... the energy demand has fallen more than the economy just when a lot of plants have been finished . 
  that 's a literal translation , we import the gas from algeria . 
  the problem is that the energy cartel built a massive amount of combined cycle plants and we do n't have an economy to use the electricity that these plants can generate . 
  spain could export electricity , but france is also a net exporter ( and it 's cheaper usually ) , portugal has its economy in ruins also and does n't need more energy and morocco wants to generate its own energy and we do n't have so good connections and we are importing the gas anyway . 
  no , the plants are n't needed and should be shut down . 
  them or the nuclear plants , or the coal plants that use mostly spanish subsidized coal ( that generate 14 % of the spanish electricity . 
  ** spain ** the shit hit the fan in the energy sector . 
  the government is going full retard in energy policy and has turned against consumer associations , large utilities and renewable energy producers . . , the government is approving emergency decrees and retroactive changes that are going to backfire soon . 
  * too much gas for so scarce energy demand in spain .

  can you tell a more progressive law approved by this government ? 
  the combined cycle power plants , one of the largest industrial investments in recent history , are operating only to 10 % capacity after the fall in electricity demand . 
  at the country of the airports without airplanes , silent and empty toll roads and half-finished developments , the excesses age 's fables abound , and their morals . 
  here is another is narrated , but this is n't simple one more , because what is stuck is one of the largest industrial investments in recent history . 
  energy giants invested over 15 billion euros that were spent to raise tens of combined cycle power plants to generate electricity from natural gas . 
  now they just run 10 % of its capacity , the government discussed with the companies the temporary closure of some and there is several people who talk about dismantling them . 
  the official aspiration , a decade ago , was moving to a sustainable future hands in hand of more efficient plants , which use a cleaner fuel than coal or fossil fuel . 
  and that adapted better to renewable sources for its ability to adjust its contribution to the electricity network : something essential when the intermittent sun and wind gain prominence . 
  but the plans failed the test of lack of demand . 
  in 2008 , with the combined-cycle and at full speed , 32 % of the electricity consumed in spain was produced with gas , double than with coal ( 16 % ) . 
  so far , as expected . 
  but when the increasing usage of renewable energy combined with the crisis and other factors , the script failed : coal production holds ^ 1 , while generation from gas collapses . 
  this year , the combined cycle plants have generated only 9 % of the electricity , compared with 14 % produced in coal plants that emit more than twice the greenhouse gases . 
  pedro linares , co-director of the research center for energy economics , explains why , in the early years of this century , combined cycle plants were the main answer for companies to the then growing power demand . 
  `` there were cheap and easy to finance , construction was less expensive and faster than other conventional power plants and were less pollutants . 
  perceived little risk , there was over-investment , `` says the coordinator of the bp chair at the pontificia comillas university of madrid . 
  `` we must go back to the conditions under which these decisions were made , '' insist mariano marzo , professor of energy at the university of barcelona . 
  as in the nesting dolls , the gas would be a bubble inside another ( consumer ) within the huge credit bubble of the past decade . 
  `` energy planning is done years away , and then the demand in spain was rising like a rocket , '' emphasizes march . 
  the public sector support also contributed , with millionaire investment incentives charged in the electricity bill , that can recover more than a third of spending several years . 
  only germany stands comparison in continental europe , though even there the deployment was n't so intense . 
  since the first combined cycle plant opened in 2002 until the 27,000 megawatts of installed power were reached , it 's the technology able to generate more energy in spain - , only seven years passed . 
  and pending applications reached double that figure . 
  [ ... ] the auction system in effect multiplies the effects of lack of demand . 
  because not only gives priority to renewables , but placed ahead hydraulic and nuclear power stations ( most owned by the big three ) , which is paid in addition to the price of the last conventional thermal to enter ( coal or gas naturally ) in the system . 
  `` nuclear and hydroelectric plants , which have recouped most of the investment are those that benefit most , '' said fabra . 
  [ ... ] the future of combined cycle plants , however , depends on what the government has been two years avoiding to face . 
  `` they have to define a new regulatory framework for the remuneration of the entire energy system , '' explains professor march , and spain is also missing a new energy plan to 2030 , to incorporate the new economic conditions and clarify which energy mix will be better . 
  a process that the government , pushed by controversial power auction for the next quarter , seems now willing to address . 
  but in a desperate situation , without known planning , and with the dubious distinction of having turned against consumer associations , large utilities and renewable energy producers . 
  there are more details but i was tired of fixing the translation . 
  full transation [ here ] ( http://translate.google.es/translate?hl=es&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fsociedad.elpais.com%2fsociedad%2f2013%2f12%2f26%2factualidad%2f1388082770_720869.html ) ------- 1 . 
  spain is giving ( decreasing ) subsidies to generating electricity with spanish coal until 2018 starting the last steps of the phasing out in 2015 . 
  nobody likes that , not even british people . 
  you should ask to their conservative government . 
  how many generations should live there before becoming norwegian ? 
   the way you describe the situation makes it seem very bleak . 
  the situation is very bleak . 
  that make sense . 
   is there any political party capable of making the necessary reforms ? 
  the current government ( pp/conservatives ) concentrates all the powers has an absolute majority and control the justice . 
  but , they lack the will to reform . 
  honestly the best spanish parties with an acceptable leadership and a clear project are basque and catalan nationalist . 
  as alternative parties in spain we have : * united left : not actually united , the party with the most constant internal fights : having libertarian communist , eco-socialists and ex-communists ( do n't ask about their current ideology , they do n't know either ) , and generic left-wing like the current leader and former farmers union leader in the same coalition is n't easy . 
  they already had some fights for the next eu elections because do n't agree in if we should continue in the eu and the euro . 
  julio anguita , [ the most respected previous leader created recently a citizens platform ] ( http://www.frentecivicosomosmayoria.es/quienes-somos/ ) , actually is the only left platform one with a clear project for the country , left wing policies and euroscepticism . 
  * upyd : moderate party without a clear ideology , it has been officially center-left and center-right . 
  it was founded by a high officer of the socialist party ( rosa diez ) after losing the internal elections for the leadership ( the united left was already fighting for left wing voters thus she created a * center * party ) . 
  the party is growing steadily and with the current conservative government they have been a populist , spanish nationalist and moderate conservative opposition party . 
  * equo : recently a green coalition separated from the united left has been created by the former leader of the spanish branch of greenpeace , very weak . 
  on the bright side the biggest party to right of the ruling party has 20,000 voters . 
  there is n't any racist or xenophobic party in any spanish regional or national parliament . 
  however , this is n't surprising even our right-wing dictatorship was n't exactly xenophobic and our dictator had [ moorish bodyguards ] ( http://forum.axishistory.com/download/file.php?id=22943&amp;sid=b6935ef55fb1b9fab4d9095fdc05b8b3 ) . 
   if not , how can they be made ? 
  creating a party in spain is n't exactly difficult : a lot of them have been created . 
  i do n't expect any new big party in the next years ; unless in the left julio anguita and his * frente civico * ( civic fron ) or the plataforma de afectados por la hipoteca ( mortgage victims association ) participate in it . 
  and it 's unlikely .
