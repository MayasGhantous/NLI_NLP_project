  in the right : some right wing liberals got a lot of money and created the p-lib supportting privatizations , welfare and education cuts , free market reforms , and a more regressive tax system and they got around 2,000 voters and their advertising was everywhere . 
  i think there is political space for a traditionalist conservative anti-free market party , but i do n't know what that would solve and the pp tries to cover also that and the pro-free market . 
   when i read your posts i become very depressed about the future of spain . 
  so i do when i write them.but , i do n't see reasons to be optimistic . 
  there are some very basic things : * ** legal security : ** do n't approve reforms with emergency decrees . 
  use normal laws with an standard legislative procedure . 
  do n't change laws retroactively : like changing the subsidies for electricity auto-consumption retroactively , then taxing it ... * ** independent regulators : ** seriously this is extremely fucked . 
  the central bank is n't independent . 
  the energy , telecommunications and market regulators are controlled by the government . 
  [ the current government is constantly favoring telefonica ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-13-621_en.htm ) who * employed * pm 's wife and the former labour minister is in its [ payroll ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2008/04/29/actualidad/1209457022_850215.html ) and other 20 ex-high officers of the government and the [ wife of the most likely candidate ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2012/03/22/espana/1332412498.html ) for the socialist workers ' party . 
  and the energy sector is even worse . 
  you can read the full list of people in the cartel 's payroll [ here ] ( http://dd.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1qhzhf/spain_toughens_up_new_sun_tax_law_homes_can_now/cdd807e ) . 
  * ** let 's do the labour market less weird : ** i am young but i am against subsidies to hire young people , that does n't create employment . 
  and all the special contracts : that have been created for job promotion only make the labour market more complicated . 
  about the severance pay , it 's in the eu average ; it is cheaper than france , italy and germany but more expensive than uk , austria or ireland . 
  but , it has a very high standard deviation because all the dozens of special cases that the government has introduced with irregular procedures are in court and when one is voided the companies that used it have to pay all the pending salaries until the veredict 's date and then an non-objective layoff or rehire the employee . 
  besides that the definition of the objective layoff cases is n't very clear often and a judgement for deciding if the usage of the case is right or no can take years . 
  * ** judicial system : ** it 's not even funny . 
  the most simple case can take years . 
  there is n't an efficient way of collecting debts , or resolving labour conflicts . 
  justice is politicized and technologically obsolete . 
  * ** local administration and bureaucracy : ** for a software developer ( like myself ) is easy starting to create a company with only one employee and start working . 
  48 hours , that can be called quick . 
  the big mess is the local and regional administration . 
  are you doing construction works ? 
  let 's get a certificate that says that there are n't archaeological objects in the area . 
  let 's wait some months . 
  your bathrooms must meet regulations for handicapped people , wait a few months for inspection , emergency exits the same . 
  good luck dealing with local administrations outside certain cities . 
  there is n't any government support the local administration and it 's coordinated by the most corrupt institution the province . 
  * ** corruption : ** we have too much , i am not sure about what to do about this . 
  most of the high officers of the government ( and the [ royal family ] ( http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/aleqm5gnlzqbjjgnweyatfitfvs72rdg7g?docid=cng.9b7f33b760e33ef47d61c1afd7a5b14e.621&amp;hl=en ) ) are involved in corruption , and trying to protect other politicians from the justice . 
  i do n't think that this is good for the economy . 
  * ** a better elite selection system : ** when our pm and half of the government are openly corrupt , the former president of the subsidized businessmen association is in prison for stealing the companies that he managed and dozens of high officers of the organization are involved in dirty stuff , the second biggest union ( the one linked with the social-democratic opposition ) has dozens of corruption affairs ( mostly in connection with andalusian regional government ) ; something is fucked in the selection system . 
  the more corrupt you are more quicky you will thrive . 
  * a clear division of powers among administrations . 
  there are regulations about the same fields by regional , national and municipal administrations . 
  and what regulation should be enforced changes with the central government alliances . 
  it also changes with the region . 
  you should comply with regional government in catalonia , local government in basque country and national government in other places in some fields . 
  * ** retrain the labour force : * 50 % of the jobless are completely unskilled . 
  however we applied austerity to it and we have less budget for that than when the unemployment was 8 % . 
  the vocational training system ( trades or whatever you call it ) is completely fucked also . 
  spain has a serious gap 30 % of people with a college degree , 25 % without basic education , 30 % with basic education and the rest with some kind of extra education that does n't lead to any qualified or semi-qualified position . 
  this is the more neutral reforms only . 
  i tried to avoid anything ideological , but i think that these things at least are needed . 
  seriously . 
  why do you think that france and other countries with more expensive severance pay , bigger government , higher taxes and stricter regulations are better off than spain ? 
  every year has been worse than the previous one . 
  the government is trying to decrease the private sector salaries for non-management positions ( the last 4 trimesters the wages have decreased ) , promoting the replacement of permanent employees with temporary workers and day laborers , cutting unemployment benefits , giving subsidies for hiring people younger than 30 , extending the probation time to a year ( declared contrary to some international treaty that we signed recently ) and the government approved recently a reform to pay the overtime of part time workers with the normal pay instead of the overtime pay , making cheaper the objective layoffs ( but half of the new cases like an employee that has been sick more than 9 days are in court , actually all the reforms are in court ) ... and some other things ... 
  but wait , most of the reforms were approved with emergency decrees and the constitution forbids to modify any regulation affecting fundamental rights with emergency decrees , that means that most of these reforms could be void in two years and the employers would have to take care retroactively of the consequences of this . 
  the legal security in spain keeps being a joke . 
  edit : i think that these measures in the long term will * help * to create unskilled jobs in sectors that do n't care about having a workforce of temporary workers and day laborers . 
  i do n't like the direction that my country is taking , it 's not a secret here . 
  no , those abandoned housing complex can hurt a country . 
  just saying . 
  i disliked vatican city because : why the hell the catholic church has a country ? 
  i do n't recognize that kosovo . 
  shut up danish !, 
  when you are saying european you mean northern european . 
  and it 's not a question . 
  argentina and uruguay are like italy speaking spanish . 
  these two countries are very southern european culturally . 
  whatever , probably most of northern europe do n't feel like spain and italy are true european . 
  the [ crown of aragon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crown_of_aragon ) . 
  only for pissing spain . 
  what about argentina and uruguay ? 
   as for asturias , the map is wrong : foro asturias is faaaar from nationalistic . 
  that is , they do n't want independence , just ask more things for asturias . 
  they do n't want more self-government either . 
  it 's only a party that was created by cascos because rajoy did n't want him as asturian premier . 
  anyway , all the asturian mp are support the current regional state except the united left that wants a federal republic . 
  but they are a nation wide party that has also mp in other regions . 
  in addition , in andalusia there are n't regionalism in the parliament . 
  the andalusist party did n't get any mp in the last regional elections , however they had mp in the past and sanchez gordillo and his [ cut-bai ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collective_for_the_unity_of_workers_%e2%80%93_andalusian_left_bloc ) are in the united left coalition and besides the libertarian communism they are also andalusian nationalists . 
  but not exactly the same even as galicia or valencia . 
  to be honest england did most of the stabbing , strangling and starving the irish . 
  did you do the same for the ones that joined the international brigades in the spanish civil war ? 
  is this allowed by the european human rights convention ? 
  ** spain ** are there other spaniards here ?

   who supplied this information ? 
  the most likely answer [ luis barcenas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luis_b%c3%a1rcenas ) , aka luis el cabr\u00f3n . 
  he is currently in prison as the scapegoat for the ilegal financing of the ruling party , the current pm and party leader did n't know anything !!!, 
  and he has started to colaborate with the justice lately after seeing that his party is n't keeping him out of prison . 
  it seems like barcenas is trying to negotiate a free of jail card for forcing the replacement of rajoy as pm .
