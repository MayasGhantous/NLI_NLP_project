  he is still avoiding to filter information the he probably has about the corruption affairs that the current justice minister committed when he was the major of madrid , or the previous conservative pm . 
  however , it does n't seem very well organized . 
  rajoy 's position seems solid . 
  i do n't follow turkey policies . 
  spain is ruled by an openly corrupt government that it 's trying to keep the power : * manipulating the justice . 
  [ too much ] ( http://www.eurointelligence.com/news-details/article/el-pais-questions-political-independence-of-constitutional-court-president.html?no_cache=1 ) . 
  [ affecting the royal family ] ( http://www.torontosun.com/2013/05/07/spanish-court-suspends-charges-against-princess-cristina ) . 
  [ and removing judges who tried to prosecute conservative politicians who ruled regional saving banks ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/06/26/inenglish/1372267790_233390.html ) * manipulating the media . 
  the government took over the public broadcasting corporation with an emergency decree to replace the previous direction with party members appointed by the pm , before the direction was with members of the two biggest parties and 2 biggest union . 
  [ link ] ( http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2012/04/20/actualidad/1334923490_322624.html ) besides this there are also ~ ~ subsidies ~ ~ institutional advertising to conservative media , including media run by the catholic church . 
  * pandering the religious right : abortion , the catholic doctrine is back a subject in the public education as a first level subject its teacher will be selected by the catholic church and future governments would n't be able to fire them without changing the constitution . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.publico.es/449004/el-bufete-del-hijo-de-gallardon-defendio-al-kamikaze-indultado ) * taking over regulators : the central bank was n't independent before , and now either . 
  in addition , the more independent regulators that we had for other sectors are now integrated in an body that is directed by a team elected by the congress by absolute majority ( the pp has that alone ) . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.europapress.es/economia/noticia-congreso-aprueba-nombramiento-diez-consejeros-cnmc-20130905151321.html ) * giving pardons irregulary . 
  that 's important from torturer police officers to clients of minister of justice 's son . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.publico.es/449004/el-bufete-del-hijo-de-gallardon-defendio-al-kamikaze-indultado ) * legislation with emergency procedures all the time * authoritarian laws that restrict fundamental rights like the new civic security law . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/29/us-spain-security-idusbre9as0mx20131129 ) * giving special status to bullfighting with subisidies and more legal protection . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/02/12/spanish-parliament-votes-on-bullfighting-protection-after-one-region-banned-it/ ) * retroactive energy regulation reforms ... * restart the diplomatic conflict with uk around gibraltar . 
  and the list can continue a lot . 
  this is the more destructive government that i have met . 
   if you ca n't sustain a kid , do n't make one . 
  there 's plenty you can do to prevent it . 
  yes , like an abortion . 
  spain ca n't trust you with the decision of having a baby , but you have to raise one . 
  this does n't even make sense . 
  the current ruling party was founded by a [ former dictatorship minister ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manuel_fraga_iribarne ) . 
  and holds sort of the same posiitons and it has the same core supporters . 
  catholic church outside of the basque country ( they support the pnv there ) , high level public servants , businessman class , rural elites , aristocracy and landowners , small business owners in regulated sectors ( tobacconist , taxis , pharmacies ) ... 
  however , the dictatorship was fascist only some years . 
  the dictator was a treacherous motherfucker and the only consisten points his trajectory where catholicism , spanish nationalism , antiliberalism , anticomunism and antiparliamentarism . 
  when he saw the italy and germany losing the war he started to replace falangist by military and leaders of catholic groups ( asociaci\u00f3n cat\u00f3lica de propagandistas , opus dei and others ) . 
  and at the same time his personal bodyguards were moors until 1958 . 
  it 's sort of representative , but not completely . 
  most of the spanish people are conservative and support a big and paternalistic government with a traditional conception of spain ( except maybe in catalonia ) . 
  and the political class reflects it . 
  the reform is more conservative than most of the supporters of the conservative party wanted . 
  most of them wanted the law that legalized the abortion in 1985 . 
  the law legalized abortion for rape , deformities ( including down 's syndrome ) and physical or psychological damages risk for the mother the official position was going back to that , but they are having problems with the dictatorship nostalgic and they need them for the eu elections . 
  there are rumors about some of them creating a new party . 
  the biggest party to the right of the spanish ruling party has around 20,000 voters . 
  the pm does n't care about the abortion , this is about keeping his party together for the eu elections for him and mobilizing the only people that may support him in this elections with a low participation that are seen as unimportant , the hardcore right . 
  in addition , many members of the opus dei hold high positions in the party including the minister of interior and the opus dei is important in the legal and illegal funding of the party . 
  edit : tldr : it 's sort of representative , but most people was happy with the current law , and even in the conservative people the most popular option was a more moderate reform . 
  that would be against eu legislation . 
  you should write it like you should have worked at least 6 months or have a parent/legal tutor living in living in the country who has worked 6 months in the country and this is valid only until you are 26 . 
  i think that spain has it written like that . 
  it 's completely sure . 
  the conservative party has an absolute majority . 
  185 mp of 350 . 
  are we talking about the eu ? 
  you can drive through andorra and join spaniards and french in the tobacco smuggling tradition ( eu countries have high tobacco taxes ) ; there are some shady banks , sky resorts and a spa also . 
   that surprises me that spain has no law of starting again after personal bankruptcy !, 
  thanks for letting me know !, 
  i wonder what the public policy reason for this is ? 
  as far as i know , the reason is that the banks opposes to it . 
  [ the default rate is in all time records ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/08/19/inenglish/1376933957_439640.html ) . 
  that 's one of the main demands of the mortgage victims association ( [ pah ] ( http://afectadosporlahipoteca.com/ ) ; yes it 's a thing ) , with dation in payment and stop evicting people without a place to live after it . 
  they got the [ eu citizen 's prize ] ( http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/news-brief/3858061-european-citizen-s-prize-doesn-t-please-everyone ) this year . 
  i can predict eu advice : make so crazily expensive the highways and universities that nobody uses them , but keep all the expenses ; and some vat raises for fresh food , electricty and water supply . 
   he can then probably start again ( although with a record for insolvency ) . 
  i do n't know the bankruptcy laws in bulgaria , but the people tends to assume that the laws are like in their country everywhere . 
  for example , the spanish laws do n't have anyway of starting again the debts are for life and asking for a bankruptcy procedure only means that you will keep any income below minimum wage ( or 150 % for people who has lost their home ) and a percentage of any income above that ( [ rules in spanish ] ( http://www.edufinet.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1298&amp;itemid=178 ) ) . 
  and the debts grows with a maximum default interest 12 % . 
  [ and that maximum was set recently ] ( http://www.abc.es/economia/20130130/abci-jueces-desahucios-venta-201301301628.html ), 
  we amended our constitution to include a promise to pay back all the debt . 
   loans to meet payment on the interest and capital of the state 's public debt shall always be deemed to be included in budget expenditure and their payment shall have absolute priority . 
  these appropriations may not be subject to amendment or modification as long as they conform to the terms of issue . 
  [ source : new article 135 of the spanish constitution ] ( http://aei.pitt.edu/32483/1/pb_253_abad_and_hernandez_on_spanish_constitutional_reform.pdf ) : included after secret negotiations with germany and the ecb with an express procedure , without negotiations with non system parties ( pp-psoe only ) and without referendum . 
  if we have to choose between pension or loans we have pay loans ; if we have to choose between health care or education or loans , we have to pay loans . 
  spain would have to change its constitution to do a default , this gives an additional security . 
   the question is : will there be enough political will for funding space exploration , including this new race to the moon , if it is not done in the name of competition and defeating an enemy ? 
  i am expecting the austerity will hit soon the participation of some eu countries in the esa , including mine . 
  we are not concerned about it . 
  our romanian population is emigrating because the high poverty and unemployment rates . 
  if you want to keep them out you only need to make living in your country as harsh as living in romania . 
  the average romanian hates gypsies also . 
  but the british are supposed to hate the romanian people in general and think that all of them are vampire gypsies that are going to move to uk to drain to death the country . 
  spain crushing people with an entrepreneurial spirit as always . 
  we will create a multibillionary project to manufacture our own version would be submerge only and all the budget will be wasted before finishing a prototype . 
  what 's that double standard ? 
  te alcohol is actually worse . 
  and i support total legalization including heroin . 
  maybe , you can try to read this with google translate ir chrome http://www.elmundo.es/madrid/2013/12/09/52a63ea90ab7405c1a8b456c.html, 
  no , he went full retard and said [ that ] ( http://noticias.lainformacion.com/espana/rajoy-destaca-del-funeral-por-mandela-que-espana-gano-el-mundial-en-ese-estadio_kxygwetdhs99xsh4vfq4w2/ ), 
  there some other funny things : * madrid is scrapping the the ghost train to the warner that cost 85 millions . 
  * rajoy is a retard and when he was asked about mandela 's funeral.he said that he was happy that the funeral was in the stadium where spain won the world cup . 
  edit : [ source ] ( http://noticias.lainformacion.com/espana/rajoy-destaca-del-funeral-por-mandela-que-espana-gano-el-mundial-en-ese-estadio_kxygwetdhs99xsh4vfq4w2/ ) * his advisors may have notice that because he read the answer to a question done by the conservative newspaper abc a meeting with the press . 
  * more proofs of corruption in caja madrid . 
  still the only penalized guy was the judge who tried to put in prison a personal friend of the previous conservative pm . 
   no , that is if you exclude eastern europe . 
  your regions are not more underdevloped , nor do you have a smaller gdp/capita than poland , bulgaria , romania etc. 
  so , no , you should be contributing . 
  the regional structural funds are given to regional governments . 
  and the spanish regions go from $ 30,829 euros per capita in the basque country to $ 15,308 in extremadura , in purchasing power extremadura is below poland , but above romania and bulgaria . 
  uk has also regions getting structural funds and they are richer than us . 
  you can tell that this promotes bad government , because the uk has been mistreating everything except southeast and london and as prize they are getting structural funds for cornwall and parts of wales . 
  you can see the map [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/what/future/img/eligibility20142020.pdf )  and there should be a time limit on that , short window when one can apply plus a bloody good reason why one have n't developed . 
  why have n't italy ? 
  why have n't spain ? 
  you have had a lot of time , a lot , so it is a choice .
