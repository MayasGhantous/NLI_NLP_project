  the judge is going to need to be really careful specially if he gets a prosecutor friendly with the government like the ones in the g\u00fcrtel , noos and caja madrid cases . 
  my bet for spain : rajoy stays as pm after 2015 ruling with the support of the psoe of pedro s\u00e1nchez ( maybe with a new leader ) . 
  the opposition is leaded by podemos and pablo iglesias , this is a new leader . 
  yes , even if i do n't see the point , but i am too obsessed with politics lately . 
  that 's true you only have to pay if you are connected to the grid . 
  i do n't know anybody except some illegal housing that it 's not connected to the grid . 
  btw , the grid is private . 
  it 's owned by ree , that 's owned by ~ ~ the usual suspects ~ ~ a stable core and the government that owns a 20 % . 
  * caja madrid was the regional saving bank of the capital region . 
  technically a private foundation , but under the control of a council formed by regional politicians , union leaders ( workers and the business union representatives ) * the managers of the entity had salaries and incentives . 
  but that was n't enough . 
  they had legal company cards also . 
  * they wanted more , and therefore they gave themselves company cards that they could use for personal expenses without being registered in any report or being communicated to the tax service . 
  * [ english article ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/10/02/inenglish/1412258921_975122.html ) telling the short version . 
  * they tried to hide the expenses totaling 15 millions as a software error . 
  i have the feeling that they steal as usual : * to see how the privatization of aena ( the airports ) is being done keeping it as a monopoly and selling before the public offer to ~ ~ the usual suspects ~ ~ a stable core part of the company . 
  * [ this is the list ] ( http://i.imgur.com/51fj4bd.png ) of politicians in the payroll of the electric cartel . 
  these are the only companies that can participate in the electricity and heating sectors in spain . 
  [ eon has been forced to leave by the cartel recently ] ( http://cincodias.com/cincodias/2014/04/04/empresas/1396614717_307324.html ) * they also got approved many restrictions and fees for companies and houses that want to generate electricity that it 's not them . 
  if you want to generate electricity in spain independently you have to pay to the cartel a capacity fee ( the fee is paid to the private companies no to the government ) * the bailout of the toll roads to nowhere built and managed by the companies that fund the ruling party . 
  * the judges of the g\u00fcrtel ( public works fraud ) and caja madrid cases have been expulsed of the judicial career and francisco camps and miguel blesa are still free . 
  * the judicial system in general is joke with prosecutions that take more than a decade , cases being void all the time due to procedure errors , pardons ... * the pm giving privileges to a civil law notaries branch leaded by his brother . 
  of the picture : only one of them is in prison ( jaume matas ) . 
  and none of them has been accused in court for the envelops in cash with some money for expenses that they got from the treasurer . 
  the current pm got an average of $ 50,000 euros/year in 19 years . 
  the party reformed recently the headquarters with black money , the conclusion is going to be again that the treasurer did it without the knowledge of anybody else in the party . 
  edit : remember rajoy has n't been accused of anything he said that he discovered that the party that he leads was financed illegally by the press and that he though that getting 50,000 euros/year in cash for personal expenses besides a 100,000 euros/year salary from the party and non telling to the tax service about the cash was legal . 
  and the judge decided not to accuse him or anybody in a similar situation . 
  the official version over the illegal funding of the party between 1990 and 2008 is that the treasurer did everything alone . 
  yes the hundreds of millions of euros paid for the contracts of the motorways , the airports , the rails , the legal protection for the illegal housing in the mediterranean ... everything without the knowledge of the direction of the party . 
  direction that is the same people still . 
  let 's see * they are in the [ european united left -- nordic green left ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_united_left%e2%80%93nordic_green_left ) group in the european parliament -- the leaders : * pablo iglesias : former member of the youth of the communist party , former chair of the board of the left wing foundation ceps .

  * [ juan carlos monedero ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/juan_carlos_monedero ) : advisor of hugo ch\u00e1vez between 2005 and 2010 . 
  and clear defensor of the xxi century socialism . 
  * [ i\u00f1igo errejon ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%8d%c3%b1igo_errej%c3%b3n ) : current chair of the board of ceps , he was working for venezuela through the foundation until the day that he started to organize the campaign for the european elections . 
  pablo iglesias and i\u00f1igo errejon had a learning tour at uruguay , ecuador and bolivia ( they avoided venezuela ) . 
  they said that these countries are a model of the way of recovering the sovereignty of a country .

  the people can read your username and history . 
  we are going to build the a ghost airport . 
  your case is different , this far right guy that has lived all his live in the us and according to him one of his grandparents was from spain . 
  an oppressed russian minority !, 
  be careful , you may catch * local self-defense * forces . 
  what 's up with pretending being spanish ? 
  we reformed our education system . 
  now the catholic religion subject will count to calculate the grades for scholarships of the students ( that take it ) , the catholic religion teachers can not lose their jobs unless by their bishop decision , the maximum number of students per classroom has been increased to 30 in the mandatory education and catalonia should offer publicly funded education in spanish ( they are n't ) . 
  at least these are the points that were more under discussion . 
  everything is at the constitutional court and we will have another law when we change the pm . 
  this is 7th law regulating non-college education in 40 years of democracy . 
  the two main points are always catholic religion status and language war . 
  they had the police below , and refused to get down willingly . 
  a police officer is using a ladder near them to get up the fence . 
  nop . 
  the communist were a minority on the popular front . 
  who are you trying to misslead ? 
  the second republic had also a right wing government during 2 years . 
  when has had spain a communist government ? 
  they will still do better than the ones in their 40s . 
  those will probably wo n't work again . 
   ( as i am guessing that most who immigrate this way instead of the traditional legal route are not highly educated and very poor if you want to immigrate illegally to spain you overstay as a tourist even moroccans do that .
