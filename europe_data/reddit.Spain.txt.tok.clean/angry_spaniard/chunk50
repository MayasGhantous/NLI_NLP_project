  yes , yes and yes . 
   exactly . 
  catalan is virtually unspoken outside of catalu\u00f1a , valencia and baleares . 
  [ la franja ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_franja ) . 
  in spain you need to say that because the spanish socialist workers party ( psoe ) is capitalist , monarchist and is n't exactly an advocate of separation of church and state ... 
  the ideology changed but the name of the party is still the same . 
  the only anti-capitalist party in the spanish parliament is the united left , and they have hard time deciding exactly what they support because it 's a coalition of parties with contradictory projects . 
  its ** speaker ** , they do n't have leaders . 
  they have a flat organization . 
  * `` delenda est monarchia '' * is latin and means ` the monarchy has to be destroyed ' . 
  it 's a paraphrase of `` carthago delenda est '' . 
  the first republican spaniard in using it was ortega y gasset in [ el error belenguer ] ( http://recherche.univ-lyon2.fr/grimh/ressources/nacionalismos/espana/1930ortegadelenda.htm ) ( sorry in spanish ) . 
  the article had a big repercussion back in the day and it was an important part of the campaign for the 2nd republic . 
   are you a spanish republican ? 
  i am spaniard and i am republican , but i am not politically active and i do n't live in spain anymore . 
  i keep that anyway . 
  it 's something inspired in anarchism , but participating in politcs . 
  [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libertarian_socialism ) it 's anticapitalist left . 
  the royal family is at this moment very unpopular with the [ corruption affairs ] ( http://www.efe.com/efe/noticias/english/portada/spain-princess-cristina-named-suspect-noos-case/4/63/2005982 ) , cronyism , [ getting and selling gifts gotten in shady deals ] ( http://www.motorpasion.com/otros/el-rey-vende-un-maserati-quattroporte-por-100000-euros ) , and waste of public money , that they are committing . 
  do you notice how many spanish republican flags there are in this subreddit ? 
  the monarchy is getting a valoration of 3.58 over 10 in the polls as institution . 
  the cup ( the small libertarian socialist party with 3 mp ) wants independence out of the eu all the others want to be in the eu . 
   it 's not like the rest of spain would be worse off economically if catalonia left , is it ? 
  yes , it would be . 
  after the basque territories and the artificially rich capital in the middle of nowhere , catalonia is the richest region and the basque territories have a special fiscal system and are less populated . 
  catalonia is by far the biggest contributor to the spanish cohesion funds . 
  the restructuring of the welfare for poor areas like andalusia with a 35 % unemployment and half of the income per capita would be a disaster and it would require a drastic descent in living standards in the full country or catastrophic in the poorest areas . 
  but , on the * bright * side maybe spain would qualify again for eu cohesion funds . 
   the spanish government ca n't do anything about it short of starting a war and they would n't do that , would they ? ', 
  and the law says that the spanish government can start a war . 
  [ from the english version ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/12/12/inenglish/1386856018_634934.html ) the woman who is cut in the picture , and * el pa\u00eds * does n't say her name , is [ joana ortega alemany ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joana_ortega_i_alemany ) the vice president of catalonia . 
  finally the referendum will have the support of : * converg\u00e8ncia & uni\u00f3 : coalition of liberal nationalist and conservative nationalists * erc : social-democrats pro-independence . 
  * icv : eco-socialists and nationalist . 
  opposition : * psc ( catalonian party associated with the psoe ) : social-democrats pro-spain ( sort of federalist ) have rejected the referendum . 
  their relationship with the psoe is similar to the relationship cdu-csu . 
  * pp : right wing spanish ruling party . 
  * ciutadans -- partit de la ciutadania : center * left * constitutionalist . 
  non-affiliated with any spain-wide party . 
  in the parliament : * pro-referendum : 65 % ( 87 mp ) * against : 35 % ( 48 mp ) it seems like a clear mandate . 
   i 'm sure they are not stupid enough to be willing to start a civil war . 
  yeah , we can trust the [ intelligence ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rkb1cp5.jpg ) of the [ spanish pm ] ( http://i.imgur.com/x3aawhv.jpg ) . 
  [ he seem a sensitive guy . 
   what sort of opinions do the rest of spain have ? 
  we know the government do n't want it , but what about the average person elsewhere in spain ? 
  mostly against independence , many people including myself support self-determination , but i would say that we are a minority . 
  and the re-centralization of spain is gaining popularity in the more mainline spain to reduce duplicities and differences between territories . 
  also , the conservative media says that because catalonia is spanish sovereign territory only all the spaniards together can change its status . .  from what i 've read about catalonia , it seems almost certain that they will be better off independent than as a part of spain . 
  the spanish government has promised that they will be worse off and that will be sure because spain will veto their access to the eu , the eea or access to the common market in any way and supports putting commercial tariffs with an independent catalonia . 
  that 's completely an scorched earth strategy because most of the spanish exports and imports with europe are through catalonia . 
   is n't the spanish army obligated to prevent the secession due to the constitution ? 
  no , the constitution authorizes the government to use the army to prevent the secession even with a bloodbath . 
  but there is n't any obligation . 
   or is it more of a ` we do n't talk about this ' kinda deal ? 
  it 's mostly like that . 
  the official position is like ` catalonia does n't have the right to self-determination and the spanish government will avoid that within spanish laws ' . 
  and that 's it . 
   what happens if they hold this and a ` yes ' comes back ? 
  the spanish government has n't answered to that . 
  some people in low level positions have said stuff about suspending the autonomy or sending the army but the spanish government has n't said anything official about it except that the spanish law forbids the celebration of the referendum . 
   guy verhofstadt will never make it . 
  the liberal faction is just too small . 
  it will be a socialdemocrat or a conservative . 
  it will be a conservative , with liberal or socialdremocrat support . 
   the destructive practises of spain 's fishing armada . 
  the greenpeace article is interesting talks about something that is known we are promoting capital intensive high technology big ships and the scrapping of the more traditional fishing practices . 
  it 's one of the reasons why the job destruction and the reduction of the number of ships ( around 45 % both ) has been way higher than the reduction in the capacity of the fleet . 
  and they advice to do the opposite . 
  what do you think ? 
   the fact that you support everything that is criscised above is beyond me . 
  i do n't support everything , but i support some things . 
  half of the traditional fleet is gone , it has been harsh the economy of those areas . 
  i support that spain fishes in other countries territorial waters if has the support of the local government . 
  there are some grey situations like the fishing in the western sahara with morocco license , but that 's how the world works . 
  i did n't support illegal fishing . 
  i said that you ca n't expect a quicker reduction of the traditional fleet . 
   and , the problem is , you choose to . 
  i mean , all countries that fish have the same problems , but one does n't have to side with the fishing industry , not at all . 
   dates ? 
  why should you receive money at all ? 
  for the same reason as uk , france and germany . 
  because there are rules and we fulfill the requirements . 
   also , you surpassed the the threshold , but have still still received money . 
  link , page 1 . why ? 
  the concept of transition funds was created to reduce the influx of funds . 
  cyprus in the same program now , they are over the threshold and are going to get transition funds until 2020 . 
   so , now you are finally getting less , which you should have had less in 2006 . 
  btw , with that per capita income , you can bloody well pay for your fishermen 's unemployment benefits . 
  we are using 4 % of our gdp in paying unemployment benefits already . 
  and 40 % of the jobless do n't get benefits . 
  ( [ spanish , sorry ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/economia/2013/12/03/529d8d6b0ab740d2318b4571.html ) ) . 
   also , spain will at least receive money until 2020 . 
  that is 34 bloody years !, 
  how long should we pay for spain ? 
  not everybody can be a net contributor for obvious reasons . 
  i would n't expect the spanish economy to get better in the future . 
  most of the long term problems have n't fixed . 
  however , at this point spain is n't the biggest burden in the budget . 
  and actually i would be more concerned about the fact that italy is moving from contributor to retriever . 
   greece is hardly on the way to becoming a net contributor , are they ? 
  how many decades shall we pay for them ?
