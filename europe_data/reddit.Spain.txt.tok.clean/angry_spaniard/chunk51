  greece is probably going to get more funds in this budget than in the previous one . 
  that 's logical with the sharp fall in gdp . 
  the eu seems to think that everything is going ok with greece . 
   how is that an argument ? 
  you seemed to think that spain is rejecting any * reform . 
  *  cap , the single biggest post in the eu budget . 
  you have fought against it , the south vs the north . 
  not the biggest post anymore , if you put together cohesion and structural funds like the eu does . 
  and the fight has been more like net exporters of food vs net importers . 
  [ netherlands position about cap reform ] ( http://jsis.washington.edu/euc//file/2012%20meu/position%20paper%20cap%20reform/netherlands%20cap%20reform%20positionpaper.pdf ) , has sided often with france and spain . 
  in that document they support a reform that the spanish government opposed but the farmer unions supported the capping the subsidies for the biggest landowners , because we should allow to grow without limits the * more competitive * landowners . 
  edit : maybe you should give more details about what do you want . 
   and , the fact that you have cut down your fishing fleet 45 % does n't give you any prices . 
  you had the biggest most oversized one , you have refused to cut it down and you have n't cut it down more than anyone else . 
  the fact is that spain has cut the fleet exactly as agreed . 
  you can think that it should be more . 
  and spain is the country to blame for all the illegal fishing for the whole world . 
  that again . 
   why should i pay for a country that voted against reforms , ruins the environment on purpose and clearly do not want to improve . 
  what reforms are you talking about ? 
   you are so fucking spanish oriented and clearly , with your example about the us want us to pay for you for the next 150 years . 
  then you are not interested in improvement if that is your aim . 
  i am not interested in setting up my grandchildren to pay for spain while you vote against reforms , like you have always done . 
  when have you voted for reforms in the eu , really ? 
  you should define reforms . 
  spain has supported reforms to the migration policies and the eu parliament . 
   and , same to you . 
  you are so fucking spanish oriented and clearly , with your example about the us want us to pay for you for the next 150 years . 
  spain is near the average in gdp per capita . 
  http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00114 [ spain is n't getting cohesion funds anymore . ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/what/future/eligibility/index_en.cfm ) . 
  the total amount of structural funds for spain in the period 2014-2020 is going to be 25 billions , compared to 29 billions for italy , 19 for germany , 72 for poland . 
  btw , italy was the second biggest net contributor two budgets ago and now they are going to be a net retriever . 
  the transfers are n't permanent a country can fall . 
  and spain is going from 500 euros to 40 euros per capita . 
  yeah , spain is n't doing reforms : but the number of people working in the primary sector is the 20 % of the ones that we have when we joined the eu . 
  the energy sector has been privatized , the labour market has been liberalized , collective agreements scrapped , pension system changed , public financial sector privatized ... edit : sweden is getting more structural funds than netherlands with less population and the same gdp per capita , but you know the rules favour rural areas . 
   good then . 
  we let our shipping industry die out in the 70 's , why should we then sponsor yours ? 
  you are n't doing it . 
  that was done by the spanish government with a weird system of tax credits and discounts . 
   it needs to be cut more . 
   you have been told since the 90 's to cut down your fleet , and there was plenty of alternatives then . 
  spain has been reducing the size of the fleet since the 90s , a 45 % . 
  did you read my comment ? 
   you are not concerned about the environment , working industry , cutting down on subsidies etc ? 
  i guess not , you only want money from us and here we are with the personal attacks . 
   in fact , spain has been on the receiving end of eu money since 1986 . 
  27 years !, 
  empires have been built and lost in shorter time than that . 
  when will it stop ? 
  are my grandchildren going to pay for people in spain ? 
  spain is n't getting cohesion funds anymore , only structural funds . 
  spain is going to be a net retriever for like 50 euros per capita . 
  and in the us the south has been a net retriever since the end of the civil war . 
   i do n't want to be in the eu because it is apparent to me that the south do not want change , and they vastly outnumber us . 
  it is evident with the cap - had the south wanted change they would have reformed , and voted for it . 
  they have n't , ever . 
  ok , you are against the eu that 's something . 
  but half of the things that you are saying are n't true . 
  i do n't know why i am discussing with you . 
   how in god 's name can they subsidies coal ? 
  that is so stupid . 
  i am angry that i am paying money to people who think like that . 
  the riots are grand though . 
  the coal miners won a strike to the dictatorship in 1962 with riots way worse than those . 
  [ link ] ( http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/spanish-coal-miners-challenge-franco-dictatorship-1962 ) . 
  the coal miners also started a [ rebellion/strike against the republic in 1934 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asturian_miners%27_strike_of_1934 ) that ended with 2000 dead . 
  they have been extremely feared . 
  they have access to explosives and they do n't doubt about using them in their strikes . 
  the non-profitable mines were being closed slowly the last 30 years with reconversion plans and sending to retirement people . 
  however the reconversion plans are bullshit the companies that opened in the mining areas closed the next day after the subsidies ended and moved to other places . 
  actually every form of energy is subsidized except hydroelectric power . 
  and domestic solar energy that is losing all the subsidies and getting taxes . 
  it 's kinda funny they said that the privatization and liberalization would improve the situation , but before we had a simple and not very efficient system but it was cheaper and required less public money . 
   why ? 
  what is wrong with ship building ? 
  is that also a subsidiesed industry ? 
  yes . 
  and it 's concentrated in cadiz ( that already has a 40 % unemployment ) and galicia ( kinda ok only 25 % ) . 
  [ it 's from this july ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23344489 ) . 
  the eu responsable of competence ( joaquin almunia ) that decided the punishment is spaniard . 
  we are talking about paying back near 3 billions in subsidies , there is no way that they are going to be able to pay back . 
  the government is trying to keep them alive until the eu parliament elections but i do n't think that they are going to survive to this . 
  maybe some of them will be bought by some investors , but i doubt it . 
   cutting down the fishing fleet . 
  i mean , spain have been hearing about that since the 90 's at least . 
  spain cut the fishing fleet . 
  if makes you feel better the biggest company in the sector is in bankruptcy because the managment ~ ~ robbed the company ~ ~ [ committed some irregularities ] ( http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/2013/4/15/pescanova_spanish_fishing_colossus_files_for.htm ) the reconversion has been done slowly because the lack of alternatives in the area . 
  you can guess where are based the fishermen that are affected the pending reconversion , cadiz and galicia like the shipbuilding . 
  i think that you are missing the political factor . 
  the fleet size has went down the last 18 years [ from 18,478 ships to 10,116 ] ( http://www.farodevigo.es/mar/2013/11/12/flota-pesquera-espanola-redujo-mitad/912744.html ) . 
  recently have been anounced protest against the * reconversion , * and asking for rollback it and increasing the size of the fleet again to create jobs . 
  i do n't think that sending the people to unemployment more quickly would have been politically viable . 
  ; and the current pm is from galicia that 's one of the strongholds of the conservatives . 
   pac spanish for cap . 
  \u00ac \u00ac  why do we have to do that ? 
  how can anyone really defend half of the obviously idiotic things going on ? 
  we do n't have the interests and concerns . 
  and you are missing the political context . 
  the current situation is already very difficult .
