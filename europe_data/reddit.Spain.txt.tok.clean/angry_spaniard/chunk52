  do you think that would be possible to put more pressure in the sector in spain ? 
  the situation is getting weird . 
  if you thouch the cap what do you have to offer to the people that is living of the cap . 
   i mean , the eu is talking about taking over the energy policy . 
  something we are good at , and have low costs , comparatively . 
  of course that will not matter to the eu , our costs will rise while we sponsor fucking coal in poland or something similar . 
  actually spain is being forced to stop the subsidies to national coal before 2018 , the project was approved in 2012 . 
  you should see some of the riots that happened . 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1xqslcabys at some point the coal miners cut almost all the connections between galicia and the rest of spain . 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pdcwzuszek we are also shutting down part of the shipbuilding . 
  there is a limit over the pressure that you can put at the same time . 
  a reform of the ~ ~ pac ~ ~ cap is being negotiatied , but it 's for 2015 at least . 
  and it is n't probably what do you want . 
  edit : typos, 
  i was talking about that ~ ~ stupid ~ ~ idea that has been around some time . 
  the internal devaluation : a sharp lowering of salaries , lower job security , and high rises in vat and income taxes to decrease the labour cost and demand generating also deflation making the countries more attractive to international companies . 
  having a deflationary spiral and having more countries same currency should increase increase the competitiviness against those countries ; because the decreasing nominal costs . 
  actually , i was thinking something similar . 
  they have farming , shipbuilding , tourism , and some metalurgic industry and that 's it . 
  but , it 's not so bad and maybe a devaluation can help them to increase their competitiviness . 
  you could check the [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:greece_export_treemap.jpg ), 
  it 's not clear what 's going to include : http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/1991782/0/consejo-ministros/polemica-ley/seguridad-ciudadana/ but , there is a lot of represive stuff . 
  the left are the more euro-sceptic in many countries . 
  the spanish united left ( that is the party with the highest infighting ) is having a long term internal crisis between the current leader who is pro-euro and the more respected former leader ( julio anguita ) and the current economy speaker ( alberto garz\u00f3n ) that are against the euro . 
  and the greens and the left opposed to the eu membership in sweden . 
  after all the right wing policies that the eu has forced into spain in the last years supportting the eu is getting hard for the left . 
   any news on that , to your knowledge ? 
  yes , the government and its media have been saying that a lot . 
  it does n't feel like a recovery exactly . 
  i did n't talk about last month unemployment figures because i did n't find good sources in english . 
  * the spanish social security lost 66,829 members in november . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.expansion.com/2013/12/03/economia/1386057898.html ) * however , the registered unemployment has fallen for first time in november since 1996 , 2 476 persons . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/economia/2013/12/03/529d8d6b0ab740d2318b4571.html ) however , the reason for the fall in unemployment does n't seem to be related with a recovery , it seems more related with the following factors : * just 60 % of the unemployed are paid unemployment benefits or subsidies . 
  * the emigration is in record figures . 
  this year we are going to be the eu country with the biggest emigration around 240,000 persons ( take that romania ) . 
  * the people do n't see the point in registering in the public unemployment . 
  the normalized eu figures are around 6 millions , but the public unemployment services have registered 5 millions of jobless . 
  * people delaying their incorporation to the labour market with more education . 
  it seem that we are starting an age of stagnation and/or slow growth . 
  a government agency has made two forecast : * we will lose 2.5 millions of inhabitants due to emigration . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/np813_en.pdf ) * we will create 1.7 millions of jobs in the next 20 years ( this is older and it will be changed soon , because the emigration is being higher than expected [ link ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vkt6w5i.png ) the situation is n't as bad as greece , but it 's still bad . 
  i discovered it when i saw that the new guy uses articles . 
  what about the homosexual marriage in germany ? 
  ** spain ** mostly business as usual : corruption , authoritarianism , generalisimo franco is still dead but his torturers are alive .

  * it 's a nice way of saying that those bankers are n't going to jail anyway even with the new laws . 
  * -- business as usual : * the civil guard * association * ( they are militar and they ca n't form unions ) , has racked up 35 sanctions for serious offenses in two years under the popular party ( pp ) and 20 in two years under the socialists . 
  a significant portion was handed out to union representatives .

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladivostok#demographics  the population of the city , according to the 2010 census , is 592,034 , [ 3 ] down from 594,701 recorded in the 2002 census .

  [ 16 ] ethnic russians and ukrainians make up the majority of the population . 
  and the unicorns will pay the basic income . 
  switzerland can afford basic income if it wants but not many other countries can . 
  you have done that actually in javea ( spain ) and some other areas with significant english expat population . 
  the bloody english immigrants do n't want to integrate or learn the local language . 
  edit : your press does n't seem very interested , but it has talked about it . 
  [ link ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6647443.stm ), 
  artur mas  ciutadans politician albert rivera brandished the report in the catalan parliament on wednesday , demanding an explanation from mas . 
  the regional leader replied saying he had no knowledge of the document , and that the government had not commissioned any such project . 
  no , it 's a joke . 
  i am * translating * what i understood from their declarations . 
  i did n't know that i was setting up a secret service !, 
  this again ? 
  anything new ? 
  i would be happy if we get rid of madrid and maybe valladolid . 
  the rest of the country is cool . 
  less than 5 % of the valencian people wants to be independent . 
  the only parts of spain that have serious proindependence movements are basque country and catalonia in valencia the anti-catalanism is stronger . 
  you need to understand that spain like uk is a country built putting different historical countries together around one of them ( castilla/england ) : - galicia : our celtic region . 
  it has its own latin language very similar to portugese ( or the same language ) . 
  - asturias : sort of transition between galicia and castilla , the only region that was n't part of al-andalus never . 
  they have their own dying language . 
  - basque country : barely romanized , never completely conquered until castilla conquered them . 
  they have their own pre-indoeuropean language . 
  - navarra : was the core of the former basque independent state and was conquered by castilla later than the basque country in the xvi century . 
  they kept some self-government always even during the dictatorship , but the basque language is almost dead here . 
  it is/was considered part of the basque country . 
  - leon : south of asturias conquered by castilla and shares a regional government with part of castilla nowadays . 
  it was sparsely populated after the muslim and asturian conquests and was colonized by asturians and some people still speak a variation of the language . 
  sometimes are considered part of castilla nowadays - catalonia : no comments needed . 
  - balearic islands : the insular catalonian culture still alive but weak , but no serious interest in independence . 
  - valencia : i would say that the spanish nationalism is stronger - aragon : with three catalonian speaking kindom formed the crown of aragon . 
  the had their own language , it still has like 40,000 speakers . 
  - andalusia : it was the core of the muslim kingdom . 
  it does n't have its own language .
