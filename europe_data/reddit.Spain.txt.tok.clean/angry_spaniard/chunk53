  sometimes considered part of castilla . 
  they have a strong regional identity . 
  - canary islands : former berberic islands . 
  other than the [ silvo gomero ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silbo_gomero_language ) everything is dead . 
  but there is a nationalist government . 
  edit : i hate when some people say that our countries are homogeneus and that the eu is too diverse to work , many eu states have been extremely diverse since forever . 
  there is some hostililty and butthurt between catalonia and valencia , and i say this as valencia . 
  there is an anti-catalanism politcal movement [ blaverism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blaverism ) . 
  [ pic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ltctyuy.jpg ) if catalonia becomes independent we are not going with them . 
  the extreme blaverism is sort of minoritary nowadays but it has been successful in building a valencian identity as a region of spain . 
   high youth unemployment do you that your youth unemployment is high ? 
  that 's cute . 
   a jury on thursday found the former popular party ( pp ) premier of the balearic islands , jaume matas , guilty of abusing his position to coerce a company into paying his wife a net ** 42,000 ** euros for a job she never carried out . 
   the prosecutor has asked for fine of ** 9,000 ** euros to be imposed on matas . 
  that 's harsh . 
  [ matas avoided prison recently because his conviction for other of his crimes got reduced from 6 years to one ] ( http://www.typicallyspanish.com/spain-news/mallorca/jaume_matas_has_escaped_prison.shtml ), 
   however , there is nothing wrong in discussing and negotiating possible changes to the rules if the current model is not working for some as expected . 
  what 's not working as expected ? 
  you remove restrictions to the circulation of labour and it moves where it gets higher returns . 
  the movement is slower than it could be due to cultural barriers and some small legal barriers . 
  but , i do n't understand how somebody can be surprised with the people leaving the poorest countries . .  switzerland is outside , but in fact almost inside the union but , talking about immigration you still can put restrictions to eu immigration . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss_news/limits_on_eu_immigration_seen_as_signal.html?cid=35619210 ), 
  we can use the same argument to impose customs to imports , to restrict international takeovers of companies . 
  if this union is more than a glorified customs union we should have free circulation of labour . 
  your country is n't in the union this is n't your problem . 
  would you restrict internal migrations within switzerland ? 
  we have a big problem with this , because some countries like uk seem to want that , but they want to stay in the eu . 
  do you think that is likely that such legislation is enacted ? 
  we have been seriously fucked by the financal sector and we are n't doing anything to protect us ? 
  it 's at least an offence and if we re talking about billions and damaging the lifes of millions . 
  if this is n't a crime it should be . 
  just remembering that spain is officially the country with the biggest roma population no romania . 
  do you think that the passport should include racial profiling ? 
  how many people is going to jail ? 
  the first modern welfare was established by a [ conservative politician ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otto_von_bismarck#welfare_state ) . 
   healthcare , unemployment insurence , retirement funds , etc are all early socialist ideas , and not even the most conservative in europe two points : * socialism is/was about socialization of production means that does n't implicate a welfare state or the other way around . 
  * spain is probably special , but here the more hardcore conservatives ( dictatorship nostalgic level ) support the welfare state , the ones that declare themselves liberals are the ones that oppose . 
  you know : * the people should have the right to decide if they want to have unemployment insurance , healthcare and a retirement pension * . 
  it 's not going to happen , the * liberals * are probably the most weaker faction of the spanish pp , but they exist . 
  * austerity * i am not sure if it 's a good idea use austerity as euphemism of corruption and authoritarianism . 
  it 's bad enough that some governments do it . 
  whatever languages evolves . 
   the next parliament wo n't be legally bound , but could be politically bound . 
  are labour really going to campaign on the basis that they 'll scrap the referendum ? 
  my pm campaigned [ promising lower taxes ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7li2frz.jpg ) . 
  promises exist to be broken . 
  ( impuestos means taxes ), 
   that kind of socialism mixed with a free market economy ( aka capitalism ) has been the ideological basis for european governments for the past 50 + years . 
  nothing `` recent '' . 
  european governments ? 
  or only in certain parts of europe actually ? 
  and [ the statue in his honor ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/19/world/europe/in-spain-a-symbol-of-ruin-at-an-airport-to-nowhere.html?_r=0 ) that he ordered as head also as head of the company that runs the airport . 
  and giving more context to this guy . 
  * [ his daugther ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andrea_fabra_fern%c3%a1ndez ) is mp of the spanish parliament . 
  * his father ( carlos fabra andr\u00e9s ) was the general secretary of the party during dictatorship , mayor of castellon , and president of the province during the dictatorship . 
  it 's hard to find information about him in internet nowadays i found this [ nostalgic document ] ( http://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/noticias/sociedad/memoria-carlos-fabra-andres_96370.html ) in spanish . 
  * his grandfather was luis fabra sanz president of the province during the end of the reign of alfonso xiii , was out of politics during primo de rivera dictatorship and then mp for a conservative party during the republic . 
  other members of the family that have ruled the province are : victorino fabra adelantado , victorino fabra gil and hip\u00f3lito fabra adelantado ... 
  this family has been the ruling the province somehow ( directly or with puppets ) since the first bourbon restoration in 1874 , except between 1923-1939 . 
  he is the first member of the family that has been convicted . 
  this is historical even if it 's only 4 years . 
  i am answering , because i ca n't talk about that with second hand only knowledge : my mother is a school teacher . 
  she has lost around 20 % of her salary . 
  but , the cuts have been higher for the employees with higher seniority because the pay rises for every triennium and six year term ( if the teacher assist to 100 hours of refresher courses in the period ) . 
  for a fresh teacher the cut was around 7 % . 
  [ the number of educators in the non-university education has been reduced 4.57 % . ] ( http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2013/07/09/actualidad/1373381005_487076.html ) ( spanish . 
  but there is google translate ) . 
  but , it 's due to retirements not being replaced and temporary public servants not getting new contracts ) ; the permanent public servants ( funcionarios ) ca n't be fired without going to court . 
  if she was permanent she would be ok . 
  what do you expect of country ruled by a party founded by a dictatorship 's minister ? 
  that 's what the government says . 
  actually the economy seems to stagnate at this point . 
  it 's bad , not greece bad . 
  and it 's not getting worse in the short term . 
  but the real structural issues of spain are n't fixed . 
  what 's going on ? 
  * [ spain is losing population due to emigration . 
  ] ( http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/np813_en.pdf ) * [ active population ] ( http://www.ine.es/prensa/epa_tabla.htm ) * we cut or education and r&d budget . 
  * the government has taken over the regulators . 
  * the energy costs are destroying the industry . 
  * the population is aging and the youth is emigrating . 
  * there are more empty homes than five years ago . 
  * there are still more layoffs than hiring in qualified jobs and most of the new jobs are day unskilled day laborers positios ... * the new economic model is cheap labour in tourism and low value added industry . 
  pb can not into links from other subreditts . 
  the warships : * principe de asturias : aircraft carrier ( commissioned in 1988 ) . 
  it 's not like the americans : its weight is 15,912 tons , 16,700 tons loaded , * p-27 \u00cdzaro : patrol boat ( 1980 ) * p-61 chilreu : patrol boat ( 1988 ) * f-32 diana : corvette ( 1976 ) * l-42 pizarro : tank-landing ship ( 1970 us navy , 1995 spain ), 
  as you can see in my link . 
  spain has both types of immigration and romanian roma . 
  now , that we were getting along with the local roma . 
  but , we will reject kosovo and catalonia still . 
  the world has seen already massive levels of [ romanian immigration ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_diaspora ) . 
  they do n't seem extremely interested in uk . 
  they have gone to latin countries and germany mostly . 
  some countries are becoming more authoritarian ; at least greece , hungary and spain . 
  and uk is behaving weirdly and talking about leaving the echr . 
  even if / u/johnnytest316 is exaggerating it 's a trend that should concern us . 
  corruption and economy . 
  even if the government is trying everything else : immigration , gibraltar , getting olympic games , promoting the territorial organization debate , talking about reforming the abortion law since a year ago ... 
  we are doing the same with kosovo . 
  good luck with signature of an association agreement .
