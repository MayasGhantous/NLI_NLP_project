  we do n't even recognize kosovo . 
  greece , romania , slovakia and cyprus are with us in this . 
  [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_kosovo_to_the_european_union ) i think that our official position is that we will recognize kosovo when serbia does it . 
  the public tv has been losing money since the conservatives took over the regional government twenty years ago . 
  i am saying losing almost literally . 
  the public tv was supposed to operate at a lost that is covered by the contract that it has with the government for the public service programming . 
  but the tv accumulated a debt of 1.3 billion euros . 
  also the number of employees went from 600 to 1,800 . 
  they hired hundreds of party members to handle the public service programming whereas the normal employees worked in entertainment . 
  they tried to fire 1,300 employees recently but the justice stopped them because there were irregularities in the procedure . 
  this is not over . 
  there are plans for create a new public tv that will be outsourced to a company owned by some cronies , who will be able to hire without restriction more party members without even the requirements of a public company , with all the expenses covered by the government and saying whatever the government wants if no the employees can be fired without almost restrictions or the contract broken . 
  however , they need authorization of the central government for doing that . 
  they asked for two bailouts already to the spanish government . 
  and even their party colleagues are getting tired of the extremely corrupt and incompetent valencian government . 
  let 's see how it goes . 
   the north is recovering and the south 's nose-dive has levelled out to an extent . 
  that 's true . 
  but i am not sure that stagnate in the current situation is going to be stable . 
   hopefully as the north continues to improve that will have a cumulative effect on countries like spain and italy . 
  yep , emigration to the north . 
  at least that 's what my government 's [ forecast says ] ( http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/np813_en.pdf ) . 
  most emigrants would be young people ; and that will make the natural change negative earlier that it was expected . 
  spain is expected to lose 2.5 million inhabitants due to emigration and 100,000 due to natural chage . 
  and that 's my government that always looks to bright side . 
  they expect also the economy to grow around 1 % per year . 
  this will make the pension system collapse even with the two last reforms or send most of retires below the poverty threshold . 
  portugal is in a similar situation , but even worse . 
  italy is a very special case . 
  the north figures indicate that it would be ok alone , but the south is worse than portugal and almost greece . 
  i do n't know how a country can make that work . 
  at least part of the country is going ok . 
  i am not sure if the eu should look for expansion . 
  it seems like isnot going to be able even of keeping the current members inside and stable . 
   it 's been a very expensive few years for us all . 
  you talk like it 's over .

  the name says where you should look for it in a map at least . 
   this is such a steal . 
  yes , i am sure that if we wait we can get an apartment for less than 1,000 . 
  you could say the same about the immigrants that go to a country for a work and not for retirement , but here we are talking again about restricting free circulation of labour in the eu . 
  i do n't think that the eu is going to survive to the next ten years in its current form . 
  probably that 's the best . 
  china has a capitalist economy , your country could move back to a socialist economy also ; but it seems equally unlikely . 
  what 's that ? 
   yeah , the largest country still ruled by the commies . 
  calling commies to the chinese communist party is weird . 
  they are capitalist . 
  the economic model is more similar to the one that franco and mussolini promoted than the urss system . 
  benidorm and alfas del pi ( another big expat concentration ) are in the povince of alicante . 
  not that you should know all the medium size cities of spain . 
  i do n't know the populations of the veneto except verona and venecia . 
  it depends . 
  there is some cheap opportunities with 70 % discounts ( over the bubble prices ) , but some people keeps trying to sell for near historical maximums . 
  the other day i read [ an article ] ( http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2013/11/25/vivienda/1385412341_114123.html ) ( spanish ) gave a good example of the first . 
  [ barreiros ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:lugo-loc.svg ) , is a small coastal galician town with 3,000 inhabitants ... and 3,500 homes . 
  they are trying to sell two rooms apartments for 36,000 euros and nobody is buying . 
  however , good luck trying to find discounts like that in san sebastian or marbella . 
  i am not sure when the prices are going to bottom out . 
  the number of empty houses has increased the last 5 years in half million instead of decreased . 
  there are still around 2 millions of homes on sale/or for renting like in the end 2008 . 
  however in the more attractive locations for expats like marbella the market is still alive and there is even some new constructions . 
  doing estimates of the spanish housing market is difficult due to the size of its illegal components ( one million of illegal homes , many of them used as first residences , many people rents illegally , in real estate operations is common to pay an undeclared amount of money under table in cash ... ) edit : some extreme and more real examples in my city ( valencia 800,000 inhabitants urban area , 1,500,000 the metropolitan area ) : * center of the city . 
  most expensive area , 277 m ^ 2 : 1,350,000 euros . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.idealista.com/inmueble/613734/ ) * not very bad neighbourhood ( only bad , but no [ la coma ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg3euhyknoe ) bad ) , near the metro , and universities 50 square meters , without elevetor , first floor 30,000 euros . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.idealista.com/inmueble/25720133/ ) * near the city of arts and science , the river park and comertical centers , and universities : 92m ^ 2 242,000 euros [ link ] ( http://www.idealista.com/inmueble/26319904/ ) * near the football stadium and the universities . 
  101 m ^ 2 120,000 euros .

  do you need more ? 
  norway is 5 million inhabitants country and your second city seems to be very small . 
  as a citizen [ of the eu country with more highways ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_road_network_size ) ( sort by major highways ) i have to prevent you against the * need * of having highways . 
  they are expensive to build and expensive to maintain . 
   cheap . 
  interesting definition of cheap . 
  it 's like between 20 % and 40 % cheaper than 5 years ago but it still feels overpriced . 
  what do you think ? 
  [ spain does n't recognize kosovo independence either ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:countriesrecognizingkosovo.png ) . 
  source ? 
  the data that the [ spanish government has ] ( http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/np788_en.pdf ) says that 319,163 brits live in spain . 
  this means with registered residence in spain and paying income taxes in spain and being able to vote and being elected in local elections .
