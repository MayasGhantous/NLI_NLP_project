  do you have information of unregistered immigrants ? 
  do n't forget alicante . 
  why ? 
  yeah , uk should close its borders to immigration of poorer european countries like portugal . 
   romania had better wake up to the problems it faces , and stop blaming others for at least pointing out an unsustainable trend . 
  the solution to low wages in romania is not for the whole country to move elsewhere . 
  any idea ? 
  can they still live there ? 
  that makes even less sense . 
  if you are having former criminals living in your society you should work as hard as possible in their integration . 
  if he keeps his media he keeps part of his power . 
  he got most his empire committing irregularities even if most of his crimes prescribed or are self-amnestied . 
  he deserves to pay for that also . 
  his empire was built with crime and should n't survive . 
  if he keeps the damn media can do a lot of damage to italy and europe . 
  we need a way of removing his power over the media . 
  kill him with fire now that he is weak . 
  and throw his ashes to the sea . 
  taking over his tv channels an media . 
  including telecinco ( spain ) , please . 
  luckily the guy died of a stroke . 
   i belive it has more to do with the general climate and trust in the politicians than in minority/majority government . 
  sure , sometimes governments fail , everywhere . 
  but more often they work out , and my guess it that a functioning minority government in germany or sweden might be better than a majority government in greece , or spain , simply due to the trust one has in the government , the level of corruption etc. 
  i do n't like majority governments of a single party . 
  a government with absolute majority can do whatever it want without public debate like an emergency royal decree to take over the public tv that is ratified by the congress after a two hours debate , energy sector reforms to favour the cronies , labour market reform , allow to public companies to be more secretive , tax hikes ... 
  i think that the only one normal was the one for approving an emergency program due to an earthquake in lorca . 
  i actually prefer that a parliament where there are multiple groups and every law has to be debated in public . 
  giving all the powers to a single party is risky . 
   however , everywher , one need a good and working opposition . 
  according to my spanish friend it was far to long since spain had that . 
  yes at least the big parties , the previous socialist pm did ok in opposition between 2001 and 2004 , i think it was the last one ( it 's a sad thing that he was a bad pm ) . 
  the current pm ( conservative ) went to the sure path of only criticize without doing proposal and wait for an economic crisis . 
  and going to elections promising [ more employment and lower taxes ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7li2frz.jpg ) . 
  and of course , he raised taxes in an [ emergency decree in his first day as pm ] ( http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-30/rajoy-to-raise-taxes-cut-spending-as-deficit-exceeds-target.html ) . 
  i am not sure what are doing the socialists now i do n't hear them criticize the government . 
  each other a lot of course . 
  the ( not actually ) united left , the populist * centre-right * ( created by a member of the socialist workers party that lost the elections to leadership of the party ) and the nationalist are doing some opposition but i have some problem taking them as serious options for ruling the country . 
  supporting your point , we have a government with an absolute majority and spain seems to be falling apart . 
  maybe literally ( see catalonia ) . 
  the uk needs to decide if they want to be in this union or even the eea . 
  seriously , free movement of labour and products are two basic requirements of the union . 
  if you do n't like that you do n't have an obligation of being in the union . 
  you can leave and stop this constant fight . 
  edit : and if i trust [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/1rk8w5/david_cameron_wants_to_place_restrictions_on/ ) the proposal only removes benefits from empoyed immigrants , the restrictions for jobless we 're already in place . 
  [ el baile del pa\u00f1uelo ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szml00ybwg4 ) or any of the great hits of leonardo dantes . 
  but !, 
  you love to mumble against your government and your weather !, 
  ... ^ for ^ the ^ reptilians !, 
  the current president said that fabra is an example for everybody as politician and person in 2008 when he was being accused . 
  rajoy was the opposition leader in those days . 
   i would give him stipend to cover living expenses during the learning time . 
  that 's more expensive than the current way . 
  greece is n't authorized to increase its expenses in training programs . 
  and after a certain age nobody will hire you in a field where you do n't have experience even if you have recent training . 
   some job desired on market like there are vacant jobs on the greek market . 
  there is n't a skill gap . 
  nobody is interested in hiring even with the lower salaries , worker rights and almost non-existing benefits for jobless . 
   people lived for a thousands of years without social benefits . 
  and no one was committing crimes just in order to go into the jail . 
  because the jails where harsher before . 
  but commitging crimes , joining mercenary armies massive levels of emigration , constant wars were normal things back in the day . 
  the crime rates are in decreasing in most western countries . 
  honestly do you want to live in the kind of society that we had before ? 
  even if you do n't care about other people there is a reason that somebody as conservative as biskmark created a basic welfare state in germany . 
  the social peace is important and benefits everybody . 
  citation needed, 
  without a peaceful option they will be committing crimes for a living or going to jail . 
  seriously , what the fuck do you expect to happen if you eliminate all the safety nets ? 
  and greece is able to provide the same services that your country . 
  edit : seriously , it 's impossible your country would n't be able to provide the same services either with a 27 % unemployment rate . 
   and the west can join anyone and scrub european toilets . 
  that 's polan job . 
  [ a small introduction to don carlos ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/20131025/the-politician-who-reinvented-the-rules ) this is the first sentence against him , i ca n't believe it . 
  i expected that he would manage to change the judge again . 
  however , he is n't going to prison this year . 
  he is going to keep appealing until the constitutional court . 
  where is home ? 
  spain can send back to morocco the subsaharianas that we catch in melilla and ceuta ( and paying ) , but if they are in continental spain we should send them to their country . 
  we have similar figures to romania with more than twice the population . 
  the percentage is lower of course , but the absolute figures are the higher and many of the romanian emigrated illegally . 
  it has been done more recently , in the aftermath of both world wars for example . 
  if russia , ukraine and the local government agree the population ca n't do a lot except emigrate . 
  what would think russia about giving it to ukraine ? 
  and ukraine ? 
  and that being portugal a country with less than 1 % of muslims and having a fraction of the ~ ~ gitanos ~ ~ gypsies that we have in spain ( sometimes people forget that spain is the country with the biggest roma population , no romania ) . 
  ** spain ** headlines : * the government wants to restrict the right to demonstrate peacefully . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/21/spain-government-strict-anti-protest-laws ) . 
  * it 's not in the article , but one of the points of the law change is to outlaw demonstrations without previous government notification , the constitution says that you do n't need an authorization , but the way that notification is defined is similar to that . 
  * * china and spain have a conflict after an spanish court opened a case over the chinnese crimes against humanity in tibet . 
  [ link ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/11/22/inenglish/1385124002_473819.html ) . 
  * it 's funny because we also have a conflict with argentina because a court there is prosecuting crimes against humanity committed by the spanish dictatorship . 
  * * the street cleaners won the strike against madrid municipality , because of that government wants to restrict the right to strike . 
  [ link ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/11/21/inenglish/1385057654_709726.html ) . 
  * the social-democratic press support the government in this and the party is n't saying a word . 
  * * france appeals the prestige disaster ruling , letting everybody walk free , seems to be angry with spain and they say that a criminal offence against the environment can be proved . 
  [ link ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/11/24/inenglish/1385304306_323871.html ) . 
  * good luck with that the final responsible of those decisions are still in politics and one of them is the pm , however the ship did n't pass some revision that was mandatory they can try to prosecute the owners with that , but the spanish government is trying to close the case and they control the court where the appeal will happen . 
  * * shit storm in the tax service around cemex .
