  the government and ruling party are still corrupt and are becoming more authoritarian and the royal family is also corrupt and the king has health problems and is trying to improve his pr . 
  business as usual, 
  you should check south , where restaurants are cheap and dining out is common : [ waitress work 12 hours day for a 500 euros wages ] ( http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2013/08/24/empleo/1377370312_809579.html ) : that 's extreme , but in my area is like 900 euros/month for around 50 hours/week including nights and weekends . 
   they should themselves work their own systems better . 
  probably yes . 
  going to the discussion and what do you said before . 
  maybe your country does n't have these problems and unskilled labour can live with dignity . 
  however , i think that you should n't ignore the reasons that are making this request popular in certain countries or why germany people wants to have a minimum wage now and not before are not being completely addressed in this forum . 
  many european countries are having increasingly high levels of poverty ( including people working full time ) and income inequality . 
  and some people are doing some proposal like this one . 
  some people answers this with giving welfare to full time workers with very low salaries . 
  but that also distorts the markets and increases the burden in the state . 
  anyway , this is n't an easy question and we are n't going to fix the world here . 
  congratulation if your country does n't have those problems .

  melilla , that is in africa , has already a literal [ double ring of 6 meters steel fences . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/melilla_border_fence ) patrolled by militar police .

  the initial fence cost 33 millions , and it is n't the only thing . 
  some details of the total border . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/desalambre/inmigracion-inmigrantes-valla-melilla-marruecos-saltos_0_194580660.html ) the person that wants to get in melilla from from marroco should pass a perimetral road a double fence with barbed wire , a two meters deep trench and four width and a security track full of militar police and lookouts , before getting to the fence . 
  that 's not stopping the assaults anymore . 
  [ the government has decided to fill the fences with blades ] ( http://eng.babelmed.net/cultura-e-societa/112-spagna/13166-new-blades-to-stop-migrants-in-melilla.html ) after a group of two hundred immigrants managed to successfully cross the fence .

  yes , however i do n't see why would be that liberal even in american politics . 
  and i am from a country where half of the political spectrum thinks that we should change the flag and anthem , and even more if we include the far right that wants the dictatorship flag back . 
  you see a lot of spanish flags in left demonstrations , only non-official flags . 
   either way , if it 's done deliberately , which is interesting point of view , then it 's unlawful and should be investigated ( as it is ) by ec . 
  i do n't know if the ecb is doing it deliberately this . 
  but spain is trying to do an * internal devaluation of prices and salaries * to compensate for the [ high inflation ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ndbnhya.png ) during the bubble . 
  i think that it would be a good idea . 
  those were n't students positions always , back in the day a person expected to live from those kind of jobs . 
  it 's only corruption and authoritarianism .

  the president was suspect of corruption since 2009 before winning the 2011 elections and the royal family since 2010 . 
  what corruption scandal got to your country ? 
  * the illegal financing of the pp ( conservative ruling party ) * the appointment of members of the party to the board of private energy supply companies in preparation of a legislation to restrict the self-generation * king 's daughter and her husband running a foundation to laundry money for themselves and for two public administrations ( also conservative ) valencia and balearic islands ; also tax fraud , counterfeit of official documents and some extra minor stuff . 
  * regional saving banks sold illegally preferential shares to illiterate people , at least there were socialist also involved ( hurrah ! ), 
  * illegal constructions everywhere .

  * the connections with the ** drug dealing ** of the galician regional president . 
  [ link ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/03/31/inenglish/1364758860_166213.html ) . 
  when the meetings happened the president was working in the department that controlled the drug supply of the galician hospitals . 
  i think that i can stop with that one , that was amazing . 
  and we did n't hear anything about it again and the guy is still in office . 
  it 's a trap !, 
  run away !, 
  it 's too late for us , but no for you !, 
   to be fair , it 's the same in almost every eu country that some regions are stronger than others . 
  some countries are better well-adjusted than others . 
  western germany was fairly equal as you probably know . 
  italy is even worse than spain . 
  northern italy has a gdp similar to to the rich southern germany . 
  but southern italy has a worse economy than andalusia and canary islands  you should n't compare regions to whole countries . 
  catalonia can be a whole country . 
  and one of their arguments to be accepted in the eu by default is that they would be a net contributor . 
   just wondering , what about the idea of a federal spain ? 
  or is this completely unrealistic ? 
  it 's unrealistic . 
  at least it does n't have almost support outside of catalonia ( oh , the irony ) . 
  for giving some context spain is a * regional * state that consist a bunch of adhoc temporary self-government agreements created during the transition to democracy . 
  about the territorial organization the constitution says that regional governments can be created that handle stuff decided by the central government with a home rule basic law approved by the spanish parliament . 
  that does n't mean that the self-government has to be small : catalonia manages public schools , hospitals , universities , a regional police , barcelona metropolitan transport , roads inside catalonia ... 
  this adhoc model generates a lot of tensions and differences between regions . 
  basque country and navarra have fiscal sovereignty and they do n't need to contribute to the development funds to poor regions but nobody else has that right . 
  catalonia , basque country and navarre have their own police forces while the rest of spain the police is handled by the central government . 
  this model is becoming very unpopular ( outside basque country and navarre ) . 
  but not in a federal direction . 
  [ the last official poll about that ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/05/03/actualidad/1367606811_475357.html ) ( spanish ) . 
  headlines : * 60 % of the spaniards want a new territorial organization * 65 % of the catalans wants a federal state ( 27.6 % ) or the independence ( 37.4 % ) . 
  * 37 % of the spaniards wants to reduce the power of the regional institutions .
