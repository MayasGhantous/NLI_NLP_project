  * 23 % of the spaniards wants to eliminate the regional institutions and have an unitary state like france . 
  this 23 % is included in the previous 37 % * 13.2 % of the spaniards wants a federal state or more self-government . 
  * 9.7 % of the spaniards wants the self-determination for their * region . 
  * creating a federal state with these polls would be politically impossible , honestly . 
  the funds allocation makes me think one thing : italy is falling very hardly . 
  they got more regional/cohesion development funds than spain for first time ever . 
  and they got less cap funds . 
  spain has now the second biggest farming sector . 
  that 's logical . 
  italy has been losing their primary sector the last years . 
  italy has become net importer of olive oil and the italians brands are selling spanish oil as italian . 
  that was in the [ british press ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/8978053/four-out-of-five-bottles-of-italian-olive-oil-debased.html ) , that seems to think that the italian oil is better . 
   italy was importing more olive oil than it was exporting -- 470,000 tonnes against 250,000 tonnes -- seriously , i love to bitch about my country ( spain ) as much as the british about the french but i am starting to think that we should be more concerned about italy . 
  some day we will talk about how is possible that italy has a 12 % unemployment rate with a similar employment rate as spain . 
  italy had a bigger gdp than uk and france and italy in 1991 . 
  [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_history_of_italy#1964-1991 )  on 15 may 1991 , italy became the fourth worldwide economic power , overcoming france , called the `` secondo sorpasso '' with a gdp of us$ 1.268 trillion , compared to france 's gdp of us$ 1.209 trillion and britain 's of us$ 1.087 trillion . 
  italy has been falling hardly since berlusconi became the most powerful man in the country . 
  is too late for doing something ? 
  sorry for, 
  no , it is n't the only * murderers * than get less than 10 years are the guys that drive drunk and similar cases . 
   by a declaration of independece if pro-secession parties win those elections . 
  ciu is n't going to back that . 
  we do n't link that . 
  remove link from premises . 
  i would use google translate or chrome . 
  it 's going to be close enough . 
  it 's ok with german and french . 
   is the eu really asking for that or is it just asking for a balanced budget and your government decides to fuck the poor because that 's just easier ? 
  yes , the eu asked for another raise of the vat just after we raised it to 21 % and a pension reform . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.abc.es/economia/20130621/abci-ecofin-peticiones-espana-201306211335.html ) . 
  the pension reform has been done already . 
  the government is not going to raise the default vat again , but it 's preparing another surprise secret tax reform . 
  there is rumours about that it 's going to be applied to civil law notary services and some products will lose the reduced vat . 
  the eu also said that our reduced vat for health care products is illegal . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/1703474/0/tribunal-justicia-europeo/iva-reducido/condena/ ) the speaker of the catalan pro-independence cup against the eu . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20130926/54390081737/david-fernandez-independencia-fuera-esta-ue.html ) . 
  but , the point is that the eu has only enemies from the left here and their more vocal supporters are the right . 
  and the eu supports their agenda . 
  what 's socialist in cutting welfare and giving public resources to private monopolies and oligopolies ? 
  ok , maybe my government is lying about the eu supporting the private monopolies of their cronies ; but it 's constantly asking for cuts in welfare and a more regressive tax system even after two raises in vat and the legalization of some extra loopholes to help the rich to avoid paying taxes for attracting investments . 
  the eu in spain is more supported by right wing groups that see it as a tool for pushing their agenda of privatizations , corruption and welfare cuts . 
  edit : * the former leader of the united left ( julio anguita ) said that spain should leave the euro . 
  paywall :(, 
   did the same elsewhere , then the issues that ordinary people are most concerned about may actually be addressed and listened to . 
  mostly : breaking the eu , restrict immigration and restrict islamic practice . 
  what else have in common those parties ? 
  i do n't see how that would solve the problems that my country and my people has . 
  however , the * hardcore * ultra-nationalist right wing in spain is around 20,000 votes of +30 millions . 
  what do you expect to solve with them ? 
   i do not understand reddits obsession with linking `` conservative '' and `` nationalist '' as the god damned devil . 
  reddit is way more divided than that . 
  there is a lot of people that is strongly nationalist and conservative and there are a lot of liberal people and some socialists , communists , anarchists and libertarians ... 
  there is even a strong * white nationalism * in reddit . 
  let 's stop pretending that reddit has a single opinion . 
  it is n't [ the first time ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cwiybg2.png ) . 
  maybe you are too similar . 
   do you think a situation like this could be a recipe for disaster ? 
  we do n't need an hypothetical situation for a recipe for disaster . 
  we have the current one . 
  anyway . 
  basque country , navarra ( sort of basque ) and catalonia are over the eu average . 
  they have a gdp per capita higher than finland , sweden , france or germany . 
  [ link ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/policy/regional-innovation/monitor/index.cfm?q=p.regionalprofile&amp;r=es51#economy ) the rest of spain is below the average except the capital due to efforts done by the government : massive influx of investment , high direction of the public administration and trying to convince private companies to put their headquarters there . 
  an attempt of doing something like splitting the euro would have a problem with countries like italy or spain than have some of the eurozone richest and poorer regions inside the same country . 
  * culture and language : catalan culture and language are threatened due to immigration from others parts of spain and south america . 
  the immigrants speak spanish and keep their culture and traditions . 
  the spanish language and culture are very strong . 
  the cinema is in spanish , the tv is in spanish , the books are published in spanish ... 
  there are limits to what catalan government can do to preserve language and culture inside spain . 
  recently the catalonian government made illegal bullfighting and the spanish government has answered declaring bullfighting tax breaks and government support and plans to get bullfighting in catalonia thanks to the usage of public funds . 
  the last education reform that the spanish government wants to change the immersion in catalonian that catalonia does . 
  all the mandatory public education is in catalonian . 
  * financial : catalonia is the biggest contributor to the spanish budget . 
  however the basque country is richer than catalonia . 
  but the basque country has fiscal privileges and only gives to the spanish government for the services that retrieves , catalonia pays for the services that retrieves and to a fund to help the poor regions ( andalusia and extremadura ) to have the same public services . 
  the unfairness is clear . 
  but they do n't to get help from the basques to pay the services of the poor regions , they want to stop paying them . 
  * the spanish government favours the capital too much like uk and france . 
  however the catalan government does the same with barcelona . 
  [ edit ] example : [ high-speed lines ] ( http://www.adif.es/en_us/infraestructuras/lineas_de_alta_velocidad/lineas_de_alta_velocidad.shtml ) there is no connection between barcelona and valencia ( 2nd and 3rd cities of the country ) , there is no free highway neither ( the current one is a toll road , while the highways to madrid are free ) . 
  there more minor reason like the toxic political situation that spain has , but that should n't affect this decision . 
   just because something is against the law in your country does not mean it is against the law in the country where the perp is in . 
  why would country x extradite someone for something that is no crime ? 
  would you extradite homosexuals to iran ? 
  that 's the logical next step . 
  i can see your point . 
  if we ca n't handle the situation inside our legal framework maybe we should ignore it . 
  that 's a can of worms that i would prefer to keep closed . 
  i would propose to reduce our commercial relations with societies that allow this behaviour before going to that . 
   do you think the public support in catalonia for such an uprising is enough to escalate into an armed conflict ? 
  not in the short term . 
  the [ erc ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republican_left_of_catalonia ) ( republican left of catalonia ) and the [ cup ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/popular_unity_candidates ) ( popular unity candidates ) support an unilateral declaration of independence . 
  but they do n't have the majority even if erc is leading the polls they would n't get an absolute majority . 
  and they are completely against any violence in any side the current catalan government ( minority government of ciu liberal + conservative alliance pro-self determination ) is still trying to negotiate with the spanish government indefinitely even if the spanish government has said that there is n't nothing to negotiate . 
  in conclusion , in the short term no . 
  but the spanish government is extremely short sighted and incompetent if they handle the situation as bad as possible it can happen . 
   of course , before you can jail someone , you need to be able to get them into custody . 
  which can be tricky . 
  let 's be honest that 's because they are protected by the governments . 
   unless you propose another wave of extrajudical kidnappings .
