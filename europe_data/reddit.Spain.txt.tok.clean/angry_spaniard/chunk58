  that 's a weird accusation to do against somebody angry because tha lack of law enforcement . 
  and how many people in prison ? 
  that was actually the request that the people that commit fraud and steals millions should be in prison some time . 
  and nobody in prison . 
  people should go to jail at least some months after stealing millions . 
  hey !, 
  maybe catalonia declares independence and ~ ~ castilla ~ ~ spain decides to go full serbia with them . 
   the fact that spain is about graduate their bailout program is fucking awesome and we are going to do that with a 25.8 % of unemployment and third highest poverty rate after romania and bulgaria , we still lack independent regulators , the corruption is rampant , the public education has been seriously damaged by cuts and a reform to increase the weight of the catholic church ... we are the living proof that you do n't need your problems to leave the bailout . 
  is the high speed train needed ? 
  there is a market for it . 
  we built also [ ghost high speed trains ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/8603392/spain-cuts-high-speed-ghost-train.html ) , not only airports and highway . 
  what 's the business plan ? 
  is the line expected to be profitable ? 
  i wish that more people demonstrated against infrastructure projects in spain . 
  the authors of the proposal calculated that switzerland needed to raise the vat to 20 % from 8 % for paying it . 
  it 's a lot , but my country has a 21 % and sweden a 25 % . 
  i do n't know if the current approach is a better way to provide safety nets . 
  i do n't know enough about the country . 
  from the article :  with all due disrespect to the uk independence party and germany 's anti-euro allianz f\u00fcr deutschland , it is quite wrong to tar them with the same brush as greece 's neo-fascist golden dawn , hungary 's jobbik or france 's front national . 
  that 's even more true of , say , catalan nationalists , let alone beppe grillo 's five star movement in italy -- ** which could not be farther from the far right ** . 
  did you try to read it ? 
  this is outdated , seriously outdated . 
  it talks about an 11-day strike when the strike has ended in its 13th day ( today ) . 
  and that makes sense because the article was written this friday . 
  [ there is already an agreement ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/11/17/actualidad/1384658183_644591.html ) . 
  nobody will be fired . 
  wages frozen until 2017 . 
  the initial proposal was a 27 % average lowering . 
  all the employees wo n't be working 45 days during the next 4 years when they will be collecting unemployment benefits . 
  any employee that leaves the job willingly will get 30 days of salary by year until a maximum of two years . 
  even if the spanish laws says that you do n't have to pay to who leaves willingly they actually want to get rid of workers . 
  any worker can leave the job for 5 or 10 years getting a 50 % year salary or a 75 % year salary respectively . 
  nobody will be hired for replacing retires or people that leaves the company . 
  probably nobody will be prosecuted for anything that happened during the strike . 
  ( that 's not not in the agreement but it 's expected ) . 
  btw : the usage of emergency services for the cleaning was illegal . 
  the public authorities had n't declared a health emergency ( i.e. 
  due to the risk of epidemic outbreks ) . 
  but the unions did n't follow the minimum services decree ( may be illegal also ) . 
  but nobody is going to send to court anybody . 
  edit : the emergency cleaners where a failure , they were able to clean only 60 tonnes . 
  like 2 % of the garbage that the people puts in the container in one day . 
  and that after 11 days of strike . 
  and the street cleaners handle more things that picking the garbage . 
  edit2 : the unions were very harsh with the * emergency cleaners * , ccoo ( the biggest union ) hoped that `` nobody ends injured '' when tragsa ( emergency cleaners company started cleaning madrid . 
  madrid has around 3.2 million inhabitants , generating 1.1 kg/day per capita . 
  the results were certainly disappointing for the municipality . 
  and the street cleaners do n't pick garbage only . 
  the municipality of madrid is the most in debt of europe . 
  the debt has n't been generated by very well paid and overly staffed cleaning services ; it has been genetared as usual by crazy construction projects . 
  * [ calle 30 ] ( http://www.roadtraffic-technology.com/projects/m30_madrid/ ) : remodeling of the inner ring road , larged sections of it routed undergound . 
  budget estimated : ** 3,900 million euros ** . 
  * [ new city hall ] ( http://madridiario.es/noticia/192579 ) : ** 466 million euros . 
  ** * [ caja m\u00e1gica ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caja_m%c3%a1gica ) : tennis olympic stadium ( built without government funds before getting the games , and now the government should n't pay it ) , ** $ 294 million ** * [ aquatic center ] ( http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2013/09/09/madrid/1378679598_233008.html ) : 150 millions wasted . 
  50 millions to finnish the construction . 
  and the list continues . 
  ** spain ** the most interesting is the capital garbage strike : the things got very bad . 
  the municipality violating the strike laws hiring another company to remove garbage ( actually a symbolic amount for madrid 60 tonnes ) the unions threatened with violence . 
  24 hours later ( today ) they signed an agreement this morning . 
  nobody will be fired . 
  wages frozen until 2017 . 
  the initial proposal was a 27 % average lowering . 
  all the employees wo n't be working 45 days during the next 4 years when they will be collecting unemployment benefits . 
  any employee that leaves the job willingly will get 30 days of salary by year until a maximum of two years . 
  even if the spanish laws says that you do n't have to pay to who leaves willingly they actually want to get rid of workers . 
  any worker can leave the job for 5 or 10 years getting a 50 % year salary or a 75 % year salary respectively . 
  nobody will be hired for replacing retires or people that leaves the company . 
  probably nobody will be prosecuted for anything that happened during the strike . 
  ( that 's not not in the agreement but it 's expected ) other stuff : * eu ask for more cuts , despite the last cuts in education and research . 
  [ link ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/11/15/inenglish/1384525399_918735.html ) * spain has the right to be dicks with gibraltar . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24954881 ) * nobody is guilty of all the irregularities committed handling the prestige 's oil disaster . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/13/spanish-prestige-oil-tanker-disaster ) * king 's daughter seems to be guilty of corruption and it 's goign to be prosecuted despite government appointed prosecutor opposition . 
  [ link ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/11/14/inenglish/1384447027_904015.html ) * government will apply the law with eta members and release them according to strasbourg ruling . 
  and norway , we need that damn oil money . 
   the broader issue with spain and italy is the debt and deficit in general . 
  the broader issue is that the economy is shrinking . 
  the means more people asking for charity welfare and benefits and less paying taxes . 
  we can cut more the public expenses but that also decreases the size of the economy ( rising the debt/gdp ratio ) and increases the number of jobless people ( making the deficit not going down as much as expected ) . 
  the rising income inequality is also a threat to the public finances because the rich people allocate a lower percentage to paying taxes than the middle class even lower after the last tax reforms . 
  i find more likely that they make it more difficult to protect themselves from opposition . 
   they want something different . 
  yes , but they will get the corrupt * right wing * government back . 
  and then the corrupt * left wing * government . 
  it 's how it works . 
  the government is corrupt . 
  like the previous one and the one that will come after this . 
  that 's a big burden for their society . 
  the protests want to change that with the resignation of the current government . 
  it seems naive to me . 
  i was being demagogic , i am not sure that there are better options . 
   ca n't you auction them off in this state , hoping you find someone willing to finish building it so you recuperate some losses ? 
  probably no . 
  there is a big supply of finished housing with a certificates of fitness for occupation that has n't been sold never ( around a million of homes . 
  there is also an important supply of hosuing without the certificate ( the taxes are lower , but there is n't access to the utilities ) that would get it if the owners wanted . 
  there are also around 100.000 houses from mortgage evictions ; apartaments for rent empty during months ... 
  the economy and demographics of spain are fucked . 
  the number of households is n't going to grow . 
  spain will be an emitter of emigration . 
  the fertility rate has been below 2.0 the las 25 years . 
  the youth is going to have more difficult than never to move out of their parents home with higher unemployment and precarious contracts ; the average age that the people moves out is going to keep rising .
