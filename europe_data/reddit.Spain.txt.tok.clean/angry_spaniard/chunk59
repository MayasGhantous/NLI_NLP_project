  spain is n't going use the current supply with a shrinking and poorer population . 
  adding more does n't make sense . 
  honestly demolishing them does n't seem a bad idea . 
  we are n't going to allow nobody to live there even if they are finished . 
  having homes without people and people without homes is silly . 
  let 's destroy the homes !, 
  you should n't start a war with them that you ca n't end without fighting a winter inside their country . 
  they started with a bid for the 2012 games . 
  they lost and started with the construction projects anyway . 
  that only explains 2 billions of the [ 6.2 that they owe ] ( http://www.eleconomista.es/economia/noticias/5288174/11/13/la-deuda-del-ayuntamiento-de-madrid-se-situara-en-6204-millones-en-2014.html ) . 
  the other ones are due to the new city hall ( 500 millions ) and construction jobs like the m-30 improvements ( [ calle 30 ] ( http://www.roadtraffic-technology.com/projects/m30_madrid/ ) ) with an estimated cost of 3.9 billions . 
  in this case : madrid spent all the municipal budget in building stuff related with the olympic games . 
  they lost the bid an had to ask [ for a bailout of 350 millions of euros ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cadenaser.com%2fespana%2farticulo%2fhabra-segundo-rescate-finanzas-ayuntamiento-madrid%2fcsrcsrpor%2f20130729csrcsrnac_21%2ftes ) to pay wages . 
  madrid is broken and it 's the municipality with the highest debt in all europe . 
  they have to cut expenses and this is the biggest one besides the irregular and corrupt construction of unneeded stuff . 
  business as usual . 
  the prosecutor is under the control of the general prosecutor who is appointed by the government . 
  he has been trying to protect cristina in any possible way . 
  despite evidence . 
  yes , spain does n't actually qualify for a depression . 
  spain has lost 5.9 % of gdp only and had one trimester of growth in 2010 and another one in 2011 . 
   spain might well be cheaper but demand is going even lower . 
  spanish demand is a small part of eu demand . 
   it is pointless setting up a business where nobody can afford your products . 
  tell that to all the companies making clothes to the western in bangladesh . 
  we are in a global market . 
   the business case for any industry that trades regionally is if the potential demand value is greater than manpower costs + resource costs . 
  yes , this is destroying jobs in other sectors . 
  that 's known . 
   any non-regional industry is going to care about where its partners are . 
  this usually is the richer nations to begin with . 
  maybe their partners will move also to a cheaper country for saving costs . 
  in addition , spain is n't exactly a poor country . 
  do n't be tricked by the low salaries and the high rate of people living below the poverty threshold ( third higher in the eu after romania and bulgaria ) the gdp per capita is similar to the italian and the [ eurozone average ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/f/f4/volume_indices_of_gdp_per_capita%2c_2012%2c_eu-27%3d100.png ) i do n't like this , but it can work . 
   this implies homophobic is a name that has an objective definition . 
  but in reality , homophobic , like racist and misogynist and all the others is a rubber insult used by liberals / leftie it has an objective definition hate or fear to homosexual people . 
  could you give an objective definition of liberals / lefties ? 
   so i say everybody who is n't a fucking liberal / leftie should either ignore these terms or take away their power by saying yes we all are racist homophobic misogynist bigots now fuck off . 
  my position is very simple is : if you support discriminate people for being homosexual you are probably homophobic . 
  could you give a non-homophobic reason to discriminate people for their homosexuality ? 
   but first we need to get rid of of words like homophobic because they are not objective terms trying to describe things the way they are but mainly ideological weapons of the lefties . 
  it 's extremely ironic that you do n't like the usage of the word homophobic because is n't objective and you keep using lefties . 
  and i do n't see why you oppose to put a common tag to the last three groups . 
  he is using the [ asturias ' flag ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asturias ) . 
   austerity is generally the government spending less i have been told that depressing the internal demand of the private sector to become a net exporter is also austerity . 
  i gave an argument against the second one . 
  and you did n't give an argument to the first one . 
  the idea is to drive in investors with deflation . 
  spain is cheaper than france and germany and will be getting cheaper . 
  that as a competitive advantage . 
  i know that my government is corrupt and shady and they can be lying or being wrong . 
  but , let 's see the gdp deflators of [ germany , france and spain ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ndbnhya.png ) . 
  spain lost a lot of competitiveness this last years . 
  the plan is recover that having an inflation 2 points lower than the euro users average . 
  if that means deflation that 's it the idea is moving to an exports based economy with cheaper salaries . 
  the internal demand is irrelevant and the more depressed the better because will increase the deflation making the country more competitive against the other euro countries . 
  it 's for emigration mostly . 
  we are the [ fastest growing immigrant group in uk ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/20130830/spaniards-fastest-growing-migrant-group-in-uk ) . 
  and not only uk , but english is useful to find a job almost everywhere . 
  you can be ok in many european countries with english only with spanish in not so many . 
  let 's hope that the internal devaluation is also in prices and not only in salaries . 
   that 's a nice castle you 've got there . 
  it sure is . 
  would n't want anything to happen to it , now would you ? 
  yes , but i am not worried it 's in a very good mountain and the access are very easy to control . 
  do you hava a place like that ? 
   also , when you mention florida without hurricanes , does that include the alligators ? 
  bitch please !, 
  [ we are spain ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rxt9q7w.jpg ) be aware of the [ surprise bulls ] ( http://youtu.be/y00qzhjcquw?t=1m53s ), 
  that 's the plan being the european version of florida , without hurricanes . 
  i do n't think that it 's going to work for all the country . 
  i do n't see british retirees moving to [ teruel ] ( http://i.imgur.com/swdvkuu.jpg ) or [ segovia ] ( http://estaticos.elmundo.es/elmundo/imagenes/2012/04/13/espana/1334335023_0.jpg ) . 
  even if it 's actually [ lovelly ] ( http://i.imgur.com/g12vqau.jpg ) ) i do n't know if the big migrations that are happening between spain and the ~ ~ perfidious albion ~ ~ uk and spain are going to increase or decrease the euroscepticism . 
  do they actually want to put more borders with a country where half million of citizens have their permanent residence ? 
  and many more live there half or the year or more . 
  -- yes , i picked the only two * cities * that have an actual winter . 
   1 . if you were a child and have a choice , who would you choose ? 
  i do n't that i would care . 
  why would i care ? 
  i find it personally very hard to understand . 
   given that there are more couples waiting for a child to adopt than children waiting to be adopted , each time a gay couple adopts , a hetero couple affected by infertility can not . 
  so you 're stopping people with a disease from being cured . 
  we allow fertile couples to adopt and single individuals . 
  forbidding to gay couples to adopt is simply bigotry and madness . 
  gay people can be homophobic . 
  [ a video ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/spain/inflation-cpi ) without that stupid music of the spanish assault to the congress in 2012 . 
  includes police aggressions in a train station after the demonstration ended . 
  and one of some aggressions to a police officer . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_drmd41-l8 ), 
  is it now a threat ? 
  spain has been trying to get deflation the last three years to increase our competitive against northen europe . 
  it will compensate for the years that we had an inflation over the eu average and we have done already the decrease of wages and the labour market reforms to promote precarious contracts . 
  if the cost of living does n't get lower with lower salaries and worse living conditions this is going to be too much . 
  but , it seems like finally the price levels are getting lower . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/spain/inflation-cpi ) edit : actually , we would be in deflation since 2012 , but spain raised the vat from 18 % to 21 % . 
  or the people from the south can emigrate to the north like we are doing . 
  destroying the eu . 
   ( for example if you 're against adoption by homosexual couples ) , you 're homophobic i have n't met anybody who opposes to that who is n't homophobic . 
   but it would be easy for other parties to make a point of this . 
  the biggest * opposition * party is also involved .
