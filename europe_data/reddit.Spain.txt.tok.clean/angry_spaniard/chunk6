  the municipal budgets spent maintaining the golf course is around 400,000 euros . 
  edit2 : ukip would love to know all this . 
  our left is already using it . 
  nop , that golf course loses money . 
  melilla is a small city ( 78,000 inhabitants ) without northern european expats , almost no tourism and the locals do n't love golf . 
  many golf courses in the mainline are profitable , but those are private . 
  i do n't know any spaniard that plays golf . 
  for me it is a thing of british expats . 
   220.000 euros anuales `` para sufragar los gastos ocasionados por el desarrollo de la actividad deportiva vinculada a la gesti\u00f3n '' del centro deportivo if it sounds as bad english is because the spanish is already broken : 220,000 euros/year `` to cover the costs incurred in the development of the sport connected to the management '' of the sport center . 
  the municipal budgets spent maintaining the golf course is around 400,000 euros . 
  edit : i do n't think that the course is making a profit . 
  however we do n't know how much the 250 members pay . 
  that was another way of calling the russian empire . 
  picture from [ this article ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/desalambre/pagado-fondos-publicos-frente-melilla_0_316369381.html ) . 
  it takes this chance to talk ill about the golf course . 
  it was built with 2 million euros of feder funds . 
  and it 's costing to the city $ 620,000 every year . 
  it has been 7 years . 
  what makes you be so optimistic ? 
  you seem to be in denial : the old corrupt elite is still in power and the people has got poorer and angrier than before the crisis than in any previous situation handled by devaluation . 
  and the new alternative elites that are growing at greece ( or spain ) is not the kind of people that the countries that are forcing the austerity want for us . 
  and because we seem unable and unwilling to leave , but i would like . 
  this guy is a really good bullshitting . 
  most of the moors were hispano-roman people who converted . 
  estonians are russians that have forgot what they are . 
   edit : i wonder if i have been voted negative because i am not funny or because the people thought that i am serious . 
  [ this guy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/n6gitch.jpg ) ( i\u00f1igo errejon ) was the director of campaign of podemos , a party that was created 4 months before the eu elections and got three mep with a total campaign cost of 150,000 euros , a 10 % of parties with less votes and decades of trajectory . 
  however , he has phd in political science and even if he looks like a kid is actually 30 years old , one of the editors of a political magazine , researcher in a university and chair of the board of lobby/left wing political foundation . 
   where can i sign up for that ? 
  which role do you want ?

  he is a young man studying in the university and without a criminal record , security had n't a reason for not letting him pass in that case . 
  the attractive of women twice the age and the weight but 1,000 times richer and well connected is known , it 's nothing strange see them with young men in social gatherings . 
  he actually did n't commit any crime for getting in the social gatherings , even if he went to some without invitation . 
  however , he used them for committing other crimes . 
   he is believed to have made over 25,000 euros by convincing some of spain 's largest enterprises -- many of which figure on the ibex 35 list -- of his powerful connections and persuading them to invest in lucrative property funds , which in practice did not exist . 
  and the justice has found another two entrepreneurs who paid him similar amounts in exchange of illegal favours ( he seemed very well connected ) . 
  he used the money for hiring a driver and bodyguard and renting a mansion . 
  he is a spaniard . 
  [ gallery of his best moments ] ( http://www.elconfidencial.com/multimedia/album/espana/2014-10-16/la-vida-vip-de-francisco-nicolas-gomez-iglesias_247677/ ) he has been with the king , with the spanish former director of the imf , the president of the business association federation , the general secretary of the ugt union , the president of madrid 's regional government ... 
  explain , please . 
  some of biggest infrastructure companies are based on spain , from the company doing the construction of the extension of the panama channel to high speed trains in saudi arabia . 
  there is also a lot of unused capacity in the construction material industry , the [ production of cement is at a 20 % of its peak at 2007 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9u64eu4.jpg ) . 
  also there is a significant number of people working in engineering services . 
  / u/lupinechemist is an american working in that at spain actually ( if i remember correctly ) . 
  edit : and even if they want to do everything at germany they would have to import the workers because germany has a 5 % of unemployment . 
   german or other eurozone countries increasing investments would start to show up at earliest few years from now . 
  actually if we want to get the investment back and make sure we have a good project selection and planning , at earliest projects will start 3-5 years from now . 
  the situation is stable anyway , the crisis will be there . 
  never !,

  shut up gypsy !, 
  our ghost airports disagree . 
  having them planting trees is more expensive that simply giving them money . 
  we need to get tools , trees , moving the people ... we can do it with some people , but not with 20 % of the workforce . 
  and then there is the question of where we put so many trees . 
  my country is not expected to improve significantly this decade . 
  automation and it at this moment is destroying ( or making possible to outsource ) mostly middle skill jobs . 
  the ford factory at almussafes ( near valencia , spain ) is building the cars that the factory was building 15 years ago , [ plus the ones at belgium ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1203wz/ford_confirms_plans_to_close_belgium_factory_us/ ) with less employees . 
  actually less cars than the two factories together at their peak , but the point is that the factory is producing more than never with less employees . 
  and the people that lost their jobs at belgium and spain were n't unskilled . 
  please , invest in eu countries run by mafias only . 
  income , vat and corporate taxes collection are n't transferred and that 's most of the tax . 
  the regional tax service has inheritances , gambling and some fees . 
  i do n't think so and rajoy is not that type of person . 
  however , it would be legal . 
  are you crazy !, 
  an this will be canceled also by the court , the spanish government would pass an emergency royal decree if it was was n't illegal already . 
  spain is n't going to move , with current and foreseeable government . 
  and the eu does n't have legal means ( or interest ) for forcing an independence recognized by spain .
