  check the list of people in the cartel 's payroll in the top comment . 
  elena salgado ( endesa ) and pedro solbes ( enel ) were the ministers of economy between 2004 and 2011 for the socialist workers party and felipe gonz\u00e1lez ( gas natural ) was the socialist pm between 1982 and 1996 . 
  they are silently supporting this also . 
  the only parties that oppose to this are too left wing to be liked here . 
  their proposal to fix the energy sector and stop the corruption es la nazionalization, 
  i would n't call them clowns . 
  they are shameless corrupts . 
  we have some ghost olympic installations in madrid costing 2 billions . 
  and madrid is in the second week of street cleaners strike , because they have to fire 20 % of the cleaning services employees . 
  and decrease their already low salaries as part of the bailout agreement . 
  [ link ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/11/11/uk-spain-rubbish-idukbre9aa0zp20131111 ), 
  we have the older brother of the previous conservative president ( jose maria aznar who is in endesa payroll ) handling that . 
  a political party is a criminal organization to drain the state . 
  ideologies are irrelevant . 
  sorry , but too many times it feels like that . 
  i can relate to the feeling when you change a corrupt government after riots and social unrest for a more openly corrupt government . 
  what to do if the leaderships of the two big political blocks are openly corrupt and most of your compatriots keep voting them ? 
  people that talk ill about the french administration have never dealt with other administrations . 
  what 's wong with the british press ? 
  why is it so obsessed with the french government size ? 
   i wish they would remove cap all together from the eu and let countries handle it themselves and overhaul the regional aid completely . 
  the french subsidies would destroy the farming in spain you do that . 
  berlusconi and his criminal corporations are from milan . 
  ** spain ** * valencia 's regional government lost control of the regional public tv . 
  [ link ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/11/07/inenglish/1383840175_309890.html ) context : 1 . 
  the regional government fired illegally 60 % of the employees . 
  the court has said recently that the lay-offs where done illegally as expected . 
  the court said that all of them keep their jobs and that should be paid for the months that were n't in the payroll . 
  the regional government then said that is going to shutdown the regional public tv . 
  workers rebellion , after years of being submissive with the conservative govenment some tv shows critize some political decision and ask for forgiveness for helping to hide the crimes of the regional government . 
  * after years of getting paid by them and no saying a shit . 
  regional government said something about giving an administrative concesion to one company to replace the public tv . 
  a company would get money from the regional government for running a regional tv mostly in catalonian for valencia . 
  the conservative members of the public tv boards stepped down and let the left wiing minority take over the tv and use the tv to fight the government openly . 
  government has approved an emergency decree to take over again the public tv soon . 
  -- * the judge orders the arrest of the ex-board members of one of valencia 's former regional saving banks [ link ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/11/07/inenglish/1383841919_748904.html ) * valencia , again . 
   the ghost airport needs more millions to open .

  [ link ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/11/07/inenglish/1383853404_175569.html ) -- i do n't have time for more * erasmus grants will be reduced starting the next course . 
  * strike of cleaning services in madrid . 
  * catalonia government does n't dare to celebrate the referendum * not so bad unemployment figures for october . 
  the property bubble started with aznar , the actual influx peak was in 2000-2007 . 
  zapatero regularized 800,000 illegal immigrants , those immigrants did n't get into spain mostly when he was president ( at least the main regularization requirement was being in the country more than a year ) . 
  if you count legal immigrants foreign residents the growth rates are similar . 
  [ the data ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/inmigraci%c3%b3n_en_espa%c3%b1a#cite_ref-pobtot_1-0 ) : aznar got the government with a 1.37 and left it with 7.02 % . 
  zapatero got 7.02 and left with 12.2 % . 
  what 's real conservative for you ? 
  the spanish conservative party was founded by a franco 's minister and the biggest influx of immigrants of the spanish history happened under their first government . 
  and they are a very traditional right wing for spanish standards : they give a lot of money to the catholic church , support with public money the bullfighting , are monarchist , are authoritarian , have been key in building [ the biggest police forces of the eu ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qlcbzxx.png ) , are socially paternalist . 
  our conservatives are what they have been always . 
  franco bodyguards were moors until 1958 . 
  [ picture ] ( http://media.guregipuzkoa.net/photo/1024715/1024715_o.jpg ) [ san sebastian in 1939 ] ( http://media.guregipuzkoa.net/photo/1024715/1024715_o.jpg ) . 
  franco was the commandant of the spanish troops in morocco and he also recruited 70,000 moroccan to fight in the spanish civil war . 
  [ they are asking for pensions and stuff ten years ago ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/cronica/2002/347/1023697480.html ) maybe you mean ethnic nationalism when you say * real * conservative . 
   because of that a lot of them are moving to the neighbouring countries . 
  let 's be honest . 
  it 's due to the oil induced salaries in norway . 
  they have currently a right-wing government . 
  the swedish official right wing is actually the highest proponent of those migration policies . 
  so , what should be done about that ? 
  people has been told that path to prosperity and hapiness is getting a fulltime job for everybody . 
  most of the people think that should be the main priority of the government . 
  most of the people lacks basic political culture and are easy to manipulate . 
  that 's true everywhere . 
   maximum employment is very poor goal . 
  you are going to have a problem selling that in societies with unemployments over 20 % . 
  if you say that it 's for generating employment you can do whatever you want . 
   the eu should first and foremost follow the law and its treaties , which it is n't doing at the moment . 
  some of them are simply impossible to follow like the ones that define the euro . 
  but there is n't interest to change them from certain countries because the current situation gives them a leverage that they would lose with a permanent solution . 
   social transfers are all forms of benefits , pensions , welfare , health care etc that 's forbidden still . 
  this was passed using the same treaties that legalize the cohesion funds . 
   and if we change the treaty to day that it should fight for example unemployment , then it should . 
  until that day however , it is not the eu 's thing , just like military is not an issue for the eu since the nations have their own military budgets . 
  are you sure that this was done to fight the unemployment ? 
  uk supported this for a reason . 
  mostly to try to stop the migration flux that has been going since the austerity plans started . 
  [ spanish is the fastest growing immigrant group now in uk ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/20130830/spaniards-fastest-growing-migrant-group-in-uk ) . 
  and portugal has broken [ its emigration record ] ( http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/news-brief/4281551-10000-people-leave-portugal-every-month ) . 
   love erasmus spain just axed its budget for that a 70 % starting next year . 
  edit : fix link, 
   thanks . 
  i do n't have a problem with the fact that the battle against unemployment is being fought , but i do not think that is eu 's fight to fight what battles should the eu fight ? 
  * migrations ? 
  * budgets ? 
  ( euro users only ) * food security ? 
  * fishing resources ? 
  * competence ? 
   to squeeze in welfare and social transfers btw , the eu forbids to use the money of this in welfare . 
  can you define social transfers ? 
  eu approved a program to support programs to fight youth unemployment recently . 
  [ link ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/esf/main.jsp?catid=67&amp;langid=en&amp;newsid=8150 ) the program funds some projects in high unemployment countries . 
  spain is using it to give tax breaks an social security discounts to companies that hire young people . 
  in my opinion , that 's creating even worse problems that the ones that it 's trying to solve . 
  the unemployment for not-young people is over 20 % already and many of these jobless have family responsibilities and have run out of benefits . 
  edit : there is also a social security discount for young self-employed the first six months from $ 180 to $ 50 . 
  ** context ** argentina called for extradition of some torturers that are still alive . 
  the spanish government is protecting them [ link ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/argentinian-judge-orders-arrest-of-franco-era-torturers-1.1533736 ) [ article about one of them ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/08/alleged-franco-torturer-discovered-madrid ), 
  yes . 
   when such a high proportion of such attacks are by members of the small proportion of the population who are muslim , then it 's idiocy to ignore that fact , and divert your law enforcement resources to surveilling the entire world .
