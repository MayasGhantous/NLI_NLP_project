  google translation : scholarships erasmus increasingly restrictive the government quietly changed the criteria for receiving financial aid should be awarded a scholarship erasmus . 
  the amendment , published in the official gazette of october 29 , includes as a prerequisite that the student benefiting from a general grant for the grant of the ministry of education . 
  jos\u00e9 ignacio wert , minister of education the ministry of education has changed the law with respect to erasmus . 
  if you had told melty.es and that the scholarships to study abroad with this program could become extinct , is now that we know that the government has approved a new cut of the same . 
  in the official gazette dated october 29 has been quietly published a change in the rules regarding the financing of the same . 
  and it is now a requirement to have been the beneficiary of a general scholarship for financial support provided by the ministry of education `` grant recipients are students selected for participation in the erasmus program during 2013 - 2014 [ ... ] and that in turn have been recipients of a grant from the so-called general granted by the ministry of education , culture and sports for the 2012/2013 . '', 
  more news on scraps 2013 scraps 2013 : erasmus endangered if the reform of the education act ( lomce ) known as ` wert act ' had already caused a stir among parents , teachers and students , the ministry of education is back in the spotlight with this new regulation . 
  the news fell like a cold water for students who are already enjoying their stay abroad and had the help of the ministry in order to sustain itself . 
  as is the case with andrea , a student at valencia 's 22 years in telecommunications engineering which was awarded an erasmus scholarship to study in brno , czech republic , during the current academic year : `` i would not say it looks normal now , we all knew he was going to cut but not taking anything i think the last straw . '', 
  she does not meet the requirements for eligibility for general scholarship , so you will not get the help the ministry offered to students . 
  `` moreover , the czech republic provides scholarships if you live in residence , you get about 75 euros every three months . 
  i get more help the czech republic that my own country , `` he says indignantly . 
  erasmus scraps 2013 seneca ** with the new rules , only those who received a general scholarship aid may receive the erasmus program intended mec ** so far , monthly aid offered to students participating in the european mobility program erasmus was about 115 euros by the european union over the amount that your university in spanish territory destined to the mobility of students . 
  the ministry of education could provide assistance ranging from 100 to 300 euros a month at best , depending on family income , `` basically through the scholarship could pay my accommodation , so that my expenses were reduced to the same as if they continued living in madrid `` confesses alberto , a journalism student and audiovisual communication 22 : '' without the scholarship families must make a great effort . '', 
  he enjoyed an erasmus stay during 2011-2012 in toulouse , france . 
  the truth is that to meet the payment of support themselves when outside the family home is no easy task for a student . 
  generally , and except those transferring to another city to pursue higher education , a student who still lives with his parents does not address individual of expenses like rent representing a ( residence or floor , water , electricity , gas , etc. . ) or food . 
  's life abroad in most cases turns out to be more expensive and renting a room in a shared apartment or residence may even triple the prices at which we are accustomed in spain : `` in my floor were four people and we paid 562 euros each party expenses , would be about 90 square meters ... `` said clara , student of art history that during the 26 years studied in paris 2011-2012 . 
  in a text that can be somewhat contradictory , as it opens with the numbers of students who have enjoyed the erasmus program and claims that spain is `` one of the three countries that have contributed to the program students over twenty-six years of history '' , the economic crisis takes an important role to justify changes in the grant of the same : '' in response to the situation of economic crisis in european countries , the european commission launched in march 2010 a strategy for smart , sustainable and inclusive europe 2020 call . 
  it sets out three priorities , one of which focuses precisely on education . '', 
  the government justifies this new cut as a form of `` application of criteria of effectiveness and efficiency in the management of public funds '' whose `` goal is to ensure that the input reaches the students participating in the community program for lower income mobility . '', 
  erasmus university university student cut statement requirement criteria wert boe approves modifications change wert exchange student international mobility jos\u00e9 ignacio riperasmus erasmusrip ministry of education the government approved a cut by 8.5 % ( twice as announced ) in the scholarship budget ricardo is 22 years old student of business administration at the university of valencia and understands that scholarships should be based on the income of the family unit : `` the scholarship is a financial aid , so that the choice when if ur or should not be guided by the rent . '', 
  but disagree on how to proceed from the government : `` it is very unfair to have advised once you 're gone erasmus and is very unfair to people who are not going to perceive '' . 
  he did qualify for a maintenance grant general and as andrea , also studying in czech republic thanks to erasmus mobility agreement . 
  the truth is that cuts in education that have taken place in the past two years , between 17 % and 32 % of fellows cease to be because of the new requirements and thresholds . 
  and already in may this year , the government approved a 8.5 % reduction in the budget for grants ( $ 107 million less than in the 2011-2012 school year ) , which included the seneca , scholarships national mobility extinct , and erasmus , of which recently lowered its amount to 3.67 million less for the same .

  i read that the population of portugal decreased for third yeard in a row . 
  however , your wikipedia figures do n't match that . 
  thus , i checked official figures . 
  * the wikipedia figures do n't match the [ offical figures ] ( http://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xpid=ine&amp;xpgid=ine_indicadores&amp;indocorrcod=0000611&amp;contexto=pi&amp;seltab=tab0&amp;xlang=en ) for 2012 : * year | population : ----- | : ---------- : 2009 | 10\u00a0573\u00a0479\u00a02010 | 10\u00a0572\u00a0721\u00a02011 | 10\u00a0542\u00a0398\u00a02012 | 10\u00a0487\u00a0289 with this we need to conclude also that portugal is getting near 60,000 immigrants per year . 
  and this is the third year in a row that portugal loses population . 
  i was thinking in the annual rate . 
  that 's more than 1 % of the population that 's scary . 
  but , i am starting to think that the austerity can reduce the unemployment even without job creation . 
  seat is n't spanish anymore . 
  volkswagen has bought seat keeping the production in spain ( in catalonia actually ) . 
  * psa ( peugeot-citro\u00ebn ) has factories in vigo and madrid * ford has a factory in valencia . 
  it 's their biggest factory in europe they recently closed a factory in belgium and are moving all the production to valencia . 
  * nissan : barcelona * volkswagen : has the big matorell complex ( seat and audi actually ) and a factory in pamplona ( navarra ) . 
  * suzuki : a factory in jaen ( andalusia ) * general motors ( mostly opel ) : a factory in zaragoza ( arag\u00f3n ) * damlier ( mercedes ) : has a factory in vitoria ( basque country ) * renault has factories in valladolid , palencia and sevilla . 
  they built almost as many cars in spain as in france . 
  spain is the country that builds more cars without having a national manufacturer ( there is a spanish company that makes trucks , but that 's it )  the point in here is that german producers and spanish producers are not competing in the same market . 
  the point is that there are n't spanish producers and spanish and german workers are competing in the same market . 
   the first order would have been to shutdown public constructions projects , that 's true . 
  we did too many public construction projects . 
  even if we had a surplus in the budget ( we had one due to all the cyclic income due to the housing ) there were better usages for the money . 
  furthermore , we did n't do a project that the eu has been asking for since 20 years the rail freight transport with international gauge with france going through catalonia and all the mediterranean . 
  and that 's one of the things that the catalonian government uses against spain . 
   the second thing would have been to limit building permits it 's funny because we liberalized the sector cutting the time for starting to built from years to months removing most of the public planning and analysis . 
  and the eu was very happy about that back in the day . 
   put new taxes to raise the price of new construction . 
  the taxes were high enough to be near 20 % of the public administration income ( at least that was the drop that we had in 2009 against 2007 in tax collection ) , maybe they could be even higher , the prices were rising 15 % per year between 1999 and 2006 . 
  an extra 5 % in taxes seems like a small drop . 
   gdp per capita nominal , as in hard currency is the best and only way to measure productivity . 
  that debate would be too complicated .
