  workers out of the market , retireement ages , labour market participation , purchasing power ... 
  i said in the eu in my original comment . 
  there is more organized crime than in greece in those places . 
  and ukraine makes greek politics seem clean . 
  eastern europe does n't have those levels of unemployment . 
  the people simply works and lives in poverty . 
  a lot of jobless people with politcally extremist ideas can generate a difficult situation . 
   who are creating these new terrorist generations even thought it should be obvious after the fall of the ussr that communist and socialism died as ideologies . 
  social unrest , high poverty and high unemployment . 
  we are ready . 
  [ we will fight the fire with more fire ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxdwb1sg4ri ), 
  there is a controversy in belarus , almost everybody else does n't care or is looking forward to see something fun/weird . 
  that 's not questionable at all . 
  it 's more gay than a gay musical called ` gay ' . 
   you could just send a good song ... what 's the fun in that ? 
  spain already won eurovision in the past and it 's not worth it . 
  you even have to waste money organizing the show the next year . 
  do they have consonants ? 
  spain is a big country . 
  you are partially right . 
  the spanish galicia and portugal are very similar and [ their language was the same ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galician-portuguese ) ( check the map ) until 2 days ago and for political reasons . 
  italy has influenced a lot spain , since the renaissance . 
  we even listen to some of their music nowadays i do n't know any portuguese musician . 
  [ berlusconi owns also a tv channel here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/telecinco ) and he has been meddling in spanish politics also . 
  it feels closer . 
  however , i am from a catalonian speaking area in the mediterranean spain and [ we have looking towards italy more than to portugal . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crown_of_aragon ) ( check the map ) . 
  my area has influenced a lot italy and the other way arround , specially the south ( oops ! ) . 
  for me italy is more similar than portugal . 
  i am even able to understand mostly the language . 
  maybe people from galicia would say the oposite , but you can feel the italian influence and presence in the spanish society while we do n't care about portugal . 
  without the italian invasion of greece that needed german help , nazis could have been in moscu before winter changing the course of the war . 
  we owe them a lot . 
  sadly , they did n't participated enough in the spanish civil war . 
  whereas the germans [ destroyed the basque cultural capital ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_guernica ) the [ italians tried to conquer madrid ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_guadalajara#aftermath ) : they were defeated completely and they lost equipement that was badly needed by the republic because the rebelion got the bulk of the spanish equipement . 
  without italy the spanish civil war could have ended more quickly . 
  after that they were aside giving logistic support and weapons to the rebelion . 
  the country has lost 20 % of its gdp has destroyed education , health care an a lot of long term projects . 
  it seems like reestructuring . 
  they are qualifying for cohesion funds again . 
  in ten years we will have a greece that has lost a big chunk of their young and skilled labour has an aging population that ca n't afford , has extremely high taxes , deteriorated infrastructure , weaker university system ... 
  the structural situation is going to be worse than now . 
  * probably the most similar country in the eu to spain . 
  * has a big variety of latin languages that its government is slowly killing * has an aging population and a below replacement birth rate . 
  * they are more conservative and catholic than us , but then italy elects berlusconi . 
  * they have berlusconi and before him they had andreotti . 
  these guys make almost everybody else seem a saint by comparision . 
  * it 's a nice country full art and historic buildings . 
  * italians drive like crazy even for my low standard . 
  [ the report ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ity_offpub/ks-ra-11-019/en/ks-ra-11-019-en.pdf ) from 2011 . 
  i am sure that there is more updated data somewhere , but i am not able to find it . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/np784_en.pdf ) is the spanish data for 2012 . 
  lower fertility for everybody : * spanish : 1.28 * foreign born : 1.54 * total : 1.32, 
  the birth rate is higher than the german born population , but it 's still bellow replacement levels . 
  [ eurostat document ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ity_offpub/ks-ra-11-019/en/ks-ra-11-019-en.pdf ) [ table screenshot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rdmwldf.png ) that 's true in some countries like italy . 
  but even immigrants have low fertility in germany . 
  france and uk do n't publish these figures . 
  but they seem to be similar to sweden . 
  can you tell more topics about countries that you do n't know ? 
  * [ spain is one of the bigger producers of vehicles ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_motor_vehicle_production ) * [ exports of spain ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/spain_export_treemap.png )  because chinese producers have taken over their markets , for example textile and clothing manufacturing has taken a large hit in south and as those economies are very rigid , they have n't been able to create new industrial sectors and jobs from them . 
  what about the construction bubble ? 
  spain built more new homes per year than uk , germany and france together . 
  5 years ago like 20 % of the spanish workers were employed by the housing sector , \u00e7 that was financed by crazy levels of private debt ; those levels were posible to lower rates to support german reunification and capital flowing also from german and french banks . 
  the eu meant that spain was n't able to raise the interests . 
  [ just saying : productivity figures ] ( http://www.eustat.es/elem/ele0002500/tbl0002544_i.html ), 
   berlusconi would mean progress compared to current political scene . 
  you do n't know what you are saying, 
   i do n't claim to be an expert , but i remember reading somewhere that the unofficial sector in spain accounts for a large share of the economy . 
  it might be possible for people to find occasional jobs that supplement the benefits . 
  am i wrong ? 
  the shadow economy is big , [ but it is n't so big ] ( http://i.imgur.com/avkjzav.gif ) . 
  as you see is in the eu average . 
  it has been in a similar rate since forever when we had full employment had a similar size . 
  so , so . 
  most of the underground economy is handled by people that has a steady source of income . 
  doctors in the public health care that have also a private practice that hides his profits ( my uncle does this ) , software developers that do freelance work under table , people that works for the construction companies that do public works doing freelance stuff on weekends ... people prefer to hire somebody able to keep a job even in the shadow economy . 
  the shadow economy for jobless is mostly picking oranges and cleaning houses . 
  that can work in germany , but i do n't expect it to work in romania or bulgaria . 
  and even the immigrants from outside the eu have a low birth rate in germany . 
  the low birth rate will reduce the unemployment by then , probably . 
  i edited part of it . 
  but i got tired when i was in the * human * part . 
  * translation : * while unemployment continues to grow , collecting unemployment benefits or a pension is getting more difficult after each reform . 
  thousands of young people are choosing between emigration and permanent precariousness . 
  for jobless over 50 those options seem to be denied also . 
  talking about employment in spain is talking about outrageous figures and percentages . 
  the registered unemployment at the inem is approaching to 5 million of jobless , whereas the labout force survey ( epa ) registers 6 millions of spaniards unable to find a job . 
  one in three adults is jobless in certain autonomous regions . 
  however some figures are more than numbers , it is easy to imagine the personal histories that they carry . 
  like that figure that tells that there are about 1,821,000 households with no member employed . 
  or the two million people who have exhausted unemployment benefits and have been left out of any help . 
  in recent years , as unemployment grew , support for the unemployed was reduced in each new labor regulations . 
  the cuts begin from the moment of being unemployed : the latest labor reform reduced most usual severance payment from 45 to 20 days ' salary per year worked . 
  the jobless only get 50 % of their last salary after six months , instead of the 60 % that they got previously . 
  and when you run out of unemployment benefits , the restrictions for getting a subsidy of 426 euros after exhausting unemployment benefits are harder than never . 
  furthermore , the other options to the miracle that getting hired has become have n't improved . 
  there are n't measures to support people who try to create a small business or being self-employed ^ ** 1 ** . 
  on the other hand , the pension reform adopted by the previous government is extending the age of entitlement to retirement . 
  the age is increasing progressively to 67 years in 2027 ** off the map ** * not edited * but there are realities that do not fit in any figures . 
  the helplessness of young people forced to choose between precariousness and exile .
