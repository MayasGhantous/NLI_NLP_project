  probably they are pretending to be fools to get back their money from the seller in court . 
  serbia bad , that clay is kebab clay now . 
  you feel that 's needed state that . 
  i think that your country has to be really nice . 
  i do n't think that anybody though in other possibility in spain . 
  anyway , he got another term of office as province president after that was made public . 
  however , province president is n't a directly elected office . 
  people vote in municipal elections to lists . 
  the elected councilors elect the majors , and the major elect the president . 
  and there is a small twist here , in the conservative pp the province president elects the candidates to councilors and is the candidate to president . 
  then his party councilors elect him as province party president as the only candidate in all the internal elections in the last 20 years . 
  his father was the province president in dictatorship times , and the president of the dictatorship single party . 
  the transition to democracy meant that a new generation took care of the business . 
  and there was a social-democratic guy that got the presidency some years , but the fabra family got the power again . 
  edit : he has retired from the province institutions recently because has had a cancer and he was becoming a problem for the party , but he still manages the province party and some local institutions . 
  [ half of the members of the council fit that definition . ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_council_on_tolerance_and_reconciliation ) . 
  most of them are male members of right wing european parties , two moderate social-democratic and 2 independent . 
  it even includes a putin 's foreign affair minister . 
  i am thinking that they are trying to sell a police state to progressive people . 
  [ members of the council ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_council_on_tolerance_and_reconciliation ) : includes the spanish ex-pm jose maria aznar . 
  he should be in a list of citizens to surveil then : * [ his government closed a pro-independence basque newspaper ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/egunkaria ) with suspicious proofs in 2003 . 
  everybody was acquitted in 2010 , but the diary was death by then . 
  * his government supported failed coups against the governments of equatorial guinea and venezuela . 
  equatorial guinea was a dictatorship , like now , but it 's exactly a good record . 
  * he also protected criminals members of the argentinian and spanish dictatorships . 
  [ link ] ( http://notife.com/6991-izquierda-unida-denunciara-a-aznar-por-extraditar-a-represores-argentinos/ ) -- the is also his involvement in corruption affairs related with the construction of high speed trains , privatization of the telecommunications monopoly and regulations to increase artificially the profits of the energy companies but those are n't related with his human rights records . 
  ** spain ** * [ european court of human rights rules spain must free eta prisoner ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/d2bc5f72-3a4d-11e3-9243-00144feab7de.html ) : the release of at least 61 eta prisoners and 14 other convicts is imminent . 
  * i think that it 's good news , i 'm fucking tired of my government doing things that we knew from the beginning that are illegal . 
  * * [ eta victims asociation and the ruling party have organized a demostration against the court 's ruling ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/10/27/inenglish/1382887237_273407.html ) . 
  * not exactly successful , some thousands of demostrators . 
  * * [ nsa also spied spain ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/10/25/inenglish/1382703360_329586.html ) * spanish ex-president felipe gonz\u00e1lez has created a foundation to study his political trajectory . 
  [ yes , it 's real ] ( http://elboenuestrodecadadia.com/2013/10/25/felipe-gonzalez-crea-una-fundacion-para-estudiar-su-figura/ ) . 
  * he was the first social-democratic president after the dictatorship . 
  in my opinion , a corrupt piece of shit who was involved in [ state terrorism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grupos_antiterroristas_de_liberaci%c3%b3n ) * * [ spanish unemployment falls due to temporary hiring for summer tourist period and reduction of workforce size ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/10/24/inenglish/1382616094_241548.html ) : employment increased by 39,500 , the size of the total active population declined in the quarter by 33,300 . 
  minor : * demonstrations against stupid education policies * manolo escobar ( musician ) has died . 
  * an homosexual businessman has been killed brutally by catalan police because reasons . 
  small expat affair : * andalusia demolished an illegal home owned by [ british expats . 
  ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/20131017/home-demolition-video-sparks-expat-outrage ) there are an estimated 300,000 illegal homes only in andalusia and the regional government has started actions against like 50,000 of them and that 's going to end with demolitions and/or high fines . 
  * the expats seem to think that they are the principal victims . 
  they say that they did n't expected that those finished houses that were on sale in the market openly had been built illegally . 
  maybe they are saying the truth . 
   romania threatens to block the canada-eu trade deal unless ottawa lifts the visa requirements for romanians . 
  [ 2 ] does your government actually want to get ride of the population ? 
  romania has lost already 3 millions of inhabitants due to emigration ( near 15 % of the population ) . 
  do n't get high in your own supply . 
  what ? 
  the map . 
  sorry , but [ it 's in asia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antalya ), 
  are there anybody still in latvia ? 
   and the whole aut\u00f3nomo situation could be good or bad . 
  i think spain will need a lot of entrepeneurs to get out of the crisis but will find that with so much educated talent willing to work for such little money , the international community will come soon . 
  i think that the figures are mostly due to the popularization of the fake [ self-employment that was legalized in 2007 . 
  ] ( http://www.sefcarm.es/web/pagina?idcontenido=41040&amp;idtipo=100&amp;rastro=c$m29962,40948 ) now , it 's legal be self-employed working exclusively for a business that puts the production means and the government has approved a lot of social security discounts for self-employed that are starting a * business * for the first time , are under 30 , are over 45 and long term unemployed ... a dependent self-employee has a lot of advantages : you do n't have to pay sick days , you can fire them when they are pregnant , can be fired for free for forever ... 
  besides that with the last social security reasons you have more flexibility with the social security . 
  paying a net minimum wage of 704.50 ^ 1 euros/month ( after social security and public unemployment insurance ) cost for an employer 982.62 euros the minimum cost is 224.5 euros for that . 
  a self-employed can pay a minimum of 90 euros in the first six months . 
  and 180-245 euros/month in many situations whatever they earn 700 euros/month or 3000 euros . 
  the government takes from this at least 1.2 % of the minimum wage as income tax if you do n't have children . 
  9 euros/month in this case . 
  this [ link ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/10/24/inenglish/1382616094_241548.html ) can be better . 
  headlines : * employment increased by 39,500 people to 16.823 million . 
  * the number of people out of work in the period july-september declined by 72,800 to 5.904 million . 
  * the number of people on indefinite contracts fell by 146,300 * the number of people hired on a temporary basis rose by 169,500 . 
  * 15,200 new self-employed workers . 
  * the size of the total active population declined in the quarter by 33,300 to 22.728 million , possibly influenced by an increase in the number of young people who have emigrated . 
  edit : about the training programs and unemployment : * spain has applied austerity to training programs for jobless . 
  the number of people in those programs has fallen a 50 % since the conservatives got the power . 
  * the people in training programs are counted as jobless in these figures , but not in the ones that the public employment services publishes every month . 
   but we do n't have bonuse like that in the swedish parlament , and they do the same . 
  the spanish parlament does n't have bonuses like that either . 
  spain has a bicameral system : * the senate has low attendance , because it 's mostly consultive and most senators have other jobs . 
  it 's sort of pointless . 
  it reads again the laws and votes again . 
  and if they vote something different the congress overrides their vote . 
  * the congress actually has power and has higher attendance . 
  i have the feeling that the eu parlament is weak and does n't have power . 
  and that 's the reason why political parties and citizens do n't take seriously the eu elections . 
  like nobody in spain takes seriously the senate ( except because senators are judged but the supreme court , and not an ordinary court ) . 
   no , voting is part of their job . 
  not the only part , but an important part . 
  one do not give doctors bonuses for keeping medical records or judges bonuses for writing sentences , even if that is just a part of their job . 
  i am not defending that bonus , i am talking about was the job of a politician . 
  their job is defending the interests of the people that voted them . 
  voting is one of the tools that they have for their work . 
   can anyone explain to me why they get bonuses for doing their job ? 
  because they define their own bonuses . 
  and voting and doing their job are different things . 
  sometimes somebody voting is n't doing his job like this case and sometimes a politician is doing his job not voting . 
  this new is an example of the former , for the last in my regional parlament there was a polemic because the president of the parlament/valencia ) was manipulating the rules to favour the ruling party . 
  the members of a minority left party boicotted some sessions for trying to get attention over the issue ( and once again people seemed uninterested even if the violation of the rules was rampant ) . 
  i think that being able to send somebody holding office to jail improves romania 's image . 
  for things like this i am happy to be in the eu . 
  we have at least some courts that are n't under control of the spanish government . 
  a great day for the defensors of the rule of the law . 
  can you define that basic income ? 
   for there to be eu level social services and healthcare system , first all members themselves must create national ones . 
  romania is too poor to create a welfare state with its own fund even if the taxes go to over 50 % of the gdp . 
  you ca n't pretend that countries with $ 15,000 per capita in ppp have the same public services and living standards by themselves than countries with $ 40,000 . 
  it 's simply impossible . 
  sometimes i think that spain has been more successful than other countries integrating the roma because we are selective with our law enforcing .
