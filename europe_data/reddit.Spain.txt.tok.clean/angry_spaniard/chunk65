  sometimes extreme , sometimes non-existing . 
  something similar happens with scotland and uk . 
  do you think that scotland should leave uk due to that ? 
   but what should one do ? 
  i am not asking you to do anything . 
   if you do not have the money , you ca n't spend it . 
  [ spain had a lot of money ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=ds22a34krhq5p_#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=gd_pc_gdp&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:eu:non-eu&amp;idim=country:es:se&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=es&amp;dl=es&amp;ind=false ) . 
  you can see how has behaved the spanish public debt these years . 
   or , are you suggesting that someone else pays spain 's bills . 
  i am not sugesting that . 
  i was saying saying that austerity is codeword for paying private debts with public funds . 
  at least in my country , since spain started the austerity program ( private debt bailouts , more regressive tax system and cuts in education , health care , r&d , investments and benefits ) in the middle of 2010 the public debt is rising quicker than before . 
  edit : and of course the companies that profited [ from the austerity have paid for it ] ( http://www.enel.com/en-gb/governance/board/directors/solbes/ ), 
   ( some of them are embracing evangelical christianity and are abandoning arranged marriages and keep their kids in school longer ) i did n't know that it 's happening also in romania !, 
  that started to happen in spain like 30 years ago and it 's weird for me but i think that the evangelical church helped more than the government in integrating them . 
  and i am an atheist from a catholic country . 
   could n't you confiscate the children on the grounds that they are n't giving their children a proper education and/or quality of life ? 
  you can try that . 
  it will have a price in blood , but it can be worth it . 
  edit : spain have been going with long term integration programs the last 40 years . 
  spain is now the country with the best integrated roma population . 
  however , their crime rate is an order of magnitude higher than the mainline spaniards and there are still problems with them . 
  however , there are 30,000 eastern europe roma ( called in spain romanians because they are mostly from romania ) and they generate as many problem as the 600,000 that were born in spain . 
  and that 's like 6,000,000 of the more mainline population . 
  you know that the people does n't want it to happen . 
  i have curiosity about what do you think that should be done to reduce the pain . 
   and forces more specalization what if it does n't happen ? 
  spain has still to decide what to do with the regions that specialized in coal mining and the regions that specialized in fishing and ship building . 
  the population is emigrating , but it 's very slow due to the huge rate of home ownership and lack of opportunities in the possible destinations for people with the qualifications of most of the jobless . 
  besides that southern spain has been strongly affected by the trade agreement with marroco that removed most of the restrictions for importing farming products from marroco . 
  edit : that beside the construction madness . 
  the total size of the economies grows usually with this kind of deals , but it can generate economic depressions in areas specialized in activities where new there are more competitive replacements . 
  and there is n't any plan for dealing with that , of course . 
  that can be in germany . 
  in my country is government cutting health care , education , r&d plus regressive tax raises ; all that for expending billions in bailouts of regional saving banks , private toll roads , football clubs , ghost airports , converting private debts in public debt , buying real state at bubble prices to the banks that financed their electoral campaign , giving billions to an energy cartel of 5 companies that has +20 retired politicians or relatives in their boards and blocks any competence ... 
  austerity is the new name of the corruption . 
  or even people in poverty has to pay higher taxes ( vat ) and retrieve less support from the society . 
  we have to cut education , health care , r&d and social services this is damaging our future more than more people losing their saving ( and a lot of people lose them anyway , you can check the preferencial shares scams that the regional saving banks commited ) . 
  if we are pragmatic a lot of our jobless do n't have a place in a economy where the construction is n't 20 % of out gdp . 
  and we are n't offering training or anything to them . 
  there are better usages to public funds that the current ones . 
  it can make sense . 
  you need to have open eyes to live in a country where many business declare losses because they get most their income in the black market . 
  spain has a system call * estimaci\u00f3n objetiva * ( objective estimation ) [ that allows a a small business to hide part of its income legally . 
  97 % of the taxis are under this system . 
  ] ( http://blogs.publico.es/multiplicateporcero/309/impuestos-que-no-se-pagan-acabar-con-los-modulos/ ) ( spanish sorry ) the people in this system declare an average income of 10,862 euros . 
  whereas the average spanish salary is 22,000 euros . 
  and if you read the link you can read that they are exempted from any inspection if their company factures less than 450,000 euros in the legal economy . 
  how fucked are their accounts does n't matter . 
  they often get involved in vat fraud conspirations to help other companies to avoid paying taxes for s. 
  however , 50 % of brainwashed fools sounds optimistic . 
   it is much more than that . 
  no one really expect a crisis to last forever . 
  challenge accepted !, 
  why ? 
  a construction company builds because there is demand . 
  the demand was speculative , the homes were n't built for getting people living in them . 
  nobody cared about that detail : you built because you can sell at high price , and you buy because in a year you will be able to sell for a price a15 % higher than the one that you paid . 
  [ there three millions and half of empty houses ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/page/view/spains-empty-home-count-hits-new-high#.uxfjnar3vku ) and spain lost population in 2012 and this year will lose even more . 
   though there are a great many ) , it 's the ones in low-paid jobs willing to work illegally for less than the minimum wage what about enforcing that minimum wage and giving fines to the employers ? 
  free circulation of labour is in the rules . 
  if you do n't like it you can leave the union . 
  the spanish conservatives have been supporting a big government the last 200 hundred years . 
  where they socialist ? 
  even when they supported absolute monarchy ? 
  would libia and tunisia take illegal immigrants that italy rejects that are mostly from somalia and eritrea ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  they did n't get in these countries legally and they are n't in these countries anymore . 
  unless we pay these countries to * handle * them like spain is doing with marroco for the ones that spain catches in ceuta and melilla . 
   there are 600,000 unemployed eu immigrants living in the uk , is the eu somehow claiming that this 600,000 people is n't a considerable cost in many ways to the uk taxpayer ? 
  how many of them get any benefits ? 
   italian prisons are overcrowded and the parliament is thinking of a general pardon for those convicted of non-violent crimes . 
  does this include berlusconi ?
