  let 's wait for the things that she did in the national government . 
  extra row : * [ more silly stuff with gigraltar ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/spain-demands-gibraltar-prove-accusations-made-un-180037117.html ), 
  can your country remove the citizenship to people for ideological reasons ? 
  i am sure that any law like that would be against the spanish constitution at least, 
  it 's like blacks are n't real * american * for certain groups . 
  but , spain is supposed to be a rich western european country with a gdp per capita in the european average and twice more than romania . 
  but then there are increasing levels of poverty and desesperation to scary levels . 
  the law is going to be sent to the constitutional court by the catalonian government that said that catalonia is going to boicot the law whatever happens . 
  the most likely outcome is that the lawsuit is admited by the court that will suspend the application of the law until they make a decision . 
  and the social-democratic minority will delay any decision until after 2015 elections when is expected that spain will have a new majority that will pass another law . 
  that may be sent to court ... 
  this is so stupid . 
  we already have cyprus in asia . 
  maybe he means countries like turkey , armenia and israel . 
  that would be unlikely , but * interesting * . 
  even italy , a country which is linguistically more unified than belgium [ what ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_italy ) : they have a * national * language , but italy is way more diverse than almost any other eu country . 
  however , they are working in changing that they are second to france in trying to kill regional and minority languages . 
  i love how the people behaves in internet when they do n't have to pretend that give a shit about other people 's lifes . 
  edit : this comment is also sort of heartless , i know . 
   what will happen to the horse when he arrives ? 
  what will happen to the horse anyway ? 
  [ a lot of them are being sold for meat anyway ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1crmf9/legendary_horses_to_be_slaughtered_as_spains/ ) . 
  a horse is a very expensive * pet * . 
  and a lot of estables are closing in spain . 
   or does ' ... where you intend to work in a riding stables . ', 
  mean that he already has a signed employment contract ? 
  no , as far as i know he is doing this as a desperate attemp to get a job . 
  if this fails he will go back to spain , probably ( he is still in spain at this moment ) . 
  it 's another boat . 
  you forgot the monarchy . 
  the population . 
  for starters , they elected and reelected obviously corrupt politicians who were stealing money from them and they liked it . 
   ( less regulation or more subsidies ) we did that in 1999 . 
  that can end badly .

  i do n't know about portugal and italy , but the spanish construction companies ( now including the ones that do mostly public construction works because the cuts in infrastructure ) and most of the formerly public monopolies ( like [ telefonica ] ( http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/sb10001424127887324662404578331751121560398 ) ) and some conventional companies ( [ el corte ingl\u00e9s ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/19/us-elcorteingles-debt-idusbre97i0lf20130819 ) , [ pescanova ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/10/pescanova-idusl6n0fg3nz20130710 ) ) are ill-managed and in serious difficulties , and [ the companies that built and manage the unneeded ghost toll roads ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/28/spain-infrastructure-idusl6n0bs2aj20130228 ) . 
  what companies are in a bad situation in your country ? 
  mario monti is also right wing and he got a third of berlusconi 's votes . 
  you need to read about [ andreotti ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/giulio_andreotti ) , the piece of shit who was the most powerful italian before berlusconi . 
  the problem was there before berlusconi , sadly . 
   the organization is interested in having the number of lawyers to a minimum to keep their incomes high . 
  the spanish professional association wants to increase the number of members because they collect a fee for every member . 
  and that allows higher salaries for the people * working * full time in the association . 
   how is it possible ? 
  we do n't have an economy and we are harsh with the assylum seekers ( unless they are from cuba and we have a conservative government ) . 
  we have sent too many to marroco ( and marroco drives them to the middle of the dessert and leaves them there ) to be a popular destination . 
  we are paying a lot to marroco for that .

  however , spain kept the minors and the women . 
  i am and i voted . 
  i ca n't understand how the hell my country ( spain ) gave the second biggest majority in our history to a party and leader who where under prosecution for illegal financing and undertable extra payments before the elections ( for stuff that they did between 1996-2008 ) . 
  and it seems like the guy and the party are guilty , but thanks to their control over the judicial system they are going to walk free . 
  the only guy prosecuted is the ex-treasurer now . 
  he did everything , the ministers and regional governments that gave the contracts to the companies that gave millions to the party did n't know anything . 
  i feel like the majority of the spaniards are morons . 
  however , i am sure that i am too haughty . 
  this is the kind of country and the kind of government that my fellow spaniards seem to like . 
  who am i to question them ? 
  they probably have their reasons . 
  but , for me this destroying my country . 
  and maybe literally , let 's see what happens with catalonia . 
  edit : however like / u/sasp777 says almost all the spanish media supported the corrupt piece of shit that won the elections . 
  and the ones that did n't support him supported the social-democratic morons that were in power or the regional media in catalonia and basque country that supported their current nationalist ruling parties . 
  voting the guys that say obvious lies like that they are going to increase the expenses in public services and cut taxes in spain in 2011 is moronic even if all the media says that you should do that . 
  they are morons anyway . 
  edit2 : [ more employment less taxes ] ( http://i.imgur.com/czhtd35.jpg ), 
  i do n't think that you can make an important political change voting . 
  most of the voters are too conservatives to support any strong political change . 
  and that 's missing the regional optional additional rates . 
  [ catalonia goes up to 56 % ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/economia/20121022/54353326513/catalunya-irpf-alto.html ) . 
  where are you going ? 
  you can calculate your effective taxation with an excel file that there is [ here ] ( http://www.irpf.eu/ ) . 
  edit : if you are honest in spain you get public services like in usa and taxes like in sweden . 
   every time we 've interacted is you jumping on me with your messages about asserting spanish imperialism onto us can you link that ? 
  and seriously : there is too much hate in your comments . 
   ultra-nationalist spaniard like yourself should understand that enough to stop spreading untruths like your faux-moderate post i 'm replying to . 
  and here are the traditional personal attack and strawman . 
  it 's actually part of asia . 
   a brit employee , may argue it would be the same as they would not work for # 1 an hour . 
  i am not so sure . 
  # 1 is better than zero . 
  it 's too extreme probably , but there are reports that day laborers in andalucia ( [ 35.79 % unemployment ] ( http://www.datosmacro.com/paro-epa/ccaa ) ) [ have been working this summer in spain for $ 2.5 the hour ] ( http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2013/08/07/andalucia/1375898462_129958.html ) and our minimum wage is like 4.7 + social contributions . 
  people would work for salaries that are too low to make ends meet if there is n't other options . 
  they would do that and try to collect benefits , live with relatives , ask for food and clothes to the catholic church ... 
   as exemplified by his attempt to give gibraltar to spain in secret a decade ago . 
  give gibraltar ? 
  it was a shared sovereignty agreement giving you similar status to andorra ( without independent foreign policy ) . 
  secret ? 
  you rejected the agreement in referendum . 
  negotiations ' term where private until the final proposal , but you knew that there where negotiations and gibraltar knew the final agreement and [ rejected it in referendum in 2002 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gibraltar_sovereignty_referendum,_2002 ) . 
  i would start a new attempt the next day . 
  and i told you a solution that fits your only requirement . 
  then you should try to convince your govenment to sink the boats and do n't resque anybody . 
  it 's the most effective way . 
  africa is not a single country . 
  why should libia take people that are n't from their country but not italy ? 
  ok , we are n't going to do anything . 
  can we say that it 's a tragedy at least ? 
  i am only pointing to a problem .
