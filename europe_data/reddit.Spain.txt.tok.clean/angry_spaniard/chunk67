  i am not expected to solve it . 
  the things that we can do are only invest more in sea security . 
  enforce the maritim laws that forbide let people to die in the sea when it 's known that they are going to die ( there was a situation when the french and spanish fleet saw a boat sink and they did n't do anything , the persons that survived are going to court ) . 
  there is also the small problem of their home countries . 
  let 's be honest . 
  i would take the risk of dying in a boat before living in a country like somalia or eritrea . 
  and that 's even harder to fix . 
  do n't you see a problem in that either ? 
  how fucked are you ? 
  because we as society see a problem in that . 
  we are expending billions in road safety , education , prevention , laws and r&d to get safer cars ... [ the death rate in care accidents is lower than in the 60s in spain ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/09/03/actualidad/1378206677_900556.html ) . 
  why am i supposed to have a solution ? 
  i am only a random guy with internet . 
  i am only trying to focus in the issue that the pope is talking about . 
  there is a fucking drama here . 
  we are too self-obsessed with our problems . 
  20 thousand persons have died in boats trying to get in europe the last 20 years . 
  what do you think about that ? 
  i ca n't find the total amount of fines . 
  the prosecutor asked for 3.8 billions , but the judge has been benevolent .

   those africans not . 
  they deserve to live in shit , and deal with it . 
  specially the ones that were born in the middle of the war that has lasted 20 years in somaliia . 
  keep blaming the victim . 
  then he 's qualified ,, 
  our countries are falling to pieces that should make them less attractive . 
   there are whole camps of people living right outside of calais in subhuman conditions for example !, 
  do you mean like the conditions in their origin countries ? 
  emigrate is the rational decision . 
  there is a risk of dying and you probably be in a rough path some years , but it 's the path that it 's more likely to have an acceptable outcome . 
  i would do the same . 
  and you ? 
  the situation is still way better than their origin country . 
  i do n't that theveducation is the solution , leaving their native countries is the most rational action usually . 
  spain my feeling : they are a bunch of corrupt pieces of shit with a lot of shady businesses . 
  they are similar to our elected politicians . 
  [ the king saved his daughter from a corruption prosecution connected with criminal affairs of the ruling party . 
  ] ( http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/aleqm5gnlzqbjjgnweyatfitfvs72rdg7g?docid=cng.9b7f33b760e33ef47d61c1afd7a5b14e.621&amp;hl=en ) however , he is going to give to justice his son in law . 
  it 's something . 
  there are proofs that the king knew everything since 2006 , but he decided trying to hide the affair until it was impossible . 
  besides that , there are the classics like using public resources to provide a house to king 's mistress . 
  and his involvement in the oil business and in construction projects in arabia using his diplomatic immunity . 
  the king also donated to the government luxury cars to avoid paying taxes ... 
  the monarchy is n't as popular as before . 
  but , it has still enough popular support for similar reasons as berlusconi . 
  [ english source ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-rise-and-fall-of-king-juan-carlos-saviour-of-spain-8846584.html ) * surveys show that the number of spanish republicans more than tripled between 1998 and the end of last year , from 11 to 37 per cent . 
  and the latest study , by the state polling institute cis , shows that public confidence in the royals fell in april to 3.68 points out of 10 -- from 4.89 in 2011 , which was already the monarchy 's first `` fail grade '' since surveys began .

  spain is more expansive than you think . 
  however , you can live by yourself with that money . 
  but , i think you should avoid madrid , barcelona , donosti/san sebastian and bilbao . 
  valencia , the third city of spain is fairly cheap or if you are concerned about the language barrier you can go to the most turistic areas like balearic islands or alicante . 
  but , if you are interested in travelling by train in spain i would stick to alicante or valencia . 
  murcia or malaga/marbella can be ok . 
  but i am not so sure about that . 
  the rent is getting cheaper with the three millions and half of empty houses . 
  but , the government is getting crazy and trying to block any visa requirement to cut immigration . 
  it 's funded privately , like / u/adagencies says , even if the catholic religion gets billions every year . 
  most of that money is used to fund the catholic schools and to pay catholic religion teachers in the public . 
  they are also exempted of paying real estate taxes and other stuff . . 
  anyway , catholic chuch 's internal normative states that only private donations ( including the tickets ) can be used to build expiatory churches . 
   what do people think about the time zone change ? 
  it can be a serious proposal , but nobody thinks that the government will actually do it .

  the guy requested to a local artist a giant statue to the promotors of the airport ( mostly himself ) , the aircraft in the head represents that the idea of the airport started in his/their head ( it sounds very childish ) .

  can your corrupt oligarchics match this ?

   neither has kosovo signed the stabilization and association agreement , aimed at kick-starting the eu membership process and , it 's not going to happen if spain has a say . 
  spain does n't recognize kosovo 's independence and it would be a precedent that would be used by the pro-independence movements . 
  they want to finish it for the centennial of gaudi 's death .
