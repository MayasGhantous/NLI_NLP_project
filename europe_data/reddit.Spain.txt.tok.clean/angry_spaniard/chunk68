  the proposal is send all the roma to romania . 
   i cant imagine spain not having a universal form of social welfare , granted i might be wrong , but its doubtful . 
  why ? 
  spain has some social welfare . 
  but , it 's not exactly universal and does n't cover all the things the more advanced eu countries have . 
  spain collects 37 % of gdp with taxes ( against 40 % of germany or 50 % of france ) with a smaller gdp per capita and wastes a big part of that money . 
  all the unemployment benefits expire in two years and get smaller after the first 6 months . 
  after that you can qualify for between 6 months and two years of 428 euros if the average income of your family is under minimum wage ( $ 753 ) . 
  the benefit can bee permanent for people over 55 that has worked more than 15 years . 
  [ at this point 40 % the unemployed do n't get any social benefit . 
  ] ( http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2013/04/02/actualidad/1364929407_967760.html ) there were 5,04 millions of registered jobless in february , a total of 2.9 millions had right to benefits , and a record of de 2.137.390 did n't get any benefit . 
   for instance , in say , germany or france , the social services make you eligible to have your own livingspace , aka flat , the utilities , computer/tv , phone/internet etc. 
  who provides that with what money ? 
  does the government provide that or gives them money for getting those things . 
  we have too many people that ca n't provide for themselves and the government says that does n't have the resources to help them . 
  it 's actively pushing them to live with relatives . 
  it 's very common see full families living in the grandparents house . 
  it 's amazing that you can stay so clueless about how bad is the situation in spain and how small is the spanish welfare . 
  we have discussions even about keeping the school kitchen open to feed the students of families without resources . 
  [ it was done ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/08/23/inenglish/1377258753_657101.html ) , at least . 
  -- a probably not very representative examples : * [ a man appears hanged in the street ten days after being evicted in alicante ] ( http://www.diarioinformacion.com/sucesos/2013/04/13/hombre-aparece-ahorcado-calle-diez-dias-despues-desahuciado-alicante/1362872.html ) * [ a regional government starts the eviction of 200 families that are n't able to pay the social housing rent ] ( http://dclm.es/noticia.php?id=14947 ) * [ a couple of retirees suicided after retrieve the eviction notice ] ( http://www.diariodemallorca.es/sucesos/2013/02/12/pareja-jubilados-suicida-recibir-aviso-desahucio/826160.html ) edit : from the public tv web : ** [ to school hungry and without notebook : the crisis is harder with children in spain ] ( http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20120607/pobreza/532380.shtml ) ** enough dramatic histories what 's being done to fix that : * [ the platform of mortgage victims is occupying illegally unused homes ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/catalunya/pah-barcelona-edificio-familias-desahucios_0_152934858.html ) : the platform has * got * homes for 600 hundred families only in catalonia . 
  * [ dozens have been under arresrt for stopping or trying to stop evictions ] ( http://alcorconrepublicano.es/madrid/decenas-de-detenidos-por-intentar-parar-un-desahucio-en-villaverde/ ), 
  there are also homeless that are homeless because they ca n't afford to have a house , a lot of them in spain at least . 
  do not assume that everywhere is like your country . 
  btw , where are you from ? 
  any way we are talking about hungary , i do n't if hungary offers anything to the people that does n't have anything . 
  is it going to be an offense or a crime ? 
  if they go to the offense path is not going to change anything . 
  it 's almost funny . 
  being homeless is a minor offense in spain and they can get fines that they do n't pay ( no banks accounts or salaries ) and that 's all . 
  most of our local police have stopped enforcing that because they feel that it 's a waste of time . 
  being cynical they can be passing this law to use it against opposition activist that camp in the streets . 
   you had to bailout the private sector . 
  why ? 
  the government allowed them to go nuts , but it 's not like the government make overspent and missinvest . 
   it also indicates that keynesian investment would have gotten spain out of the current recession quite fast . 
  i though that but the social-democratic government that we had before tried that during 2 years without success before running out of money . 
  the plan was n't very good , put unemployed people in training whatever training ( we even trained more construction workers ) , public construction projects . 
  and give money to local and regional administrations for construction projects that we did n't need . 
   if the private one is n't as productive and competitivness as it should be then it can no longer sustain the public one to a high percent yes , the private sector is very inefficient and wasteful , way more than you can find anywhere else . 
   i agree . 
  perhaps a elaborate reform of the tax system ( including capital gains , vat , income taxes , etc ) may be in order ? 
  yes , but i can trust a tax reform done with the current framework i already wrote about reforms that spain needs and our problems . 
  [ one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1frwfh/youth_unemployment_in_the_eu/cad8tjv ) [ two ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1h2g6i/one_in_four_of_spains_young_peopleaged_15_to_29/caqnfk2 )  it 's up to you how you do that . 
  ( of course , this could be fixed by other means ... but this would be how we both benefit from the trade equally ) what do you mean is that nobody cares about the spanish internal problems that they want spanish government to pay spanish external private debt besides the public one and how we do that is our problem ? 
  ok , i can understand that but this is going to backfire . 
   ps : i 'm sorry for using bmw 's , audi 's , tacos and tequilla . 
  i found it amusing :d it 's very amusing , because spain has an [ important car manufacturer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:spain_export_treemap.png ) and finding tacos and tequila in spain 's very hard and they are all imported . 
   it 's not relevant . 
  i meant the real value of unemployment that is reported right now in spain . 
  i wrote a lot and i did n't finish my point . 
  i think that the rate of black economy is similar nowadays , but with lower incomes than before and a big chunk is for people with regular jobs . 
  [ 57 % of the people between 16 and 65 years have a formal job . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/o5ismge.png ) we lost almost 15 points in the last 5 years . 
  the people with a regular black market income is going near 5 % and most of them in poverty nowadays . 
  but , there is more casual small jobs under table . 
   you do have a progressive tax system : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/income_tax_in_spain[1] that 's the income tax . 
  there is also the vat , social security and special taxes . 
  the social security [ is capped at the income of 3,425.70 euros/month . 
  ] ( http://www.seg-social.es/internet_1/trabajadores/cotizacionrecaudaci10777/basesytiposdecotiza36537/index.htm ) you do n't pay social security for any income over that . 
  and the social security is a flat 28.7 % as you can see in my link . 
  the highest effective taxes in spain are for the people earning arround 40,000 euros/year . 
  the system could be more progressive . 
  and the capital gains taxes are lower that the workers taxes . 
   a ) the taxes are too high for what people can afford right now.meaning you 'd have to lower them even more so that people can afford to pay them . 
  there is also the problem that the people wants health care , education , unemployment benefits ( 40 % of the jobless people do n't have those anyway ) , and retirement pensions . 
  and if we add debt interests to that spain does n't get enough income to pay that . 
  [ the effective tax revenue is 37.3 % of the gdp from a 33 % from 5 years ago ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_as_percentage_of_gdp ) . 
  i am not going to say that is too much pressure or the opposite . 
   b ) the government spends too much and you can not afford it , at least for the moment and the context we have now  i 'm really not familiar with the specifics of the spanish budget . 
  i can not go in specific details.essentially , more efficient government and less waste . 
  keep the gov paying for things that make sense to pay for . 
  you can check [ here . ] ( http://graficos.lainformacion.com/espana/en-que-gasta-espana_goknxnskes9pthknt1yds5 ) . 
  it 's the nation wide budget . 
  education and health care are handled by regional governments . 
  as you can see the budget is mostly retirement pensions , unemployment benefits , debt interests and the transference funds that are actually regional funds . 
  this budget does n't include the bank bailouts , they were 50 billions this last year . 
   spain was doing that and was borrowing too much ( due to low interest rates ) , hence the bubble and the deflation of the bubble back to real terms that followed . 
  the spanish private sector , the public sector was n't getting in debt . 
  [ the public debt went from 67.4 % to 36.3 % of the gdp in the bubble years ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=ds22a34krhq5p_#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=gd_pc_gdp&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:eu:non-eu&amp;idim=country:es&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=es&amp;dl=es&amp;ind=false )  would say that having to issue more debt and bail-out the banks added further debt , to the already existing one ** ( which was significant by itself ) . 
  ** i disagree with that . 
   then that would mean your unemployment figures are not true and they are much lower than it is actually reported . 
  spain had a registered unemployment of 8 % . 
  that was at the peak of our bubble when we were importing millions of workers to build millions of houses . 
   i do n't doubt that the black market has been increasing a lot in the past years in southern europe . 
  actually , it increased a lot in the period 1996-2007 . 
  now it 's smaller actually . 
  half of the real estate sector was black market : illegal immigrants , factories of construction materials that worked two extra hours every day without declaring anything and selling the products in the black markets , illegal houses everywhere ... or [ even hotels ] ( http://www.greenpeace.org/espana/es/trabajamos-en/defensa-de-los-oceanos/destruccion-a-toda-costa/algarrobico/ ) [ the inspections have located over 80,000 illegal houses in four years ] ( http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2012/06/20/andalucia/1340216475_742083.html ) : like nobody noticed that 80.000 houses ( actually way more ) were built illegally . 
  :d many people got rich with the illegal construction in the bubble , now the the people working in the black economy is barely surviving . 
   that 's because you 're importing more products.people buy goods that are produced elsewhere cheaper , and you 're transfering wealth from spain to , let 's say germany . 
  actually , the opposite we are importing less products due to the depressed demand . 
  [ the trade deficit fell a 28.3 % in 2012 ] ( http://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/idiomas/9/gobierno/news/2012/20121221_trade_balance.htm ) , and spain destroyed 600,000 jobs that year . 
   as unemployment rises , so does internal demand . 
  if more people would be looking to buy stuff , the companies would be hiring more people . 
  ** wtf ? 
  ** do you mean the opposite ? 
  how the hell the jobless will pay for the stuff ? 
   you fix the income inequality by having a progressive taxation system . 
  we have been told that we need to have a less progressive taxation system to atract investment and * talent * . 
  i would like to have a more deffinitive answer for that .
