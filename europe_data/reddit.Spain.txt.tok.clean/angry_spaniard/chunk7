  if catalonia wants independence it will have to be illegally , for spain at least . 
  i do n't understand why i read europeans , but the point of the lowest immigration at poland is still true . 
  poland 0.0 % . 
  even romania has more and ~ ~ poland has a border with ukraine . ~ ~, 
   if they get independence would n't they face the same problems as scotland ? 
  how long it would take to do everything ? 
  this is different this independence would n't be agreed . 
  there would n't be any transition time negotiated with the spanish government . 
   is here something similar ? 
  there is nothing agreed , spain wo n't recognize any vote or declaration of independence if they do one . 
   and what about monetary system ? 
  what money would they use ? 
  or they are just hoping that eu would take them ... montenegro is using euros . 
  the situation would be weird because even if catalonia declares independence spain will keep saying that it 's illegal and that catalonia is not independent . 
  the scenario is different to scotland , there is n't a legal way of getting independence of spain . 
  if catalonia does it it would have to be illegally . 
  [ update ] ( http://www.abc.es/espana/20141014/abci-alminuto-consulta-cataluna-futuro-201410140141.html ) ( plebiscitary elections ), 
   either this reply is to the wrong person or i do n't quite understand what you are getting at . 
  replica was for you . 
  i am justifying the declarations with spanish internal politics . 
   i am simply saying that it is not true that spain will lead the eu in growth . 
  i know , and they also . 
  podemos ( new left party supporter of basic income , auditing the public debt , lowering retirement age to 60 years , 35 work week , forbidding lay-offs in profitable companies ... ) is growing very fast according to the polls . 
  the electorate in general is doing a very sharp turn to the left as the public services and the living standards deteriorate , and the conservative majority may be on risk at the 2015 elections . 
  i think that they will rule is with a grand coalition with the psoe that is closer to pp than to podemos and keep similar policies . 
  i would read the declarations with that context . 
  edit : they have an official subreddit / r/podemos /, 
  the only way is that is stop including them . 
  we can have weekly news about football and weather still . 
  and i also talked about fraud in the private sector , would be that also corruption ? 
  in that case valencia would be better : * good international airport * good communications with barcelona , basque country and madrid * has a stock market * center of the mediterranean corridor * important trade center also * a metropolitan area of two million of inhabitants ( cadiz lacks population . 
  * good universities . 
  * important existing logistic sector . 
  the big retail comerce : mercadona , el corte ingl\u00e9s , ikea ... have their logistic centers at valencia . 
  valencia has had also a massive real estate , construction and financial bubbles and there is massive amounts of empty office space/housing and the prices are like in cadiz very cheap . 
  the salaries are in free fall also , and the unemployment that was one of the lowest in the country is now above average . 
  disclaimer : i am from valencia . 
  edit : the point cadiz lacks everything for what you propose except a natural port and a highways to go to madrid or other mediterranean cities . 
  but that 's one of the reasons why is in this situation in the first place . 
  and the government is not going to put resources in developing the area the next decade . 
  who cares about that anyway ? 
   why not expand the port to a international trading port and encourage some trade brokerages . 
  i would say that the infrastructure of the port is very good and is working perfectly for all the international trade . 
  a massive amount of containers are moved . 
  you are talking about competing with gibraltar , amsterdam and london . 
  doing exactly what ? 
  and why in cadiz ? 
  reading your full comment i would understand that you are talking about making it a fiscal heaven . 
  am i misunderstanding something ? 
  if you are talking about brokers for stock-market . 
  spain has already 4 stock-markets and it 's probably too many , the one at valencia is dying and the one at bilbao is not exactly healthy and would die without the basque fiscal agreement . 
  stock markets are privatized anyway if somebody wants to create another at spain they can . 
  but i think that it 's more likely that one closes . 
   give the region fiscal autonomy and give gibraltar , amsterdam and london a run for their money . 
  basque country already has fiscal autonomy and catalonia asked for it at 2011 ( and after it was denied the ruling right wing nationalist coalition started to push for independence . 
  the only practical difference has been that the corporate tax is exactly 2 % lower than the rest of spain , following closely any reform at spain . 
  and they do n't participate in the national cohesion funds anymore , keeping for themselves like 5 % of the gdp that they would have to contribute if they had the same status as catalonia . 
  and this is a completely different situation , the locals would refuse any fiscal autonomy . 
  andalusia and specially cadiz are funding a big part of their budget from transfers from wealthier regions . 
  if they get fiscal autonomy how are they going to pay the schools and hospitals ? 
  it 's not like they have an economy to tax . 
  algeciras , province of cadiz . 
  the province with more unemployment of spain at the region with more unemployment . 
  it 's the only thing left , the shipyards and the fishing are dying . 
  ok , that and some farming and tobacco smuggling with gibraltar .

  [ from yesterday another user ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2inani/eu_youth_unemployment_rate_2013_age_25/cl40l8c?context=3 ) it seems to be popular to think that the southern europe economy is doing but the submerged economy makes the figures look bad . 
  and i could go back more . 
  edit : the unemployment grew 17 points in 6 years . 
  these jobs did n't move to the black market or anything they don ' exists !,
