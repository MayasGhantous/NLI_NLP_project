  i think that encouraging this type of behavior is a bad idea . 
   you 'd expect that the revenue of museums would actually go back to museums , but apparently not , and most of them are in a sorry state . 
  no , i would expect the revenue to go to bailout banks . 
  that 's the reason to raise the prices at least . 
   worker unions say that big retailers did not hire new people , but instead have the current staff to work more hours for the same salary . 
  and nobody is surprised . 
  and i see that the relation with turkey is completely toxic as usual .

  * [ santander hires rogrigo rato again ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/09/18/inenglish/1379504383_515308.html ) . 
  rodrigo rato was second deputy pm with jose maria aznar and minister of economy . 
  after that he ruled the imf until 2007 he left to be in the board of a lot of banks like the santander , he left that to rule madrid 's regional saving bank that was integrated in bankia under his direction . 
  he is currently under prosecution for posible crimes managing caja madrid and bankia . 
  ------------- ** analysis ** 1 . 
  the government is protecting them and furthermore the judge is also thinking in prosecuting some founders of the ruling party and high officers of the dictatorship like jos\u00e9 utrera molina ( father in law of the current justice minister ) and [ martin villa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rodolfo_mart%c3%adn_villa ) . 
  they are too powerful and connected to be handed to argentina . 
  you can see in the inaguration 's picture the previous conservative president , jose maria aznar ; \u00c1lvarez cascos ( public works minister ) , and alberto ruiz gallard\u00f3n ( then regional president , and justice minister now ) . 
  this has been a very long con , and the justice minister will cover everything as usual . 
  that 's less that the debt interest of one year . 
  this does n't solve any problem , the pension system ca n't work with only 16 millions of workers and 9 millions of retirees . 
  the reform is regresive and affects in the same way the people with $ 500 pensions and the ones with $ 2,500 . 
  juan carlos i ca n't step down because he would be prosecuted for all the corruption affairs . 
  he needs to die in office . 
  and the accident seems related to decisions make by the spanish govenment like santiago 's accident . 
  catalonia 's government is using shamelessly the accident to support the pro-independence campaign . 
  6 . thelocal has a [ better than expected article ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/20130919/my-dreams-will-all-come-true-in-spain ) about this , i want to remember this point :  chakib al-khayari , who runs the local rif association for human rights ( ardh ) , says 41 africans have died trying to enter ceuta and melilla since january last year , including 18 so far in 2013 . 
   i think it 's because people can pretty easily identify gb , france and germany as the three most influentially ( three largest gdps and population in the eu ) and [ italy is the 4th in those lists ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/member_state_of_the_european_union#list ) . 
  however , italy has been so fucked since the tangentopoli scandal that before this crisis even spain seemed more respectable and reliable . 
  did you know that that italy had bigger gdp and population than france 20 years ago ? 
  [ berlusconi 's age has been amazing ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/18805327 ) . 
   only zimbabwe and haiti had lower gdp growth than italy in the decade to 2010 . 
  in fact gdp per head in italy actually fell . 
  italy ** was ** big . 
  now it 's competing with spain in gdp per capita . 
  and we are n't doing very well . 
  fuck , i would say that spain is closer to italy . 
  we import a lot of their singers , writers and we also have a tv channel owned by berlusconi . 
  beside that we have a lot of history together . 
  is italy still a big european country ? 
  everybody forgets them in these lists . 
  : / after , that i would say that in the old days the french influence was bigger . 
  but , the british influence is the most important nowadays . 
  music , tv series , movies , [ british tourists ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8w72tqpri ) ; we * learn * brithish english , a lot of my friends have emigrated there and a lot of british retirees to spain , we are always messing with each other with gibraltar ... 
  they are creating jobs with a 27 % of unemployment . 
  they should be heroes . 
  can your government disallow citizens to come back to norway ? 
  some : quotes from the article : * this unemployed man with health problems who lives on a monthly pension of 240 euros decided that rather than sleep on the streets , he would prefer a prison cell . 
  * carlos garc\u00eda de mata is still an exceptional case * there are around 14,000 people behind bars in portugal . 
  in the last two years , during the worst of the crisis , this figure has grown by around 2,000 . 
  are there more crimes ? 
  * `` it 's not that prisoners would rather stay in jail , '' he says . 
  `` those are symbolic cases , but few and far between . 
  it 's the judges in charge of granting parole who see that the requirements are not being met [ possibility of reintegration into society , relatives who can support the inmate ... ] . 
  the crisis is removing means to care for inmates who could otherwise be released . 
  do you have a police that actually works and it 's enough for your country ? 
  eulex is supposed to leave in 2014 . 
  the echr backed the ilegalization of batasuna in spain . 
  nice try golden dawn . 
  that fits with what i said . 
  and i did n't talk about that but spain passed a law against eta supporters in politics also . 
  the law was used to prosecute almost any pro-independece basque party at some point . 
  however , most of the time the law was actually used correctly . 
  with some nasty situations like the town where most of the population was unable to seek public offices in lizarra and the conservative party won the elections with absolute majority and the 7.6 % of the votes.http : / / es.wikipedia.org/wiki/lizarza, 
  spain has cut the public r&d budget a 45.7 % since 2009 . 
  and the plan is to apply way more austerity to the r&d system . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/sep/10/science-policy-spain ) spain is going back to under 1 % of gdp in r&d soon from the peak of 1.4 % of the gdp . 
  government designed a new scam to hide the cuts in the official figures . 
  they increased the budget for zero interest credits and financial support for private companies and then not using the money . 
  the execution of the budget this year is going to be less than the 50 % of 2012 . 
  you can read about that [ here ] ( http://www.aacte.eu/wp/blog/2012/10/04/id-recortes-y-trampas-contables-en-espana-aumentos-en-francia/ ) , in spanish sorry . 
  i ca n't do jokes  _ <, 
  read the [ official press release with data . 
  ] ( http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/np788_en.pdf ) you can find raw data in xls files in the web . 
   european countries generally have got a pretty good impartial system like that . 
  we are talking about greece . 
  actually , it does in germany and other countries . 
  yep , but you ca n't seriously expect that the desesperated people living in poverty do n't try to improve their situation in almost any way that they have available . 
   entering a state illegally is not a penal offence ? 
  if it was a penal offense they would have the right to a lawyer and to stay in spain until the judgment finished . 
   once these guys get out , they will ring their buddies back home . 
  i do n't think so , the call effect needs an economy . 
  i do n't think that they plan to stay in spain . 
  spain had a negative migration balance of 162,390 in 2012 . http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/np788_en.pdf, 
  do you know that the total number of immigrants is near 5 millions ? 
  i do n't know where to find information about that . 
  and you ? 
  it 's not so easy .
