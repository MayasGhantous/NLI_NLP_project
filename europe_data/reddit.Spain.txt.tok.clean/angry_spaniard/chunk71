  the first two steps are already done . 
  the third is more complicated . 
  deport : to where ? 
  how much will it cost to send them to that country ? 
  the detention camps for illegal immigrants are crowded . 
  the one in ceuta has capacity for 512 persons and has 700 . 
  and the one in melilla where the last breaks are happening has 900 prisoners with only 480 places . 
  http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/09/17/actualidad/1379402066_665245.html edit : however , they have a big incentive to no colaborate with the police . 
  if the police is n't able to find where to send them they have to free them ffter a certain time that i ca n't find . 
  you ca n't retain permanently somebody for a non-penal offence indefinitely because the human rights . 
  most of them are able to speak english when they are n't in official acts . 
  but , they need to make clear that french is a language as important as english . 
  however , if that was true , politicians from other countries would use french . 
  if you tell catalonia to use spanish as the main language for official affairs they will be declaring independence the next month . 
  we are n't talking about english . 
  the politics are done in catalonian like the public tv i even watched some show that was originally in spanish dubed to catalonian . 
  maybe , that 's not a problem for your country , but it 's for spain . 
  in addition , catalonia 's governments have trying to get catalonian as an official language for the eu with the same status as spanish . 
  good luck with the next reich . 
  wait . 
  why is that important ? 
  i have my personal preferences , but i am trying to make a point independent of them . 
   it 's not an argument i 'm saying you have a very a hazy idea about what the gd supporters and the `` government supporters '' want i did n't talk about what government supporters want . 
  indeed , i said that i do n't understand what they want . 
  actually it 's the main point in that comment . 
  i can have my thoughts about golden dawn supporters . 
   maybe you should just stfu or get more informed cause we ai n't solving shit with people like that . 
  we are in reddit . 
  we are n't solving anything . 
  i do n't know why i bother to talk with somebody with this actitude . 
   40k beaurocrats and army or policemen get their wage slashed in half the rest distributed o the homeless . 
  they got their salaries slashed , but the money is not going to that kind of stuff . 
   then you should stop smoking weed for some small period of time . 
  i do n't have an answer to this * argument * . 
   there is no alternative , at least in the short run . 
  that 's a lie , simply . 
  maybe they are worse maybe ther 're better . 
  but , there is alternatives . 
  edit : and giving the goverment to people that ruined the country seems a extrange punishement . 
  why would the future rulers of greece stop being corrupt if you can rob a country cheat with your accounts , waste the money in silly events and bad investiments and be elected again ? 
  all of this without going to prison or anything like that . 
  yep , but i can understand more somebody that falls in that trick that the people who keep voting the people that ruined greece . 
  i mean they are desperate and traditional politicians failed them and somebody comes with a simple answer . 
  why are you discussing seriously the lies of this guy ? 
   but have n't things been getting somewhat better in greece , compared to the situation previously ? 
  no , the greek government has been saying that the thinks are getting betters . 
  but , i want to remember that the guys that cheated with the accounts got back to lead the government after the last elections . 
  but , in the real world : * record unemployment : [ 27.9 % ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1mc93j/greek_unemployment_rises_to_record_279_percent_in/ ) + * the recesion is still ongoing an the greeks are getting poorer year after year . 
  the recession of this year is smaller than a year ago . 
  ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/e4f7cbd2-0351-11e3-9a46-00144feab7de.html ) and there is the usual stuff the government keeps cutting health care , education , benefits , vacations and salaries of public servants , job securities ... and [ the humanitarian crisis ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/11/greece-humanitarian-crisis-eu ) . 
  edit : honestly , i can understand more the supporters or golden dawn than the supporters of the greek government . 
   dutch and their dialect . 
  do n't call their language dialect even if it 's also rotten west germanic , please . 
  that can be understood like you mean that it 's not a real language . 
  you forgot : * raising income taxes and vat * failed bid to the olympic games , building the infrastructure ** before ** getting the games . 
  * [ favour the former private telecomunications ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-13-621_en.htm ) monopoly filled with party members . 
  * restrict the self-generation to protect the energy companies . 
  are we forgetting something ? 
   defending it makes you an asshole . 
  you called my asshole enought . 
  now , or you spit in my face and call me whore or we stop with this . 
   i can tell you have not studied economy . 
  somalia has longer working hours , as do most african countries , but low productivity . 
  giving them more vacation as you want to do is stupid . 
  does somalia has a big supply of jobless people ? 
   it a ) increases the cost for the greek state . 
  since the greek state can not pay , it means for example that the estonians will pay for it b ) it lowers the productivity , which is already extremely low . 
  the greek government has reduced their salaries a 30 % already . 
  they can share the jobs and keep reducing the salaries . 
   i will complain . 
  i will never forget that you defend illegal fishing . 
  what sort of person does that . 
  i said that i do n't care about it . 
  i am not defending it . 
  ok , i am excusing it with the high unemployment and the lack of other option for the fishermans . 
  it harsh saying things like stop fishing and become an unemployed . 
   are you a criminal too ? 
  you catched me !, 
  :d  so that gives you the right to take the livelehood from africans ? 
  your illegal fishing is starving them . 
  why do you do that on purpose ? 
  does that gives you the right to fish the fishes out of the oceans for the rest of the world ? 
  tell , me , what gave you that right ? 
  do you know that there are countries that fish more than spain from japan to norway ? 
   i 'll bring that up in the future . 
  i know that you will . 
  even if only excused more than defended . 
   why do n't remove all the vacations then ? 
  now you are being silly . 
  not surprising . 
  but sure . 
  maybe , why should they have 4 weeks of vacations and no 3 or 5 ? 
  i would like to know . 
  i should try to catch some sleep . 
  i have to ~ ~ be lazy and commit crimes ~ ~ work tomorrow . 
   but , why is it wrong if the greeks work a lot ? 
  i am not an economist , i only see something wrong in that the country with the highest unemployment is the one with the longest working hours . 
   no , i am not . 
  you defended your fleet , your overbloated fleets illegal fishing !!!!, 
  ! your overbloated fishing fleet that the spaniards have refused to cut down on , for decades are not only fishing illegaly .
