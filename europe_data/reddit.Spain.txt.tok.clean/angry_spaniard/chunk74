  yes . 
  it 's like that . 
  they are discouraged in fact . 
  the regional governments ca n't tax anything that is taxed by the central government , that makes the things even better . 
  a regional government wants to give a service and creates a tax to pay it . 
  and now because the crisis the central government decides that wants to tax that . 
  oops !, 
  the regional government loses that income . 
  it has happened with a supermarket tax and with a banking services tax lately . 
  if the regional governments create a tax can lose that income in any moment . 
  except basque country and navarra . 
  equally , regional governments can give tax breaks ( only in the income tax ) , but they can give tax breaks for things that the central government is giving tax breaks already . 
  except the foral regions of course . 
   are the fiscal privileges granted by the central authority ? 
  [ they 're granted in the constitution . 
  ] ( http://www.taxautonomy.org/?page_id=2 )  spanish constitution , additional provision n \u00b0 1 : `` the constitution protects and respects the historic rights of the territories with `` fueros '' . 
  the current historic rights were agreen in the xix . 
  but , they are here in some form since the xii when castilla annexed basque country . 
  they collect their own taxes , and decide their corporate rate and they do n't contribute to the solidarity to poor regions they pay for the services and activities of the central government only . 
  and catalonia ca n't get the same status and that piss off catalonia a lot . 
   are n't regions ( wealthy ones ) self sustained fiscally ? 
  no , except basque country and navarra . 
  they depend of the assignation from the central govenment . 
  they can modify part of the income tax and the government promised to give the regional governments 50 % of the basic income tax that the government collects . 
  but , that 's not enought for the services that they manage . 
  they government has like $ 60 billions per year that assigns at will . 
   do n't local governments ( poor regions ) have the authority ( and responsibility ) to take economic measures ? 
  they can build roads , airports , r&d labs , schools , museums , modify the income tax , pay slighly more to the public servants , give some schoolarships ... 
  they have a certain power . 
  the power is different in every region . 
  catalonia and basque country have their own police , but everybody else uses the national police . 
   their administrative system , the autonomous region system seems pretty great from `` here '' ( a highly centralised country with with a highly politicised system of financing development ) it 's a mess with a lot of asymetry in the powers of the different regions , the budget allocation for the different regions depends of the relationship with the central government , fiscal privileges for basque country and navarra , constants fights with catalonia ... 
  yes . 
   japan 's seems to be doing its job ( to piss off china ) . 
  i loved this . 
  we use them to piss off the british in gibraltar . 
  ** spain ** * we did n't get the olympic games !!!, 
  yeah !, 
  finally , good news !,

  he is under prosecution right now . 
  he tried to funds to china while he was being prosecuted . 
  this is a good thing . 
  too many executives have done the same with viable companies sending thousands of persons to unemployment while they get money quickly . 
  the former businessmen union president is in jail already .

  and the previous major is under prosecution for corruption , surprisingly , he lost the last elections * [ a ruling party deputy goes to the pro-dictatorship memorial to do far right saludations ] ( http://www.lasexta.com/programas/mas-vale-tarde/noticias/chiquilleria-extiende-nngg-diputados_2013090300373.html ) it 's still better than average . 
  it 's not nice . 
  if we had a vote tomorrow i would n't vote . 
  if you check the polls the problem is the people like me that ca n't stand spain even if we feel spaniards . 
  in addition , i live in sweden and i do n't plan to come back anyway . 
   i have problems believing the government too , but do you really , really think `` independence '' is some kind of magic bullet ? 
  do you see my flag ? 
  do i seem pro-independence ? 
  the problem is that there is a spain 's project that i can respect . 
  i feel spaniard , my flag is spanish . 
  but , i am tired of this country . 
  ~ ~ millions ~ ~ billions , in english at least . 
  i expect that nobody supports again building infrastructure before there is a need for it . 
  from airports to the * caja magica . 
  maybe you should be more explicit . 
   this was going to be be in 7 years , if we have n't recovered by then i do n't see much difference ( we would be fucked anyway ) . 
  all the forecast for the next five years are very dark . 
  the most optimistic say that spain will have under 25 % of unemployment in 2018 . 
  and most of the waste needs to be done in those years . 
  we are fucked . 
  but , if spain keeps wasting money in unneeded constructions and expensive sports events spain is going to be more fucked than if the country changes its focus . 
  doing always the same and expecting different results is crazy . 
  check valencia in the last 15 years : america 's cup , urban formula 1 circuit , volvo ocena race , castell\u00f3 masters costa azahar , valencia open 500 . 
  2008 iaaf world indoor championships ... and now valencia is the region is having the deepest crisis . 
  valencia 15 years ago was a rich region . 
  andalusia and extremadura are still poorer . 
  but aragon , castilla leon , galicia are now richer than valencia . 
   besides , most of the money is already spent , them not giving it to us means we have wasted all that money . 
  wasted ? 
  pp 's illegal financing disagrees . 
  i hope that spain does n't commit this * error * again . 
  good luck finding usage to the * caja m\u00e1gica . 
  * have you think about what could have done with this money ? 
  there are better usages for this money . 
  people has been fooled in wasting a lot mone, 
  thanks ioc !, 
  spain should n't organize the olympic games in its current situation . 
  and , besides that spains needs to invest in something besides construction , tourism and sports events . 
  and the olympic games is these three things . 
  sorry , but it 's one billion . 
  edit : why there is people voting positive to this liar ? 
  there is a clear majority supporting the independence in catalonia . 
  there is no way that the spanish government will allow a referendum . 
  they have said that they send the police against the regional government before allowing that . 
  however , the president have said also that his party has n't been financed illegaly the last twenty years and if that 's true he did n't know anything . 
  i have problems believing my government . 
  that happened with the valencia c.f and was bailout by the regional government . 
  regional government that also asked for a bailout to the spanish government .
