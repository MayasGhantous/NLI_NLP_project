  ] ( http://www.expansion.com/2013/01/18/valencia/1358511187.html ) * [ valencian regional government ask for 2.3 billions ] ( http://www.eleconomista.es/economia/noticias/4571055/02/13/valencia-y-murcia-se-suman-al-fla-piden-2300-y-630-millones-al-fondo-de-rescate.html ) edit : real madrid is profitable . 
  if you want something bad about real madrid . 
  the club is probably involved in a corruption affair involving its president 's construction company . 
  but , there is a comment talking about this already . 
  second bailout before the olympic games . 
  the city is already unable to pay to providers . 
  and this is the lesson that the bailouts are teaching to the spanish politicians . 
  you do n't need to fix anything ; if you run out of money ask for more . 
  edit : [ more details ] ( http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2013/07/28/madrid/1375030320_476271.html ), 
  and we sell tobacco to gibraltar to smuggle it back to spain . 
   if the prices in spain are so high you ca n't live comfortably on 500 euros/month the problem is not with wages there is big differences in living cost between the different parts of spain . 
  $ 500/month in a regional city like pontevedra allows you to rent a room in old apartment without heating or ac . 
  not having internet and a cheap mobile phone . 
  for luxuries like computers or furniture you will need help from your parents or some saving from before . 
  is that comfortably ? 
  the same in madrid or barcelona would be near $ 800 . 
   yup , a ponzi scheme is unsustainable , i get that . 
    housing provided for by the government we don \u00b4 t have that . 
  and spain still has one of the better health care systems . 
   seems to me you 're worse off now that worse of than that ? 
   so you 're complaining that the current system is making everybody poorer and then you conclude that the system ca n't be changed because it would result in poverty are you blaming the education , the health care , the retirement pensions and social programs to fight the poverty for the current depression . 
  seriously ? 
  stockbreeding was thrown under the bus in favour or farming and fishing in spain . 
  spain is importing milk from france . 
  [ raw data . 
  ] ( http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/np784_en.pdf ) ** life expectancy ** life expectancy at birth decreased slightly , as compared with the previous year , standing at 82.2 years of age . 
  it reached 79.3 years of age in men , and 85.0 in women , remaining the same in men and decreasing 0.2 in women . 
  according to current mortality conditions , a person reaching the age of 65 years old could expect to live an average of 18.5 more years , in the case of men , and 22.4 more years in the case of women, 
   by that logic , austerity is actually helping raise life expectancy by putting an end to the problem . 
  the real argument here should be whether or not it does that . 
  not misleading headlines . 
  make the argument , do n't just use non sequiturs and misleading headlines . 
  let 's make my argument . 
  worse health care causes lower life expectancy : * the people is waiting an average of [ 100 days up from 76 in six months ] ( http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2013/08/25/actualidad/1377456668_285877.html ) for surgery in the public health care . 
  people is dying waiting . 
  this from less than 60 days 2 years ago . 
  * we are making the retirees pay part of the cost of the medication . 
  12.8 % of them say that they did n't buy some drugs because were too expensive . 
  before if you were over 65 years old all the drugs with medical prescription were free . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.publico.es/456724/el-12-de-los-pensionistas-no-puede-pagar-sus-medicamentos ) * hundreds of persons are losing their jobs . 
  the reduced number of profesionals have to take care of an aging population . 
  besides that , the new retirees in the health care are n't being replaced . 
   your pension system sure needs to be reformed , the whole green `` economic action '' could be cut and overall there could be small cuts on everything that 's not essential such as the justice and security system . 
  the pension system has been reformed already . 
  the retirement age is being raised to 67 . 
  and the government has removed the revision the pension with inflation . 
  but , the populagion is aging very quicky . 
  economic action includes : * infrastructure : lost 60 % of the budget already . 
  it 's mostly maintenance now . 
  * public r&d system : lost 40 % of the budget . . * the projects to fix certain sectors . 
  * the energy cartel corruption budget , but the effects in the private sector are like 10 times worse . 
  whatever , let 's go to the point . 
  it 's going to be sad . 
  with retirement pensions , unemployment benefits , education , health care , and debt interst you go over government income . 
  * and the life expectancy is falling after all the health care cuts . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.thinkspain.com/news-spain/23184/spains-life-expectancy-falls-by-between-two-and-three-months-for-the-first-time-ever ) * there are students in mandatory education in containers . 
  [ and with rats ] ( http://www.lasprovincias.es/20121017/comunitatvalenciana/comunitat/protesta-colegio-montserrat-barracones-201210171550.html ) * about the pensions . 
  the [ raw data ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ktzuy3y.jpg ) is probably the best . 
  at some point , the economy needs to be fixed . 
  it 's that or having millions without health care , education , pensions , house ( with 3 millions of empty houses ) ... 
  but nobody seems interested in that . 
   so while i make no arguments against paying taxes to pay for the police or the courts or perhaps even the schools and the hospitals , it 's foolish to think that this is good on its own and that this is free and that there are no alternatives , that if it was n't for the government nobody would have means of transportation or housing or health insurance . 
  the poor would n't have access . 
  not everybody . 
  that titular . 
  you 're going to kill the debate . 
  and it 's important . 
  we are letting people die because austerity . 
  what kind of society does that ? 
   it will cost a bit , every german for example will have to pay the equivalent of 1-2 hours wage , so the funding gaps in the struggling countries will be closed . 
  i respectfully disagree , the corrupt governments are still in office . 
  the spanish government is still seeking the olympic games while the party is being prosecuted for illegal financing . 
   but if we would chose not to bail them out , their purchasing power would vanish and our exports go nowhere . 
  we are important to them because they are important to us ; it 's an interdependent system . 
  if the governments are n't bailout , then they will have to care about the economy , because the only way of getting more money to steal will be from the local economy . 
  now , they have bailout money to steal . 
  why should they care about the economy ? 
   actually bailouts are one of the most efficient expenditures a government can make . 
  only if the economy is fixed and that 's not happening . 
  i also think that the bailouts are an extremely bad idea . 
  for my country at least . 
  can you explain why are we wrong ? 
  you should submit this . 
  because , it 's the right-wing flag . 
  :-p for me the official flag is a symbol of the tradiotional spain that i dislike and is destroying my country . 
   it seems you 're not being austere enough , how difficult is it to sharply cut public spending and also public revenue ? 
   let 's see the [ spanish budget ] ( http://graficos.lainformacion.com/espana/en-que-gasta-espana_goknxnskes9pthknt1yds5 ) . 
  where would you apply the austerity ? 
  education and health care are in transferences to other administrations . 
  except the scholarships , and some other stuff that has enjoyed a lot of austerity . 
   it 's not a free lunch you get from the government , you know , for them to spend money on you they must first tax money from you , at the end of the day you 're just giving away money for those who lobby the best and for those who work within the system . 
  you also get public education , health care , retirement pension , public transport , citizen security ... 
  i know that my government is openly corrupt , but you ca n't prentend that we do n't get anything from the government . 
  emigration . 
  i am tired of zombies . 
  it 's too much . 
   it 's either austerity or bankruptcy . 
  it can be also austerity and bankruptcy . 
  i say this as a citizen of a country that has fired teachers , but it 's seeking the olympic games .
