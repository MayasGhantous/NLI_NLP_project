  andorra only loves our rich people and the tobacco smuggling . 
  http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/09/03/inenglish/1378212605_738724.html  but while claims fell this time , the number of people signed up as contributors to the social security system declined by 99,069 from july to 16.327 million . 
  however , that was still the best performance since 2005 when the ranks of social security affiliates declined by 87,556 . 
  edit : you need to go back to 2002 to see a similar amount of employed people . 
  http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/epa_tabla_en.htm what is falling is the registered unemployment and number of workers ** at the same time . 
  ** spain : ** * the budget and the gdp figures .

  20 years old , but i loved it . 
  i do n't like most of what 's published in spain lately . 
  but , 20 years ago there were a lot of interesting books, 
  i am more resentful against the other spaniards and my government . 
  the only thing that the other countries are doing that i do n't like is supporting our corrupt government . 
  saying that germany trust the spanish government to solve the situation , and giving them the bailout of course , that 's the worse . 
  that probably saved the government . 
  but , the corrupt government is here because spaniards elected them . 
  me too . 
  he is lying to trick the fools , he will open the mine . 
  debt . 
  and the government plans to cut education , health care and r&d and sell public services and infrastructures to their cronies . 
  spain has a corrupt government . 
  deal with it . 
  shit . 
   i however disliked steinbr\u00fcck 's total opposition to an intervention in syria , and him going so far as saying that he would make sure no german military officers would be even slightly involved . 
  but , that 's politics . 
  he has to seem solid . 
  that does n't mean anything . 
  it 's not a serious theory . 
  i am only pissed off with whoever supports my government or any corrupt government . 
  * ruling party members keep doing far right declarations .

  ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/08/30/inenglish/1377875386_327683.html ), 
  i think that the obvious conclusion is that eu wants that spain keeps the current corrupt government . 
  eu gave a bailout to a government under prosecution for corruption . 
  and government is missusing it , as expected . 
  i love to hear how they trust our government to solve the situation . 
  and spain is n't the only case . 
  germany/merkel supported new democracy in the greek elections . 
  the guys who rigged the accounts , organized the most corrupt olympic games , bought all that crazy militar equipment , filled the public administration with their cronies . 
  i suppose that everything was better than a left wing government . 
  why ? 
  let act the natural selection . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8w72tqpri ), 
   spain is not australia and does not have australia \u00b4 s natural resources nor is australia ( of the many atrocious mining billionaires ) quite utopia . 
  what do you want to tell me with that ? 
   and of course what they promise is what they will ( or even are able to ) achieve , if only somebody will put then in power . 
  righhhhtttt . 
  my point is that we have the socialist party doing the same as the dictatorship did . 
  and a new left wing movement fighting for the sames things that they fighted 40 ago against them . 
  hint : the socialists are the pigs . 
  i read it . 
  it 's applicable to andalusia . 
  it has been ruled by the socialist workers party the last 30 years . 
  and the socialist union has been very powerful during those years the party and the union have been moving to the right and have been involved in more and more corruption . 
  after , 30 years the income inequalilty is the same as before . 
  the farm land is owned by the same families . 
  they even declared [ favourite daughter of andalusia to the duchess of alba in 2006 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hijo_predilecto_de_andaluc%c3%ada ) . 
  a woman that is the biggest landowner of the region , has never worked , employs thousands of persons in medieval conditions . 
  they promised to fix the andalusia of * se\u00f1oritos * ( aristocracy ) and * jornaleros * ( day laborers ) , but they joined the * se\u00f1oritos * when they got the power . 
  and now we have again a left wing movement with an union promising to fight the poverty , distribute the farm land between the day laborers and universal education and health care . 
  yeah , i would say even more . 
  i think often that the history is cyclic . 
  they had profits still , a 32 % less . 
  the european branch ( belgium and spain ) profit was a 32 % lower . 
  http://cincodias.com/cincodias/2012/08/30/empresas/1346493536_850215.html they do n't separate the profits per branches in your link . 
  i ca n't find detailed data in any language . 
  but this does n't matter anyway . 
  do you think that carrefour will be concerned about the increasing social unrest in spain ? 
   if people steal school supplies , they 'll simply stop stocking school supplies they do n't plan to solve the the problem stealing in carrefour . 
   why not ? 
  there are successful co-ops in all those fields . 
  heck , marinaleda 's housing policy is a particularly successful example !, 
  and there is still poverty . 
  i think that you are missing the point . 
  they are n't able to get farm land or any job to the jobless members of the union . 
  they had a big fight for the control of the unused public real state * las turquillas * , that was used by the army in the past to breed horses . 
  and they lost . 
  they are to get somebody more powerful than them to solve the situation . 
  those housing projects were financed by the municipality with loans from the regional government that are being paid with the rent . 
   well , and how did the mondrag\u00f3n group get started ? 
  with the support of the local branch of the catholic church and middle class families with connections with basque nationalism ( illegal at that time ) . 
  without them , mondragon would n't have the initial capital for the training and starting the first companies . 
  besides that , it 's almost impossible to join the energy and water supply markets due to the rampant corruption in these sectors . 
  the only independent company is * som energia * . 
  and they are a co-op that survives thanks to the pro-indepence movement in catalonia . 
   who is going to have first pick of that stuff ? 
  who is going to hear first to be on this place at this hour when they redistribute the loot ? 
  friends and neighbours ? 
  who decides who gets what ? 
  that is my point . 
  hmm . 
  knowing the leader and the previous affairs ? 
  they will go a working class neighbourhood with the press , organize a very populist act and will give the stuff to whoever ask for it . 
  we are talking about $ 2.000 of school materials . 
  it 's simbolic more than a real loot . 
  they are trying to get publicity for the union and the cause more than trying to provide . 
   edit - and wtf occupying farm land has to do with government not providing school materials to children in need , i have no idea . 
  the aim of the union is the poverty , not only its effects . 
  most of the union members are farm workers and a lot of them are unemployed or day laborers who work only 2 or 3 months a year . 
  that was part of a failed campaign for getting farm land for the unemployed members of the union .
