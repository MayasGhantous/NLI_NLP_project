  it would be the same in spain , the constitution is similar in this . 
  if the politicians want to hire and fire freely the protected public servants ( * funcionarios * ) they have to change the constitution . 
  that was done to protect the key employees ( police , justice , education ) from political presure . 
  to fire a funcionario you need to go to a special court . 
  however , not all the public servants are * funcionarios . 
  * the * laboral * public servants that are hired with standard labour laws can be fired at the will of the politicians . 
  the research center where the government concentrated all the r&d projects to fight against cancer is going to fire 28 permantent employees and do n't renew or replace 36 temporary workers . 
   you are getting more citation needed . 
   only . 
  nice to live in your world where you are apparently expecting them to pay 100 % . our roads are usually paid by our own tax money , not by anyone elses . 
  you were talking like the eu paid 100 % of the roads . 
   i think that it should be focused on research , environment and stuff . 
  so yes , perhaps we can pay for our own roads then , but so should you . 
  the countries can choose the usage of the eu funds . 
  if you read the document sweden assigns most of the money to research , environment , it , biotechnology , training ...  i could say the same to you , but you guys just get your roads paid for by eu tax money . 
  why have n't you built your own roads ? 
  i mean , you have been on the receiving end since 86 , have n't you ? 
  25 years , it is a lot of time . 
  not all the roads have been paid by the eu . 
  in addition , eu only pay until 50 % of the costs and the eu analyses the projects and has rejected funds for some of the projects that the spanish government has proposed like the crazy pyrenees tunnel , that it 's also rejected by france anyway . 
  but then the train that spain built to huesca is like a ghost train . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.publico.es/espana/363473/las-estaciones-fantasma-del-ave ) edit : huesca is pobably the smallest city with high velocity train . 
  the context of the proposal is that the spanish government wants a train connection to france without through catalonia or basque country due to the increasing risk of independence . 
  the proposal pissed of more catalonia of course , because the catalan connection is very shitty and the spanish government has rejected to improve it . 
  the eu is giving funds also to sweden . 
  you do n't expend most of them to build roads . 
   during 2007 -- 2013 , sweden takes part in 22 structural fund programmes : eight regional structural fund programmes and 13 territorial co-operation programmes that are financed by the european regional development fund . 
  these are supplemented by the european social fund programme . 
   more than sek eight billion in eu funding will be channelled through the eight regional structural fund programmes and sek six billion through the social fund programme , funds that are distributed to projects in sweden . 
   sek 10 billion are chanelled through the territorial co-operation programmes where funds are shared with other participating countries . 
  [ source ] ( http://publikationer.tillvaxtverket.se/productview.aspx?id=1499 ) sweden gets less funds that gives , but that was expected . 
  sweden does n't waste the money in roads , but that 's probably good . 
  if you read the high level document seems like a better usage than building unneeded things . 
  but , if you want more roads complain to your government . 
  i think that most of the people is against , but they do n't care actually . 
  a small minority likes it and they watch it when they are on holidays in spain . 
  if somebody is going to do a boycott , i would prefer one against the rampant corruption . 
  just saying . 
  what about the [ toro de la vega ] ( https://www.google.se/search?q=toro+de+la+vega&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=5rp&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us:official&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=jmefuvbjecag4gtrjid4bg&amp;ved=0ccoqsaq&amp;biw=1118&amp;bih=677 ) ? 
   the current `` crisis '' is intented to serve as a strong reminder for people that not caring about corruption and waste has a high cost to society . 
  people will , hopefully , remember it for generations and teach their children to be more watchful when politicians waste money or are corrupt . 
  not just try to get a share and act as if they did n't know . 
  i do n't think that is working . 
  after 4 years of recession we gave the second biggest majority of our history to a party under prosecution for illegal financing . 
  the party that built most of those airports . 
   its seems a very common believe in the southern countries , that the northern countries are successful due to some weird coincidence or divine gift . 
  nobody believes that . 
   peopl ein the north worked for it , not only at their jobs but also by contributing in a positive way to society . 
  that is possible in the south too . 
  yep . 
  but you are n't answering to my point . 
  there is n't any official effort to fix the greece society and government . 
  and , if we talk about spain the damage that this government is doing to spain is n't going to be fixed in less than 20 years and that if we started now . 
   the point of demanding the neccessary structural reforms is not punishment are structural reforms demanded actually ? 
  i only read about firing public servants ( not necessarily the ones that got the job illegally ) , a more regressive tax system and selling public assets . 
  greece is less competitive than five years ago . 
  greece is n't a developed country anymore . 
  and still we are asking more time for this path . 
  yep , greece is not an exporter of beef . 
   efforts of making the country more efficient what efforts ? 
  whatever , if there is any effort it 's not working . 
  you can get a fine in spain for picking things from the garbage . 
  the private monopolies/concesions that manage the garbage have the right to any profitable business involved . 
  this way he can skip defending their interests . 
  i feel related . 
  i want to remember [ what i posted ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1l1uao/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week/cbuyp1x ) the last week . 
  * entrepreneurs * in most of the cases . 
   just to clarify - do you see the problem as employers exploiting workers ? 
  that happens and it 's a problem . 
  what do you think about that ? 
   did you consider becoming an entrepreneur or an employer yourself in that case ? 
  some of my friends decided to start their own business . 
  only one self-employed web developer is still working for himself not living with their parents at this moment . 
  and he is n't exactly living the dream . 
  and the others lost a lot of money . 
  and everybody ca n't become an entrepreneur . 
  people without experience , contacts , who do n't understand how the game is played . 
  they are fooled by everybody , do n't get paid by the clients , the providers cheat with their services ... people just out of college who has never worked is not ready to start a business . 
  opinions <  facts, 
   the government losing credibility for submitting to a criminal ? 
  this . 
  if italy wants to get a better economy they need to fix the political framework , and stopping the submission to criminals is a good start . 
  there is something worse that a country without a government , a country in the hands of criminals . 
   a ) proof . 
  b ) it is not to big to take care of roma children when their parents and their community chooses not to . 
  that is good , children need to be taken care of . 
  and , they are not assimilating anyway . 
  as i said - how can it be worse . 
  ok , try it . 
  it 's too late to keep this discussion . 
  most of them are of romanian citizenship . 
   we owe it to the romas children to remove them if their parents are so bad . 
  ok , good luck with the lateral effects . 
   also , they live on welfare most of them . 
  then , you have more leverage than others countries use it wisefully . 
  you did n't passed laws that you ca n't enforece regulating the core of your society . 
  i think that you should read this history : [ esquilache riots ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/esquilache_riots ) . 
  it 's an important point in spanish history when the government tried to regulate the clothing for security reasons in the middle of an economic crisis . 
  at the beggining nobody cared about the law . 
  but then the government tried to enforce the law .
