  dozens of persons died and the law was n't enforced anymore . 
  it 's studied carefully in high school in spain . 
   i do n't know what to call them apart from race , but if you have a better name , i am happy . 
  the right definition for the roma is [ ethnic grout ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_group ) . 
  btw , if the confrontation is too big the integration/assimilation slows down , not the opposite . 
   hundreds of people do not have the right to stop an eviction they do n't have the right , but they have the power . 
  and the power is 99 % of the law  they have a choice , yet you are apologetic for horrible bad parenting i am only saying that you can expect problems . 
  the world is n't as simple as you seem to think . 
   no black in the us can ever , ever , succeed , the black people have the highest crime rate and the lowest income in the us . 
  this problems are n't solved in one generation . 
   i 'd like for you to give me a detailed explanation for each and every category that you deem are not capabable of talking full responsibility for their actions ? 
  i think that you do n't see my point . 
  btw , i am not talking about races anywhere . 
  you are n't used to this kind of situations . 
  your are lucky . 
  does your government has passed laws that ca n't enforce and then tried to enforce them ? 
  it 's an interesting situation always . 
  specially when we are talking about things more important than copyright laws . 
   no , but what we usually do , the police of course . 
  it is quite common , and i am sure they do the same in spain some times . 
  other times the authorities did deals with the * community leaders * . 
   when the social authorithies deem the parent as unfit ( which parents who do not send their children to school can be deemed to be ) the children get removed by the authorithies and the police . 
  but , sometimes enforcing the law is too difficult and the government gives up in that . 
  [ hundreds of persons can stop an eviction ] ( http://www.tetuanmadrid.com/cientos-congregados-detienen-desahucio-calle-naranjo-tetuan-madrid/ ) , whatever the law says . 
  and this was normal spanish people . 
  you can expect that a community stay together and fights if you try to break them . 
  and the worst thing for any society is trying to stole their children . 
  from their pov : you are trying that their children stop being one of them after surviving hundreds of years of prosecution . 
  i would be surprised if everything goes fine . 
   i think we should do something . 
  remove the children if they do not go to school are you ready to use the army ? 
   it is their fault , not ours . 
  that does n't matter . 
  you have the problem anyway . 
  you will have to deal with it anyway . 
   well , they have no problem accepting benefits , but they do not want to contribute . 
  are you saying that grown romas ca n't make that analyses ? 
  of course they can . 
  you can try to remove the benefits if they do n't sent the children to school , but some of them would n't sent they children to school anyway . 
   they just choose not to integrate . 
  what would happen if they tried to integrate in their home countries ? 
  i have seen demostrations in spain because a regional government was distributing the gipsies in all the public schools and catholic schools paid by the government in a municipality and the parents of the catholic school demostrated against that . 
  an spain has been more tolerant than other countries . 
  btw , this kind of thing work . 
   well , in a modern society there are n't roles for people who ca n't read , treat women like shit , steal and live on welfare . 
  they are of course welcome to school , or other forms of work education , but the fact is , they do not want to . 
  they were n't living in welfare in their previous countries . 
  and , you would n't like to think about their previous lifes . 
  but , you are going to have to deal with them anyway . 
  if you do n't do nothing you will have the problem in the next century still . 
   they should , if they are not complete assholes , have an interest in integration they have lived in societies that did n't want them to be integrated . 
  and they have been living beside the society hundreds of years and became part of their culture . 
  they ca n't think that anything else is posible . 
   ok , we give them free housing , health care , schools and welfare benefits that 's the swedish approach to every misfits . 
  spain does n't offer that to anybody , with certain exceptions . 
  and that exception have been the biggest failures like * las tres mil viviendas * ( three thousand homes ) the southern spain capital of the drug dealing . 
  the problem is that they have been raised this way and they do n't know anything better , and they are raising their children in the same way . 
  you are n't going to break the chain with welfare . 
  the key is the education , finding a role for them in the society that can be acceptable for everybody for the current generation , and education ( and your are being lucky if the first native generation gets basic education ) . 
  i always talk about spain , but this is something where my country has been more successful than the others .

  however , they are still important in the drug dealing . 
  i included a gunfight between gipsy drug dealers where a gipsy girl died in my weekly news . 
  they have higher poverty rates , complete less often the basic education , have a higher crime rate ... you should n't expect it to solve by itself or quickly in 5 to ten years . 
  a peaceful solution will require a constant integration policy and one hundred years or more . 
  the * patriarca * in my hometown had a market stall where his family sells chinese falsifications of fancy brands . 
  it 's only an example . 
  the relation of spain with his roma people is complicated , but there is a certain peace . 
  however , this has been broken with eastern europe migration of the later years . 
  [ picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wlrlo7h.jpg ) translation : entry without warning is prohibited to dogs and romanians . 
  otherwise they will have to run . 
  this was in the entrance of a business and it 's using romanian as codeword for eastern europe gipsy . 
  it 's very common in spain . 
  this way you do n't upset the local roma . 
  i understand , your feelings about it . 
  having new totally wild roma again now that we were starting to be ok with the ones that we had ... 
  it has not been popular in spain either . 
  however , my point is `` you can intergrate any ethnic group if you work hard in it '' . 
  but , maybe you do n't want to do that . 
   with a much less corrupt and more efficient government than before . 
  why ? 
  wishful thinking ? 
  that 's the extra-official position of his party actually . 
  the official position is `` we do n't talk about the past we should focus in the future ' . 
  he is member of the conservative people 's party the successor party of the dictatorship single party . 
  the party was founded by a former minister of the dictatorship , and most of the initial members where members of the dictatorship single party . 
  they are ruling the country with more than half of the members of the parlament . 
  the connections with the far right and the dictatoship are a common source of news in spain . 
  * [ they recently voted against a mocion denouncing the dictatorship . ],

  you need to understand that spain is n't germany . 
  they won the war and they won the transition to democracy in spain .
