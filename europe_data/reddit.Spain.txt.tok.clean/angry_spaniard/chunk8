  the black economy has reduced also its size , even if less than the legal economy . 
  if we check the data in other way [ you are number one !, 
  ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/file:employment_rate,_age_group_15%e2%80%9364,_2013_%28%25%29_yb15.png ), 
  i think that you should look at [ employment rate over the work-age people ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/6/66/employment_rate%2c_age_group_15%e2%80%9364%2c_2013_%28%25%29_yb15.png ) ( 15-64 ) sweden has the highest rate of working people , not austria . 
  and croatia has the lowest no greece -- 15 years is not work-age at spain but 65 is , but whatever . 
  the underground economy had more activity when spain had 8 % unemployment than now . 
  stop denying the unemployment . 
  why do you that ? 
  what did you study ? 
  moving is always good advice with spain . 
  you should start looking for jobs abroad from spain , if you can . 
  edit : if you move with a job and an employer that can help you to find a place and do the paperwork is always better . 
  if they fulfil the requirements yes . 
  they do n't do right now . 
  [ yes , minister ] ( http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/yes,_minister#episode_five:_the_writing_on_the_wall )  sir humphrey : minister , britain has had the same foreign policy objective for at least the last five hundred years : to create a disunited europe . 
  in that cause we have fought with the dutch against the spanish , with the germans against the french , with the french and italians against the germans , and with the french against the germans and italians . 
  divide and rule , you see . 
  why should we change now , when it 's worked so well ? 
  i am only linking a video with the leader of podemos saying that ch\u00e1vez is his referent to the guy that says that ch\u00e1vez is not his referent . 
  the discourse is not let 's become venezuela . 
  remember , there is many people that thinks that we have gone to far with the liberalization of the labour market , the regressive tax system , the raising of retirement age , the private monopolies , education cuts , health care cuts , welfare cuts ... and that spain should move in an opposite direction , and this is the reference party at this moment for the people that wants a left-leaning government . 
  edit : i am one of this people actually even if i plan to vote to the social-democratic nationalists from valencia ( even if i am not nationalist ) , but i perfer them to support podemos to pp or psoe . 
  i expect that pp and psoe will rule in coalition probably after 2015 . 
  [ watch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyjlr2l39r0 ), 
  if a supermarket employed somebody under 16 years old at spain his administrator would be sent to prison and their parents would lose the custody . 
  social security is a fee for getting a pension . 
  anybody working has to pay legally at least for the minimum pension . 
  these years have been introduced a lot of [ aggressive discounts ] ( http://www.infoautonomos.com/informacion-al-dia/seguridad-social/bonificaciones-en-el-reta/ ) that still generate right to the minimum pension ( an error if the government does n't put the money , it 's generating a big hole in the system ) . 
  the normal minimum payment would be 255 euros . 
  with discounts to 50 euros for young people ( the women are young until 35 , men until 30 ) , disabled people , ceuta and melilla ...  bureaucratic red tape and additional fees it depends is the business is in a regulated sector or no . 
  as a minimum sales tax declaration every 3 months . 
  and [ income tax retention ] ( http://www.infoautonomos.com/informacion-al-dia/fiscalidad/retenciones-irpf-profesionales-autonomos/ ) ( 21 % ) . 
  if you move to a regulated sector from taxis to legal services it grows . 
  if you create a company with limited responsibility the paperwork grows and social security also . 
  stop stealing !, 
  return that flag . 
  what have you heard ? 
  i have heard many interesting interpretations about how the system works from foreigners . 
  i was earning that when i left spain and i was n't at madrid , barcelona or basque country . 
   it 's amazing how they are in economic distress but they could afford yachts , travel , etc. 
  i keep reading spain is in economic turmoil , but i see so many spanish tourists in ny . 
  different people : spain has 24.3 % of unemployment and the same income per capita than italy . 
  spain has * big * middle class ( maybe half of the population ) and [ 2.5 millions of people that recurred to the catholic church for food and clothing in 2013 ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/09/30/inenglish/1412093817_098897.html ) . 
  and a similar number of jobless actively seeking work without getting benefits . 
  and many households with an average income per capita below minimum wage ( i think that like 30 % ) . 
  you do n't see this amounts of poor people ( jobless and working ) anywhere else in western europe , except portugal , but our middle class has good living standards long vacations , savings and expects to get a generous pension from the state when they retire ( a minimum wage worker during 40 years would have a pension of $ 8.404,20 per year a doctor of the public health care would have $ 35.762,86 ) . 
  edit : i am re-reading your comment and it sound even more stupid . 
  are you thinking that the officially jobless people is the one buying fucking yatch !? 
  i should n't have answered . 
   that is very impressive . 
  especially the part about leading an airline . 
  why ? 
  he made some connections during his time as minister ( industry first , then foreign affairs and later r&d ) and he was n't happy leading the catalan branch of the pp as a minority party in the opposition . 
  edit : in 2013 he moved to be the ceo of the construction company [ ohl ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/obrasc%c3%b3n_huarte_lain ), 
  i also have a full-beard . 
  not actually , the benefits caught austerity . 
  and that 's as deadly than ebola . 
  yes , i know . 
  i am giving the data counting everybody in the age range . 
  i thought that it was clear . 
  edit : i was remembering that that does n't mean that half of the people in the age range is jobless . 
  kurds are muslim . 
  [ 25.9 % of the spaniards between 15 and 29 either study or work ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.elmundo.es%2fespana%2f2014%2f09%2f09%2f540e1531268e3e5d7b8b456f.html&amp;edit-text= ) . 
  but , if you consider active the ones actively seeking employment only 7 % are inactive , below eu average . 
  edit : i am not saying that students are unemployed . 
  i am giving figures with more complete demographics . 
  that 's too slow [ josep pique ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/josep_piqu%c3%a9_i_camps ) went way quicker . 
  * in the 70s catalan nationalist and communist . 
  * 80s catalan nationalist and conservative . 
  * 1996-2007 : spanish right wing pp ( founded by a dictatorship minister ) * 2007-now : directs the low fare airline vueling . 
  [ spain has been condemned in the past ] ( http://www.basquepeaceprocess.info/?p=5577 ) for the same and government does n't plan to change how the police works . 
  torture is illegal at spain . 
  what legal changes are needed ? 
  government and public prosecutors refuse to judge these cases . 
  and if a judge condemns anybody , [ government gives a pardon ] ( http://www.bulletsandballots.com/2012/02/spanish-court-pardons-police-offices.html ) the tolerance of the torture is not total , but the police tortures people once in a while . 
  specially suspected eta members . 
  i do n't understand why british conservatives want to withdraw from this court , if the sanctions are mostly symbolic does n't matter how many time you are condemned for the same ( third time for spain ) . 
  edit : the title should say compensations no fines . 
  ana mato said that she had no notice of the jaguar that francisco correa , head of the g\u00fcrtel corruption network ( g\u00fcrtel is the german translation for the spanish correa ) ; gifted to her , by then , husband . 
  [ link , in spanish ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/03/12/espana/1236857116.html ) the car was seen by the police at the garage of the house were they lived together . 
  her ex-husband was the mayor of pozuelos and was involved in dozens of illegalities during his term . 
  i edited , my original comment , but it 's almost a translation of quote : * `` un jaguar en mi garaje ? 
  i will go on vacation . 
  ok , my opinion of my government and country could n't get worse anyway . 
  inside spain . 
  the woman that said : * `` a jaguar ( car ) in my garage ? 
  i did n't notice !, 
  his party has financed illegally during 20 years , has retrieved many envelops with money during many years . 
  he is has a historic track of backing for office openly corrupt people like carlos fabra or francisco camps . 
  never his responsibility . 
  and got his property register position irregularly in my opinion , the same year than his brother , less than a year than finishing his degree in laws . 
  and his father was a judge that let free recently some dictatorship high officers in a corruption affair . 
  i do n't . 
  but i ca n't talk for everybody , openly corrupt politicians have been re-elected with absolute majorities while they were tried . 
  the government is not offering any cut on the money to the regional government . 
  corrupci\u00f3n canar\u00eda would have not oppose if they were getting money . 
  they are not retarded they are defending their interests . 
  are there articles on reddit ? 
  fuck , this changes everything !, 
  she was put out of the royal family to avoid that question .
