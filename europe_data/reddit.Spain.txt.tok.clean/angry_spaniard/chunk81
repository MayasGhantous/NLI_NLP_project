  you are giving a bailout and asking to fix our problems with * austerity * to the people who ruined our countries . 
  it 's foolish or something worse . 
   and some reform is being done , better then letting things continue as usual . 
  the change is not for the better and it 's being done by the people who destroyed the countries . 
  it 's a change to protect the corruption and their position when we need the opposite . 
  edit : the spaniards are the ones who elected a party under prosecution for illegal financing , corruption , nepotism ... with the second biggest majority of our history . 
  we should be blamed for that . 
  i want to blame also the foreign governments that give them money and support . 
  i am only refuting your point you said  this way at least some reform to the corrupt political establishment can be done . 
  and that 's not happening . 
  greek government is the hands of the corrupt people that organized the olympic games and forged the accounts . 
  most of the members of the spanish government are involved in the biggest corruption affair of our history . 
  are you asking this people to do reforms ? 
  that 's foolish . 
  what 's the reason of the bailouts ? 
  if it 's reforming southern europe they are obviously failing . 
  i would say saving the euro and the german and french banks . 
  it 's the only that they have accomplished at least . 
  and then the government privatizes the corruption . 
  my regional government put all the cronies in joint ventures with private companies . 
  the institute of the public housing is the best example . 
  the eu talked about them already in 2009 . 
  [ link ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-09-1469_en.htm?locale=en ) they are n't public servants and when we reduced the number of public servants a 10 % they were n't affected . 
  all of them keep their jobs . 
  i expect that this will be similar in greece . 
  however , we reduced the number of school teachers a 4.5 % whereas the number of students has incrased a 3.6 % . 
  and the public r&d has lost 10 % of its employees and 30 % of the interns . 
  the figures for the biggest organization are 10.4 % for employees and and 29.6 % for interns . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.mastermas.com/noticias/html/n12546_f02082013.html ) i ca n't find the overall data . 
  they are asking for a reduction of the public sector size , not for a reduction of the corruption . 
  and they are getting that . 
   this way at least some reform to the corrupt political establishment can be done . 
  they have n't requested that . 
  a food bank is n't going to solve the fact that they are losing their home this month . 
  and they do n't have water in * their * house . 
   for the taxpayer , the institution is orders of magnitude more expensive than welfare support . 
  yes . 
  however , the institution is something temporary , before going to the well-off family . 
   pungent stench here . 
  either the mother keeps some of the story for herself , or enter the andalusian version of this : do you need to a foreign country for an example ? 
  something similar happened in spain for getting kids to well-off families until yesterday ( 20 years ago ) . 
  [ home page ] ( http://plataformacausabebesrobados.hostinazo.com/ ) of the affected association . 
   is it truly cheaper to run proper orphanages in such a large country ? 
  emphasis on proper ? 
  it 's something temporary before giving them quickly to foster care . 
  spain have been doing this a long time .

'', 
  the august 23 , 2005 . 
  after separation , r.m.s. 
  saw her daughter three times more . 
  in one of them , the daughter said that she had been taken to a house with a pool . 
  the fact is that in 2006 , a family was selected for pre-adoptive foster care . 
  strasbourg sentenced to spain in 2012 already for expelling a nigerian citizen , and giving her child up for adoption to a spanish family without the consent of his biological father , who worked in barcelona . 
  * this has obvious effects . 
  spain has an increasing number of [ malnourished children . ] ( http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/en/news/sections/economics/2013/06/06/crisis-malnourished-children-spanish-schools_8829303.html ) . 
  parents are scared of losing them if they ask for help . 
  because that can happen . 
  the government does n't want to take so many children , thus they are letting the situation rot . 
  the third option . 
  edit : i wanted to talk about this with somebody who was n't spaniard , thanks . 
  but , that option is more expensive that doing nothing or giving the children to well-off families . 
  what 's the best usage of the scarce public resources ? 
  edit : [ the question is n't so obvious in spain . 
  that 's very common in spain also . 
  my cousin and her husband do n't believe in any god and are catholics , but they had a religious marriage the baptised their children . 
  a [ similar poll ] ( http://librexpresion.org/la-poblacion-espanola-ya-no-es-catolica-pero-sigue-siendo-mas-tonta-que-el-asa-de-un-cubo ) in spain : * 10 % of the practising catholic and 25 % of the non-practising do n't believe that jesus existed . 
  * 8 % of the practising catholic and 58 % of the non-practising catholic do n't believe that god exists . 
  * 20 % of the practising catholic and 66 % of the non-practising catholic do n't believe that the bible is the word of god . 
  * 31 % of the practising catholic and 83 % of the the non practising catholic do n't believe that the pope is the representative of god in earth, 
   well , my experiences with spanish work culture has been rather abysmal to say  and do n't get me started on telefonica - i hate those idiots . 
  it was faster for me to buy the equipment i needed in norway and have them send it with dhl over night to my location in spain . 
  telefonica promised me the parts in 3-4 days because they had to be sent from madrid to malaga !, 
  yes , that 's our lovely former monopoly that has in the payroll dozens of politicians . 
  you should avoid them always unless you are a big company or you have connections . 
  there are more companies : * ono : initially started by members of the opus dei , the first president was a high officer of the dictatorship . 
  the company was founded when the conservatives where in power . 
  it 's owned by american investment funds nowadays . 
  * jazztel , founded by an argentinian immigrant . 
  * orange ( france telecom ) . 
  but you sent us some relatives before . 
  from the link  excluding administration . 
  i have read other tables including that in / r/europe and belgium was a net gainer . 
  ** spain ** i am choosing [ naranjito ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cihrrwy.jpg ) we are n't serious . 
   why should greece get a marshall plan and not romania or bulgaria ? 
  even if the worst estimates for greece come true , they 'll still be way richer than us . 
  a marshall plan is a way of calling a plan rebuilding a formerly rich country . 
  usually destroyed by a war . 
  romania or bulgaria have n't been rich . 
  the behavior of the greek economy has been worse than the worst estimation . 
  i would expect this trend to continue . 
  maybe greece wo n't be richer than you soon . 
  however , i think that your argument is valid . 
  and your retrieving eu funds . 
  use them with wisdom . 
  carrefour . 
  it 's a nice country with a nice summer , and nice but shy people . 
  i am at work now . 
  i have done that already . 
  it was sweden , because reasons, 
   irish business men also use spain to avoid paying taxes too .
