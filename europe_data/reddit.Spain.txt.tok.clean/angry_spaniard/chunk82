  the [ double irish ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/double_irish_arrangement ) is known and legal . 
   you also have quite a lot of our drug lords in hiding . 
  and russians , and spaniards ; spain is the main gate of drugs in western europe . 
  most of them have * business * in spain . 
  what 's your point ? 
  as somebody that as lived in southern europe and in northern europe . 
  for me seems like the most important differences are that we care about our families more and they are the center of our lifes , that we do n't take as seriously the laws . 
  and that we do n't have the resources to do some of the things that are common in northen europe . 
  like having college students living by themselves . 
  * spain * spain is almost closed for holidays . 
  the ~ ~ corruption ~ ~ political activity is very slow .

  nothing new since the proposal of restricting the self-generation ( spain wants to privatize the sun in reddit ) .

   one year untill election , and politicans have started promising/threatening stuff they 'll do if they win . 
  do you mean stuff they ** wo n't ** do if they win ? 
  that 's a german tradition . 
  he does n't have any other citienship . 
  he has been german al his life . 
  you ca n't deny that . 
  he was born and raised in germany . 
  you created him and he is your responsability . 
  you need even more commitment to catch up romania and bulgaria . 
  you need a more stable government that can work full time in destroying the country . 
  some comertial banks have retrieved a bailout . 
  banco popular , banco pastor and banco valencia were in a very bad shape . 
  [ popular ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/economia/20111008/54227585370/el-popular-absorbera-el-pastor-por-1-300-millones-y-reabre-el-baile-de-fusiones.html ) the main problem with the regional saving banks were n't the loans to private consumer , the comercial banks , except santander , did the same . 
  the problem were the loans to the construction companies , they have the biggest defualting rate , and the financing of crazy project . 
  the ghost airport of ciudad real was owned by a cartel of business ( construction companies ) and public administrations . 
  but , all the money came from loans from the regional saving bank . 
  caja madrid gave a 60 million loan to a company owned the president of the businessman union who is currently in jail becuase he robbed his own companies including the money of that loan . 
  this piece of shit financed the electoral campaing of the party that ruled the bank . 
  the central bank controlled most of the loans that were given to private consumers were the * investments * and loans to big companies what killed most of the regional saving banks . 
   but a loan of 50000 to 75000 with 25 year payback time he should get buying a house with that money was imposible 5 years ago . 
  nowadays it 's posible in bad neighborhoods and in the country side . 
  but serbia had its own comunism . 
   if people ca n't afford or ca n't get loans after they have graduated and gotten a job , then it is highly probable that the local economy is too regulated by the state . 
  i would prefer that . 
  too many unskilled temporary workers got mortgages in my country . 
  5 years ago temporary workers earning $ 1,200 got mortgages for $ 200,000 apartments and asking for more mortgage that needed was common to buy a fancy car . 
  the banks did that because property prices were increasing by 15 % annually . 
  and property prices were increasing 15 % annually because that . 
  i think that regulation can be a good idea . 
  have you met talked with people ? 
  we had high school leaving exams in the past , maybe we will have them in the future . 
  spain has had 13 education reforms in the last 30 years . 
  7 for the non college education . 
  5 for the tertiary education [ link ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2012/01/26/espana/1327592557.html ) i had college entrance exams , the sames for all the region . 
  valid in all spain . 
  it included an english . 
  it was very easy . 
  answering simple question about a text , some grammar question and redacting a simple text . 
  however , i learnt two languages spanish and catalan . 
  we have an english subject , but we do n't learn almost anything . 
  ;-) i started to study english when i was 8 years old in the public education . 
  but , we do n't learn to speak , i studied grammar and some vocabulary only ( always the same ) the first 4 years . 
  i started to learn to speak and understand some simple english in high school . 
  but , i was unable to keep a simple conversation in english until after i started the university . 
  [ are you sure ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_france#statistics ) that will be true probably in two generations . 
  specially with the german alsatian . 
  spanish is too powerful and we do n't actually learn english in the mandatory education . 
  no , my local language is overrunning other languages like asturian , basque , galician , aragonese and has a strong fight with catalonian language . 
  catalonian is losing in valencia and balearic islands and winning in catalonia . 
  it 's also overrunning native languages in the hispanic america . 
  i am not exactly concerned by the health of my language . 
  i have to remember that we had the right wing dictator franco ruling spain in 1946 . 
  it 's not only a dated law , it 's extremely conservative ( it 's extremely biased to favour the banks ) . 
  do you have three millions and half of empty homes ? 
  then it is n't in the same scale . 
  we can relocate half of netherlands in our empty homes . 
  there is a problem , police officers prefer to have their children alive . 
  [ without spaniards , please .

  i find hard to believe the gdp figures that my government is publishing . 
  spain has destroyed half million of formal jobs in the last 12 months . 
  i find hard to believe that the country has lost 20 % of its jobs but the economy only shrank a 3.7 % in 5 years . 
  maybe our productivity is growing very quickly like our government claims . 
  but i find it very hard to believe .

   we can only wait for our current young generation to be the policy makers in a couple of decades , they are much more liberal . 
  that does n't mean that they are less corrupt .
