  they ca n't use that money for investment . 
  that money is for paying previous loans . 
  you can join a trade after two years of training , being a 18 years old . 
  that 's enough for most of the jobs . 
  why should everybody go to college ? 
  it 's not like a society where everybody has a skilled job is possible . 
  besides that , college education is expensive . 
  the people running this are the ones that commit the rampant corruption and the other political scandals . 
  they are n't interested in fixing our real problems . 
  doing what ? 
  disorganized crime . 
  * you forgot that our industry and tourism minister holidays in a illegal hotel .

  the foral tax system means that they have 28 % corporate tax and mainline spain has 30 % corporate tax . 
  basque country and navarra have the basque economic agreement that means that they only pay for the services that eu or the spanish government provide to the basque people . 
  the do n't contribute to the * fondo de compensaci\u00f3n interterritorial * . 
  they have very important privileges . 
  i do n't think that it will work . 
  it makes me want the independence . 
  and i am not from a place with a pro-iindependence movement . 
  i know that i am always talking about spain , but this history is extremely amusing . 
  i am not from anywhere with a independence movement , and i do n't want the break up of spain . 
  but , i am jealous of the will of some political change . 
  spain needs to be shacked . 
  even if they break spain that would be better than keeping the status quo . 
  that actually happened . 
  luxembourg , the small shameful tax haven that is also a net retriever of eu funds . 
  [ about spain ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1joo5o/spain_will_have_an_unemployment_rate_above_25/ ) the greek forecast is similar . 
  why should growth come back ? 
  this links gives reasons for the opposite . 
   secondly , prosecute those who are corrupt . 
  what if the people in charge of prosecuting the corrupt are also corrupt ? 
  italian industrial output increased in june a 0.3 % . 
  it 's not a lot , but it 's a positive figure . 
  however , italy has a recesion still . 
  uk is n't in schengen . 
  yes , you are right . 
  it 's because i am spaniard probably . 
  i should have use italy . 
  they are having an [ industrial recovery ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-06/italy-s-industrial-output-rises-in-sign-of-easing-slump.html ) that nobody was expecting . 
  but , we ca n't have this thread for every country we should send eu wide links , if that 's possible . 
  the first bailout was done by the spanish government before we retrieved the bailout . 
  the second is done after the bailout , but spain passed an amendment to the constitution that gives priority to pay back the bailout over the public services , pensions or public servants salaries . 
  however , it 's not like we enforce seriously the constitution . 
   spain still is a net benefactor from eu funding compared to north european nations . 
  spain is extremely dependent on eu funding in all aspects of its economy [ 10 euros per capita ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budget_of_the_european_union#net_contributors_and_recipients ) is it extremely dependent ? 
  can you back your statements with facts ? 
  this airport was paid by a regional savings bank . 
  they retrieved a bailout in 2009 and were integrated in liberbank before the european intervention . 
  government loaned them 124 millions in 2012 that are n't going to be returned . 
  they will become capital probably ,, 
  did you see the french and spanish indutrial output figures ? 
  the spanish industrial output fell 1.9 % [ link ] ( http://ransquawk.com/headlines/spanish-industrial-output-wda-jun-y-y-1-9-vs-exp-1-2-prev-1-3-rev-to-1-5-08-08-2013 ) what 's this british obsession with the french ? 
  this will improve your mood . 
  [ picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wlrlo7h.jpg ) translation : entry without warning is prohibited to dogs and romanians . 
  otherwise they will have to run . 
   stunts like these will ensure that there will be even bigger political opposition in other euro-zone member countries to support further economic stimulus to spain . 
  is that a bad thing ? 
  if with stimulus you mean bank bailouts we are better without that . 
  if you meant actually stimulus we lost the support for that in 2010 . 
  spain closes the fence . 
  you do n't count . 
  ciudad real is * far * from madrid . 
  does n't make sense . 
  extendng barajas is a better idea . 
  we ran out of needed infrastructures and spain started to build more airports . 
  list of unneeded airports : * this airport was paid by a regional saving bank . 
  * the one in castell\u00f3n by the regional and provincial government . 
  * huesca airport built by the central government . 
  * lleida airport : paid by the catalan government . 
  * murcia - corvera airport initially private . 
  the regional government put 200 millions . 
  it 's not only airports . 
  [ also highways ] ( http://www.telemadrid.es/noticias/nacional/noticia/fomento-contempla-rescatar-autopistas-en-quiebra-entre-ellas-las-radiales - ), 
   that is why i will not answer those first questions , you are n't even attempting to give all the options , you just say that there is a and b , and forget the rest of the alphapbet . 
  i was talking about the likely scenario where spain does n't try to fix its problems . 
  whatever , i should n't you that have answers , i do n't think that eu is prepared for that either . 
  but , i think that we should be ready for that scenario . 
   not a lot . 
  the spanish economy is not the eu 's responsibility , and any solution would involve going beyond the commitments that the eu states have made . 
  spain is going bust , so now we are going to say that spain is not a sovereign state anymore , and the spanish people do not know what to do and are asking other people to fix them , which , will as we know , all involve money , loads of them . 
  please finland , give them 5 % of your gdp '' . 
  i am not asking about that . 
  i think that giving more money to my government makes the situation worse in the long term . 
  and economic problems are created by the political problems . 
  acting in the economy before fixing the political and legal framework is not working . 
  political intervention is totally forbidden in the eu that 's right . 
  however , eu put mario monti as pm of italy some time . 
   buit , for the record , i think the euro is the most imperfect of currencies and that you should leave it , together with greece and portugal . 
  what spain is suffering from ( a huge part of the problem at least ) is the internal devaluation that comes with the territory . 
  spain has had over 20 % of unemployment before the euro . 
  maybe spain should leave the emu , but i would n't expect that the things would get better with that . 
  we also have demographic , constitutional , institutional , social ... 
  some days i would prefer that spain falls in pieces in a peaceful way . 
  it would force some change at least . 
   fix your country , that you ca n't fix . 
  pay off your debt , etc. 
  you do not seem to realise , at all , that you are the only ones who can fix your country , and frankly - we have been sending money south since forever . 
  it has not made a single difference .
