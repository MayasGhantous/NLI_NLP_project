  yet , you all , all of you , want more . 
  i do n't want more . 
  i am not asking for money . 
  it 's not going to solve anything . 
  if nothing else changes they are going rob it . 
   above all , what irritates me is that you want to shift the responsibility to us , to me . 
  i do n't talk about blame , i talk about consequences . 
  what do you think that sweden should ? 
  * leaving the eu and schengen , to protect yourselves from the consequences . 
  * keep throwing money . 
  * try to fix the eu and the countries . 
  i do n't believe that the status quo can last a long time , and the problems are n't being fixed . 
  imf published that they do n't expect significant recovery in spain until [ 2018 at least . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1joo5o/spain_will_have_an_unemployment_rate_above_25/ ) * what do you expect me to do ? 
  * what do you think that the rest of the eu should do ? 
  if that means accepting corrupt and authoritarian governments i am not interested . 
   it is your country , you have the ideas , start implementing them . 
  saying is very easy . 
  i have given up with spain . 
  i emigrated . 
  : /  why ? 
  * italy , spain , greece , romania , bulgaria participate in the process to make laws that affect you . 
  our corrupt and failed countries . 
  * we can migrate freely to sweden . 
  are you ready for massive immigration ? 
  * you are giving funds to development of poor regions . 
  this funds are misused . 
  how do you feel about that ? 
  you are right in that is more important for us . 
  but , it also affects you . 
  like the authoritarian government in usa . 
  * the government is ruling by decree * government appointed more party members to the judicial power and to the constitutional court . 
  * government is messing with the regulators to favour some companies * director of the central bank is a party member . 
  * previous government passed a law to make the public radio and tv independent . 
  they rollback that . 
  * government presented a proposal to unify all the market regulators in a single body controlled by the president . 
  eu is blocking that and threatened with sanctions . 
  * spanish pp was founded by a former dictatorship minister and has creepy attitude towards it . 
  * government is avoiding the parliament * government is repeating the same bullshit as dictator with gibraltar . 
  however there is n't anything ideological in this the government only wants : * take over the regulators to favour the cronies * missuse public without restrictions * handle the utilities to private monopolies * keep the power * do n't go to prison * do whatever they want in general . 
  i would expand later , if it 's posible . 
   so , what exactly do you want me to do ? 
  i have the same question . 
  you ca n't pretend that this is n't your problem . 
  you are also a member of the eu . 
  should i say that the drug dealing connections of the president of the spanish galicia is only their problem ? 
  it affects all of us . 
   for example , how fix southern italy and corrupion ? 
  i do n't how to fix that in spain either . 
  :( i would say that we need : * independent and well funded judicial system * independent regulators * restrict the capacity of the government to pass laws by decree * a clear political framework where you can know what public has a competence . 
  * transparency : the accounts of the parties , workers unions , business unions , private companies should be public . 
  * a better elite selection system . 
  maybe we should regulate the organization of the political parties and change to a electoral law without closed lists ( but italy did that and they keep the old politicians * we should do something about the corrupt , drunk , womanizer that we call king . 
  * more incompatibilities between private sector * jobs * and * consultant services * and political jobs . 
  this is easy to say , but hard to do . 
  rajoy is trying to do the same in spain . 
  but we do n't talk about that . 
  there is ideology worse than fascism in spain for most of the people neoliberalism . 
  the conclusions are the usual . 
  eu should keep giving them money and the problems will fix by themselves . 
  how we can fix the massive corruption problem ? 
   let them get on with whatever they want to do and pursue sanctions after the fact . 
  you need to complain you if you want to pursue sanctions . 
  and you should pursue sanctions . 
   which could partly explain the growth ? 
  yes , but italy was bigger than uk or france . 
  now it 's shrinking very quickly and nobody cares . 
   who do you think will absorb bail out costs if france refuse ? 
  i hope that the bailouts would stop they are n't solving anything . 
  [ italy was a big economy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_italy#from_stagflation_to_stagnation_.281970s.e2.80.9380s.29 )  as a matter of fact , in 1987 , italy had a period when it surpassed the british economy ( an event known as il sorpasso ) , becoming the fifth in the world . 
  on 15 may 1991 italy became for a while the fourth worldwide economic power , overcoming france , with a gdp of us$ 1.268 trillion , compared to france 's gdp of us$ 1.209 trillion and britain 's of us$ 1.087 trillion . 
  despite this , however , italy 's alleged 1987 gdp growth of a phenomenal 18 % , it was shortly re-overtaken by both france and the united kingdom during the 1990s , when italy 's economic growth was particularly stagnant , with an average of 1.23 % compared to an eu average of 2.28 % . 
  italy was the biggest economy of the eu . 
  but the average growth of the las ten years [ is negative ] ( http://www.gfmag.com/component/content/article/119-economic-data/12369-countries-lowest-gdp-growth.html#axzz2bgvic9bi ) france has grown a 1.0 . 
  why this obsession with the french decline ? 
  italy and spain are having a bigger decline and nobody seems to care . 
  what 's your proposal to feed that people ? 
  is the subsistence agriculture our future ? 
  :( and , how would you get the farmland if you are poor ? 
  spain there is plenty of unused farmland , part of the farmland is owned by the government . 
  however , government wants that its farmlands stay unused . 
  there was a riot recently because unemployed members of a farm workers union started to work a estate that used to breed horses . 
  government sent the militar-civil riot police . 
  the union leaders are being tried . 
  [ the prosecutor ask for seven months of prison ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2013/07/15/andalucia/1373880437.html ), 
  spain is not going to allow the referendum . 
  government said they would send catalan government to prison before allowing it . 
  there are more jobless out of town that in town . 
  what 's your point ? 
  it 's not like the people can be picky with the retail jobs ( or unskilled in general ) and work only near their home because there is a big supply of jobs and they can be picky . 
  who can afford children ? 
  spain is going to have an unemployment rate over 25 % until at least 2018 , [ according to imf ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1joo5o/spain_will_have_an_unemployment_rate_above_25/ ) this is not a crisis . 
  this is permanent . 
  it 's also like that in spain . 
  but , that 's due to that they are firing employees . 
  if the demand is a 15 % lower you fire 15 % of your employees and you pay a lower salary to the ones that stay with you . 
   comparing spain to north korea is quite insulting to one of the worlds greatest nations yep , best korea should protest . 
  you will have to conquer us and rule this shithole . 
  yep , thanks . 
  it depends in the municipal level is usual .
