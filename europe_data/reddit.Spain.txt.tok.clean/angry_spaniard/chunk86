  no , some people like to have king who is a drunkard womanizer corrupt . 
  remember berlusconi 's fans exist . 
  who can afford to have children ? 
  you can have corruption in this situations . 
  you should check how enel bought endesa in spain . 
  it was a private company , but the minister that authorized that is working for them . 
  the government blocked the other bid from e on without any logical reason .

   can profit from a monarch acting as a unifying figure . 
  are you talking about our corrupt piece of shit ? 
  how much corruption involved in the operation ? 
  did you violated the agreement also ? 
   contrary to claims by the eu , it is not the faroese herring quota for 2013 that is putting the stock at risk . 
  it is the lack of an inclusive five-party agreement on allocation of this shared stock which jeopardies its sustainability . 
  if understand this extremely editorialized link * faroe islands increased their quota by themselves with an agreement with eu and the eu thinks that this is illegal . 
  * as anybody would expect . 
  * * they are also angry because the eu does n't want to increase the quota for nobody including the eu . 
  * the herring population seems to increase , but the eu does n't want to change anything . 
  * the faroe islands has the smaller quota . 
  * but they have also the smaller population . 
  * * norway got an increase in its quota in 2007 . 
  * and nobody else got an increase , including the eu . 
  * * the proposed sanctions are a suspension of the full herring quota . 
  faroeses says that 's too extreem . 
  * it seems very extrem that 's true . 
  * tldr : seems the faroe islands have violated a fishing agreement and the eu wants to apply extreme sanctions . 
  faroe islands and greenland are the ones who do n't want to be part of the eu . 
  he was an idiot that destroyed his body and his life fighting in wars that were n't worth it . 
  he did n't have problems with risking his life and his men doing futile missions . 
  he fits exactly the epic hero definition , that does n't mean that i admire him or that i think that he did something good for the country . 
  i have the feeling that the pdl leaders ( who are n't berlusconi ) do n't have a clue either . 
  do you support tariffs to spain from northem europe ? 
  but , he would n't see the full spectrum in germany . 
  we all the types : successful musicians , football players , politicians , mafia bosses , petty crime , drug dealing , organized crime with powerful political connections , tablaos flamencos , flea markets ( that sell a lot of stuff imported illegally , falsifications , gypsies and not gypsies ... 
  if you want to see gypsies spain is better , you will see spanish gypsies better integrated than anywhere else in europe . 
  there are problems and weird stuff . 
  the education rate is lower in spanish gypsies than the average , and the crime rate and poverty are higher . 
  but , if you got andalucia most of the traditional music ( flamenco ) is done by gypsies , you can see them in tablaos . 
  there are some [ politicians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/juan_de_dios_ram%c3%adrez_heredia ) of that ethnic group also . 
  and there are connections between gipsy organized crime and political parties . 
  totally integrated . 
  :p however , most of the people when think about gypsies think in people living of petty crimes in poverty . 
  and that 's mostly true for the romanian gypsies immigrants that we got these years sadly . 
  while the situation has been getting better with the local gypsies we are getting others that are starting in a very bad way in this society . 
  the situation with romanian gypsies is really bad . 
  and the people of course is racist .

  * [ the president 's wife ] ( http://elpais.com/diario/2011/12/10/revistasabado/1323471602_850215.html ) worked for telefonica , until the elections .

   what do you think the chances are that catalonia will declare independence ? 
  i do n't know , the catalan president is a corrupt phony who was n't supportting the independence openly until 2 years ago and is financing his party ( cdc ) illegally probably . 
  his partner udc has been doing that and it 's proved and they have been together in all the elections the last 30 years . 
  furthermore , he is more interested in keeping the power than in the independence itself . 
  however , the popular support of the independence is strong . 
  it 's over 50 % of the population , and only 25 % are against it .
