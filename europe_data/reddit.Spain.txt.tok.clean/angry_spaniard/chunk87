  there is a small chance , but it 's posible . 
   should n't they then have the rail gauge standardized over the whole eu instead of having a seperate gauge for the iberian peninsula ? 
  it 's standardized , but changing everything would be very expensive . 
  but , the new high speed lines are international gauge http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iberian_gauge, 
  i am not sure about that anymore . 
  the government is doing the same with catalonia since they elected an independentist government . 
  they are applying more austerity to investments in catalonia , they are asking for stricter deficit quotes for catalonia than other regions . 
  besides that , the eu declared that having rail freight transport between spain and france is a priority for the union and the spanish government proposed to build a tunnel across pyrenees to avoid catalonia . 
  i think that the final decision is going throught catalonia , but the spanish government is not going to invest in that until 2016 at least . 
  i am not . 
  from gibraltar or catalonia , or anywhere with a pro-indepence movement , but i do n't want to be part of this country anymore . 
  it 's amusing , because italy was one of the lowest [ intentional homicide rate ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate#by_country ) . 
  it 's lower than the swedish , but higher than the spanish and gerrman rates . 
  but , maybe they are cheating with their rates . 
  i do n't know , there was a similar discussion in iceland . 
  we have more news . 
  the usual stuff : corruption . 
  unemployment figures better than in 2012 like 2011 , * austerity * , abuse of power , corrupt regulation for the energy sector ... 
   more calls for the mod to do something about the armed guardia civil incursions into british gibraltar territorial waters , including a direct call from the chief minister to the uk for the royal navy to send warships . 
  i do n't care , but spain considers that these waters are spanish territorial waters . 
  the treaty excluded explicitly most of the waters that you are claiming . 
  i think the same about spain . 
  i hate the current spain , but i have a republican flag because i needed to believe something . 
  but , imho spain is beyond salvation . 
  nowayads , i wii be happy if spain is fragmented in a peacefull way . 
  [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:english_foreign_and_second_language_eu.jpg ) is acurate , at least for spain and sweden . 
  are you interested in independence ? 
  spain is not going to survive to more galician rulers . 
  i find hard to believe that 20 % of stockholm is muslim . 
  i mean , i know that you are lying . 
  however , that 's true for malm\u00f6 . 
  * 26 % of the residents [ have immigrant background ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stockholm#demographics ) , including myself . 
  * the number of muslims members that go regularly to mosque is 110.000 , but the number of people of muslim background is near half million in all the country . 
  * 70 % of the immigrants are from europe . 
  [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_sweden#demographics ) there are countries in europe that are muslim like bosnia ( but they are n't very religious ) . 
  but there are a lot of non-muslim immigrants from china , thailand , chile , vietnam , lebanom ( most of the immigrants are from the christian minority ) ... sweden has like a 5 % of muslim population including people that is n't actually muslim . 
  i am not going to answer everything else , but you are full of shit . 
  i can understand you . 
  but this seems wrong for me . 
  this is ok . 
  but we skip the subject often , because we can deduce the subject from the verb . 
  in addition , i would an adverb : * ah , ya veo . 
  sorry , that 's wrong . 
  * this means that netherlands is your homeland or you are living permanently there . 
  this means that youare temporarily in netherlands  soy un frisio en el norte del pa\u00eds . 
  two options also , they mean almost the same : * soy frisio , del norte del pa\u00eds . 
  this has a very nice ambiguity , because if you are refering with country to frisia you mean that you are from northern frisia , but if you refer to netherlands then you mean that frisia is in the north of netherlands . 
  you can have a job an live in poverty is that what you are proposing ? 
  hey !, 
   where do you see a growth of the few in real world wealth , not money ? 
  do you see that those who had one ferrari now have five ? 
  i am not a marxist , but the wealth in the marxism is n't that . 
  the wealth in the marxism is about the control of the means of production . 
  the central point is that the capitalism concentrates all the means of production in a few hands who rule the society . 
  i am not an economist , i can be wrong , but i read some books and talked a lot about economy ,, 
   how is high wages , job security ( a weird term on its own , we should be both destroying and creating a lot of jobs ) and taxes are exactly supposed to compete with asia ? 
  i do n't care about competing with asia . 
  i care about our life standards . 
  another microstate that bases their economy in helping the rich people to avoid to fulfil their obligation with the society . 
  [ spain ] ( http://www.ipsnews.net/2011/10/spain-detained-immigrants-are-treated-like-criminals/ ) and [ italy ] ( http://strugglesinitaly.wordpress.com/equality/en-immigrants-detention-centers-in-italy/ ) are putting illegal immigrants in detention camps also . 
  spain some times tortures them also . 
  we got some disapproval un resolutions due to that . 
  [ link ] ( http://tomalapalabra.periodismohumano.com/2012/10/28/la-onu-condena-a-espana-por-detencion-arbitraria-discriminacion-racial-y-torturas-en-el-cie-de-aluche/ ), 
  that 's maybe in your country . 
  spain has very serious issues . 
  * corruption * union of powers between legislative , executive and judicial branches * government controlled regulators . 
  * stupid investments without consequence : ghost airports , highways to nowhere we can talk also about the private oligopolies , the local administration , the 7 education laws in 30 years , the weight of the catholic church ... somebody else would like to talk about our labour market with 42 different types of contract , that after 2 labour market reforms in three years is even worse . 
  two years ago we had the same and the economy did n't grow anyway . 
  2012 was actually bad , we did n't created jobs even in the summer . 
  it 's sad . 
  :( this train was n't using the new security system . 
  estonia has lost a lot of population since the fall of comunism . 
  [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_estonia#population ) the population is fleeding , i would be concerned about a 18 % decrease in population . 
   did people protest ? 
  yes , but nothing big . 
   or do they wait for the time for the eu to make spain fix it ? 
  maybe , but that 's not going to happen . 
  the eu is not asking for independent regulators , judicial reform and transparency . 
  they are asking for lower salaries , less public servants ( aka firing teachers and researchers ) , bailouts for the banks and higher and more regressive taxes . 
  you have forgotten portugal like everybody . 
  but ... 
  but !, 
  they told us the sports events and the bullfighting are the way out of the depression . 
  [ madrid 2020 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madrid_bid_for_the_2020_summer_olympics ) did they lie again ? 
  ok , then i will reelect them . 
   are n't they supposed to be independent from politics ? 
  no , [ montesquieu has died ] ( http://es.wikiquote.org/wiki/alfonso_guerra ) . 
  this was told by a former vice-president when their government took over the judicial system . 
  the first social-democratic government after the dictatorship . 
  the justice is handled by the ruling party since that . 
  i understand their point , before that most of the judges in key position where appointed by the dictatorship . 
  but , it has shitty effects . 
  the justice should be separated . 
   i always thought both judges and prosecuters ca n't be fired ? 
  they can be fired . 
  the * prosecutor * of the banker that robbed caja madrid is pursuing the judge because [ sent to jail the banker ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/07/19/inenglish/1374247178_314435.html ) the judge has been already moved out of his office due to some rigged stuff . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.eljurista.eu/2013/07/16/sancion-al-magistrado-d-elpidio-jose-silva/ ) the public servants can be fired if an internal court considers that 's the right decision . 
  and the members of that court for the judges are selected by the politicians . 
  [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_council_of_the_judiciary ) edit : most of the regulators for : energy , central bank , telecomunications , are even more in the hands of the government . 
  for other people the crimes do n't expire if the preliminary investigation has started before the time limit .
