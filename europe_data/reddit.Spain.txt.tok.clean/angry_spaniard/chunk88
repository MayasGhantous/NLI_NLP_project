  the sentencing is always after +5 years . 
  with that interpretation sending somebody to jail is impossible . 
  edit : they tried the same with [ carlos fabra ] ( http://elpais.com/diario/2010/12/28/espana/1293490810_850215.html ) , but then we had a social-democratic supreme court . 
  and [ it was rejected ] ( http://elpais.com/diario/2011/12/02/espana/1322780409_850215.html ) . 
  the judges of a party do n't send to jail members their comrades unless they risk their job letting them walk free . 
  and the public prosecutors of a party do n't ask for prison for their comrades . 
  is it corruption ? 
   current situation of the economy at national level : spain : total ` bad ' 99 % total ` good ' 1 % . 
  who is this 1 % ? 
  stop trolling the polls . 
   main concerns at national level : national results 13 options and it does n't include the corruption . 
  a government poll in spain said that the corruption is considered the biggest problem of the country by 40 % of the population : [ link ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/20130307/corruption-steals-spotlight-among-spaniards-concerns ) . 
  the first is the unemployment , the economic depression is third . 
   the finnish government takes a really weird puritanical view towards drinking - as if someone having a couple of glasses of pinot grigio with their spaghetti on a thursday evening is going to collapse society . 
  the finnish society has an alcoholism problem . 
  and it has been even worse . 
  i am not saying that they 're right , or wrong , i am only explaining why . 
  i have lost my hope in spain . 
  spain has crossed my limits these days . 
  most of the members of the court are there proposed by the ruling party . 
  we are going to apply austerity to the health care , education and r&d . but we are going to try to get the olympic games . 
  it 's almost the same !, 
   state guaranteed 30-year loans what are the chances of the companies going to bankruptcy ? 
  how much money are we talking about ? 
  it 's going ok . 
  i have a good job , the companies are hiring software developers like crazy . 
  the people is not exactly like in spain , but they are nice . 
  [ they are exactly like you would expect . 
  ] ( http://monkeygoestosweden.blogspot.se/2012/08/como-ser-sueco-que-hacer-para.html ) i 'm in stockholm and the worst is the housing . 
  it 's very hard to find a good apartment . 
  why are you asking ? 
  are you thinking in moving here ? 
   you might be surprised . 
  people who really dislike david cameron ( leader of the uk government ) often really , really , really dislike alex salmond ( leader of the scottish government ) . 
  i am a foreigner , i do n't know alex salmond . 
  i am doing that in sweden right now . 
  ** spain : ** corruption and bullshit from the government . 
  business as usual . 
  this has been a slow week , actually . 
  * public prosecutor pursues judge for sending former banker to jail . 
  it 's the banker that bought illegally an american bank , gave a big loan to diaz ferraz , and sold preferencial shares criminally , and fixed the accounting to tell that the bank had profits , [ link ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/07/19/inenglish/1374247178_314435.html ) * the president is an asshole . 
  he fixed the questions with the press when he was with the polish president and he only answered the questions from a pro-government newspaper and he read the answers from a paper . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2013/07/15/espana/1373895079.html ) * the corrupt government will tax the people tax generates their own electricity . 
  the taxes will be higher than the taxes that you have to pay for the electricity bought to private companies . 
  two former president work for these companies . 
  [ sauce ] ( http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2013/07/19/actualidad/1374237478_141414.html ) * the president of the constitutional court was a member of the ruling party until the day he was appointed to the office .

  they have offered him the head of the justice minister . 
  but , barcenas is telling everything still . 
  including the offer , and he loves to hoard evidence [ link ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2013/07/15/espana/1373848506.html ) * brussels orders spain to recover tax breaks granted to shipbuilding sector . 
  part of the 87,000 jobs will be lost . 
  [ link ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/07/17/inenglish/1374067689_529494.html ) * university fees will rise again and the scholarships will be cut again , because austerity [ source ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/07/18/inenglish/1374171767_470670.html] ) minor stuff that i do n't want to search : * the king is going to morocco to sell weapons and some other business . 
  maybe we will come back with other luxury car . 
  * some demonstrations against the government , but they were n't big . 
  * the opposition parties hate each other and they are n't going to collaborate to fight the government . 
  * the 35 biggest spanish companies have declared that they support rajoy and want him as president . 
  it makes sense , they bribed him , they would lose the investment . 
   i really doubt that any country in the eurozone depends on the interest payments of greece , portugal , etc to survive and to balance the budget did you forget spain ? 
  we are one of the main creditors of these countries , specially portugal ? 
  and the santander group was the main private creditor of portugal a year ago . 
   the countries were not expecting that money back , anyway . 
  probably no , but our budget is written like we expect the money . 
  let 's check spain : * coal power : subsidies if it 's spanish coal . 
  * wind power : some subsidies and special regimen . 
  * solar energy : crazy amount of subsidies until 2011 , nothing starting at 2015 . 
  it 's in the constitutional court , ^ 1 because the laws have been changed retroactively . 
  the total amount of money in question is like 6 billions . 
  * bioenergy power : special regimen . 
  * combined cycle : some special plants receive subsidies , other retrieve a payment if they are n't used ( the energy demand is low due to the depresion ) , because they are needed to regulate the system * hydroelectricity : are regulators of the system , they retrieve some support due to that . 
  and some plants are in the special regimen . 
  the only type of plants that are n't supposed to retrieve public money are the nuclear plants , however , the government paid part of the construction cost and it 's going to pay part of the cost of the long term storage of residues . 
  finally , the government is not paying all the money that has promised to the companies , the government owes them like 26 billions euros . 
  it does n't include the solar enegy claims that are in court . 
  i do n't know if i want the eu in this . 
  but , i do n't think that this can get worse . 
  -- 1 . - the president of the court is a member of the ruling party , it 's going to be interesting . 
   yes , so why are france still receiving those money ? 
  should n't they go to poland/bulgaria etc ? 
  maybe , if you 're talking about eu funds . 
  however france should probably keep expending money in rural development because the french rural areas are less atractive than urban areas without additional funding . 
  the rural areas have improved in the last 40 years , but the urban areas have improved also . 
  but , the rural areas are less competitive than urban areas still . 
   i am saying that the cap is tailored after france 's need . 
  for example , why does a swedish farmer receive less money for the exakt same cow . 
  citation needed . 
   if we need the cap to survive , why in god 's name are we then subsidising wine and tobacco ? 
  * rural development , * however the final product is heavily taxed . 
  actually , it 's to protect local producers from imports . 
  you can discuss the real point of the cap   not to mention other idiotic endevours , that should not receive the cap , like tulips etc. 
  are you saying the cap is sensible , completely tailored after all of the eu and that we need to give 44 % to the cap ? 
  i do not think so . 
  no , i am not saying that . 
  but , i say that we need a cap . 
   i ca n't find it .
