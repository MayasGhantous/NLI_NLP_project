  the status of legal immunity : * current king felipe vi : total immunity * previous king , current queen and crown princess : any charge against them should be decided by the supreme court . 
  the old king has been sued by some of his bastards asking for a cut in the inheritance . 
  edit : [ link ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/politica/paternidad-juan-carlos-borbon-supremo_0_287321337.html ) they also have diplomatic passports and a salary , a car with a trained driver , and some other perks . 
  it 's not the worse , but it 's not fair . 
  they have some immigration also and they are n't rich . 
  [ morocco did a regularization of illegal immigrants ] ( http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/649325-morocco-moves-to-recognise-illegal-immigrants.html ) and [ there are been some racial riots also ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/europes-door-black-african-migrants-trapped-hellish-limbo-morocco-1404846 ) the border between spain and morroco is fairly closed . 
  maybe 10,000 people has crossed it in the last 12 months including boats . 
  morocco border has been crossed by 80,000 illegal immigrants according to current estimations ( spanish government has done some alarmism with them ) , and many of them give up crossing and working in illegal construction , picking fruits for close to no money , living homeless ... edit : spain is paying to morocco to stop the boats , like the eu was able to do with gadaffi , but that is n't without consequences . 
  maybe he means that tunisia wo n't fight back even if we invade them because they would lose and therefore we can do whatever we want with their country . 
  and that 's not going to backfire !, 
  since 2011 * the government is ruling by royal decrees with the parliament reduced to a ceremonial role , the parliament ratifies in one day sessions the decrees without going by the commissions , without amendments ... 
  it 's not the first government , but this one is going further this path reforming fundamental rights and the labour market with this procedure ( the constitutional court allowed that despite what our constitution says ) . 
  * the government is passing laws to restrict demonstrations , and also wants to pass laws to charge the organizers of the demonstrations with any damage of public goods ( for discouraging ) * the independent board ( appointed by the parliament for long terms with a 16 % of workers representatives ) for controlling tv has been scrapped , now the director is appointed by the government directly . 
  * the public market regulators cmt ( telecommunications ) , cne ( energy ) , cnsp ( postal ) and others , that had some pretense of independence ( controlled by the parliament ) have been replaced by the generalist cnmc more controlled by the government . 
  the cnmv ( market supervisor ) is president by the former environment minister elvira rodriguez . 
  * the bank of spain has a more independent president sort of suprisingly . 
  * the president of the constitutional court was a member of the ruling party until the day that [ he took office ] ( http://www.eurointelligence.com/news-details/article/el-pais-questions-political-independence-of-constitutional-court-president.html?no_cache=1 ) ( legally questioned , he should have left the party before accepting the office ) . 
  half of the member have the same history , the minority of the official loyal oppsitionm the psoe . 
  i think that there is one that is not a member of a party due to an agreement for appointments . 
  the situation has become worse , but not a lot it was similar before . 
  honestly spain has never had strong democratic institutions or a system of checks and balances .

  the young unemployment should fall , the number of births has fallen a 20 % since 2008 and the government has published a report recently saying that expects another 20 % fall in the next ten years . 
  students do n't count as unemployed or employed , by default . 
  it 's only people that is part of the workforce working , or looking for jobs or in the eu adjusted poll if they define themselves as jobless ( and fulfill the requirements said by / u/katarn86 ) . 
  20 % of the working age people defined as young is not studying or working . 
  yep , the guy that called them communist has polish flair . 
  and they are n't communist , despite that . 
  [ manuel fraga ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manuel_fraga_iribarne ) , went from information minister of the dictatorship ( and you may know what that actually means ) to one of the parents of the constitution . 
  when he left national politics he become president of galicia and he defended the galician language that he prosecuted from the dictatorship government , he even created a regional tv that adorated him as a god in galician . 
  senator until 2011 after that . 
  he had in his party [ the last head of the government of the dictatorship ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carlos_arias_navarro ) . 
  for his blood-thirst participation in the civil war called the butcher of malaga . 
  and that 's the party that rules spain with an absolute majority . 
  and they are n't francoist despite that . 
  they are only corrupt authoritarian pieces of shit . 
  when we have a budget surplus we can discuss what to do with it . 
  to my government . 
  * what do we have to do for seeing you in prison and the money that has been stolen back ? 
  paying fines for all the abuse of power and waste would be nice also . 
  * what scams are you planning to fool the people for the 2015 elections ? 
   communists the bulgarian socialist party is as communist as the spanish popular party ( pp ) is francoist . 
  even if the founders come from dictatorships in both cases . 
  but , they are/were ( fraga died in 2011 ) mostly opportunist with a strong thirst of political power . 
  their leaders have declared that they support it . 
  * [ pablo iglesias ] ( http://www.ideal.es/nacional/201406/05/pablo-iglesias-contra-independencia-20140605132825-rc.html ) for podemos . 
  * [ cayo lara ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/politica/cayo-lara-apunta-derecho-decidir_0_137186907.html ) for iu ( united left ) . 
  edit : remember that political debate in spain also has the * tale * of the left as defensor of a more direct democracy and the right as defensor of the order , heirs of the dictatorship and a more restricted and purely representative democracy . 
  sort of biased , but has some truth about the bad things of the right , the good things of the left not so much . 
  as it 's proposed right now wo n't bring almost money to the regional and local administrations ( part of the income tax of the workers and sales taxes of their personal consumption ) , preparation for emergencies will be a big cost for them in fact ; and it will put in a serious risk the tourism having oil extraction controlled by the usual suspects near the touristic beaches . 
  if you 're thinking about industry the oil will be refined in the refineries in the mainline like now . 
  canarian ~ ~ corruption ~ ~ coalition ( ruling regionalist party ) has supported a lot of terrible decision in the past , i personally think that if the regional administration were promised money and an insurance for the tourism industry they would be able to reach an agreement . 
  however , with the government being like this and the contract going to repsol directly and the lack of controls and security i think that they should oppose for now . 
  we are n't norway . 
  with oil and the current government we would be the venezuela from before hugo ch\u00e1vez ( the people forgets that the corrupt conservatives from before were crap also ) . 
  ----- [ i talked about this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/21qndx/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week/cgfmugv ) some months ago :  it seems more than likely that there is oil near balearic islands and also near canary islands . 
  the international media , the government and the pro-government media are very enthusiastic about it . 
  however the islands ' population and the local politicians are becoming very hostile to the idea . 
  the government with their usual kindness propose that all the profits of the resources go for the spanish government and repsol ( mostly repsol ) and all the cost of any environment damage , problems for the tourism or anything to be assumed by the local administrations . 
  that are organizing demonstrations against it . 
  the guardian  i may be exaggerating but i do n't think so .
