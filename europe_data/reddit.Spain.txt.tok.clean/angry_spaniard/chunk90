  spain has capacity to generate energy for a economy bigger than the spanish economy and the government pays the companies for the unused capacity and a lot of more ~ ~ stupid ~ ~ corrupt things . 
  the wind energy is cheaper than that price , but the industry needs to pay for some of the capacity cost the the government ca n't afford anymore . 
   do you think it 's possible for spain to arrive at a relatively low-corruption political system at some point in the future when all of these scandals are resolved ? 
  i hope so , but nothing is done to achieve that . 
  i would n't count on it . 
  spain passed a reform that will increase the power of rajoy and the conservative party over the justice . 
  [ source ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/07/07/actualidad/1373215619_488372.html ) the [ general council of the judiciary ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_council_of_the_judiciary ) is very important in spain . 
  it 's the body that decides who will be the president of the supreme court and part of the members of the constitutional court . 
  it also has the power to penalise judges or appoint them to a lot of key positions . 
   why does n't rajoy resign ? 
  why would he resign ? 
  a president can be tried by the supreme court only , and the parliament and himself select indirectly most of the members of the court ; he appointed the general prosecutor that is doing as much as possible to protect rajoy from prosecution , and he can promise pardons and use the power of the state while he is in office . 
  it 's like berlusconi again , he needs to stay in power to avoid prison . 
  do you think it 's possible that the troika appoints a dictator like mario monti in italy ? 
  he did some reforms that were needed and berlusconi is having judicial problems thanks to him . 
  edit : without something like that i do n't expect any improvement in law enforcement against the corruption or in the economic situation before 2015 .

  -- 1 - the new conservative-center party created by a former member of the socialist workers party that lost the internal elections . 
  i have problems taking a party with this origin seriously . 
  the spanish fury is n't mentioned . 
  however , i studied the wars in the low countries . 
  and the name of key figures of the house of alba were mentioned and his participation . 
  i studied that and how the war was key to franco 's career . 
   go into politics yourself , if there is no alternative . 
  replace the dishonest people by offering a better alternative . 
  i have chosen emigration , but thanks . 
  i think that you have seen my point now . 
  this people has robbed the country and they apply the * austerity . 
  * recently the ex-treasurer ( he is under prosecution ) of the spanish pp has published proofs that the president accepted bribes when he was minister 15 years ago . 
  it 's only a warning , the crime has expired and he ca n't go under prosecution for that . 
  the worse is that seems like nobody in his party cares . 
  and about new parties i am very pessimistic . 
   the `` cronies '' were running the companies already before , only that when they are private , the gov ' t does not lose money with them anymore . 
  yes , it does . 
  the regional government of the capital privatized the management of some hospitals in a irregular way . 
  they previously * increased * ( without using the money ) the budget more than the amount that they are going to save now . 
  recently the supreme court has frozen the operation . 
  it has been done of a totally suspicious way . 
  [ link ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/07/10/inenglish/1373464986_651518.html ) the privatization of the energy companies 20 years ago has destroyed the industry of the country and has costed to the country billions of euros . 
  the two former presidents that did that are in the board of the two biggest companies the social-democratic in [ gas natural ] ( http://www.catalannewsagency.com/news/business/former-spanish-primer-minister-felipe-gonz%c3%a1lez-join-gas-natural-fenosa%e2%80%99s-board ) and the [ conservative in endesa . 
  ] ( http://es.reuters.com/article/iduklde70a1ap20110111 ) i gave up in finding a good link about this in english . 
  but beside of artifficially high regulated prices , we got a thing called `` deficit de tarifa . 
  this has costed us 28 billion euros . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20130419/deficit-tarifa-electrica-supero-los-28000-millones-euros-hasta-2012-segun-cne/643964.shtml ) and , i am not going to talk about what happened with the former telecommunication monopoly , that was having profits when was public . 
  and it 's costing money to the government directly due to an agreement to give services in rural areas and other stuff and indirectly because it handles all it of the government has a dominant position and with government support keeps the prices as high as posible . 
  it also has some former ministers in the board and the son in law of the king was their advisor until the prosecution for corruption became too risky . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.eitb.com/en/news/life/detail/945494/inaki-urdangarin-telefonica--urdangarin-steps-telefonica/ ) all the former public enterprises are draining more public money now that when they where public . 
  why is it going to be different now ? 
   its ot supposed to be `` long term '' either . 
  if * ot * is a * not * then they told us something different . 
   corruption kills . 
  because that leads to the gov ' t not having money later . 
  why is that so hard to understand ? 
  its simple cause and effect . 
  do you believe that the people is going to do that association ? 
  being honest most of the people think that corruption and * austerity * are equally bad . 
  you need to understand that the austerity here is used as a tool for a long term change in our society with bigger income inequallity and to sell public stuff to cronies of the government because austerity . 
  and comparing education , health care and food with a toy is offensive , by the way . 
  you are right . 
   austerity is not supposed to have popular support . 
  it is supposed to make people realize that stealing public money sucks at the end . 
  good luck with keeping a long term unpopular policy . 
  in addition , * austerity * is seen as another way of stealing public money due to that their more vocal local supporters are the most corrupt politicians who use it as a smoke screen to steal public money . 
  people says that the stealing public money sucks already . 
  but , a lot of people say that [ austerity kills ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/opinion/how-austerity-kills.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 ) . 
  and most of the people think that killing is worse that robbing .
