  and we also cut the budget of the tax service . 
  after that , the tax fraud seems to be growing surprisingly . 
  more like almost 60 % youth unemployment . 
  i did n't say that we should let them in . 
  they are in the worst situation and they do n't care if you let them in . 
  their situation is so bad that the risking their lives makes sense to them . 
  making illegal that they immigrate to the eu does n't change anything . 
  if you do n't believe it you can check uk , italy or belgium . 
   ** of course ** the government does give us a monthly allowance to life on ( depending on how much your parents earn ) , so as a student i ca n't complain at all . 
  it 's amazing what you can take for granted . 
  take care of your society . 
  are you giving this advice to african unskilled people ? 
  they are n't going to be accepted . 
  if that worked they would n't risk their lifes . 
  ok , we had a missunderstanding you are talking about the french proposal and i was talking about the spanish agreement . 
  i have the same opinion about the proposal . 
  spain needs to pay for the debt . 
  what are the posibilities for unskilled african people in those channels ? 
  let 's be honnest . 
  yes , i understand but my point is that is not happening . 
  and , i understood that you said that the spanish government is relieved . 
  can you check your previous comment ? 
  maybe i missunterstood something . 
   really ? 
  yes , you need to remember that the eu has * poor * countries like romania , rich countries like denmark an countries in the middle like spain . 
  how could romania afford to have student grants ? 
  the ruling says : `` a eu citizen residing in any eu country has the same rights as a citizen of the aforesaid country . '', 
  if you go to spain or romania you will retrieve the same that a spaniard or a romanian retrieve . 
  the information is also available in the [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_france#number_of_births ) headlines : * both parents born in france : 80.1 % * one parent born in france , other foreign-born : 13.3 % * both parents foreign-born : 6.6 % this is more frequent that the eu average . 
  france has being doing better than average work with the integration . 
  and i would say that the uk has done a very bad job . 
  i ca n't find data for uk . 
   why ca n't they just get student grants from their countries of origin ? 
  what student grants ? 
  we have different levels of welfare and benefits in the eu . 
  we do n't have student grants in spain and we need to pay part of the cost of the college education , from $ 1,500 to $ 2500 the next course . 
  when i was studyingit was from $ 600 to $ 1500 , that was before the austerity hitted spain . 
  we have still some scholarships but they have had a lot of austerity . 
   this way at least the spanish government is relieved of a debt that it should n't owe . 
  no , sorry . 
  it 's not like that the bailout counts as public debt and deficit . 
  but , the bailout only can be used to bailout banks . 
  for public services we still nee to use the bonds markets . 
  the deficit without the bailout was 7 % of the gdp and with the bailout is 10.6 % of the gdp [ source ] ( http://www.elidealgallego.com/articulo/economia/el-rescate-a-la-banca-eleva-el-deficit-de-espana-al-10-6-el-mayor-de-la-ue/20130423044330124663.html ), 
  the forecast for spain : [ spain 's economy will flatline in 2014 ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/07/09/inenglish/1373382482_032153.html ) * originally predicted growth in spain of 0.7 percent for 2014 , the imf is now predicting a 0.0-percent rate . 
  * maybe we should do a general thread . 
  we ca n't have a thread for every country . 
  the uk forecast is better than i expected . 
   will add 200 million kroner to the 19 billion kroner annual cost of the student grant programme . 
  is it a storm in a teapot ? 
  we 're are talking about a 1 % of the budget . 
  if you are into that i have something to tell you about spain , and in lower level france . 
  those banks have retrieved enought public money . 
  the spanish bailout agreement only allows to use the funds in the financial system . 
  it 's fucking great , a bank that robbed ten billions to their clients with a weird preferencial shares scam is retrieving billions of the eu ( edit : these millions must be paid by the spanish tax payers in the future ) . 
  and the people that commited the crime are n't paying anything . 
   you ensure that they go via the proper channels what are the proper channels ? 
   as someone who will be probably voting in sweden for the next ep election +1 edit : the situation in spain is also similar . 
  nobody seems to care about the eu parlament . 
  however , nobody knows what will be voted . 
  it 's expected that the people will use the election to protest because the president and most of the members of the government are involved in a corruption affair and in illegally financing of the spanish pp . 
  but the social-democratic party is also full of corruption and the leader is the same who lost the elections less than two years ago . 
  we have three millions and half of empty homes and an aging population . 
  in addition , the former immigrants are fleeding some of them with unpaid mortgages . 
  we are going to be cheaper than detroit . 
  it 's popular among tax evaders . 
  are you answering seriously to a ( bad ) joke ? 
  barcenas is a member of the ruling party . 
  his problem is that he is in jail . 
  and he has information that he is using to change that . 
  stop the charade . 
  you are england and conquered lands . 
  and , what country calls himself united kingdom ? 
  that 's not a name , that 's a description . 
  sorry , but your links says this :  the grant is given regardless of the product and its final destination . 
  the eu gives founding to raise the [ toro de lidia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_fighting_bull ) . 
  not for the bullfighting itself . 
  however , we raise these bulls for traditional festivities . 
  there is also a secondary meat usage , but there are better breeds for that . 
  however , they are n't only for bullfighting . 
  we also use them for [ novilladas ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/novillada ) , [ san fermin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muzabjyejbu ) , [ other traditions ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa_apn5csx0 ) or [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/nsfigxoljcw?t=2m8s ) . 
  i do n't that eu cap is being exactly missused . 
  all the money is for raising the animals . 
  the bullfighting activities are getting the money from the spanish government . 
  i have hope , but i am also scared . 
  the tangentopoli destroyed the corrupt democrazia cristioana , but it also brought berlusconi to power and therefore , the two worst decades of the recent history of italy . 
  and the current spanish situation is very similar . 
  ** spain ** the usual stuff : corruption , r&d cuts , corruption , unemployment , corruption , education cuts , corruption , san fermin , corruption , catalan independentism , corruption , food banks problems , corruption , bad polls for the cronies ' parties , corruption ... 
  some details : * luis barcenas , aka luis el cabr\u00f3n , the treasurer of the spanish pp that was sent to prison recently has filtered more information to the press . 
  he has made clear that the president of spain knew everything and that the party has being getting funds ilegally the last 20 years .

  but an anonymous philanthropist has offered 70,000 euros to pay the enrolment of 50 students in public universities .
