  the spanish government would need to increase his budget for them as compensation , but instead of that spain applied also austerity to that .

   would n't our money be far better spent on the future we are talking about spain . 
  our future plans are tourism , bullfighting and gambling . 
   stuff like research and education that 's where austerity is applied . 
  if the new law passes the budget for bullfighting and tax deductions are going to increase . 
  about the research austerity . 
  [ brain drain and budget ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/adb56dfe-d40e-11e2-8639-00144feab7de.html ) * government spending on r&d has been cut by 40 per cent since 2009 , even though spain 's r&d budget already ranks far below that of other european countries . 
  * [ not so much a brain drain as forced exile ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/05/20/inenglish/1369050837_208748.html ) we are firing researchers , not only not-replacing the retirees like greece . 
  * people like nuria mart\u00ed . 
  the 33-year-old is just one of those directly affected by the government 's 31-percent ( 1.4-billion-euro ) cuts to r&d between 2009 and 2012 . 
  mart\u00ed was fired from the prince felipe research center ( cipf ) in valencia in 2011 . 
  she has just signed off on one of the most important works on stem-cell research in recent years at the oregon health & science university , in the united states , where she now works . 
   portugal , spain , greece and italy before the financial crisis had one major thing in common , they all have very low ratio of new businesses and startups that are founded yearly . 
  and you are wrong . 
  and the country that creates more businesses in 2010 was france . 
  however , i can call this business creation rate bullshit . 
  it 's mostly construction workers and spain has been leader in the [ business death rate ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b7siown.png ) . 
  the eu does n't have that data in their website but i read that spain was also leader in business death in 2011 . 
  and more business were started in spain than in germany . 
  but they did n't created jobs in the long term . 
  why ? 
  we are one of the countries with the biggest death rate in business . 
  90 % of the business close in a year with high loses usually . 
  why is it happening ? 
  i ca n't answer that but you do n't say two big problems that we have in spain : * if a client does n't pay he wo n't have any problem . 
  you can go to court and in 4 or 5 years the government will do something , perhaps . 
  i do n't know how to fix that . 
  it happens in all our judicial system , we are sending bankers to jail for crimes that commited before the euro . 
  who am i kidding ? 
  [ we give them pardons . 
  ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c7dee9b6-1764-11e1-b20e-00144feabdc0.html ) * business cartels that have agreements to protect themselves from competence . 
  i would say that this calls for state intervention . 
  however , it happens in regulated and non-regulated sectors . 
  when , the sector is regulated they buy the politicians . 
  we need independent and non-corrupt regulators . 
   for crying out loud , it was not too long ago when the was spiegel article [ 1 ] about italians flocking to berlin to start their companies there . 
  and spaniards , and i want to remind you that spain had lower taxes than germany before the crisis . 
  in addition , it is n't exactly like that usually . 
  you move to other country where is demand for workers with your skills . 
  after some time you got some connections , reputation and savings you can start a business . 
  source : i am spanish software developer in stockholm . 
  a friend of mine , that was living in here since 5 years ago , has started his own business here recently . 
  i do n't work for him , i work for his former employer . 
  remove burger from premises . 
  however , our governments are becoming more authoritarian and less democratics lately . 
  it 's not the same level as franco , but it 's increasing . 
  most of the laws are passed by emergency procedures by the government . 
  like the last two labour market reforms . 
  the government has taken over the public tv and removed the restrictions for doing whatever they want . 
  are this things happening in al europe ? 
  are your politicians removing the checks and balances , and concentrating powers in the executive branch ( because austerity or some bullshit like that ) ? 
  i ca n't stop being worried everytime that somebody talks about construction as a strong sector . 
  i ca n't trust any recovery that involves the sector that got 3.4 millons of empty houses in spain that are n't used at all . 
  2 million homes for sale or rent if anyone is interested . 
  i can give you some reasons : * all our cinema and tv are spanish , catalan , galician or basque . 
  * spanish is a very big language , with more native speakers than english . 
  almost everything is available in spanish . 
  * before a education reform in 1973 the main foreign language avaible in the education system was french . 
  it 's hard introduce a language in a country where almost nobody studied or knew anything . 
  * english is a germanic language . 
  it is harder for us than for germanic people . 
  * the education is focused in gramar and reading not in listening and speaking . 
  * i started to learn english when i was 8 years old . 
  i do n't when other countries start to study english , but i think that the earlier the better . 
  in addition , english has vowels and sounds that we do n't have . 
  i spell in the same way sheet , sit and shit . 
  i am trying to get better , but this is actually very hard for me . 
  however , if you have this problem you are speaking better than most of the spaniards . 
  latvian jokes ca n't into fun , only repetitive boredom . 
   are there many younger people that have little or no knowledge of english ? 
  most of the youth does n't speak english in spain . 
  you need to check [ this ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=ds22a34krhq5p_#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=edp_b9_pc_gdp&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:non-eu&amp;idim=country:es:se&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=es&amp;dl=es&amp;ind=false ) sorry , i am talking about spain again . 
  but you talked about the south . 
  i want you to see two things : * spain had a balanced before the shit hitted the fan . 
  you can check the debt to gdp rate . 
  * the * austerity * does n't seem to balance the budget . 
  i think that the government was overexpending when we had a balanced budget . 
   why promise things that one does not do for getting the money . 
  everybody knew that they were lying , but we gave the money anyway to protect our banks and the other troubled countries . 
   who is then ? 
  the eu ? 
  they can try to appoint a * dictator * like they did with monti in italy .
