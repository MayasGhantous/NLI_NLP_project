   without the population participating . 
  without * part * of the population participating . 
   and , the people have to stop just blaming the government , they have to deal with themselves too . 
  are they paying their taxes now ? 
  the people that was paying taxes before are still paying taxes . 
  the ones that did n't pay their taxes before are n't paying know . 
  nobody did anything to fix that and i do n't see the troika asking for it . 
  do you need to understand that most of the people does n't have the opportunity to do a lot of tax fraud . 
  they retrieve their salary , unemployment benefits , or retireement pensions in the bank and the government knows everything about that income . 
  most people only have the opportunity to commit tax fraud with real state operations and small construction works in their houses . 
   do not know what you mean by that sentence . 
   btw , define austerity to me , what do you mean , exactly . 
  how many % etc is austerity to you ? 
  is it austerity to balance a budget ? 
  the problem probably is that austerity does n't mean the same for everybody . 
  i have been told that austerity is selling a public building by 5 million euros to some crony and signing an agreement with him to pay one million euros per year as rent to use the building . 
  does that balances the budget ? 
  you would find amazing all the bullshit that they call austerity . 
  however , i think that we can agree in calling austerity to apply cuts to the budget , firing public servants , selling public resources , ~ ~ and giving bailouts to the banks ~ ~ . 
  i think that it was the initial meaning . 
  you do n't know what the mediterranean governments are calling austerity . 
   where have i spoken about spain btw ? 
  nowhere , it 's me . 
  it 's what i know better . 
  i use spain to tell examples of corruption and missuse of public resources , because spain is my country . 
  but the greek government is very similar to the spanish government . 
   frankly , when they could reform they refused to , and now they , according to you , can not . 
  how convenient , then they never ever have to reform , i am saying that the governments are n't going to fix the problems . 
  they do n't want . 
  and seriously , the eu is going to stop the bailout if greece does n't sell a public company that is profitable . 
  they are n't asking for independent regulators , judicial reform or for more governmental transparency ( and that 's really needed in greece ) . 
  they are requesting : budget cuts in public services , lower salaries in public and private sector , privatization of public companies and a more regresive tax system . 
   why do n't you make them fire the inefficient ones ? 
  how do you that ? 
  because my politicians are still [ hiring the leaders of the young party members ] ( http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2013/07/01/catalunya/1372702693_464902.html ) in fake jobs and firing researchers . 
  where you will apply austerity ? 
  * do you think that spain should apply austerity to the cern membership payments ? 
  because [ we are doing that . 
  ] ( http://mag.digitalpc.co.uk/olive/ode/physicsworld/landingpage/landingpage.aspx?href=uehzu1dvzguvmjaxmy8wns8wmq..&amp;pageno=mta.&amp;entity=qxiwmtawma..&amp;view=zw50axr5 ) * do you think that spain should apply austerity [ to cancel research ] ( http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2013/06/17/paisvasco/1371464978_006896.html ) ? 
  * do you think that we should apply austerity to education and [ put our kids crowded containers as school ] ( http://www.diaridetarragona.com/noticia.php?id=1498 ) ? 
  do you think that we are going to fix our public administrations if you force us to do budget cuts ? 
  that 's not gon na happen . 
  most ruling spanish politicians would prefer to let the population starve to death that stop robbing . 
  we reduced the number of public employees in 300.000 . 
  almost 10 % of the total . 
  and , it went as expected . 
  the cronies kept their jobs , and great people lost their jobs . 
  and half the employees of the public r&d system have lost their jobs . 
  the maximum number of students per classroom has been increased a 20 % . 
  health care centres have been closes . 
  thousands of nurses have lost their jobs and are emigrating . 
   but i think spain is still quite alright when it comes to its gov ' why do you say that ? 
  where are you from ? 
   , and people are pretty critical towards the powerful . 
  but , we do n't do anything besides bitchin ' around , and some demonstrations . 
  wait !, 
  i did something , i emigrated . 
  they can be eat by humans , and they are . 
  i said that there are better breeds . 
  i think the report counts all the money that goes from the eu to the * toro de lidia * , but we will keep raising bulls for the other traditions anyway if the * proper * bullfighting is forbidden . 
  i give you this point . 
  nobody will raise cattle ( for food ) as they raise the * [ toro de lidia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_fighting_bull ) * there are better breeds for that . 
  we also use them for [ novilladas ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/novillada ) and other [ traditions ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa_apn5csx0 ) or [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/nsfigxoljcw?t=2m8s ) edit : i think that [ san fermin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muzabjyejbu ) is famous . 
  yep , i already posted a source [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1hhm1m/china_launches_official_investigation_into_eu/cauj1m5 ), 
  * we reckon that no less than 571 $ million are spent annually by different tiers of spanish authorities , and no less than 129.6 $ million by the european union -- in this case , basically through common agricultural policy programs . 
  * [ source ] ( http://www.greens-efa.eu/fileadmin/dam/documents/studies/2013-5%20bullfighting%20subsidies%20report.pdf ) the author of the report is from catalonia and supports the ban of the bullfighting . 
  but , i think that you can trust his sources . 
  but , what happens is that they fire doctors , school teachers , firefighters and researchers . 
  however , their cronies keep their * jobs * . 
  it 's what 's happening in spain at least . 
  the number of consultants , members of boards of public companies , employees of weird public companies is as big as 5 years ago ; but the total number of public servants is 300,000 thousand lower , like the troika asked . 
  they increased the number of kids per classroom [ a 20 % ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2012/04/15/espana/1334517724.html ) edit : they should appoint a dictator like they did in italy with monty , if they want it to change . 
  if you tell now those reforms that might generate growth and are requested by the troika would be great, 
  why the conditions do n't include `` you should try to get economic growth '' ? 
   unemployment has hit a record 27 percent and greeks have lost about a third of their disposable income at an average as a result of bailout-imposed austerity policies . 
  maybe we should start to worry about the economical situation and stop asking for more austerity . 
  lol . 
  it 's supossed to be a been . 
  i do n't know what happened . 
   hardly an explanation for why france still is one of the biggest receivers . 
  where are the most populated rural areas of europe ? 
  what country has the biggest farming sector of europe ? 
  spain has being retrieving some european farming founds . 
  the biggest retriever of spain is the house of alba . 
  they retrieve more than the total salaries paid by the house . 
  the current head is the richest woman of spain . 
  the primary sector and the food industry in spain need a big modernization process like the one that france has had these years . 
  and france has used the founds better than us . 
  they modernized they farms actually . 
  an example : france is exporting milk to spain . 
  the european founds have been an extra income for a lot of farmers in spain and used mostly for modenization in france . 
   god knows what in spain and portugal . 
  i forgot to say that the spanish government is giving also founds to the bull fighting , most of the business in the sector are losing money because the people is losing interest in it . 
  the government is using european farming founds , cultural founds ( it 's a good of cultural interest ) , cheaper tickets to retirees and free tickets for school kids . 
  the last needs a [ link ] ( http://www.hoy.es/v/20120519/toros/eventauro-repartira-entradas-colegios-20120519.html ) . 
   at what date is france rural area developed ? 
  rural france is more developed than never , but it 's less developed than urban france still . 
   when is spain going to be a net contributor ? 
  never , how would that happen ? 
  have you seen our economy ?
