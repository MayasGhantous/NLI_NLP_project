  our demographic figures ? 
  our rampant corruption ? 
  how stupid are our budget priorities ? 
  we built the second biggest [ high speed rail network ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high-speed_rail_by_country#route_kilometers_existing_and_under_construction ) with the bubble money . 
  and we try to keep that while education is having the biggest cuts in absolute numbers and r&d in relative numbers . 
  edit : bonus projects : ghost airports , highways to nowhere , museum cities , formula one circuits , calatrava buildings , theme parks ... `` ser\u00e0 per diners '', 
  i am going to be naive . 
  why are you saying that ? 
  can you hear the reporters laughing ? 
  the sound is too low in that video . 
  translation : p [ president ] : let 's see , one and one and we leave . 
  r [ reporter ] : president , after the latest controversies or complications that the minister of education has had with his education reform and with the grades for the scholarships , i would like to know if you are still keeping your support to the minister . 
  and also , i want to ask you if you think that the entrance in jail of luis barcenas is a positive event for the citizens . 
  p : the second ... already such . 
  laughs from reporters . 
  p : and in regards to the first , see ... 
  some context : the minister of education is very unpopular . 
  his popularity is 1.76 / 10 , the lowest in spanish history . 
  that 's due to that education is retrieving the strongest austerity , the government is passing another education reform ( 7th in 30 years ) that does n't fix the problems of the education system ( but increases the power of the catholic church in the public education ) , and he is creepy . 
  luis barcenas is the corrupt treasurer of the pp ( conservative party ) who had 60 millions in offshore accounts and was one of the most powerful men of the party and spain the last 20 years . 
  he handled the laundry of the money of the conservative politicians and the conservative treasury . 
  like boardwalk empire , but with construction instead of bootlegging : ghost airports , illegal urbanizations , highways to nowhere , museum cities , formula one circuits , calatrava buildings , theme parks ... spanish transcription : p [ president ] : a ver , una y una y nos vamos . 
  spain : * barcenas ( the nucky thompson of the spanish pp ) went to jail . 
  [ link ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/06/28/inenglish/1372448374_748632.html ) * president of the catalan pp has a prosecutor confident that gives her information about a prosecution at least ( probably more ) .

  the popularity of the institution is lower every week ( 3,68 / 10 support in the last official poll ) and a new corruption affair , influence peddling or tax fraud is discovered every week .

   three days without food and are currently living in the home of his lawyer in madrid . 
  they are going to go court :  the council bautista filed a complaint for an alleged crime of neglect . 
  and the government offers a welfare program to long-term unemployed families of 426 euros , but the living wage for a single person in the metropolitan madrid is like 900 euros . 
  but , they lost the money when they were evicted from their home because the peoplo withou fixed address ca n't retrieve welfare . 
  and you ca n't rent a room and eat with 400 euros . 
   if other people want to drive a porsche , it 's just not your business . 
  but , the pollution that their cars generate is my business . 
   fair regulation to achieve progress is to have emission goals per weight unit . 
  i would prefer emission goals per passenger . 
  if you need to move less weight you use less fuel usually . 
  the luxury cars can reduce fuel usage using lightweight materials . 
  your suggestion does n't take care of that . 
   public transport should be good enough for everyone . 
  public transport 24 hours ? 
  public transport connecting all the populations ? 
  good luck with that , but that does n't seem very efficient . 
  why nobody talks ill about [ luxembourg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secretariat_of_the_european_parliament ) ? 
  luxembourg is the country that gets more from the eu and it 's the richest country in the union . 
  if the smaller cars are more efficient , maybe people should use smaller cars . 
  gib oil money !, 
  ! 1 do you think that this will happen ? 
  you forgot spain . 
  it has a swiss guard and a corrupt bank . 
  is n't your country in a very bad situation ? 
  i think that you are from romania and i would n't say that romania is doing ok . 
  the ~ ~ new politburo ~ ~ troika will work to end the suffering . 
  it 's of happy day . 
  i love living in sweden . 
  the spanish ruling party was funded illegally and all the leaders retrieved undertable payments , but the president is n't prosecuted . 
  it seems legit . 
  this prosecution is for tax evasion of the millions that he got without any explanation . 
  if he had said that he got the money from the lottery like the president of castellon he would n't have the current problems . 
  btw : a corrupt treasurer handling everything ( the official version ) . 
  welcome to boardwalk empire !, 
   bottom line : ireland will be fine , just give it time . 
  will the problems solve by themselves ? 
  why ? 
  it does n't seem realistic . 
  the british taken over gibraltar when the modern spain was founded . 
  the different kingdoms had a dinastic union with different governments before the house of bourbon , like the kalmar union . 
  the union also included southern italy and some other european territories . 
  i need to see somebody beating my president . 
  i do n't want gibraltar anyway . 
  we are angry with the english due to the sea pollution , fiscal heaven , and the territorial seas dispute . 
  rajoy restarted this discusion to distract the population from the spanish internal situation . 
  but , it 's not very effective with the current mess . 
  rajoy is 58 years old and in a bad shape . 
  cameron is 46 years old and does some exercise at least . 
  the [ most similar thing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he_l-tshqsi ) that rajoy does . 
  local government declarations :  deputy spokesman indicated that the consistory notified the toledo minor service and consequently filed a complaint . 
  `` we are talking about a crime , not talking about something else edit : recently , [ the european court of human rights declared ilegal the policy of taking over the children of the poor people and said that spain should give them welfare ] ( http://www.theolivepress.es/spain-news/2013/06/20/mother-mistreated-by-spanish-courts/ ) . 
  the article is n't neutral , but i ca n't find a neutral source in english . 
  the same for this new . 
  [ istanbul-wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istanbul ) : * the city forms one of the largest urban agglomerations in europe *, 
  let 's hope that the ioc agrees with you and somebody else gets the games . 
  i am very concerned because with istambul riots and with japan being also in a weird financial situation and the nuclear accident spain has serious posibilities . 
  however , who cares ? 
  my government will rob and/or misspend the money anyway . 
  what about the growth ? 
  spain passed a labour market reform with an emergency decree by the government . 
  most of the laws are being passing as emergency decrees . 
  it 's happenning in all the countries that retrieved a bailout at least . 
  i am not sure about the others . 
  edit : the government also take over the public tv with an emergency decree to apoint a new direction , that was n't chosen by a qualified majority by the parlament . 
  the new direction was personally chosen by the president . 
  edit2 : [ the procedure ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/real_decreto-ley ), 
   doubt it , have you seen the stats for some african countries ? 
  do you want me to dig up some starving african countries who has received steel baths from imf .
