  a former chief of the business owner association has been found guilty of : * of deliberately driving the viajes marsans travel business he jointly owned with gonzalo pascual into the ground and was ordered to cover the debts of the company , which amount to over 400 million euros . 
  * * illegally stripping the travel business of its assets , including revenues from the sale of tickets . 
  * http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1giv69/former_chief_of_the_spanish_business_owner/ in this case the company owner of the factory evicted the company that handled the factory because did n't pay the rent . 
  i have been checking details and the administrator of the business was iker gimenez bret\u00f3n and the adminstrator of the company that own the property was jatsu gim\u00e9nez bret\u00f3n . 
  i think that they are brothers . 
  the company does n't have enought assest for that . 
  if you are a business owner in spain the factory is property of a company without employees that rents the factory to the company that has the employees and the bussiness . 
  it 's a standard trick to keep the assest in case of bankruptcy . 
  the workers are going to be paid by the fogasa ( government ) when the liquidation ends . 
  and the government applied austerity to the fogasa payments : * the amount to be paid has been reduced recently by rdl 20/2012 of july 13 , and is now the amount obtained by multiplying twice the daily minimum wage , with bonuses apportionment , by the number of days salary pending payment with a maximum of one hundred twenty days .

  the company owes 7 millions to the basque government , 3.6 millions to the local government and 7 millions to the social security . 
  and the social security has the highest priority when it comes to getting paid . 
  i was n't putting down your concerns or you . 
  in addition , i think that you should be angry ; 14 % is too high for a first world society . 
  an unemployment like that has very bad effects in a society . 
  are you angry with a 14 % unemployment ? 
  that 's cute . 
   where can i find more information about spanish republicanism ? 
  you ca n't . 
  there is n't an organized republicanism . 
  the most vocal republican organization is the anticapitalism alliance iu ( united left ) . 
  there are some pro-republic regional parties , but they are a minority . 
  the spanish congress has 350 members , and the republican are a small minority . 
  these are the republican parties ( republicanism is a small part of their projects usually ) : * united left : 8 deputies . 
  * amaiur ( basque coallition left-wing and separatist * `` izquierda abertzale '' * ) : 7 dep * basque nationalist party ( basque conservative [ foralismo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fuero#basque_fueros ) ) : 5 dep * erc ( catalan party social-democratic and separatist ) : 3 * icv ( catalan ecosocialism and sovereignism but not independence ) : 2 dep . 
  * bng ( galician left-wing federalism ) : 2 dep . 
  * cha ( regionalist left from aragon ) : 1 dep . 
  * compromis ( valencian left-wing ) : 1 dep . 
  total : 29/350 . 
  the spanish socialist workers ' party supports the monarchy nowadays . 
  you can find information about these parties in internet . 
  it 's sad , there is n't a powerful republicanism in spain . 
  however , [ spanish royal family 's popularity at record low ] ( http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2013/05/03/301640/spanish-monarchy-losing-popularity/ ) : at 36.8 percent . 
   what are their goals ? 
  that 's easy . 
  a republic . 
  you can send this : [ the large pajares tunnel sinks : 10 years and 3.2 billions euros ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/06/07/actualidad/1370625907_891032.html ), 
  the demostration was childish , but there is a serious confrontation about train plans . 
  the government is cutting regional and local services ( and near everything ) , but they 're are building more ave. [ some context ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/06/17/inenglish/1371490306_708435.html ) * rajoy was accompanied by prince felipe , who noted that spain has more kilometers of high-speed rail than any other european country . 
  * * a less-welcome guest was alicante mayor sonia castedo , who is caught up in an ongoing corruption case . 
  * * the madrid-alicante link cost 1.92 billion euros , 230 million of which came from the eu . 
  spain has the second-largest high-speed rail network in the world after china , at 3,100 kilometers .

  this behaviour is not acceptable for a head of state . 
   how it 's available . 
  edit flair . 
   why i am against monarchy . 
  it 's an unfair way of selecting a head of state . 
  and it 's very difficult to remove a corrupt king like the current . 
  we do n't have ellections . 
  i did n't vote to him . 
  i am sort of left-wing also , but in a capitalist context . 
  it 's not about regions , it is about ideology . 
  these are opposite national flags and anthems for the full country . 
  besides that we have other strong identities , but i was n't talking about them : * catalan * galician * basque however , spain does n't have totally accepted national symbols .

  and how you do that ? 
  we do n't speak the same languages . 
  most of the spaniards do n't speak english . 
  people expect to settle when they have kids , nobody wants to change the school and language constantly . 
  housing property makes it more difficult . 
  people got training in jobs that have been outsourced or are n't needed any more ( construction bubble ) and nobody is going to hire somebody for a position new to him over a certain age . 
  edit : i am interested in answers to the question . 
  and if too many people leave spain , the country is going to be unable of paying the pensions and public services for forever . 
  the answer to that can be an european social security and fiscal union , but it is n't going to be popular in the north . 
   main reason seems to be weak executive branch / poor fiscal oversight of regions i do n't know about other countries but in spain the pp has all the powers : * they have an absolute majority in the parlament . 
  * they control the general prosecutor , the supreme court and the constitutional court * the president can pass * emergency * laws by decree , like the last labour market law or the law that he used to take over the public tv . 
  * they control the central bank , the markets supervisor , the telecomunications supervisor , and the others * independent * supervisors . 
  * the government can suspend the self-government of the regions or change their powers . 
  do i need to remember that the current ruling party was founded by a former dictatorship member that supported the current constitution ?
