  and the president when spain passed the current constitution had been a general secretary of the conservative single party that we had in the dictatorship . 
  and the reply from the wsws is n't better . 
  i have the feeling that nobody did a real research about the spanish situation , they only read some editorialized bullshit . 
  i am tired of reading in conversations people talking without knowing anything . 
  yes , i confess that i do that sometimes . 
  but , i am tired of discussions where both sides are wrong . 
  however , the consumers can spend the savings in products produced in other places . 
  a fta has winners and loser even if the agreement increases the total economical activity . 
  and the labour does n't have the same mobility as the products and services . 
   that is ok because the money saved can be spent on something else that creates more employment again . 
  is that employment created where the jobs where destroyed and the companies went to bankruptcy ? 
  we will find a way to make the pigs the unique losers . 
  i would prefer that to the corrupt pieces of shit that have power over the company . 
  cesar alierta is on trial for 10 years due to [ tabacalera case . 
  ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/caso_tabacalera ) telef\u00f3nica has in the payroll plenty of politicians who did favours to telefonica when they ruled . 
  * [ eduardo zaplana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eduardo_zaplana ) * [ rodrigo rato ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/04/telefonica-rato-idusl5e9c4a1r20130104 ) * [ i\u00f1aki urdangarin ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/08/28/uk-spain-urdangarin-telefonica-idukbre87r0vt20120828 ) * carlos l\u00f3pez blanco * alfredo timmerman they had in the board a 2 retired social-democratic politicians ( narcis serra and javier de paz ) , but [ they left the board ] ( http://www.cincodias.com/articulo/empresas/telefonica-internacional-saca-consejo-ejecutivos/20120208cdscdiemp_5/ ) after the conservative landslide in the last elections, 
  about him  chaired the spanish confederation of business organizations ( ceoe ) between 2007 and 2010 edit : he did almost the same with [ air comet ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/air_comet ) before . 
  i think that this person should be more know because the people like him are the main reason of the bad reputation of the businessman in spain . 
  he is nice sample of the stereotype of the spanish business owner : * he created his businesses with government support and/or public money . 
  * he behave without caring about the laws , the laws are for the plebs . 
  * he robbed his own companies . 
  * he was the speaker of the business owners association , instead of defending that the government should make easier to start a business he fought to protect current businesses from competition . 
  * he broke the employee rights , but he was protected by his political connections . 
  * he did n't care about the efficiency of his business , their business were based in political connections not in having the best products and services . 
  * he paid the electoral campaign of the previous regional president of madrid esperanza aguirre and other politicians . 
  that was his real business model . 
  this is good news actually . 
  he is currently in prison also , this was for the civil responsibilities . 
  ~ ~ new romania ~ ~ spain is the euro no 1 . 
  and the gap is growing very quickly . 
  but , i am angry with my country . 
  i understand , however i am more concerned about a free trade agreement with a country like the india that with usa . 
  but , i am also concerned about the imposition of the american economic and social model . 
  you may concede me that if i am worried about the effects of a fta with usa i am more concerned about a fta with india or china . 
  i am from spain , we do n't care about portugal . 
  yes , i was thinking more in an fta with india than with the states when i was commenting . 
  the eu is n't a state . 
  a company ca n't require you to join a union to employ you . 
  if a company does that in spain they will have to replace the ceo and get a big fine . 
  europe is n't a state is a continent . 
  europe includes sweden and moldavia . 
   the vast majority of us citizens life extremely comfortable lives and tend to have quite a bit more disposable income than their european counterparts . 
  you accept having poverty levels higher than countries with half of your gpd per capita . 
  with the higher crime rates , lower social movility and the other problems that come with that . 
  why ? 
  do you think that we are going to accept to live in worse conditions than our parents ? 
  yes , it can happen . 
  but , you should n't expect it to be easy . 
  if that happens we are going to have riots , massive emigration , strikes , demostrations , political change . 
  yes it 's the stuff that we are having right now . 
  i hate the concept of race to the bottom . 
  we should try to get a living standard better than our parents . 
  i 'm not going to live worse than my parents . 
  i do n't plan to let that happen , sorry . 
  edit : i do n't think that we can win that race to the bottom . 
  yes , we got some car manufacturing from belgium , but we lost more industy every month than the production that ford moved to spain . 
  ( joined ) if you want to read about factories closing in spain you can find hundreds of results in spain . 
  like these : * http://www.pv-magazine.com/news/details/beitrag/aleo-to-close-spanish-module-factory_100007283/ * http://www.twowheelsblog.com/post/5892/yamaha-to-close-factory-in-spain * http://motorcyclecompensation.com/blog/derbi-motorcycles-spain-closes-factory, 
   although sometimes i did n't want to be part of the union , but it was required you ca n't be required to join a union in spain . 
  i do n't understand how that works . 
   i 've never had a full time job without benefits ( health care , dental care etc. . ) , and paid vacation . 
  public health care does n't cover dental care in spain . 
  i have n't a job that offered dental care in spain or any benefits that were n't mandatory and i am softwar developer . 
  i live in sweden now , i can say that it 's different . 
  ford is moving the production of the belgian factory to a factory in valencia . 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/24/us-ford-genk-spain-idusbre89n0d620121024 ford did n't open a new factory . 
  however , they are going to hire some people , the government is giving them money if they do that . 
  there is a extreme income inequality . 
  40 millions of persons without health care and 40 millions on food stamps . 
  and some of them with jobs . 
  i understand what you are saying that we should give up maternal leaves paid vacations , health care , collective agreements and progressive taxation . 
  but i do n't like it . 
  i do n't want where we are going . 
  if your limiting factor are the wages romania is going to be more interesting anyway . 
  and i think that the salaries are n't going to fall to that levels . 
  with the median salary in romania you ca n't rent a bedroom in most of spain and in romania there is people prividing for a family with that salary . 
  the salaries are falling and the factories are closing anyway, 
  some of us are afraid of a free-trade deal with a country a developed and competitive country without mandatory maternal/paternal leaves , prison workers , shorter vacations ... who cares about cheaper goods if your living standard is worse ? 
  or since my point of view free trade with another country more competitive that us . 
  however , thet are n't like the tea party , they 're francoist friendly . 
  i 'd add [ qu\u00e9 ! ] ( http://www.que.es/ ) . 
  it 's bullshit period . 
  and the people that got their jobs due to the corruption will keep them and the ones that did the work will be fired . 
  that happened in spain with my regional tv , they hired external companies to do the work paying to them more than the previous wages . 
  they should try sweden . 
  emerging ? 
  that 's wrong . 
  submerging market is more appropriate . 
  i do n't think that we are equeally tolerant . 
  italy is more conservative and has more machismo . 
  [ the activity rate in women ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zholnbw.png ) is a strong signal . 
  the influence of the catholic church is weaker than you would expect . 
  the conservative people usually say that are religious in the polls ; but they do n't go to mass , divorce and support gay marriage and adoption . 
  the catholic church is a big company still . 
  they have : * the biggest private school network , usually paid by the government * the biggest private health care network * the biggest network of private universities * a radio and a tv channel . 
   would this have been the case if they where more off them or if they were of different nationalities ? 
  i do n't know . 
  it depends of the ideolegy of the jury and if the jury is a bunch of fools . 
  his strategy was trying to pick the most conservative juries as posible and say that all the acusations were a social-democratic conspiracy ( they were ruling the country and the government picks the prosecutor ) . 
  there are acusations of bribes of course .
