  he is going to be prosecuted again , this time is another corruption affair that involves the son in law of the king . 
  however , the government is conservative now , we will see that amusing situations when the prosecutors ask for freedom to the accused and the popular accusation ( an attorney paid by a public servants union probably ) ask for prison without bail . 
   citizen juries chosen by a lottery the most popular president of valencia was judged by a jury . 
  he was declared inocent : * with five votes in favor of the defendants and four votes against them * http://elpais.com/elpais/2012/01/26/inenglish/1327558855_850210.html http://imgur.com/ixuzcso, 
  it seems a terrible business for us . 
  where i need to sign ? 
  wtf ? 
  we are n't lying with that at least . 
  nobody likes to report these figures . 
  maybe other countries like italy or germany ( hartz iv and minijobs ) are hidding unemployment , but ** our unemployment rate is real . 
  ** i think that is important to compare employment rates and unemployment rates : the [ difference in employment rate ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ebd0a/eurostat_employment_rate_in_europe_2012/ ) between italy and spain is small . 
  however , the difference in [ unemployment rate ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z8o7pt6rd5uqa6_#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:sa&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:eu:non-eu&amp;idim=country:es:it&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=es&amp;dl=es&amp;ind=false ) is very big . 
  no , before the last raise in prices it costed $ 700 to $ 1,400 euros after the raise between $ 1,000 and 2,000 http://textbooksandpassports.com/2012/04/23/tuition-fees-in-spain-set-to-rise/ that 's the first year . 
  and the government applied austerity to the scholarships . 
  the fp ( vocational training ) fees are decided by the regional governments and they are raising . 
  they were free in some regions some years ago . 
  which is my party ? 
   the psoe appointed left wing ones . 
  edit : the psoe was n't able to do that they needed to deal with other parties . 
  they take over the central bank and the ombudsman . 
  the pp has an absolute majority . 
  you need to go to the eighties to see the psoe with as much power . 
  it 's a bad designed system . 
  finally , everybody was talking ill about hungary because they did constitucional reforms that allowed that the government take over the central bank . 
  the eu criticised hungary due to it but spain has been always like that . 
  i live in sweden and this country has a welfare that is almost equivalent to a basic income . 
  yes i am paying 50 % of my salary in taxes ( including everything ) . 
  despite that , sweden has a high employment rate : [ employment rate in europe ( 2012 ) ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ebd0a/eurostat_employment_rate_in_europe_2012/ ) . 
  meanwhile , in spain we do n't have a welfare state as understood in northern europe and we have a very low employment rate . 
  swedes want to work anyway and spaniards ca n't work anyway . 
  and we are talking about basic income . 
  and there is malnutrition in europe . 
  i am talking about spain . 
  we are n't a third world country , officially . 
  [ campaign launched to combat child malnutrition in barcelona schools ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/06/06/inenglish/1370533752_367381.html ) and we are a food exporter country . 
  there is too much food , but not everybody eats . 
  i am talking about hunger in the eu in countries that export food . 
  edit : if you want to discuss this , the link [ has been sent already . ], 
  ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1fzr5t/effects_of_the_crisis_campaign_launched_to_combat/cafhx4y ), 
  pp controls supreme and constitutional court , general attorney , parlament , government , central bank , even the ombudsman . 
  edit : and the court of auditors . 
  [ a brother of the previous conservative president is in the court ] ( http://www.sueldospublicos.com/texto-diario/mostrar/85870/el-hermano-de-aznar-manuel-aznar-sera-miembro-del-tribunal-de-cuentas-y-cobrara-14-pagas-de-8041-euros-brutos ) it 's full of party members . 
  and nobody seems to care . 
  spain , this says a lot : * [ campaign launched to combat child malnutrition in barcelona schools ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/06/06/inenglish/1370533752_367381.html ), 
  * what about our 27 % unemployment ? 
  * what about our demographic crisis ? 
  * what about our economy ? 
   innovation and automation drives the division of labor and will create new and exciting possibilities . 
  like a country that produces more food than it 's needed and there are undernourished . 
  it 's not like the spanish government is going to care about the proposal . 
  38 % of the unemployed are without benefits . 
  and they have announced that are going to apply austerity to the scholarships . 
  there are thousands of students because they ca n't pay the public college tuition . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/galicia/2013/06/07/mil-universitarios-gallegos-pueden-expulsados-impago/0003_201306g7p8999.htm ) currently there are n't enought scholarships for all the families without resources and the large families and others are priorized . 
  and the government plans to cut another 50 % . 
   okey , nationalists bad , that is something that almost everybody agrees . 
  [ not my government ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/spain-s-partido-popular-blocks-motion-to-denounce-franco-1.1402043 ) the current ruling party was founded by members of the dictatorship . 
   it would be hard to accept a memorial that would also cherish the memory of those people . 
  the monument that the government is trying to remove is one to the international brigades ( foreing vounteers ) . 
  and from the previous source : * last week , the pp government 's senior delegate in catalonia awarded a diploma to a group representing the blue division -- spanish volunteers who fought for nazi germany during the second world war . 
  the ceremony drew fierce criticism from other parties . 
  * edit : i use the 2nd republic flag because i want a republic for spain , not because i want the 2nd republic back . 
   so , three groups of people , or two groups of people ? 
  +4 groups of people . 
  * nationalist : they had n't internal fights but there were divided between the ones that wanted a traditional conservative government and the ones that wanted a fascist government . 
  the second group was backed by hitler and mussolini but the first group was stronger and before the end of the world war ii the militar dictator moved the fascist out of the government . 
  * pro democratic-republic group . 
  very divided : izquierda republicana , uni\u00f3n republica , partido radical , erc , half of the psoe , orga ... * socialst-communist revolutionists : pce , part of the psoe and part of ugt ( union ) . 
  * anarchists & poum ( trotskyist ) * pnv : very conservative basque party . 
  they supported the republic . 
  the republic promised high self-government to the basque country . 
  and you can see more factions between different groups . 
  talking about only one revolutionist group is an error . 
  the socialist & communist alliance killed more anarchist people that right-wing people . 
  a famous example is [ what happened in barcelona . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barcelona_may_days ), 
   nationalization ... can you at least provide impetus for nationalization of banks ? 
  because to me it seems like the state is taking over capital , and that is a definitely a red flag . 
  the current spanish constitution says the same . 
  all the wealth of the coutry in all the different forms and whatever its ownership is subject to general interest . 
  http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/constituci%c3%b3n_espa%c3%b1ola_de_1978:_09 the government plans to use this to snach some lands that sheldon anderson wants to build eurovegas and the owners do n't want to sell . 
  the social-democracy and the crony capitalism are compatible with a constitution like that . 
  the government that passed that constitution did n't want a soviet-like system , but they were left-wing . 
   it was also a decisive force in the spanish civil war , organizing worker militias and facilitating the collectivization of vast sections of the industrial , logistical , and communications infrastructure , principally in catalonia and it happened ~ ~ after ~ ~ during the civil war . 
  there were attemps before but they were stopped with blood . 
  the republic killed anarchist militants that revolt against the government in 1933 with a left-wing government . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/benalup-casas_viejas_revolution ) the spanish version is better . 
   the spanish republic was heading towards becoming a socialist country citation needed . 
  the republic had a right wing government . 
  a soviet-like system did n't have enought support . 
  there was a revolution in 1934 with a conservative government and the revolution failed . 
  spain had a govenment that was elected at free elections and a rebelion replaced it with a right-wing dictatorship . 
  edit : yep , i know that the republic had a lot of problems . 
  and not all the supporters of the republic were pro-democracy . 
  but even the conservative basque party pnv ( motto `` god and old laws '' ) supported the republic . 
  btw , the lobby is called pah ( plataforma de afectados por la hipoteca ) , it translates to platform of people affected by the mortgage, 
  swedish unemployment : * nationals : 7.2 * citizens of another eu member state : 9.4 * citizens of a country outside the eu : 30.5 it 's similar in belgium . 
  however , there are n't big differences in italy . 
  that 's very interesting also . 
  no , but he has been in office less time than our president and our situation is worse .
