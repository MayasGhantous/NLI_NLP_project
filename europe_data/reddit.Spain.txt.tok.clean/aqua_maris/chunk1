  4 hours `` continue this great conversation when you get home !, 
  it 's a rather easy debate in christianity , actually . 
   the key question is : `` why did god create lucifer ? '', 
  -  the omniscient god must 've known what would happen with the angel and all consequences after it , seduction of adam and eve , evil and everything that follows . 
   the answer is : `` we do n't know ! '', 
  -  the basis of faith . 
  we do n't know why any of that happened . 
  we choose either to believe or not to believe . 
  you ca n't apply human 's logic to god observed in this way . 
  thus we apply human logic to human related stuff , and choose to believe in god who has the answer ( or we do n't ) . 
  thing is , western culture and the way it unfolded has very difficult time accepting `` we do n't know '' as an answer . 
   hence religion is being shunned more and more . 
  i do n't have trouble with that . 
  i 'm a religious person myself and i can completely understand why people are often negative about it . 
  calling turbofolk music is like calling murder an art, 
  correct . 
  many people were called `` imperator '' before augustus , caesar being one , but augustus basically changed the meaning of the word , making it the one we use today . 
  `` imperator '' was a title given to many before augustus as well , especially in military - whoever held the `` imperium ''  still , augustus was the first to restrict a title of imperator solely to princeps ( himself ) .

  just one important correction to your comment -  if you leave longer then 184 days a year in russia if you ** \\* live ** longer , because `` leave '' is basically the opposite meaning ,

  re\u0107i goes : * reknem/re \u010dem , rekne\u0161 / re\u010de\u0161 * , itd . 
  it 's rarely used in present tense . 
  the word you were looking for with `` lasting '' verb is `` stative '' verb , as the closest english counterpart to `` glagolski vid '' is a division to stative and dynamic verbs .

  too bad this will probably go unnoticed - it 's a very good article . 
  oh no you did n't, 
  did somebody mention inquisition ? 
  sheep . 
  my uncle said some incredibly wise words years ago when this refugee wave started . 
  while everybody was talking about camps , preventing them to come or instituting legal systems to help cope with them on the border , he just said : `` in the very end , all will come down to this - are you ready to shoot a mother with a child that is going over that fence ? 
  because if you 're not , then ultimately you 're not stopping immigrants to come . 
  i do n't think we live in a society that will shoot - so better start preparing your countries for them instead of useless talk , because they will come here . '', 
  oh , yes , yes , of course , memes !, 
  please take those shows away , in anyone 's name, 
  `` for where two are gathered in the name of paella , garrof\u00f3n is in the midst of them . '',

  as somebody who 's lived through horrors of yugoslav wars , you do n't even know how infuriating is this erdogan 's comment for me . 
  i ca n't even explain it properly . 
  yes , sure , dutch regiment in srebrenica did n't do the best thing - but to blame them for what happened ?!, 
  with comments like this , people are reminded on the great injustice that took place and that is still taking place every day - and they are once more given the foreign forces as a scapegoat . 
  yeah , sure , the dutch massacred all those people . 
  erdogan is using the pain and sorrow of thousands - and mind you , religion is also important here , people tend to forget the ties between turkey and bosnian people - combining it with fear and hate to prepare a homemade hand grenade he will either throw at somebody or let it explode in his own hands . 
  you do n't just invoke or joke with things that have happened in balkans bloody history - especially in srebrenica . 
  it tends to end badly . 
  and to use the cries and destroyed lives of thousand mothers in building your dictatorship regime - to accuse your new ` enemies ' , it makes me really angry . 
  nice wordplay in that dub though :'),

  brits ca n't learn spanish mate . 
  i know one guy that 's living here for 25 years , is married to a spanish lady , and he 's still struggling . 
  closest to spanish what i 've heard from a brit is [ this guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_robinson_\\ ( footballer \\ ) ) , who speaks solid , but his accent is still pretty awful .

  your language is semitic . 
   yes , many words are loaned from italian , even french and obviously english , but the grammar is hardcore semitic !, 
  as they should be !, 
  actually used ?!, 
  they 're all over the city !, 
   our islands that 's the problem, 
  it did feel nicer obviously . 
  still , you know what pro- means in adjectives in croatian - it ultimately tracks back to indoeuropean * per - - compare `` prohladno '' , `` prozra\u010dno '' ... the accent is on the difference between the full state `` hladno '' and not-so-quite `` prohladno '' . 
  it 's the same with `` sinje '' and `` prosinje '' , 
  that 's the source of my opinion about constitutional reform .
