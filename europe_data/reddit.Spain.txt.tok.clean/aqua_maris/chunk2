  dialogue is key anyway , and both sides extremists seem to eagerly avoid it . 
  that 's completely fine . 
  however , we both know one-side referendum ( that would be binding ) is illegal and will only spur more troubles . 
  i would personally vote yes if asked should catalonia get independence . 
  but the rest of spain must be asked in some way . 
  that should be solved with constitutional reform ... 
  well , there is always [ torrente ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120868/ ) . 
  everybody should watch first two movies of torrente to fully understand how spanish society works . 
  also , for my other country - not film or tv show , but there 's an italian comic called [ alan ford ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alan_ford_\\ ( comics \\ ) ) that was insanely popular only in former yugoslavia ( still is today ) . 
  it 's probably the best thing i 've ever read together with asterix . 
  pure joy , would recommend to anybody . 
  because there is no source on it . 
  there 's no similar word in other slavic languages either . 
  it 's probably delivered from ` la\u017e ' as the month of changing , as the weather is ` lying ' and changes constantly ( still probably of course , but that 's the most popular opinion ) . 
  that 's correct ( probably ) , but the `` translation '' would n't be `` ashen one '' but rather `` the one that is partly blue-gray '' , read more [ here ] ( http://hjp.znanje.hr/index.php?show=search_by_id&amp;id=dl9nxhc%3d ), 
  wonderful . 
  thank you for the valuable grammar lesson  just to sum it up for me once more : \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0446\u0430 - normal speech , no copula , nominative , \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0446\u0435\u0439 - same thing , just using the verb , instrumental , \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0446\u0430 - she 's the embodiment of beauty , deep philosophical sense , nominative . 
  i see . 
  beautifully put < 3, 
  of course . 
  it 's also used regularly in the past tense . 
  is that right ? 
  russian language does n't have copula .

  i 'm just telling you why croatia felt aggrieved about it or rather why is it perceived so trecherous today . 
  rijeka was n't the most problematic part for croatia in the compromise - that belongs to finances . 
  croatia was n't independent in financial sector because the budget was shared and forced to abide by tangent . 
  it meant croatia got to keep 2.2 m forints from their taxes ( and that sum could only be changed every five years in mutual agreement ) , which was really unfairly low . 
  it was changed 5 years later allowing croatia to keep 45 % of their taxes ( it still was n't enough to cover the expenses ) , but you can still see why the compromise was so unpopular . 
  [ here 's a nice song to it !,

  third monarchy part consisting of slavic nations would 've maybe saved the empire , but it 's impossible to know , especially with that little ww1 . 
  i for one welcome our atlantean overlords, 
  persistent and irrational fear of russel crowe 's movies . 
  holy shit all this time i believed we were talking about oil for cooking, 
  hey sir , it 's me , your cat, 
  are you sure it 's that much ? 
  i do n't believe uk will be able to claim assets from the things that already existed when they joined . 
  i think that we 'll probably see a part of that sum reduced from the said 60bn , reaching a reasonable deal for the both sides . 
  or eu could let uk keep the benefits from the current budget until 2020 and that 's it . 
  we do n't exactly know how long will the whole process last . 
  spain . 
  all hail alberto . 
  for them , they are . 
  they just did n't learn negative numbers yet . 
  if rivalries only count between countries or parts of a country , we 'll take the rivalry with you catalonia .

  once a year eleven judges elect a town 's ` mayor ' by carving a sign on the wooden stick ( rabo\u0161 ) - two candidates are presented by two different sides on the stick , and the judges use knives to carve a line on the side of their man of choice . 
  [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvbwifdtvjy ) hum is one of the only places in the world where you can drink ` biska ' , a mistletoe brandy . 
  the recipe it 's made with actually originates from the celts that remained in istria ( or so it 's said ) when slavs first came there . 
  they 're turning the frogs gay ? 
  there 's a fantastic website where you can read most of them online in english --  http://www.omgbeaupeep.com/comics/asterix/001/ my favourite comics , ever . 
  the wit and jokes combining fantastic and accurate history of the roman empire together with the mood in france at the time , and everlasting and joyful , harmless humour . 
  an absolute must in my opinion . 
  i counted only a town of \u0160ibenik . 
   brodarica and dubrava hardly count in my book , you might as well count zaton or srima at that rate . 
  but if it makes you feel better , i have no complaints . 
  it 's my favourite town anyway . 
  \u0160ibenik has 30k :'), 
  root is very similar in croatian as well . 
  the exact source of the name is unclear , but theories range from `` the place next to a lot of sticks '' ( * \u0161iba * ) to a person deserving to be punished - or a place where that punishment would take place . 
  just one legal thing not connected to your discussion - uk 's constitution is n't ` not written ' - that would mean its sources are not available in the written form , which is not true . 
  correct term is ` uncodified . ', 
  it 's not available in one large , single written document . 
  and make it rule the waves !, 
  that 's right , 
  ** porqu\u00e9 ** = basically a noun , meaning reason , motive ** por qu\u00e9 ** = why ** porque ** = because ** por que ** = for what , for which ( something like that ) * examples : * todo en un idioma tiene su ** porqu\u00e9 ** . 
  ( everything in a language has its ` why ' . 
  ( why do you ask ? ), 
  ** porque ** me interesa . 
  ( because it 's interesting to me . ), 
  ( it 's an interesting motive that made you ask = because of which you ask . ), 
  oh no , there are bosnia and herzegovina and kosovo . 
  nah , i think everything 's ok , as far as i know they do n't just take you , first they smash your head into keybodgjishbovamihb oaapwmipmaiwpmh89348934p9awpa, 
  you mean porquenolosdos.jpg, 
   five-third of the parliament you mean 2/3 ? 
  and 1/3 is required for a vote of no-confidence ? 
  that is a question that spurs a very long and complicated historical discussion . 
  it involves sociology , anthropology , history and biology . 
  best pieces to read are : freud : totem and taboo ( the standard edition of the complete psychological works of sigmund freud , vol xiii ) , spain : the westermarck -- freud incest-theory debate : an evaluation and reformation '' ( current anthropology 5 ( vol . 
  28 ) ) , l\u00e9vi-strauss : the elementary structures of kinship there are others as well . 
  all of them agree in basically one thing - if you `` allow '' incest on a general basis , society tends to fall apart  so , society creates `` incest taboo '' and laws and consequences follow . 
  you can imagine it yourself - man and a woman have a male child , child grows up , wants to mate with his mother , kills the father ( or vice-versa , of course ) . 
  it tends to create some mess . 
  sexual behaviour should be regulated to a some degree -  thus incest taboo , and also marriage . 
  of course you may !, 
   because i see marriage as an institute of regulating sexual behaviour in a society . 
  preventing incest is one of the key features in that aspect , thus i do n't agree with it being allowed at all , let alone in an institute which i see designed to do the opposite thing . 
  it 's up to each society to decide whether they want that or not . 
  i do n't , but i have no trouble accepting it as a result of democratic discussion and process . 
  no , it 's just a question to reveal that the purpose of marriage is a political concept . 
  marriage is a discriminatory institution - not in a `` un-democratical '' sense , but in a literal and grammatical one - we as a society `` allow '' or `` deny '' certain people to marry each other . 
  you ca n't marry if you 're 10 years old , you ca n't marry your closest kin , you ca n't marry ( in some countries ) persons of the same gender . 
  why ? 
  because , historically , marriage serves two purposes - to regulate the sexual behaviour in society ; and to regulate creation ( and upbringing ) of the new society members ( aka children ) . 
  brother and sister generally ca n't marry each other because their offspring would be genetically deformed , right ? 
  so we do n't want new society members from them and they ca n't marry each other .
