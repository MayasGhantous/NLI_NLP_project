  gay marriage is historically shunned because it counters both things - ca n't create new members of society and promotes `` weird '' and `` unnatural '' sexual behaviour . 
  please note that the times and people 's opinions change and with this comment i 'm not saying we should n't allow gay marriage ( i 'm pro gay marriage myself `` despite '' being religious etc ) , i only want to note two important things : 1 . 
  marriage should be regulated by the people 's wishes . 
  it should be purely political decision , led by the following - what do we want to achieve with that institute ? 
  what do we want from persons married to each other ? 
  how do we regulate their rights ? 
  do we want to make it more or less `` firm '' ? 
  is it based more on economical or family circle ? 
  do we protect the rights of people not allowed to marry each other enough ? 
  unfortunately , marriage is too often looked from an ideological standpoint , where religion and irrational behaviour takes over . 
  i have nothing against gay marriage being not allowed if it 's done for comprehensive reasons and nation-wide debate where political and social implications are being discussed . 
  although being `` political '' , marriage is a very specific institute - people are not robots , they are beings of very strong emotional behaviour and they will not behave rationally when confronted with questions about their beliefs and things they hold important . 
  every institute concerned with family is usual like that ( working in family law , speaking from experience ) , and society thinking that gay marriage should n't be allowed should not be deemed `` primitive '' , shunned or looked down upon in any way . 
  with people changing their opinion on the institute of marriage as such , we see different cultures moving towards the opinion gender should n't be an issue in it . 
  however , if some nation wants to `` protect '' that institute ( although that word is very wrong in that sense , especially with how many marriages fail today ) , it 's their choice . 
  very rational and `` futuristic '' , but at the moment impossible , because marriage and partnerships in default include deep personal feelings , position in society and social security . 
  and where those things mend , people tend to get very irrational :d even , as you say , `` generic partnerships '' in many countries have very interesting implications that serve to protect people 's sense for social justice . 
  remember that the european culture is build on that very sense , as well as the principles of welfare and woman/children protection !, 
  it 's a political question - marriage is a political institution and it depends on what do you want to propagate in its laws . 
  my profession is family law so i have these conversations on the regular basis . 
  my favourite question is - do you think brother and sister should be able to marry each other ? 
  and why ? 
  do you think brother and sister should be able to marry each other ? 
  i stared at your comment for 20 seconds ( have n't watched the video yet ) before realizing you 're talking about schwarzwald :') `` black forest '' sounds so wrong . 
  oh of course , i did n't want to imply anything about catalonia or especially scotland as i never went through the act of union , only about sfry . 
  that decision ( that sfry underwent `` dissolution '' instead of cro and slo `` separating '' , what was promoted from serbian and montenegrian side ) was the basis of many claims and relations in the future and it 's important to use the right terminology when talking about that  also , very good points about scotland and catalonia , and differences between the two ... now if only general public in catalonia understood that !, 
  not related to this , but one very important clarification to your post  yugoslav republics ( namely croatia and slovenia ) did n't `` separate '' - the process yugoslavia underwent in 90ies is classified as `` dissolution '' by badinter arbitration committee and that was ( still is ) very important in defining legal relations as well as successions . 
  very different to separation !, 
  spain said many times they are not opposed to scotland remaining in the eu if everything is done according to the international law ( proper constitutional independence referendum followed by normal accession to the eu ) !, 
  and if you do n't have friends , there 's no abuse !, 
  ha ^ ha ^ ha ... sigh, 
  yup , and they call slovenia * slovinsko * . 
  not confusing at all !, 
  you ca n't conquer russia . 
  because there will always be more russia . 
  in the end , russia conquers you . 
  this time they 're friends with france though, 
  i agree with you , but people want stability . 
  if somebody can vouch them eu is going to be there and cover for the brain-drain with some of its policies , they 'd probably accept it easier . 
  this way , it only looks countries listed above are losing all of their potential and the future looks gloomy and unsure ( see brexit ) .

  only avid nationalists are angry , for linguists it 's rather interesting to research differences , histories and causes of distinction between the variants of the language , 
  it 's called asymmetric intelligibility  [ here 's the full list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mutual_intelligibility#list_of_partially_mutually_intelligible_languages ), 
  damn , it looks like scotland will be left out in this case as well, 
   anyone wishing to hear how indo-europeans spoke should come and listen to a lithuanian peasant antoine meillet  very important linguist . 
  his works are absolute canon if you 're into slavology or armenian . 
  upvoted , britain and eu should be close friends and there 's nothing wrong with you wanting out of the union if you do n't like the way where it 's headed . 
  just pay your bills first :p, 
  why do n't we have a party here like it 's 1974,

  imagine telling somebody in the 70ies that two reigning blocks in the world 40 years from now would be `` usa and russia '' against `` united europe and china '' . 
  you really think it wo n't get devastated ? 
  then the ` defence force ' has to be divided from the eu itself , being only the military alliance ? 
  because you can leave nato in a year if you do n't like the way your troops are used . 
  so will spaniards or maltese be willing to bleed in poland in case of russia attack ? 
  what do you think ? 
  ( i 'm asking seriously , not rhetorically , i love conversations about eu military ), 
  as i speak croatian sometimes i like to check how honest the shopper is when i try to buy something , especially jewelry . 
  i had one guy some five or six years ago trying to sell me a necklace for 100 $ and then lower it to 200 kn ( 25 $ ) when i asked him in croatian . 
  now write it 100 times . 
  if it is n't done by sunrise , i 'll cut your balls off . 
  i was making an example , friend  if you 're interested in learning more about `` the great divergence '' i was referencing to with an example , i recommend these because i 'm in hurry and ca n't write that much at the moment , and you seem interested in history : clark : `` a farewell to alms '' wong : `` before and beyond divergence '' huntington : `` the clash of civilizations '' ferguson : `` civilization : the west and the rest '' grinin : `` great divergence and great convergence '' pomeranz : `` the great divergence : china , europe , and the making of the modern world economy '' stay strong !, 
  but that 's why europe got all the progress after the middle ages first . 
  competition and constant drill of wars . 
  imagine columbus in china , trying to sail towards east : `` your royal highness king of all china , yangtze and taiwan , can i get some ships to discover new lands ? '', 
  aaaaand it 's over . 
  meanwhile in europe , if portugal do n't want to finance it , spain maybe will * to show those bastards who 's the real deal here * . 
  or england . 
  or france . 
  you get the point .

  shhh man , whose side are you on again ? 
  do n't mind us meanwhile , we 're just here per a ofrenar noves glories i paella, 
  also it 's not actually `` mute one '' ( although it could mean that today ) in a literal way , but more as a `` barbarian '' , as a man who does n't speak slavish language . 
  you better get ready again in that case . 
  speaking from experience ? 
  you do mock the general illustrissimus heaven general too much ... 
  just wanted you to know that your comment made my day < 3,

  i thought it would be [ this ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/48uoqdkrajhxg/giphy.gif ), 
  it is sindarin , or grey-elven , the tongue of beleriand , the noble tongue , in lotr often referred to simply as ` the elven-tongue ' ,

  thank you for your constructive answer and independent critical thinking  yes , that 's the core and the most important thing - education , education , education . 
  that 's the thing we need and lack and have to fight for . 
  but what my point is that one ` free-speaking ' idiot can delude and do damage that 100 educated critical thinkers ca n't undo . 
  it 's not an easy discussion . 
   rights exist as long as there is a violent force behind them . 
  right on point . 
  so , we as a society have to decide which rights do we want to enforce . 
  it 's called progress . 
  everybody talks so nicely about democracy , and then when majority of people of some country reject , say , same-sex marriage or fully equal woman rights ( or whatever , do n't get me wrong as i 'm huge proponent of both of those ) , they are shunned and called backward society .
