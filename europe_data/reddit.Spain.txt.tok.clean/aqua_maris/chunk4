  what i want is somebody to give me a picture of a possible future society that does n't need ` progress ' as it achieved everything it can . 
  the image we strive for . 
  and who decides that ? 
  what if i do n't like it ? 
  what if you do n't like it ? 
  well , let 's set a goal for our society !, 
  what do we want , how do we want it to exactly look like ? 
  we want democracy where everybody 's equally important ? 
  that does n't work with capitalism . 
  how will you explain corporate leaders their vote counts just as much as your below average uneducated person ? 
  prevent them from wanting to grab power ? 
  just tell me what we actually strive for , what to we aim to achieve , and i 'll be all for it . 
  why is freedom of speech valued higher than a right of liberty ? 
  yet nobody will find controversial breivik 's confinement in prison after he murdered those people . 
  words do n't kill people , guns do ? 
  fight words , and you wo n't need guns . 
  europe should know that . 
  waiting for things to escalate to the point of physical harm works only if everybody is allowed to own his own gun . 
  right to life and liberty are basic human rights as well . 
  yet we still have ( in some parts of the world ) death sentence and ( in all parts of the world ) prisons . 
  the point is , society defines boundaries of behaviour and relevant punishments for crossing them . 
  i 'm a lawyer , i know something about those things   although tbh i do n't think i have much of a right to comment here , as i 'm not even european . 
  so what ? 
  your opinion does n't matter less because of your country of origin . 
  courts . 
  same as for general defamation and slender . 
  as society evolves ( and hopefully people start to understand each other better ) we can change the restrictions on the freedom of speech . 
  see notable case [ lingens v. austria ] ( http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng# { `` dmdocnumber '' :[ `` 695400 '' ] , `` itemid '' :[ `` 001-57523 '' ] } ) as an example where the echr ruled in favour of a journalist after his perceived libel of the austrian chancellor . 
  hopefully , in the future we can decriminalise similar crazy moronic violence calling lunatics expressing their opinion in which they call for holy wars against somebody . 
  as for now , i 'm strictly against it . 
  depends , are you going to the coast or inwards ? 
  i disagree . 
  how are people to ` see for themselves how moronic their views are ' ? 
  you presume all people are open minded , critical thinking , educated and able to juggle various information to make their judgment . 
  they are not , they are easily manipulated , fed with lies , guided towards hatred and used for somebody else 's goals . 
  do n't get me wrong - i desperately * want * all people to be able to just shrug off and laugh if somebody propagates moronic views like ` homosexuals should be stoned ' , ` jews out , they are killing and destroying the purity of the german folk ' , ` earth is flat , wake up sheeple ' and so on , but history showed time and time again that they are n't . 
  denmark prefer lego anyway . 
  good ... good, 
  good luck whatever you decide and do !, 
  not fueling you or whatever , just stating that spanish and italian are not hard to learn . 
  yeah , fuck sand , it 's coarse and irritating and it gets everywhere . 
  well then it 's a good one because sentence looked absolutely legit !, 
  [ mfw ] ( https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/a/a5/chatwheel_ay_ay_ay.wav ), 
  in spain people sometimes refer to french as gauls ( el galo ) . 
  reddit is a weird place . 
  it 's a 600 actually  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zastava_750, 
  and how do we define who is catalan ? 
  wake up sheeple, 
  do n't worry , the city is safe , you might feel some ash in the air however . 
  just to add onto your post - romanian borrowing words so old from albanian language could point to illyrian languages being some sort of a bridge towards romanian - that 's also not confirmed yet , but is a solid looking hypothesis . 
  almost zero preserved words from illyrian languages really hurt and it 's possible we 'll never know how much those languages influenced each other . 
  * i even eat hamburgers every day bruh *, 
   the siege of vienna in 1683 is one of tolkien 's main inspirations for pelennor fields when the winged rohirrim arrived, 
  does n't mean anything , agram is * probably * derived from : ** za + gr\u0119b\u044a ** ,  ** iz zagr\u0119ba **  ** iz agr\u0119ba ** , in german ** aus zagr\u0119b **  ** aus agr\u0119b **  ** aus agramb **  ** aus agram ** . 
  songs in croatian dubbed cartoons ( both short and long ones ) used to be an amazing piece of work , until recently where ( i guess ) somebody stopped giving a shit . 
  think of it as ` pahaya ' as the first ` a ' is long . 
  also , y as in ` rey ' , not ` ayuda ' . 
  it 's discriminating to refuse to serve beer to one particular nationality , is n't it ? 
  they serve beer to everyone , but it looks like only brits make chaos afterwards , 
  ` r ' is a vowel though , 
  c o l d l a n d, 
  she was sent victorious . 
  there 's an interesting legend about how maria theresa spread the potato across the monarchy - it was a pretty nutrient and cheap product , and after a series of famines in the mid-1700s , maria theresa declared it should be grown wherever possible . 
  however , people were n't eager to do it , so she thought of a different plan and planted potato on a big royal field , surrounded it with fences , wires , guard dogs and armed soldiers . 
  naturally , people soon started to wonder what plant is it that it 's so heavily guarded and kept away from the ` common folk ' . 
  as things happen , some of them were brave enough to sneak in and steal the plants - and , believing it to be some sort of ` royal potato ' , they started to plant it themselves . 
  it 's just a legend , but a very funny one !, 
  there are micro holes in the karst basis of the lake . 
  the sea refills it through these holes , however the lake is much saltier and warmer than the surrounding sea . 
  salty water . 
  [ 16:22:35 ] oppressed russian minority detected !, 
  [ 16:23:11 ] c-y-k-a sequence request announced !, 
  initiate c-y-k-a sequence . 
  [ 16:23:58 ] c-y-k-a sequence initiated . 
  contacting local touristic guides . 
  [ 16:24:16 ] pinging sov - soldiers on vacation - programme . 
  local response required . 
  [ 16:25:15 ] soldiers on vacation successfully launched !, 
  c-y-k-a sequence will now commence . 
  usually , yes . 
  his death is a presumption that will be overturned at court -  murder . 
  mp = member of parliament 100 + majority is n't required , it 's just that theresa may wanted to consolidate ( increase ) her majority to avoid any potential hiccups along the road , plus it looked like labour party could be virtually destroyed ( they were in disarray , without a proper leader and course of action ) by calling this elections . 
  it heavily backfired . 
  yeah but bih uses both scripts so they have to do it to avoid confusion , no such problems in russia . 
  there is global climate change . 
  nigerian people will soon run out of food and turn towards europe after an inevitable wars that follow the lack of food . 
  similar to what happened to syria . 
  you did n't quote the whole song though !, 
  :d ( ... ) * i gledam more i gledam more zlato * * i gledam more gdje se k meni penje * * i dobro jutro ka\u017eem more zlato * * i dobro jutro more more ka\u017ee * * i zagrli me more oko vrata * * i more i ja i ja s morem zlatom * * sjedimo skupa na \u017ealu vrh brijega * * i smijemo se i smijemo se moru * -- * and i watch the sea and i watch the sea my precious * * and i watch the sea as it climbs towards me * * and good morning i say to the sea my precious * * and good morning sea the sea says * * and the sea it hugs me around my neck * * and the sea and me and me with the sea my precious * * we sit together on the shore on the hilltop * * and we laugh and we laugh at the sea * it 's an amazing song , as are many others by the same poet . 
  this one uses no punctuation ( that 's why you can see so many parts ` repeating ' , while they would be simply divided by commas in a regular song ) and plays on the rhythm of words full of vocals . 
  many people argue what it 's about - the sea , remorseful love , a child ( i 'm in for this one ) ... oh , the memories !, 
  thank you for this song from me as well , 
  it was 1527 , gave their lives on the steps to heaven, 
  if you 're referring to ` window ' then no , fenestra is a roman word of ( most probably ) etruscan origin . 
  as etruscan is ( again , most probably ) not indo-european language , it 's hard to connect these two . 
  fun fact - ` bint ' ( daughter ) is coined by adding semitic suffix * t to the word ` bin ' , meaning ` son ' . 
  compare osama ** bin ** laden . 
  everything is poetic if you try hard enough !!, 
  mostly above sea-level , for now, 
  serbs ( or croats or bosniaks ) are not a minority in bh .
