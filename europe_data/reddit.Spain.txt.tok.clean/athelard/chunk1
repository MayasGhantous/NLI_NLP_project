also when aliens insert anal probes into you . 
   xenophobically abused, 
  your 20th century president does n't help either, 
  i like it because it is subtle, 
  i agree , there are none . 
  some are more close knit than others though . 
  very romantic , but i disagree completely . 
  jewish people have historically cared first and foremost about jewish people . 
  that has not changed . 
  their ancestors would think them soft and weak . 
  old jews would have solved the problem by completely expelling / mass murdering the palestinian if they were in the same position of power . 
  the have never been saints , but then no one has . 
  iirc the partition on ireland caused a civil war more costly in lives than the original war of independence , decades of terrorism and constant ethnic tension in northern ireland . 
  i can see how the solution is not that enticing . 
  first of all : no , you rarely can . 
  second , on the few places the accept euros , they use a ludicrous exchange rate . 
  no more tatra mountains for me until you join , i do n't like to deal with changing money . 
  actually , i 'll just stay in the slovakian side . 
  factually correct and skewed as fuck . 
  rather engineered to make it look like the are talking about ukrainian army at first glance . 
  as factually correct as calling you a primate . 
  my previous comment already addresses that point . 
  i dislike putin like any of us , for most the same reasons . 
  that said , economically russia has been far more successful under putin than under his predecessors . 
  you need to understand that to understand why he is so popular . 
  only very recently has the russian economy started to suffer due to his interventionism . 
  have a look at [ this graph ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_kd#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_kd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:rus&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tdim=true&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) of russian gdp per capita since 1990 , the take off of russian economy on the putin years is evident . 
  that may not necessarily be thanks to putin himself , but that is how it is definitely perceived on russia . 
  so ... fuck him why ? 
  it is always the poorest , most rural and worse communicated part of any country . 
  that 's hurtful :( i guess my joke offended you very badly if it made you say something like that . 
  i 'm sorry for that . 
  i made great friends while living in the uk and most people i met there are wonderful . 
  ancient greeks already called them the british isles and i will continue to do so , while being fully aware that two separate political entities share the islands . 
  after living there for 4 years i call them britards ;-) jokes aside , circumstances are not the same . 
  the name british islands comes back a long way , and should have no implication on how they are politically divided . 
  `` what do you call people from the british isles ? '', 
  is a trick question and one that has no relevance . 
  the same way no one goes around calling people iberians . 
  more like finland could resit the soviet union and estonia could not . 
  my family is from extremadura , half are farmers , the other half doctors or nurses , but hey , thanks for crapping all over us . 
  i 'm sure that when hearing a negative generalization about catalunya you take it with a shrug and a smile . 
  dude , i respect your pro independece position , but what you say in this post is completely ilogical, 
  spain is sending manolo and his donkey . 
  it had its pros and its cons ... 
  i moved out eventually , but not back to spain . 
  i did n't plan to stay in the uk either ... and then i did . 
  people always talk shit about british food , but you had some hearty dishes that are super nice . 
  bangers and mash ftw !, 
   infrastructure , welfare , workers rights , these are better in spain than the uk  healthcare , education these are worse , but still sufficient  career prospects , average salaries these suck balls on spain , although they improve for the returnees , thanks to the international experience . 
  source : lived in both . 
  you did a pretty good job of ignoring europe for two years , 
  man , you should be programming the summary bots . 
  til ireland is not in nato, 
  nope . 
  that 's an inaccurate stereotype , that held some of truth only decades ago and on the south of spain . 
  we work more hours than the french or the germans for example . 
  the problem is that we are more inefficient and corrupt . 
  we do !, 
  it 's just that no one cares , 
  from more than 30 years a second language is mandatory in spanish schools , most of the time english is picked . 
  my fiancee manages quite well when we visit . 
  i 'd say in 30 % of the shops someone can speak english with her and 90 % on transportation . 
  i agree with your statement about health , and yet i 'm still pro-legalization . 
  criminalizing drugs fails to prevent its use , while regulation and education helps . 
  nice . 
  i had no idea of this system . 
  its great way to participate in the eu . 
  only if you pledge alliance to philip vi , king of spain and emperor of the holy roman empire :3, 
  i guess it is , it 's 2011 , although the crisis was already quite bad by then . 
  yes they can !, 
  there 's no deeps of human ignominy that they ca n't sink into , 
  46 % of portuguese people support the idea of forming a federation with spain . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iberian_federalism i would n't mind , but only if everyone gets a fair deal . 
  interesting opinion . 
  i think that what you propose would n't achieve anything , and that 's why they do n't do it . 
  it is never so simple as it is painted in a blog article of someone who clearly has an opinion about the issue . 
  i already had read the article on [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/disputed_status_of_olivenza ) before , and i think legally both the spanish and portuguese claims have merit , although the situation on the ground favours the spanish . 
  there is not such ambiguity on gibraltar , legally it is clearly british , at least the rock itself . 
  it is just awkward because it is very far away from britain itself , much farther than spain from its disputed territories, 
  lol why and why ? 
  except that nazis fucking hated your guts , and if the managed to conquer europe , would have gone for you next . 
  tierra in spanish . 
  sorry i just wanted to be part of the fun , 
  but what if your own kurdish region wants to join the new country ? 
  i honestly ca n't follow your logic . 
  are you saying that any political party can be guaranteed to win in a democratic election ? 
  or a party trusted by millions may choose a ridiculously inappropriate candidate ? 
  i do n't think you and i have a common logical ground to have any kind of productive debate . 
  yeah it is called democracy . 
  sometimes you get a leader you did n't vote for because , guess what , some other people did . 
  the main reason he is not know by the masses he 's because he did n't spend millions on advertisement like candidates on `` some '' countries do . 
  easy , the french oppose `` issues '' every now and then , the british do it all-the-frakking-time . 
  let me answer that in catalan : no , 
  wtf is going on in southern portugal ? 
  we have a winner !, 
  good point, 
  it is not a civil war just because the aim of both combatants is not to control the whole country . 
  it is a separatist war . 
  i would n't call it terrorism either .
