  housing prizes have dropped 30 % since 2008 and will still fall a lot more . 
  a nice flat in madrid could easily cost 1 million euros in 2008 . 
  it would * cost * that , but of course it was n't * worth * that money . 
  spain should seek further integration with latin america , where it would be one of the head countries and not in europe , where it does n't have a word to say and has to renounce to any kind of economic and political power of decision . 
  edit : expanding a little : i do n't feel culturally identified with other european countries . 
  even portugal , italy and france have so little in common with spain . 
  spain shares a language with 500 million native speakers , most of them located in countries of fast economic growth and where everything is yet to be built . 
  it 's easy to think we should want to stay with europe since it 's a more developed region , but here goes a sad truth : europe 's glory days are past . 
  latam and asia are the future . 
  ps : and to those downvoting , a counterargument would be welcome . 
  the king will likely resign in favor of his son felipe along this year or the next one . 
  felipe will probably lose support along his reign , but i think it will take a few decades before spain becomes a republic . 
  the second republic was the one defeated by franco 's coup in 1936 . 
  yes , they 're spain for all effects . 
  one of them : tabernas desert . 
  of course spain will have a boom in five years , but that volatility is exactly what is fucked up about spain 's economy . 
  [ this is spain 's unemployment rate for the last 40 years ] ( http://www.voxeu.org/article/why-spain-s-unemployment-so-high ) . 
  it is almost arid . 
  the iberian peninsula is filled with mountain ranges , so rain rarely gets very far in . 
  the only actual deserts of europe are in the southeast corner of spain . 
  there 's where the sahara actually begins . 
  spain may not living its best days , but calling us a 3rd world country is going too far . 
  it still is the 23rd country in gdp per capita worldwide . 
  for comparison , finland is the 15th : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_gdp_ ( nominal ) _ per_capita, 
  the term `` illegal immigrant '' is not generally usually used . 
  `` persona sin documentaci\u00f3n '' and `` persona indocumentada '' ( person without documentation ) are preferred . 
  `` black '' is acceptable , but the press usually prefers the term `` of sub-saharian origin '' . 
  referring other minorities , they say things like `` person of latin-american origin '' or `` person belonging to the gypsy ethnic group '' ( persona de etnia gitana ) . 
  iberia is no desert : _ (, 
  we are astonishing similar and we do n't really like each other . 
  to explain this : in spain the prosecution follows a strong hierarchy , which head is the state 's general prosecutor ( that 's his title ) , who is designated by the government ( yeah , no separation of powers ) . 
  judicature is not as controlled , but they of course suffer huge pressuring in cases like this one . 
  any of you remember judge garz\u00f3n and what happened to him ? 
  so , in this case , the judge ( of course not the prosecution ) has decided to charge princess cristina and now you have the actual prosecution defending her . 
  all this is such a joke . 
  you can imagine how spaniards feel about this whole governing class . 
  this all is gon na end badly , very badly . 
  and by the way , this judge career is ruined . 
  i would n't say they prove it . 
  to be honest i am basically quoting one of my former professors from when all the kosovo thing was still relatively recent . 
  saudi arabia wanted an independent kosovo so they could eventually join albania . 
  religious statistics show diverse data for albania , but apparently there 's an equilibrium between christians and muslims ( similar to what happens in bosnia ) . 
  kosovo 's population is more than half of albania 's and predominantly muslim . 
  albania + kosovo would be the only european country with a clear muslim majority . 
  in fact kosovo already holds that position , but it 's independence is not unanimously accepted . 
  check saudi 's actions following the independence of kosovo , like [ 1 ] ( http://kryeministri-ks.net/?page=2,9,2934 ) or [ 2 ] ( http://europenews.dk/en/node/23160 ) . 
  serbians having a hard time accepting kosovo 's independence is quite understandable . 
  do n't forget ( not you , but anyone ) it was imposed to the serbs from the outside , it was n't the result of an internal and progressive process . 
  saudi arabia and the usa wanted an independent kosovo and they got an independent kosovo . 
  and of course she made sure there 'd be several photos of it . 
  king 's son is smartly keeping a low profile so the people does n't relate him with all the corruption cases . 
  i would n't be surprised if he rejected his own family just to save his ass . 
  these people have been raised since they were born to have power . 
  they wo n't quit easily . 
  calm down , folks . 
  she wo n't be convicted . 
  they 're already looking for ways to change the judge for a more favorable one , remove evidence , etc. 
  no longer surprised about `` socialists '' like hollande reforming the labor laws . 
  meanwhile in spain , foreign football players have huge tax deductions because they 're considered `` international talents '' . 
  yep . 
  a deduction allegedly created to bring talented international scientists and artists , is mainly used so cristiano ronaldo pays less in taxes than me . 
  because they are the same . 
  exactly the same . 
  and that 's why real madrid and barcelona are what they are . 
  there may be a fundamental problem with the system but corruption and the resulting bad management has definitely played a * huge * role . 
  spain 's housing bubble was not a mistake and did n't simply `` happen '' . 
  it was designed and executed so a thin elite got richer than they already were at the expense of the average people , who massively bought houses under the constant propaganda ( specially from politicians ) that assured prizes would never drop . 
  up to 50 people they do n't . 
  spain has no claim over gibraltar , only over the surrounding waters . 
  when will the british/llanitos learn this ? 
  it 's not only because of the economy . 
  it 's the feeling that all your hard work , education and high taxes go to feed a caste of corrupted politicians , bankers , owners of the big energy and telecommunication companies and the royal family . 
  every day , we know of more and more cases of corruption involving these people , and how they never ever answer to the justice . 
  they are stealing directly from the pockets of the average spaniard , who is becoming poorer every day thanks to their management . 
  i 'd rather be paying my taxes in any other country . 
  i 'd recommend you the book * the protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism * , by max weber , the father of sociology . 
  they do . 
  it 's black , dense and sticky . 
  russia is probably bribing the people in charge of those decisions . 
  what 's with italians and romanians ? 
  besides the gypsies , romanian immigrants are usually polite , integrate well and pick the language fast . 
  i really do n't get the hate . 
  i 'm not gon na pretend in spain there 's no racism ( and specially casual racism ) against romanians , but torching cars ? 
  then you guys and flanders are next . 
   rage software oh yeah , i played and loved the jeff wayne 's war of the world . 
  i still remember their logo at the beginning . 
  in madrid yes , specially latin american places . 
  * rep\u00fablica argentina square * colombia street * rep\u00fablica dominicana square * paseo de la habana * bol\u00edvar street * per\u00fa avenue there 's also some neighborhoods where every street is named after a european city , but those are less centric and not as relevant as far as i know . 
  turkey , japan and poland as applicant to superpowers while china and russia become irrelevant ? 
  i just do n't see it . 
  japan will probably have less than 100 million by the end of the century and its economy is n't growing at all , poland 's population is also decreasing and turkey 's is n't growing that much . 
  i think you maybe assuming many of the games you play are american when they really are n't . 
  for instance the total war saga is british , paradox games are swedish and the assassin 's creed 's saga is french . 
  greece asking for reparations for the almogavars in 3 , 2 ... 
   do you have a lighter how come this kind of practices are so international ?

  there are general elections next december . 
  depending on who wins , it will be handled one way or another . 
  does it really ? 
  it seems both sides are reading the results like they see more convinient .
