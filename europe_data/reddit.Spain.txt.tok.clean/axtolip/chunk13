  cup have also said they wo n't give their vote to mas . 
  without them and the opposition of the others , he wo n't be able to be president . 
  the leader of cup has just said they wo n't vote mas for president . 
  without their vote , and the opposition of the other groups , they wo n't be able to form a govern . 
  i 'm not in spain so i 'm not watching tv , but has the cup talked yet ? 
  jxs\u00ed would declare themselves victors regardless . 
  we 'll have to wait to see what cup does . 
  they are themselves independentists . 
  but even together with jxsi , they did n't get 50 % of the votes ( 95 % currently counted ), 
  how did i suddenly got a whole army before the government finding out before and putting me in prison ? 
  specially if i have declared my intention of doing so before hand ? 
  what if i become a millionaire and decide to create my own army and declare secession ? 
  the government would find out and put me in prison . 
  same here . 
  applying the law ! = sending the tanks . 
  yeah , it was at the begging , while all the `` go catalonia ! '', 
  comments from estelada-flair guys were leading . 
  as far as i know it 's not clear and it seems that 's going to be exactly the situation . 
  jxs\u00ed have said they 'd go for it anyway , but afaik , the cup , which they 'll probably need , has said they 'd only support it if there is a majority also in votes . 
  yes , it will likely remain like this . 
  at the beginning jxs\u00ed alone had 78 or some other crazy number . 
  to give an explanation , jxs\u00ed ( turquoise ) and cup ( yellow ) are independentists . 
  absolute majority is 68 seats . 
  if jxs\u00ed gets 68 or more , they 've said they 'll declare independence . 
  if they need the cup 's seats , they 'll have to talk since cup have said they 'd support independence if the majority of votes , not seats , went for it ( some catalan correct me if this is wrong ) . 
  if jxs\u00ed + cup < 68 they wo n't be able to make it , since the other parties oppose it . 
  right know the independentists are at 73 with 10 % of votes counted , but seem to be decreasing as the counting grows . 
  it 's likely it will be close . 
  or ... you know , you could wait 1.5 hours to have the final results , not just some poll . 
  but ... why ? 
  where are you from originally ? 
  i thought you were spaniard . 
  as if no other country had to deal with constant existential threats . 
  now go and compare english history and geography with that of any other country . 
  twice absorbed poland maybe ? 
  maybe russia , the mongolian highway to europe ? 
  spain ? 
  the balkans ? 
  c'mon guys , you 've had it fucking easy . 
  dude , the whole world knows about you guys , with your cute koalas and badass kangaroos ... 
  that 's just a missunderstanding of what productivity means . 
  this is probably my most repeated comment on reddit , but productivity has little to do with how `` well '' or `` focused '' you work . 
  it 's a measure of how many $ you produce by hours . 
  germans produce many cars and machinery , which are expensive . 
  even the laziest german factory worker is more productive than the hardest working spanish waiter . 
  you were supposed to be having coffee while watching nature documentaries in `` la 2 '' like the rest of the non-working population was doing . 
  but now seriously , most international stores do n't close in the afternoon , specially in the city center . 
  nor do bars or cafes , so i find surprising you did n't find plenty of open stores in madrid 's downtown . 
  in spain , lunch is the biggest meal of the day , while dinner is usually frugal . 
  also , if you eat outside , there 's no way you 'll be done in 30 min . 
  i would, 
  so nordic . 
  virtually nobody goes home in the middle of the day to sleep . 
  most office jobs give between 1 and 1.5 hours for lunch . 
  however , some shops , usually family owned , close between 2 and 5pm . 
  again , this has nothing to do with sleeping or even `` because it 's too hot to work '' ( most places have ac ) . 
  it 's just that in spain there are n't many customers at that time , either because they 're working or because they already expect many shops to be closed . 
  in short , it 's just cultural . 
  edit : also , siesta simply means sleeping in the middle of the day , so it 's more or less the direct translation of `` nap '' . 
  it does n't really refer to the fact of some shops closing from 2 to 5 . 
  that 'd be called `` hora de la comida '' ( lunch time ) or something like that . 
  what 's with the queen in that pic ? 
  she looks so sad i wan na give her a hug . 
  so having education in catalan makes them `` a de facto independent state '' ? 
  that 's just dumb . 
  now i 'm gon na tell you why i oppose catalan secessionist : the rhetoric of catalan nationalism has been consistently victimist , blaming spain , the spanish people , culture and language of every single problem occurring in catalonia . 
  it 's straight forward demonization . 
  currently , there is a 50 % of catalans who have spanish as a first language . 
  how do you think they 'll be treated under a new state , which has based its very existence in demonizing spain ? 
  spain is not the richest country in the world , but it 's in no way poor and is stable and peaceful . 
  and these guys are willing to make us the balkans 2.0 . 
  but maybe you are bored with your life and would like to see that just because . 
   minimizing minorities how does spain do that ? 
  catalan is official in catalonia , valencia and balearic islands . 
  can you tell me where any regional language is official in france ? 
  nowhere . 
  in catalonia , education is 100 % in catalan , except for the spanish language lecture . 
  this is compulsory , even if you just moved there from the rest of spain . 
  now please tell me more about how we `` minimize minorities '' , which is fucking rich coming from ** a ** ** french ** . 
  specially in rostock ... 
  you are describing cultural cleansing . 
  is that what you defend ? 
  again . 
  the catalan law says every single lecture except spanish language one must be taught in catalan in every single public school . 
  you can bring franco from the grave all you want , or call me a dictator , but it 's you who are imposing your language over the half of catalans whose first language is spanish . 
  and still dare to talk of oppression . 
  in your educative system every single lecture is given in catalan except the spanish language class . 
  there is no work around . 
  even if you have just moved to catalonia from the rest of spain , your children will have to have 90 % of their lectures in a language they do n't understand . 
  if there is a language under harassment in catalonia , it 's spanish . 
  it 's weighted by the number of residents . 
  if i had to guess , i 'd say that 's likely tourists from australia are getting caught doing drunk tourist 's stuff and since the number of aussies residents is so low it looks like they 're all criminal . 
  it 's not us who are still crying about it though ... 
  so careful , or i may give the duke of alba a call . 
  claro , claro . 
  and how many languages do you speak ? 
  if only ... 
  jam\u00f3n and sangr\u00eda for everyone !, 
  northern castille spanish . 
  did n't you get the memo ?
