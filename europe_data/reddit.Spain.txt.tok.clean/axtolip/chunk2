  they 're most likely gypsies , and they have been living in europe for centuries . 
  only four eu countries fulfill the 2 % nato rule . 
  summer for the coast : in the mediterranean is quite hot but it 's also when all the touristy places are open and full of people , in the atlantic is less crowded and more temperate . 
  spring for the interior like castile and non-coastal andalucia , unless you enjoy dry heat and staying indoors until 8pm . 
  and i bet they hate the west with a passion . 
  `` f\u00e9 del coverso '' ( convert 's faith ) we call it . 
  even if you do n't have to answer , you 'll probably check the mail in case it 's something really urgent and then get pissed and stressed out about work and how much of a douche your boss is when you should be relaxing and enjoying your free time . 
  i 'm all for the ban .

   hippie-states like bavaria i though bavaria was one of the most conservative states , how is it a hippie-state ? 
  spain now is definitely orange , not green . 
  you can find hateful tweets about anything , and there are plenty [ anti-spain ] ( https://twitter.com/puta_espanya ) ones from catalonia . 
  spectators in barcelona 's stadium expend the whole match shouting ` puta espa\u00f1a ' every single week . 
  that does n't mean all catalans are hateful , does it ? 
  it seems some of you guys are trying to focus in the extremist people just so you have an argument for separatism . 
  i could do the same to justify unionism , since the spanish speaking population of catalonia would face discrimination form those extremist groups . 
  it is not , but you should n't generalize all people from madrid because you had a bad time there . 
  it sounds to me that you are bitter against madrid for some stuff that 's happened you there , and you are bringing it to politics . 
  nice username . 
   i think we 've established you as an anti-democratic fascist . 
  i guess , is n't so foreign to a spaniard ? 
  real low blow . 
  go fuck yourself . 
  way too late . 
  russia has shown her real face , why should the west now pretend we did n't see it ? 
  you 're failing pretty hard in the last one . 
  no , [ not really ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights#substantive_rights ) . 
  calling gay marriage basic human rights is quite a stretch , specially when civil unions exist in most european countries . 
  sometimes it feels that there is a hidden neo-liberal agenda that governments will follow regardless of the will of the people , and it does n't matter which party you vote or how much change a candidate promise , the path has already been decided . 
  one of the worst maps of this kind , but still gets to be reposted regularly . 
  unlike france and germany , spain followed all maastricht rules until 2008 , when the crisis hit . 
  look where germany and where spain are now and tell me again how they would have prevented the crisis . 
  that 'd be for spain & italy 's benefit since germany would need to pay for the energy anyway , so i understand it makes more sense for them to install them in germany even if they are less efficient there . 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  the fact that feature is not available in spain has nothing to do with any `` protectionist cunt '' , it simply has n't been released in here by google . 
  edit : and also , what does that have to do with eu law ? 
  you 're not entitled to some private service just because you like it . 
  next time inform yourself better before talking shit about other countries , or shut up . 
  maybe we have zero interest in being the emergency number of the world . 
  dat switzerland . 
  not very . 
  i can think of a few italian and german tv series that are broadcast here , mainly police themed ones , and i 've heard some spanish tv series are broadcast in central/eastern europe , but i do n't think that 's what you 're asking . 
  i ca n't think of any example of series as you have described . 
  there may be a foreign character here and there , but that 's it . 
  i guess the main problem is the language barrier . 
  mine too !, 
  you mean the uk , right ? 
  [ this may cheer you up . 
  ] ( http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20140517_gdp15.png?1400241737 ), 
  watch your back italy . 
  it 's all about which country goes deeper into recession next year !, 
  in physics at least , order of magnitude basically mean number of zeros . 
  so 100000 + is indeed two orders of magnitude higher than 5500 . 
  [ torrente i ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120868/ ) and [ ii ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0257231/ ) . 
  i 'm a simpleton like that . 
  william of orange is pretty much unknown in spain . 
  take into account the netherlands was [ just one out of the many ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/europe_map_1648.png ) european regions the spanish kings used to control and lost . 
  i guess this subject is top priority in the dutch history books , but in spain is just mentioned among many others of that period . 
  it 's not about spending more , it 's about changing the monetary policy . 
  germany needs to move on from its inflation trauma . 
  and the monetary policy should not only fit germany , but the whole of us . 
  we joined the euro , not the dem . 
  it may depend on the teacher . 
  mine used to emphasized how unnatural was the union with the netherlands . 
  the spanish monarchy was , with the french one , the strongest in europe in relation with the other strata : the inquisition gave the spanish kings power over the clergy and both nobility and bourgeoisie had few powers . 
  spain was an absolute monarchy two centuries before absolutism was the rule in europe . 
  spain identity was also heavily based on catholicism , first opposed to islam and judaism and then to protestantism . 
  netherlands was pretty much the opposite , with a very strong bourgeoisie and a stronghold of calvinism . 
  neither the dutch or the spanish were going to change . 
  so 70 % of this sub is from iceland , belarus and the vatican . 
  seems reasonable . 
  belarus is now taking the lead . 
  mexico , and then the rest of hispanoamerica . 
  then we can just rename the eu the spanish empire , extended edition . 
  we are too loud . 
  it 's been a while since i was a student , but what i remember is : emphasis : greeks & phoenicians , romans , al-andalus/reconquista and spanish empire ( with emphasis on its slow and long decline ) . 
  but especially the 19th century . 
  so much 19th century ... only covered briefly : wwi & wwii , even though they are more interesting for students than knowing which party ruled every single year of the 19th century . 
  usually left out : francoism and democratic transition . 
  in theory because it 's the most recent part and usually there 's no time left for it . 
  in reality , probably to avoid parents complaining about their children being indoctrinated one way or another . 
  they 're still rather politicized subjects . 
  leftist populism . 
  the last this spain needs is castile getting secession ideas . 
  patriotic song ? 
  in spain ? 
  lol, 
  i guess this what the government means when they talk about green shoots . 
  i do n't think this is saying this kind of crap thinking on us europeans , but on the russian people . 
  i guess this kind of comments actually earn him support at home . 
  what do you mean ? 
  the areas with the highest population density of poland [ seem to be in silesia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:silesia_%28now%29.png ) . 
  yeah , sure . 
  btw , the propaganda you guys are fed does n't count as history . 
  uk would n't be splitting in two , scotland would be breaking apart from it . 
  is now when you tell me how the kingdom of aragon was actually catalonia and the kingdom of navarre was the basque country ? 
  so what 's your idea of too much power ? 
  let me guess , any state bigger than switzerland ? 
  that 'd be convenient . 
  can i assume you are against the existence of the eu too ?
