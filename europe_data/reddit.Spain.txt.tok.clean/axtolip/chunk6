  it 's the 28th ... 
  i kind of like this comrade thing . 
  as for the flag , most spaniards were wearing the 2nd republica 's one anyway . 
  i like my sunset at 10pm . 
  very good point . 
  the mexican empire is almost unheard of in spain . 
  does it include the effect of government subsidies ? 
  that sounds strangely similar to civ5 isabella 's presentation . 
  just happened few minutes ago , so there 's still no news in english . 
  [ some pics ] ( https://twitter.com/logannni/status/449198817590935552/photo/1 ) are being published on twitter . 
  still no info about the passangers . 
  no , they 're black african guys . 
  volkswagen to close eur 800m factory in germany, 
  lunch is ready !, 
  and approved by referendum by 45 million spaniards , you seem to be forgetting that . 
  keep dreaming . 
  who is the state to forcebly steal one , two or three years of my life ? 
  i hope by `` style '' you mean color and shape . 
  orange plastic gum simply should n't be advertised as edam cheese , because it is not edam cheese . 
  the west would not recognize unilateral catalan independence , so seems like one is enough in that case . 
  a comparison with kosovo would show the hypocresy of make many countries , though . 
  the years label is wrong from the 20th century . 
  wwi did n't start in 1894 and germany was n't occupying russia in 1950 . 
  [ better ?

  got it from [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_lithuania#international_trade ) . 
  edit : 19 % in 2012 , 16.6 % in 2011 . 
  seems like it raised or different methodology was used . 
  but that data needs context . 
  in spain , bikes are more frequently used for sport activities than transport . 
  biking on a country-side bike lane with your family on sundays is safer than commuting to work , sharing the congested roads with cars and trucks . 
  so it 's normal the death rates are lower than , for instance , the netherlands . 
  from wikipedia , in 2011 only 16.6 % of lithuanian exports went to russia . 
  did this percent use to be higher before joining the eu and random russia 's sanctions ? 
  seems like russia is doing a great job isolating theirselves from the rest of europe . 
  just the exception that proves the rule . 
  russia has managed to fully alienate ukrane out of their sphere of influence and now they 're just trying to pick up the pieces they can save . 
  whatever is left of ukraine will become hostile enough to them not only to join nato and the eu , but to be against anything related with russia for decades . 
  it hardly seems like a winning move to me , but who knows . 
  west and south western europe can not into bike . 
  add romania , bulgaria and the baltics and you get a new militar power going . 
  just be sure the ticket includes the round trip, 
  a polish in germany in the 30 's ? 
  good luck with that . 
  * no homo * . 
   they peacefully resisted and have continued to peaceful resist yeah , that 'd sound great if we were talking about a group of college students and not ** the army ** . 
  sounds like straight forward protectionism to favor state-owned deutsche bahn . 
  now estonia is also central european ? 
  this is getting ridiculous . 
  soon vladivostok will be considered `` mid-eastern european '' or something . 
  from the article : `` workers affiliated to the social security system rose to 16.2 m in february '' . 
  there are more workers , not just fewer undemplowed people . 
  exactly the same in span with `` violencia machista '' , and it 's being used as excuse to create discriminating laws agains men . 
  here , a single report is enough to put a guy in a cell prison for days , ** before any kind of trial ** . 
  in case of divorce , some women are using this shit to get bigger alimony and fully custody of the children . 
  read again the title : `` since age 15 '' means 15 years old and older . 
  for spain , the current crisis in venezuela maybe more relevant than ukraine 's . 
  that 's obviously not the case for poland . 
  this does n't mean we do n't give a fuck . 
  a good thing about the ue countries being so different is that we can focus on different things . 
  but if shit hits the fun we all can act as one . 
  spain , italy and france have no dependance on russian gas , since we get ours from algeria . 
  spain in particular gets * 0 % * of its gas from russia . 
  so that 's not the issue . 
  `` in ukraine '' , and not only crimea . 
  either they place a puppet goverment as the one in belarus or annex south and eastern ukraine . 
  i do n't think they can do the first without massive social unrest . 
  let me make clear you train of thinking here : norweigian boy , no second thoughts about cleaningless . 
  argentinian , serbian or african : hmmm ... likely too smelly for my jacket . 
  this is happening worlwide . 
   non-greed/non-materialistic society you could try moving to the moon as well . 
  really ? 
  i think you forget [ this guy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_v,_holy_roman_emperor ) . 
  portugal . 
  we wo n't be better off , but we will look so much better on the map !, 
  castilla , the region that occupies most of the center . 
  [ toledo ] ( http://www.toledo-turismo.com/recursos/fondos/117.jpg ) , [ avila ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/avila_001.jpg ) , [ segovia ] ( http://erasmusismadrid.com/contenido/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/alcc3a1zar-dc3ada-151.jpg ) , [ salamanca ] ( http://www.mudanzasmadrid.es/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/mudanzas_madrid_foto_salamanca.jpg ) , [ burgos ] ( http://www.caminosantiago.org/cpperegrino/cppoblaciones/cpburgos/cpobjetos/burgos.jpg ) , leon and alcal\u00e1 de henares . 
  no , not really . 
  just family . 
  why do they want to ban snus anyway ? 
  is n't it way less damaging than smoking ? 
  latin american countries became independent after a war , not by friendly means as most of the commonwealth countries , so as you can imaging they would n't be so happy belonging to a organization * lead * by spain , the same way the us does not belong to a commonwealth lead by the uk . 
  i do n't think that spain would be in a leading position either , since contries like mexico , argentina or colombia are big enough that their economies can eventually surpase spain 's ( mexico 's will do it in the next 10 years ) . 
  there are a number of supranational organizations in latam , but spain belongs to none of them . 
  if they were rich they would n't even want to join the eu . 
  look norway or switzerland . 
  joining the eu is a pain in the ass and only worth it if your country is piss poor , has a huge inferiority complex or both . 
  i 'd like to see what 'd be of the eu if we got rid of the cohesion funds . 
  i 'm thinking most net receivers would almost inmediately leave . 
  why the fuck would they dismantle their industry and agriculture and open their doors to tons of foreign products for nothing in exchange ? 
  for the ones in the eurozone it may be too late , but it 's not for these guys . 
  spain , greece , solovaquia , romania and chipre ( any others ? ), 
  do n't recognize kosovo , and are part of the eu . 
  so kosovo may not be the biggest problem for serbia . 
  become friends with russia , threaten with abandon the eu and join customs union with them . 
  get 15000 million euros and 1/3 discount in gas . 
  now seriously , 10 years ago i saw the eu intregrating more and more until becoming a world power . 
  today i see that the ex-colonial countries ( portugal , france , uk , spain ) would have more potencial and a brighter future joining coalitions with those ex-colonies that with a bunch of culturally alien countries that have proved do n't give a shit about you when the hard times come . 
  old europe is old and rotting . 
  he had a mortatge so it was n't his house , but the bank 's .
