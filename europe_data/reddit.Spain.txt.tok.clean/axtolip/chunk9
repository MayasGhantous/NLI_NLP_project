  but i do n't believe either the average northerner is any more skeptical than the average mediterranean guy . 
   your next paragraph . 
  yes , i do believe americans ( i mean the american people , not its government ) are innocent of the iraqi war and they are not to blame for it . 
   rest of your comment . 
  what is with you and estonia ? 
  estonia , that has grown a lot and i 'm very happy for them , is still poorer that greece ( [ check its numbers ] ( http://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_cd#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:esp:swe:ita:fra:prt:deu:fin:grc:cze:est&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tdim=true&amp;tstart=336607200000&amp;tend=1314828000000&amp;hl=es&amp;dl=es&amp;ind=false ) ) , it is also a [ still a net receiver of european funds ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/221513/eu_finances_2012.pdf ) . 
  it 's funny you keep asking me for providing sources ( which i do ) when you keep claiming things that are simply not true ( with no source ) . 
  ever worse , you are lying to make southern european countries and its people look bad . 
  that makes me assume ( yes assume , but with good reason ) that you are an anti-south europe bigot . 
  to be honest , i 'm not even replying for you to read it , but so everyone else reading your bullish can see how much bullshit it is . 
  i have been reading your opinions here for a while and it 's obvious you are not willing to challenge your bigotry with the facts . 
  i do n't know about racist , but if you are not a bigot , you make a great impersonation of one . 
  you also like to show pride about your sources , but most of your rants are unjustified :  the last 27 years has not managed to make them fix their economy and become contributors in 1987 , spain 's gdp per capita was 2/3rds of germany 's and 5/8th of sweden 's . 
  in 2011 , it was 5/6ths of germany 's and more than 3/4ths of sweden . 
  ( [ source ] ( http://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_cd#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:esp:swe:ita:fra:prt:deu&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tdim=true&amp;tstart=559605600000&amp;tend=1316988000000&amp;hl=es&amp;dl=es&amp;ind=false ) ) you can call that whatever you want , but most people would call it a huge improvement . 
  still , sorry we can develop fast enough for your taste . 
  your comment about the brics is laughable . 
  no , they are not economically on the same level than italy , spain , portugal or even greece . 
  not even close either . 
  it would seem you have n't ever been down here in southern europe . 
  in other comment you made some remarks blaming italians for keeping voting berlusconi over and over . 
  the man has basically bought all italian media . 
  in italy , like in most european countries there 's a big part of the electorate who 's old , generally conservative , and very pliable by what they watch on tv . 
  i bet you believe your elderlies there in sweden make the most educated decisions and are immune to tv propaganda . 
  allow me to doubt it . 
  i 've lived in sweden and you guys are not often of the critical and skeptical type , more like rather gullible . 
  if you had cared to read about it , you 'd see there are many italians that are very militant against berlusconi 's moves , and are constantly denouncing his shenanigans in any possible way . 
  sadly , militant minorities are that , minorities , and a tv monopoly gives you a much better speaker than any protest . 
  you seem convinced that these kind of shit ( that happens all the world around ) ca n't happen to you guys , * oh you beings of light * . 
  i 'm convinced it can and someday will . 
  time will say . 
  that map is a joke . 
  so the uk is the champion of lgtb rights , way before sweden , spain or the netherlands ? 
  gay marriage is n't even legal in scotland and north ireland , but we in `` the continent '' are the intolerant ones . 
  c'mon , even the pic they 're using to illustrate gay rights is taken in barcelona . 
  talk about never giving up ... 
  damn , the fucker still considers himself king of `` the indias '' and half of europe . 
  sorry , i do n't agree in the ` intransigence of the spanish government towards the catalans ' . 
  in 30 years , spain has gone from being an unitary , centralized country , with spanish as only official language in all the territory , to delegate in the comunidades autonomas most responsibilities , including justice , education , culture or healthcare . 
  that 's not the case of the uk , where scotland has always remained a separate entity from england . 
  even your royals are kings of england and scotland . 
  ~ ~ ours are only kings of spain ~ ~ ( apparently not ) , which was supposed to include all the lesser entities . 
  catalonia will eventually have it its way , whatever that means , but things like a region splitting from a country take time and obliviously face resistance . 
  works to me in chrome 29 . 
  making a 15 meters long robot dragon for some festival in a 9000 people village ... guys , you were supposed to be the financially responsible country . 
  you just say that so we give ceuta back to you guys !, 
  in fact the third is also `` resolved '' . 
  spain has an agreement with morocco to give back to them any illegal immigrants crossing the border , even if they are not moroccans . 
  who knows what morocco does with them afterwards . 
  probably dump them in mauritania or the middle of the sahara . 
  seems like east germany could live off exporting wurst ... 
  i ca n't see how most of that has anything to do with the handling of the crisis . 
  really , spanish self-bashing gets old real fast . 
  and it makes you sound like a cry baby . 
  increasing taxes and cutting expenses . 
  between 2007 and 2009 , with the popping of the housing bubble , spain went from a budget surplus to a 10 % of budget deficit . 
  from 2009 , the gdp fall has been as high or higher than the budget cuts achieved , meaning it has n't been possible to decrease the the deficit . 
  it seems that finally this year the deficit will be lower than the 10 % . 
  you will see many spaniards complaining about everything done , but really , what were we expecting ? 
  a country with a 10 % deficit can not function long term . 
  fixing that will take cuts in everything : public salaries , education , healthcare , administration . 
  you do n't fix a 10 % deficit with nice words and good intentions . 
  we were n't as rich as we thought we were , and going from richer to poorer is never easy . 
  as a native language , yes . 
  but a big majority of catalans are bilingual . 
  they expelled the jews and conquered granada , but the muslims were n't expelled ( or forced to convert ) until one century later . 
  i 'm surprised on how low the semitic & arab portions are for spain . 
  apparently both the [ reyes cat\u00f3licos ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_alhambra_decree ) and [ felipe iii ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/expulsion_of_the_moriscos ) were really thorough ... 
  comparing catalonia situation within spain with that of latvia within the soviet union is not very fair . 
  catalan nationalist parties are legal and present in both spain 's and catalonia 's parliaments . 
  catalan is official in catalonia , being the only language allowed in public education . 
  the language is spoken by almost 100 % of catalans regardless of their origin , so it 's not exactly endangered . 
  the problem that most catalans have about the rest of spain is that they , being richer than the average region , have too pay more than they receive . 
  it slightly looks like paella , but what does all this have to do with the post ? 
  that sachertorte gave me really bad cravings . 
  [ tortilla de patata ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/tortilla-de-patatas.jpg ) . 
  easy to make , transport , and can be eaten cold . 
  okey , i do not believe it . 
  most people in spain admire germany to a ridiculous extent : everything german is the shit and germany is the reference for everything . 
  i like germany myself and all , but i think the image that most spaniards have of germany is completely idealized and not realistic at all . 
  that maps represents what * the guardian * wants europe to think of germany . 
  no , spaniards , in general , do n't blame germany for austerity . 
  god is spanish . 
  it is known . 
   a man wants a woman who he can show off in public . 
  a clever woman is the new status symbol for a man woah , that paragraph makes it sound like is something terrible . 
  i do n't think wanting a successful wife has anything to do with ` showing off ' or ` status symbols ' . 
  it 's simply that most men today are not okey with supporting a stay-home woman . 
  hell , most of us could n't afford it , even if we wanted to . 
  as long as you can quit any time and they pay you , it 's not slave labor . 
  funnily enough she did n't quit , she was fired . 
  so the german empire is back ... in beer form . 
  basically the same you said : * toulouse : friendly people , helpful to tourists , will engage in conversation with you at any chance , wo n't make you feel like shit for speaking crappy french or having a heavy accent . 
  * paris : parisians . 
  where in france did you go ? 
  i 've been in toulouse and paris and the experiences between them were so different they seemed to be in different countries . 
  yes , in sweden , in the university of link\u00f6ping . 
  when i arrived i took a couple courses of swedish , but it became obvious that i 'd barely get to use it , since everybody , from the professors to the bus drivers , spoke solid english , and would quickly switch to it when they realized you were struggling with the language . 
  today i only remember a handful of phrases and words in swedish . 
  the experience was so great that next fall i 'm leaving to study in germany for another two years , with savings money .
