  it is often difficult to determine which language is considered the local language of a particular city . 
  catalonia has autonomy on the paper , but it is actually useless because the spanish government , parliament and judiciary systematically overrule any catalan law that they do not like . 
  the most beautiful * mones * include chocolate models of houses , boats , animals , people , etc. 
  what about the european free alliance ? 
  if the package says `` gouda cheese '' and it is not from gouda you are misleading the consumers , just like a package saying `` chicago peas '' containing peas from turkey that have never been to chicago would be misleading . 
  camembert , brie , parmesan , champagne , rochefort , cognac , scotch , ... these are the geographic names , not the generic terms !, 
  they are known towns and regions in europe just like michigan is a known american region . 
  your initial point was that valencian people have never been catalan `` at any point in history '' and that is false because of their ethnical background . 
  following your example , english people were saxons during the 7th-11th centuries until isolation and the merger with other cultures such as normans helped create a different identity . 
  similarly , at some point in the 13th century , valencians were catalan no different from those that settled in tortosa , until the governance by a different legislature and the contact with other cultures helped develop an own identity . 
  if i understood correctly this woman is just the lawyer of some eta members . 
  there is a question on scottish independence but not about catalan independence ? 
  :-( also separatist is not in the list and nationalist does not mean the same ... 
  who let them use the internets ??!, 
  probably the intention is to prosecute separatist demonstrations . 
  many slogans used by those of us who want to split spain may be interpreted as offensive to the country . 
  catalonia has no self-government in practice . 
  all the laws passed by the catalan parliament can be easily overturned by the spanish parliament . 
  all attempts to protect the catalan self-government have proved futile , so the only way to secure it is by seceding from spain . 
  i know that such a separation would be traumatic , but it is still preferable to the prospect of losing the catalan self-government , because that would inevitably result in the extinction of the catalan culture and language . 
  for most catalans , helping in the preservation of the catalan language is one of the main goals in life . 
  perhaps we can convince the spanish politicians saying that if they let catalonia secede , they will have more chances to host the olympics !, 
  this conflict may resume in a near future because the local french authorities mean to demolish the bridge that separates the puigcerd\u00e0-ll\u00edvia road with the french rn20 and merge them in a big roundabout . 
  the people in ll\u00edvia have already hanged some big posters all around the town to protest about it . 
  why do you compare tobacco and alcoholic beverages instead of some other more common goods ? 
  this is a terrible example . 
  who cares about this law ? 
  it is not important at all . 
  the plan e , the 400 $ , the policies in railroad and airport management , the military spending ... these are big fuck-ups . 
  wtf nobody told me of that and i am doing their job for free !, 
  * [ els segadors ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfv993yefvu ) * is our national anthem . 
  the second most important patriotic song in catalonia is the * [ cant de la senyera ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptlufmhuzm8 ) * , which most people agree that is much better in the musical sense . 
  the traditional catalan folkloric dance is the sardana , and the most famous and most patriotic sardana is * [ la santa espina ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhlrguqpr80 ) * . 
  in times of economic crisis one must think about that one thousand bull fans from catalonia that are losing a lot of money when they need to travel all the way to valencia or saragossa to watch a bullfight . 
  some people ask why catalonia needs independence if it already has autonomy and this story is the reason . 
  autonomy is useless if the central parliament overturns every single catalan law that they do not like . 
  these situations are also common in many catalan towns . 
  for example , in the the town hall of gallifa ( [ pic ] ( http://images.ara.cat/politica/lajuntament-gallifa-senyera-lestelada-bandera_araima20130111_0104_1.jpg ) ) they have installed a 20 cm spanish flag ( you can see it very small under the letters ) while three flagpoles with the local flag , the catalan flag and the separatist flag are next to the building . 
  yes , even the image of a childless aunt/uncle is somewhat present in the popular culture . 
  probably this lack of social stigma explains the low fertility rate . 
  so basques deserve it and catalans do not ? 
  catalan-speaking regions . 
  for some people yes , they are a potential future territorial claim . 
  the only region that could be problematic is the [ aran valley ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aran_valley ) . 
  if the results in there were significantly different they could probably argue for a referendum to rejoin spain/join france/become independent of their own . 
  however , since most catalan people do not give a shit about them i do not think that it would be a problem to relinquish the aran valley . 
  here you have the official text of the [ declaration of sovereignty ( in catalan ) ] ( http://www.parlament.cat/web/actualitat/noticies?p_format=d&amp;p_id=129656021 ) , and a non-official [ english translation ] ( http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/4076896/20130124/declaration-of-sovereignty-and-of-the-right-to-decide-of-the-catalan-nation.html ) . 
  the preamble is a bit shitty , you can skip that ... 
  btw , finally 15 socialist mp have voted against the declaration and 5 socialist mp have not voted at all . 
  this could spark a big internal crisis within the party . 
  tomorrow the catalan parliament is going to approve a sovereignty declaration and these days everyone was discussing whether the socialist party should vote for it/against it/abstain . 
  what about the 24 guys from / r/andorra then ? 
  from the middle age * [ tirant lo blanc ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tirant_lo_blanc ) * ( `` tirant the white '' ) by joanot martorell . 
  from the modern ages * [ la pla\u00e7a del diamant ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_time_of_the_doves ) * ( `` the time of the doves '' or `` the pigeon girl '' ) by merc\u00e8 rodoreda . 
  the most famous series from catalan tv right now is * [ polseres vermelles ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1698292/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) * '' [ the red band society ] ( http://www.tv3.cat/sales/genres/1270/series/red-band-society ) '' ( [ w ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polseres_vermelles ) ) about some kids that live in a hospital . 
  it is not inappropriate to show your political bias , we all have one . 
  yes , there are people that think politicians now should be focused in defending class interests . 
  i think that the time has come to solve the national question once and for all . 
  obviously everyone has its own opinion on what is the best way to improve society . 
   are n't the political figures leading the independence movement also responsible for the crisis and guilty of mismanagement in the past ? 
  these are the disadvantages of a political system with proportional representation using closed lists . 
  you vote for the party with your ideology even if you dislike most of its candidates , because there is no way to alter them . 
  so yes , some of the independentist politicians have been repeatedly in the parliament or in the government during the last thirty years , but there are plenty of similar cases in most of the other parties as well , so this is not a reason not to embrace separatism . 
  we eat a * [ tortell ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tortell ) * which is very similar to this bolo-rei , but only for the 6th of january . 
  it has a hidden bean that implies you have to pay for the cake , but also a figurine and if you find it you are `` the king '' of the meal and have to wear a paper crown . 
  catalonia : christmas eve : nothing , religious people go to midnight mass . 
  christmas day : family lunch . 
  the first course is traditionally * [ escudella de galets i carn d'olla ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/escudella_i_carn_d%27olla ) * ( soup with christmas pasta and stew , [ pic ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/escudella.jpg ) ) . 
  the second course is stuffed turkey or chicken or capon or sometimes veal . 
  for dessert we eat * [ torrons ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turr%c3%b3n ) * and * [ neules ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neula ) * . 
  after the lunch , the children beat the * [ ti\u00f3 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ti%c3%b3_de_nadal ) * ( christmas log ) with sticks and make him shit . 
  sometimes you make small children recite a christmas poem standing on a chair , or you make them sing christmas songs . 
  the next day , 26th december , is st. stephen 's day and there is a family lunch as well . 
  people eat * cannelloni * and all leftovers from the previous day . 
  i forgot to add that children get their presents on the 6th january , given by the three wise kings from the east . 
  this is the day that ends the holiday season and features a family lunch as well . 
  usually there is also a family lunch for the 1st january and a family supper for december 31 . 
  okay ;-) i am sure other people will also find it funny that you are actually catalan and polish :-d, 
   it seems to me the catalan demand for secession/independence has gained momentum from the economic crisis , how much would you agree with this ? 
  not really , the main reason for the current boost is the 2005-2006 negotiation of the catalan statute and the 2010 sentence of the constitutional court on that affair . 
  especially the way it was considered by the spanish media . 
  i guess an economic crisis means that people are generally a bit more interested in politics , but the criticism of our fiscal imbalance has been widely accepted by the catalan public for the last 20 years . 
  the feeling that all `` our '' proposals have been useless is what has driven most people into separatism . 
   do you think there is an element of selfishness that feeds the movement ? 
  yes , but i would rather call it `` not liking being ripped off '' . 
   by this i mean that surely disenfranchised catalans who are unemployed should feel they have more in common with striking miners and struggling galicians and castillians rather than their respective ruling class which arguably has not really felt the brunt of the economic crisis . 
  i guess so ... but why would they feel have more in common with struggling galicians than with striking greeks ? 
  many places in europe are in a tough situation . 
  i am not sure what you mean in here . 
   to what extent are you concerned with the way a catalan secession would affect the rest of spain ? 
  it will force them to change their unchangeable constitution and their inefficient government system , and i hope that they will move towards a more democratic and transparent system . 
  with the current discontentment towards politicians , taking a different path would create an unbearable situation of public unrest . 
   would you accept full federation as an alternative to independence ? 
  personally i would not , but a decent proposal would probably be supported by the majority of the catalan population . 
  however it would need to imply real power for catalonia and right now it seems impossible to get a proposal like that from the spanish government . 
  catalan polish ? 
  do you mean from the actual poland or are you simply a catalan ? 
  this flag is the standard catalan flag . 
  the flag of the independence movement includes a star ( like [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:estelada_blava.svg ) or [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:estelada_roja.svg ) ) , so the flair should not imply that , but yes i support independence . 
  i think it is likely to happen , as i have written above .
