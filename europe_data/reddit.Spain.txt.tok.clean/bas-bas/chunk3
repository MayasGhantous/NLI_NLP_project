  the spanish government position is that they will use all kinds of legal tricks in order to stop a referendum and not listen to the majority view in catalonia . 
  but with the present mood in all catalan institutions , if they follow this strategy with all consequences they will need to end up removing all democratic voting rights to catalan people , and my hope is that the european union would not remain impassive paying for the spanish bailout in such circumstances . 
  i am not really interested on the basque independence movement and i do not know what they are going to do . 
  right now they do not seem much motivated . 
  i support it and i think it is going to happen . 
  in my opinion , the best option for spain to stop it is passing a law that allows the catalan parliament to celebrate as many separatist referendums as we want for now and for the future . 
  this might drive many catalan people into giving yet another second chance to spain , believing that spain still `` cares '' about us and voting no because * the door would still be open * . 
  the current position of the spanish government that involves attacking catalan culture , blocking all catalan laws and making threats on the media against the catalan independence movement is only accelerating the process and driving more sectors of catalan society into separatism . 
  independence from spain, 
  [ montserrat ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/montserrat_%28mountain%29 ) is an amazing place , i think that it should be present in the list . 
  in the pyrenees i like your preferences but i also love the [ valley of n\u00faria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vall_de_n\u00faria ) , in a different area . 
  finally , i am from barcelona and i really love the city , so we differ on that point . 
  the old city is authentic and the modern part has plenty of nice buildings . 
  obviously we compare to madrid because it 's a similar metro area from the demographic point of view , and everywhere in the world the populated areas have better infrastructures than the sparsely populated areas . 
  and i do not think that many catalan people will follow you in your lost struggle , because right now we are very busy conceiving a new country in here . 
  there is a high speed line coru\u00f1a-ourense working since the last year in galicia so i am not really sure why would you say that . 
  when i refer to the perception that spain is spending money in useless trains is because the most basic infrastructures in catalonia are never built , like the train connection to the barcelona port or the two-lane connection to the south of catalonia that have been requested by the catalan industry for the past twenty years , and meanwhile high-speed trains and other infrastructures that should be considered bonus are being built in areas with a much lower demographic power . 
  the perception about the highways i can tell you that is very widespread , just check out [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpo_9bpcaus&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=13s ) , and it has some kind of base because i think that the current data is : * catalonia : 617 km of toll highways ( 67 % ) , 303 km of free highways ( 33 % ) ; * madrid : 17 km of toll highways ( 3,4 % ) , 483 km of free highways ( 96,6 % ) ; * andalusia : 192 km of toll highways ( 12,8 % ) 1.308 km of free highways ( 87,2 % ) ;, 
  i am still puzzled with your comment about `` amazing infrastructures that other regions can only dream about '' . 
  high speed rail ? 
  it is not a catalan thing , check [ the map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/ave.png ) . 
  we should rather say that it is an infrastructure that basically benefits madrid since all the high speed railways only go to madrid . 
  highways ? 
  there is only one free highway in catalonia , the a-2 that goes to madrid , all the rest have expensive tolls . 
  in contrast , madrid itself is surrounded with free highways to the point that the few toll highways in there get no cars at all and the central government is going to bail them out !, 
  the olympic games ? 
  that was 20 years ago and prepared with our own means !, 
   but at the same time , catalonia has amazing infrastructures that other regions can only dream about it is curious how spanish people have this perception when the spending in public infrastructures in catalonia for the recent years has consistently been the 8 % even when catalonia represents the 20 % of the tax collection and the 16 % of the population . 
  here the general perception is that the spanish government is spending money in useless trains and highways in the rest of spain and sends to catalonia older trains that are crap and break down constantly and does not build the railway lines that we need to transport goods to europe . 
  also we see how all the highways in catalonia have expensive tolls because they were privately built while all highways in spain ( outside catalonia and valencia ) are free and built by the government . 
  the problem of the basque country and navarre is that they establish two precedents that we catalans envy and can not understand . 
  why are they allowed to collect all taxes and not pay any solidarity transfer to poorer regions if they are the richest areas ? 
  in contrast , all catalan taxes are collected by the central government which is by far the most corrupt government and bad managed government in spain and invests very little in catalonia . 
  in catalonia , the [ barcelona county ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/localitzaci%c3%b3_del_barcelon%c3%a8s.svg/500px-localitzaci%c3%b3_del_barcelon%c3%a8s.svg.png ) with a population of 2,251,600 is the 30 % of catalonia and just the 0.45 % of the area . 
  the [ barcelona region ( red ) ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/\u00c0mbits_de_catalunya_1995.svg/500px-\u00c0mbits_de_catalunya_1995.svg.png ) has the 68 % of the population and the 10 % of the area . 
   catalonia is a cesspool of corruption , bad management and bleeding money ... 
  it is not . 
  have you been reading too much * el mundo * ? 
  do you mean that people from gibraltar should not be allowed to play football competitions ? 
  according to the original source :  in spain , we also have one case of a ` minority language ' ( catalan ) with significantly more content ( about thirty-five thousand articles ) than the ` majority language ' ( castilian/spanish with about nineteen thousand articles ) of the country . 
  nowhere else in the world do we see such high-visibility for a relatively small language . 
  in 1931 spain became a republic because of the result of some local elections . 
  some republican candidates had signed the [ pact of san sebastian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pact_of_san_sebasti%c3%a1n ) agreeing to seize the power and oust the monarch if they won in some major cities , and that is what they did with the democratic authority of the citizens ' vote . 
  the same scenario is planned for the 27 september elections , except that a catalan general election is going to be used instead of a municipal election which is less meaningful in order to evaluate the will of the catalan people . 
  carles rahola said that , well not exactly that , he said it in catalan . 
  puigdemont was citing some of his discourses during an event for the 75th anniversary of rahola 's execution . 
  in fact his wife is a romanian immigrant ... 
  i even heard some fireworks here in barcelona . 
  they wanted to discourage any blank or void votes in order to prevent a tie , so they announced that these votes would not be counted in the final round , but it seems that it did not work . 
  these are the official figures : http://i.imgur.com/sst5cun.jpg, 
  * merc\u00e8s * also means thanks , even if it is not as common as * gr\u00e0cies * or * merci * . 
   i believe catalonia has the right to secede , but spanish law requires a nationwide referenda , which would obviously not be in favour . 
  no , this is false , spain denies any right to secede , which is obviously undemocratic . 
  but in separate homes , please . 
   they are n't . 
  perhaps you wish they were not , but right now they are . 
   that 's the way of your quasi federal state functions . 
  not at all !, 
  the basque country and navarre have full control over their tax money . 
  why are they more special than us ? 
   knowing most voters there are against an independent catalonia this is totally false , most people in barcelona favor catalan independence . 
  i must say that i liked the name as well and it definitely does not trigger me . 
  however , regarding your other message , i do not think that simply by using another name like that it would get good publicity , long-term speaking . 
  those in spain and valencia that dislike the name `` catalan '' , they actually dislike what it means . 
  even if they may argue that the problem is the name . 
  if another name was used , i am sure that the same bad rep would emerge in a few years . 
  so did you do barcelona-andorra and then andorra-toulouse in two blablacar rides ? 
  the capital of liechtenstein is actually vaduz, 
  the last day you are supposed to reflect by yourself without external influences . 
  in my opinion it 's a stupid outdated measure . 
  the judges are very strict with election silence in here , but obviously they can not do anything on the internet . 
  i was just kidding ... 
  are you promoting the slogan of cup ? 
  today there is election silence !, 
   spain 's current system is designed to protect regional cultures it is designed to do that , but it is failing miserably according to the electoral results in the basque country and catalonia . 
  but they use envelopes in spain , so that nobody can see who they voted for . 
  not in europe, 
  but not me !, 
  ( in another subreddit though ), 
  it should be based in one city , not two . 
  i am sorry for strasbourg but the current situation is bad . 
  regarding the electoral system i would go in the opposite direction of you . 
  i would make it work with single member constituencies of similar population . 
  but i know that will never happen so at least i think it should use some kind of unified system throughout europe . 
  i do not think it is good that germany is represented as a single constituency while poland is divided into 13 , or that ireland uses stv and spain uses closed-lists where the actual candidates need not to appear in the ballot . 
  hey , i got 415 too !, 
  we are tied !, 
   * the loss of its place in the eu and the euro ( spain will veto the accession ) ,  * their obligation to affront a fair share of the spanish debt ( someone have said around 20 % ) both things will not happen at the same time . 
  if the spanish government goes `` the bad way '' and vetoes catalonia , obviously the catalan government will not be so stupid to kindly assume a part of the spanish debt . 
  they will just say : those bonds are signed by the spanish government and they are the ones that have to pay , we only aknowledge the bonds signed by the catalan government . 
  however i do not think that it will happen in the bad way . 
  the european companies that have businesses in catalonia will not want to lose their rights and the eu does not want to have spain in such a bad position ( keeping all its debt and loosing one of its most productive regions ) . 
  the european governments will press spain to accept the friendly way and catalonia will continue in the eu with the condition that they have to pay a part of the spanish debt . 
  unlike the crown of castile , the crown of aragon had strong estates-general and they were essential to its governance , it was not a madhouse . 
  after the creation of the * generalitat * in 1360 , the government of catalonia and their laws were regulated by catalan institutions . 
  catalonia was not just one title of the king , the crown was effectively run by three separate kingdoms with their three respective estates-general and their three generalitats . 
  a clear example of such behavior is the meeting of nine negotiators ( 3 aragonese , 3 catalan and 3 valencian ) to choose a new king in the compromise of caspe . 
  after the union with castile , the king still needed the support of the catalan institutions to govern catalonia this is what viktorbir is mentioning and i think that justifies the notion that catalonia was independent until 1714 . 
  i agree with you , though , in the fact that all those politics in the middle ages did not consider any national or cultural identity . 
  the different institutions and social classes were only interested in increasing their power and influence .
