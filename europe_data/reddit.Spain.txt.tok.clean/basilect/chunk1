why do n't you go back to speaking celtic ? 
   everyone speaks english but the locals are still very poor both of these are false . 
  obviously you know that there 's still the french and spanish speaking caribbean , but both of these areas are bigger than the english-speaking area . 
  also the caribbean is n't exactly `` very poor '' ( except for haiti ) . 
  4 of the top 10 countries in the americas for hdi are anglophone caribbean ( bahamas , barbados , antigua , and trinidad ) . 
  even jamaica places close to a poorer country in europe . 
  right , no one would ever do that ... 
  why is it only the dumb americans on this sub who have a us flair ? 
  okay , fine , his political roots . 
  funny you mention that , the biggest baltic diaspora in the us is in chicago , where a certain man named barack obama has his roots . 
  you could probably fly tuzla to eindhoven on wizzair and catch a train from there . 
  i 'd be impressed if these positions were n't assigned based on a purely patronage basis anyway . 
  wait , seriously ? 
  where ? 
  if religious discrimination is n't grounds for suspension of a medical license , i do n't know what is . 
  the last time someone wrote off millions of russians for no reason , he renamed volgograd after himself !, 
  that 's exactly the intent of the two-state solution ... 
  hey , what 's a couple mass graves filled with kosovar women and children between friends ? 
  be one of those hipsters with the republican spanish flag, 
  what 's the time frame on this ? 
  right ; if i 'm not mistaken , scotland is more pro-eu than england is !, 
  what do you mean ? 
  it worked out for kosovo !, 
  i think he was agreeing with you . 
  you mean that [ prostitutes ca n't go on strike ? 
  yeah , that 's because if they tried subbing in magyar it would take up half the screen . 
  the article also goes out of its way to pre-refute this , fortunately . 
   in its first year of operation 60 babies died out of a total of 120 , a fifty percent infant mortality rate , more than four times higher than in the general population at the time . 
  keep in mind much of ukip 's support is because the bnp disbanded . 
  would you be making these arguments if the question was whether the bnp was the dominant party in britain ? 
  hell , last time i was there i bought on ebay . 
  i mean maybe the sender had my address from the mailing address , but it 's highly unlikely that i ended up being registered in any way . 
  that 's just a more expensive version of slovenia !, 
  okay , fine , use `` the world '' if you 're not in europe . 
  < insert your country here  is without a doubt the most corrupt and repressive country in europe . 
  ecsc *, 
  oh the english are going to just * love * that !, 
  i 've seen some weird bananas, 
  they need parental consent plus 2 independent medical opinions, 
  it 's a knockoff chinese smartphone , i highly doubt gps will happen . 
  tall buildings will block the signal , so you ca n't get a lock in a central business district . 
  did n't the first internet connections in romania come through meshnets ? 
  and that 's why they have disproportionately fast internet for their level of development ? 
  i have a phone in the us that uses glonass . 
  it works well except in cities because the local antennas are only wired for gps . 
  russians are 24 % of estonia 's population and 27 % of latvia 's . 
   the eu allowed , for instance , qaddafi and kim jong un to happily galavant in europe getting educations , shielding money , trafficking people , without doing fuck all about it . 
  four words : [ school of the americas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/school_of_the_americas ), 
  oh please , the british and french were as active as the us was in the middle east . 
  nobody 's hands are clean after the cold war . 
  when i lived in bcn , i unintentionally left town for the bar\u00e7a / man united champions league final . 
  when i came back i saw the remains of a burned car outside my apartment . 
   recent poles so those plumbers made it to france after all !, 
  just what spain needs , more british expats :p, 
  it 's like the us in reverse !, 
  this is scary and depressing . 
  so is pediatric oncology . 
  that explains why the minustah ( un mission to haiti ) troops are all filipinos , sri lankans , brazilians , and nepali gurkhas . 
  as someone living in haiti , i laugh at an american talking about corruption being a problem in their country . 
  there are still people in the united states who have been there for 60 years and have immense trouble speaking english . 
  how old ? 
  and does this keep in mind the kid being able to work 24/7 at acquiring language ? 
  adults almost never are learning a language full time . 
  try getting a dutch person to speak dutch to you as a non native speaker . 
  and for the seventh generation americans not speaking english living in rural texas or new mexico ? 
   make everyone born in italy an italian citizen the western hemisphere is unsympathetic with your complaints . 
  that 's been disproven over the past few years . 
  you 're conflating first language acquisition ( which works at a much younger age , until about 10 ) with second language acquisition ( which works indefinitely ), 
  i do n't think national stereotypes should have a role in a serious empirical study . 
  [ the singing forest ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327153/ ) , one of the worst movies ever made according to metacritic, 
  that does n't endogenously happen ; the occitan-speaking part of france would n't 've committed `` linguistic suicide '' if there was n't a [ concerted effort to delegitimize the language at the hands of the french speaking majority in the north ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_vergonha ), 
  [ it 's horrible ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_vergonha ) !, 
  hey !, 
  do n't forget air !, 
  ( and i did n't know danger was french ... * swoon * ), 
  well whose goddamn fault is that ? 
  [ did someone say bulgarian ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rvqv8goki8 ), 
  how do you fit your beret over the prototypical [ serbian geoncide warlord hairstyle ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/evstafiev-radovan_karadzic_3mar94.jpg ) ? 
  they wear them when they have a cold or something respiratory . 
  keeps droplets from getting everywhere, 
  francophone africa does n't have much tourism . 
  and montreal is ( quite unfortunately ) not as much on the same tourist circuit as new york, 
  because it 's never -15 c and gusting in dublin, 
  my family in ny is always excited to go to ireland for an annual january trade show , since it 's guaranteed to be at least 5-10c warmer in dublin . 
  one of the most popular definitions of a state is having a monopoly on the use of legitimate force . 
  if greece lets the golden dawn go unchecked , by some definitions they could be a failed state !, 
  quite a bit of literature backs that up actually : http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayabstract?frompage=online&amp;aid=2794304 http://eup.sagepub.com/content/8/1/13.short http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-5965.1996.tb00561.x/abstract, 
  but north dakotans still do n't have to learn english when they move to nyc . 
  are you seriously looking to the us as a model of high turnout ? 
  even in presidential elections there 's a [ paltry ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/44/turnout.png ) amount of turnout , and in the presidential primaries , congressional generals , congressional primaries , and maybe even off-year elections there 's more and more falloff . 
  in this map , competitiveness is relative . 
  you ca n't have all green . 
  if the largest green country has persistently hijacked european policy to most benefit it , it makes sense that there 's a disparity . 
  it is for aberdeen, 
  you slavonians crack me up, 
  because you do n't have to drive a train through them !, 
  most analysts did n't expect the soviet union to fall 5 years before it did . 
  i 've studied enough ir to take predictions with a grain of salt . 
  it 's a region of italy .
