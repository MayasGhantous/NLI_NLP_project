  that 's carlos danger to * you * . 
  it 's baseless/stupid , but not irrelevant . 
  that 's some restorative justice right there, 
  not if you ask serbia -- they called themselves the republic of yugoslavia until ~ 2003, 
   99 % of americand are nationalists they would say they are proud of their country , but would they call themselves `` nationalists '' per se ?

  one of these conflicts had nazi flags in volgograd , with the ultimate goal being the subjugation of the russian state . 
  another is an invasion , by russia , of another country . 
  if polish partisans were to fight back operation barbarossa , it would n't be a bitter 10 million death conflict for the russians . 
  they have the ability to retreat . 
  abandoning an occupation is different from [ losing a war ] ( http://www.theonion.com/graphic/may-1-1975-10557 ) , and poland would be less likely to be friendly to russia than a place like donetsk, 
  so [ 20 % non-german ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_germany ) , proportionally higher than the nonwhite fraction of many us states ?

   gold to deflate is if the value of gold goes down that 's inflation , you got them crossed around . 
  if the value of gold goes * up * , then your dollars buy * more * goods ( ie the price of a good in dollars decreases ; therefore , deflation ) . 
  and if they do that , why bother saving money in a bank when you can just stuff it in your mattress and get a great return ? 
  the cdu does n't get votes by telling germans the truth - that there is no way greece will ever be able to pay back the full balance of their loans . 
  so instead we have theatrics . 
  the countries around it are turkey , albania , macedonia , and bulgaria . 
  greece is trying to remain in the developed world , not get a loan from the world bank . 
  except for those [ lazy brits and austrians ( 58 ) ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=lfso_12agepens&amp;lang=en ),

  according to the new york times ,  switzerland 's treaty with the united states is unusual in that it gives swiss authorities the power to refuse extradition for tax crimes , but on matters of general criminal law , the swiss have agreed to turn people over for prosecution in american courts . 
  but knowing the roman polansky scandal , maybe the swiss just wanted them gone . 
  wtf dude , i worked hard pulling up facts and sources for my posts here , you ca n't just spout bullshit . 
  show me the country '' * in europe where 10 % of the population speak arab * '' . 
  you may have a difficult time doing so , since [ only 5 % of france 's population is muslim ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/2009/10/07/mapping-the-global-muslim-population/ ) , the largest ( obv . 
  except for bosnia , kosovo , and albania ) in europe . 
  that 's pretty big . 
  does n't kg have a giant us military base ? 
  you 're right ; there was an ambiguous wording there . 
  but i pulled the 1910 census files ( which is in a non-ocred 260 megabyte zip file of pdfs , * ugh * ) and found that the real number is 9.6 % , still a large portion of the united states . 
  population | number | percent | pct foreign born white ---------- | ------ | ------- | ---------------------- all | 91,072,266 | 100 % | -- white | 68,070,294 | 75 % | -- foreign white | 32,243,352 | 35 % | 100 % english/celtic-speaking | 10,087,430 | 11 % | 31 % germanic-speaking | 9,187,007 | 10 % | 28 % german-speaking | 8,817,271 | 9.6 % | 27 % * source : 1910 us census *, 
   some small communities kept their language alive i would n't consider ~ ~ 25 % ~ ~ 9.8 % of the country small . 
  but i 'd agree with your overall point ; that these personal identities were secondary to a larger , singular , hegemonic american identity . 
  perhaps a better analogue would be canada , but one can [ hardly consider anglo-french canadian relations harmonious ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/front_de_lib%c3%a9ration_du_qu%c3%a9bec ) . 
  of course , violence has happened for [ much less than ethnic motives ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_civil_war ) . 
  then again , things seem to be working out , [ more or less ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/03/16/quebec-canada-poll_n_1352912.html ) . 
  i think a europe that would n't have a single dominant national group trumping everyone else , a europe that can truly treat everyone equal , will be successful .

   so the language barrier is the biggest problem [ it was n't until world war i that the german language was more-or-less eradicated in america ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_language_in_the_united_states ) . 
  according to the 1910 census , ~ ~ [ a quarter of americans spoke german and could not speak english ] ( http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyid=102523977 ) ~ ~ * actually it 's 9.6 % german speakers overall * . 
   being a third-world country if the [ spinning jenny ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spinning_jenny ) was invented in amritsar , we would n't be having this conversation .

  i researched this , and it actually mostly checks out ( at least in the past hundred years ) .

  heres the thing ... it 's actually about ethnic unity . 
  see , there are germans living everywhere from strassburg to astrakhan . 
  why should n't they be united ? 
  under a strong german leader ?

  `` dae constant existential supranational identity crisis '' has been the basis for european politics for the past 30 years, 
   unlimited terms many states have term limits , but in practice this actually vests power in lobbyists , rather than politicians . 
  in florida , for example , a state senator can only serve two terms ( 8 years ) before retiring . 
  in fact , your first recommendation `` use a proportional system . '', 
  counteracts this , because in proportional systems , power usually rests in political parties , rather than individual politicians ( who are expected to follow the party line or get kicked off the list ) . 
  my phrase when it comes to the us is `` america did it first , and did it worst '' . 
  the american system is exceptional , in the sense that most other places that have a similar system ended up turning into dictatorships , thanks to the strong executive . 
  the legislative system is set up for inaction , rather than action ( the filibuster is absolutely absurd and undemocratic ) . 
  having 2-year , instead of longer , terms means that legislators are incredibly risk-averse and wo n't pass legislation with a short-term negative political effect .
