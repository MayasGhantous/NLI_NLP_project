there 's plenty of spanish spoken in barcelona . 
  catalan is more spoken outside the big city, 
  this should become a thing, 
  from my personal experience , i can confirm, 
  in general south-american accents ( of both spanish and portuguese ) are more melodic and the european accents sound more rough . 
  personally i find the european accents sexier because ... 
  i like it rough, 
  honestly i do n't believe you . 
  being romanian and living in spain ( we all know the bad fame we have in europe and even more so in spain ) , i have never faced any discrimination when dealing with public workers . 
  that being said , i did notice that argentinians are not very `` liked '' in spain , mainly because of the smugness and superior attitude they present themselves with . 
  it 's based on experiences i 've had meeting people from those countries, 
  it 's not intentional, 
  i 'm from banat . 
  there 's a very strong brotherly feeling there towards them because banat is divided between serbia and romania . 
  i think it might be different in the rest of the country though, 
  actually we love the serbians, 
   she eats like a ` normal ' person these days like where does she find a normal person to eat every day ? 
  spain is a bit mannish for my taste, 
  there is a cognate in romanian for `` cidade '' , but it means citadel . 
  it 's `` cetate '' ( pronounced chetate ), 
  i tried my best . 
  i know it from western romania , there it 's written as ple\u0219cavi\u021ba, 
  only pleskavica, 
  [ the accordion song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-z3yrhj1su ) [ the o-zone guy in one of the sexiest videos ever ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwxni8-5leg ), 
  there are many definitions of eastern europe . 
  geographically romania ( most parts ) can be placed in central europe . 
  but after world war ii eastern europe became identified with the iron curtain , so now all ex-communist countries are considered of eastern europe, 
  yes , what is not common is the amount of rain that we 've had this year, 
  it does n't rain much in barcelona , but man we 've had a shitty summer this year . 
  i finally got to experience how people from london feel, 
  that makes sense, 
  yes there is , you 've got the pig . 
  and not very realistic might i add, 
  they speak japanese , for pete 's sake . 
  that 's like from outer space or something, 
  your comparison does n't make much sense , comparing a country with a peninsula which was never united under a sole state , comprising [ unrelated ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkans ) cultures and languages . 
  you might as well compare spain to europe ... 
  there was never a country called balkans edit : perhaps you meant yugoslavia ... 
  why ? 
  he used to make up his own versions of words and pretend they were romanian words edit : like how people say in english , `` irregardless '' instead of `` regardless '' and stuff like that, 
  not sure if irony or ... 
  i 'm romanian and live in spain . 
  never felt that . 
  i have lots of italian and spanish friends . 
  it is true though that the expectations are very low about romanians , so they are really surprised to discover there are also educated people from romania that can come and take their jobs and can speak more languages than they do . 
  most unpleasant experiences i 've had were with people from ex-communist countries ( poland , czech republic , slovakia ), 
  they are bffs with russia , so they do n't count, 
  the last one is not really so stupid . 
  clocks had iiii instead of iv since middle ages, 
  it 's not known , it started in the middle ages, 
  no , [ this ] ( http://web.archive.org/web/19961220154510/http://www.yahoo.com/ ) was exciting in 1996, 
  the it sector is more developed in eastern europe , because lots of companies go there for cheap labor . 
  the thing is , in the latest years salaries went up because of high demand of software developers , so they are not so cheap anymore . 
  a software developer with 5 years of experience gets a better salary in bucharest than in madrid for instance, 
  sometimes * aux * means * of * , as in * filet-o-fish * ( * o * coms from the french * aux * ), 
  interesting read : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonia_ ( food ), 
  i assume because italy is the country where they most feel like home after romania . 
  the cultural differences are minimal . 
  the language is very easy to learn , even for uneducated people edit : also , i do n't know if you 're aware of , but in the last 10 years many italians have been `` flocking '' to the western side of romania too ( mostly timisoara and arad ) . 
  so it 's becoming an interchange, 
  what i meant was that the topic was italy , not romania . 
  just because i 'm from romania does n't mean i ca n't speak up, 
  it 's because we do n't even have the sliced bread yet, 
  yes . 
  and your point is ? 
  funny you should mention that , when i travelled through southern italy i felt like i was in southern romania . 
  so yeah , i said it . 
  nobody expects nothing from romania in terms of civilisation , but italy ... 
  have you ever been to the southern half of italy ? 
  they just discovered sliced bread there ... 
  that 's what i was saying . 
  i was n't trying to be mean . 
  it just happened that the feeling was mutual . 
  i found that slovakia was the most boring place on earth ... 
  ukraine should n't exist ( or should be much smaller at least ) , it comprises mostly territories occupied from adjacent countries, 
  that 's ok , me and my friends do n't like slovakia either, 
  there 's a lot of russian business in spain ( tourism , real estate , companies etc. ), 
  i do n't know if it 's something regional or whatever , but it 's used a lot among my friends, 
  as a place , as in `` in pizderia '' ( far far away ) , it 's used more in transylvania/banat i guess, 
   pripizdina funny , in romania we have pizderia , which is kinda the same thing, 
  what i do like about germans is that they do n't fake politeness , so to speak . 
  if your joke is not funny , they wo n't laugh just to please you, 
  in banat we are even better than the people in transylvania, 
  romania is still a pretty rural country , so traditional values are still kept . 
  religion is also a big factor . 
  orthodox christianity is all about keeping traditions and refusing progress . 
  what happened in romania was a radical transition from the far left to the far right . 
  after the fall of communism , any left-ish political view was considered wrong . 
  because religion was forbidden during communism , people now have become very religious ( at least the older generations ) . 
  actually , the words for the 2 ethnic groups are different , but because of some romanian letters that do n't exist in other languages , they become the same word if written with the basic latin alphabet ( romanians = rom\u00e2ni ; roma/gypsy = rrom or roman\u00ed ) . 
  the first one is pronounced roh-muhn , while the second is roh-mah-nee, 
  are we sure he 's not romanian living on welfare ? ... 
  there 's currently a movement towards independence in catalonia . 
  there are plans to organize a referendum for separation next year , but the central government does not approve ... 
  kinda the same in romanian , we call the country germania , the language is called germana , but we call the germans * nem\u021bi * ( slavic word for mute ), 
  [ these ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/targ-de-ie-romaneasca.jpg ) traditional romanian shirts called * ie *, 
  indiference , that 's even more hurtful than hate, 
  and teddy bear . 
  oh yeah , makes sense . 
  in the south they bring witches on the first day of school .
