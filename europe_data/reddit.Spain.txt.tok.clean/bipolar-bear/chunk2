  the suit is respectable ? 
  what about the man ? 
  agree with the first two , but the bitch was albanian though, 
  i like estonian and swedish . 
  they both sound very melodic . 
  the master manole put her into the walls and built the monastery . 
  the king came and killed all the builders anyway ( because he did n't like the monastery , yea he was like that ) and he left manole on top of the monastery . 
  but then the master manole could not stand hearing the wife 's prayers from within the walls and jumped off the top of the monastery and died and turned into a fountain . 
  the end . 
  that 's probably because in many languages latvia is called letonia, 
  sure , [ there ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/b0eppujcmaqsldm.jpg ) you go, 
  as expected , greece blames everyone but themselves, 
  were you baptized ? 
  in this case romance refers to the language family , not the religion , as in `` romance language country with orthodox religion '', 
  it is lavish when you 're bankrupt . 
  they want to spend the eu average , but they are n't an average working economy . 
   however , despite imposing deep cuts , greece still has one of the highest pensions bills in the eu , with nearly a quarter of greek government spending being allocated to pensions , according to eurostat . 
   denmark and sweden spend around $ 26,000 and $ 23,000 per person , comfortably the highest in the eu , and around ten times as much as the $ 2,600 and $ 2,300 spent by romania and bulgaria . 
  the greek government spends an average of $ 8,039 per year on each citizen , compared to an eu average of $ 13,153 . 
  so with all the cuts they are still just below eu average on pensions spending . 
  it seems to me they want a life style they just ca n't afford and they never could . 
  now see , that definition is pretty restrictive . 
  what if i slip a couple of pills in your drink and then i have sex with you while you are unconscious . 
  i did n't use any violence there , so there 's no rape . 
  that 's because we can import glade now to disguise the turds ' smell, 
  is malta even a real place ? 
  gazpacho has cucumbers and onions in it and is more wattery . 
  salmorejo is made with ham and boiled eggs and is thicker . 
  hey , we romanians let the us buttfuck us too, 
  i think it 's not so traumatizing because most often raping a man does n't involve physical violence , women use drugs or alcohol to get in control of the victim . 
  men use violence . 
  ouch ... 
  but to be honest , you receive the worst of the romanian immigration, 
  it 's kinda like portuguese , there are more phonemes in romanian than in spanish . 
  plus , even though the words are similar , very often the accent falls on a different syllable in romanian than in spanish , making it to sound not so familiar , ex : romanian * telef\u00f3n * vs spanish * tel\u00e9fono * , romanian * farmac\u00ede * vs spanish * farm\u00e1cia * etc. 
  i hate slovenia, 
  have you seen what they bring to eurovision every year ? 
  they diserve to be set on fire for those performances, 
  dobrogea is in the balkans, 
  for me it will always be [ ken lee ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqt-h753jhi ), 
  right , my bad, 
  spanish is wrong . 
  standard pronunciation of soft c is \u03b8 , which sound like the english * th * , but more sibilant . 
  the * s * pronunciation is typical in some southern parts , but it 's regional . 
   i lived in murcia that explains a lot . 
  murcia is like ... the deep spain . 
  strange ... 
  i 've lived in spain for more than 5 years and my impression is totally opposite . 
  i guess it depends more on who you hang out with . 
  i think not . 
  i had the opportunity to wait in line to vote at the romanian consulate in barcelona with hundreds of romanians and i heard some very homophobic comments from some people there . 
  i do n't know about other western countries , but most romanians in spain and italy come from families with low-income and low-education background who migrate there for work , but always dream to go back to romania after some years of saving . 
  so , many never get to really accept western views as their own , because they did n't want to go there for good , they were forced by circumstances . 
  being gay and living in barcelona ( perhaps the gayest city in europe ) i can tell it 's super . 
  but ( being a guy ) go 20 km outside of barcelona and kiss another guy or hold hands with him and people will look at you scandalized or at least as if you 're from another planet . 
  sure , spain is progressive and liberal overall when it comes to sexual minorities , but there 's still room for improvement outside the big cities . 
  romania ( kingdom ) in [ 1915 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/kingdom_of_romania_%281914%29.svg ) romania ( republic ) in [ 2015 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/eu-romania.svg ), 
  you 're just taller than average . 
  i 'm 1.85 , but my dad is 1.65 , so he neutralizes my excess height . 
  it seems reasonable , romania has a high number of senior citizens and most of them are not that tall . 
  i do n't know ... 
  i 've always imagined you more like [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/tilda_swinton_2012_shankbone.jpg ), 
  yeah there 's some hipster movement in romania with [ these ] ( https://deveghepatriei.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/511.jpg?w=500&amp;h=436 ) ancient dacian hats . 
  it 's the latest fashion . 
  yes , but what about the guys ? 
  [ this one is a pretty spread specimen in romania and outside ] ( http://tamtamuri.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/manelist-infocat-552x330.jpg ) [ and this is his female counterpart ] ( http://evenimente-constanta.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/pitipoanca-soba.jpg ) [ this is more of a northern type of face ] ( https://romaniadacia.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/romanian-woman-romanians-traditional-dress-nationale-romanesti.jpg?w=716 ), 
  of course . 
  they are first generation immigrants . 
  that 's not very accurate . 
  the spanish coast is full of russians who live there . 
  i think we should all sue italy for what the romans did to us, 
  i just bought a flight with norwegian airlines the other day . 
  fingers crossed . 
  i once went through serbia . 
  worst mistake ever . 
  spent 3 hours trying to get out of beograd towards temeswar . 
  the gps maps are not even remotely close to reality . 
  not even google maps can get you out of there . 
  the indication signs are scarce and in cyrillic . 
  the motorways end suddenly in unpaved fields without warning . 
  not a nice experience . 
  just accept it . 
  and do n't ask any questions . 
  lay low . 
  it 's that thing when you speak and people think you 're from serbia, 
  that 's how they teach it in romanian school . 
  i distinctively remember the geography teacher saying it has 2 capitals : one administrative and one social . 
  hey mongolians shaped the history of europe too ... maybe you should unite with them and form esu, 
  they probably think it 's a province in spain , therefore * why visit * applies to the entire peninsula, 
  and they say there 's no democracy in turkey, 
  that 's because we knew if we added you , we wo n't be last, 
  and more recently : - ukraine vs. russia war ( and the whole crimea ordeal ) - serbians vs albanians war in kosovo with us intervention, 
  i 'm not in favor of the monarchy and i think the catalans have the right to vote in a referendum , but i also think the last elections can not be used as a justification for the independence . 
  there should be a real referendum with each vote weighing equally . 
  oh so basically to distance themselves from the russian name, 
   and the capital city of ukraine aims to be called `` kyiv '' in english . 
  why ? 
  in romanian we call it cehia . 
  we did it before it was cool :p, 
  catalan is not entirely understandable to any spaniard .
