  there 's a high degree of mutual intelligibility , but that happens with italian as well . 
  \u00bf que ? 
  i would say somewhere between italy and france . . 
  does this still exist ? 
  i remember it being all the rave in romania in the 80s or 90s , but it 's been years since i last saw a eurocrem . 
  anyone else get that * gay and does n't know it * vibe from most of those fotos ? 
  you are right about that . 
  the same is true for spanish . 
  the spanish in latin america sounds a lot more like old spanish . 
  on the same note , even though all romance languages evolved from vulgar latin , romanian is the language with the highest number of words coming from classical latin . 
  if you 'd bothered to read the article you 'd have found answers there  the most commonly accepted theory , advanced by polish scholar zbigniew go\u0142\u0105b , is that the innovations came from different sources and the languages influenced each other : some features can be traced from latin , slavic or greek languages , while others , particularly features that are shared only by romanian , albanian , macedonian and bulgarian , could be explained by the substratum kept after romanization ( in the case of romanian ) or slavicization ( in the case of bulgarian ) . 
  albanian was influenced by both latin and slavic , but it kept many of its original characteristics . 
  several arguments favour this theory . 
  first , throughout the turbulent history of the balkans , many groups of people moved to another place , inhabited by people of another ethnicity . 
  these small groups were usually assimilated quickly and sometimes left marks in the new language they acquired . 
  second , the use of more than one language was common in the balkans before the modern age , and a drift in one language would quickly spread to other languages . 
  third , the dialects that have the most `` balkanisms '' are those in regions where people had contact with people of many other languages . 
  serbian is the only slavic language i like the sound of . 
  maybe i 'm biased because i used to live near the border with serbia . 
  i 'm totally impartial regarding this subject , but i think the last elections for the autonomous government are more relevant than this poll . 
  the results were pretty 50-50 and i even dare to say the number of voters in favor of independence was a bit lower than the number of voters which do not want independence . 
  the separatist parties won just because the election system is unfair , and some people 's votes weigh more than others ' .

  caucasus is considered the border of europe, 
  well , from my experience as a romanian living and traveling through western europe , people there tend to be more politically correct when expressing their opinions , poles are way more blatant and disrespectful , that 's why i 'm not really interested in meeting polish people or visiting poland . 
  it 's actually latvia, 
  oh i 'm so hooked on that show , i just found season 3 online a couple of days ago, 
  you have a lovely voice , 
  i meant the accent they mock in the snl skit `` the californians '', 
  i can understand why you would feel that , do n't want to be mean or anything , but we get lots of tourists from the us here in barcelona where i live and a lot of them from california ( i can recognize the accent ) , and their clothing style is so anti-fashion , it 's irritating . 
  i do n't see what 's with the obsession of wearing clothes 2 sizes bigger . 
  you know , i used to think that . 
  then i went to stockholm a couple of months ago . 
  i was not impressed . 
  maybe i had too high expectations ... 
  crowded party ? 
  in sweden ? 
  i seriously think people should pass an iq test before being allowed to vote or being elected, 
  ** \\ #justrussianthings **, 
  ukraine 's territory is kinda artificially enlarged . 
  it should be divided between russia , romania and poland and leave them whatever remains . 
  of course they do n't . 
  most of them only graduated primary school . 
  you may be right ... 
  but there are companies out there ( wizzair ) who charge for this . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  i like the sound of serbian for some reason . 
  other than that , not a big fan of slavic languages . 
  oh please , norwegian does n't even seem so low cost compared to ryanair or vueling . 
  they even provide wifi on board . 
  they do n't make you pay extra for every single little perk they offer ( like chosing your seat or having your ticket stored in your smartphone ), 
  i think he likes more to be the bottom, 
  [ are you even trying ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsk_j6cxg90 ), 
  i was referring to the phonology . 
  did nobody had ears back then either ? 
  sounds like a mix of serbian and russian to me, 
  yes, 
  another hidden gem from romania : https://youtu.be/m8gxpp5zlyy, 
  this deserves to be so much higher . 
  not sure what i love more , his creepy gay and does n't know it smile , or the grossed out face of the blonde girl when he tries to kiss her, 
  why is he wearing the spanish flag ? 
  it was later revealed that the guy on the right actually had parkinson 's . 
  most of them are pretty obscure , they appear on trashy local channels , but become viral on youtube . 
  just like a gruesome car accident you ca n't take your eyes of, 
  how can * lup * and * vilkas * come from the same word ? 
  that 's just weird ... 
  most murders occur in rural areas , because alcohol . 
  cities are much safer compared to western europe . 
  we need a miracle right now . 
  i want to believe, 
  i was pleasantly surprised that most young doctors in romania do n't accept bribes , even if you insist to make them gifts . 
  they are more willing to help than the old generation and do n't expect shit in return , even if they have crappy salaries . 
  i prefer a young perhaps inexperienced one over a `` guru '' any time now . 
  i read this as : our only help is santa now  . 
  you might as well ask santa claus for help, 
  incepe sa devina repetitiv si jenant . 
  yeah there are . 
  vaduva is mostly found in the south . 
  if if 's in another region , it 's due to migration . 
  names like amariei , ababei , awhateverthefuck are typical in moldova ( east ) . 
  transylvania and banat have lots of particular surnames as well . 
  detroit , arkansas , cleveland , just to name a few . 
  i would rather live in romania than in those areas . 
  deadly spiders, 
  some parts of the us are way shittier than romania , no affense to the muricans, 
  9 euros / month, 
  there 's something about cultural preservation , which aparently bullfighting is part of . 
  it 's still bullshit , because all cultures have backwards traditions , but that does n't stop them from banning them , it 's called evolution . 
  they should regulate it in such way that it becomes a pain in the ass for the organizers . 
  like the bull must be fed only baby wheat germ kept at a constant temperature of 23 degrees c . the bull and the matador must have regular psychotherapy together and prove they are not emotionally affected by the act . 
  the people on the arena must yell `` hail satan ! '', 
  whenever the bull gets a shot ... 
  actually when i travelled to stockholm i was surprised how many people there spoke basic spanish . 
  then again , spain seems to be their favorite holiday destination . 
  well psychiatric care is part of the free healthcare system and you can get therapy as part of the treatment . 
  unfortunately the psychiatrists in romania are more focused in getting you addicted to pills instead of treating you , so that you can feed the system .
