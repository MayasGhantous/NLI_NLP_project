hah , good question !, 
   no filthy socialist have set foot on moncloa ever . 
  ftfy . 
  not even felipe gonzalez was socialist . 
  he was just another corrupt , and a murderer . 
  just to put things in perspective : * the political party was created 8 months ago . 
  * before the elections to the european parliament , polls gave them 0 or 1 seat . 
  they got 5 . 
  the party was 4 months old at the time . 
  * the party originated ( at least spiritually ) from the [ 15m movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%e2%80%9312_spanish_protests ) , and has an horizontal organization . 
  edited for clarity . 
  even the medical experts were against it . 
  it was a purely political decision . 
  we have an incompetent government . 
  there 's another possible infection victim , which is being quarantined with * blankets * . 
  much of the political effort in those regions ( and the whole country ) is day by day wasted in independance related shit . 
  everybody ( politicians , news channels and papers , us people ) waste time talking about it instead of talking about many more important subjects , like the institutionalized corruption we have , education , economy , etc. 
  i want a referendum so we can end with it for a while ( at least a generation , regardless of the result ) , and put our efforts into more productive things . 
  i think the result would be no . 
  and the same in catalonia . 
  and ... 
  but i think we should ask them , for they have the right to decide . 
  not oficially . 
  the king . 
  spain : no . 
  the two main political parties are so full of shit there is n't even a political debate anymore . 
  they are focused on inner issues . 
  and one of them ( the ruling party ) is too busy arresting people for sharing jokes and sarcasm on twitter and hiding corruption . 
  this country is a fucking shame ... 
  the king * is * above the law here in spain . 
  so is stated in our constitution . 
  the king killed his younger brother by shooting him in the face , back when both were teenagers . 
  just to give you an idea . 
  it was an accident ( supposedly ) , but makes you wonder ... [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/juan_carlos_i_of_spain#alfonso.27s_death ), 
  i think they mean they still have n't started the excavations . 
  me too . 
  ** spain : ** ** most popular ** : probably mahou . 
  ** the best one ** : estrella galicia , no doubt . 
   is n't that what mafias do ? 
  threatening states if their demands are n't met ? 
  free doom . 
  as an european citizen , one of the things i 'm most proud of is our stand in homosexuality . 
  not only legally , but socially . 
  at least here in madrid it 's pretty usual to see homo couples kissing and holding hands in public spaces . 
  feels good man . 
  sounds plausible . 
  a total block would make people start asking what 's going on ( if it 's true that national media are censoring the protests ) , and when they find out they would possibly join . 
  people here in spain are protesting a lot . 
  like , literally every day . 
  some day there 's a demonstration against healthcare privatization , next day against education privatization or pro-catholic , pro-segregation reform , next day against banks , etc. 
  no , we are not `` revolting '' . 
  revolt for me has a violent connotation . 
  [ 1 ] we 've lost a lot , yes . 
  but much of it was a necessary loss . 
  we needed to raise taxes , we needed to cut some subsidies . 
  i even think income taxes should be higher . 
  spaniards are protesting against what we feel are unnecessary , political and ideological measures , like healthcare-related privatizations [ 2 ] , or against corruption ( in my opinion , spain 's biggest problem right now [ 3 ] ) . 
  [ 1 ] the debate of whether we should start using violence or not is an interesting one , nonetheless . 
  [ 2 ] surprisingly , many politicians work for the private companies that are now in charge of those recently privatized hospitals ( like capio ) . 
  also , some studies have arisen showing that privatized hospitals are much more expensive than before ( when they were publicly-run ) . 
  [ 3 ] some months ago , el pa\u00eds , our most read newspaper , revealed that the governing party , partido popular , has had an illegal financing scheme for 20 years ( yes , currently going on ) . 
  the hand-written b accountings of the last treasurer were made public , along with some swiss accounts with around 20 million euros and financing details ( company a gives , let 's say , 200k $ to partido popular , and some months later that company receives a public contract to , say , build some public infrastructure ) . 
  you ca n't imagine how outrageous this fucking shit is . 
  young people have no past to compare to , study shows . 
  you mean usa , or us . 
  eeuu is spanish . 
  welcome to the club ... 
  yes . 
  everywhere . 
  your society , democratically , has , at some point of history , decided that it wants to pay taxes to finance roads , education , healthcare , etc. 
  and you , as part of that society , have the obligation of collaborating . 
  but if you are not part of that society , you do n't have that obligation . 
  that 's why tourists visiting can ask for a tax return . 
  the society owns it , yes . 
  and you , as part of that society , have the right to use it . 
  you burrow the roads in your way to work . 
  your kids borrow free education . 
  you ( unless you live in the us ) borrow free health care . 
  and a very long etc. 
  yes , you said it perfectly . 
  equality is achieved ( in part ) by redistribution of wealth . 
   inequality comes from keeping what you earn say i lend you my car so you can go to work . 
  if you did n't borrow my car , you would not be able to go to work . 
  do you think 100 % of what you earn is `` yours '' ? 
  or do you think you should give me something in return , since i paid for that car ? 
  well , i do n't know . 
  banning them feels like not letting them express their opinion , even if i ( you , we ) do n't agree with it ( insert voltaire quote here ) . 
  oh here it comes again . 
  el pa\u00eds also states that the kid had enough material in his backpack to build a molotov cocktail , but he did n't use it . 
  because these people could be my family or friends , but the kids starving in sierra leona are n't . 
  the same reason i do n't give a fuck about a traffic accident in australia , but one in barcelona worries me . 
  the optimistic in me wants to think they adopted the `` prepare for the worst '' posture , so every survivor is viewed as a gift . 
  i really hope there are survivors ... 
  maybe the pilots tried an emergency landing , and slided for a while before crashing . 
  the cni ( spanish intelligence agency ) warned the government a week before the bombing that an islamic group was planning an inminent , huge terrorist act . 
  the spanish ira . 
   but if they went after a civilian target , they would call it in beforehand what about el corte ingl\u00e9s ? 
  as far as i remember they did n't call . 
  eta killings were political : mainly politicians and guardia civil ( militaries ) . 
  it was pretty clear for us , since the very first moment , that the 11m bombings was not their style .
