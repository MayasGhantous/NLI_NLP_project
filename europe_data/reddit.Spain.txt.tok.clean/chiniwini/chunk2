  when eta put a bomb , they called an hour in advance to the police to anonunce it . 
  with this bombing , they even said the same or the day after that they did n't do it . 
   this type of attack does n't need to be planned very far in advance but it needs to be planned . 
  they do n't have tons of plastic explosives sitting around in their basement . 
  they need to make explosives , make the detonators , study the scenarios ( security controls , people affluence , etc. 
  ) , agree on when to do it , etc. 
  i 'd say it 's almost impossible to prepare it all in 3 days ( since friday ) . 
  they probably meant to do it this or next month anyway , they just made it sooner . 
  i meant the one in op 's pic haha, 
  that thing ( semla ) looks photoshoped . 
  je partment of justice . 
  it 's a french thing . 
  dammit uk , get your shit together . 
  nice catch . 
  wrong why ?

   our gdp is ~ 22 % of spain 's . 
  that means that around 4,6 % of the totality of spain 's debt is because the catalan government catalonia 's gdp is 200.323 mill . 
  spain 's is 1.575.113 mill . 
  200.323 / 1.575.113 is 12.7 % , not 22 % .

  oh really ? 
  i must be sleeping under a bridge , then . 
  my house is in a quite nice area ( i 'd say one of the top 20 areas in spain ) , and it 's less than 2k month . 
  * big house rent : 1k * internal service person : 1k * chauffeur : 1k * mid time gardener : 0.5 k * food , gas , bills , etc : let 's say 2k , but i think 1k would be enough . 
  * private university : around 50k year , * 2 children = 100k/year , = 8.4 k/month * ferrari : 200k / 10 years / 12 months = 1.6 k that 's 15.5 k. 
  maybe you should pay your chauffeur more . 
  but maybe you do n't need a chauffeur at all , because you would like to drive your ferrari yourself . 
  of course it 's worse . 
  but we are not discussing whether it 's worse or better . 
  the question is that , in absolute terms , it is * bad * . 
  that 's what he said . 
  he did n't say `` omg i 'm earning too little , i need more money !!, 
  '' , he just said `` my family is having a rough time adapting to the new salary '' . 
  god , he even left the private company he was working at , and that 's something a lot of ( i 'd say most ) mp 's do n't do ( for example , our president , mariano rajoy , has a private salary too , from a job he does n't do ) . 
  everybody is going mad on him , but i think he is completely right . 
  if you are used to living with 15.000 $ / month ( or whatever it is ) , when you go down to 5.000 $ / month you * do * have a tough time . 
  just imagine yourself earning 15k $ / month . 
  most people would buy a ferrari * the very first day * . 
  you would probably have a big house , with internal service , a gardener , maybe even a chauffeur . 
  why ? 
  because you can . 
  maybe your 2 children are attending trinity college . 
  maybe you give 2k every month to charity . 
  what do you do when you go down to 5k/month ? 
  you * do have a hard time * . 
  just imagine your salary is divided by 3 over the night . 
  you would have a hard time , would n't you ? 
  i would . 
  another completely different question here ( which almost nobody has raised , as everybody is just yelling `` you should try living with 400 $ / month !! '' ), 
  is whether or not somebody who is earning  5k/month is ethically appropiate to legislate a country , and even if he can do so correctly . 
  edit : just for context , my flag would be the spanish one . 
  and my parents and my brother are unemployed . 
  it 's not blind faith . 
  it 's a universal human right . 
  and we have to defend it as such . 
  god , this whole thread is sick . 
  your comment stinks of xenophobia . 
  edit : i 'll elaborate . 
   protesting against populations from cultures that hold values incompatible with our own does not equate to being offensive , scary , spreading hate , etc. 
  yes , it does , at least 90 % of the times . 
   you do not tolerate intolerance and sleep comfortably thinking all will be well in the morning . 
  that 's why i 'm replying to you . 
   these ideas of freedom of speech and religion , you ca n't play games with them . 
  these things need to be thought through completely , to the very end , every little detail . 
  you leave no stone unturned . 
  it means you have to be willing to protect the culture and civilization that produced the very values you are praising . 
  oh god , i 'm invoking godwin 's law here . 
   if respecting the differences of other people means allowing ritual slaughter of animals , and physical abuse of children ( circumsion ) , honor killings , oppression of women , homophobia , and general lack of integration . . you 're doing it wrong . 
  your last paragraph is just sick . 
  if ritual slaughter of animals , physical abuse of animals , honor killings , etc , are legal in your country , they are allowed to do it , just as you are . 
  if it is not legal , they are n't allowed to do it , just as you are n't . 
  it 's that easy . 
  you do n't need to mix race , culture , country of born in all this . 
  you have a clear problem . 
  you do n't think about people ( people who brake laws , people who do bad things ) , you think about cultures . 
  as an european myself ( and maybe because of said reason ) i surely think it 's not a strong enough reason by itself to defend the 2nd amendment . 
  i have conflicting feelings myself about said right , but my initial point was to relate the right to carry arms with a level of responsibility , and demitify its relationship with violence levels . 
  in spain , where i live , getting a gun ( legally or illegally ) is quite difficult , so when someone wants to kill someother they just stab them to death . 
  edit : also , 2 funny anecdotes about guns where i live . 
  the king of spain , juan carlos i , ** killed ** , when he was around 17 , his younger brother , shooting him in the face . 
  officially it was an accident . 
  it happened a long time ago , in the 70s if i recall correctly . 
  also , one of the king 's grandson ( i do n't know if heir to the throne or not ) , shot himself in his feet in another ( officially , again ) accident , just some months ago . 
  i do think it 's useful , in the sense it somehow helps justify ( as if a justification was ever needed ) the right to stand against and overthrow a corrupt government . 
  you know , the fact that an amendment was made to the constitution to , in part , assure citizens have the possibility to fight a bad government enforces such right . 
  also , do n't think nsa and such have * that much power * . 
  they have infrastructure , tools and knowledge , but in a revolution ( as in a reasonably justified one ) their human power would for sure be quite decreased , just because empathy , shame or even fear . 
  the same way egyptian military joined the protestors during the arab spring ( yes , this is not a very good example , but you get the idea ) . 
  but yes , of course it does n't make the same sense it made three centuries ago . 
  well , you have to understand it in its context . 
  that law passed around the 18th century , when the government had the same arms and military power ( at least in mainland ) as you , just in bigger numbers . 
  so a civil militia could easily outpower a big government . 
  i will bear the shame until the last of my days . 
  i do n't know if you just copied it , but you wrote austria and vienna wrong . 
  austria is the country . 
  i think the fact that us citizens have the right to carry arms has little ( or , better said , not as much as you may think ) effect on the violence rates . 
  i personally think it is more related to things such as poverty , `` the war on drugs '' , racism , etc. 
  usa is * way * more poor than what many people think . 
  as someone posted below , switzerland also recognizes the right to carry arms , and it 's violence rates are ridiculous .
