here 's the difference : you do n't get beaten up , you are n't discriminated against in terms of housing , you are n't subject to a different set of laws for having an h1b . 
  courts do n't discriminate against you based on your visa status like they do in the gulf . 
  i , too , was on an h1b , which turned into an o1 . 
  i do n't think i was paid 1 cent less than my non-h1b counterparts -- our salaries were public inside the company , and given that i received more spot bonuses than anyone else on the team , i would n't be surprised if i was paid more . 
   it 's literally how h1b visa works in the us btw . 
  no , it 's not , but keep making false equivalences . 
  malta and luxemboug are missing, 
  i thought they were done , after the bombing ? 
  good to see them back , though i still wo n't buy a copy . 
  all praise be to him !, 
  perhaps , but it does n't strike me as quite so fervent as spain . 
   italy you must mean spain , as i 'm not aware of any inclination for independence in italy . 
  `` angry '' is what all those that have wanted change throughout history have been described as . 
  respect !, 
  a party that 's not in power does n't get to enact its manifesto , sure , a party in government ( yes , even a junior partner in coalition ) ought to be able to enact ** some ** of its manifesto -- the lib dems abandoned their manifesto to aid the tories and this is why i hope they 're confined to the dustbin . 
  i thought it was `` vote labour , get snp '' ? 
   keep it separate or face something we have seen in lebanon . 
  the switzerland of the middle east that got fucked over by the muslims . 
  so , lebanon getting fucked over had nothing to do with israel expelling its arab citizens en masse in the 40s and nobody taking them in besides lebanon , a state that was too weak to keep them out , and the subsequent israeli-initiated aggressions against it ? 
  oh , your poor pet israel , lead by the psychopath netenyahu can do no wrong , right ? 
  they sit on land , stolen from people like my own grandmother , not allowing she or her family to return , yet they are the noble ones . 
  they shell and invade their neighbours every time an election is called , yet they are the noble ones . 
  you have no ** clue ** about lebanon . 
  read you some [ robert fisk ] ( http://www.amazon.com/pity-nation-abduction-lebanon-books/dp/1560254424 ) and you may yet be saved from a life of ignorant , right-wing nutjobbery that passes without notice on most of the english-language internet . 
   trust them , is about becoming a majority in my country . 
  i say no to further islamization of the netherlands . 
  what they say is not what counts , it is what they do . 
  there are 50 islam nations , none are free and none has equal treatment for all . 
  islam majorities have yet to prove their end game includes equal treatment and freedom for their minorities . 
  if we look at turkey we see another example of how a secular state on the way to join the free west is ripped apart by islam . 
  do you have any idea how many journalists are in jail over there now ? 
  i do n't have a problem with islam as a faith -- it 's a minority of practitioners of said faith that have more in common with ** you ** than with those at the mosque i went to for the first 14 years of my life . 
  i 've said this before and i 'll say it again -- there is absolutely ** nothing ** wrong with the five pillars ( copying from wikipedia and giving my twist on what they mean ) : - shahadah -- there is no god but god and muhammed was his messenger . 
  just as jesus was also his messenger , as well as moses and abraham . 
  - salat -- praying multiple times/day . 
  praying takes most muslims less than 10 minutes . 
  even if you do n't believe in islam , which i do not anymore and i 'd love to explain why if you are ready to have a civilised conversation to that extent , it 's still a serene site to see -- the taxi driver , the beggar and a computer programmer , all standing side-by-side , in silence and exchanging greetings and head-nods at approximately the same time . 
  - zakat -- charity , which i consider the primary and most important pillar , boils down to taking care of those less fortunate than ourselves . 
  - sawm -- fasting , no comment . 
  - hajj -- pilgrimage to mecca for spiritual cleansing . 
  i have no desire to go to saudi arabia until they figure out that they need to treat people ** outside ** the mosque , the same as they do inside the mosque ( where the taxi driver , pauper and financier stand more or less side-by-side in silent reverence , pointed out above ) . 
  but the broader point is to travel to expand your mind here . 
  i 've done this , i was born in the netherlands , grew up in britain , did my tertiary in the united states , now work as a venture capitalist in silicon valley . 
  the 5,000 european muslims that went to join isis and get their rocks off have nothing to do with me . 
  the bombings in 2005 in london have nothing to do with me , i rode that same tube line to work every day for 2 years after all . 
   if i see repeated designs of society in muslim countries where they do want to get into peoples business , where they do treat one group different from the other and where they do suppress rather than enable to become and be whoever you want , then it is no longer just co\u00efncidence , but an expression of values that just differ from ours . 
  then i say , let them live in their muslim countries and us here in the west in ours . 
  but you do n't say that , and you do n't see it , because your impression of islam comes from the news -- you do n't interact with muslims daily - if you did , you 'd realise that all muslims are not out to destroy our country ( as i 'm also dutch , irrespective of what you and your butt buddies , ayaan hirsi ali and geert wilders , would like to think ) . 
  in fact , i would posit that i hold the dutch values of freedom higher than you lot do . 
  i would further posit that were we to sit in a pub , i 'd gladly buy us both the alcoholic drink of our choice . 
  that said , we do not , nor will i ever , condemn a class of people for the actions of a subset of their ranks . 
  perhaps a statistics course would be in order for you ? 
  then you 'll understand the concept of sample size and selection biases . 
  i have a doctorate in statistics and can send you enough material to occupy you for the rest of your life . 
  let me know if you 're interested . 
  specifically , what 's wrong with toronto ? 
  as my name should suggest to you , / u/bennie300 , we share a birth country . 
  why should 1 billion people prove that they are not evil if you do n't have to prove westerners are n't evil for colonialism ? 
  where are our reparations to indonesia for [ cultuurstelsel ] ( http://weloveindonesia.tumblr.com/ ) , for example , or south africa for the boer wars ? 
   putting mental efforts in seeing others as less as yourself has a way in history to turn really bad . 
  indeed it does , but is that not precisely what you are doing by criticising the larger islam bodypolitik for the actions of crazed lunatics ? 
  is that not what netenyahu does when he [ waxes ecstatic about the iranian nuclear bomb ] ( http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/04/02/netanyahu-sends-very-blunt-message-to-obama-following-announcement-of-iran-deal/ ) , which [ does n't appear to have existed since the 1979 revolution ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_program_of_iran ) ? 
   at this moment imo the ball is the muslims court to show us they can produce free and equal societies . 
  how about this ? 
  iraq was an equal society under saddam -- he was secular and killed everyone with equal vigour . 
  was it free ? 
  not by a long shot . 
  but , who put him in power ? 
  the us did . 
  why ? 
  because his predecessor refused to invade next door iran . 
  there were long queues of business people outside iraqi diplomatic outposts in britain and the united states throughout the 1980s , their chequebooks open to the tune of millions of pounds , streaming in and out of the embassies , said chequebooks considerably heavier going in than coming out . 
  indeed , we knew saddam killed the kurds , he did so with gas provided by us . 
  we knew what it was for . 
  saddam did n't keep it secret . 
  so , while he may ordered the killings , our corporations enabled them to be worse . 
   what islamic immigration has done to countries like france and the uk . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  muslims ( whether practicing or non-practicing ) have contributed heaps to both societies . 
  france would never have won the 1998 world cup were it not for their muslim minority ( of which zidane belongs ) . 
  britain would not have the best arab food in the world were it not for their ( mainly muslim ) arab minority . 
  if this is a concern the swedes have , then i 'll have to reevaluate my vacation plans . 
   you made it look like his rise goes hand in hand with racism . 
  it is much more about islam . 
  well , the english word for it is sectarianism , but regardless , his ideas still need to be left in the dustbin of history . 
   it 's been done in toronto and vancouver and , what , pray tell , is wrong with either of these cities ? 
  only for the loudest , for the rest , it 's meh, 
  it would be just like america !, 
   a radical socialist when they need someone who can sort out their economy no , all the other candidates promised some variation of more of the same . 
  syrizia gave them another option and the voters took it . 
  or perhaps you 'd rather see shining dawn in charge of greece ? 
  i did n't either , then i realised that most people around me expect me to , so i learned and i suggest you consider doing the same . 
  there are some times when having a laugh is not appropriate . 
  i 'd say that this is definitely one of them . 
  just sent a [ letter from america ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=numtzstnot8 ), 
  / u/grotestruisvogel just did . 
  same reason there 's no european competitor for google , oracle , or microsoft, 
   where 's the logic in that ? 
  no , just give them us passports -- sorry , i live here and some of the punters i meet are truly something else . 
  ... not wealthy so demand for imports is ** not ** high , no ?
