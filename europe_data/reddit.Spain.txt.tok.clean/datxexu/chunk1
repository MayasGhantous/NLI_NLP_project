algarve and bavaria have strong red on some delicate feelings ... 
  these kind of news that only spanish people find funny ... 
  probably the most underrated business district in the world . 
  it has to be way cooler than it is said to be . 
  no , buy them from caf !, 
  it 's beautiful but i 'm allergic :(, 
  lacks of trump admitting climate change , but good shitpost, 
  * ca n't you just send me a message ? 
  the so-called `` rural exile '' dates back to the 1950s . 
  most young people went out to study or work to bigger towns and cities back then and still nowadays , as most people are given a good education level , they usually go to the cities where universities are . 
  they may get a job there as well , meet a partner and have a family in the city . 
  fewer people settle in their villages . 
  i do n't think language is the problem that holds us ... 
  i 'd say it 's housing ownership and family network . 
   there was not a lot of people going abroad during the franco years ? 
  yes , but most inmigration was temporary , so they came back . 
  in the sense that we were n't * that * forced to leave the country . 
  ( on the other hand , portugal has been growing a lot the last decades before the crisis . ), 
  not to brag , but i know some portuguese people and their diaspora is way more bigger than ours . 
  economy may be getting better but i think our expats will remain wherever they are as wages and career opportunities are better out there . 
  it can be , but there 's some controversy about it . 
  ~ ~ spain 's case is a bit tricky . ~ ~ some expats do n't register in the embassies - it 's not mandatory - so you ca n't have a trustworthy number . 
  also , lots of old people . 
  the 15 million refers to ethnic albanians , not to born-in-albania albanians , right ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.lawebdelprogramador.com ) , [ this ] ( http://www.forosdelweb.com ) and [ this ] ( https://es.stackoverflow.com ) . 
  anyway , programmers usually look up english stackoverflow, 
  did a bit of research and you 're right , but anyway it is a thing . 
  most people call `` erasmus '' to any student exchange program . 
  double the feminity !, 
  eire and greece ... ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
   funny enough , individual regional labels are quite trusted . 
  dirty dutch !, 
  you can make it seem logical if you oversimplify saying that spanish universities `` import '' students that `` local production '' ca n't provide . 
  ^ p.d. 
  : ^ which ^ is n't ^ true ^ obv, 
  the world has lost a good trump secretary, 
  alright i see it , thanks !, 
  seems like an alternative aftermath of wwii ? 
  now that you mention it i agree with you . 
  i could hear more words without knowing what it meant than in other languages . 
  / r/scottishpeopletwitter ?? 
  any proof ? 
  more or less so , not all but most, 
  if i saw her in madrid i would assume she 's a * stunning * pickpocket, 
  [ article in spanish ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2017/03/14/actualidad/1489504031_192717.amp.html ), 
  [ a good research in the question ] ( https://qz.com/273214/how-spains-bloody-history-gave-it-the-worlds-highest-concentration-of-elevators/ ) , you guessed right . 
  at least it 's not a risk game, 
  i do n't really understand what 's up with us . 
  it 's like the houses were just for the tourists and the rich , despite living in a fairly big country for european standards .

  we wuz irish and shiet, 
  russia must be triggered by this xd, 
  impressive !, 
  did n't know that !, 
  thanks !, 
  i 'd say the author just read some travel diaries from english , french and german travellers who went to spain in the first half of the 19th century , and twisted the stereotypes . 
   spain does n't need men who know , but oxes who work [ bravo murillo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/juan_bravo_murillo ), 
  based in this [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5xfi1k/how_much_do_europeans_exercise/dehsvtj/ ) , i think we misunderstood the question, 
  i thought browsing reddit was a job already !, 
  wonder how the photographer could reach places i did n't even know ( in spain ) where there are way more famous carnivals by here . 
  madrid 's carnival is n't a thing outside school parties or club 's gigs . 
  also , if anyone is wondering where southwestern paganism went to , it 's here . 
  russia said !, 
  what 's up poland ?

  we had to have any flaw i suppose, 
  it 's astonishing how , despite the us-china relatively good relationship until a few years ago , and having russia in china 's back , russia and china still like each other . 
  we already told !, 
  along with segovia and \u00c1vila, 
  as a curiosity , in `` asterix & obelix in hispania '' it has a reference to franco . 
   a lot of stations on the city center that 's the problem . 
  it should n't just be there , while 2/3 of madrid 's population lives outside the m-30 ring . 
  we must be better at fooling then , 
  what is chilean law ? 
  these kind of ads need their own subreddit . 
  something like r/vintageeuropeanads . 
  they are curious enough for me to watch them . 
  nowadays they do n't experiment as much with them or they follow a more specific style . 
   and they will pay for it [ because you ca n't !,
