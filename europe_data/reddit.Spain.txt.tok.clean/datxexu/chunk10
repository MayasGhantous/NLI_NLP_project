  and i do n't think it 's fair mixing it up with \u00bf romanticism ? 
  - probably you have the don juan/don giovanni/casanova/french guy painting nudes stereotype . 
  on the other hand , i do think it 's true we 're more likely to say we 're [ * epicurean * ] ( http://www.dictionary.com/browse/epicurean ) , and conflate it with short-term mentality . 
  out of truly genuine curiosity , what lead you to think it 's the best period in russia 's history ? 
  economical prosperity , peaceful times ... ? 
  i know some institutions have digitalised some old books to make them free to download , and you can check if a library has a certain - physical - book as well . 
  probably `` the compulsory one '' would be el quijote itself . 
  he probably did n't even needed it being a touristy place ... 
  had the lyrics of madrid 's community anthem . 
  nobody could care less , honestly . 
  now it 's starting to decline , very very * despacito * . 
  surprisingly , gypsies and morrocans usually get along pretty well . 
  that 's the point ... which lyrics you use . 
  when [ raphael ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-haka7gcq0y ) sings in english it makes me sad as he really has a powerful voice . 
  [ it mentions spain and it 's old . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psegpzf8csi ) now seriously , search for manolo escobar . 
  most patriotic singer , ever . 
  another old song linked to patriotism may be [ the spanish legion anthem \\ ( groom ( s ) of death \\ ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg3rtimgkc0 ), 
  sorry , how 's the song called ? 
   when 2 guys came up to me ( a person walking fast with earbuds , in a central station ) and asked for my phone number because `` you seem like a nice person '' . 
  / r/seduction, 
  honestly i do understand why kids want the presents the christmas day before the epiphany . 
  in spain you have the christmas ' school holidays among these 2 days , you would n't enjoy the presents you were given as much as if you were if given the christmas day . 
  i 'd say no as well . 
  probably the best answer . 
  people just do n't care about eu . 
  we know it 's a thing we belong to and blah blah ... but the main focus is the local politics , not brussels or strasbourg . 
  i like it but i could never get to learn it in deep . 
  i usually search for habits and daily lives of people in the past , especially in the antiquity . 
  i do a little research in pre-roman tribes , rome and muslim spain in particular . 
  here , pizza delivers drive motorcycles . 
  the rest is copied from yours iirc . 
   a good week is usually $ 200 in tips plus a $ 200 ( 178.61 euro ) pay check and i get paid twice a month so i bring home around $ 1200 - $ 1500 a month . 
  is this something that could support a flat where you live ? 
  you 'll definitely need to share the flat with someone else , if you want to eat and regular stuff . 
   how popular is the ak47 ? 
  illegal . 
   is gun collecting a hobby there ? 
  nope , and if it is , it 's a niche . 
   2 ) how do the french ( and the rest of modern europe ) feel about napoleon ? 
  from what i have read in this sub , probably the british - for being the main enemy - , the portuguese - for trying to invade portugal along with spain - and the spaniards - things got complicated and the historical roots of our democracy comes from the resistance to the napoleonic army - are the only ones who regard napoleon in a bad way . 
   a woman asked a friend of mine where we kept our viking reservations . 
  like the way native americans have been put on reserves , some women thought we had done the same to vikings . 
  * invokes all saints , mary and christ 's advocations that exist throughout all branches of christianity *, 
  yes , that would be a waste of energy . 
  what i do is open the windows at night , when temperatures are around 25\u00bac / 77\u00baf . 
  the point is that it does n't carry any consequences for the * persona non grata * . 
  you wo n't be detanied or prosecuted or anything by the authorities , it 's just symbolic . 
  dream job , where you ca n't be fired until you 've commited a crime or something like that . 
  and a good wage . 
  in those areas where there is n't too much industry or jobs , most of the middle class works for the government , may them be civil servants or other people who works for the government , such as doctors in public health or military people - i do n't know if they count as servants as well in english , but they do in spanish - . 
  but it 's difficult to be hired as one , as you have to do * oposiciones * - public examinations - , and there 's private schools to help you learn the subjects you have to study , such as the spanish constitution . 
  british english . 
  nobody has pointed me out my `` accent '' . 
  in fact , i do n't think i speak close to one or another - i can even vary within the same conversation out of insecurity - but the spanish phonetics ' influence . 
  political systems usually taught in a subject called social sciences . 
  it covers history and geography . 
  so you can be taught the political system as well . 
  philosophy covers the enlightment theories . 
  do you refer to [ loan translations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/calque ) as well ? 
  in computer science , a library is code used by a program or several ones . 
  library in spanish is * biblioteca * - word of greek origin - , while we loaned the meaning of software library to include it in * librer\u00eda * - bookshop - . 
  library and * librer\u00eda * come from latin * libraria * - bookshop - . 
  in english , the meaning changed to the actual definition , while in spanish it 's still a shop . 
  sweet soluble tea for the summer . 
  not really tea , but i do n't have an habit of drinking tea . 
  [ i know that feel bro ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/107/432/i_hug_that_feel.png ), 
  league of legends . 
  in fact , some people who use reddit in spain basically reads that subreddit . 
  edit : oh ok , it 's about non-computer games ... i 'd say the classic ones like tag or statues . 
  edit 2 : i remember the [ jinx ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jinx_\\ ( children % 27s_game \\ ) ), 
  #pene !!!, 
   popus actually they 're already used for those teenagers - usually from barcelona - who are `` popular '' in social networks . 
  as you may have guessed , they 're not exactly the future stephen hawking 's pupils ...  eypos have only seen it in forocoches and said by me , i like that word . 
   picha ( or pisha ) / chocho ( or shosho ) - andalusian too , they mean dick and pussy respectively , and you use it to greet someone you like welcome to c\u00e1diz xdd, 
  most of the 18th century was pretty quiet in domestic politics , until the french revolution . 
  some alliance with france , some battle in the colonies , but nothing else . 
  other boring eras could be the peaceful roman eras . 
  lebanon has a bit of the west in the muslim world . 
  we do n't really have that much news from jordan . 
  gasol brothers are definitely famous in spain . 
  heard more of them in the past . 
  machiatto or milk with sugar . 
  * tremendous !, 
  saaaaad !, 
  honestly , i do n't really know haha !, 
  there has n't been any consensus since [ elsa pataky ] ( http://cdn.vogue.es/uploads/images/thumbs/201303/inspirate_en_el_nuevo_look_de_las_celebrities_430259109_800x1200.jpg ) , but she also has a romanian grandfather . 
  then there was [ pilar rubio ] ( http://teleprograma.diezminutos.es/var/plan_site/storage/images/teleprograma/2009/julio/pilar_rubio_sustituye_a_patricia_conde_en_se_lo_que_hicisteis_y_rueda_tension_sexual_no_resuelta/pilar_rubio_piernas/1310477-1-esl-es/pilar_rubio_piernas_gallery_r.jpg ) , [ cristina pedroche ] ( http://www.zeleb.es/sites/default/files/styles/news_main_image/public/cristina_pedroche_en_el_ayer.jpg ) ... among others . 
  i deeply , truly wonder why trump is pixelated ... xddd, 
  not an historian , cmiw , but us had the resources from the start to develop new technology , back in the early times of the cold war , while europe had to rebuild everything due to wwii . 
  well , strictily it does n't necessarily mean wealthy in spain as well , just a higher-class background that can be traced several generations behind . 
  the same goes for xxx-yyy surnames , which are the combinations of two surnames of important families back then . 
  * uh-ohhh ... be sincere !, 
  * off-topic : why do you have that username ? 
  `` de '' usually denotes being from a wealthy family . 
  iirc it 's second in popularity ( as a regulated sport ) . 
  how anybody is able to find a bridge in a classifieds ? 
  btw , happy reddit birthday !, 
  i need time to think what i 'm going to say . 
  that 's why i 'm `` bad '' .
