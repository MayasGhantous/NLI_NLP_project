  but i think i 'm worse on listening . 
  and when people even does n't understand what i say in spanish ... as i said in another thread , let alone english . 
  first of all school , then music and then reddit and youtube from time to time . 
  curiously , since i use reddit my grammar has worsened . 
  then it 's not in all schools , at least yet - never heard of turning all public schools bilingual though . 
   my sister is two years younger and she has 4 hours of english plus 4 hours of history taught in english ( yeah , i 'm not particularly fond of that but whatever ) and a couple of other subjects , i think they were art and technology or sth like that , in english too . 
  is n't that just for some regions , some schools and/or some kids that could achieve a good english level , iirc ? 
  i mean , not every spanish student is doing this . 
  portuguese textile had a fairly good quality for its price , so our housewives would buy some when in portugal . 
  on the other hand , those same towels did n't dry - may it be the fine cotton ? 
  since the euro , prices have leveled to similar values . 
  from anywhere else , but not european for sure . 
  latin american , middle eastern or even indian . 
   do your history classes incorporate moral judgments ( cruel/appropriate/justified / unjustified/right/wrong , etc ) ? 
  usually they have to be as neutral as possible . 
  the things that `` balance '' to one side or another are the crimes against humanity commited by the nazis - holocaust and stuff - . 
   do your classes about the asian theater of ww2 mainly discuss the atomic bombs ? 
  they 're more briefly explained , so it can be just about pearl harbor and the bombs . 
  - neighbours - colonial power before it went mainstream - at the same time , one of the last to end its colonial empire - supported franco , but salazar was less opressive than franco ( should have tagged with greece as well and make the western dictatorships ' squad ) - estoril , algarve ... - toll roads - your caralho is our carajo - towels - pasteis de nata , molotof - oporto wines - our level of portuguese is directly proportional to our exposure to portuguese labelling in the stuff we buy - siuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu !!!!!!!!!!, 
  ! 1 - luxembourg and france is full of you - actually , when i write about you it rains karma in my profile , idk why . 
  also had the chance to meet some portuguese irl , so i do n't really mind the stereotypes . 
  to sum up , happy day portugal !, 
  * eats the codfish furiously and buys some towels by the way *, 
  not one in particular , but an story set up in the [ end of the cordoba 's caliphate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fitna_of_al-andalus ) or the [ taifas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taifa ) . 
  a few families pushing their interests and making alliances to fight each other . 
  until 2021 , you 're able to change the * pesetas * to euros . 
  from time to time i can see a coin , but it 's difficult since they 're usually saved somewhere at home . 
  had that dance in spain as well , but turned into some different dancing from those guys in the video . 
  have seen it in , literally , central european peoples - british isles , german-speaking areas , balkans , eastern europe - . 
  basically neither mediterraneans nor nordics/scandinavians . 
  my point was that most mediterraneans have hazel/brown/dark eyes . 
   dark curly hair bright blue/green eyes . 
  so mediterranean ? 
  more like central european to me . 
  not necessarily every time , but i prefer blondes . 
  in its majority , but i 'm obliged to point out they 're not the only ones . 
  disclaimer : i did n't vote nor support pp, 
  65 % 12:49 africa , oceania and the caribbean were horrible , not to mention the zero precision with my hand clicking before time edit : 58 % 3:04 for us , * so bad !, 
  * wait , is a truck/lorry going by my street ? 
  * later that evening : oh did you feel the earthquake ? 
  edit : rephrasing, 
  i 'm rick harrison , and this is my pawn shop . 
  i work here with my old man and my son , big hoss . 
  everything in here has a story and a price . 
  one thing i 've learned after 21 years - you never know what is gon na come through that door . 
  they have to pass any of this exams : - pau ( stands for test for access to university , also known as * selectividad * ) : it evaluates the contents of high school 's last year , which you have to pass first . 
  you can choose from mandatory subjects up to every one of the subjects you have studied to make a scale where you can take advantage and get better marks . 
  marks are 0-14 , you pass with 5 , but to be eligible to university they have a minimum overall mark which can be influenced by the subjects you had chosen in the pau . 
  - there 's another similar exam for people who is older than 25 , but high school 's last year is n't required . 
  - if you have done higher vocational training , you can use your mark from vocational training to compete , but since it 's from 0-10 , you can do subjects from pau to level it up . 
  edit for spaniards : pau was set up that way in 2010 . 
  i first got confused because i did n't know that nicknames are epithets . 
  - madrid : `` villa y corte '' - ( small ) town and court - - valladolid : `` pucela '' - san sebasti\u00e1n / donostia : `` la bella easo '' - the belle easo , from a nearby roman city - - c\u00e1diz : `` tacita de plata '' - silver cup - - valencia : `` capital del turia '' - capital city of the turia river -, 
  disclaimer : perceived stereotypes can differ from person to person - flamenco ( it 's just from a region - andalusia - , it 's not that popular anymore ) - toros - * bullfighting * - ( the backlash is * yuuuge * ) - siesta ( most people work after lunch ) - fiesta ( you know , we have to support the economy in some way ... ) - paella ( it 's from valencia ) lately : - public debt ( true ) - high unemployment ( true ) - binge drinking ( just search for * magaluf * and * botell\u00f3n * ) - bad english skills ( not that bad , but partly true ) - spain = barcelona, 
  in addition : - * \u00a1 dios de mi alma !, 
  * - literally , god of my soul - - * \u00a1 ( pero ) por dios !, 
  * - geez ! -, 
  almost every day , usually patrolling . 
  because there would be 27 of them . 
  yes , about 0,10 $ . 
  [ miriadax ] ( https://miriadax.net ) have moocs in spanish . 
  [ clases de apoyo ] ( https://www.clasesdeapoyo.com ) back in the day when they were free :(, 
  barna is ok ? 
  not because of terrorism but the usual historical reasons - economical , to find a job - . 
  i 'm not allowed too much for medical reasons , but i tolerate trying or something like in appetizers or snacks . 
  i 'm surprised that you hold us as a good country and some of you guys feel welcome here . 
  it 's good to hear it !, 
  yes and no . 
  i was given some gb for free but on the other hand i ca n't use them in some parts of the subway . 
  and it 's a bit expensive . 
  i have seen a couple irl - not in school anymore - , and there was a trend on youtube to use them . 
  so it must have some buyers then . 
  * the asian lost bros :( * nah , actually we do n't see a lot of them so they would be treated as any other expat or tourist . 
  like other southeastern asians at most . 
  - ma\u00f1ana ( 05-12 , sometimes 03-12 ) * morning * - mediod\u00eda ( 12-15 ) * noon * - tarde ( 15-21 ) * afternoon/evening * - noche ( 21-03 ) * night * - madrugada ( 00-06 ) * early morning *, 
  nah i 'll choose whatever . 
  within limits , but i do n't think it 's fair . 
  if they 're same-gender twins , the names of my mother and hers ( if they 're girls ) or my father and hers ( if they 're boys ) . 
  ivo from ivaylo ? 
  bulgarian background ? 
  a little aggresive , but not , not anymore . 
  the same , but santa rosa instead of fremont ( is there any [ difference ] ( https://nyti.ms/2sopb1q ) really ? ), 
  - sobresaliente ( sb ) 9-10 - * outstanding * - - notable ( nt ) 7-8 - * mention * - - bien ( b ) 6 - * good * - - suficiente ( sf ) 5 - * sufficent * - - insuficiente ( in ) < 5 ( nunca se puede poner un 0 en el bolet\u00edn de notas ) - * not enough * - then there 's the * matr\u00edcula de honor * - honors - , which is given to the students with exceptional results - it 's ranked higher than 10 but it 's not a numeric mark - . 
  the most common thing is calling a square or an avenue `` de espa\u00f1a '' - of spain , spain 's ... - in any town . 
  you can also find neighbourhoods called `` espa\u00f1a '' as well . 
  did a little research and found a [ river and a beach ] ( https://www.google.es/maps/place/playa+espa\u00f1a/@43.5377205,-5.5384549,15z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1srio+espa\u00f1a+asturias!3m4!1s0xd3670f9bbef79cd:0x4251487374576aaa!8m2!3d43.5446949!4d-5.5294141 ) called `` espa\u00f1a '' , but the wikipedia says it 's the noun form of a synonym of * explode * . 
  among the shortest of the thread : 1,64 m ( 5 ' 4 '' ) , so under average . 
  the `` fiesta and siesta '' kind of stereotypes . 
  yeah we can live pretty well but ... why would we be trusted or admired in more serious stuff then ? 
  probably how the peninsular war ( napoleonic wars in spain ) and the spanish civil war started , which shaped the modern spain . 
  alright i had to read the thread again , and yeah you just use any other name to hide or invent someone 's identity . 
  [ social liberalism ] ( https://8values.github.io/results.html?e=61.6&amp;d=54.3&amp;g=63.1&amp;s=72.1 ), 
   i do n't think we have a proper name for someone without one , like `` john doe '' fulanito de tal, 
  realised that there are several versions of that lyrics . 
  i 'm on mobile now but you can find some . 
  googled its pronounciation and it 's closer to our demonym * espa\u00f1ol * . 
  but yeah , i 'm used to spaniard . 
  been called that but i do n't consider it myself , but i think i qualify to answer . 
  i have yet to meet somebody who i can talk about politics and reach some common conclusion . 
  the problem is that people who are into politics do follow an ideology , so you ca n't convince them of anything anyway .
