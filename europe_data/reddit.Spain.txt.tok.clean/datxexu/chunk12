  due to the lack of * \u00f1 * - * espa\u00f1a * - in some languages , i do n't mind being called * spain * . 
  but the demonym * spaniard * sounds a bit strange to me . 
  alright thanks , i supposed it but was n't sure . 
  what is a ca ? 
  ok , it 's not a trashy city - not even a city - , but i was answering to this :  murcia is usually mocked as being the * most irrelevant part * of spain, 
   murcia is usually mocked as being the most irrelevant part of spain i have to argue this one . 
  nobody knows what a menorca is . 
  there is n't any news from there , almost literally . 
  on the other hand , we ca n't mock a place we do n't know yet . 
  in spain there 's a bit of concern about the monarchy , the former king was named the head of state by franco . 
  although he could gain some popularity , corruption made him less respected among the population . 
  and now , with the actual one , the royal family became divided because of more corruption . 
  and the former king is still king because he would be accused of corruption if he stopped being a king . 
  in my opinion , most people do n't care because it 's not something we feel responsible for . 
  german-speaking countries probably have the most famous systems . 
  in spain , vocational education covers trades , middle-range technical and stem jobs , lower-level business management , middle-level design and some plastic arts . 
  university degrees are more popular , but i think some degrees do n't have its place there . 
  on the other side , the first stage of vocational education is for people who did n't study the mandatory high school education , and it 's looked down by many people . 
  heard that a new housing bubble in the moon has skyrocketed !, 
  i 'd like to know how much of the economy does mexico , mexican companies or the mexicans themselves share there . 
  do they make more profit than the rest ? 
  how much money goes to mexico ? 
  i mean , the us is likely to take more advantage of it than latin america - unless proven wrong , but that 's my feeling , as inmigration is usually regarded as an overall benefit to the host country and an economic loss to their country of origin . 
  again , i 'm stressing in the lack of data but this is another topic to debate . 
  ahm interesting , i may have been mistaken because i could n't see the parents anywhere . 
  glad i 'm spanish this time !, 
  - i have stage fright . 
  i mean , it reminds me of proms . 
  western sahara would have given us more problems than profit , even without morroco . 
  but i 'd say that la habana could have been a better capital for spanish-speaking media than miami or los angeles , but in exchange of a huge secessionist movement if things were n't managed properly . 
  the latter . 
  the only exceptions would be national museums , for example . 
  this thread blew my mind with all those bill wurtz jingles in my head !, 
  like in the other thread ... a dinner in some restaurant and book a disco for the occasion , usually shared with other schools . 
  ( madrid , spain ) edit : the school does n't organise anything , but the students and sometimes the teachers . 
  it 's ... too american xd i 'm terrible at dancing but they seem to have fun . 
  have a dinner and some party in a disco . 
  we do the same but a year or a couple before . 
  * facha * for fascist , and in extension , the right . 
  also * franquista * - francoist . 
  * neoliberal * for capitalism supporters . 
  and * rojo * for communist , and in extension , the left . 
  also * progre * from * progresista * - progressive - . 
  regarding parties , you have * sociata * - socialist in the sense of supporting psoe , social-democrats - , * podemita * - podemos supporter , left - , * cu\u00f1ado * - brother-in-law - for everybody but especially used by the twitter left to accuse right-wingers . 
  regarding secession movements , you have several slurs such as * catalufo * for catalanists , * espa\u00f1olista * for unionists . 
  regarding social movements , * machista * - person who advocates for male superiority , usually exchanged for sexist - , * feminazi * , * loca del co\u00f1o * - `` crazy pussy '' , extreme feminist - .

  if not , you 'll end up in deadbedrooms !, 
   have you ever though that the culture of madrid does n't exist ? 
  even the chotis dance has a bohemian background !, 
  i do agree with the rest as well , but i think there is a madrid 's culture , that madrile\u00f1os do understand what it is - the typical places , the metro ... - , but not folklore or tradition to show , like other regions - we 're just castillians , with all the consequences it carries with . 
  things like zarzuela are no longer related to today 's madrid . 
  source : born , raised and living in madrid - although i 'm younger . 
  the problem of madrid 's culture is that it 's widespread throughout spain by the media . 
  nowadays it 's like a inner hipster made-up place .

  - religion : nope - food : nope - fashion : nope - gestures : often , but not always, 
  `` american '' names are also infamous here in spain ( kevin , richard , jessica , jennifer ... ) as they 're associated with chavs , inmigration and gypsies . 
  for example , idk , `` fidget spinner cut by a 1000\u00bac knife '',

  nope, 
  - andalusians : funny - madrile\u00f1os : cocky - galicians : slow - not coast neither madrid : brutish - basques : the most brutish of the world , * with three thousand couples of bollocks patxi !, 
  actually not . 
  they 're too overloaded . 
  they were common in the past , to avoid the sun and a sign of respect to god in the church , usually while in mass. 
  some old women in northern spain still wear them . 
  less common ones : - la guita - pelas - lereles,

  i do n't think it 's difficult to write english in an spanish keyboard ( qwerty with \u00d1 ) , the difficult thing is programming in it . 
  even some keyboard shortcuts in my editor do n't work because i have to press down an extra key and the editor wo n't allow it . 
  with the fries , steaks , grilled fish , burgers , sandwiches ... not in pasta , that 's a federal crime down here !,

  off-topic question : is it worth it to use apps - paid or not - for learning languages ? 
  what level can you achieve with them ? 
  why portugal whyyyyy ? 
  * sobs *, 
  thank you , i was too lazy to write it down !, 
  in spain there were several kingdoms and then those eventually united . 
  castile 's territory first became an autonomus county by the count [ fern\u00e1n gonz\u00e1lez ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fern\u00e1n_gonz\u00e1lez_of_castile ) .

  carnival counts ? 
  xd there are obscure traditions in remote places throughout spain that it 's said to have a pre-roman background . 
  edit : i do n't know names . 
  on the other hand , the church has been setting the rituals for centuries . 
  frigo ( ice cream ) and tulip\u00e1n ( margarine ) are now owned by unilever . 
  i find it odd that orban 's party belongs to the epp in the european parliament . 
  get your own conclusions . 
  tbh , you ca n't make friends with another patriotic person of a country with the opposite aims of your nationalism/patriotism . 
  regarding the question ... 
  i would n't say so .
