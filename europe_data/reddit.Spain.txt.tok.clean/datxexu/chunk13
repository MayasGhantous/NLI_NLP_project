  it had a few badlands , a couple bushes , but nothing impressive , it 's really boring . 
  and in spanish as well xd, 
  so you take the opposite approach ... interesting . 
  yes you are . 
  i wonder if in northern europe they have more holidays in winter . 
   you go into the booth and you 'll find several ballots it 's disappointing how the booths usually do n't have papers inside and you have to take them outside in front of everyone . 
  it 's an attack on privacy and secret vote .

  there are small ones every few years ( around 4 in richter scale ) , but nothing serious . 
  the furniture shaked for a while and everyone posted it on twitter .

  rather than changing my opinion , i discovered what nationals of a country consider their identity , and well , at the same time we can really compare from their own experience how are things anywhere in europe .

  i 'd really like to travel around europe and meet other cultures some day , as i see that most of you guys do . 
  what is dirty dancing ( for you , or in general ) ? 
  i can contemplate a rivalry between greece and turkey for the oil like saudi arabia and iran xdd, 
  never came across any other muslim-majority nationality , apart from morrocans and pakistanis . 
  it can be the case for other nationalities , but they 're harder to find . 
  - chinese people usually run either restaurants or convenience shops . 
  - morrocans and south asians do run convenience shops or kebabs as well depending on the place . 
  - morrocans are hairdressers as well . 
  not that popular , but it 's growing .

  northern spain , madrid ( former inmigration ) , \u00c1vila and some places in andalusia ( former inmigration ) have some more than the rest . 
  in spain , if by chance you were n't allowed to convalidate your school leaving certificate , you can do a [ `` prueba de madurez '' ] ( http://www.emes.es/ensenanzasartisticas/acceso/tabid/676/default.aspx ) - maturity test ? - instead of the university access tests which cover year 12 . 
  this test , along with another specific test for your degree allows to to enter in a special type of degrees called `` ense\u00f1anzas art\u00edsticas superiores '' , which are equivalent to universitary degrees . 
  the test is organised by the autonomous community , so it will depend on which city you want to study in . 
  in madrid you have the [ escuela superior de dise\u00f1o ] ( http://esdmadrid.es/sobre-la-escuela/ ) , a public institution , and another couple of private design schools that offer degrees . 
  edit : typos, 
  those who support franco want the 60s era - consumer society , integration with the us bloc , importing a bit of their culture , catholic church influence in personal areas of life , no commies or reds - , not the post-war era - apart from the hardcore fascists - . 
  i 'd say we 're more comparable to latin american right-wing dictatorships than fascist european ones . 
  edit : ok at least explain what 's wrong with me . 
  i have made 2 statements .

  what a coincidence then ... it could have happened anything . 
  if this can put your mind at rest we 're not the best at communication skills .

  edit : genuine question , what happened ? 
  here in spain you can even find as a souvenir the coat of arms of your surname . 
  this does n't mean we 're all part of the nobility - quite the opposite - . 
  it 's just as a curiosity , and it is n't related with social prestige . 
  d'you mean this ?
