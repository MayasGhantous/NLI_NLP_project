  ( from wikipedia )  ... the term is used for politicians who strongly support their party 's policies and are reluctant to compromise with their political opponents . 
  then i 'd say yes , but without foreign influence . 
  parties wo n't collaborate with each other just for being that other hated party . 
  i like how the chancla turns one side to slap the other kid xdd, 
  inside r/europe , i 'd say the first for obvious reasons - brexit - , but irl i 'd say northerner and a southerner , because there 's enough cultural distance to have behavioral and attitude misunderstoods . 
  we can oversimpify and say there are different world views and lifestyles . 
  in addition , i ca n't guess what could make the other pairings not getting along ... 
  tbh , european sports cars are seen more luxurious by their design . 
  although some american 's are sold by here and have a tiny niche . 
  [ the secret of spanish education ] ( http://fititu.es/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/alpargata.jpg ) jokes apart , it 's said that education and manners are more permissive by here , but i ca n't compare . 
   or spaniards and the alhambra ? 
  even if it was n't built by spaniards . 
  yes i am . 
  they 're the legacy of the prosperity of the people who built it . 
  on the other hand you 're referring to landmarks , so it 's normal - the same way you would love nyc skyscrapers or national parks - . 
  we do n't care about , for example , my grand-grandfather 's carriage or a bottle of medicine from the 1910s . 
  iirc every region of spain has its own team . 
  it 's just that they 're not in the uefa or fifa . 
  [ are you my past me ? 
  xd ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/55trqt/europeans_what_idioms_referring_to_other/ ), 
  * la patria * - the fatherland , femenine word - , but latin americans use * la madre patria * - literally the motherland - as an epithet for spain . 
  edit : typo, 
  alexander the great and muslims reached there , portugal conquered a couple of cities and uk took india as another colony . 
  and gandhi as a leader of the indian independence movement . 
  in madrid , it 's huge , but it could be better , especially the suburbs ' bus network . 
  anyway the system is justified by a high population density . 
   is your city/country more public transport-friendly or car-friendly ? 
  surbubs are usually more [ car-friendly ] ( https://www.google.es/maps/place/madrid/@40.4378698,-3.8196207,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd422997800a3c81:0xc436dec1618c2269!8m2!3d40.4167754!4d-3.7037902 ) - check out the high density of motorways - and central madrid more public transport-friendly - historical district has some streets closed to cars , lots of [ metro ] ( https://www.google.es/maps/place/madrid/@40.423523,-3.7265054,12.75z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0xd422997800a3c81:0xc436dec1618c2269!8m2!3d40.4167754!4d-3.7037902!5m1!1e2 ) stations - . 
  nope . 
  actually , the brits who i ran into did raise the topic themselves . 
  i 'd say any , but i would prefer ancient times , especially tribes and civilizations just before rome - phoencians , cartago , ancient greece , celts , other european indigenous peoples - and rome itself . 
  like anywhere else , guys pursue girls and girls get defensive . 
  women , but it 's not like it 's their fault . 
  that sounds really bad at first xd, 
  in high school , official curricula reaches b1 level in the year before uni . 
  this does n't say anything about how much english students know anyway . 
  those who know english fluently have been in private academies . 
  no - even despite the fact that nazi germany supported and sent troops and gear to franco - . 
  merkel - her politics - is object of criticism when discussing the foreign influences in spanish economical politics , but there is n't any resentment towards german people , and she 's still considered as a good europe 's leader and resisting other foreign interests , such as american . 
  it does exist , but it 's a niche . 
  some are more fun or informal ( like the vikings ' sieges in some towns of galicia ) , some are huge and organised towards the reenaction ( la albuera battle , peninsular war - napoleonic - ), 
  if it 's not that , then i 'm lost xd edit : i mean , i take for granted those who you meet irl . 
  i mean meeting people through social networks . 
   not socializing really depending on the topic they can even meet up irl as well . 
  but twitter had much better days . 
  i had to find out that easter is the resurrection sunday . 
  rather than just celebrating easter ( * pascua * ) , we have the holy week ( * semana santa * ) . 
  thursday ( * jueves santo * ) and good friday ( * viernes santo * ) are national holidays , along with saturday and sunday ( easter ) as well . 
  in that week , we carry images of christ or mary , like in a parade ( * procesiones * , holy week procession ) - usually scenes of the passion of christ or advocations of christ or mary - thorugh the streets - usually the cathedral or biggest church in the area - . 
  those are held by brotherhoods and fraternities linked to the image . 
  we eat * torrijas * - sort of french toast - , and in good friday there was the tradition of eating `` vigil stew '' . 
  i think he 's referring to another thing . 
  it 's not an internship , but [ community service ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/community_service ) , as a public service . 
  russian and arabic . 
  french as well as i 'm a bit more used to it . 
  nope . 
  you can give them a tweet instead and make the news !!!, 
  -- now seriously , the closest to contact them is sending an email . 
   i bet cadiz would do better without dealing with all this shit this is an underrated factor . 
  the unemployment in the province is outrageously high . 
  but i do n't think gibraltar is guilty , but how cadiz 's economy was developed - too many temporary contracts ... if there was any - . 
  til !, 
  lately - specially in last year in hs , that has spanish history as a subject - we focus a lot more in the 19th and 20th century . 
  the `` time speed '' gets slower and slower as we go through . 
  this is due to having half of the pau exam ( selectividad ) exercises focused in the 2 last centuries . 
  edit : agreed on the rest , but some autonomous communities split history in 2 years . 
  chinese phone , taiwanese computer , korean tv , japanese headphones , probably scandinavian wood for the furniture - not ikea - , spanish loudspeakers, 
  there was a docureality of a gypsy wedding on tv , closest thing i 've seen to your question, 
   i really hope that i did n't i 'd like to ask a dacher ( ? 
  ) , a czech or an hungarian if they can relate to you croats . 
  please bear in mind that i do n't want to `` croatsplaining '' , but i have n't seen that connection yet - maybe because of ignorance , i can admit it - . 
  i was going to write an anthropological and sociopolitical wall of text , but i think i can summarise it in that most people take an historical approach , as east/west europe is related with the cold war geopolitical situation . 
  central europe was a thing before ( 19th century central europe powers in mind , austria-hungary for instance ) . 
  you might have to show more historical , economical and political connections among what you want to call central europe - regardless of what countries belong to - . 
  in your particular case , i see you as balkan - in the same regional denomination level of v4 , for example . 
   some of the ones on the other side but , for example not egypt . 
  the magreb, 
  you did n't get my point . 
  just out of curiosity , do you guys consider yourselves mediterranean ? 
  germany , austria , czech republic actually the whole concept of central europe is pretty tricky ... 50 years of iron curtain do have an influence . 
  anarchism succeeded here , what do you expect xd, 
  maybe the whole thing of gibraltar , for some far-righters, 
  tbh , they could have sold it better !, 
   like this cheesesteak with fried onions ? 
  i ca n't tell apart the fried onion from the cheesesteak xd you 're welcome !, 
  iirc [ mike 's burger ] ( https://www.google.es/maps/place/mike's+burger+house/@43.5362119,-5.6505297,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd367c806479478b:0x19d45758c59d4bf7!8m2!3d43.536208!4d-5.648341 ), 
  - almost anything with onion , either be fried onion or caramelized onion - two burgers : a fried egg burger in a famous local restaurant chain and another normal burger in a well-known place in gij\u00f3n ( asturias ) . 
  it 's ... too much european for my taste xd, 
  unfortunately , because everyone does ... specially when you 're getting older . 
  [ i hate when they call it a lisp !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phonological_history_of_spanish_coronal_fricatives#castilian_.27lisp.27 ), 
  nor any spaniard . 
  both are countries where we did n't do well in the 19th century , some nowadays ' problems have their roots in that epoch . 
  and there 's also that legend which says that the irish come from iberian peoples . 
  maybe russia ? 
  idk, 
  [ it 's a little more complicated ... ] ( http://www.mundojuridico.info/emancipacion/ ),
