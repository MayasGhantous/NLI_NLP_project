  heard of it ( wicca , canarian aborigins , basque , celtic ) but i have n't met a single one who practices these kind of religions . 
  here , you 're either a catholic , an agnostic , an atheist , a muslim or a protestant . 
  other religions are something outstandingly rare or unknown . 
   also , there is a limit of dogs you can walk at the same time . 
  where ? 
  [ and ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james_costos ) our [ former !, 
  ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2017/02/15/inenglish/1487158607_333132.html ), 
  for military people : [ clims ] ( http://www.clims.eu/ ) ( not updated , better check your army 's website ) you can use host country 's army residencies , leisure places and tours for cheaper , for several countries in europe - not full eu - . 
  save a little more and you can buy phones with 13 mpx camera from 150 $ . 
  also , there 's the guard change the first wednesday of every month , promoted as a tourist attraction . 
  til !, 
  who are you talking about exactly ? 
  most official buildings have it , and eu-funded projects as well . 
  but nothing like showing the flag in the balcony for example . 
   taste of america 9 $ for a cereal box ... omg, 
  [ little chickpea ] ( https://es.slideshare.net/rianadaia/little-chickpea-30483098 ) ( patufet in catalan , garbancito in spanish ) , a traditional catalan tale . 
  found an italian version , but it 's a different story , more like tom thumb . 
  netflix account lent . 
  cable tv is common - especially among families , but i do n't have it . 
  disappointed that holy week is n't mentioned, 
  although i 'd like to know about all of europe 's cultures - which is why i 'm here - , the [ baltics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_states ) ' culture do catch my attention . 
  those countries placed together with one neighbour in common ... it must be interesting to know more about them . 
  by the same rule of thumb any party would n't be what they say they are . 
  do you prefer mainstream conservatives ? 
  from what i 've heard , latin americans used to vote pp - centre-right - , and muslims and eastern europeans psoe - social democrats - . 
  recently , the votes had diversified among all mainstream parties . 
  no and no . 
  no , but i do n't think there 's a huge interest because there 's a business legislation - although you have / r/eulaw - and enviroment for every country . 
  you 'd better hire someone to give you advice if you want to launch for the whole eu . 
  in the campo del moro ? 
  denmark is ok for me . 
  southeners for some region , nordic anyway ... lego supplies are vital as well, 
  the canary islands . 
  username checks out, 
  i write british english but i speak the way it 's more comfortable for me or my pronounciation , although it 's mostly based in british as well . 
  there 's the american one and the spanish one edit : found the / s, 
  role of the temple + type of temple + * de san/santa * ( of saint ) ( or * nuestra se\u00f1ora de * ( our lady ) , * cristo de * ( christ of ) ) + name ( + title/place ) - catedral de santa mar\u00eda de la sede ( seville 's cathedral ) - cathedral of saint mary of the see - real ermita de san antonio de la florida ( a chapel in madrid ) - royal chapel of st. anthony of la florida edit : they 're the official names . 
  if the temple is famous , we call it by its type , like * la catedral * , * la almudena * , * la parroquia * - the parish - , or just * la iglesia * - the church - . 
  do n't you think that some teenager wo n't try it . 
  by here we had recently `` el muelle '' - the spring challenge - . 
  too nsfw to describe by here . 
   legal semiautomatic pistols are very rare , only some civilians like jewelers or those who have been seriously dead threatened can have it . 
  did n't know that ... 
  i heard that women 's american soccer is huge there . 
  nobody told i would live in us or i 'm being forced to vote . 
  i 'd say the stereotype refers to the [ cap ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_agricultural_policy ) . 
  here the farmers are organised in ~ ~ trade unions ~ ~ organizations , to counteract their buyers - supermarket chains , for example - . 
  there is n't too much influence in politics , maybe when spanish fishermen are expelled from some foreign waters there are some negotiations among the countries , but nothing big . 
  * el chuache * for his friends, 
  in fact you can go to navacerrada by suburban train . 
  as madrid is the biggest city in spain , it 's almost taken from granted that it has every name of countries , cities and famous people from europe . 
  in las musas there are some streets named after european cities , in the universidad aut\u00f3noma after famous scientists and philosophers ... 
  the little square next to col\u00f3n square is even dedicated to margaret thatcher : /, 
  i 'd also add the * conquistadores * in general . 
  either genocidal or brilliant military strategists . 
  we do n't have patriotism , we fake our national self-steem with football and food . 
  tbh the portugal 's patrotism i met is the #portugalcaralho circlejerk in reddit, 
  or they go straight into the question . 
  [ atb !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a9oiiapsko ) edit : yes , not minimal xd, 
  systems engineering is the closest thing i can think of . 
  usually that stuff needs a multidisciplinary team in the stem area . 
  edit : aeronautics as well, 
  - morroco : its politics - portugal : its patriotism - france : being better than us - gibraltar : tax haven - andorra : tax haven, 
  why nobody said google yet ? 
  a zte blade a610 . 
  anyway i think there are better phones in its category , such as the huawei p8 lite 2017 or the sony xperia xa . 
  i 'd say anyone is able to teach better his/her mother tongue anyway . 
   like to stare never heard of this one , can you explain ? 
  bought a middle-range new phone . 
  ~ ~ despite i could n't restore the whatsapp chats ~ ~ , i 'm happy i can do stuff again with my new phone . 
  edit : achieved, 
  [ * goodbye to the people who hated on me ... * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unrldldllz8 ), 
  but first you need the death star, 
  5th option , darth vader, 
   as long as you do n't get `` involved in politics '' , did n't franco say something similar ? 
  wikipedia agrees with you , but i have always heard * fabes *, 
  another good example would be * frijoles * can be * alubias * , * jud\u00edas * , * habichuelas * , * fabes * ( beans ), 
  the obvious case is gibraltar . 
  i have seen some miami 's cuban refugee wanting [ cuba to be spain again ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cuba_espa%c3%b1ola ), 
  must be good at maths at least xd, 
  there is a lot of stuff about the topic . 
  you can summarize it in outright humillation , as we lost the last colonies we had in america , and the philippines . 
  i think you guys are only thinking in the economic part . 
  but on the social side , collectivism can be a bad thing as well . 
  social justice is n't taken for granted , but the people 's general opinion . 
   pre-rome i 'd say just after the islamic invasion ... and by the `` christian '' side - as spain as a state comes from the former christian kingdoms - . 
  not too much wewuzzery about being andalusis , romans or celtiberians , out from history books . 
   i know in other regions this does n't happen which ones ? 
  in my case , that our ex-pm aznar won the elections in 1996 . 
   those are staple 90s classics here in the ~ ~ uk ~ ~ planet earth and further ftfy, 
  they 're not `` idioms '' themselves , but they 're pretty common : - * ... p\u00e9gate un tiro !, 
  * ( ... shoot yourself ! ), 
  * ( ... throw yourself from the window ! ), 
  * ( kill yourself ! ), 
  whatsapp , telegram , reddit , citymapper, 
  every romanian roma i came across was dark . 
  i ca n't tell you have n't seen exceptions , but i doubt it 's normal . 
   roma from eastern countries are blonder did you mean the non-roma ? 
  actually roma are pretty dark,
