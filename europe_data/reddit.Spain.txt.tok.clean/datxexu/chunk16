  actually , i did the 2 * ciclos * - finishing daw - . 
  they 're radically different in 2nd course . 
  if you want to , pm me about the schools , so i can give advice to my classmates as they want to do dam as well . 
  which * ciclo * ? 
   i 've been working as a vr developer for 3 years now . 
  impressive, 
  [ he even starred for a wow ad !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkailt_lk1s ), 
  did you study anything there or it was just the internship ? 
  in my case i could study software development , which could be used for most programmer positions here . 
  in spain , i think lower vocational education is n't regarded well as most students are n't the most bright ones . 
  it seems that r/magdalenianmasterrace is leaking , but you did n't ask for a single era , so i think i 'm able to tell you that there are lots of archeological sites here , specially in the mediteranean coast . 
  - lots of dolmens and menhirs , especially in western spain ( portugal also have a few ) - colonies in the mediterranean coast , like * qart hadasht * - roman * cartago nova * , cartagena - , phonecian * gadir * - roman * gades * , c\u00e1diz - , greek * emporion * - ampurias/emp \u00faries - . 
  - lots of roman cities like tarraco , emerita augusta , corduba ... - muslim stuff from time to time, 
  everyone knows you 're portuguese :p, 
  tbh holland sounds more glamourous ^ tm, 
  [ this xd ] ( http://i56.tinypic.com/vo7m7n.jpg ) i think the closest thing to the chuck norris facts are the '' [ el hombre de negro ] ( https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qp8tx8sdoa8/t3ghevzu-ji/aaaaaaaafl4/mpfc0mkqbe8/s1600/hombre_negro.jpg ) '' - the man in black - facts . 
  this guy was in the spanish tv show `` el hormiguero '' - the anthill - . 
  basically his facts are more or less the same as chuck 's , but a bit sillier . 
   * the man in black uses the keys in touchscreen phooones !, 
  *   * the man in black did n't enlarge his penis , he cut his leeeegs !, 
  *   * the man in black can make a triangle ... with 2 siiiides !, 
  i was thinking of your bff ... !, 
  portugal definitely will like it, 
  i was going to say the former king 's christmas speech  i fill myself ? 
  with pride and satisfaction , in such remarked dates ... 
  most of those who work here do live in portugal , especially near the border or in western andalusia . 
  i have come across 3 portuguese families where i live . 
  / r/adayinthelife !, 
   wait , does it count if the governament party , a red wing one , uses is to acuse the biggest left wing part in spanish parliment of being like it ? 
  sauce ? 
  i am able to understand some read french by guessing the words . 
  madrid . 
  i 'd say so, 
   18y and everyone is ignoring it . 
  spain in a nutshell as well, 
  i did n't care too much about languages - in fact , i joined french in school before but gave it up - until 14 or 15 , when i started a more advanced english in a private language school . 
  that 's when i discovered languages in general , english in particular , as an interesting topic . 
  water or sometimes coke or sprite . 
  [ again ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5w9oa3/does_your_country_have_any_obscure_strange_laws/de8vtjp/ ) the civil servant in charge was an old woman . 
  maybe the civil servant was, 
  actually it 's the case of a friend . 
  as i told / u/cruelus _ rex , yeah it may not be legal but it 's a thing . 
  actually there are legal limitations to the names - like the offensive ones , etcetera - , but the civil servants in the civil registration are the main authorities on behalf of the government . 
  you can sue them for not allowing to use the name you have chosen for your child . 
  but is it worth the effort here ? 
  the 1st one is enforced in most of spain as a privacy protection measure . 
  the 3rd , from what i have heard , is up to the civil servant to accept the name you want for your child . 
  if you come across a religious civil servant he/she can force you to name your child after that day 's saint - edit : prolly not legal . 
  2nd edit : not f * cking legal, 
  they just say it , i do n't really know why, 
  [ 40 principales ( top 40 ) ] ( http://los40.com/lista40/?o=vl40 ), 
   ~ ~ brazilian ~ ~ mexican ftfy , 
   from spain ( particularly spanish students for some reason ) usually , language schools offer trips or holidays in the uk and ireland . 
  ireland is regarded as the `` most pure english spoken '' as well . 
  every school celebrates carnival by some way . 
  some cities and towns in spain hold big celebrations and parades of carnival . 
  basically any teen pop singer or band [ game : reply me with this song 's lyrics ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x-e5kjeawg ) . 
  remember to save your sanity while in game , you know . 
  ~ ~ do n't worry , german hands-up music is worse i 'd say ~ ~ edit : listened again, 
  to be honest i do n't * especially * identify with a specific region . 
  it 's complicated to explain - it 's more personal - . 
  rather than the region , the central district ( madrid ) . 
  western europeans mainly - no further than the arch made by uk , germany and italy , although you can see asian tourists as well - . 
  kindergarten . 
   did anyone formally study a scandinavian language in either primary or secondary school ? 
  nope, 
  having english lessons in an ~ ~ academy ~ ~ language school and reddit . 
  last summer, 
  in windows it 's like that , in linux is n't . 
  anyway i 'm used to the spanish keyboard . 
  i live in a place where ecuatorians and dominicans are majority , or at least , a very significant minority , so i ca n't make a general image of them as i know very different people despite being from the same country . 
  the same goes for other big national groups . 
  i do n't see they consider themselves `` latinos '' , unless they have to socialise with other latinos - not even spaniards , maybe for other inmigrants - . 
  i see them as a bit more conservative , despite their politics are similar to europe 's - in contrast with us - . 
  i think the only cubans i ever came across with were doctors or nurses . 
  in the media , i divide between those who emigrated and those who did n't . 
  i know that in the past , la havana was very bourgeois but there was inequality in cuba . 
  for obvious reasons , cuba is considered as well the most spanish of the former colonies in america . 
  i also like the * son cubano * - musical genre - . 
  revilla is like the kim kardashian of spanish politics , he 's just there for thee sake of being there, 
  the physical part was covered in biology , along with a brief about contraceptives . 
  then by 15 we had a closer to `` sexology '' class - only like 2 or 3 days - , which we were basically told that porn is sexist , to not feel pushed to have sex , and that sexuality was linked to ourselves . 
   was anything done to encourage the discussion between opposite genders of students about related topics ? 
  not really . 
  imho , sex ed should be taught more at different ages , not just as a seminar . 
  the evolution of the kids are different , and some people will need to be told some stuff sooner or later than others . 
  maybe some guys and girls have a girlfriend/boyfriend at 14 and others at 18 and they do n't wonder about some things until they date someone else . 
  rather than adapting the syntax to my native language , i 'd remove some special characters - such as @ , | , < ,  , \\ - from programming languages . 
  the reason is that english keyboards are way more suitable for programming with special characters than others . 
  international keyboards include alt gr , which is usually only by the right side , which can make you lose track of writing when you want to use an alt gr character on the left . 
  the same goes for  , : , ? , when you have to use shift . 
  tl ; dr : i hate 2 keys at a time for a character . 
  thank god for autocompletion, 
  searching in wikipedia it seems it 's [ his daughter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fininvest ) who now runs the main group . 
  spanish tv watcher , can confirm, 
  officially it 's * et * , but i usually call it by its english name * ampersand * . 
  really ?
