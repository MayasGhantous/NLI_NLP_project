  i have seen fb messenger growing as well , but not using it . 
  acs are common , both at homes and institutions . 
  if you want an architectural tradition which does a lot for avoiding heat inside home is the typical white houses , and unpurposely , narrow streets . 
  [ yes we did ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_division ), 
  ah thanks !, 
  regarding to the question , i have n't seen here any criticism against poc movements , but for anti-inmigration policies . 
  on behalf of spain , you do n't want to do it . 
  for sure . 
  what is * yts * ? 
  the closest i could get was from a military memorabilia shop which sold nazi flags - along with many others as well , to be fair - . 
  disclaimer : hours are indicative timetables vary from school to school . 
  it can be either a continuous working day ( from 8 to 14 ) or a split working day ( from 9 to 16 or 9-10 to 17 , with lunch break around 13 ) . 
  in both schedules you have a 25-30 min from 11 pm . 
  usually the classes last 1 hour , usually a bit less like 50-55 min , with 5 min breaks in between . 
  arenal sound ( varied ) , [ fib ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/festival_internacional_de_benic%c3%a0ssim ) ( indie ) , vi\u00f1a rock ( rock , ska , rap ) , dreambeach ( edm ) , and as others said , s\u00f3nar ( electronic ) , primavera sound ( varied ) and bbk ( varied ) . 
  yeah , i understood following sports . 
  so if it 's doing them , futsal is popular , along with swimming , athletics and gymanstics . 
  basque and catalan accents are also but tbh i find really amusing being called dick or pussy - meaning dude - as they do in c\u00e1diz . 
  i also find canarian accent difficult to imitate . 
  it has been a growing community . 
  i consider myself more geek - tech stuff - than nerd or gamer - i do n't usually play games . 
  unluckily , being geek does n't make as much conversation as games or anime . 
  tl ; dr : not a problem , but another social group . 
  andalusian dialect is supposed to be the funniest according to the stereotypes . 
  i 'll bet there are comedians that based their career only in their andalusian accent . 
  edit : 2000 of karma !, 
  thanks reddit !, 
  football , basketball , tennis , cycling, 
  not too many people knows what the [ cni ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/centro_nacional_de_inteligencia ) is . 
  afaik there has been some corruption charges to a few higher rank members . 
  * - tell ( me ) ? - , * \u00bf s\u00ed ? 
  * ( yes ? 
  * - yes , tell me ? - . 
  for companies , they present themselves like `` xyz , how we can help you ? '', 
  or `` xyz , tell me ? '', 
  good question ... 
  i also wonder how xd, 
  bq is another spanish device manufacturer . 
  kazam is british , and so on . 
  so there are european smartphones and tech . 
   would you be okay if eu investions billions in order to have european made smartphones ? 
  but the headquarters have to be somewhere , it 's not like * patriotic * consumers want to buy a phone from another european country just because it 's european . 
  tl ; dr : no , i wo n't be ok with government-funded smartphones . 
  companies should invest instead , and there are some through the continent which can afford it . 
  ooooook , then by helicopter !, 
  more or less yep, 
  * spain : a brief history * by the french hispanist pierre vilar is one of the most famous general spanish history books ever published . 
  must be something like this ... by car/train : portugal -  spain -  france -  belgium -  netherlands -  germany -  denmark -  sweden - ferry/plane ?  finland -  russia -  all three baltic countries -  belarus -  poland -  ukraine -  moldova -  romania -  bulgaria -  turkey -  greece -  albania -  macedonia -  kosovo -  montenegro -  serbia -  bosnia -  croatia -  hungary -  slovakia -  czech republic -  austria -  slovenia -  italy -  switzerland -  uk -  ireland all other countries must be arrived by plane . 
  edit : as / r/norway must be leaking i 'll turn off from sweden . 
   do n't know if this is in the whole country it is xd, 
  by here ( madrid ) latin-americans usually own bakeries , fruit shops or pubs/restaurants/bars . 
  by here the * chinos * sell food as well . 
  public tv ( tve ) airs the sunday mass. 
  it also emitted programmes about the catholic church 's labor , as well as jew and islamic tv programmes . 
  13tv is owned by the catholic church . 
  there 's also some hidden channel of an unknown evangelic church . 
  chinese usually own that kind of shop here . 
  in fact , they are n't called convenience stores , they 're called * los chinos * - literally : the chinese - . 
  you can also find morrocans as owners , but it 's mostly in the south and in a much less frequency . 
  not about corruption [ but it 's gold ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7rrgnjeers ), 
  i 'm trying to choose songs that are n't walking stereotypes ... it 's really difficult :( - [ paris ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcb1zn7jo_4 ) - [ southern france , italy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4llzbv9hyry ) - [ london ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0mt1bmvw1y ) - [ germany , northern europe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3q8od5qjio ) - [ russia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2gline0mju ) [ ok , here you have one steeereotyyyype ... !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpoanweyzt8 ), 
  what is worse , some of them are actually famous, 
  the once ? 
  locally it is n't , but lately we have seen too much `` millenials '' . 
  the closest thing i 've seen here is linking the `` generations '' - like in the meaning of contemporary rather than a common upbringing - to historical events - `` los ni\u00f1os de la guerra '' ( children of war , referring to the kids who escaped abroad from the spanish civil war ) , also `` la generaci\u00f3n de la posguerra '' ( post-war generation ) , `` la generaci\u00f3n de la transici\u00f3n '' ( the generation of the spanish transition to democracy , 1970s ) - . 
  trump would love it !, 
  context : jews deported , moors were forced to conversion as well, 
  they 're cheap , standard , low consumption , ecological , customizable , they have their own sports ... 
  you can practise english with them , despite their thickier accent . 
  good music , good design , family there , stockholm regarded as the * venice of the north * , ikea, 
  upvoted , but it 's not like we were too much interested in north america . 
  r/polandball you mean ? 
  i usually read it yep, 
  the problem with madrid 's anthem is that it tells the story of how every other autonomous community rejected having madrid 's province and madrid turned into itself and become a self-centered entity . 
  so it 's not really expected to every madrile\u00f1o to learn it , as you may guess . 
  madrid, 
  here we say * \u00a1 chispa !, 
  * - spark - and you ca n't talk until someone says your name three times , hit you with a fist in your arm , stay still ... 
  if someone says * chispa * when it 's not allowed , you say * \u00a1 gafe !, 
  * - jinx - and the other person takes the punishment . 
  * we wuz moors and shiet fam *, 
  there 's a problem in spain - and probably any country - which is that we repeat our pms/presidents/whoever in charge , and when they fail to something , we change them and keep a bad image of him/her . 
  you just need to learn `` lo '' xd, 
  welcome to 2017 ... manga has become a big thing - maybe still seen as alternative , but definitely not alien . 
  telegram is russian-based , while whatsapp is us-based . 
  in addition , i would n't say there 's a feeling of having * a diaspora * - the word usually refers to long-term emigration . 
  i 'd say nowadays most emigrants think of coming back home eventually . 
  the closest thing would be early 20th century emigration to latin america . 
  western spain : rural tourism eastern spain : beach tourism -- - madrid , barcelona : banks - barcelona , basque country : industry - valencia : smaller industry - asturias , basque country : coal - castille : cereals - mediterranean coast : tourism - la rioja : wine - andalusia , murcia , badajoz : fruit plantations - el ejido : greenhouse plantations - canary islands : tourism , bananas, 
  [ more or less the same ] ( https://www.politicalcompass.org/yourpoliticalcompass?ec=-1.25&amp;soc=-3.74 ), 
  - kevin , johnatan , jeniffer ... white trash or inmigrants - sagrario , concepci\u00f3n , antonia ... old women - jesus anthony , leidy mar\u00eda ... ( any weird compound name ) inmigrants - antonio : older man, 
  spanish dance music is n't at its best moment though . 
  [ anyway ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m6ogs57sc8 ), 
  they 're italians !, 
  no no , actually nowadays spanish music has improved a lot . 
  i 'm [ talking ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmedxpoutwa ) [ about ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a8aotnssmq ) [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlps16nebo0 ), 
  [ as someone else said ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3r06i17llu ), 
  there is an epoch in spanish history that we all want to erase from our memories . 
  and you may say ... religious intolerance ?
