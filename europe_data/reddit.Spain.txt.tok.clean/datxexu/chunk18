  civil wars ? 
  oh no , my friend . 
  it is those years of absolute shitty music intended to be what they call `` spanish summer hits '' . 
  maybe r/askhistorians will do better research , but yes , it was when luther published his 95 theses . 
  actually , public healthcare is cheaper * for everyone * than private healthcare * for everyone * . 
  insulting women and shitting on everything . 
  - * puta * = bitch - * zorra * = bitch - * guarra * = bitch - * hijo de puta * = son of a bitch - * co\u00f1azo * = something annoying , literally * big cunt * - * mierda * = shit - * me cago en ... * and a wide variety of objects , people and non-abstract things like god , the whore , your mother who is a whore , in your fucking skull ... 
  anarchism almost suceeds here . 
  it is n't . 
  [ concierto de aranjuez ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye-fvkczp3s ) , by joaqu\u00edn rodrigo . 
  edit : 7:30 for the famous part, 
  not the same but close would be the * spanish envy * . 
  you ca n't brag about your success . 
  on the other hand , historically we are portrayed as loud-mouthed . 
  you may know already but r/juncker, 
  * gets triggered in portuguese *, 
  yep, 
  the king cake, 
  spain , as a former empire , did have lots of opportunities to expand more and more . 
  i do n't really think it would have got better in the long term . 
  of course there has been bad things done by spain - actually , mostly related to war . 
  but , for example , there were more personal things like francoism . 
  not the weirdest , but i 'd say we use too much oil to fry the chips . 
  i 'd say it 's linked to the housing bubble ( 2000ish-2008 ) . 
   they `` rrr '' instead of `` h '' you just invented it ... you might say / x / instead of `` h '', 
  depends on the type of software . 
  i usually use spanish apart from development software like ides or software without translations . 
  we have a wider range of humour quality . 
  there are monologues , there are spanish films and tv sitcoms that use the same old jokes - sex , stereotypes , the same quotes all the time , etc. - , sketches ' shows - a bit better - ... often , the humour is about spanish idiosyncrasy , so it can be a bit harder to get for foreigners . 
  it 's common to see it in national-level organizations , such as government buildings , although it 's not mandatory . 
  usually , press conferences offered by the government usually feature it . 
  summer olympics : yes , it 's popular , we do n't do nothing else in august so we watch the olympics . 
  basketball and some athletics are especially followed , along with other representatives of the spanish team . 
  winter olympics : not big . 
  just to clarify and not being portrayed as an ignorant , i already know a banger is not a moist dinner . 
  banger refers to the music . 
  it ... it was just a bad joke alright ? 
  that 's what i call a [ banger !, 
  ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/3c/45/0c/3c450ce46a99ab19748284f0262d7104.jpg ), 
  i 'd say it 's not that much common , apart from * special events * - * botellones * , fairs ... - and a couple dirty people with no manners . 
  at least by here , i ca n't say it from where you live . 
  i 'd say most of them , apart from the slovenia/slovakia/serbia , andorra/moldova , netherlands/luxembourg , which share main colors but not a rgb single property or the coat of arms . 
  surprisingly , i had witnessed a raise in awarness for several social movements - the most clear example is feminism and lgbt - , but i 'd say most people , even from the far left , ignore racism - except for the refugee thing - . 
  i admit * banter * as long as the person who says it truly respects that race . 
  but only neonazis and that kind of people would outright say * i do n't like `` sudacas '' * - roughly translated as spics - . 
  however it 's true that the exception is gypsies . 
  here 's a [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5il3cm/why_is_the_hate_directed_towards_roma_so/dbaae6r/ ) i wrote a month ago about roma people . 
  here the kids do n't hug their parents after school as well ... 
  most people have just 1 hour - or even half - to eat . 
  usually those business that have 14-17h for lunch are local shops , which is why it 's more visible . 
  edit : if you were like me and were allowed to have more time , you could take a walk or drink a coffee . 
  an unemployment of 13 % is also desirable in our terms xd, 
   this sounds like they have great cocaine * plata o plomo hijueputa !!, 
  not a thing here in spain ... ... but i find it interesting . 
  it 's cool to know what were your ancerstors doing back in the past . 
  it 's not that focused in tracing your ethnic origins - around here it 's impossible to determine , the crossbreeding is too damn high ! - than the lives of your nearest ancestors . 
  by the beggining of 2016 , mariano rajoy had 628.443 $ saved . 
  his official annual salary is around 80000 $ with extras . 
  not a thing , not even old people . 
  we were in our own * crusades * here in the iberian peninsula . 
  we are n't told much of the levant crusades anyway . 
  the louis * who * ? 
  the barba * what * ? 
   my problems is the speaking part , there is no easy way to practise it without natives on sight i 'd say that 's why people go to academies , the only surefire places to meet a native speaker - the teacher - , especially out of the big cities . 
  i have only found the domestic spiders at home . 
  they are usually respected because they eat the mosquitoes in summer . 
   what form of government your country has , bicameral constitutional monarchy . 
   most important positions in the state , - head of state and chief of spanish armed forces : the king phillip vi - prime minister : mariano rajoy - ministers - mps - supreme court and constitutional court , and in lower level national court  biggest party and their ideology , pp ( popular party ) , centre-right , ruling party . 
   national day october 12th , in homanage to the discovery of the americas . 
   and things that would make a person understand your country better . 
  we ca n't understand it ourselves ... how the hell i could explain it someone else ? 
  do n't ask , just grab some popcorn . 
  impressive !, 
  just for screens ' sizes and something else ... 
  almost never . 
  stats say around 17 - even 15 - , but i 'd say most lose it around 20-25 .

  if it 's france and have french wages and worker rights with spanish prices and not being forced to learn french , ok .

  i would n't say the majority but the * another war , idc * way of thinking . 
  definitely we 'll miss rajoy for his lapsus linguae . 
  pd : wrong link for the hispano-russian sex agreements, 
  there are like 6000 in whole spain - very few - . 
  they 'll just be asked out of curiosity . 
  although * jud\u00edo * - jew - can also mean * mean * . 
  nevertheless , anti-zionism does exist . 
  and [ azca ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/madrid-azca-castellana-170913.jpg ) , infamous by their undergrounds . 
  i know people who know self-declared national-socialists , but that 's all . 
  alt right or a `` extreme capitalist-conservative right '' is much more common . 
  - uk - sweden - estonia, 
  those countries have survived the conquest of bigger countries by different ways . 
  usually these countries are good long-time friends with their neighbours since the early middle ages , or just defended by someone else - an example would be luxembourg owned by the spanish empire - . 
  i 'd rather ask in r/askhistorians for more details . 
   especially in shorter 15-20 minute trips that 's the main problem actually . 
  longer commute times are far more common , and buses have shorter lines and depending of the line and the time , less frequency than metro 's . 
  buses are useful for more isolated areas , or cross lines . 
  ianal but here 's a [ link ] ( http://www.mjusticia.gob.es/cs/satellite/portal/en/servicios-ciudadano/tramites-gestiones-personales/cambio-nombre-apellidos ) in the case of spain .

  to date , i wonder what could make someone go to that place, 
  in madrid .
