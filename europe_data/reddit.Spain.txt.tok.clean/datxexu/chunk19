  i should have said before that older people are majority in the mass . 
  however , i have met several younger - and not that younger - practicing catholics . 
  they seem to have perfect lives . 
  defects do n't exist in them . 
  even when they have , they still have the aura of perfection , and give you a self-helping kind of advice . 
  it definitely deserves a sociological study . 
  i know there are a lot of states , and i almost can name all , but i 'm a bit lazy today :( stereotypes : - new york : skyscrapers , subway , blacks and puerto ricans - pensilvania : philadelphia , rocky balboa - new england : an urban area - florida : cubans , beaches , miami vice , swamps - alabama : forrest gump - texas : chuck norris , some western films - arizona : desert - new mexico : desert for testing nukes - nevada : las vegas and its casinos , area 51 , desert - south california : hollywood , more inmigrants and blacks , traffic jams - san francisco bay area : the bridge , silicon valley - northwest coast : virgin lands and progressive people - south dakota : mount rushmore - illinois : chicago - michigan : token name for any random us state , detroit - any other state would be * deep america * , a mix of the bible belt , the tornado alley , and other several belts referring to farming or a rural lifestyle , full of rednecks or conservative people . 
  trigger alert : shameless stereotypes chinese : they own convienence shops and restaurants . 
  they reach everywhere in spain . 
  they hide a bit from spanish/other inmigrants social life . 
  japanese : tourists . 
  and all the hype of anime and stuff that 's really popular . 
  koreans : a few otakus like k-pop . 
  bad commie guy in the north , geeks in the south . 
  thais : we hear news from them thanks to this [ guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frank_cuesta ) filipinos : the forgotten colonised . 
  there are some expats like any other expat would be . 
  vietnamese : kicked out yanks indian hindus : poor sikhs : some religion pakistanis : some war near them, 
  some stereotypes : - practicing catholics/members of catholic denominations or groups : too perfect to be real people - opus dei : large families and a bit wealthier than average - jehova 's witnesses : sect , '' * do you have a minute to hear the word of god ? 
  * '' - mormons : polygamy in us , tall american missionaries here - other christian evangelical churches : full of latinos here , normal thing in us - orthodox : i suppose they exist , for eastern europe 's expats/inmigrants - copts : attacked by islamists edit : fucked-up words, 
  central and west madrid , barcelona 's centre , marbella , ibiza and sotogrande ( near gibraltar ) . 
  about 10 i suppose, 
  what 's up with you guys and the russians ? 
  in madrid : - [ callao square , towards gran v\u00eda ] ( http://brockmansblog.occupidigital.netdna-cdn.com/es/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/03/plaza-callao-madrid.jpg ) - [ cuatro torres business area from the other side of chamart\u00edn train station ] ( https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8789/17258548775_fa32cc103a.jpg ), 
  i may have told before in other posts like this one , but it should be pacted among , if possible all , if not the majority of political parties in the parliament . 
  i 'm still waiting for the vaunted * pacto por la educaci\u00f3n * - agreements in education - and its outcome . 
  in spain it has become rare to see someone in traditional clothing , at least daily . 
  i suppose in the deepest and tiniest valleys of galicia and asturias old women use it more often . 
  nevertheless , in some villages you can see people wearing special clothing in festivals , * fiestas * or fairs . 
  i ca n't say names of towns , and it would be difficult to do research as in every shire they had their own dresses . 
  [ kind of ] ( https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-myqt5ndssv0/aaaaaaaaaai/aaaaaaaalow/7k3zrar3ttm/s0-c-k-no-ns/photo.jpg ), 
  - the thing of dropout apprendiceship/vocational training - in spain , former pcpi , nowadays * fp b\u00e1sica * ( basic professional training ) - is useless , it should be abolished . 
  everybody must complete the compulsory secondary education - eventually , most people do it , as you ca n't go anywhere without having it - . 
  - post-secondary education , as it is mostly funded by governments , should check job trends periodically and intervene in the courses ' offer , at least in vocational training programs . 
  - universities should be a little more elitist and should have defined standards regarding to the teaching methodology . 
  - degrees in teaching should be harder to get , so we could get smarter teachers and the job gets more respect among population and institutions . 
  - to avoid differences in education quality among regions , i would make a nation-wide standard curriculum for compulsory education , with several models to allow other languages being introduced - such as regional languages or foreign languages - . 
  edit : in first bullet point, 
  f * ck , i came late to the party, 
   are pets familymembers ? 
  depends on the household . 
  families usually keep pets as one more member - some * too much * - , while countrymen can use them - dogs - as property guards , shepherds or helpers for hunting . 
   how well are they respected ? 
  i would say pets are treated well within the families and associations , but not that good in the countryside . 
   can humans treat them as they want to ? 
  animal abuse is very frowned upon , especially nowadays where there 's more awareness . 
   what laws protect animals ? 
  every region has their own laws against animal abuse . 
  it can vary a lot , and also how enforced the laws are . 
  * reservistas voluntarios * - voluntary reservists - are just the replacement of lower range regular military , usually for a few weeks a year - usually for update courses or training . 
  you can be sent abroad if it 's necessary . 
  yeah but it 's in decline as most texts follow the norm from the rae , which is actually recent -2005 - . 
  the major/minor thing does n't exist here . 
  universitary studies usually touches on few different subjects or fields , but that 's it . 
  another point would be that in certain areas some people work in fighting bulls ' cattles .

  spanish as mother tongue and english . 
  very little use of english outside classes or the internet , like 8 or 9 times in my whole life . 
   also , in england , `` no '' can mean `` yes '' , depending on the context . 
  you are n't the only ones ... that 's just the central europeans are n't polite enough :p, 
  - daily minimum wage : 23,59 $ - domestic workers : 5,54 $ / hour vat : - general : 21 % - reduced : 10 % ( food , transport , ... ) - superreduced : 4 % ( daily food , books , press , medical stuff , ... ), 
  andr\u00e9s - andrew - comes from greek * andr\u00f3s * - man - . 
  any name with an `` r '' sounds more masculine . 
  it was said before that the terminology was confusing , but i agree that it 's more social to care about welfare and rights at the same time . 
  the approach * liberty vs security * is proven to be just a fallacy . 
  tbh they keep me amused . 
  i 'm waiting for the mediterraneans are n't white or if scandinavia is socialist, 
  nope , but been mistaken for a foreigner a few times , usually a south american or a middle east guy . 
  i 'm not 100 % sure but i see you 're ` murican . 
  almost 30 % of the new business created in the us are founded by inmigrants . 
  rates in other countries are just slightly lower , the same goes for europe . 
  in an economic crisis like we 're having , people take less risks , but capitalism - any economic system really - is based in moving the money and invest , despite that risk . 
  if inmigrants can come up with new ideas , some spare money and need to work for his/her business , most of the money will be for the country they 're living in - taxes , wages ... - . 
  at least , that 's how it 's told how america went great . 
  u/juronich it returns an http 404 error for me . 
  seems like mozilla complains that there 's not a certificate because it does n't exist ( edit : the page ) . 
  ------------------------------------------ as u/bunburya said , complain to eba or bank of spain, 
  in spain you are able to get both subjects as well . 
  which i find a bit misleading as you are n't taught the language but the syntax and some etymology . 
  early spanish is n't a big issue as we have the same rules from 500 years ago . 
  the only difficulties are vocabulary and a couple of replaced letters . 
  never heard of that acronym but the full name - i guess it 's the translation of isil - . 
  yes , but some media guidelines discourage its use . 
  we do n't really learn a lot of geography in school . 
  we can guess which continent a country belongs to , but not learning their capitals by heart . 
  we focus a lot more in spain , and in a lesser extent europe . 
  we also learn a bit more about trade dynamics and economic stuff in general . 
  we are taught world physical geography as well , but just where the geographic elements/units are . 
  from what i 've heard , there are less social mobility and it 's a bit more conservative society .
