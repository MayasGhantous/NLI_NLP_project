  no , it 's that reddit is not a thing here . 
  we just use other sites . 
  the same goes for the memondo network and facef-ck ... sorry , facebook , and instagram as well , through 9gag . 
  forocoches , elotrolado , mediavida , ... also contribute to make reddit not popular here .

  emigration rates are n't really that trusted though . 
  you wo n't be automatically registered as `` emigrant '' whenever you go to live abroad . 
  some people do n't do the paperwork for that , so i could have been living elsewhere and spanish administration have n't noticed . 
   never move out of family 's house , never spend blame mortgages ( house ownership ),

  answering your question , i think the outcome will be unpredictable in case a referendum is allowed . 
  economy in both sides will eventually go ahead despite the inmediate consequences of the result . 
  i ca n't think of any way to make catalans ( or any demonym about having their territory turn to a state or an independent nation ) think completely logical . 
  the most important factor will always be being full catalan or belonging to spain , in a more essentialist way . 
  i have never seen so many stereotypes in one map ...

  was n't he sukarno , from indonesia ? 
   soviet poster - we should live in peace.however , surprised happened sometimes too , like it was with the notorious case for seducing indonesian president ahmed sukarno . 
  he was known for his sexual passion . 
  that is why kgb sent a group of young girls to him during his visit to moscow . 
  those girls got acquainted with ahmed sukarno in a plane , under the disguise of air hostesses , then he invited them to his hotel room in moscow and arranged a grand orgy . 
  the orgy was filmed by two candid cameras that were fixed behind mirrors . 
  it seemed that the operation was just perfect . 
  before starting the blackmail , kgb invited sukarno in a small private movie theatre and showed him the pornographic video , in which he was playing the main part . 
  kgb agents were expecting him to get really frightened , that he would agree to cooperate with them at once , but everything happened vice versa : sukarno fondly decided that it was a gift from the soviet government , so he asked for more copies to take them back to indonesia and show them in movie theatres . 
  sukarno said to flabbergasted agents that the people of indonesia would be very proud of him , if they could see him doing the nasty with russian girls .

  best comment in this thread, 
  good job but i do n't get danish stereotype, 
  yeah but what i mean is that most people do n't know any russian , nor met any . 
  i supposed you were in catalonia 's coast - specifically salou , i 've seen a couple of russian shops there - , because it 's where most russian tourists go . 
  edit : what 's up with the downvote . 
  i just do n't get why he was thought to be russian . 
  do we even know what it is ?

  in fact , you almost invented it for us . 
  tbh i had the impression from the very beginning that brexit was n't about refugees or racism , but european/eu inmigration , it is , pigs , eastern europe ... 
  i do n't know how common is that kind of inmigration - although i have to admit that most people choose uk because of english language , instead of , for example , germany , switzerland or sweden - , but any sensible government would n't risk the relations with eu if it was n't because not only about europe , but europeans themselves . 
  the same happens with spain . 
  some former inmigrants are moving/have already moved back to their countries . 
  i could notice it especially in the romanian community . 
  sorting out the inmigration from the natives is difficult when at the same time a big part of the first group got the host country 's citizenship . 
  anyway , in the article it clarifies some of the observed phenomena .

  the eu agency says neets are at a higher risk of being socially and politically alienated . 
  imo these news need a flair to correct the title . 
  the article says stats about neets and then add this statement/hypotesis .
