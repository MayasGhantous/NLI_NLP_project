  portugal to west spain and usa to new spain ( * d'you remember ? 
  also there are those old names from christian tradition , like * sagrario * ( tabernacle , female name ) . 
  it sounds like an element in the periodic table . 
  who are the most poor guys in china ? 
  chin-lu , chin-awa and chin-gas ( * sin luz , sin agua y sin gas * - without-electricity , without-water and without-gas - ), 
  wwiii will start in this thread guys, 
  convince them that israel and palestine should join together in an officially non-religious state . 
  palestinians can benefit from israel western-level development and israel can do with palestinian workforce . 
  ~ ~ this new state would move the government institutions to jerusalem . ~ ~ you may think that this is way too optimistic , but irl they have to coexist anyway . 
  merging their interests is a way of overcoming them . 
  another solution would be moving population to somewhere in china - empty cities already built - or russia , and grant some autonomy . 
  they do n't look as * gangsta * as us trap , for example . 
  aesthetics , especially with the dora black label , do n't match as well with hip-hop culture . 
  places to visit before die :  - ~ ~ france ~ ~, 
  i find spanish trap too ironic ... 
  i also have found them in hospitals , schools ... 
  i admit it 's not that common outside . 
  it 's mostly on the internet ... edit : not mostly , almost entirely, 
  i use cast-iron for toasts and the rest of dishes are made with non-stick pans - usually teflon - . 
  some old people use ceramic pans and casseroles as well . 
  we 're aware that romanian is a romance language . 
  another thing is when giving examples or enumerating when all languages are n't needed . 
  then we 're likely to mention languages geographically closer to us or more famous/spoken , when usually spanish , italian and french are mentioned first . 
  we will have to do a tiny , little more effort mentioning the rest of the languages - portuguese , catalan , galician , romanian ... - . 
  i 'm amazed right now . 
  i have eaten that fatty sandwiches in the most * suburban-never-changed-the-decoration-since-the-70s * bar . 
  but here they add ketchup and mayo . 
  obviously we did n't call it * metralleta * . 
  they were so popular that my high school cafeteria started making them . 
  f * cking up health guys . 
   veins explode, 
  i would say the coast - which at the same time it 's very divided among these regions - and mainland - a bit less divided - . 
  [ more or less like this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spaniards#nationalisms_and_regionalisms ), 
  inflation due to export , so some general strikes as people could n't buy at * european * prices . 
  and the key basic points of the war - the alliances , sarajevo 's assasination , trenches , `` spanish '' flu ... - spain remained neutral even among the society . 
  few people or institutions took part in one side - * abc * newspaper was pro-german - . 
  actually it 's pretty common here in spain . 
  in fact , there are several apps to find drinking fountains . 
  in my high school they launched an issue every trimester . 
  the magazine had a color cover and black and white pages . 
  it featured mainly stories or real experiences , rather than news , although some opinion columns were published as well . 
  anyway i have n't seen them almost anywhere else - maybe some private schools - and most of the time they have their news published int their websites . 
  recently some social media profiles were opened as well . 
  some people are pissed off by the fact that some gypsies are richer than them , and * presumebly * getting benefits from the governments - social housing , school programs inspired in affirmative action ... - , very sexist , and so on . 
  i had the oportunity of meeting a few roma people myself . 
  in this case , she was rejected by her husband 's family because she did n't want to go every day to his dead husband 's tomb - she was battered - . 
  she was n't allowed the chance of getting a job , and suddenly she needed to find one to feed her children , and struggled with the community services to keep them . 
  one of her younger daughters told that she would n't marry a gypsy man ever . 
  i could also meet some more gypsies in middle school , and they all seemed very angry towards the rest - non-gypsies , which were both natives and inmigrant descendants - and ended as dropouts . 
  one of them did n't like it when she was called gypsy . 
  it 's not that we are making impossible to roma people to integrate , is that roma communities should be aware that nowadays it 's important to educate their youth , and not consenting that they ca n't study , in fact they have to nowadays , i have seen them in vocational training both men and women for instance . 
  but it should be clear despite my statement that the prejudices against gypsies do exist - they steal , families/clans are like mafias ... - , and it does lead to discrimination . 
  but i 'm afraid that the only way to overcome is adapting the younger generations to the non-gypsy world , and revising their social rules - acceptance of different sexual options , letting women being independent and protect them from early marriage ... - . 
  - + 30 anarchism - + 20 shitting in everything - may be god , your bitch mother , the calm sea , st petersburg , your race , your genealogical tree ... - - + 20 in fucking off - - 20 in the art of the dialectics, 
  basically he 's another american/latin popstar . 
  resembles his father in the obsession with girls ... 
  french touch !, 
  puttin ' the funk into the house again !, 
   dutch djs definitely not only known in the netherlands [ haha ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dj_magazine#top_100_djs_-_2016 ) i suppose you guys are sick of hearing edm all the time then ... let 's exchange it with our reggaeton .

  [ no problemo , amigo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_english_words_of_spanish_origin ) hasta la vista . 
   maybe they concentrate on specific areas most likely response , last time i 've been in the mediterranean coast was like 5 years ago, 
   abroad anyway in that case we fancy to have been in marbella or a villa in ibiza . 
  open question to portuguese : is estoril still popular ? 
  here is mostly the big western cities : london , paris , rome , new york, 
  surprised by the popularity in sweden , i think i had n't came across one for a very long time, 
  - * portuguese-style chicken * , which is chicken with potato and other vegetables , boiled in wine . 
  * recipe may vary * . 
  it 's not the same as macau 's namesake . 
  - * american salad * is the american coleslaw - * french omelette * , the same in english - * cuban-style rice * , basically rice with tomato sauce and a fried egg . 
  - you can often find that bratwurst sausages are simply * german sausages * . 
  - * swedish meatballs * are the k\u00f6ttbullar - [ flamenquines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flamenqu%c3%adn#/media/file:bar_bonillo.jpg ) - literally * little flemish * - are like rolled san jacobos/cordon bleu , but with cured ham and other fillings like cheese , raw egg ... - [ * bulgarians * ] ( http://www.dulcema.com/latino/images/producto/rollito/rollito.gif ) are cake rolls covered with chocolate . 
  * bulgarians * also refer to kefir . 
  edit : added * bulgarians * edit 2 : grammar, 
  am i weird if i find south europeans with more masculine traits and eastern europeans as more femenine ( both in men and women ) ? 
  [ real eurovision anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmfw9k5o94w ) / s, 
   no mention of muslim heritage nor the word reconquista  - medieval iberia what is medieval iberia after all ? 
  i found later it was a real sub xd, 
  / r/metricmasterrace, 
  yep . 
  actually we have a few catholic [ ones ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:roman_catholic_universities_and_colleges_in_spain ), 
  in a nutshell : - medieval iberia ( [ the reconquista ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reconquista ) , [ al-andalus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-andalus ) ) - [ the habsburgs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/habsburg_spain ) - spanish civil war , franco and [ * the transition * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_transition_to_democracy ) ( to democracy ) edit : links added, 
  1 ) people : the chinese community is huge here in spain , while other inmigrants only live in cities , you can find them even in more remote towns . 
  it strikes me that they lead to make business - shops , restaurants ... - instead of being employed . 
  it 's like they are even more capitalists than us despite growing in a * socialist * regime . 
  chinese people usually get along themselves , although the younger generations are getting used to spanish people easier , which i suppose is natural that second-generation inmigrants get along better with natives . 
  they are usually seen as quiet - in contrast with us , the second most noisy country in the world - , and adults as hard-working people . 
  2 ) culture : it must be huge , but we mostly receive the best-known stuff here in the west - confucius , cantonese food ... - as we are n't prone to go deeper in chinese culture . 
  3 ) government : i would n't say we would be eager to exchange our popular party - centre-right - for the chinese communist party . 
  in foreign policy we are n't aware what 's up in africa with china , for instance . 
  apparently the chinese administration did n't like it when some chinese businessmen were arrested for corruption here in spain . 
  it will sound obvious but check out numismatics ' online shops . 
  is eurotunnel too french ? 
  not a cruel conqueror but a patient conqueror -200 years or so to complete the conquest . 
  it is part of our culture - seneca , the antonine dynasty , the ruins ... - , without the romans the history of spain and portugal would be very different . 
  you also gave us a favour building some bridges and roads for us . 
  and then we replicated your ways in america - mining silver and agriculture - ... tl ; dr : gg wp italians, 
  spain is more varied in that sense , so the north takes most of the rain and the south takes the peak hot-almost-burning temperatures . 
  here in mainland spain the weather is * continentalised * , it is , more differences of temperature . 
  so i can wake up easily ( 7:00 ) by 5\u00bac and get out of work or school ( 14:00 ) with 20\u00bac , especially in autumn .
