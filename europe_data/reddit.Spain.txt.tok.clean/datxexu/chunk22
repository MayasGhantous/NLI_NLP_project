  i would make 20\u00bac every time so i wo n't carry the coat because it 's too hot . 
  i also like the warm breeze of late spring , so i would n't bring any stronger wind as well . 
  they are n't the 0 - ( -10 ) \u00bac of northern europe but definitely you can get a few colds throughout the winter . 
  between the two it 's obvious which museum i would go ... !, 
  the british museum must be an history-gasm, 
  [ fernando alonso ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/fernando_alonso ), 
  tbh i thought madame tussauds ' was prestigious . 
  - trebuchets that can launch 90kg projectiles over 300m for everyone - deus vult everytime when israel and palestine fight again - better relations with ` murica as the donald is president - paradox interactive would be forced to give copies of their games to every eu 's citizen - gib monies plox to pigs ' countries in a more serious approach i think privacy and net neutrality is a bigger deal here than irl , so i think they will suggest pushing the limits to government agencies and corporations about their right to investigate their citizens ' internet use . 
  [ madrid 's wax museum ] ( http://www.que.es/archivos/201410/alonso_cera-672xxx80.jpg ), 
  actually it 's growing , however it 's not as good as we could . 
  basically most companies do it consulting . 
  known local ones are indra , everis and amadeus . 
  the vast majority of software developers for general public - i.e. 
  mobile apps , web services and sites ... - ca n't get out from just being start-ups . 
  a known veteran one is panda software . 
  1.64 m/5 ' 5 '' it 's rather normal for women ( average height is 1.63 m ) but men are usually taller ( like 1.70-1 .90 , average height is 1.74 m ) . 
  as a shorter male i 'm a bit conscious , but it is n't a problem in regard to daily life . 
  what about * profe * ? 
  so you guys would be the x-men ? 
  those who do n't own flats usually own [ townhouses ] ( https://img3.idealista.com/blur/web_detail-l-l/0/id.pro.es.image.master/b1/9c/d0/131572087.jpg ) , with a front `` garden '' - most of the times they 're used to park the car or it 's used as a terrace - and a back garden - depending on the size of it , it may have a lawn and/or it 's a tiled floors ' ground - . 
  if you 're lucky enough to buy a villa or a big bungalow you can have a pool as well . 
  there 's a phenomena in certain places that people have a flat in the city and then they buy a house or a plot in the outskirts of the city for the hotter days and the weekends . 
  this is the case of some people who have a second house in the madrid 's near mountains . 
  i have observed the same in barcelona , asturias , andalusia , extremadura ... 
  now i remember there were some [ old games ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_era_of_spanish_software ) for zx spectrum or similar ones ... 
  i could have seen play [ the crime of the abbey ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_abad%c3%ada_del_crimen ) - adaptation from * in the name of the rose * - , for instance . 
  edit : the game is free in [ steam ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/474030 ), 
  when barbarians sends its people , they 're not sending their best . 
  they 're not sending you . 
  they 're sending people that have lots of problems , and they 're bringing those problems with us . 
  they 're bringing raids . 
  they 're bringing crime . 
  they 're rapists . 
  and some , i assume , are saxons ... 
  i would build a great wall , and nobody builds walls better than me , believe me , and i 'll build them very inexpensively , i will build a great , great wall on our northern border . 
  and i will have scots pay for that wall . 
  el presidente here ... or else !, 
  imperivum saga and the tzar saga were also good . 
  this confused me  the gypsy kid is also polish so the kid is n't gypsy then ... alright !, 
  the majority of gypsies are also spanish so ... 3 out of 3 !, 
  / r/justspanishthings, 
  a chinese air gun and a lead small bullet rifle . 
   miguel \u00c1ngel revilla : governor of cantabria . 
  ... spanish trump/berlusconi in order not to get someone confused , he leans more towards the left . 
  i would say spain is a good candidate as the spanish empire did the same as ` murica did ( and still do ) to support the interests of some rich dudes regardless of the people 's wish . 
  the climatology in both countries is varied and the economy is also very located in some key areas . 
  we share some other social phenomena like the urban sprawl , the decrease of freight rail transport in favour of highways/motorways , social conflicts with inmigration and progressive measures and advances - like abortion - ... even like 80 % of the media in spain is made in usa . 
  historically we wanted to hide all the bad in the americas ' conquest , and religion has influenced in a great part of our politics and society , especially in rural areas . 
  i could n't find the [ grand mcextreme ] ( https://www.mcdonalds.es/productos/sandwiches ) burgers in other mcdonald 's local sites , not even a single reference in english media . 
  there are three versions : - ( goat ) cheese & sweet peppers - ( melted ) cheese & mushrooms ( & bacon ) - gouda , bacon , red onion , bacon sauce there has been other limited editions of burgers for mcdonald 's by spanish famous chefs . 
  they also sell the traditional spanish * gazpacho * - tomato soup - . 
  [ charles v disagrees ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_v,_holy_roman_emperor ), 
  through the 20th century people moved mainly to madrid , barcelona , valencia and the basque country , and in lesser extent to seville , asturias , valladolid and other provincial capitals . 
  madrid , as the capital of spain and hosting the headquarters of most of the big companies and banks , attracts more workers from other regions . 
  i suppose the same goes for barcelona . 
  [ stats of internal migration by 2014 ] ( https://st3.idealista.com/news/archivos/styles/imagen_big_lightbox/public/2014-08/analisis_de_la_movilidad_interprovincial_it_2010-2014_2014-08-12_12-43-20.jpeg?sv=sbnblfmu&amp;itok=uh0ogatp ) * blue number : people who inmigrate to work in the region * flesh number : people who emigrate to other regions * the same goes for the map region 's colour , to highlight the outcome, 
  from what i 've heard your field interest is very particular and there has been only a couple of experiments with music generators by ais . 
  i would focus in ai instead of music theory as the ai resources and theory will likely to set the project 's path . 
  there are masters in ai in a few european universities , to be followed after your computer science degree . 
  another thing is the music production or sound engineering degrees - covering the tech/maths , some music theory and music business stuff - , but i highly doubt it covers anything about ai . 
  good luck with your career !, 
  i do n't mind if you ask this things here - not a mod , not by business anyway - but i guess you wanted to ask in / r/askreddit or / r/askwomen ... 
  i do n't think anyone would get upset if someone else learns his/her mother tongue anyway ... !, 
  those - more likely to happen with english-speakers - who want to practice their spanish with locals will find that most of those locals want to practice english or your mother tongue with you at the same time . 
  negotiate the amount of time for speaking in each language . 
  there is a motogp big scene here - as motogp pilots are basically italians and spaniards - , there 's some bikers ' community , some local rallies through rural roads . 
  tuning was related to * canis * subculture - chavs , scullies - but as * canis * fade away the tuning scene lost popularity - cars ' culture in general - . 
   * brain explodes *   * joins efta *, 
  in addition to salamanca 's district and la moraleja - northern madrid - . 
  chamber\u00ed has also higher standards of living . 
  i realised i said the wrong preposition ... actually i hate telemarketing xd,

  the circlejerk of spaniards buying towels in portugal because they 're cheaper , and do n't dry properly . 
  but at least it 's fun and we 're more used to it, 
  sharing the [ feeling ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/11/14/1415954562162_wps_48_brightly_coloured_towels_.jpg ) , dear neighbor . 
  in the other thread it was said that argentinian accent was attractive . 
  ... but it 's tiring as hell . 
  they seem to be overly talkative . 
  i suppose the spanish way is closer to the american way than the aforementioned english or german ways . 
  however it really depends on the place . 
  some shops and bars ' employees are allowed or encouraged to talk with the clients - you can engage in conversation with some waiters , or shop assistants will ask you if you are looking for something - while in others there is more distance - take the other , serve and come if they 're asked for the bill , or not moving from the cash desk until they 're asked - . 
  the demographics of the client and the employee in charge are also likely to modify the behaviour , for example , being regular costumers , the position/workplace - hairdressers like to talk more - , the clients - tourists are n't as prone to be engaged in any chat than locals because of the language barrier - . 
  tips are n't the norm here , but some people leave the change or the cent coins .

  long live to sandwiches of any kind !, 
  definitely the most popular snack around the world . 
  in a year , 1492 . 
  spanish suffering a boom of homemade - basically not mcdonalds/bk - burger restaurants here . 
  pasta , pizza , burgers are probably the most eaten . 
  son of military officer here . 
  to be honest , basque country is another world in that sense ... 
  does the ertzaintza carry any other stereotype ? 
  there exists * the old guard * of right-wing officers , but definitely in the new generations the right-wing is not the majority . 
  not to mention that the highest army positions are elected by the defence minister , so it 's a political decision . 
  i admit most of our * canis * , especially where there is n't too much industry , ended up joining any police corps , army , firefighters ... and actually military people have some advantages , and lately the military podemos ' group complained about the high-range officers ' corruption .
