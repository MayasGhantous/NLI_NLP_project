  but those who have military vocation usually go for an officer career . 
  the concept of * veteran * dates back to the spanish post-war , where they could have some other benefits . 
  a circlejerk rather than a joke . 
  families used to buy towels and other home clothing in portugal because it is cheaper , and towels were said to not be able to dry properly . 
  in some forums you can see the whole joke of how portugal 's currency is the towel and that stuff ... 
  those spaniards near portugal 's border sometimes buy there as it 's a bit more cheaper . 
  that joke of the portuguese towels exist because of this . 
  it 's pretty normal here , especially in bigger towns and cities , although there are places where it 's illegal - valladolid comes to mind - . 
  shopping centres ' entrances , corners , trains/metro ... 
  if you visit spain you must find at least one or two anywhere you go . 
  then also you have the guys who play music or those who sells tissues or anything handy in the metro . 
  another group of beggars are the eastern european beggars , who are made to do it by mafias , and africans who sell * la farola * - * the lamp * - , a newspaper that claims that * gives food and home * , but his editor was prosecuted for fraud . 
  nowadays we are more focused on the human problems than the animals ' . 
  it 's just that there is n't enough awareness , therefore some people can avoid being punished , or they 're just fined . 
  [ world animal protection index - spain ] ( http://api.worldanimalprotection.org/country/spain ) edit : [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/animal_welfare_and_rights_in_spain ), 
  it 's what i said ... they can also be adopted abroad . 
  in fact , they 're the most likely to be abandoned , especially in rural areas , where hunters and farmers can use them rather than taking care of them . 
  there is n't a huge debate on the issue , so we do n't care too much about it , although we are aware of the cruelty in some farms . 
  there are laws to favour the well-being of the animals , most of it depending on the local or regional authorities , so there can be huge differences . 
  i would write more but it 's too big to cover every case . 
  people from other countries can adopt rescued abandoned pets and other animals . 
  i ca n't tell you more but i know some are brought to german , french or italian families in some associations . 
  mainland spain as well . 
  at least gallicians have the way of st james . 
  ^ madrid ^ and ^ salamanca ^ do n't ^ count !, 
  it 's common - although not often wanted - , instagram among youth and facebook for more adult people . 
  some of the spanish electronic music scene is growing abroad . 
  it 's the case of dimension - the trance musician - , eh!de - dubstep - , henry saiz - house - and some more . 
  spanish/latin-american rap scene is also good , although it may be because of the ability of rhythm with fewer phonemes . 
  both did , however i admit it was n't that easy for [ goya ] ( http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/goya/hd_goya.htm ) . 
   although repulsed by french atrocities , goya pledged allegiance to bonaparte , and painted members of the french regime . 
  in 1811 , he was awarded the royal order of spain . 
    the bourbon monarchy was restored with napoleon 's fall in 1814 . 
  but the new king , ferdinand vii , son of charles iv , did not share the enlightened views of his predecessor . 
  he revoked the constitution , reinstated the inquisition , and declared himself absolute monarch . 
  not long afterward , he launched a reign of terror . 
  questioned about his loyalty to the occupiers , goya demonstrated his allegiance by commemorating spain 's uprising against the french regime in two paintings : the second of may 1808 and the third of may 1808 . 
  it must be just there because the english sieges even embarrassed the english officials themselves . 
  cartagena ? 
  he achieved to kidnap our royal family , made business with some aristocrats and put his brother in the spanish throne . 
  this is the real beginning of the political divisions in a national level , regardless of where you live . 
  it is known that some spaniards , like goya , supported napoleon , while his enemies made the [ parallel courts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/c%c3%a1diz_cortes ) . 
  not to mention the spanish americas ' rebellions and later independence wars . 
  tl ; dr : not very well-appreciated, 
  background/source ? 
  tv shows usually feature it , but i do n't think it 's that much popular among users , apart from prime time programmes . 
  it is said that spain 's ugliest city is [ castell\u00f3n ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/castell%c3%b3n_de_la_plana ) . 
  this guy knows, 
  here we also have that stereotype of the cheating mechanics ... nowadays most drivers bring the cars to official brands ' mechanics , or those hired by the insurance company , so they are paying it . 
  electricians require license to work . 
  10\u00ba c , partially cloudy on average . 
  for a day , the circle of gran v\u00eda - plaza de espa\u00f1a ( access to temple of debod ) - bail\u00e9n ( by the royal palace ) - calle mayor ( and access to plaza mayor ) - carrera de san jer\u00f3nimo - paseo del prado covers most of madrid 's landmarks . 
  italy and croatia must be beautiful to visit . 
  french , russian , and in a special mention , bbc or high-pitched english . 
  1,20 $ the 2 litres bottle, 
  1940s i think, 
  i was going to say this . 
  in addition , i would mention the dilemma/struggle of being * more western * or * more eastern * i notice when i see news from turkey , like how different are istambul or izmir from the most southeastern regions . 
  but i do think that in some areas there * were * ( 2010-2013 ) a hipster fashion wave among the youth in general . 
  now the only hipsters that last are real hipsters , and they are n't that common , and the whole hype of the homemade beer and barbershops are already well-established among different demogrpahic groups . 
  - [ the official madrid 's tourism youtube channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/esmadridtelevision/videos ) - [ from the autonomous community ( features outskirts of madrid ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/turismomadrid/videos ), 
  depends on the social group . 
  some are more aware of our atrocities in our former colonies , while others even celebrate it . 
  i would say it exists , but for distinguish * pure ethnic spaniards * from other nationalities , ethnicities or races . 
  if you 're * mulato * , you wo n't be called mixed-race but black , your new nick will be '' * the black * '' . 
  there has been groups like cantajuego who took some popular/traditional kids ' songs . 
  miliki - a spanish tv clown , belonging to an old spanish circus tv show called * los payasos de la tele * , which you can also find songs of them - also made albums . 
  there are protected areas in our municipalities . 
  the level of protection depends on what organization ( the state , the town council , unesco ... ) named something as valuable and protected and the laws enforced in each case . 
  around important monuments , such as la sagrada familia of barcelona , seville 's giralda or aranjuez 's royal palace , it 's not permitted to build taller buildings . 
  whenever rajoy say something ... quotes are golden pieces of knowledge and logic :  a glass is a glass and a plate is a plate  by the roads it 's where cars must drive and planes take off from airports  we have to build machines to allow us to build more machines , as what machines wo n't do is to build machines themselves at the same time  [ eta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eta_\\ ( separatist_group \\ ) ) is a big nation  it 's the resident who votes for the mayor and it 's the mayor who wants the residents to be the mayor  i like catalans because they make things other circlejerks are the vegan trend , the * feminazi * trend , the trap music trend ... edit : link corrected, 
  what 's happening there ? 
  anyway everybody knows someone who is more keen on religion - opus dei and stuff - , despite most from the rest do n't really care about it . 
  do not forget about forocoches , burbuja.com ... 
  i find forocoches more similar to reddit than meneame - despite sharing the same structures - because its community is bigger and more varied , despite having their registration closed . 
  rambo , apocalpyse now ... 
  you 're mixing up 2 different things . 
  rusophilia is to admire russia 's culture , not russian women . 
  i have heard of the whole thing of the russian mail brides , how they 're submissive , beautiful blah blah ... ** but there are more reasons to learn russian , such as kids ' adoptions , or for business with russian rich people , or simply the pleasure of learning it . 
  ** russia is socially more conservative than western europe , which is another thing and i can understand it can lead to suspiction . 
  i would dare to say that all we know about vietnam is taught by hollywood ... 
   ordinateur was an old french word thanks for giving us * ordenador * instead of * computadora * - computer , used mainly in latin america , obvious english etymology - . 
  some words for car parts comes from carriage parts . 
  another good example is * azafata * - flight attendant , stewardess , hostess - . 
  it used to be the queen 's clothes ' maid . 
  in the 40s , the state-owned iberia airlines named the flight attendants like this . 
  some family . 
  i have a cousin who was in lebanon and now is in iraq , my father went to kosovo - like half of the spanish army has been there ... -, 
  actually trains are comfortable , but we lack of electric railways in some areas . 
  lacks of the ol' games that the solution was discovered with a button or something , but keeps being romantic , inviting you to explore all the 788 pages ... not to mention the phone sex lines ads ... 
  gary johnson , interesting ... 
  we were n't even commies , but our suburbs ' blocks are awful as well . 
  could n't find names that are being * rescued * , instead , some names are changing and gaining popularity in its new form . 
  it 's the case of candela ( literally * candle * , from candelaria - * candlemass * , the christian holiday - ) , nora ( from leonora - * eleanor * - ) , and lola ( the nickname for those called dolores - literally the plural form of * pain * - ) . 
  all of them are girls ' names . 
  the same as you guys . 
  yeah , in eso and bachillerato . 
  in primary we were told some things but we focused in the autonomous community 's history . 
  it 's among all the courses , in madrid in the 00s . 
  mostly everything , but obviously more spanish-centered and/or euro-centered .
