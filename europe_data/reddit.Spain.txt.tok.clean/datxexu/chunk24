  - prehistory : from lucy to spanish archaeological sites - sumer , babylon and ancient egypt - greeks and romans - germanic invasion to rome , charlemagne , islamic expansion - how we kicked off muslims from spain and discovered america and its colonization - european empires - napoleon and american countries ' independence - nationalism in europe by 19th century and colonial powers - wwi , 1920s , 1929 crisis and wwii - cold war - european union , fall of berlin 's wall - world powers ' roles nowadays, 
  i heard from the two latter ones , beacuse of their old tv series . 
  depending of the area commuting can be from 5 min to 2 hours . 
  some regions lack of direct trains - even electrical trains , diesel is used instead - so it takes the double of time than in car . 
  despite this , trains usually arrive on time . 
  buses do n't make much competition among them , as some lines have been for them for decades . 
  the same goes for airlines , apart from * charter * companies which fly abroad . 
  for a long time , many highways/freeways/motorways have been built throughout spain . 
  as the travel itself by car is cheaper - apart from the car - and faster , public transport among cities is discouraged , along with the expensive high-speed trains . 
  public transport in cities vary from town to town . 
  the same reason why also greece and portugal did n't . 
  basically the media was focusing towards 2 new parties : podemos - spanish syriza - , and a bit less popular ciudadanos - liberal center-right - . 
  not a very good day for pigs , as in some of them are slaughtered that day . 
  * to every pig it comes his saint martin . 
  c-9 madrid 's * suburban * - runs by the mountains - train is [ cool ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klqwwch1lk0 ) . 
  [ zara natural liquorice ] ( http://fiestaycaramelos.es/3776/regaliz-zara-natural-100-ud.jpg ) ( not related to inditex ) usually sweets do n't have an associated brand , or they are in the boxes but we do n't pay too much attention . 
  few exceptions are haribo , miguela\u00f1ez , fini ... 
  southern madrid speaks like inhaling the * s * so much to turn it into a * jjjjj * , and the suburbs in general is like having a could n't - care-less attitude . 
  richer areas are more gramatically/phonetically correct , and more monotone at the same time they put more emotion to their speak rather than their body language . 
  i think [ * ga\u00f1anes * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riys74kgqfu ) - brute rural people - is closer to what he 's asking for . 
  they usually live in villages , and they mostly can not be understood easily . 
  most families there owns some land although in the later century people changed jobs or/and emigrated to cities , instead of farming . 
  edit : video is from a humour program , do n't take it too seriously, 
  naturist movement is mainly made of older people - most of them men - . 
  despite being legal and having a few nudist beaches by province , nudity is definitely not popular . 
  you can see topless women sometimes . 
  famous nudist beaches are in stiges ' , for instance . 
  [ trajan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trajan ) is a good candidate . 
  he had the maximum territorial extent of rome 's history . 
  well-appreciated in romania and the rest of the former empire . 
  ^ not ^ that ^ he 's ^ from ^ hispania ^ or ^ sth ... 
  which is ironic because it 's * utopia street ... *, 
  because every regime changed its lyrics . 
  when the democracy arrived , it was a sensitive moment to change it , and nowadays people complain every new lyrics because they do n't feel well represented there . 
  [ here you have them . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marcha_real ), 
  / r/tropico or / r/murica, 
  cheers !, 
   \u00a1 por [ insert name here ] !, 
  for [ insert name here ] !, 
  up , down , to the centre and insideeeeee !!!!, 
  the most popular one was written by [ dutch-speaking belgians ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlwsnazh32o ) , but we mostly know the song by [ this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vspthio8yqw ) . 
  i would also highlight the spanish republic 's anthem , * el himno de riego * - [ riego 's anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eotkh0sul5q ) - , as the official anthem had lyrics but not nowadays because of political sensivities . 
  we could say california without the economic success xd, 
  spanish as native kind of fluent in english looking for another language to study - french - which i studied a couple of years without much success - , german , russian or arabic - . 
  can guess to read iberian languages , italian and french . 
  so your surname is escobar , right ? 
  god bless you - i did n't know what you exactly were referring to - ... hope the situation improves there . 
  [ nope . 
  ] ( https://antitrustlair.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/european-union-christmas-tree5.jpg ), 
   and we should n't burn gay people alive . 
  should i read it * as it is * - literally - ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.abc.es/media/201210/12/cabra-manteca--644x362.jpg ) and [ this one should be muricanphotoshopped ^ tm ( leopard 2e ) ] ( https://rojoygualda.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/img_leopard2e_th_02.jpg?w=450&amp;h=291 ), 
  [ but along with this kind of feeling ] ( http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1508/3125/1600/jose-luis-lopez-vazquez-1.0.jpg ), 
  and welcomes the ambassadors and negotiate some shady deals for big companies abroad ... he 's more important than it seems , actually xd, 
  the head of state is the monarch . 
  he does n't have too much power , he just signs the approved laws in the parliament and is the chief of the spanish army , although in a more ceremonial way . 
  nope - but you can apply for scholarships and deductions - . 
  anyway , prices for a course can range from 500 $ to 2000 $ in a public university . 
  in some autonomous communities they are even charging for a-levels/baccaleurate and vet-like programmes . 
  we can always make la moncloa independent ... 
  more known than scientists or inventors . 
  we study them at school in a deeper level than novelists . 
  [ the spanish army 's museum ] ( http://www.museo.ejercito.es/en/unidades/madrid/ihycm/museos/ejercito/index.html?__locale=en ) is located in toledo ( 25 min in high-velocity train or 50 min by bus from madrid , it 's inside its public transport area ) , exactly in its [ alc\u00e1zar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alc%c3%a1zar_of_toledo ) . 
  then you also have in madrid the [ air museum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/museo_del_aire_\\ ( madrid \\ ) ) , although bad communications by public transport - bus stop in the middle of a freeway - . 
  [ the royal collections ' museum ] ( http://ep00.epimg.net/cultura/imagenes/2016/04/10/actualidad/1460294972_337529_1460309277_noticia_normal.jpg ) that does n't fit with the almudena cathedral upon it , nor the royal palace at one side , nor the madrid 's river slope . 
  meh , passing philosophy , engineering , maths , science , literature , history , military organisation , inspiring modern art , bringing mills , aqueducts that a few of them were running water up to the 20th century , the same with the roads . 
  however there 's the acculturation of indigenous peoples , as the following descendant countries did elsewhere . 
  spreading western civilization , not that important you know ... 
  in addition , in mainland spain eggs and legumes are always in the kitchen . 
  wine and some traditional pastry used to be . 
  good times when latin was the * lingua franca * ... 
   i may be biased though absolutely , public health system is on average better than private - only the elite hospitals can overtake - . 
  you only need private therapy or interventions in psycologists , opticians and dentists . 
  the worse thing is that actually there are traffic jams and stuff because of this , despite the salt . 
  a latent disaster would be earthquakes , as the african plate is pushing the eurasian plate - [ lisbon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1755_lisbon_earthquake ) , [ l'aquila ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_l%27aquila_earthquake ) , [ lorca ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_lorca_earthquake ) , [ amatrice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_central_italy_earthquake ) ... - . 
  the huge family of the alba house - [ the duke of alba ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duke_of_alba ) - has kept some castles and propieties for themselves . 
  60 's and 70 's people tell late 80 's and 90 's people : * get a f-cking job !, 
  * 60 's and 70 's people tell late 80 's and 90 's people : * we need someone with more experience ... * most of our generation -90 s - is skeptical about the economy , skeptical about religion , more tolerant with immigration as we grew up with them , so we 're more left-wing as a result . 
  disclaimer : all languages are cool and beautiful . 
  - spanish : some time in the future we will lack of sounds - andalusian spanish : the proof of my theory above - catalan : remove last vowel of any spanish word - basque : whyk thek usez thk k , tx tx , z so mutxz - portuguese and gallician : tight throat - italian : vowel time !, 
  aaaaaaa !, 
  eeeeeeeeeeeee !, 
  the syllable fades off after the first volume peak while in spain 's spanish it 's getting more and more volume and then cuts off . 
  - french : sexy - english : depends of the region ... closely to their stereotypes - polite british , redneck muricans ' ... - . 
  - arab : * / abda abda / * - germanic and slavic languages : vowels are under a curfew or something - romanian : they 're like angry - bulgarian and polish : wawowa like in dubstep , although it 's cute . 
  / r/epana invaded by portugese and dutch often , makes fun of poortugal, 
   stereotypical ^ tm have you been in one ? 
  as we mostly live in flats , there 's a reclutance when owning a pet , because you have to teach your pet when and where to pee and poo - in the street , in a paper ... - , take him/her for a walk - mostly in the case of dogs - ... those with a yard can avoid it . 
  there are more dogs , birds - mostly parakeets - and fish than cats , half of all homes has a pet . 
  business towards pets have been growing lately , although in most places you wo n't be allowed to bring your pet with you . 
  not religious , but have images of virgin mary . 
  spanish here , but it 's not an exclusive thing for czech people . 
  if you * czech * out some teachers in kindergarten , they can take advantage to apply makeup to boys and even kiss them . 
  ofc it 's not anything sexual - although some parents complained about it - . 
  they 're little kids . 
   the spanish that they speak there is so much different than the one spoken here , so it 's hard to watch the same things , since we usually refuse to watch something that is in `` latino '' , and i guess they refuse our spanish too . 
  the infamous youtube fights about the dub ... 
  anyway it 's just the slang and the verb person what it 's different ... but we can guess the vocabulary and understand each other , or speak in * neutral spanish * , which was in the first disney dubs , for example . 
   we watch their tutorials around the web , that 's something that i ca n't thank them enough .
