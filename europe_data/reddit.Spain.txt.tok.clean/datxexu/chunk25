  check out photos of spanish towns - especially canarian - and cuban towns and you wo n't find the difference , apart from a few details . 
  other countries closer to spain would be puerto rico , venezuela and argentina .

   my mexican mother is paler than most of the `` white/anglo '' people at my school , yet she talks about spain stealing `` our '' gold if a country did need to be its gold restored would be bolivia at least , although it 's known that spain and its following countries have taken very few of the precious metals reserves in latin america .
