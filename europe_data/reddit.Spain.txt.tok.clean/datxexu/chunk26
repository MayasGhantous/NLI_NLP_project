  ** special mentions : ** madrid is known to be a dense city , so there are several skyscrapers and towers , at first inspired in american cities , like in [ gran via ] ( http://cdn.traveler.es/uploads/images/thumbs/201520/gran_via_desde_callao_5065_570x.jpg ) , and later on the international style , represented by [ azca business district ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/azca ) and modern style .

  welcome to spain , where whites and blacks can be burnt by sun equally !, 
  ughhh ... it hurt !, 
  / s actually , if you want snow you can take the commuter train to the mountains ( like 6 $ the single ticket ) . 
  not that a joke , [ they had ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canary_islands_independence_movement ) their [ own * army * ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fuerzas_armadas_guanches ) edit : financed by argelia, 
  in madrid 's plaza mayor - main square - a christmas-themed market is held , where you can buy nativity scenes ' figures , christmas party stuff ... 
  the best of all ... without annoying snow !, 
  edit : typo, 
  i think it 's not very good anywhere . 
  there is a lot of competition among artists , and it 's very difficult to reach a label to let them publish your songs . 
  you may be luckier in uk or the netherlands to sign for a label , but the other countries usually focus in their local market . 
  have heard but not any opinions ... :(, 
  the burguer , the bread , lettuce , tomato , pickles , slice of cheese . 
  when i 'm out i like to try other burgers such as the fried egg one , with bacon ... 
  i love the sauces they pour over the burger . 
  heard we have : - celtiberian wicca - celtic neopaganism in galicia - guanche * cultural association * in the canary islands - germanic neopaganism - basque ? 
  - heard too of roman paganism . 
  anyway , it is very very minoritary - like 10 people by bullet point ? - . 
  i would even bet most people lean towards religion skepticism . 
  it 's more likely to be trapped by political sects in universities . 
  the mop . 
  depends of the place and your social circles . 
  if you go usually to * herrikotabernas * you might - can be sure - you 're a basque independentist . 
  [ and if you go southern ... ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/04/21/inenglish/1398080386_187566.html ) edit : link corrected, 
  to be honest , i 'm fairly proud of it . 
  most of the greek knowledge was recovered thanks to the islam intellectuals . 
  without them we would n't have aristotle , for instance . 
  the engineering - like the mills - , the science and the literature were in advantage and europeans took them to develop ourselves . 
  the cordoba caliphate was the first european country to have a military fleet - due to the vikings ' invasions - . 
  the emirate of granada was of the richest of the whole mediterranean . 
  ** about morroco ** i was writing the full history of spanish dominance in north africa , but i realised this was n't a good approach . 
  morrocans , in general , are considered poorer , especially where the spanish ruled - ifni , by the top south , rif , by the top north - . 
  morrocans were considered , above all , moors - with less rights than spanish christians , and lots of stereotypes , like the polygamy marriages , the pot smokers ... - . 
  lately we had a bit of morrocan inmigration , and some integrate better than others . 
  many people do n't understand why we have to let their women wear hijab , or not serving pork in a school dining room , or some people believe they are getting benefits from welfare state without collaborating with spanish economy . 
  then you mix it up with * mooselims are terrorists * mentality and ... 
  the relationship between spain and morroco is a convenience marriage at political level . 
  nationalists on both countries mention the other country in their political agendas . 
   the native jewish population of spain ( many and perhaps most sephardi jews were native born converts rather than migrants ) , always a barometer of tolerance , quite clearly preferred the christian north to the muslim south from the beginning of the 11th century . 
  quite the opposite in the first centuries . 
  it will be later on when christian kingdoms welcomed jews . 
  yes , jews and christians were restricted on rights , the ones the quran grants - private cult by paying more taxes - . 
  right now i 'm having 25\u00ba c. * with cold barefoot ... * conditioned air in public spaces must be under 21\u00ba in winter and up from 24 \u00bac in summer , to prevent from getting a cold or a pneumonia . 
  in madrid we speak like ... - hard inhalation in some / s / , like in * \u00c9l se ha ejcondido * instead of * escondido * - he has hidden himself - . 
  - [ ye\u00edsmo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ye%c3%adsmo ) , where the / ll / and the / y / happen to be pronounced the same . 
  - [ le\u00edsmo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/le%c3%adsmo ) , [ la\u00edsmo and lo\u00edsmo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lo%c3%adsmo ) , when the object pronouns are mistaken each other . 
  - some * cheli * vocabulary , especially among young people and young adults . 
  * tronco * - literally log , means pal , dude , ... - , * keli * - house - , * pe\u00f1a * - literally crag , means group of people - and the worldwide famous * t\u00edo * as dude - literally uncle - . 
  all spanish autonomous communities have one , although most of us does n't know them . 
  when i was playing geoguessr i mistook a spanish village for a italian one . 
  i would bet it would happen the same with portugal . 
  i loved c\u00e1diz , and now you can get directly to the centre by the new bridge . 
  other cities by its level would be tarragona , oviedo , burgos , zaragoza ... also ubeda and baeza , to see some andalusian towns . 
  if you want to relax by the countryside , extremadura has plains , mountains and dams near each other - recommended by spring - . 
  [ then we have this xd ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=paises+madrile%c3%b1os&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjarvhjuqrpahwdubqkhftfd8aq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=659#imgrc=_ ) i 'm aware it 's utopic anyway . 
  if you check out * castellanismo * , it 's pretty divided about the defintion of what is castille , not to mention it 's a * tiny * movement , linked to the far left which i do n't belong . 
  but if we ca n't have spain , we need to have anything else . 
  i do n't like being `` the serbia '' of the iberian peninsula . 
  * bilbainos are from where we want to , theregoesthehost patxi !, 
  * edit : it 's a sterotype sentence from the people from bilbao, 
  some autonomous communities ca n't finance themselves or launch large projects - extremadura , for instance - . 
  but if we do the `` take from madrid and northern , give it to the south '' then we have `` espanya ens roba '' and stuff . 
  that 's why i said getting a castille nation , to not bother others . 
  depends of . 
  we have very good business schools - like esade - . 
  other universities are said of being good - university of navarra - and hard - university of mondrag\u00f3n - . 
  and then we have the lesser quality ones - universidad europea de madrid/european university of madrid , alphonsus x the wise university , udima - . 
  usually public universities have more prestige in average , and private ones are said to be for * pijos * - posh , from wealthy families - . 
  sorry / u/rainymeadow  . <, 
  if you want an hypothesis , we thought we would always be `` the poor ones '' in eu . 
  fall of communism denied it , and the `` eu funds cake '' had to be distributed among more and more countries . 
  and then the housing bubble ... * gib feder gib monies plox *, 
  on behalf of the spanish armada , it 's not that we were n't aware of that . 
  we just had a bad substitute admiral . 
  forgot that one . 
  most of the stupid things are n't necessarily stupid themselves , the circumstances - and the geostrategy - were there to not letting do them . 
  i do prefer to be a peaceful and prosper country than * bringin ' galleons everywhere * . 
  rather than spanish nationalist i 'm castillian and iberian federalist one . 
  that 's the only solution to not getting any more struggle with nationalisms and different interests among regions . 
  getting our economies boosted for each regions ' interests . 
  may be xdddd, 
  spain is in the north of the strait of gibraltar , connecting europe and africa , and the mediterranean sea and the atlantic ocean . 
  any future invader would like to invade us to following operations in both continents . 
  morroco is reclaiming ceuta and melilla , and has a good army anyways , although spanish ' is technologically newer . 
  if we are n't fighting is because of the nato and financial interests . 
  spain historically wanted ( and wants ) back gibraltar , as you may have heard . 
  gibraltar and malta were british , and were objectives for the axis , especially germany for gibraltar and italy for malta . 
  as spain was ruled by the fascists , hitler and franco planned to siege gibraltar together . 
  as spanish army was decimated by the recent spanish civil war , franco told hitler to wait , and germany did so .
