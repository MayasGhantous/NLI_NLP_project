  but the time never came . 
  - not invading portugal properly - not invading the uk - not invading north america - not invading china - kings did n't listen to economists by the spanish empire - thinking we could kick usa on its ass by 1898 - leaving western sahara to morroco while betraying the locals and un - not allowing hitler to invade gibraltar - consenting having such bad kings as charles iv , ferdinand vii , elizabeth ii and alphonse xiii - consenting having coups d'etat every time - educating in a short term mentality - * talking to you building companies * - cutting up freedom of speech - * talking to you ley mordaza * - taking joke usa movements as serious - * talking to you sjw * - being so ideologically extreme to lead us to several civil wars - having such a little army for the place we live on earth - giving autonomy to regions that did n't need it - * not talking about catalonia * - thinking we could recieve money from eu forever and not making our industry competitive anyone who reads this may be think i 'm too nationalistic or something xd disclaimer edit : not country as the people , country as the institution . 
  i check the language first , then the physical complexion and his/her face . 
  i can tell apart * ethnic-cultural groups * , if we can use it , by using stereotypes . 
  * rule of thumb : * locals exaggerate the genetic * connections * with other ethnicities . 
  as an anecdote , i 'm very tanned and round-faced , and some people tell me i look indian or middle eastern - * along with the joking of `` what are you doin ' in palestine ? '', 
  while news of the middle east conflicts * - . 
  but those foreigners that i met tell i look spanish or south american . 
  spaniard here , what does dkg and dcl mean ? 
  i suppose dkg is dekagram -1 dag = 10g - and dcl decilitre -1 dl = 1/10 litres - here is : - mass : mg/grams/kg / * toneladas * ( tones , it is , 1000 kg ) - volume : ml/litres / * cubic hectometres * ( 1 hm ^ 3 = 1 billion litres = 1 million m ^ 3 ) - distance : mm/cm/m / km - areas : m ^ 2 / * hect\u00e1reas * ( hectares , it is , 1 ha = 1 hm ^ 2 = 100 m ^ 2 ) / km ^ 2 ** tl ; dr : ** you wo n't see dag nor dcl here edit : typo, 
  what i was asking is why you set apart the languages from my statement . 
  i do count the language heritage , if you 're referring to that . 
  what are you exactly referring to ? 
  [ this royal family badass . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/felipe_de_marichalar_y_borb%c3%b3n ) he has been in borading schools because of his shenaingans . 
  he is in the top of the madrid 's young jet-set , he was a pr of a famous madrid 's club , he has been doing dangerous hunts with his grandpa the king , he had some girlfriends ... and he supports podemos !!, 
  althrough he has its own * sarcastic * party . 
  actually , he 's the 5th in the sucession line . 
  spanish omelette plz, 
  that we are andalusia , and we still think like in `` tales of the alhambra '' of washington irving . 
  and sometimes - especially angry south americans - it is said we are moors . 
  the iberian ethnic background is mostly made up of indigenous genes - iberos and celts - . 
  d'you know cinco de mayo ? 
  * just trollin ' *, 
  as we are n't physiotherapists , we usually do n't . 
  i would say we - at least i , but i do n't mind giving or receiving massage to/from friends - get unconfortable with the * consequences * ... all the almost-sex moaning we are only able to express . 
  you can * breath * history anywhere you go . 
  from the indigenous peoples to nowadays , we preserved few of the things left by every ethnicity or civilization in contact with ours . 
  spanish history lessons cover the columbus explorations , the cortes and pizarro conquests , the organization of the colonies and the independence wars of the colonies . 
  i would say it gave more suffering to the country the spanish-american war - cuba independence - than the other ones , because it 's like we could n't accept it for a very long time . 
  the truth is that colonialism is n't very good for the prestige of a country . 
  the infamous * previas ... * in spain it 's the same ... or was . 
  lately people - especially women - do n't go to clubs for hooking up ... just use tinder or something . 
  apologises for the misunderstanding , i truly wanted to see your arguments to link the two statements . 
  here in europe is the other way round , you focus on science , engineering , social sciences , humanities , arts ... in a global view just for the knowledge branch you choose . 
  ** civilised ** , hot blondes ... and the polandball circlejerk of finnish depression and suicide . 
   20th century communism & fascism ( one semester )   civics ( one semester )   drama   stock market analytics   ... --  specialization , prior to the renaissance , was a symbol of someone who had to work and was not a free member of society . 
  errr ... well , in mi 2nd and last year of baccalaureate - like british a-levels - in its almost technological itinerary . 
  this is due to the fact i did n't study technical drawing and chose it and psychology instead . 
  - spanish ( literally , spanish language and literature ) - english - maths - physics - history of spain - history of philosophy - industrial technology - psychology, 
  [ a present !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilg_04jslqk ) i 'm ashamed it has n't got subtitles . 
   kids use a `` light '' version of these things love the old comics ' ones ... like * \u00a1 rec\u00f3rcholis !, 
  * what i find amusing is when curses become kind words , like * maric\u00f3n * - faggot - or * hijo de puta * - motherfucker , literally son of a bitch - . 
  - 2 euro : 1 germany , 1 france - 1 euro : 3 spain , 1 portugal - 50 cent : 1 spain - 20 cent : 1 spain , 1 portugal - 10 cent : 1 spain , 1 france * special mention * : i have 10 bani ( 0.10 leu ) from romania , like 2 euro cents . 
  when conscripting was enforced - until 2001 - , it was - and still is - seen to * man up * the young men . 
  before getting stationed , people in villages celebrated * los quintos * - the draftees - and did some sorts of traditions depending of the place - i think they still do it - . 
  it is kindly named * la mili * , from * military service * . 
  in there you could have the best times of your life or the worst , depending on the colleagues and the officials you had . 
  by the 80s and 90s you could take conscientious objection and do something else in ngo 's , such as the spanish red cross . 
  spanish army is seen very different depending on who you ask . 
  for some people , the nowadays army is the same as franco 's , like a conservative lobby , with [ some ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/11/04/inenglish/1446648712_679491.html ) exceptions . 
  other people do n't support that spain is in the nato - a very significant minority - . 
  there are fairier opinions not caring or supporting the army - the majority - , and those - a minority - who say that spain needs even a bigger army . 
  most people would care first of the welfare state way before the army anyway . 
  edit : typo, 
  i wonder if santa justa klan were popular abroad too ... 
  * troll detected *, 
  last internship was from 9:30 to 18:30 . 
  other people just do 8-9 :00 to 17-20 :00 , or 8:00 to 14-15 :00 or 15:00 to 20-21 :00 . 
  not to forget [ los fruittis ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/los_fruittis ) and other antoni d'ocon series . 
  some literary stories were adapted to cartoons , like marcelino pan y vino ( 2001 ) and the [ don quixote \\ ( 1979 \\ ) cartoons ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4tfzd13hmc ) . 
  edit : `` tocar los cojones '' - touching balls - is our balls breaking . 
  yeah we have bufallo grill here too . 
  with the same design for all the restaurants . 
  - [ foster 's hollywood ] ( https://fostershollywood.com/ ) : similar to planet hollywood . 
  they have burgers , bbq steaks , onion rings - ny times said one of the world 's best - , philadelphia sandwiches , and so on . 
  - [ hard rock caf\u00e9 ] ( http://www.hardrock.com/ ) - [ tommy mel 's ] ( http://www.tommymels.com/press/2/tommy-mel%e2%80%99s-%e2%80%93-50s-american-style-diner.html ) : decorated with 50 's style . 
  several american and foreign amercian-adopted food . 
  - [ ribs ] ( http://www.ribs.es/en/ ) : focused on american bbq . 
  rustic design , like western . 
  - and mcdonalds , bk , kfc ... - actually we have taco bell , but it 's decorated with [ california design ] ( http://www.oficinaempleo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/taco-bell-interior-fb.jpg ) , not mexican 's . 
  have to ask : what is * conversation * for you ? 
  i mean , what situations you are refering to ? 
  was taught cursive , but then switched to `` printed '' , and at the end i do a strange mix of cursive a 's and mix the cursive and printed s ' and r 's depending of the writing velocity . 
  l 's , i 's , q 's and some d 's and b 's are written `` print '' . 
  pretty much everyone writes something in between , varying from person to person to one extreme or another . 
  in spain the public health system is funded by the autonomous communities , so its quality may vary . 
  you have to join in social security - the same institution that grants unemployment benefits - , although universal healthcare is recognised . 
  usually private healthcare is worse than the public system , with very few exceptions . 
  this may be required for some of dental work , psycologists and opticians . 
  when you say * por no ... * ( in order not to ... / by any ... ) or * pen\u00e9lope * 's nickname ... 
   peneeeee !!!, 
  was looking for this . 
  it is a * fact * that building is not equal to development . 
  it may be in a developing country but not here in europe . 
  spaniards have been in the same error by 50 years and have n't corrected ourselves . 
  yes , we have cool flats - more than a million empty houses - , cool skyscrapers , cool roads - the 3rd largest world 's - , cool oversized metro/tramway/light rail , cool railroads for expensive high-speed trains -60 $ a ticket - ... 
  here i stop myself , you guys know the rest . 
  part of it was brought by public european development funds . 
   \u00a1 housing never drop prices !, 
  10 years later :  gib monies plox, 
  with a job beforehand xd, 
  this is just fair freedom of trade . 
  you may remember us gave francoist spain some uranium and reactors anyway under the atoms for peace programme . 
  i mean , china is already ruling some clay ... at least uk have a few nukes . 
  just in economic terms ... city | purchasing power parity compared to ny = 100 -- | -- luxembourg | 134.3 zurich | 130.5 geneva | 127.5 [ source ] ( http://www.statista.com/statistics/262825/worldwide-gross-wage-index/ ) in my personal opinion , i think i can adapt anywhere . 
  like , you can make international friends almost in any big city . 
  i would prefer in that case to have a mild weather ... the canary islands would be a good option . 
   the spanish do the same thing i think .
