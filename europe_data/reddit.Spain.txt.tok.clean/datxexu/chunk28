  spanish , can confirm . 
   * \u00a1 por portugal !, 
  * edit : and the * arriba , abajo , al centro y pa ' dentrooooo *, 
  - * blanco y en botella , ( leche ) * - white and in a bottle , ( milk ) - when something is obvious . 
  - * al pan , pan y al vino , vino * - bread is bread and wine is wine - things are as they * actually * are , you do n't need to * beat around the bush * . 
  - * mejor solo que mal acompa\u00f1ado * - better alone than poorly accompanied - it is better to be alone than to be with the wrong person - * de tal palo , tal astilla * - from such a stick , such a splinter . - the way a child behaves is a reflection of the way his or her parents behave . 
  - * a quien madruga , dios le ayuda * - who rises early , god helps - it 's good to wake up early . 
  - * m\u00e1s vale ma\u00f1a que fuerza * - it 's better skill than force - intelligence can achieve more than strength . 
  - not so common , * quien con ni\u00f1os se acuesta , mojado se levanta * - who sleeps with children , gets up wet - although it sounds weird , it just means that you must be aware of those you know you ca n't trust and can give you problems , such as kids , pets or criminals . 
  similar to * if you lie down with dogs you 'll get up with fleas * . 
  * - the richer is n't who the most has , but who the least needs . 
  a similar one in spanish is `` quien no llora , no mama '' - who does n't cry , does n't suckle - . 
  * ... no pun intended *, 
  already mentioned , but yes , queen letizia was not only a commoner , [ but a republican ] ( http://europe.newsweek.com/spains-queen-letizia-divorcee-war-reporter-tv-journalist-republican-271035?rm=eu ) . 
  here the name is backwards : aquabona . 
  had fame of tap water and changed it for spring water . 
  it is , or taking the ferry to england , and then take the ireland 's there . 
  as we do n't have ferry lines connecting us directly , i have to ask how 's that we can reach there ... 
  veiculo longos and polish . 
  very very few of other countries ... maybe french or belgian . 
  ~ ~ uk ~ ~ and russia . 
  actually we have the opposite , although not necessarily a childhood speech impediment . 
  instead of saying * la moto * , * la radio * , * la foto * , some people feel the need to extend the vowel / a / and ii turns into * la amoto * , * la arradio * , * la afoto * . 
  and ethnic germanic invasions . 
  i think we were more alike in the past than in the present . 
  nowadays they have a high-tech industry , and chuck norris . 
  you wo n't believe how spaniards say your mass media stars ' names - disgracefully including me - . 
  * i 'd better keep it as a clickbait *, 
  here , better not to tell your parents you 're going to ibiza with your friends . 
  if you are basque , do n't tell you are going to salou . 
  if you are rich , benidorm . 
  if you are prosecuted for selling drugs , firearms and whores to eastern europe mafias , marbella . 
  if you are prosecuted for selling drugs , firearms and whores to italian mafias , catalonia . 
  if you have family conflicts or events , caribbean sea . 
  if you do n't want your parents to be worried for your safety and health , africa . 
  and so on . 
  mmm ... there is n't that stereotype . 
  the richest areas , therefore the most desirable to live , are : - madrid metropolitan area - western madrid : pozuelo de alarc\u00f3n , las rozas , boadilla , majadahonda , ... - northern madrid : la moraleja , in the town of alcobendas - central madrid : salamanca district , castellana promenade - barcelona : pedralbes , l'eixample , sarri\u00e1 ... - marbella - ibiza - as a rule of thumb , any city centre/downtown - if in southern spain , get a `` parcela '' - plot - . 
  edit : or a * cortijo *, 
  / r/spain i do n't read it much , they focus on certain things like how to get by or what to see or woo in * random spanish place name/company * , i do n't have * any * idea of most stuff submitted . 
  the other topics are some other news and you can break reddit 's servers if you start a politics ' thread . 
  * you 're warned guys * . 
  i think they need a big wiki to guide people . 
  / r/es they submit news and nothing else / r/epana is our / r/murica sub i find much more interesting this sub , as you can ask for broader topics and learn how other countries live or think . 
   well congrats to mostar and the spanish then . 
  thank you . 
   but no croat will forget the unprofor `` peace areas '' and the opposition the un gave when croatia started to liberate it 's lost lands . 
  ca n't tell anything as i 'm not an expert in the war - i did n't live it , neither by place nor age - . 
  did n't want to start a geopolitics discussion here , i know nobody 's * completely good or bad * , it 's even more difficult to guess when there were lots of factions , like in the whole yugoslavia 's war . 
   i 'm interested to see why `` half the spanish army near mostar and sarajevo '' could n't lift either of the sieges of the cities with sarajevo one lasting 4 fin years there was a misunderstanding . 
  half of spanish army was there * along 20 years * , not at the same time . 
  and we shared area with france , germany and italy . 
  the siege of sarajevo was much more complicated , and the bases were built later . 
  we say both, 
  i 'm aware one ex-minister of us ordered the bombing of belgrade and other serbian positions to nato , and we brought a pair of f-18s . 
  actually , my father has been in the spanish base of mostar , bosnia , for un . 
  almost half of the spanish army has been in yugoslavia , either near sarajevo or mostar . 
  it was exclusively a peace enforcing mission , regardless of the faction . 
  after the war we helped to rebuild mostar , served several humanitarian programmes , and the main square changed its name to `` spanish square '' . 
  nato , eufor and/or un would try to mediate between the two or support one . 
  something like in yugoslavia . 
  edit : would be spread ? 
  nope . 
  wow ... from what i 've heard we call jesus to scare away the devil ... how fortunate you are guys . 
  i was taught but i forgot it as we are n't writing poems or books xd in spanish we do n't have such rules , with exceptions . 
  saying * viejo amigo * you mean a long-term friend , while * amigo viejo * means literally old friend , among others . 
  - q , k or ke = que/qu \u00e9 ( pronoun/conjuntion , depending of the sentence can mean what , that ... ) - tb = tambi\u00e9n ( adverb , meaning also , too ... ) - x = por ( preposition , as x is to multiply and 6 times 3 is * 6 por 3 * ) - xq = porque/por qu\u00e9 ( beacuse/why ) - bb = beb\u00e9 ( baby , usually in a romantic context ) - ctm = concha tu madre ( your mother 's p-ssy , common among south americans ) - hdp = hijo de puta ( son of a b-tch , motherf-cker ) - kk = caca ( poop ) - tqm/tkm = te quiero mucho ( i love you so much ) in the sms era there was a lot more , but now we have spelling checkers so it 's not so necessary . 
  some english acronyms got popular , such as lol , gtfo , milf ... 
  did n't expect the spanish inquisition, 
  - loving * jam\u00f3n ... * - being outgoing and party-loving, 
  i heard the two latter ones are directly * trafficking supermarkets . 
  * [ a present . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaaiqsxhrq0 ), 
  mmm from i have heard it 's just the fame in the past ... 
  i would n't say it 's dangerous anymore . 
  [ wait wait ... 
  i have n't finished yet !, 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/11696961/drug-traffickers-unload-boat-on-spanish-beach.html ) edit : some gypsies have houses in madrid 's mountains . 
  the closest i can think of are `` famous '' bad neighbourhoods , although we do n't use them to compare . 
  - [ vallecas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vallecas ) , in madrid . 
  - [ las 3000 viviendas ( the 3000 houses ) ] ( http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=d79_1377785340 ) , in seville . 
  you can find any * bad ` hood * in almost every city of spain . 
  special edit mention : [ la ca\u00f1ada real , the biggest shanty town in europe . 
  ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2012/02/07/inenglish/1328627886_929407.html ) hillbillies do exist , but we do n't have generic names for the villages they live in . 
  spanish coffee is not very good , at least compared with ** true ** portuguese * torrefacto * or your expressos . 
  it is known that some `` italian '' olive oil is spanish oil , so i would n't take for granted ... 
  the problem with spanish cuisine is that it 's based on heavy food - harder to digest - while it lacks of aroma - like spices - , and pastry is too based on flavour . 
  actually we invented ponzi scheme - could n't find english sources , but if you can understand spanish you can search for baldomera larra , prosecuted by 1879 - . 
  [ here are some examples of scams . 
  forgot the [ sudarium of oviedo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sudarium_of_oviedo ), 
  actually , in madrid metro 's stairs , people goes up on the left and stays in the right . 
  which south ? 
  [ silvio approves ] ( http://www.eldiario24.com/d24ar/fotos/uploads/editorial/2011/01/22/imagenes/5434_silvio-berlusconi-brindando.jpg ), 
  grandson of military posted in western sahara here . 
  in western sahara locals and spaniards were isolated from each other , we did n't care of them despite being citizens . 
  my father engaged with other spaniards ' kids , and he could n't met any local . 
  we realised later all the phosphates ' thing and morroco took adavantage of franco 's illness . 
  * conclusion : there were - and are - more problems when ruling w. sahara than now * . 
  as in spanish guinea there were more rainforest , we took more resources from them , although they left earlier . 
  * why did n't we took their oil ... *,
