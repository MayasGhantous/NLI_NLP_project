  you can find several road underpasses and tunnels in spain .

  in spanish you can search for `` pasadizo ( s ) subterr\u00e1neo ( s ) '' - usually pedrestian ones - , `` paso ( s ) subterr\u00e1neo ( s ) '' - usually for cars - , `` t\u00fanel ( es ) '' - tunnels - .

  what we celebrate is all saints ' day . 
  some people go to the cemeteries to pray for the souls of their beloved ones .

  if i find he/she struggles too much , i let him/her speak english . 
  here it 's a bit more complicated . 
  to be self-employed - you 're not allowed to hire anyone else , and you respond personally to the business ' debts - you just need to register on the social security as one . 
  when registering other kinds of companies , you are required more things such as minimum capital - for a normal limited society , 3000 $ - , minimum number of shareholders , and register on several official registries . 
  nationalities vary , right , ... 
  i was just stereotyping , as they do n't really care of their nationality - anyone from eastern europe may be called there * russian * - . 
  apologises if that offended you , as the real criticism was towards the spanish people i 'm complaining of , not the prostitutes - regardless of their nationality - .

  from what i have seen , you can do the way you want . 
  there 's a name gap , 1st surname gap and a 2nd . 
  you are not enforced to use spanish onomastics . 
  eastern europe people just fill the name and the 1st surname , portuguese and ecuadorian people respects the way that the mother 's surname goes first , and so on .

  teacher 's salaries vary depending on the autonomus community where they teach and the extra bonuses they are given by career time or position in school 's hierarchy . 
  salaries range from 1800 to 2600 $ - public high school - . 
  university professor ' range from 10000 to 30000 $ , plus extras . 
  the treatment depends mainly on the workplace . 
  a high school teacher in a poor neighbourhood has to put up with a lot more problems - with students and their parents - than a primary school teacher in the same area or a university professor . 
  edit : typo, 
   the 18000 figure given by op is probably the amount of kids ( out of those 35000 ) that are living in institutions ( not in some kind of foster care ) . 
  this . 
  there are * 18.000 orphans , and 33.000 families wanting to adopt * , but the government does n't care of them . 
  the government gives 300 $ as orphan pension after 18 to them - those never adopted - . 
  some orphanages are held by the catholic church - mainly by nuns - and others are state-owned . 
  article 1 1 . 
  spain is hereby established as a social and democratic state , subject to the rule of law , which advocates as the highest values of its legal order , liberty , justice , equality and political pluralism . 
  national sovereignty is vested in the spanish people , from whom emanate the powers of the state . 
  the political form of the spanish state is that of a parliamentary monarchy .

  miss spain used to be more popular than nowadays - recently it was bankrupt - . 
  some of the winners appear in gossip magazines or tv programs . 
  spaniards , mostly those near the border with portugal , used to go to buy towels in portugal because they were cheaper - they still are - . 
  the deal with the portuguese towels is that most of them could n't dry . 
  you can break a towel by cutting it !, 
  your theory lacks of jews behind * everything * . 
  a spaniard buys a towel in portugal , but it broke so he went back to the shop to get a refund . 
  they give all the money they had , as the price was the country 's gdp . 
  a nationalist movement grows in portugal to payback the spaniard guy , and portugal moves troops through west spain . 
  spain launches the state of war and fights back with blood sausages as clubs . 
  as everyone is unemployed they join the army and have training in swearing that motherf-cking poortugal . 
  portugal launches codfish cluster bombs to the enemy line . 
  spain calls out un to denounce portugal is launching nbq weapons due to the smell . 
  at the security council of un , sanctions to portugal are not enforced because uk 's guy were called `` prawn '' in a trip to valencia . 
  us , canada and israel helps portugal because trump realised spain had more oil than portugal and wanted to enslave the melilla 's wall bricklayers to bring them to the mexico border . 
  russia , north korea , cuba and venezuela moves troops to the former countries , * because yes * . 
  the rest of the european union were tricked by russia , and the african union helps spain because some politicians bought mercenaries by a gibraltar company , with the help of china . 
  middle east countries send isis to eastern europe to help usa , but putin comes out from nowhere to kill them all and defeated them . 
  sweden and germany calls spanish refugees `` rapefugees '' because they organised a botell\u00f3n and danced some pasodobles with the local girls , and join portugal side . 
  japan and asean joins spanish side because of * paella * , a rice dish that has to be preserved , although portugal wanted to appeal them with their rice with codfish .

  as you go further on level , you find worse teachers . 
  i mean , few of them * actually * loves teaching and shows interest on their pupils . 
  concerning to teachers : * teachers in primary/junior school are n't very good on maths , but they teach it . 
  * secondary/high school teachers did a degree on something - spanish , philosophy , maths , ... - so if they do n't find a job in their field they become teachers . 
  well , many of them set the teaching career path from the beginning , but others do n't and end up to schools . 
  i find english teachers were the most involved ones in my opinion .
