  / r/wholesomepolandball, 
   you see , we hate our country so fiercely that we are the only ones allowed to criticize it this happens with every country . 
  lacks trap music videos but pretty accurate shitpost, 
  one thing is latin american countries ' nationalism and/or indigenism , and another the general feeling about it . 
  this is like straight out from rt or something,

  in spain they 're pretty popular to eat them almost anywhere and anytime . 
  i think i 'm the only spaniard that finds shelling out them a hassle . 
  let 's be honest , [ portugal had it easier . 
  reichsburger king , where you 're the f\u00fchrer !, 
  gypsy/roma romanians - and local gypsies as well - can worry , but non-gypsies do n't need to . 
  they 're - you 're ? - pretty well integrated . 
  / r/gimp, 
  and basque as well, 
  we were pretty romantic on the other side of the pond back then, 
  wonderful towels too . 
  nice city !, 
  italy you can do it !!, 
  reverse climate change in that place next to venice !!!, 
  nah , spain it 's going to have its own caliphate !, 
  with philosophers and a navy to fight vikings !, 
  paywall , can someone post the text please ? 
  i 'll give a revolutionary hypothesis : stressful jobs . 
  you may find catholicism in spain pretty secular ; or even polytheistic for the eyes of a muslim or a jew due to marianism . 
  the folklore is much more important for the people than having a strict catholic lifestyle . 
  apart from the fact that there are n't huuuuge differences in religiosity among regions . 
  traditionally , andalusia and the basque country have been the most religious regions in spain . 
  this is like the portuguese blue whale challenge ?

  [ do n't you really think so ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_siberia ), 
   looking at this map makes me wonder how our country would have been if we had not lost badajoz , caceres and the surrounding provinces in 1169 . 
  i find this funny because extreme\u00f1os are probably who are the most `` xenophobe '' and joke on portugal the most - neighbour bantz i guess - . 
  on the other hand , r/historywhatif /, 
   hot women yeah we 're literally hot xd, 
  ok , of course i know which one is each . 
  but the differences are subtle , it 's not that both styles are mutually exclusive . 
  i see white fa\u00e7ades and blue sky . 
  fun fact : madrid is the city with the highest number of trees in europe - although most of them are in the outskirts - . 
  in fact , back in the 16th century , madrid was praised for its natural surroundings , like a village . 
  on the other hand , the former city government was almost fined for pollution levels , and this year the actual one enforced some more extreme measures like turns for allowed driving by odd/even plates . 
  i hope this `` vertical gardens '' are a thing all over the city , and also we 'll need more shadow for some areas as well , especially in the suburbs . 
  every day , all day bonsais, 
  * \u00a1 guerra !, 
  no wonder why australia joined eurovision !, 
  serious edit : i wondered it as well, 
  we already had [ infrastructures of europe ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/search?q=bridges+of+europe&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ) , that it was mainly bridges . 
  but not too late to start the trend anyway . 
  it roughly means '' [ before the main dish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antipasto ) '' . 
  did n't alexandre dumas say that it started on the pyrenees ? 
  as long as the `` revolution '' is upon the filthy capitalists , it will mantain the symbolism ??? 
  edit : oh wait , i wanted to say it 's `` above '' but i do agree with the actual statement as well ... 
  so this is n't ironic ... thank you , sorry if i seemed arrogant , that was a genuine question . 
  ok , my question is : why ? 
  background ? 
  is this satirical or not or how ? 
  * orange regions get thousands of upvotes , how many for our boys in blue ?

   solution : become atheists , that 's what my parents did . 
  but did your parents just drop out their faith after they met or were they already atheists ? 
  edit : corrected the question, 
  spanish senate does n't hold sessions anymore in the old * sal\u00f3n de sesiones * - sessions ' hall - that appears in the spanish senate 's photo . 
  nowadays they 're in a [ modern hall ] ( http://www.senado.es/web/wcm/idc/groups/public/@cta_imagenes/documents/document/mdaw/mde3/~edisp/destacadohemiciclo.jpg ) since 1991 . 
  it 's noteworthy the art and the elements that refer to the history of spanish parliamentarism . 
  spain is next to the african plate , so we are n't safe from earthquakes - technically , nobody is - . 
  in madrid itself there has been several scale 4 ones this last decade . 
  fun fact : there 's a small collection of some picasso 's works in this town . 
  have to go some day , fortunately there 's a bus line from madrid . 
  do n't let medina del campo hear you !, 
  in the eso i had the chance to read some foreign books , but they were n't `` hard classics '' , but something along the lines of [ letter to the king ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de_brief_voor_de_koning ) or the treasure island . 
  then there were 80 somethings-page summaries of english classics in english , such as the picture of dorian gray or the strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde - i think i read the original but i 'm not sure - .

  ( which was n't really dedicated to the goddess but the imperial cult ), 
  we have it as well . 
  rinse and repeat with all the cities and provinces that added their names to the memes . 
  this is what happened in spain as well . 
  as local trees grow way more slower than eucalyptus and pines , the latter ones were used to reforest back in the 19th and 20th century . 
  this is the worst part , the * bochorno * . 
   nothing personal , guys , it 's just that the heat wave is not leaving until next week , we need some lebensraum pronto .
