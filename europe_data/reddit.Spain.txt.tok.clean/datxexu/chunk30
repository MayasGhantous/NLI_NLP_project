  * if a teacher is bad , you have to ask for an inspector that comes to class to check it , * in front of the teacher * . 
  so he/she suddenly improves his/her classes and `` everything 's right '' . 
  * college teachers share the same defects with their school counterparts . 
  they do n't update their knowledge . 
  when i saw some * basic * errors from them , i just wanted to get them expelled and not being paid with my taxes . 
  my sister had to study a master 's degree because of this . 
  * vocational schools are on the same * system * along with high school teachers . 
  they make a little more effort in updating , but they should improve much more as well . 
  other factors : * as some people have already told here , the level is up to the lowest achievers . 
  here in spain we evaluate from 0 to 10 , 5/10 as pass , while in most countries is 6/10 . 
  * in every autonomous community - region - , there 's a different curricula . 
  so you can study way much better in cantabria than in andalusia . 
  consequences : * 23.5 % of dropouts from school by 2014 , the highest of all europe . 
  * students * vomit * the information , instead of * actually understanding it * . 
  that 's how there 's a 80 % of dropouts in some engineering degrees , and loads of people joining journalism . 
  * not any spanish university in the top rankings . 
  * but very good business schools . 
  * disclaimer : i respect all studies and careers , but some people are following a path based on what they want to avoid , instead of want they really want to study . 
  it 's said that yours ca n't dry . 
  maybe the joke comes from there . 
  and i heard that you buy sweets in spain . 
  [ the true reason ( spanish source ) ] ( http://www.abc.es/20120423/archivo/abci-ancho-espanol-201204231243.html ) is due to the mountainous terrain , often dealt with in spain . 
  when engineers realised that having a wider gauge was not the solution to cross by the mountains , [ they developed a metric gauge , mainly built in the cantabric range . 
  you 're right - i just do n't find google translate reliable and wanted to confirm, 
  [ in an image ] ( http://barcelona.lecool.com/files/2012/06/urbarna31.jpg ), 
  here in spain the hip-hop scene was huge in the 00s , but lately it switched to reggaeton - yes they rap - , edm - now trap music as rap bases are the trend , although it is n't known as very good music - and * indie music * . 
  the guardia civil used to check inside cars to find smuggling goods such as tobacco or alcohol - talking about spain-portugal border - . 
  after schengen , customs were removed . 
  to her majesty 's land of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland . 
  i 'm too tired to learn another language other than english , and malta is too small for me . 
  i have been taught - briefly - the following topics : * aztec , mayan and inca civilizations * conquest of america - by spaniards , does n't cover other colonizations - * american revolution and latin american independence wars ( 1810-1840 ) * spanish-american war ( 1898 ) * and its consequences , some of them remaining to nowadays . 
  * * great depression , wwii , cold war, 
  he is . 
  not that divisive , though . 
  the problem is that franco governed for 38 years . 
  two generations under his rule , and two views of how the people were affected . 
  those who love franco thanked the economic growth in spain from the very late 50s to the 1973 oil crisis , along with * saving spain from being a ussr satellite country * . 
  those who hate them complained about how spain went more conservative , supported the axis , spanish republic 's measures were stopped , civil rights were removed , and the prosecution of the regime 's opposition , and he should have been charged with crimes against humanity . 
  had to say that gypsies in spain had been here for 700 years and they 're still outsiders in our society . 
  [ an example . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_gypsy_round-up ), 
  spaniard here but i do n't mind , as other spaniards answered . 
  i did n't want to join the discussion beacuse every time catalonia 's independence is held , some independentists come and say `` we are a nation f-ck you spain blahblah '' . 
  most spaniards are ** bored and tired ** of independentists , at least let us be glorious castille , dammit . 
  i do find canarian spanish really difficult to imitate though , because of what you said , i see myself like a venezuelan or cuban person . 
  spain 's flag is made by the same colors of arag\u00f3n 's crown kingdoms ' flags - aragon , catalonia , valencia and majorca - , * the senyera * . 
  as the former flag had a white background and it was common among other europe 's flags , charles iii chose this design in a contest held in 1785 . 
  not at all . 
  the reality is that france , portugal and spain are 1 hour away from gmt , * thanks to franco and vichy * . 
  [ wikipedia section with maps describing the delay from its original time throughout europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greenwich_mean_time#discrepancies_between_legal_gmt_and_geographical_gmt ) [ article from el pa\u00eds ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/03/28/inenglish/1459165488_731020.html ) edit : it was gmt, 
  i would say it 's just a spanish thing , we are educated to be modest and generous at the same time . 
  between 2 to 5 times they 'll insist to offer something . 
  exceeded that number , the social pressure dissappears . 
  so you ca n't really make sure if he/she were sincere or not . 
  edit : happened to struggle with this with other * near * nationalities , and other spaniards too . 
   i have to say though that italian jokes mainly `` offend '' italians themselves , in these jokes there are usually 3 people : 1 italian and 1 french and 1 german , or english , it depends . 
  usually the german and the french are the smart ones , while the italian is always the stupid . 
  the same in spain . 
  not too many jokes about other countries , but criticise ourselves . 
  we see ourselves as rude , thug and thick . 
  another thing would be openly racist jokes - featuring gypsies , people of colour , moors ... 
  bonus : an infinite song :  a german girl was giving me a h-ndjob  on my sister 's bed  as she noticed that i could n't c-m  they went to call another german girl !, 
   two german girls ... 
  was going to say this . 
  i ca n't find a single example of a common , but european-exclusive cultural element . 
  and russia is culturally european , despite being shared by 2 continents , and the exceptions of native asian russians and stuff . 
  i mainly listen to european djs , so you can guess ... 
  mainly dutch - armin van buuren , don diablo ... and a lot more - , british - calvin harris , gorgon city , etc. 
  i love british r&b singers , who usually feature their songs - , swedish - the former swedish house mafia , galantis ... - , french , german and a couple of russians and italians . 
   spain ? 
  [ you know . 
  well , in the past . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:terrorism_in_spain ) as you may be referring to the recent attacks in france , belgium and germany , they just have more foreign population than other european countries - those not integrated - , especially eastern europe - apart from the balkans - , and the mediterranean countries . 
  edit : pointing out, 
  whatsapp , fb messenger and telegram , by order . 
  waking up at 6:45 , change clothes , by 7:00 having breakfast - a glass of juice , a glass of milk and a couple of french toasts . 
  leaving by 7:35 to take public transport and i arrive at 8:15 to technical school . 
   we still appreciate the points you give us on eurovision though . 
  the same to you !, 
  being in a peninsula located in a corner it 's not really good for a contest when the neighbor countries vote each other . 
   germans : you are not entitled to anything extra . 
  you are exactly as important as all the other people . 
  a little politeness would n't kill you . 
  oh , and if you ask for your audio guide in japanase , even after i ask you if you 're serious , you do n't get to complain 10 minutes later that i gave you a japanese audio guide . 
  other spaniards . 
  * portugal i 'm looking to you *, 
   it is better to speak a language the other person might not understand but correctly rather than making a mistake in a language the other person understands . 
  we believe we offend you more by speaking your language incorrectly than by speaking to you in french . 
  the same here in spain . 
  but here , instead of getting disappointed , we make fun of the speaker - welcome to the land of the envy , when people laugh to the other 's failures and criticise their success at the same time - . 
  so when tourists happen to turn up to locals , suddenly we turn shy when speaking other languages , [ and this is the result ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/conversation-english-eurobarometer.jpg ) . 
  here we have a chain called `` foster 's hollywood '' , similar to planet hollywood - they feature hollywood stuff as well , like posters and old photos , although the furniture is different - . 
  it 's said to have one of the world 's best onion rings . 
  other places would be hard rock caf\u00e9 for instance . 
  but anywhere i go , i usually try their burgers , i 'm in a quest to find the best one in my city . 
  why nobody said [ dodgeball ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dodgeball ) ? 
  apart from [ football/soccer i guess ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/throw-in ) . 
  `` donde tengas la olla , no metas la polla '' * where you have the cooking pot , do n't put the d-ck * = do n't mix work with sex and love , e.g. 
  going out with a coworker . 
  '' . . m\u00e1s puta que las gallinas ( , que aprendieron a nadar para follarse a los patos ) '' * ... sluttier than the hens ( , that learned to swim to f-ck the ducks ) * '' ( algo es como ) el co\u00f1o de la bernarda '' * ( something is like ) the bernarda 's cunt * = something confusing or where everyone takes advantage of - in a pejorative way - .
