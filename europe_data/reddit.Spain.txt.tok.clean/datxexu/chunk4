  i think you 're the ones who have to give back rightful lusitanian clay . 
  plot twist : the demonym of the province of badajoz is * pacense * , which comes from civitas pacensis/pax iulia - beja , portugal - . 
  so they 're literally * the people from beja * - portugal - . 
  until visigoths . 
  everything went downhill then , believe me . 
  thank god for the ummayads .

  just as an hypothesis , i 'd say you can remember rhymes more easily . 
  that 's why oral tradition is usually in rhymes as well . 
   why would people from madrid or the canary islands vote in favor ? 
  it 's ridiculous xd who said that ? 
  what if we just want to get rid of problems ? 
  what if we feel other regions should have more presence in the spanish political scenario ? 
  what if i do want a castillian state ? 
  did n't artur mas wanted to remain the king of spain the prince of girona or something ? 
  but yes , it would be obvious . 
  by that rule , any colonial power could n't have recognised the independence of their colonies .

  are there levels or something ? 
  does any ethnicity descend from another ? 
  northern castillians are the cold people - an actual stereotype of `` secos '' - . 
  you 're too mediterranean for our social interactions !, 
  northern europe is much more collectivist than southern europe . 
   is any of this true ?

  completely agreed . 
  i did a vocational degree myself and i feel like i 'm diverging from my friends , the vast majority of them studying or willing to study a university degree . 
  not to say how the degree is no longer enough , you have to do a particularly and unjustifiably expensive masters ' as well !, 
  but the truth is that doing a degree would n't fill my expectations , i see myself going there for meeting people and brag about studying there instead of focusing on the knowledge you 're taught . 
  on the other hand , that way it 's easier to become a * funcionario * . 
  i do n't know what you are thinking of me right now .

  foreign : - michelangelo - bernini - sabatini ( this guy basically built madrid ) - gustave eiffel - oscar niemeyer - norman foster local : - juan de herrera ( late renaissance ) - juan de villanueva ( neoclassicism ) - ildefons cerd\u00e0 ( the guy who made barcelona 's squared grid ) - antoni gaud\u00ed ( early 20th century ) - santiago calatrava ( nowadays ) - rafael moneo ( nowadays ),

  by trashiest , you mean politically incorrect people , socialit\u00e9s ... ? 
   for the city dwellers : what 's the public transit situation ( well funded , falling apart , etc. ) ? 
  for some years trains ' and bus frequencies have been reduced due to budget cuts , but nowadays it has balanced well a bit again . 
  local governments have to pay extensions of metro network that are n't that profitable than expected . 
   how extensive are your systems in your city and nation as a whole ? 
  here in madrid it is , comparing to other cities . 
  everybody living in flats makes population density higher , so it can be more useful to make new mass transit lines to arrive . 
  spain 's transportation means are centralised in madrid. , and then by the coastlines . 
  the only ways to go from north to south is by the mediterranean coast or madrid . 
  the western national rail network is in worse conditions than the eastern , as it 's more profitable to bring people to barcelona or valencia than portugal . 
  airports are concentrated , again , in madrid and the coast . 
   are there some interesting situations of an urban planning blunder ( sort of like the big dig in boston , or the horrendously slow process of the 2nd avenue subway in new york ) ? 
  3 tunnels in the m-30 highway by southern madrid , one of the biggest tunnel networks of europe -33 km/20 miles - . 
  in the past , the m-30 carriageways surrounded the river of the city - manzanares - and cut across fully urban areas near the center of madrid . 
  between 2004 and 2008 , the carriageways were converted to tunnels and outside a [ big park ] ( http://www.lugaresquevisitar.com/wp-content/uploads/madrid-r\u00edo1.jpg ) was built over . 
   are you satisfied with the current systems in place ? 
  would you like to see more ( or less if that 's even a thing ... ) ? 
  i 'm * satisfied * but urban planning should n't rely only on public transit .
