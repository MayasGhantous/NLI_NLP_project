  spain-wide , electrification of railways should be a priority to make the trains go faster . 
   to get a stable job and a stable relationship i want to point out the `` and '' . 
  lots of people who work do n't feel the need to leave their parents ' home . 
  there 's this whole thing of construction workers catcalling women who walked near their building site . 
  as time has passed , it became more and more frowned upon . 
  although it may be necessary to have women 's opinions to make sure though .

  if no nukes ... it 's going to be difficult to know . 
  the geopolitical factor is going to be the most important . 
  other global powers wo n't be so foolish to let us invade europe so easily . 
  they can achieve an equally divided western world if helping and politically influencing europe .

  yeah i know you were n't referring to portugal !, 
  but i 'm afraid i have to correct you and say that western spain belongs to `` sun '' , apart from some valleys and meadows . 
   the spanish with an `` x '' in the username i do n't remember if there is any other spanish lurker with an x , so i suppose i am ? 
  there was this electoral promise from a couple of parties to turn the spanish parliament unicameral , removing the senate - upper house - . 
  this is due to having the senate 's powers never used and weaken by having the main parties overrepresented , to the point that the media only focus their attention to the lower house - congress of deputies - . 
  spanish , english , can guess other romance languages , java and php .

  [ men\u00e9ame ] ( https://www.meneame.net ) - literally * shake/sway me * - is almost a copy of reddit for spain . 
  they 're structured in subs , and they have amas and everything , although it 's almost a niche site . 
  [ forocoches ] ( https://www.forocoches.com ) - literally * cars-forum * - , despite being a forum/bulletin board , is similar to reddit or 4chan in the meaning of being the `` avant-garde '' of memes ~ ~ and not being very progressive ~ ~ and having a fairly bigger community . 
  you need an invitation to join , though . 
  [ memondo network ] ( http://memondonetwork.es ) has some websites that host several types of memes , like [ rage memes ] ( http://www.cuantocabron.com ) , so it can be like 9gag , for example . 
  for latin america , the argentinian social site [ taringa !, 
  ] ( https://www.taringa.net ) has a place , especially in the past there were lots of stuff uploaded like music and warez . 
  back in the day , nowadays the virtual phone carrier tuenti was the facebook of spanish youth , with way more privacy than zuckeberg 's website . 
  fun fact : invented by a californian who went to rural spain in an student exchange . 
  anyway , fb , twitter , instagram and such are more popular than those . 
  it was projected that the spanish motorways ' network would be the 3rd world 's largest , after china and us . 
  of course , this wo n't happen as this was a byproduct of intensive ~ ~ corruption ~ ~ building policies in the context of a housing bubble . 
  lots of highway tracks are new , so the roads are in fairly good conditions . 
  there are two types of motorways - * autov\u00edas * , way more common , have to give access to nearby properties , usually with building an exit to local roads , while * autopistas * does n't - . 
  usually , the * autopistas * are toll roads , and older than the rest of the network . 
  they 're more common in coastal areas . 
  there are n't * autov\u00edas * that are toll roads , so the highway network is mostly free . 
  speed limit is 120 km/h . 
  there are , but usually they have an ideological motivation . 
  some of them can fit being literally `` think tanks '' for political parties .

  afaik no weight limit here in spain . 
  no lockers - in my high school we had ones but they were few and you had to rent them - , no anything . 
  when notebooks started to be not required by teachers , we used folders instead . 
  not one historical event , but how people lived back then , instead of focusing only in events .

  there are more cities than the usual ones that are able to host the olympics . 
  there should be more variety . 
   is this some kind of deep-rooted , international , black market business ? 
  seems so . 
  new inmigration gets in contact with older migrants and help them find a job . 
  actually i 've been to portugal ... because it 's near my grandparents ' city . 
  all the other travels were in spain . 
  never took a train or a plane . 
   there are people here who have been to over 30 countries if you read more carefully , some are cheating and counting regions !,

  basically the problem with gypsies is not only the integration in society , it 's the values and social rules they hold , that belong to gypsy culture , but non-gypsies ca n't accept - see , encouraging your daughter to marry at 15 - . 
  on the other hand , gypsies have developed their own culture in each country and even on a regional level . 
  iberian gypsies developed flamenco , for instance . 
  it 's supposed to represent castile . 
  purple suits better than crimson though . 
  did n't have seen lots of mena men in the videos either , but south asian men , the edm scene is growing in asia , especially the far east and india .

  i found a significant correlation between climate change deniers and these types of white nationalists/neo-nazis and such . 
  they have two options : - do something for the world admitting climate change and doing something about it . 
  - host your own place to climate refugees for the next generations . 
  moreover this is already a thing . 
  this is the first time i heard of nicknames for heatwaves omg !, 
  but the weather we 're having this year has way more hot air than other years , which was only the 40\u00bac given by the sun . 
  in some places here they already have this as a tapa , so why not then ? 
  because it 's ~ ~ american ~ ~ and a pretty common and underrated dish , mainly due to fast food chains as you said . 
  with the juice drownin ' the meat my friend . 
  actually i 'm a fan of minced meat in general , apart from bolognese sauce . 
  i would have said burgers as well i could say kebab , durum , taco , any sandwich or wrap ... the variety in taste . 
  burgers , but my instinct says i 'm going to be downvoted by this ... 
  rather than measures to increase birthrates , creating the enviroment to make it suitable to make families without such hassle - paid enough jobs with rights and so ... 
  the problem of that kind of measures is that they 're like others : you need lots of people coordinated to have an influence . 
  1 person not reproducing does n't change anything if everyone else does . 
  the same goes for recycling , reducing pollution ... 
  regular japanese and american cars used to be more prestigious - not more popular - in spain until the 90s or so - although most of those models were made in european factories - .
