  japanese cars are n't looked upon , but koreans ' can be , although their quality has improved a lot - like lots of korean and other asian brands - . 
  american brands early adopted european standards for their cars , so it 's more rare to see pure american cars on europe . 
  does n't croatia and slovenia have lots of forests or something ? 
  my vote goes for them . 
  adding several towns called villaviciosa - viciousville -,

  well , it came by the 16th century , but it was n't tolerated until 3 centuries later due to the inquisition . 
  - latin america : seems they managed to have almost western standards despite all their following history since their independence . 
  - philippines : not hispanic anymore . 
  #thanksus - equatorial guinea : a shitshow recently fueled by oil . 
  - western sahara : a shitshow recently fueled by phosphates . 
  - other spanish islands in the pacific : did n't give any influence there . 
  another `` i can , with license '' . 
  of course , automatic firearms are banned and such , only those types of firearms designed for sport or hunting are allowed . 
  actually in spain , protestantism - since mid-to-late 19th century - is older than opus dei -1928 - . 
  i can acknowledge corruption , but fascists ... they are a fringe minority . 
  again for spain , vans or smaller trailers . 
  from time to time you can see those japanese pickups , but for certain cases or just for fun . 
  is this a pun right ? 
  apart from the christian festivities - that were set on old pagan festivities - , there are some obscure festivities in some villages throughout spain that it has been claimed a pre-roman background . 
  our geographical position favoured an interesting history to learn . 
  this might sound * so american * , but here you can find the - mainly cultural though - heritage of lots of peoples and civilizations .

  never had seen the first , but have seen the second , although it 's not `` usual '' it 's not frowned upon . 
  usually the second happens when you come across a old lady - or man - and something happens near you both - any excuse is good - .

  discard a spanish city . 
  a property in galicia for that price ... 
  i 'll have to check out what you have found , but i bet it 's a piece of land in the countryside . 
  it 's not that the economy is shittier , it 's that everyone there goes to the coastal cities .

   edit : i saw people mentioning in previous thread latin : but do you seriously consider learning declinations , conjugations and latin sayings as learning tongue ? 
  from what i 've heard - i 'm a stem guy - they do n't learn to * speak * latin , but to understand it . 
  latin must be useful to learn other romance languages . 
  edit : sorry , i assumed it was just in high school or university enviroment . 
  pretty complex to explain . 
  as muslims have been for a while here , we took for us what we liked from them . 
  art , engineering , science , philosophy made in al-andalus is as spanish as much as muslim . 
  of course , those of 1000 years back . 
  for a long time as well , al-andalus beauty standards were taken for spanish - raven hair and pale skin - . 
  but in the end , * we achieved ** to get it all from them . 
  since the 19th century , muslim world took this image of [ exotic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tales_of_the_alhambra ) and [ backwards ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hispano-moroccan_war_\\ ( 1859 -- 60 \\ ) ) . 
  about levant , mesopotamian or/and persian ancient civilizations , the average spaniard does n't know much about them . 
  ^ \\* ^ * we * ^ refers ^ to ^ the ^ christian ^ kingdoms , ^ which ^ are ^ the ^ `` parents '' ^ of ^ the ^ actual ^ territories ^ nowadays . 
  ^ taking ^ into ^ account ^ that ^ the ^ vast ^ majority ^ of ^ muslims ^ in ^ spain ^ did n't ^ have ^ a ^ foreign ^ background , ^ as ^ they ^ were ^ converted ^ back ^ when ^ the ^ muslims ^ entered ^ in ^ the ^ iberian ^ peninsula .

  ~ ~ rightful spansih empire clay , gib ~ ~ i 'd say that apart from western films , the only thing from texas we can imagine is the imported stereotype that everything 's bigger in texas . 
  i 'd say not in purpose . 
  spanish syntax is pretty flexible and other grammar rules give a lot of meaning to the sentence so if you change it you wo n't be understood the intended way . 
  but incorrect orthography is somewhat popular , especially to mock certain groups of people .

  so it 's a lack of secession movements elsewhere ? 
   you seem to forget that in case of yu it was n't about socialism so how local socialism is perceived nowadays ? 
  as an excuse to get all yugoslavia 's nations together ? 
  take mainstream right , such as merkel 's .
