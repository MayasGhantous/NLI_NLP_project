  true . 
  the same goes for valencia and arag\u00f3n . 
  castile 's were debilitated 2 centuries back , so it seemed useful for him . 
   last time barcelona fell to the spanish stopped reading here . 
  spain did n't * conquer * catalonia . 
  not even castile . 
  troops loyal to the heir designed by charles ii , phillip of anjou , entered in barcelona . 
  5.334,77 hab/km \u00b2 in madrid city , 795 hab/km \u00b2 in madrid 's province , 91,95 hab . / km \u00b2 for spain . 
  madrid city 's should be higher due to having such big forests by the outskirts . 
  the same for spain , to an extent . 
  also , older generations generally care more about freedom , and younger about social justice . 
  can you explain a little further if you do n't mind to ? 
   to the right being fully unionist forgot to mention in contrast to the `` official '' left , that have said they would be open to talk about catalonia 's current political situation . 
  but i do agree that cs mainly represents the `` status-quo '' of the politics of europe nowadays , pretty centrist . 
  cs consider themselves as `` progressive liberalism '' , something like economically liberal but socially progressive . 
  on the other hand , they 're against any independence movement , so they 're portrayed as more right-wing due to the right being fully unionist , apart from the secessionist right of course . 
  building ones like tropico - this saga features more strategy as well - . 
  i have seen it once in a cathedral here in spain . 
  edit : they were removed though .

  i 'd say northern spain is our `` croatia '' - everybody says it 's unknown ... but it 's known - way of st james anyone ? 
  inner spain is isolated and pretty unknown for example - apart from madrid and surrondings - . 
  edit : correcting logic, 
  - step 1 : go to / r/europe - step 2 : search `` catalonia '' - step 3 : grab some popcorn - step 4 : read comments - step 5 : rinse and repeat - step 6 : and it just goes on edit : this helped me reach 4000 comment karma . 
  thank you all !!, 
  the same when a latin american * criticise * us for * that thing that happened 500 years ago ... * both are a pillar of our respective nationalisms though . 
  and f * ck what that couple said ... 
  i 'd say wendy 's out of curiosity . 
  it seems that it used to be in spain but accusations of bad practices made wendy 's close its spanish branch . 
  offtopic : is spain the only place where there are already several taco bells ? 
   gallegos is used all around latin america as an umbrella term for iberians , regardless of their actual origin ( basques , catalans , castilians , they all are called gallegos ) . 
  i do know , although most of the spanish diaspora in argentina was of galician origin - that 's why * gallegos * . 
  thanks for your answer anyway , pretty informative !,

   do you grade in the same way america does with a 90 % + being an a , 80-89 being a b , 70-79 being a c , 60-69 being a d , and 59 % - being an f ? 
  and do grades go by semester or something similar ? 
  you pass with a 5 , between 0 to 10 . 
   how many classes will a high school student typically take ? 
  in america it will typically be 6 . 
  also , some schools have all 6 classes a day , some alternate with 3 a day , and some have 3 each semester and you change classes half way through the year . 
  do you use any of these ? 
  around 8 , every week there must be 1 class of each subject * ( corrected ) . 
   how do advanced classes work ? 
  in america , you can typically choose between 2-3 levels of the same class . 
  for example , european history ( basic ) , honors european history ( difficult ) , and ap european history ( college level ) , if there 's only two levels , ap is usually the one that is n't there . 
  they are all introductory level and it 's usually totally up to the student to which they take . 
  it does n't exist here . 
  you may go to an special school with advanced lessons , but that 's for gifted students and such . 
   is it true that you have an integrated system ? 
  for example , in america , you can take biology , chemistry , physics , anatomy , and more depending on the school in any order you choose ( with exceptions ) . 
  the integrated version of this would be just having `` science '' , or just having `` math '' rather than algebra , geometry , calculus , etc. 
  it branches as you 're choosing your fields of study . 
   how big is europe on elective classes ? 
  we can choose a few classes a year that are totally optional , like jrotc ( military class ) , welding , woodshop , etc. 
  there are some stuff but it 's not dependant on the school but on the government . 
  not too many `` optional subjects '' to choose though . 
   i 've heard there 's no homework in some countries , is this true ? 
  ( and elaborate if it 's an oversimplification ? ), 
  where ? 
  i thought colombia is where `` vascos '' are like what in argentina are `` gallegos '' , it is , the largest spanish diaspora group in the country . 
  gas, 
  my grandma 's please !, 
  i do , but it 's because i know a little bit more about that stuff and how things work inside . 
  no we do n't have special holidays for them , there 's a military parade and an armed forces day , but it 's a day * dedicated * to them , not * for * them . 
  there must be ones somewhere from the spanish civil war throughout spain . 
  are you aware that despacito has nothing to do with spain right ? 
  and anal is a greek - in prostitution 's argot though . 
  english discipline is spanking as well, 
  i 'd say it is n't , although you can buy it in supermarkets and restaurants . 
  i only heard of * eypos * in forocoches .

  curiously , in argentina , being a * gallego * - any spaniard to an extent - is also being a stupid person . 
  i do n't know how to swin, 
  cash is definitely more common . 
  i 'd say the amount of money when people start to pay with card is around 50 $ , as people are more fearful of losing higher amounts of cash if their wallet was lost or stolen . 
  does [ light rail ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metro_ligero ) count ? 
  if so , [ alstrom citadis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alstom_citadis ), 
  i think you 're referring to socialites , rather than real political influence , right ? 
  d'you mean the club ?

  lots of children .

   what do you guys think of the mexican accent ? 
  there are several of them ... iirc the stereotypical one is from the state of tabasco . 
  it feels a bit more `` cutesy '' but nothing out of the ordinary , just the way they speak .
