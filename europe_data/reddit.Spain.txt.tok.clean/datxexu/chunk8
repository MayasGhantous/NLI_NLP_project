   are there any latin accents you enjoy hearing ? 
  personally i have n't payed attention ... colombian and venezuelan sound more pleasant to me . 
  caribbeans ' and * porte\u00f1o * sounds more funny . 
  not even a language , `` an accent '' xddd, 
   why are europeans so annoyed by ~ ~ american ~ ~ ** north american ** interest in their ancestry ? 
  just in case , i 'll tell you an example . 
  in latin america , there 's this thing that most people have a `` spanish grandpa/grand-grandpa/grand-grand-grandpa '' , due to inmigration from spain since the 1860s to 1940s . 
  some of their descendants emigrated to spain nowadays , and i had the opportunity of meeting some of them . 
  no one , nobody ever claimed they were `` spanish '' . 
  just that they have an spanish ancestor . 
  those who really feel spanish was because they were raised in spain and felt integrated in spain . 
  i 'd say that the richer the place , the hotter its neighbours are , but it can just be an stereotype ... 
  i will be that guy translation of the words in bullet points ? 
  - instagram-inspired fashion with an inditex influence . 
  every girl in spain wears the same clothes - especially outside big cities - . 
  especially the * swagger * trend along with the rising popularity of trap music . 
  - some vocabulary - bro , omg ... - also probably the `` sjw '' stuff , like some branches of feminism or lgbt minorities . 
  ~ ~ surprisingly , nothing about racial equality . ~ ~, 
  because the northern countries could achieve producing/manufacturing products with higher value , as a result of developing an industry . 
  i 'd say that circumstances in southern countries differ from each other , so there is n't a unique explaination . 
   how well off was it before wwi ( as of 1913 ) we recently had ~ ~ the rest of our colonies ~ ~ cuba , puerto rico and guam given to the us , so not very good . 
  on the other hand , part of the future investment in the colonies relocated to spain instead , so it helped a bit . 
  western sahara and spanish guinea remained with us . 
  wwi sparked a huge inflation in spain - a neutral country - that was contested with strikes . 
   what about the interbellum ? 
  we had the primo de rivera dictatorship , just in the middle of the golden twenties , so it favoured the economy and the regime , big multinational companies and banks started to have a place in spain , oil monopoly that will last until after the democracy ( 1986 ) . 
  then we had the second republic - history focus on its politics rather than the economy . 
  i 'd have to do some research - , and the civil war , so at the end our economy resented because of the latter .

  wherever i could live the better of all of them . 
  yugoslavia i suppose ? 
  any expert on eastern europe economical history ? 
  mmmm i have n't seen one , but they may appear in areas without extreme heat . 
  on the other hand , blackberry trees - in the past used for gardens , but most were removed from public spaces such as streets because blackberries get them dirty - and redcurrants are more common . 
  not a berry , but it 's common in `` yellow spain '' - not in the cantabric coast , in summer - to chew fennel sticks . 
  i would n't say `` universally '' , but rajoy - our current pm - , and historically [ franco ] ( http://isgeneralissimofranciscofrancostilldead.com ) , have a fair share of mocking . 
  - [ rajoy 's quotes ] ( https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/mariano_rajoy ) - [ franco 's engrish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4hee9oqka4 ), 
  the * conquistadores * . 
  they were praised as military geniuses , especially those who helped to conquer america 's civilizations - cort\u00e9s for the aztec empire , pizarro for the inca empire - . 
  since the american indigenous movements started to criticise the legacy of the conquest of america - local cultures disappeared , caste system , indigenous peoples enslaved - , more spaniards went critical of them to the point of genocide , especially since the 90s when latin american emigration grew . 
  the 1st , the 7th and the 8th do exist in spain , along with passing under a foldable ladder and the `` touch wood '' - to avoid bad luck in something - . 
   if you have the hiccups , that means that somebody is thinking about you . 
  i do n't know if this is an spanish tradition , but i was told that a buzz in your left ear means someone is telling bad things about you , and if it 's the right ear someone is telling good things about you . 
  it 's mainly used for last-time checking or convincing . 
  * - do n't you really want [ me ] to buy you some biscuits ? 
  there must be more pakistanis than indians , iirc , so you may be mistaken by them . 
  the only indians i met were students or tourists . 
  is n't it just selfishness ? 
  i usually play spaniards in any game , i 'm pretty casual . 
  i might have played with other countries , such the turks or romans . 
  definitely very common . 
  they 're concentrated in the mediterranean coast , then in seville , madrid and cities surrounding , salamanca , granada and the cantabric coast . 
  edit : and guancheland , of course !, 
  spaniard here , i do think that if you 're hot , you 're hot almost anywhere , although we may be a little more direct - depends on the culture - at the time of `` appreciation '' . 
  on the other hand , being a foreigner/contrasting body colours is almost always a plus on attractiveness . 
  [ for spain check out the ine ] ( http://www.ine.es/dynt3/inebase/en/index.htm?type=pcaxis&amp;path=/t20/e245/p08/&amp;file=pcaxis&amp;dh=0&amp;capsel=0 ) ( stands for national institute of statistics ), 
  some of them . 
  10/10 , i 'll be eager to explain anything they want . 
  i like my place 's history and if i were asked to show them , i wo n't refuse unless they gave a bad impression . 
   madrid definitely has the smug stereotype no no no , that 's not true . 
  it 's the best city in the world , it 's a fact !!!, 
  but if we do n't distinguish between chauvinism and smug , definitely we are n't . 
   madrid smugness is aggressive how you can make a difference among types of smugness ? 
  * \u00a1 dale !, 
  1800 $ i think , but i 'm not sure, 
  out of curiosity , is tommy cash known there ? 
   rat race from the childhood the competition parents , schools or society push for among their kids . 
  it 's like a copycat of working life . 
  * do this , so and so from page 56 and then read page 59 , i 'll ask someone next dayyyy !!!! * . 
  homeschooling removes a lot of that pressure . 
  it must be that spanish education is still very lecture-based . 
  it lacks teamwork and rethoric skills , that in fact they could be learnt better in a school . 
  i think that probably the most offensive jokes are the misogynist/sexist ones . 
  i think that you can get away with racist jokes , but not these as they 're an outright attack .

  ] ( https://xxyoy2s02z417uka-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/fairy-images-03.png ), 
  it 's somewhat common . 
  i mean , you can just rent an apartment for holidays . 
  upper classes in cities usually have second homes or even some land . 
  land or housing can be cheaper for middle class in poorer regions , so they 're able to afford it - both locals and other spaniards , in andaluc\u00eda , extermadura ... - . 
  tbh , some of them will trigger certain people or another . 
  generally speaking , we do n't see it demeaning being friends with latin american countries . 
  curiously , the worst trigger i can think of for a spaniard is criticising the conquest of america , insisting that * we * slaughtered and enslaved the native populations - in the same way germans or japanese could be criticised for their stuff in wwii - . 
  r/gtaorholland double trigger !, 
  i think it should be legal , as i 'm not a fan of the `` rat race from the childhood '' that i have seen in the schools . 
  nowadays , the kids `` study better '' but with a big pressure to be what they want to do in the future . 
  i see the concerns about religious upbringing and so on , but we already have religious schools , they may be less effective but banning homeschooling is n't going to kill religion . 
  basically i 'm going to bring kids to school just to make them socialise mainly .

   i quickly found out that our local branch of scouts was mostly doing indoors stuff , singing stupid songs , playing boring games , visiting fucking museums and the like . 
  iirc that 's the usual urban scout group - but tbh , this scouts ' branch was n't linked to the main scout movement , here they focused less on the conservative and practical side of baden-powell 's ideas - . 
  been for a year , and the countryside was replaced for the park , although we went to the mountains nearby once . 
  had never seen an internet-only tv channel .
