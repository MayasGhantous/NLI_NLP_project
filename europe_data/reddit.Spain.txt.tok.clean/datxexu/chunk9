  i suppose that france did a lot for us back then , despite our rivalries . 
  not really . 
  the interests of the eu members are too different to merge nowadays . 
  disclaimer : this is my experience , you redditors do n't necessarily have to share it . 
   spaniard attempts to communicate in portuguese , is amazed by the fact that the portuguese replies in spanish not even an attempt , we directly expect that they understand us speaking spanish . 
  and they fulfill our expectations . 
  not proud of it tbh . 
   born in what is now italy , married in portugal , died in spain , so all three countries can claim him . 
  just in case , in spain we acknowledge he 's from genoa . 
  he just happened to work for the spanish monarchy . 
  curiously , the historians of the dominican republic and spain still argue about where is columbus ' corpse - either in seville ( spain ) or santo domingo ( dominican republic ) . 
  [ the courtyards festival of c\u00f3rdoba ] ( http://english.turismodecordoba.org/seccion/the-courtyards-patios---world-heritage ) is known in spain . 
  the only thing i may worry about is the walking through the city center , never been in c\u00f3rdoba but i guess you can do a little research . 
  nope . 
  just in local fairs/festivities and it depends on the place as well , even so , it 's not that common . 
  not really , they 're nation-wide . 
  every week at least one . 
  ana de armas , cuban actress , now living in the us , has been in several spanish tv series . 
  now seriously , i 'd say that in case of emergency we could use the bells of the nearest church , but the population have to be informed first of their use for emergency alerts . 
  * edited : i meant alerts, 
   and your feets do n't get sweaty [ at least in the south ] ( http://cdn3.meme.am/cache/images/folder572/600x600/15965572/thats-where-youre-wrong-kiddo.jpg ), 
  in spain , ianal but iirc , the selling of fireworks is regulated by the regions/autonomous communities , and then the use of these fireworks are regulated by the town council . 
  so it depends on where you live to be allowed to light some fireworks . 
  in those places where you can use them , it 's usual to see them in summer when the kids have time to light them or in new years ' eve . 
  the best city in the world mate . 
  [ ( sauce ) ] ( https://youtu.be/hslb1ezrqfa?t=1m15s ), 
  not really ... 
  i think there are a couple of cycle rickshaws in a park but nothing else . 
  every time someone irl says `` i speak 5 languages bro ! '', 
  they 're only fluent in 2 . 
  not to mention whenever this is asked on this sub ... hey r/askeurope guys i know a zillion laguages , taught mysqlft thru a couple of levels in duolingo i am f * cking polyglot !!!!, 
  bollocks . 
  the point is that you should n't be ashamed if you are n't capable to learn a new language , everyone has different skills and be wary when people `` show off '' their languages ' level . 
  if you want to learn a language , take your time and effort to do it , your own pace . 
  - nikito nipongo - neither i remove nor put - . 
  a real one : gao ping , this chinese tax evader , was really called ping gao , that sounds like * pringa ( d ) o * - fool - . 
  check out for * americanismos * . 
  but i think there are n't long words that directly come from nauhatl - i guessed you may regard this language as a difficult one for us - and are widely used . 
  but definitely pronouncing your toponyms can be difficult to pronounce for those who are n't mexicans . 
  this is the first time i have heard of it . 
  did a little research and it seems that flamingo is a franchise chain in spain . 
  overall , in spain second-hand clothing it 's not that popular because it 's still affordable to many people to buy new clothes in other cheap clothing chains - inditex , primark , h&m ... 
  depends of the outlet , if it 's loose i 'll have to hold it . 
  but hardly ever i have to do it . 
  some supermarket chains and other big retail companies in spain are french - carrefour , dia , auchan , leroy merlin , fnac ... - . 
  out of curiosity , how do you walk ? 
  i ca n't believe we 're the only ones . 
  just in case , narrow pavements exist here as well . 
  carpets are definitely harder to clean and it keeps more heat , that 's why we usually have ceramic floor instead ( i do n't know if that 's the right word , i 'm on mobile right now ) regarding our food , that quoted statement is true up to a point . 
  italy and france are more `` famous '' than spain , or at least they carry more stereotypes , so their food is more known as well . 
   spain : sexiest men on the planet . 
  your inbox right now - italy : classy bros - germans : where work is made - french : people do n't shower and it 's the natural habitat of supermarket chains - u.k. : london , tourists , polite to a fault , drunk af - ireland : your niece has been there to practise english - netherlands : holland , no ragrets - sweden : sexiest women on the planet , but in the 70s - spain : hell on earth - portugal : there 's this legend that there is a country on the west of spain called ... 
  i have to remember , sorry ... something like poor-tu-cale or else ? 
  it is said that there are some cheap towels and coffee there !, 
  - bulgaria ( and all the countries around there ) : probably your neighbour . 
  drinks a lot more than you btw . 
  there 's a chance your uncle 's wife is from there . 
  - russians : drunk men , sexy women , rich people in marbella - we basically think half of europe are a bunch of drunks but do n't feel bad ( it 's cause we 're light weights ) - norway : redneck sweden - switzerland : our politicians loooove the ~ ~ banks and the privacy laws ~ ~ alps for some reason, 
  the english tailor * is * el corte ingl\u00e9s * , a department store chain that are almost a monopoly here in spain . 
  edit : `` giving it to '' is a literal translation of the lyrics , it should mean `` cheating with '', 
  just in case , you may have guessed that by here the general feeling is that northern countries are more `` advanced '' than us . 
  - [ metralleta ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=bocadillo+metralleta&amp;tbm=isch ) - [ salchipapas ] ( https://www.google.es/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=salchipapas ) you can find them in any fair or even some bars . 
   i 'm like `` sounds like something i probably would n't listen to in romanian '' i think most people can relate to it in the case of english `` dance pop '' songs . 
  * shake your booty babe , shake your booty goooo ... * multiplied by 64 it 's not everyone 's taste ... edit : noticed this trend of romanian music featuring latin singers as well . 
  france , uk , distant relatives in sweden, 
   ac\u00e1 la m\u00fasica del otro lado del charco est\u00e1 activ\u00e1 con flow , yatusabe no hay mas n\u00e1 there 's this love-hate relationship with latin music . 
  reggaeton is politically incorrect , but look how those pure-blood spanish girls shakin ' dem ' bootys to the patum-pan-tum beat . 
  ofc there 's some bachata , merengue , latin style pop , etc. 
  from latin american singers or bands . 
  - most mixed private-public schools are owned by congregations of the catholic church . 
  - you can pay - a tiny - part of your taxes to them - they are n't paying taxes on their properties,

  ~ ~ honestly , probably mentioning the discovery of the americas is going to be a really bad idea to mention due to the huge changes the continents suffered and blah blah ... ~ ~, 
   however , a friend from zaragoza was unaware of indian restaurants in her city , and was never interested in them before visiting madrid . 
  i can not speak for the rest of the country , though . 
  that 's is the point ... in the rest of spain , indian food is n't a thing afaik . 
   i kept it for a while , especially for understanding big prices such as houses . 
  i do n't use it anymore unless i want to scare someone about how expensive something is . 
  actually , i could n't understand until right now that i remembered it and googled it , how much a `` kilo '' was -1 million pesetas = 6000 $ - . 
  the same in spain , adding italian restaurants as foreign , and a few latin american ones as well . 
  also middle eastern = kebab, 
  most offensive map , ever !, 
  that 's all the news we had . 
  - internet fights for not liking each other 's dub - reggaeton everywhere - ~ ~ galicians ~ ~ we used to emigrate to venezuela and argentina to get rich . 
  to this day spaniards are still called galicians . 
  - cuba was ( and if it were n't for commander fidel they 'd still be ) like spain - we do n't have much contact with philippines and guam - immigration from ecuador and dominican republic - latin america in general has been looking up to us for this last century instead of spain . 
  that 's why most of the spanish speaking media is in ... the us . 
  workplaces are in the centre or up north , so most people take up to 45 minutes or more to arrive by public transport . 
  not to mention when there 's some business area in the middle of nowhere ... 
  there 's a fair amount of kebab restaurants where i live , but i have n't seen them yet anywhere else . 
  it 's getting more and more common . 
  in southern spain you can find a lack of heating systems though . 
  if you want to try out the guitar in person , i 'd suppose you want to go to a physical store , it would be helpful to say where you live . 
  europe-wide www.thomann.de usually has good deals , and you can return your purchased product in 30 days . 
  out of curiosity , what 's the difference ? 
  been in san lorenzo and lluanco , and the first can be pretty crowded !, 
  good photos , they must have amazing views there !, 
  stiges ? 
  seems like a cool place !, 
  there is n't a `` hookup culture '' like in the us , but definitely , there 's pr0n , nudist beaches , lgbt rights ... etcetera .
