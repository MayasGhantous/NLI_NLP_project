  yeah , but it rubs me the wrong way that whenever someone posts in spanish , he 's told to go to r/es or to post in english when , very often , there 's no source in english for some news and it 'd be nice to discuss them here regardless of the language . 
  in r/europe people post stuff in languages other than english and they 're not told to go somewhere else , they post a translation and everybody is happy . 
  / r/spain `` encourages '' to post in english , so i 'm surprised people sneaked in 11 posts in spanish, 
  if you go back to 1992 , spain and italy got gold medals instead . 
  hehehe i 'm nor from galicia but i have to travel there often because of work and i can enjoy the scenery and the food . 
  french influence in galician or asturian cuisine ? 
  he he , i like your username , guigui, 
  and the food is great . 
  same goes for asturias , well all the north , really . 
  high heels are not mandatory in business except in movies ( where being hot is also mandatory ) . 
  ties are still mandatory though in some sectors though that 's dying out . 
  i 've been on the receiving end of a terrible stare by an english waiter for that offence . 
  * [ cough ] ( http://www.democratsabroad.org/black_lives_matter_spain ) *, 
  considering old people have to prove they 're still alive , i doubt this is true, 
  it seems [ romanian beat moroccan in spain in 2015 ] ( http://www.ine.es/jaxi/datos.htm?path=/t20/p277/prov/e01/l0/&amp;file=01003.px ), 
  also , politicians love to play the civil war game to divide society . 
  history is * optional * ? 
  ^ old ^ egb-ian ^ here, 
  seconding manchego and cabrales , also burgos , camembert . 
  weight is the gravitational force , therefore newtons . 
  though it 's true than when people say weight they usually mean mass . 
  weight is really newtons . 
  that sounds like the brexit supporters that want the eu benefits without paying for them . 
  and single people did n't need to disclose their sexuality , and could adopt . 
  ( i do n't know since when , though ), 
  gay people can adopt in spain . 
  in fact , they could even before gay marriage . 
  we wish that were true , but no , grandparents are the ones in charge of feeding their children and grandchildren with their pension because benefits do have a time limit and depend heavily on for how long you worked before . 
  exactly . 
  and that 's the reason most of our skilled workers are outside spain . 
  exactly . 
  plenty of skilled workers are working outside spain , and when they try to come back , they find the salaries are so low it 's not worth it . 
  nope , minimum is 756 $ / month . 
  you can compare here different countries : https://www.google.es/publicdata/explore?ds=ml9s8a132hlg_&amp;met_y=minimum_wage&amp;idim=country:es:fr:pt&amp;fdim_y=currency:eur&amp;hl=es&amp;dl=es, 
  per month . 
  we do n't usually state salaries per week . 
  but they had an agreement with psoe . 
  is psoe right wing , too ? 
  it was just for google news . 
  search results do n't have to pay anything ( yet ) . 
  there 's been talk about it , because our healthcare used to cover things that other european countries did n't , so foreigners would come here to have those treatments , and then their country would refuse to pay spain for them . 
  but with the financial cuts in healthcare for everyone , it probably does n't matter anymore . 
  in fact there 's healthcare tourism : [ page 107 of the pdf report ] ( http://www.minetur.gob.es/turismo/en-us/pnit/eje3/paginas/estudio-turismo-salud.aspx ) . 
  the # 1 country of origin of those tourist ? 
  `` only '' 500.000 younger than 35 , some say almost 2 million overall . 
  the worst thing about it ? 
  91 % of them have at least a degree , if not a master . 
  we 're not only losing people , we 're losing people we 've invested in , and that otherwise would be necessary to work here . 
  you just sold me nocilla !, 
  chocolate ftw, 
  but we have nocilla !, 
  i misunderstood what you said , then . 
  way behind ibiza and majorca . 
  also , my guess is those are not the i 'm - going-to-get-drunk type . 
  same thing probably applies to german tourists . 
  i do n't even try to understand what they mean by hispanic . 
  the race divide in the us looks like a mess from my point of view and i 'm not sure how healthy it is for its society . 
  yes , but menorca is really nice . 
  we should n't even speak of it in case someone learns it exists . 
  as you 've been explained , you sounded way off , broken and just like google translate does . 
  you have to be careful when you use slang in another language . 
  i could say all you 've been saying is bullshit . 
  does that sound nice to you ? 
  well , saying i say gilipolleces does n't sound nice either . 
  you sound pretty butthurt about a random comment , when i 've certainly made my point more than you did , because you only insist on insulting others . 
  the way it 's been explained to me , we 're latin because latino means latin american . 
  the problem comes when in spanish we use the same word for both . 
  i wish we really did . 
  so , italian and french ( who are latin ) are latino too ? 
  because my understanding ( and i may be wrong ) is that latino means latin-american , while latin means from a country where rome had a big influence , mainly in the language . 
  from time to time , some people go to / r/spanish and ask if white people speaking spanish is disrespectful . 
  it 's not paella , then . 
  it 's like saying that three delights rice is paella with carrot and ham . 
  we 're latin , not latino . 
  * have you ever been to europe ? 
  * is n't that little girl too young to dye her hair blonde ? 
  * you do n't look spanish * you 're lucky to have a siesta everyday, 
  you should have a bagpipe duel !, 
  ~ ~ the moustache ~ ~, 
  you were n't trying to practise your spanish , you were trying to call the previous poster a liar in spanish , same as you 've done to me . 
  maybe you did n't want other people noticing that ? 
  if you want praise about your spanish skills , do n't use them to insult the native speakers . 
  you 're free to believe whatever you want about my friends , they know what they had to pay for a simple surgery , and their room was shared with someone else . 
  maybe their insurance is shit , maybe pittsburg 's hospitals suck , but when they had their first kid ( in spain , just in case there were complications ) they decided they had to leave the states and come back to europe . 
  nice try at google translate . 
  and yes , i have enough friends in the us that have the same opinion : ` private healthcare in the us ( pittsburg ) is what spanish public healthcare was 20 years ago ' . 
  in fact they 're trying to come back exactly for this reason . 
  well , i 'm spanish and apparently i do n't look spanish either . 
  also , have you ever been to europe ? 
  do n't worry , the sentences are for show ( and to know when / if they can get penitentiary privileges ) . 
  people in spain can only be in jail for 20 years top so you get the case of people who 've killed several people , get a 300 year sentence and still leave jail at 20 or less . 
  yes , most cinemas carry dubbed movies , but there are some that show the movies in the original language ( whatever that is ) with subtitles . 
  that 's what i was wondering as well . 
  we have bread with every meal , for breakfast biscuits and toast are popular ... 
  maybe we should try that with the uk , and see if they give us gibraltar, 
  hey , dorne is in spain !, 
  that turn into crabs !, 
  thank you !, 
  thanks for the tip , but i meant if the tortilla was with or without onions . 
  it 's a very important matter for any spaniard .
