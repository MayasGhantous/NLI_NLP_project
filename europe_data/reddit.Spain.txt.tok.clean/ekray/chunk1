because you basically called the locals stupid , saying they made up their traditions ( and it 's a pretty big tradition down there ) . 
  so , before you do that , check that what you 're saying is true . 
  care to cite some sources ? 
  according to wikipedia it was used since prerroman times around the mediterranean in general . 
  the `` consorcio nacional almadrebero '' exists since 1928 and was based in tarifa ( c\u00e1diz province ) . 
  the town of zahara de los atunes ( hint , check the name ) exists since at least 1444 and they granted the dukes of medina sidonia the fishing rights of the tuna from there . 
  if you 're going to make shit up at least plase back it up . 
  hey , it will be fun when people from lleida and girona complain that all investments go to barcelona . 
  maybe instead of `` madrit ens roba '' it will be `` barcelona ens roba '' . 
  one interesting thing is how strong the support for independence is in the more rural areas , especially in lleida and girona with over 60 % in favor of independence . 
  this big advantage there and the terrible electoral law that we have gave the majority to the independist side . 
  barcelona `` only '' voted 44 % for independence . 
  tarragona is mostly split with a bit more favoring the union ( 50.5 % no , 49.5 % yes ) . 
  oh yes i did , sorry did n't notice i posted it so many times . 
  go grow your own vegetables and raise your own animals then . 
  i 'm not sure but i have n't been following the catalan news much lately . 
  i recall hearing something about him setting up a catalan hacienda ( irs ) but nothing about a central bank . 
  i assume an independent catalonia would want to use the euro anyway . 
  yeah so ? 
  saying that catalonia is the political heir to the republic is completely absurd . 
  especially considering that ciu ( or now cdc ) is part of that industrial bourgeouise ( sp ) from catalonia that was , at some point , cozy and friendly with franco . 
  that 's what i actually think that will happen . 
  i believe in the end the spanish government will be pressured to accept some demands from the catalan one , mainly fiscal independence ( one of their main demands traditionally since the basques have it for historical reasons ) . 
  what will happen years after that ? 
  who knows . 
  that is so stupid i ca n't even begin to understand it ... 
  from the balearic islands : [ tumbet/tombet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tombet ) from central spain : [ migas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/migas ) and [ pisto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pisto ) from andaluc\u00eda : [ pring\u00e1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pring%c3%a1 ) and all the different kind of cocidos ( stews ) all around the country . 
  my favourites are madrile\u00f1o , gallego and monta\u00f1\u00e9s ( from cantabria ), 
  i understand that above 30 might seem a lot but really it 's not much , you get used to it fast . 
  usually when the summer starts and comes a day with 31 degrees it 's a bit tough but after 2 or 3 days in that weather you do n't even notice it . 
  above 37 it starts to get tough but you will rarely get there in the coasts . 
  still , avoid central andalucia in the summer , that place is hell . 
  i do not like our monarchy , i personally wish they were exiled forever or imprisoned because of all the damage that their family has done to our country . 
  i do not really care if the flag stayed as it is now ( with the crown removed from the seal ) or changed to the republican one but using this flair shows my support for a republic or a change in the organization on the country . 
  in spanish it 's really easy to confuse them . 
  sweden is suecia and switzerland is suiza so you might understand the mistake . 
  spain = mexico = cuba for some people ( you know from where ), 
  yeah i know about now . 
  i understand that since traditional corridas were heavily associated with spain they were first shunned and they banned by the generalitat . 
  correbous are terrible in my opinion and one of the reasons why i disliked the catalan law for bullfighting since it seemed so hypocrite to me . 
  toros are killed in pamplona . 
  after the encierro there is a corrida in the afternoon . 
  i do n't think it was imported from castilian emigration to be honest , mostly because it 's also present in southern france . 
  because they vote directly for the president . 
  when they vote , wherever they are , they vote for obama or mccain or whoever is running that year . 
  when you vote in spain you do n't vote for rajoy or iglesias or pablo s\u00e1nchez , you vote for a list of representatives from the party you decided . 
  are you from madrid ? 
  the person running for president usually will be the first on the list from madrid so you see their name but in other provinces you wo n't . 
  as an example : http://www.ppbenavente.es/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/papeleta-elecciones.jpg, 
  we do n't . 
  when you vote in spain you vote for a list of candidates from a political party ( usually ) from your province . 
  each province has a number of seats in parliament and the votes determine the distribution of these seats . 
  after the election when all seats are assigned the new congress is formed and they vote on who will be the president of the government , which in english is better translated as prime minister . 
  this applies especially to a few topics . 
  if you 're not a spaniard do not talk about the civil war , franco or eta . 
  you might even have a phd in one of those topics , it does n't matter just do n't talk about it if you do n't know the person very well . 
  everyone here has an opinion about those topics and they 're not going to change them because of you , they might get angry and confrontational and you wo n't like it . 
  also , there were many ecuadorians in spain , at some point the biggest inmigrant group in the country ( around a million of them ) , but most of them left with the crisis and ecuador 's fast economic developement as of late, 
  payback for the british tourists on our beaches !, 
  todo sobre mi madre is usually considered his best movie , it also won the oscar for best foreign movie . 
  why portugal specifically ? 
  the biggest producer in the world is spain and the province of ja\u00e9n specifically is called the the olive oil world 's capital . 
  from outside of the basque country the issue is that the fueros are seen as unfair . 
  i would like some kind of federal state where everyone has something close as the basques but if the system keeps being the same i do n't really agree with the basques having benefits just because they sided the right way in some wars 300 years ago . 
  that said ciudadanos scares me too because it looks as a modernized pp . 
  according to [ el pa\u00eds ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2016/04/29/actualidad/1461933977_451120.html ) they have already changed their policy and allowed it . 
  first time i hear about it . 
  is it something new ? 
  i guess it only happens in colegios and not institutos ? 
  he lives in the mountains though !, 
  it rains a lot in san lorenzo del escorial . 
  i just checked and it rains more there than in london . 
  usually half-private schools and private schools in spain require a unifrom at least up to 16 years olds . 
  public schools do n't require it though . 
  the hometown is [ san lorenzo del escorial ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/san_lorenzo_de_el_escorial ) and the monastery is an unesco heritage site and is where all the spanish kings and queens are buried since charles v/i . 
  children in spain also go to sleep later . 
  i 'd say 9pm is the standard for small kids and most kids aged 9 or over go to bed at around 10pm ( at least that 's how i remember it ) . 
  also the schedule is a bit exagerated in some cases . 
  i 'd say most people work until 19:00 at most , not 20:00 ( there are some cases that work until 20:00 though ) . 
  but it is a huge problem and you can see how it influences the birthrate ( it 's 1.3 at the moment ) . 
  many children spend a lot of time with babysitters , grandparents or doing multiple extracurricular activies in the afternoon/evening . 
  yeah and next week we go into summer time so the sunset will be at 20.40 or so . 
  pretty late for early april and not being a northern country . 
  yeah you 're right , i did n't explain it correctly . 
  the eu court cancelled a trade agreement between mexico and the eu because it included western sahara which is n't recognized by everyone as part of morocco . 
  this pissed the moroccans off and they stopped talks with the eu . 
  this is the right answer . 
  we pay morocco , which is a stable country , to stop the migrants before they get to spain . 
  it has caused many protests from some human rights groups because morocco will do things like drop migrants in the middle of the saharan desert on their southern borders and stuff like that . 
  also just today this news came out ( sorry it 's in spanish ) : http://cadenaser.com/ser/2016/02/25/internacional/1456419535_542521.html morrocco is pissed that the eu did n't recognize western sahara ( another big mess ) in some treaty and cut relations with the eu for now , so maybe they 'll start letting migrants through again , it 's their main way of blackmailing europe into letting them overfish and getting low tariffs on agricultural exports . 
  seriously , two friends of mine went to live to portugal and came back , one of the main reasons : could n't get laid ever if not with tourists . 
  what is so different ? 
  those good tomatoes are hard to find everywhere . 
  first of all good tomatoes are only found in season , so mostly during summer or autumn . 
  same goes for other fruits . 
  the tomatoes i bought the other day here in madrid were terrible tasteless stuff but you ca n't expect much else in february . 
  also so much of the fruit and vegetables consumed in europe are produced in places like [ almeria ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/agricultura_intensiva_de_la_provincia_de_almer%c3%ada#/media/file:almeria-invernaderos.jpg ) or morocco where the quality is not the main concern . 
  of course if you have your own garden or live in a rural area in southern italy you will find good stuff , but that 's not everyhwere . 
  first they only seem to have used 4 spanish cities ( santiago , castellon , valencia and barcelona ) which is weird , especially missing important places for drugs like bilbao , m\u00e1laga , granada and madrid ( which hosts the biggest open air drug market in europe ) . 
  second it 's important that galicia has been for many years the most important drug trade port in western europe , most of colombia 's cocaine entered europe through galicia in the 80s and 90s so something had to have an effect there .
