[ this ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.elconfidencialdigital.com%2fdefensa%2fgobierno-rechazo-ejercito-expertos-nbq_0_2360163992.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) is what i have found about actual capabilities . 
  and yes , even as conscript soldiers we had our cursory training not unlike british civilians in the beginning of wwii . 
  now that we know that vienna ( a city in a neutral country ) [ would have been molten into glass by the soviets ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/austria/1364037/vienna-was-top-of-soviet-nuclear-targets-list.html ) first thing in the morning , i doubt this day and age there are many countries around not doing their homework . 
  you sure ? 
  sofia looks reasonably clean on google earth streetview now , [ this ... ] ( https://twitter.com/ascomadrid ), 
  any airborne military base around madrid should be ready to don their nbc suits in no time and safely lift and host a small town 's worth of ebola patients , four hours notice . 
  but no , that 's the kind of mission for poor devils and their old , overused ambulances . 
  it makes me wonder if some filthy madrile\u00f1o taxis would become a more hygienic transportation option for infection-prone accident victims . 
  in my experience and knowledge , tap water has been safe in spain for long . 
  tap water is definitely hard and more or less undrinkable in parts of the mediterranean coast and elsewhere , as seen on [ this map ] ( http://www.aquaprof.es/durezadelagua-espana.jpg ) . 
  as you may see , in a sizable part of spain tap water is ` soft ' and drinkable , particularly in madrid . 
  charcoal-resin filters will definitely help with taste in some other places , though . 
  the only water safety alert i remember was big news when it happened . 
  a dwindling aquifer metered unsafe arsenic concentrations , prompting a long spell of emergency supplies and an expensive infrastructure refitting in a drought-ridden , sparsely populated area . 
  there is no limit on how much i may donate , and there 's a tax incentive of 25 % of the amount . 
  america is a [ fiscal union ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/08/americas-fiscal-union ) . 
  the thing works because , for instance , most texans ( big earners ) wo n't feel that new mexicans ( low earners ) are stealing their wealth . 
  this way they are fine with a single monetary policy . 
  it 's a toll rather than a fine , in the sense that repeat offences wo n't aggravate the guilt . 
  they 'll just carry on , hoping they wo n't be fined more than usual . 
  in spain at least there are ` historical ' maps suited to every taste and persuasion . 
  i believe the best way to approach them is by linking to reputable historians . 
  most of the audience here may not have a clue about the historical context in the region . 
  tossing away yet another map wo n't help because we do n't have the knowledge to judge it . 
  coloured maps are particularly toxic . 
  you may see colours and think that , essentially , modern portugal and estonia are further away than , say , moscow and smolensk . 
  well , in many meaningful senses portugal and estonia are much closer . 
   the brits have ruinned them all . 
  may i contradict your opinion , all the way from [ a guarda ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q= `` a + guarda + desde + santa + tegra '' & tbm = isch ) ( [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_guarda ) ) at the portuguese border to [ hondarribia ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q= `` hondarribia '' & tbm = isch ) ( [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hondarribia ) ) at the french border ... and a few other towns and quaint places in-between . 
  funnily enough , the case of naming batches of streets in newer neighbourhoods looks more like an insult than an honour , being the offhand decision of some sloppy urban planner . 
  the only modern european , purposefully honourable mention that comes to my mind is that of [ dr. fleming ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_fleming ) , in streets in madrid and [ many smaller towns ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/calle+dr.+fleming,+05001+%c3%81vila ) . 
  back in 1985 neither the greek or the french were happy . 
  fast forward to the 2004 enlargement ( poland etc ) . 
  it was the turn for portugal and spain pouting about becoming rich in comparison , losing most of their most coveted cohesion funds . 
  comparative advantage . 
  finland may begin to sell districty lakes to england whereas england might sell unlakey districts to finland . 
  i love how they assume we 'd laugh it off and go on with our lives as somebody thrashes our savings just because we trusted them to a bank in the wrong country . 
  madrid , spain  how common is this where you live ? 
  very common . 
   if you live in a city is it normal to see someone talking into their phone and the whole bus/subway car can hear it ? 
  not normal on subway coaches ( very noisy ) . 
  normal on long distance trains : `` yes honey , the call was disconnected because we entered a tunnel ... errr ... uhhh ... are you still there ?? 
  damn ... ummm ... yes , i mean ... the call was disconnected because ... fuck ''  or while they ride a bike ? 
  no need to make it even more dangerous . 
   do people make personal calls where others can hear them ? 
  yes , fairly often . 
  madrid and never had trouble with tap water anywhere in europe . 
  a permanent conspiracy of the `` anglo-saxon press '' to attack spain whenever they can hurt it the most . 
  thanks a lot . 
  was wondering if it was only spanish languages that were misrepresented ( catalan in teruel !!, 
  basque in northern huesca !! ) . 
  moving on . 
  i love that the graphs let you select and compare spain , i loathe that i could n't select rich ( basically , northern ) spain or poor spain . 
  specifically , multi-devolved government makes for near top-notch pisa results in some regions , near functional illiteracy in some others . 
   also , counting sardinia in the south makes absolutely no sense i believe all we want to compare here is `` poor italy vs. rich italy '' ; current wealth indicators , not geographical latitude or historical quirks . 
  as a matter of fact the `` south vs. north '' dichotomy becomes apparent in italy , and it makes for a more palatable and memorable header . 
  of course we have to leave aside anomalies like the kingdom of sardinia , or the fact that `` southern italian '' pescara is actually north of `` northern italian '' rome !!, 
  edit : * sigh *, 
  spain can into balkan, 
  younger people : have some drinks on the street . 
  older people : have some drinks in bars/pubs . 
  `` est\u00f3mago agradecido '' * grateful * * stomach * , a loyal voter whose livelihood leans on the continuity of some well established political dynasty . 
  they usually live on subsidies or long-term , discretional contracts . 
  abridged for you :  british sceptics are prescient . 
  for the euro to stay , the ecb should disown overborrowers . 
  sadly they wo n't do it , leading to more integration . 
  the funny thing being , abandoning bad ideas when you see they have failed can be a * bad * thing . 
  the currency union might look like a fizzy drink or a poll tax , but these are , maybe , false analogies . 
  shoddy statistics . 
  owning a tv ( second hand sets are virtually free , nowadays ) should n't be on par with being able to pay your debts or eating right . 
  for many years my only exposure to the aragonese or the andalusian accent was through comedians on the publicly funded spanish tv . 
  more often than not , they chose these specific accents to play mentally handicapped or utterly moronic characters . 
  things went from bad to worse with publicly protected private televisions and the realisation that mocking actual people on stage ( like risitas ) was far more profitable . 
  fortunately things changed for me when i left my cocoon and started meeting real andalusian and aragonese people , though in the beginning it was hard for me to take them seriously or even not to laugh at them . 
  in contrast to all this , [ eugeni jofra ] ( https://www.tumblr.com/search/eugeni%20jofra%20bafalluy ) always knew how to earn respect for his public persona and his thick catalan accent . 
  you do n't need corruption for that , just botched policies . 
  for instance , partial subsidies for expensive higher education make it affordable for the well-to-do , but just out of reach for the rest of the people . 
  i agree with your view on the evils of the current system , but the spanish maternity aid is what in english is called a tax break , not a subsidy . 
  tax breaks never reach whomever need them the most , i.e. 
  the people not able to pay taxes . 
  on the other side , they can stay strong no matter how dire the circumstances are , because they only happen if people are already accruing that wealth . 
  subsidies have the nasty habit of becoming unaffordable for the treasury at the worst of times , when subsidies are most needed . 
  that 's great because flags go for $ 2 each , it takes two minutes to hoist one , and spain will need to cling on every concession greece will eventually seize from the eurogroup , the ecb and the imf , and then more . 
  the problem being , i 'm not saying the greek debt is n't impressive , but spain 's debt is - erm . 
  how was your day ? 
  value production is flying elsewhere , people are getting older , europe is turning into not much more than a giant museum , and now these morons are hindering free publicity and shooing tourists away . 
  the original submission is about * naming * a town , and the `` matamoros '' epithet was dropped from the official name of st james as the patron saint of spain * way * sooner . 
  the statue you saw displays the legendary appearance of the very same st james in the battle of clavijo , being earnest at deserving his matamoros title . 
  what somebody chooses to do about displaying that statue is a related , though very different matter . 
  you might get your sources checked for freshness , because from a cursory search i 'm guessing the `` matamoros '' reference has n't been used when addressing james the son of zebedee as `` the patron saint of spain '' , at least since the papal bull * quantum * * ornamenti * ( pope clement xiii , 1760 ) . 
  galicia ( nw spain ) is really thoroughly covered by tesla !!, 
  on your typical sunday night , petrol stations will outnumber tesla stations by only two or three !, 
  yes , i read the article . 
  selling the $ 2.5 coin at its face value would have been defiance . 
  marking it up makes it a mere collectors item . 
  belgium scrapped the $ 2 coins , nobody is defying anybody and this journalist is a sensationalistic prick . 
  thanks goodness it 's 2015 instead of 1915 . 
  uruguay puts into context her outlandish appeal to `` values '' . 
  hope the next lithuanian ambassador to the uk makes better arguments than an infatuated teenager . 
  terribly wrong and obsolete about portugal , and the orange-green checkerboard gives me a headache .
