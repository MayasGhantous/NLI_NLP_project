well , i know that a 1kg bag of rice weights the same as a 1l bottle of water . 
  easy way to see density by comparing the volume with water . 
  how do gallons and ounces relate to pounds ? 
  ** spain ** : emphasis on how me made an empire . 
  left out how we lost an empire . 
  of course !, 
  i agree with that . 
  as i said , i 'd love a set of rules and laws to make it possible and legal . 
  what i do n't like is that `` i chose this day to hold a referendum , and i had 55 % yes so i 'm outta here '' . 
  is that what 's best for everyone ? 
  i mean , now basque country will do the same , just another vote on a random day and cut itself out of spain . 
  but again , what can you do when the ruling party is changing vote laws unilaterally . 
  then what would happen with inter-city roads and infrastructures ? 
  and what about the army ? 
  russia could just invade europe with no problem , just one little country at a time ... of course i see the benefits of small countries , but there 's a lot of loose ends that people seem to forget . 
  my point is ... who gives people the right to do a referendum ? 
  it 's obvious a town ca n't get independence . 
  or a small region . 
  there should be a law to legislate when do you meet the requeriments of population , how often can you ask , how long is the campaign and how much money can you receive from private companies ... just like regular elections . 
  where do we draw the line ? 
  can i secede my house from spain ? 
  ok maybe not my house , what about a small town ? 
  i 've got 501 people wanting independence on a town with 1000 people , that 's enough is n't it ? 
  who says who has the right to be independent ? 
  spain ? 
  catalonia ? 
  my small town ? 
  the issue is more than `` we are being repressed and are not allowed to choose our future '' . 
  it 's more like `` this is something not expected on our laws and they should be changed '' . 
  portugal and italy . 
  maybe southern france . 
  this is also what the police would say if they wanted to stop the press from reporting . 
  yeah , i was kidding . 
  most citizens of ceuta , melilla , gibraltar and the falklands want to stay as they are . 
  you start with the falkland islands !, 
  i feel like i could go bullfighting and eating paella every day and i 'd still not be a `` real spanish '' because i do n't like jam\u00f3n . 
  no idea of what 's pc on english , sorry . 
  some people think it 's not politically correct because catalan , vasque and galician are also spanish . 
  so the pc term for spanish is `` castilian '' . 
  well , ever since i read how different we treat chicken eggs , i 'm no longer surprised to know our food is regulated differently . 
  some people want to see bullfights , some people dislike it as torture against animals . 
  most people are not interested , that 's why i think it will slowly die ( just like churches ) . 
  goddamit , i knew almod\u00f3var would fuck up our image somewhere xd i do n't think i know any spanish who likes his films . 
  they 're too bizarre and too `` spanish '' for us . 
  home of viktor krum . 
  i think we should have had more european geography classes ... 
  i know the names of too many small towns in my country and i ca n't even remember the capital of bulgaria , it 's embarrasing . 
  nope . 
  the royal family has lots of support but they 're not worshipped in any way . 
  not after the corruption scandal , the kid who shot himself , the king 's daughter divorce , the princess rhinoplasty ... 
  i never said it 's reasonable . 
  the majority of the spanish population does n't know much about the crisis . 
  he asked what was the feeling , not what is the reasonable opinion . 
  there 's resentment against goverment and banks , because they facilitated the crisis . 
  and a few of them also have resentment against our fathers , the middle-aged men who mortgaged everything to go on vacations and get a new car every five years . 
  we mostly respect germany for not failing as we have done , but also hate it for asking the government to cut so many social benefits . 
  we understand we are on a tough position and they are our european benefactors , but we hate them for being our bosses and knowing that most money will dissapear on the way by corrupt politicians and wo n't really help . 
  ** spain ** the government party has given the judge the two laptops he required . 
  one has no hard drive , the other has a new hard drive , not the one from factory . 
  also , the government is opposing an ongoing investigation and nobody resigns . 
  yep . 
  spain has existed since 1812 and catalonia has n't been independent since . 
  and neither has it before , too . 
  it was a province on each state it has been part of . 
  it has never had sovereignty . 
  so , it has never been independent . 
  spain is an independent state of the eu . 
  it 's different . 
  that 's because spain did n't exist then ... 
  since spain is called spain , catalonia has been part of it . 
  not that it means that they ca n't be independent , of course . 
  it just means they have n't been yet . 
  as a federalist , i 'm sad about these advances . 
  ca n't we just kick our french corrupt royal family and organize ourselves as a union of independent states ? 
  when ? 
  it was part of the kingdom of aragon , and before that part of the visigode kingdom and roman empire ... 
  i 'd say france or the uk because i already know the language , or portugal or italy where i just could speak spanish . 
  but i do n't think i 'd like the french or british people , by how they 're usually described ... 
  so i 'd take a leap of faith and go finland or denmark . 
  they look nice . 
  i think this issue it 's quite a dirty game . 
  starting point : gibraltar people love being a tax-free colony , spain government hates spanish citizens working and paying taxes to the uk . 
  now uk throws big concrete blocks over the sea , spanish ships ca n't fish there , spain puts `` random searches '' on the border so now there 's a two hour jam to enter the rock . 
  it 's like a silly game of slapping each other on the wrist and i can only see it escalate . 
  good point . 
  obviously this is not like russian but i understand the comparison . 
  i 've lived many years on valencia and i completely get what you mean , people talk in what they want and mixed languages conversations are common . 
  thanks for the explanation , 
   cis , bar\u00f3metro auton\u00f3mico : 8.4 % of spaniards have a concept of spain as a `` state composed by different nationalities and regions '' . 
  the problem is with the phrasing . 
  `` different regions and nationalities '' means that if i said yes i approve independence , but of i said no i do n't like spain to have regions . 
  not fair . 
   you mean , like wert law ? 
  i , as most people on spain , oppose everything wert is doing . 
  but you 're right , he 's dictated directly to a regional issue and that should n't be . 
   a lot has to do with the fact that the castilian-speaking majority is full of peoples that have a very uniformist conception of spain do you have a number on that ? 
  i 'm from the south and neither i nor anyone i know feels there 's nothing wrong with a diverse spain . 
  there 's complaints when a spanish citizen wo n't talk spanish to a spanish tourist , yes , but i think it 's reasonable . 
  i do n't know your regional language , why do you insist on ignoring our common language and making a fuss about it ? 
  the survival of your language and culture depends on the regional government .
