  being right does n't make everyone upvote you , because they do n't always know who is right . 
  when this happens the best you can do is not to shout * `` bullshit !, 
  '' * , instead of that , just show a link . 
  then you 'll be quickly upvoted and the misinformation downvoted . 
  example : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/juan_carlos_i_of_spain#early_life, 
  you are right , juan carlos was 18 and his younger brother was 14 . 
  yes , his grandfather , thanks . 
  every cent juan carlos i inherits should be known by spain . 
  otherwise it is a crime . 
  of course , the king ca n't be prosecuted by law . 
  when his father `` infante juan , count of barcelona '' , died in 1993 , had an equivalent of today 's $ 7 million , including houses and money in switzerland . 
  we all * hope * this will improve with felipe vi and with a clean political party in the government . 
  ~ ~ his ~ ~ [ edited ^ _ ^ ' ] * her * husband . 
  nope . 
  his ~ ~ father ~ ~ [ edited : thanks ! ], 
  grandfather alfonso xiii had hardly anything during his exile . 
  he came to spain with little possessions . 
  juan carlos i fortune is said to come mainly from kickbacks , bribes , gifts and perhaps hidden public funds with the government as an accomplice . 
  ~ ~ juan carlos was 14 and his older brother was 18 . ~ ~ [ wrong ] juan carlos i has a fortune of $ 1600 million , which is * strange * , because his salary has never been greater than $ 280.000 and he should never accept a kickback . 
  juan carlos i loves guns and hunting , and women and money . 
   in any case , your graph still proves my point . 
  are you delirious ? 
  1 ^ st - decreases in employment correspond to the crisis in 1993 and 2008 . 
  2 ^ nd - your ridiculous claim * `` unemployment in spain has always been at its highest during left-wing governments and been reduced during right-wing governments '' * has been clearly disproved . 
  learn something about economy and stop releasing bullshit . 
  there are good austerity measures and bad austerity measures . 
  not against . 
  a gallup survey in 1999 indicated a 40 % in favour , 13 % against the euro ( the rest do n't know or indiferent ) . 
  in 2000 it changed to 33 % in favour , 20,8 % against . 
  we did n't listen to the few critics . 
  julio anguita ( a far-left-wing politician ) spoke about the bad deal for spain if it enters the euro in 1995 . 
  but most people wanted the euro . 
  that 's oversimplistic and actually false . 
  yeah , it 's because of rajoy ... sure ... \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
   they should be thrown out . 
  i ~ ~ know ~ ~ think [ edited ] you 're wrong , but it is a sensitive topic to explain without you feel offended . 
  what you are feeling is xenophobia . 
  it 's a normal feeling , like hatred or anger , and can be controlled finding reasonable solutions to the problem which caused it . 
  there is no place to thrown out them all . 
  the only solution is to integrate them . 
  they are millions , they can not be all completely `` evil '' . 
  with enough time , effort and well thought policies they can be integrate on the long run . 
  these policies do actually exist and work . 
  germany erred in integration policies in 80 's , and i do n't think they are doing a good job now . 
  what germany needs is to improve their plans . 
  blame on * turkish * in general would be useless . 
  the only solution is to improve integration methods . 
  any kid raised in that environment tend to be also violent and disrespectful . 
  germany have a big problem , and must continue to increment efforts to integrate immigrants , especially those with a different culture . 
  germany seems to be the country which is more worried about immigration ( a 76 in qa3a is impressive ) . 
  why are you worried about immigration ? 
  actually there are three important keys in spain : economy , separatism and podemos . 
  economy : there is a slow economy recovery . 
  how much time will oil remain so cheap ? 
  will european policies help spanish economy ? 
  will the eu - dominated by pp and psoe allies - punish spain if podemos continue growing ? 
  separatism : this wo n't end well . 
  there is the problem of lack of dialogue plus the economic issue : europe has not a common fiscal federalism , so any region that is above his country 's average wealth level benefits from fiscal independence . 
  podemos : podemos has not * yet * overtaken psoe , and that 's actually very important . 
  real leftist new policies and anti-corruption reforms comes from podemos . 
  psoe is just a shadow of itself . 
  now , the psoe must decide : - option 1 : pact with `` podemos '' plus the separatits and accept the referendum . 
  10 % chance . 
  - option 2 : grand coalition pp + ciudadanos + psoe . 
  10 % chance . 
  - option 3 : new elections . 
  80 % chance . 
  very good picture . 
  but should be renamed to * `` cloud of smog over madrid '' * . 
  includes some misinformation , at least about spain :  rise of the anti-establishment podemos party , anti-establishment ? 
  really ? 
  what 's next ? 
  stalinist ? 
   the partido popular was well positioned to remain in government following elections scheduled for late 2015 nope . 
  elections were last sunday 20th december and with this results pp would need either the support of the psoe - it 's historic rival , quite improbable - either another elections . 
   spain ( ... ) , and is in robust recovery . 
  robust recovery ? 
  the oil is cheap and we are importers , euro depreciates and that favours us , but we have still about the same active population than 4 years ago -25.000 less workers than in november 2011 - and 90 % of new contracts are temporary . 
  actually 24 % of the contracts signed in 2015 are 7 days or less in duration . 
  spain got this year deficit of 5 % and and has reached a debt of 100 % of gdp . 
  recovery , yes , but not robust . 
   in general , the us south receives $ 1.39 for every $ 1.00 in contributions impressive and very interesting data . 
  germany is also a federal republic consisting of sixteen federal states , and some states receive more they contribute . 
  inside germany there is fiscal federalism , and some states receive more they contribute . 
  but they do n't want the same to all the euro-zone . 
  germany is not in the mood to accept greece receiving $ 1.39 for every $ 1.00 in contributions . 
  so we got a problem . 
  different countries can not have the same currency and , at the same time , having fiscal independence . 
  the poorest will suffer and eventually be destroyed . 
  obviously . 
  although without some fiscal and political reforms great britain wo n't get the euro and france will eventually leave . 
  germany is also a federal republic consisting of sixteen federal states , and some states receive more they contribute . 
  inside germany there is fiscal federalism , and some states receive more they contribute . 
  fiscal union - or fiscal federalism - is mandatory for any zone which shares the same currency . 
  second option : countries inside the eurozone which do n't want a fiscal union should leave . 
  germany first . 
  germany has been the main problem here ; they are good workers but terrible bad leaders , terrible bad understanding others problems , terrible bad about fair economy , terrible bad finding solutions , and the eu is doomed to collapse if they are in command . 
  germany is the real problem and should return to the deutsche mark . 
  does that happen in the us ? 
  do people from misisipi pay very low taxes ?
