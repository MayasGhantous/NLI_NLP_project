  in my opinion something not so different to the us fiscal federalism could also work in the eu . 
  why not . 
  richest countries wo n't gladly lose his current privileged fiscal situation , and they will quickly claim they are being `` robbed '' by the pigs . 
  if there is not advancement in fiscallity , then greece , portugal , an probably spain or italy or ireland or even france should just abandon the euro to regain the control of their economy . 
  we need fiscal union for anyone who uses the euro . 
  rajoy does not vocalize well . 
  it 's not galician accent . 
  he just tend to speak too quickly and pronounce `` sh '' instead of `` s '' . 
  instead of saying `` spain is a nation '' he says `` spain * ish * a nation '' . 
  pedro sanchez does speak much more clearly . 
  his problem is more he has not great debate skills . 
  just to clarify this has nothing to do with any political party : the aggressor is a 17 year , problematic and hyperactive male . 
  he is called `` the captain '' . 
  although usually behaves normally , has a history of violence and fights in some cases when * he lost his mind * . 
  it is a misfit , with temporary psychological attacks , and has been bullied in the past by several classmates . 
  he is under medical treatment . 
  no criminal record . 
  he is a hooligan , a strong fan soccer team of his city . 
  belongs to a group of fans called `` mocidade granate '' - which has completely condemned the aggression - . 
  in political ideology is radical leftist , nationalist , separatist and republican . 
  note that every political party has completely condemned the aggression . 
  his family is wealthy and had problems in private schools with other students . 
  now attends a public school . 
  the only relationship with `` podemos '' is that he carried in his pocket an advertising of `` la marea '' , but frankly i doubt he would vote for them , since in his twitter he seems to be more near to other political party . 
  pp is the most corrupted party . 
  and ciu is catalonia 's pp . 
  both know what means 3 % . 
  the whole country must work in order to improve the spain 's economy . 
  andalucia is n't decadent , actually is the third in gpd and in research and development , after madrid and catalonia , and has some brilliant students and competent workers . 
  health insurance costs are mostly on hospitals and in health personnel : andalucia build their own hospitals with their own money and pays their own health insurance . 
  big problem with andalucia is unemployment . 
  too much dependent on construction instead of industry . 
  you 're right in that , but the highway problem is a corruption case . 
  who seems to be the conspirators ? 
  spain 's government ( pp/psoe ) , catalonia 's goverment ( ciu ) `` la caixa '' and `` acesa '' . 
  corrupted expresident jordi pujol is incredible rich because of shit like that . 
  no fiscal autonomy with the same currency . 
  we need fiscal union for anyone who uses the euro , not fiscal autonomy for some . 
  you should calm down then . 
  about the aleixasv picture : madrid is even in a more extreme tax situation than catalonia . 
  it gives away double in taxes than catalonia . 
  municipal sports centers are paid by the municipality , and it 's much cheaper to build one in the * fucking middle of albacete * than in barcelona . 
  salaries are easy halved , the terrain is often already municipal and it creates local jobs for the zone , so people do n't mind the waste . 
  the data you are managing ignore the fact taxes are progressive . 
  catalonia contributes more because people earns more . 
  last elections in andaluc\u00eda : psoe : 35.4 % ; pp : 26.8 % ; podemos 14.8 % ; ciudadanos : 9.3 % ; iu : 6.9 % what are your concerns ? 
  do you have a work and a good salary ? 
  are you a free-lancer ? 
  are you against separatism ? 
  what do you think about corruption ? 
  about sending troops to syria ? 
  about pooverty ? 
  about the cost of electricity ? 
  if you know spanish , the webpage http://aquienvoto.org/ could help you know which party is more convenient for your ideals , even if you can not vote . 
  pp : current government . 
  right wing , the most corrupted , catholic , old party . 
  psoe : old left-wing party , now more in the center-left . 
  too many corruption cases , spetially in andaluc\u00eda ( eregate ) . 
  podemos : new , left-wing party . 
  made by people for people . 
  fight against corruption , make left-wing policies and have a heavy state ( like norway or denmark ) . 
  ciudadanos : center liberal party . 
  at the economic level is very liberal ( like the us ) , at the social level is open-minded . 
  it will low taxes for the wealthier and subsidize minimum salary jobs . 
  actually this article from `` elpais.com '' includes misinformation . 
  about podemos : * `` elpais.com '' * links to an article which accuses ceps foundation of giving * millions * to podemos . 
  this has been completely denied ( 1 ) and proved wrong : podemos has all it 's accounts perfectly clear ( 2 ) . 
  the financial problem is n't with podemos - a political party made by people for people - but with some media including `` elpais.com '' ( 3 ) which are funded by investment groups with interests and has strange relationships with others political parties , receiving public funding and lobbing laws . 
  example : `` elpais '' is an important member of the `` aede '' , the main media lobby behind spain 's new intellectual property law , which caused google to close google news in spain ( 4 ) . 
  aede wanted google and any webpage to pay them just to have the right of including links . 
  podemos is the only big political party who has in his program to derogate this ridiculous law which provoked google news spain - and many other webpages - to close ( 5 ) .

  the eurofighter started as a collaborative project thought by uk , germany , france . 
  italy and spain joined it . 
  but france did n't like how uk and germany were leading the eurofighter so they left the group to develop the rafale instead . 
  rafale is the * eurofighter * france really wanted for their aircraft carriers . 
  turkey has something like 2 million sirian refuges , but all the eu ca n't accept 120,000 . 
  120,000 is the 0,023 % of ue total population . 
  one refugee for each 37.4 km ^ 2 . 
  120,000 is half the number of casualties in the sirian war to the moment . 
  -- edit : the downvotes indicates / r/europe is mostly visited by neofascists . 
  perfect example of cordial dialogue with catalonia which will decrease their independentism :  the only thing it makes sense is as an effect of seeing the grass ( and the money ) greener on the other side of the border blinding judgement . 
  let petty hatred of madrid guide you , and complain only when you are being ripped apart by the wolves . 
  why should we worry , spain will always be there to bail out catalonia . 
  like the master and the slave , the more dependent you are on spain the less respect for it you have . 
  it wo n't probably be legal even if they had the 100 % . 
  the problem is that the government of spain has refused to establish a dialogue or to allow a referendum as happened in scotland . 
  catalan separatists are tired of being ignored and no longer recognize the authority of the spanish constitution . 
  oh , the irony !, 
  they wanted to be independent , but they did n't have an army large enough to stop castile , so desperate sought help in france . 
  one king for another . 
  about catalan being nowadays near extinction , that 's fud . 
  they would speak french and catalan , as they now speak spanish and catalan . 
   do they really think they can be self-sufficient country without spain ? 
  as it could be scotland without england . 
  catalonia is a civilized industrialized country . 
  if spain and eu are against it 's independence , they will suffer a lot in the process . 
  if spain and eu agree to collaborate , independence would n't be a big issue . 
  the second does n't seem likely to happen . 
   also what with this so desired independence ?
