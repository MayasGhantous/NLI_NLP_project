wow , that makes australia sound as my kind of place . 
  and i 'm not being sarcastic . 
  i find hard to believe that a country that is a `` multiculturalism happy story '' has such an insane amount of derogatory terms to people of non-anglo ethnicities . 
  i was expecting some references to `` wogs '' . 
  disappointed . 
  yes , it includes the irish for uk , and the germans/austrians for austria/germany . 
  if you want another source , this is the [ oecd data from 2013 ] ( https://data.oecd.org/chart/4wtc ) . 
  which sources ? 
  the official number of spaniards in uk is much , much lower than that . 
  moreover , i would disagree with the idea that uk has a huge amount of foreigners . 
  according a report of the house of commons from 2014 ( www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/sn06077.pdf ) , 12.5 % of the uk population is foreign-born . 
  that 's less than austria ( 16.6 % ) , ireland ( 16.1 % ) , belgium ( 15.8 % ) , sweden ( 15.9 % ) or even spain ( 12.9 % ) . 
  it 's slightly higher than germany ( 12.2 % ) , netherlands and france ( 11.5 % ) . 
  in conclusion , the amount of migrants living in uk is pretty standard for a western european country . 
  i do n't have any sympathy for afd , but doing this is wrong . 
  and i do n't mean only in a `` we-should-respect-them '' way : it 's a lousy political strategy . 
  afd will love the opportunity to play the victim . 
  essentially , all spain was moorish . 
  some for short ( the north ) , some for long ( the south ) . 
  and the region were the moors staid for longer ( andalusia ) is the poorest . 
  of course , this is not related with the fact that the moors staid there so long . 
  the ssa score for spain is to be expected given its geographical position . 
  barcelona is south of rome ; seville is south of palermo . 
  spain , longitude-wise , is like south italy . 
  and the ssa score of spaniards is very similar to southern italians ( 1.79 % - 1.54 % ) . 
  that document offers another very interesting data on this question : the middle eastern score . 
  that 's probably the ethnicity/geographical situation that most of people associates with the `` moors '' . 
  spain scores weirdly low : 14.57 % . 
  north italy , for example , has a 22.20 % . 
  spain is more similar to croatia , with a 14.12 % . 
  some time ago i read an article that concluded that most of african genes in southern europe came from the roman times , and not from the middle ages . 
  the genetic impact of the moors in spain was pretty limited for two reasons . 
  first , the north africans were always a minority even in al-andalus . 
  second , post-reconquista spain was not exactly a multicultural state . 
  jews and muslims were forced to convert to christianity : many preferred to leave . 
  the ones that staid were always under the scrutiny of the [ spanish inquisition ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf_y4mbucly ) ; accusations of being a `` crypto-muslim '' were not uncommon in the 16th century . 
  this finally evolved into the [ expulsion of the moriscos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/expulsion_of_the_moriscos ) in 1609 , in which the descendants of the muslims were expelled from the country . 
  the cultural impact is far bigger than the genetical one . 
  in spain at least , many people have an undeclared job while searching for a declared one . 
  we should just adapt statistics to the reality of the country . 
  someone employed in the grey economy is not unemployed , even if he does n't pay taxes . 
  i would give a more clear example of this . 
  from around 1996 to 2010 , spain lived a period of huge economic growth . 
  [ the foreign-born population ( migrants ) jumped from 2.96 % ( like hungary ) to 14.3 % ( higher than germany and usa ) ] ( https://data.oecd.org/migration/foreign-born-population.htm ) . 
  and all this with official unemployment levels of around 10 % . 
  it 's very , very hard to believe . 
  comparing not paying taxes with rape is pretty out of place , btw . 
  it makes sense when the unemployment rate is also used for calculating other issues , like the poverty level in a country . 
  someone working in the grey economy is not paying taxes , but he is not in abject poverty , either . 
  a country in which 20 % of the population do n't have any source of income is very different from a country in which 10 % do n't have any source of income and the rest just do n't pay taxes . 
  really ? 
  my experiences are hardly data , but the indians i have met tend to like britain . 
  well , given that [ most of the countries of the world have been colonized or occupied by britain ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02388/britain_2388153b.jpg ) , then i guess you believe that britain has a very big trouble . 
  fortunately , no country has anything against the british these days . 
  i think southern europe should find a new way of calculating unemployment . 
  i 'm not saying that se does n't have more unemployment than the rest of europe : but i do believe that these numbers are impossible . 
  in se working while being officially unemployed is much , much more common than anywhere else in europe . 
  data should reflect this , too . 
  spain stronk !, 
  said this , the north is not doing amazingly better . 
  catalonia , for example , has a higher unemployment than any other european region , except sicily , calabria and the greek ones . 
  the basque country has the status of `` nationality '' within spain ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basque_country_ ( autonomous_community ) ) . 
  it 's not ( or not only ) a region . 
  out of curiosity : is the scottish flag forbidden too ? 
  if not , why is it ok for scottish to bring their flags and not for basques ? 
  edit : ok , apparently the scottish flag is forbidden too :  pinknews has asked for clarification on whether this means the scottish saltire or australian aboriginal flag would be banned . 
  a spokesperson confirmed that neither would be permitted , adding : `` scotland is not a member of the un so therefore the flag does not comply with the policy . '' http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/04/29/eurovision-bans-political-waving-of-rainbow-flags-during-russian-entry/ that 's ... wow . 
  0 surprises on that one . 
  renzi is showing a clear political will of being ( or at least trying to be ) a strong man in europe . 
  writing hollande and `` strong man '' in the same sentence hurts my fingers . 
  anyway , if you want to see something humiliating , check the position of the 5th economy of the eu : spain . 
  of course they do n't have a f ****** idea . 
  the internet is [ a series of tubes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/series_of_tubes ) , is n't it ? 
  oh , now i understand that the liberal [ left ] meant venstre . 
  then everything makes sense . 
  i did n't suggest that the parties are `` old geezers '' . 
  i do n't know where in my text i imply that . 
  so eu was to compete in tech innovation ? 
  and this is the plan ? 
  good luck with that . 
  i work in tech and i have spent a few years in the start-up world ... the european scene is a disaster , at least if we compare it with its american counterpart . 
  one friend of mine started a business in spain , and it was successful ... so successful that he got american investment , and one of the conditions was to move to the states . 
  now the company is based in california , [ where it closed a 11m $ round a little more than one year ago ] ( https://novobrief.com/redbooth-investment/ ) . 
  that would be absolutely impossible in europe . 
  another example : my current employer is an `` american '' company ... founded by three danes in copenhagen less than 10 years ago . 
  now it has more than 1500 employees and it 's a publicly traded company . 
  it 's a fairly typical `` european start-up success story '' . 
  in summary : trying to be a tech `` big '' one in europe is like trying to be a soccer superstar in the us . 
  i 'm comparing population in the metropolitan area , not in the urban area . 
  according eurostat data from 2014 [ 1 ] : - milan metropolitan area 4,267,946 - rome metropolitan area 3,700,000 let 's compare this with istanbul-ankara . 
  data from 2014 [ 2 ] : - istanbul 14,377,018 - ankara 5,152,072 [ 1 ] : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_metropolitan_areas_in_europe [ 2 ] : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metropolitan_municipalities_in_turkey#list_of_metropolitan_areas, 
  not so much . 
  rome doubles milano 's population . 
  including the metropolitan areas , milano is bigger , but just a tiny bit . 
  as you know , istanbul is much , much bigger than ankara . 
  yes , but they ca n't pass new laws , as the new parliament wo n't approve them . 
  franco 's regime was many things , but `` unresponsive '' was not one of them . 
  too much responsive , if you ask me . 
  that would make countries as different as pakistan , zimbabwe , jamaica or ireland `` english '' . 
  thanks for your post .
