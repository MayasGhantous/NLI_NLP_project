  in spain , except the acknowledgement that corruption is a big problem and that we need some kind of `` change '' , there is no agreement on anything . 
  right now , vox is the biggest far-right party in spain . 
  this does not mean much : they got 0.23 % of the votes . 
  just to give you an idea : the `` animalist party against animal mistreatment '' got 0.87 % . 
  and which are the necessary reforms ? 
  you mean after pia , do n't you ? 
  i always feel very puzzled when someone applies moral categories to monetary policies . 
  if southern european economies lost competitiveness since the adoption of the euro is not because that 's `` how they really are '' ( ??? ) . 
  using `` the printer '' is a sensible policy in many occasions : just ask the americans . 
  long run ? 
  of how many decades are you talking about ? 
   freedom of movement however has broad support , mainly because you do n't need your passport to ** get wasted in lloret de mar ** . 
  good that catalonia is a force for the cohesion of the union . 
  are younger citizens also against freedom of movement ? 
  the other difference is that in the case of denmark , the eurosceptics were for maintaining the status quo : keeping the complete opt-out . 
  the ones that lost were the establishment ( the main political parties ) , not the status quo . 
  in the case of breivik , he is being mainly treated as a `` madman '' , not as the political terrorist he is . 
  i mean , he was a member of the main far-right party of norway for seven years . 
  he even occupied some positions in the party 's youth organization . 
  this party , the `` progress party '' has had no problem to continue operating very successfully in norway after the massacre , getting 23 % of the votes in the last elections . 
  ah , i 'm very pale too ; but in my experience there are many turks who are pale . 
  i have to admit that this surprised me when i travelled to istanbul ; i guess i was imagining a magical `` tan barrier '' between greece and turkey , lol . 
  is people in eastern turkey more tanned ? 
  oh , men - probably drunk - shouting stuff at me in the train . 
  once the guy got particularly insisting , but then realized i had no idea what he was telling , asked to me where i was from , and left when i told `` spain '' . 
  old women also tended to stare at me in the street and the public transport , but that was only annoying , not dangerous . 
  anyway , the most spectacular problem that i had with being taken by muslim , and in particular by turk , happened in vilnius . 
  my girlfriend is from lithuania , and we decided to spend a couple of weeks in the capital . 
  when we arrived to our host place ( airbnb ) , the owner , an old woman , decided to take my gf apart and explain to her that `` she should n't waste her beauty with a turk , as she could find something better '' . 
  lovely . 
  in spain , i used to wear a beard . 
  when i moved to denmark i was taken for turk a few times . 
  i would n't have cared much , except for the fact that this implied some risks to my physical security . 
  since i shaved my beard , it has never happened again . 
  turks can speak german and ask us to pay our debts . 
  translation : `` the little tanned nazis are spaniards ... the dumbest in europe , the shortest ones too '' . 
  it certainly helps . 
  the possible victory of brexit must feel like christmas for the english far-right nutsos . 
  they were the firsts that supported brexit . 
  they believe that this is the start of the `` brexit revolution '' . 
  it may get worse after the referendum . 
   it 's a shame so many of your tech workers have to fight to relocate . 
  i 'm relocating to sf next month . 
  the `` dossier '' i have to give to the american embassy is more than 200 pages long . 
  it 's a fight , indeed . 
  [ there is a similar party in denmark . 
  ] ( http://universitypost.dk/article/national-party-isn-t-actually-national-party ), 
  btw , the list is wrong . 
  at least spotify has more revenue than some of the companies in that list : it makes close to 2b $ , which would set it as the 19th . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.statista.com/statistics/244990/spotifys-revenue-and-net-income/ ) . 
  spoti was my first wild guess . 
  i would n't be surprised if there would be more . 
  i work in tech , and in particular i have a lot of experience in the `` start-up '' world . 
  this data is well-known in the sector . 
  imo , in the first place it 's related with the lack of venture capital in europe comparing with the states . 
  many european companies have to relocate to the us as part of an investment deal . 
  another important issue is cultural : europe is more protectionist , and that does not work very well in a sector where innovation is everything . 
  look what is happening with uber , for example . 
  counting rebate and all , france gives much more in absolute and per capita terms than the uk . 
  you can find the data [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/interactive/index_en.cfm ) in the `` operating budgetary balance '' spot . 
  operating budgetary balance for 2014 : - france : -7.614 m / -115 euros per capita - uk : -4.929 m / -77 euros per capita, 
  the public answer is wrong . 
  the poll is for the total population of france , not about north of paris . 
  as any brexiter will happily tell you , a part of the money that immigrants win is send to their countries . 
  moreover , many of these educated people end up returning home after some years living abroad . 
  in any case , i wanted to ask you a question : how do people in mississippi feel about their educated people leaving for california ? 
  will they come back to make their state a `` success '' ? 
  and why californians are not asking to kick out those pesky southerners ? 
  i mean , for sure someone is losing in this usassr thingy . 
  selling at a loss is illegal in the eu , you are right . 
  however , it is still possible to run on a minimum benefit , which outperforms the local competitors anyway . 
  demonstrating predatory pricing is pretty hard . 
  there are multiple ways . 
  one is using the sheer size of the companies that operate in bigger and richer markets . 
  i will give you an example : imagine a german supermarket chain that sets itself in a small european country , like lithuania . 
  during the first year , the said company operates with very low prices , with minimum benefits in every sale . 
  they can do this because of their size : the benefits in other markets cover the operations in the new one . 
  of course , the local competitors ca n't do that , and disappear . 
  once there are no competitors , the german company can increase prices and recover the losses . 
  freedom of movement is absolutely necessary for the workers of the poorer countries in the eu ; and `` poorer '' in this context means more than 15 countries . 
  it 's the `` price '' for richer countries to pay for basically destroying their local competitors in the poorer countries . 
  freedom of capital without freedom of movement ? 
  to me , it sounds like becoming a colony * de facto * . 
   the majority of those would be russians born in latvia who do n't qualify for latvian citizenship , right ? 
  yes . 
  the same goes for estonia . 
  it 's true , but la also wanted to join the same european group , the alde . 
  they were just not able to get into the european parlament . 
  i quote from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberal_alliance_ ( denmark \\ ) ) :  the liberal alliance announced that it would join the alde group after future european elections . 
  [ 39 ] however , the party failed to achieve representation in the european parliament in both the 2009 and 2014 european parliament elections . 
  it would be interesting that the comparison between radikale and cs would be backed first - as it was suggested first - but yes , i can back it . 
  - cs is positioned in the center-right by its own supporters and most of spaniards according cis - spain 's main sociological organism - . 
  you can check this in the following [ plot ] ( http://s6.eestatic.com/2016/02/04/actualidad/grafico_99751387_779997_1706x1373.jpg ) . 
  this is something that cs shares with la and not with radikale . 
  - this positioning is probably because the main ideological point of cs is economical liberalism . 
  under my understanding , radikale and la are also economically liberal , but only la has it as its main political point . 
  i follow radikale in a few social networks , and most of their posts these days are about caring more about the refugees , a position that for me it 's hard to imagine in cs . 
  are you comparing radikale venstre with ciudadanos ? 
  as a catalan living in denmark ... no , not really . 
  they are much more similar to liberal alliance , in my opinion .
