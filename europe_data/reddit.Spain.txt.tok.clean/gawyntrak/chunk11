  moreover , denmark has a political culture of pact that it just does not exist in spain . 
  everytime that i switch on the news i see that the socialdemocrats and the naz ... df have agreed on something . 
   why has n't eu investment worked in spain ? 
  ( edit portugal as well ) eu investment in spain has worked pretty well . 
  spain is one of the recipient countries that gets less per capita and it 's projected to become a net contributor before 2020 . 
  are you planning to leave the imf too ? 
  what 's next ? 
  nato ? 
  the solar system ? 
  are you a troll ? 
  well , i will answer anyway : - most of brit students wo n't be able to go to switzerland to erasmus . 
  switzerland is simply not big enough . 
  - you are clearly cherry-picking the `` top 20 '' limit . 
  if you check the top 300 , you will see that british students will lose access to 90 top universities . 
  of those 90 , switzerland has only 7 : that 's less than 8 % of the total . 
  - this is apart from the fact that talking about `` top universities '' in general is a pretty bad idea . 
  many universities are very good in particular subjects of certain fields . 
  - finally , the erasmus programme is more about the international experience than the quality of the hosting university . 
  a `` switzerland-only '' international programme is ... well , not very international . 
  the eu does not scream `` more migrants '' . 
  some countries in the eu do so . 
  in particular two , who happen to be neighbours of denmark . 
  however , it 's much more popular in denmark to blame the eu than to blame sweden and germany . 
   potential loss of access to erasmus . 
  [ ... ] we could deal with this by setting up our own erasmus style deal with switzerland brexit thinking in a nutshell . 
  it professionals are in demand in germany - like almost everywhere else - , but salaries are pretty low comparing with us , or even with uk and denmark . 
  i was too drunk to remember . 
  tallinn 's port is something to be seen . 
  beer was almost exclusively sold in 4x24 packages ; with a little trolley included in the price for transportation . 
  i have never seen so many people drunk as there . 
  according [ this article ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/pensioners-earning-more-than-the-average-worker-new-analysis-says-a6701851.html ) , the average british pension is 398gbp per week . 
  that 's 2200 euros per month . 
  even assuming that this means after taxes , this quantity of money makes you middle-high class in spain . 
  not rich , much less `` very rich '' . 
  the prohibition was deep enough to go as far as forbidding catalan names . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/language_policies_of_francoist_spain ) :  `` the use of non castilian names for newborns was forbidden in 1938 , except for foreigners . '', 
  it 's pretty well known that johan cruyff called his son `` jordi '' ( catalan version of `` george '' ) because of this reason . 
  from [ espn ] ( http://www.espnfc.com/blog/espn-fc-united-blog/68/post/2836616/jordi-cruyff-on-father-johan-cruyff-growing-up-and-football ) :  `` he knew that the name jordi was outlawed , but franco 's influence did n't extend to the netherlands , so his son was named jordi . 
  [ ... ] jordi thus became the first `` legal '' jordi in decades '' i guess wikipedia and espn are part of the catalan oligarchy too . 
  i sincerely doubt that british pensioners are `` very rich '' by spanish standards . 
  average spanish salary is 2.026 euros per month ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/spain/wages ) . 
  is the average british pension significantly higher than that ? 
  well , the rate of `` success '' is not really comparable . 
  like many-millions-to-zero not comparable . 
  what a pile of junk . 
  the article only includes two pieces of data . 
  both are incredibly wrong : - `` southern europe is in a ` massive depression ' '' . 
  no country in southern europe is technically in recession , much less in a `` massive depression '' . 
  no , not even greece . 
  - `` unemployment is over 20 % in spain , portugal , and italy '' . 
  unemployment rate in portugal and italy is clearly below 20 % ( 12.4 % and 11.4 % ) . 
  almost all polls right now give advantage to `` remain '' : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_united_kingdom_european_union_membership_referendum . 
  of the last 10 , one gives advantage to `` leave '' ( this one ) , two show a tie , and 7 give the victory to `` remain '' . 
  you can also check the full history of the polling with a nicer interface here : https://ig.ft.com/sites/brexit-polling/ . 
  of course , this can change in one month ; or maybe most polls are wrong . 
  however , that does not change the fact that the `` poll signal '' points to `` remain '' now . 
  ethnicity is a pretty wide concept . 
  it can imply cultural identity , but it can also imply racial identity . 
  it depends of the ethnic group . 
  edit : anyway , i just modified my comment to point that when i talk about ethnic identity , i mean ancestry/racial identity . 
  well , actually that 's my point . 
  if valls can become `` ethnic french '' through the way that he carries himself , then it 's possible to become french through culture . 
  well , `` nymphomaniac '' totally enters in my ... in everybody 's idea of a french , does n't it ? 
  :d like in woody allen 's movie : \\ - with you its all nihilism , cynicism , sarcasm , and orgasm . 
  \\ - hey , in france i could run for office with that slogan , and win !, 
  so xavier valls , anne hidalgo and nicolas sarkozy - just some examples that came to my mind - are not french . 
  am i right ? 
  thanks for the question . 
  this is an issue that has made me think a lot in the last years . 
  it 's also one the main reasons why i 'm leaving the country where i live now , denmark . 
  i consider myself catalan . 
  i was born in barcelona . 
  my father 's family has lived in catalonia for many generations . 
  however , my mother is from andalusia . 
  i never thought that this could even imply any conflict with my condition as a catalan . 
  that applied for me , but also for children of two immigrants parents , even from out of spain . 
  the thing is that , in spain ( and in catalonia ) nationality is tied to cultural identity , not ethnical ( as in racial or ancestry ) identity . 
  suggesting that a children of immigrants who was born in spain , speaks spanish and acts spanish is not spanish is considered very - like very - racist . 
  a first-generation immigrant that assumes the spanish culture will be considered spanish by the vast majority . 
  i had always assumed that this conception of nationality was the norm , at least in the `` civilized '' west . 
  fast-forward to 2014 . 
  i got an offer from an american company to relocate to denmark . 
  i accepted it , and i still live in copenhagen . 
  here i discovered that what i presumed was the norm did n't work at all . 
  i met people `` born and raised '' in denmark ... who have problems to consider themselves danes , because their parents are not danes . 
  from a spanish/catalan perspective , this is surprising , and very disturbing . 
  when asked , they tend to doubt and answer something like `` danish citizen ? '' . 
  moreover , they do not have a particularly strong attachment with their parents ' country . 
  culturally they are clearly not from there . 
  i remember the case of a `` dane-polish '' , who told me that , when he visited poland , he realized that he has a very strong danish accent speaking his `` mother language '' ; he is an outsider there too . 
  i do n't see myself living as an outsider the rest of my life . 
  i do n't see myself raising my kids as foreigners in the country where they were `` born and raised '' . 
  from my perspective , this is a deal-breaker with a country . 
  i respectfully disagree . 
  i agree with you in that `` ethnic nationalism '' has more weight in the old world than in the new world , but i do n't think that it 's the prevailing view . 
  it 's certainly not the prevailing view in spain . 
  i would say that it 's not prevailing in france and uk , either : the current prime minister of france and the former opposition leader of uk are not `` ethnical nationals '' . 
  in northern and eastern europe ethnic nationalism may be more important , though . 
  i have a lithuanian friend who has exactly this problem . 
  he 's fair-skinned , but has black hair and dark eyes .
