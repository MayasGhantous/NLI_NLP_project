  from time to time he gets trouble for that . 
  usually they shut up when they realize he speaks lithuanian . 
  the meps per capita are very , very different . 
  moreover , i ca n't find any logic behind the distribution : - france - mep per 892k inhabitants - uk - mep per 878k inhabitants - spain - mep per 873k inhabitants - germany - mep per 840k inhabitants - italy - mep per 816k inhabitants - poland - mep per 755k inhabitants, 
  danish immigration policies are as populist as hungary 's or poland 's ; at least these days . 
  the main issue with your comment is that denmark is not an `` immigration country '' , as you believe . 
  only 8.5 % of the population of denmark is foreign-born . 
  you can contrast this with germany ( 12.8 % ) , belgium ( 15.5 % ) , sweden ( 16.0 % ) or even spain ( 13.4 % ) . 
  i mean , danish immigration levels are literally closer to hungary 's ( 4.5 % ) than to any of the countries that i just mentioned . 
  according oecd data , the only eu-15 countries that have less immigration than dk are finland and greece . 
  you can check it here : https://data.oecd.org/migration/foreign-born-population.htm . 
  despite having significantly lower levels of immigrants than other western european countries , danish media gives a lot of attention to migration issues . 
  like a lot . 
  more than in spain or uk , that have higher levels of immigration . 
  and of course , the media reports any kind of stuff with an insane sensationalistic tone . 
  for example , i live in a pretty peaceful neighbourhood of copenhagen : nice bars , pretty quiet . 
  according the media , it 's a sharia zone . 
  the integration minister came the other day to swear she will protect the danes in my neighbourhood from the imaginary sharia . 
  everything really sensible . 
  if it 's about `` latin vibes '' ... compating `` european latins '' and the `` american latins '' has a lot of game . 
  as a barcelonian that loves sf ( i 'm moving there soon ) ; i agree . 
  there are many similarities : weather , liberal politics , hipsterism ... 
  the tech scene in sf is vastly superior , but it 's vastly superior to anywhere in the world anyway . 
  thanks for your comment . 
  i had similar feelings about the us when i visited it : that its racism is exaggerated . 
  i was positively surprised of how welcoming are the americans . 
  do n't worry , i always say san fransiskou . 
  wow , pretty good . 
  san francisco . 
  san francisco . 
   i had heard exactly the same think about cuba from a cuban . 
  `` why have you come here ? 
  are there only jobs for bullfighters in spain ? '', 
  - doctor in denmark `` oh , spanish ??? 
  your players are shit , they are flopping all the time . '', 
  - drunk basketball fan in lithuania, 
  oh , it does n't offend me . 
  it just ... feels weird . 
  in spain , unfortunately , there is a certain racism against south americans . 
  i would n't say that is something huge , but from time to time you meet a moron that starts to throw shit on `` sudacas '' . 
  i think this attitude are slowly disappearing , thanks god . 
  the weird feeling comes from becoming a part of what in your country is considered more or less a `` minority '' . 
  i 'm going to san francisco . 
  the example that you are putting is really good ; but i do think that the amish are wrong using `` english '' for any non-amish . 
  so far , the word `` spanish '' is relative to spain . 
  words do have a meaning that ca n't be changed by an individual , or a ( small ) community . 
  moreover , the imaginary cultural identity is not the one that they share with other us hispanics , which is very much real . 
  it 's the one that they imagine they share with other spanish-speakers out of the us . 
  essentially i 'm worried about suffering from racism . 
  landlords not wanting to rent to me , police `` double-checking '' me when they listen that i have a spanish accent ... stuff like this . 
  the `` how is it possible that you do n't eat tacos in spain ? '', 
  can be irritating , but bleh . 
  i 'm going to san francisco . 
  i have spent some time in the city before ( 3 weeks ) ; i loved the place and i had no trouble . 
  however , 3 weeks is a short time . 
  * imaginary shared cultural identity * . 
  out of the us , this `` shared cultural identity '' does not exist . 
  do you know it by personal experience ? 
  how was it ? 
  with all this trump shit i 'm kind of worried . 
  that 's what i thought in the beginning , but according the census , spaniards are `` hispanic '' * . 
  there is even a subcategory in `` hispanic '' for catalans !, 
  and well , it does n't make any sense for many reasons . 
  i would say that nowadays spaniards have much more in common with the other european countries than with latin america . 
  moreover , in spain we had a `` trumpesque '' phase , blaming `` latino '' immigrants for crime , in particular gang crime . 
  to be `` put '' into what in your country is a minority is ... disturbing . 
  and ironic , i guess . 
  * : officially , however , the u.s. government has defined hispanic or latino persons as being `` persons who trace their origin or descent to mexico , puerto rico , cuba , central and south america , and other spanish cultures '' . 
  this includes spain and portugal which is the origin of hispanic/iberian culture . 
  i 'm moving to the us in july and i 'm pretty disturbed by this `` latino/hispanic '' concept . 
  it does n't make any sense . 
  it only includes the `` fp superior '' : http://infofpe.cea.es/fpe.php?section=c62 . 
  the `` fp medio '' , which i believe is by far the most common one , is considered secondary education . 
  paradoxically , spain also has more people with a high level of education than the average of the eu . 
  41 % of spaniards have tertiary education , against 37.9 % of average in the eu ( in between 25 and 34 ) . 
  [ you can see it here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2h10oul.png ) . 
  as others are commenting , the spanish job market is pretty broken in two parts : the educated ones , most of them with college degrees ; and the non-educated ones that did n't even finish the basic level of education . 
  i guess it can seem incredible for foreigners , but quoting han solo : `` it 's true . 
  all of it '' . 
  right now , almost a decade after the end of the bubble , it seems impossible even for us , who lived those times . 
  and yeah , affording a bmw was not so hard for people working in construction . 
  getting loans was easy and , as incredible as it may seem for someone who is not spanish ( or italian ) , many of those youngsters were living with mom and dad while working and driving a bmw . 
  according those polls , afd is moving up very fast . 
  i think you are confusing it with the greens . 
  both lines are green . 
  are you around people of a different race often ? 
  i guess this is the ranking : http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/safety/ according it , usa is safer than denmark or switzerland . 
  i find it ... peculiar . 
  that 's weird . 
  i 'm 1.75 , and i tend to be slightly shorter than average . 
  what happened in the baltics in 2009 ? 
  yes , i know it 's the year of the financial crisis , but -14 `` growth '' ?? 
  ( the original comment , now deleted , stated that before ww2 eastern europe was richer than southern europe , and that now things were going back to how they were ) . 
  source for that ? 
  i have never listened anything like this , and the only source that i have found indicates the contrary . 
  the gdp per capita ( ppp ) in 1913 is : - italy 2,564 - spain 2,056 - eastern europe 1,695 - former ussr 1,488 - portugal 1,250 and in the 1870s : - italy 1,499 - spain 1,207 - portugal 975 - former ussr 943 - eastern europe 937 the division of countries is a bit messy , but that 's expectable in a list of `` historical gdps '' ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_regions_by_past_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita ) . 
  so no , according this data , the prewar distribution was the same as now . 
  ** edit ** : i have found a list with better granularity . 
  it offers data for 1925 and 1938 . 
  i will use the 1925 , as 1938 is not really `` pre-war '' for spain ; we already knew [ what was being bombed by the luftwaffe by then ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_guernica ) .
