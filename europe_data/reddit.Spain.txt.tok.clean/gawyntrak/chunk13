  - czechoslovakia 504 - italy 480 - baltic countries 443 - spain 426 - greece 393 - hungary 365 - portugal 320 - romania 316 - bulgaria 304 - yugoslavia 302 - poland 245 - russia/ussr 232 so in general , the south performs better than the east . 
  cities happened . 
  in fact , spain has a higher population density than ireland or greece ( and sweden ) . 
  spaniards tend to pile on the big cities . 
  that 's why we are the country with most elevators per 1000 people and with most people living in apartments ( http://qz.com/273214/how-spains-bloody-history-gave-it-the-worlds-highest-concentration-of-elevators/ ) . 
  i live in n\u00f8rrebro , a neighbourhood in copenhagen famous for the quantity of immigrants . 
  i see women wearing niqabs daily . 
  it 's less popular than the hijab , but by no way it 's uncommon . 
  i am very surprised by some redditors suggesting that chacon was minister only because she was a woman . 
  chacon was a big name in the socialist party for some years , getting pretty close to leading it in 2012 ( got 48.8 % of the votes in the [ primaries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/38th_psoe_federal_congress ) ) . 
  you do n't get there thanks to positive discrimination . 
  my understanding of your point is that when two population intermix enough , independence does not make sense as cultures `` blend '' . 
  my point is that this happened in latvia ( also in estonia ) and well , independence made sense for them . 
  why is important if russia/spain were empires or not ? 
  i do n't see your point . 
  spain was an empire too . 
  what you just told can be applied to some independent countries . 
  latvia was part of russia for 300 years until 1989 , with a brief period of independence in between the wars . 
  in 1989 , 34 % of latvia 's population considered themselves `` russians '' . 
  nowadays , around 40 % of latvians have russian as their native language . 
  do n't tell a latvian that they should be incorporated into russia , though . 
  it 's not in my country 's media = it does not exist that would make `` flanders independence '' a non-issue for us . 
  i guess i live in a different catalonia . 
  there are plenty in spanish . 
  the catalan independentist movement got stronger during the late 2000s/early 2010s , probably because of the [ repeal of parts of the catalan autonomy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_catalan_autonomy_protest ) . 
  at some point the international media started to report it , which i guess it 's what makes you think that it was a `` non-issue '' before , in the same way that flanders is a non-issue for me . 
  you can find data for intra-eu migrations . 
  given that the data is always reported by the `` receiving '' country , it 's more reliable . 
  spain has a very `` positive '' eu-migration rate , meaning that there are more eu citizens living in spain than spaniards living in other countries in the eu : - eu-28 citizens living in spain : 1,934,315 - spaniards living in the eu-28 * : 602,587 only germany and uk have higher positive immigration rates . 
  * : numbers for malta and cyprus are not included , but they are probably negligible . 
  this article takes into account foreign-born naturalized spaniards , while the plot does not :  these numbers do n't properly account for fleeing foreigners . 
  in 2012 , 162,000 foreigners left spain , 83 % of the total number of emigrants , according to the think tank . 
  the graph in this post does not count naturalized citizens : `` number of people born in the given country ... '' . 
  moreover , even assuming that the article is right and the same phenomena does not happen in other countries , spain would still have low levels of population living abroad . 
  the difference in between the article 's data and ine 's is of 500.000 ; that 's 1.1 % of spanish population . 
  if you add that to the current number , you have a 3.7 % , which is still one of the lowest numbers in europe . 
  our low classes are * only * interested in sports . 
  therefore the most sold newspaper is marca , a sports-only football-mainly paper . 
   it lowered because lots of people either leave spain , move to another category ( not employed ) or something else . 
  i would say that during from 2010 to 2014 unemployment did n't go further in part thanks of migration . 
  however , in the total of the last two years spain has a positive migration rate ( meaning more people arriving that leaving ) , so the improvement in unemployment ca n't be because of that . 
  tourists or erasmus , probably . 
  according eurostat , there is a total of 1040 spaniards in the czech republic . 
  [ reddit did n't let me publish a fb link the first time . ], 
  my wife is from one of `` those countries '' and shares the same opinion . 
  moreover , i have been to a few erasmus parties in ee ( my then-girlfriend was in [ esn vilnius ] ( http://vu.esnlithuania.org/ ) ) and it always surprised how many lithuanian/southern european couples i saw . 
  i mean , one of the most popular clubs for erasmus is called [ salento ] ( https://www.tripadvisor.com/attraction_review-g274951-d4749251-reviews-salento_discopub-vilnius_vilnius_county.html ) , lol . 
  according my wife , lithuanian guys complain about erasmus guys putting `` spaghettis on the girls ' ears '' to pick them up . 
  i imagine that latvia is similar to lithuania in this matter . 
  some of my latvian friends ( who are girls ) confirm . 
  i 'm afraid that in northern italy there was a stronger `` racism '' against southerners than in catalonia . 
  `` terrone '' is still a thing in italy , while the equivalent in catalonia ( `` charnego '' ) sounds like a word from the 70s . 
  according wikipedia :  xarnego is a pejorative or descriptive term * used primarily in the 1950s-70s * in the catalonia region of spain to denote a person who had immigrated to catalonia [ ... ] the word is never used to refer to the latest wave of immigrants from outside of spain - it has a historical nature . 
  it 's true that catalans with non-catalan parents tend to be `` unionists '' more often , but assuming that everyone that has non-catalan ascendancy is unionist is completely wrong . 
  even some of the leaders of catalan independentism have non-catalan parents : carod-rovira and gabriel rufi\u00e1n , to give two examples . 
  catalan nationalism is mainly cultural , particularly about the language ; nobody gives a flying f * ck about where your parents came from . 
   here at least girls seem to avoid anyone even remotely brown like plague . 
  not really . 
  in my experience , guys of the mediterranean type tend to be pretty popular in ee , including latvia . 
   following the eurocrisis , it was italians , greeks , spanish , portuguese moving to the uk oh , the dutch obsessed with southerners again . 
  there are more germans in uk than spanish and italians combined ( 322k vs 242k , [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign-born_population_of_the_united_kingdom ) ) , when spain and italy combined have more population . 
  so no . 
  the irony of all this is that spain has * much more * british immigrants than the other way around ; the majority of them of working age . 
  edit : increase in foreign-born population in the uk by country ( 2001-2015 ) : - poland : 642.339 - lithuania : 112.498 - romania : 81.771 - slovakia : 62.508 - portugal : 62.412 - latvia : 61.771 - germany : 56.084 - france : 53.591 - bulgaria : 46.524 - italy : 44.546 - hungary : 43.007 - spain : 36.697 - netherlands : 28.051 - greece : 4.531 moreover , the extra-eu migration to uk is very important . 
  increases of around 300k from india , 200k from pakistan , 150k from china . 
  it will , for sure . 
   one advise : every time that you meet a valencian tell them `` los valencianos en el fondo sois catalanes , no ? '' . 
  it 's a traditional greeting , they will love it . 
  this is only the top 20 . 
  the index in 2015 included 75 countries : you can find it [ here ] ( http://www.futurebrand.com/uploads/cbi-14_15-lr.pdf ) . 
  netherlands is 13th ? 
  where ? 
  i fail to see your point . 
  you compare three countries that * are * in the g20 with one that is not . 
  your analysis shows that the missing one is superior to some of them in one aspect ( arguably , the most important ) . 
  how does that prove that the missing one should not be in the g20 ? 
  he meant that the `` nordic union '' would be `` close '' to italy . 
  it would not . 
   [ the nordic union ] would leave the netherlands and spain far behind and get close to the economy size of italy your gdp would be much closer to the spanish one than to the italian : - italy : 1.852.500 millions of us$ - nordic union : 1.454.909 - spain : 1.252.160 - netherlands : 769.930 and that 's in nominal , which gives pretty peculiar results ( like canada being `` bigger '' than russia ) . 
  in ppp : - italy : 2.289.578 - spain : 1.763.430 - nordic union : 1.428.254 - netherlands : 898.732 [ source 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( nominal \\ ) ) [ source 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp \\ ) ), 
  why ? 
  spain is in general more developed than portugal in the main indexes ( more gdp per capita , better hdi ) . 
   if you look at deficits you can see that italy , greece and portugal had deficits ( far ) above 3 % between 2000-2007 . 
  i just did that . 
  average deficit per country for 2000-2007 : - spain : 0.34 % - netherlands : 0.64 % - germany : 2.38 % - france : 2.66 % - italy : 3.01 % - portugal : 4.44 % - greece : 6.38 % [ source ] ( https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-deficit.htm ) greece and maybe portugal had deficits `` far '' above 3 % . 
  not italy , which had deficits more similar to germany or france than to greece or portugal . 
  as commented , spain was pretty fiscally `` responsible '' during this period . 
  as you can see , the countries of the `` south '' behaved in wildly different ways . 
  moreover , the `` exceptions '' ( italy and spain ) are bigger and more significant than the `` rules '' . 
  all this in an already very odd group : greece is very different from the other three culturally and historically . 
  that 's why southerners get so salty about it : generalizations based on exceptions on an artificially created group . 
  nah , not really . 
  southern european debt started to increase as a result of the crisis , and not the other way around . 
  you can check it in [ the oecd site ] ( https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm ) . 
  as you can see , the spanish state had lower levels of debt than netherlands and germany until 2010 . 
  in fact , spain and italy * reduced * their debt after the euro was created . 
  portugal and greece increased it , but not in a very significant way . 
   sweden did not participate in 2013 pisa rankings . 
  this comment is quite ... funny . 
  yeah , sweden did not participate in the `` 2013 pisa rankings '' , neither in the 2013 olympic games ; mainly because both events are imaginary .
