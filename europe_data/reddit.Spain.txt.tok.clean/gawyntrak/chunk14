  however , sweden did participate in the 2012 pisa rankings ( which were presented in 2013 , hence the confusion ) . 
  pisa is performed every three years . 
  as 2a95 says , sweden improved quite a lot in 2015 comparing with 2012 . 
  - maths : +16 points and 14 positions higher . 
  - science : +8 points and 10 positions higher . 
  - reading : +17 points and 19 positions higher . 
  you can check all the ratings in [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/programme_for_international_student_assessment_ ( 2000_to_2012 \\ ) #pisa _ 2012 ), 
  it 's not . 
  rotterdam 's example ( even if wilders finally lost by 800 votes ) is a good one . 
  moreover , it 's a quite common phenomena in modern politics : social-democrat blue-collar voters going for right-wing populists . 
  it happened in the rust belt in the us , with former factory workers going for trump ; it happens in denmark , where danske folkeparti 's base is basically former socialdemocrats . 
  if you check the demographic of the pvv voter , you will see that they tend to be less educated , and have lower salaries than your average voter ; in other words , the traditional blue-collar social-democrat voter . 
  where have i said that pvv profited * most * from pvda 's loss ? 
  link ? 
  on who won in rotterdam , i had read it in a few newspapers ( mirror , express ) ; and it 's still in [ wilders ' twitter account ] ( https://twitter.com/geertwilderspvv/status/842140829267435521 ) . 
  it might not be true , though : as i commented before , i have not been able to find the final results divided by city . 
  pretty standard , i would say . 
  i live in the us , and if someone would say '' [ ethnic x ] waste their money on alcohol and women '' , it would be considered hate speech . 
  like a text-book case . 
  are you sure ? 
  there is an article in the mirror titled `` far right geert wilders ` wins rotterdam as holland 's second largest city votes for pvv ' '' . 
  i ca n't link it because of the subreddit policy . 
  i do n't the final results divided by city or district , though . 
  edit : [ wilders himself ] ( https://twitter.com/geertwilderspvv/status/842140829267435521 ) . 
  you are right . 
  he is saying `` southerners spend their money in women '' , which is obviously the same thing as saying `` southerners fuck prostitutes '' . 
  if erdogan tomorrow proclaims that `` modern netherlands is like germany in the 40s '' i think everyone would get what he means . 
  dijsselbloem can criticize whatever he wants , but i find his preoccupation with spain pretty peculiar . 
  why not criticize countries that are closer to the netherlands and are more indebted ? 
  [ belgium , for example : 106 % debt to gdp ratio ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/belgium/government-debt-to-gdp ) . 
  moreover , [ france 's level of debt ( 96.1 % ) ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/france/government-debt-to-gdp ) are basically the same as [ spain ( 99.2 % ) ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/spain/government-debt-to-gdp ) . 
  this is particularly disturbing when netherlands was running a higher debt than spain until the middle of the crisis : 2010 , in particular . 
  he is projecting . 
  the figure of the northerner tourist that gets drunk and fucks prostitutes is pretty common in spain . 
  to depict foreign population with a particular evil character is the most typical mechanism of hate speech and xenophobia . 
  `` spaniards fuck whores '' is hate speech in the same way that `` dutch are nazis '' is . 
  `` southerners spend the money we give them in prostitutes and alcohol '' seems to me the definition itself of xenophobia . 
  dijsselbloem is only respectable for those who are ok with his open xenophobia . 
  it 's not the first time he causes an scandal in southern europe . 
  about successful , well , let 's say that given pvda 's recent results , i have a different definition of success . 
  by the way , according spanish press , when asked about the sentence ( the mep was reading it ) he answered :  `` no , no , you do n't have to read me my statement , it came out from this mouth [ pointing it ] , so you do n't have to read it to me '' . 
  it does n't seem `` half a sentence with poor context '' . 
  he stands behind his statement . 
  dijsselbloem is not new to these openly xenophobic and nationalstic speech , which is pretty clearly the main magnet for pvv . 
  in spain he is more famous than rutte `` thanks '' to this . 
  pvda has lost votes to many parties , but it 's pretty likely that pvv is one of the biggest winners here . 
  take rotterdam , for example : a city governed by pvda which has been won by pvv in the election . 
  there is a certain type of blue-collar worker , who votes traditionally for pvda , which is leaving it for pvv . 
  most of people that love dijsselbloem when he does this kind of stuff should be honest with themselves and vote for pvv . 
  well , actually that 's what is happening already . 
  the poster : [ tintin and the brexit plan ] ( https://shared.yellowgrey.com/2017/01/21/tintin-and-the-brexit-plan/ ) . 
  ** eu officials mock britain with anti-brexit tintin poster on wall of brussels war room ** europe 's top brexit officials have made clear their view of britain 's bleak prospects in the forthcoming article 50 negotiations by hanging a mocking poster on the walls of their brexit war room . 
  a brussels source spotted the satirical poster hanging framed on the walls of the european council 's brexit task force meeting room . 
  the picture , a mocked up tintin book cover entitled `` tintin and the brexit plan '' became a social media meme earlier this year among remain supporters . 
  the image reflects the view among many top eu officials that brexit is an act of economic self-harm by the uk that will become apparent in the course of the negotiations . 
  many top eu officials and political leaders still hope that britain might yet decide to think again about brexit when confronted by the economic trade-offs that come with leaving the eu single market and rejecting the jurisdiction of the european court of justice . 
  `` if the ship is sinking , is it not only natural to call for rescue ? '' said one senior eu diplomatic source . 
  `` we are still not giving up hope that the united kingdom decides not to leave us . '' next wednesday theresa may will trigger article 50 , formally notifying donald tusk , the president of the european council , that britain intends to quit the eu . 
  the european council , which corrals the eu heads of government , will then respond with a statement , setting guidelines and a detailed mandate for the two-year negotiation . 
  while britain hopes to secure the outlines of a future trade and security relationship with europe , the eu has said it wants to nail down the terms of the uk-eu divorce settlement - including demands for as much as # 50bn - before talking about the future . 
  this week jean-claude juncker , the european commission president , warned that britain may have to abandon its hopes of a trade deal if it rejects the terms offered by the eu . 
  the uk will have `` the choice to eat what 's on the table or not come to the table at all '' , mr juncker said in an interview with bild am sonntag , the german tabloid . 
  mr juncker added that the choices forced on britain by brexit will bring the other 27 eu member states closer together , as they will `` realise it 's not worth leaving '' . 
  putting aside the deep divisions among eu member states on immigration , the euro and social policy that have been on display in recent months , mr juncker said brexit would spur a rebirth of the european project among chastened remaining members . 
  `` they will all see from the uk 's example that leaving the eu is a bad idea . 
  on the contrary , the remaining member states will fall in love with each other again and renew their vows with the eu , '' he said . 
  [ funny comment removed following orders of my eastern european wife ], 
  bleh , as others say , the line in between dialect and language is quite blurry . 
  i agree that portuguese/spanish/catalan / occitan/italian are pretty similar , to the point that speakers of one understand the other ( more or less ) . 
  if you are for ... `` widening '' the borders of what a dialect is , that 's fine for me , but taking the catalan/spanish case is pretty complicated ( as it 's very politicized ) . 
  the vast majority of people that say that catalan is a dialect of spanish would see portuguese as a very different language . 
   they compare a rather arbitrarily chosen list of words . 
  no doubt , but it 's certainly better than comparing literally three sentences . 
  that 's the definition of anecdote itself . 
  i also invite you to check the [ family tree of romance languages ] ( https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/romance_languages#family_tree_of_romance_languages ) , where catalan is pretty distant to spanish . 
  however , i guess that 's not scientific enough either . 
  only the comparison of your three sentences complies with the highest standards of science . 
  conclusion : catalan is the first language that proves schr\u00f6dinger thesis . 
  similar enough to spanish to be just a dialect of it , but different enough for people to need schools in `` spanish '' ( i mean , in a different dialect of spanish ) . 
  linguistic taxonomy is significantly more scientific than comparing three sentences . 
  in fact , it 's kind of the same that you just did , but in a more methodical way and with a much bigger sample . 
  you should explain why catalan and spanish are ( `` as close as '' ) dialects while spanish and portuguese , or spanish and italian are not . 
  i do n't think it 's misleading . 
  you are right that charles v was more german than spanish , but `` charles v-only '' territories are not included in the map . 
  [ southern italy was part of the spanish crown ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_naples ) for centuries , until the beginning of the 18th century ; the same applies for [ part of netherlands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_netherlands ) . 
  no , not really . 
  in fact , according [ the ethnologue ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lexical_similarity#indo-european_languages ) catalan shares slightly more vocabulary with italian than with spanish . 
  according the same source , catalan has a lexical similarity coefficient of 0.87 with italian , and 0.85 for spanish and portuguese . 
  italian and french have more , a 0.89 . 
  moreover , catalan is * very * similar to occitan , the language of southern france . 
  when i say very i mean that catalan was considered a dialect of occitan until the end of the 19th century , and now they are considered [ part of the same subfamily ] ( https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/romance_languages#family_tree_of_romance_languages ) . 
  anecdotically , i can read occitan much easier than i can portuguese or italian , it `` feels '' like medieval catalan . 
  the irony is that there are people who say that occitan is a dialect of ... french . 
  it 's pretty common to see americans in barcelona walking with mexican sombreros and asking burritos for dinner . 
  man , rotterdam does not sound like a very nice place to live , with such a big pvv/denk vote . 
  with rotterdam counted , pvv is basically tied for the 2nd place . 
  wait until the americans discover that you were under spanish domination for some time , and they will start asking for `` traditional tacos '' in amsterdam too . 
  well , i certainly expect soldiers on a mission to fight if needed . 
  they were in a war , not doing tourism . 
  and no , srebrenica was not a shame mainly for un .
