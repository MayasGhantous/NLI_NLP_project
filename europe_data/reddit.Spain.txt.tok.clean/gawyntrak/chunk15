  i quote wikipedia :  the dutch battalion `` dutchbat '' was found guilty by the courts in the netherlands of failing to protect some of the bosniak refugees in the safe area . 
  [ ... ] * it was the netherlands and not the un that had effective control of dutchbat . 
  i live in sf . 
  i see barcelona ( 42nd ) ranking higher than madrid ( 51st ) , i upvote . 
  sf is amazing city , in my opinion . 
  great weather , very multicultural , lots of things to do ... and all this in the world capital of tech . 
  i have lived in other cities that rank higher ( copenhagen ) , and i prefer frisco , hands down . 
  if the idea was to measure the impact of the eu in spain 's growth , a bigger sample should be taken . 
  for example , [ this one ] ( http://voxeu.org/sites/default/files/pradosdelaescosura_fig1.png ) . 
  and , as you can see , the spike was short-lived and very small in historical terms . 
  the growth tendency starts in the late 50s , early 60s . 
  because the plot is from 1950 to 1990 . 
  spain was in the eu 5 years of this plot . 
  during the other 45 years , spain was not in the eu . 
  well , spain joining in 1986 did not affect the economical performance of spain for most of this plot . 
  i do n't think it 's related with the eu in this case . 
  this . 
  another , contemporary example : the official name of [ luxembourg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luxembourg ) is the grand duchy of luxembourg , and its monarch is the [ grand duke ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monarchy_of_luxembourg ) . 
  in my experience mexicans get triggered if someone calls them `` south americans '' . 
  never understood why . 
   same sex union is equal to married couples in everything except adoption and name of union itself . 
  so it 's not the same . 
  having the same name is important for equality . 
  the migratory flow spain-uk has always been mainly from uk . 
  there are 300k brits in spain for less than half the number of spaniards in uk . 
  nah , last year we got back to net positive immigration ( meaning more immigrants than emigrants ) so it 's certainly not migration . 
  ireland is literally the eu country with the lowest overstaying rate ( [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_waiver_program#eligible_countries ) ) . 
   unfortunately lots of poles do overstay thier visas . 
  no , not really . 
  only 1.49 % of poles overstay their visas ( [ source ] ( https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fy%2015%20dhs%20entry%20and%20exit%20overstay%20report.pdf ) ) . 
  that 's under the threshold for the visa waiver program . 
  the issue is visa refusal rate , which depends completely on the american side . 
  any country could arbitrarily reject all visas for americans and then use that to justify no vwp for americans . 
  to be fair , i do n't think wine is the unhealthiest thing that houellebecq likes . 
  best wines in the world are ribera del duero , and [ my favourite french person agrees with me ] ( http://www.subzin.com/quotes/m16370060e3/l%27enl%c3%a8vement+de+michel+houellebecq/a+%22ribera+del+duero%22 . ) . 
  moreover , * sangria * is for the foreigners and is not even wine . 
  i completely agree with the doing crazy stuff now . 
  my idea is to go back home at some point , but i like to be able to work abroad . 
  first i was in denmark and now in the us . 
  anyway , i would not recommend denmark . 
  salaries sound nice , but dk is a very expensive country ; bars and restaurants in particular are price hell . 
  my local purchasing power did n't increase much with the move ; the difference is that i could make cooler trips . 
  moreover , during the last 15 years denmark has become a very nationalist , anti-immigrant country ; it 's the complete opposite of sweden . 
  imagine that in spain vox becomes the second biggest party of the country and then psoe and pp start to imitate vox nationalist policies , which makes vox to go further right . 
  even europeans are looked with suspicion and discriminated against . 
  us ( in particular the west coast ) is another story , but it 's harder to get in . 
  do n't you find anything in the it market in spain ? 
  with which technologies do you work with ? 
  genuine curiosity . 
  oh , come on . 
  most of high-skilled foreigners can do better than a country where anti-immigration feeling is so rampant as denmark . 
  better economically and personally . 
  i guess because it 's not into ethnic nationalism the way most danish parties are . 
  that 's a technique that is used everywhere ; and it 's good journalism . 
  the issue here is the obsession with villaca\u00f1as ; there are probably many other towns in the same situation . 
  i would bet that they are copying each other . 
  anglo media is kind of obsessed with villaca\u00f1as . 
  this is literally the fifth time they publish something about this town , that has 10k inhabitants and it 's something like the 700th city of spain . 
  a sample : - [ the independent ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/how-the-recession-closed-the-door-on-a-spanish-boom-1639271.html ) - daily mail has an article that i ca n't link ( sub policy ) titled `` doorway to despair : glimpse inside spanish industrial ghost town that produced seven million doors a year which has been decimated by housing crash '' - [ the guardian ... with a full photo report !, 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2012/nov/30/spanish-unemployment-crisis-in-pictures ) - [ even in fivethirtyeight ] ( https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/men-are-more-likely-to-live-with-their-folks/ ), 
  well , corruption-wise i do n't believe that ciu is very different from the two main parties of spain . 
  anyway , i think he was talking about the ideology of the party . 
  ciu was not even a totally conservative party : they were half-liberal ( converg\u00e8ncia ) , half-conservative ( uni\u00f3 ) . 
  on the contrary , i would say that because spaniards know that it can happen here ( because it happened ) , they feel much less comfortable with far-right candidates . 
  why is ciu not respectable ? 
  genuine curiosity . 
  a brief ( and personal ) summary of the reasons : - profound skepticism towards rightwing authoritarianism caused by recent memory of franco 's regime . 
  - a welfare system that , while granting generous access to core services such as health and education , offers little in the way of social housing and direct support payments . 
  as a result , headlines about foreigners claiming benefits and migrant families living off welfare are rare in spain . 
  - a divided national identity that makes it hard to tap into a common `` spanish pride '' against migrants . 
  ** regional focus ** a political appeal to spanish national identity is further complicated by the long-running tensions between the central state and its regions , specifically catalonia and the basque country . 
  many catalans and basques claim a national identity that is not just distinct from the spanish one but in direct conflict with it . 
  both regions have strong secessionist movements that hope to eventually achieve statehood and independence from spain . 
  for any rightwing movement seeking to activate nationalist sentiment , that presents an immediate problem . 
  if its leaders try to tap into spanish pride , they risk losing support in two crucial regions that account for almost a quarter of the total spanish population . 
  if they appeal exclusively to catalan or basque national identity , they shut themselves out of the rest of spain . 
  at the same time , the political conflict between spain and the regions has allowed the ruling popular party , led by mariano rajoy , to protect its rightwing flank without stoking or pandering to anti-immigrant sentiment . 
  `` the pp has been able to remain a catch-all rightwing party , in part because it has a strong message about defending the unity of spain . 
  that is a key issue for rightwing voters , '' says crist\u00f3bal rovira kaltwasser , a political scientist at diego portales university in santiago , chile . 
  spain 's centre-periphery tensions aside , analysts also highlight a welfare system that grants generous access to core services such as health and education but offers little in the way of social housing and direct support payments . 
  `` you do n't have this conflict between natives and non-natives over welfare that you have in other countries , '' says jos\u00e9 fern\u00e1ndez-albertos , a political analyst at the csic research centre in madrid . 
  `` spain has pretty good public services but when it comes to housing and cash benefits it 's very weak . 
  and those are precisely the areas where it becomes visible that the state is making transfers from one sector of the population to another . '' as a result , headlines about foreigners claiming benefits and migrant families living off welfare are rare in spain . 
  `` part of this is always about competition for resources . 
  when there are no resources to compete for , the potential for conflict decreases , '' says sergi pardos-prado , a researcher at oxford university . 
  it is an argument that goes hand-in - hand with another feature of spain 's crisis : the fact that migrants were usually hit much harder than the native population , which could rely on family networks to cushion the blow . 
  foreign workers had no safety net to fall back on . 
  it was , as mr fern\u00e1ndez-albertos points out , `` objectively difficult to argue that spain treated its migrants too well during the crisis '' . 
  back in villaca\u00f1as , that is certainly the impression of hard-hit locals . 
  at the height of the boom , migrants accounted for 5 per cent of the town 's population -- but their share has decreased markedly in the years since . 
  `` when the crisis came , most of them just left , '' says mr garc\u00eda aranda . 
  looking ahead , most experts voice confidence that spain will continue to resist the populist far-right surge . 
  most of the factors that explain the country 's exceptional status are deeply rooted in its history and society , and are therefore unlikely to change in the short term . 
  what is more , spain is in the midst of recovery -- annual growth in gross domestic product hit 3.2 per cent last year -- suggesting that some of the social and economic pressures will recede . 
  for the leaders of europe 's political centre , the story of spain after the crisis offers a glimmer of hope -- but not much more than a glimmer . 
  the spanish exception is less the result of smart politics than of historical accidents and complex social trends that are hard to replicate . 
  policymakers in berlin , brussels and london will find plenty to admire in the country 's resilience to the populist backlash -- but not a lot to copy . 
  ** no right turn for spanish politics ** * despite an economic meltdown rightwing populists failed to gain a foothold in the country . 
  why ? 
  * villaca\u00f1as still bears the scars of spain 's economic crisis .
