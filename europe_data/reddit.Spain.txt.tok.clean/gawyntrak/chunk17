  tell to a black french that he has a different culture than his paler compatriots . 
   despite our diversity as a european living in the us , i have a lot of problems with the so-called `` diversity '' in the us . 
  in europe , diversity means people speaking different languages and who have been raised with different traditions . 
  in the us means people speaking the same language , being raised the same way but with different levels of melanin . 
  remember that this party is the second biggest in denmark ; this guy is not just some madman . 
  all this argument seems based on the idea that this kind of stuff `` helps '' the alt-right . 
  that 's not the case in spain , where the alt/far-right is essentially non-existent . 
  we have very recent memory of what happens when the far-right bunch gets power ... and no , thank you . 
  note that they are referring to celebrating it in a christian way :  martin henriksen , the danish people 's party ( dpp ) immigration spokesperson , said going to church would put new arrivals `` on the right track '' . 
   `` we believe that those who come to this country should make as much effort as possible to become danes , and to do that you need to understand christianity and its importance to danish people , '' he told the jyllands posten newspaper . 
  that 's only one poll , there were also polls showing trump winning ( la times ) . 
  realclearpolitics , that aggregates all polls , [ gave her +3.2 ] ( http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html ) . 
  in the end it was +2.1 ( as you know , hrc won the popular vote ) . 
  the polls were quite accurate predicting the popular vote in the us . 
   as for spain , it 's pretty obvious that the euro is biting them in the ass and that they are more of a liability to the other members than a contributing member . 
  it 's certainly not obvious to me . 
  there are 13 countries in the eu that are more of a liability than spain from the economic point of view . 
  and yet , it 's the country where silicon valley is located the one that voted for trump and implemented the `` muslim ban '' . 
  if the eu does not have a sv is not because our immigration policies are too strict . 
  us ones are much worse . 
  what do you mean ? 
  call it `` media content generator '' if you prefer . 
  i do n't have bbc in my tv , but i 'm consuming its content everyday . 
   spanish soap operas ... and finnish matryoshkas . 
  yeah , we totally need some kind of european tv to learn about each other . 
  why ? 
  according oecd , germany is substantially safer than most of ee countries . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/safety/ ) . 
  anecdotally , i feel safer in frankfurt or hamburg than in warsaw or riga . 
  the two main countries of origin for immigrants in spain are morocco and romania . 
  if we count latin america as a `` country '' , that would be the third . 
  do you really think that moroccans , romanians and colombians come to spain to retire ? 
  yeah , spain is full of retired romanians and moroccans . 
  he would be an argentinian , or more specifically a swedish argentine . 
  it 's not very uncommon , argentina has a pretty big colony of northern european descendants . 
  they even have their own page in [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_argentine ) . 
  that 's mostly wishful thinking , i 'm afraid . 
  sd does n't want to leave the eu ? 
  this makes it sound like the `` danes '' of foreign ascendancy are the ones that do n't want to be `` danes '' . 
  in my experience living in denmark , it was more like the contrary . 
  a few months ago there was a debate in public tv ; a danish-born student ( iranian father , danish mother ) called jens philip yazdani talking with martin henriksen , immigration spokesman and mp of the main right-wing party in denmark . 
  when the student defined himself as `` danish '' , the politician answered that it was `` an insult to those generations who built up this country '' . 
  i would summarize the situation as follows : - i was born in denmark , i eat * lakrids * every day , i can pronounce * r\u00f8dgr\u00f8d med fl\u00f8de * flawlessly . 
  i am danish . 
  - your parents are not danish , and you do n't look danish , how can you say that you are danish !, 
  this is an insult to the people that built denmark in the past !, 
  it makes me sad , but i guess i am not danish . 
  - you do n't want to integrate !, 
  funny coming from a country that legalized gay marriage later than spain . 
  well , i guess it 's normal : you are also part latin , are n't you ? 
  at this point spain is catholic in the same way that france is ... not really . 
  i think catholicism lost strength in spain because of a historical strategic mistake . 
  during the dictatorship , the church was extremely close to franco . 
  after his death , francoism became taboo ( similar to how communism is seen in poland ) and this discredited the church as a `` player '' . 
  moreover , the spanish church is particularly backwards comparing with the vatican . 
  nowadays the only news i read about them is when a bishop says something disgusting like [ `` teens raped by priests were provoking '' ] ( http://www.infobae.com/2012/05/17/648177-polemica-espana-un-obispo-aseguro-que-los-adolescentes-te-provocan/ ) . 
  i guess the best way to compare it with poland would be to imagine the church being 50 years in the bed with the communists , in a total symbiosis . 
  and after the fall ... the backslash . 
  spain is one of the most lgbt-friendly countries in the world ... in fact , 90 % is too low in my experience . 
  - [ the country that 's most accepting of homosexuality ? 
  spain ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/06/the-country-thats-most-accepting-of-homosexuality-spain/276547/ ) - [ spain is the world 's most lgbt-friendly country ] ( http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/19631/1/spain-is-the-worlds-most-lgbt-friendly-country-pew-research-centre-poll-finds ) it was also the third country in having gay marriage ( after netherlands and belgium ) and the third in having adoption for gay couples ( after netherlands and sweden ) . 
  lolz , i doubt there is a place with more andalusian blood than catalonia , bar andalusia of course . 
  the main point of macron 's candidacy is that he is an economic liberal , someone who would make france attractive for liberal professionals like scientists . 
  you are right . 
  i remember one statistic showing that spaniards had a worse image of their own country than foreigners , while most of countries had a better image on themselves than foreigners . 
  to be fair , italians are the same . 
  you are cherry-picking countries . 
  the most `` equal '' country according your own data is the czech republic . 
  the third most `` equal '' is slovenia . 
  not the most `` sexy '' economies of the world . 
  if we want to make a fair comparison here in between countries with a similar gdp ( ppp ) per capita and very different levels of equality , the comparison should be between czechia ( 34.767 $ ) and spain ( 38.095 $ ) . 
  czechia 's gdp ( ppp ) is only 9 % lower than spain 's ; sweden 's is more than 30 % higher than ours . 
  spain 's gdp ( ppp ) per capita is already higher than the italian according the same source . 
  check it in [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp \\ ) _ per_capita ) . 
  actually the difference in betweeen we countries is smaller than i expected . 
  portugal and greece a bit worse , though . 
  in denmark you also study for free . 
  in fact , you get paid . 
  my wife got her master like this . 
  spanish politicians like to say that spain is one of the cheapest countries to study in the eu . 
  it 's a rotten lie . 
  you can check [ this comparison ] ( https://www.studyineurope.eu/tuition-fees ) . 
  basically yes : [ strong 2016 growth brings spain close to pre-crisis economy ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/01/30/world/europe/ap-eu-spain-economy.html ) . 
  or 19.500.000 rubles . 
  ee spends more in their armies than we , as a percentage . 
  because russia . 
  thanks for your comment . 
  sincerely , thanks . 
  i found the data . 
  you can find it [ here ] ( http://nabarra-aurrera.info/index.php/57-informe-del-cis-sobre-espanolidad ) . 
  catalans are the 3rd with the strongest `` peripheral identity '' as the article puts it ; after navarrese and basques . 
  i 'm surprised . 
  is n't there some overlapping with basque identity in navarre ? 
  a big enough quantity of `` random commenters '' in internet represent not a whole country , but a significant reality of the country . 
  please , do n't tell me that you have never read stuff like this . 
  do the maga trolls in / r/the _ donald represent america ? 
  do they represent real stuff that exists in america ? 
  absolutely . 
  the same applies to this anti-catalan shit . 
  i agree more or less with your points , but there is an important issue with your graph .
