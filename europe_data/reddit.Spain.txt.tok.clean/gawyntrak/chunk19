  in some we countries the student gets paid . 
  so education in spain is not `` dirt cheap '' ; more like the contrary . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.topuniversities.com/student-info/student-finance/how-much-does-it-cost-study-europe ) this , and the very high rate of high school drop-outs , probably explains a big part of the youth unemployment rate . 
  rajoy has not said that spain will take care of the brits health care . 
  do you have any source proving otherwise ? 
  depends of the agreement . 
  if it includes that the health care of the immigrants should be taken care by the host countries , i very much expect spain to veto it . 
   we do n't need to reform the commonwealth . 
  it works . 
  the commonwealth has very few functions , and it 's mainly a 3rd world countries club . 
  the average gdp per capita in the commonwealth is $ 4,446 $ , half of romania 's . 
  this is the gdp per capita for the 8 biggest commonwealth countries , apart from the uk : - india 1,509 $ - pakistan 1,189 $ - nigeria 1,502 $ - bangladesh 743 $ - south africa 8,070 $ - tanzania 532 $ - kenya 808 $ - uganda 487 $ it works . 
   and it 's not like italy spain or greece would have any functional economy right now if they were n't a part of the eu . 
  what a pile of bullshit . 
  particularly when applied to a country , italy , that has been a net contributor to the eu for more than 30 years . 
  the dollar value that an average person produces depends on the local currency value and gives true nonsensical results , like the fact that [ in nominal gdp , russian economy is the size of spain or australia , and significantly smaller than south korea , canada or italy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( nominal \\ ) ) . 
  anyway , let 's use the data that you want , nominal gdp , as it does n't change much the matter . 
  in millions of int $ : - germany : 3,494,900 - uk : 2,649,890 - france : 2,488,280 - italy : 1,852,500 - nordic union : 1,454,909 - spain : 1,252,160 even if we count with nominal gdp , the nordic union would have an economy 16 % bigger than the spanish one , and 21 % smaller than the italian . 
  it would be closer to be half of uk 's economy ( 54.7 % ) than germany 's ( 41.6 % ) . 
  again , pretty far from being a superpower . 
  if that would be the case , i guess he would n't have pulled out from tpp , which many saw as the `` anti-china '' trade agreement . 
  trump is going for protectionism . 
   i suspect the pacific tilt will happen faster in the usa under a trump administration . 
  trump is significantly more hostile with china than with europe . 
  according imf , only two nordic countries have a higher gdp ( ppp ) per capita : sweden and norway . 
  denmark , iceland and finland are under germany . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp \\ ) _ per_capita ) adding the gdp ( ppp ) of the five , gives 1.357.731 millions of int $ . 
  that would set such a union in the european context just after spain , and in front poland and netherlands . 
  not what i would call a superpower . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp \\ ) ), 
  this kind of european collaboration saved my girlfriend 's ass ( and mine ) when she lost her passport in china . 
  she lost it in suzhou , a city 150km from shanghai . 
  she is from lithuania , and the lithuanian embassy is in beijing : that 's 1400km from suzhou . 
  the lithuanian embassy redirected us to the austrian consulate in shanghai , who gave my gf a temporary austrian passport to come back home . 
  yes , i know that shanghai and beijing are still in the same country - despite being very far from each other - , but the fact that the austrian embassy followed the spirit of the law saved us a lot of time , money and worries . 
  the eu is the biggest trading partner of the uk , with over 40 % of the trade . 
  if not the eu , which is the biggest trading partned ? 
  the us , china ? 
  the `` no-eu '' union does not exist , and therefore is not a partner . 
  catalonia stronk , caliphate of hispanistan . 
  come on , do n't get triggered . 
  ah , limonov ... lovely fellow . 
  lovely in the way that a very original psycho-nutjob can be . 
  there is a fantastic [ novel ] ( https://www.amazon.com/limonov-outrageous-adventures-sensation-political-ebook/dp/b00j6u7jvs/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1484864521&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=limonov ) about him . 
  some highlights : - he got famous with a book about his personal experience as a hobo in ny . 
  some of these experiences include interracial gay sex . 
  - during the yugoslavian wars , he supported the bosnian serbs so much that he decided to fight in the war . 
  [ here we have him shooting people in sarajevo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th_v6al1d84 ) . 
  yes , it 's real . 
  - later he founded the national bolshevik party . 
  he is inspired by [ roman von ungern-sternberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_von_ungern-sternberg ) , who is another strong competitor for the position of best/worst nutjob ever . 
  southern europe has survived an economic disaster of colossal proportions . 
  we should be happy we still have a society . 
  japan is in a pretty bad situation . 
  gdp ( ppp ) per capita is pretty close to spain and italy , and significantly worse than france . 
  actually we are pretty close from the average of the euro area . 
  spain also has a pension visa . 
  you need to make around 2k euros per month net and have a private insurance . 
  i 'm very happy about the people that `` pours money '' into the system , but i 'm not really convinced that most of the british pensioners in spain do that . 
  - first of all , the pensioner needs to put a substantial amount of money into the system to pay for the common services that he uses : from the police to the care for the streets . 
  how many pensioners are spending this kind of money ? 
  how many even have it ? 
  - second , there is the issue with the health care system . 
  if uk does not pay for it , the pensioners will have to hire a private insurance . 
  how many can afford that ? 
  spain has a visa for pensioners that takes into account these issues . 
  it requires the applicant to make around 2k euros per month and to have a private insurance . 
  i find that reasonable ; but i do n't know if most of the british pensioners in spain have this kind of money . 
  the retirement visa has some requirements , mainly about having a minimum level of income . 
  according [ this ] ( http://www.exteriores.gob.es/consulados/montevideo/es/serviciosconsulares/documents/3.4.1.2.visado%20de%20residencia%20no%20lucrativa.pdf ) , you need to make at least 2130 euros per month , which would be around 1850 pounds . 
  according [ this ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/563425/pensioners-incomes-series-2014-15-report.pdf ) , that income is slightly over the uk average . 
  the pensioner also would need to have private insurance . 
  there are much , much , much more poles than spaniards in the uk . 
  according un , there are only 90k spaniards in uk , for 700k poles . 
  there are even more lithuanians in uk than spaniards . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign-born_population_of_the_united_kingdom ), 
   it benefits us because they will spend all their retirement money here instead of spain . 
  many british pensioners in spain move because their pound goes further here than back home , particularly as they move to any cheap place as long as it has sun an sea . 
  you may find that many of those pensioners are not able to maintain themselves in britain . 
   the `` one step short '' of freedom of movement is a guaranteed work visa for any eu citizen with a job offer in the uk ( and vice versa ) . 
  i doubt that the brexit bunch would agree with this . 
  spain is doing pretty well in the last years . 
  second biggest growth in western europe - after ireland - in the last two years , if i do n't remember wrong . 
  italy is not a giant drag , from any point of view . 
  of course migrants from the south enter the eu from the southernest countries . 
  if you kick them out , the migrants will then enter by the new southern border , which will be france and austria . 
  countries with many more migrants than italy , by the way . 
  by the way , the muslim terrorists were not italian or greek . 
  they were french and belgian . 
   greece has to go , italy too . 
  i 'm fascinated by the obsession of some people with kicking out a nation that has been a net contributor to the eu for more than 30 years . 
  and which one is it ? 
  spain  italy fight !, 
  then there is no excuse . 
  in the us , the h1bs and l1bs need to be paid a minimum salary , and this minimum will likely be increased under trump . 
  in my opinion , europe should go for a similar policy . 
  no , it 's not odd . 
  i have quite a lot of experience with ror ( i also contributed in some projects , included rails itself ) and at least until a few years ago the job situation was absolutely insane . 
  in barcelona , as a cto of a start-up , i was never able to hire a good ror engineer . 
  i never even * interviewed * one .
