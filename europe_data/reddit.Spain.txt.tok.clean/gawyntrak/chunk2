  as an immigrant in denmark , it 's very interesting to read the position of a young dane who is involved in politics . 
  however , it worries me that someone like you ( young , liberal ) sees dpp with such sympathy . 
  nothing can be further from my vision of dpp than a `` feel-good party '' . 
  i know many foreigners living in dk who are openly scared of dpp and its supporters . 
  i do n't think that the political situation of the spanish former colonies is really telling about spain itself . 
  i mean , most of the commonwealth members make mexico look like plato 's republic ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/member_states_of_the_commonwealth_of_nations ) . 
  ironically , i see them much more similar to the states than to the `` motherland '' : mexico in particular is a good example . 
  high homicide rate , huge unequality ... 
  i go to the states kind of often for work reasons ( san francisco , in particular ) and i see things that are absolutely impossible in spain . 
  drug addicts using their needles ... in front of the city hall !, 
  wtf . 
  btw , us-spain war in 1939 ? 
  i kind of liked ron paul . 
  his position on abortion was very disturbing for me , as a libertarian ( ish ) ; but the rest was really good . 
  trump has suggested that he may break nato . 
  it 's hard for me to imagine paul saying something like this . 
  beyond this , trump seems extremely unstable , and he might open some social pandora boxes ( racism ) that would be better closed . 
   let 's say that we had elected rand paul . 
  not related , but i wish you did . 
  do you remember when the charismatic revolutionary in the gop was ron paul ? 
  those were really happy times ... 
  as a local that had a business in barcelona i just can tell you that ... 
  i feel you , bro . 
  you were trying to set up a `` sociedad limitada '' , were you ? 
  yeah , bureaucracy is hell in spain . 
  getting venture capital in europe , a sv-sized amount , is a problem in europe . 
  trump a rockefeller republican ? 
  why ? 
  because he was born in ny ? 
  rockefeller was a moderate , elitist republican . 
  trump has build his case around populism . 
  they are * total * opposites . 
  spain and italy gdps together are bigger than france 's and not very far from germany 's ... 
  italy 's unemployment rate is so different than the spanish one mainly because there is less people searching for jobs , not because there are more jobs . 
  if you check the employment rate instead of the unemployment one , spain actually does slightly better : ** employment rate ( 2014 ) : ** - germany : 73.8 % - czech republic : 69 % - france : 64.3 % - spain : 56 % - italy : 55.7 % - greece : 49.4 % [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:employment_rate,_age_group_15%e2%80%9364,_2004%e2%80%9314_ ( % 25 \\ ) _ yb16.png ) i guess that most of young people still search for jobs , so the employment and unemployment rates are closer . 
   the 2008 recession was worse in the uk than france or italy as far as i know . 
  you are wrong . 
  it was worse for italy than for the uk : -1.1 in 2008 and -5.5 in 2009 for italy ; -0.6 and -4.3 for uk . 
  you can check in the source of my previous post . 
   your gdp growth figures are averaged up over a much larger period to include anemic eurozone growth problems . 
  the gdp growth figures are averaged up over a `` much '' larger period ( 2 years more , 2005 and 2006 ) because it was already visible data . 
  btw , i made a mistake ; the average gdp growth i posted is since 2005 , not 2004 . 
  anyway , i will recalculate the gdp without counting those 2 years : ** average gdp growth ( 2007 - 2015 ) : ** - germany : 1.2 % - uk : 1.1 % - france : 0.7 % - spain : 0.1 % - italy : -0.7 % so it 's the same . 
   if you remove the true outlier and take the last 6 year average you will see the uk 's net contribution higher than france . 
  you are proposing literally to remove one third of the samples ( 3 out of 9 years ) because they are `` outliers '' , and keep the one that fits your thesis , despite being the farthest one from the average . 
  no , that 's not how you remove outliers from a sample . 
  in fact , if we wanted to be fair , we should take the budget for a 7 years period , as the eu prepares `` financial frame works '' for those years . 
  in particular , there was a 2007-2013 financial framework and now there is a 2014-2020 one . 
  however , i already can tell you that the results will be very similar : france contributes more to the eu budget . 
   second place seems the most common nah , actually france 's average contribution is higher : 6009m . 
  germany 's is higher too , of course . 
   even though you have stretched it back to cover the worst recession in the uk since the the 1930 's . 
  you mean almost everyone 's worst recession since the 1930 's ? 
  the recession in uk has been much milder than in france , italy or spain , and very similar to germany 's . 
  ** average gdp growth ( 2004 - 2015 ) : ** - germany : 1.4 % - uk : 1.4 % - france : 0.9 % - spain : 0.8 % - italy : -0.3 % [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_european_union ), 
   the net contribution was 11.5 billion . 
  2015 is an outlier . 
  - 2007 : 4.155 m ( 2nd biggest contributor ) - 2008 : 844m ( 6th ) - 2009 : 1.903 ( 4th ) - 2010 : 5.625 ( 2nd ) - 2011 : 5.565 ( 4th ) - 2012 : 7.366 ( 3rd ) - 2013 : 8.641 ( 2nd ) - 2014 : 4.930 ( 3rd ) - 2015 : 11.521 ( 2nd ) average of the last 9 years : 5.617 m, 
  we agree . 
  i personally think that for psoe it would have been better to accept a pp minority government instead of entering into a coalition government , but of course , in exchange of something . 
  if not rajoy 's head , at least something else . 
  well , i took exactly the same years as in the article ( `` between 2001 and 2014 '' ) . 
  ukip has been a pretty big voice in britain , particularly in the european parliament , for more than a decade . 
  moreover , if you check the plots , you will see that the foreign-born population is quite linear ; from 2001 to 2007 it grew in 1.87 % and from 2007 to 2013 in 2.16 % . 
  it 's not the first time i read this hypothesis , but i think it 's wrong . 
  if that would be the case , more densely populated zones like london would be more pro-leave than zones with a lower density , like northern england . 
  that 's not the case . 
  let 's compare this with other we countries again . 
  ** increase in foreign-born population ( 2001-2013 \\* ) : ** - ireland : 7.18 % - spain : 7.07 % - norway : 6.89 % - switzerland : 5.97 % - italy : 5.55 % - iceland : 5.07 % - belgium : 4.70 % - sweden : 4.42 % - united kingdom : 4.03 % - austria : 2.87 % - finland : 2.79 % - denmark : 2.48 % - portugal : 1.87 % - france : 1.51 % - netherlands : 1.19 % - germany : 0.13 % uk 's increase is not particularly exceptional , imo . 
  * : [ source ] ( https://data.oecd.org/chart/4euc ) . 
  i use 2013 as is the last year available in oecd . 
  i added all the available we countries , except greece , which does not have data for 2013 . 
  having momentum means improving , doing better than expected . 
  and as you said yourself , psoe did better than predicted . 
  psoe , after the second elections , had a lot of leverage . 
  they could have asked for changes in laws , for kicking out ministers , and maybe even for rajoy 's head . 
  pp would have probably given something : they were asking for negotiations themselves . 
  damn , even ciudadanos got something . 
  if pp would have not accepted anything , they would have looked like the responsible part in sending the country to the third elections . 
  instead , psoe brought itself to the worse possible situation : accepting a pp government , and for free . 
  it could be . 
  i personally believe that tabloids - which are not so popular in continental europe - may be related . 
  less than romanians in italy and turks in germany .

  i 'm sorry , but uk is not much more a `` magnet for migrants '' than any other country in western europe . 
  its numbers of foreign-born population are pretty average . 
  in britain , 13 % of the population is foreign-born . 
  that 's very similar to the numbers of spain ( 12.7 % ) and germany ( 12.6 % ) ; and significantly lower than belgium ( 16.1 % ) , sweden ( 16.4 % ) or austria ( 17.2 % ) [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:foreign-born_population_by_country_of_birth,_1_january_2015_ ( % c2 % b9 \\ ) _ yb16.png ) . 
  about the poles ... italy has more romanians ( 1.1 m ) than uk has poles ( 870k ) . 
  germany has more turks ( 1.4 m ) than uk has poles . 
  the number of romanians in spain ( 708k ) is not very far from the number of poles in britain , and spain is much smaller [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/1/1c/main_countries_of_citizenship_and_birth_of_the_foreign_foreign-born_population%2c_1_january_2015_%28%c2%b9%29_%28in_absolute_numbers_and_as_a_percentage_of_the_total_foreign_foreign-born_population%29_yb16.png ) . 
  britain does not have more migrants than other we countries , so that 's not the reason why migration has become such a big issue in britain . 
  i 'm afraid you have n't followed spanish politics lately . 
  originally , the leader of psoe ( pedro s\u00e1nchez ) was opposed to a pp government under any circumstances . 
  a part of its party rebelled against him , managed to kick him out - blocking a vote from psoe affiliates , who would have probably maintained s\u00e1nchez and the `` no '' to rajoy - and approved to maintain rajoy as president . 
  again : no negotiations with pp ; everything as a result of an inner power struggle of psoe . 
  ciudadanos , having much less power , was able to get something from pp . 
  psoe itself is saying that they accept rajoy only to avoid another election , not as a result of any negotiation . 
  a negotiation that ca n't have happened , as the `` coup d'etat '' against s\u00e1nchez and the approval of rajoy happened simultaneously . 
  the reality is that after its inner struggle , psoe looks so bad that they want to avoid another election at any cost : including giving the government to rajoy for free .
