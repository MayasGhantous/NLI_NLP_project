  if you think that in spain there are a lot of unemployed software engineers ... that 's just not true ( 4 days ago in the news , [ demand for engineers and their salaries soar in barcelona ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/economia/20170108/413173102223/demanda-ingenieros-barcelona-sueldo-ofertas.html ) ) . 
  of course , you might find some not very good ones ; but that 's the same everywhere . 
  finding a decent engineer in a trendy technology ... good luck with that . 
  i would put a very colorful example of how insane the situation is . 
  some friends are partners in a game company called kerad games . 
  one of the founding partners is gerard piqu\u00e9 , yep , [ that gerard piqu\u00e9 ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/02/gerard-pique-soccer-star-and-video-game-creator.html ) . 
  he promotes heavily the company in the media . 
  a few months ago he appeared on tv , complaining how hard was to find engineers despite giving great conditions while showing the cool offices they have . 
  and yeah , [ they are still searching ] ( https://keradgames.bamboohr.co.uk/jobs/view.php?id=12 ) . 
  so if having one of the most famous football players in the world in tv showing what a cool company he has is not enough to fill a position , imagine how is the situation for `` normal '' companies . 
  the other thing is that for a 20-something with a good job , scandinavia is not the most appealing place in the world . 
  i certainly find it much less appealing than barcelona ( i lived in copenhagen and helsinki ) . 
  of course , that might be very different for people from non-western countries . 
  of course , that 's only if you want an experienced engineer . 
  if you are ok with a `` blank slate '' that you hope to groom into a good engineer , then you probably do n't need to bring foreigners . 
  is it normal in the uk to have doctors and engineers living in `` cramped conditions '' and sending all the money back to their countries ? 
  extra people cause extra load , but workers - particularly skilled workers - put more money into the system . 
  skilled migrants tend to pay a lot of taxes ( because they have high salaries ) and get few benefits ( because they are young ) . 
  fiscally punishing people that pay into the system because `` they cause an extra load '' is nonsense . 
   my country has one of the most liberal laws in the world regarding work permits . 
  which country is it ? 
  by the way , in my experience there is a extreme shortage of people who know ruby on rails . 
  is there some paper demonstrating that skilled eu workers cause an extra load to services compared to british people ? 
  yes , we do . 
  a few days ago i met with some friends in barcelona . 
  i told them that many poles found offensive to call them `` eastern europeans '' , as they were from `` central europe '' . 
  my friends found it hilarious ; `` central europe '' is a concept that just does not exist in spain . 
  after laughing , one of them asked me : - what else ? 
  do baltics say they are nordics ? 
  - well , about that ... 
  they laughed even more . 
  please , do n't get offended . 
  we do n't share much with greece either , and somehow we ended up being `` southern europe '' . 
  to the point that [ the lithuanian president used a expression in spanish to attack the greeks ] ( http://www.pappaspost.com/europes-frustration-grows-with-greece-with-the-greek-government-it-is-every-time-manana/ ) . 
  well , the parent comment talks about `` economically progressive '' which is a different issue . 
  `` economically progressive '' would mean more liberal/pro-free market , and i do think that spain is more like that than italy ; hence , the higher growth . 
  my personal opinion is that italy is very slightly economically better , with emphasis on the very . 
  the problems on what you comment is that the distance in gdp ( ppp ) per capita in between spain and italy is extremely small at this point : 2.6 % of difference according imf [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp \\ ) _ per_capita ) . 
  given the difference of growth in between the countries , spain should surpass italy in 2017 . 
  the unemployment rate it 's a pretty tricky stat to compare these two countries . 
  yes , spain has a higher unemployment rate ( 18.9 % vs 11.6 % ) ; but it also has a higher employment rate [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:employment_rate,_age_group_20%e2%80%9364,_2005%e2%80%932015_ ( % 25 \\ ) _ yb16_iii . png ) : 62 % of the people in work age in spain have a job ; 60.5 % for italy . 
  this is commented in the posted article ; probably the difference is caused by a smaller percentage of women working in italy and more people on early retirement . 
  given these circumstances , i think it 's quite disputable to say that italy has an advantage on this issue . 
  in the human development index , spain does very slightly better ; spain being 27th and italy 28th . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_development_index ) i sincerely doubt that italy is much more industrialized than spain : according [ data ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_sector_composition ) , its industrial sector has exactly the same weight in the gdp : 24 % . 
  one great example of this is vehicle production ; despite italy having famous brands ( ferrari , vespa ) , italy produces significantly less vehicles than spain ; 1.014 m and 6th in eu vs 2.733 m and 2nd in the eu ( [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_motor_vehicle_production ) ) . 
  italy is not only the factory-friendly north , and spain is not only the southern backwaters where brits buy cheap villas . 
  in fact , that would be my conclusion : italy and spain are pretty similar countries , with similar gdp per capita and hdi ; they both have issues with unemployment and debt . 
  they would both benefit from an expansionist monetary policy , something that it 's ( still ) not a political issue in spain but it is very much in italy . 
  why ? 
  i do n't think there is a real intent from the media of trying to compare ourselves with italy . 
  as i believe is the case in italy , spaniards love to throw shit on themselves , so the usual comparison is with germany/sweden , and always in the things in which germany/sweden is clearly superior . 
  man , do n't post this kind of stuff , people will realize that the swedistan thingy was some alt-right bullshit . 
  that kind of job exists everywhere , not only in spain . 
  it 's directed to not high-skilled foreigners ( * native german * ) , not locals . 
  and the net salary would be around 13.500 euros , so more than 1.000 euros per month . 
  i doubt so . 
  the vast majority of the debt growth was in the period 2008-2013 , in which we passed from 39.4 % to 99.2 % ( [ source ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/spain/government-debt-to-gdp ) ) . 
  it has been stable since then . 
  despite that , in those 6 years we only had one year of positive growth , and that was 1.1 % and in 2008 . 
  the series is horrible : +1.1 , -3.6 , 0 , -1.0 , -2.9 , -1.7 . 
  and that , `` despite '' a growing public debt . 
  in the last three years ( 2014-2016 ) our debt has stabilized and we have something that looks like solid growth : 1.4 , 3.2 , ~ 2.8 . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_european_union ) . 
  are you sure ? 
  when i was living there , the unemployment fund always told me that it was a maximum of 2 years . 
  i had read that it had been changed a few years ago . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.expatindenmark.com/livingindenmark/pages/social-security.aspx ) it also says it 's 2 years max . 
   please note : no matter which a-kasse you join , you can receive unemployment benefits for a maximum of two years . 
  moreover , the unemployment benefits in denmark come through an insurance that the worker hires himself and needs to pay monthly , the a-kasse : i paid 450dkk ( 60 euros ) for it , and many of my colleagues did n't pay . 
  if not getting a dismissal compensation is `` shit job conditions '' then most of the eu ( including countries like denmark ) have `` shit job conditions '' . 
   there was a proposal of a `` single contract '' that removed the difference between temporary and permanent contracts and thus removed the incentives for the companies to do this , but probably wo n't be done anytime soon . 
  in my opinion , something like this should be passed asap . 
  unfortunately , it would be extremely unpopular , making it politically infeasible . 
   i mean sure , italy , ** britain ** , ireland and ** scotland ** are easy enough , but i sure as hell would n't be able to tell which is germany , france and switzerland . 
  lol . 
  lived in denmark , can attest they do . 
  and what cadis is to andalusia , i guess . 
  `` things '' .
