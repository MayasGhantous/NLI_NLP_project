  clouds of sils maria ( 2014 , france ) 25 . 
  i 'm going to go full crazy and post my favourite movie of each eu country ... or at least of the ones i have seen a movie of : - austria : love , by michael haneke - belgium : amer , by h\u00e9l\u00e8ne cattet and bruno forzani - bulgaria : :( - croatia : :( - cyprus : :( - czech republic : :( . 
  this one is particularly annoying , as cz has a few classics in the 60s ... that i have n't seen . 
  and i do n't like svankmajer . 
  - denmark : ordet , by carl theodor dreyer - estonia : angry painter , by jeon kyu-hwan ( co-production with south korea ) - finland : i hired a contract killer , by aki kaurism\u00e4ki - france : a bout de souffle , by jean-luc godard - germany : m , by fritz lang - greece : landscape in the mist , by theodoros angelopoulos - hungary : :( - ireland : hunger , by steve mcqueen - italy : bicycle thieves , by vittorio de sica - latvia : :( - lithuania : redirected , by emilis velyvis - luxembourg : :( - malta : :( - netherlands : black book , by paul verhoeven - poland : a short film about killing , by krzysztof kieslowski - portugal : mysteries of lisbon , by raoul ruiz - romania : 4 months , 3 weeks & 2 days , by cristian mungiu - slovakia : :( - slovenia : :( - spain : viridiana , by luis bu\u00f1uel - sweden : cries and whispers , by ingmar bergman - uk : marat/sade by peter brook imo , all the movies in this list are masterpieces , except the lithuanian one . 
  depends how you define `` on par '' . 
  the distance in between italy/spain and cz/slovenia is similar to the distance in between france and italy/spain . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp \\ ) _ per_capita ) . 
  and i would n't say that we are `` on par '' with france . 
  portugal and , specially , greece , is another story . 
  [ illustrating the point ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/eu-regions_gdp_per_capita_ppp.png ) . 
   some other anti-eu parties include podemos , syriza and the five star movement . 
  none of those parties supports leaving the eu , unlike le pen . 
  the greek referendum was not even anti-eu . 
  do n't mix austerity with the eu . 
  the problem with the far right about eu is that they want to destroy it , or at the very least to force their countries to leave it . 
  that 's what happened in uk . 
  * cebolla * , of course . 
  sorry , i meant * ceba * . 
  this is one of these situations in which you see clearly the limits of the left/right dichotomy . 
  as you know , ciu was a coalition between two parties , converg\u00e8ncia and uni\u00f3 . 
  converg\u00e8ncia , the biggest one , is a liberal party ; they even [ sit with the liberals in the european parliament ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alliance_of_liberals_and_democrats_for_europe_group ) . 
  imo , the main difference with pp is that the catalan right-wing tends to be less socially conservative but at the same time more pro-free market . 
  in one word , more liberal . 
  ironically , ciudadanos is quite similar in this respect ; in the end they are a catalan party , too . 
  edit : i will give a pretty clear example of this . 
  in 1998 , ciu voted for the first law in spain that gave recognition to gay couples ( the * llei d'unions estables de parella * ) . 
  during the voting in the catalan parliament , only pp was against . 
   i think we still have to put a bit more effort on that !, 
  * independentism intensifies *, 
   our historical importance makes it more sensible to talk of our civilisation separately . 
  that 's a really british thing to say . 
  i sincerely doubt that all this is some kind of complot for getting a better tax system : seems like an insane overkill . 
  moreover , of what i am sure is that `` the catalan nationalists ' did n't do this to gain power . 
  the `` catalan nationalists '' in this case i guess would be ciu , the traditional party of power in catalonia . 
  since the first catalan elections in 1980 , this party has won all elections and held power for most of the time ( 1980-2003 , 2010-now ) . 
  the independence process has managed to break the party , and its successor figures as only [ the 4th most voted party in the polls ] ( http://www.electograph.com/2016/10/cataluna-autonomicas-agosto-2016-sondeo.html ) . 
  for them all this has been a political disaster . 
  the idea that it will eventually stop if the spanish government does nothing has been around since this started more than 4 years ago ... and it has not worked . 
  the question seems pretty funny . 
  does that imply that 85 % of muslims think that jews can be trusted ? 
  which was the percentage for christian , native population ? 
  i would n't be surprised if over 10 % of native germans think that jews can not be trusted ; that 's still a very low percentage . 
  rajoy is to blame for this . 
  his `` do n't do anything , ever '' attitude will manage to kill us all of pure boredom . 
  and `` all '' in this case is all spaniards . 
  i agree with you ( check my comment ) , but it depends of what you count and how . 
  for example , money-go-round uses a different [ methodology ] ( http://money-go-round.eu/section.aspx?id=2 ) using the same sources and it has [ ireland ] ( http://money-go-round.eu/country.aspx?id=ie ) as a contributor for three years ( 2009 , 2013 and 2014 ) . 
  my understanding is that when an organization is as complex as the eu is normal to have this kind of disagreements on what to count ; and ireland ( and [ spain ] ( http://money-go-round.eu/country.aspx?id=es ) , btw ) are very close to getting zero from the eu . 
  according the `` official '' data , you were still receivers in 2014 : of only 38.8 m , but it 's still something . 
  in 2015 , you got 349.3 m. 
  it 's peanuts , and is kind of clear to me that ireland is basically a `` neutral '' nation ; it barely gets nothing . 
  you can check it [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/interactive/index_en.cfm ) . 
  italy is a net contributor . 
  it has been so [ since 1985 ] ( http://money-go-round.eu/country.aspx?id=it ) . 
  spain and ireland are still net receivers , but receive substantially less ( in % gni ) than any ee country , except croatia which just joined . 
   the economy does n't improve the economy improves . 
  it has improved quite a lot , actually . 
  there is more social unrest in the us than in all those countries , excluding greece . 
  i agree in general with your comment , in particular with this `` it 's silly to equate the medieval concept of kingdom to the modern one of `` state '' '' . 
  i also agree that unilateralism should be out the question ; the problem here is that one part is rejecting any kind of dialogue on the referendum . 
  let 's not forget that spain 's government and catalonia 's one reached [ an agreement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statute_of_autonomy_of_catalonia ) and the breaking of this agreement is one of the main causes of the current situation . 
  however , the example of the olympic games is pretty poor , imo . 
  spain did n't back barcelona as olympic host in detriment of madrid , which had not been a candidate since 1972 . 
  actually , the only case when spain backed one city instead of the other it was with seville and madrid in 2012 . 
  romanians going back to romania because there are no more construction jobs , probably . 
  and quite true . 
  you are right , i do n't think spaniards would set the danish language as one of our values . 
  and win a lottery in which you only have 30 % chance of winning . 
  so pretty hard to get . 
  in spain there was same-sex partnership recognition before 2004 , supported by the regions . 
  for example , catalonia recognized same-sex partnership in 1998 . 
  already in 2002 , most of spaniards lived in regions that recognized it . 
  now i do n't remember the exact data , but there was some statistics showing that most of migrants from spain during the last 5 years were foreigners going back home , particularly latin americans . 
  for example , there were 461k ecuadorians in spain in 2006 ; in 2014 there were only 213k , less than half . 
  for a while ecuador was the most common migration destiny from spain , more than uk and germany . 
  counting from the peak in 2007 to 2014 , there are 458.000 latin americans less in spain , and that 's only taking into account the 5 most common countries ( ecuador , colombia , bolivia , peru and argentina ) . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_spain ), 
  i agree that dk has huge issues integrating me migrants , but in my opinion the migrants themselves are not the only ones to blame . 
  in spain , the second generations of moroccans tend to be much less religious , or even not religious at all , comparing with their parents ; most of spanish-born young muslim girls do n't wear hijab . 
  in cph , particularly in n\u00f8rrebro , most of young girls wear the hijab , or even the niqab . 
  in dk , it seemed to me that the descendants were as or more religious than the parents . 
  in my opinion , it 's much easier to `` become spanish '' than to `` become danish '' . 
  [ danishness seems pretty hard to achieve ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/opinion/who-says-youre-a-dane.html ) , or even impossible for people who does n't look dane . 
  nope . 
  spain has a higher percentage of foreign-born population than denmark and germany . 
  spain - 12.7 % , germany - 12.6 % , denmark - 10.5 % . 
  [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:foreign-born_population_by_country_of_birth,_1_january_2015_ ( % c2 % b9 \\ ) _ yb16.png ) the biggest group of foreign-born population in spain is moroccans , with 699.9 k , 11.9 % of the total foreign-born . 
  in denmark , the biggest group is poles , followed by germans ; only turks are the third with 32.2 k , 5.4 % of the total foreign-born . 
  [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/1/1c/main_countries_of_citizenship_and_birth_of_the_foreign_foreign-born_population%2c_1_january_2015_%28%c2%b9%29_%28in_absolute_numbers_and_as_a_percentage_of_the_total_foreign_foreign-born_population%29_yb16.png ) anecdotally , i have to say that copenhagen always looked to me as a place with very low levels of immigration , compared with my native barcelona . 
  my friends that visited my in dk also commented about this . 
  now germany is not western europe ? 
  man , this regions of europe thingy is getting more and more confusing . 
  yeah , well , do n't believe that southern europeans like the label very much . 
  a non-binding referendum would be illegal too . 
  generalitat passed a [ law to allow it to organize non-binding referendums ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ley_de_consultas_de_catalu%c3%b1a ) , but the law has been declared unconstitutional . 
   have they not heard of civilized manner of diplomatic negotiation and a legitimate independence referendum , observed by outside observers such as the eu or the osce . 
  this is what the catalan government has been trying to get for close to 5 years now .
