  good to see that you support it . 
  the issue is that the spanish government does not want it , despite the vast majority of catalans wanting a referendum . 
  about the supposed `` indoctrination '' note that this is : - a video of a particular school , aka an anecdote . 
  - kids doing a play about a [ war that did happen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_revolt ) . 
  i think we will agree that kids this age should not be doing this kind of stuff , and i hope that someone ( teacher , school management ) pays for it . 
  yep , i know . 
  anyway i do n't think that france would be able to `` frenchize '' catalonia the same way it did for other regions . 
  i mean , it would n't be possible to remove the autonomy and the language without a military occupation . 
  nah , i do n't think that france would be interested in taking us . 
   in italy there is one `` nation '' recognised , just as in germany [ well , that depends ] ( http://orig07.deviantart.net/acb1/f/2014/275/8/4/bavariaball_by_arminius1871-d81cbk0.png ) . 
  actually , the italian situation is even more interesting , imo . 
  in spain , there is a source of `` spanish-ness '' which would be castille , and then the rest feels more or less attached to it . 
  it 's much harder for me to identify a source of `` italian-ness '' ; certainly not rome . 
  maybe piedmonte , as the origin of the italian unification ? 
   as concerns the elections , everywhere in italy , except in the north , the main national parties are the ones that get the most votes , we also have a few small independentist parties but they do n't get many votes . 
  and that 's the main issue here . 
  in spain we had exactly the same `` discouragement '' against minority languages , or even stronger : we had a merry fascist dictator for almost 40 years . 
  when democracy came back , the regionalist/nationalist movement was as strong as ever . 
  i doubt that spanish of castilian culture in general see catalan and basque culture as an asset . 
  more like the opposite , a nuisance . 
  but if we want to live in peace we need to get to compromises . 
  if the teaching of catalan or basque would be banned from schools , there would be a fucking rebellion . 
  that does not happen in italy . 
  from my point of view , the issue is that catalans care more about their region/nation than italians . 
  i do n't know much about the situation of the regions in italy , but according wikipedia the last [ sardinian regional elections ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sardinian_regional_election,_2014 ) were won by the democratic party , which would be the national center-left party . 
  in cat , that would be ... hard . 
  psoe ( spanish center-left ) is not even directly here , using a `` catalan '' brand with different positions than the national party . 
   spain might be happy to get ride of you . 
  wish you were right . 
  and actually a french catalonia would n't be bad , we were annexed to the empire under napoleon . 
  let 's not banalize racism . 
  it 's as bad as his haircut . 
  the data for denmark is not true , or it has taken a case ( danish tax system is pretty complex ) which is not common at all . 
  counting city and state taxes , the tax rate was something like 42 % until a certain quantity of salary ; from that on , a tax rate of 57 % ( * topskat * ) applied . 
  however , the max tax rate for your total salary was 52 % , if i do n't remember wrong . 
  oh , now i understand : this only takes into account the `` state '' tax , which is max 15 % . 
  the problem here is that the municipal tax is higher , in between 23 and 28 % , depending of the town . 
  of course , you need to pay both . 
  and there are some smaller taxes . 
  from the other side of the \u00d8resund bridge it always seemed to me that sweden went too far with the pc stuff , but denmark could do with a bit of it . 
  about the marriage laws ... 
  in copenhagen i met a cuban married with a dane . 
  they were planning to move to malmo because of problems with the danish `` integration '' laws ; i do n't remember the particulars , but it was pretty hard for him to visit his family in cuba for some time and still be `` qualified '' to stay in denmark . 
  even native-danes are affected . 
  thanks for the nice comment . 
  my experience is quite the opposite . 
  imo , danes get very defensive when a foreigner jokes ( or criticizes ) their country . 
  [ the sign is there ] ( http://cbslife.dk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/carlsberg_outdoor.jpg?cf86e5 ) . 
  it 's in the zone for taking your luggage back . 
  it has been there since , at least , beginning of 2014 . 
  it was there last july if i do n't remember wrong . 
  tldr ; many danish right-wing politicians have positions in migration much more extreme and inflammatory than the donald . 
  to this , many danes consider that they are just not being pc . 
  originally , my jab at trump was a jab at pia kj\u00e6rsgaard ; but i am afraid that most of our fellow redditors do n't have the honor to know `` mama pia '' , [ idol of the european far-right nutsos ] ( http://cphpost.dk/history/how-pias-influence-spread-across-europe.html ) and speaker of the danish parliament . 
  so i just took a famous politician with similar positions on immigration . 
  in fact , as someone who has lived recently in denmark and in the us ( i live in sf now ) , i would say that trump is considerately more moderate than kj\u00e6rsgaard , danske folkeparti as a whole ( 2nd biggest party in dk ) or even inger st\u00f8jberg , glorious minister of segregation for the center-right . 
  i can illustrate this with some examples . 
  the most unfortunate comment by trump was his infamous '' [ mexicans ] they 're bringing drugs . 
  they 're bringing crime . 
  they 're rapists . 
  and some , i assume , are good people '' . 
  terrible . 
  well , how does that compare in danish politics ? 
  here , my redditors , i bring you the speaker of the danish parliament , a country which is `` the most trump critical country anywhere '' : - '' [ muslims ] are at a lower stage of civilisation , with their own primitive and cruel customs like honour killings , forced marriages , halal slaughtering and blood-feuds . '', 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/danish_people's_party ) is maybe pia kj\u00e6rsgaard , speaker of the danish parliament , an alien in danish politics ? 
  not really . 
  another danish politician , which may be also very critical of trump : - [ foreigners ] `` they make a mess , they cheat , they steal , they rape and they kill . '' [ source ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/713278/danish-politician-cheanne-nielsen-dpp-migrants-steal-rape-kill-speech-probed-police ) well , it 's good to know what us , foreigners in denmark , do . 
  now i really ca n't complain of not having enough sex , because apparently i `` rape '' . 
  but well , at least [ i 'm not going to be bombed , because i 'm not a muslim child ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3t4q35/danish_mp_bomb_women_and_children/ ) as another danish politician suggested . 
  and now , please do n't tell me that you have never heard people saying that df is `` just not pc '' . 
  beyond quotes , the immigration laws that denmark has passed are very harsh , unimaginable here in the us or in spain . 
  i ca n't imagine americans needing to move to canada to marry mexicans , [ as happens in denmark ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/2908031 ) . 
  myself i have met people in this situation . 
  going back to the donald ; trump is horrible , but it 's still * substantially * more moderate in immigration than the main danish right-wing party , and probably more than venstre . 
  he would n't fit in danish politics because he is an egomaniac clown and janteloven is there , but his stance in immigration would be perceived as moderate in denmark . 
  he just wants to make , as the washington post says , [ america more like denmark ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-wants-to-make-america-more-like-denmark/2016/03/02/6bfc935e-dfd9-11e5-8d98-4b3d9215ade1_story.html?utm_term=.9c242618c2e6 ) . 
  exactly . 
  actually in catalan it would be more like `` barsalona '' . 
  let 's forget for a second that who is the `` happiest '' is already a very relative concept for a person , even more so for whole countries . 
  i wan na tell you a story . 
  ----------------- you are in a party . 
  and there 's this girl , she seems a solid 9 . 
  you are not very into the mood today , but somehow you end up in the same group , so you try to start a conversation ... - hey !, 
  i 'm ... - my name is mette . 
  man , do you realize i 'm really the hottest girl in this party ? 
  like i mean , totally , no . 
  i mean , i really do n't care because i 'm really for equality but everyone here looks pretty filthy . 
  including you . 
  it was a joke !, 
  not really . 
  joke again !, 
  so you manage to escape mette and start speaking with another girl . 
  actually , they both look kind of similar to you . 
  she is called essi . 
  essi is as hot as mette , but does n't take herself too seriously . 
  she jokes about you being the second drunkest person on the party , she being the first . 
  essi is cool ; she drinks a little bit too much , but she is fine . 
  you like her . 
  meanwhile you listen mette saying that trump is not racist , only not pc .
