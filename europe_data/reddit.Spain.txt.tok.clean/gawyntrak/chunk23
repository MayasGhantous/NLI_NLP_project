  however , i never met a finn who considered his country as the happiest ; more like the contrary . 
  many of the issues that finns found in their country existed in denmark too ; [ as shown by the high consumption of anti-depressants ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1x7u7r/til_that_denmark_supposedly_the_happiest_country/ ) . 
  i guess that coming from a very self-deprecating culture i sympathize with cultures that work in a similar way , and i find the lack of self-criticism kind of ... arrogant . 
  sorry for the long post , but i lived in both countries and i wanted to share some of my views . 
  we do have the `` lisp '' - for us iberians is more like latin americans talking weird , but well - . 
  only in some parts of the spanish south and in the canary islands people speaks like in latam . 
  wiki has some maps about this : [ 1 ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/seseo#/media/file:seseo-ceceo-distinci%c3%b3n_en_el_espa%c3%b1ol.png ) and [ 2 ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/seseo#/media/file:ceceo-seseo-distinci%c3%b3n_en_el_espa%c3%b1ol_de_europa.png ) . 
  the `` lisp '' is a difference in how people pronounces three letters : `` c '' , `` s '' and `` z '' . 
  spaniards differentiate , specially in between c/z and s. latin americans ( and people from the canary islands ) pronounce all as `` s '' ( * seseo * ) . 
  andalusians , though , tend to pronounce them all as `` c '' ( * ceceo * ) . 
  beyond the lisp , i do n't know if latin americans are able to distinguish the regional spanish accents . 
  my guess would be that nope . 
  felt the same way when i arrived to california . 
  meanwhile , another nordic capital airport has a huge advertisement welcoming travelers to `` the world 's happiest nation '' . 
  love the finns . 
  all the good things of the nordics , without the bad ones . 
  i always thought that poland and ukraine ( in particular , western ukraine ) had common history , the same as you with the poles . 
  this happens in barcelona , too : around 25 % of the real estate in the city is bought by foreigners ; 40 % of the luxury ones . 
  from where this 70k number comes from ? 
  according ine ( the spanish national statistics institute ) , there are 300k brits in spain , of which around 120k are over 65 , if i do n't remember wrong . 
  and that only counts the ones that took their time to get officially registered as living in spain . 
   it the 75 % that for whatever reason thinks it is just part of being danish to remain a member not being registered a member of the lutheran state church in denmark was complicated even for foreigner atheists from non-lutheran countries like my wife and me . 
  in fact , my wife ended up being registered anyway . 
  being a member of the folkekirke seems to be a very enforced default . 
  the map is about the countries hdi change , not the actual position . 
  the french election has a second round , meaning that in the end voters need to choose in between the best two candidates . 
  right now it will probably be fillon vs le pen . 
  well , checking payscale data [ the average salary for a software engineer in brussels is 37k ] ( http://www.payscale.com/research/be/job=software_engineer/salary/45dd1b5f/brussels ) . 
  [ in barcelona is 32k ] ( http://www.payscale.com/research/es/job=software_engineer/salary/690f492c/barcelona ) ; [ the same as in madrid ] ( http://www.payscale.com/research/es/job=software_engineer/salary/f2fbdedc/madrid ) . 
  that 's around 15 % more in brussels , some difference , but i would n't call that salary a joke . 
  well , in barcelona i have only met very junior software engineers with that salary . 
  all my friends in the industry make substantially more . 
  this . 
  `` charnego '' is derogatory , but it 's rarely used anymore , at least not to attack catalans with spanish roots . 
  the issue here is the culture . 
  or exaggerating a bit : - andalusian parents + accentless catalan + `` rock catal\u00e0 '' fan + member of fc barcelona = catalan almog\u00e0ver ( patriot ) - andalusian parents + no ( or heavily accented ) catalan + flamenco music lover + fan of betis = charnego, 
  yes . 
  in fact , it 's not uncommon at all for `` charnegos '' to be catalan nationalists . 
  the last political star of catalan independentism is a full `` charnego '' , [ gabriel rufi\u00e1n ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gabriel_rufi%c3%a1n ) . 
  yes , no doubt . 
  however , i have to add that this `` ability of becoming spanish '' does not only extend to people that can look spanish . 
  for example , there are no mongoloid/east asian features `` naturally '' in spain , but people of asian descent are considered `` spanish '' if they culturally assimilate . 
  paradoxically , they might receive racial abuse ( mainly slurs ) , but that would not be related with them not being perceived as spanish . 
  beyond the natural ethnic diversity - which , i agree , it 's a factor - . 
  i would say there are cultural elements . 
  i would say there is a shock between the anglosaxon and the latin perception of belonging . 
  that 's why americans have so much trouble trying to classify the `` hispanics '' . 
  yeah , in spain is similar . 
  for me this way of thinking about nationality was weird and disturbing . 
  after some time living in denmark , you start to `` assimilate '' this idea of nationality and realize that people ( friends ) that you always considered locals in your home country would be considered foreigners by danish standards . 
  i always found it disturbing . 
  it 's probably the main reason why i left denmark . 
  yeah , he had danish friends . 
  he never talked about having problems for not being considered `` danish '' . 
  however , i do believe that there was some kind of impact . 
  when i was living in denmark , i hanged out with a pretty big group of `` foreigners '' ; some of those `` foreigners '' were raised in denmark and were - from my pov - danes . 
  but we never had a dane-dane hanging out with us . 
  i always thought it was weird . 
  in the us i would say is different , as everyone is from somewhere else . 
  in denmark i always felt it was pretty disturbing , as people who was culturally danish was not considered fully danish because of their surnames . 
  i have to say that this is a hot topic in denmark . 
  some people have a much more restrictive view on `` danishness '' than others . 
  however , my general impression is that it 's much harder to be considered dane in denmark than , say , spanish in spain . 
  the case of wozniacki is particularly interesting . 
  she is considered a dane , but i 'm afraid that is related with the fact of being the biggest sports star that denmark has right now . 
  i knew someone in denmark in exactly the same situation ( polish parents , born and raised in denmark , even had a danish accent speaking polish ) and he was not considered a dane . 
  in my experience , most of descendants of foreigners born and raised in denmark do n't consider themselves `` danish '' , including descendants of europeans . 
  they are not considered danish by most of danes , either . 
  it 's not only the muslims . 
  in denmark i met a few european descendants that did n't consider themselves danish either . 
  how much is she making ? 
  where ? 
  in tech i would say that the situation is not bad . 
  oh , i do think that le pen has a good shot in winning the first round , even if the candidate of lr is jupp\u00e9 . 
  the second round is another story . 
  she is currently polling 35 points behind jupp\u00e9 and 30 points behind fillon . 
  that 's much , much more than 10 . 
  given the point of the article , i find it - ironically - very nationalistic . 
  canada is not a special snowflake . 
  there are [ 5 european countries with economies bigger than canada ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp \\ ) ) : only for one , the uk , it can be argued that the country has taken a `` protectionist and xenophobic attitude '' . 
  this . 
  hofer was actually the heavy favorite in the first voting . 
  the last poll before the election gave him a 6 points advantage . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_austrian_presidential_election,_2016 ) . 
   also , what about spain ? 
  they are n't getting any migrants and they are also a net receiver in the eu , like wtf ? 
  foreign-born population in spain : 12.7 % italy : 9.5 % france : 11.9 % germany : 12.6 % so yeah , we are getting some migrants . 
  more than italy , france and germany . 
  if you meant `` refugees from the current wave '' , it 's true that we are getting few . 
  the reason is simple : [ spain has quite a lot of measures to avoid illegal immigrants to arrive to the country nowadays ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21674726-what-other-europeans-can-learn-spanish-efforts-limit-illegal-migration-forward-defence ) . 
  so this kind of immigrants do n't enter the eu through spain anymore . 
  and once the migrants arrive to europe through other countries , they do n't want to go to spain . 
  the major of barcelona is kind of crazy about getting some refugees , talking about them all the time and going to visit , but no luck so far . 
  i guess it 's because paella looks disgusting and they prefer swedish meatballs . 
   it is just spain has mostly immigration from latin america not really . 
  the most common origin for migrants in spain is romania ( 730k ) followed by morocco ( 714k ) . 
  the first latin american country , ecuador , only has 213k . 
  in total , only 22 % of our migrants come from latin american countries . 
  i believe that we do have more latin americans than any other european country , but saying that our migration is mainly from there is an overstretch . 
  i lived a few years in denmark and if swedish society is similar to the danish one ( not the politics , which i know are very different ) , then in my experience spain is much better integrating migrants .
