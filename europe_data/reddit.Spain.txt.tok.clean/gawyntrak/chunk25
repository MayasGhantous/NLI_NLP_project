  in gni % we are one of the smallest receivers ( just after ireland , i believe ) . 
  not with every country , according that map . 
  mainly in spain , italy and , to a lesser degree , uk . 
  this is the useful data . 
  cross out france and probably belgium . 
  that leaves you a currency union of germany , netherlands and luxembourg . 
  yeah , ireland is a surprisingly popular destination for spaniards that want to learn english . 
  it 's like the brits , but nicer . 
  yeah , in ireland there are many spanish doing english courses . 
  it has been popular for a lot of years . 
  if you mean spaniards living in ireland , according eurostat there are 4.431 . 
  that 's very few . 
  come on , there is . 
  i agree that it 's not as big as some people imagine it - particularly people more to the north - , but it exists . 
  it 's surprising for me the sudden popularity of kilian jornet out of catalonia . 
  here he has been famous for many years . 
  for example ara , a catalan newspaper , [ has 222 news under the tag `` kilian jornet '' ] ( http://www.ara.cat/etiquetes/kilian_jornet.html ) , the first one from 2011 . 
  the other newspaper popular in rural catalonia , el punt avui , has [ around 100 articles ] ( http://www.elpuntavui.cat/cercar.html?publicacions[0]=pub_elpunt&amp;publicacions[1]=pub_avui&amp;publicacions[2]=pub_economic&amp;searchword=kilian%20jornet&amp;start=80 ) about him . 
  madrile\u00f1os are cool , i would give them the title of honorary ~ ~ aryans ~ ~ catalans . 
  there was a pretty good one in between jos\u00e9 garc\u00eda-margallo ( then spain 's minister of foreign affairs ) and oriol junqueras ( leader of an independentist party who is leading the polls right now in catalonia ) . 
  you can watch it [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdyg9ff1su ) . 
  san francisco . 
  i know that this a liberal paradise , and i wonder if i would have problems in other places . 
  oh , now i see that you are american . 
  for sure you know about the bachelor !, 
  in my particular case , i 'm dark-haired and dark-eyed , but still i never got issues . 
  a few people told me i look `` italian '' ( which yeah , spaniards and italians look similar ) . 
  and about the diversity points , you are absolutely right . 
  i have never done it , but i know spanish people who boast about getting benefits as `` minorities '' . 
  this is the cto of quora :  spaniards in the us call ourselves hispanic because there are some benefits to that . 
  for example , when i was working in a us university that came very handy to be considered a `` minority '' . 
  oh , technically in the census i 'm not white . 
  i 'm supposed to be `` hispanic white '' . 
  however , that does not mean shit . 
  if you get discriminated , it 's based on your phenotype . 
  an example ; a few years ago a tv program called `` the bachelor '' ( typical tv shite with a single person choosing suitors ) promoted themselves as integrating people of color with a hispanic bachelor . 
  [ this was the colored guy ] ( http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140106084553-juan-pablo-the-bachelor-story-top.jpg ) . 
  it 's similar for southern europeans . 
  actually that 's the main reason why i moved to the us . 
  [ the catalan government has already denied that ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20170522/422805024847/govern-junts-pel-si-desmientes-independencia-dui-inmediata-referendum.html ) . 
  yep . 
  and still , america is not safer . 
  `` self-defense homicides '' as we could call them , are a rarity . 
  damn , i have lived in a few european cities , and right now i live in a big city the us . 
  i love the us . 
  however , i feel significantly less safe where i live now that in any other city that i have lived in europe . 
  a homicide , by definition ( `` a deliberate and unlawful killing '' ) is not legal . 
  america is not safer . 
   a large portions of catalan people ( the ones that speak spanish natively ) will be forced to choose between staying in their homeland as second class citizens ( their language will no longer be an official one ) or be kicked from their homes [ ... ] no secessionist party speaks of a 2 official language catalonia seceded from spain and they will never concede this point . 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  the two biggest parties that support catalonia 's independence want spanish to be an official language , have said it multiple times , and have it in their program . 
  this is oriol junqueras , the leader of the most radical of the two , erc : [ oriol junqueras : ` spanish will be official in the catalan republic ' ] ( http://www.naciodigital.cat/noticia/66671/oriol/junqueras/castella/sera/oficial/republica/catalana ) . 
  moreover :  `` the leader of erc has added that it 's ` heritage ' of all the catalans , the same as spanish culture '' this is from the program of junts pel s\u00ed , the coalition of these two parties : `` spanish language will continue being an official language in catalonia '' . 
  [ the program ] ( http://juntspelsi.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/150905_programa_electoral_v1.pdf ) , it 's in page 74 . 
  edit : it 's a [ the_donald troll ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/6buzi0/based_rockstar_games_is_now_destroying_sjws_we/dhq1p9f/ ) . 
  ignore for your own sanity . 
  yes , i 'm from barcelona too . 
   i know about lithuania because my girlfriend is from there . 
  when we met i was 25 , and she was surprised that i still lived with my parents . 
  she and most of her friends moved much earlier . 
  mmmm ... spain and ireland have both more immigrants than france . 
  cultural differences are very important . 
  in lithuania , if you are over 25 and living with your parents , people wonder if you have some kind of `` problem '' . 
  many lithuanians that i met rented a room in an apartment with unknown people ( sometimes grannies ) just to be independent . 
  complaining is cultural . 
  it 's the same in spain : the health care is pretty good ( i have lived in a few countries , and i still think it 's the best ) but people complain non-stop . 
  are you a real german ?? 
  around 50 % of the brits in spain are under 55 , so they are not only `` retired guys who do n't need to integrate '' ; the british enclaves are not only populated my old people . 
  these british enclaves have become `` bolt-holes for some of britain 's most wanted murderers , gangsters and thieves '' ( i 'm quoting a british paper here ) , to the point that scotland yard is collaborating with the spanish police to catch them in an [ operation called `` captura '' ] ( http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/most-wanted-hub/operation-captura-spain ) . 
  we have also had multiple cases of british sex-offenders and paedophiles that decided to hide in spain and continued their `` operations '' there ; in fact , the most famous case of this type in the last 20 years in spain was about a british criminal , [ tony alexander king ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wanninkhof_case ) . 
  so yeah , brits are very much seen as disruptive immigrants . 
  if you are lucky enough for them to explode after db , even if it 's a minute later . 
  if not , you will be lazy southerners and * blablablabla * . 
  deutsche bank must be pretty f * cked . 
  that 's interesting because ... doing something like the agenda 2010 is politically impossible in spain . 
  spaniards prefer very much their high unemployment than doing that . 
  however , i think that spain 's problems are even deeper ; the years before agenda 2010 your unemployment was in between 9 and 11 % ; our average of the last 40 years is 16 % . 
  even 7 or 8 % is unachievable - or at least unsustainable - , discounting strong job market reforms which would be very unpopular in the country . 
  as the job market is , the booms and busts cycle will continue . 
  said in a different way : in spain , 27 % of unemployment was dramatic . 
  18 % is bad . 
  15 % will be quite ok ( lower than the average of the last 40 years ) . 
  spain never had unemployment under 8 % in the last 30 years . 
  that includes the times of the economic boom , when we had a very high level of immigration to the country ( higher than any other eu state ) . 
  assuming that 10 % of unemployment in spain means the same of what would mean in germany is wrong . 
  you do n't . 
  in the eurozone , only netherlands and germany have it . 
  edit : oh , and luxembourg . 
  what 's the joke ? 
  plenty of foreigners use the ehic in spain . 
  eu citizens get the same coverage as spaniards ; they have the [ european health insurance card ] ( https://www.frenchentree.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/european-health-card-_photo-by-antoine-fleury-gobert.jpg ) . 
  it 's not a map of the whole central europe though : russia and japan are missing . 
  it 's pretty unexpected that both italy and spain have a bigger percentage of industry in their economies than france and uk . 
   `` austerity '' is just doublespeak . 
  the point is that you actually want germany and other northern european countries to permanently subsidise your countries france + italy + spain + portugal is a net contributor . 
  in 2015 we - as a block - gave 2652.6 m ; in 2014 , 7329.7 m. 
  as other redditors say , the issue here is not subsidies . 
   unless she has a secret second career as a super villain that 's sch\u00e4uble , only that it 's his first career , and it 's not a secret . 
  the pence-kaine debate was pretty good too , despite pence being ... well , pence . 
  the data i gave is the net contribution , so that 's already taken into account .
