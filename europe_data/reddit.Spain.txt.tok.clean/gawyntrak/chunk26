   the eu transfers 130-150 bn $ every year , mostly from the rich countrys to the poor . 
  that 's kind of irrelevant in a conversation about southern europe . 
  italy is a contributor ; portugal and spain are small receivers per capita . 
  the eu transfers are mainly north to east . 
  no , it 's france . 
  if you checked the data from 2015 ( the latest one ) , it 's an outlier . 
  edit : i checked the data . 
  the eu makes `` plans '' for seven years . 
  the last one was from 2007 to 2013 . 
  during this period , france gave a net contribution of 41.651 m ; uk one of 34.099 m. 
  even including the last two years , france has a contribution of 54.338 m and uk , 50.550 m, 
   as late as 1963 , according to the newspaper series , a sterilization was carried out on someone deemed of `` mixed race . '', 
  [ ... ]  runcis uncovered the case of the young woman who had not mastered her confirmation studies well enough to satisfy her priest . 
  `` i thought it was horrible , terrible history , '' she said . 
  `` i thought i had to write about this . '', 
  dagens nyheter published an account of the 72-year-old woman who had been forced to undergo sterilization after being judged mentally slow as a child because she could not read the blackboard at school -- she suffered only from poor vision . 
  `` i am not ashamed , '' she told the newspaper . 
  `` others should be . '', 
   for one thing in spain it is not uncommon for many generations to live in the same house . 
  maybe in the 1950s . 
  now it 's very uncommon . 
  it 's true that children live longer with their parents , but being married and living with the parents is a big `` no-no '' . 
  that 's probably the reason why spaniards marry later than in any other eu country except sweden . 
  anyway , your point stands somehow : it 's very common for grandparents in spain to babysit their grandchildren daily , something that i understand is not common in other countries . 
  i downvoted you until i realized that you meant * those * southerners . 
  it 's kind of funny , when spaniards say that they ca n't have families because of a lack of financial security ... 
  i guess it 's a matter of perspective . 
   well , you also have italy and maybe spain . 
  i would add france there too . 
  i always related with catholicism somehow . 
  i would say that the current economic position of spain is slightly better than italy 's : less debt , more growth and a [ higher employment ratio ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:employment_rate,_age_group_20%e2%80%9364,_2015_ ( % 25 \\ ) _ yb16_iii . png ) . 
  northern italy is no more `` industrious '' than the industrialized parts of spain : basque country , catalonia and madrid . 
  uhm ... the first one sounds substantially more likely to me . 
  morocco 's statement that there is * no political representative , from any level , * that can receive flanders ' and catalonia 's presidents sounds completely unbelievable . 
  particularly taking into account that [ the president of andalusia was received by the king ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/andalucia/2014/09/12/5412d86f22601d18648b457d.html ) . 
  on your first suggestion , yeah , spain is a very powerful country from morocco 's perspective : it 's [ its number one trading partner ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/mar/ ) . 
  moreover , the last spanish foreign minister has admitted that spain [ `` owns favours '' to other countries ] ( http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2017/03/23/catalunya/1490270445_270478.html ) on the catalan issue . 
  this is the data : - younger than 15 : 12.430 - 15-24 : 15.358 - 25-34 : 19.806 - 35-44 : 32.667 - 45-54 : 49.005 - 55-65 : 53.521 as i commented in my last point , there might be an important number of early retired people in spain . 
  however , even assuming that everyone over 54 is retired ( which is bollocks ) and that there are zero retired spaniards in uk ( which is bollocks too ) , still gives you a slightly higher number for brits in spain than the other way around ( 129.276 vs 127.064 ) . 
  there are still more british people in working age living in spain than the other way around . 
  according eurostat : - as of 2016 , there are around 182.797 brits younger than 65 years old living in spain . 
  - there are a total of 127.064 spaniards in uk , in total . 
  this does not take into account that there might be old spaniards in uk ( people that migrated during the 60s , for example ) . 
  - even assuming that all the brits in spain older than 54 are retired ( which is bollocks ) and there are zero retired spaniards in uk ( which is bollocks too , in the last year this info is available -2004 - 10 % of the spaniards in uk were 65 or older ) , there still would be more working age brits in spain than the other way around . 
  according glassdoor , [ the average salary in germany for se is 54k ] ( https://www.glassdoor.com/salaries/berlin-software-engineer-salary-srch_il.0,6_im1020_ko7,24.htm ) . 
  in the us , [ the average is 95k ] ( https://www.glassdoor.com/salaries/san-francisco-software-engineer-salary-srch_il.0,13_im759_ko14,31.htm ) ( in euros , 87k ) . 
  i 'm quite surprised . 
  i would n't have left europe if 85k were `` not too special '' . 
  define `` higher qualification jobs '' . 
  according the offers i see , software engineers in germany make around 50-60k . 
  how do you make 85k in germany ? 
  with 70k a year in the bay area [ you are considered low income ] ( http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/bay-area-low-income-105k-hud-11094978.php ) . 
  it 's certainly not enough to live comfortably , except if you share an apartment . 
  a shitty one bedroom apartment here is at least 2.5 k per month ; that would leave you 1.5 k net to pay everything each month . 
  and the other stuff is expensive too . 
   goes to show how rich the us is compared to western europe , their lower income class has a higher income than the middle income class in italy and spain . 
  [ that 's not true ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2017/04/24/middle-class-fortunes-in-western-europe/st_2017-04-24_western-europe-middle-class_0-05/ ) . 
  anyway , you are right that europe excels in other factors . 
  as a spaniard living in the us , i strongly believe that lower classes have it much better back home than here . 
  you would be surprised how many european tech workers and companies move to the us . 
  hispanics in general are mixed , but we are talking about `` white hispanics '' which have more european ancestry and look accordingly . 
  these people tend to look quite southern european : think diego luna or andy garcia . 
  andy garcia is a good example : he played an italian in the godfather part iii , nobody thought it was weird ; pacino has played hispanic characters multiple times . 
  i know that southern europeans were not considered white until the mid 20th century , but they ( and their looks ) are considered white now . 
  for a second generation white hispanic , `` whiteness '' is as easy to achieve as changing your surname ( like the sheens did ) . 
  charlie sheen is not `` latino '' , but it is considered `` hispanic '' . 
  when i say white i have european white in mind , and the `` white hispanics '' fit in that box . 
  they are certainly not less white than al pacino or jimmy kimmel , to give a couple of examples . 
  i just wanted to say that i wish that at some point spain gets such a strong social state as france . 
  * vive la france !, 
  i disagree with you . 
  [ france has the highest fertility rate in europe ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:total_fertility_rate,_1960%e2%80%932015_ ( live_births_per_woman \\ ) _ yb17.png ) . 
  that means it 's higher than countries with an even more stable financial situation , like germany , austria or denmark . 
  moreover , stay-at-home moms are very rare in spain nowadays . 
  this part of your comment is what made me to comment back : you seem to suggest that in spain it is expected to be a stay-at-home mom , which is bollocks . 
  in fact , the female labor participation rate in spain is slightly higher than in france , according the [ world bank ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sl.tlf.cact.fe.zs?page=4&amp;year_high_desc=true ) ( 52 to 50 ) . 
  i would say that the difference is part a stronger social security system which makes it less troublesome to have kids , part the presence of mena descendants that tend to have more kids . 
  why ? 
  ironically , he was a * pied-noir * of alsatian and spanish descent . 
   is there some arbitrary limit to what defines a `` civilization '' to these people . 
  as a rule of thumb , if you are european and do n't have sweets for breakfast ( croissants , pastries ) , you are not civilized . 
  many of the british `` expats '' in spain do n't plan to return at some point : in fact , they come here to spend the last part of their lives . 
  when i wrote immigrant i meant that the immigration `` wave '' is still in living memory : sorry , i used to live in denmark and there the children and grandchildren of immigrants are called immigrants themselves . 
  going back to the point , that applies to hispanics too : the majority of them ( 65 % ) are us-born . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.pewhispanic.org/2016/04/19/statistical-portrait-of-hispanics-in-the-united-states-key-charts/#hispanic-pop ) . 
  i believe that in the case of france the percentage of local-born is even higher , but i still think that the situation is similar enough ; certainly much more similar than the native americans/african americans . 
  the numbers are approximations : as you know , france does not register religion . 
  however , most of numbers are in the same ballpark . 
  i made an average of slightly different numbers i found online . 
  the sources :  of the 67,500 people currently behind bars in france , it is estimated that 70 per cent are muslim -- when they comprise only eight per cent of the french public [ source ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11352268/what-is-going-wrong-in-frances-prisons.html )  about 60 to 70 percent of all inmates in the country 's prison system are muslim , according to muslim leaders , sociologists and researchers , though muslims make up only about 12 percent of the country 's population . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/28/ar2008042802560.html ) i 'm not cherry-picking : native americans and blacks are not immigrants . 
  hispanics are the 16 % of the population and 19 % of the prisoners . 
  i would say that 's quite ok , particularly taking into account that many hispanics are immigrants . 
  in comparison , france has less than 10 % of muslim population , while more than 60 % of its inmates are muslim . 
   like how americans succeeded at integrating black and hispanic minorities or canadians at integrating native americans . 
  neither native americans nor african americans were immigrants ; theirs is a different situation . 
  about the hispanic minority i would say that yes , us is pretty successful integrating it . 
  imagine how it would be france with a 40 % muslim population ; it 's unthinkable and it would probably imply a very different france . 
  well , this is exactly the situation of california right now : [ 38.8 % of californians are hispanic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_u.s._states_by_hispanic_and_latino_population ) . 
  and that 's california , one of the most progressive and economically-advanced places in the world ; certainly not a shithole riddled by `` race wars '' .
