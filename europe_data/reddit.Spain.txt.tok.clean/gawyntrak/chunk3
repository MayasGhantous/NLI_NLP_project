   their representatives negotiated a government this is exactly what has not happened in spain : psoe has given the government to rajoy for free , with no negotiations . 
   also guess why since its inception in the xixth century nationalism here has been led by the left . 
  pujol was not leading nationalism in cat ? 
  camb\u00f3 ? 
  you seem to think that only left-wing catalan nationalists are catalan nationalists . 
  people do n't remember anymore , but after the last election , psoe had the `` momentum '' as americans say : everybody thought that they were going to be surpassed by podemos , and it did n't happen . 
  asking for something in exchange of an abstention would be seen as very reasonable by everyone . 
  if pp would n't have accepted , they would have been punished for that in the third elections . 
  psoe played incredibly bad its cards . 
  they brought themselves to a corner . 
  most importantly , they could have asked for something in exchange . 
  even rajoy 's head could have been on the table . 
  and what did you expect ? 
  the only stunning thing about this abstention is that psoe has not been able to get anything in exchange . 
  at least in denmark , movies were subtitled in danish . 
  we are all smarts farts for history . 
  i just do n't want to be there now that britain has decided to fart on its foreign-born population . 
   much of northern europe ( except for france ) has almost as high a percentage of english-speakers , especially in major cities . 
  however , the media in those countries is not in english : forget about watching tv ( except channels from other countries ) , going to the theatre , watching a movie not originally in english and many other things . 
   stay for happier , more laidback society well , post-brexit britain certainly does n't sound like that . 
  if it 's about world cups , you could join spain . 
  there may be some free seats soon . 
   most likely they 'll just continue the current system where everyone gets their passport checked ( we are n't in schengen ) but you get put in two seperate lines to do it . 
  right now , as a eu citizen you do n't need a passport to travel to the uk : with a national id is enough . 
  you can `` hunt '' if the same ip is repeated multiple times , or if there are many ips from a country where there are not many brits . 
  of course , the system is not perfect , but it stops major abuses . 
  moreover , if a petition would be signed by a 95 % of foreign ips it would be easy to detect as false . 
  you wrote that * no one * has proposed to `` shut the door '' to all immigrants . 
  even if 90 % of those signatures would be bots , that 's still tens of thousands of brits who want no immigration at all : that 's clearly not `` no one '' . 
  yes , and that 's why a developer gets paid so much more in the us than in europe . 
  uk software engineers get paid less than half of the salary of us software engineers . 
  however , the us tech sector is so immensely strong that it can afford that . 
  you ( or any other country , in that respect ) are not the us . 
  there is no european apple , no european google , no european facebook , no european microsoft . 
  [ software engineer ( uk average ) : 37.469 gbp ] ( https://www.glassdoor.com/salaries/london-software-engineer-salary-srch_il.0,6_im1035_ko7,24.htm ) [ software engineer ( us average ) : 95.195 $ ] ( https://www.glassdoor.com/salaries/san-francisco-software-engineer-salary-srch_il.0,13_im759_ko14,31.htm ), 
   if you ca n't invest an hour of your time to fill in a form in order to move to another country , then you should probably stay home . 
  an hour of your time ? 
  i guess you never applied for a visa in a developed country . 
  my visa process to the us took 4 months , and that 's short , as i was applying for an `` easy '' one , an intracompany transfer visa . 
  the dossier i had to bring to the embassy was around 300-400 pages ; my company had to invest thousands of dollars in lawyers . 
  `` an hour of your time '' , lolol . 
  it asks some information proving that you are a british citizen or a uk resident :  you create a petition . 
  only british citizens and uk residents can create or sign a petition . 
  [ source ] ( https://petition.parliament.uk/help ) i have been checking , and there are some people that falsify , but they kind of get hunted using the ip . 
   remember the petition just after the referendum , turned out a million of the votes came from outside of uk . 
  they mean nothing !, 
  well , i think that petition in particular clearly showed that there are a lot of remainers who do n't like the result . 
  is n't that the case ? 
  moreover , for signing those petitions you need to be a british citizen ; i tried to sign one - not related with brexit , some health system issue that a scot friend was promoting - and it was not possible . 
   as for skilled immigration . 
  why do we need european immigration ? 
  skilled people all over the world wan na come to the uk . 
  because there are not so many skilled people all over the world , particularly in fields in which the demand is high . 
  going back to tech , skilled people from less developed countries do n't want to go to the uk : they want to go to the us , where wages are * much * higher . 
  the eu/uk , canada and australia are the next-best option . 
  after brexit , uk becomes a much less attractive destination . 
  i will give you a peek of the situation : uk already has a special visa for highly skilled tech workers : the `` tech nation visa scheme '' . 
  in 2 years a half it has received ... [ 257 applications ] ( http://www.techcityuk.com/tech-nation-visa/ ) . 
  you sound like uk would have an insanely high level of immigration compared with other western european countries , something that would justify to `` raise the bar '' to reduce the number . 
  that 's not the case : your percentage of foreign-born population ( 13 % ) is very similar to other big eu countries like germany ( 12.6 % ) , france ( 11.9 % ) or spain ( 12.7 % ) ; and is significantly lower than ireland ( 16.2 % ) , austria ( 17.2 % ) , belgium ( 16.1 % ) or sweden ( 16.4 % ) . 
  you also have [ ukip proposing to ban immigration for 5 years ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/07/ukip-ban-immigrants-nigel-farage ) . 
  beyond their power , petitions show clearly about the direction that the people of a country is taking : many liberal brits were swearing that brexit was impossible until a few months ago . 
  moreover , even if the final result of brexit is not a total ban on immigration , it 's obvious that there will be a visa process . 
  any kind of visa process will make more difficult for british companies to hire highly skilled europeans . 
  wage-wise , uk is an average western eu country ( [ 8th out of 28 according to the oecd , ppp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_average_wage ) ) : why would an eu citizen choose uk instead of germany or netherlands ? 
  this is particularly relevant in tech , a field in which there is a very strong demand for highly skilled workers . 
  two parliament proposals asking to stop * all * immigration : [ one ] ( https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/106477 ) and [ two ] ( https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/106477 ) . 
  the first has close to half a million signatures , the other over 200k . 
   where the hell is this money coming from ? 
  thin air ? 
  nhs . 
  city . 
  countryside is fine for a few months , but in the long term i need the liveliness of a big city . 
  i 'm originally from barcelona and i love it . 
  later i moved to copenhagen , and i always found it a little bit boring ... 
  losing lunch for changing from venstre to sd ? 
  come on . 
  i thought he would have changed from df to radikale or something like this . 
  pp ideologically is quite a regular european center-right party , not very different from cdu or les republicains . 
  there is no afd or national front in spain . 
  that alone already makes spain ( and portugal ) quite left-winged . 
  and no , it 's not because spain has no immigrants ; it does have more than france and germany , according [ eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:foreign-born_population_by_country_of_birth,_1_january_2015_ ( % c2 % b9 ) _ yb16.png ) . 
  and i also agree with your parent about pride . 
  it 's kind of funny coming from someone with my flair , but many spaniards have a grotesquely negative image about their own country . 
  us is a land of immigrants , that 's true ... but until very recently , it was a land of northern european , * white * immigrants . 
  chinese immigration was banned for many years ( [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chinese_exclusion_act ) ) and even southern and eastern european migration was severely controlled ( [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_act_of_1924 ) ) . 
  i quote from the last article :  the law was primarily aimed at further restricting immigration of southern europeans and eastern europeans . 
  in addition , it severely restricted the immigration of africans and outright banned the immigration of arabs and asians . 
  according to the u.s. department of state office of the historian the purpose of the act was `` to preserve the ideal of american homogeneity '' . 
  most of non-white population before the 60s were the african-americans who came to the us as slaves . 
  not exactly a great example of `` diversity '' . 
  i will give you some more objective data . 
  in 1790 , `` whites '' were the 80 % of the population , with the rest being black . 
  in 1970 , the percentage of `` whites '' had * increased * to 88 % . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/historical_racial_and_ethnic_demographics_of_the_united_states ) . 
  i agree that open racism , like the situation you talk about , is more looked down upon in the us than in europe . 
  a racial slur is not considered much worse than any other kind of slurs , while in the us you ca n't even say the n-word to say it 's bad . 
  however , i do think that in the us there is much more race-based prejudice . 
  thinking that a black person may act different than a white person because of its race sounds ... weird to me . 
  i met a few black french , and i never thought about them being different in any way than your average pierre martin .
