  here in the us even the minorities themselves defend that they are `` different '' . 
  ironically , that is racism for me . 
  at least in one case , they did . 
  i gave the example of mulattos , because in one conversation about this , the guy - an electric engineer - told me that he thought spaniards look like a common friend , who is from dominican republic and is mulatto . 
  and quite a dark one , like obama . 
  i blame the us influence , and the `` hispanic '' concept . 
  my point is that the us is similar to europe : there is not much racism in big cities , but the smaller towns - and the people from smaller towns - is another story . 
  in my case , the worst situations are usually with any kind of interaction with a state officer . 
  airports and borders in the us are extra-fun with a `` hispanic '' name because as one officer told me `` you know ... spain , latin america ... '' . 
  and there was that guy from sacramento who questioned be non-stop to discover if i was white or not , because `` i looked italian '' . 
  depends of the person , of course . 
  when i was living in denmark i met a few people that sincerely thought that spaniards were like mulattos . 
  and no rural hillbillies ( i met very few of those ) , but people with degrees . 
  i live in san francisco , so yeah , it 's inside my realm of experience . 
  in fact , that 's exactly why i commented . 
  you would be surprised . 
  many northern europeans think that spaniards are brown-skinned , like danny trejo or ronaldinho .

  not like in the us , which each and every small city is an example of multiculturalism and tolerance . 
  nope . 
  this cancellation is not going anywhere . 
  the sentence establishes that the catalan government ca n't ban bullfighting , but can `` regulate '' it . 
  and of course , the catalan government has already announced that the coming regulations will make it economically unviable . 
  moreover , the only bullfighting arena in catalonia right now is in barcelona , a city which has a municipal prohibition which has not been cancelled . 
   `` when it comes to advanced literacy skills , you might be better off getting a high school degree in japan , finland or the netherlands than getting a tertiary degree in italy , spain or greece , '' says mr schleicher . 
  maybe , but this is not for what tertiary degrees are for , at least in europe . 
  tertiary degrees are supposed to be specialized education ; i would much rather prefer that med school teaches students how to practice better medicine than how to read and write better . 
  continuing with this example , japan has only 3 of the 200 best universities in medicine ; italy has 7 and spain 3 . 
  in engineering , japan has 5 ; italy 7 and spain 5 * . 
  and japan has twice the population of italy , and almost three times the population of spain . 
  * : all this according the shanghai rankings . 
  believe me , the us is harder . 
  catalan here , living in ca and loving it . 
  you will be very welcome in spain . 
  i 'm not danish , but i lived in denmark two years and half . 
  the default answer my teacher gave me about any question on danish pronunciation was something like `` no rules , you have to memorize it '' . 
  danish is way worse than english , in that respect . 
  this is bollocks . 
  italy does not receive funds from the eu : it has been a net contributor each of the last 30 years . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.money-go-round.eu/country.aspx?id=it ) . 
  spanish economy is growing at a rate of around 3 % : last year it was a 3.2 % ; and it 's projected to grow at 2.6 % this year and 2.5 % in 2017 . 
  most of ee countries grew less than spain last year . 
  unemployment is another , very different , story . 
  nah , spain is still richer than poland . 
  i think we would be something like florida . 
  holiday and retirement place , sunny and yeah , with spanish-speakers . 
   spain is growing but when you know where it come from , it is little short as a result . 
  from where does it come from ? 
  spain had multiple surpluses during the 2000s , something that the czech republic has still never achieved . 
  this is not about a `` little bit of fiscal responsibility '' . 
  assuming that a country can have a surplus , or a balanced budget , in any situation is absurd . 
  why the spanish flair ? 
  just curiosity . 
   people in the uk were retiring to spain before the eu and certainly before free movement . 
  yeah , but in much smaller numbers . 
  in 2001 , there were around 100k brits in spain ; in 2014 there were 300k . 
  i did n't find data from 1985 ( the year before spain joined the eu ) , but i guess the number will be even smaller . 
  moreover , the majority of the brits registered in the census in spain are under the age of retirement : around two thirds , if i do n't remember wrong . 
  edit : actually , i found some ( general ) data about, 
  does n't 1 prove his point ? 
  if you have a viceroy is because you are autonomous . 
  the definition is of autonomous is `` having self-government , at least to a significant degree '' . 
  autonomous ! = independent . 
  i mean , sicily and naples also had a viceroy when they were under the spanish king . 
  does that prove that they were not autonomous ? 
  that sounds soooo cute . 
  here in california people talks about `` washington '' - referring to the federal government - all the time . 
  it clearly does . 
  a picture of sexy mohammed in jeans is missing . 
   i think the only way 20 % could be counted in denmark was if they asked in certain areas where `` new danes '' live and then made them represent the country . 
  that 's such a danish thing to say . 
  brings memories from cph . 
  from where do you think the central government gets its money from ? 
  that money comes mainly from the taxpayers , and [ catalans pay more than they receive ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/vangdata/20150722/54434059371/ranking-deficit-fiscal-espana.html ) . 
  which , btw , i think it 's fine . 
  catalan master race . 
   we 're the second largest economy in the eu and one , if not the fastest growing . 
  in 2015 , uk 's gdp growth rate was 2.2 . 
  that 's exactly the same as the eu . 
  [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00115&amp;plugin=1 ) . 
  as you can see in the link , there were 13 countries in the eu with a gdp growth higher than the uk . 
  the uk was the 14th fastest growing economy out of 28 . 
  that 's almost the definition of average . 
  so ... not true . 
  totally agree with your scots .
