  those damn poles should learn from the old brits that live in spain , who barely use the health care and speak perfect spanish . 
   all racists want stricter immigration controls , but not all people wanting stricter immigration controls are racist . 
  which is exactly what i said . 
  given that xenophobes tend to be for stricter immigration , the quantity of people for stricter immigration is probably a good predictor of the average level of xenophobia of a place . 
  maybe he refers to [ spain ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/10/business/global/spain-moves-closer-to-bailout-of-banks.html?_r=0 ) . 
   responding to increasingly urgent calls from across europe and the united states , spain on saturday agreed to accept a bailout for its cash-starved banks as european finance ministers offered an aid package of up to $ 125 billion . 
  the vast majority of people that want to `` regain control over immigration '' is because they want to reduce it . 
  when you want to reduce something is because you find it negative or harmful . 
  migration issues was one of the main points of the leave campaign , and the [ second biggest single reason for leave voters ] ( http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/ ) . 
  it 's kind of obvious that there is a correlation between `` leave '' vote and anti-immigrant feeling . 
  i would give an example : if i would be a gay pole , i would probably prefer living in big cities that in a small town where pis got 57 % of the vote . 
  hey , maybe i 'm wrong and pis voters totally love the lgbt community and they vote for kaczy\u0144ski 's because his haircut is supercool and queer , but i would not bet my life on that . 
  according your own source , 33 % of the people that voted `` leave '' did it because brexit `` offered the best chance for the uk to regain control over immigration and its own borders '' . 
  33 % is a large portion to me . 
  voting for brexit is strongly correlated with having a negative view on immigration and foreigners in general . 
  i 'm not saying that all brexiters are against immigration , but it was obviously one of the strongest points of the leave campaign . 
  moreover , you seem to assume that the fact that there are `` a lot '' of foreigners ( 25 % ) means that the town is more tolerant of foreigners . 
  i do n't think that 's true . 
  for example , here in the us , the states that have more trouble with racism are the ones with the bigger percentage of african-american population ( the south ) . 
  and well , let me go full-godwin here ( too tempting ) : germany certainly had much more jews in 1935 than now , but i would n't say it was more `` jew-friendly '' . 
  [ chatham voted overwhelmingly for leave . 
  ] ( http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent/news/kent-backs-brexit-97358/ )  [ in kent ] the most euro-sceptic area is sittingbourne and sheppey , where 62 % favour leaving the eu ; followed by north thanet ( 58 % ) and chatham and aylesford ( 57 % ) . 
  i do n't have the pleasure to know chatham , but a small town where 57 % of the population votes for leaving the european union does n't sound like an extremely welcoming place for foreigners . 
   marcora does n't even have to talk in his mother tongue to spark a reaction : in his adopted hometown of chatham in kent are you from chatham ? 
  i guess that reactions to foreigners are not the same in chatham ( population , 76k ) than in london . 
  now we know why all those indians and nigerians want to move to uk . 
  they are english !, 
  i think everybody in catalonia knows that the international community does n't give a fuck . 
  the referendums are not about that . 
  the referendums are a way to justify a unilateral declaration of independence . 
  and with a region with a gdp 25 % bigger than greece leaving unilaterally , you will have to give a fuck , even if it 's for supporting a military occupation of catalonia . 
  i 'm from barcelona , so i know that quite well . 
  i have never met anyone in barcelona that sleeps siesta . 
  the only spaniards that i know that do siesta during summer are my uncles , that live in a little village in granada . 
  where exactly are you from that gets everyday to 40\u00bac ? 
  damn , [ that 's not normal even in seville ] ( http://www.holiday-weather.com/seville/averages/ ) . 
  moreover , your article is very interesting , and it actually shows exactly what i meant . 
  spaniards do n't nap more than other countries : [ 34 % of americans took a nap on the last 24 hours ] ( http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2009/07/29/nap-time/ ) . 
  i disagree . 
  - those temperatures are not normal in spain . 
  they are absolutely abnormal in northern spain ( [ temperatures for barcelona , max temperature in august , 29\u00ba c ] ( http://www.holiday-weather.com/malaga/averages/ ) ) , and not normal either in the coastal cities of the south ( [ temperatures for malaga , max temperature in august , 31\u00ba c ] ( http://www.holiday-weather.com/malaga/averages/ ) ) . 
  spain is not seville . 
  - it 's kind of ironical that you talk about spain having long days in summer . 
  the thing is ... spain has * much * shorter days than northern europe in summer . 
  in copenhagen , the southernest capital of scandinavia , the sun rises at 4:30 am and sets at 10pm in summer . 
  and the more north you go , the longer it gets . 
  most of spaniards i met living in scandinavia had trouble sleeping during summer : the days were too long . 
  edit : i mean , i have no doubt that what you are saying is true , but it 's certainly not common in `` spain '' . 
  it happens a lot in spain ? 
  seriously ? 
   foreign secretary also boasted of his ` beautiful , ' ` well-functioning turkish washing machine . '  in may [ ... ] johnson won a poetry prize for a rude limerick about turkish president recep tayyip erdo\u011fan having sex with a goat . 
  it seems quite obvious to me that breaking international treaties and limiting benefits to taxpayers according the passport they hold is pretty hard-right . 
  are you into masochism ? 
  about latinos ... the most crazy catalanophobe i have ever met was a cuban . 
  i met him in copenhagen , he had never even been in spain . 
  let 's say that the nicest thing he told about cat was that catalan was not a language . 
  another day he insisted that catalans were poor and lived out of spanish money ( ??? ) . 
  he even avoided talking with me , i only know this because he told my girlfriend - who is not catalan - . 
  in the fb group `` expats in barcelona '' from time to time there are comments about how `` annoying '' catalan is . 
  anyway , many of the `` expats '' are the kind of people that would complain because there are no tacos in a traditional catalan restaurant ... 
  to which kind of school did he go ? 
  this experience does not seem to be common at all . 
  for example , according the cambridge monitor on spanish millennials , 60 % of the young spaniards do n't believe in god . 
  you can find the report [ here ] ( http://www.cambridge.es/content/download/4893/36914/informe+millennials+medios.pdf ) , page 87 . 
  moreover , of the 30 % that do believe ( there is a 10 % of `` others '' ) , only 14 % believe in god as presented in the catholic religion . 
  this . 
  i can understand what you mean , but i think that southern europe is not a good example . 
  southern europeans go to university less and have better universities than eastern europeans , for example . 
  check the rankings . 
  the `` master 's degree working at mcdonald 's '' is a thing here in the states , and the best universities in the world are in the usa . 
  spanish atheist numbers will increase as the generation that lived under general fat-ass ( aka franco ) passes away . 
  for my generation believing is not common , and i 'm 30 . 
  are hairdressers traditionally xenophobic in scandinavia ? 
  i had exactly the same problem once in copenhagen . 
  maybe i should have sued . 
  to migration in general , or out-of-eu migration ? 
  it 's an important point , given that many of the migrants in the eu are from ee . 
  denmark has moved * much * more to the right than any other western eu country , with the possible exception of austria . 
  it 's not a good example . 
  or is as good example as spain or portugal , which sit in the opposite side of the spectrum . 
  for the ones that do n't know the danish political reality : imagine a bundestag where afd has more deputies ( and votes ) than merkel 's cdu . 
  this is denmark at the moment . 
  i 'm surprised to see that italy and spain have positive current account balances . 
  italy is the 3rd exporter of the union , and spain the 6th . 
  well , `` tourists , overpriced pizza and archaeological remnants '' is a possible summary of my beloved italy . 
  :d another one could be `` hot brunette girls , delicious food and amazing architecture '' . 
  no offence , but that small town does n't seem very representative from the rest of italy . 
  i mean , no water after 9pm ? 
  wow . 
  argentina and chile ? 
  they are poorer than 26 of the 28 eu countries , gdp per capita-wise . 
  your explanation is very reasonable . 
  there is a perception in spain that the people level tend to be highly-educated . 
  moreover , the foreign-born population in spain tend to have a lower level of education than the locals and even than the foreign-born population of other western european countries . 
  [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:share_of_population_ ( aged_30 % e2 % 80 % 9334 \\ ) _ with_tertiary_educational_attainment , _ by_country_of_birth , _ 2015 . png ) so a job that is ok for a non-educated moroccan may not be so ok for an educated spaniard . 
  yeah , but the drop of gdp and the increase of gdp did n't happen simultaneously . 
  i would be pretty happy to find 20 euros this morning , even if i lost 100 in 2011 . 
   it 's like being happy you found a 2 $ coin after losing a 10 $ note . 
  i genuinely do n't find anything wrong about this . 
  when the crisis started , what you say is what happened : migrants - mainly from south america - went back home .
