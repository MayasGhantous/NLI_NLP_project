  the main group was latin americans , in particular from ecuador . 
  however , last year this changed : there were more foreigners migrating to spain than leaving spain . 
  paradoxically , last year was also a record for spaniards ( like `` born in spain '' ) leaving the country . 
  one point more : south americans are not the main group of foreign-born residents in spain . 
  even adding the 5 countries with the biggest representation in spain , they are still less than morocco and romania . 
   that being said it 's not like people are rushing towards spain nowadays anyway you would be surprised . 
  it 's true that right now spain has net emigration ( more people leaving that coming ) but if you count only foreign-born , we have net immigration : more foreigners are coming to spain than leaving it . 
  and this with a percentage of foreign-born population higher than germany 's . 
  i sincerely ca n't find any explanation for this . 
  [ it 's the boob sharia . 
  ] ( http://9gag.com/gag/abyleoo/just-regular-news-on-albanian-television-zjarr-oh-wait ), 
  in denmark is 9 ; and in spain , 10 . 
  according the eu , [ in 2014 spain got +1 b ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/interactive/index_en.cfm ) . 
  according this site is more like -2 b. 
  3b of difference ( not 30 ) may seem a lot , but as a % gni of spain is pretty small ; from receiving 0.1 % to giving 0.2 % . 
  oh , you are right , the rotterdam effect is not applied to that statistic . 
  the different in the operating budgetary balance is caused by :  in its eu budget 2006 financial report the european commission calculates `` net operating budgetary balances '' in a little bit different way . 
  therefore the numbers presented on this site slightly differ from numbers presented by the eu . 
  the main difference is that the eu artificially decreases the numbers that represent contributions by member states by a portion that is supposed to cover administrative expenses of the eu and its other outlays that could not be attributed to a particular member state ( e.g. 
  money that have been sent outside the eu ) . 
  therefore the eu presentation of the net budgetary balances looks as if member countries contributed less than they in reality did . 
  unlike the eu we do not adjust the contributions sent by member states to the eu in order to look it better . 
   also , unlike the european commission , we take into account redistribution of the so called monetary income between the central banks of the euro-zone . 
  also we include among the transfers to the eu 's parafiscal institution - to the european investment bank , to the european central bank and to the eu 's research fund for coal and steel . 
  as soon as dividends from these institutions are paid to the member states according to their capital shares , these amounts will be included among receipts from the eu institutions .

  de moment . 
  this time . 
  the sanction may be overruled , and the quantity is to be defined , but the sanction procedure has been stated . 
  the ... humiliation is already there . 
  this time . 
  france 's deficit is over 3 % too . 
  3.6 % , exactly . 
  the official explanation for this : `` it 's france '' . 
   the commission has faced criticism for giving some countries special treatment when it comes to disciplinary action . 
  when explaining why france escaped sanctions after breaching budget rules , commission president jean-claude juncker said in may : `` it 's france . '' [ source ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/french-finance-minister-calls-for-portugal-to-be-spared-eu-sanctions/ ), 
  yes , that reform existed : right now , countries only avoid sanction if they get voted out of it . 
  and guess what happened ? 
   the commission has faced criticism for giving some countries special treatment when it comes to disciplinary action . 
  when explaining why france escaped sanctions after breaching budget rules , commission president jean-claude juncker said in may : `` it 's france . '' `` rules '' . 
   spain and portugal are far on the receiving end [ eh ? ] ( http://www.money-go-round.eu/country.aspx?id=es ) . 
  according some sources , spain is already a contributor . 
  according all sources , it was projected to become a contributor during the next few years , and that was before brexit . 
  in the same way , you can also argue that germany is a huge net receiver of the eurozone ( via the rule-breaking trade surplus it runs ) . 
  you can read more about it [ here ] ( http://fortune.com/2011/11/14/why-germany-needs-the-euro/ ) . 
  `` net receiver of the eurozone '' ? 
  data for that ? 
  i searched `` net receiver eurozone '' in google , and it only returns data about eu budget ( the non-important , peanuts one ) . 
  you know that france has n't met the deficit target for exactly the same years , do n't you ? 
  and that france has broken it more times that spain , who has broken it similar times than germany ? 
  deficit  3 % ( since 1995 ) : - france : 16 times . 
  - spain : 11 times . 
  - germany : 9 times . 
  moreover , there is another rule in the stability pact : countries ca n't have a debt higher than 60 % of its gdp . 
  let 's see how that is going : gdp-to-debt-ratio  60 % ( since 1995 ) : - france : always . 
  lol . 
  - germany : 15 times ( 1998 and each year since 2002 ) . 
  - spain : 14 times ( 1995-2001 , each year since 2009 ) . 
   the eu was very generously not opening a case against them thanks !!!, 
  the hypocrisy is pretty brutal . 
  i mean : spain and portugal are getting this sanction for having a deficit over 3 % . 
  france last year got a deficit of 3.6 % . 
  in brussels apparently 3.6 is less than 3 . 
  i 'm dazzled about this . 
  spain seems to not have any kind of political power in the union . 
  this is ridiculous . 
  yes , i know what you are thinking : `` spain gets a lot of money from the ue '' . 
  the problem is that ... it does n't anymore . 
  according the official numbers of the eu , spain is still a net receiver : however , it 's the second smallest receiver in % gni ( the smallest being ireland ) . 
  however , other sources put already [ spain as a contributor ] ( http://www.money-go-round.eu/yearchart.ashx?year=2014&amp;method=abs ) , slightly bigger than finland in absolute numbers , actually . 
  in any case , once uk leaves the union , spain will become a net contributor , as the richest ( gdp per capita-wise ) of the net receivers . 
  so the future of spain is : - pay for the party ( being a net contributor ) . 
  - wash the dishes ( taking sanctions that other infringing countries avoid ) . 
  - [ have no say in how the party goes ] ( http://www.politico.eu/interactive/power-matrix-charting-the-eu-players-by-country-european-council-national-capitals-leaders-ambassadors/ ) . 
  brilliant . 
  it 's not a bad thing by itself . 
  it 's a bad thing only if you do n't have the political leverage to use this in your favour . 
  germany has broken the rules many , many times . 
  [ it 's still breaking them , mainly with its huge trade surplus ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/11207721/why-do-france-and-germany-keep-breaking-eu-rules.html ) . 
  if spain has to become a contributor , while being sanctioned , while having almost zero political influence on the union , it may be time to think about the union . 
  the thing is that spain 's economy is already over the eu-28 median . 
  spain 's gdp per capita is the 13th in the union , 12th when uk leaves . 
  italy , which is just one position over us , has been a contributor for 30 years . 
  money from the eu ? 
  with uk leaving , spain will become a net contributor . 
  in fact , spain was already going to become a net contributor before 2020 even without uk leaving . 
  i live in denmark , and i 'm very surprised by these results . 
  in the last 15 years , immigration has become the main issue in denmark , with an anti-immigration party becoming the 2nd biggest of the country . 
  maybe ( just maybe ) the social cohesion detected by this study only refers to the ethnical danes , which became more united against the appearance of the `` other '' : immigrants and non-ethnical danes . 
  which countries ? 
  i believe there is `` real '' love for the eu in spain . 
  france . 
  they are similar to us , but with more of the good things and less of the bad ones . 
  do you want to be belgian ? 
  does it ? 
  i have met a few `` russian/latvians '' . 
  the situation , from my pov , is pretty weird . 
  i know a few `` russian-latvians '' . 
  in erasmus , i was a very good friend of a group of three latvian girls . 
  one of them always posts in russian in her facebook ( usually reposting memes in russian ) .
