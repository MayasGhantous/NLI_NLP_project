  some years ago i visited riga a days before a referendum about the russian language status in latvia : the `` russian '' one was very adamant of her voting for giving official status to russian ; the other two girls kept a weird silence . 
  the last time i met them i asked if their friendship is affected by this issue ; the answer was `` we simply avoid talking about it '' . 
  in another occasion , i went with my gf to a party in denmark . 
  one of our friends told us we should talk with one guy , as he was latvian ( my gf is from lithuania ) . 
  when we told to the guy `` nice to meet , they told us you are latvian !, 
  '' ; they guy shouted `` i 'm not latvian , there is not a drop of latvian blood in my veins '' while pointing to his arm 's veins . 
  after talking with him , it turned out that he was `` latvian '' , like born and raised in latvia . 
  still , he considered himself russian . 
  i mean , i do n't know much , but from outside it looks like a bit messy . 
  germany has a 12.6 % of foreign-born population . 
  at least , according to [ eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/e/ee/foreign-born_population_by_country_of_birth%2c_1_january_2015_%28%c2%b9%29_yb16.png ) if we talk about foreign citizens , you are right : germany has a 9.3 % . 
  spain has a 9.6 % , so my point stands . 
  [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/c/c3/non-national_population_by_group_of_citizenship%2c_1_january_2015_%28%c2%b9%29_yb16.png ) . 
  i would agree that the russian-born residents of latvia can be considered as non-latvians . 
  however , my impression is that there is an important number of latvian-born ethnically russian residents . 
  that includes young people , born after independence , that consider themselves 100 % russians . 
  well , the map does not count `` citizens '' , but residents . 
  most of migrants are not citizens of the country where they reside . 
  anyway , i do agree with you : latvia 's ( and estonia 's ) situation with their russian ( ? ), 
  minorities is weird , and definitely not the one of immigrants . 
  however , it 's a very specific issue of those countries , one that is hard to categorize in the usual foreigner/native `` boxes '' . 
  yes , exactly . 
  most of foreigners in that map are latvian [ non-citizens ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-citizens_ ( latvia \\ ) ) . 
   when did these people come and what kinds of jobs ? 
  most of migrants came in between the end of the 90s and the end of the 2000s . 
  in 1998 , the foreign-born population in spain was 3.2 % ; less than czech republic ( 4.3 % ) and a bit more than hungary ( 2.8 % ) . 
  in 2008 , the foreign-born population of spain was 14.1 % of the total . 
  that was more than sweden ( 13.9 % ) , germany ( 12.9 % ) , or usa ( 12.5 % ) . 
  [ source ] ( https://data.oecd.org/chart/4a7u ) about which jobs they have ... that 's a good question . 
  the unemployment rate for foreigners in spain right now is very high , even more than for the `` nationals '' . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.oecd.org/media/settling-in-unemployment-fb-nb.png ), 
  depends with what you compare . 
  uk 's percentage of foreign-born population grew around 0.4 % per year during 4 years . 
  spain , in 2000 had 4.9 % of foreign-born population . 
  in 2008 it was 14.1 % . 
  that 's 1.1 % per year during 8 years . 
  still , the anti-immigration movement in spain is negligible . 
  so yeah , i think `` slightly '' is not the wrong adverb to use . 
  [ source ] ( https://data.oecd.org/chart/4a7q ), 
  yeah , spain has many . 
  in fact , spain has more foreigners than germany ( 12.7 % to 12.6 % ) . 
  i do n't think that there are so many `` sunburned , old brits '' , or at least that they are not so significant in this statistic : many do n't register . 
  in fact , the top 5 origin countries for spanish immigration are morocco ( 700k ) , romania ( 646k ) , ecuador ( 416k ) , colombia ( 347k ) and yes , uk ( 306k ) . 
  however , if you check by age , you see that only 122k of those brits are  = 65 . 
  again , the most probable reason is that there are many euroretirees living in spain but not registered . 
  [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/1/1c/main_countries_of_citizenship_and_birth_of_the_foreign_foreign-born_population%2c_1_january_2015_%28%c2%b9%29_%28in_absolute_numbers_and_as_a_percentage_of_the_total_foreign_foreign-born_population%29_yb16.png ), 
  actually ... 
  i just checked the source data and the results are quite surprising . 
  the brackets are pretty big . 
  it could be that barcelona has 19.9 % of foreign-born population , and teruel has 10 % . 
  [ london and south-east see largest increase in foreign-born residents ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/06/london-south-east-foreign-born-england-residents-oxford-university-migration-observatory ) . 
  the article is from 2015 , comparing data from 2011 to the one in 2014 . 
  so spain and italy hand out more welfare than finland and denmark ? 
  do you have any data supporting that ? 
  the foreign-born population in uk since 2011 has increased , but slightly : from 11.3 % to 13 % . 
  compare this with the [ brexit referendum map ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/560/cpsprodpb/f2a6/production/_90081126_eu_referendum_maps_app_images_624_results_no_title.png ) . 
  the vast majority of regions that voted for `` leave '' have < 5 % of foreign citizens . 
   if the same level of immigration happened to any other european country , they would find their local people express even more racism that britain . 
  belgium , ireland , austria or sweden have higher levels of immigration than britain . 
  spain and germany have very similar ones . 
  i do n't see any of those countries as particularly racist . 
  [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:foreign-born_population_by_country_of_birth,_1_january_2015_\\ ( % c2 % b9 \\ ) _ yb16.png ), 
  the other day i checked the data from ine ( spanish statistics institute ) . 
  there are slightly more than 300k registered brits in spain . 
  of those , 120k are 65 or older . 
  180k are less than 65 years old . 
  if you add in the `` retired '' side the 55 or plus people , then the `` possibly retired '' side goes to 170k , and the `` probably non-retired '' changes to 130k . 
  however , it 's very probable that there is high number of brits retirees in spain who are not registered in the country , and therefore are not being counted . 
  ** percentages for each country : ** - malta 23.53 % - cyprus 22.83 % - portugal 22.3 % - croatia 21.28 % - ireland 19.44 % - lithuania 17.21 % - romania 17.15 % - bulgaria 15.31 % - estonia 15.21 % - latvia 15.16 % - poland 11.42 % - luxembourg 8.77 % - greece 8.76 % - czech republic 8.54 % - uk 7.64 % - austria 6.97 % - hungary 6.1 % - slovakia 5.53 % - finland 5.48 % - netherlands 5.36 % - denmark 5.29 % - germany 4.98 % - italy 4.85 % - slovenia 4.84 % - belgium 4.44 % - france 3.18 % - sweden 3.04 % - spain 2.78 %, 
  i doubt so . 
  there has always been corruption in italy ; but there was growth . 
   you are basically europes version of florida . 
  i used this same resemblance many times when talking with american friends . 
  i agree absolutely with it . 
  not only in the retiree aspect ; there is also the crazy-party/spring-break side : ibiza , magaluf and lloret . 
  i just rechecked the data and realized that france does not offer this kind of data by country of citizenship . 
  that may be underestimating the number of spanish emigrants - as it 's logical to think that there would be a sizable spanish community in france - . 
  i 'm repeating the same exercise with germany instead of france . 
  there are around 1106k germans living in the eu ( not counting france ) , that 's 1.38 % . 
  there are around 500k spaniards living in the eu ( not counting france ) , that 's 1.07 % . 
  moreover , there is a final statement i want to do : i dislike very much counting people with x nationality living in y country as `` foreigners '' . 
  mario g\u00f3mez is not a spanish migrant in germany ; he was born there . 
  ------ i thought it would be a good idea to compare germany and spain with a country that has had mass emigration : poland . 
  yeah , call me crazy : i think that there are a few more polish migrants than spaniards . 
  will such a crazy hypothesis stand the trial of data ? 
  let 's see . 
  there are a total of 2260k poles living in other eu countries ( not counting france ) . 
  that 's 5.87 % of the population . 
  5.87 %  1.07 % ( spain ) . 
  [ screenshot for poland ] ( https://imgur.com/se6jql0 ), 
  i check eurostat almost everyday . 
  that 's why i prefer to use immigration rather than emigration data . 
  quoting eurostat :  emigration is particularly difficult to measure ; it is harder to count people leaving a country than those arriving . 
  an analysis comparing 2014 immigration and emigration data from the eu member states ( mirror statistics ) confirmed that this was true in many countries -- as a result , this article focuses on immigration data . 
  now let 's compare the number of spanish immigrants in the eu with another developer country : let 's take the french . 
  you can do that in [ migr_pop1ctz ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/product?code=migr_pop1ctz&amp;language=en&amp;mode=view ) . 
  to see the data , you will need to change the `` country of citizenship '' part , clicking on the '' + '' and adding france and spain . 
  well , it happens that there are around 757k french citizens living in other eu countries ; that 's 1.15 % of the population . 
  for spain , there are around 500k spanish citizens in the same situation ; that 's 1.07 % . 
  i had to make the sum myself , feel free to recheck it .
