  i 'm sorry , but the data that you offer seems to support my point of view . 
  assuming that the data that el mundo offers is right and the one given here is wrong , the percentage for spain would be 4.92 % instead of 2.78 % . 
  that is still the 7th lowest in the eu ; less than germany , netherlands and denmark . 
  it 's because it only counts the registered ones . 
  i was checking the ine data for 2015 the other day , and the number has been reduced very slightly , it was something like 305k brits in spain . 
  about the british retirees ... 
  i think they can use the spanish health care with their eu card , ca n't they ? 
  oh , you would be surprised . 
  the three biggest immigrant groups in spain are moroccans , romanians and brits . 
  there are not so many latin americans ; there used to be more , but many of them left , much more than people from romania and morocco . 
  romanians in spain : 730.340 moroccans in spain : 714.221 ecuadorians + colombians + bolivians + peruvians + argentinians * in spain : 676.252 [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_spain ) * : i pick these 5 countries from latin america because they are the ones with most immigrants . 
  the best measure for gdp is gdp . 
  the gdp per capita in spain right now is 13th in the union , just after italy . 
  12th is you do n't count the uk anymore . 
  of course , you can perfectly say that 16 countries in the eu are poor . 
  it depends of your definition of poor . 
  i do n't think that poverty ( for the country as a whole ) and unemployment rate are related . 
  unequality and unemployment rate ? 
  poverty rate and unemployment ? 
  yeah , probably . 
  another `` interesting '' data about the spanish situation is the foreign-born population . 
  12.7 % of the population in spain is foreign-born ; to give you an example of how insane is that : germany has less ( 12.6 % ) . 
  there is something that does not make sense here . 
  the other day someone in this sub posted that spain was a poor country , as shown by the massive amount of migrants it produces . 
  i rolled my eyes , but i did n't answer . 
  poor ? 
  i guess that depends how you define poverty , but ... sending many migrants ? 
  giving the circumstances , there should be more . 
  according this data , spain is the country with less population living abroad per capita , literally . 
  ** percentages for each country : ** - malta 23.53 % - cyprus 22.83 % - portugal 22.3 % - croatia 21.28 % - ireland 19.44 % - lithuania 17.21 % - romania 17.15 % - bulgaria 15.31 % - estonia 15.21 % - latvia 15.16 % - poland 11.42 % - luxembourg 8.77 % - greece 8.76 % - czech republic 8.54 % - uk 7.64 % - austria 6.97 % - hungary 6.1 % - slovakia 5.53 % - finland 5.48 % - netherlands 5.36 % - denmark 5.29 % - germany 4.98 % - italy 4.85 % - slovenia 4.84 % - belgium 4.44 % - france 3.18 % - sweden 3.04 % - spain 2.78 %, 
  in what exactly ? 
  for the sake of curiosity . 
   the pound is where it was in february ... eh ? 
  in its lowest pound in february , the pound was at 1.26 euros/1 .39 dollars . 
  right now it 's at 1.19 euros/1 .33 dollars .

  [ source gbp/usd ] ( http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=gbp&amp;to=usd&amp;view=1y ) brexit was really the beginning of the post-truth politics ... 
  lower than in munich . 
  oh no , in sf i win more . 
  however , the price of the apartments are much , much higher . 
  anyway ... 60-70k in bcn ? 
  that 's amazing . 
  60-70k for a data scientist in barcelona ? 
  may i ask where ? 
  i 'm moving to san francisco soon , but for that salary i would have very much stayed in bcn . 
  nah , the teenagers ' dream in spain is working for the government . 
  opening a corner store is too much a hassle . 
  salaries are lower in berlin too . 
   the market itself has not realized that while unemployment in general is high , in it its pretty low . 
  but they still treat workers as expendable exactly . 
  in spain the working culture is very hierarchical : typically , the boss was the only one with `` studies '' . 
  spanish companies in general do n't know how to manage highly skilled professionals that have plenty of job offers . 
   you could n't be further from the truth . 
  there 's a lot of hatred towards poles and eastern europeans poland is not in the eurozone . 
  the same for romania and bulgaria . 
  language is not really an issue for these kind of tech jobs anywhere . 
  the problem is life out of the office . 
  i live in denmark , and even if the country is very english-friendly , i miss being able to go to the theatre , watch a non-american movie in the cinema or watching public tv . 
  i guess that in berlin it would be the same . 
  berlin is going to a rave party , take some mdma and end up fucking a hot , weird , pink-haired girl in the toilet . 
  best thing ever until you are 25 . 
  i think that dublin may win even more than berlin . 
  from my pov , berlin has a more - maybe too - juvenile feeling , and dublin has english as the local language . 
  about the two cities that you comment , i think that amsterdam has a much bigger tech scene than cph . 
  in fact , the scandinavian capital of tech start-ups would be stockholm . 
  and this comes from someone that lives in cph . 
  spain better than france and usa , and pretty close to germany . 
  not bad . 
  i 'm not very surprised about this . 
  the media is exaggerating about venezuela 's situation ( i do dislike maduro , btw ) and most of china is not like shanghai . 
  i mean , venezuela 's gdp per capita ( ppp ) is higher than china 's . 
  there you have my knowledge of geography . 
  i had heard about cluj being sort of a tech hub , but i had no idea that it was in transylvania . 
  oh , i know that tech is growing in romania . 
  what surprised me was the promotion of transylvania in particular . 
  this sounds like a joke , but the situation for the tech start-ups in london does not seem very bright . 
  i can tell some anecdotes . 
  in my linkedin i have a few tech headhunters added . 
  they tend to recruit for london , berlin , dublin and amsterdam ; in this order . 
  since brexit , i would swear that they are publishing less tech offers to london . 
  instead , they are sharing articles like these : [ it 's time for you to make your brexit !, 
  ] ( http://stelfox.ie/time-make-brexit/ ) , [ brexit : berlin eyes britain 's tech talent ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/36642560 ) and [ brexit could be a talent goldmine for ireland 's tech economy ] ( https://www.siliconrepublic.com/careers/brexit-jobseekers-eu-ireland ) . 
  maybe more relevant and more interesting is the other experience . 
  i have a friend in facebook who is the founder of a tech recruiting start-up . 
  they are partially based in london . 
  his comments so far sound pretty dark :  : / a lot of people on [ my start-up ] crossed uk from their desired destinations list . 
  another one :  `` i 'm going to be frank and disregard your london suggestions . 
  brexit happened , i do n't think that it would be wise to start applying for jobs over there until there 's more certainty about what this decision entails . '', 
   reply sent by a candidate to [ my start-up ] . 
  in fact , the treaty of rome ( 1957 ) is pretty brutal about it :  title iii -- the free movement of persons , services and capital  chapter 1 -- workers  article 48  1 . 
  ** the free movement of workers shall be ensured within the community ** not later than at the date of the expiry of the transitional period . 
  ** this shall involve the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality ** between workers of the member states , as regards employment , remuneration and other working conditions . 
  it shall include the right , subject to limitations justified by reasons of public order , public safety and public health :  ( a ) to accept offers of employment actually made ;  ( b ) to ** move about freely for this purpose within the territory of member states ** ;  ( c ) to stay in any member state in order to carry on an employment in conformity with the legislative and administrative provisions governing the employment of the workers of that state ; and  ( d ) to live , on conditions which shall be the subject of implementing regulations to be laid down by the commission , in the territory of a member state after having been employed there . 
  `` the eu used to be only about trade !, 
  this is not for what we applied ! '', 
  bloody liars . 
  freedom of movement existed before 1993 . 
  in fact , it existed before the entry of the uk in the eec in 1973 . 
   the first provisions on the subject , in the 1957 treaty establishing the european economic community ( 1.1.1 , 3.1.3 and 3.1.4 ) , covered the free movement of workers and freedom of establishment , and thus individuals as employees or service providers [ source ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/displayftu.html?ftuid=ftu_2.1.3.html ), 
  no , for many countries trading `` goods , services and capital '' but no `` people '' is akin of selling stuff without getting paid .
