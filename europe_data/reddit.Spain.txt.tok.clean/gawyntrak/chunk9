  they lose in the first three parts of the deal ; they just `` win '' in the latter . 
  the electorate of the uk has been adamant that they want their cookies but not paying for them . 
  i suspect that the electorates of the rest of the eu would be adamant in the fact that the uk needs to pay for the cookies . 
  i mean , just do an experiment . 
  go to the supermarket and say that you are totally ok with the part of trading groceries . 
  however , the one of you giving money is not really enticing for you , so therefore you wo n't do it . 
  most of us do . 
  of the three parties that support independence in catalonia right now , only the smallest one wants to be out of the eu . 
  the number of romanians in spain is similar to the number poles in britain ( 730.000 vs 790.000 ) ... and that 's for a significantly smaller country . 
  except a few comments about the gipsies , i have never listened anything bad about romanians . 
  in fact , the president of catalonia wife is romanian . 
  which is it for each country ? 
  for the sake of curiosity . 
  this more or less already exists . 
  it is possible to expel an eu citizen if he does n't find job some time after his arrival . 
  [ belgium sends ` burden ' eu citizens letters asking them to leave the country ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2014/01/30/belgium-sends-burden-eu-citizens-letters-asking-them-to-leave-the-country/ ), 
  the problem with your argument is that it would imply that uk has much higher levels of immigration that the rest of western europe . 
  however , this is not true . 
  uk is the 10th country with the most foreigners in the eu-28 ; if we check only the old eu-15 ( as eastern european countries tend to have much less immigrants ) , it is the 7th out of 15 . 
  uk has a smaller percentage of foreign-born population than austria , sweden , ireland or belgium . 
  uk percentage is very similar to other big countries like germany , spain or france . 
  ** foreign and foreign-born population in eu-28 ( as of 1 january 2015 ) ** - austria 17.2 % - ireland 16.6 % - sweden 16.4 % - belgium 16.1 % - uk 13 % - spain 12.7 % - germany 12.5 % - france 11.9 % [ source ] ( http://emn.ie/index.jsp?p=128&amp;n=229 ) about the rest of the argument , i agree as long as uk is not part of the single market . 
  being part of the single market in this context would give an unfair advantage to british companies over , say , chinese ones . 
  in the big scheme of things , spain and greece are `` rich countries '' , or at least they figure in the list of `` very high human development '' in the [ hdi index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_human_development_index , they are 26th and 29th ) . 
  imo , they are clearly in a different level than pakistan , which is 147th and in the list of `` low human development '' . 
  the incentive for a spaniard to go to uk is clearly lower than for a pakistani , with all due respect . 
  talking about benefits ... it depends . 
  the only clear benefit that i can think of which uk offers - comparing with other european countries - is english . 
  something important , of course ; but something that may not be more important than the issues that a visa , and the loss of the eu citizen status in britain , may cause . 
  moreover , in some industries english is already the working language for white-collar workers ( tech , for example ) . 
  no , those are not loopholes . 
  the right to `` move and reside freely within the territory of the member states '' is established in the treaty on the functioning of the european union , article 20 . 
  [ source ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex:12012e/txt ) the right of residence is extended to `` the partner with whom the union citizen has a durable relationship , duly attested '' in the directive 2004/38/ec . 
  [ source ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=oj:l:2004:158:0077:0123:en:pdf ) . 
  so obviously they are not loopholes . 
  and by the way ... could you spell schengen right at least once ? 
  the fact that an eu citizen uses the benefits of the eu country where he lives and pay taxes can hardly be called `` subverting the system '' . 
  ** the system is like this by design : **  the treaty on the functioning of the european union entails the right :  - to non-discrimination on the basis of nationality when the treaty applies  - to move and reside freely within the eu [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/justice/citizen/ ) and :  eu citizens retain the status of workers and self-employed persons in the following circumstances :  - if they are unable to work as the result of an illness or accident ;  - or if they are in duly recorded involuntarily unemployment and have registered as job-seekers with the relevant employment o ffice ;  - or if they have embarked on vocational training . 
   [ ... ]  ** your family members have the right to reside with you ** provided that you meet the conditions . 
  [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/justice/citizen/document/files/guide-free-mo-2013_en.pdf ) so no , the finns that live in sweden are not * gastarbeiter * , and they do n't `` abuse '' anything when they use the public health system . 
  the same for the estonians in finland . 
  and this is exactly what makes so less attractive moving to a country that asks you for a visa . 
  it 's certainly not about `` social benefits tourism '' , more like : - do you want to settle down ? 
  buy a house ? 
  have a family ? 
  well , better think about it ; if you get fired , you - and your family - get deported . 
  in many cases ( l1 visa ) , the visa might be linked exclusively to your current employer , so you are not allowed to find another employer . 
  - however , buying a house might not be so important , as some countries wo n't allow you to buy property ( denmark , for example ) . 
  great !, 
  - and about having a family ... well , that might not be an issue , as your so might not be allowed to come , or she might not be allowed to work . 
  according you , the main problems for people moving on visas are `` massive cultural differences '' and `` acclimation in new environment '' . 
  yeah , totally . 
  spain is recovering by any rate .

  the biggest irony of all this comment is that , coincidentally , i am applying for a visa outside of eu . 
  so yes , i know very well about what i am talking . 
  and yes , needing a visa and what it implies - if i get fired , i automatically lose the right to live in the country - is my number one concern . 
  in the us at least , many it local workers are crying all the time about [ h-1bs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/h-1b_visa ) stealing their cookies . 
  in spain , the `` evil cheap it workers '' are the latin americans . 
  it 's not about blocking , it 's about becoming less attractive for highly educated medical professionals . 
  uk is not the only `` rich '' country in europe that wants to get `` highly-educated immigrants from rich countries '' . 
  it may be the only one in which these people will need to apply for a visa , and will have less rights than a local . 
  i do n't know if commonwealth workers `` do fine '' . 
  they do , as long as it is worthy to go to uk . 
  there are only 1100 clinically qualified australians working in the nhs ; compare this with zimbabwe , a much smaller country with 3182 workers . 
  moving abroad is not a simple decision : `` hey , i will get 50 $ more , let 's move to another country ! '' . 
  it 's more like `` double salary and much better conditions than in my home country ? 
  ok , maybe '' . 
  having to get a visa makes uk much less attractive for qualified workforce . 
  i work in it , which is a field where the workforce tends to be very multinational in the us and europe . 
  i guess that there are cheap shops full of exploited foreigners , but in the `` big '' companies which pay very much over average , the only criteria during the hiring process is excellence . 
  if you think that google and facebook want to have more foreign workers to save a few pennies , you should think again . 
  australia 's gdp is roughly equal to the sum of the three biggest economies in se asia ( indonesia , thailand and philippines ) . 
  uk is not even the biggest economy in europe . 
  it 's not really comparable . 
  add there spain and italy . 
  probably belgium and portugal . 
  and that 's already more than half the population and gdp of the union , counting the uk . 
  the rest of the countries could go for a multispeed , `` slower integration '' option . 
  yes . 
  in fact [ i commented this in this thread just a few hours ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4p9k0q/if_germany_had_a_brexitlike_referendum_79_would/d4j8jx2 ) . 
  and ? 
  europe also buys british stuff . 
  yeah , i know that the balance of trade is negative for britain ( meaning that britain imports more than exports from the rest of the eu ) , but the issue here is size : eu is a much bigger percentage of the british exports than the other way around . 
  tell that to the brexiters ... 
  the thing is that `` whiteness '' is not a static thing . 
  irish and italians have been historically considered non-white . 
  imo , the same will happen with most of the mexican immigrants : they will be assimilated into `` whiteness '' in a few generations . 
  your `` people in europe '' should be `` people in denmark and some , but not all , european countries '' . 
  one of the things that stroke me the most when i arrived to denmark was how little european the vast majority of the danes feel . 
  in my experience spaniards , italians or even french and germans feel much more `` european '' . 
  and yes , there is a european-wide identity . 
  it 's in a birthing stage , and probably not in denmark , but it exists . 
  sometimes i think that the best for everyone would be that the eurosceptic countries left the union , or at least go for a multi-speed europe . 
   rev mcmillan first quotes the book of daniel : `` when it reaches its final formation it will be divided into ten regions . 
  '' ; then revelations : `` it will ultimately become the kingdom of the anti-christ and only those who take his mark will be able to buy or sell . '', 
  still more reasonable than farage . 
  i completely agree , but ... is n't your opinion very unpopular in netherlands ? 
  the fiscal union part , i mean . 
  it 's good that you have such a level of consensus in slovakia .
