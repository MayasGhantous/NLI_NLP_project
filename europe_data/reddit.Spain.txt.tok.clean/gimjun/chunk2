  no , the economy is on auto-pilot . 
  the 2016 budget was passed a few weeks before the december/2015 - ie . 
  the only important bit of legislation that directly connects people 's daily life to the government was correctly dealt with before the forecasted double fiasco . 
  the 2017 budget is also going to be passed soon without government , basically re-using last year 's , which is marketed as a `` compromise '' . 
  this is great , but will raise questions because it would likely cause spain to miss the deficit reduction target agreed with the ecb . 
  most government work , in most civilised countries , is independent of politics after the money is allocated - sanitation , transport , education , healthcare , etc. 
  spain is still in recovery mode - a far cry away from the depths of summer 2012 hell , but still with enough momentum . 
  the only impact from politics was pre-election polls suggesting that extreme-left podemos party would have enough power to enable a referendum for catalan secessionist parties . 
  after two elections , that has proved unsubstantial . 
  in fact , there was a bigger impact on our 10yr bond 's price by brexit than anything secession related . 
  the protests and violence have calmed down , there are no parties trying to exit the eu , and basically all parties claim to be pro-refugee . 
  spain is going to do fine however the gridlock is solved , invest your money, 
  just tried to post this link and saw it 's already been posted . 
  my favourite part :  spaniards crap on everything : in the milk , in the sea , on the mother that bore them , on the number 10 ... so true :'d, 
  finland is not in nato ? 
  wtf finland, 
  kumbaya my lord, 
  the sinking oil price and the fact that the majority of scottish trade is with england , make me think it would be rational economics to stay in the uk and use the pound . 
  on the other hand , fuck it all to hell !, 
  no no , [ * this * is the one ] ( https://youtu.be/c7blmpbr__y?t=8 ), 
  so paper and plastic go into the same one , no ? 
  that 's what i was criticising above . 
  in spain you have [ these 3 minimum ] ( http://blogsigre.es/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/contenedores.jpg ) , and most cities have [ these 5 minimum ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8lgb3d9wrsg/ti12trapiqi/aaaaaaaaans/6qses3asemo/s1600/all_containers-525x351.jpg ) , with batteries only every few blocks . 
  [ code for different bins ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gqbj0schyp8/ui4hjtaonci/aaaaaaaaah8/ua1mqkmbivy/s1600/colores-reciclaje.jpg ) in my original comment , that article says that aside from plastic bottles all other plastics are not recycled , instead incinerated because apparently the cost would outweigh the benefit . 
  what some plastic manufacturers were complaining , on the news here anyway , is that for many products they have not yet developed biodegradable alternatives and that this announcement is kind of a shock since the government has n't implemented more palatable reforms such as adding more bins to encourage reuse / recycling more items other than just plastic bottles, 
  [ as i understand ] ( https://www.angloinfo.com/france/how-to/page/france-housing-setting-up-home-recycling ) you put all of those into the yellow bin ( except glass in some cities , and batteries at electronics stores ) - you have separate bins for paper ( eg . 
  blue ) and plastic ? 
  at least in spain we have separate bins for plastic , paper , glass and batteries - meanwhile in france they have the one , sullen yellow bin to sort and mostly burn the plastic without trying to find reuse [ source ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/world/europe/21iht-trashparis.4672578.html?_r=0 ) ( in paris and some major cities they have one more for glass ) inb4 you talk about garbage strikes in andaluc\u00eda , like that [ shit ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/world/europe/amid-ongoing-strikes-garbage-and-resentment-pile-up-in-france.html ) [ does n't ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-11559265 ) [ happen ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/08/stinky-paris-garbage-collectors-strike-over-pay-cost-cuts.html ) [ in ] ( http://www.20minutes.fr/grenoble/1264789-20131217-20131217-grenoble-greve-eboueurs-perturbe-collecte-ordures ) [ france ] ( http://www.francetvinfo.fr/france/provence-alpes-cote-d-azur/bouches-du-rhone/marseille/greve-des-eboueurs-du-prive-a-marseille-3-000-tonnes-de-poubelles-dans-les-rues-d-ici-lundi-predit-fo_1806339.html ), 
  also true , we live in a post-factual world , which will be perplexing to explain if we survive this game of ww3 chicken, 
  imagine for a second free trade without lowering standards . 
  how great would it be to have cheaper ... everything ? 
  no redundant customs charges , less room for tax skirting , new employment , and a scope for allowing europeans to work in usa and vice versa without tedious visas ? 
  it would only have passed if along with not destroying standards each government had calculated that there would be a net positive effect on their own economies . 
  for me , it was already difficult after brexit , but certainly after the german finance minister buried it a few days ago , basically saying `` there 's no point pretending it 's not dead '', 
  yep , if anyone else bothers to read the very first line :  `` il n ' y a plus de soutien politique '' et `` la france demande l'arr\u00eat de ces n\u00e9gociations '' . 
  we did n't have the funds either ... and there were thousands of people living in ragged tents around the olympic mountain and prime-time beach area . 
  but if you do n't even want it , then no point forcing another rio de fiasco, 
  you 'd pass on a lifetime opportunity ... barcelona was nothing before 1992, 
  i do n't * know * , sorry , but the news is that carriers can not charge for roaming anymore . 
  this means either you can use all your data/mins/sms as if at home , or you have a cap while roaming . 
  so i would certainly call them up because that add-on either can not be charged anymore , or terms modified to increase your cap while roaming, 
  i thought free-market was the exact contention that led to this landmark decision ?!, 
  that it is unfair for this service to have natural monopolies arise due to borders ; especially daft since companies like orange , vodafone , telefonica already have subsidiaries throughout the continent !, 
  fuck em , and next we are going to fuck the electricity , gas and water suppliers !, 
  zurich airport ?? 
  like a cartoon , i was so happily taking out my 5eur note and then i see the til go `` hup up up !, 
  '' , then misery music as i take the 20 , and receive a wad of coins , and deceivingly lukewarm cocoa :'(, 
  clean answer , best answer, 
  except this is locals judging local businesses on their ability to speak the other official language . 
  it does n't , like your business , just limit itself at `` we speak this language here '' . 
  it goes so far as to point with a red frowny face that this establishment does not speak catalan ( well ) . 
  it 's discrimination , which you are entitled to , as immoral as it is - except it 's horrible when a government subsidised organisation is doing it . 
  you can debate how direct the involvement , because the generalitat is not the publisher , but the financial link is there . 
  and whether it is xenophobia or cultural protection are just descriptive words on either side of the argument . 
  but let 's focus on how evil i am for making up that this app even exists , and that no tax monies are going towards any partisan , society-dividing endeavour - such imagination i have !, 
  right , except i use an iphone . 
  and that those two idiots use `` nazi '' sparingly obviously must reflect on me , because they 're on my side ? 
  whataboutism at its best , bravo . 
  nevermind the nature of this app , its intended audience and objective , let 's focus on my ulterior motives . 
  you are closer to the putin-trump clan speak than you would care to admit . 
  i 'll part with the language you best understand : sad !, 
   no anir\u00e0s mai petit trol thanks for selective quoting, 
  - you can argue that it is n't the generalitat 's doing , but are related to this app through subsidies to this ngo - post removed for linking to an app store app not an article explaining what is happening , calling xenophobia when that is debateable , and because content is not in english anyway - by the 52 % upvotes from 50 votes , i think i am , legit , not the only one to think this - if r/europe is n't the place to discuss news events in europe , then fuck me sideways, 
  i knew about public financing of the church ( which i am against ) , but i had no idea about the fascist foundation or trains to barely-populated villages ( both which i would also be against ) . 
  see , the problem is your mission in this whole thread is just to characterise me . 
  while my mission was to denounce something i found wrong , describing the app and its purpose without lying . 
  i called it xenophobia is perhaps my crime here , while you say it 's cultural protection . 
  i have nought against the catalan language , but you are entirely contrary to the existence of someone denouncing cultural isolation . 
  my final words to you , sir , are : get bent . 
  you disproved nothing i 've said . 
  i did n't lie . 
  and if `` societat civil catalana '' ( an anti-secessionist group ) made an app purporting something like `` restaurants that reject speaking catalan '' , i would just as motherfucking angry about public monies being spent on that too, 
  you are still thinking that i 'm defending a spanish agenda , when all i 'm doing is pointing out a racist , discrimination enabling app . 
  perhaps you can discuss it is not directly linked to the government , but to counter-denounce is akin to what trump does in america . 
  persist on your alternative facts . 
  there are a total of like 8 unique users commenting , with 3-4 of us cannibalising the discussion . 
  the reason others are n't interested is because : a ) it does n't concern them , and b ) this got deleted pretty early to pick up anywhere anyway . 
  the link goes to a fucking app store , rather than a link to an article explaining the situation . 
  the only fucking idiots here arguing are n't even logically presenting the events ; instead we 're just arguing agendas and other irrelevant , ultra-localised issues that have neither relevance or interest for anyfuckingbody else, 
  app description translated into english :  do you want to improve the situation of the catalan language in businesses and establishments ? 
  are you tired of going to restaurants , bars , museums , banks ... and not being attended in catalan ? 
  download catalapp , and contribute to improving the situation of the catalan language in all kinds of of establishments within catalan-speaking territories . 
  catalapp is the new mobile app created by the `` language platform '' which allows rating and commenting on the use of catalan language when being attended either verbally , in writing or virtually at over 1million businesses and establishments , geo-located by the application . 
  thanks to catalapp , consumers can know which businesses have a more responsible attitude with the use of the catalan language . 
  furthermore , it also serves to create awareness about establishments with worse rating and the need to improve their linguistic policy . 
  for more information , visit https://www.plataforma-llengua.cat/catalapp app description in catalan :  vols millorar la situaci\u00f3 del catal\u00e0 a comer\u00e7os i establiments ? 
  per a m\u00e9s informaci\u00f3 , consulta el web www.plataforma-llengua.cat/catalapp * i started translating this before the post got deleted , hopefully it still shows up now, 
  and now we know why you are vehemently defending what is clearly secessionist agenda propaganda . 
  good on ya , truth be praised, 
  - that organisation receives subsidies from the generalitat . 
  - tripadvisor seeks to review businesses on their service ; this app is only concerned with catalan language proficiency , with negative reviews for business-owners that do n't speak catalan ( well ) . 
  - the codi de consum is not a legal requirement for operating your business : so long as you can speak one language to fulfil the legal requirements there is no obligation to learn the other . 
  - you also missed * consumer i 'm done with this thread , it 's already been deleted , please stop replying, 
  `` generalitat de catalunya indirectly but fully advertently * finances * catalapp ... '' - better ? 
  hmm , i wonder how they financed the app 's development, 
  lol - did you just prove my point ? 
  that pdf is a scan copy of the agreement between the generalitat and this `` ngo '' , providing funds though to 2018 . i think we 've now entered a [ bugs bunny cartoon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsbon3dtwiy ) gg , bb, 
  i think i understand - it 's a link to an app store . 
  there 's really no context for an english-speaker except for the title itself , and that is n't valid content . 
  the trouble is there are a whopping five news articles on the matter , all in spanish/catalan .
