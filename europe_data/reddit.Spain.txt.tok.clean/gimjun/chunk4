  as long as they enter legally , can be good citizens , respect and abide the laws and raise their children correctly , they should be given a chance to earn and pay taxes , just like the fucking rest of us . 
  and if they 're not , they receive the should receive the same hatred and punishment we reserve for anyone who commits heinous crimes , because that is fucking justice . 
  to ban their entry based on race and religion is exactly the fucking opposite of justice, 
  you and all the theorists-based-on-nothing-more-than-a-handful-of-cases-i-see-on-tv are the enemies of statistics and reason . 
  the amount of islamists committing crimes is no larger than any other religious group . 
  that the terrorist groups motivated in spreading fear across europe are islamic does not automatically mean that all islamists are fucking terrorists . 
  there are 4 motherfucking million turkish-origin muslims who are also 100 % german - are you going to tell me that ** mesut ozil ** can not integrate as a fucking european ???? 
  ? \u00bf go fuck yourself and your fucking ignorant ass , i am not responding to any more of you fucking racist cunts who completely ignore all other crimes happening every day here : women beaten to death , child poverty , prostitute traficking , drug-addicts in public parks , etc. 
  in every motherfucking study on immigrants you will see a lower rate of criminality , and a higher propensity for self-employment and job creation . 
  but , your ignorant motherfucking no-economics-degree ass will have none of these - too fucking factual . 
  go fuck yourselves, 
  i 'm sorry , you 're saying that the sons and grandchildren of immigrants continue to be immigrants ? 
  what morons raised your ignorant ass ? 
  i thought i was replying to a populist , but now i realise he 's a white supremacist . 
  jesus , these people are allowed on reddit too ? 
  i thought there was rediquette for a reason, 
  yes , because being on the opposite side of labour unions , in ** europe ** , is being mainstream . 
  you * are * a twat , and you have no fucking clue about current affairs in europe , and i 'll go as far as to say your relatives have n't a clue what historic freedoms the union has brought to this continent . 
  case in point this remains relevant today , the only place seeking to keep your internet private are bureaucrats in brussels - you 're fucking welcome !, 
  nah , you do n't get it . 
  literally all british islamic terrorists have been british-born . 
  same goes for the french attacks ( except three guys who were belgian ) . 
  many of these were not religious while growing up . 
  their parents had little to nothing to do with their radicalisation . 
  negating the entry of muslim immigrants because of actions caused by homegrown terrorists is daft . 
  if that were logical , we should ban the entry of all norwegians , least we have another anders breivik waiting to happen, 
  yes , europeans that are muslims . 
  how are you not getting this ? 
  no it does n't you twat . 
  my country for instance was much less free before joining the eu . 
  right now for example , there is a collective of shipyard monopolists boycotting the ports in order to block a mandate from the eu liberating the market ( for benefit of industry and inherently the consumer ) . 
  keep believing your populist bullshit , we wo n't be missing eu, 
  the rest of us will stick together , eu 'll see . 
  ( and btw , look further east to see actual oligarchs , which britain will pander to to stay afloat post-brexit ), 
  most of the islamic terrorists perpetrating the attacks in europe are also europeans , they are not imports . 
  another thing common between these fucks is that they are mostly ex-criminals , previously incarcerated for charges such as theft , violence and drug-trafficking . 
  even more common is that these bastards did n't grow up with the religion , but were indoctrinated while in prison , by radical imams . 
  maybe start by stopping brainwashing beardies from visiting prisons filled with young men looking desperately for solace . 
  and secondly : ban western union . 
  for fuck 's sake , only terrorists use that shit . 
  to declare that all muslims are a threat is delusional ; germany 's 4 million turk-origin muslim citizens are being lazy for decades or what ? 
  this is uncomfortably close to where the terrorist attack just happened , no ? 
  spain has never defaulted on its debts , and at least half of us are against the barbaric `` traditions '' of bull-fighting - still , we are viewed as merry and womanising , thanks to our tourists . 
  this post is about as ignorant, 
  this is hilarious, 
  and you are going to live there without high speed internet ? 
  without reddit : s, 
  hospitalet de llobregat in the 80s , now the most densely populated spanish city , developed exactly because of this . 
  democracy , rising standards , trying to clear large ghettos before the olympics . . leading to those ugly ass apartment buildings stacked literally one next to the other, 
  yea , this is a load of bullshit . 
  barcelona can and should stretch southwards and northwards , but it wo n't because politics . 
  the rail and tram links are so obsolete , they ca n't handle the average throughput on a regular weekday , and breakdowns are often on the news . 
  whereas it takes you 15mins to the airport from the centre ( 20km away ) , it will take you on average 1hour from towns just 5km away to the airport , if you take public transport . 
  there are many seaside towns with space and characteristics ideal for development , but disabled only because of the catalan * govern * 's ineptitude and the barcelona * ajuntament * 's narrow view of affairs . 
  [ this is a city that has seen rent grow 20 % in the last year because our communist mayor thinks banning new hotel projects is going to do the exact opposite ( i mean supply-demand , for fuck 's sake colau ) ] . 
  if there were plans to connect metro lines further out of the city , or at least better connected bus-links ( much of the suburbs are blocked out entirely after 9:30 pm ) , then there would be natural development from private realtors . 
  but because catalan political culture is to have their finger in each pie , unless there 's a giant project requiring all these fucking corrupt bastards to sign off on your project , there wo n't be any will to facilitate mobility of people in suburbs to access the city and airport more efficiently . 
  the obsession of being in the centre is common to many cities in the world . 
  but the negation of a growing suburb is a particularly spanish/catalan affair . 
  as with everything in this country 's history , it will be up to immigrants to change and provide opportunities where the locals ' imagination and risk-aversion can not reach, 
  this is so adorable omg, 
  spain is deeply catholic , elections always on a sunday , 8am-8pm . 
  you 're already registered to vote , you only have to make arrangements if you 're going to be away from home ( which is terribly bureaucratic , especially for postal vote ) edit : counting is localised though , and we usually get the result before midnight , officially from the vice-president ; something that not many countries can say they do well, 
  why is erdogan dead set on making new enemies out of european countries ? 
  r/anormaldayinrussia is leaking, 
  this is so beautiful :'d bravo !!, 
  edit : thought i 'd make my comment useful . 
  these are the google translates : - pic 2 : verfassung : : constitution - 7 : hass auf muslime : : hatred for muslims - 7 : afd ( alternative f\u00fcr deutschland ) : : is the extreme right-wing of germany - 7 : unsere n\u00fctzlichen idioten !, 
  : : our useful idiots !, 
  : : when too much rage in the belly ... democracy is in the ass !, 
  fake news !, 
  - 12 : umfragewerte : : survey results ( inflating socialist candidate martin schulz ) i really love these types of floats !, 
  we have a similar tradition called `` fallas '' in valencia, 
  britain is really just england . 
  other than the odd welshman , i have yet to meet a scot or a northern-irish that call themselves a brit, 
  right but , the irish were ready to kill politicians with car bombs and take up armed conflict in their own streets - if both money and blood is of no matter to you , then yea you 're on the way to secession, 
  spain can shuffle [ 9,000 people ] ( http://www.elplural.com/2016/06/24/consternaci-n-en-gibraltar-y-entre-los-9000-espa-oles-que-trabajan-en-la-colonia-por-el ) into different fields of work - that 's a paltry amount in comparison to major manufacturing and mine shutdowns . 
  if there is no form of `` work permit '' and gibraltarians refuse to pay more for now `` imported '' staff , services and goods ; the economies of both gibraltar and l\u00ednea de concepci\u00f3n will depress , and people will start moving elsewhere, 
  it is not going to happen , and nobody in spain other than the sacked foreign minister wants gibraltar co-sovereignty . 
  gibraltar 's economy is almost entirely based on its status as a tax haven - joining spain/eu/euro would do even more harm , than having to pay more for `` importing goods '' without a free-trade agreement . 
  gibraltarians will hurt , but not nearly enough if they left the uk and pound sterling, 
  scotland 's biggest trading partner is england . 
  as much harm as it is to excise from the eu , and the values we shared , it 's even more harmful to detach from the uk and pound sterling . 
  and now thinking about this , sturgeon probably wo n't ever call a referendum ( unless it all goes tits up ) and instead bargain for concessions ( but may is calling her bluff ), 
  catalan , but still the same tourist-dependency . 
  spain here - ready for `` calamitous self-harm '' . 
  hey england ** . . l. **, 
  i mean , guns, 
  those walls are to prevent illegal immigration . 
  you ca n't just bust the fuck in . 
  there are procedures . 
  perhaps the quota and the chances of acceptance as well as the bureaucracy makes it hard to come in legally , but this is exactly how every other eu country operates . 
  also note that most parties will be pro-refugee but economic-immigrant neutral . 
  there is compassion for those fleeing from war-ravaged countries ; for young males with low-skills from countries at peace , not so much, 
  what does that have to do with anything ? 
  it 's says in the title `` right-wing '' , so it implies authoritarian from that perspective . 
  if it did n't say right-wing anywhere , then perhaps it could mean something like the podemos party , that is derivative of venezuela chavismo style ideology ( populist and authoritarian ) - but that 's not what this dumbass `` study '' suggests, 
  in the last cabinet there was also a justice minister who was set on making abortion illegal . 
  yeah , mass protests later he resigned . 
  in your narrative and tone there is a sense of absoluteness / black & white which does not hold true in real life .
