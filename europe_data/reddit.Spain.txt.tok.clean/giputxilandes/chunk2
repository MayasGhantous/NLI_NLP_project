  a unified spanish is a thing that i find hard to test . 
  welp . 
  i ca n't understand shit 50 % of the time two americans ( from same country/culture ) are talking together . 
  edit : welp , i use too much `` welp '' . 
  welp , that would be interesting . 
  because the spanish that we speak here has a totally different vocabulary from the one on america , for example . 
  and not only that , there are countries were words are used in a different way . 
  ok . should have said `` vacational home '' . 
  i am not talking about a place to emigrate . 
  the question is `` to live in '' not `` to emigrate '' . 
  i am not gon na emigrate to norway and i do n't want to ( even if i will be an architect next year ) . 
  if i had to emigrate , i seriously do n't know where to go else than the uk because i do n't think that going to a place that you do n't know the language is a nice move . 
  i think that the combo of `` norwegian with a summer house in the mediterranean '' is the best one . 
  norway , because for the moment their only problem is that they are not winning enough off the oil they have . 
  house in the south because even if i am a cold person , i like to see the sun from time to time . 
  canada , that european nation . 
  this is a shitty test . 
  but anyway ; economic left/right : -9.13 social libertarian/authoritarian : -6.92, 
  what kind of work opportinities ?? 
  which fields ?? 
  also , racism towards northern europeans , from an european . 
  that is a new one . 
  you are welcome ? 
  ^ ^ plz ^ ^ bring ^ ^ back ^ ^ exports , ^ ^ i ^ ^ haz ^ ^ no ^ ^ job, 
  the spanish senate is a joke where old politicians that lost the mainstream of their parties go to retire . 
  useless , nobody gives a shit for it , and sucks 200 millions anually . 
  ... northern spain ??? 
  yesterday it fucking rained torrents here . 
  maybe the northern part of the castillian plateau is suffering it , but here ( basque country ) it has been a quite humid summer . 
  tomorrow i have to go to a wedding . 
  without my so , that has another wedding in another town . 
  i have not tried what i am gon na wear . 
  i have not shaved/cut my hair . 
  i have to be in a table surrounded by unknowns because my family will sit at the presidential table . 
  i have to go to church . 
  i hate weddings . 
  it must not be entirelly cooked , but there should be no `` fisures '' on the outside and must have structural integrity . 
  also , with onion you fucking monster . 
  if you `` remove the doubt '' is because there is a doubt to be removed . 
  basque gramatical hierarchy is not my strong . 
  but i think that the last `` berri '' refers to the house . 
  the long one means `` the new house that is on the mill , that is above the new red fountain '', 
  ... but we need crazy long surnames !!!, 
  i thought brazil was ahead of portugal regarding simplification of portuguese . 
  to clarify ... 
  i made the `` giputxilandia '' and `` giputxiland\u00e9s '' thing . 
  is not a normal idiom or anything like that . 
  `` giputxi '' is the way basque people refer coloquially to people from `` gipuzkoa '' , one of the 7 basque-speaking regions . 
  so , giputxilandia is the land of the giputxis , and giputxiland\u00e9s is the person from giputxilandia . 
  ironically , in spanish . 
  because fuck logic . 
  mooods , r/sweeden is leaking !!, 
  i think my two languages are boring as fuck compared to those of you guys ... 
  you said `` onions '' , you get to live . 
  serious answer . 
  for you is actually much easier to understand us than for us understand you . 
  i have many portuguese and galician friends/coworkers , and believe me that i do n't understan shit . 
  we have a * rule * to punctuate `` u '' with '' \u00a8 '' when the `` u '' sound exists but there is doubt , because we have * another rule * that states that `` u + e '' and `` u + i '' following `` g '' erases the `` u '' sound . 
  so , what he wrote was , phonetically speaking '' '' '' '' '' '' '' pingino '' '' '' '' '' '' instead of `` pinguino '' . 
  was just trolling you , because 99 % of the time we dont use neither '' \u00a1 '' nor '' \u00bf '', 
  :p edit : look , the other comment answering you made the typo with the '' \u00fc '' , and he is spaniard lol . 
  you actually chose one of the `` hardest '' words for a foreigner to write lol . 
  there is a rule barely used to punctuate `` u '' with '' \u00a8 '' , that is only needed when `` u '' is followed by `` i '' or `` e '' and has the `` u '' sound . 
  there are not many words that need it , and the majority of spanish speakers would write it wrong if they are not paying attention . 
  that is also plausible , and kinda similar . 
  nope . 
  onion or nothing . 
  but tortilla as a dish is like saying that rice is a chinese dish . 
  just does n't fulfill the ` national dish ' category but the ` national i am hungry give me something ' one . 
  there is not `` a '' dish in spain . 
  every region has its own ones . 
  fuck it , every city-town has its own one . 
  and the majority of them are kinda `` hidden '' from the rest of us . 
  i have not tasted all the secrets of this country in 25 years . 
  not even close . 
  by the way . 
  i heard a very simple explanation to the origin of the spanish flag . 
  when we were warring with the english , our ships had the monarchy flag . 
  [ something like this , with a smaller shield ] ( http://www.comprarbanderas.es/images/banderas/400/4046-cruz-de-borgona-y-escudo-reyes-catolicos_400px.jpg ) as you would see , it is quite similar to our enemy ones , the english . 
  so , to make this clearer , they thought that the flag with better visibility on the sea would be a red + yellow flag , with the cote d'arms on top of it . 
  exactly . 
  madrid and barcelona have the most `` anti-social '' average people walking down the streets because they are biggest cities . 
  you ca n't say anyone of them has friendly people , because both have them of course , but a tourist most probably will find only the dry , harsh , fed up people from a big city . 
  sorry , but which one is the one with `` friendly people '' ? 
  because my experience says `` not one nor the other '' . 
  my city is one of the most expensive ones of the country . 
  said that , a flat with 1-2 bedrooms , with one kitchen , one living and one bathroom , with no elevator , +50 years old building , renewed recently ( 10-15 years ) near the centre http://www.idealista.com/inmueble/26369933/ or a 3 bedroom , one kitchen , two bathrooms , some terrace/balcony , garage , elevator , 10-20 years old building in the outskirts of the city . 
  http://www.idealista.com/inmueble/27888321/ have in mind , that the 300k $ range is actually 240k $ because of taxes . 
  maybe not limited , but prety much every single one of them is soft . 
  you ca n't compare rude basque and rude spanish . 
  and that is why we have the urge to change language . 
  there is like a big graph answering your question inside the article . 
  the kind of business that wants to keep the workers is the one that generates true wealth . 
  and that is why the tendency to temporary jobs marks that the `` spanish miracle '' is just not true . 
  all this will blow up , the question is when . 
  that is not 100 % true . 
  your `` will '' must not be discriminating . 
  for example , what you said about firing pregnant women , if you sue and you have proof that you were fired because you were pregnant , they will have to pay the trial , pay you for the entire time you were n't working , and re-hire you . 
  it actually forces bussines to sign long term contracts or go again workers seeking . 
  you do n't want to lose a good worker and have to reshufle the entire workforce of your company every 2 years just because you love being able to fire people cheap .
