  here , when my friends have came out , it has been something that : a ) i did n't give a fuck about . 
  b ) was something to celebrate via party . 
  deppending if i liked you ( b ) or not ( a ) . 
  i am sorry you have to hide for your safety . 
  no i am not saying that . 
  i am baking his statement with some examples . 
  but , in my country , conservatives do n't like black/immigrants , despise gay people , like to attack the poor , and mainly live in small towns . 
  it is easier to `` hate '' black people when there are no blacks in your small town . 
  easier to `` hate '' gays , when there are not known ( all wardrobed ) . 
  to `` hate '' poor welfare dependants , people lacking basic services , etc. 
  you just watch the tv , see them , and say `` i do n't like them '' . 
  easy . 
  lately it has been the only thing to be proud of as a spaniard . 
  i am ok with all that . 
  as a basque , i have something to say . 
  ** commmmrads , its time to invade , lets protect basque minorities in iceland ** or not . 
  it is freaking cold there . 
  even for us . 
  and kick-starting all those things would have been much cheaper without the expo . 
  did n't know anything about a expo in milan . 
  people should stop doing these expos , world fairs , olympics ... 
  they are just a massive waste of money that sucks debt into the people without need . 
  does anyone even remember the last 2 expos held in spain ? 
  sorry , but `` you '' ( italian banks , i mean . 
  i am quite sure you are not a bank ceo ) wo n't get it back . 
  and the sooner you realize it the better you will be prepared to react to it . 
  '' ... the american ** think tank ** ... '', 
  gibraltar is no spanish ally . 
  it is just another tax haven . 
  nordic humour . 
  speachless . 
  none . 
  seriously . 
  i do n't want more nationalist/independist bullshit in our daily politics . 
  we have 3.5 nationalist/independist movements ( the 0.5 corresponds to the not really massive andalusian movement ) and it is enough . 
  we are , still , a minority . 
  but one that is growing with the recent corruption scandals involving the monarchy . 
  `` who ? '', 
  you know greece is in the eu , right ? 
  it is . 
  perks of having a cook in the family !, 
  todays menu i just ate . 
  ( sorry no pictures ) - boiled peas - lamb brain ( yes , no kidding . 
  the brain of a lamb , coated in batter and fried ) . 
  - grilled squid . 
  all with water and soy bread . 
  kiwi for dessert , and a coffee to avoid sleeping for the entire afternoon ( no siesta today , we have to prep up the family restaurant as tomorrow is first day of work after holydays . ), 
  [ this sums up our history quite well ] ( http://www.adevaherranz.es/arte/webimages/espana/contemporanea/xviii-xix%20pintura%20goya/art%20pin%20xix%20goya%20francisco%20de%20duelo%20garrotazos%20m%20prado%201820%20a%2023.gif ), 
  according to another reply on the post , doctors and lawyers are actually excluded from this payment . 
  jobs are , as far as i know , guaranteed in belarus . 
  as in you go to the goverment office , ask for a job , and they give you one . 
  isn ` t job ** guaranteed ** in belarus ? 
  1 karl marx 2 kant 3 descartes 4 zizek ( or whatever the way of writting his name is ) 5 plato, 
  no it did n't . 
  i already told you that the union act was in 1469 . 
  [ before daring to teach history , you should at least know it beforehand . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catholic_monarchs ) otherwise , someone could think that you were an idiot . 
  no , ** you ** must learn iberian history . 
  because the union was done in 1479 , when both isabel and fernando were declared kings of castilla and aragon . 
  `` tanto monta monta tanto '' . 
  because the anexion of navarre was not done until 1512 . 
  because the granada kingdom was not completely invaded and aniquilated until 1492 . 
  so , * you * are wrong . 
  you are wrong . 
  prior to the existance of the `` union '' existed both castilla and aragon , yes . 
  and granada . 
  and navarra . 
  so no , castilla did n't include all the lands that now are spain but aragon . 
  look at what you are writing . 
  `` over half '' is not aceptable , no , sorry , for us it is he fucking wild west where you can be left unnatended on money grounds . 
  last year we started not offering care for illegal inmigrants and was a major scandal , we had demonstrations and actions against it . 
  ** that ** is what we are defending . 
  not 70 % with good healthcare and 30 % with none . 
  and i pay 3000 $ that include my retirement quota , and just because i am a self-employed guy and that is the minimum . 
  \u00bf and you know what ? 
  if i stop paying , they do n't stop taking care of me . 
  so yes , you pay a fuckton from our point of view . 
  and some were on the iu list and have endorsed iu . 
  and iu won at marinaleda . 
  yep . 
  the `` actual '' sport is based on chopping wood . 
  it was born as a betting contest between `` jauntxos '' ( local nobelty ) and landowners that wanted to settle something in a nonviolent way . 
  or just because . 
  seriously , nobody answered `` civ v '' ? 
  this is wrong . 
  spain is lossing population , not growing . 
  thousands of `` natives '' have gone abroad , and hundreds of thousands of latinamericans have returned . 
  d\u00fcsshyp http://www.jungewelt.de/2015/03-17/008.php edit : it was actually linked to an austrian corporation , not swiss . 
  small and elitist . 
  they targeted big fish and are involved in money laundering . 
  welp , a german bank , part of a swiss corporation did go bankrupt today , so ... 
  was n't the litas fixed to the euro ? 
  anyway , internal consume should not be afected as much as 25 % because of a 10 % fall of the euro . 
  not sure about the final ammount , because only 100k $ are `` safe '' in deposits and accounts , but they are talking about + - 3.000 million euros lost , of which 690 are still in the bank and more or less 1.500 millions that will be payed back using the emergency fonds . 
  barman salary went from 100k pesetas/month to 700 $ / month . 
  ( 116k pesetas ) minimun salary is 654 $ . 
  how much have prices changed ? 
  in two years we got a 66 % increase in nearly everything `` basic nutrition '' ( bread , coffe , sugar , rice , beer , wine , vegetables , meat ... ) and major increases in other areas like electronics , automotive , power/heating ... just because 1 $ = 166 pesetas , so prices that were 100 pesetas tended to 1 $ instead of staying at 0.60 $ . 
  edit : for example . 
  a coffe was 100 pesetas in 1999 .
