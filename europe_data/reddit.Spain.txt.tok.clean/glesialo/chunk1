spain . 
  it is silly , you are not responsible for your country 's history . 
  find better friends !, 
  i have visited portugal a few times : very friendly people , i feel at home there . 
  portuguese do not strike me as specially racist . 
  what did you do to be called a racist ? 
  catalonian separatists want to stage an illegal poll next november . 
  when the russians come ? 
  [ bugger ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bugger ) it is derived from anglo-norman bougre , which has also given the term buggery . 
  bugger -- also bowgard , bouguer ( ancient french -- bougre ) : from latin -- bulgarus , a name given to a sect of heretics who were thought to have come from bulgaria in the 11th century , afterwards to other `` heretics '' to whom abominable practices were imputed in an abusively disparaging manner . 
  has anybody read their political [ program ( spanish pdf ) ] ( http://podemos.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/programa-podemos.pdf ) ? 
  there are some good things but a lot of impractical nonsense . 
  ( extreme_left | | extreme_right ) ! = rational_thought, 
  being more ` german ' ? 
  i really belong in the czech republic you 're czech at heart . 
  residents of the czech republic are typical europeans ; they do n't want to stand out in any way . 
  the average czech drinks very little coffee and does not use tablets to surf the internet . 
  participation in religious events is something they would find unusual . 
  my closest soulmates are in latvia , croatia i 'm farthest from luxembourg , sweden, 
  the ` european robin ' is , obviously , far superior to the ` american robin ' ( turdus migratorius ) !,

  i have sent this email to [ francisco sosa wagner ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/97170/francisco_sosa%20wagner_home.html ) : { subject : votaci\u00f3n de regulaci\u00f3n para proveedores de acceso a internet , ` specialised services ' . 
  hola , quiero comunicarle mi posici\u00f3n sobre la propuesta de regulaci\u00f3n para proveedores de acceso a internet llamada ` specialised services ' : estoy totalmente en contra de modificar la actual regulaci\u00f3n que , a mi entender , garantiza la neutralidad de la red . 
  who the hell is my ` member of the european parliament ' ? 
  i have no idea and i do n't think it would help if i knew : i distrust any and all spanish politicians !, 
  is there any european institution i can contact directly ? 
  i guess ` non-attached ' means they have n't made their minds up yet . 
  there is not much to choose from :-( it is either upyd or nothing . 
  fixed , thank you !, 
  i would like to vote for the ` progressive alliance of socialists and democrats ' but i 'd rather be dead than vote for the equivalent spanish party , psoe !, 
  i distrust and despise all spanish politicians but , if i have to choose a national party , it will be upyd ( uni\u00f3n , progreso & democracia ) which seems to be ` non-attached ' , according to [ my vote 2014 ] ( http://www.myvote2014.eu/en/your-vote/cast-vote ) . 
  not compared with spain and its politicians !, 
  can i change it to ` what country would you like to annex yours ? ' ? 
  germany .

  was he talking in a kindergarten ? 
  i am an estonian ... and proud of it !, 
  thank you , johnson . 
  completely agree !, 
  democratic transmission ( citizens < -  politicians ) is broken !, 
  thank you . 
  i am afraid i fancy none of them , specially if i have to vote for their spanish equivalent . 
  which are the available ` european parties ' ? 
  what happens if i want to vote for an european party that is not represented in my country ? 
  is [ he ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/piet_hein_donner ) a mighty farter ? 
  pity usa 's nsa is on forced holidays , they would crack your code .

  wtf http://translate.google.com ? 
  no , they wo n't write a good one because they do n't want to . 
  there is a conflict of interests : if wolves ( politicians ) are guarding lambs ( citizens ) , will they build an electrified fence ? 
  it is the same , in spain , with research , education ... 
  when good universities need to fill an important position , they send the candidates to a different ( often foreign ) university for evaluation . 
  not so in spain : the jobs are usually for people with ` contacts ' ( university staff , department , etc ) . 
  as i said above , there is no meritocracy in spain . 
  when i vote i have to select from closed lists ( i have to choose between political parties ) and voting numbers are modified so that some votes are worth more than others . 
  the best and fastest way for spain to become a decent country is to copy what works best in neighbour countries . 
   were n't your governments fairly ok until the crises ? 
  no they were n't . 
  perhaps a couple of governments , after our ` transition ' from dictatorship , were n't too bad and really tried to improve the country . 
  felipe gonzalez , aznar , zapatero & rajoy ( leaders of governments from 1982 up to now ) are a sorry lot . 
  our constitution written ( instead of copying a good one ) in our ` transition ' , is a mess . 
  all spanish politicians know it but the do n't change it because they profit from its errors . 
  for democracy ( a bad system but the less bad of them all ) to work there must be a ` transmission ' pulley connecting citizens to politicians , that pulley has never been in place in ` democratic ' spain . 
  i can not use my vote to select good politicians from bad . 
  i have to vote for whole political parties full of people that have never done anything in their lives but curry favour and lick arses . 
  there is no meritocracy in spain !, 
   i think the swedish government i less corrupt and make smarter financial deciscions as well than the eu . 
  that 's the main point . 
  i know that ( any possible ) spanish government will be more corrupt and will make more stupid decisions than the eu . 
  perhaps there should be some minimum eu laws that all member countries must adopt . 
  if you are lucky to live in an enlightened country you would n't have to adopt any eu minimum laws because yours would surpass them . 
  i agree , specially for countries with hopeless politicians , like spain . 
  i wish there were an european constitution , voting system , institutions structure ... that all member countries would have to adopt . 
  yes : - c, 
  intelligent , honest , capable politicians . 
  i wish merkel would run for the eu elections in spain !, 
  there are so many good artists in ireland !, 
  the joke is all about maria 's future .
