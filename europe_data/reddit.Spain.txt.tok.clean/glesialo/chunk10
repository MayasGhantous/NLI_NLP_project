   nice hurry up !, 
  that 's right . 
  alah is footing the bill . 
   italy , germany signal tougher stance on asylum seekers and nobody believes them . 
  deportation, 
  poor angela , what else could she do to get a well deserved rest ? 
  welcome , guantanamo inmates , welcome !, 
   she invited them expecting them to become integrated she ca n't be so stupid ... 
   sentence should be : planting new trees ... sentence should be : planting lots of new trees ... fify, 
  according to this / r/askeurope thread : [ how many of you blame islam completely for the tense climate we are now living in europe ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/4v5zu2/how_many_of_you_blame_islam_completely_for_the/ ) it is all media fear mongering . 
   you have a shitty haircut !, 
  i am sure that really hurts !, 
   europe suffers as a result of being stupid fify, 
  muslims are whipping up fear against muslims . 
   if they tried they did . 
  we should never forget those in gb who voted for bremain !, 
  i do n't want an ` us and them ' in europe !, 
   ` swiss style ' citizens must be educated for that . 
  i shudder to think of ` swiss style ' referenda in spain . 
  with our shitty leaders ? 
  i doubt it . 
  the new normal in europe . 
  we are making sure it will get worse in the future by letting in masses of illegal , muslim immigrants . 
  we deserve what is coming ( first , second , third , xth generation of un-integrated muslims ) unless we change eu immigration policy . 
   hey , what about minding you fucking business and allowing other people to develop their countries and their system of governance without your interference ? 
  all right , as long as they do n't invade us when their societies suck more than ours . 
  you have to travel to feel yourself european . 
  below a certain level of intelligence , people do n't realize they are stupid ... 
  i fear for the milky way :-(, 
   travel in arab countries is unsafe -- do n't visit . . just wait , they 'll be here soon enough . 
   third , europeans can learn from others . 
  when asylum seekers try to reach australia by boat , they are not held there while their claims are processed . 
  instead , they 're sent to an offshore processing center . 
  australia has two , on the island nation of nauru and another on manus island in papua new guinea . 
  unpleasant ? 
  yes , but a deterrent . 
  where is eu democracy ? 
  i want to kick out this stupid ` eu head ' !, 
  welcome , welcome !, 
  basic income , basic income !, 
  all those refugee/immigrant women and children have turned into young men . 
  what a surprise !, 
  countless lives could be saved if the eu made absolutely clear that there will be no boat rescues . 
  spend more money in refugees/immigrants and ... you 'll have more . 
  in spanish there is a saying : `` cr\u00eda cuervos y te sacar\u00e1n los ojos '' - `` if you raise crows , they 'll peck your eyes out '' another version : `` cr\u00eda cuervos y tendr\u00e1s muchos '' - `` if you raise crows , you 'll have many ( crows ) '', 
  from [ venezuela is falling apart ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/economics/comments/4j2e5x/venezuela_is_falling_apart/ ) :  what 's amazed me is how long it 's taken . 
  it 's 2016 and chavez was obviously mismanaging the place by 2004 , or earlier . 
  so it 's taken 12 + years for it to start boiling over . 
  that will be the roadmap for spain if podemos wins . 
  if eu politicians really wanted to solve the issue ( from previous posts ) : the only way to stop the , ever increasing , wave of immigrants/refugees is to move them to external camps with plenty of media coverage . 
  they 'll soon learn that it is not worth the risk , money , etc. . . to come illegally in europe because they 'll always end in an external camp . 
  note : [ australians are doing just that ] ( https://youtu.be/knyx1o6panu ) . 
  __________________________ external camps should be located in non european countries . 
  there would be economic compensation and humanitarian aid . 
  the cost would be a fracion of what we are spending now . 
  supporting immigrants/refugees is much cheaper outside europe . 
  many lives would be saved as the dangerous crossing to europe would be stopped . 
  __________________________ europe ca n't solve all the problems of the world . 
  we should accept only those immigrants/refugees that we can safely integrate in our societies . 
  that means a thorough check of those ( limited numbers ) we let come in ( as canada , australia ... are doing ) . 
  it is an easy choice : we deal rationally with this problem or we commit cultural ( economic , social ... ) suicide . 
  __________________________ we need an ` european deportation service ' . 
  eu countries would send rejected immigrants/refugees to the ` eds ' and forget about them . 
  an ` european deportation service ' would have more clout than any individual country to arrange agreements with non eu countries , etc. 
  the eu needs a reboot . 
  [ do n't worry , be happy !, 
  `` i do n't want to waste my time arguing with jehovah 's witnesses . '', 
  close your eyes and stop your ears . 
  everything is nice and fine in europe . 
  nothing to see , drive on ... as somebody else in the thread said : `` enjoy your terrorists . '', 
   i guess this is where you want to go , right ? 
  you are completely mistaken . 
  it is not a matter of black or white it is a matter of immigrants/asylum-seeker integrating in our societies . 
  germany has not been very succesful integrating turks . 
  same with france , belgium , holland , integrating algerians , moroccans ... 
  bringing in big numbers of immigrants with an alien culture makes their integration impossible . 
  having strong religious feelings also makes integration in a secular europe difficult . 
  if a society does not protect itself it is doomed . 
  i do not keep my home 's door always open . 
  i choose who i let in . 
  other countries ( australia , canada ) have better immigration/asylum policies . 
  if they are not afraid of terrorists they are stupid . 
  do something : sack incompetent politicians !, 
  it is really easy : refuse entrance to anyone without proper papers ( visa , residency , asylum ) . 
  protect country and citizens , save money . 
  they 'd meet the 2 % together and use it to build an eu defence army ( using european technology and materiel ) at the same time . 
  if something went wrong with nato ( trump goes even more berserk ) we would still have our own defence organization . 
  let 's make the eu a nato member : eu countries -  eu defence -  eu 's nato contribution, 
  perhaps i should have written ` some ` roma-nians ' can be a bit trying . ', 
  i do not defend it but i can understand the sign if the owner , or his customers , have been harassed , several times , by roma gypsies . 
  some ` romanians ' can be a bit trying . 
  worked for philips for almost 20 years . 
  visited your country many times . 
  i love your country too !, 
  come over you silly bastard ( / s ) , let 's have some beer !, 
  and do n't forget to bring the world renowned , german humour sense too !, 
  [ looking forward to more like these ] ( http://cyrilyne.c.y.pic.centerblog.net/92af4a47.jpg ) ;-), 
  i also want to know .
