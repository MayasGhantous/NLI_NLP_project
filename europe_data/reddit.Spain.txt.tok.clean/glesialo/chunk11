  all is ready :-), 
  we have plenty of spare land , come over !, 
   do n't like is the bullfighting part neither do i. 
  el duque de alba is dead and forgotten . 
  welcome to spain dutch and german brothers and sisters !, 
  hydrogen infrastructure , cars , trains ... -  boom !, 
  [ he was very cross with them ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_teutoburg_forest ) . 
  ` quintilius varus , give me back my legions ! ', 
  but they should be returned to libya ( or morocco ) or deported immediately . 
  if they realize that they ca n't immigrate into europe illegally the will stop coming . 
  and there is a whole world out there who wants to be let in . 
  if they do , europe will cease to be europe . 
  we should accept only those immigrants/refugees that we can safely integrate in our societies . 
  that means a thorough check of those ( limited numbers ) we let come in ( as canada , australia ... are doing ) . 
  we need an ` european deportation service ' . 
  eu countries would send rejected immigrants/refugees to the ` eds ' and forget about them . 
  an ` european deportation service ' would have more clout than any individual country to arrange agreements with non eu countries , etc. 
  one of my ancestors , enormousdickus , from hispania , fought in gaius marius 's legions against the invading cimbri and teutones . 
  a raving teuton broke poor enormousdickus 's brand-new shield before my brave ancestor skewered the foaming lunatic ... am i entitled to any reparations ? 
  [ what-a-mistaka-to-maka !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/b6lw1fbshxa ), 
  do n't worry be happy !, 
  in spanish we have a saying : `` no hay peor ciego que el que no quiere ver '' ( the worst kind of blind people are those that do n't want to see ) . 
  [ zoom an any of these images ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=migrants+rescued+italy&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjd5e362ursahvllpakhvzmap8q_auiccgb&amp;biw=1470&amp;bih=708 ) . 
  [ these ones too ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=ceuta+fence+storming&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj4sjhr2-rsahuhq5akhdbcceqq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1470&amp;bih=708 ) . 
   they are ferrying refugees not so . 
  most of them are illegal african immigrants . 
   you ca n't literally protect every european border 100 % they are n't even trying . 
  in fact they are ferrying in thousands of illegal immigrants monthly . 
  and i hear , in spanish national radio rne , that hundreds have stormed the fences in ceuta & melilla almost every week . 
  not to speak of the ` spaniards ' ( of moroccan , algerian , tunisian ... origin ) working here for isis and that the spanish police detains every other month . 
  i bet she was thinking `` berlusconi is a gentleman compared to donald '' ;-), 
  and stay there !, 
  that 's exactly what i think . 
  behaviour of european politicians has been so mind-bogglingly stupid ( even for politicians ) that there must be a secret reason . 
  have you read isaac asimov 's books about [ psychohistory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psychohistory_ ( fictional ) ? 
  somebody is prodding the eu ( [ minimum actions at the correct place and time to achieve maximum changes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_end_of_eternity#plot_summary ) ) to make it stronger . 
  divide and conquer . 
  hydrogen cars , hydrogen infrastructure -  boom !, 
  googling more info i found this [ nsfw comic ] ( http://imgur.com/a/sikko ) . 
  crispy , french bun ? 
  edit : ` crispy , french bun with chocolate filling ' or ` cfbcf ' ( pronounced in french ) . 
  yeah , they are very mean ;-), 
  and they say germans have no humour sense ... 
  i agree with you . 
  if politicians want a united eu they need to value european citizens . 
  as long as anyone can waltz through the eu unprotected borders and be considered as good as a real european citizen it is not going to work . 
   they are just poking with a stick to see if they can find any holes find any ( back ) bones, 
   eu countries have 0 willingness to aid greece what about eu citizens ? 
  i do !, 
  eu has nothing to say ? 
  must be difficult to type with bat wings . 
  that 's very bad news . 
  open borders for non-eu , economic migrants ? 
  fuck the left and the right !, 
  we need intelligent and capable politicians . 
   we do it much faster lol ( eu does n't do anything fast - rather : eu does n't do anything ), 
  my very thoughts !, 
  and miss germany looks a bit like [ romy schneider ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/f1/8b/42/f18b42ea670c9074275e0d952d83d37b.jpg ) . 
  stern speeches ? 
  fucking great !, 
  i could n't help shedding a few tears . 
  we need an eu constitution . 
  i think you are right . 
  we need more like him . 
  i would vote for him if i could but i can not . 
  i have to vote for spanish political parties in european elections . 
  it should not !, 
   europe is facing make or break time and where are the european leaders that we need ? 
   ~ ~ holy ~ ~ roman empire christians did to the roman empire what the muslims are going to do to the eu :-(, 
  better late than never . 
  i see you are resigned to let them all in . 
   theresa may says uk will leave the eu single market [ eventually ] ( https://youtu.be/yxbsua5pugg ), 
  the woman speaking for ` the european republic ' in this [ video ] ( http://cor.europa.eu/en/events/europcom/pages/europcom-2016-webstreaming.html ) talks a lot of sense !, 
  how time flies . 
  april fools ' day already . 
  her master 's voice . 
  the image of myself discussing politics in my ` place of worship ' is so silly i was tempted to end the poll then and there . 
  \u00a1 felices fiestas !, 
  does it mean she is stepping down ? 
  there are two well known ways to deal with a banking crisis : [ the swedish way - good ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/23/business/worldbusiness/23krona.html ) [ the japanese way - bad ] ( http://policydialogue.org/publications/backgrounders/casestudies/japans_banking_crisis/en/ ) guess which of the above methods was used in spain and will probably be used in italy ... 
  note : i googled the above links for this post . 
  you can probably do better . 
  our comments have been loped out of the thread because of a comment removal . 
  censorship ? 
  it was all over / r/europe . 
   i do n't think the eu would allow such a man to take command , though , not for a while . 
  more is the pity . 
  a clear headed , well intentioned , competent single man/woman is what we need now in europe ( as long as he/she behaves as cincinnatus and not as [ sulla ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sulla ) ) . 
  democracy is the best of all known forms of government but ... it is shit !, 
  paraphrasing the ` peter principle ' `` politicians rise to the level of their incompetence '' . 
  verhofstadt wanted to expel hungary from the eu because they were raising fences to stop illegal immigration . 
  i am fed up with european politicians . 
  we need a modern [ cincinnatus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lucius_quinctius_cincinnatus ) . 
  i think you are right , it looks like arabic script . 
  paint it blue ? 
  i do remember eta . 
  we jailed them and destroyed their organization . 
  we take for granted what we have , it took centuries of suffering to get where we are but we can lose it in a couple of generations . 
  if western civilization goes there is no hope for other backward countries .
