  eu countries would send rejected immigrants/refugees to the ` eds ' and forget about them .

  there are thousands of illegal immigrants for each refugee that comes into europe nowadays . 
   encourage integration . 
  though it never ever takes place in the first two generations and the third generation are jihadists ... :-(, 
  ( semi ) tamed religions and now it is back to square one , to deal with new ( in europe ) ` dangerous nonsense ' . 
   migrants coming to australia are much fewer .

  she is in a british wheat field ... ;-), 
  all religions are the same . 
  we 'll see more and more reports of forced ( child ) marriages , genital mutilation ( both male and female ) , fanaticism , intolerance , irrationality ... 
  you ca n't see her but she is there , creeping under the waving wheat , moaning with repressed desire , her knickers wet with passion , her flanks caressed by the rough , rigid wheat stalks , breathing in the forbidden aroma of wheat , revelling in her own naughtiness ... 
  we were finally getting rid of religion in europe ( a centuries long , ongoing job ) and now , in the last few years , we let in millions of foreign religious nuts . 
  hopeless !, 
   there are quite a few stereotypes about argentines i found a collection of jokes about argentinians . 
  here is one : un argentinito le dice a su padre : \u00a1 pap\u00e1 , pap\u00e1 ! ... 
  ___________________________________________________________________ an argentinian kid tells his father : dad , dad ! ... 
  when i grow up , i want to be like you !, 
  the proud father answers : is it so ? 
  i am not surprised but ... what do you like about me ? 
  you have me for a son !, 
  ... but they stay anyway . 
   how gay friendly refugees from muslim countries are . 
  and do n't forget that refugees from muslim countries are 99 % women and children ( most of them scientists , doctors and engineers ) . 
   threatening fiscal consequences for eastern european states that are balking at taking in refugees and migrants according to an eu redistribution scheme . 
  forcing redistribution wo n't solve anything but will strain the eu . 
  fix illegal immigration first : close borders , create an eu deportation service ... only then can we start to mop up the immigration/refugee mess , sharing the burden among all eu countries . 
  there is an spanish saying : `` otros vendr\u00e1n que bueno te har\u00e1n '' ( others will come , who will make you look good ) schulz could make merkel look good on the subject of illegal migration . 
  it seems it comes originally from ` johann wolfgang von goethe ' but was taken over by some spanish writers . 
  [ here is some explanation ( spanish ) ] ( https://es.wikiquote.org/wiki/don_quijote_de_la_mancha#ap.c3.b3crifas ) . 
  it is an european problem and needs an european solution . 
  each country on its own is a recipe for failure . 
  the ` european deportation service ' would not be a bureaucratic agency . 
  it would have personnel and means to organize ( and pay ) external refugee/immigrant camps , repatriation convoys , international negotiations with third countries ... 
   if italy closes the borders to illegal migrants the media will condemn and quarter the italian government without mercy . 
  that 's what we need : make absolutely clear ( the more media the better : they bark , then we ride ) that european borders are closed to illegal immigrants . 
  it worked fine for the balkan route .

  here is the [ wikipedia 's entry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cochinchina_campaign ) . 
  wild bores are the worst !, 
  did you warn ` ingenvector ' too ? 
  he/she insulted all europeans ( me included ) . 
   postwar europe saw the largest population resettlements in history migrants then had similar cultural values and as you say it was ` resettlements ' : population numbers did n't change . 
  there is an unlimited amount of people who want to come into europe , if we do n't filter who we let in , europe will cease to be european . 
  i am very glad east ( centre ) europe countries are in the eu : the immigration/refugee situation is hopeless but imagine how worse it would be if they had not opposed some common sense logic to the stupid political ideology in west europe . 
   even today muslim terrorist attacks are far and few inbetween . 
  are you a fish ? 
  but if australia joined us we could solve the migration crisis : no more open borders !,
