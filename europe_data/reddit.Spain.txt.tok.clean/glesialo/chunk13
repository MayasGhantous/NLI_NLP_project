  muslim teen ... 
  if at all, 
  i 'd outsource them from singapore . 
  macron will solve the eu immigration/refugee crisis like alexander cut the gordian knot ... hope springs eternal !, 
  the economical benefits of fracking are temporary but the damage is forever , in human terms . 
  fracking would also delay clean energy efforts . 
  wish spain would join them too !, 
   about 1,000 euros ... plus a further amount for each child ... 
  basic income + open borders = ? 
  i stayed in santorini , for a few weeks , one winter , many years ago and . . 
  i loved it !, 
  people was really nice and i remember that even the dogs were friendly . 
  must visit again !, 
  perhaps they want to sell as many as they can before brexit ? 
  i have to wait 8 weeks for my new vw car . 
  i bet german car manufacturers will survive without british orders . 
  we ca n't change all the countries in the world . 
  secure our borders and deport illegals . 
  the only way to stop the , ever increasing , wave of immigrants/refugees is to move them to external camps with plenty of media coverage . 
  they 'll soon learn that it is not worth the risk , money , etc. . . to come illegally in europe because they 'll always end in an external camp . 
  external camps should be located in non european countries . 
  there would be economic compensation and humanitarian aid . 
  the cost would be a fracion of what we are spending now . 
  supporting immigrants/refugees is much cheaper outside europe . 
  many lives would be saved as the dangerous crossing to europe would be stopped . 
  [ australians are doing just that ] ( https://youtu.be/knyx1o6panu ) . 
  we need an ` european deportation service ' . 
  eu countries would send rejected immigrants/refugees to the ` eds ' and forget about them . 
  an ` european deportation service ' would have more clout than any individual country to arrange agreements with non eu countries , etc. 
  europe ca n't solve all the problems of the world . 
  we should accept only those immigrants/refugees that we can safely integrate in our societies . 
  that means a thorough check of those ( limited numbers ) we let come in ( as canada , australia ... are doing ) . 
  it is an easy choice : we deal rationally with this problem or we commit cultural ( economic , social ... ) suicide . 
  will we have enough ngos to bring them all in here ? 
  i do n't want to be called a nazi !, 
  get on with it !, 
  fucking incompetent/corrupt supervisors ( bos , ecb , cnmv ) and politicians . 
  there are two well known methods to deal with rotten banks , the swedish way ( split rotten banks in two : good and bad ; change board of good bank and pour public money into it ; let share and bond holders bear responsibility for bad bank ... ) and the japanese way ( pour public money indiscriminately and create zombie , living dead , banks ) . 
  which method did they use ? 
  the fucking wrong one !, 
  my comment in [ what 's the biggest waste of public money that your country has experienced ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6gmn1g/whats_the_biggest_waste_of_public_money_that_your/ ) : saving rotten ( boards full of politicians for many years ) savings banks , with lots of public money , knowing beforehand that merging two or more rotten banks does n't solve anything . 
  many of them had , finally , to be sold for $ 1 . 
  edit : [ spanish government debt ] ( https://d3fy651gv2fhd3.cloudfront.net/charts/spain-government-debt-to-gdp@2x.png?s=espdebt2gdp&amp;v=201704301925v ) : check change from 2008 . 
  this is a big mistake !, 
  fix first eu immigration : close borders , create an eu deportation service ... only then can we start to mop up the immigration/refugee mess , sharing the burden among all eu countries . 
  i agree with you but not now . 
  later when both uk & eu have learned something from brexit . 
   he has been a consistent and strong figure come on , do n't be shy : `` he has been an strong and stable figure ... '' ;-), 
   i like britains . 
  how many britains do you want ? 
  one is trouble enough !, 
  a ` shitshow by some politicians to grab more power ' . 
  uk men or `` uk men '' ? 
  was n't spanking forbidden in the uk ? 
  or was it face-sitting ? 
  plus-plus bonus : the victims would scream with a [ funny voice ] ( https://youtu.be/tas-xnvyse0 ) . 
  that 's incredibly evil !, 
  the police had his fingerprints from day one . 
  good luck !, 
  the eu needs a re-foundation and the uk some soul searching . 
  hope you can join us again some day . 
  we do . 
  you still belong to the eu , come over , stay for a few years and get residency/citizenship . 
  it is not enough , we want the british remainers in the eu too . 
  britain brain drain !, 
  you have drawn him too gay , muslim nuts will go berserk !, 
  clicking boldly for yurop !, 
  was n't so risky :-) . 
  linux is global . 
  suse is a linux based distro . 
  suse is a german based company . 
  it was bought by an american company which , i think , was later bought by another american company . 
  my first linux distro was suse when it was still german . 
  me too but it would be odd if it were otherwise : eu means european union . 
  this should not be news . 
   abba-music is n't a valid contribution . 
  what 's the matter with newspapers nowadays ? 
   pm may calls for strong and stable backing to counter eu 's ` aggressive ' brexit stance, 
   now let 's ask the natives . 
  now let 's ask the natives , now , before there is a muslim majority !, 
   you can lead a horse to water , but you ca n't make him drink . 
  me too !, 
  i like your user-name , very descriptive . 
  british tissue companies . 
  eu companies are safe , thank you ;-), 
  reminds me of [ historias de la frivolidad ] ( https://youtu.be/g1jmgdqyoo8 ) . 
  women of the ` feminine league against frivolity ' sing : we are puritans ... we use scissors ... we use inkwells ... we cut , break , cross out ... we lower skirts , raise necklines ... ... 
  dear uk brothers and sisters , you are fucked !, 
  :-( edit : and sisters, 
   title implies it got better title implies it got from bad to worse ( wurst ), 
  i am too old to learn new microshit names ;-) i did n't even know about barrapunto . 
  i have bookmarked it . 
  well said . 
  we changed smoking laws ( where it is forbidden ) in spain and the change has been surprisingly smooth . 
  sigh ... 
  no gaming in public institutions . 
  linux should be used in universities , hospitals , ministries ...

  it is like quitting smoking , hard at first but worth-while in the long term .
