  public institutions ' it support , maintainers , must be tech-savvy , not users : a nurse using an specific application ( or basic ones : sending mail , browsing . . ) in a hospital does not need to be tech-savvy , for her/him it would be the same if the os is linux or windows . 
  there is a world-wide linux community . 
  linux developers are all over the world . 
  linux is global . 
  if you use a global operating system instead of ms windows , yes , you reduce dependency on us 's it . 
  users in public institutions use specialized applications to do their jobs - it is the same if those applications run on linux or windoze . 
  basic usage , opening applications , sending mails , browsing ... is the same in all distros . 
  the important parts , linux kernel , core-utils , etc , are common to all distributions . 
  public institutions can hire tech-savvy people and use linux . 
  that 's nonsense . 
  i have been using linux for almost 15 years and i have never needed windoze . 
  linux is free , uses standard formats , there is a linux community always happy to help , open code is ... open and can be reviewed by anyone , you get frequent , free updates ... 
  congratulations portugal !, 
  ( but i prefer [ ilinka ] ( https://youtu.be/zshc7idubcq ) ), 
  yeah !, 
  i agree but you need both , carrot and stick . 
  we need to show putin a credible stick . 
  ( if you want peace , prepare for war ), 
  let 's !, 
  garda\u00ed should look for people outraged by the blasphemy law . 
  i want an ` european deportation service ' to control illegal immigration . 
  uncontrolled immigration + basic income = ?? 
  i am pro basic income . 
  technology , ai , robotics ... make it inevitable . 
  strong and stable censorship ;-), 
   . . and so it goes on and on fify, 
  it is not the same . 
  the weather-girl rules !, 
  wow !,

  let 's meet in the middle :  `` spanish halenchon '' ( sanchez ) ;-), 
  note : entender : understand ( i understand : entiendo ) intentar : try/intend ( i try : intento ) what i am trying to say ... : lo que intento decir ... 
   `` spanish melenchon '' ( sanchez ) fify, 
  ` aleix salo ' is a spanish author . 
  [ here are some of his books/comics ] ( https://www.casadellibro.com/libros-ebooks/aleix-salo/157929 ) . 
  this is very , very old . 
  you ca n't frighten anyone with a plough :-(, 
   ` about half of the people i have spoken in turkey have already returned to belgium ' too good to be true :-( . 
  what a stupid , useless questionnaire !, 
  and spain is not included in the list of countries . 
  we are lucky we are so good at integrating non-eu immigrants in europe . 
  i shudder to think what would happen , with the thousands being ferried in , from libya , daily , if we did n't have that amazing ability !, 
  we are lucky we are so good at integrating non-eu immigrants in europe . 
  i shudder to think what would happen , with the thousands being ferried in , from libya , daily , if we did n't have that amazing ability !, 
  saying that solves nothing . 
  do n't let them in !, 
  it is a pity france did n't succeed . 
  we 'd be much better off now . 
  i am spanish , like / u/seamstress80 , but much older . 
  kids had to be independent earlier then . 
  now that there are many answers i would like to have op answer his/her own question , what is it like in the usa ? 
  i was referring to some muslim neighbourhoods . 
  there is also the poor integration of gypsies in europe after several centuries here . 
  edit : i was talking about europe in general , not only estonia . 
  it is n't going to happen ~ ~ as quickly ~ ~ . 
   is n't going to happen . 
  fify, 
   do you think that it 's warmer than previous years ? 
  definitely !, 
  i am from madrid but i have been living in colunga the last 10 years . 
  i live in asturias , close to a beach called [ ` the greek ( woman ) ' ] ( http://mas.lne.es/playas/colunga/81/playa-la-griega.html ) . 
  i walk there almost every day . 
  the name refers to an old legend : a local tribeswoman falls in love with a greek sailor . 
  greek trading ship departs never to come back . 
  pregnant tribeswoman is mocked by locals who call her `` the greek '' ... 
  ) , is an alleged war cry of iberian troops during the reconquista , and of the spanish empire . 
  in english , it is often translated as `` santiago and close , spain ! '', 
  or `` santiago and at them , spain ! '', 
  supposedly , its first usage was during the battle of las navas de tolosa , and was utilized in each occasion that spanish troops fought muslims . 
  the meaning of the phrase is to praise st. james the apostle , patron saint of spain , and to charge or to attack ( `` close in on them ! '' ) . 
  the `` spain '' , in the end , refers to the recipient of the phrase : the spanish troops . 
  feeling generous today ? 
  our [ real academia espa\u00f1ola ] ( http://www.rae.es/la-institucion/historia/origenes ) , created in 1713 , was modelled on the ` acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise ' . 
  saving rotten ( boards full of politicians for many years ) savings banks , with lots of public money , knowing beforehand that merging two or more rotten banks does n't solve anything . 
  many of them had , finally , to be sold for $ 1 . 
  edit : [ spanish government debt ] ( https://d3fy651gv2fhd3.cloudfront.net/charts/spain-government-debt-to-gdp@2x.png?s=espdebt2gdp&amp;v=201704301925v ) : check change from 2008 . 
  it is the same in spain . 
  i do n't know if it makes you feel better , we have this saying : `` mal de muchos consuelo de tontos '' ( evil for many , balm for fools ), 
  a long , long time ago i was working for the dutch company phillips . 
  the first time i travelled to holland , to attend a training course , i was told i could not be spanish because i was too quiet and reasonable . 
  [ my results ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/12/20/sunday-review/dialect-quiz-map.html?r=4140248048001200j0801000014001050810000j010108j000 ), 
  i have travelled , with a backpack , not as a tourist , a lot in europe , asia and africa . 
  i have seen what religion does to societies . 
  iran has no future unless they decide to leave behind stupid , religious fantasies . 
  they are still ruled by religious nuts . 
  i have never been there but , when i read [ whirlwind ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whirlwind_\\ ( novel \\ ) ) , i thought `` there is no future for iran '' . 
  i still think so unless they can get rid of religion ( very unlikely ) . 
  [ lucius quinctius cincinnatus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lucius_quinctius_cincinnatus ) . 
   despite his old age , he worked his own small farm until an invasion prompted his fellow citizens to call for his leadership . 
  he came from his plough to assume complete control over the state but , upon achieving a swift victory , relinquished his power and its perquisites and returned to his farm . 
  european suicide . 
  i used to read much more but now that i am old i only read books ( usually from a tablet ) for a couple of hours after lunch . 
  thank you !, 
  i found it very entertaining . 
  it is a kind of autobiography told by way of recounting ` adventures ' he had in different stages of his life . 
  anecdotes include observing ants , his work in the manhattan project , cracking safes , playing bongos , learning how to pick up girls ... 
  he calls a spade a spade and criticizes psychologists , institutions , intellectual bullshit ... 
  very refreshing in nowadays politically correct world .
