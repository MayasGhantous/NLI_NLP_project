  not young any more :-( . 
  i only use tv as a pc monitor . 
  india , nepal , asia : china , philippines , indonesia , malaysia , laos , thailand , singapore ... ( worked as tourist guide in india , nepal & thailand ) . 
  turkey , africa : egypt , algeria , mali , ivory coast , burkina faso ( crossed sahara & sahel deserts in an old car - sold in mali ) . 
  most of it backpacking . 
  about 20 books per year . 
  last book read : [ surely you 're joking , mr. 
  feynman ! ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surely_you%27re_joking,_mr._feynman !, 
  anything could have been worse ... [ zdf - islam - effects on germany ] ( https://youtu.be/kvwaikoatwm ), 
   well i think germany has done a fairly good job . 
  we learned a lot about immigration and integration [ referendum - t\u00fcrken in deutschland deutlich h\u00e4ufiger f\u00fcr `` ja '' abgestimmt als in der t\u00fcrkei . 
  ergebnis in de [ ja ~ 63 % ] [ nein ~ 37 % ] ] ( https://i.redd.it/wycown7cyyry.png ), 
  of course , but they stay out of the eu until they are granted asylum/residency and those that have tried to enter the eu illegally will be placed last in request queues . 
  if eu politicians really wanted to solve the issue ( from previous posts ) : the only way to stop the , ever increasing , wave of immigrants/refugees is to move them to external camps with plenty of media coverage . 
  they 'll soon learn that it is not worth the risk , money , etc. . . to come illegally in europe because they 'll always end in an external camp . 
  note : [ australians are doing just that ] ( https://youtu.be/knyx1o6panu ) . 
  __________________________ external camps should be located in non european countries . 
  there would be economic compensation and humanitarian aid . 
  the cost would be a fracion of what we are spending now . 
  supporting immigrants/refugees is much cheaper outside europe . 
  many lives would be saved as the dangerous crossing to europe would be stopped . 
  __________________________ europe ca n't solve all the problems of the world . 
  we should accept only those immigrants/refugees that we can safely integrate in our societies . 
  that means a thorough check of those ( limited numbers ) we let come in ( as canada , australia ... are doing ) . 
  it is an easy choice : we deal rationally with this problem or we commit cultural ( economic , social ... ) suicide . 
  __________________________ we need an ` european deportation service ' . 
  eu countries would send rejected immigrants/refugees to the ` eds ' and forget about them . 
  an ` european deportation service ' would have more clout than any individual country to arrange agreements with non eu countries , etc. 
  kitchen . 
  uk ( welcoming back the prodigal son ) , canada , nz , australia . 
  russia in a far away future . 
  unless companies , with intensive use of technology , robotics , ai , pay taxes according to their profits . 
  only a small percentage of the population need have a job . 
  the most important task of the population should be to produce new batches of well educated , intelligent , creative , people . 
  quality over quantity . 
  specially with the increasing use of technology , robotics , ai ... 
  well they have n't , apparently they are german citizens but still can vote in the turkish referendum . 
  otherwise erdogan would not have bothered to hold campaign rallies in germany . 
  just curious : what about the german-turks that vote in turkish elections ? 
  do n't they have dual citizenship ? 
  australia . 
  you are right . 
  i use bottled water when travelling in some areas of catalu\u00f1a and valencia but tap water is excellent in the rest of spain . 
  yes . 
  gandhi wrote : `` there must be no impatience , no barbarity , no insolence , no undue pressure . 
  if we want to cultivate a true spirit of democracy , we can not afford to be intolerant . 
  intolerance betrays want of faith in one 's cause . '', 
  i guess you should n't be concerned . 
  [ i am a gandhi :-( ] ( https://www.politicalcompass.org/yourpoliticalcompass?ec=-3.38&amp;soc=-3.28 ), 
  yes , i do . 
  wow !, 
  that 's a very useful tool !, 
  thank you very much !, 
  i can use it if i have to make a formal complaint . 
  thank you . 
  you are right but it is better than ` ms explorer ' behaviour that apparently does n't detect anything wrong . 
  thank you for the information . 
  sorry about your cajamar issue . 
  at least they erred on the side of caution . 
  thank you . 
  there should be an eu wide agency to check these things . 
  thank you . 
  i 'll read the information carefully . 
  i do n't think it is a problem with spanish certificates . 
  a couple of weeks before the website security warning , i received an email asking me to fill in an investor profile form . 
  the website 's menu item to access the form was a link to ` https://mykyc.andbank.es' and , when i clicked on it , i received a ` connection not secure ' message . 
  i just did n't fill in the form and continued using the web-site without problems . 
  they must have added more calls to ` https://mykyc.andbank.es' in the last week and that 's why now i get the ` connection not secure ' message after web-site log-in . 
  i guess ` firefox ' asks for ` https://mykyc.andbank.es' certificate and that server does n't answer . 
  i have checked the html code of the website 's main page ( after website login ) and all the references to the mentioned server are related to the investor 's profile form . 
  : https://mykyc.andbank.es/enquestamifidinversis/inicitestconveniencia.do ... 
  it is too much of a bother . 
  i 'll see if i can force them to do something about it . 
  thank you . 
  i 'll try both . 
  the bank ( inversis ) is quite modern and i have had no problems until now . 
  it was bought , a couple of years ago , by an andorran bank ( andbank ) . 
  thank you . 
  i use linux and i have never used explorer . 
  i am not going to install it now but i have asked a friend , who also has an account in this bank ( you need to register to get the ` not secure ' warning ) , to try for me . 
  religions are childish fantasies . 
  i hope someday mankind is rid of them . 
  it seems once there was a big plague and the most obvious symptom was sneezing . 
  people took to crossing themselves whenever somebody sneezed , muttering : `` jesus , maria and joseph '' . 
  yes . 
  if an individual is in default of a bank loan , his assets can be impounded . 
  to do that to a country is much more tricky . 
  old programmer adage : `` riro : rubbish in , rubbish out . '', 
  if you give a computer program rubbish data as input , you 'll get rubbish results . 
  rubbish data :  since we all know the greek debt crisis is caused by germany imposing restrictions on governmental debt in name of ` fiscal responsibility ', 
  not wonderful but it is the best i can find locally . 
  making the most of the last years of the eu . 
  european politicians ' stupidity . 
  if eu politicians really wanted to solve the issue ( from previous posts ) : the only way to stop the , ever increasing , wave of immigrants/refugees is to move them to external camps with plenty of media coverage . 
  they 'll soon learn that it is not worth the risk , money , etc. . . to come illegally in europe because they 'll always end in an external camp .
