  completely agree with op . 
  in spain we need a complete overhaul of our political system . 
  ( current politicians are despicable too ! ), 
  yes , and the legend rings true : '' \u00a1 qu\u00e9 buen vasallo si hubiera buen se\u00f1or ! '' . 
  ( what a good servant if he had a good lord ! ) . 
  we have not have good ` lords ' in spain since the catholic queen and king ( you can criticize some of what they did but they really tried their best : spent most of their lives on horseback , checking their kingdom ) . 
  yes . 
  never used it . 
  just reading . 
  i used to buy second hand books here : [ bookstalls in madrid ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:bookstalls_in_madrid.jpg ), 
  so was i. 
  it seems the whole '61 or more ' is just me !, 
  send her to egypt 's muslim brothers !, 
  spain [ iberosphere ] ( http://iberosphere.com/ ), 
  there are many more . 
  that was my point , hollywood remakes everything because they are out of ideas . 
  how many french remakes of usa movies can you remember ? 
  and yankee remakes of french movies ? 
  thanks oldpeopleguitarsolo !, 
  i agree it sounds wrong but are n't you supposed to use ` an ' if the following word starts with a vowel ? 
  it sounds right to me . 
  we 'll be sorry if it fails . 
  nothing easier , go for it !, 
  i was very excited about an european union , so much so that , before there was physical euro currency , i bought traveller checks in euros to travel in south east asia . 
  i arrived in singapore ( to buy cheap plane tickets ) and did n't have any problems cashing them . 
  alas , it was different in other countries : in jakarta ( indonesia ) , my next stop , nobody knew about the euro . 
  after visiting many banks i finally found one which agreed to exchange the euro checks to indonesian rupiahs . 
  i was afraid i would have the same problem in other countries i was planning to visit ( malaysia , thailand , laos ... ) so i exchanged all my traveller checks . 
  next day a bomb exploded in jakarta 's stock exchange and the rupiah was strongly devalued . 
  i kept on travelling but i was a very poor backpacker !, 
  common sense and leadership . 
  a lot of words to say nothing . 
  immigrarefugeeddon !, 
  ( end of europe ), 
   most european nations still side with germany . 
  not any more ( government ! = nation ) . 
  the emigrant/refugee fuck up is very hard to stomach !, 
  no common sense solution in sight and ~ 5000 invading europe daily . 
  i wo n't blame the uk if they get out , and i am pro eu ( but deeply disappointed ) . 
  the sooner the german government realizes it fucked up , the better . 
  i watched it . 
  the foreign minister ` won ' the interview in my opinion . 
  it is a pity he could not include ` videos ' ( like the one showing a mass of angry young men throwing stones and kicking a gate ) in his answers as we can do here !, 
  how stupid can our politicians be ? 
  there are no smugglers on the boats , immigrants man them !, 
  the only way to stop the , ever increasing , wave of immigrants/refugees is to move them to external camps with plenty of media coverage . 
  they 'll soon learn that it is not worth the risk , money , etc. . . to come illegally in europe because you 'll always end in an external camp . 
   european heads of state [ stupid twits ] ( https://youtu.be/tsqkdct25ss ) !, 
  have you heard the sentence `` bite off more than one can chew '' ? 
  the eu has to be able to control how many and what kind of immigrants/refugees it accepts . 
  if it is force-fed it will ` get sick ' , will ` vomit ' and it could even die . 
  one of my previous posts : living things have barriers that separates them from the rest of the world . 
  a living thing controls its barrier letting in nutrients , for instance , and pushing out waste matter . 
  if the living thing ca n't control its barrier ( or if it is broken ) it will die because too much ( or poisonous ) nutrients get in or because vital material gets out . 
  countries - or a union of countries - are living things and must have control of their borders or ` die ' . 
  they must control how many and which type of immigrants/refugees to let in . 
  too many ( or the wrong type ) will cause ` indigestion ' , ` serious illness ' and probably ` death ' . 
  europe currently does n't have control of its borders . 
  anyone can come in and there is ( and there will be in the foreseeable future ) an unlimited amount of immigrants/refugees . 
  europe ca n't control what happens in afghanistan , iraq , libya , syria , nigeria , sudan , eritrea ... ( i am all for trying - un , humanitarian help , advice - but do n't hold your breath ) but it can control its borders . 
  europe can do what australia does : divert immigrants/refugees to a safe place and then select ( in numbers that wo n't cause ` indigestion ' ) those that can be better integrated in our societies . 
  we must realize that what we have in europe is unique : democracy , freedom of speech , gender equality , secularism ... 
  unfortunately it is not irreversible and we can lose what many generations paid in blood and suffering to get . 
  now that we are all ` on the same page ' ( or willing to be ) it would be a pity if we committed cultural suicide . 
  i do n't know about the npd but the flyer 's contents is plain common sense . 
  this has been said a million times here . 
  we have a saying in spain : `` no hay peor ciego que \u00e9l que no quiere ver '' ( the worse kind of blind person is that who does not want to see ), 
  [ documentary done recently by zdf on islam & integration in germany ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3knafd/documentary_done_recently_by_zdf_on_islam/ ) [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=87&amp;v=kvwaikoatwm ), 
  deported to sweden ? 
  beer with lunch . 
  it is not sustainable to allow everybody in the eu and not to deport anyone . 
  no matter the reasons , reality ca n't be denied . 
  welfare_state + unchecked_unskilled_immigration / refugees = disaster, 
   it would be a logistic nightmare not if you do it in batches . 
  gather incoming immigrants/refugees , in let 's say lampedusa and , when there are enough to fill a transport ship , move them to the external camps . 
   there is also a lot of immigration from within europe immigrants/refugees coming from europe should be moved to camps just outside eu borders . 
   my problem is that we are selectively applying human rights europe ca n't accept every immigrant/refugee ( afghanistan , iraq , libya , syria , nigeria , sudan , eritrea . . ) . 
  if we have to select a subset of them , why not those that are better suited to live in europe ? 
   i would suggest controlled borders where you have hot spots no . 
  we should send a clear message : it is not worth the risk , money , etc. . . to come illegally in europe because you 'll always end in an external camp . 
   but what would the ` european deportation service ' do with those rejected people ? 
  yes , that 's a tricky question . 
  move them to the external camps and wait until they give up ? 
  what is clear is that they ca n't stay illegally in the eu . 
  the ` european deportation service ' should be a ` black box ' to european governments : illegal person deported , next !, 
  where would you rather have the calais illegal immigrants ? 
  calais ' jungle or external camp ? 
  completely agree . 
  that should be included in :  common european immigrant/refugee rules and procedures, 
  my post in [ ( ( serious discussion ) ) on september 23rd eu leaders will meet for the migrant summit.what changes do you want to see ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lpq5u/serious_discussion_on_september_23rd_eu_leaders/ ) : - immigrant/refugee camps out of europe ( rent , fund whatever ) . 
  - all immigrants/refugees arriving in europe without permission must be moved to above camps ( with plenty of media coverage ) . 
  something similar to what australia is doing . 
  - select , from above immigrant/refugee camps ( in sustainable numbers ) those that can be better integrated in our societies . 
  - common european immigrant/refugee rules and procedures ( processing requests , rejections , etc ) . 
  - common european border protection and immigrant/refugee deportation . 
  european countries should send rejected immigrants/refugees to the ` european deportation service ' . 
  they do ( ceuta , melilla , pateras ... ) , but it is not news any more . 
  i am envious . 
  yes , all forgotten .
