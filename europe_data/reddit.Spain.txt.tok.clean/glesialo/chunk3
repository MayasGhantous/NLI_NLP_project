  i hate ideologies , both left and right , they are as bad as religion . 
  why ca n't we have politicians with common sense ? 
  not a word of it in spanish news . 
  bleeding-hearts circumvented the government and forced granting him ( and his whole family , wife and two children , who they fetched from turkey ) asylum . 
  the foreign affairs minister had to accept the ` fait accompli ' but asked them not to do it again . 
  yes . 
  like the french do . 
  european borders . 
  schengen borders should be open . 
  - immigrant/refugee camps out of europe ( rent , fund whatever ) . 
  - all immigrants/refugees arriving in europe without permission must be moved to above camps ( with plenty of media coverage ) . 
  something similar to what australia is doing . 
  - select , from above immigrant/refugee camps ( in sustainable numbers ) those that can be better integrated in our societies . 
  - common european immigrant/refugee rules and procedures ( processing requests , rejections , etc ) . 
  - common european border protection and immigrant/refugee deportation . 
  european countries should send rejected immigrants/refugees to the ` european deportation service ' . 
  but we did !, 
  anyone reading the news ( spanish ceuta & melilla , french calais , italian lampedusa , greek ... ) knew what was coming . 
  politicians chose to ignore it and when they finally did something , they fucked up . 
  a sane european country . 
  well done finns !, 
  they mean ` external borders ' . 
  i do n't call countries feeble minded , just a part of their citizens that follow ideologies instead of common sense . 
  i prefer to understand weakness as ` feeble mindedness ' in the sentence . 
  hush , spain is full of lefties !, 
   `` i might say that the most dangerous combination known in history is to be both rich and weak . 
  there is no combination more dangerous than this . 
  it is only a matter of time before someone comes along , notices your weakness , and takes what you have . 
  this will definitely happen if you are unable to defend yourself . 
  the liberal philosophy is a result of a europe which is weak and which also wants to protect its wealth ; but if europe is weak , it can not protect this wealth . '', 
  very ` politically incorrect ' but true !, 
  i think it is from [ ancient rome ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/aquila_non_captat_muscas ) and there is an extra line : `` but woe the fly that sets on the eagle 's beak '' ( or something like that ), 
  same here :-( disappointed spaniard . 
   filet mignon halal filet mignon !, 
  i 'd also prefer to have the camps outside the eu , but any change from open ( broken ) european borders and masses of non europeans wandering at will in europe is good news . 
  too good to be true considering the idiocy of european politicians . 
  please fill in the blanks : ` basic income ' + ` unchecked , unskilled immigration ' = ' _____ ', 
  what i meant when i said it is not obvious to politicians is :  `` it would be `` impossible '' for europe to provide sanctuary to everyone in need '', 
  what i agreed is obvious , but not to politicians , is :  `` it would be `` impossible '' for europe to provide sanctuary to everyone in need '', 
   is n't that obvious ? 
  not for politicians . 
   eu governments are expected to back radical new plans for the detention of `` irregular migrants '' , the creation of large new refugee camps in italy and greece and longer-term aims for the funding and building of refugee camps outside the eu to try to stop people coming to europe . 
  too good to be true . 
  what it is doing . 
  they want a faster ferry service . 
  no , i do n't hear anybody making common sense questions about the sustainability of admitting immigrants continuously . 
  i think the general public thinks it is a one off situation . 
  the only party which could oppose admitting more immigrants/refugees is the one in the government ( no other parties to their right ) and they , obviously , have decided not to do so . 
  local governments , that are in the hands of lefties after recent elections , are trying to outdo each other with offers to accept groups of immigrants . 
  i want common sense policies . 
  i hate ideologies ( both left and right ) , they are as bad as religion . 
  yes , a lot of immigrants cross ceuta and melilla borders and others come , in small boats , directly to the peninsula . 
  some stay illegally ( ca n't be returned to their original countries because they refuse to say where they are from ) and others move on to europe . 
  some european politicians have complained about the ` cruelty ' of [ ceuta and melilla borders ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/desalambre/valla_de_melilla/ ) , i guess they want to let everybody in . 
  spanish popularparty ( no other parties to their right ) accepted a quota of about 20000 after our pm paid a visit to merkel . 
  lefties were surprised and silent for one day . 
  now they say that 20000 is too little , proposing 40000 , 60000 ... 
   according to one security council diplomat , the resolution would allow for boats to be seized and for the people on board to be taken to italy , where the authorities would determine who among them might be eligible for asylum because they were fleeing war or persecution . 
   `` it 's our moral and legal duty to take those people to safety , which means north , not south , '' added the diplomat , who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the proposal before it was put before the council . 
  `` it would be for the italians to work out which of them were refugees and which were not . '' they want to import refugees/immigrants faster . 
  i have just said ` falafel ' one hundred times . 
  does europe has control of its borders now ? 
  time to wake up !, 
  living things have barriers that separates them from the rest of the world . 
  a living thing controls its barrier letting in nutrients , for instance , and pushing out waste matter . 
  if the living thing ca n't control its barrier ( or if it is broken ) it will die because too much ( or poisonous ) nutrients get in or because vital material gets out . 
  countries - or a union of countries - are living things and must have control of their borders or ` die ' . 
  they must control how many and which type of immigrants/refugees to let in . 
  too many ( or the wrong type ) will cause ` indigestion ' , ` serious illness ' and probably ` death ' . 
  europe currently does n't have control of its borders . 
  anyone can come in and there is ( and there will be in the foreseeable future ) an unlimited amount of immigrants/refugees . 
  europe ca n't control what happens in afghanistan , iraq , libya , syria , nigeria , sudan , eritrea ... ( i am all for trying - un , humanitarian help , advice - but do n't hold your breath ) but it can control its borders . 
  europe can do what australia does : divert immigrants/refugees to a safe place and then select ( in numbers that wo n't cause ` indigestion ' ) those that can be better integrated in our societies . 
  we must realize that what we have in europe is unique : democracy , freedom of speech , gender equality , secularism ... 
  unfortunately it is not irreversible and we can lose what many generations paid in blood and suffering to get . 
  now that we are all ` on the same page ' ( or willing to be ) it would be a pity if we committed cultural suicide . 
  i wrote in another thread : we are nearing a future when unskilled labour will be made redundant by technology . 
  a percentage of the population wo n't have a job ( its main purpose to provide a varied gene-pool from which creative individuals emerge ) and will have to be paid a minimum wage by the state . 
  such an economy can not survive with an ever increasing influx of non-skilled immigrants . 
  does this unbanned thread mean that you are no longer one of / r/europe / mods ? 
  then valhalla ? 
   [ shut up nazi ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3k2hj7/greek_woman_in_lesbos_crying_her_life_destroyed ) a thread that has disappeared from / r/europe / . 
  i am , sadly , in the same situation as you . 
  the eu and europe have no future . 
  the original video link was banned and could not be reposted . 
  this is another copy of the same video . 
  the title is a description of the video . 
  ask the woman in the video if it is an invasion . 
  this video was [ banned several times ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jzudv/lesbos_on_verge_of_explosion_as_refugees_crowd/cuttam7 ) . 
  let 's hope it stays this time . 
  because that 's what it is . 
  there is a mixture of both and those syrians coming , for instance , from turkey ( where they were safe ) are not really refugees . 
  please upvote . 
  i resubmitted one of the videos two times and both have been [ removed as duplicates ] ( http://i.imgur.com/o5bcjtb.png ) . 
  i used this thread 's title the first time and thought that was the reason it was considered a duplicate . 
  i used ` greek woman in lesbos crying : her life destroyed by refugee/immigrant invasion ' as title the second time and it was removed too . 
  it seems they have banned the video link . 
  i quite agree with the [ result ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xrsh596.png ) even though i did n't like many of the questions . 
  is n't multiculturalism wonderful ?
