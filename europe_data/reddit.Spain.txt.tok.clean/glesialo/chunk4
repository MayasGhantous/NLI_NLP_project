  and a glass of red wine !, 
  that would be much better but european politicians have made abundantly clear that that 's not going to happen . 
  no , that would be like emptying the sea with a teaspoon . 
  we can provide humanitarian help , advice , etc. 
  but we ca n't change whole societies ( remember the arab spring ? ), 
  they have to change themselves . 
  the only thing we can do is control our borders , reject all illegal immigrants and choose which asylum seekers can be integrated in our societies . 
  once they realize that illegal immigration to europe is impossible , they 'll stop trying and many lives will be spared . 
  spanish : snow . 
  let me know what you think of this ( crazy ? ), 
  idea : european style ` colony ' in africa . 
  europe rents ( for one hundred years ? ), 
  inhospitable territory in africa , paying the rightful owner ( country ) for it ( let 's say the former spanish sahara : 266,000 square kilometres ) . 
  europe provides a basic state structure ( constitution , etc ) money and expertise to ` terra-form ' the territory with advanced technology ( solar & wind farms , desalination plants , greenhouses , etc ) . 
  europe sets up a road map for democratic self rule and a temporary european governor . 
  europe grants special partner status to the ` colony ' ( trade , political , cultural relations , etc ) . 
  all illegal immigrants arriving/already in europe are transported to the ` colony ' where they are offered the chance to start a new life or to wait until they can return to their original country . 
  plenty of jobs for them there . 
  advantages : probably cheaper that current scheme to deal with illegal immigration ; sends a message to would be immigrants and human traffickers : all illegal immigrants found in europe will be deported ( to place of origin or to the ` colony ' ) ; europe will become the world leader in clean energy , advanced agriculture , etc ; the colony will , hopefully , produce western culture compatible citizens ... 
  we are nearing a future when unskilled labour will be made redundant by technology . 
  a percentage of the population wo n't have a job ( its main purpose to provide a varied gene-pool from which creative individuals emerge ) and will have to be paid a minimum wage by the state . 
  such an economy can not survive with an ever increasing influx of non-skilled immigrants . 
   it is the eu that bailed out greece french and german banks because the greeks spent the banks ' ( stupid ) loans and then could n't repay them . 
  ftfy . 
  costas gavras ( euronews interview ) : `` greece is a nation but not a state '' . 
  i have been several times in greece . 
  greeks , generally , are good people , intelligent and hard working but they do n't trust their own institutions and rightly so . 
  they ca n't change in a short time . 
  some external agency ( eu ? ), 
  must help them to start a virtuous circle where : greek institutions improve , greeks trust institutions more , greeks critically elect better leaders to improve institutions ... 
  it is the same situation in spain but we are at a later stage . 
  thank you eu !, 
  [ the actual greek reform proposals ] ( http://www.naftemporiki.gr/finance/story/976680/the-greek-reform-proposals ) ( from / r/economics / ) . 
  fully agree . 
  those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad . 
  greeks spent the banks ' bad loans . 
  it is unfair that the banks were bailed but : banks -  greece eu money -  banks that means : eu money -  greece, 
  spain is turning to the left . 
  i hate both right and left . 
  ideology is as bad as religion . 
  why ca n't we have intelligent , rational politicians ? 
  yes . 
  europe , flooded with ` non eu migrants ' , forgets its , hard-won , heritage of freedom , equal civil rights , etc. 
  sharia and blasphemy laws anyone ? 
  we are nearing a future when unskilled labour will be made redundant by technology . 
  a percentage of the population wo n't have a job ( its main purpose to provide a varied gene-pool from which creative individuals emerge ) and will have to be paid a minimum wage by the state . 
  such an economy can not survive with an ever increasing influx of non-skilled migrants . 
  we should make absolutely clear that all illegal migrants will be expelled from europe . 
  it is the only way to discourage them from trying to come and to avoid so many deaths . 
  i did n't get that impression . 
  it seems that french workers do not get that without profitable business there will be no jobs . 
  relevant [ bbc documentary ] ( https://youtu.be/d2gm-yckoy0 ) ( quelle catastrophe !, 
  france ) . 
  they could be put in charge of migration/refugee policy !, 
  the only way to stop the , ever increasing , wave of immigrants/refugees is to move them to external camps with plenty of media coverage . 
  they 'll soon learn that it is not worth the risk , money , etc. . . to come illegally in europe because they 'll always end in an external camp .

  he also wanted to expel hungary from the eu because they set up fences to stop the poor ( 250 % women - most of them pregnant - and children ) refugees . 
  i look forward to this news : `` in the 21st century , the eu banned services in arabic .

  he probably meant ` foiled ' . 
  many years ago , i was in holland attending a course on the operating system unix . 
  there were people from all over europe including several britons . 
  the official language was english . 
  during a question and answer period a guy from london , who spoke with a thick accent , stood up and asked a question . 
  we fell silent , but nobody could understand him . 
  the dutch guy giving the lecture switched off the a.c. 
  it was really quiet now . 
  we barely dared to breathe while the english guy repeated the question ... again and again and again ... 
  the lecturer finally understood and then translated , into english , for the rest of us . 
  he knows but will forget it ` eventually ' .

  czech republic in easter :  in the morning , men spank women with a special handmade whip ... 
  the spanking may be painful , but it 's not intended to cause suffering . 
  a legend says that women should be spanked with a whip in order to keep their health , beauty and fertility during the whole next year . 
  ancient rome 's lupercalia :  girls and young women would line up on their route to receive lashes from these whips .
