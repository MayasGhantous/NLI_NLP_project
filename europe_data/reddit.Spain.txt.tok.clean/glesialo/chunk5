  words , words ... 
  integration should be already in place with a common eu immigration policy and the necessary services ( eu border control , eu migrant/refugee registry , deportation ... ) . 
  we have known for a long time that [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_madrid_train_bombings ) was going to happen . 
  and do n't tell me it is n't the eu fault , that national politicians make things difficult , etc. 
  if the eu ca n't achieve something as basic as protecting its citizens , then it is badly designed and deserves to disappear . 
   what exactly do you think is against a european defence policy ? 
  idiocy and incompetence . 
  what !, 
  without agenda scheduling , intensive meetings , moving speeches ... do you mean , actually doing something ? 
  yes , you can read about it in wikipedia ( link above ) . 
  reminds me of the [ stone of scone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stone_of_scone ) .

  yes , the europe full of hot air ( and ideology ) and the europe that gets together and actually does something . 
   police arrested the six men aged 17 , 19 , 22 , 23 , 24 and 45 years of preliminary determination that come from afghanistan , iraq and syria . 
  according to a police spokeswoman least five of had men applied for asylum in germany . 
  who did she steal them from ? 
  i had not the foggiest but your question made me look it up . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%87 ) : spanish has not used the symbol since an orthographic reform in the 18th century ( which replaced \u00e7 with the now-devoiced z ) , but it was adopted for writing other languages . 
  it seems it is used in catalan ( another spanish language ) . 
   they do n't want the ethnic , religious and cultural homogeneity of their societies to change . 
  they see multiculturalism as a failed model . 
  they are not blind . 
  full media coverage of this would stem the flow of migrants . 
  who wants to risk life and money to be stranded at a closed border ? 
  let 's hope so ... 
  montecoloured, 
   a clear announcement tv , newspapers , media ... showing masses of migrants stopped at closed borders .

   greek industry dreamers, 
   i 've been saying for ages you , me and almost everyone in / r/europe / . 
  i even have a default comment ( but i do n't bother any more ) : if eu politicians really wanted to solve the issue ( from previous posts ) : the only way to stop the , ever increasing , wave of immigrants/refugees is to move them to external camps with plenty of media coverage . 
  they 'll soon learn that it is not worth the risk , money , etc. . . to come illegally in europe because they 'll always end in an external camp . 
  note : [ australians are doing just that ] ( https://youtu.be/knyx1o6panu ) . 
  __________________________ external camps should be located in non european countries . 
  there would be economic compensation and humanitarian aid . 
  the cost would be a fracion of what we are spending now . 
  supporting immigrants/refugees is much cheaper outside europe . 
  many lives would be saved as the dangerous crossing to europe would be stopped . 
  __________________________ europe ca n't solve all the problems of the world . 
  we should accept only those immigrants/refugees that we can safely integrate in our societies . 
  that means a thorough check of those ( limited numbers ) we let come in ( as canada , australia ... are doing ) . 
  it is an easy choice : we deal rationally with this problem or we commit cultural ( economic , social ... ) suicide . 
  __________________________ we need an ` european deportation service ' . 
  eu countries would send rejected immigrants/refugees to the ` eds ' and forget about them . 
  an ` european deportation service ' would have more clout than any individual country to arrange agreements with non eu countries , etc.

  now it is merkel 's turn ( `` not welcome , not welcome !, 
  ` idiot politician ' takes ` idiot ' to a whole new level . 
  plenty of media coverage of the mess developing in greece will help dissuade other migrants from coming . 
  things have to get worse ( due to stupid ue policy ) to become better . 
  you ca n't make an omelette without breaking eggs . 
  why bother , interviews will be soon in arabic . 
  yes , organize wet floor mopping by the crew while the submarine is flooded from enormous hull cracks . 
   euro zone leaders could be caught unprepared they are always unprepared . 
  compare two types of government investment ( same amount of money ) : 1 . 
  create thousands of ( unnecessary ) public jobs to boost employment and stimulate the economy . 
  legislate tax deductions for money spent by companies in research and work force training . 
  which one , do you think , will produce better results in the long run ? 
  when no common , sensible policy is offered , unilateral actions are inevitable .
