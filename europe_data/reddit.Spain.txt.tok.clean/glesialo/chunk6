  who is dumber , they or the countries that allow them in ? 
  have you ever heard of the concept ` productive investment ' ? 
  there is some polandball story here : germany committing seppuku . 
  thank you !, 
  you have forgotten the spaniards !, 
  nobody cares about us . 
  i agree with what you said but not with the way you said it . 
  have a downvote . 
  our future politicians . 
  in spanish there is a saying : `` cr\u00eda cuervos y te sacar\u00e1n los ojos '' - `` if you raise crows , they 'll peck your eyes out '' another version : `` cr\u00eda cuervos y tendr\u00e1s muchos '' - `` if you raise crows , you 'll have many ( crows ) '', 
  the damage the migrant fuck-up is causing is tremendous !, 
  and the effects , i am afraid , will be long-lasting . 
  brexit would be a disappointment but understandable : who wants to belong to something as dysfunctional as the eu ? 
  i had my doubts . 
  you can never be sure with politicians . 
  when the dust settles in spain , and we have a new government , i wo n't be surprised if they start to shout `` welcome , welcome ! '', 
  good !, 
  swedish middle east ? 
  sarcasm yes , we need more public ( quality ) jobs !, 
  imagine millions , like this hero , spending $ 37,000 every year ... 
  such progresism , much economic grow !, 
  words , words ... 
  i watched for a while : common-sense wishes for the eu that current european politicians make utterly impossible . 
  `` obras son amores y no buenas razones '' ( actions speak louder than words ), 
  count me in , too . 
  wake up ? 
  should n't it be the eu list of safe countries ? 
  where is ` more europe ' ? 
  local news ? 
  ` alice in wonderland ', 
  queen : `` why , sometimes i 've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast . '', 
  so did i , but , in general , when you meet other europeans you realize how much you have in common . 
  travel in the world and you 'll find your european identity . 
  well done !, 
  ( i played la marseillaise while reading your translation ), 
  if eu politicians really wanted to solve the issue ( from previous posts ) : the only way to stop the , ever increasing , wave of immigrants/refugees is to move them to external camps with plenty of media coverage . 
  they 'll soon learn that it is not worth the risk , money , etc. . . to come illegally in europe because they 'll always end in an external camp . 
  note : [ australians are doing just that ] ( https://youtu.be/knyx1o6panu ) . 
  __________________________ external camps should be located in non european countries . 
  there would be economic compensation and humanitarian aid . 
  the cost would be a fracion of what we are spending now . 
  supporting immigrants/refugees is much cheaper outside europe . 
  many lives would be saved as the dangerous crossing to europe would be stopped . 
  __________________________ europe ca n't solve all the problems of the world . 
  we should accept only those immigrants/refugees that we can safely integrate in our societies . 
  that means a thorough check of those ( limited numbers ) we let come in ( as canada , australia ... are doing ) . 
  it is an easy choice : we deal rationally with this problem or we commit cultural ( economic , social ... ) suicide . 
  __________________________ we need an ` european deportation service ' . 
  eu countries would send rejected immigrants/refugees to the ` eds ' and forget about them . 
  an ` european deportation service ' would have more clout than any individual country to arrange agreements with non eu countries , etc. 
  i used to go to those theatres in madrid . 
  but now i live in a small town in asturias . 
  i also prefer the original soundtrack ( whatever the language ) . 
  dubbing is a mutilation of the movie . 
  :-( luckily , with internet , dvd , br ... we can avoid that abomination . 
  it 's been ages since the last time i was in a cinema theatre . 
  the eu badly needs good leadership . 
  stay and give it a try , britain !, 
   well but a large part of europe clearly said they refuse to participate in a stupid european solution fify, 
  people have already forgotten this : [ august 2015 . 
  murder of elderly couple in sicily fuels italy 's growing anti-immigrant sentiment ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/11834743/murder-of-elderly-couple-in-sicily-fuels-italys-growing-anti-immigrant-sentiment.html ), 
  in my opinion , the eu should not get involved directly in the middle east . 
  peace talks in international arenas ( un , etc. 
  ) , advice , humanitarian aid ... but no more . 
   where do we get this zone ? 
  i bet the eu is paying ( extremely well ) lots of experts who could recommend countries likely to accept external camps . 
  those countries would receive monetary help and , perhaps , be granted some eu-partner status . 
  if there is a will there is a way . 
  we ca n't control everything that happens in the world , but we can control what happens in the eu ( including its borders ) . 
  if eu politicians really wanted to solve the issue ( from previous posts ) : the only way to stop the , ever increasing , wave of immigrants/refugees is to move them to external camps with plenty of media coverage . 
  they 'll soon learn that it is not worth the risk , money , etc. . . to come illegally in europe because they 'll always end in an external camp .

  not so . 
  once the immigrants realize they ca n't enter europe illegally , they will stop trying . 
  stop them coming !,
