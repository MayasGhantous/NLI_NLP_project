  i have commented elsewhere that we need an ` european deportation service ' . 
  eu ( and associated as norway ) countries send rejected immigrants/refugees to the ` eds ' and forget about them . 
  an ` european deportation service ' would have more clout than any individual country to arrange agreements with non eu countries , etc. 
   but i am still unsure as to whether you think frontex is purely a `` ferry service '' for immigrants first we need a common-sense policy then we can invest in the means to carry it out . 
  as things are now , frontex is an immigrant/refugee ferry service . 
   why you think i am against this is beyond me . 
  i never said that . 
  from a previous post : the only way to stop the , ever increasing , wave of immigrants/refugees is to move them to external camps with plenty of media coverage . 
  they 'll soon learn that it is not worth the risk , money , etc. . . to come illegally in europe because they 'll always end in an external camp .

  more money for the immigrant/refugee ferry service ? 
  i agree . 
  but i loved the music !, 
  countries are building fences because no common-sense , eu wide solution is coming . 
  very good article . 
  thank you !,

  - clean no-go muslim areas in europe . 
  make sure that immigrants , already in europe , ( and their descendants ) integrate in our societies . 
  - control eu external borders ( australian style ) and select , from external refugee camps , those refugees/immigrants that can be better integrated in our societies . 
  it would be much more productive to : - clean no-go muslim areas in europe .

  who says it does ? 
  after spending some time in a remote part of the north of thailand , where there were not many westerners , i flew to singapore to spend a couple of days before flying back to spain ( spain-singapore return ticket ) . 
  there were many westerners in singapore and i could not help finding them gross , uncouth and downright ugly !, 
  as ugly as me !, 
  that 's my only hope . 
  the fuck up is so great ( and the consequences so awful and long lasting ) that europe will be vaccinated against illegal immigration for a long time .

  temporary camps and then to either their country of origin or ( if they refuse to say where they are from ) some other country the eu has agreements with . 
  everyone will be fingerprinted , etc. 
  so that , if they appear in the eu again , they can be expelled right away . 
  an ` european deportation service ' would have more clout than any individual country to arrange agreements with non eu countries , etc.

  completely agree . 
  but what will happen when you combine basic income with unlimited , unskilled immigration ? 
  reality is a bitch . 
  wait and see . 
  from a previous post : living things have barriers that separates them from the rest of the world . 
  a living thing controls its barrier letting in nutrients , for instance , and pushing out waste matter . 
  if the living thing ca n't control its barrier ( or if it is broken ) it will die because too much ( or poisonous ) nutrients get in or because vital material gets out . 
  countries - or a union of countries - are living things and must have control of their borders or ` die ' . 
  they must control how many and which type of immigrants/refugees to let in . 
  too many ( or the wrong type ) will cause ` indigestion ' , ` serious illness ' and probably ` death ' . 
  europe currently does n't have control of its borders . 
  anyone can come in and there is ( and there will be in the foreseeable future ) an unlimited amount of immigrants/refugees . 
  europe ca n't control what happens in afghanistan , iraq , libya , syria , nigeria , sudan , eritrea ... ( i am all for trying - un , humanitarian help , advice - but do n't hold your breath ) but it can control its borders . 
  europe can do what australia does : divert immigrants/refugees to a safe place and then select ( in numbers that wo n't cause ` indigestion ' ) those that can be better integrated in our societies . 
  we must realize that what we have in europe is unique : democracy , freedom of speech , gender equality , secularism ... 
  unfortunately it is not irreversible and we can lose what many generations paid in blood and suffering to get . 
  now that we are all ` on the same page ' ( or willing to be ) it would be a pity if we committed cultural suicide . 
  ______________________________ my post in [ ( ( serious discussion ) ) on september 23rd eu leaders will meet for the migrant summit.what changes do you want to see ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lpq5u/serious_discussion_on_september_23rd_eu_leaders/ ) : - immigrant/refugee camps out of europe ( rent , fund whatever ) . 
  - all immigrants/refugees arriving in europe without permission must be moved to above camps ( with plenty of media coverage ) . 
  something similar to what australia is doing . 
  - select , from above immigrant/refugee camps ( in sustainable numbers ) those that can be better integrated in our societies . 
  - common european immigrant/refugee rules and procedures ( processing requests , rejections , etc ) . 
  - common european border protection and immigrant/refugee deportation . 
  european countries should send rejected immigrants/refugees to the ` european deportation service ' . 
  it would have been much easier ( and cheaper ) to stop them coming ... 
   sending everybody who comes on their own initiative back to turkey . 
  who ? 
  european politicians ? 
  rofl ( rolling on floor laughing ! ), 
  so each country has to deal with its own deportations ? 
  what 's the use of the eu then ? 
  we need a common eu deportation scheme . 
   there 's no stopping a group of a thousand people without getting your hands dirty .
