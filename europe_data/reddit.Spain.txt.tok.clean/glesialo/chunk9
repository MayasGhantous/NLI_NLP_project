  check this post to see ` radicalisation ' : [ undercover mosque '' episode ( from channel 4 series dispatches ) ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3pibpc/undercover_mosque_episode_from_channel_4_series/ ) [ video ] ( https://vimeo.com/19598947 ), 
  we ( europeans ) are weak and they know it . 
  ideology is the new religion . 
  agreed !, 
  except for ` british food is frequently really good ' . 
  i am pro-eu but the ongoing immigrant/refugee fuck-up is so bad that i now expect a brexit . 
  who , in his sane mind , would want to belong to such a dysfunctional club ? 
  demographic density in europe is just right . 
  we should stabilize it . 
  the rest of the world should strive to reach the same density as us . 
  good for environment protection , climate change ... 
  do n't forget spanish ceuta & melilla . 
  let 's cut the gordian knot : do n't import muslims into europe !, 
  hope you are right ... 
  soon !, 
  family . 
  you only need to travel to realize it . 
  the more the merrier !, 
   [ varoufakis has said in the past that he plans to establish a new political movement for greece and the whole of europe ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/10/08/varoufakis-video-hints-at-creation-of-new-political-movement-in-greece/ ) googled it . 
  when is hungary 's orban going to start a ` political movement for the whole of europe ' ? 
   eu ministers agree , saying that frontex needs a dedicated ` return office ' so that it can `` scale up its support to member states in order , inter alia , to facilitate , organise and fund return operations . '' it is something so obvious that only mind-boggling idiocy can explain why it has not been done years ago . 
  google translate { danish muslims reject islam must not be adapted western societies christianity had with martin luther 's reformation in the 1500s , it is soon time for a reformation of islam ?!, 
  no , says the majority of danish muslims in a poll conducted by wilke jyllands-posten . 
  also read : khader will prevent citizenship to contentious man more precisely , 52.4 percent denies that there is a need for a reformation or modernization of islam , islam adapt to western society . 
  among other things , the current conservative mp naser khader , who has called for a reformation . 
  also read : hidden camera : doctors checking immigrant girls ' virginity khader : islam needs an overhaul khader had hoped for more support . 
  he points out that luther challenged the priests ' monopoly on interpreting religion . 
  the same should happen with imams power , just as one must recognize a separation of religion and politics , he points out . 
  - islam is in crisis and in need of self-criticism and a thorough servicing , says naser khader told the newspaper . 
  muslims modernize islam from within sherin khankan behind denmark 's first mosque with female imams and has challenged the common perception of gender roles in islam . 
  she is more optimistic . 
  she jointly by the fact that more than one third in the survey - 35.7 percent - want modernization . 
  and religion sociologist brian arly jacobsen from the university of copenhagen also points out to the newspaper that danish muslims practice is in the process of modernizing islam . 
  for example , on gender equality - more muslim women have high education and to participate in public debate . 
  and sherin khankan mosque has a female imam , for example , made the first marriage . 
  you can not change the koran imam fatih alev from danish islamic centre rejects all talk of a reformation . 
  the same oussama el-saadi , spokesman for the controversial grimh\u00f8jmosk\u00e9 in aarhus . 
  - you can not change what is in the qur ` an and the prophet has told us that we need to do . 
  then you are not a muslim more , he says to jyllands-posten . }, 
   and obviously all religious people are stupid you must be one of them . 
  religion and ideologies will be the death of europe . 
  you are also allowed to be stupid , but it does n't mean it is a good thing . 
  i hope merkel watches this . 
  behold the new europeans . 
  then it is a failed democracy . 
  in a democracy ? 
  separated by gender .

  i am ashamed !,

  what a disappointment !, 
  from a previous post : the only way to stop the , ever increasing , wave of immigrants/refugees is to move them to external camps with plenty of media coverage . 
  they 'll soon learn that it is not worth the risk , money , etc. . . to come illegally in europe because they 'll always end in an external camp . 
  that was plain speaking about the ` refugees ' . 
  hope nothing has been lost in translation for merkel .

  another expensive ferry service ? 
  i have commented elsewhere that we need an ` european deportation service ' . 
  what does the woman say ? 
  more common sense to be ignored . 
  they took their time !, 
  they should have read / r/europe 's comments . 
  it will be impossible to get rid of all that are already here ( deportation is a joke in europe ) . 
  i hope that the troubles ahead ( caused by the ` deported ' among us ) will act as a kind of vaccine against further waves of immigrants/refugees . 
  from an earlier post : europe ca n't control what happens in afghanistan , iraq , libya , syria , nigeria , sudan , eritrea ... ( i am all for trying - un , humanitarian help , advice - but do n't hold your breath ) but it can control its borders . 
  europe can do what australia does : divert immigrants/refugees to a safe place and then select ( in numbers that wo n't cause ` indigestion ' ) those that can be better integrated in our societies . 
  we must realize that what we have in europe is unique : democracy , freedom of speech , gender equality , secularism ... 
  unfortunately it is not irreversible and we can lose what many generations paid in blood and suffering to get . 
  now that we are all ` on the same page ' ( or willing to be ) it would be a pity if we committed cultural suicide .

  deportation in europe is a joke . 
   she never said , that everyone was welcome someone should tell the immigrants/refugees , they are still chanting `` germany , germany ! '', 
  [ angela merkel comforts sobbing refugee but says germany ca n't help everyone ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/16/angela-merkel-comforts-teenage-palestinian-asylum-seeker-germany ),

  we need an ` european deportation service ' . 
  not eastern european but , please guys , tell him to fuck off !, 
  expensive ferry service . 
  rejected and left to wander at will in europe ( with some social benefits , probably ) because there is not an european deportation scheme .

  the penny dropped ? 
  retards !, 
   makes you wander hence brexit ;-), 
   deal with this not dealing with it but moving the problem somewhere else . 
  somebody , please , wake him up . 
  is he a taliban ? 
  politicians have no shame . 
   and what 's more , this moral position is impopular - in the words of the civil service of yes , minister , it is courageous . 
  stupid ideas/actions are usually unpopular . 
  find the fallacy : unpopular = = courageous stupid = = unpopular stupid = = courageous . 
  let me guess ... mobilize the italian navy to ferry them faster from lybia ... 
  it would be ` ethnic cleansing ' :  ethnic cleansing is the systematic forced removal of ethnic or religious groups ( europeans ) from a given territory by a more powerful ethnic group ( muslim non-europeans ) . 
  have my downvote .
