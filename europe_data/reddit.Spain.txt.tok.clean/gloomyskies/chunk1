just the tip . 
  they did n't include catalan in the video :(, 
  what about the [ true anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfygsaf-xyc ) ? 
  [ els segadors ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg9lnsqnhck ) for catalonia , with [ a translation of the lyrics ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/els_segadors ) [ la muixeranga ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2xvc3q9a-y ) for valencia and the catalan countries, 
  haha i have exactly the same doubts , i 'll probably end up pulling an all-nighter and do some work in the meantime , i have class at 3pm so i can sleep a little bit . 
  yes , although it 's highly unlikely at this point , but at least the catalans have a good chance right now . 
  it 's funny when americans say this ( i 'm assuming you 're american ) , because if you asked the british in 1776 , i 'm pretty sure that the majority of them were agaisnt american independence . 
  catalans are a majority in their own territory , and they should be the ones who rule it , even if there is a law somewhere else that says they ca n't decide on their own political future . 
  but that 's the thing , the uk government was willing to talk about it from a democratic point of view . 
  the spanish government simply does n't want to hear about it , and it 's coming to a point where people in catalonia are saying : we do n't need madrid 's aproval to do what we want . 
  and a vast majority of the spanish population is against the referendum . 
  it 's only a problem if they want it to be . 
  it 's not that hard to change the constitution , but the spanish government has absolutely no interest in allowing us to vote . 
  yeah , but the highest point is like 2600 m nevertheless . 
  caledonia is the latin name of scotland . 
  uni\u00f3 had 13 of ciu 's 50 seats in the parliament . 
  now they 've got 62 . 
  at least 1/3 of their members are pro-independence for sure . 
  their leader voted yes to independence on last year 's unofficial referendum . 
  it depends on what you 're planning to vote ... ( jk ) really though , i do n't know the voting requisites for foreigners here , so i 'm not qualified to answer that . 
  i think you can only vote if you 're a citizen or you have some form of permament residence . 
  i would say yes to your question , but i do n't know the official procedure . 
  if you want to count votes , let us do a referendum . 
  these were plebiscitary elections , so we 've won . 
  total votes minus spoilt and blank ones . 
  find the live count of results here : http://resultats.parlament2015.cat/09au/dau09999cm_l4.htm ( english source ), 
  first results coming in , it looks like we won , 
  no , that 's generalizing . 
  if a majority of citizens want independence , they get it . 
  all other % 's are arbitrary ( 55 % ? 
  this has nothing to do with minority rights . 
  and we are a minority in spain , right now . 
  51 % votes is not bullshit , it 's how democracy works . 
  but we 'll see how this all turns out after the results come in . 
  the official website has an english version : http://resultats.parlament2015.cat/ini09v_l2.htm ( on the top right ) . 
  voting stops at 20:00 , and then counting begins , so we can expect results after 20:30 or so . 
  at around 22:00 we can be pretty sure of the results , since most votes ( around 80-90 % ) will probably have been counted by then . 
  but official results ( including vote by mail ones ) will not be published until october 4th , i believe . 
  perhaps mas is ` using ' this to get elected again . 
  i do n't know . 
  but i 've said it before : if the price for independence is having mas elected again , so be it . 
  i do n't care as long as we get our own state , we 'll kick him out after becoming independent . 
  but i 'm very tired of people painting this as the pipe dream of some deluded politicians . 
  the president of catalonia did n't even advocate for independence until a few years ago , after several million-plus demonstrations in barcelona . 
  it 's a process driven by thousands , millions of catalans , not by some politicians that somehow managed to deceive half a country . 
  well , the bot did remind me , after all !!, 
  hahaha , just got the message . 
  the ` secession bullshit ' is not a matter of ` some politicians ' , as spanish media like to paint . 
  have you seen the demonstrations that are held each september 11 in barcelona ? 
  anyway , we 'll talk after the results are published tonight . 
  the voting ends at 20:00 , so around 22:00 we will have more or less definitive results . 
  you can follow them here : http://resultats.parlament2015.cat/ini09v_l2.htm ( it 's in english as well ) . 
  it 's one of the proposals , but there 's just not enough evidence to strongly assert basque 's relationship to any other language , since we do n't have written records that are old enough , and it 's the only surviving language of its family . 
  in this case , they use a borrowing from arabic : alla . 
  interestingly , malta is probably the most catholic country in the eu . 
  if you ever feel alone , just think about basque for a moment :p, 
  yup , those too are indeed related , see my post in the romance section . 
  whoops , somehow i managed to include moksha and bashkir but forgot about basque :p thank you very much !, 
  wow , your views are extremely different from a lot of french redditors that i 've met in this subreddit . 
  thanks . 
  ok , all those are fair , but * catalonia * ?? 
  never !, 
  * burn *, 
  i know , sorry :p, 
  since the etymology is missing , i 'll provide it for some of the most common groups . 
  - romance languages stem from latin * deus * , from proto-italic ** deiwos * , from proto-indo-european ( pie ) ** deyw\u00f3s * , a variant of ** dy\u00e9w * ( sky , heaven ) . 
  compare latin * dies * ( day , although the english word day comes from a different pie ** d\u02b0eg\u02b7\u02b0 * ) , which also stems from the same root . 
  proto-baltic ** deiwas * and proto-celtic ** d\u0113wos * also come from the same word . 
  it is interesting to note that the name jupiter also comes from this root : jupiter < ** djous pat\u0113r * from pie ** dy\u0113us ph \u2082 ter * , aka ` father god ' . 
  the greek name zeus also comes from this root . 
  - germanic languages stem from proto-germanic ** gud\u0105 * , from pie ** \u01f5\u02b0uto * ( invoked one ) , from either pie ** \u01f5\u02b0ew - * ( pour , libate ) or ** \u01f5\u02b0aw - * ( call/invoke ) . 
  note that the word * good * comes from a different root ( proto-germanic ** g\u014ddaz * , from pie ** g\u02b0ed - * ( to unite , to be associated with , to suit ) . 
  - slavic languages stem from proto-slavic ** bog\u044a * , an adjective meaning `` earthly wealth/well-being , fortune '' which was shifted to `` dispenser of wealth/fortune '' and then simply `` god '' . 
  it 's not clear where this term comes from , some suggest an early indo-iranian borrowing ( compare old persian ** baga * , god , or sanskrit * bhaga * , dispenser ) ; others suggest a derivation from pie ** b\u02b0eh \u2082 gos * , from ** b\u02b0eh \u2082 g - * ( to distribute , divide ) . 
  - greek the\u00f3s comes from pie ** d\u02b0\u00e9h \u2081 s * , from ** d\u02b0eh \u2081 - * ( to do , to put , to place ) . 
  this root also gave birht to latin * f\u0113riae * ( festival days ) and * f\u0113stus * ( adj. , festive ) , but it 's not related to * deus * . 
  - armenian \u0531\u057d\u057f\u057e\u0561\u056e ( astvats ) comes from old armenian * astuats * , of disputed origin . 
  perhaps pie *** h \u2082 \u00e9nsus * ( spirit ) , from which germanic ** ansuz *  english * os ( oscar , osborne , oswald ) and norse * \u00e1s ( a god of the \u00c6sir , the norse gods ) . 
  - finnic languages jumal , jumala , jumo come from proto-finnic ** jumala * ( god ) , of disputed origin . 
  sami * ipmil * has most likely the same root , although it 's coloured differently . 
  - hungarian * isten * has a disupted origin as well , with some linking it to an old persian term , but this is dubious . 
  - turkish * tanr\u0131 * comes from proto-turkic ** te\u014bri * ( god , sky , heaven ) . 
  note the contemporaneous religion tengriism that it is still practised by turkic and mongolian peoples in eurasia . 
  - arabic * all\u0101h * < * al + \u02beilah * and hebrew * elohim * < * el * ultimately derive from proto-semitic ** \u02beil * . 
  this is reflected in parts of lots of biblical names , such as daniel , ezekiel , gabriel , israel , michael , elizabeth , ishmael , raphael , and also babylon ( gate of god ) and babel ( same meaning ) - kazakh , bashkir and tatar * quday/khoday * come from persian * xoda * ( god ) , from middle iranian * xvatay * ( lord ) , with cognates in sanskrit * sv\u00e1dh\u0101 * , kurdish * xw\u00e2 * and pashto * xwd\u0101y * . 
  - georgian \u10e6\u10db\u10d4\u10e0\u10d7\u10d8 ( ghmert ` i ) comes from old georgian * \u0263merti * , from proto-kartvelian * * \u0263amort - * ( god ) . 
  - the blue spot in russia ( * shkay * ) i believe it 's moksha , an uralic language related to the erzya language spoken eastwards . 
  - the green spot in russia is komi * en/yen * , the spirit of good that took the form of a swan . 
  - the violet spot in russia is udmurt * inmar * ( sky god ) , the same as finnic * jumala * . 
  have a look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sky_deity this stuff is fascinating , there 's so much history and culture packed into these little words . 
  * yen , it 's cyrillic . 
  millions of catalans are disconnectd from reality ? 
  that 's quite insulting , i believe . 
  perhaps you should ask the uk or turkey to rule you again , if you find your independence ` disconnected from reality ' as well . 
   the only reason they wa n't to go is because they are giving money to spain . 
  do you really believe that ? 
  of course you know more about this than half of the catalans . 
  they are not municipal elections , those were held in may . 
  they 're elections to the parliament of catalonia . 
  i dont ' care about the spanish constitution , we want out , have n't you noticed ?
