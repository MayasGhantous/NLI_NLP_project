  they wo n't be able to pass any laws , it 's not gon na happen even with the support of c 's . 
  more than it already is ? 
  hahaha mare meua . 
  bummer for bildu then . 
  and geroa bai disappeared as well . 
  but germany does n't use the d'hondt law , it depends on how you distribute the seats and there are lots of different methods . 
  the d'hondt law favours the big parties and the small regional ones . 
  it 's in the constitution , he has to propose someone for the prime minister position and also call for new elections if they ca n't manage to choose a pm . 
  hardly ` symbolic ' . 
  already subscribed hahaha, 
  what happened to bildu ? 
  did all their votes go to podemos ? 
  it 's not wishful thinking , they need that support to get an absolute majority . 
  it 's math , not wishful thinking . 
  do you really think the pp can get an absolute majority right now ? 
  is that wishful thinking or am i crazy ? 
  i see , sorry about that . 
  it 's the problem of the d'hondt system . 
  it does n't mean that they need more votes , but for example , imagine that iu gets 4 % votes in all provinces : it will get 100 's of thousands of votes , but only a few mps ; while , for example , erc will get less votes , but concentrated on a few provinces , so they wil get more mps . 
  that 's what people like to say , but it 's not 100 % true . 
  nice username . 
  they 've done it before . 
  the pnv is the opposite of centrist . 
  edit : i misunderstood op . 
  it 's not gerrymandering , some parties are confined to specific locations ( catalonia , basque country ) and others run nation-wide , so obviously they need more votes on average to get a seat . 
  because they are adding several ` podemos-like ' groups like comprom\u00eds-podemos ( valencian nationalists ) , en com\u00fa-podem ( catalan ) or even en marea ( galician ), 
  none of them have enough mps , they all need the support of the independentists or new elections in 2 months . 
  ah yes , those unkwnown badlands between val\u00e8ncia and castille where no man dares to tread . 
  you guys ca n't catch a break , can you ? 
  watch this if you have n't https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-jlz5frt88, 
  t\u00fdr sings in faroese though . 
  who needs vowels ( or allophones ! ), 
  when you have a pharyngealized labialized ejective uvular plosive in your language ? 
  ubykh is particularly interesting because it had one of the largest recorded [ phonetic inventories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ubykh_phonology ) of all languages . 
  most northwest caucasian languages display very large consonant inventories , but ubykh was the crown jewel of them all in this regard . 
  is that just an opinion , or do you have reasons to claim that ? 
  i have a msc in climate science btw . 
  is [ this ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=co2+concenctration+graph&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cacq_auoawovchmissue4dk8yaivhsquch1y_qwq#safe=off&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=co2+concentration+graph ) a myth as well ? 
  thanks , i was n't sure about this one . 
  nice username !, 
  it 's ipa ( international phonetic alphabet ) , very useful to describe sounds in languages . 
  here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_phonetic_alphabet there 's a good description of it . 
  the ` small w ' represents a feature called [ labialization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/labialization ) , which means that the consonant ( in this case , a / k / ) is pronounced like a normal k , only with the lips in a rounded shape ( the shape you would have them if you read the french vowel ou ) . 
  you can listen to the sound [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiceless_velar_stop ) . 
  the symbol * means that it 's a reconstructed word ( we do not have direct evidence for it ) . 
  the symbol / \u013a\u0325 / has two features : it 's a normal l with a circle underneath ( which represents voicelessness ) and an accent on top , which can signify various things , i 'm not sure on this one cause it 's not a standard ipa diacritic , maybe it signifies palatalization , but then it probably belongs to the next k , because the proto-indo-european consonant / * \u1e31 / is well attested . 
  you can read up more on those terms on wikipedia , it 's very interesting !, 
  ( i would explain but i do n't have time now , sorry :p ), 
  very interesting . 
  i wonder where the mapmapker got that from then . 
  what is your source ? 
  ( not questioning it , just interested ) . 
  those words stem from the same proto-indo-european root , they are not derived from each other . 
  look at my other reply to op . 
  * loup * comes from latin * lupus * , from proto-italic ** luk\u02b7os * , a metathesis ( consonant switch ) of proto-indo-european ( pie ) ** w\u013a\u0325k\u02b7os * ( basically , w\u013a\u0325 switched to lw -  lu ) . 
  this is a fairly common process in language change . 
  * wolf * comes from proto-germanic ** wulfaz * , directly from pie ** w\u013a\u0325k\u02b7os * . 
  note that in proto-italic , ** k\u02b7 * changed to ** p * , but in proto-germanic it changed to ** f * . 
  the difference is not that big : from a labiovelar stop , it switched to a bilabial stop in latin and a bilabial ( later labiodental ) fricative in germanic . 
  what 's wrong with it ? 
  persian is an indo-european language though , same as english . 
  send it to the * constitucional * !!, 
  well , it would be the basques , of course , since we share a common situation right now and we always respect and support each other . 
  you can count on us !!, 
  ^ plz ^ send ^ help ^ soon, 
  wiiiiiiiiii :d, 
  you got me there for a second man , you 're lucky that i 'm not so quick anymore with my downvote-trigger . 
  oh sorry : `` those durn separatists , muh one-big-and-free ( sounds like an extra free big hamburger that you get at mcd 's ) '', 
  but ... 
  but ... 
  i though you guys liked us :'( :'(, 
  it 's not a ` true scotsman ' rhetoric , it 's statistics . 
  it is true that native catalan speakers are 60-70 % in favour of independence , while those who are immigrants or descendents of immigrants from spain or another country are less in favour , aorund 30-40 % . 
  it might be confusing because the latin term gallia has most likely a different origin , through a celtic name . 
  the * etymological dictionary of proto-celtic * gives ** galn - * ( to be able to ) as a possible root . 
  the term * gaul * ca n't be derived from latin * gallia * because it would have evolved as * gallia *  * jaille * , which can today be found in several toponyms such as * saint-mars-la-jaille * . 
  yup , proto-germanic ** walhaz * became frankish ( old franconian ) ** walha * which turned into old french * waulle * and then * gaulle * . 
  the old french switch from / v / , / w / to / g / is well attested , appearing in terms such as latin * vespa *  french * gu\u00eape * ( wasp ) , or lat . 
  * gui * ( mistletoe ) , although the same change happened with germanic pairs in french : * guerre * and * war * , or * garder * and * ward * . 
  this was due to the large germanic influence on french during its early period , that the other romance languages did not experience . 
  sorry , i 'm not aware of any political connotations that name may have , i just wrote what i thought was the most common name in english . 
  yup , do n't pay attention to german pronunciation of those letters !, 
  you can hear it pronounced here : https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/w%c5%82ochy, 
  it 's indeed a hungarian-speaking region , [ sz\u00e9kely land . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sz%c3%a9kely_land ), 
  and w\u0142ochy comes from proto-germanic word * walhaz , meaning ` foreigner ' . 
  derived terms include wales , cornwall , gaul , wallonia and wallachia . 
  nope , w is / v / and \u0142 is / w / . 
  in austria at least , there 's always petrol stations and such that are open 24/7 , although they only sell basic stuff . 
  and when i went there i found out that they have n't even excavated half of the roman city yet !, 
  it 's quite amazing . 
  how come the ruins of emp\u00faries are not a world heritage site ? 
  there 's marmite in several supermarkets here . 
  i do n't know who buys it , but that 's another story . 
  i think polls closed less than an hour ago but nothing is coming in yet : /, 
  imagine what a country ruled by podemos would be like !, 
  a country that does n't promote bullfighting as the highest expression of culture , a country that recognizes the plurinationality of spain , a country whose prime interest is not making the bankers happy !, 
  * shudders * * disclaimer : i am not one of their voters . 
  in fact several british meps have used languages other than english without any problems . 
  as long as there 's a translator and political will , everything 's alright .
