  no knowing the language of a small tribe in the mountains of papua-new guinea is not the same as not knowing a european language spoken by milions right next to you . 
  i 'm not angry , i just think that there is no reason why catalan should not be included in the map , that 's all , even going by his list of requisites . 
  it takes some will to say : catalan is the only official language of a country , * but it 's small so it does n't count * ; catalan is spoken by milions in spain , * but it 's not official at the state level so it does n't count * . 
  we fulfil the requirements , but it 's not included because somehow it 's a regional language following this reasoning : - where it 's official , the number of speakers is low . 
  - where the number of speakers is high , it 's only ` official ' ( at the regional level ) . 
  what does it take then , to stop being a ` regional ' language ? 
  independence has nothing to do with the language . 
  it 's not independentist to want you language to be recognised . 
  yeah i would n't have had any problems if he had included sami as well , but i just do n't believe calling catalan a ` regional ' language and dismissing it just like that is very fair . 
  to me this is what happens when there 's not a strong state backing the language , whether it 's an independent catalan state or a spanish state that recognises the officiality of its languages . 
  and then there 's andorra who has also gotten dismissed . 
  i think it 's an anomaly that we have to remind people that there 's millions of catalan speakers ( and galician , and basque ) . 
  that 's not wanting to be special , that 's the opposite , wanting to be * normal * . 
  a dutch person does not need to remind people that their language exists . 
  catalan orthography is completely standardised , it has more speakers than many other european languages , and it 's the only official language in one european state . 
  dismissing it as ` regional ' is not a very clever move in my opinion . 
  i 'm not bitching , i 'm saying that there 's no reason why catalan needs to be excluded . 
  even if spain made it illegal it would still be the language of andorra and so it has the right to be in this map . 
  do n't you think it 's a bit anomalous that we have to defend the very existence of our language constantly ? 
  and you calling it a ` dialect ' does not contribute to the conversation in any way . 
  ` y ' as a letter does not exist on its own , only with ` ny ' . 
  i guess i 'll edit the post to make it clearer . 
  it is the largest language in a european state without state-wide officiality . 
  and it 's the only official language in andorra , yet i do n't see that in the map either . 
  the dot \u00b7 is a character . 
  spanish = castilian when we speak in english . 
  no one uses ` spanish ' when they mean catalan . 
  basque is not ` spanish ' the same way it 's not ` french ' , unless you 're talking about the territories where it 's spoken . 
  if you wan na troll , try harder than that . 
  typical spain = spanish post . 
  for catalan there 's \u00e0 , \u00e9 , \u00e8 , \u00ed , \u00f3 , \u00f2 , \u00fa , \u00e7 , l \u00b7 l , \u00fc , \u00ef , and i guess [ k , w , y ( except for ` ny ' ) ] . 
  i 'm not sure about galician and basque , i think basque has no accents but the northern dialects have \u00fc . i do n't know if the guy that makes these maps reads this but just because a language is not official at the state level because of political reasons you ca n't ignore it , especially in spain with more than 15 million non-spanish languages speakers . 
  and catalan is the only official language of andorra , for those saying ` we only care about official languages ' . 
  and for those saying ` the map does n't show micro-states ' , malta is depicted . 
  andorra is bigger than malta . 
  ` even a broken clock is right twice a day . ', 
  it 's close , this is on the waterfront , and it 's a maybe 10 min walk to the base of the castle . 
  yeah , catalan is closest to occitan , then italian , then spanish and then french , even though it 's genetically closer to french than to spanish . 
  spanish being an iberian-romance language , it 's closer to galician , portuguese , etc. 
  than it is to other romance languages . 
  if you look at the dialectal continuum instead of the standard languages , you 'll find that catalan , southeastern france occitan and northwestern italy languages like piedmontese are very close together lexically . 
  example : piedmontese * pom * , catalan * poma * ( apple ) , p. * surt\u00ec * , c. * sortir * ( to exit ) , p. * cadrega * , c. * cadira * ( chair ) . 
  yeah i 'd really like to see the sources on this , several relations are a bit dubious . 
  i 'm wondering if the placement is more or less arbitrary . 
  for example the closest language to catalan is occitan , but that 's not even depicted . 
  it 's also closer to french than to romanian but that link is not depicted either ? 
  and i 'm sure italian is closer to romanian as well . 
  i 've eaten them a few times , in things like sweet and salty trail mix and such . 
  but i do n't think you could buy them on their own , at least here . 
  well i 'm sure you can find it on lots of other places but this one is particularly famous . 
  i did n't inted to claim they were right-wing parties , i 've edited my op now . 
  but their economic policies are at most centre . 
  they favour corporations , austerity , rescuing banks , cutting social expenditure ( even if ` they wish they did n't have to ' ) , etc. 
  there are other left-wing parties that do n't want to end capitalism and yet are not neo-liberal in their policies . 
  the big social nets that we have in western europe are mainly a consequence of strong labour governments a few decades ago ; those parties are not the same nowadays . 
  also that 50 % is for any income above 38k $ , not all income is taxed at 50 % . 
  and high taxes ! = left wing , especially far left . 
  high taxes to the rich , yeah , sure . 
  i was just talking about the drift of traditional social-democratic parties lately and the abandonment of giving priority to the workers and instead giving it to banks and corporations . 
  it 's not far-left at all . 
  all european ` socialist ' parties renounced socialism a long time ago ; for example , in spain , psoe formally renounced socialism in 1979 . 
  now they 're socially progressive , economically neo-liberal parties for the most part . 
  you can also see it in [ alacant ] ( http://www.alicanteturismo.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/explanada.png ) . 
  raisins perhaps ? 
  look at yourself , using the plural form of lentil and everything !, 
  green parties are usually more left-wing than social democrats , but not all of the are socialist . 
  and as far as i know there 's a few conservative green parties in europe ( iceland comes to mind ) . 
  traditional social-democratic parties nowadays all have neo-liberal economic policies , thus placing them in the right side of the spectrum ( edit : economically ) , even if they are socially progressive ( you can call them ` centre ' , if that means anything ) . 
   their inhabitants do n't deserve the spanish nationality of course you know best and you know who deserves to be spanish ( as if that was some sort of great benefit ) and who does n't . 
  do catalans deserve it , or how is it ? 
  98-99 % of gibraltar 's citizens do n't want to be spanish , even if that 's hard to believe for someone like you . 
  yeah surely [ american interventionism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_policy_of_the_united_states#covert_actions ) has helped people all around [ the globe !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_involvement_in_regime_change ), 
  it 's not a shift in the mood . 
  this subreddit has literally been taken over by american alt-right accounts . 
  it 's always the same , i start reading the comments , i see a user making outrageously far-right comments with lots of upvotes , i check his post history -  poster at the donald , and other sexist , racist and homophobic places . 
  why the mods do n't do anything about this , i do n't know . 
  it 's totally free here . 
  what do you mean by town ? 
  grad ? 
  you 've translated * grad * as town , but * grad * usually means city . 
  there 's tonnes of towns around europe with less than 20 inhabitants . 
  are films dubbed in turkish cinemas ? 
  portugal is not that bad , i think it 's because it 's a smaller country and they do n't dub everything . 
  and i bet if you ask romanian uni students , they 'll have a better english level than uni students in barcelona , for example . 
  ` the laws apply to everyone equally ' . 
  except for * aforados * , the monarchy , etc , etc. 
  what if the flags are the same ? 
  the op also posted a kid with a scottish flag . 
  how is that indoctrination ? 
  spain does n't care about kosovo , it does n't recognise it because of catalonia and the basque country . 
  it 's the country they live in , what flag are they supposed to have ? 
  if a kid waves a serbian flag in serbia that would not be considered ` manipulative ' . 
  but that 's the line of free speech . 
  ridiculing religion -  free speech . 
  saying ` practitioners of x religion should all be killed ' -  not free speech . 
  and i agree with that completely . 
  i 'm just saying that helping men does n't have to mean helping women less . 
  a true feminist will not deny social issues that affect men as well , but they will also not deny the historical oppression that has been mainly one-sided . 
  it 's not about getting ` offended ' or ` triggered ' , it 's about deciding whether things like advocating for genocide should be legal or not .
