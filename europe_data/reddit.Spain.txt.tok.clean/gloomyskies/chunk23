  why would you be impressed by that ? 
  it 's like saying i 'm very impressed about the efficiency with which the nazis killed people in their death camps . 
  i guess we have really different points of view but i ca n't really comprehend yours . 
  and scotland 's independence movement is not driven by language at all seeing how 98 % of them speak english or scots . 
  lots of people that have spanish as their first language here are also pro-independence . 
  why are you guys so hell-bent on occitan being dead ? 
  are you proud of that ? 
  i 'm not saying that it 's spoken by everyone in occitania but why do you need to pretend it does n't exist ? 
  i have spoken to young people from toulouse in catalan and they replied back in occitan to me , but i guess that was all my imagination and theirs as well . 
  these maps provide interesting historical information about how to say merry christmas in different european languages , but i guess occitan had the bad luck of being spoken in a state that needs to exterminate even the last remnants of it . 
  you know that 's not a valid answer to what i said . 
  oh no , someone included occitan in a map again !!, 
  quick , let 's reassure everyone that it 's a completely dead language that should n't even exist or be in a map !, 
  when you have to resort to words like that ( including blatant sexism ) , we 're done with this argument . 
  have a good day . 
  a bit of a circular argument , do n't you think ? 
  you want me to show you examples of governmental support to the catalan process , i show it to you and you quickly dismiss it because it turns out that all of those people are deluded ? 
  i think to be catalan you have to identify yourself as one , first of all . 
  there 's some people that have been living all their lives in catalonia and they feel ` only spanish ' , according to polls . 
  of course legally i guess you have to be registered there as well . 
  please have a read at this and educate yourself . 
  not all european countries are hegemonical centralists like spain and france . 
  fuck you and fuck your homophobia . 
  so it would be alright if all the other countries in the european union decided to vote together and ban spanish in the european parliament ? 
  minorities have to be protected in a democracy . 
  and why should anyone outside catalonia ( except catalans living abroad ) vote in a matter that only concerns catalonia , such as independence ? 
  the idea itself is preposterous . 
  is it the spanish government 's job to ensure that the scots do n't get what they want then ? 
  spain surely jumps to tell everybody not to get involved with the catalan issue even though lots of european countries have raised their concern or even expressed support for the cause . 
  spain 's not forced to do anything , they 're just being dicks and sending messages/warnings to catalonia . 
  how profoundly undemocratic it is not only to act against the will of the catalans , but now also of the scots . 
  you speak as if your mouth was full of bakailao though !, 
  ( pls do n't hurt me ) . 
  i know it 's not the same , i was just pointing out that it 's interesting we have a similar word . 
  a coca does n't have to be a cake though , it can also be something like a pizza without cheese . 
  denmark 's soil literally comes from stuff that was ... evacuated from norway . 
  it 's fun because here * coca de xocolate * would mean something slightly different , although also a type of pastry but a cake as well . 
  do you really believe everything that you 've written or did you write it just for the lulz ? 
  i only have him at -20 , but i think sometimes res does n't account for some downvotes , or else it should be at -100 ... 
  and i 'm from val\u00e8ncia !, 
  well yeah , but all i 'm saying is it did n't come from nowhere , some parliaments had already been working on it . 
  it did n't go from 0 to 100 , we had same-sex unions in catalonia ( 1998 ) , and the balearics and valencian country ( 2001 ) , for example . 
  i know these referendums , it 'll be something like , ` do you want to protect families and marriage or not ' ? 
  as someone else already said , it seems that catholicism had a bigger influence over there , perhaps not very different from galicia . 
  what are you doing portugal !? 
  you still get the odd stare though . 
  the thing is that while some people may ` disapprove ' , they will usually not do/say anything about it . 
  however i do n't know anyone who has been attacked/has had an encounter worse than slurs being yelled at them , but lots of kids are still bullied at school . 
  quick , let 's declare independence before no one notices !, 
  not all of us !!!, 
  i do n't think r/food is very pretentious , seeing how half the time the most upvoted post is a burger or chips or something someone bought in a county fair and the like . 
  probably a reference to [ this .

  well , i would say that supporting palestine has nothing to do with having a negative opinion of an ethnoreligious group . 
  i can have a negative opinion of the state of israel but why a negative opinion of a jewish person ? 
   which is why i find strange that 's not a 99.9 % ( 0.1 % error ) . 
  interview shyness , maybe . 
  surely they do n't have a negative opinion of themselves . 
  only about 4 % of spain 's population is muslim . 
  why would anyone in spain have a negative opinion of the jews ? 
  i bet almost no one even knows a jewish person or even has talked to one in their lives . 
  not everyone must have a negative opinion about roma people . 
  also , do you not consider them spanish citizens ? 
  duh , he clearly wants to destroy the enemy from inside . 
  how about `` hei '' ? 
   i am a donald trump supporter yes well colour me surprised . 
  i think statistically * castells * are safer than football or basketball . 
  you can always show them [ this .

  is there much difference between dialects/accents in serbia itself ? 
  i know croatia has 3 main dialects and they are quite different sometimes . 
  sorry , i slipped an extra r. corrected . 
  i see . 
  i was just wondering because i know that there 's a lot of variation on the croatian dialects but i guess it 's not that pronounced around serbia and in montenegro . 
  i know it 's the same language , but surely there are different dialects than can pose some trouble with their mutual intelligibility . 
  i was just asking if it was easy for him to understand what he heard . 
  how different is the language there ? 
  can you understand them ? 
  not catalan modernism though !, 
  :p https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modernisme, 
  oddly enough , the name comes from the french * b\u00e9ton brut * , which means raw concrete . 
  we also have [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj_ftyqfxoe ) . 
  yeah right , and they also have to show that they care about everyone in the city and not just in ` rich ' parts or whatever i guess . 
  well i ca n't find it now so perhaps it was just an opinion article . 
  the one in poblenou specially seems to have a lot of backlash . 
  have n't they abandoned the superilles idea already ? 
  i thought i read something about it a few days ago . 
  imho it sounded like a good idea but i guess the implementation was n't perfect . 
  1 country ! = 1 language . 
  futbol in catalan , stress on the last syllable . 
  i 've also seen yoghurts and stuff like that with different ` refrigerate at ' temperatures ... 
  astronomical vs meteorological summer . 
  both of them arbitrary , although arguably at least the astronomical definition has a more definite reference point . 
  this reminds me of [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5z-_bweia8 ) about the fight between the circassians and the russians when the russians were trying to conquer them . 
  this area fascinates me as there are so many different ethnicities , languages and cultures in such a relatively small region . 
  my knowledge about this topic is too shallow to have an informed opinion on this particular nuance . 
  i guess the author has a very strict definition of what ` georgian ' means , and is not including mingrelians , svans , etc in the grouping ; perhaps even adjarians and others . 
  i still think it has good information if we do n't get caught up in these definitions , i.e. 
  we do n't need to assume that imeretians are not georgians to know where they live given this map . 
  i do n't know if the author has an agenda or what the accepted consensus is in academic circles .
