  the discussion is not healthy because the ` no ' side does n't take this issue seriously , they only want to dismiss it and act like it 's not important and will never happen . 
  people have gotten tired of this attitude . 
  and ( while i may be biased ) , i do think that the most hostile side in this case is the anti-independence one . 
  the independentists have never threatened anything , other than declaring independence unilaterally . 
  and there are lots of reasons , and almost no one does it because ` fuck spain ' ; you have self-determination issues , the ability to govern ourselves , the protection of our language and culture , economic and social issues , etc. 
  it 's not just about the money . 
  a lot of people have different reasons that they consider more important , suchs as the ability to govern and represent themselves , or the protection of our culture and interests . 
  but if you want to believe that it 's only because we want more money , go ahead . 
  i do n't understand , should croatia be part of yugoslavia then ? 
  `` what really bothers me about this whole venezuela fiasco in this sub is how pro-venezuela feel that anything against venezuela 's independence is spain propaganda but the opposite is only great and should be celebrated without ever letting a proper discussion about the issue on these threads . '', 
  what a spanish might have said 200 years ago . 
  i am most surprised by the fact that a citizen of a country that declared independence from spain now feels that the can deny others the same right . 
  you ca n't really say that converg\u00e8ncia is far right . 
  what is pp then , literally hitler ? 
  we will end up needing to thank him , now he 's even providing us with free campaign material without even asking !, 
  i still do n't understand how you can be member of a party that actively fights against your rights . 
  they still tried to do it though , it was the constitutional court that stopped them . 
  it is based on linguistics . 
  there is a fundamental difference between basque and catalan and they ca n't be called dialects in any possible way . 
  catalan and occitan , however , might be able to be called dialects of a bigger occitano-romance language , but that might be stretching it a little bit . 
  usually mutual intelligibility is a key factor . 
  i do n't know about galicia , but here the parties like barcelona en com\u00fa are not openly pro-independence , but only for ` the right to decide ' . 
  i did not know the details about those galician parties though , thanks for clarifying . 
  that 's awesome !, 
  is alternativa openly pro-independence though ? 
  the ones of galicia can be around 2-3 % ( edit : might be highter actually ) , and in valencia i do n't think it 's larger than 5-10 % , maybe around that or a bit more in the balearic islands , but definitely not as serious as the catalan and basque ones . 
  catalan is spoken in catalonia , the valencian country , the balearic islands , andorra , a portion of aragon , northern catalonia ( in france ) and the city of l'alguer in sardinia . 
  so yes . 
  well , we have different opinions here . 
  languages and language diversity are a prime source and symbol of culture , and i think it 's sad that you want to see your own language eradicated . 
  catalan is more spoken than danish , norwegian , slovenian , slovakian , swedish , finnish , and a lot more languages in europe . 
  are those languages also regional ? 
  should they not be taught at schools also ? 
  do you see why we want to be an independent country , to not be treated like some ` region ' ? 
  a lot of them are kurds , so they speak kurdish . 
  there 's also assyrian and turkmen speakers . 
  the sociolinguistic situation in syria is quite complex , not everyone is arab or sunni . 
  fair enough , it could have been more detailed . 
  there are a lot of other ways this could be improved , after all , it 's not a scientific paper . 
  catalan was also left out , but it 's not implying that catalan does not exist . 
  ok , but both those statements are true . 
  it is a direct descendent of proto-balto-slavic , as well as the latter eastern baltic . 
  it 's like saying that catalan comes from latin and not from proto-italic . 
  alright , but i still do n't know what you 're trying to get at . 
  i did not say in my original post anything about when those languages developed . 
  ok , do you have a source for that ? 
  languages are n't monolithic blocks that are created from night to day , they evolve sound change after sound change . 
  both languages stem from the same proto-language ( something that i already said before , and that you repeated saying that they share a common ancestor ) , so i do n't know what you 're trying to say here . 
  yes indeed , and that would be [ proto-balto-slavic . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proto-balto-slavic_language ), 
  ok , that makes sense , although it is not a universal change , and there are instances of voiced aspirated stops turning into unvoiced stops as well . 
  but perhaps there was a similar sound shift without influence from greek , i do n't know about that . 
  i know it was n't a consonant , i was saying that in greek , the shift you described is in most of the cases a stop + * j , where the * j becomes a * t. i was asking how this is related to * dw  * dg . 
  yeah , i 've heard of that theory , initially it seems a little bit contrived , but i 've found [ this paper ] ( http://www.academia.edu/6375253/feature_metathesis_and_the_change_of_pie_du_to_classical_armenian_-rk_diachronica_2013_ ) that supports it ; it does make sense when you think of it that way , and it provides additional examples to support the theory . 
  i know that greek sound change , but how is it related to * dw  * dg ? 
  the shift in greek is triggered by a cononant + yod , in this case * pi  * pt , but * dw does not fall into this pattern . 
  there 's not a consensus between linguists as to how that sound change was produced , but it is indeed an interesting development . 
  lithuanian is a baltic language , which is a part of the larger balto-slavic familiy : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balto-slavic_languages . 
  this does not imply that it is a slavic language ; as shown in the picture , slavic developed after the baltic-slavic split . 
  however , these two families share a common proto-language and thus they are more similar between each other than say , baltic and germanic languages . 
  also , it does show that lithuanian and latvian are in fact related , since they both stem from the same proto-language . 
  it does n't make sense to use a political map to show this , instead a map with language boundaries would be way more useful , like the ones in / r/etymologymaps or [ this ones . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/interactive/2013/nov/14/pain-in-the-ananas-etymology-maps ), 
  there are more written differences in spanish ; as you said , english is quite the same , there 's only some u 's and some s/z and a few more things . 
  in spanish , you actually have differences such as different personal pronouns ( vosotros ( plural you in spain ) , vos ( in argentina ) , ustedes used differently etc. 
  ) , different verb conjugations , and lots of vocabulary that you 've never heard before , since there is n't much contact between latin american and european media , as opposed to american and british television and movies that are everywhere . 
  oh , and the ` spanish lisp ' is not a lisp , it 's the / \u03b8 / phoneme of english words such as thin , think or thread . 
  i do n't know how it got labeled as a lisp in spanish when it 's the same sound . 
  well , you 're the native speaker , so i 'm gon na trust you when you say that . 
  it 's true that when you get used to them , suddenly they 're not so hard . 
  my original point was that english had more variation in pronunciation than spanish , but now i do n't really know if that 's true at all . 
  i 'm not talking about spelling , i 'm talking about pronunciation . 
  things like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le_ungdpa4c ) or [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuejrsmrx0c ) . 
  the standard dialects in spanish may be a bit more different , but take someone from the deep south and a northern english guy and see if they can understand each other . 
  please do note that a lot of us who want independence actually dislike mas , but right now it 's our only chance , we need people from the left and the right together to do this . 
  mas is not driving the process , there are countless organizations , parties and individuals behind this . 
  the official spanish propaganda is that it 's all a plot by mas to keep the power , but this is far from the truth , and paints catalans as deluded people that have been tricked by mas into this , which is a but insulting , in my opinion . 
  please educate yourself . 
  https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/crisis_de_1640 especially : https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/crisis_de_1640#el_proyecto_de_olivares:_el_memorial_secreto_de_1624_y_la_uni.c3.b3n_de_armas and https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/crisis_de_1640#la_secesi.c3.b3n_de_portugal, 
  i mean , you can expect that from the 3-4 guys with the spanish flag that are always around , but then ... when most of the thread starts using their same arguments ... * faints * it 's funny , there were people systematically downvoting everything i had said . 
  i refresh the page and suddenly , -30 downvotes overall . 
  i think i wo n't even comment on any of these threads any more until september 28 . 
  sooooo many downvotes in this thread ... :o, 
  the independence movement in valencia is comparatively small , and moreover it 's more complicated since you have people that feel part of the catalan countries and want to become independent and join catalonia , then others want to be independent but separate from catalonia , others want a federal spanish state , etc. 
  although things could change if catalonia declares independence successfully , there is not currently a single party in the valencian parliament openly advocating for independence ; the main nationalist party ( comprom\u00eds ) is not clear about it , they support `` the right to decide '' of catalans , but they will not push for a referendum in valencia right now . 
  the independentist party ( esquerra repliblicana ) was a few thousand votes short of entering the parliament though , with its best result in history . 
  there 's also another party ( cup ) that is pro independence and pro catalan countries , and they got some representation in some towns for the first time too . 
  ultimately , it is up to the valencian people to decide . 
  a lot of politicians , both from spain and from valencia itself , like to label those who feel close to catalonia or who support the catalan countries as `` pancatalanists '' , a word which they use to insult them and create division among valencians , especially when it comes to language , since some people argue that valencian is a different language than catalan ( which does n't make any sense , from the linguistics point of view ) , and then those politicians want to come and `` save '' valencians from those pesky catalan `` imperialists '' , saying things like `` they want to steal paella from us valencians !!!!!! '' . 
  so yeah , it 's complicated . 
  i know , and we 're trying to change that . 
  it 's like telling a scot , ` most of us think of you as english ... ' of course , our case is not as known internationally , but it probably will after the next elections . 
  thanks , it 's nice to see someone with that opinion at last , reddit scares me sometimes . 
  if some of those people put themselves in our shoes maybe they would see this issue differently . 
  just substitute catalonia and spain for ireland and the uk , or norway and sweden , or any independent country in modern europe that was once part of another one . 
  portugal was also part of spain for a few decades ... go ask them if they want to come back . 
  and you would be crazy to ask for portuguese independence !!, 
  look at that radical , he wants to destroy spain !!, 
  you guys were lucky in 1640 , we were n't . 
  but it 'll change soon enough , i hope .
