  dude , i am familiar with them . 
  i know that such statements can be uncomfortable from a socio-political point of view , but scientifically speaking there 's no denying that baltic languages are the closest to slavic ones . 
  they are not positioned `` roughly the same distance in the indo-european language graph '' , they stem from the same protolanguage and had a period of common development . 
  i can link you to several papers that delve on that matter . 
  have you read the wikipedia article ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balto-slavic_languages if you read my comment again , i 'm not claiming that `` they 're as similar as castilian and catalan '' . 
  in fact , i specifically say : `` i 'm not saying they 're mutually intelligible '' . 
  they are not that close , obviously , since now they are in their own branches . 
  the fact that you bring up the alphabet is kind of a moot point . 
  serbian or bulgarian are also written in cyrillic , while croatian or czech are written with the latin alphabet . 
  does that mean that those languages are not related to each other ? 
  i 'm just stating their linguistic proximity , and that 's undeniable . 
  the situation with russians in latvia has nothing to do with the relation between baltic and slavic languages that goes way back before even latvia or russia existed as countries . 
  yes , i 'm not saying they 're mutually intelligible . 
  but they separated later on , and they share a common proto-language and some vocabulary . 
  that , combined with the historical influence that russian has had on the language , would make learning russian for a latvian easier than it would be for me , for example . 
  well , he included fermin muguruza , their singer , that 's why i did n't mention it . 
  but sarri sarri should be on that list haha . 
  latvian is a baltic language , and baltic languages are part of the balto-slavic family ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balto-slavic_languages ) . 
  i do n't know if this is what he was trying to say , but , outside other slavic languages , latvian would be the closest to russian . 
  it 's all in the punctuation . 
  there 's also : `` would n't the sentence ' i want to put a hyphen between the words fish and and and and and chips in my fish-and-chips sign ' have been clearer if quotation marks had been placed before fish , and between fish and and , and and and and , and and and and , and and and and , and and and and , and and and chips , as well as after chips ? '', 
  here 's more fun : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_linguistic_example_sentences, 
  bulgarian is the odd one here , i think it 's the only slavic language and one of the few in europe that mark evidentiality grammatically . 
  so cool !, 
  yeah , this one means , there 's an island in the stream , and there 's a stream in the island . 
  by here you mean sweden , or v\u00e4rmland ? 
  well , i was n't sure at all , i 'll trust you :p, 
  interesting , this reminds me of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/llanfairpwllgwyngyll . 
  oh , and would n't that be `` the house that is on the new mill , that is above the new red fountain '' ? 
  but that 's not fair , they are just sticking different words and surnames together !, 
  ( right . . ? 
  because saying that my basque is poor would be almost ... praising it :p ), 
  yeah , we do it a lot . 
  no su ta gar ?!, 
  it 's not about the flag , nor a ` trendy ' thing that you do as a teenager , it represents the ideal of a republic , not specifically bringing the ii republic back . 
  that 's why most people use it anyway . 
  basque is already difficult enough , we do n't need crazy long words on top of it !, 
  that reminds me of where [ this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3avcgv6tije ) was born ... 
  here you go !, 
  i love `` i \u00e5a \u00e4 e \u00f6 , \u00e5 i \u00f6a \u00e4 e \u00e5 '' , although it 's not standard , but in some dialect you would hear it like that . 
  i love how french people try to completely eliminate all languages other than french from their country . 
  i just do n't get why you guys have such a strong desire for other languages to die . 
  fj\u00f6ll meaning mountains is also not a coincidence , it comes from proto-germanic * falisaz , where german ` felsen ' comes from , too . 
  i spent a month in there back in 2008 in one of those language exchange things . 
  i lived in the most horrible house i could imagine ; the mother was at home during the day and then she got out at night dressed like a leopard ( with more skin than clothes visible ) . 
  their 8 year old daughter was awful , always screaming and running around like a caveman ( but dirtier ) . 
  they had a room only for dirty clothes , which they stored in plastic hampers only to wear them again a few days later . 
  there was no shower , only a bathtub and a jug that you could use to pour water over your head . 
  and the town was kind of nasty , with tesco being the most popular attraction , and it was full of chavs and chavettes and what have you , whose only source of amusement seemed to be the harassment of the international students , oftentimes pulling knives and threatening us . 
  fun times . 
  it refers to [ this . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/color_charge ), 
  genitive . 
  genitive . 
  yeah , we do n't even have it . 
  in fact , my grandfather ca n't pronounce it ( he uses an 's ' ) , since he was n't taught spanish when he was young . 
  i 've had this argument sooo many times , and it looks like it 's an american thing , because i 'd never heard of this ` lisp ' before an american told me . 
  it 's fun when you point out that they have the same sound , some of them get confused ... ( i guess because they 're more used to mexican accents , etc. ), 
  it is spoken though , and the map shows its historic range . 
  ours has some sort of narrative , if you group the words properly : spain catalan ( ha !, 
  ) , catalonia nation , language referendum , pretty independence , ... , really wikipedia fascist , barcelona thank . 
  why are you trying to achieve here ? 
  languages do n't have to ` make sense ' , they are used in order to communicate . 
  why does english need an auxiliary ` do ' to make a question ? 
  why does n't it have a developed subjunctive mood ? 
  well , there are historical reasons , but at the end of the day , it 's just how it works . 
  1 ) and ? 
  * bomber * means fireman in catalan , * fart * means being full/fed up , and * net * means clean . 
  2 ) some verbs have an incomplete conjugation , they 're called [ defective verbs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/defective_verb ) . 
  3 ) it 's called a [ dative construction ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dative_construction ) and used in languages all over the world ; essentially , instead of saying ' i like food ' , you say ` food pleases me ' . 
  4 ) are you sure that it 's only a tense used for swearing ? 
  i 'm not very familiar with romanian , but it seems that b\u0103ga-mi-a\u015f , etc are just an inversion of the conditional ( such as mi-a\u015f b\u0103ga ) . 
  5 ) word order is not that important in a lot of languages , mostly because they mark the individual roles in the sentences through cases or because they are understood through context . 
  english has a much more strict word order , because it conveys meaning through the sentence structure , something that is not needed in many romance languages because - for example - the verbs are inflected for tense , person , number , mood , etc. 
  6 ) this is not a particular feature of romanian , cacophonies are present in all languages , but i doubt people try to avoid them when speaking , it sounds a bit childish . 
  7 ) catalan also has combinations of clitics with apostrophes and dashes , such as posa-me-n ` hi ( put that in there for me ) , or even treu-los-les-n ` hi ( take those in there from them ) . 
  it 's just a matter of orthography , we could very well stick those together in a single word , like german does with its compound words . 
  8 ) again , orthography , when forming the plural . 
  9 ) romanians are called ` rom\u00e2ni ' in romanian . 
  the \u00e2 does n't have a hat just because it looks nice ... 
  although if you 're romanian , i assume you know that already . 
  gypsies speak ` romani ' or ` rromani ' . 
  can we have some ? 
  do n't be greedy !, 
  that happend with my roommate , too . 
  her parents worked in their own business , they supposedly had almost no income , and she got 6,000 $ from the state each year , while i did n't get a single euro . 
  i do n't think they 're splitting the accents in ulster , they 're only marking ulster scots in pink and then saying ` mid ulster english ' in norther ireland and ` south ulster english ' in the republic , bur i agree that they should n't have marked the whole country as one . 
  the referendum was about the constitution as a whole , not a monarchy referendum . 
  what were you expecting that people voted ? 
  it was either that or back to the unkwown/possibly more dictatorship . 
  and you seem to conveniently forget that it was franco who appointed his successor , not the spanish people . 
  and not even my parents were old enough to vote in that referendum . 
  well , judging by the number of downvotes my comment got , i 'd say everyone in reddit loves it too ... 
  well , i definitely do not agree with you on the fact that democracy is n't always the best system . 
  this particular queen may have a high approval , the same as the president of a republic could have it . 
  that does n't mean that your next one can be a disaster . 
  i see a lot of republics in europe ( finland , germany , austria , switzerland , france ... ) and they do n't seem to have any problems at all with `` elected politicians '' that `` send the country into the shitter by passing unworkable legislation which only exists to score points with the electorate . '', 
  i will never be able to accept that just because someone was born in the ` right ' family , they are automatically appointed as the head of state of my country . 
  but i guess a lot of people , at least in the uk , are content with the way things currently are .
