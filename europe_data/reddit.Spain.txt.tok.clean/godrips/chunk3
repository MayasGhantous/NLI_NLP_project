  the uk ca n't get stripped of it 's voting rights because it has n't done anything illegal . 
  other countries can refuse to work with the uk , but that 's how the uk has experienced the eu for the past 50 years . 
   what is article 7 ? 
   [ an eu infringement procedure to be used against member countries that have committed fundamental rights violations . 
  ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-eu-news-article-7-vote-poland-rule-of-law/ ), 
  the uk has infinite time , it does n't have 2 years at all . 
  the 2 years only starts when article 50 is triggered , which the uk can do in 10 years time if it feels like it . 
  the uk has a loaded gun to the eu 's head right now , the eu is fucked until the uk decides what to do , which is why reading / r/europe is hilarious . 
  yeah because that 's what we 've actually seen in practice ... / s, 
  but you were so happy annexed by the soviet union poland , you do n't love the planet ? 
  yeah but they can keep initiating until it 's passed , they have a plan and it 's only a matter of time until it succeeds , they only have to win once whereas member states who oppose certain goals of the eu have to win every time in opposing their proposals . 
   one of the remain campaigns reasons for staying was securing around 3 mullion jobs linked to the eu . 
  bear in mind remain campaigners such as diane abbot were on bbc news last night / this morning admitting that those figures were highly exaggerated to generate the voting result they wanted . 
  the departure of britain from the eu affects a lot more than the london markets . 
  it has driven a risk-off reaction in the european bond markets , which were the focus of concern during the crisis of 2011-2012 . 
  in the aftermath of the shock result , the german 10-year bond yields fell to a record low of minus 0.15 % , according to jim leaviss of m&g , the fund management group . 
  although yields have bounced back to 0.09 % , this is still an 18 basis point fall on the day . 
  but italian , spanish , portuguese and greek bond yields have all risen on the news . 
  as a result the spread between italian/spanish and german bond yields has widened by a quarter of a point ; portugal has widened over germany by almost a third ; and greek yields by more than a point . 
  ewen cameron watt of blackrock , the fund management group , says that further euro zone integration looks less likely - bad news for peropheral countries . 
  why was this ? 
  the british news raised questions about the stability of the euro zone and about the electoral appeal of populist movements such as the one that delivered a brexit vote . 
  that will be bad news for mario draghi , the ecb president , who is widely credited with seeing off the worst of the euro crisis . 
  in britain itself , 10-year gilt yields have fallen by more than a quarter of a point since yesterday to 1.09 % . 
  this is not a reflection of confidence in the british model ( s&p indicates that it may cut the credit rating ) but in the belief that the bank of england may cut rates in july ( a 50/50 chance , according to mr leaviss ) , and in the expectation that british economic activity will slow . 
  similarly , the big fall in treasury bond yields reflected the view that the federal reserve will be slow to push up rates , if it does at all . 
  the latest market action shows the danger in believing , as many did at the start of the year , that bond yields were bound to rise . 
  and spare a thought for pension funds which see the value of their equity holdings fall while the value of their liabilities ( discounted by bond yields ) has risen . 
  the uk corporate pension deficit has widened by # 80 billion overnight or 10 times the annual eu budget contribution - a financial own goal on a spectacular scale . 
  from the comments : b ) it is clear that the eu will suffer more from this divorce . 
  the only solution is to have a friendly divorce ( and this time ) give the british what they wanted . 
  the eu leaders in their supreme and normal incompetence decided to refuse the very modest demand that he made . 
  know all europe is paying for the supreme incompetence of the eu . 
  northern ireland does n't want to be an independent country though , and it 's not going to rejoin southern ireland without some genocide . 
  the uk has n't invaded ukraine and annexed another countries territory though in violation of international law ? 
  it just wants to be independent and everyone wants to trade . 
  the uk is growing at double the rate of france and germany , and many countries including my own in europe are basically bankrupt . 
  we have no choice but to offer a good trade deal . 
   they signalled a harsh approach in case of brexit , merkel said a good deal would be offered . 
  politicians will do what their business masters tell them to do , the `` punishment '' circlejerk on reddit does n't exist in the real world . 
  french want to sell food , germans want to sell cars , that 's all that matters . 
  it 's bullshit and not going to happen either way . 
  n ireland is full of british nationalists , they are n't going anywhere from the uk without a war and genocide . 
  ireland is a separate country from the uk and already in the eu , ireland has the euro currency and is n't even leaving the eu . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  official figures on immigration into the uk are highly suspicious , for example the government says the uk population increased by 0.5 million , but the government handed out 2 million tax numbers to foreign citizens in that time , 4x as many people as it admits . 
  i 'm fairly sure some people in the north might have a problem with that . 
  worked so well when napoleon tried last time they made the british empire . 
  you can rely on russia to break the blockade like last time too , just to cause european butthurt . 
  history goes around and around and around . 
  no 2 years is the time it takes between invoking article 50 to the ** earliest ** leave date . 
  after the referendum the british government does n't have to invoke article 50 for many years if it does n't feel like it , and even when article 50 is invoked the 2 year deadline can be indefinitely extended by both sides for negotiations . 
  i 'd be amazed if the uk is actually officially out of the eu before 2020 . 
  not necessarily , you 're just seeing a selection here the op chose . 
  there 's some shit `` boulevard '' papers on the remain side with equally shit front pages . 
  yeah i think this is fake , i might try printing some of these tomorrow to get some free karma too . 
  and so we have to pay millions to police the straight of gibraltar and stop the hundreds of thousands of migrants coming over every year from africa ? 
  no i 'd rather the british do it thanks . 
  in fairness if you survived the red army it was medal worthy on it 's own . 
  yeah it 's bullshit , it 's like complaining if spain increased military patrols in the western meditteranean . 
  fuck off soros , millions of people have suffered because of your vampirical financial actions , if someone kills you not a single tear would be shed , infact they 'd probably get an award from the rest of humanity . 
  oh god it gets worse . 
  fuck sake france , why you so opposed to innovation ? 
   making new laws ; trading agreements with dozens of countries , without a bargaining chip the uk has been doing it for thousands of years , i do n't think it 's that difficult . 
  if the uk votes to leave the eu and article 50 is invoked all the existing trade agreements stay in place anyway , and even if the eu treaties get withdrawn , the uk automatically falls back to the pre-eu trade agreements it had ( protip : it had a lot ) . 
  it 's not a big deal for canada , australia , new zeland , japan , south korea etc. . . why would the uk , the fifth biggest economy on the planet , have any problems ? 
  they have the nuclear bargaining chip , completely fucking the world economy if people do n't make trade agreements quickly . 
   forocoches how the hell have i not heard about this place ? 
  oh wow it 's hilarious . 
  you must be wrong everyone outside catalunya tells me ciudadanos is the largest far right party, 
  escaped swimming ? 
  oh no you did n't . 
  foreign aid now counts as pretending you 're an imperial power ? 
  go back to being broke and arguing over irn-bru and heroin scotland . 
  they can kill occitan but they 'll never wipe out the catalan , 
  please gib back clay . 
  jokes aside i 've seen shit loads of french cars driving from this area with catalan flags on recently , what 's up with that ? 
   ** on greece 's economic meltdown in 2011 **  * `` when it becomes serious , you have to lie . 
  * |  ** on british calls for a referendum over lisbon treaty **  * `` of course there will be transfers of sovereignty . 
  but would i be intelligent to draw the attention of public opinion to this fact ? , '' *, 
  so by 2050 the uk will have the biggest population in europe , most of whom will be concentrated in southern england , and the uk is only half the size of germany ? 
  this is because we are trying to beat the americans and sell them a shit load of new airbus aircraft because iran has n't had access to new aircraft or parts for 30 + years due to the embargo and sanctions imposed by the west . 
  unfortunately there 's no fucking way i 'd get in one of the old iran air aircraft , and currently iran has no way to pay airbus because despite the sanctions being lifted us banks have n't unfrozen most of their money . 
  this is the correct answer . 
  having a giant hissy fit is n't good realpolitik . 
  everyone wants to have a good life , a good deal should be reached and life carries on . 
  i find it weird most norwegians are against joining the eu and yet their politicians are mostly in favour . 
  * nato foreign soldiers are voluntarily invited * you can leave nato at any time * nato soldiers do n't replace your own soldiers and ca n't do things in your country without your permission, 
  the queen probably would . 
  in finance everything is quoted in usd so you have a baseline if the values of other currencies change . 
  it 's never going to happen because national parliaments would have foreign soldiers in their country not under their control and potentially protecting their borders . 
  for example if we had an eu army it would have been impossible for hungary to close it 's border or build the fence it did . 
  i can see this plan getting vetoed by the uk , netherlands , spain , greece and most of eastern europe very quickly . 
  lol that really did n't help . 
  basically they stand for everything and nothing , do n't vote in parliament on contentious issues , does not have a clear political ideology ... all very italian . 
  he does n't run the finances but as one of the largest shareholders he takes the majority of the profits , which come from unpaid taxes , and then tells you how to vote . 
  the eu actually has a large budget for ` swaying social media ' anyway , i 'm sure some of is is manipulation on sites like reddit and youtube . 
  every government on the planet does it , the us has automated ai , the israelis use schills , russian has putinbots , i have no doubt the eu does it too . 
  most remain voters are below 35 , once you get to 45 + leave tends to dominate the demographic . 
  most reddit users are overwhelmingly under 35 , and also liberal / left wing , and so the sample is incredibly unrepresentative of the general uk population .
