[ cell 211 . 
  i was expecting [ something like this ] ( http://micczech1212.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/europe-according-to-usa.jpg ) . 
  can you just write `` putin '' on a piece of paper and be done with it ? 
  perhaps not `` celebrities '' but still pretty famous , i guess : * [ michael robinson ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_robinson_\\ ( footballer \\ ) ) , english ex-footballer from the 70s and 80s . 
  living in spain since 1989 . 
  now a tv personality . 
  ceo of mediaset espa\u00f1a ( largest tv group in spain ) . 
  ** spain ** : [ seven killed in country 's worst sporting disaster ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/09/07/inenglish/1441608045_603243.html ), 
   and how can 71 people willfully go into a goddam refrigeration truck ? 
  people who has nothing to lose and people who wo n't give up after getting so far . 
  this is horrifying . 
  he intended to use a good quality photo but his printer run out of ink . 
  curiously some people said our own '' [ first of october anti-fascist resistance groups ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_of_october_anti-fascist_resistance_groups ) '' was actually a fascist false flag operation made to discredit communism . 
  [ spain : clashes in seaside resort town after migrant dies in balcony during police raid ] ( http://www.startribune.com/spain-clashes-after-migrant-falls-to-death-in-police-raid/321391721/ ), 
  do richer regions complain about `` subsidizing '' poorer entities ? 
  good . 
  my facebook name is also fake but instead of `` chad cuntdestroyer thundercock '' it 's something like `` john smith '' , so it does n't raise any flags . 
  til not everyone in monaco drives a ferrari . 
  they attacked a spanish truck carrying meat just a couple of days ago : http://murciatoday.com/spanish-meat-lorries-attacked-by-french-farmers_26688-a.html i suppose those farmers only export food to countries where their produce ca n't drive local prices down ... 
  right ? 
  it used to be `` the sick man of europe '' . 
  too many contenders to that title , i suppose ... 
  from spain : ** cu\u00e1nto cuesta un ... ** * a tattoo * a euro * an abortion * an iphone 5 * a centennial ( or a centenarian ) ( ? ), 
  ** cu\u00e1nto cuesta una ... ** * a dna test * a wedding * a pregnancy test * a rhinoplasty * a root canal treatment, 
  what kind of monster would dislike italia ? 
  i do n't have any problem with content warnings to protect those who could actually be `` triggered '' from graphic depictions of violence and abuse ( people diagnosed with ptsd by a real doctor ) . 
  on the other hand fuck tumblr-style `` trigger warnings '' that just mean `` this somewhat controversial topic may hurt your feelings '' . 
   i suspect the majority is for independence , but would n't the voting be better than constant fights ? 
  according to the latest official opinion poll ( june 2015 ) from the catalan government : ** do you want catalonia to become an independent state ? 
  ** yes : 42,9 % no : 50 % do n't know : 5,8 % did n't answer : 1,3 % ** catalonia should be ... ** a region of spain : 4 % an autonomous community of spain : 29,3 % a state inside a federalized spain : 24 % an indepedent state : 37,6 % do n't know : 3,9 % did n't answer : 1,1 % source : http://ceo.gencat.cat/ceop/appjava/pages/home/fitxaestudi.html?colid=5468&amp;lasttitle=bar%f2metre+d%27opini%f3+pol%edtica+%28bop%29.+2a+onada+2015, 
  why would the spanish government do that ? 
  separatists have no army and i do n't think there are many catalan local cops suicidal enough to confront combat-ready soldiers . 
  sending the army here would be overkill and an easy way for the independentists to gain international sympathy ( something they lack right now ) . 
  imo , the worst case scenario in catalonia would be a permanent general strike or mass civil disobedience in case the spanish gov suspends the catalan autonomy or does something like that . 
  even in that case i doubt the protests would last for too long since most people have something to lose if the region goes down the drain . 
  ca n't blame you , i would do the same if i were you , but i live in catalonia and i hope they do n't do anything stupid if they win . 
  i would n't wan na meet him in a dark alley . 
  hey , i thought real french croissants used little butter , unlike crappy overbuttered , syrup-bathed spanish croissants . 
  yeah , it 's unbelievable that stuff like this happened in europe just 20 years ago . 
  it 's beyond sad . 
  somebody should design a greek fisherman 's cap for tf2 and call it `` the yanis '' . 
  i love reddit . 
  came for the p0rn , stayed for the drama . 
  most spaniards are cherry-picking catholics . 
  - lgtb rights ? 
  no problem . 
  - abortion ? 
  yes , but with some limitations ( or , if you prefer , `` no , but with some exceptions '' ) . 
  - baptizing and first communion ? 
  yep . 
  - confirmation ? 
  nah ... - wedding in a church ? 
  yes !, 
  - no sex before marriage ? 
  aww , poor thing . 
  i 'm glad they rescued it . 
  / r/eliactually5 /, 
  i 've heard some people saying `` oh , they already lost their child , that 's enough punishment for them ! '' . 
  yeah , they did n't want to kill their son , but they made a moronic decision and should be held responsible for it . 
  to be fair most nations plan hypothetical attacks against all their neighbors , do n't they ? 
  even if they do n't make any sense right now ( portugal invading spain !, 
  italy conquering france !, 
  germany taking over pol ... oh , nevermind ) . 
  better safe than sorry , i guess . 
  agreed . 
  this was a european hotel ( spanish chain riu ) full of european tourists . 
  it was not a random target ... 
  i 'm all for taxi liberalization but i do n't like uber or any other `` shared economy '' service that do n't feel like paying taxes or playing by the same rules that everyone else . 
   people do still congratulate those who have a `` popular '' name ( antonio , francisco , carmen , pilar ) , mostly because on those dates there is usually a bank holiday or a festival somewhere , but almost nobody remember the less known ones . 
  on my facebook timeline . 
  if your name happens to be eustaquio or filomena ... ( or any not-so-popular name , actually ) tough luck !, 
  nobody cares about your name day . 
  if you just wan na make some noise use fireworks instead , they 're ( usually ) safer . 
  if we banned it labs would just move to countries in which they actually do n't give a rat 's ass about animal rights . 
  your spanish is better than the english of most spaniards . 
  yeah , i know people who do n't bother to update them anymore since you can already do all operations with your card . 
  i know a guy who did n't update his passbook for years and when he decided to update it again his bank printed four new booklets just for him . 
  what a waste of time and paper . 
  oh , i believe the japanese still use them as much as we do . 
  if i recall correctly , minors will still be allowed to have sex with each other ( a 17 y.o. 
  with a 15 y.o. 
  for instance ) . 
  an adult wo n't be allowed to have sex with someone under 16 . 
  i 'm not afraid of speaking my mind but it 's true that we 're usually quieter than nationalists . 
  i would say it 's easier to argue in favor of independence . 
  it 's an exciting project for many people , like beginning a new life . 
  it 's hard to defend the status quo without sounding like a killjoy * ( it 's not that easy , it 's not that nice , it just not gon na happen * ... ) . 
  in spain [ passbooks ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kdhevkp.jpg ) are still widely used , although they 're slowy disappearing in favour of on-line banking and credit cards . 
   in spain , teens can have sex ( consensual age is 13 ) before they 're allowed to create a facebook account ( 14yo ) . 
  the government is going to raise it to 16 though . 
   as someone write , i would n't like to see catalonia seceded from spain , but i would hate much , much more to see barcelona converted in donbass . 
  if you mean a civil war i doubt we would see such a drastic scenario . 
  if catalonia becomes an independent country i think most `` unionists '' would accept it and carry on with their lives . 
  i 'm a catalan strongly opposed to secession but i 'm actually more afraid of entering some kind of legal `` limbo '' in which catalonia has unilaterally declared independence but no country recognizes us ( let alone the spanish government ) . 
  the catalan government beginning to act as a sovereign nation but madrid heh , i can picture the catalan tax agency and the spanish tax agency trying to collect the same tax and threatening us with either the mossos d'esquadra or the guardia civil . 
  does he play the accordion too ? 
  i voted on that referendum .
