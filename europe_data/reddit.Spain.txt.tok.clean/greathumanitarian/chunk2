  why do most ( all ? ), 
  italian political parties have a round logo ? 
  norway is going to break apart at any moment . 
  i 've no problem with people correcting my grammar provided they 're not condescending or insulting . 
  that 's the system the spanish language regulator recommends , but nobody uses it . 
  we go 1.234.547,8, 
  not sure if these are totally wrong , but in spain we have : - [ bulgarians ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k94ubx1.jpg ) - [ french omelettes ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ckvrm50.jpg ) - [ neapolitans ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iihejyn.jpg ) ( can also be filled with ham & cheese , tuna , sobrassada , etc. ) . 
  in spain you can get 20 gb for $ 29/month ( yoigo ) . 
  you can even see recent pro- [ grapo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_of_october_anti-fascist_resistance_groups ) graffiti in some cities . 
  me too . 
  poland stronk , rich and smart !, 
  justice at last !, 
  now i hope your song does n't suck as much as our songs usually do . 
  perhaps some day they will say * `` thank you spain for mercadona !, 
  thank you germany for lidl !, 
  yeah , if his attack made norway reinstate the dp he would feel more than accomplished . 
  that would be a pretty clear case of `` terrorists winning '' . 
  we buy portuguese companies and the french buy ours . 
  it 's the food chain . 
  from espanha , thank god for portugal !, 
  nah , it 's probably a false flag attack to make them look bad . 
  well , tax havens are certainly paradises for some people . 
  our high-speed and long-distance trains are great ( if you do n't take into account the costs ) , but our commuter and regional trains leave much to desire . 
  what 's that texas flag/punisher skull patch ? 
  most spanish cemeteries are like that too . 
  of course , lower rows are more expensive to rent than higher ones ( in some places they 're so high you need a ladder to reach them ) . 
  i want to be cremated too , after removing any usable organ from my body . 
  this is also common in spain , but at least in my city graves ( niches , actually ) are rented for decades , not just three years . 
  well , my dad owns an ancient renault 19 . 
  treats it like crap but it still works after that many years . 
  how many other underwater tunnels or superbridges could be built in europe ? 
  provided , of course , is technically viable and there is enough founding and political will . 
  - ireland - great britain - spain - morocco - sicily - mainland italy - corsica - sardinia ? 
  i 've heard some people proposing a link between mainland spain and the balearic islands , but i doubt it would be feasible . 
  there is even a popular [ 1960 's song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuyqfl3ko8k ) about how great it would be if there was a bridge connecting valencia and majorca !, 
  i feel so dumb now ... 
  some people say 18-year-old juan carlos murdered his [ little brother alfonso ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/infante_alfonso_of_spain ) in order to secure his coronation as the king of spain . 
  well , there is also linux , which was created in europe by a european . 
  that 's pretty big . 
  does anyone remember [ quaero ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quaero ) , aka the `` european google '' ? 
  could be any latin american country that still has that , though , or even southern france . 
  french corporations own half our dairy industry anyway . 
  well , i 'm afraid they 're already close to you : http://www.tacobell.es/ me ? 
  my fat ass says it will welcome any american fast food chains . 
  we used to have a few wendy 's back in the 80 's / 90 's . 
  we also used to have tons of pizza hut restaurants but all of them were transformed into domino 's pizza outlets a few years ago . 
  a beautiful country with shitty politicians ? 
  that rings a bell ... 
  yeah , if you 're russian it does n't seem too wise to go around telling people you do n't support putin . 
  it 's a wonder why the baltic states rushed into nato and other western organizations after gaining their independence . 
  apparently if you 're russian/pro-russian you ca n't be a fascist , even if you 're the textbook definition of one . 
  putin is pretty close to * puta * in spanish , which means whore . 
  some people even say * \u00a1 hijo de putin !, 
  * as a euphemism for sob . 
  let 's see : unemployment , corruption ... whatever : fiesta , siesta , sangr\u00eda , paella and jam\u00f3n . 
  this sounds scary . 
  what 's the worst a couple of scumbags with explosive belts could do if they gained access to a nuclear power plant ? 
  could they actually cause a chernobyl-like disaster ? 
  you do n't say ... 
  just curious , do these warnings appear to non-eu visitors ? 
  my city privatized its streetlights a couple of years ago and the concessionary is installing new led lamps . 
  now people are complaining that the new led lights are not bright enough compared with what we had before ... 
  four afghan and two spanish policemen killed : http://news.yahoo.com/second-spanish-policeman-dies-taliban-attack-kabul-official-064719804.html, 
  unless he visited the parliament building every day that does n't sound like a harsh punishment . 
  i suppose spain looks so blue due to our housing bubble . 
  til portuguese bears are assholes . 
  yeah , looks like they 're using terrorism as an excuse to push their anti-welfare views . 
  i 'm pretty pessimistic about that . 
  i would n't be much surprised if we 're next ... just a couple of hours ago the police arrested two men accused of funding isis from spain : http://www.todayonline.com/world/spanish-police-arrest-two-moroccans-accused-funding-islamic-state, 
  i still hope this is not our `` new normal '' ... 
  i refuse to get used to it . 
  and it 's not even been a week, 
  [ soon to be `` cinco torres '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chekl0j6zyq ), 
  portable guillotines , so convenient when you need to 1789-ing somebody . 
  we have a pretty nasty underground economy . 
  many people earn a living doing `` cash-in-hand '' jobs with no legal contract whatsoever , so they still count as unemployed . 
  meanwhile we 're having another civil war !, 
  i believe the german empire and the weimar republic already used it . 
  and they wonder why turkey 's accession to the eu is not even taken into consideration right now . 
  i can understand allowing donations from expatriates , but letting foreigners with no relationship with the country pour money into your elections sounds pretty crazy to me . 
  does any party refuse to receive money from foreigners out of principle ? 
  allowing foreign nationals to put money in your elections seems like a really bad idea imo . 
  birds of a feather flock together . 
  i welcome our new luxembourgish overlords ... provided we earn luxembourgish wages too !, 
  * does not apply to spanish singers and musicians , who are happy to be regarded as `` latinos '' . 
  not sure if malta small or iceland big . 
  good riddance , although i use browser add-ons to filter them . 
  what kind of cake is the `` lawful neutral '' one ? 
  is that white chocolate ? 
  if that the case i want one . 
  right . 
  now . 
  i hope he 's still young enough to undo all the brainwashing . 
  `` what other people use to light their cigars '' . 
  til about mirinda too . 
  i suppose pepsico favored kas instead because it was already more popular . 
  not all ideas are good ideas . 
  making it higher than the et seems almost disrespectful . 
  our laws are already among the toughest in western europe , but people still believe criminals here get a slap on the wrist , so politicians tend to update our penal code to introduce new crimes and/or harsher sentences . 
  i think hats are pretty cool ( after all i play team fortress 2 ) , but that 's a bit of a stretch .
