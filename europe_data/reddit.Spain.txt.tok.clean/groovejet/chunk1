but that 's their strategy . 
  they try to use the disadvantages of eu migration ( they can not control it ) and mix it with the disadvantages of their other migrants ( come from poor countries with no education and a different culture ) to create the perfect straw man . 
  then why everyone that talks about a brexit thinks that these countries will happily join the uk in an anglo union ? 
  maybe they are not interested . 
  just a question . 
  are there movements in canada , australia and new zealand that would like to have a union with the uk ? 
  french is complicated , but at least there is some logic behind it . 
  [ it 's not like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wz3yqim.png ) . 
  you forgot the writing system that makes it harder to know how a word will be pronounced . 
  they are still people and probably they also vote . 
  what 's / r/european supposed to be ? 
  i may travel next year with my mother . 
  i 'll be doing paris - brussels - amsterdam , so i was thinking of going a day away to another city when i was in brussels . 
  she usually likes religious buildings , so i suppose whichever city has the most impressive cathedral will win . 
  so if i have n't visited any of them , which one would you recommend ? 
   / r/europecirclejerk ftfy, 
  they conjugate verbs a bit differently too . 
  for example they will say `` disfrut\u00e1 '' instead of `` disfruta '' or `` colgate '' instead of `` cu\u00e9lgate '' . 
  as someone who was born and raised in per\u00fa i can tell you that the spanish accent for us sounds a bit porn-like and you can blame [ this series ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/serie_rosa ) for it . 
  i actually like it , although i ca n't feel it on my mother even though all of my friends get immediately that she 's from spain . 
  was n't the bigoted lady that talked to gordon brown complaining about immigration living in spain without knowing spanish ? 
  edit : [ she has a villa in spain ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/gillian-duffy-loses-polling-card-1686525 ) . 
  but poland ca n't into mediterranean countries . 
   still no train going directly to edinburgh airport you can reach the airport using the tram , though . 
   benefits of competition improving standards but there is n't much competition between the railway companies in the uk . 
  i think what the article tries to say is that the justification for privatization on the uk is that the private sector is better than the public one . 
  however , there are lot of bids that are won by public companies from other countries . 
  you can check it in [ google streeview ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.3769298,4.3045524,3a,75y,271h,83.27t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sv6_prt06xssgg8z_lfw_3w!2e0 ) . 
  apparently it 's been there since 2009 . 
   especially when latin america is n't the most numerically significant origin of immigration into spain because you said that , which is not true . 
   they fucked up when they decided to nationalise private banking debt . 
  i guess we should have followed the rest of the world and let them crash . 
  yes it is . 
  romania and morocco may have more immigrants than other countries from there , but if you take latin america as a single entity they come on top . 
  [ here are the numbers i found ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_spain ) . 
   but he said latin america . 
  yes , but latin america is not just one country . 
  argentinias may have high standards , but someone from bolivia does not . 
  you still have many types of pizza , do n't worry . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.efe.com/efe/noticias/america/cultura/director-rae-dice-que-espanol-idioma-eminentemente-americano/2/9/2384860 ) will rustle your jimmies then . 
   it costs less not sure about this one . 
  there are times that is cheaper to buy an easyjet ticket than to take the train .

  since you mention gell\u00e9rt . 
  is the church and cave near there worth the visit ? 
  same for the citadella , which is quite close . 
  thanks a lot !, 
  i will definitely take a look during my visit !, 
  i 'm going soon . 
  any you would recommend ? 
  no , you can head to / r/fatlogic and see how real it is . 
  it 's because of shit like [ haes ] ( http://www.haescommunity.org/ ) . 
  some people just keep lying to themselves saying it 's not a problem . 
  it 's probably cheaper to fly to mexico for them ... 
  it 's a false dilemma because the outcomes of a war with russia wo n't be either to be conquered by russia or to blow up their gas pipes . 
  i think that 's a false dilemma . 
  yes , but then part of europe will freeze during winter without that gas . 
  but was n't your country called before the united kingdom of britain ** and ** ireland ? 
  it was actually just [ $ 1 million ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/08/spain-one-bn-on-riot-gear-autumn-of-protest ) . 
  the problem with the torygraph is that is very francophobic , so all news related to france have to be taken with a pinch of salt . 
  time for an `` electricity generation of europe '' album ? 
  [ future enlargement of the eu ] ( http://i.imgur.com/miscddc.png ), 
  could the parisians explain why is not put back to public use ? 
  is it too costly to do it ? 
  is the railway in a place where it is not needed ? 
  haha i 'm just 181 :p, 
  i know . 
  it 's not as if you had invaded them before . 
  well at least we finish our airports . 
  i guess oil & gas must be a very nice industry to work for . 
  do you work in spain ? 
  no , ibiza is way more mixed . 
  also the same country where mykonos is located . 
  i would 've expected the beach label to be put on the french riviera . 
  it 's funny how when i read french it does makes some sense . 
  however , when i listen to it i 'm totally lost . 
  but is n't the '' \u00f0 '' supposed to sound like `` th '' ? 
  [ yes ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/feb/15/russian-roads-dash-cams-video ) . 
  [ it happens ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/atheltic-bilbao-fans-arrived-at-budapest-829834 ) . 
  i keep misreading `` murcia '' as `` murica '' . 
  as someone said in this thread , which temperature are you using to wash your clothes ? 
  i wash them at 30c and they usually last me over a year . 
  on the other hand , the clothes i buy from uniqlo tend to get damaged quite often . 
  i think there is just not much difference between the sizes . 
  i 'm 1.81 tall and a bit muscular , so i always go for m ( although in some stores like topman i have to go for s ) . 
  their medium size sometimes is a bit small , but i remember once i found a shirt i really liked that they only had on s and when i tried the different was n't that much . 
  i wash them at 30c and had the same experience . 
  never again . 
  in my experience uniqlo jeans were shit . 
  not only were the cuts not good , the quality is terrible . 
  they lasted me less than 6 months . 
  on the other hand the zara man jeans i 'm wearing right now have been with me for more than a year and they still look great . 
  they do n't have many stores in the usa . 
  apparently [ americans do n't fit on their clothes ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/health/fat-shaming-middle-america-americans-big-zara-clothes/story?id=17725146 ) . 
  they also make very nice clothes for men . 
  i found them much better than uniqlo , topman and h&m . 
  the literacy rate in spain is 97.5 % , is not as if the world is falling apart . 
  buddhist are actually prosecuting a massacring muslims in burma . 
  reminded me of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okhz7ce8wp0 ) . 
  name of the thread should be `` timelapses of europe '' .
