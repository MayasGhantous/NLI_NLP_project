  estonia ca n't into nordic ; _ ;, 
  did n't know one of the london trains went all the way to iverness . 
  thought all of them stopped on glasgow and edinburgh . 
  where was the uk picture taken at ? 
  earthquakes in madrid ? 
  [ torre bankia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/torre_caja_madrid ) is actually 1 meter taller than torre de cristal . 
  the only problem i found with madrid metro is the train frequency . 
  i wish it could be like london where trains come every 3 minutes . 
  i hate being waiting 8 minutes when i make a connection . 
  i does n't need to be underground to be a metro . 
  most of london underground is actually overground . 
  for a system to be considered a metro it has to be `` operated on their own right of way and segregated from general road and pedestrian traffic '' . 
  having said that , that 's a picture of seville tram , not seville metro . 
  polan can into trolleybus, 
  i have always been confused about this . 
  is the european robin the national bird from the eu ? 
  as far as i know it is the national bird from the united kingdom . 
  i remember a map posted not long ago showing that spain does n't rely in russia at all for its energy . 
  i remember how satisfying was finally beating [ this level ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfmlbwn6u_4 ) . 
  this reminds me of [ this game ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blast_corps ) . 
  thanks . 
  i had not zoomed the map . 
  you forgot the canaries . 
  you still have poland . 
  your best guess would be to use web sites like [ kayak ] ( http://www.kayak.com ) or [ skyscanner ] ( http://www.skyscanner.net/ ) .

  i would n't call spain `` homogeneous '' . 
  explain spain then, 
  no , she is an infanta . 
  leonor is the princess and leti is the queen . 
  were those estimates done before the crisis ? 
  what did you do during your week in svalbard ? 
  i would like to go there in the future , but every touristic activity there seems to be very expensive .

  are n't you forgetting about [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_lepanto ) ? 
  [ future enlargement of the eu ] ( http://i.imgur.com/miscddc.png ), 
  [ us embassy in per\u00fa ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/embajada_de_ee.uu_en_lima,_per%c3%ba.jpg ), 
  that still does n't explain why people on turkey which is mostly muslim would dislike muslims more than the uk . 
  i have a hard time believing that muslims are viewed more unfavorably on turkey than on the uk . 
  [ they are just birdwatching ] ( http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/news/international/russian-troops-claim-to-be-birdwatchers-2014032484981 ) . 
  the point is that the colonies did n't get the independence because the constitution allowed it . 
  they had to fight several battles in a war of independence against spain to earn it . 
  but spain did n't lose its colonies because they had a referendum . 
  they fought battles in order to achieve it . 
  it uses the same conjugation than the 3rd person plural , although in spain some people use it with the same conjugation than `` vosotros '' . 
  it 's the same with t\u00fa / usted . 
  funny enough , the same thing happen with brasil and portugal with tu/voc \u00ea and v\u00f3s / voc\u00eas . 
  that 's not exactly accurate . 
  there are two forms of the second person plural in spanish . 
  in latin america only the formal version is used . 
  [ 11.5 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arroba ), 
  i thought poland was the [ bolivia of europe ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ogqrhbg.jpg ) according to polandball . 
  sweden is a developed country , which is different . 
  i thought high speed railways were not allowed to have level crossings . 
  i thought the uk was going to be way higher . 
  i see a lot of people cycling in london . 
  but , [ will people be ready ? 
  ] ( http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/news/science-technology/public-nowhere-near-ready-for-reversible-usb-2013120581747 ), 
  the funny thing is that the comments of the news are saying the opposite . 
  that this will prevent innovation . 
  i do n't agree though . 
  there is nothing more annoying that running out of battery and not being able to use your friend 's phone because he has an iphone and i have an android phone . 
  probably because of [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_culture ) . 
  today i learnt that spain is not western europe . 
  no , but the guys that appear in [ these videos ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmtbfsj_tr4 ) do . 
  just because he has gone against straight people does n't mean he is right . 
  he is a neo-nazi , for fucks sake . 
  did you know [ he has been arrested ] ( http://www.advocate.com/news/world-news/2014/01/21/antigay-russian-neo-nazi-arrested-cuba ) ? 
  besides vigilantism is wrong . 
  last year a polish guy was killed in the uk because people thought he was a pedophile . 
  turns out he was innocent . 
  no , you are being downvoted because you support the actions of a neo-nazi that has filmed himself humiliating homosexual people . 
  that 's bullshit and you know it . 
  the guy is a neo-nazi for crying out loud . 
  he was filmed [ beating an iraqi gay man ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/neo-nazi-activist-flees-russia-over-anti-gay-video-campaign/489348.html ) and is now [ arrested ] ( http://en.ria.ru/russia/20140118/186668847.html ) because of that . 
  i can not believe you are trying to justify their actions . 
  these people have abused and humiliated gay teenagers . 
  they are sick and deserve no sympathy . 
  are you talking about [ occupy pedofilia ] ( http://www.advocate.com/news/world-news/2013/07/26/russian-neo-nazis-torture-gay-teens-anti-pedophilia-campaign ) ? 
  because it 's nothing more than an excuse to beat up gay people and also to make people believe that homosexuals are pedophiles . 
  ryan air does fly from stansted and soon easyjet from gatwick . 
  i remember that most of their complains were about how hard is to schedule something with someone as you have to `` book '' them in advance . 
  i have always been told that latin people are more `` spontaneous '' . 
  having said that . 
  i think it is to be expected that different countries have different ways of seeing life and there is nothing wrong about it and to be fair i always tell my friends that `` when in rome do as the romans do '' . 
  if you moved to sweden , for instance , you have to get used to the lifestyle that people have there or you are going to have a bad time . 
  i 'm sure that every country has its bad and good things and you have to live with them , there is no perfect place in earth . 
  i 'm just saying that most people i know that have moved there complain about how difficult is to make friends . 
  i did n't have that problem when i moved to london . 
  also , i do n't know why you get so defensive . 
  i 'm just explaining / u/paravin why some people may have problems with people who are not very talkative . 
  i 'm not saying everyone in scandinavia is . 
  that 's what i 'm saying . 
  there are people that do n't mind , but i 'm sure most people in latin countries or in the uk will have a problem with it and that 's what the article is trying to show . 
  that the nordic countries are not for everyone . 
  nobody is saying that being social automatically makes a culture superior , but for many people living in a country where people do n't socialise much is an issue . 
  i 've seen many people in reddit describing nordic countries as an utopia , but many of my friends who have migrated there complain about this a lot . 
  the problem may be that the daily mail seems to have a big influence in the government policies . 
  i 'm not sure how much bild can influence auntie angela .
