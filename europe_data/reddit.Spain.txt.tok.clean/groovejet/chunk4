  extinction of the human race, 
  sorry i forgot governments can only do one thing at a time, 
  i know , that 's why what the priest says sound so ridiculous to me, 
   `` today they are allowing this propaganda and tomorrow they will allow gay marriages , '' priest ghenadie valuta told reporters . 
  deal with it, 
  an irish friend of mine once told me `` english invade countries , irish infest them '' . 
  russian sounds very similar to portuguese . 
  when i lived in brazil i had a russian coworker and she told me that . 
  have n't talked much with people i know are from galicia , i was born in per\u00fa and have been living in london for a while . 
  my family is from madrid and here i only have one friend from galicia . 
  i do n't have any problem understanding him , though . 
  i always thought that italian had a couple more of vowels than us . 
  at least according to [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_phonology ) . 
  believe it or not it is actually harder for us to understand you , even more than brazilians . 
  also , when i was in lisbon a year ago a lot of people could speak a decent amount of spanish , which ended up being a problem because i would start speaking in portuguese and they would get my accent and answer in spanish . 
  at the end the whole conversation would turn into a portu\u00f1ol mess . 
  ca n't wait for the polandball comic about this, 
  thanks , obama !, 
  but some of it has originated in britain . 
  i 'm half peruvian and we have food that originated due to the influence of the chinese migrants like [ arroz chaufa ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-go6phjxddxc/ubhkshnac5i/aaaaaaaaire/yno6rwnadlm/s1600/escanear0039.jpg ) and we consider them to be peruvian dishes . 
  it 's not just that . 
  there was a post about americans making comments about brits driving on the left . 
  it 's not as if they are the only ones who do that . 
  i also was downvoted into oblivion once for saying that while i do n't think british food is shite , i do n't find it special at all . 
  it 's just ok . 
  thank \u00b5, 
  the problem is that is turning into shitamericansayaboutbrits, 
  debt, 
   `` this amounts to the imposition of foreign and unsuitable values , laid out before the most vulnerable section of society - minors . '', 
  i just can not stand this argument . 
  these people are just a bunch of cowards trying to use children to shield their own bigotry . 
  that looks cool . 
  any idea of how much time it will take for results to be seen ? 
  jobs, 
  i just read about it here in / r/europe . 
  not a single thing about it in the british press . 
  at least i have n't noticed . 
  moldova and the eu are developing a close relationship and russia is not happy about it . 
  it 's the same thing that 's happening with ukraine . 
  the hardest for me is the pronunciation , which seems so illogical compared to spanish . 
  it 's a very well known fact that the french have always been jealous of our tortilla . 
  i 'm with 3 mobile in the uk , they wo n't support 4g until the end of the year although their network uses dc-hsdpa for 3g which has made me reach 16mb/s sometimes . 
  which is nice since i have an unlimited data plan . 
  my phone does support 4g , but i do n't know if it will pick it up when roaming or if 4g is already rolled out in spain . 
  edit : according to [ this ] ( http://www.three.co.uk/discover/built_for_internetting?site=d ) i need an update from my phone provider to be able to use 4g . 
  this is n't true for brazilian portuguese , but to be fair that 's the portuguese i 've been exposed the most to and their pronunciation can vary by a big margin sometimes . 
  erm ... it was n't just them, 
  not so sure about it , while my 3g is blazing fast in the uk , this weekend i was in spain and it was slow as hell when i was using roaming . 
  my friend , however , had an spanish phone and his was fine . 
  it 's not as simple as that . 
  the banks do n't want to sell them cheap because otherwise it 'll appear as a loss . 
  as long as the houses they have appear as an `` asset '' from the bank with that value nobody wants to buy it wo n't appear as a loss . 
  they are talking about disposable income, 
  the same can be said for many european countries . 
  and they 're jealous of our tortilla, 
  you are not part of the agreement . 
  you just do n't need a visa to enter a schengen country because they are all part of the eea . 
  how long until someone says it will give you cancer ? 
  at least he did n't end up in west croydon like i did once :-(, 
  probably because in the uk if someone 's house value is going to decrease because of a new project they will manage to block it . 
  i also do n't know how it can cost # 32 billion . 
  it 's like more than double of what tunneling the alps costed . 
  then off with their heads and get some extra cash :d edit : you can still visit windsor castle and hampton court palace ( which i recommend ) . 
  i know it 's personal experience but i have yet to see someone coming to london to `` see the queen '' . 
  the point he is trying to make is that people would still go to london . 
  people still visit versailles even though the french monarchs are not there and i remember having read that it receives more visits than its british counterparts . 
  anyway if you want to see some statistics you can check visitengland numbers ( sadly they only have up until 2011 ) and see that royal attractions are not at the top . 
  [ top 20 free attractions ] ( http://www.visitengland.org/images/top%2020%20free_v2_tcm30-33745.pdf ) [ top 20 paid attractions ] ( http://www.visitengland.org/images/top%2020%20paid_v2_tcm30-33746.pdf ), 
  it 's not as if the uk does n't have [ its own problems with racism ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/oct/17/stop-and-search-race-figures ), 
  i thought trains nowadays had signalling systems that prevent them from doing this . 
  i 'm surprised this type of accidents do n't happen more often then . 
  considering i live and work in london , i 'm worried about if i 'm still going to be able to do it if they do . 
  i find your answer very insulting . 
  i 'm not `` weird '' nor `` funny '' . 
  i 'm just a human being like anyone else . 
  and people do n't `` turn '' gay . 
  i feel people in the uk are going to use these news as an argument against further expansion of the uk hs network, 
  i know , but it 's a very stupid one and very selfish to say the least . 
  `` i ca n't explain something , so fuck them ! '' . 
  the worst part is that it is used quite often . 
   `` i do n't approve of violence , but i did n't know how to explain this gathering to my son , '' i really ca n't stand this type of people . 
  is it really that hard to say `` there are some people who feel attracted to people of their same gender '' ? 
  i mean it 's not that hard to understand . 
  i do n't think all lines are automated . 
  i think it 's just the jubilee and victoria and soon the northern line , which is the reason why it 's being closed so often lately . 
  they had a prime minister who looked like someone from a sci-fi series and now is in jail . 
  however , the trial has not been fair according to the eu although ukraine does not agrre . 
  merkel seems to like her a lot . 
  yes please , we want some popcorn, 
  but italy is not the only country that does that . 
  it 's the same for spain , nationality is given by your parents . 
  happy pride everyone :(, 
  [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ophriji3hxs ) taught me a lot about it . 
   ideological center of catholicism . 
  pope and councils covering abuses and talking non-sense about things people do n't really care anymore . 
  sadly , they do care about it in some parts of the world, 
  but that comes along with monotheism, 
  somehow i feel this has a big meme potential, 
  the problem is that not all of them speak german, 
  i know i 'm not blaming them , besides lots of them seem to be able to speak spanish well ( at least in lisbon ) .
