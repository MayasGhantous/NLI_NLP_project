  there is lot of work in it here . 
  [ this is relevant ] ( http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/politics/politics-headlines/boris-demands-fantasy-version-of-eu-2012120551919 ), 
  they also seem to hate us, 
  good to know , which is the real reason then ? 
  i think it would be better if they could disclose the trends by region . 
  europe is not a single block and the reason why the hiv levels are rising may be different . 
  in the article they already state that the reasons for this in eastern europe and western europe are different . 
  that was better than expected . 
   many districts of the cities in africa actually have a higher standard of living than latvia is this actually true or just an hyperbole ? 
  latvia may not be the richest country in europe , but it is ranked [ 48th on the hdi index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_human_development_index ) , which if i 'm not wrong is higher than any african country . 
  ustedes is the formal version of `` vosotros '' , just like `` usted '' and `` t\u00fa '' . 
  vosotros never made it to america and that is why spanish speakers there use ustedes for everything . 
  it 's similar in portuguese . 
  brazilians always use `` voc\u00ea '' instead of `` tu '' . 
  we have the same saying in spanish : * `` dime con qui\u00e9n andas y te dir\u00e9 qui\u00e9n eres '' *, 
  if you think russia is bad now wait until putin is gone . 
   the paris expo of 1900 sponsored a competition for the design of the city 's brand new metro system -- which was only to be the second in the world ( london was first ) . 
  i always thought that the budapest metro was the second oldest after london . 
  this lacks an image of putin on the background . 
  / r/es is terrible . 
  it is just one guy posting dozen of articles every day . 
  i 'm sure you can get a better deal if you are willing to spend a bit more . 
  i 'm surprised you can still find places for such a low amount of money in london . 
   i pay 450 eur a month for it where in hell you get a room in london for $ 450 ? 
  that 's # 330 . 
  i pay # 800 for mine , but i live close to the vauxhall tube and just share with another person and it has a very decent size . 
  in latin american the stereotype of the galicians is that they are dumb . 
  you can thank the argies for that . 
  sweden can into baltic now !, 
  this is not exclusive to spain , though . 
  at least we finish them, 
  if i remember correctly the biggest port of the mediterranean was algeciras followed by valencia . 
  edit : [ source ] ( http://www.porttechnology.org/news/apm_terminals_algeciras_the_busiest_in_the_med ), 
  now i can into ascii \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  the additional \\ changes the face of the emoticon, 
  sometimes is hard to remember how much money you have in the bank \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
   although it can be killed through cooking . 
  who eats raw pork ? 
  [ is this the traffic light they are talking about ? 
  ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.053912,13.757589,3a,75y,82.18h,87.86t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1scw7pqwjukb-tqitfhhmida!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en-gb ), 
  should 've invested in eastern poland, 
  mediterranean people are also not white according to some of them . 
  in fact i remember a post in / r/tumblrinaction where a girl said that greeks were `` basically arabs '' . 
   what is it exactly that makes them `` non-functioning '' ? 
  the spanish healthcare system is as good as any in western europe . 
  in fact spain has the highest life expectancy of all europe, 
  coffee for everyone !, 
  i 'm half peruvian and in per\u00fa the grievance against spaniards is because `` you took our gold '' . 
  brasilans do it too . 
  but five is ok , right ? 
   for a catholic country gay marriage is a big thing are you forgetting that portugal and spain approved gay marriage before you guys did ? 
  the issue is [ a bit more complex ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/01/24/opinion/food-chains-extra-virgin-suicide.html?_r=0 ) though . 
  komorowski should have invested in eastern poland . 
  did n't we all know this already ? 
  has it made it to / r/subredditdrama already ? 
  thank god we have reddit, 
  that was the guy i was thinking about . 
  he is very good . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_on_global_population_growth?language=en ) was the talk i was thinking about . 
  was it a ted talk about overpopulation ? 
  there is something i still do n't understand about how free movement works with switzerland . 
  as a eu citizen i know i can get to work in every country of the european economic area like i currently do in the uk . 
  however , a friend of mine told me it is not the same in switzerland and that different rules apply for eu citizens . 
  it 's a joke . 
  the french government in general has not been very kind towards regional languages . 
  at least we are n't france ... 
  it just says out of london , not out of the uk . 
  last time i heard they were [ planning to move to birmingham ] ( http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/business/finance/hsbc-reaffirms-birmingham-move-speculation-9108761 ) . 
  what i 'm trying to say is what / u/clashoftheash said  i think what he 's trying to say is that the spanish public do n't take any heed of it but the british do . 
  everytime something minor happens with gibraltar you can see how / r/unitedkingdom gets up in arms while / r/spain does n't give a fuck ( or meneame the spanish reddit ) . 
  i was talking about the article , which [ was posted first to / r/unitedkingdom ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/33c1i3/gibraltars_sovereignty_must_be_defended_from/cqjh1sr ) and then here . 
  and what about [ diego garcia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diego_garcia#deportation_of_1971 ) ? 
  yet it 's always the british redditors who post these things in / r/europe, 
  which was probably adulterated in italy and contains not olive oil at all . 
  i like how they talk about `` the mediterranean diet '' as if every mediterranean nation eats the same . 
  also , they seem to imply that spanish people do not eat much meat , which is far from the truth . 
  no that is [ this one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ciudad_real_central_airport ) . 
  i do n't see how is this going to work with valencia airport being so close to this . 
  still better than [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qbu3tyr.jpg ) . 
  so that 's why it is spain and not france the one who is building the high speed train in saudi arabia ? 
  you are taking this too personal and to be fair spain gdp per capita is still ahead of yours and it will take a miracle for you to to overtake the gdp of spain . 
  i 'm not sure if you are aware of it , but we are the 5th biggest economy of the eu . 
   spain in gdp per capita when we are actually overpassing italy 's this year would n't be considered a bad thing for us ... just a good thing for you i was n't aware of this . 
  the gdp per capita of italy is greater than spain and the population of italy is greater than the one of spain ( more than 10 million ) . 
  i think he is talking about london as a whole . 
  argentina was n't a democracy when that happened . 
  it 's hypocritical because he said [ this ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jun/20/jimmy-carr-tax-david-cameron ) about jimmy carr . 
  most people have left already . 
  so i really doubt it . 
  i work in it in london and while i do start at 9:00 i 'm always leaving office around 17:30 like most people . 
  in fact , in my current job we only work 7 hours a day , so i start at 9:30 . 
  if you think that 's bad try the [ chilean accent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=almmdw2_fns ) . 
  would n't have been able to understand half of it otherwise . 
  i think # 50 in the uk is not that expensive . 
  a jean in zara will be around # 45 and in top man the cheapest i think are # 35 . 
  levis and diesel can easily be # 100 or more . 
  [ basque separatism is not doing very well at the moment ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2016/03/11/actualidad/1457698284_566725.html ) . 
  i means someone who does n't think like you and probably votes for the popular party . 
  still better than belgium .
