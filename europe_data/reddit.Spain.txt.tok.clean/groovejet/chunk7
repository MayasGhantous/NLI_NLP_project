  however , it does n't have the dome . 
  edit : [ another picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oenizgx.jpg ), 
  somebody send this to anne igartiburu . 
  i 'm confused because i read [ the opposite ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/cologne-only-three-out-of-58-men-arrested-in-connection-with-mass-sex-attack-on-new-years-eve-are-a6874201.html ) not long ago . 
  it is relevant since all spanish speaking countries have their say in rae . 
  they decided the name was `` ye '' because it makes more sense . 
  in per\u00fa , where i was born , everyone call it y-griega and most of my spanish speaking friends do as well . 
  the only time when i called it `` ye '' was when i was in university and i was doing any mathematical operation where there was a variable called `` y '' . 
  a couple of years ago the rae decided that the correct name would be `` ye '' . 
  yes it was the same one . 
  the verb `` tuitear '' and the noun `` tuit '' are accepted by the rae , though . 
   why are you ` at ' the park but ` in ' the city ? 
  i never understood this one . 
  i know . 
  but i have heard way more people saying `` haiga '' than `` murci\u00e9galo '' . 
  having said that i just checked and apparently it was added to the dictionary on 2012 . 
  i remember it was added in the 90s , but taken away in the next edition . 
  it is funny how those words are accepted , but `` haiga '' , which is used a lot in the andes , is not . 
  but that how the language has evolved . 
  `` f\u00fatbol '' is the same logic applied to `` football '' . 
  for instance this [ new verb ] ( http://dle.rae.es/?id=asr6h3k ) has been added to our dictionary recently . 
  why would we use one word ? 
  they are prepositions that have different meanings and it is not as confusing as in/on/at in english . 
  that happens all the time in spanish . 
  some years ago , when the word `` solo '' could be replaced by `` solamente '' it should have an accent and be spelled `` s\u00f3lo '' even though it was against the accentuation rules . 
  however , [ that is no longer the case ] ( http://www.rae.es/consultas/el-adverbio-solo-y-los-pronombres-demostrativos-sin-tilde ) . 
  still they 're not as bad as `` g\u00fcisqui '' . 
  apparently psoe did n't know about this . 
  i do n't think you have anything like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzmuyqmaqcw ) in the anglosphere . 
  what i like about it is that you can open and close curly and angle braces with the same hand . 
  i agree with the '' / '' . 
  i usually use the one on the numpad . 
  the ' comes very handy when you are a software developer . 
  [ indeed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0os5qecxp6s ) . 
  i do n't know much about him , but i 've seen that he is [ sympathetic towards lgbt issues ] ( http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/06/22/sadiq-khan-is-first-mayoral-candidate-to-sign-pride-in-london-pledge/ ) , which makes me think that he is a secular muslim . 
  if anything , i think it will be positive towards the image of muslims in the uk . 
  ok , but you ca n't deny there is a [ controversy ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/valencian_language_controversy ) about it . 
   they were part of pp up until 2013/14 i believe ciudadanos was founded on 2005 . 
  try telling that to someone from valencia . 
  this is the one thing we did n't want to happen .

  i think there is still some difference between junts pel si and the polisario front . 
  same in spanish , but mainly because `` inglaterra '' sounds much better than `` reino unido '' . 
  i still have n't flown with iberia express , but i will consider them next time i travel to madrid . 
  t4 is so much better . 
  the other thing i hate from t123 is that the metro station is so far away from the terminal door . 
  i disagree . 
  i flew with them lgw - mad return and in both legs the planes departed late , there was none of the food they advertised in their menu , not even one of the sandwiches , and the wifi is so slow that is barely usable . 
  i find easyjet way better and usually their prices are lower . 
  on top of that , the web check-in is not very user friendly . 
  i was not able to get the boarding pass , i got a document that then i had to scan at their kiosks on the airport to print my boarding pass . 
  i 'm flying with them to stockholm in a couple of weeks , so i hope their service is better this time, 
  if you want something spanish you should try [ pulpo a feira ] ( http://www.amc.info/uploads/images/pulpo.jpg ) . 
  it 's delicious . 
  however , being half peruvian i have to say that the [ tiradito de pulpo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mbmb4dd.jpg ) it 's even better . 
   octopus is very common in general til octopus is considered bizarre . 
  you forgot [ this gem ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3mlo15/catalan_separatists_win_majority_in_regional/cvg2u6b ) . 
  i feel this headline has been rehashed several times for the past 10 months . 
  [ the majority of the uk public supported the foreigners list ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/foreign-workers-list-poll-yougov-amber-rudd-plans-immigration-a7348821.html ), 
  fancy a [ paella sandwich ] ( http://trucoslondres.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/paella-inglesa.jpg ) mate ? 
  ( it even has chorizo ! ), 
  i love lasagne . 
  the only problem in restaurants is that you have to wait ages before you can eat it before burning yourself . 
   cotoletta oh so that 's how you call [ milanesa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milanesa ) in italian . 
  i was in milan a couple of months ago and i was wondering what was the name . 
  well , at least this one did n't have chorizo in it !, 
  wimbledon railway station also has around 16 trains per hour to waterloo , so even their suburban service are turn up and go . 
   personally , i feel like that 's a failure of british planning law being completely paralyzed to be able to build the new infrastructure needed between housing , roads , transport , etc. . . and that 's an internal problem and that 's a completely separate issue from the whole eu thing in the first place . 
  but hey ... i 'm not a briton and have no vote . 
  this . 
  whenever they try to build something new there is always a riot . 
  just look all the problem they are having to build a new runway in a london airport . 
  one of the big pulls of the uk was the salaries that you could get working on it . 
  if the pound keeps falling and the economy begins to suffer from brexit then the ability that the uk had to attract talent will also diminish . 
  [ \\ ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 \\ ) ] ( http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/05/14/russian-eurovision-stars-secret-adult-film-past-revealed/ ) indeed . 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  i was actually born in per\u00fa and while my mother is spanish my dad was born in peru from peruvian parents and he is like me . 
  tall , blue eyes and light brown hair . 
  in fact , [ almost a third of the latin american population is white ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_latin_americans ) . 
  keep in mind that there are a lot of countries in the world that speak spanish . 
  just because they are speaking spanish it does n't mean they are from spain . 
  #yurops livin ' a celebration !, 
  [ argentina is white !, 
  ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/844/277/399.png ), 
  but the pope has no authority on spain . 
  he is not part of the spanish government . 
  he is mentioning the fact that your head of state is also the head of the church . 
  spain is also a constitutional democracy , but our head of state is not head of the church . 
  some do and it is always cheaper than the airport . 
  poland is bolivia . 
  this is a bit simplified , but i think it is because if you are going to have free movement of capital and goods then the people need to be able to move where the jobs are being created . 
   orban is not stupid to start a referendum he knows he wo n't win . 
  wish cameron had been as smart as him, 
  i 'm visiting riga in two weeks . 
  this may come in handy . 
  i thought we were playing the telegraph , not the daily express . 
   these migrants actually cry when they found out there were in bulgaria !,
