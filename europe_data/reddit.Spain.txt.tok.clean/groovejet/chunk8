  i guess you could say that freedom has a cost . 
  i live in the uk ; _ ;, 
  it 's $ 1.16 for a pound . 
  it was $ 1.40 a year ago . 
  specially portuguese spoken in portugal . 
  brazilian portuguese , in my opinion , is easier to understand . 
  in the english speaking world mediterranean diet basically means `` olive oil '' . 
  [ the healthy mediterranean diet ] ( http://portuguesediner.com/tiamaria/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/francesinha1.jpg ), 
  is the uk really that inbred or is just an stereotype ? 
  i 've always been curious . 
  just do n't do it on the railway track . 
  voltorb uses self-destruct . 
  it 's super effective !, 
  sadly they do n't have a constitution . 
  this is the issue . 
  the media in the uk is now trying to create this story about the referendum succeeding because of a metropolitan elite that does n't understand the country . 
  the reason why it succeeded is because the eu has been used as an scapegoat for ages and people believe all the lies that they have been told . 
  when you see the videos where people say why they voted leave you can see that they actually believe that the eu is the cause of all their problems and not the government at westminster . 
  is way lower . 
  a friend of mine told me i could rent a flat for myself for $ 700 . 
  here in london i pay # 800 ( $ 950 although used to be more ; _  plus bills and share with a friend and it 's supposed to be a very good rate since we are in zone 1 and close to a tube station ( vauxhall ) . 
  i can be wrong to be fair . 
  i had just read [ this article ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36642560 ) . 
  i 'm working at the moment in london , but depending on how things unfold i may have to leave and berlin is a city that has always caught my attention . 
  i know the salaries are lower , but i also have heard that the cost of living is also very low . 
  even more when you compare it to london . 
  lower than in spain ? 
  you are comparing munich to madrid . 
  i think most it jobs are in berlin , which is considerably cheaper than munich . 
  what do they have against high buildings ? 
  i 'm not talking about skyscrapers , but buildings of flats with less than 10 storeys like in many european cities . 
  but does n't dublin suffer from a huge urban sprawl ? 
  and ferrari has so many cars and it can not afford to have one laying there without being used !, 
  i 'm sure they 'll beg you to use it !, 
  thanks for proving my point . 
  the problem is that you are assuming that they are making a decision based on correct facts . 
  the eu referendum is being won by the leave camp with ads like [ this ] ( https://media.guim.co.uk/02b230449f750df147b3f85fa7ce060bae0b325a/494_0_3002_1801/3002.jpg ) which only appeal to emotion . 
  edit : [ another ad from the leave camp ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wfvhbvt.jpg ) . 
  because i think that new members of the eu have to obligatory adopt the euro . 
  after seeing the uk referendum i do n't know think that would be a good idea . 
  most people in latin america consider america just one continent . 
  they 've been trying for decades and they still only fill one of the many criterias they need to join and that is if no country uses its ban against turkey joining the eu . 
  to be fair [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/miscddc.png ) looks like a more plausible outcome for future enlargement of the eu . 
  it 's things like this that have put the leave vote ahead of the remain . 
  [ that 's what they say ] ( https://media.guim.co.uk/02b230449f750df147b3f85fa7ce060bae0b325a/494_0_3002_1801/3002.jpg ) . 
  but it 's the eu that 's undemocratic !, 
  i do n't think it would happen . 
  the problem is that there are a lot of people in her party that hate her . 
  i remember a thread in / r/food about someone who made paella from chorizo . 
  someone from spain told this person that that is not actually paella and he got downvoted to oblivion . 
  it 's cultural appropriation , do n't you know ? 
  life expectancy in spain - 81.66 life expectancy in usa - 79 [ source ] ( http://www.geoba.se/population.php?pc=world&amp;type=15 ), 
  after the comments on the post about spain , i do n't think the slovenes will be happy about this . 
   if `` white men '' are 30 % of the population but 90 % of the london transport board , then there 's probably something going on . 
  no , not automatically discrimination , but it 's worth looking into why that is . 
  for the record 60 % of london is white . 
  it is only `` white british '' who are less than 50 % , 45 % to be exact . 
  could n't they just take a valium ? 
  they always reminded me of the ones from [ lima ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wyupivhzoyu/tgr0lr3t8pi/aaaaaaaaaci/7mlmyudctty/s1600/lima.jpg ) . 
  we can make an airport for them in exchange . 
  i thought the issue was that china was creating artificial islands to expand its territory on the south china sea . 
  you heard it here first guys !, 
  the spanish economy of more than a trillion pounds is kept afloat by the money of 300 thousand british pensioners !, 
  yes i agree with you on that one . 
  i do n't wan na start a rant about the quality of the housing stock in the uk . 
  but i always wondered why things like double-glazed windows are such a rarity here . 
  i have no problem with houses in small cities . 
  it is just in london where you see places like rotherithe , which is just next to canary wharf where a great deal of the population work , that have small terraced houses . 
  i do not think that big skyscrapers are the solution , but mid density flats like you see in paris or madrid would help with the housing crisis . 
  i always hear people saying that we should build in the greenbelt , but who wants to live so far away from the city ( and put more strain in london 's public transport ) . 
  the idea would be to get more people living on the same amount of land . 
  i never understood the obsession with gardens in a country like britain where the weather is so terrible . 
  the first place i lived in london had a huge garden and it was such a shame that most of the year you could not use it . 
  which is why their obsession with tiny houses with big gardens is something i do not understand . 
  i am happy living in my flat , i much prefer having a terrace . 
  hey , but at least you got a garden that you can use when the weather is not shitty . 
  in london that would be # 750 and not even central !, 
  i would n't say that the difference between [ spain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ranked_lists_of_spanish_municipalities#by_population ) and [ germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cities_in_germany_by_population ) is that bad considering that they have a larger population . 
  there are countries that have it much worse . 
  i prefer the more compact design of spanish cities than the urban sprawl that you see in the uk . 
  in london it is just crazy . 
  you see a lot of terraced houses close to the city centre and yet they complain about how small and expensive their houses are . 
   in south america i 'm quite sure those were the aztecs and not the incas . 
  is n't this the grand paris express project that was announced some years ago ? 
  has something changed ? 
  i have always found paris very expensive and i live in london . 
  the only time when it was reasonable was during 2015 when we had the # 1 = $ 1.40 exchange rate . 
  damn you brexit ; _ ;, 
  as far as i remember macron is 173cm tall , so putin is still shorter than him . 
  i agree with you on that and i do not think it is something recent . 
  better looked people tend to get treated better and have better opportunities , that is why is a good idea to look after yourself . 
  but is n't macron a bit short ? 
  ** revise trianon !, 
  too lazy to kill someone obviously . 
  what 's the unofficial one ? 
  i have seen one from la sexta , which was bad and another one that was so-so . 
  it 's the third one i have seen from spain and its as underwhelming as the other two . 
  unless you are building an airport, 
  it 's the olive oil , have n't you heard ? 
  because you got phonemes that we do not have in our language .
