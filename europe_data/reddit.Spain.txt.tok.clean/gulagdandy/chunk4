  a number of eu states have made public declarations of support for catalan independence , including [ your own country ] ( http://m.ara.cat/en/danish-parliament-independence-catalonia-spain_0_1360664024.html ) ( assuming it 's denmark ) , [ latvia ] ( http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/4143709/20130913/the-prime-minister-of-latvia-does-not-see-an-issue-in-recognising-catalonia-if-it-reaches-independence-in-legitimate-way.html ) , and [ ireland ] ( http://english.vilaweb.cat/noticies/the-irish-parliament-hears-the-catalan-government-on-the-process-of-independence/ ) . 
  i do n't know about radical . 
  there 's * a lot * of islamic immigrants where i live ( barcelona ) but they 're not particularly belligerent . 
  they tend to live in a few specific neighborhoods and ( those that ate first wave immigrants ) do n't integrate all that much . 
  there 's some tension between them and locals , which is to expect because of the sheer number of people coming here and the vastly different culture , but i do n't think it 's as bad as they 'd make you think . 
  i do n't know if that 's what you were asking really , but that 's all i can say from my perspective . 
  tl ; dr : lack of integration by the immigrants , casual racism and distrust from the locals , it will get better with time ( it arguably has already in sone aspects ) . 
  i 've only been to : - spain ( duh ) - portugal - france - uk - germany - italy and that 's about it . 
  only 6 countries and i 'm most definitely not happy about it , but money is tight . 
  i do n't know ... 
  i 'm told it 's very hard to get past your customs . 
  i do n't want to live on this ~ ~ planet ~ ~ country anymore . 
  yeah , i suspect we are not this kind of spaniards . 
  interesting , this particular cheese you talk about is very similar to a galician cheese called [ tetilla ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tetilla_cheese ) . 
  tetilla means little tit in spanish ( titty ? ) . 
  and while we 're at it , i wan na try this bilingual thing you got going on . 
  oh come on , we have wine aisles in spain too , 
  it 's up to you really . 
  you could eat it as dessert with wine , that 'd be good . 
  if you want an authentic spanish experience i recommend eating it on top of a slice of [ pa amb tom\u00e0quet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pa_amb_tom\u00e0quet ) , the recipe ( simple as it is ) is like a national treasure ( at least in catalonia ) . 
  soumission is good , not his best though . 
  i 'd say is less controversial than it seems ; the most politically incorrect ideas in the book ( and the most unlikable by far ) are his misogynistic views . 
  my personal favorite of houellebecq is [ whatever ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58372.whatever ) ( original title * extension du domaine de la lutte * ) . 
  personally i ca n't get enough of roberto bola\u00f1o . 
  [ the savage detectives ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_savage_detectives ) ( los detectives salvajes ) is his most celebrated novel , and a good place to start with him . 
  i missed sergi p\u00e0mies and quim monz\u00f3 in your list . 
  pedrolo too could be there , [ mecanoscrit del segon origen ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/594399.mecanoscrit_del_segon_origen ) has that catchy post-apocalyptic theme that reddit would probably love . 
  i read it because bukowski recommends it in his novels ( who would 've thought , huh ? ), 
  and i liked it a lot . 
  it 's a bit dense at times but a great read nonetheless . 
  i 'll go ahead and assume those are low-paid temporary jobs for the summer in hotels and [ chiringuitos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chiringuito ) . 
  holy shit , so many cheeses . 
  i mean , i know france is famous for their cheese , but i did n't know there were * so many * of them . 
  i really need to come visit soon . 
  i love pecorino !, 
  not as good as parmigiano ( no shame though , parmigiano is just impossibly good ) but very tasty too . 
  if i could marry food , i would marry a good manchego curado . 
  a great spanish cheese missing from your list is menorca 's [ ma\u00f3 cheese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mah\u00f3n_cheese ) , if you have n't tried it go buy some now !, 
  well , it depends really . 
  galician language is really really similar to portuguese , while spanish with a thick andalusian accent will be harder to understand . 
  that 's one way to put it . 
  humility and a good sense of our own problems would be another . 
  though that does n't explain why we do n't do shit to fix them . 
  sadly , it has changed a lot for the worse since the year 2000 . 
  is it okay if i read this with fry and laurie voices ? 
  jail ? 
  are you kidding me ? 
  they have a fucking right to not vaccinate their child , even if it 's a dumb thing to do . 
  one of the best writings on the subject that i 've seen in this subreddit . 
  i understand your skepticism , but they really are right-wing , a sort of pp for the new generation ; take a look at that if you have the time : https://www.reddit.com/r/plazaaragon/comments/349pnq/desenmascarando_a_ciudadanos/ interesting links : - ciutadans has the same fiscal policy than faes , the pp think tank [ ( el pa\u00eds ) ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2015/04/27/actualidad/1430157707_524756.html ) - i\u00f1aki gabilondo ( well respected spanish journalist ) says [ ciutadans is pp 's white label party ] ( http://cadenaser.com/ser/2015/04/28/videos/1430202086_480989.html?ssm=14092012-ser-rs-1-tw%5b8%5d ) . 
  ciutadans is most definitely right-wing , with several former pp militants and higher-ups in its ranks . 
  i 'm at a loss here , but the colors tell me i 'm fucked ( which , let 's face it , i already knew ) . 
  can confirm , my grandpa did so . 
  he fought for the 2nd republic in the civil war , then went to russia to clear his name / return the favor to the francoist official that pulled him out of prison . 
  you 're either na\u00efve , dumb or fascsit . 
  what will it be ? 
  though i agree with most of your points , i can certainly think of situations where murder is justifiable . 
  also , a pretty solid argument against death penalty is that the choice of which crimes deserve it will always be arbitrary , and radical parties seizing power might make awful use of it . 
  andalusian ? 
  here in barcelona free tapas are very , very rare ; that being said i think the most common food to go along with beers are * patatas bravas * ( french fries with a special spicy sauce , for those who do n't know ) . 
  yep , can confirm . 
  spanish stereotypes are basically from andalusia . 
  bullfighting is forbidden by law in catalonia ... 
  i beg to differ . 
  the catalan government is not pushing towards it significantly , the topic is much less present on the news and in casual conversations , and the parties in favor of independence had to reach an unsatisfactory agreement for fear of losing overall votes for independence if elections had to be held again . 
  straw man argument . 
  this is clickbait . 
  the independence process is definitely stalled , partly because the catalan government was/is waiting for the new spanish president to be elected and this has stalled too . 
  anyway , i do n't think an offhand remark like the one in the article is really news worthy . 
  whaat , free riders , where ? 
  but really , i do n't know a single person in spain who thinks we should increase the military budget . 
  i guess our military is seen in the same light as our politicians . 
  which is to say , very bad . 
  it 's meant to show pp , ciudadanos and psoe on the same side ( complete rejection and unwillingness to negotiate with the catalan government ) and podemos on the other side . 
  the stand on the catalan 's right to vote would not be something particularly right or left wing in any other country , i 'd say . 
  and i disagree with what you say about podemos . 
  forming a goverment through pacts is not old-school politics , it 's how democracy works . 
  the problems with entrenched corruption and the electoral system are what 's meant to be tackled by the so-called regenerationists . 
  well , not the common people , no . 
  but let 's not pretend that hollywood and the tv companies are n't a great way to market the american way of life abroad . 
  yeah , no , of course , they 're not pro-independence ; i meant to show that they are more open to negotiate it . 
  there are many differences . 
  you are uneducated on this subject and at this point you 're just trolling to irritate me ( or whomever reads this ) . 
  and that 's a pretty stupid way to waste your time . 
  i think the allure of the us comes , in good part , from the massive reach of their cultural industries . 
  more than any other nation , the us gets to chose how the rest of the world views them , and we 're constantly bombarded by it . 
  spain is not mexico . 
  and you 're making an ass of yourself . 
  there 's more nuance to it . 
  that 's about the craziest thing i 've read on / r/europe . 
  we are not backward morons from the middle ages , thanks . 
  do n't get discouraged by / r/europe reactionaries , even them will have to come to terms with the current reality of the world at some point . 
  not sure . 
  north catalonia was never in the hands of the moors and it still has a fuckton of saints references , much more so than south catalonia which * was * part of al-andalus and , therefore , part of the reconquista . 
  i do n't give a fuck about my or any other country 's historical reputation , but that passive-aggressive exchange was very funny . 
  i 'm pretty sure that both -21 and -27 just feel like dying . 
  we are at +5 \u00b0 c here in spain and i 've developed a constant cold that wo n't leave me . 
  we write it with a \u00ef in catalan too ( ucra\u00efna ) , are we friends now ? 
  maybe , but i 'm from barcelona ... and most of my friends sang slightly different variations iirc . 
  i think almost every family sings a different version of the song .
