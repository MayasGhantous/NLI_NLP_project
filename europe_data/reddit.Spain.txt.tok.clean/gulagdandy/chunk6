  it 's incredible how greed and short-term benefits can blind politicians to such an extent . 
  i just hope that if podemos ever becomes the ruling party they 'll prove themselves more effective and loyal than syriza . 
  some people would like it , some people not \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af . 
  you would have to be very unlucky to run into problems though , i 've never heard of someone getting beaten or something for wearing political shirts . 
  obviously there 's people ( like me ) who would like a 3d spanish republic with many of the principles of the 2nd one . 
  i do n't know since this is a hypotetical scenario , but if people die it should n't be because we let it happen . 
  catalonia has voted a lot for ciu , yes , but podemos and psoe owe a lot of their sucesses to catalonia , and erc has been getting a lot of votes for quite some time now . 
  barcelona has also been ruled by left-wing parties for all but 4 years since democracy was reinstated . 
  huh ? 
  i 'm saying some structures are meant to be brought down ; i do n't particularly care about what happens to a decapitated franco statue but people tear down symbols of opression for reasons other than `` acting like emotional baboons '' . 
  what do you mean by that ? 
  the thrashing of the statue ? 
  if so , i would like to point you to [ this tweet ] ( https://twitter.com/airjag/status/789221233539817472 ) . 
  you 're entitled to your opinion , but you should be able to recognize whether you 're knowledgeable enough that this opinion adds value to the debate . 
  and in this case i think you 're way off base and the `` most likely '' implies a degree of certainty that is not warranted . 
  i 'm confused . 
  so you would just let them die ? 
  for starters `` he '' is a woman , and to be honest if you do n't really know a thing about the issue why jump to baseless speculation ? 
  not everything done in catalonia is an attempt to stir the pot or one-up madrid . 
  ah , so now you 're going to try to convince me that francoists do n't vote for pp ? 
  i honestly do n't think it 's possible to have lived for ( i 'm gon na assume ) decades in spain and not have seen a single spanish flag with the `` aguilucho '' , and reading your comments here i think you have an agenda and are not being honest . 
  take this with a grain of salt . 
  it 's true that catalan conservative parties have a history of siding with whoever has the power in spain , be it franco , the pp or the psoe . 
  but catalonia is one of the most left-wing regions in spain and of course one of the most effected by francoism with the whole cultural homogenization he intended . 
  it 's ok to have a dissenting democratic ideology . 
  fascism / francoism is not democratic and should not be tolerated at all . 
  lol are you serious ? 
  no `` pre-constitutional '' flags in your city ? 
  i 've seen them in my small town , in barcelona , in stadiums , in demonstrations ... 
  lol no , pp is our far right , right and center right all in one . 
  you 'd be shocked . 
  there are a lot of street names , plaques , statues , monuments , etc. 
  commemorating francoist generals or the man himself throughout spain . 
  nope lol . 
  the mayor 's party is n't nationalist is the catalan version of podemos . 
  i mean , this is purely speculative fiction right now , but if ( some ) people from africa are forced to abandon their countries due to temperatures rising to the point where it 's impossible to live there , would you really not accept them in your country ? 
  institutionalized corruption , unregistered economy , unhelpful legislation are the biggest issues , according to my highly subjective opinion . 
  institutionalized corruption being the worse one , though . 
  think about that : not only many of the higher-ups in the ruling party ( pp ) have been found to be corrupt , ** all ** the treasurers they 've had ** since their founding ** have been accused of crime or are in jail , and the party itself as an organization is being investigated for destruction of evidence and possibly more illegal things . 
  and of course that 's just the tip of the iceberg . 
  spain 's issue is that we were used to a higher standard of living . 
  we have good public education so there 's many qualified people that can apply for good jobs abroad , but here in spain jobs are few and far between and salaries are depressingly low . 
  they do n't have the means or determination to emigrate to germany . 
  i disagree . 
  this is seen as a slight to catalonia , more so seeing how the canary islands banned bullfighting 20 + years ago and no one batted an eye . 
  furthermore , this defiant response is shared by the two main left-wing opposition parties , psc and csqp ( podemos ) , both against independence and usually very critical of the catalan government , and only pp and cs accept it without reservations . 
  the catalan goverment has already said it wo n't accept the constitutional court 's sentence , and bullfighting will continue to be illegal in catalonia . 
  oh it 's booming all right . 
  just do n't ask about the economy . 
  in barcelona i eat good healty stuff for something like 12-15 $ a day . 
  then why should we implement austerity measures at all ? 
  yeah , but the central government can and does override the regional governments ' decisions when it suit them , which i think does n't happen at all in the us . 
  wert 's education reform took precedence over regional laws , for example . 
  and that 's when people start suggesting technocratic autocracies with no elections because they cause `` market instability '' . 
  yay for dystopias . 
  i do n't think religions are destined to die ; nor do i think they should . 
  and i say this as an agnostic , but this rising sentiment of contempt and disdain towards religion is misguided imo . 
  what is really harmful for society is the close-mindedness and reactionary ideas promoted by some religious leaders , but dismissing religion altogether belongs in that same camp . 
  yeah , gr\u00e0cia is definitely one of the cool districts in that sense . 
  sants has a similar vibe and is less well known too . 
  and el raval has cool nightlife despite being in the gothic quarter . 
  l'eixample and gr\u00e0cia still have a majority of local population but have gentrified a lot ; it 's common to hear stories of families that have lived in those districts their whole lives and are forced to leave because they ca n't afford rent anymore . 
  the gothic quarter and the areas close to the beach ( barceloneta , poble nou , born ... ) have become theme parks for tourists filled with airbnbs and outrageously expensive apartments . 
  thanks . 
  having read the article , it 's very cool that berliners are n't giving up on the city like we did in barcelona , or like it happened in london . 
  gentrification may be inevitable in the long run but letting the real estate market transform a city unsupervised is a real problem . 
  i 'm interested on reading this but i do n't have a suscription to ft. could someone give me a brief summary ? 
  we spaniards are very proud of our healthcare system , although neoliberal policies enacted by the current government are trying to shit on it . 
  alt-right is a way too fancy name for what basically amounts to reactionary millenials . 
  it 'd be kinda weird if there were no croats older than 25 . 
  i do n't know what kinda implications did you read in my comment but i can assure you there were none . 
  italian fascist warships bombed barcelona . 
  nazi air brigades destroyed gernika . 
  and franco 's side was `` fascist '' in the sense they supported an absolutist , nationalistic regime . 
  edit : oh , come on , how does this comment deserve 3 downvotes ? 
  happy independence day , fellow europeans !, 
  feels kinda weird to be older than a country tbh . 
  hey , well said . 
  i did n't think i cared much about this issue but you make a good point . 
  and i 'm tired of foreigners putting chorizo on all the spanish dishes . 
  i love our cuisine and i do n't even like chorizo . 
  us mediterraneans have more fun anyway ( do n't mind that i 'm looking to emigrate to germany ) . 
  i guess it 's ue in all of romance-speaking europe . 
  i called you a fascist because you expressed fascist views , i.e. 
  expelling democratically elected parties because they do n't share your ideas :  she is crazy and all her party is aswell . 
  they should be expulsed from the goverment . 
  i have n't said a single untrue thing , nor did i call you fascist because you disagree with me . 
  you 're entitled to your opinion and i 'm entitled to call you out on it being fascist . 
  pp and c 's are very nationalistic . 
  i 'm guessing most people do n't give a fuck ; i know i do n't . 
  maybe people living close to the border care a bit ? 
  i guess it 's only an issue for very nationalistic people . 
  it 's completely retarded too because the people of gibraltar had a referendum and staying with the uk won with 98.97 % of the votes . 
  but you know how spain is with people voting to decide their status in the peninsula . 
  wrong because i 'm from barcelona and i 'm for it , same as other people i know . 
  fascist because you want to illegalize parties just because they do n't share your ideas . 
  they * are * emphatically catalanists , but this is not an example of that . 
  you can disagree with their ideas but they are * always * consistent with their program and their beliefs , even when it would be much easier for them to claudicate . 
  so i take offense when you slander them and paint them as hypocrites . 
  there 's no prize for the most condescending comment in the thread .
