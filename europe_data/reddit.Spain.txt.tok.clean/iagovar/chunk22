  and if you look at the table , you can just see that they do n't match at all . 
  if a correlation is under | 0.4 | it will just be too weak . 
  so being in poverty or being shia can not predict the probability of being a suspect of crime . 
  ** now an explanation : ** this chart is showing you that somehow , crime , education and being muslim are connected . 
  it wo n't tell you why , but it 's telling you that : a ) more prevalence of islam in their country of origin means immigrants more prone to crime . 
  b ) more tertiary education enrollment in their country of origin means immigrants less prone to crime . 
  c ) prevalence of islam and prevalence of tertiary education seems mutually exclusive . 
  you either have a country with a high prevalence of islam , or high prevalence of tertiary education . 
  that as general rules . 
  as some of the data have questionable quality , it is possible that the order of the countries on the list , with good data , could change . 
  for example , it may be false that there are so many muslim iranians . 
  a redditor commented in the previous thread that he works with immigrants from iran , and they know that less than 30 % of them consider themselves muslim . 
  unfortunately i can not use that data , because it only appears in a reddit comment . 
  in any case , i do n't think the general conclusions could change much . 
  i 've been seeing other studies and it does not seem that what i have done has given some extraordinary conclusions , what happens is that the experts in this things refine the calculations much more , and they have their own language , that you have to know , to be able to read their papers . 
  1 ) there is strong ( in terms of how pearson correlations are classified ) correlation between the rate of suspects of crime , the % of muslims in the country of origin and the % of enrollment on tertiary education , also for the country of origin . 
  2 ) i ca n't say for sure if the prevalence of islam weakens the enrollment in tertiary education , or vice versa , but if i had to say something , i 'd say the former , not the latter . 
  anyway that 's just an opinion based on my lectures , not anything like structured gathering of information . 
  3 ) as far as i remember , german police warns in the pks reports about the problem of knowing `` what is what '' . 
  but they really need to explain how are they getting two tables not compatible with each other . 
  it would be better if they just release gross number , or the data they use to make such tables , because i found it very weird . 
  i 'd suppose that the table excluding foreign law crimes is the one which is bad , but that 's just based on my intuition of how they may classify their data , like incomplete reports , not well defined categories and so on . 
  4 ) anyway , it 's clear for me that some nationalities are more prone to crime than others . 
  i do n't think newcomers are less prone to crime . 
  i think that 's just an effect of inaccurate reporting . 
  i had problems calculating the rates without crimes against foreigner law , read this : http://iagovar.com/how-are-refugees-andor-migrants-in-germany-related-to-crime/#what_about_data_without_crimes_against_the_foreigners_law, 
  i explained why i could n't use the figures shown in the report . 
  read this : http://iagovar.com/how-are-refugees-andor-migrants-in-germany-related-to-crime/#what_about_data_without_crimes_against_the_foreigners_law basically , for some countries , given their report , we should understand that they commit more crimes if we substract those against the foreigners law . 
  it does n't make any sense . 
  so i tried to make my estimates calculating the average factor for each country , and the average factor for all countries . 
  here is how i made it : https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=52ebe14962f1c41a!7164&amp;ithint=file%2cxlsx&amp;app=excel&amp;authkey=!antedaak1i7zfne, 
  no , that table is only to see if there is correlation between population variation an crime variation . 
  the first and the last tables are the important ones . 
  mmm , it may be my english skills , but i do n't think i 'm understanding what you mean . 
  the correlation between two variables is stronger the closer is to | 1 | . 
  if you get a correlation like -1 it means that the variables are highly correlated but it 's a reverse correlation . 
  so when a increases , b decreases . 
  if you get +1 , it means that both variables are highly and directly correlated . 
  so when a increases , b increases too . 
  the last chart is done with bars and colors anyway , so you can visually understand what it 's happening . 
  as for the previous tables , those are suspects of crime for every 1000 inhabitants . 
  the higher the number , the more intense the red . 
  knowing this , a correlation of -0.5 will be higher than +0.1 because the former is closer to | 1 | , even though is negative , which only means that it 's a reverse correlation . 
  i linked to this in my blog , i think it 's nicely explained : http://www.statstutor.ac.uk/resources/uploaded/pearsons.pdf, 
  someone posted this in the first thread . 
  the problem is that they do n't explain where the obtained their data , nor provided explanation as how did they calculate their rates , so i can not replicate them . 
  it seems interesting , but if i ca n't download the files ... 
  not with me , but with him . 
  this is exactly what you did . 
  i liked it . 
  have my upvote . 
  do n't even try man . 
  according to this guys you are a facha . 
  i do n't play nice , neither you did . 
  and it 's like you did n't write this bs : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5klclu/spain_valencia_region_to_force_public_schools_to/dbpo53g/ you can spin it 100 times if you want . 
  totally justifiable for people like him . 
  there is no `` wtf '' involved , nor any fascist . 
  it 's you . 
  you have the problem , you saw my comment , which says nothing about denying transgender anything , but about how politics work , and you commented crying like a little baby because someone did n't reply to the polish guy saying : how dare you !, 
  you are a sectarian , like many others , that you can not bear people to insinuate that your worldview is not the only one . 
  it 's the same thing with the fachas , do n't worry , you 're not alone . 
  totally normal post , of course being downvoted . 
  i finished the new graph , it does n't change that much : http://iagovar.com/how-are-refugees-andor-migrants-in-germany-related-to-crime/#what_about_data_without_crimes_against_the_foreigners_law,

  completed, 
  nah , this is the typically leftist stuff to please their voters . 
  well , as seen in other stats , i 'm not really surprised . 
  hope it does n't become like the spanish mediterranean coast , ruined by money and tourism . 
  well , throwing a bunch of pearsons is not exactly what i call fancy . 
  well , download the workbook and make the model , post it here and we all going to appreciate the effort , 
  thank you !, 
  yep . 
  if i had time i 'll amplify it and throw everything in spss . 
  that 's not what it shows . 
  that 's data from the country of origin , there 's no public data about muslims/nationality inside germany . 
  i explained this in the blog post . 
  i took a look again , and only the pks 2015 has data without including the foreigner law offences . 
  so they only consider it relevant from 2015 and ahead . 
  the suspects rate by 1000 inhabitants for each year , from 2008 to 2015 . 
  it 's 2006 estimates , so yes , there 's a limitation in that . 
  anyway you just ca n't exclude the rest of countries . 
  i ca n't do everything myself now , but if you can find me a better table than [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_percentage_of_population_living_in_poverty ) i 'll use it in the next update . 
  i tried to gather better data but it was so scattered that it would be very time consuming for me . 
  hey thanks !, 
  i may do a series of post about european stats in migration . 
  i 'd probably use this one too . 
  sorry , i do n't speak german nor i can read it . 
  if you find it in english i could read it . 
  if you can find that report in english that would be a big favor , man . 
  what do you mean . 
  that 's skewing nothing . 
  if you look at the tables a clear outlier is iran , which i knew was majority shia . 
  so i wanted to see how shia played there . 
  shia % is what actually pew research tried to measure , so i used it . 
  being shia and sunni the two most important branches of islam , if you get a positive correlation with shia , you 'll get a negative one with sunni , so using sunni istead of shia does n't change much . 
  well , i did n't consider anything about eastern europe . 
  i just throw variables in the blender , and whatever ir comes out , it comes out . 
  poverty was a factor but it has no correlation to crime apparently , at least not measured as relative poverty . 
  if i download it in german i need to translate it later , which ads time to work . 
  anyway i barely remember this tables and i think i discarded them because the data did n't include citizenship .
