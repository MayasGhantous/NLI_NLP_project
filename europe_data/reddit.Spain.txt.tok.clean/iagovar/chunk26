  i think i 'm gon na order it . 
  well , at least hes trying to teach you something, 
  in my case , u/sayresth i always try to maintain myself challenged on ideas . 
  i dislike really strong intellectual laziness and confort , so i 'm always trying to navigate other communties , blogs , etc. 
  mmm ... this is clearly not a good idea ... 
  oh jesus , i could n't believe it when i entered r/altright for the first time, 
  so dissapointed . 
  what language do lizards talk ? 
   sabbateans lol , so what 's the end of the chain ? 
  or it 's more like a loop ? 
  tbh it only sounds like a rethoric to be confortable with yourself . 
  i am with you . 
  sadly , islam is behind the good savage myth when it comes to leftists , so they refuse to fight it , and they even come with comparisons with other religions to justify it . 
  wtf, 
  another gem https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo7mwuj7zla, 
  well , considering us salaries that 's pretty cheap is n't it ? 
  well , did you find any subreddit that is not an eco chamber ? 
  it may be that exercise then . 
  yeah , i know that mission . 
  idk man , i have a vague memory of the navy going to norway , but i ca n't really remember why . 
  maybe i 'm confusing it with a ship deal or something . 
  idk why people downvotes you , so here is my upvote . 
  heh , come to the north ... 
  it really looks spanish :d, 
  there 's nor completely free protection , everyone pays at least a bit . 
  not everyone can spend +2 % gdp , specially at this moment . 
  that 's too much blablabla but nothing tight , tbh, 
  isnt this role being covered by other european countries ? 
  i remember news of the spanish navy and guardia civil sending people over there . 
  so it 's possible to live with 500 $ mo ? 
  well , i suppose that poland is rather cheap compared to spain , so that is n't bad , is n't it ? 
  be prepared for our martian ibiza . 
  their yt channel : https://www.youtube.com/user/pldspace/videos, 
  are those figures per year ? 
  is there any wages distribution info like this https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5enhi4/spanish_wages_distribution/ in ine.pt ? 
  man it seems even more expensive !, 
  i 'm looking at continente now , it should be a cheap brand is n't it ? 
  well , that sucks , but i was just under that impression when i visited portugal . 
  do you have any online supermarket to compare prices ? , something like https://www.compraonline.grupoeroski.com/, 
  maybe a bit . 
  not rare to encounter wild animals in certain parts of galicia , por example . 
  that 's how we market ourselves , engineers for 20k , which is roughly 1400 mo , not really much for living in barcelona or madrid . 
  ft has paywall : /, 
  man , but how do you live there ? 
  i mean , imagine you want to have the bed , a desk with a computer , and make a bit of exercise . 
  it 's impossible . 
  and how do you go to the bathroom ? 
  do you take the ass out of the window to take a shit ? 
  i 'd suppose you do n't count spaces like kitchen , bathroom etc. 
  we say the american city model is broken , while we can barely pay rents . 
  make fuking skyscrapers !, 
  ( please not commieblocks ), 
  we should imitate their prices . 
  seems that many people is paying more than 1/3 of their salary in rent , which is not desirable . 
  imo , is amazing how renting is one of the main rent extractor and governments do almost nothing . 
  f example , why do n't we build more housing skyscrapers in madrid ? 
  seems we are obsessed with office space , which is cool but people paying lower rents means more disposable income in more hands , than just concentrating wealth in tenants hands . 
  that 's actually pretty low . 
  i pay 550 ( with garage ) in a 250k city in spain . 
  considering wages , you may be paying less than me . 
  is that real ? 
  i may be not getting the joke, 
  is that even possible ? 
  most things are a bit cheaper than spain , or it seems so, 
  hello ? 
  someone talked about concrete business ? 
  err ... are you sure ? 
  what did you notice ? 
  spain infrastructures are good in general , and the state makes a continuous effort on road safety . 
  nothing surprising . 
  maybe if you explain a bit more i can tell if it 's a new phenomena or not . 
  yep , but we need more details . 
  if he had ties then there might be an explanation , and thus stuff to explore and extract conclusions . 
  if not , well , we ca n't prevent that a guy from bavaria gets converted to islam . 
  as an spaniard , having an executive body with so much power like the european comission , specially when they are not elected by the people , is very strange . 
  i suppose that for most parlamentary-system countries is something similar . 
  if they want to get more popular support they either get popular vote there , or transfer from a presidential-like system to a parlamentary one . 
  what the fuck ? 
  how is this even possible ? 
  had he any cultural attachment to the middle east , muslim relatives or something ? 
  or was he recently converted . 
  we need a risk profile . 
  beautiful !, 
  it 's in the limit between \u00c1lava and burgos , so we could also say that it 's in castilla y le\u00f3n .

  the angeles alvari\u00f1o is an actual research vessel , not any undercover shady stuff , from the spanish institute of oceanography . 
  http://www.ieo.es/flota i really would like to see how [ this ] ( http://www.ieo.es/documents/10640/27153/angeles+alvari%c3%b1o/e95517c9-0607-4628-b48e-c1db1bb92177?t=1384249251000 ) has been doing `` harassing maneuvers '' . 
  i 'm just saying it does n't make sense . 
  there is so much information bias in that infographic that is just not useful . 
  every nato country has it 's own bases , none of them displayed there . 
  it 's just for circlejerk . 
  this is better : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5f4psx/nato_bases_in_eastern_eu_members_prior_to_crimea/dahhg1r/, 
  this comparison makes no sense . 
  exactly , this is nonsense . 
  basically every national military ? 
  does n't have greece any base ? 
  i re-learnt over time how to do things properly . 
  i 've learn that the simpler you make things , the better . 
  most people do n't have any understanding of advance statistics , and most complex visualizations i 've seen seem more abour proving to know something than being actually useful . 
  imho distributions are better without any fancy .
