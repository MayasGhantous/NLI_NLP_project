  yeah ... maybe we can have some dj 's also joining local police , or teaching in schools or faculties ... because people is just leaving . 
  prices are somewhat expensive , but it 's more or less doable going to the grocery store or having `` a normal life '' , but the housing marker is nuts . 
  i mean , you can rent a matress in a terrace for only 500 $ / month !, 
  well , i 'd follow from here . 
  thank you . 
  care to provide a link ? 
  i 'm curious . 
  is there any plan for public housing , but like , something serious ( large amounts of it ) ? 
  because afaik colau refused to enforce regulation on prices , so what 's the alternative ? 
  i mean , for the median salary in barcelona people would need rents about 500 $ / month ... 
  you are an instrument , like a dildo but for language, 
  but you know about the stigma that goes with bad pronunciation in spain . 
  a bit absurd , but it exists . 
  as i said before , barcelona is risking to become ibiza v2, 
  be careful because barcelona seems to be taking the same path as ibiza . 
  colau has to do something with the housing market . 
  just go and research a bit about ibiza , to see what happens when you do nothing for years while prices keep increasing . 
  now in ibiza many businesses , despite having increased salaries , can not hire people because no one can find a place to stay and/or can not pay the prices . 
  it 's an accurate description . 
  do n't get me wrong , barcelona is cool , but any place that becomes very touristy in the long run turns to a bad place to live . 
  example : the madness in ibiza . 
  i have family there , and i love the island ( outside tourist season ) but man , those prices ... the services ... is just awful . 
  they are not ... yet . 
  it 's just a matter of time when they become an important spot for fishing votes . 
  hahah i knew this was coming, 
  you have to ask to frenchies , they are the ones who tried ( do n't know their sucess ) the 35h workweek . 
   why most published research findings are false a friend of mine worked in physics in aveiro and he said that it was the best enviroment to work that he ever had . 
  sadly he could n't stay more because of money issues . 
  and he 's no amateur , he 's been working in a bunch of well named universities and cern . 
  well , i 'm happy with it , at least not everything is fucked up in this peninsula . 
  20 hour workweek ? 
  lol man you are daydreaming, 
  you basically went into a lot of assumptions for the sake of confirmation bias , knowing nothing about me . 
  you also downvoted me , so honestly i can only think that you are a bit miserable , considering that i do n't share most of the thoughts you 'd supposed i have . 
  there was a nationalist guy in tv3 fantasizing about china defending them from some agressors ( may be spain , do n't remember ) in exchange for building stuff in barcelona 's port , a few years ago . 
  it was funny to see . 
  valencians got rid of pp so there 's that ... 
  even when we rage about how stupid we sometimes become , i see this sub as an oasis of calm people smoking on pipe . 
  if i open my fb account i only see people throwing bricks at each other , basically the same on meneame.net ( the spanish reddit-like site ) . 
  i do not even bother to comment on the spanish media , and its comments section . 
  irl , i think i can only have open conversations about whatever the topic with 2 friends . 
  everyone else seems so personally attacked with everything one may say , that i usually keep my opinions to myself unless i think it is important to intervene . 
  one might say that it 's like people is no more open to discussion , but it 's not even that . 
  i find most people even hostile to different ideas . 
  like they can not even keep it civil . 
  is this only my perception , or is more people noticing the same thing ? 
  i 'm sure everyone knows the sensation of being in fb , twitter , reddit or whatever the media , reading news , and not being confident if those sources are trying to push an agenda , or simply reporting . 
  i 've studied migration for my grade , but it was too centered on spain and latin america , so i did n't really know what to think about migrants , refugees etc on germany or other european countries , so i decided to look for data about it . 
  ## suspects / 1000 inhabitants ( germany ) thanks to @bmi_bund on twitter i 've done this table about number of suspects by 1000 inhabitants in germany : http://i.imgur.com/dderut9.png i can see a trend here , but anyway , it seems to be declining , which does n't fit the narrative of immigration = crime . 
  ## correlation between foreigner population variation and number of suspects so i calculated correlations between the number of suspects and the variation of different migrants in germany , resulting in this one : http://i.imgur.com/jnexerj.png ## crime vs muslim background vs poverty vs education but i still did n't find confident about it , so i tried to put more variables in the blender , such as the percentage of muslims or shiite muslims , relative poverty and the percentage of the population in tertiary education in the countries of origin . 
  this is the result : http://i.imgur.com/9upozcd.png *** i made my own conclusions in [ my blog , where in addition you can download the excel workbook ] ( http://iagovar.com/how-are-refugees-andor-migrants-in-germany-related-to-crime/ ) . 
  i 've done it pretty fast , so i may have made mistakes , and i also admit that the graphics are not very refined ( titles and descriptions could be better ) , but i did not want to invest much more time in it either . 
  if anyone has doubts , check the calculations to see if they are okay . 
  in the blog i already explained that there are some problems with the original data , and the report of the german police has many more things of which i have used , if someone wants to lurk around . 
  updated thread : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5kxjd9/are_refugees_andor_migrants_really_linked_to/, 
  [ i recently published this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5k9ut4/are_refugees_andor_migrants_really_linked_to/ ) in r/europe on this topic . 
  in the +200 comments there were all kinds of questions , so i 'm bringing you this update to answer many of them . 
  as before , if you want to see a little more detailed what i have done , visit the [ blog post ] ( http://iagovar.com/how-are-refugees-andor-migrants-in-germany-related-to-crime ) . 
  ## what about data without crimes against the foreigners law ? 
  your chart includes violations against foreigners ' law , and that is unfair , because they are mostly illegal entry and stay . 
  that penalizes the refugees . 
  [ read in the blog ] ( http://iagovar.com/how-are-refugees-andor-migrants-in-germany-related-to-crime/#what_about_data_without_crimes_against_the_foreigners_law ) this is the chart that excludes such violations : http://i.imgur.com/tn1ukt3.png in general it is similar to the previous one : http://i.imgur.com/dderut9.png and this is ** the new correlations chart ** : http://i.imgur.com/mu5izkd.png ## why are shia muslims being counted , and not sunnis ? 
  because it 's the data pew research has , and because if you have a positive correlation with shia , you will have negative correlation with sunni . 
  if you look at wikipedia how a pearson correlation works , you 'll understand why it does not change anything . 
  i did it mainly because the case of iran seemed an exception of the rule . 
  ## what about socio-economic status and other variables ? 
  there was a discussion in the comments on whether it was better to use other or not . 
  it 's possible . 
  if you read a bit about crime you will see that scientists have tried to cross all kinds of variables to see the result . 
  however , that will require more time , because those data are usually published in papers , not in time series that you can download in easy-to-work formats , so it complicates things , i can not spend too much time on this . 
  i 'll let you know when i have something . 
  ## what is to be german ? 
  what is to be syrian ? 
  as mentioned by some germans in the previous post , what counts here is nationality . 
  if you are a second generation immigrant , or if you have dual nationality , you count as german . 
  apparently , there are no public records on ethnicity or any variable that allows us to segment better . 
  ## what does it mean that the trend does not fit the narrative ? 
  muslim countries have a much higher crime rate in your table . 
  it was a totally subjective impression . 
  when i did the first table i observed that the ratio of suspects per 1000 inhabitants was decreasing for the last two years , and for that reason i made another table that tried to find out if there was a relation between the population variations and the number of suspects . 
  anyway i did n't understand this complaint very well , it seems as if someone had been angry because i did not have the same prejudice as him , or something like that . 
  especially since it does not affect the calculation or the conclusions at all . 
  with the new table , excluding offenses against foreigners ' law , there is no longer a decreasing ratio for the last two years , which is amusing , because i am supposed to do this table excluding these crimes to `` fit an agenda '' and `` whitewash '' these crimes . 
  sometimes you have to understand that not everyone has an agenda . 
  sometimes people just want to be honest . 
  ## where are you getting the religion , poverty , and education data from ? 
  everything is explained in the blog , either the origin of the data or the problems they have . 
  one of the comments said that he did n't understand the percentage of muslims for iran because he worked with iranian immigrants and knew that less than 30 % considered themselves muslims . 
  there 's a link to pew research in the blog where they explain how they calculate this data , and the problems they have with it . 
  in addition , we have to take into account that these data are relative to the countries of origin , not to the immigrants in germany . 
  there is no public data , as far as i know , about the religion of these immigrants , how poor they are or what education they have . 
  someone may find scattered data about some variables , with surveys , but those data are very difficult to cross with the ones provided by the police , and they usually only give you a chart with pretty colors . 
  in any case , if 30 % of iranian immigrants consider themselves muslims , that might explain why iran is an outlier on my chart . 
  ## is your poverty data about syria updated ? 
  no , the figure is about 2006 , i did n't find anything better . 
  anyway , if i change the poverty value from 11.9 % to 100 % ( assuming that the whole population is poor ) , the correlation between suspects and poverty grows from 0.238 to 0.3672 , it remains weak . 
  if you download the excel workbook and play with the data , you will see that changing the value of syria has no significant effect . 
  here the charts : https://www.ipsos-mori.com/assets/docs/polls/global-advisor-feminism-charts-2017.pdf here the tables : https://www.ipsos-mori.com/assets/docs/polls/global-advisor-feminism-tables-2017.pdf, 
  [ removed ], 
  i think it does , but i 'm not sure tbh , i have vague memories about my cousin doing it there .
