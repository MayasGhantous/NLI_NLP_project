  idk in other countries , but in spain that 's free . 
  if you are foreigner you also get covered with `` basic coverage '' , which idk how far it gets . 
  if you are european citizen you get full coverage though . 
   you have good support when studying so most people can afford to rent without many problems : / in spain , even working you have problems . 
  i consider myself a privileged here ... and i 'm 27 . 
  most of my friends are living in shared flats or with their parents . 
  that 's more or less an standard here : http://www.simyo.es/, 
  satellite is crap man . 
  that 's totally normal . 
  i thought the us bureaucracy was faster . 
  many foreigners complain about it so ... maybe british notice the difference . 
  look at this : https://www.reddit.com/r/spain/comments/3s63o8/i_hate_living_in_spain_im_leaving_good_item_for/, 
  in france a bit . 
  spain is nice but the career opportunities ... that 's why im moving to freelance with foreign clients . 
  and how about wages ? 
  because if you earn , say , 12k month well , that manageable . 
  where did you go man ? 
  i 've been in france many times and i did n't notice them that slow . 
   it 's only a matter of time until the pc police reaches us yep . 
  i do n't loose hope . 
  i do n't want to have my wall with that kind of videos and people complaining about safe spaces and everything . 
  look at this german , trying to hide his total submission to kebab . 
  we like it rough , but if someone wanted it , we have socialized lube , recycled and eco-friendly . 
  really ? 
  because i pay a lot . 
  it 's true that i 'm an employee and `` aut\u00f3nomo '' ( freelance ) at the same time but , really , i 'm seriously considering moving to portugal or somewhere . 
  we have other priorities . 
  without lube . 
  is there any good resource to research where to live in portugal and average expenses ? 
  i wo n't mind to move there . 
  i had to earn so much to not be angry paying 1500 for rent . 
  i do . 
  and i have 14 pays . 
  i do n't know why i do this , i talk about annual salary just sometimes . 
  is that germany ? 
  i expected it to be much higher . 
  are u mad or what . 
  run if you can . 
  actual statistics do n't show that . 
  usa is the country with the most healthcare expenditure and they do n't really have that good coverage ... 
  a guy told me he payed 1500/mo for rent in san francisco . 
  an it was n't even expensive as far as i remember . 
  that 's my entire month salary , dude . 
  and i pay 550 for rent . 
  definitely jealous . 
  oh come on , olive oil for that ? 
  are you kidding me ? 
  do you want us to send the fucking spanish army to your house ? 
  movistar outsources almost everything , so you know , the only control that is really going on is that they do n't become expensive . 
  the guy in charge of them choosed `` the boss '' as nickname in the internal chat app , and replies every answer of the outsourced employees rudely , so he can think he 's a genius because of them not being engineers and not having privileges to access internal documentation . 
  so by this way they make the customer service a hell for the clients and employees , making clients think twice before calling , and many of them moving to other companies before dealing with the customer service . 
  so this way movistar saves money on calls and fixed prices in outsourcing and sends problematic clients to other companies . 
  it 's sad , but that 's how it really works . 
  movistar do n't give a fuck about the typical low-budged low-expertise clients . 
  i have to research it , because being self employed here is just a pain in the ass , and portugal seems a cool place to be . 
  my clients are allways foreigners so that might be a good idea . 
  that would be funny , seriously . 
  and off topic , how is it to be self employed in portugal ? 
  is it that bureaucracy nightmare as is it in spain ? 
  because i live in galicia and , you know , just cross the borders ... 
  that 's the everyday of a customer service . 
  he probably thinks that internet explorer is the actual internet . 
  i work for one of the largest isp in spain and probably europe , and the president of my company ( a 70 years old ) wants google to pay for using our network . 
  so i wo n't be surprised if that was someone thinking it for real . 
  the spanish military swear to the king to fool foreigners . 
  it wo n't be as easy for you . 
  we have tons of alcohol waiting for your troops , so in case you raise a threat here even a bartender is suitable as opposing force . 
  so clever . 
  that 's what happens when you have 70 year old 's making policy . 
  you can copy the russian strategy in ukraine and the `` german soldiers on holidays '' will be a credible argument !, 
  the secret of jam\u00f3n , but we protect it with a hundred tortillas , so by the time the spy finish the tortillas he 's done and can not continue his mission . 
  czechoslovakia is a bit out of place , is n't it ? 
  is n't it also an adjective ? 
  thank you , i appreciate this kind of comments . 
  at least you are in the map . 
  galicia just dissapeared . 
  same with spain . 
  estrella galicia has lots of awards and is not in the map . 
  and cursing in english souds a little bit pussy . 
  hahah , that 's the right one !, 
  some things may be familiar to me , but seems more a latin american thing . 
  beers for example are clearly not spanish . 
  anyway i do n't blame them , it 's a business . 
  what 's the name of the franchise ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caldo_gallego more or less basic , but just great for winter . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pa_amb_tom%c3%a0quet sometimes in the morning . 
  i put more garlic than usual . 
  gazpacho or salmorejo , both very enjoyable in summer . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gazpacho https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salmorejo queimada for gathering people : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qonci27koig tortilla espa\u00f1ola ( kind of omelet with potatoes , more or less juicy , with tiny pieces of ham ) , empanada ... 
  i have tons of favorites man , i just love food xd you have a much longer list here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_spanish_dishes, 
  that 's another problem , because we have a lot xd . 
  the most marked is paella , but it 's only a valencian thing . 
  i 'd have to do a list , and i do n't thing that 's what are you looking for . 
  they expected you to say that you have been learning syrian !, 
  :p you have to learn how to trick germoneys !, 
  another galician here ? 
  how many are we ? 
  maybe . 
  the ones i know abroad put 0 effort in cooking well and marketing . 
  that 's sad .
