it was my understanding he just posted a text someone else had sent him , with maybe a few adjustments . 
  given there are different versions on different languages it would be interesting to find who wrote the original .

  a guy who always has felt out of place and is still trying to figure out what to do with his life . 
  my loved ones , my hobbies , and having an easy life . 
  tl ; dr they want to avoid another protest like the one that happened on 25/09/2012 - https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/rodea_el_congreso, 
  it might no be the prettiest , it might not be the most interesting , but , by jove , i miss living in brighton very much . 
  kinda . 
  it used to be a thing in spain a long time ago ( i remember my mother used to invite her friends to a cup of coffee and some cake ) but it 's falling out of favour . 
  i 'll venture to guess it is because the country is becoming less religious so no one cares about the petty stuff any more . 
  people do still congratulate those who have a `` popular '' name ( antonio , francisco , carmen , pilar ) , mostly because on those dates there is usually a bank holiday or a festival somewhere , but almost nobody remember the less known ones . 
  manchego , actually . 
  but for some reason i do n't like really hot or bright weather . 
  or spending too much time outside . 
  i might be half-mole . 
  i like it there . 
  i find it more civilized than my country in many aspects . 
  and i do n't mind the weather . 
  the original james bond novels . 
  just finished the sixth . 
  i 'm finding it really amusing how the tone has slowly shifted from the gravitas and introspection of casino royale to the ` villain giving speeches ' and ` hot dumb companion ' tropes in doctor no . 
  [ tulicrem ] ( http://www.yofuiaegb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/tulicrem-crema-chocolate.jpg ) , a chocolate spread that was pretty popular in spain until it disappeared in the nineties . 
  ah , i still remember that buttery taste ... 
  there is a very similar brand in portugal right now but the recipe is not the same . 
  the best known paper magazines in spain are the 40 year old veteran [ el jueves ] ( http://www.eljueves.es/ ) , and the newcomer [ revista mongolia ] ( http://www.revistamongolia.com/ ) . 
  for those in the know , there 's also the [ tmo ] ( http://www.tmeo.org/ ) fanzine , which is usually even more brutal than the other two . 
  online the most popular one is [ el mundo today ] ( http://www.elmundotoday.com/ ) , which is basically the spanish version of the onion . 
  in spain there were protests , demonstrations , and they even burned a few vehicles . 
  eventually , uber was banned because it really did n't fit with the current laws ( and the taxi lobby is too powerful ) . 
  a month ago it came back as uberx under a different legal formula ( licensed private chauffeurs ) that another company , cabify , is already using . 
  but the taxi drivers have been protesting about this as well , even though less strongly since it 's technically legal , so we 're not sure if they will be successful this time . 
  mostly , yes , but it 's not just the quantity . 
  it 's also the temperature ( some people want the milk steaming hot , others cold , many will want half and half ) . 
  and there 's the amount of sugar . 
  if they want sugar , because there 's always the one who asks for a sweetener instead . 
  and others take it with condensed milk , instead of regular one . 
  or a bit of alcohol . 
  or for some reason you like `` americanos '' , which is just coffee and water . 
  and then a lot of people drink decaf . 
  but then the decaf can be espresso or instant ( i actually like it instant , it 's less bitter ) . 
  and maybe it 's summer and you want a glass with ice for it . 
  but not a frapp\u00e9 , which is an entirely different thing . 
  not to forget all those who want a herbal tea , which is not coffee but it counts for the joke . 
  or black tea , which instead of water some people steep in hot milk with a bit of cinnamon powder on top . 
  so , yeah , it is a bit ridiculous . 
  that 's a pretty complex question . 
  there are probably as many definitions of being spanish as there are spaniards * . 
  politically it 's all pretty vague since the end of the dictatorship , which made the love for the country and the flag kind of a taboo . 
  culturally , and probably because of what i wrote before , people feel more identified by their region than by the country as a whole , except for things that are universally accepted like don quijote and the like . 
  * there is a common joke in spain that says no two spaniards have coffee the same way . 
  it makes fun of both the ridiculous variations of coffee we have , and how diverse we can be . 
  our civil war was a left vs right issue , and you can still feel that divide in the population , although to be honest right now i do n't think it 's actually any worse than the labour/tory one in uk , or the democrat/conservative one in the us . 
  you do hear every now and then things that call back to those times , like politicians or activists calling their opponents `` commies '' or `` fascists '' . 
  also , since the conservative side won , i believe there is still a subtle fear among some people that the left parties will revolt one day and take their revenge . 
  we are very communal . 
  and since so many of us live in blocks of flats with paper-thin walls , we actually do n't have a choice but to get on well ( or at least politely ignore each other ) . 
  since when ` europe ' means ` germany ' ? 
  because the article is entirely based on that country 's criminal justice system and current circumstances , but then the guy just drops an ` and the rest of europe ' nonchalantly without providing one example to support his point . 
  not that he might not be right , but as far as i know each country still has their own different system and attitude . 
  i 'm not an eurosceptic , but it kinda stings that this guy thinks germany can speak for all the rest . 
  i 've got used to watching movies in the original language , and now i ca n't stand spanish dubbing . 
  even when it 's a language i do n't speak at all . 
  the thing is , our dubbing used to be good , or at the very least decent . 
  old dubbed movies are still mostly watchable . 
  but apparently in the 90s there was a big crisis in the dubbing world that wiped out a lot of the studios and the quality has been in decline ever since . 
  big budget movies are probably not that bad , but tv shows are simply horrendous : completely out of sync lip movement , mistranslated jokes , voices very far removed from the pitch and tone of the original ... 
  it 's awful . 
  psoe is actually open to it , but only if podemos drop the issue of the catalonian referendum , which to my knowledge they do n't want to . 
  i would be really surprised if they reached an agreement on the matter this fast . 
  the big news here is that podemos is actually considering an alliance with psoe , which seemed to have been out of the question until now . 
  regarding iu , they have been antagonized by podemos for some time , and though it would not be the first time iu reaches an agreement with a party they do n't entirely agree with in order to secure a government , specially if it 's a left-leaning one , i do n't think they will forgive it all without asking for something in return . 
  i 'm pretty sure there 's a ton of people who does n't give a toss about classical music the rest of the year and yet they do n't miss this concert . 
  this country will never cease to fascinate me . 
  that makes more sense . 
  the elections are pretty close and sending troops , specially to a region almost nobody here has in mind , is too politically charged right now . 
  even if we agreed to it , there 's no way it would be announced before the new government has been formed . 
  ai n't that the truth . 
  well , the acting was really stiff at times , the dialogues sounded pretty unnatural , and the overarching plots were all over the place , but it was mostly entertaining ( the lope de vega episode was fun ) and i guess this is the closest we will ever be to a spanish doctor who . 
  besides , i do n't think we have had anything resembling science-fiction since pluton brb nero . 
  i can list you the few that have been done in recent years ( this is not a country for genres other than sitcoms , period pieces , and cop shows ) , but i ca n't exactly recommend them because i do n't think they are particularly good . 
  the first three were made by the same production house , globomedia , and have a similar look and feel . 
  they are also targeted to a young-ish audience , so do n't expect a spanish true blood there : * [ el internado ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/el_internado ) - spooky things happen to a group of youngsters and their carers in a boarding house . 
  * [ el barco ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/el_barco_%28tv_series%29 ) - an accident with a particle accelerator ( sic ) wipes out most of dry land , and a group of youngsters in a boat need to learn to survive . 
  spooky things come from the sea . 
  * [ luna , el misterio de calenda ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/luna,_el_misterio_de_calenda ) - the story about the inhabitants of a town where spooky things happen . 
  * [ los protegidos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/los_protegidos ) - a series about a family that harbors and protects children with superpowers . 
  it 's a show for kids , mostly , so it has bad fx and cheesy plots . 
  * [ el castigo ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/el_castigo ) - a miniseries about a reeducation camp for youngsters where they are abused . 
  not exactly horror , but it 's horror-adjacent . 
  as a bonus , i should mention [ vis a vis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vis_a_vis_%28tv_series%29 ) , a women 's jail drama with pretty dark tones and a much more adult target audience in mind than the others . 
  spain does not have many great tv shows , and most of them are very culturally targeted anyway ( so outsiders might not understand most of the references and jokes ) , but i can recommend a few things : * [ crematorio ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/crematorio_%28serie_de_televisi%c3%b3n%29 ) , a mini-series about corruption in modern spain . 
  highly recommended . 
  * [ gran hotel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grand_hotel_%28tv_series%29 ) , a downton abbey-esque drama set in that same period although with a more serious tone . 
  it 's on netflix ( at least in some countries ) . 
  * [ polseres vermelles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polseres_vermelles ) , a show about the children 's wing of a hospital , that was unsuccessfully remade in the us as ` the red band society ' . 
  * [ el hombre y la tierra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/el_hombre_y_la_tierra ) , an amazing 70s nature documentary by naturalist f\u00e9lix rodriguez de la fuente , who is dearly missed . 
  there have also been recently a bunch of period shows of varying quality that might interest you , if you are into that , like ` el tiempo entre costuras ' , ` velvet ' , ` isabel ' , ` victor ros ' , and others . 
  and we are at the top ten . 
  of course we are .
