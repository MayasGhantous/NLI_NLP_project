  no , because they are discussing how the burger is called in france , and the spanish name is still different from the french one : a ` cuarto de libra con queso ' vs a ` royale con queso ' . 
  i 've seen the movie so of course i know that line but in spain a ` quarter pounder ' is called ` cuarto de libra ' , which is a direct translation ( and the term they used in the spanish dubbing ) . 
  the funny thing is very few people use pounds as a weight measurement any more , so most customers have no idea what the burger is about . 
  the spanish word for that is ` conde ' . 
  and yes , that would be one . 
  the others are ` grande de espa\u00f1a ' ( grandee of spain ) , ` duque ' ( duke ) , ` marqu\u00e9s ' ( marquess ) , ` vizconde ' ( viscount ) , ` bar\u00f3n ' ( baron ) , ` se\u00f1or ' ( lord ) and a couple of more obscure ones . 
  none , it 's just that if they want to use the title publicly ( like in documents and such ) they have to pay taxes . 
  but that 's all , it 's basically a vanity thing . 
  a few of them are or have been fodder for gossip magazines , but that 's pretty much it . 
  nobility titles in spain are a symbolic thing that over time have been stripped of all privileges . 
  in fact those who have them need to pay taxes to use them , although that 's usually not a problem because , unsurprisingly , they tend to be wealthy . 
  in spain , aside from the fact studying is usually a full-time job , there 's another reason : legally kids can not work until they are 16 , and at that age they can only be apprentices . 
  but they are not many apprenticeship jobs available ( or ordinary ones for that matter ) , so even if we wanted to do that it just would n't be possible . 
  the only kids i 've ever met that worked were the ones whose parents had a business ( bar , store ) and they helped sometimes . 
  definitely [ tulicrem ] ( http://yofuiaegb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/tulicrem-crema-chocolate.jpg ) . 
  it was a chocolate spread made by a margarine company , and the result was basically a kind of chocolate butter . 
  it was much less smooth than nutella and its spanish clone nocilla , but it was delicious . 
  it 's been almost 25 since i last ate some but i still can remember the taste . 
  now there 's a portuguese spread with a very similar name , but it 's not the same stuff . 
  in spain you can find a bit of everything ( homeopathy , chiropractics , herbal remedies ... you name it ) but the one thing that sometimes i ca n't believe still exists is the use of healers to cure ` evil eye ' and some other ailments . 
  there 's not much to explain about it : it 's part of a wide range of superstitions intertwined with religion ( curing ` evil eye ' usually involves prayer ) . 
  in spain baseball caps are generally not regarded as an everyday hat but as something you wear when you are spending too much time in the sun working or practicing some sport . 
  in fact , most spaniards do n't wear hats at all . 
  that is not to say there are not people that do actually wear them ( like , for instance , urban youth , older people or some latin america migrants ) , but chances are if you do we will automatically see you as a `` guiri '' ( slang for `` tourist '' ) . 
  i 'd like to point out that we say ` oriente medio ' because of the english influence . 
  the rae and newspapers style guides say the correct term is ` oriente pr\u00f3ximo ' . 
  our good ol' dictator francisco franco was obsessed with freemasons and considered them one of the country 's worst enemies ( i 've read it was out of spite because he tried to join but was n't allowed , although lord knows what was really going in that man 's head ) . 
  freemasonry was persecuted to the point of nearly extinction , and all the comments he made about a ` jewish-communist-freemason international conspiracy ' trying to topple the regime turned the whole issue into a joke . 
  after franco died spain 's freemasons remained quite secretive so in most spanish minds they are short of an urban legend . 
  i got ta confess i do have read a little bit about the issue because i 'm a sucker for secret organisations . 
  i also watched a documentary from some years ago about spanish freemasons , which was a big deal at the time because of all the secrecy , although they seem to have opened more since . 
  all in all , it 's an interesting topic although it does n't make me want to join it . 
  i 'd say mainly these two : * [ the 2004 madrid train bombings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_madrid_train_bombings ) , which were our own 9/11 and played a part in a government change shortly after . 
  * [ the 2008 financial crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%e2%80%9316_spanish_financial_crisis ) , which hit us really hard and still feel today . 
  honorable mentions : * the [ anti-austerity movement in 2011 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-austerity_movement_in_spain ) , which did n't achieve much but was the seed of new grassroots groups and parties that are shaping the political landscape now . 
  * the abdication of king juan carlos and the crowning of his son [ felipe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/felipe_vi_of_spain ) in 2014 , which was a historical date but , if we 're being honest , really did n't affect us plebs in any significant way . 
  i 'd like to point out there are two kinds of second-hand clothes stores . 
  the regular kind , used by people who just do n't have much money , and the hipster ` vintage ' ones , which can actually be as expensive as a normal store . 
  funny enough , i 'm pretty sure there are clothes that could easily be found in both . 
   do you think your government is doing enough to tackle it , and how are they proceeding ? 
  well , the government has [ an action plan in place ] ( http://www.mapama.gob.es/es/cambio-climatico/publicaciones/documentacion/cle_ene_pla_urg_mea_tcm7-12478.pdf ) to fight it but at the same time they came up with a [ `` sun tax '' ] ( http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2015/10/spain-approves-sun-tax-discriminates-against-solar-pv.html ) that discouraged the use of solar panels . 
  all in all i think they are not doing too bad but i 'm pretty sure there 's plenty of room for more . 
   is climate change denial prominent at all in your area ? 
  not really , although the current prime minister himself denied it when he was not in power yet ( luckily [ he 's changed his tune since ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/ciencia/2015/11/30/565c8b2d46163f3c428b464d.html ) ) . 
  i think at most there 's certain indifference , and a lot of ` what can a person do ' excuses to not get involved . 
   how do you feel about climate change ? 
  a part of me thinks we 're doomed already . 
  another part holds some hope we can contain it before it 's too late . 
   what do you personally do ( if anything ) to be environmentally friendly ? 
  recycling as much as i can ; using public transportation or just walking whenever possible ; limiting my energy consumption ; not buying shit i do n't need and buying local when i do need it . 
  it 's certainly not much but i hope to do more in time . 
   edit : also good morning good morning to you too, 
  in spain it 's becoming quite common among people from all walks of life to have one or two small tattoos . 
  too big or too many and it 'll be considered trashy ( unless you are hot and can pull off an ` alternative ' look ) . 
  personally , i 'm not interested in them : not a fan of gratuitous pain and expensive commitments i might regret or stop liking some time afterwards . 
  yes , quite . 
  there were news reports and everything . 
  an it still is , at least among veteran players ( there 's a lot of gym shuffling ) . 
  in my city we have a good bus system and an okay tramway . 
  there is also plenty of short-distance trains , so all in all we are well connected . 
  bike lanes are a joke , though , and cars are still essential if you work outside the town . 
  spain as a whole has decent public transportation but it can only help you to a point , so if you move around a lot you 'll most likely end buying a car . 
  it 's not like that in spain . 
  our cars are usually not very big , places are not as far apart as they can be in the states , and you ca n't just camp anywhere . 
  cars are a mean to get to the place where you will spend time together , not the place itself . 
  that said , family road trips are more common , particularly day trips to visit something in particular ( the zoo , a park , a museum ) and making a few stops along the way -- no camping , though . 
  also , i 've met a few people who have visited half of europe by car , either by themselves or with their partners . 
  a few companies and services ( parking meters , public transportation , vending machines ) have been offering that option for some time in spain but i do n't think they are used much . 
  recently some banks have been trying to introduce the new systems ( apple pay and the like ) but so far they 're not very popular either . 
  right now the fastest-growing new payment method is contactless cards and i have the feeling they will become the standard in the near future ( they do n't require to buy an expensive modern phone and are extremely easy to use ) . 
  my parents , who live in a town house , have it in a separate utility room . 
  i , who live in a city apartment , have it in the gallery ( a balcony that is right next to and accessed by the kitchen ) . 
  not by choice , the apartments were designed like that , although it 's not like there 's room anywhere else . 
  as i said , in spain it 's treated as a * rule * , to the point it 's often not the others who tell you it 's okay to start , but you who have to ask for * permission * to do it . 
  and , even so , many people will feel guilty if they do . 
  it 's just a ridiculously big taboo . 
  when it 's a large group we do n't wait for the whole table to be served either , but social custom dictates you do have to wait for the people closest to you ( left , right and front ; basically , those within conversational range ) . 
  in spain there 's an unwritten social rule by which you can not start eating until everybody 's been served their food . 
  it 's supposed to be good table manners , and it makes sense at home , but i find it really stupid when you 're in a restaurant : group orders usually can not be served all at the same time , and in that minute or two you 're waiting for the others your own food might get cold . 
  still , it 's a big taboo , and people often feel the need to ask for permission to start eating before the others . 
  not really . 
  most people do n't care who owns the rock . 
  almost all arguments come from the water territorial disputes , the tobacco smuggling , and the fact gibraltar is a tax haven . 
  if none of those things happened , and the rock was just a quiet colony , nobody would give a toss . 
  for spain i guess a good answer would be `` picaresca '' . 
  it comes from a [ literature genre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/picaresque_novel ) that `` depicts the adventures of a roguish hero/heroine of low social class who lives by his or her wits in a corrupt society '' . 
  it 's a word often used when talking about the not exclusive but very spanish habit of trying to cheat your way through life . 
  i love those movies . 
  it 's a shame we have n't explored surrealist and absurd humour more . 
  it fits so well with this country 's circumstance . 
  people do it all the time in spain . 
  not high brow debates , for sure , but we love arguing about politics . 
  of course , depending on who your friends are and how public your profile is your posts might be more or less tame , but in any case an employer ca n't just fire you because you 've posted something they disagree with . 
  i think we 've become a little bit more prude over the past years . 
  anyone remember the old fa ads with topless ladies ? 
  i do n't think they would broadcast them now as happily as they did in the 80s . 
  i might have had the measurements confused . 
  after all , i do n't drink . 
  do n't forget to mention you can also ask for `` un botell\u00edn '' , that is , a 33cl bottle of beer . 
  i 'm pretty certain by the time i was 16 i already did n't believe at all , but i could n't admit it to myself because , well , i had been taught not believing was a very bad thing and i did n't want to be a bad boy .
