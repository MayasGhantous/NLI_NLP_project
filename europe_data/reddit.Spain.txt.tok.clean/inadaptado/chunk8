  [ poinsettias ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poinsettia ) are also quite widespread . 
  * the holidays start properly on christmas eve ( 24th ) . 
  it 's a day to have dinner with family , mostly . 
  there is usually too much food , including king prawns , some baked fish or meat , and of course a bunch of traditional sweets like [ turr\u00f3n ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turr%c3%b3n ) , [ polvorones ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polvor%c3%b3n ) or marzipan . 
  there 's usually too much drinking as well , and after the dinner people fight , play cards , sing carols , or just end up sleeping on the sofa while the tv plays some very tacky gala . 
  the truly religious ones go to the [ misa de gallo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/misa_de_gallo ) , and young people go out and party . 
  * christmas day ( 25th ) is not very special . 
  traditionally it was not the day for presents , but cultural pressure has made it more common `` for santa claus to pay a visit '' and leave some toys for the kids . 
  some families have a special lunch and others just eat the dinner 's leftovers , which can be quite a lot . 
  it 's a lazy day in general . 
  * the 28th of december is [ the innocents ' day ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacre_of_the_innocents#feast_day ) , which is our version of april fools . 
  once upon a time even the public tv channels made pranks , but now it 's mostly internet jokes . 
  * on new year 's eve ( 31st ) some families also gather to have a dinner , which tends to be a bit fancy but not as much as christmas eve 's , and others just dine out . 
  our two biggest traditions are [ the twelve grapes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twelve_grapes ) ( which i find incredibly stupid and has made a lot of people choke ) , as well as the special tv show played by the public channel featuring whichever comedian is popular at the time . 
  those who can will go out after dinner , and it 's sort of a tradition to try and stay up all night . 
  those who do manage to stay up will go eat churros at 8am . 
  * on the 1st of january those who do n't work just get up for one ( or both ) of two things : the vienna philharmonic new year 's concert , and the new year sky jumps . 
  the rest of the day is spent nursing your hangover and wondering why the hell you insist on staying up all night . 
  * the holidays end ( finally ) on the [ three kings day ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/epiphany_\\ ( holiday \\ ) #spain _ and_latin_america ) ( january the 6th ) . 
  there are parades the afternoon before , featuring the three kings , their pages , some other bible-related stuff , sometimes santa claus as well , and maybe leftover floats from that year 's carnival if your town is not very wealthy . 
  the most famous parade is of course the one in madrid , which is broadcasted on public tv . 
  then the kids are told to go to bed because the kings are coming to bring them presents while they sleep , not before leaving some sweets for them as well as some water ( or carrots , or whatever leftover produce the family has ) for the camels . 
  and in the morning of the 6th the presents are opened . 
  sense does n't matter . 
  in this country we just sign up to whatever we see in american movies that sounds like a good excuse to party and/or sell stuff . 
  way too many `` real madrid ! '', 
  i mean , i 'm happy we are known for something other than flamenco and paella , but since i do n't like football the conversation always ends quite awkwardly . 
  in the south ( at least ) there 's ordinary barbershops , hipster barbershops , north-african barbershops , a ton of women 's hair salons , and now there 's dog hairdressers as well . 
  it 's getting ridiculous , but the manufacturers of hair products and tools must be making a killing . 
  screw all that . 
  i get my hair cut with a trimmer by my wife . 
  please , as if legality has ever stopped someone in this country from doing or hiring work under the table . 
  not in spain . 
  in fact , it 's not very common for high school students to work . 
  mostly those whose families have a small business or a farm so they have to help out . 
  summer jobs are a bit more common , but the law is quite restrictive with minors so it 's usually something casual and paid under the table . 
  spain is not the one to speak , we also had protests very recently because some people do n't accept the outcome of the last election . 
  circumstances are different ( a party ousted their own leader so they could allow their main rival to govern , which was kinda shady , while trump won quite cleanly ) , but the spirit is the same . 
  i for one understand the need of the people to express their disappointment , but i also think protests like this are useless . 
  i do n't think anybody here plays actual christmas music until well past december 1 . 
  however , i already saw some stores stocking [ turr\u00f3n ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turr%c3%b3n ) ( the traditional christmas sweet ) before halloween . 
  and i 'm pretty sure other stores are already selling christmas decorations ( we do n't have any celebration in between , like thanksgiving ) . 
  yes , but spanish and spaniard do not mean the same , so we have to be careful how they are used . 
  in spain : 1 . 
  the adjective is * spanish * . 
  the language is called * spanish * if you are using it in a neutral context , or if you are listing languages from different countries ( french , italian , english , ... ) . 
  however , it is called * castilian * in academia or if you are listing our national languages ( castilian , galician , basque , catalan , ... ) . 
  someone from spain is a * spanish * man/woman/person . 
  however , since that term is also used for people from latin-america countries we sometimes use the ethnic term * spaniard * instead to avoid confusions . 
  we were n't involved ( not officially , some spaniards did fight in it ) , so we do n't care much about it . 
  i mean , it 's taught in schools and all that , but it barely had any impact culturally . 
  things were not going well for the country at that time , so we had other things to worry about . 
  and this is the tl ; dr. 
  if i had included figures , the role of the minor parties , the concerns about unfair seat distribution , the catalonia issue , the ripples of the 15m movement , the press ' dirty war , and all the other stuff that has influenced the outcome , i would still be writing :d, 
  it 's quite simple , really . 
  for a long time we had a virtual 2-party system . 
  psoe , the centre-left party , and pp , the centre-right party , alternated in power . 
  but in the past elections two new parties threw their hats in the ring : the leftist podemos and the liberal ciudadanos . 
  a lot of people were tired of the old parties ( for many reasons , including corruption scandals and the financial crisis ) , so they voted for the new ones . 
  that meant votes were more spread , which resulted in that not only no single party could form a government on their own , but the two more logical coalitions ( psoe-podemos , and pp-ciudadanos ) did n't have enough seats either . 
  some other combinations were attempted , but clashing egos and irreconcilable policies did n't allow it . 
  so we voted again , but the result was basically the same . 
  after coalitions attempts failed once more because of the aforementioned egos and policies , there was increasing pressure on psoe to abstain and allow pp ( which had more votes than the others ) to form a minority govern . 
  otherwise we would have to vote a third time , and nobody wanted that . 
  the problem is that the psoe leader refused to give the government to their arch-nemesis . 
  so recently there was what a lot of people have called a ` coup ' , and that leader was ousted . 
  the new leadership agreed to abstain , and the pp candidate has finally become president . 
  now they have to rule with the only support of ciudadanos , and they will have to reach agreements with the rest of groups for almost everything . 
  i think this is the first time it happens , and there are betting pools on how long it will last ( i say no further than next summer ) . 
  serving alcohol to minors is a pretty serious offence in spain , so proper drinking places will card you if you look a bit too young . 
  also , after the [ botell\u00f3n ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/botell%c3%b3n ) became widespread the government increased fines for stores , so they have also become quite cautious . 
  that is not to say everybody respects it , though ; there 's always a hole-in-the-wall bar or a seedy store that does n't care . 
  no , but kinda . 
  if you are an immigrant that has achieved that legal status instead of someone born in a spanish family that can be traced back to medieval times we wo n't consider you less of a citizen . 
  we are all equal in the law and our hatred to politicians . 
  nonetheless , for most people you will still be an immigrant . 
  spain is an ethnically homogeneous country for the most part , and the big influx of migrants ( from latin-america mostly ) has been fairly recent , so they have not yet been assimilated in the same way as , say , indians are in the uk . 
  we are starting to have 2nd and 3rd generation migrants that were born in the country and are full-right spanish , so it will be interesting to see how things change . 
  i beg to disagree . 
  at any given point at least half the songs in the top charts are in english . 
  and i know you were probably joking but reggaeton is not nearly as dominant . 
  i 'd even say other latin music genres are more popular . 
  but i guess it depends on which stations you listen to , by choice or because that 's what your neighbours do all day long . 
  yes , i 'm talking about you , 3b and 4b . 
  buy you some headphones , for crying out loud . 
  in my patch of mediterranean coast the weather is usually mild ( with temps no lower than 5\u00ba and no higher than 30\u00ba ) , but for the past two or three years summers have been too hot for too long ( we 're almost in november and people are still going to the beach ) , and it has barely rained . 
  not really . 
  we do have people who move to the countryside and try to be self-sufficient , but normally it 's because they are fed up with city life . 
  i think they do n't last long anyway . 
  it did exist in spain at some point but they stopped selling it long before you were born . 
  definitely not in the south . 
  i 'm pretty sure that only happens there , maybe in asturias as well . 
  we probably are , but it all actually comes down to practical reasons . 
  since this is a pretty warm country , and not a particular rich one , we had to find ways to preserve some things as long as possible . 
  hence why we drink uht milk and [ torrefacto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/torrefacto ) coffee ; we pickle olives , garlics , and [ aubergines ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/berenjena_de_almagro ) ; and we cure ham and sausages . 
  i miss british milk so freaking much . 
  even if i had to make extra trips to the supermarket to buy half a pint because we had run out of it ( usually on sundays , why do you always run out of milk on sundays ? 
  prostitution is not illegal in spain * per se * ( there are some exceptions , though ) but it 's not legal either ( as in regulated ) . 
  it 's one of those things we consider it 's wrong but it 's so widespread and hard to deal with we choose to ignore it . 
  even during the conservative , catholic dictatorship it was consented in some places because local authorities did not dare take the weekly relief away from people who would probably became a nuisance otherwise .
