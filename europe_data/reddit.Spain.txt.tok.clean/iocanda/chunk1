really intelligent and practical people with lots of sense of humour . 
  looks like . 
  sure , why not . 
  you are so kind , thank you :d, 
  exactly . 
  i have seen bigger . 
  we often fill them with chocolate , whipped cream , etc. 
  they also can look [ like this ] ( http://recetasparapostres.com/postres/bunuelos-de-viento/ ) . 
  thank you so much . 
  nonono , be brave and link the pic with the just born piglet if you dare . 
  looks yummy to me , please write or link the recipe . 
  thank you , pet shop boy . 
  in spain they would be called [ bu\u00f1uelos de viento ] ( https://retceteras.com/2015/03/03/bunuelos-de-viento/ ) and they are fried in olive oil . 
  and the recipe ? 
  i will unveil the mistery of the same map for all ... 
  the satellite taking pics is just one for all the area , and it is called meteosat . 
  frigo is nestl\u00e9 . 
  it was a spanish brand but not any more . 
  good job , it is so funny !, 
  omg , you were bored indeed !, 
  actually , there is a third possibility : - you know nothing about italy . 
  and the swedish ? 
  norwegian exit ? 
  hmmmm ... are you saying they are bad because they are poor ? 
  i see as much corruption in the north as in the south . 
  in the north i see fascism too . 
  this happens in madrid too and i go ballistic . 
  the lack of civism is general . 
  i do not know if you mean this , but in spain we say `` despedirse a la francesa '' , `` say goodbye french style '' when someone sneaks out a place or gathering without saying goodbye . 
  i know that other countries have the same expression but always blaming the neighbours . 
  in spain we also say that someone is `` hacerse el sueco '' , `` impersonating a swedish '' when the are aloof , pretend they do not understand what is going on or a deserved reprimand or not cooperating with the group . 
  i hope you shake of laughter :d, 
  i just see trump . 
  you all love trump ? 
  ewwwh !!!!, 
  very good news . 
  no one intelligent wants to see a language die . 
  hard , hard , hard . 
  it relates to nothing you and i may know . 
  nothing . 
  you have to memorize every single word . 
  i speak some old basque my mom learend from her nanny 70 years ago . 
  her nanny , edurne , spoke basque because she came from an isolated rural area . 
  she actually learned how to read , write and drive at my grandparents home . 
  yes , like spain . 
  we could be rich countries selling our green energy , bro . 
  eeeewww my eyes !, 
  lol :d, 
  ayyyy i was being sarchastic . 
  how do you say perestroika in polish ? 
  in spanish we say perestroika . 
  i once had homemade rakia . 
  the rest of my life since then is in a nebulose . 
  yes . 
  it was a tradition in spain too , but now it is lost . 
  surprising . 
  in spain it is decriminalised too . 
  i think that percentaje is too low for us , however . 
  czechia whoa , what a wonderful surprise !, 
  i am sorry , i do not understand you . 
  maybe you would like to visit r/polandball ? 
  i hope i was able to help , friend . 
  norwegians are not stupid : https://electrek.co/2017/02/15/norway-electric-vehicle-market-share-record/ the close future . 
  fully electric . 
  hybrid is already ancient technology , make your mind , please . 
  vag , make your mind too : now or never . 
  i know my cars , particularly vag . 
  i also have a tesla on the way so please stop explaining to me that the earth is round , i already know . 
  ok , i am oversating the problems of changing a treasured and developed technology of 131 years . 
  if i were sure of what you are saying i would upvote or downvote you , who knows . 
  engine , transmission , location of the batteries , modification of the chassis because of batteries location , etc. , etc. , etc. 
  i can not believe you still do not see the difference , really . 
  how powerful and compelling reasoning you display . 
  no idea . 
  i am a woman , to start with . 
  you know , it is like comparing a diesel railway engine to the hyperloop . 
  naturally yes , i see massive differences in chain production of petrol engines and those of electric propulsion . 
  like you have to ditch or change lots of technology and materials , modify contracts , customers , providers , etc. 
  if that is not the production chain , let the downvotes pour on my sweet self . 
  go ahead , fight the other guy that i need to go to u/rarepuppers for a laugh or a hundred . 
  i disagree . 
  think about the production chains in all the countries , the new materials , engeneering , robots , workers ... all what they have invested in untill now must disappear . 
  it is now or never , believe me . 
  i have never said `` definitive referendums '' . 
  the 1st of october voting will be like the other votings , nothing , because it is planned to fail so your nationalist polititians can keep on sucking from a conflict that they created to that purpose . 
  yes , but polan can not into space . 
  this is pathetic . 
  i think they do not do publicity about their hybrids because they do not want people to buy hybrids because that would ruin their production chains . 
  i have seen some audi hybrid publicity aaaages ago . 
  thank you for explaining this carefully . 
  i however think this kind of policy is a huge mistake in the mid and long term . 
  ** catalonia can self determinate ** but spain has a word to say . 
  ** spain wants to vote too ** . 
  i think this is a wrong strategy in the mid and long term . 
  vag should be working like there is not tomorrow in changing to hybrid and electric ** soon ** or germany and europe will be in huge trouble . 
  because you have the right to decide if you want to lose part of your actual territories , including coast line and all kinds of stuff . 
  your question is like asking why the heck you should decide on how your neighbour in the same building paints the stair flight leading to his house in the common areas . 
  so when is it that catalonia catalonia will vote ? 
  because it seems that only fake catalonias have been voting . 
  this should have its own category in polandball , geez .
