what do you think about switzerland being a tax heaven . 
  what do you think about the banking secret ? 
  when you read in newspapers that some corrupt politician has millions in secret accounts in swiss banks , how does that make yo feel ? 
  serious . 
  actually i heard a little debate the other day ; should a blind person be a judge ? 
  of course , sorry . 
  oh yeah and gibraltar , and the canal islands . 
  anyway uk uses the point of `` those are independent territories '' , etc. 
  if they leave the ue they ca n't use the `` we have no sovereignty there '' anymore . 
  actually i think most of the controversy about many of the decisions in switzerland are conditioned by their banking and economic policies . 
  if uk acts as a tax heaven they will be probably seen in the same terms switzerland is seen . 
  is this guy real or he 's just acting ? 
  thank you so much for your time and your kind help . 
  this was very constructive . 
  have a nice day , cheers !, 
  i 'm a spanish native . 
  i speak good english ( c1-c2 probably , have n't tested it yet ) , and i 'll speak c1-c2 of french and german once i finish my studies ( in 3-4 years ) . 
  my first option is to be a freelance translator . 
  i 've also been working as a freelance translator for a little over 2 years , so when i finish my degree , i 'll have around 5 years of experience . 
  what would you recommend then if i want to be a freelance translator ? 
  do they ( freelancers ) work from home ( the eu sends them documents + deadline and they send them back ) or they have to follow some kind of schedule/rules like being present in any institution ? 
  damn , i 'm looking forward working as a freelance translator for the eu , this thread is like heaven for me . 
  i 'm studying modern languages ( french and german ) and speak good english . 
  once i finish my studies , i 'll start a master on institutions of the european union ( european law , etc. ) . 
  do you think that 's a good training to apply for the job ? 
  what would you recommend ? 
  ( other studies , courses , etc. ), 
  what are the minimum requirements to be eligible ? 
  ( years of experience , etc. ), 
  is the pay good ? 
  working as a freelance translator for the european union is one of my career dreams , if you could answer my questions , you would make me happy  ) cheers !, 
  i 'm seriously starting to think you 're stupid . 
  and i mean no disrespect , you might have a learning disability and if that is the case , i find you 're brave and an example to be using internet . 
  however , i 've pasted three , three fucking official statements from no less than the fucking president of the european commission . 
  people from sweden and portugal are telling you how wrong you are . 
  even a guy from barcelona . 
  and you keep saying no to all of them . 
  seriously , i hope you 're a troll because you ca n't be so fucking stupid . 
   it 's pure speculation now i get it . 
  lol . 
   if we become independent , we 'll probably sign in an addendum stating that we are now members on full rights . 
  serious question : where do you get these ideas ? 
  you 're a fucking joke , dude : http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getdoc.do?type=wq&amp;reference=p-2012-009756&amp;language=en december , 2012 . http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getallanswers.do?reference=e-2014-000796&amp;language=en february , 2014 . 
   i still do n't see the decree that would kick us out it 's literally not mentioned there . 
  it 's literally mentioned there , treaty of lisboa , article 49 . 
   not confirmed by any decree or official statement lol .

  i was gon na say `` eu members and allies '' but then i though , `` who cares , nobody 's gon na be such a nitpick '' . 
  i was wrong , it seems . 
  [ and eu-allies treaties are a fuckton to remember , really .

  i knew someone was gon na come up with this , lol . 
  i wanted to keep the message short and not get into technicalities . 
  however , and although said countries are not eu members , they 're closely related to the eu due to several treaties , have you heard of them ? 
  free movement applies only to eu members . 
  funny how they demand such right when they 're voluntarily leaving the union . 
  i want this to be true please please please . 
  who does she think she is ? 
  why does she think she can control eu funds ? 
  https://www.blick.ch/news/schweiz/sozial-irrsinn-in-hagenbuch-zh-wegen-einer-familie-muessen-wir-die-steuern-erhoehen-id3127699.html you can go directly to the article the daily mail links and read by yourself that nowhere on the article it sais the village budget is 1,500,000 pounds , and nowehere in the article it says the family eats up to one third of the village budget . 
  how come # 3,168 `` sounds roughly right '' when i pay around # 8,000 just in income taxes in spain , not even accounting for vat , and taxes and switzerland are much higer ? 
  and this does n't even account for private companies taxes , or federal funds . 
  wtf are you trying to demonstrate here ? 
  just say it directly . 
   an african refugee and her seven children cost the local authority # 40,000 in benefits every month . 
  that 's # 40,000 for 8 people a month , which , although the cost of life in switzerland is high , i would say it 's a very debatable number . 
  but let 's assume it 's true ( i think it 's a complete lie , but fair enough ) . 
  # 40,000 * 12 months = # 480,000 / year  village now forced to raises taxes as family take one third of annual budget # 480,000 * 3.3 = # 1,584,000 which would make the annual budget to be # 1,584,000 . 
  now , the village has 1,000 residents . 
  let 's assume only 50 % pay taxes ( and this is very generous ) . 
  # 1,584,000 / 500 = # 3,168 per tax payer for a year , which is # 264 for a month . 
  are taxpayers in that little swiss village paying # 264/mo . 
  in taxes ? 
  i doubt it . 
  and this does n't even account for private companies , which also pay taxes , and central government funds , which in someway , the village will receive i guess . 
  so , either the village does have a much bigger budget , the family does n't cost # 480,000 / year , or the village has a seriously big accounting problem . 
  disclaimer : i suck at math so i could be making huge mistakes . 
  if so , apologies .

  maybe i wrote it badly , i mean that it 's impossible for a family of 5 members to eat one third of the budget of a 100 people village . 
  i can say falafel very fast . 
   outraged : hagenbuch ( pictured ) , in the swiss canton of zurich , is understood to be spending close to a third of its total annual budget on the family after they arrived from eritrea in east africa three years ago i seriously doubt any village of 1000 people is going to spend one third of their budget on a single family of 5 members just granting them benefits , housing , etc , and if they do , they 're seriously doing something wrong . 
  yeah , up until this point everything seemed alright . 
  why ? 
  come on , the italian anthem is great , it sounds very cheerful . 
   of course after singing it at the start of the school day for six years of primary school , i 'll be quite glad to spend the rest of my life not singing it . 
  this is one of the things i wanted to talk about .
