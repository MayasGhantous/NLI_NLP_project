  is n't it a bit excessive to sing it everyday at school , before each baseball/basketball/hockey game , etc ? 
  to be honest , when it comes to anthems la marseillaise is like cheating . 
  yeah , i am haha, 
  country ? 
  britain ? 
  damn , this post is good . 
  you also sound a little republican , do n't you ? 
  `` may god watch over you ? '', 
  hey , every help is welcomed !, 
  i always see brits saying how much of a shit king charles would be , but britain is a parliamentary monarchy and charles ca n't fuck much up , right ? 
  basically he only signs bills and represents the country . 
  it 's not like you should learn the language in a fixed period of time , especially if you 're older and have kids/job , etc , but come on , learning the local language is minimum decency . 
  seems this was already known back in 2006 : http://www.dw.com/en/report-siemens-scandal-may-involve-top-executives/a-2249977 and it also seems that quite a few german companies have greatly benefitted from bribery in greece : http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/u-turn-on-u-boats-thyssen-plans-withdrawal-from-submarine-joint-venture-a-796474.html http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/complicit-in-corruption-how-german-companies-bribed-their-way-to-greek-deals-a-693973.html, 
  honest question : can any french redditor explain what have been the policies taken by the different french governments on inmigration ? 
  how has france deal with this problem during the last 20 years ? 
  because it seems to me that the country with more problems on this issue is france , by far . 
  inmigrants there seem more angry , more violent , less adapted to europe , and more prone to commit attacks . 
  it 's not that there are n't problems in other countries , like spain , but it seems to me that most of the radical islamists are especially pissed off with france . 
  the correct spelling is ` cocodrilo ' . 
  i do n't know if `` proud '' would be the word , but yeah , it 's really cool that spanish is so widely spoken and highly regarded , especially in some countries . 
  i honestly find easier to understand italian or french than portuguese . 
  i think portuguese is too fast and somewhat different to spanish . 
  this always shows up when talking about the rae , and even accepting that those words are an aberration , is unfair to blame the rae for it . 
  the rae does n't set rules ( only regarding to grammar , and in not many cases ) . 
  when it comes to the dictionary , they only pick up how the language is used . 
  and words like `` alm\u00f3ndigas '' and `` crocodilo '' , albeit incorrect , are fairly widely used . 
  another thing are loans from other languages , like whisky/g \u00fcisqui . 
  in spanish , words are pronounced just like they 're written , therefore , the supposedly correct form of whisky would be g\u00fcisqui . 
  as this is weird for everybody , they admit both spellings . 
  also , if i want to travel to santorini , how do i do it ? 
  travel first to athens and then to santorini by plane ? 
  by boat ? 
  how long does it take ? 
  and how much money ? 
   in irrelevant places for example ? 
   there has been some attempts by the turkish historian to discuss things , which armenians have been reluctant . 
  can you give me some more info on this ? 
  a basquian standing up for the spaniards , we 've witnessed history here , guys :d, 
  what about the armenian genocide ? 
  i 've been told it 's a taboo topic and if someone speaks about it in public they can get in trouble ( i 've been told this about orhan pamuk for example ) .

  ] ( https://periodicoelsolacrata.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/tolstoi_ln01.jpg ) pretty impressive group of russian writers in the last 200 years and i 'm leaving out lots of other good authors . 
  mostly , politics , as bullfighting is linked to conservatives and rightwingers ( with exceptions , obviously ) . 
  that 's stupid from any legal standpoint . 
  there is no such things as a `` natural right '' to anything . 
  - `` but hey , i have the right to life '' . 
  go tell that to a lion . 
  - `` but hey , i have the right to education '' . 
  go tell that to kids in africa . 
  the only rights there are , are the rights the power structures give their citizens . 
  plain simple . 
  thinking that because you are a human being you have rights is pure metaphysics and does n't make any sense . 
  two months ago , gays in america did n't have the right to marry . 
  now they do . 
  why ? 
  laws . 
  you have the rights the laws say you have . 
  saying that nations have rights because their existence is stupid . 
  - `` but hey , if catalonia wants to secede , they should be able to '' . 
  yes , but there are kids in catalonia who are not having three meals a day . 
  call me demagogue if you want , but some political leaders in catalonia are assuming they can secede only because they want to . 
  by the way , breaking the spanish law in the process . 
  - `` but the spanish law is so stupid and fascist . 
  spain is opressing the catalonia 's right to autodetermine '' . 
  - spain 's constitution says exactly the same as , for example , the norwegian constitution , or the french constitution , or any other constitution that in the world has ever been : the first right is the right to territorial integrity . 
  go check them , those are the first articles in any constitution . 
  [ spanish constitution , section 2 . 
  ] ( http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/congreso/congreso/hist_normas/norm/const_espa_texto_ingles_0.pdf ) [ french constitution , article 3 . 
  ] ( http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/english/constitution/constitution-of-4-october-1958.25742.html ) [ norwegian constitution , article 1 . 
  ] ( http://www.constitution.org/cons/norway/dok-bn.html ) pretty undemocratic , huh ? 
  there is no such thing as a `` right to autodetermine '' . 
  - the united nations recognize the right to nations to stablish their own political structure in three cases : colonies , militarily occupied territories , territories where the human rights are not being respected . 
  in all other cases , the right to the territorial integrity must be respected . 
  - `` but hey , it still says about the right to autodetermination '' . 
  - which law regulates it ? 
  as i said before , there is no constitution in the world which allows the right to secede unilaterality . 
  actually , there is one , the constitution of ethiopia , which allowed eritrea so secede . 
  i understand that , from the outside , this can be seen as a matter of `` freedom '' , etc. 
  this sounds romantic . 
  but it is not . 
  these politicans are beaking spain 's law . 
  and they would be breaking the norwegian law , the french law , or any other constitution in the world because of the points mentioned before . 
  we can also talk about the treaty of lisboa , which would leave an independent catalonia out of the eu . 
  also out of the imf and united nations , probably , as it would be hard for catalonia to get any international recognition . 
  stop seeing this as a matter of `` freedom '' , `` romanticism '' , or `` rights '' . 
  this is illegal . 
  plain and simple . 
  and i 'm not even against an independent catalonia , but at least they could respect the law . 
  i hope you like our country !, 
  but why is it surreal ? 
  we do more things apart from siestas and bullfighting yaknow ? 
  the only punishment i could only consider would be a punishment to all the stupid european institutions which have n't been able to cope with this problem in a reasonable way . 
  yeah but i do n't see how does it mean that :  `` the euro is divisible . 
  what we have is several different euros . 
  there 's a french euro and a german euro . 
  but the treaties stipulate that they should be exchanged 1 to 1 . '',
