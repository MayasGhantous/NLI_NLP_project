   however , there is a way to get out of the euro . 
  the euro is not really a single currency . 
  actually , the euro is divisible . 
  what we have is several different euros . 
  there 's a french euro and a german euro . 
  but the treaties stipulate that they should be exchanged 1 to 1 . 
  however , if a national bank so decided , it could decouple their euro from the other euros of the region by a simple signature . 
  one might wonder why there is such a possibility . 
  it is in fact the german bundesbank that allowed for it . 
  they were actually quite eurosceptic and they did n't feel safe having a real united currency . 
  therefore , they wanted a means to get out in a simple way . 
  that 's the backdoor that resides in the divisibility of the euro . 
  is there any official document i could read about this ? 
  seems interesting and i would like to know more . 
  the popular party is deeply corrupt . 
  there are many cases ; [ illegal financing ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2014/05/14/actualidad/1400099131_887893.html ) , [ parallel accounting ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2015/03/23/actualidad/1427123957_555826.html ) and [ payments under the table ] ( http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/1706931/0/cronologia-caso/luis-barcenas/gurtel-pp/ ) to party leaders in exchange for commissions and contracts ( [ the actual prime minister is one of those who received them ] ( http://www.publico.es/politica/barcenas-declara-pago-90-000.html ) ) . 
  also , [ tax evasion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c3%a1rcenas_affair ) or money laudering . 
  there are lots of leaders and members who are being prosecuted ( [ even a former minister of economy and chief director of the international monetary fund ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rodrigo_rato ) ) , judged or directly in jail . 
  there is a [ huge corruption scandal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g%c3%bcrtel_case ) in the province of madrid with more than 200 contracts with an illegal company . 
  i could go on for days . 
  any of these scandals would mean the party 's extinction in any other decent european country , but in top of that , you can add the recently passed [ gag law ] ( http://www.globalpost.com/article/6598692/2015/06/29/spanish-activists-protest-law-against-protests ) or their stance on [ homosexuality and social rights ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2012/11/06/actualidad/1352222651_734714.html ) ... the list does n't end . 
  the sad thing is , i lean towards the left , but i must reckon that the popular party does well in regards to economy . 
  however , the aforementioned corruption scandals are way too many . 
  spain really , really needs a clean and modern , european right , without ties with the extreme right and cristian fundamentalism that the popular party has . 
  you are not grasping the concept of `` right '' . 
  there is not a right if there is not a law to regulate it . 
  the un can say anything they want , but those are only good words . 
  the regulation of the right of self-determination relies on the laws of the sovereign countries . 
  if catalonia decides unilaterally to secede , that sedition would be illegal , because the spanish constitution ( as any other constitution in the world ) does not allow the unilateral right to self-determination . 
  the good news is the spanish economy is recovering , unemployment is quickly falling and there a more and more contributors and taxpayers . 
  as long as podemos does n't fuck up big time , things should be fine . 
  and the popular party needs to be outed as soon as possible . 
  the un , in regards to self-determination , says :  the purposes of the united nations are :  ( ... )  to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples , and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace ; and for this , the un transfers the right to self-determination to the sovereign countries , in this case , spain . 
  and the right to self-determination of catalonia was voted in the constitution of 1978 , accepted by referendum in the whole country and in the territory of catalonia . 
  and what does the spanish constitution say ? 
  this :  spanish constitution  preliminary part  section 1  1 . 
  spain is hereby established as a social and democratic state , subject to the rule of law , which advocates freedom , justice , equality and political pluralism as highest values of its legal system . 
  national sovereignty belongs to the spanish people , from whom all state powers emanate this , as i said in other comment , is common for every other constitution in the world . 
  therefore , catalonia exercised its right to self-determination . 
  in 1978 , and decided to abide to spanish 's law . 
  podemos taking a hit might be good for the european union or the euro , but surely , not to spain . 
   being this dense . 
   that is a human right recognised by the un and there 's legal precedent , so we 're pretty much fine with jurisdiction if we want . 
  please let me know where do the un allow the right to self-determination unilaterily . 
  i think you have n't understood anything . 
  i am not justifying anything , i 'm just telling you how do things work . 
  the right to self-determination in an unilateral way just does n't exist . 
  you may have been told a lot of things , but it just does n't exist . 
  i 've been looking through some constitutions , and you can take a look at what does the french constitution say : article 3  national sovereignty shall vest in the people , who shall exercise it through their representatives and by means of referendum . 
  no section of the people nor any individual may arrogate to itself , or to himself , the exercise thereof . 
  http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/english/constitution/constitution-of-4-october-1958.25742.html#titlei  this , beacause it is anti-democratic and fascist ( not letting people is antidemocratic , and it seems pretty crazy to me that you 're even able to type that ) is something that we will have to ignore . 
  i guess france is an anti-democratic and fascist country then . 
  this is another misconception , if not another complete lie . 
  there have only been 3 constitutions that have accepted the unilateral right to secede : the constitution of the soviet union , the constitution of yugoslavia , and the constitution of ethiopia . 
  the rest of the constitutions that have ever existed say the exact same thing : the right to self-determination belongs to the whole country . 
  this , although some people describe it as anti-democratic or fascist , it 's pretty damn reasonable , as it would n't make sense to write a constitution for a country where said constitution would allow a territory to secede unilaterally therefore jeopardizing the existence of said country . 
  this is a common misconception , if not a complete lie . 
  the right to self-determination , under un 's law , exists only under 3 conditions : colonies , territories where human rights are being violated , and militarily occupied territories . 
  as it 's obvious , neither of these 3 conditions apply to catalonia . 
  the imf is asking greece more pension and spending cuts , although it has already cut them the 40 % . 
  eli5 : is n't there any other thing the imf could ask greece to cut ? 
  i 'm seriously asking , because i do n't f * cking understand it . 
  at this point , when everybody knows greece is exhausted and there is no money to cut from , asking for pension cuts is just dumb . 
  dumb and humilliating . 
  i did n't see the thing , but i guess the guy is the russian representative ? 
  do you know where to see any picture of that greek 4 drachma 5th century bc coin ? 
  how expensive is living there ? 
  renting/food/restaurants , etc. 
  are these places expensive ? 
  how much do you think does a rent cost ? 
  and restaurants ? 
  damn ... 
  what is the name of this typical german style of architecture ? 
  gothic ? 
  it 's really really cool . 
  damn , greece is beautiful . 
   luton post pictures , you lazy fuck . 
  hard to say . 
  he 's being processed by money laudering , fraud and fraudulent conveyance . 
  besides , he 's also being investigated ( and possibly processed ) for the bankia scandal where he ( and others ) faked the accounting books before the bank went public . 
  it 's still very early to say what will happen to him since the trial has n't even started ( and it 'll take a lot to do so ) , but his next couple of years are going to be very complicated . 
  also , in spain a convict does not go to jail if the sentence is lower than 2 years of prison . 
  so even if he 's found guilty of some of the charges , he might still not go to jail . 
  but anyway the charges are serious and it 's not going to be easy for any judge to find him non-guilty due the social situation in spain now , so i expect some jail time for him in the mid-term future . 
  during the 1996-2004 center-right government in spain , rodrigo rato was a god-like figure . 
  let 's have in mind that during those years spain 's economy was strong and growing . 
  some years later he even got to direct the imf . 
  huge news , imo . 
  why so ? 
  did amsterdan and the hague just consider it a normal friendly agreement ? 
  was the hague already an administrative centre ? 
  i 'm kinda curious about it . 
  http://www.politico.eu/interactive/power-matrix-charting-the-eu-players-by-country-european-council-national-capitals-leaders-ambassadors/?cmpid=sf there 's a criteria at the bottom of the article . 
  basically , orban 's government is influential , has a consistent strategy and has a quite active voice during summits . 
  source : http://www.politico.eu/interactive/power-matrix-charting-the-eu-players-by-country-european-council-national-capitals-leaders-ambassadors/?cmpid=sf, 
   dissolve parliament what for ? 
  new elections ? 
  yeah , but bmw , wolkswagen , eon , siemens , etc. 
  germany produces tangible goods and exports them worldwide . 
  til .
