  the lowest shit of all this thing is the banknote burning . 
  because even if you throw coins at them while you laugh you 're at least give them something ( although probably those were low cent coins ) . 
  but burning a banknote rather than give it to them , or even keeping it ... you have to be a real son of a bitch to do something like that . 
  yes , you 're right . 
  i searched before posting it and found nothing , so i 'll delete this one . 
  thank you , 
  lol at reddit downvoting this thread . 
  the footage does n't show the psv fans burning the notes but it has been widely shown in the spanish media , i 'll try to find a link . 
  edit : [ found it .

   we are not backward morons from the middle ages , thanks . 
  speak for yourself !, 
  this is a good post . 
  [ then you go to leftists spanish media sites and you only read insults ] ( https://www.meneame.net/story/rajoy-cameron-mas-probable-haya-elecciones-26-junio ) . 
  it 's amazing how this people present themselves as the new democrats and ` the people ' , and are even worse that those who are criticizing in the first place ( who are quite awful too ) . 
  the guy just said what everybody is thinking , ffs . 
  awwwwww ... we love you too !, 
  and thank you for james joyce !, 
  i did n't say anywhere not waving or nodding is horrible . 
  however , if you want to know my opinion , not saying a simple ` hi ' to your classmates , is , at least , a bit rude . 
  she spoke native russian , native estonian , very good spanish , english and was studying french . 
  smart girl , yep . 
  in my class ( my flair already shows , but i 'm from spain ) : \u00b7 around 7-8 italian students . 
  almost all of them integrated very well , talked to natives and other erasmus students , and , in general , participated in class . 
  good level of spanish . 
  \u00b7 around 7-8 british students . 
  they only talked to me or the teachers when asked to , and were very shy and reserved in general . 
  i do n't know how much they integrated into spanish life , but they did n't participated much in class . 
  they did n't speak the language very well , which is weird , considering they attended to advanced spanish grammar classes . 
  \u00b7 around 7-8 french students . 
  some of them did n't even nod or wave when you met them in the corridors . 
  the others nodded or waved very politely , but were overall very shy and reserved . 
  they did n't speak much spanish . 
  \u00b7 one lithuanian girl . 
  i did n't meet her because she was in english classes , but my other mates said she was fun and integrated very well . 
  she even threw a party before leaving . 
  i do n't know how well she spoke spanish but , well enough i guess . 
  \u00b7 one half-estonian , half-russian student . 
  very polite and friendly . 
  integrated very well in spanish life ( has many spanish friends , actually ) and participated in class . 
  i asked her for help when we even did n't know each other and she was very glad to help . 
  very good level of spanish . 
  whenever i see the winter temperatures in places like russia , romania , bulgaria , etc. , i always think about the first nomad settlers who went there and thought `` mmmm i like it here '' . 
  being against austerity is not only an economic position , it is also a moral one . 
  the ones who never in the first place occasionated the crisis are the ones who are suffering the consequences ; pensioners , taxpayers , and normal citizens . 
  so , yes , fuck austerity .

  they 're right . 
  i went to vienna expecting a very boring and highbrow city and it turned out to be really cool , fun and beautiful . 
  so maybe the blame was on me . 
   spain gained global influence hehehehehehe what ? 
  yeah , you 're right , in spain meals are heavier most of the time . 
  damn , that looks tasty . 
  4 euros for that ??? 
  really ??? 
  brb , moving to france . 
  i meant about the sandwich . 
  i really want to see how a 4 $ sandwich of ` quality stuff ' in france looks like . 
  til meals are much cheaper in the rest of europe ( including sweden ) although we get paid much less . 
   4 for a sandwich in a boulangerie ( quality stuff ) . 
  got a pic of that ? 
  i 've always thought ` fine ' = ` good ' . 
  almost one million euros for a house in prague ? 
  what ? 
  damn ... how much is a monthly rent for a normal appartment in prague then ? 
  which are gon na be used to beat people up the same second maduro sees his presidency in danger . 
  check your irony detector . 
  this has been going on for a long time . 
  saudi arabia is one of our best clients and we also sell arms to peaceful and democratic contries like venezuela . 
  so the terms of uk 's parliament on the so called soft brexit are for now wet paper , can we agree on that at least ? 
  deciding it all ? 
  having much more leverage than uk 's parliament ? 
  of course . 
  it 's the uk who is leaving , and the terms agreeded by the british parliament must be accepted by brussels . 
  ` soft brexit ' means nothing and , as the article you linked very well puts it , it 's , for now , just a product of imagination :  supporters of a `` soft '' brexit ** imagine ** a future where the uk retains some form of membership of the european union single market in return for a degree of free movement . 
  yes , and it requires both parts to agree on it , so , if brussels does n't , london 's parliament can say nothing about it . 
  the leverage is in brussels , not london . 
  so it 's not going to be decided in london , it 's going to be decided in brussels . 
   supporters of a `` soft '' brexit imagine a future where the uk retains some form of membership of the european union single market in return for a degree of free movement . 
  again , if brussels agrees to . 
  what is a softer brexit ? 
  because as far as i know , the terms of the brexit are going to be decided in brussels , not london . 
  we eat a lot of salad , fish , legumes and vegetables , only a tiny fraction of spanish food is greasy . 
  yeah , ciu is such a progressive party . 
  i bet with all the money they 've stolen from you ( from us ) they 've progressed a lot . 
  and what did they have in mind ? 
  what did they think it was going to happen if instead of 2 major parties there were 4 ? 
  this is exactly what people wanted since the beginning : pacts and coalitions and negotiated laws . 
  now they have it , yet they do n't want it . 
  some people are really fucking delusional or directly moronic . 
  big parties ( left or right ) are not openly against refugees . 
  they may be more or less welcoming , but all of them accept that spain has to take them . 
  the only openly against refugees parties are extreme right parties and they mean nothing in spain , they do n't have any seat in the parliament and either the situation gets really fucked up in spain or they never will . 
  russia is not an important topic in spanish politics either . 
  mirror ? 
  the uploader has taken the video down it seems . 
   i hope it stays doing well . 
  thanks for the nice words ,
