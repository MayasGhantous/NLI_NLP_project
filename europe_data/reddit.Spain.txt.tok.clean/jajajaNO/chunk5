  would grece be better off leaving the euro and going back to the dracma ? 
  funny , but when he was impersonating germany as a dj he should have used his right arm instead :d, 
  lol , bastard :d, 
  there are two kinds of bars to go out and party in spain ( actually like in any other country i guess . ), 
  pubs/bars open at around 3-4pm and close at 4:30 am ( some close a bit earlier some close a bit later , but all of them around that time . ), 
  they 're pretty much packed all night . 
  clubs open at 0-1am and close at 6:30 am and they 're basically dead until around 3am . 
  when bars/pubs close at 4:30 people move to clubs and then they get fucking packed like crazy . 
  so having dinner at home , drinking from 9-10pm onwards , and going to a bar or club at 1-2 am is perfectly reasonable , you 've been drinking at home and you still have 5 or 6 hours to party . 
  you can even go to an ` after ' if you want and that 's like 5 or 6 more hours . 
  i understand it may be weird to other people , but i 'm so used to it that when i go to any other european country and have to get out of a pub at 2am because it 's closing i get a little angry to be honest . 
  most of all the judges of all the courts in the world are appointed by governments . 
  if a judge in alabama were to say that creationism should be taught in school , does that mean that the american government says creationism should be taught in school ? 
  one thing is russia as a nation-state which has said nothing about this ( that i know of ) and another very different thing is a local court . 
  the article goes , `` russia says it never invaded poland in 1939 . '', 
  russia , the country , its officials , have n't said anything like that . 
  a real pity . 
  `` accidental death of an anarchist '' , which is the only play by him i 've read , is extremely funny and well written . 
  he was in my town some years ago for a conference and although i really wanted to attend , in the end i could n't . 
  ` russia ' and ' a russian court ' are not the same thing . 
  actually the renassiance was basically funded with the money from the new world .

  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laws_of_burgos ) i can be all day like this if you want . 
  yeah , i can totally see them going full bdsm and farage being the slave and lepen being the master . 
  when the spaniards arrived to america , the mexicans were still sacrificing babies . 
  not a single damn word from some political parties about that . 
  that 's absurd . 
  there was also stability , wealth , education and prosperity in rome , for example , or in many other periods of history , you 're just being an ethnocentrist . 
  also , there is not a real way to measure all those abstract concepts . 
  how are you going to measure `` stability '' ? 
  ( i really hope you do n't come up with an un indicator or some other dumb thing . ), 
  and if we were to accept that argument ( which is a big ` if ' ) , the relative calm in the western world has more to do with decolonization , europe stoping warring each other , and the european union . 
  actually , the us is the most warmonger country in the west in the last 100 years : korea , vietnam , iraq i , iraq ii , syria , afganisthan only in direct interventions . 
  and you can add the dozens of times the us as armed rebels or directly overthrown local governments : chile or iran , for example , without thinking too much about it . 
  in fact , all this daesh/isis shit is directly related to the 2003 invasion of irak ( which by the way had only economic interests , * cough * cheney/rumsfeld * cough * , al quaeda armed by the us to fight the soviets in afganisthan , etc. ), 
  i love the us and i 'm not anti-american at all , but do n't try to sell me the idea of a better world because the american foreign policy because that 's laughable and a total lie . 
  it really does n't seem like the american intervention in afganistan , iraq , libia , syria or even vietnam back in the day has brought any stability to the world . 
  yeah , we want more fights !, 
  why would any person in those countries want to join the huge fuck up the euro has been ? 
  that 's sad lol . 
  university of leeds . 
  university of leeds according to the guy who posted it in the original forum . 
  and ? 
  jesuschrist you said it did n't happen a lot in spain , but almost half the country does it . 
  america does it too ? 
  cool , go talk to them , what do you want me to say ? 
  half spain naps , dude , even your uncles do it , wtf are you talking about ? 
  also , sevilla does not go over 40\u00ba c in july ? 
  dude , seriously ? 
  do you know what is like 29\u00ba c and 80 % humidity like barcelona in summer ? 
  i was in september two days ago in valencia and i wanted to die . 
  and what do you consider ` northern spain ' ? 
  i live in northern spain and july goes over 40 \u00bac every day . 
  you 're probably referring to the cantabric coast and some parts of castille , but that 's like 20 % of the territory . 
  even madrid is fucking hell in summer and it 's right in the middle . 
  now tell your scandinavian friends if they could work under the spanish sun from may until september with our temperatures and let me know if they do it without getting sleepy or having to stop . 
  edit : http://verne.elpais.com/verne/2016/04/05/articulo/1459866604_782462.html 16 % spaniards nap everyday . 
  22 % nap sometimes . 
  3 % on weekends . 
  58 % never nap . 
  so almost half the country does siesta occasionally but you say people do n't do it a lot . 
  we consider brits as drunk funks who love to get into brawls and frenchs as surreders . 
  they 're just stereotypes . 
  spaniards are well liked from what i know . 
  i 've never ever had any problem when i 've traveled across europe and actually everyone smiles when you tell them you 're from spain . 
  i did n't like the picture very much either but getting mad for something like this is stupid . 
  also , it 's a book for students and they 're probably promoting exchange programs . 
  if they want to depict the country like this it 's their problem , not mine . 
  also , we 've also been [ stupidly racist ] ( https://franciscosiglo21.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/espanabaloncestos.jpg ) too , it 's not like we are n't extremely racist with other countries * cough * panchitos * cough * . 
  it depends on what you consider `` a lot . '', 
  it happens , yes . 
  i have a friend who does it every single day and i ocasionally do it too . 
  but it 's normal . 
  in spain the sun rises at 7 am and sets at 10 pm in summer . 
  and you have like 35\u00ba c or even 40\u00ba c from noon to 5 pm . 
  so people , especially in the country , gets up early , works while the temperature is not too high , takes a 1 - 2 hour nap , keeps working , and then goes to sleep at around midnight . 
  so you end up sleeping the same time , but spread all over the day . 
  my friend for example gets up at 4 am to work in a factory . 
  so he wakes up , works , gets home at 5 pm , takes a 1 hour nap , and then goes to sleep again at 10 pm . 
  napping is a way for him to not go to sleep at 7 - 8 pm . 
  spain has really long days and hot temperatures , you ca n't compare it to northern countries , it 's just too different . 
  there are many realities within reality which many times contradict each other , but this picture is a reality . 
  first off because it 's a real picture , and second off because , let 's be honest , it happens a lot in spain . 
  whether it 's reasonable to mock this lady and spain in general in a book that should be aimed to show a positive image of the country i wo n't get into , but this picture is a real depiction of a little piece of the spanish reality . 
  stop assuming my assumptions because you 're assuming wrongly , i just thought the ` j' sound was the same , no need to get mad . 
  i have nothing agains portugal and i actually like the country , it was just a tiny mistake because , that 's true , i do n't know much about the language . 
  if you asked spaniards probably less than 1 in 9 would know about it , so either your office is not that bad after all or us spaniards do n't know shit about other languages . 
  nope , maybe other people know but i had no idea ( and i study linguistics , go figure . ), 
  i knew the spanish ` j' is kinda special and not many european languages have the sound , but i just asumed for some reason portuguese had it too . 
  that makes sense now . 
  lol , what ? 
  tajo and tejo are just one vowel away but the ` something stuck in our throats ' sound does not change , hence my message . 
  i really ca n't see what your message has to do with anything . 
  but that 's because the ` j' , what difference does changing the vowel make ?
