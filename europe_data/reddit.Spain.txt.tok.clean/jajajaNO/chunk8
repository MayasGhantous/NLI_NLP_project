  fair enough : * french constitution : `` national sovereignty shall vest in the people , who shall exercise it through their representatives and by means of referendum .

  if you really think the `` right to self determination '' means that any entity can use it any time they want under any circunstance , you do n't know what the `` right to self determination '' is and , worse , you do n't know how rights and law work in general .

  i thought the same . 
  maybe molina de segura is a trafficking hotspot . 
  nah , i do n't think so . 
  in spain arab population consumes more cannabis than cocaine . 
  and even before the mass inmigration of these 10-15 years , spain was a country where cocaine was very popular .

  that monk was spanish ? 
  your explanation is good . 
  however , there 's a point where i do n't agree with you . 
   you need to understand that spain is n't yet fully adapted to the idea of a multi-party democracy - we 're used to two main parties and one of them getting full power , american style . 
  this is a false myth by some interested parties . 
  spain is a full democracy with a full multi-party system . 
  the psoe has pacted with iu several times and also has the pp pacted with ciu ( catalan nationalists and spanish nationalists , go figure . ), 
  there have also been lots of minor parties in the parliament , from the cha to hb to coalici\u00f3n canaria , etc. 
  maybe there are more options now , but comparing spain to the two parties system of the usa is completely false and misleading just because there have been some absolute majorities in the past . 
  also note that the uk is as much of a two party system as spain was some years ago and nobody doubts the uk is a full democracy . 
  to be honest , we 're good at raising taxes . 
  very bad news that are going to make everything worse from now on if true , but it 's kinda curious to see how after decades of meddling in foreign countries and elections , the us got a little of their own medicine . 
  and if putin really interfered in the elections and made trump win the white house somehow , he 's even sharper and more dangerous than we thought . 
   says catalonia is oppressed . 
   links prove how catalonia is not oppressed . 
  they also show how it continuously defies the spanish government .

  you , sir , are a fucking idiot . 
  right now that 's the only sensible option , but good luck trying to explain it to liberals .

  '' ] ( https://www.amazon.es/petita-hist%c3%b2ria-catalunya-petites-hist%c3%b2ries/dp/8499792049 ) this is how oppressed you are . 
  what a fucking joke of people . 
  and bonus track : * [ `` catalonia is not included among the governmentless territories with right to self determination '' , ban ki-moon , secretary-general of the united nations . 
  lol . 
  first of all , to believe in the self determination right you must believe in natural law . 
  and for that , you have to be either an ignorant or a moron . 
  second . 
  the right to self determination does not exist in the terms catalonia lays out . 
  self determination rights were designed to nations under colonial rule and for territories which do not respect the human rights of their citizens . 
  so take a look at the united nations charter before speaking nonsense about ` self determination ' , which , by the way , the united nations have continuosly denied for catalonia . 
  it was not banned , it 's just illegal , plain and simple . 
  just like it 's illegal in norway , italy , france or any other country whose constitution states that the sovereignty of the state resides in the whole territory of the state ( all of them , either by explicitly stating it or by omission . ), 
  there 's a legal way to do it : let the whole country vote . 
  but that is n't as appealing , right ? 
  damn , you 're gooooooood . 
  not only you ca n't into slang or reading , you ca n't into anatomy either . 
  have a nice evening , 
  calm your tits and learn to read . 
  i said `` somewhat '' , which already tones down the following adjective . 
  i did n't say arag\u00f3n is unimportant , i said it is `` somewhat '' unimportant , which is a big difference . 
  now , arag\u00f3n , right now , in the structure of the country is not especially important politicalwise .
