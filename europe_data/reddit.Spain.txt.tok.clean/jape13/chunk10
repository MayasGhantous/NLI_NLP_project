  that i would n't like to just grab an ak and gun down everyone that i _ feel _ responsible ? 
  it needs a very strong will to not fall into animalistic , `` eye for an eye '' temptation . 
  even 2000 year old jesus knew that . 
  i 'm definitely sick of this subreddit . 
  one would have expected humanity to learn a fucking thing or two in 2000 years . 
  but no , it 's not possible . 
  all the same tropes one after the other . 
  this just looks like the early 20th century all over again . 
  history is really doomed to repeat itself once again . 
  i 'm a ` practicing ' , anti-religion atheist and despite that i 'm a better christian than most of this subreddit . 
  no further questions , your honor . 
  this just confirms my intuition that morals develop _ despite _ of religion , no thanks to it . 
  i refer you to _ any _ of the snowden interviews for an answer to that . 
  and how would have gandhi or jesus confronted that ? 
  tell me you would consider their approach wrong . 
   people who are not citizens of the eu and have held a job for less than 9 months the past year ( the exact numbers there would be better determined by people smarter than me ) go home . 
  it 's not like these guys were random beggars on the street turned terrorists . 
  but yeah , let 's continue assuming there 's a magical racial/economical/nationality profile you can apply . 
  for someone who thinks that a dead person is a dead person , no matter if it 's my neighbor or someone 4000km away , how is that `` punching up '' ? 
  it looks like most of the people forget that the `` surveillance state '' of america is targeted towards _ foreigners _ . 
  they are _ officially _ spying on foreigners , not americans . 
  obviously , the reason there have been these recent backlashes on the three letter agencies in the us is because `` oh they may have had accidentally half-looked at half-a-sentence of a us citizen ! '' . 
  but please remember that the _ official _ target of the nsa , etc. 
  is _ foreign countries _ , and _ no american will bat an eye on that _ . 
  despite this , europeans _ still continue to use american online services _ like this one ... 
   people have since generalized that situation and believe some bizarre mix of ghandi , jesus and star wars ideology when it comes to fighting . 
  and is that a bad thing ? 
  today the `` press '' says belgium is the hub of terror in europe . 
  tomorrow something 'll happen in the uk and `` london will be the hub of terror in europe '' . 
  rinse and repeat . 
   belgium did n't have the same problems 30 years ago that they do today with islamic terrorism . 
  they did n't have the same problems 1 month ago either . 
  what does this mean ? 
  if you 're insinuating they did n't have problems with terrorism and now they have , i suggest you go and read around . 
   and that 's ultimately one of the major points of the article , that belgian intelligence has been almost negligent in adapting to current realities because of this same attitude why it 's been negligent ? 
  according to this subreddit , the country is a `` war zone '' , and this has been the first semi-succesfull terrorist plot in decades . 
  which is , to be honest , a miracle , since terrorism is so easy . 
  heck , these suicide bombings have happened literally on the day of the 1 year ` anniversary ' of the germanwings suicide crash . 
   those `` successful '' 30 years of relative peace using an apparently flawed system are more indicative of the scale of current challenges facing belgian intelligence today than they are of some perceived effectiveness of the agencies ' past performance . 
  sorry , but that 's _ exactly _ the type of short-sightnedness typical of post-tragedy drama that i want to avoid . 
  you have a provable track record that becomes a `` provable track record '' in quotes just because of something someone feels . 
   nobody ever talks about the iraqis saddam killed in 1991 nor all the people he _ genocided _ way before that . 
  in the meanwhile , the west ( including _ my country _ ) was giving he medals ( literally ) because of his action during the `` early 70s oil crisis '' . 
  yes , he was being awarded medals while massacring kurds . 
  so pardon me while i say that the west ( including my country ) has a lot to be blamed of here . 
  not going to enter into how he got into power since i was n't even born back then . 
   if there 's a time to make changes , it 's now . 
  why ? 
  are you one of those than promote reviewing gun ownership polices right after mass shootouts ? 
  actually i think that _ now _ is the _ worst time _ to make changes . 
  you need a unbiased view to make reasonable changes ( rather than patriot acts ) . 
  and experience says we wo n't have unbiased views for weeks . 
  people are ignoring the 30 + man-years of successes for a failure one day . 
  and they 're very good at ignoring it . 
   but reddit is n't real life , nor is it reflective of the mainstream opinions in our societies . 
  thank god , someone admits it . 
  if it was , i 'd be having suicide thoughts , to be honest . 
  too many people here who i would refuse to call `` human '' . 
   stop telling me or any other person that this whole mess is the wests fault . 
  certainly not the west fault , since russia has no small part in this play . 
  but is n't there a lot of stuff that the west could have done differently ? 
  and most importantly , could _ do _ differently right now ? 
  it 's not like they 're in this war with sticks and rocks . 
  part of the reason many refugees `` from syria '' are iraq people is because they were displaced back during the iraq war already ( and in numbers that make the `` european refugees problem '' make ridiculous in comparison ) . 
  the safest country in europe by any objective data set is actually switzerland . 
  good luck trying to convince anyone otherwise . 
  poland 's crime rate is actually more similar to my country 's ... 
  * checks crime statistics * then you 're deluding yourself . 
   it 's a terrorist haven hyperbole much ? 
  oh god , not even in my worst nightmares i could predict that political parties would start using currency symbols as logos . 
  imagine the same thing but with the dollar sign . 
  would look like something straight out of a comic book . 
  not specifically , but more or less . 
  this is europe , we 've been on the `` slippery slope '' for decades . 
  and , to be honest , i do n't think the slope is that slippery . 
  for example , the `` right to be forgotten '' trumps free speech . 
  and i am personally ok with that . 
  the alternative , as amplified several times by streissand effect , is allowing a man 's full life can be ruined because of a single mistake made during childhood . 
   crises of confidence are such a stupid idea to me , because the very concept can create a self fulfilling prophecy . 
  and that 's how the world economy basically works . 
  which always makes me jiggle when people still propose unregulated , laissez-faire economics as a solution . 
   the green candidate in that state is essentially a conservative with a little green touch . 
  so a green party member is either a `` cristal meth child porn watcher '' or a `` conservative with a little green touch '' . 
  it 's like the no true scottsman argument . 
  sounds biased , imho . 
  portugal had their own dictatorship and stuff , though . 
  actually it is 50/50 % split , if statistics from last years are to be believed . 
   sweden now has the second highest number of rapes in the world _ as i said _ , this is not new . 
  sweden has had the _ highest reported number of reported rapes in a year _ of _ any country in the world _ for _ several years _ . 
  for example 2008 , way before the refugee crisis . 
  it was _ number # 1 _ back then . 
  ( and obviously , that is explained by the strict definition of rape and underreporting of most other countries -- certainly not because of sweden 's `` muslim ratio '' , which is hardly the highest even in europe ) . 
   you ca n't deny facts . 
  certainly , you ca n't . 
  please stop associating the name of atheism with absurd propaganda . 
   do you realise the rape epidemic we are in right now ? 
  no , not really , as the numbers show . 
  either europe 's always been with a rape epidemic , or it 's never had one , but it 's not something new . 
   what else can we do to defend our western values than becoming racist ? 
  _ anything _ other than becoming racist .
