  in the hypothetical situation where just 0.01 % of europeans become racist because 100 % of refugees become rapists , then my daughters have more chances of being in the receiving end of racist induced violence than being raped . 
  this scares me to death , because it would be europeans doing it . 
  the fact that it scares me is the reason i believe europe is already destroyed -- the refugees helped , but it was europeans who had the murder weapon . 
  run the numbers . 
   we brough civilazation to the world and now we are becoming the uncivilized ones . 
  white people built europe , it 's our home so stay the fuck out . 
  so you 'd be like the racist asshole in the video , instead of the actual human people that calm him down ? 
  then you 'd be part of the problem . 
  because if the extreme far left/right is on the rise , racism is on the rise , police abuses are on the rise , anti-migration becomes the norm , distrust between eu members , other eu members , and the eu itself is increasing , that is because of europeans . 
  the true europe is showing its colors , they were hidden all along . 
  refugees are n't voting -- they 're just showing up . 
  if stuff like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-9zg9rmpwy becomes more common , well , that ai n't refugees either . 
  more like : the reaction of europe to the refugees _ has _ already destroyed the ` idyllic ' image of europe . 
  or to put in another way : refugees are encouraging europeans to destroy europa . 
   we expend most of the winter in the dark after 7pm it is supposed to be like that , actually . 
  if you were on the proper time zone the sun would set some 2h earlier . 
  what political instability ? 
  because they _ literally _ use less resources per capita ? 
  what other definition of `` capacity '' do you have in mind ? 
  do you realize that the fact that you 're saying this actually only proves the parent 's post point ? 
  it was widely considered to be a hell hole for most of western europe just a few decades ago , and now it is `` an amazing country to live in '' . 
  spain , who lives mostly disconnected from the rest of europe and `` news come slowly '' and thanks to that public opinion seems to have a 10yr delay versus that of the rest of europe , still believes romania to be a `` hell-hole '' `` source of low-skilled migrants '' . 
  have you considered it 's most probably the opposite ? 
   there is a jewish ethnicity , though i choosed that example just to drive a point ( that was not understood , apparently ) , but on the same uno list you have islamophobia . 
   anyone with passing acquaintance with the qur ` an , hadiths or the islamic world knows that misogyny , homophobia and retaliatory violence are embedded . 
  all cultures are not necessarily compatible . 
  we should not tolerate intolerance . 
  we should not tolerate misogyny , homophobia and violence , and we should also not tolerate racism , like thinking that _ all _ members of a certain race/culture/mindset are mindfucked just because some are . 
  otherwise you 've got to accept the feminist argument that `` all of the people who rape are men , therefore all men are rapists '' . 
  here 's your will , since you seem unable to understand it : https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/01/12/germans-attitudes-immigration-harden-following-col/ and that 's from a unofficial poll . 
  shameful , as i said . 
   disconnected from reality . 
  what is the trajectory of the left today ? 
  what has the left achieved in the last 40 years ? 
  what role do the left play today other than useful idiots for neoliberals ? 
  you 're a century late , mate . 
  the left is dead . 
  discredited . 
  learn from syriza and give it up already . 
  ...  that 's rich . 
  you 're speaking from a position of such privilege . 
  what does it mean for a citizen of a stable first-world country under a nato umbrella to talk about pacifism ? 
  precisely nothing . 
  ah , this type of argument ...  a large cause of change in this subreddit was it becoming a european geodefault , if anything , that would mean a eternal-september-like bunch of 13 year olds have joined , and not necessarily a `` more general representation of the european population '' , which it is n't . 
  specially considering that according to this subreddit almost half of europe has an `` opinion '' that is so wrong they be would in favor to remove the right to vote from those with that opinion . 
  not really . 
  [ antisemitism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antisemitism ) , for example , is considered a contemporary form of racism by the [ united nations ] ( http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=a/res/53/133 ) itself . 
  extrapolating that because the nye incidents were primarily caused by members of a specific race/culture/mindset then that race/culture/mindset is to blame _ is _ xenophobia/racism . 
  the only exception would be if these acts were be actively encouraged by such race/culture/mindset . 
  literally the same thing feminists do when they reach the `` all men are evil '' conclusion . 
  `` all of the evils in the world are perpetrated by men , after all . '', 
  he 's _ still _ asking to take on more refugees :  but said he was confident the continent could successfully integrate the newcomers . 
   despite the `` inevitable difficulties '' in trying to absorb the migrants , who brought with them different cultures and traditions , the pope said he hoped european nations would prove capable of integrating and accepting the refugees . 
   `` europe , aided by its great cultural and religious heritage , has the means to defend the centrality of the human person and to find the right balance between its two-fold moral responsibility to protect the rights of its citizens and to ensure assistance and acceptance to migrants but obviously , no one has the time to actually read the article , they 're too busy chasing imaginary dangers ... 
   first of all , spain is not a destination country . 
  even better for my argument !, 
  so a country that according to you `` is not a destination country '' ( that 's outright false , but let me entertain the idea that it is true for the sake of this argument ) has the `` will '' to kick migrants , imagine how large the `` will '' of the `` destination countries '' is . 
  the `` will '' to kick migrants back _ is _ the sickness . 
  it 's everywhere . 
  it seems , for some reason , to be deeply ingrained in most humans . 
  it 's a wrong idea . 
  it 's not supported by logic . 
  it 's not supported by fraternity . 
  it 's not civilized . 
   what happened in the past is irrelevant feel free to reinvent it . 
   they 're all human , they all deserve cornucopia . 
  yes . 
  period . 
  that 's the definition of left-wing , in case you wonder . 
   it 's almost like it 's not necessary for one 's homeland to be post-apocalyptic to motivate one to migrate somewhere else . 
  did i argue otherwise ? 
   your neighbour died of cancer , so you should commit suicide . 
  it 's only fair . 
  it 's not surprising that you laugh about this . 
  what happened to `` there 's a bunch of causes that i 'm ready to die for , but no cause that i 'm ready to kill for '' ? . 
  fortunately i know that most people outside this subreddit still have a soul . 
  ah yes , the expected answer in this subreddit . 
   they do n't need to qualify . 
  they just need to show up , because there is no will to deport them . 
  there 's no will to deport what ? 
  we 've here in spain been kicking `` migrants '' back for decades . 
  even when it was widely know that their home countries would basically kill them on sight . 
  in fact not long ago our _ current _ government literally opened fire on them ( using supposedly `` non-fatal '' bullets , though ) . 
  but i guess that ` the public ' now realizes that you can hardly call yourself `` civilized '' if you send refugees back to an active warzone . 
  i 've never been exactly proud of my country for their treatment of african migrants . 
  back in the old / r/europe , gunning them down , even if only `` to scare them away '' , would have been met with the appropriate universal d\u00e9rision . 
  in the `` new '' / r/europe i 'm sure these types of acts would be received with applause . 
  whatever the causes are , this is very unfortunate turn of events . 
  but there 's certainly no shortage of will , no ...  define ` massive ' . 
  climate change does not need to render the developing world completely uninhabitable . 
  when there are 4 billion africans , even 1 % is enough to overrun europe . 
  if climate change forces 1 % of africa to move , that is certainly massive , by your own admission . 
  when that happens , my hometown will most probably lay in ruins at the bottom of an enlarged mediterranean sea . 
  if someone really feels welcome in what will undoubtedly be a hell-hole of european warring states * , good for him ... 
  i 'll ask which way he came while exiting my own country . 
  \\* heck , if the eu is almost going to fall apart because of economic issues that have _ minimal _ impact on everyone , imagine what 'll happen on the first drinking water shortage . 
   yeah , because when human civilisation is falling , safeguarding stability in the centres of scientific and technological development should not be a concern at all . 
  . . and this is what worries me about this subreddit the most, 
   this is what europe / the world has to understand . 
  we are at the beginning of the biggest refuge crises ever .
