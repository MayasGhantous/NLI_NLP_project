  taking africa and the coming climate change into account we will see millions to come . 
  if the world ends up with : a ) enough wars in order for a significant population of africa to qualify as `` refugees '' b ) climate change triggering massive migration patterns the refugee crisis will be _ the least _ of your problems during the fall of human civilization . 
   there was n't hidden money here and there this would n't _ exactly _ help his case ... 
  unsurprisingly , it comes from a portuguese guy . 
  as someone who works in education i sadly know that portuguese actually learn more of spanish history than most spaniards do . 
  something that spain does not reciprocate ( portugal gets barely any mention in the official curricula ) . 
   the trend is going in one direction . 
  downwards ? 
   huge social shock plan that would n't have happened if there was no pact . 
  why not ? 
  there would have been new elections , and so on until jxsi was ready to tradeoff . 
  the text of the supposed agreement : http://www.mon.cat/cat/downloads2/acord.pdf it basically says cup will embrace _ any _ president proposed by mas ( not jxsi , but _ mas _ ) . 
  it also says that two seats from the cups will literally join jxsi and thus `` align '' their position with jxsi 's . 
  the rest will also align with jxsi but only in `` all matters where the secessionist process might be at stake '' , whatever that is . 
  the agreement also explicitly mentions that cup is _ entirely _ to blame for having slowed down and weared out the `` process '' . 
  not mas . 
  only the cup . 
  scary stuff . 
  this really looks like a small-scale stalinist purge . 
  a pity in my opinion . 
  having ousted mas is a nice symbolic gesture and actually the only way for the cups to fulfill the majority of their campaign promises . 
  so this was to be expected , the only question was when mas was going to decide which minion to use . 
  however , i ponder how much difference will this symbolical move make regarding secession . 
  anti-secessionists ` hate ' mas , when in truth he and his minions are about the least pro-secessionist of all the secessionist parties . 
  the moment anything related to money or power comes up to the table , he 'll forget about secession and go back to his old self . 
  these recent days have already been an example . 
  i still do n't believe corruptconvergencia will take us anywhere closer to secession . 
  no , not yet . 
  but once we have elections every two months ... it will be easier to actually propose having those every week . 
   there are regular elections so i have to repeat myself : when democracy actually works . 
  i will never understand why people are so afraid of getting closer to a [ direct democracy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/direct_democracy ) . 
  the _ refucheese _ . 
  that map is extremely useless , since a difference between a 1.4 and a 1.5 fertility rate may already cause a ginormous difference in population metrics . 
  no surprise it turns out all the countries are the same color ... 
   it is estimated that in some sectors up to 50 % of current jobs will simply no longer exist in 50 years . 
  and a lot of even more menial and artificial jobs will have been `` invented '' to cover for these . 
  like in the previous century . 
  today , it can already be said that more than 50 % of population works , directly or indirectly , for the entertainment sector ... 
   modern science , as in the scientific method , is the product of european enlightment age . 
  contradicts wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_scientific_method#emergence_of_inductive_experimental_method  the `` islamic golden age '' is the period after they conquer the most developped regions on earth - those of the eastern roman empire , and utilize what they find there that 's funny , since the same thing can be argued about most religions . 
  an example is christianity `` calming down '' after spreading through europe ( and next thing please say it was done `` peacefully '' ) . 
   mathematics and physics were well present in ancient egypt , rome and greece , but proper systematised once more in europe 's enlightment age thorugh the scientific method . 
  which is why we use the european numerals . 
  oh , wait ... now more seriously , you _ can not _ ignore the importance of the golden age on most of the basic sciences , most specially if you include ancient egypt and rome . 
   http://www.newenglishreview.org/norman_berdichevsky/the_myth_of_the_golden_age_of_tolerance_in_medieval_muslim_spain/ completely unrelated ... it 's not spain we 're talking about ( and i have already discussed about this extensively in the past ) . 
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxttwnvwxc clearly a completely objective source whose `` motto '' is `` political islam has subjugated civilizations for 1,400 years '' . 
  in the meanwhile , an actual scientists talking about the visible contributions of the golden age to his area : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdat98een5q please note that i hate all religions equally . 
  and islam is basically behind science , mathematics , physics , etc. 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_golden_age this proves nothing , and thus changes nothing . 
  and the worst part of this all is that `` foreigners '' wo n't have to do _ anything _ before we europeans undo decades of work and go back to fucking each other . 
  it 's funny that people call `` secular '' when , even without knowing the actual specifics of these exams , i 'm quite sure they are also scheduled to avoid dec 25 and the like . 
  you might argue that yours is a `` christian '' country and that by law it observes christian holidays , and that 's a fine argument , but the word `` secular '' is not exactly appropriate here . 
  this reminds of the spanish constitution 's `` no religion will be a state religion , except for catholicism '' clause . 
  that would be like saying that a vote for cup was not a vote for independence , but a vote not to give another term to mas . 
  most truthful answer would be `` it was a vote for both '' ( even if i have always argued corruptconvergencia would _ never _ be on a path to secession ), 
  i love this country . 
  5 downvotes and no counterarguments after pointing out how in this country 's `` democracy '' the parties resort to anything they can in order to avoid having to make referendums . 
  _ even for stuff as important as changing the constitution _ . 
   republican parties what is a republican party for you ? 
  psoe used to be one literally less than two years ago , and podemos still is . 
  do you want to discuss this ? 
  oh , turns out it is n't so easy to say which party is republican and which one is n't ? 
  ( reminds of certain other plebiscite ... ) . 
  well , it 's not really hard to understand , and there 's even a wikipedia article for it : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/left-wing_nationalism a probably well-known example is gandhi . 
  in spain , nationalism was actually invented by the left wing ( google for `` muera la naci\u00f3n '' ) . 
  are you going to call the major two parties getting into an `` emergency '' coalition that lasted a few days only so that they could get to change the constitution without having to call a referendum * that would absolutely never pass since since [ polls showed that a landslide majority of citizens ] ( http://publicaciones.adicae.net/publicaciones/fototeca/encuesta2.jpg ) were completely against the change a ... `` good example of democracy '' ? 
  \\* yes , spanish law allows that , but _ only _ if 90 % of congress agrees to it . 
  a sad fact that happened to happen when the two major parties in congress entered a coalition . 
  < s  such a miracle . < / s , 
   you should learn \\* rolls eyes \\*  there is no government nor estability with 4 elections in 5 years . 
  and that is a fact because it is written in plato 's de republica or . . ? 
  reducing a term to 2 years would make the country `` ungovernable and unstable '' because ... ? 
  having elections more frequently would make the country `` ungovernable and unstable '' because ... ? 
  there 's a lot of people out here that actually would prefer a more frequent and direct democracy , and are not scared of actually allowing the people to vote . 
  a good example of that is what the cup just did . 
  which link ? 
   they left a motion against francoism no , not one . 
  many of them . 
  that is just the most popular one because of the catfight . 
  but , for example , on the same day as the one you quote they also for example abstained on another vote for the ilegalization of a well-known fascist group . 
  only pp voted against , cs abstained , and this time there was no catfight to excuse their action . 
  this is just one of many . 
  as you can see by my flair , i tend to pay attention to these things . 
  they , on the other hand , have only started paying attention to this ... issue ... very recently , as [ i 've admited ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3uqvdy/in_spain_new_political_party_makes_gains_from/cxintez ) many times . 
  but erasing almost 10 years of being basically an even more obtuse clone of pp in the catalan parliament will not be easy for them . 
  ( and most definitely , should not be easy ) . 
   as it happens sometimes , some radical groups infiltrate in rallies ah yeah , specially they seem to be quite welcoming to previous members of pp ( like rivera himself ) ... but ok , i 'll give you that . 
   and hardly a reason for calling anyone , `` a fascist '' . 
  no , not that specific example . 
  but when your own party ~ ~ chairman ~ ~ secretary from 2006 to 2007 _ leaves the party in protest _ because the new alliances ( e.g. 
  libertas ) and leadership ( e.g. 
  duran ) is `` too fascist '' for him , then that _ may _ be a reason for saying that the party has fascist connections . 
   regarding abortion , why do you bring that to the table ? 
  these days , even pp `` embraces '' abortion . 
  the overton window has moved on . 
  that no longer makes them progressive any more than abolition of slavery does . 
  a true plebiscite ? 
  and that would be exactly ... what ? 
  what i often call this is the `` fake referendum '' . 
  and it does n't really change the ( fake ) outcome because no party has changed their stance on the issue of secession .
