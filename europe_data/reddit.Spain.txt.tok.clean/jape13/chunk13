  there is still a parliamentary majority that wants independence , and that has n't changed either . 
   you should recognize now that adding jxsi to the cup ones was n't exactly fair game too . 
  why ? 
  yes , terrible . 
  these poor people !, 
  we have to protect them from the dangers of democracy !, 
  / s wake me up when we get to [ 12 in a single year ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_referendums,_2014 ) . 
   did n't democracy work before ? 
  [ nope ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/reforma_constitucional_espa%c3%b1ola_de_2011 ) . 
  ( a translation of this is in my message below ), 
  _ actually _ they have quite some people in common with fascists , at least as much as pp . 
  ( being catalan does not make you any less `` fascist '' , you known . 
  many well-known fascists were actually catalan . 
   ungovernable mess results . 
  so when democracy actually works , we call the result `` ungovernable '' ? 
  in which way does this change the result of the plebiscite ? 
  this . 
  not only that , but a grandson of the former king did also literally shoot himself in the foot . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/9195149/spanish-king-juan-carlos-grandson-shoots-himself-in-foot.html i guess it should be clear by now why plenty of spaniards prefer the flag of the spanish _ republic _ as flair . 
  how ? 
  see the title of this article . 
  none of the main two parties wants to even talk with other parties `` that want to discuss the territorial integrity '' . 
  so how do you propose that would happen ? 
  not only it 's not a payment processor , but it 's also a us storefront . . 
  in that they 're actually asking the people about how should the party proceed ? 
  no , you can not get a unionpay card outside china . 
  which is ? 
  did n't anyone else thought it _ extremely suspicious _ that _ all _ the international payment processors are us companies ? 
  specially after the snowden revelations ... 
  in fact , i 've always wondered why was russia content with this situation . 
  and why not french ? 
  i think that most spaniards ' complete lack of english is ridiculous , but you should n't forget that after all spain is on the ( small ) french bubble of influence of europe , not the english or german or whatever one . 
  try asking around how many people in here speak french , specially politicians ( spoiler : many ) . 
  in fact , they 'll argue _ french _ was supposed to be the political language of the union . 
  note however that for the average street layman spanish is the only option -- the reason is that they have this feeling they do n't need to learn any other language . 
  and it 's probably true , since in most touristy places you 'll find several speakers of spanish , which kind of reinforces the feeling . 
  similar to what happens in the us , 
  what does a catalan do when the weather is cold ? 
  he comes closer to the stove . 
  and when the weather is really , really cold ? 
  he lights it . 
  ***** a catalan on his deathbed , few minutes left to live , calls for his family : - my dear wife , is she there ? 
  - yes , dear , i am . 
  - and you , my son , are you by my side ? 
  - yes , father . 
  - then why the fuck is the hall 's light still on !?!, 
   especially , having the character of blind , passionate , or unreasonable adherence to a party wait . 
  are you trying to argue that that podemos adherence to itself is unreasonable ? 
  in the huge majority of regions in spain they won they were running under _ other parties ' _ banners !, 
  there 's a reason so-called left-wing parties in spain are usually fragmented and `` trigger-prone '' to unite , then dissolve , then build a coalition , ... ideals are over party entities . 
   by number of parties , yes , by the popular support of those parties , no . 
  if you ignore support for the base party , then it 's also the case by both number of votes and number of representatives . 
  almost no one is willing to agree on anything with any of the bigger parties ; that is at the root of the current `` problem '' in parliament . 
  and out of the smaller parties , podemos is , without a doubt , the one with largest available number of options . 
  ( and well , unless you believe in pp+psoe ), 
   on the contrary , if they reach the power their actions will be as partisan as pp 's ones , we are seeing it in the municipal councils they control . 
  what kind of criticism is that ? 
  how can a party not be . . partisan ? 
   what is in fact healthy is to watch two opposite parties agree the diagnosis of the problems and reaching tradeoffs . 
  it is ironic that you mention this and then go and mention that podemos is not a step in the good direction . 
  by number of parties willing to negotiate with them , podemos is at this moment the head of the list . 
  the list of possible agreements in fact becomes quite short only the moment you include one of bigger two parties . 
   who spoke of `` dictating from madrid '' ? 
  i do not care where the basic lines of educational policy are set , in madrid , barcelona , brussels or the international space station , as long as they focus on results and avoid setting artificial barriers to understanding and mobility to pamper to the vanities of small-town politicians . 
  and who could disagree with that ? 
  who could actually care where the basic lines of educational policy are set ? 
  you :  quite frankly , when i see what the regional governments of all colours have done to education , i 'd rather prefer that they get as little leeway on that issue as possible . 
  _ you _ think that the region governments have converted educational policy into some kind of `` endoctrination '' . 
  these governments will say that the indoctrination , if any , actually comes from federal policy and they 're removing it . 
   anyway , strange to see that , for you , maths and science can be `` dictated '' . 
   stem contents ( science , technology , engineering and mathematics ) can actually be checked for accuracy and yet the simple question -- what do you actually teach and what you do n't -- can not . 
  which is basically at the root of these disputes . 
   the way to fight bias is by encouraging discussion and proper sourcing of information , not by bringing up your own bias . 
  and what do you think they 're doing ? 
   as many people as possible i.e. 
  the current situation . 
   no , i 'm an example of somebody who does n't want to feed toxic bullshit to infants , regardless of whose brand of toxic bullshit it is . 
  this is fallacious . 
  what you 're argued is :  but at the same time , i do n't see why catalan maths or science should be any different from madrid maths or science . 
  and you believe that dictating maths and science from madrid will guarantee that no `` toxic bullshit is fed to infants '' . 
  well , not only that is not a given , but for the 3rd time , it basically puts you straight in the 1st camp . 
  the `` more autonomy '' camp will argue that in order to remove the extreme bias and bullshit that comes from the federal educational policy ( or anything else ) , they need to make their own . 
  i 've not been able to find any valid counterargument to that . 
   these are not the specifics , they are the basics . 
  well then , i do not want to argue the specifics or the basics . 
   yes , fact-based policies yes , dangerous . 
  who decides what 's fact ? 
   sorry , but you do n't have a point , because you `` do n't want to argue about this '' . 
  you 're an example of a proponent of `` central '' government meddling in something most people in the `` more autonomy '' camp actually believe it is a state issue . 
  my other point is after much search the only way i 've found to fix this is to either secession or federalize . 
  i see it as the fairest result . 
  let the states that want less autonomy merge together , and thus they can have the extra money for whatever they 'd feel like . 
  let the states that want more autonomy have more autonomy and `` waste their money '' . 
  as long as it 's their citizens money . 
  any other option would be unfair . 
  what i do not want to discuss is the specifics of education policy . 
  that 's because of personal reasons and nothing else . 
   i guess the rednecks in texas are then also right to try to replace evolution with `` creation science '' in the biology curriculum . 
  there 's a majority in the polls , you know . 
  they have _ a right to _ , in fact .
