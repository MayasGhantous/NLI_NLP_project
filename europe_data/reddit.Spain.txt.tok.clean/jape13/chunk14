  despite being anti-catholic , i 'm also one of those `` i hate your ideas but i will die to defend your right to say them '' guy . 
  i will also call you an idiot for having them , though , and you 'll have to accept that . 
   accepting democratic choices does not preclude from argueing against then certainly . 
  i 'm not arguing about education policy out of personal reasons . 
  you 're free to do so with whoever else you want . 
   especially when they are objectively misguided . 
  dangerous waters you 're treading there . 
   are there cultural specificities ( not least language ) that need to be dealt with locally ? 
  yes , certainly . 
  but at the same time , i do n't see why catalan maths or science should be any different from madrid maths or science . 
  and do n't get me started on history : instead of sitting together and working out a factual curriculum , supported by a consensus of reputable historians from across the globe , each little education chieftain tries to endoctrinate the children under their purview with propaganda that would n't be out of place in the xix century yes , you just keeping cementing yourself on the first camp . 
  as i said , i do n't want to argue about this . 
  but a majority of people in . . `` these '' regions are _ actually quite happy _ with their regional policies , as seen on the polls . 
  what you call `` indoctrination '' they see as removing someone else 's indoctrination . 
  and again , all this does is proving my point . 
  by the way :  i ca n't stand this `` oh , there are two different camps , let 's split the cake in the middle '' position i ca n't either , which is why i think the `` political centre '' is an illusion . 
  but the `` coward option '' ? 
  i do not want to argue about educational policy ; i fully respect your opinion . 
  it 's just that :  economies of scale are important  the basic necessities are pretty much the same regardless of the territory two out of of your three arguments put you dead on on the `` it 's a redundant waste of money '' camp that i mentioned above . 
  the other camp will argue that education is a basic cultural regional/territorial-specific necessity , refuting your second argument , and thus the feel that they need to spend money on it , refuting your first argument . 
  and that 's the reason you 've proved my point . 
  you 're centered on the `` more centralization '' camp ( at least on this topic ) . 
  in a few hours , someone from the other camp ( most probably with an estelada as flair ) will come in and argue the exact opposite . 
  no civil discussion is possible in this environment . 
  which is why i think the country needs to split off or ( my favorite ) become more federal in nature so that we can finally stop with these discussions and make progress , . 
  no surprises there , you 're just proving my point . 
   so let me ask you . 
  do n't you know anyone that voted pp ? 
  are they all people you despise or disrespect ? 
  does n't your grandma or some friend vote for them ? 
  if your mother voted pp , would you think she 's a bad person ? 
  would you stop talking to her ? 
  < irony  yes , i would immediately declare war on them and proceed to kill them all . 
  i only want intelligent people in this world . 
  anyone who is not intelligent is never to be talked to and to be disposed of as quickly as possible . 
  < / irony  if someone still votes pp today , then they are stupid . 
  it does n't mean that they are a bad person . 
  it 's not a coincidence that you used `` grandma '' as an example . 
  that 's pp 's primary voter base -- illiterate old people that have been out of touch with politics for a decade at best . 
  [ in fact , the biggest worry to pp is literally their voter base passing off ] ( http://listocomics.com/comic/994-los-votantes/ ) . 
  and that is a _ fact _ as per the polls . 
  says something , does n't it ? 
  these people 's votes are , at best , a burden to this country . 
   honestly , i think it would be pretty sad if any decent person you interact with has the same political ideas than you . 
  great , so according to you there 's pp and then there 's `` all other political ideas '' , which you dump on the same lot . 
  < irony  for a political discussion to be relevant , you need to include pp on it . 
  nothing else matters . 
  < / irony  well , let me tell you something : pp has _ still _ no concrete electoral program . 
  their most defining characteristic is their corruption and lunacy ( e.g. 
  secretaries still talking about their guardian angels that help them find free parking lots . 
  which they actually name . 
  in public . ) . 
  a _ political _ discussion that includes pp is impossible since there 's _ literally _ nothing to argue in their favor . 
   have n't you ever met someone who you totally disagree with but is incredibly sharp and intelligent ? 
  everyone that has different political views happens to be stupid and flawed ? 
  you really need to live in a very limited and homogenous world to see things like that . 
  again , i find myself wondering whether you are obnoxious or have a huge agenda here . 
  i respect political ideas ; _ i do n't respect literal thieves or people who vote for literal thieves . _  do you realize that you do n't have to have that kind of worldview to vote pp ? 
  do you know that there are atheists and people with socially liberal views that voted pp ? 
  oh yes i know that there 's a of stupid people who will vote for a party that does n't share their views . 
  that 's the reason anyone votes for pp : because they have no idea . 
   corruption is unavoidable to a certain extent enuff said . 
  anyone who still thinks that voting into power people who are as of today [ _ literally running away from justice _ ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/politica/gomez-serna-revalidaria-segovia-pp_0_464754294.html ) immediately loses all my respect . 
  and their crimes are not political ( which i would have no problem with ) ; they 're laundering , bribing , embezzlement , graft , influence padding , nepotism , patronage , ... . 
  why does the average spaniard still know more of these terms than the rest of europe ? 
  ciu has an extremely long history of supporting pp . 
  even when their current charade started they were still voting in favor of pp 's proposals in parliament . 
   as much as i disagree with the pp , as much as they represent the opposite of what i support and defend , there is people that i love and respect that voted pp . 
  there is intelligent and compassive people that voted pp . 
  it 's ignorant and dangerous to assume that all the millions of pp voters are stupid , evil , selfish , fascists . 
  i can respect anyone having ( in my opinion stupid ) ultra-conservative , catholic , right-wing opinion . 
  i can not respect anyone voting for a party that is [ _ proven _ to be corrupt to the core ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/politica/ley_del_indulto-ministerio_de_justicia-psoe-rafael_catala_0_386712182.html ) , comprised almost entirely [ of lunatics ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-virgin-mary-wins-a-medal-in-spainand-triggers-a-lawsuit-1412649002 ) . 
  at this point , `` intelligent '' people and voting pp are _ incompatible _ on the same sentence , _ unless _ you are directly benefiting from their schemes . 
  in which case you _ are intelligent _ , but also evil , and thus you also lose my respect . 
  a very specific example is that the `` federal '' government still has the final say on stuff such as education policy . 
  the `` regions '' are also poorly drawn ; e.g. 
  half of them want less autonomy and more centralization , and the other half want more autonomy . 
  thus , there 's constant nitpicking regarding what is a redundant waste of money and what is a `` cultural regional necessity '' . 
   politics in spain are particularely more left-wing . 
  a common myth for many spaniards , but not at all true . 
  our psoe is actually more right-wing than germany 's spd ( http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1017/s0022381614000449 ) . 
  also check votewatch.eu to compare european parties . 
  [ are you sure we live on the same country ] ( http://www.tufuncion.com/images/evolucion-salarios.png ) ? 
   is it determined by their social policies , their economic and fiscal policies , or a combination of both ? 
  this is the reason the political spectrum has more than one axis . 
  but calling a laissez-faire proponent party `` center '' is _ misleading _ at best . 
  terrible . 
  pp , cs and upyd at _ the centre _ ??????? 
  and podemos , who has publicly criticized anti-capitalism , at the far left ??? 
  every time i hear that i can not help but be repulsed since it 's literally the same catch phrase used by artur mas of all people . 
  because there was n't any . 
  in most provinces it 's been basically subsumed by podemos ( e.g. 
  david bravo ) . 
  in catalonia for ex . 
  they are explicitly with podemos . 
   centre is liberal both in terms of social and economic issues centre is midpoint between laissez-faire ( i.e. 
  extreme economic liberalism ) and literally , state-run economy ( i.e. 
  extreme communism , far-left ) . 
  at the same time , it is mid-point between conservative policies ( i.e. 
  religious nutjobs such as pp ) and progressive .
