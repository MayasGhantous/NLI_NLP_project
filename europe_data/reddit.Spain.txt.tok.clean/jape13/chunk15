  only someone from the us ( ... or poland , it seems ) assumes laissez-faire capitalism ( _ literally _ the most liberal and extreme rampant capitalism ) to be at the center of the political spectrum . 
  it 's even on wikipedia . 
   it can be hard to keep track of all the multitude of parties and their relevance when you 're a native/living there . 
  i hate these types of threads because basically they subject you to the bias of the original poster . 
  for example , there was a different summary a few days ago on this same subreddit , but this one has been stickied instead because it has been posted closer to the d-day . 
  a wiki would be better for this , i agree . 
   support laissez-faire policies and deregulatio since when that 's `` center '' ? 
  it 's basically the text-book definition of right-wing . 
  this is europe , not the us . 
   definitely to the left of the pp agreed , but pp is nowhere near the center either . 
   answer this question : did catsiqueespot support independence ? 
  did catsiqueespot support the opposite outcome ? 
  consider that for example quite a few of their representatives actually voted for the secessionist plan from jxsi . 
  ( note : i 'm secessionist -- more federalist than anything else -- and yet i would have voted against any plan from jxsi/mas , yet csqp did ) . 
   what 's stopping 3 guys in their shed to ask for self determination ? 
  a century ago , it would have been the ability to raise and maintain an army strong enough to defend their claim . 
  i hope that these days the ` threshold ' is more civilized , such as for example the ability for the new state to maintain the necessary infrastructure without `` offshoring '' everything to the neighboring ones . 
  welcome to this subreddit !, 
   high turnout election ( un ) surprisingly , seems that predictions of turnout are n't that high . 
  yes , that 's the way to solve the other `` huge '' problems of europe : let 's restrict human rights and freedom until human rights violations become the number one `` huge '' problem of europe . 
   yes , i believe teaching people to ignore basic human rights violets my and other people 's human rights . 
  ok , let 's censor this subreddit ... 
  oh my , those europeans [ even have refrigerators ] ( http://angryblackladychronicles.com/2011/08/18/the-daily-show-on-class-warfare-poor-people-have-refrigerators-shock-horror/ ) !, 
  no , not that . 
  while he was in catalonia he made alliances with ... [ problematic parties ] ( http://www.elrevolucionario.org/rev.php?articulo1356 ) . 
  in addition , much like pp , they voted against any proposal that had [ any resemblance to a public condemnation of fascism and/or franquismo ] ( https://ciutadanstarragona.wordpress.com/2007/10/25/albert-rivera-cataluna-no-necesita-mirar-por-el-retrovisor-sino-centrarse-en-el-futuro/ ) . 
  riveras himself was a member of pp 's new generations in the dates where [ this crap happened ] ( http://larepublica.es/2007/12/01/nuevas-generaciones-del-pp-exalta-la-dictadura/ ) . 
  he is very quick to never mention all of that these days , and their party has recently made some moves against fascism , but their roots still show sometimes . 
  suit yourself : http://www.bing.com/search?q=rivera+pp+miembros that 's another problem with the spanish voters today , they do n't even spend one second to google about the parties they say they prefer . 
  it 's a short article , come on : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/os_grandes_portugueses  basically , public tv network made a poll relatively recently about which portuguese dead personality was the `` greatest ever '' and portugal 's 40year dictator ended up winning . 
  the polling method was not very formal though , so it 's not that important , just ... makes one think . 
  imagine that happening on , say , germany . 
  yet it is not that uncommon in southern europe fascist dictatorships . . 
   but while our wounds are healed , pretty much , you still have many to heal . 
  it 's surprising how many people in spain forget that our `` transformation '' to democracy was amongst the worst in the world . 
  it can only be compared with that of russia : lots of coups , terrorism everywhere , and many rulers of the `` old order '' basically still ruling today with total impunity . 
  even portugal 's one was by any objective measure much better handled . 
  even if we take into account that messy `` the greatest portuguese '' stuff . 
  i could excuse younglings about forgetting this , since they were taught in school that our democratization was purrrfect and a role model for the rest of the world . 
  absolutely nothing of importance happened . 
  but i 'm more worried about the people who lived through it . 
  most of their members come from right-wing parties ( pp * cough * ) so it 's not that far fetched . 
  also , riveras has a fascist background ; whether he shows it or not it 's a different story . 
  with the ruling party being basically proud of their fascist roots , at least a party that tries to hide it is a welcome change ... 
  but still , right-wing . 
  people in this subreddit would most probably consider the end of the eu as a _ good thing _ !, 
  edit : see below . . * sigh * . 
  as i always say , the old spanish proverb `` m\u00e1s vale malo conocido que bueno por conocer '' ( translates more or less to `` the devil you know ... '' ) is the root of all political troubles with spain . 
  people ( specially _ old _ people ) prefer to keep voting the same fascist party rather than trying anything new , because , `` spain could end up like ~ ~ venezuela ~ ~ ~ ~ greece ~ ~ syria ! '', 
  they fail to realize we 're already like greece , part of the set of `` laughing stock '' countries of europe . 
  and give it a few years , and this will be worse than russia . . 
  respectable eu countries bashing other eu countries , criticizing their internal policies , their `` 2nd gear '' economy , etc. 
  this is the end of the eu ... 
   you needed to learn latin and adopt to the roman superculture if you wanted to have more then local influence but it was n't imposed on minorities directly well , that clearly explains the reason almost every territory once conquered by rome speaks a latin-derived language !, 
  oh , wait a second ... 
  and 80 million germans , assuming 99 % of them have reasonable moral values that prevent them from engaging into indiscriminate killing of refugees despite the messages from xenophobic extremists , it 's still 800,000 people that does not . 
  if only 0.1 % of them are crazy enough to actually plan an attack , it 's still 800 potentially genocidal people . 
  i say we center on that problem first . 
  percentages work both ways and this is a dangerous road you 're going down . 
   if not migrants , then the sons or grandsons of migrants . 
  do you happen to know just how much % of the population is `` grandsons of migrants '' ? 
  there are countries whose _ entire _ population is composed of grandsons of migrants . 
   there are false rape claims for example which could persuade a small minority aha !, 
  and there you have the source of your strangely distorted `` minorities '' . 
   not only do you have to go one step further and say ` all non members of your group deserve to die ' note the original poll does not say that . 
  so where do you draw the line ? 
  i mean , have you looked at stuff like http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-18/charts-attitudes-to-violence-against-women/5750014 ? 
  a whopping 12 % would still blame a woman for things like _ rape _ . 
  that would be like , 1 million - 2 million men in australia _ only _ . 
  and it 's the first poll that came up after googling , there 's sure to be plenty of it of similar unintuitive results . 
  i know by heart that if you were to make a poll in my country almost 25 % would happen to say they 'd prefer it if spain 's hitler-fascist-dictator equivalent came back to power ( and life ) . 
  it 's very easy to get into strong distortions when you 're trying to poll minorities . 
  this is the reason you should not go into the raw data and extract conclusions , rather use the normal statistical procedures for it . 
   but not when that number ranges from 13 to 40 % that is misleading too , since few countries reach 40 % . 
   the report is putting a positive spin on it , saying that the majority of muslims do n't support killing in the name of islam . 
  that is true . 
  it would also be true if the numbers were 51 % for no killing , 49 % for killing . . no : it says that on most countries there 's a _ clear _ majority . 
  51 % vs 49 % would be statistical error ( ask catalans ) . 
   the guy above is saying that yes , while the majority do not support killing in the name of islam , a significant enough minority do that it 's worrisome . 
  _ in a few countries _ . 
  curiously , we 've been at war with all of them in the past 50 years . 
  what data can be extracted from here ? 
  they are not around . 
  troll pages such as `` thereligionofpeace dot com '' love quoting the parts of studies they like and ignore the parts that do n't align with their agenda . 
  in fact , this four-year study from pew actually concludes :  muslims around the world strongly reject violence in the name of islam . 
  [ ... ] asked specifically about suicide bombing , clear majorities in most countries say such acts are rarely or never justified as a means of defending islam from its enemies, 
  actually it 's an instinct to `` never let a good crisis go to waste '' . 
  it 's even mentioned in kant 's books for christ 's sake . 
   the fact that there have been misguided invasions in the past ( irak ... ) does n't mean we should stop all military interventions for ever . 
  but this one looks exactly like that one . 
  virtually _ whatever action you take _ , you 're going to make more enemies than what we have now . 
  turks . 
  or iraqis . 
  or turkey . 
  or rebels . 
  or putin . 
  it 's not such an unpopular opinion : just [ refuse to be terrorized ] ( https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/11/refuse_to_be_te_2.html ) . 
   the european comission is just as much not-elected as the us congress . 
  it is actually more like the us president and cabinet . 
  hardly `` unelected '' , but certainly not directly elected .
