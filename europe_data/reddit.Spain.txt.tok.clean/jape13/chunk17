  killing schengen will _ kill europe _ much faster than any type of terrorism would . 
  that would also be an oversimplification . 
  not even failed assimilation causes radicalization . 
  there are many ostracized ghettos and other minorities in europe that would be counterexamples . 
  i do n't get your analogy , sorry . 
  and besides , i 'm just saying it 's funny . 
  it would be stupid to assume any causality relation out of this correlation . 
  i do n't understand why people are so quick to pull the trigger and release the bombs and send our soldies to die in far-away lands just for revenge or to avoid future terrorist acts ( if you have other reasons please do n't read the rest of the post ) . 
  so far , most of daesh terrorism ( 99 % ) _ has been centered towards other muslims _ . 
  if suddenly european armies `` liberate '' most of the territory they 're currently `` ruling '' ( aka terrorizing ) , what do you think they 'll do with their sudden ample free time ? 
  the number of terrorists will just increase tenfold , and they _ will _ target europa . 
  i 'm not saying we should n't bomb daesh back to stone age ( if they are n't already in the stone age by the time i write this ) , but that it surprises me that people are not thinking clearly of the repercussions of their acts _ before launching the bombs _ . 
  it 's funny no one thought of actually looking _ into the actual study _ . 
   https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3466/perceptions-are-not-reality-things-the-world-gets-wrong.aspx that 's where the data for the chart comes from . 
  it turns out that the goal of the study was exactly to measure that bias . 
  still the study 's quite informal , from what i see . 
  well , since so far what i 've seen is extremism _ against _ islam ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/07/16/extremism-concerns-growing-in-west-and-predominantly-muslim-countries/ ) raise many times faster than the number of actual muslims coming to europe , i 'm going to remain skeptical on any claims of `` invasion '' . 
  and also trust actual studies done by us & european demographists before random posts on reddit . 
  if these `` delusional '' scientific studies do n't work then what 's left to believe in ? 
  funnily there 's indeed a significant correlation . 
  citizens of countries with higher amount of muslims tend to see islam as more compatible with the west than citizens of countries with next-to-none muslim population . 
   what are we to expect in another half a century a whopping 11 % .

  what the fuck ??? 
  did n't you learn _ anything _ from this chart at all ? 
   go draw a cartoon of mohammed and then get back to us . 
  i guess you were n't here during this year 's draw mohammed day ? 
  but i was actually expecting this reply , because i happen to know quite a good counterexample . 
  i know of a spanish political satire magazine , el jueves , which were quite happy to draw cartoons of mohammed even during the 2006 attacks . 
  that magazine was actually killed indeed . 
  they forced them to remove a cartoon of spain 's current king . 
  eventually this led to all major cartoonists from that magazine quitting . 
  i am sorry , but the real censorship comes from within europe . 
  it can not yet be realistically imposed by external countries at this point . 
  with every cartoonist they kill , 10 others start drawing . 
   why let even more people who might hate western ideals into your country ? 
  _ no one _ wants to explicitly do that . 
  what no one wants to do either is to catapult migrants back into their own homecountries to die by the same terrorists that have murdered people here . 
  i 'm sure there must be some middle ground . 
  the irony of all this is that those who fantasize are most probably descendants of the original barbarians which came to `` ruin '' rome . 
   history can be a harsh mistress sometimes ... 
  i say we kill all those pesky goths !, 
  they 're just barbaric !, 
  and we can fix every european problem just by killing the entire north of it !, 
  ( also / s ) . 
  see how ridiculous it is to compare strategies from 2 millenia ago to modern times ? 
   classical survivor bias . 
  since there are fewer plane hijacks , clearly this means that security measures were for naught and we should remove them all . 
  the original poster did not actually mention any specific reason for why the security measures should be removed , though . 
  for this specific topic i recommend reading https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/11/beyond_security.html . 
  but in general i think his point is clear . 
   people die of cancer ? 
  that 's sad . 
  now _ that _ is not only cynical but also quite psychotic , because you 're suggesting that the goal is to have tourists , consumers , restaurants and concerts rather than saving human lives . 
  i 'm still so eurocentric i still think `` we '' refers to the eu , 
   well we had the largest terrorist attack in history , so does it help ? 
  no , that 's wrong . 
  the recent attacks in spain were `` larger '' and that 's just from memory . 
  i 'm sure a cursory search in wikipedia will reveal many more . 
   the point is how many more ? 
  how many more deaths by something as trivial as obesity until we take radical action against it ? 
  cars ? 
  planes ? 
  air pollution ? 
  and many good will proposals to help fix the `` terrorism '' problem will not only not realistically reduce the number of terrorist attacks , but will certainly help destabilize even more regions of the world . 
  imagine someone proposes banning cars to help fix the `` car fatalities '' problem . 
  oh well , maybe that 's some compromise i may not want to take . 
  i 'll say that cars may help more people than the deaths they cause . 
  similarly , there are many `` solutions '' to the terrorism problem that i wo n't take . 
  including sending our soldiers to die in far-away lands , or refusing help to people dying in my country 's borders . 
  how can you even go to a concert without `` participating in traffic '' ? 
  i bet you need to cross a few roads ... 
  ignoring that , the risk is still minimal . 
  what are your realistic chances of dying because of a terroristic attack ? 
  by breathing in the air on your average european city , you have an higher risk of dying from pulmonary cancer than by a terrorist attack . 
  no , i 'm not making this up : http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/ . 
  this is specially true in paris and other big capitals which often have borderline murderous pollution levels . 
  the big picture is clear and terrorism is insignificant . 
  it 's not `` putting our lifestyle in danger '' any more than the volkswagen polution lies are . 
  our reaction to terrorism , on the other hand ... 
   it is wiping out our freedom . 
  terrorism has not really wiped any of my freedoms so far . 
  the response from european states , on the other side , has severely curtailed my freedoms and they keep planning on adding more censorship laws . 
  no , actually that was the french citizen . 
   in modern times while true , these `` modern times '' started only around 40 years ago for christianity . 
  as an apostate , i would have been _ executed _ in this country . 
  even today , it is still terribly difficult for me to stop my taxes from financing the vatican . 
  and this does n't happen only on my country ; many european countries still pose plenty of problems to apostates : http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/05/28/which-countries-still-outlaw-apostasy-and-blasphemy/ as said , it is still much better than e.g. 
  saudi arabia ( they executed someone for witchcraft this very week ) . 
  but we 're only 40 years advanced , not centuries . 
   closing the borders to all should be the first priority yes , let 's undo a few decades of work that we all europeans have managed to do all because of a tragic event during one night . 
  votes in favor ? 
  did you know that the democratically elected representatives of the eu countries have all agreed on certain quotes of immigrants ? 
  that would very much be the law . 
  and yet i even explicitly mentioned not to take things out of context . 
  but hey , if we 're not adults enough in here to actually talk about actual dangers to human life , can i ask why you have n't ignored me yet ? 
  yeah . 
  tell that to me . 
  but it 's going to be hard to try and change the mood on this subreddit . 
  even / r/worldnews seems to actually be more sensible to the issues at hand , and that 's saying much ...
