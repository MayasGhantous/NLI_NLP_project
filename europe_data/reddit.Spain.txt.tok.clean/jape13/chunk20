  why can the catalonian government not at least attempt that avenue ? 
  the constitution was amended very recently in fact . 
  the change was to make sure that keeping public debt `` balanced '' would trump all the other human rights guaranteed by the constitution . 
  yes , this happened . 
  literally . 
  and it was ratified by all the major parties in congress . 
  no referendum . 
  the popular saying is that a german citizen 's vote had more weight in this `` amendment '' than a spanish one . 
  i do n't want to enter into that discussion , but it also shows how much fucked up this country is . 
  this always bothers me . 
  it 's clear that at the core of this country there 's a shitton of people that does n't want to hear about `` autonomies '' , `` federation '' or `` states '' of any kind and just wants centralism . 
  but then again the entire `` state of the autonomies '' was basically created because there 's also a few minorities in the `` extremes '' : basques , navarra , catalonia , andalusia , galicia , etc. 
  that actually wanted some level of autonomy or otherwise they 'd be a source of `` problems '' ( eta , terralliure , * cough * ) . 
  so why the fuck ca n't we just split the damn country ? 
  let those who want more autonomy form their own satellite states . 
  let those in the core who want less autonomy sodomize themselves to the central government as hard as they 'd like . 
  the centralists will have their own centralist state and they would save a shitton of money having less `` autonomic '' infrastructure . 
  the secessionists will have their own states and they can waste as much money as they want on their `` cultural/imperialist '' endeavors . 
  everyone is happy . 
  i just ca n't figure out why the fuck anyone would see a problem with this . 
   i guess more than today , since the catalan government wo n't be able to use the oppression card and use madrid as a scapegoat anymore and will have to directly face its faults . 
  which will be a bad awakening . 
  so one less scapegoat !, 
  everyone will be better then , right ? 
   especially corruption would very likely increase in an independent state studies actually show the opposite ...  while economy would likely get worse maybe ...  as well as conflicts among spaniards and catalan-speaking spaniards . 
  even more than those pp is trying to create _ today _ ? 
  what does that have to do with secession ? 
  even if no serious issues were solved by disbanding this country ( i disagree ) , why would that be an impediment to secession ? 
  are you going to , exactly like corruptpujol did , say `` ara no toca '' ? 
  ( literally : `` now 's not the time '' ), 
  in addition , the ussr had an actual written clause allowing secession of member states . 
  not saying i disagree with the fact cdc has fucked us ( spain ) for lots of years , but what did you expect ? 
  if you go around spain reminding them how much pp has fucked them for decades , the best you 'll get is a comment about your `` far-left extremism '' . 
  the worst you 'll get is a black eye . 
  pp is a similar `` far left '' party with huge support , so it 's quite understandable the average catalan would react in the same way . 
  it just shows ... 
  correct . 
  `` quite probable '' , i 've said . 
   parliament solemnly declares ** the beginning of the process ** of creating independent catalan state as a republic . 
  emphasis mine . 
  in addition ,  the process of ** democratic disconnection ** will not be conditioned to decisions of spain 's insitituions , specially those from the supreme court which is what i said . 
  i 'm sure that you 'll argue the `` democratic '' in the above sentence is just window dressing , but i disagree . 
  i have a vague d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu of arguing with you in fact . 
  and i remember saying that in fact , what the previous elections show is that it is quite probable that in a referendum the yes-option would win with majority to spare . 
  except maybe corruptconvergencia , who i personally still believe to be a unionist party , no one wants to secede without a referendum . 
   that was my original question . 
  there is nothing that can be done ? 
  no negotiations with madrid , or with the other regions ? 
  no agreements that can be reached ? 
  the constitution makes all referenda illegal ? 
  the constitution may make referendums with these types of questions illegal . 
  we do n't know that . 
  we will never know because the supreme court is highly politicized in this country . 
  the catalan parliament tried to pass a law enabling these kinds of referendums . 
  it was preventively suspended by the spanish supreme court `` for reasons '' . 
  the actual suspension document is in http://ep00.epimg.net/descargables/2014/09/29/1dbcb394a7f84a48b08341f9b5091bc3.pdf . 
  you 'll note it is less than a page long . 
  as of this day ( more than a year has passed ) there has been no ruling at all , despite the fact that there was a 5 month deadline given in the original suspension . 
  and here 's the problem : there may never be a ruling until the executive branch says so . 
  as i said , this country is a joke . 
  corruptconvergencia may be assuming that . 
  the cup does n't . 
  cqsp does n't . 
  i do n't . 
  i personally wo n't accept any secession plan that has not been voted in a referendum . 
  the problem is that we can not legally hold that referendum . 
  thus we might be in the ironic position that we need to ignore the spanish constitution to be able to hold this referendum . 
  which is exactly what was voted today in parliament . 
  i agree that the clearly-yes parties scored less than 50 % of the votes . 
  what i 'm saying is that extrapolating `` independence is a no-go '' from that result is wrong . 
  precisely because as you yourself admit you do n't even know the opinions of `` the rest '' of parties . 
   it was extremely clear before the elections which parties one had to vote in order to get independence . 
  it was n't . 
  i 've argued this _ several times in the past _ . 
  i voted for cqsp because they promised there would be a referendum . 
  i did n't vote for either corruptconvergencia or cup 's we-don ` t-know-where-we-want-to-go . 
   do n't mind the status quo you 're extrapolating there . 
  in any case `` do n't mind the status quo '' works in both directions . 
  yet that would also be an extrapolation . 
   you 've rephrased it wrongly and changed my question . 
  fair enough . 
   are there `` legal '' avenues the catalonian government could pursue that would get them a vote on independence ? 
  you 've also slightly changed the question here . 
  the answer to this specific question is `` no '' . 
   if you are talking about the torredembarra case , it 's from 2012 , so even at a bare minimum that would mean they took 3 years to `` avoid interfering with the elections '' ? 
  yeah , sure ... 
   i 'm not disputing your points , simply pointing out that an agreement was struck and the current approach of the catalan independence movement is to simply pretend that agreement is n't valid . 
  you ca n't sign up to a constitution and then decide your signature no longer counts when you find it no longer suits you . 
  why not ? 
  we 've done it hundreds of times in the past . 
  it 's the reason new constitutions are made all the time . 
  the only problem here is that last time it was a religious fascist nut with huge army backing . 
  we 're trying to do it without an army this time , and thus the reason they 're laughing at our asses . 
   are there not avenues catalonia can explore that do n't involve essentially reneging on their agreements ? 
  is tearing up the constitution the only way catalonia can progress towards independence ? 
  let me rephrase that for you : _ is changing the constitution the only way this country can progress ? _ and at this point , i 'd say `` yes '' . 
   this is hardly some ancient document we 're discussing here , it is well inside living memory . 
  i would disagree with the `` living memory '' part , with polls showing voters have n't even read it ... but to discuss that i 'd need to listen to http://sadviolin.com/ for a few more hours . 
   again , considering the approval rating in the referendum , the spanish people were pretty unanimous in supporting it . 
  and i 've already made my point in the previous post .
