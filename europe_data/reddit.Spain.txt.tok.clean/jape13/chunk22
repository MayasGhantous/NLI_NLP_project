  you then proceed and say `` it 's bullshit '' because  50 % did not vote with the unilateral secession proposed by jxsi . 
  well , as _ you yourself _ say below , this _ does not mean _ that  50 % of voters are against independence . 
  it just means that  50 % of voters are against the unilateral declaration of independence of jxsi . 
  ( that includes me ) . 
  so it turns out it 's not bullshit !, 
  ** it 's plain wrong to say that `` more than half of catalans are against independence '' ** . 
  in fact , the only logical conclusion from this plebiscite is that , if a proper referendum was made , there 's a huge probability `` yes '' would win with margin to spare . 
  but this is just an extrapolation . 
  we 've been over this in every other thread about this topic , remember ? 
  could you please think a bit before replying ? 
  like , at least be coherent with yourself within your own posts . 
  it 's not hard , and the overall discussion quality improves . 
   and then organize an independence referendum hey , so because there is a big chance an actual independence referendum would be won , you suggest the government resort to gerrymandering in order to ensure a `` no '' victory ? 
  stay classy ... this is so funny . 
  do you complain about downvotes _ in this subreddit _ ? 
  at least 30 % of catalans are in favor of independence because of cultural reasons . 
  this is the `` background noise '' that has always voted yes in secession polls even during pujol 's `` now it 's not the time '' and aznar 's `` i speak catalan '' days . 
  you might not be able to understand it , and that 's ok . 
  but please do n't say `` no one really cares about '' . 
   it 's just that catalonia 's issue has a great , potentially far-reaching political and economical relevance inside the eu . 
  but only if _ spain plays the eu card _ . 
  if they do n't , exactly what ramifications will it have in the eu ? 
  because i literally see none . 
  it 's not bullshit . 
  as _ you yourself _ admit a few posts below , being against unilateral secession proposed by jxsi does not mean being against independence . 
  but they did n't . 
  so now you will have to actually listen to what the communists have to say and perhaps even make a few arrangements with them . 
  they will , of course , need to severely trade off their goals . 
  what you can not do is to completely ignore the opinions of half a million voters because you say so . 
  if you want to go against democracy , then i propose we ignore your opinion . 
  with democracy ? 
  not only it was not repelled , it was _ welcome _ . 
  please note that the iberian peninsula had been mostly spared from the fall of the roman empire . 
  most of the classical bureaucracy kept working for hundreds of years , unlike the rest of europe where roman administration quickly disappeared . 
  when the moors ` invaded ' , they were basically _ welcome _ as they 'd guarantee protection of the then mostly civilized lifestyle versus the pagan barbarics that were coming from the north . 
  at the time , islamic civilizations _ were the world 's center of culture and development _ . 
  it was n't until some frenchmen with alexandrish aspirations got bored than the `` christian kingdoms '' started to appear in the iberian peninsula . 
  and so introduced the dark ages to a peninsula that had so far avoided them . 
   edit : at the moment this comment is at zero . 
  give up , this subreddit is insane . 
  this is the kind of headlines i 'd expect on onion or the like . 
  yet god knows why but it is being treated seriously here . 
  the solution : christian parents should fuck more in order to compensate . 
  i propose state incentives to that end . 
  ( note : irony ) . 
  speak for yourself . 
  for an overwhelming majority of today 's christians , christianity _ was _ imposed on its ancestors by force and sword . 
  middle ages , age of discovery , colonialism . 
  even in our own europe , christianism was [ basically imposed by imperial decree ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_church_of_the_roman_empire ) . 
  by the time every non-christian was called an `` heretic '' and prosecuted , christians really convinced `` by argument '' were less than 15 % of the total roman empire population . 
  a remarkable number , but `` christianity won europe by argument '' my ass . 
   christianity was essentially taken over and run by europeans very early on . 
  that is true , though . 
  signed , a ` practicing ' atheist . 
   all policy is set by the leaders of the national governments . 
  the fact that _ those leaders _ are actually under merkel 's control is actually unrelated to the eu . 
  it 's funny that on their own countries they will blame the germans and merkel , but on the comission they just agree on whatever merkel says . 
  the eu is currently being treated as the # 1 scapegoat by almost every european country ( eu member or not ) , and this is the reason it will fall . 
  see this very article . 
  a politician from the _ uk _ complaining about a german-dominated europe is almost laughably ironic . 
  the eu dances more around the uk than it does around some of its ( proper ) members . 
  highest of any european ( including greece ) and most probably any extra-european country . 
  basically , youth are leeching off their parents . 
  the only difference from greece is that parents do ( talking averages ) have a job , but i 'm sure they 'll manage to break that while trying to fix youth unemployment . 
  i really hope this really goes over the above spaniard 's head . 
  he was making a racist + elitist argument depreciating muslims . 
  then he realized half of europe basically considers him a muslim . 
  will he learn his lesson ? 
  somehow i doubt it . 
  he will keep talking about how `` these muslims do n't share the values of the west '' even while looking for a job in germany after being forced out of spain ( no job , no studies , no unemployment benefits ... -- as most youths in spain are ) . 
   a population explosion i am going to die . 
  this subreddit is fucking insane and if it was a representation of the real europe i would become a die-hard eurosceptic before finishing this sentence . 
  fortunately i know it is not . 
  but assuming that is because of refugees _ is _ racist . 
   since franco , spain had one of the most advanced forms of autonomous regional government in the world much like the lie of spain having the best banking system of the universe , which was still repeated mere days before everything went down , it turns out that democracy in spain after franco was also a lie . 
   so what has happened ? 
  basically , almost 4 years of a centralist right-wing party mostly composed of descendants from members of the franco regime . 
  this is the `` referendum '' ( intentional quotes ) from a year ago . 
   mind that in spain the constitution needs 3/5ths of parliament to agree to be changed , and the catalan estatut needs 2/3rds i think . 
  _ in parliament _ . 
  you are now confusing ( much like ` jxs ` ) direct democracy ( referendums , plebiscites , ... ) vs indirect democracy ( parliament , d'hondt 's law , etc. ) . 
  i have never heard of such a rule for referendums . 
  in fact , the _ current _ constitution was approved with as low as a 58 % of approval in referendum . 
  the only similar rule i 've seen for referendums ( specially constitutional ones ) is ensuring that at least 40 % of the entire population ( i.e. 
  including abstention ) votes for the change . 
  many independence referendums have been successful with numbers lower than that one . 
   then their stance is a no until they declare otherwise . 
  they have declared otherwise !, 
  their official stance is that they should not be counted either way . 
  that 's the entire point . 
   there must be a referendum to get a clear opinion , these elections have been hijacked . 
  hey , i fully agree with that . 
  and `` the thing '' is that these results indicate that , with a large probability , if referendum were to be made this week , yes would win with margin to spare . 
  but obviously that should be validated with a proper poll . 
  i really disagree there . 
  specially since 1 . 
  pablo himself has said that `` csqep should be the leader of catalonia 's independence process , and not mas '' 2 . 
  ** i ** actually voted csqep but i am in favor of independence , just not in favor of either corruptconvergencia , erc , or cup . 
  indeed . 
  it looks like they made a full 180 right when their campaign started .
