  why do n't you invert this into keeping old bus lines in less populated towns , that are at risk of withering away ? 
  why not banning cars in city centers all together ? 
  that 's a sure way to help keep the pollution away from our cities , but it seems that these days no one speaks about this any more ... 
  reducing the number of cars . 
  there 's no other way , electric is not really a solution , just an improvement ( which is very welcome , of course , as long as it does not end up introducing even more cars ) . 
  electric cars generate plenty pollution ; for example road/asphalt contact is one of the primary sources of small particles in cities . 
  http://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/electric-car-particulate-matter/ ignore this , and much like what happened with dieselgate , you 're at risk of discovering in 10 years that the technology you thought was `` zero pollution '' is n't . 
   electoral maps from a single election are not the best indicators of deeper ideologies it 's a good point ... but sorry , i made the counterargument a few posts above :  not only that . 
  this has also been an historical trend , at least as old as the current version of spain itself . 
  catalonia has _ always _ voted more to the left in general elections than spain , with the glaring exception of 2011 where corruptg\u00e8ncia had a `` historic '' victory ( [ google around ] ( http://www.laopiniondezamora.es/elecciones-generales-2011/2011/11/21/victoria-historica-ciu-cataluna-costa-psc/560478.html ) ) . 
  barcelona has _ always _ , ever since the start of modern spain , been a left-wing stronghold ( much more than madrid , which until 2015 was as right-wing as it gets ) . 
  corruptg\u00e8ncia managed to win during a single term only . 
  thus , whenever spain goes to the left , the silhouette of catalonia is harder to distinguish . 
  however , it 's still present in _ at least half _ of all general election results maps . 
  how can one still argue that they do n't vote different ? 
   ciu is not the party that has stolen more $ per capita nor the party with more imputed politicians per capita souuuuuuuuuuuuurceees . 
   i see you only target one party 's corruption then you are definitely blind . 
  my opinion of voters of pp is more or less at the `` they 're untermensch '' level . 
  i may center my energies battling corruptg\u00e8ncia because they are in power here , where i currently live , and despite the good news of its continuous fall in support , they 'll _ still _ be here after secession . 
  they have to be kept _ as much away as possible _ from anything related to secession , even if this means reminding people every day of the fact they 're corruptg\u00e8ncia . 
  also , i have given up on removing pp from my home land . 
  it 's worse than tilting at windmills . 
   really , i never see corruption mentioned as much as it is with any catalan thread . 
  yes , there is some hate , as i mentioned many times . 
  but that just means even _ more _ reason to get rid of corruptg\u00e8ncia as soon as possible . 
  do n't get lost from the discussion . 
  you said  catalonia votes differently mostly due to the independence movement and it turns out that was false . 
   is n't andalucia a stronghold of the psoe , and thus the left ? 
  see the map i linked . 
   it seems that removing independence only gives us shades of grey between conservatives and liberals , like in all democracies did you read what you wrote here ? 
   catalonia being more leftist than the nation as a whole so they vote different ...  seems a fairly weak argument for secession this is now besides the point , but i disagree . 
  differing political preferences is imo one of the major reasons i could think for secession . 
  smaller countries more accurately represent the ideology of the people . 
  spain would be easier to govern and catalonia would be easier to govern . 
  exempli gratia ; with catalonia out of the picture , not only would pp+c s have a larger majority , there would also be no divisive `` referendum '' issue . 
   by that logic , most european states should be jerrymandered into tiny , like-minded regions of left and right , with virtually every major city being converted into a city-state . 
  https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/slippery-slope  catalonia is trying to paint an exaggerated picture of their uniqueness again , just look at the map . 
   i started the discussion saying you were being too harsh on ciu calling them corrupt-wing or something like that and then simply saying right-wing when talking about pp . 
  and my counterargument has been that i do n't think `` pp is worse '' does , in any way or measure , reduce the scale of corrutpg\u00e8ncia 's well-known scandals . 
   corrupt anytime you mention them , or do n't call anyone that i do n't understand this logic . 
  to put this in terms appropiate to reddit , if i use the term micro $ oft , do i need to mention `` app $ e '' a few times per day too ? 
  maybe i do n't care about apple . 
  maybe i care more about micro $ oft so i center my bashing on them . 
  i 'm not a criminal court ; i can target whoever i want . 
   ciu is not the most corrupt political party by any metric i 'm not sure about that . 
  in any case , a big statement requires big proof . 
   so you either call psoe and pp corrupt anytime you mention them , or do n't call anyone that this point of view is terrible ... see above . 
   i 'm tired of us catalans being the ones being called corrupt 24/7 . 
  if you identify _ in any way _ with corruptg\u00e8ncia you 're a 24/7 corrupt . 
  same as if you identify with pp . 
   and by completely ignoring my claim that catalan corruption scandals are treated by spanish press as literally satan , are you agreeing with it ? 
  why would i need to answer it ? 
  what does this have to do with this discussion ? 
  i do n't really think `` the other 's party is as corrupt or more ! '', 
  is a justification for anything . 
  i do believe that when given with two corrupt choices you should always strive for the `` least corrupt '' , but that 's not the case here , as there 's plenty of clean slate parties to choose from . 
  however , as the most corrupt party in catalonia _ without a doubt _ , i do n't really think of corruptg\u00e8ncia voters much higher than pp ones . 
   i 'm mostly fine because this way we will end with corruption sooner than if all the shit in madrid , valencia , andalusia and baleares is treated like it is . 
  so what 's your problem here , then ? 
  spain : pp psoe podemos cs catalonia : podemos erc ciu psoe pp cs _ you _ tell me how would like to order catalonia 's voting results so that they 'd more different than they are now . 
  or if you want to compere ideologies : spain : right center left center catalonia : left left right center right center again , you tell how much more different it needs to be for you to consider it different . 
  why have the `` non-regional '' parties that succeed in catalonia ` fail ' in the rest of spain ? 
  why does catalonia have `` regional '' parties with ideologies that are different from the rest of spain ? 
  why do you think these are not indicators of a different ideology ? 
  why does catalonia vote left when spain votes right ? 
  really , are you trying to imply that the map i pointed to you on my first message is not an indication of how different catalonia votes from the rest of spain ? 
  _ even if you were the remove all pro-secession parties _ , the colors would _ still _ be different from the rest of spain 's !, 
  not only that . 
  this has also been an _ historical _ trend , _ at least _ as old as the current version of spain itself . 
  just do the math yourself and compute how politically monochromatic spain would be if you removed catalonia . 
  compare madrid : spain : pp psoe podemos cs madrid : pp podemos psoe cs ( and the difference in votes between podemos and psoe is just ~ 2 % , while on the other hand pp 's number of votes almost doubles podemos ' -- uncannily almost the same distribution as the rest of spain . 
  so much for the `` population bias '' theory ) . 
   while this is from 2005 , it has only been known since 2015 sorry , but no dice . 
  not only psc knew it then , as shown when maragall publicly and loudly gave it away in parliament ( and later quickly swept away when corruptg\u00e8ncia threatened to strike back reveling psc 's schemes ) , but erc , which i assume you 're most friendly with , has been _ constantly _ _ suing _ many of corruptg\u00e8ncia 's governed towns because of this type of stuff . 
  the stuff with the public health care system is just outright ridiculous , and it is also widely known that psc continued to allow it durign their brief rule . 
  there 's no way to paint this as anything other but _ at least _ 10 years of continued pillage . 
   money robbed wise , ciu is miles behind everything pp and psoe have done e-penis . 
  you do n't remember ? 
  really ? 
  https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/caso_3%25 i 'm going to assume either you 're really young , or you were n't into politics back then ... 
   without referring to voting , how is catalonia ideologically different from the rest of spain ? 
  `` without talking about politics , how is catalonia politically different from the rest of spain ? '', 
  what part of `` they vote for politically diametrical parties '' does not imply a different ideology to you ? 
   voting results are skewed to villages here in spain which is why madrid and valencia voted ... oh , wait . 
  the correlation exists indeed , but _ despite that _ , catalonia _ still _ votes different . 
  envision what would happen to the parliament if catalonia were to go tomorrow . 
   ciu 's corruption is n't even compaarable to pp 's . 
  not by money stolen , not by politicians detained and prossecuted . 
  cause i 'm not sure about that . 
  lacking concrete data or even a concrete metric , i do n't want to start a `` my e-penis is longer '' war . 
  corruptg\u00e8ncia has been known to be corrupt at least ever since i came here almost a decade ago and only very recently are catalans smartening up to it . 
  that 's the thing i envy most . 
   that 's the thing , you put berlin as an example to say in the next paragraph it is a bad example as it reached the current situation due to extraordinary circumstances . 
  well , i said _ it is an example _ , and that despite the circumstances that lead to it , it proves spain is hardly `` the most decentralized country in the world . '', 
  to help drive the point home , i even added other examples , including mentioning that even well-known centralist france looks , at least in railway infrastructures , more decentralized that spain currently is . 
  and just go to quebec for further examples . .  you also claim spain is heavily centralized in madrid to later acknowledge the fact that spain has multiple powerful economic regions . 
  no , i claimed that the conditions in spain were also ideal for a decentralized country , similar to the circumstances in germany , and that despite those conditions , spain is much more centralist than germany is . 
  i personally blame my beloved ` borbouns ' for that , which are well-known to have tried to apply the same strategies they applied to france . 
   when it comes to railway i can see the economic motivations behind a centralist country , that 's not the problem . 
  ( even though i personally disagree ) .
