  * _ we get access to much more efficient institutions ran at a state level _ . 
  source ? 
  * _ are in a great democratic country _ . 
  suuuuure . 
  source ? 
  and ... so what ? 
  by seceding it may even turn out to be a better one for both of spain and catalonia ! . 
  for starters , catalonia wo n't be a monarchy to begin with , and the spanish parliament would be less fragmented . 
  also , removing the largest nationalist parties out of the spanish parliament would allow a more centralist country , which is what most ( non-catalan ) spaniards want , according to cis polls . 
  spain would be easier to govern . 
  catalonia would be easier to govern , and no king to boot !, 
  * _ if we secede we will be auto-kicked out of eu _ . 
  by who ? 
  and what are they going to kick ? 
  have n't you seen the popular `` y la europea ? '', 
  scene ? 
  * _ uk lost 15 % of it 's pound value _ . 
  so what ? 
  no currency to devalue so far ... ( and many here will argue that 's what we actually need ) . 
  * _ so we will have no say while still being in the eu zone which means adhering to all regulations _ what are you talking about ? 
  if we are forced to the eu zone without say , is that much worse than the current situation ( does spain have much say in the euzone policies ? ) . 
  and seceding gives the opportunity to _ leave _ the eu zone if anyone really wanted to . 
  * _ we export more to the small county of aragon ( 1.3 m people ) to our west than to the whole of france . _ so what ? 
  * _ every relevant country that has ever spoken about catalan secessionism has spoken against it . _ . 
  ... sidenote : you 've just called a few countries `` irrelevant '' . 
  great way to start a discussion ... * _ there is no area in life where a catalan can not self govern _ . 
  this is such bullshit you contradict yourself a few paragraphs down , right when you use the word `` unconstitutional '' . 
  in education , for starters , ( which is my area of expertise ) , it 's impossible to get rid of the various `` religion '' ( mandatory or not ) syllabus that are usually imposed by the state government . 
  see creationist debate in the us for further examples . 
  * _ we are the only region in the world that does n't provide an education system in one of their official majority languages ! _ two things wrong with this . 
  first : try to find _ a single _ all-catalan school in barcelona . 
  i 've been in education for almost a decade by now and i 'm yet to find one . 
  i 'm sure they exist though ; i just think it 'll be easier to win the lottery than to find one of these . 
  nothing in the catalonian law can mandate `` all-catalan '' schools , because that 's , as you say , unconstitutional . 
  second : you do n't need to go very far to find examples in europe . 
  * _ ( spanish native speakers are more numerous than catalan ones and the studies are clear ) _ studies about what ? 
  there are numerous issues about the benefits of bilingualism . 
  there are also , in fact , studies that attempt to find the disadvantages . 
  so what is exactly clear here ? 
  * _ it causes us to have one of the worst education systems in the country but you will never see a secessionist condemn it _ . 
  sorry , what ? 
  and why do you think this is caused by language issues ? 
  even a trivial correlation shows the opposite , with monolingual spanish regions at the bottom , and e.g. , basque country consistently at the top places . 
  looks like it would be much easier to make a correlation to education budget , and at that point you know the answer you 're going to get from secessionists . 
  * _ our region is one of the most corrupt in spain _ by what metric ? 
  souuuurce , please . 
  * _ our media is heavily politicised _ . 
  souurce , please . 
  * _ ask any secessionist what they think about `` ciutadans '' or `` upyd '' , they will say `` nazis '' without pointing at any of their policies _ . 
  * sigh * . 
  ask any psoe voter about pp , or ask any hillary voter about trump ... * _ importantly , if you want to be a good catalan , you need to hate the spanish . _ archetypal bullshit . 
  as a foreigner in catalonia , i can tell you there 's an order of magnitude more hate towards catalonia than _ from _ catalonia . 
  i 'm from a small town near teruel , and , there , i 'm basically considered something akin to a traitor because i went to work to barcelona . 
  the fact that many of my own relatives also went to barcelona to work during franco era seems to be lost on them . 
  and from a short visit i made this summer to zamora , i 'm glad spanish law no longer requires cars to show the region the car was licensed on . 
  if anyone from zamora saw me with a barcelonese car ... 
  i 'm not sure i 'd have a car by now . 
  from my impressions from a ~ 1 week trip , it 's actually worse than teruel . 
  and that 's very , very worrying . 
  sorry , your arguments are rebutted in seconds . 
  in fact , that 's the main argument thrown around by secessionists : that spain wo n't do it because it 'll make spain look like an international asshole . 
  i have my own doubts the government of spain would actually care . 
  they had no problems when international press painted spain as `` that '' eu country that would n't allow scotland to talk about joining the eu post brexit . 
   our own president called catalans against independence `` collonists '' and `` collaborators '' where ? 
  when ? 
   why do you think these people do n't have support ? 
  what i said : _ in comparison _ , support for isis is laughable . 
  go and read some history to understand why . 
  i believe that there 's a much more significant difference with ira/eta that made those much harder to fight than islamic terrorism , and that is support from the local population . 
  eta at least had a non-negligible support , and i assume the same is true for ira . 
  in comparison , support for isis is laughable , even within muslims . 
  i suspect it does n't need to be said how problematic it is , to say the least , to try to combat a terrorist faction that has support of a significant part of the local population . 
  i find it correct though that at least eta tended to be less `` bloody '' per attack ( in a cold , unemotional way ) . 
  in fact , it could be argued that public support for eta took a good dive down after they started with their bloodiest attacks ( e.g. 
  hypercor one ) . 
   if i were running a shop that operates on thin margins and someone told me that my expenses were to increase by 2 % , i may have to close shop . 
  your analogy is broken - you are making the usual right-wing assumption that social expenditure is just `` expenses '' . 
  a more accurate analogy is a cooperative getting an additional million members . 
  why would it complain about that ? 
  and a million _ is _ a handful , continent-wide . 
   socialist systems are not endless pots of money . 
  sigh to the always repeated conservative mantra ... 
  the wealth of a state is defined by _ its members _ . 
  you add more members , you get more wealth . 
  you can not get _ less _ wealth . 
  this is by definition ...  wrong . 
  we are entering a period where jobs are disappearing to automation and not returning . 
  ah yeah , a problem clearly caused by migration , or exacerbated by it ... 
  if you actually believe this will be exacerbated by migration , please elaborate . 
  cause i find all arguments i 've received about it are trivial to falsify . 
   we can not prop up the populations of failed states . 
  why not ? 
  what 's the meaning of `` prop up '' here ? 
   they also may return home providing nothing . 
  that is correct , but it also happens with citizens , and i do n't thought anyone defined that as a problem , right ? 
  besides , i assume you assumed that significant numbers of them would not be returning home , because otherwise we would n't be having this conversation , right ? 
  so why do you even mention this ? 
   they also break the law coming to the countries they often end up in by ignoring the rules about refugee migration . 
  if they break the law , they are treated like every other resident . 
  everyone keeps popping up this non-issue .
