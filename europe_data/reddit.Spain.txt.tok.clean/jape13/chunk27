  and mark my words : like every other resident . 
  not like some sub-human barely deserving of hundred-year-old-signed human rights . 
   i do not believe that people should break the rules of their host if they want help . 
  and exactly who believes that ? 
   the people who are already living somewhere deserve a say in who comes to their country who argues otherwise ? 
  why would anyone even disagree with that ? 
   this is n't some idealistic hippy bullshit world with free borders . 
  the reality , even for liberals , is that mass migration can reduce the overall utility in the world , not increase it ah yeah , one fallacy after another . 
  first , a personal accusation of being a `` idealistic hippie '' and that my arguments are `` bullshit '' . 
  second , the assumption that i want to remove all borders in the world , which i have never mentioned . 
  for example , i think that allowing tariff-free import of products from countries with almost no labor/ecological protection is an error . 
  and , by the way , the statement `` mass migration can never improve the overall utility in the world '' is trivially easy to falsify . 
  the only remaining superpower in today 's world is , literally , a country born out of mass migration . 
  so , fallacy , fallacy , and wrong premise . 
   just because it gives you good feelings to support a supposed `` good cause '' does not make it right or the best for humanity or those nations . 
  why it 's not best for humanity ? 
  you 'll have to elaborate on that . 
  in politics , i always try to strive to what 's best for me first and what 's best for humanity second . 
  and as such my opinion on this topic . 
   so maybe stop getting hysterical and comparing me to a fascist . 
  it 's ridiculous and overplayed . 
   you said addresses my point . 
  yes ; it does . 
  you argued that it is hard to have a `` fully functioning socialist nation if you admit 1 million people who will be relying on it '' . 
  i argue that socialistic nations _ are already comprised exclusively _ of people who `` rely on it '' . 
  adding a handful of additional people hardly makes it much harder . 
   you just stated the obvious and ignored the part where adding a load of people who will not be able to work for years and will need full support during that period is a problem for a socialist nation . 
  why is that a problem ? 
  they 'll just pay back when they 're able to -- even if it 's their children . 
  that 's exactly how socialist countries work . 
  newborns are also `` a load of people who will not be able to work for years and will need full support during that period '' , and until today i never thought anyone could consider those a problem . 
  am i right ? 
   it is still unfair to bias that by bringing in millions of outsiders . 
  i agree , let 's just bias that more by only allowing people with certain political opinions . 
  i am all for preventing reproduction of people with conservative opinions , for a start !, 
   it is hard to have a fully functioning socialist nation if you admit 1 million people who around 100 % of the existing population already `` relies on [ the socialist nation ] '' for potentially years , and around 50 % of the existing population does n't agree with its socialist and liberal system . 
  i do n't understand why the need to feel that `` migrants '' are the source of these problems . 
  it 's a ridiculous issue . 
   the us federal government did not negotiate with ireland yes , yes it does . 
  they 're called tax treaties . 
  ( the other half i mentioned is ttip ) . 
   they absolutely do not want to see ireland extend a sweetheart deal like this to apple , because it helps apple keep their cash overseas while us taxpayer money goes towards protecting apple 's ip well , the point of my message above is that it looks like the us government is a corporatocracy and seemingly wants to allow apple as many tax loopholes as possible . 
  let 's assume that apple was not an `` american company '' ( which is actually closer to the truth than one may think ) , and on a country x with almost-nil tax rates . 
  what could the us government do ? 
  put a huge import tariff on anything imported from country x , tax any money transfer between x and the us , etc. 
  the eu _ can not _ do that to `` protect '' itself from ireland , because the common eu market prevents other eu countries from setting tariffs on imports from ireland . 
  so the eu has to do stuff like this ruling . 
  however , the us is not on the same market as the eu . 
  when i send money or products to the us , i have to pay us import taxes . 
   remember , the us taxes american corporations regardless of where their revenue was earned - this is to fight against tax havens . 
  precisely . 
  so why do you also mention `` sweetheart deals [ between american corporations and eu countries ] to avoid paying taxes owed in the us '' ? 
  something does not compute there . 
  the thing is , the free market in the eu means that eu countries have no way to protect from `` races-to-the-bottom '' from other eu countries . 
  the us , however , has a way to protect itself from races-to-the-bottom of other countries . 
  they 're called tariffs . 
  why the hell the us willingly made a tax deal with ireland while negotiating a 0-tariff treaty with the eu is over me . 
  it all looks to me like a proof of how much of a corporatocracy the us is . 
  similarly , the fact that the eu is doing this now and not a decade ago also is . 
  in any case ...  if the eu was actually serious about this issue , they would make ireland forfeit this policy and then retroactively levy a tax bill on every company that paid below 12.5 % in ireland . 
  i disagree about the `` retroactively '' thing , which is why i disagree with this fine . 
  and in any case , i do believe the fine should have been paid by ireland . 
   give me your tired , your poor ,   your huddled masses yearning to breathe free ,   the wretched refuse of your teeming shore . 
    send these , the homeless , tempest-tost to me ,   i lift my lamp beside the golden door !, 
   no corruption scandals , no politicians laughing at us we must be on a different country ... 
   terrorism can grow and spread like cancer . 
  and . . how ? 
   on top of every major food chain you can think of i think that may actually be part of the problem . 
  for me , london is at the bottom of my ranking of european capitals ( note that this means it 's still a pretty good city overall , just worse than anything else ) . 
  the surprising part is that i actually enjoy london 's weather , and most of my spanish expats disagree 100 % on me there -- they hate the weather and love the city . 
  i am sorry , but biking in many forest/rural parts of spain is [ outright suicidal ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2015/02/27/actualidad/1425049263_801099.html ) , thanks to our very own backwards thinking population that for some reason [ loves to set traps to bikers ] ( http://www.heraldo.es/noticias/aragon/2015/04/21/la_guardia_civil_alerta_peligrosidad_las_trampas_para_ciclistas_zonas_monte_353663_300.html ) . 
  depending on the area , just _ do n't do it _ , since the risk here is real . 
  there are [ at least yearly murders ] ( http://www.eldiariomontanes.es/cantabria/201507/28/guardia-civil-implica-personas-20150728000356-v.html ) caused by these traps , and many ` accidents ' that have caused [ permanent disabilities ] ( http://www.lasexta.com/programas/mas-vale-tarde/noticias/hombre-queda-paraplejico-culpa-trampa-ciclistas_20150302572543576584a81fd883203c.html ) . 
  sounds like they cherry picked them to make a point . 
  which one , i 'm not sure of . 
   vdb 's demographic are highly educated and are usually most likley to turn up , whilst hofer 's demographics consists in large part by people with low/little education from rural areas . 
  experience in brexit , recent spanish elections , etc. 
  shows that the opposite usually happens . 
   there have been more terror attacks in france over the past year than in many middle eastern countries `` there have been an order of magnitude more attacks in many countries over the past year than in france '' way to give weight to a meaningless statement . 
  and no one ( currently ) wants to leave such union . 
   to put this in context , some people insinuates that the catalan government is using the educative system to feed the nationalism and independentism . 
  although i do n't really thing this is a widespread policy , i know specific cases of this happening . 
  not only this is not the case ( i 'm starting to get tired of this ) , but even if i was to accept that there was brainwashing , do you think the answer `` so we have to ensure they 're brainwashed in the right way '' would be the appropriate action to take ? 
  they 're first lying about the status of education in spain , and then they 're using those lies to justify their actions . 
  par for the course . 
   you ca n't compare what is you current economy level from within eu / spain , to what it would be if you were out . 
  cataluna is rich because spain / europe want it to be . 
  so , by your logic , it 's actually best to secede , because then catalonia would want catalonia to be rich ? 
  i do n't understand how this logic works . 
  would n't a country want all of its regions to be , well , developed ? 
  you 're assuming that the differences between regions are principally because `` that 's how they want them to be '' ? 
   last be not least , why do you compare to madrid . 
  it 's the capital . 
  capital . 
  again , you 're just giving more fire to secessionists . 
  cause if they secede , then they 're free to set a different capital . 
  by the way , even france 's centralized railways are more distributed than spain 's , as france 's railroad network has at least two hotspots , in paris and lyon . 
  just for the sake of example , the mediterranean routes have way more traffic than any other route in spain , yet there 's still no high-speed train there ( how 's that valencia line going ? 
  ) , which is what i guess the op was complaining about . 
  spain has the benefit ( or the disgrace ) that the barcelona area is at least as populated and ` as rich ' as the madrid area , but despite that , all the political power is almost completely centered in madrid .
