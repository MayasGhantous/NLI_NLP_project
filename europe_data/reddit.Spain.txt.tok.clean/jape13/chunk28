  there have been demonstrations whenever a more sensible executive has tried to move any government build out of madrid ( e.g. 
  our fcc equivalent ) . 
  compare every other country where this happens , which has some level of decentralization or at least a political capital that is on `` neutral territory '' ( e.g. 
  d.c. ) . 
   barcelona is border by the sea on the south-east , and two natural parc at the north and east . 
  so i do n't know how the fuck you build highway in the middle of this . 
  ... and in fact , barcelona is an actual , populated city !, 
  how are you going yo build a highway in the middle of it ??? 
   that the catalan early medieval age is not even mentioned in the official curricula , nor is the formation of the crown of aragon , nor what the principality of catalonia was and how it came to be . . see the post from me , a few posts above this one :  [ la marca hispanica ] is literally the only thing that 's explained from the entire early medieval period ( another itch of mine , by the way ) but please note that , again , several personalities are mentioned . 
  guifr\u00e9 may be mentioned . 
  the marriage is mentioned . 
  the role itself is not considered important . 
   i understand you correctly , is james i of aragon ( jaime i ) introduced just as `` king of aragon '' ? 
  no , this is mentioned with much more detail . 
  ( king of aragon is how it was introduced to me , by the way ) . 
  this is what i wanted to say : that from the crown onwards , the attention increases . 
   i now wonder how catalan independentists often insist on catalonia having been independent before being included into the kingdom of spain * ( as we often see on this subreddit ) you know , there is no contradiction in this . 
  at some ( short ) periods there was a region covering an area similar to modern catalonia with a level of autonomy similar to the one enjoyed by spain in habsburg era . 
  this is what is usually touted by erc propaganda with perhaps more pompous words . 
  whatever meaning one extracts from this in terms of motivations for secession is something i do n't care about . 
   this whole dialogue has made me extremely curious of what the official history curriculum is in catalonia and if it is followed thoroughly the best way is to just get this year 's santillana/mcgraw books . 
  i was involved with the one for batxillerat and the full one does n't seem to be available online , just [ the core goals ] ( http://xtec.gencat.cat/ca/curriculum/batxillerat/curriculum/ ) . 
  do you realize that everything you mention happens during/after the formation of the aragon crown , right ? 
  so after that point we 're talking about kings of aragon , like jaime i ? 
  there 's not much point in even mentioning the counts of barcelona before that , since the expansion of the c of b happens pretty much in that period , too . 
  except for a few personalities . 
  for the sake of god i _ can not _ believe we 're having this conversation here . 
  what 's next , the `` mediterranean branch of the aryan race '' ? 
  ( something straight from the mussolini book ), 
  no , it 's not a typo . 
  the count of barcelona ( the position , not the county ) is not mentioned at all in the official curricula . 
  why would it ? 
  the county of barcelona is not even the most important one of the retroactively-called catalonian counties to begin with !, 
  maybe they told you about certain specific personalities ( e.g. 
  guifr\u00e9 ) , but most probably regarding the legend and not about his documented roles . 
   so get rid of them already . 
  but we got rid of them . 
  they 've descended from 40 % to 15 % in latest polls . 
  it made me smile , a lot . 
  i seem to remember discussing this with you , even . 
   and why did you let them jump in , in the first place ? 
  how can that be prevented ? 
   their obvious aim was to curtail erc 's grow and stay relevant in the face of their pilling corruption scandals . 
   instead it 's been mas and mas-appointed puigdemont i fully agree . 
  however , it all looks as it 's going to be a failure to them . 
  the party is almost self-destructing ( another group has seceded from them this past week ) and the polls are still going down . 
   now we are approaching an average of one catalan election per year . 
  i do n't see why 's that related , but ... 
  i do n't see that as a bad thing , actually . 
  it implies it is not the `` party that is ruling catalonia '' . 
  it is one of the parties that is doing so . 
  the one that i ( for example ) have been chastising for a shitton of time because of their corruption and well-known affiliation to pp . 
  to now try to taint the secessionist movement in any way because they 're returning to their old ways now that they 've failed to extract more votes from secessionism is something that i am behemently against for . 
  corruptverg\u00e8ncia _ jumped _ on the secessionist bandwagon , they did not create it . 
  i wanted the answer to come from your mouth : because most uk voters wanted ukip to defend their interests in the ep . 
  as per what those interests could be , see http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00344890802237023 . 
  summing it up , to ensure that no new legislation is passed in that curtails uk `` freedom '' , prevent fraud and mismanagement , and promote their views . 
  you might disagree with them ( i do , for a start ) , but a shitton of voters think they 're useful there ( and not only in the uk , see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/movement_for_a_europe_of_nations_and_freedom ) . 
  i 'm sorry but it is hardly completely irrelevant . 
  at worst it is exactly as relevant as what they won in exchange . 
  and in addition it also signals the first accord between pp and cdc as in the old times , and it also gives the impression that it is `` the first of many to come '' , which is not exactly what i 'd like to hear if cdc wants to give any image of political renewal . 
   like catalonian kingdom , instead of aragon the official term in the curriculum is `` corona d'arag\u00f3 '' https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/corona_d%27arag%c3%b3 . 
  at most , sometimes i 've seen `` aragon-catalonian crown '' ( `` corona catalanoaragonesa '' ) . 
  find me a _ single _ textbook that does n't call it by one of these two names . 
  i am from teruel and currently working in education in catalonia , so i tend to pay attention to this stuff . 
   like the count of barcelona being the king of catalonia . 
  what ? 
  the official curricula does n't even include the `` count of barcelona '' . 
  they 're not learn , not even listed !, 
   the ignoring when catalonia was french . 
  the what ???? 
  it 's literally the _ only _ thing that 's explained from the entire early medieval period ( another itch of mine , by the way ) https://www.google.es/search?q=marca+hisp\u00e0nica+batxillerat  like l'adeus i au , that now says that being better kids will make them more catalonian . 
  i did n't understand that . 
   basically , all evil comes from spain , and all good from catalonia . 
   they are not inventing anything . 
  it is pure fascism . 
  i am a history teacher currently in a public school in barcelona , and i 'm going to take personal offense to every poorly-sourced accusation like that one . 
   a very simple and obvious example is this map , it shows the highways on barcelona and madrid over the last 20 years . 
  even funnier is that while most of the madrid ones are free , most of the ones in barcelona are full of tolls !, 
  terrible example . 
  it 's quite clear who 's to blame for that ( hint : cdc and its revolving door with abertis ) . 
  i still do n't understand why anyone puts any weight in the `` but catalonia would be out of the eu '' argument . 
  first , it might not be actually that bad . 
  * second , turns out most of the eu is not actually all that happy to eject regions from it , not even when 50 % of the affected population want out . 
  third , staying with spain might actually be the quickest way to get ejected out of the eu , surmissing what happened in scotland ( in less than 1 year , from `` better together '' to `` brexit '' ) . 
  \\* i 'm not sure why would anyone want to be in a union whose goals are set by revenge politics . 
  terrible argument . 
  why does ukip have the most uk meps ? 
  the question is more like why do they continue giving voice & votes to pp , as in the old times ? 
  have they already given up on the charade and they 're back on the old times ? 
  if so , what 's stalling them from resigning and asking for new elections ? 
  erc is now larger than puigdemont 's party-that-must-not-be-named ( for reasons like that one ) . 
   the current autonomy statute is basically as much as they are going to get note that it is _ not _ because of the constitution . 
  several of the clauses from the proposed catalonian statute that were protested are present , in almost identical form , in the statutes of other autonomies . 
  http://www.elsiglodeuropa.es/siglo/historico/2010/889/889dossier.html pp ( and psoe ) mentioned several times that they `` were proud of what they 'd done to the catalonian statute '' ( `` conseguido el objetivo '' ) . 
  i had recently migrated to catalonia when that happened and have to say that it is probably what influenced my opinion most in this entire issue . 
  note : second/minority party in the coalition currently ruling in catalonia has voted ( again ) for pp . 
  has not much to do with the topic at hand . 
   the manipulation at schools and institutes is really scary like for example ? 
   for example it is illegal using spanish in your business , you have to use catalan .
