  it is illegal if you do n't use catalan in your business , but it is also illegal if you do n't use spanish in your business . 
  we 've been over this in almost every other thread ... 
  there 's no singular threshold . 
  what would be the death threshold when it would be `` rational '' to fear of flying ? 
  this sounds like `` i hope you 're making cookies for us , because we 're angry idiots and , as history has shown , we will come after you even if you have nothing to do with what is currently ailing both of us '' . 
  that 's literally the definition of irrationally . 
  irrational fear of flying --  irrational fear of terrorism . 
  i am sure you will be happy to know that when someone you know dies in a traffic/kitchen/bathroom accident ( which is not a `` if '' , because it _ will _ happen to you , and unless you 're a basement nerd probably more than once ) no one will even mention it , that when someone you know dies in a passion crime no one will mention it , but when someone dies in the streets , depending on the name of the perpetrator , it will be all over the news . 
  and that truth is justified because of which data ? 
   the state has failed if even one terrorist attack happened i see you have / r/europe 's definition of a `` failed state '' . 
  which is very ironic , since the only to way to prevent all `` terrorism '' in a country is by making it a police state -- so that they can censorship all reports of `` attacks '' -- and that is much more closer to _ my _ definition of a `` failed state '' . 
   why go to crazy turkey or france when you can go to safe spain ? 
  because if you come to `` safe '' spain you will be _ pickpocketed _ in the middle of the street . 
  `` crazy '' france is much better in that regard . 
  even if you were in turkey during the _ fucking _ coup d'etat , you 'd have noticed nothing except a delay if you were to board a plane . 
  a bit of common sense , please . 
   i 've seen people on / r/france asking after the terrorist attacks if it 's still safe . 
  reddit is not representative of the world . 
  this all proves how terribly stupid and puerile everything is . 
  `` if you leave the uk , you 'll also be forced out of the eu , and you will have to negotiate your reentry conditions !, 
  spain will veto ! '', 
  in fact , the right-wing usually is quite happy with accepting tons of immigrants to a country . 
  they 'll advertise they 're not doing it in a `` uncontrolled '' way , because they 'll `` restrict '' it to the demand of big companies , like so called `` slavery '' h1b visas . 
  and the demand for slave labor is infinite , so the net result is the same . 
  migration policy is not really a left/right thing . 
   spain 's political deadlock spain has been moving , if anything , _ to the left _ , with the establishment trying to prevent it in any way possible , thus resulting in the standoff . 
  in the meanwhile , the rest of europe had/has the stereotype of spanish people being extremely proud of their country . 
  see the prevalence of `` as proud as a spaniard '' in many germanic languages ( english and deutsch come to mind ) . 
   spain gives us pride , which spain to all the earth  may largely give , nor fear herself a dearth from [ charles churchill ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_churchill_ ( satirist \\ ) ) 's _ the times _ ( 1764 ) . 
  my pseudo-educated opinion is that all of these ` stereotypes ' were war propaganda . 
   immediate reaction completely bollocks . 
  please note he argued :  why we have a goverment full of thieves when everybody is one this is not a `` software bug '' . 
  this is not politician 's fault . 
  this is about 30k spaniards being happy with receiving pension money for dead people . 
  and in addition :  ^ the average spaniard in a nutshell . 
  but that is also false . 
  your stereotype is also false . 
  spain has one of the highest tax morales of any european country ( that is , we believe that `` we '' and other spaniards tend to pay their taxes ) , but it also has one of the largest shadow economies of all of europe ( that is , we actually do a lot of tax fraud ) , comparable to south african countries rather than other european countries . 
  the only one with a similar problem is italy . 
  portugal , at least , has the low tax morale that is expected with the size of their shadow economy ( they 're honest about it , like the greeks  ) . 
  to sum it up : spain has a _ huge _ problem with tax fraud and corruption ( almost double the size than our northern neighbors ) , and most spaniards fail to actually realize the magnitude of the problem . 
  ^ the _ actual _ average spaniard in a nutshell . 
  sources : many . 
  see figure on p. 22 http://leitner.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/resources/docs/tax_morale_leitner.pdf , http://www.gestaodefraude.eu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wp039.pdf , http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/e-library/documents/policies/organized-crime-and-human-trafficking/corruption/docs/acr_2014_en.pdf etc. 
  could you tell me _ which _ one of minister luis de guindos multiple `` ever-optimistic predictions '' has ever come true ? 
   acting economy minister luis de guindos said nothing to see here , move along . 
   every decent sized country ( i mean 2-4 million people and upwards ) has a racing scene . 
  every decent sized country has a knitting scene larger than the `` racing scene '' . 
  proofs , please . 
   all of those are dangerous and considering the damage that alcoholism does to families , alcohol should probably be the first thing banned on this planet . 
  but we 're not going to ban alcohol _ because some retards ca n't control themselves _ i actually agree with the last part if you add a full stop there . 
   are we going to limit access to food to control obesity , we already are . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:new_york_city_soft_drink_size_limit_protest_sign.jpg  and in regards to firearms , they are a tool as any other , all tools have a capacity for misuse . 
  yes , flesh-eating bacteria also are tool like any other , all tools have a capacity for misuse . 
  the fact that a gun might be used as toothpick too changes absolutely nothing in the argument . 
  the discussion should be what is best for society overall . 
  : rollseyes : another textbook definition of a straw man . 
  and to think that there 's people that 's against introducing philosophy and logic in third grade . 
  another bad example , to be honest . 
  in any case , the dangers of owning more than 10 pairs of shoes are much less clear . 
  why it does n't surprise me that the average level of the replies in this type of topics is that of 10yr old childs ? 
  they love guns , big cars , speed racing ... and think everyone else does , too . 
  well , i can have one death rather than two . 
  self-defense means _ preventing _ the attack , not ensuring everyone turns up death . 
   guns are an equalizer , guns make it so the 70 year old granny can protect herself from any number of gang bangers as effectively as bruce lee with nunchuks . 
  ha , hahahahahaha ...  would you want an old lady to have to defend herself with her fists ? 
  no , i would want to avoid all types of _ death and injury _ in the first place . 
  search for `` mandatory isa '' . 
  in the latest european-wide poll , almost 1/3 of _ drivers _ ( i.e. 
  not the general population , but _ drivers _ ! ), 
  were in favor of mandatory isa . 
  i watched this live on the ep live stream , but i do n't remember the date . 
  i could only find this as source : http://etsc.eu/two-thirds-of-uk-drivers-happy-with-intelligent-speed-assistance-tech/, 
  you may be in the only country where that is true . 
  `` tons of lawful people '' ? 
  much like guns , the reason the public opinion actually is open to the idea of banning absurd-speed cars is because the majority of voting-age people does n't see `` car races '' as something worth sacrificing _ a ton _ human lifes for . 
  yes , in fact , let 's ban all types of arguments except for straw mans . 
  ironical , considering i think that secessionism sometimes results in _ more _ united countries , not less . 
  example : spain parliament currently ` locked ' because almost all parties with representation ( except the main three parties ) are in favor of a independence referenderum that the main parties outright refuse . 
  divide the country , and that 's one problem less ... and we can center on defending against foreign invaders rather than infighting each other . 
  so youre basically confirming it 's a really poor example . 
  the only benefit is that very few people get to enjoy some absurd type of entertainment , and in the meanwhile the number of high-speed crashes is spectacularly high . 
  ( higher than gun related accidents , mass shootouts or everything caused by islamism in the oast few years ... ) if this was a logical , objective society it 's rather clear what we would ban first . 
  poor example , to be honest . 
  it 's never been clear to me why do we have cars than can do over 90mph . 
   some people say reddit is really left leaning reddit , as most of the www , is ( american definition ) liberalist . 
   the trouble comes because everyone wants what the neighbour has just because they do n't want to feel lesser than the others , it 's a well-known fact indeed http://www.elconfidencial.com/elecciones-generales/2015-11-05/los-espanoles-quieren-mas-autonomia-para-las-ccaa-tras-las-elecciones-catalanas_1085010/ ( but note how low the autonomy + + numbers are still very low ) . 
  they actually try to explore that bias in the cis poll . 
  they ask both `` would you want more/less autonomy for your region '' and then in a separate question ask about which model they 'd prefer for all regions . 
   the trouble comes because everyone wants what the neighbour thus the proposed solution , in which you either `` have the balls '' to become a full-fledged independent state , or prefer to remain with the rest of the regions . 
  the regions that decide to `` remain '' collectively form the new spanish nation . 
  extrapolating from the polls and assuming the usual ones secede , the amount of support for `` autonomies '' in `` new spain '' would probably drop to ridiculous numbers , so quite probably the new country would be able to drop autonomies and create a fully centralized state , saving a shitton of money in the process . 
  everyone wins . 
  eventually , the `` iberian '' federation is formed , to unify e.g. 
  foreign affairs , army . 
  portugal is invited to join in . 
  i stop playing history-based board games , etc. 
   maybe someone can convince people from extremadura that they need less autonomy than catalonia i 'd use the money argument . 
  most people seem to believe that decentralization wastes more money . 
   i do n't find that paragraph in the link you posted , [ page 15 ] ( http://xtec.gencat.cat/web/.content/alfresco/d/d/workspace/spacesstore/0028/f2989dc7-8a2c-4b2f-86e8-4d5929f43fd7/publ-curriculum_batxillerat.pdf ) i am not a lawyer , but as i said , i 've been lecturing in spanish in catalonia for the most part of a decade , and i 've never had a problem with it .
