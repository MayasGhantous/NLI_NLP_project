  i also know quite some people who also lecture in spanish . 
  all of them are in barcelona , though . 
  i have no doubts there will be some all-catalan schools outside barcelona . 
  no , please read it more carefully ; the `` normally '' part is important . 
  in fact , in the official [ curricula ] ( http://xtec.gencat.cat/ca/curriculum/batxillerat/curriculum/ ) ( i actually wrote part of the 2008 one ) , it says the following :  el catal\u00e0 [ ... ] ha de ser emprat normalment com a llengua vehicular d\u2019ensenyament [ ... ] : activitats orals i escrites de l\u2019alumnat i del professorat , exposicions del professorat , llibres de text i material did\u00e0ctic , activitats d\u2019aprenentatge i d\u2019avaluaci\u00f3 , i comunicacions amb les fam\u00edlies . 
  more proofs : - [ sat tests ] ( http://universitatsirecerca.gencat.cat/es/03_ambits_dactuacio/acces_i_admissio_a_la_universitat/proves_dacces_a_la_universitat_pau/models_d_examens_anteriors_2014_2013_i_2012/ ) were in catalan and spanish . 
  - undergraduate research projects can be delivered in catalan , spanish , or the enrolled 3rd language ( see curricula ) . 
  - good luck trying to find a single catholic school ( they receive public money ! ), 
  lecturing _ a single course _ in catalan . 
  the official text books are in catalan , though . 
  that 's been true for a while ; i remember that the physics one was in castillian at some point , but i ca n't find which year ( actually a severely cut-down translation of tipler & mosca that had been originally written for a freshman university applied physics course in uab , translated by a friend of mine ) . 
   education in catalonia is 90 % in catalan i work in education , and that is a lie . 
  you 're free to attend my history lectures -- they 're in spanish , because i am still not entirely comfortable discussing certain topics in catalan . 
  there 's no rule determining in which language classes are imparted . 
  every lecturer does it his way . 
  sat tests are universally bilingual . 
  that 's the statu quo . 
  that said , i _ was _ forced to learn catalan when i came to barcelona , though . 
  as a precondition of being a public employee working in anything remotely related to education . 
  but i hardly find that problematic since if i did n't know it , i would be forced to learn spanish , too . 
  ( and no ; neither catalonia nor any other spanish region can legally employ teachers that do n't speak spanish at all . ) . 
  the recent rulings by the spanish judiciary have mandated that , in case a public school can not arrange for all lecturers to agree to lecture all courses in spanish , then the catalan government has to pay for lecturers that will agree to teach in spanish . 
  even it 's just for one student in an entire 500k town . 
  the same rule does not exist in the opposite direction . 
  not only that , but it _ can not _ exist , since it would be immediately repelled by the supreme court . 
  actually , the opposite for me , at least . 
  it has reminded how democracy works better ( = represents people better ) in smaller countries . 
  as in the scottish anti-secession campaign , one of the main tactics that have been used in spain is to warn secessionists that an independent catalonia would need to re-join the eu , that spain would veto any attempt to do so , and that leaving the eu is `` bad '' for `` reasons '' . 
  the irony that scottish people _ now are forced to leave _ the eu despite remaining with the union and despite voting remain is not lost on anyone . 
  i smirked a lot everytime i saw people from westminster criticizing the eu as part of the brexit campaign when only months ago they were glorifying it when addressing the scottish people . 
  thus , thanks to brexit , the `` but you 'll leave the eu ! '', 
  argument has lost a lot of weight , and is by now probably backfiring . 
  border controls for who ? 
  i see 3 scenarios : 1 : if there 's no acknowledgment of secession from spain , then spain has no reason to remove citizenship from spanish citizens . 
  2 : if there 's an agreed secession from spain , and spain refuses to allow catalonia to join the eu : ( a ) spain gets to play dickhead on the eu parliament ( b ) catalonia is free to decide whether to keep using the euro and whether or not install border control . 
  the eu is free to decide whether or not to accept catalonian passports . 
  3 : agreed secession from spain , catalonia joins the eu . 
   this is why i think a federal spain wo n't be the solution , and why i think catalonia would do better being independent . 
  in fact , objective data supports this argument . 
  ( i remember mentioned this in some other thread , too ) . 
  looking at cis polls , there are regions where there is clear support for _ more _ autonomy and regions with clear support for _ less _ autonomy . 
  yes , this is true . 
  compare e.g. 
  extremadura http://www.cis.es/cis/export/sites/default/-archivos/marginales/2940_2959/2956/extremadura_11/e2956110.html ( only 30 % want more autonomy ; the rest want equal autonomy or less , with a whopping 33 % in favor of removing all autonomy ) with catalonia ( 70 % want more autonomy ; only 8 % want less ; the rest are fine the current level ) . 
  in fact , from the same report , around 1/3 of spain would actually be in favor of removing `` autonomies '' altogether . 
  1/3 would want autonomy + + , and only 1/3 is happy with the statu quo . 
  there can still be a federal solution to this : just give everyone his wishes . 
  spin off the regions that want more or equal autonomy into new states of the spanish federation , merge those regions that want less autonomy into a single state in the new federation . 
  one can dream ... 
  thereby preventing any type of future collaboration between catalonia and spain in the future , and ruining any chances of iberian-federation-style unions . 
  great plan . 
  both the current ruling parties in spain and catalonia have been quite happy fanning the flames of secessionism in order to win votes . 
  in catalonia , at least , the strategy seems to have stopped working , as the current ruling coalition is almost on the brink of extinction . 
  unfortunately it seems that it 's stilling winning pp quite a lot of votes in the rest of spain . 
  in addition , there are some significant differences in the political ` leaning ' between catalonia and most of the rest of spain , perhaps best exemplified by [ the results of the recent election ] ( http://e04-expansion.uecdn.es/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2016/06/26/14669750219627.jpg ) . 
  in fact , it could be argued that ` the catalan issue ' is what has blocked locking the formation of a successful ruling coalition in spain 's parliament , as none of the three parties wants to deal with `` secessionist '' parties , which happen to be ... the rest . 
  ironically , no one wants to construct a wall here . 
  revenge-based politics again . 
  these have been so successful in the past ... 
   and if the answer is yes , can a single person proclaim independence from the state ? 
  this reductio-ad-absurdum style argument usually gets thrown around a lot , but it 's trivial to debunk . 
  democracy has long since solved this . 
  i mean , after all , 1 person alone can not start a democratic party . 
  there are arbitrary hardcoded minimum headcounts everywhere . 
   the government asking them to have bi-lingual schools instead of only 100 % catalan ones would be seen as repression technically , the government is asking for 100 % spanish schools rather than bilingual ones ... bilingual schools is the current status quo ( though it is certainly easy to see people around that think that the current status quo is repression , but those are quite a minority ) . 
   autonomous regions were allowed to call themselves nations on their statutes : more of them became secessionists while i do n't necessarily disagree with the sentiment , it 's ironical to mention this considering the fuel for this recent wave of secessionism is , among other things , that catalonia [ was not allowed to call itself `` nation '' on their statute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statute_of_autonomy_of_catalonia ) , while other regions were allowed . 
  in this case though , it 's not really a fallacy , since we 're trying to define what makes turkey ` undemocratic ' today while other countries are ` democratic ' . 
  got ta ask : why not ? 
  where you draw the line between `` democratic '' and `` undemocratic '' ? 
   but it only consistently turns into an oppressive regime i am yet to see a anything that does not eventually turn into an oppresive regime . 
   they had 20 million objects indexed , the next closest competitor was 2 million ( lycos and yahoo ) . 
  when did that happen ? 
   i do remember google categories well , it was called `` directory '' . 
   i did n't say they would , i meant they would borrow innovations clearly defined by bigtable . 
  what are you recommending , that a search engine uses off the shelf databases to pass google in capacity ? 
  `` innovations clearly defined by bigtable '' ? 
  bigtable is literally an off-the-shelf database , so why would they use it ? 
   yeah and a billionaire can send their kids to the best universities and give them a cushy job or a fat loan . 
  so what ? 
  that is life . 
  no , that is monopoly abuse . 
   how unfair it is that this american company can control everything again trying to make it a us vs eu issue ...  apparently it is pretty good at winning , so good in fact , you think it is unfair ah yes , `` they succeeded , therefore they must be good '' . 
  so microsoft is known for their high-quality software now ? 
  feel free to search `` worse is better '' . 
  in google , if you feel like it . 
  see ? 
  my point just proved itself . 
  by the time you wrote the post the actual fines were not public yet , yet you managed to complain !, 
  and it turns out that microsoft payed significantly _ less _ than these companies ( proportionally in company revenue ) . 
  but the worst part is :  smaller than microsoft did over ... browser choice . 
  do n't do that . 
  first and foremost , the so-called `` record fine '' to ms ( the only that is higher in absolute value than the individual fines to these companies ) was because ... ms _ disobeyed _ a direct court order ( twice ) . 
  you might agree or disagree with the judgment , but disobeying a court order is much worse than any of the above issues . 
  if it was a smaller company , someone would be in jail by now . 
  and they 're all european companies . 
  just mentioning this because _ every _ . 
  _ single _ . 
  _ time _ . 
  there 's something in the news about the eu protentially fining google , apple , ms or any other us company for anything there 's always someone who jumps in and cries `` protectionism ! '' . 
  look at the damn historic of cartel fines by the ec and the doj , and then we can talk about exactly which country is doing `` protectionism '' .
