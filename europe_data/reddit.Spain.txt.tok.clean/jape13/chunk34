  outside of europe and na ( for which there is some difference -- 7 % spain vs 11 % uk ) , spain prefers trading with south america , while uk prefes asia , but that 's about where differences go . 
  with france , the preference goes to africa . 
  of course , this is just a gross overapproximation , but `` connections '' do not look to be much stronger nor different . 
  without entering a / r/badhistory debate , what exactly would this have to do ? 
  why would this be a difference ? 
  spain is just one example of many ... 
  fully agreed , and sorry . 
   however i will also point out that american is more diverse than europe . 
  which means opinions are more polarized . 
  huh ????? 
  `` the vast majority '' of any european nation 's sphere is not in europe , either . 
  most european nations have played the `` overseas empire '' game , for better or worse ( imho the latter ) . 
  _ spain is a maritime nation with deep ties in every continent . 
  the vast majority of the spanish-speaking sphere is n't in europe . 
  it is n't just a peninsula . 
  it 's a peninsula thats cousins are all across the seas . _ yet pro-european unification feelings are at an all-time high in spain . 
  same with france , germany , portugal , ... 
  `` mass demographic change '' ? 
  sigh . 
  i am quite sure he would be much more worried about the values that flamed the world wars rising again in europe in less than 50 years ( hate , nationalism , separation , ... ) than by the non existent `` demographic change '' . 
  i really hate it when those people attempt to make fun at the differences between northern and southern europe . 
  actually , there 's no such difference !, 
  i mean , northerners may be efficient at some things , but we southerners are also efficient at some other things !, 
  for example , if there 's one thing that we southerners are extremely efficient at , that 's evading taxes . 
  be proud of it !, 
  those lame northern companies could learn a thing or two from us southerners , we 're decades ahead !, 
  so we have poll that says 36 % and another that says 64 % ? 
  which one do we trust , the guardian ? 
   i wish you will get to tell your children how the partisans came to your village , gunned down your neighbors , burned down the house and plundered your shop so karl marx and friedrich engels gunned down your neighbors ? 
  must be a strange parallel universe you live in ... 
  wait a second . 
  are you trying to imply `` clothing '' is `` objectively '' a free personal choice ? 
  can you explain why we clothe at all ? 
  can you explain why we clothe at all the way we do ? 
  can you explain what 's wrong with the roman toga ? 
  can you explain what 's wrong with victorian-era dressing ? 
  can you explain what 's wrong with a burka ? 
  can you explain what 's wrong if i decide to wear only a semi-transparent cloak ? 
  there 's absolute nothing objective here , and clothing is a free choice _ only _ if your choices happen to match the `` correct '' ones . 
   building contractors ? 
  given the high unemployment , i wonder how they manage to stay . 
  to put it simple , by doing the jobs that spaniards do n't want to do . 
  ironically , spaniards also go to london to go and do the jobs the british wo n't do . 
  because the idiots that will use this as fuel are here to impart social justice !, 
  even for those that do not want it !, 
  the term social justice warrior ironically applies very well here . 
  so _ exactly what difference does the race or nationality of the assailant _ make in a rape assault ? 
  it 's a terrible thing , that as such deserves a fair trial . 
  i mean , she may have also omitted about reporting his brand of glasses !, 
  so which conclusions can you draw from the usual ~ 7000 yearly rapes in germany alone , even during the late 90s ? 
   it 's it just kind of a think you do if you get big ? 
  so maybe , and i 'm just saying , the thing is that having too large companies is not necessarily a good thing for the people . 
  `` here '' is not representative at all of the general population . 
  i 'm sure there 's a shitton of astroturfing around , since , in fact , brexit support seems to have almost completely disappeared after the election was over . 
   google , facebook or microsoft . 
  i do n't understand why people would use these as examples , since all of these have been fined several times for tax avoidance , monopolization of the market and similar reasons . 
  actually , the current government in the uk has most definitely _ not _ committed itself to it , and brexit is far from guaranteed . 
  otoh the current government in catalonia has indeed _ committed _ itself to secession . 
  but it 's also far from guaranteed . 
  the situations are more similar to what one would think . 
  how businesses are treating this is also under discussion , not a precondition . 
  ... and neither has the uk ( that is part of the point ) . 
   a slow brexit of elements of uk business has begun . 
  but this sounds , to be honest , like the usual scaremongering technique . 
  are there any statistics to prove this other than `` my friends say '' ? 
  when they warned catalans of `` businesses moving from catalonia '' and it turned out that year more businesses moved _ in _ than out in raw numbers . 
  this is not just `` hermits '' . 
  its the same for my birthtown , also in aragon . 
  in this case , around 200 people , so way more than one phone , but they all need to go to the top of the mountain -- where the cemetery is -- to get signal . 
  did n't we discuss _ exactly the same crappy map _ less than a few hours ago in https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4r14a8/number_of_citizens_living_outside_their_home/ ? 
  the most upvoted comments even have the same criticism . 
   just rechecked the data and realized that france does not offer this kind of data by country of citizenship . 
  that may be underestimating the number of spanish emigrants - as it 's logical to think that there would be a sizable spanish community in france - . 
  to be honest , i 'm still unsure what is the value of centering only on es -  eu migration , since most of spanish emigration is going outside the eu . 
  the official number of spaniards abroad is 2.3 m , by the ine ( e.g. 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_diaspora ) . 
  if anything , the real number is _ higher _ than that , by the reasons given in the other link . 
  however , it 's just peanuts when compared to actual past diasporas , such as the polish ( no need to compare to that ... ) . 
  what i mentioned is that it 's been accelerating so quick this past 5 years that _ as of today _ it 's the largest source of yearly emigrants in the entire eu . 
  the number has _ doubled _ in a few years . 
  the diaspora is _ happening now _ . 
   that 's why i prefer to use immigration rather than emigration data . 
  i acknowledge that , and i in fact i read that same quote somewhere . 
  however , a ) the bias is present in all eu countries , which have similar census policies ; b ) if anything , it means the data _ underestimates _ the actual number of emigrants . 
  http://mareagranate.org/2015/06/el-gobierno-minimiza-deliberadamente-los-datos-de-la-emigracion-espanola/ so it 's still pretty much valid to do a comparison this way . 
  and if you assume that data from the map is wrong , where are you getting the data from other eu countries from ? 
  check eurostat for some real statistics . 
  spain has been the number one source of emigrants in the entire eu for the past two years . 
  in 2013 it even doubled the number of _ yearly _ emigrants from germany . 
  a potential reason for the discrepancy between map and eurostat is because map may only count emigration to other european countries , but that would not fully explain the error either , since spanish emigration to eu is ~ 40 % of total emigration . 
   according this data , spain is the country with less population living abroad per capita , literally . 
  because the data in the map is completely bollocks . 
  there are almost 2 million spaniards living abroad this year , and number keeps increasing by 5 % year by year . 
  http://www.elmundo.es/sociedad/2016/03/17/56ea7da022601d7f648b463f.html we 're the country that is currently _ leading _ the number of emigrants pear year in the entire european union . 
  see eurostat table migr_emi1ctz . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-datasets/-/migr_emi1ctz so yeah , i 'm rolling _ my _ eyes ( again ) . 
  it places an undue amount of privilege to foreign investors that normal citizens of the country do n't have . 
  it 's already bad when politicians have their own courts , as in spain . 
  however , this is just nothing when compared to the idea that morris tobacco * company will be able to sue australia because of public anti-smoking regulation ( oh wait , this has already happened ... ) . 
  \\* anonymized in case they decide to sue reddit too .
