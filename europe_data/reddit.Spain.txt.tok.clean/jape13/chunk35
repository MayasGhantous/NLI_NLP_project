  however , isds is hardly a reason to hate ttip since we already have them ... 
   the stance is that an independent scotland will be welcome if the independence has the blessing of westminster and they will have to negotiate as an independent country . 
  again with this ? 
  he has absolutely never said that . 
  mostly because he does not even contemplate the possibility that scotland secedes without uk approval . 
  he has gone out of his way to remind people that he will not negotiate with scotland even when both the eu parliament and the eu commission ( junker ) were favorable to the idea . 
  therefore making him eat all the bad pr . 
  his intention is quite clear . 
  the question is whether he will be the one representing spain in the eu when the time comes . 
  well , for one it certainly does not mean he would welcome them . 
  also remember . 
  he 's already vetoed the current negotiations even when juncker himself was quite happy allowing the negotations before secession . 
  the only question is whether he 'll be representing spain in the eu when the negotiations start . 
  i do n't know anything about engineering , but ~ 0.9 k/month is actually very common for junior phds . 
  yes , that 's less than the usual stipend for nation-wide scholarships . 
  i 've heard some math phds making 1.5 k/month in hft , but that was kind of a huge surprise . 
  they 'd be earning more than two times the median , almost 3 . 
  `` pretty normal '' my ass . 
  in fact , this piece of `` news '' is probable a lie designed to keep salaries shitty . 
  nothing to see here , move on . 
  if you 're at around phd level or higher , your only options in spain are to emigrate the country by `` land , sea or air '' , as they usually say in here . 
  there 's the `` work for the government '' option ( what i am currently doing ) , which usually entices low , albeit acceptable pay and privileges , but it is extremely hard to come by . 
  anything other usually means joining the unemployed or earning ~ 1.5 k/month or less . 
  and rent is around 1k/month ... 
   the position in 2014 was that scotland would be welcome to join the eu as an independent country so long as the split was agreed with westminster . 
  no , not all . 
  he has constantly mentioned that he would do everything in his power to prevent an independent scotland , negotiated or not , from joining the eu . 
  http://www.libertaddigital.com/espana/politica/2014-09-17/rajoy-admite-que-no-dara-facilidades-a-escocia-para-ingresar-en-la-ue-1276528458/ he even _ never _ considered the case of a `` non-agreed '' split since : a ) it was never on the table to begin with , b ) he would probably offer uk to send ground troops to scotland if it ever were to happen . 
  the fact that he decided to be the first one to veto scotland after brexit ( even junker was optimistic about it ! ), 
  and thus eat all the negative pr should also hint regarding what he plans to do . 
  despite the fact that i 'm heavily left-leaning and i tend to agree with everything the guardian says , this article is garbage . 
   do we think a similarly reckless decision would have been taken ? 
  i mean , really ? 
  reckless decision ? 
  considering how difficult it usually is to change the status quo , if more than 50 % of people not only do not believe it to be a reckless decision , and in addition , consider it the better option , i 'd have a really hard time calling it a `` reckless decision '' . 
  even if i believe that everyone around me is a shit-eating idiot , as demonstrated by the past spanish elections were people have voted for a party mostly comprised of literal thieves , _ i will still advocate for direct democracy _ . 
  that is true ; however we 've been always wondering what would _ he _ do if scotland secession happen , and since he 's now shown that the does n't care about the bad pr that comes associated with being the one that blocks scotland ... it 's quite clear what his position is going to be when scotland secedes . 
  as if  dude , you should be a marriage advisor for couples with children was not . 
  and you seem to reason with the mind of a teenager . 
  which is fine , but i hope you mature before your first serious relationship , or you _ will _ have problems ( and sadly , _ cause _ problems ) . 
   because she/he is no longer your friend and this was a dinner between you and your friends . 
  and she considers them their friends now too , because she still wants to go to those dinners . 
   most of break-ups do n't end up well , and very few they manage to stay friends . 
  and if you prevent her from seeing your friends because of that , well , that is called revenge . 
  not only that . 
  it is called harassment . 
  this is the reason i insist you get help . 
   she/he only went because of you . 
  false , because she _ still wants to go _ . 
  it 's metaphorical walls , like restrictions to trade or travel , not real walls . 
  catalonia does n't want to impose any , and spain also says that they would prefer not to install any . 
  however , as rajoy has shown , they will _ happily _ wall off scotland . 
  imagine what they 'd do if catalonia secedes . 
   the dinners here a thing of you and your friends . 
  she/he would only go because is your special other . 
  he/she is not part of the group , so why should he be invited ? 
  because she _ feels like part of the group _ . 
  so much that she wants to join your dinners . 
  she knows all of you well and you all know her . 
  she has been regularly attending for some time . 
  why the f * ck would you ban her ? 
  again , put yourself in _ her _ shoes . 
  or if you prefer , on the shoes of _ any other member of the group _ who has no reason to take revenge against her . 
  really , empathy is not that difficult . 
   the barking dog that caught the car some of the pro-secession parties have been at this for _ at least _ a hundred years . 
  i agree though the 350m/week arguments are extremely poor , but calling them `` barking dog '' is extremely misleading , since they predate some of the current spanish parties by a long stretch . 
  ignore him -- it 's not , and the article does n't even say that . 
  we 're not 27 . 
  we 're over 500 million , and already currently represented in an parliament with over a thousand representatives . 
  this is not something to be disagreed with . 
  this is the definition of revenge . 
  `` a harmful action against a person in response to a grievance , be it real or perceived '' you perceive your ex-so has hurt your feelings . 
  in response , you attempt to hurt hers by blocking her . 
  put yourself in _ her _ situation . 
  yes , that is precisely revenge . 
  if you have problems with this you might want to check yourself for psychopathy or related symptoms . 
  and you 're making this look as if everyone was backstabbing each other . 
  _ i _ do n't know _ what will happen _ . 
  my point is that the pro-eu secessionists plan is to show how much of a fool spain would look if they were to decide , out of of spite , to veto and/or raze catalonia to the ground . 
  and , as i said , today 's news shows that the plan wo n't work , because spain is not ashamed of internationally looking like an evil blind-raged idiot ; and they will not hesitate in walling off scotland out of the eu , even after proudly declaring how much better everything is in the eu . 
  i do n't see a reason why not . 
  as some people in brexit have said , `` remove the middleman '' . 
  why have german l\u00e4nders answer to a deutschland-level government , then to a eu-level parliament ? 
  and we go back to my earlier point that `` revenge based politics '' _ never _ end well . 
   what is then ? 
  i am curious why would you need an example of this . 
  but , for example : `` it 's best for all our citizens to be separate countries '' . 
  for example , one of the reasons spain does n't currently have a working executive ( if not the _ main reason _ ) is `` the catalonia/basque/galician referendum issue '' . 
  remove catalonia , and you have one problem less . 
  spain would be more uniform , and `` easier '' to govern ( if your parliament , like spain 's , does n't seem to be able to function when there are more than 2 parties present ) . 
   avoiding the split of spain , for example . 
  if catalans decide to send a big fuck off to spaniards i do n't expect them to keep being great friends . 
  it will take a while for things to calm down . 
  and a while can be a generation or more . 
  again , that is exactly the definition of revenge , which is hardly objective . 
  catalans hardly say a `` fuck off '' to spaniards if they decide to split off , either . 
  i mean , do you feel as if 50 % of the uk suddenly decided to insult you , me , or the rest of the eu ? 
   we are talking about an union where most of the country have the same coin and open borders . 
  i do n't think that a country can have a neutral opinion on the countries who join the union . 
  i did n't want to imply that _ any _ country can not have any informed opinion at all on other joining countries .
