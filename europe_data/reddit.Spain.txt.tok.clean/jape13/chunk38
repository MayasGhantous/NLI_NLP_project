  you can not , for example , sue the comission . 
  you can not , for example , amend laws . 
  you can not threaten the comission with veto . 
  your analogy is still broken . 
   what is actually relevant in terms of legislative power is ability to actually put these suggestions into law . 
  that power is in the hands of the commission . 
  _ and _ the ep and the council . 
  neither can pass legislation without the other . 
  the mostly-mixed but primarily atheist culture that we are almost approaching these days . 
   no , it has only one mean of influencing legislative . 
  that being vetoing the entire proposal . 
  not just single law , but entire package as being proposed by commission , which is why commission typically bundles legislation with items that would be hard to push through if voted on individually . 
  welcome to the quintessential problem in all western democracies !, 
  this was even referenced on a the simpsons episode ... 
  ideally , on functioning democracies , you prevent this from happening on the first reading -- or at least assume the electorate is smart enough to understand the reasons your favorite green representative just turned down a proposal to increase farm subsidies . 
  in practice , mps do n't read the laws and much less does the electorate . 
  i 'm sure you can point some examples in your country . 
  i know of several in mine . 
  if you ever solve this one out , send me a text and i 'll make you famous . 
  humanity 's been at this for more than a few millennia . 
  despite that , we have n't been able to figure out how to let a large group of representatives systematically decide on complex issues without resorting to binary yes/no absolute majority style calls . 
   honestly , what is it with this denial of obvious in terms of eu lately ? 
  are you afraid that if we talk about problems within eu system as they are , eu opposition will increase which is inherently bad ? 
  before answering to that i would like to know what exactly it is that i 'm denying . 
  you 've started this by mentioning that the ep can not propose amendments to laws , a fact that was surprising to me since i spend quite sometime streaming live ep sessions and my impression is that most of the time it is spent debating , proposing , and voting amendments . 
  turns out that 's not true and meps can propose amendments as in any other parliament . 
   hint : if these problems are n't addressed and soon , eu does n't have much time left . 
  if the bar here is that for the eu to work it needs to have a better democracy than any country in earth , then there 's not much point in discussion . 
  pack up , let 's go home . 
  fortunately , i 'm happy if the bar is just as high as the `` most democratic '' country in the eu . 
  as is anyone with half a brain . 
  whatever that means is open to discussion . 
   stonewalling and pretentious obfuscation is used to silence anyone pointing out the problems . 
  ... maybe you 'd prefer being answered with silence ? 
  someone check if the date of the referendum is really on june 23rd because if so that 's literally the only true fact in the entire flyer . 
  probably even the phone number is a lie . 
   again , it can propose amendments in the same way i can propose you install an anal probe into your anus . 
  and as per your own words it can therefore effectively propose ammendments . 
  your analogy is terrible ; you 're not my doctor to begin with . 
   i can do it , but i have no way to compel you no , you do n't . 
  the parliament has several ... including voting the law down . 
  i do n't know where you got to learn politics , but the ordinary legislative procedure of the ep is the same as my country 's congreso de los diputados ( french inspired ) , and if finland has a bicameral system ( and i have no idea if it does ) , i 'm willing to bet it is exactly the same system too . 
   and yes , much of the time in eu parliament is spent doing things that have zero relevance . 
  like , for example ? 
  it _ is _ bad , and i do n't know in which kind of hell-hole you 're now , but the `` all-christian culture of the 1950s '' here was _ pure _ hell . 
  i do n't know why the article points that , but in the general , the ep can certainly propose amendments . 
  for example , during the latest net neutrality debate a lot of amendments were proposed by certain pirate meps and voted ( and we all know the result ) . 
  then again , that was first reading ... but meps can certainly propose and cote amendments . 
  most of the voting time is spent with amendments , for god 's sake . 
  why do you say that ? 
  the ep can certainly suggest and vote on amendments . 
   it 's so sad that we know so much about what kim jong-un and maduro got for breakfast while most of the spanish people do n't even know who the president of portugal is . 
  as a school history teacher , i 've always been extremely annoyed by this . 
  for example , why does the official curricula almost completely ignore portugal 's dictatorship and most specially portugal 's transition to democracy ? 
  ( my opinion : because then students would realize that spain 's `` transition to democracy '' is far from exemplar , as the official curriculum says ) . 
   `` the best argument against democracy is a five minute conversation with the average voter '' churchill did n't say that at all . 
  ah , the reddit/www bias showing ... 
   if i were to use the  same argument in the context of orlando and said `` everyone will now see allmuslims as a load of gay bashers '' last week i would be screamed at for being racist the problem is that people like trump _ did use exactly that argument _ , all while remembering that he plans to forbid them all out of the country irregardless of their actual `` gay bashism '' . 
  i do n't plan to use the stupidly idiotic argument myself , but i have been certainly reminding certain types of people that , when used , the argument goes both ways . 
   what it 's trying to insinuate that people are notoriously bad at estimating is a good conclusion , and should already make people think . 
  and yet , it was an improvement over the existing ofcom rules ... 
  `` older than feudalism '' . 
  this is mostly what plato complained about democracy a shitton years ago . 
  you do n't actually read this subreddit very much , do n't you ? 
  by suing the uk government whenever they trespass eu privacy laws : * https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/17/data-retention-and-surveillance-legislation-ruled-unlawful by proposing further privacy-friendly legislation : * http://www.computerweekly.com/guides/essential-guide-what-the-eu-data-protection-regulation-changes-mean-to-you ( even if these laws have been criticized by pirate party meps for being ` too small of a step ' , they 're still _ better _ than the current uk legislation ... ) but of course , in practice , the eu can do _ nothing _ to stop the uk government from doing anything ; because , despite what the brexit talking heads say , the uk happily ignores eu legislation they do n't like : * http://itsecurity.co.uk/2016/05/gdprs-new-rules-on-privacy/ and this is just the stuff that 's on the top of my head . 
  google for eu fines to uk ( and nonuk ) companies violating data protection laws , etc. 
  or rather , you 'll lose the good stuff that comes from countries that have saner democracies ( e.g. 
  pirate meps ) , and the country will go full 1984-mode . 
  ( this is what would happen to mine , at least ) . 
  been saying this for ages . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4l4lvc/netflix_amazon_given_quotas_for_euproduced_video/d3kgkzt ) , [ 2 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4eld2z/european_parliament_declares_democracy_in_poland/d21hl4r ) , [ 3 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ehou1/out_ahead_by_3_points_in_britains_eu_referendum/d20e3q7 ) . 
  the catalonia pro-secession people use the same type of arguments , and it always boils my blood . 
  despite the fact that i lean pro-secession . 
   this can easily be rectified by the core eu institutions ( ie parliament and commission ) reaching out and communicating with the eu citizens more directly about what 's happening and what their own governments are doing . 
  i do n't see how would that work . 
  the information is already public . 
  mep polling results , comission allegiances , etc. 
  and despite that , experience has shown you just ca n't fight the `` brussels bureaucrats '' rhetoric with data . 
  the populist `` local '' politician will always end up on top with the `` evil is outside this country '' message , even if many of those `` brussels bureucrats '' are british in the first place . 
   ... just like any dictator or authoritarian leader before he gets to power ? 
  yes , yes , that 's exactly what happened here . 
  yes , which is why this happened : http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/2238952/0/iu-fuerza-votacion/congreso-referendum/monarquia-republica/ sometimes i do n't know why i waste my time here . 
  who cares if they have `` many republicans '' , if they 've convinced themselves that they do n't really want a republic . 
  same thing with podemos -- who cares if they 're communists , if they 've convinced themselves they do n't actually want anything to do with communism . 
  it 's not much better to start your discussion by already asserting that leftist policies will ruin `` economic growth '' , either . 
  i 'm a public school teacher and the number of students without either is alarming , and certainly higher than when i started . 
  yes , and they plan to do that how ? 
  they control exactly _ zero _ of the mass media . 
  i hereby bet that we will see another coup d'\u00e9tat from the army trying to prevent the rise of podemos or any other almost-leftist party to power , than `` podemos implementing a dictatorship '' . 
  since almost the entirely of spanish-republic-leaning voters can now choose between podemos and podemos if they want an option that will at least entertain the idea of a spanish republic , the argument that `` podemos wants a dictatorship '' is not only stupidly wrong , but it 's also mildly insulting . 
   this is n't the time to ruin [ spain ] with leftist policies and that , gentlemen , is how you start a reasonable political debate that does n't end in a downvote war . 
  in fact , they disagree with e.g results during eu constitution referendum , and the pew institute has been known to publish certain other `` questionable '' data sometimes . 
  this being a british tabloid , it would surprise me if it was n't made up . 
  in fact , from looking at the source study itself , it seems that they 're choosing the baseline year that suits them best . 
  to sum it up , support for the eu might have decreased in spain since 2014 , but it 's still higher than it was in 2012 . 
  the study comments on this , but the independent article does not . 
  please remember that the internet is not representative of the general population . 
  much less twitter ( or this subreddit , for the matter ) . 
  i agree so much ... 
  but it 's one of those `` man can dream '' thoughts :(,
