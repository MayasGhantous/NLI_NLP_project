  so you have formal proof of the incorrectness of your assumptions ( that which you call `` theories '' ) , and even empirical proof . 
   if you 're going to try and claim otherwise it 's you that needs the evidence . 
  `` please prove god exists , it 's self evident '' . 
  you simply can not refute an argument calling your assumptions wrong with `` but but but they 're self evident ! '' . 
   bit rich coming from a guy who 's such an expert on sampling and biases and yet produced such a pathetically biased sample in your own `` graphs '' , graphs that proved nothing . 
  first and foremost , what `` graphs '' are you talking about ? 
  second , we 'll have to add ad hominem to your list of logical fallacies . 
   i knew you 'd be both unable to put up , or shut up . 
   show me the data which proves a heavily biased and small sample size is more representative than a larger and more random ( not completely random , but more random ) sample show me the data that proves that sample b is more random _ at all _ than sample a. 
  or less biased , for the matter . 
   no more cute `` theories '' if you turn your brain on for a second and actually analyze what you call `` theories '' , you 'll notice that you 're the one making the unsourced claims here . 
   not really , that may have been the case a few years ago but reddit has shifted to the right over time the internet itself has a strong `` liberal '' in the american sense ( thus far-right in the european sense ) bias , ever since the first days . 
  so this appears like the normal progression to more `` mainstream internet website '' . 
   do the new users represent a more random and varied group of views than the 50k who were here originally ? 
  no , not at all . 
  if you combine a non-random sample a of 10 elements with another non-random sample b of 10000 elements , what do you have ? 
  certainly nothing random , i hope that 's clear enough . 
  certainly nothing ` varied ' , since b 's bias now monopolizes the combined sample . 
  and certainly not a representative sample of anything , save , perhaps , b 's bias . 
  it 's a simple counterproof , really . 
  in fact , sample a could have been more representative overall than the combined a+b sample , even with a 's reduced population !, 
  e.g. , those interested in european politics rather than those interested in reddit . 
  the 750k `` random '' redditors are hardly random . 
  redditors themselves are hardly random . 
  internet users themselves are hardly random . 
   because they fucked up with the terrorists and i would even argue if they actually fucked up anything . 
   you ca n't have schengen and unlimited migration , and you ca n't have islam without a huge security apparatus ... spot the error ... 
  but obviously , let 's give all the priority , budget , and space in political programs to much more urgent problems such as migration . 
  or my `` unalienable right '' to drive a car at every time i want . 
   why could it not be 50/50 % polarized it certainly can be . 
  however , the chances for that are utterly low compared to the chances of a significant chunk of their population voting via coin toss , knowingly or not . 
   but people care a lot are you sure most people actually care ? 
  it 's one thing if they feel passionate about their choice . 
  the question is whether their choice basically comes from a coin flip ( not a _ literal _ coin flip for god 's sake ) . 
   not a disinterested society . 
  and yet participation is still ~ 70ish ... 
  you see polarization , i see the probability distribution of a coin toss . 
  think about it . 
  it 's actually much more probable to get such a `` close call '' result if voters are throwing a coin to decide , than to assume they 're really 50-50 % polarized . 
  so usually , when i see these results i assume a voter base that basically does not care , rather than a extremely polarized society . 
  however , raising the confederate flag or certain versions of the lone star one are not forbidden ... 
   the only thing wrong with it i can think of is the way i used `` tomar de pelo '' well , the fact that you used that expression is a nice touch , but with the way you structured it , the conveyed meaning is that you 're asking the person if he `` is always kidding '' -- not to you , not in that sentence , but at every time . 
  it sounds broken , but also much more offensive than what you intended . 
  the proper use would be '' \u00bf me est\u00e1s tomando el pelo ? '', 
  or at the very least '' \u00bf me tomas el pelo ? '', 
  ( which would still sound strange , albeit without risk of confusion ) . 
  see the wide collection of internet memes for `` street '' usage examples ( https://www.google.es/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=me+estas+tomando+el+pelo , possible nfsw ) . 
  on the other hand , '' \u00bf est\u00e1s en serio ? '', 
  also sounds very strange . 
  being a native , i would n't be able to put my finger on why it sounds strange , but i 'd guess that asking whether you 're `` in a serious state '' is just not common . 
  would the appropiate long forms of it , while simply '' \u00bf en serio ? '', 
  is the informal version ( again , quick google image search for internet meme examples ) . 
  however , this does not exactly have the `` are you serious ? '', 
  meaning as it does in english . 
  in fact , it 's usually used to show positive surprise and/or interest at a fact , without doubting the actual veracity of it . 
  i 'd say it means something more like `` really ? '' . 
  compare `` en serio '' memes with `` are you serious '' memes ( this is why i like using memes as examples for simple expressions  ) . 
  oh , look at the clock . 
  it 's 1919 again !, 
  sometimes i notice that one of the few benefits of spain 's recent troubled history is that the last time the army was deployed in any significant numbers it was used _ against _ the spanish populace . 
  thus , most spaniards have a natural untrusting relationship with the army . 
  this is unlike most ww2 countries ( e.g. , the uk ) , where the army was actually used to defend the populace against an external enemy , and thus it 's something to be actually proud of . 
  there 's yearly celebrations where everyone cheers for the war heroes and news about renewed arms races are welcomed with nationalistic pride . 
  just do n't forget that , like my grandparents , one day you could be at the wrong end of the guns in those brand new aircraft carriers . 
   `` oh your xxx is quite good , do n't worry !, 
  just a minor thing here or there , keep it up ! '', 
  anyone who said that about your original translation attempt would be doing a disservice to you . 
  it sounds completely broken , and is very prone to big , dangerous misunderstandings . 
  note that the quality of google translate for most non-english languages can usually be described as `` utter garbage '' -- it 's so bad that , in comparison , i would say it does a `` passable '' job at english -- thus if someone compares you to it , you 're doing something really bad . 
  your other sentences are much , much better . 
   `` questions asked '' ? 
  that 's just one of the 8 criteria . 
   the gish of this articvle is to show you who really runs the game . 
  or rather , to influence my opinion about `` who really runs the game '' so that my next vote is ( mis ) guided according to their biases . 
   and though this shows some not-so-often mentioned influences by germany , it shows a very clear picture . 
  16/40 are german . 
  because _ they literally decided the list to be that way _ . 
  they had the ( erroneous or not ) preconception that most influencial meps were german , and thus , when they asked themselves the question `` which meps are most influencial '' obviously their first thought was german meps . 
  this is what happens when you use subjective criteria . 
  there 's no new data in this list . 
  only their opinions expressed in a different form designed to give the impression that it is some objective list . 
  the `` clear picture '' you see is by their design . 
  this article is garbage and all conclusions that can be extracted from it will be extremely tainted at best , utter garbage at worst . 
  the list is literally completely arbitrary . 
  a better title would be __ the 40 meps that politico.eu would like us to believe they matter __ . 
  the `` explanatory '' article goes on to mention a few of the actual , objective metrics they _ could _ use to sort meps by ... then proceeds to ignore all of them and put 40 random meps on the list , just because . 
  why do n't you actually use _ any _ of the objective metrics to make the list , politico ? 
  when you do that , a [ much different picture appears ] ( http://www.mepranking.eu/8/ep.php?order=qp ) . 
  and why is politico.eu seemingly so overrepresented in this subreddit , by the way ? 
  there are places in the us with worse unemployment figures -- go ask there . 
   lol you can live in spain without knowing spanish , you clearly havent been in the south , same as i said above , what 's you argument here ? 
  we all know how incompetent the state government is . 
   i do n't think learning languages is a hassle , but i can be in every member of the eu working without knowing the local language , sure it wo n't be comfortable but nobody forces me to well , you are completely wrong there . 
  spain forces you to know spanish , us forces you to know english ( yes , really !, 
  see the visa requirements ) , and many eu countries force you to know their language ( nee france ) . 
   the catalan law forces you to speak in catalan while the spanish one does n't force you to speak spanish.simple as that.i wo n't keep debating with people who deny the reality . 
  it 's funny , because no catalan law so far _ forces you _ to speak catalan ( can you imagine the repercussions this would have ? 
  ) , unlike the spanish constitution , which certainly does . 
  unless you 're a public employee or something like that , in which case catalan law forces you to speak catalan ( my case , and the reason _ i _ was forced to learn catalan ) . 
  you do n't actually have to speak catalan in order to write your propaganda in catalan .
