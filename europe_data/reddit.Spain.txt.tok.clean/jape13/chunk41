  you can hire someone to do that for you . 
  the catalan law certainly allows you to do that . 
  the spanish law _ does not _ . 
  you _ have to speak spanish _ in spain ( i.e. 
  `` you have to know spanish in spain '' ) . 
  so you 're completely wrong . 
  it 's simple as that . 
   and you identified with the postures of all the xenophobes in this sub what the fuck are you talking about now ? 
  which xenophobe posture i just identified with ? 
  are you accusing me of being a xenophobe ? 
  are you insane ? 
  i already accumulate shittons of negative votes just for trying to vouch non-xenophobe arguments in this subreddit . 
   boe says again that it applies to labels . . * sigh * . 
  boe says it applies to _ all inscriptions _ , and by the definitions , this includes labelling on the product itself , labelling on the containers , labelling not in the product iself ( e.g. 
  pamphlets ) , _ and _ advertising . 
  see the second item as an example of something that refers exclusively to labels . 
   the law that forces you to know spanish does n't force you to speak spanish . 
  ( in english , `` to speak a language '' , i.e. 
  speak + a object , actually means `` to be able to use it '' , i.e. 
  `` to know it '' as you say . 
  please reparse my arguments with that in mind ) . 
  ironically , you are quoting a extremely nationalistic webpaper 's ( ara.cat ) article that is , literally , describing surprise at the idea that the proposal does not give the same status to spanish as catalan . 
  even the nationalistic newspaper was surprised at the quality of that one `` proposal '' . 
   people are going in droves to the right now , in spain , people are going in droves _ to the left _ right now . 
   from your link , you can have a sign in your showcase in english without problem where does my link say that exactly ? 
  and if you want more examples : https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=boe-a-1988-28089 ( see definitions in section 5 and section 8 ) or http://www.minhap.gob.es/documentacion/boletines/2015/44521.pdf ( aragon only )  the law about speaking spanish in the road is n't to protect the language , it 's because you have to be able to speak with the police if you have an accident , not to force you to use spanish . 
  `` the law [ that forces you to speak spanish in the road ] [ ... ] is not designed to force you to use spanish '' . 
  that 's exactly what you just said . 
  besides , the constitution itself forces you to speak spanish , if you had any doubts ... 
  i hardly consider myself a nationalist , by the way . 
   the local languages of catalonia are both the spanish and the catalan , if you can speak one and live your life including relations with the police it 's enough . 
  and i would actually accept a discussion about the merits of having a law forcing you to speak _ either _ spanish or catalan , just one of the two . 
  that 's not my favourite option , to be honest , but i suppose it would be ok with those of you who think learning languages is a `` hassle '' ? 
  unfortunately , such a sceneario however is completely out of the question , because current state law already _ forces you _ to speak spanish . 
  thus , the only way to be fair when both languages are co-official is for catalan law to force you to speak catalan . 
   nice that you admit i admit what ? 
  y2k means year 2000 . 
   yeah , probably , ciu and pp did n't have any problem with each other as long as each one kept their fiefdoms of corruption precisely my point . 
   nobody should force you to learn a local language and there we have the root of the problem . 
  are you one of those that argues that migrants do not _ have _ to learn the local language ? 
  _ in this subreddit _ ? 
  good luck with that . 
  as usual , fanatics seem to be ignorant of the laws of their own country . 
  yes , if you have a sign advertising _ anything _ you have to label it in spanish . 
  many sources , few in english ; see for example : http://www.facua.org/es/guia.php?id=107&amp;capitulo=912 not only that . 
  do you drive a vehicle in a spanish road ? 
  if you do n't speak spanish , they can fine the hell out of you . 
  this is spanish law !, 
  but before anyone reads this and thinks `` those wacky spaniards are crazy '' , think again . 
  these types of laws are more common than you think : http://www.elmundo.es/america/2009/10/24/estados_unidos/1256357447.html even in the us you can be fined while driving for `` not being able to speak english '' . 
   ok i 'll be sure to go in some tiny catalonian village and ask the local bar to speak spanish for me  . 
  i 'll tell you how that goes . 
  so now what 's your argument ? 
  that the executive branch of the government is a disaster ? 
  we all know that , i think ...  again . 
  let 's take the law . 
  the official languages in that area are spanish and catalan . 
  so if you speak one or the other you should be fine . 
  actually not -- you have to speak both . 
   if catalonia becomes independent will you still force everybody to show stuff in both catalan and spanish ? 
  that 's the plan ... 
   because it 's just nationalist circlejerking since the law only forces catalan . 
  you 're falling in the same error as a poster below . 
  spanish is already forced , and no catalan law can `` unforce '' it . 
   capitalism works when things have equal laws . 
  looks like i still did n't properly explain my argument . 
  without protectionist laws , most products sold in spain _ would not be labelled in spanish _ . 
  there would be restaurants with menus not in spanish . 
  how is that `` capitalism works '' ? 
   again your examples include foreign languages . 
  that 's `` the course capitalism would run '' . 
  it shows why market forces do not work here . 
  thus that 's the reason there 's a law that forces labelling in spanish in spain ; i just ca n't see why it is suddenly problematic if a law in catalonia enforces labelling in both its official languages . 
  it is certainly a hassle . 
  that 's why a law is required . 
  state law mandates spanish signage already . 
   these are just pathetic revanchist attacks towards the millions of spanish-speaking catalans , ... 
   are you saying hebrew speakers are just as often as spanish speakers in catalonia ? 
  and they have the same legal status ? 
  looks like i completely failed to explain my point . 
  i 'm using hebrew as an example of a language that is obscure to most people around here . 
  without language requirements in labelling , the scenario where the marketing parts of the label are in catalan or spanish while the actually important stuff such as the health warnings is in some obscure language ( incl . 
  english ) is entirely possible . 
  not only it is possible ; but it has happened before . 
  clearly this is one area where market forces alone will not suffice . 
  with a similar goal , there are laws in spain that force restaurants , even vietnamese ones ( again i 'm using vietnamese just as an example of obscure language to make my point ) , to have labels and menus in spanish . 
  and many other perhaps more shocking laws that force a two course + dessert option , etc. 
  popular saying is that these laws were made like this so that franco could enter any restaurant he felt like entering in spain and have paella served on thursdays . 
  exaggeration aside , in my humble opinion , i like these requirements . 
  it means you can go into a random restaurant in the middle of nowhere and have a minimum expectation . 
  the fact that it also reduces ghettoization is also welcome . 
   so , for the sake of simplicity one could choose to use just one language sometimes , right ? 
  it just makes sense , does n't it ? 
  this would be unfair to the official language you did not chose to use . 
  so . . which ruling ? 
  this law is actually around 20 years old ( 1998 , ciu + pp era ) , as the article itself says ( how can he be `` 10 years due '' otherwise ? ) . 
  the only half-related 2010 ruling i could find is about the estatut . 
  the hate show is n't unilateral certainly , but it is , for some reason , relatively recent . 
  before y2k a pp government in catalonia was n't out of the question , as you can see ; similarly , pp had no problem with catalan-promoting laws . 
  to put it simple , because eventually you reach a point where the marketing is in your local language while the `` small details '' , including the cancer disclaimers , are in hebrew .
