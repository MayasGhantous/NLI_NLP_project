  yes , because converts absolutely do not exist . 
  all politicians benefit from tragedies . 
  it 's what they use to justify and implement otherwise impopular measures , such as spying on every citizen , jailing people for tweets , etc. 
  it 's not `` nationalists '' only . 
  we had a right-wing nationalist `` fuck all moroccan migrants '' government when the madrid bombings happened . 
  after the bombings , the country _ turned left-wing _ in response , and was like that for 8 years . 
  you might find it hard to believe with your current glasses , but for me it 's just yet another example of how people are easily manipulated with these tragedies . 
  when there 's another terrorist attack with le pen in power , which politician will be in a better position to exploit the tragedy ? 
  for sure not lepen . 
   being tolerant might be the morally right stance to take ... but it open up to those ... terrible events . 
  being tolerant does not open anyone to these terrible events . 
   besides ... how do you deal with terrorist ? 
  they can hide and pass under the radar until it is to late . 
  and therefore deporting everyone will totally fix an unresolvable issue !, 
  we can also deport all men . 
  same justification . 
  even if the muslim population doubled in size every 15 years ( hard to believe , really , as it has not been the case ) , it would still be a minority in the next decade . 
   that they are making their highly developed and stable nation better for future generations by taking in hundreds of thousands of people from unstable and violent societies that often have very little respect for tolerant societies like sweden ? 
  the simple answer is : because , so far , that _ has been the case _ , as the entirety of europe is on one of the safest periods ever , and there is absolutely no evidence to think that any current policy is leading otherwise . 
  when it does n't make absolutely any political sense , i have a hard time calling it terrorism . 
  why ? 
  i think that 's most countries , actually , not just asian . 
  why do you say that opinion polls masquerade as statistics ? 
  they are pure statistics , as far as i can see . 
  i do n't see these kind of candidates as progressive ( except for marijuana legalization and gay rights perhaps but i believe those are just a question of `` when '' in the western world ) , but more as `` business as usual '' . 
  they 're usually supported by the establishment and a part of the business world . 
  they keep a nice fa\u00e7ade of progressiveness , but at the end not much will change in regard to the environment , electoral reforms , social measures and such . 
  this is actually quite an effective description . 
  after reading it , i immediately thought of the spanish party `` ciudadanos '' , and after a bit of googling turns out that , indeed , macron has been compared several times to rivera ( main ciudadanos candidate ) , even by members of his party https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/en_marche_ !, 
  not good . 
  bad thing europe has not been a `` modern christianity '' continent for nearly all its existence , not even in the past 20 years . 
  correct . 
  atheist europe for the win !, 
  ... or do you know of any major religion that does not promote gender discrimination ? 
  and . 
  still . 
  even sweden has catholic `` uni sex '' schools . 
  this is ridiculous . 
  in my country ( quite western last timed i checked ) certain schools are also segregating by gender even when they are financed by public funds ... _ catholic _ ones . 
  women as second class citizens is a catholic trait for far much longer than it has been a muslim trait . 
  it is one of the most wrong things you could even use to paint this as a `` west vs east '' issue . 
  please note my answer to both scenarios is `` fuck religion '' . 
  except that [ we are respectful of nazism ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/30/spanish-woman-given-jail-term-for-tweeting-jokes-about-franco-era-assassination ) . 
  there is nothing freudian in sleeping with someone else 's mom . 
  unless ... ok , i 'll shut up . 
  i do n't know if it would be the biggest one or not , but for sure it would probably the biggest one that would try to paint the flag ... 
  daily mail , where you can almost certainly assume that everything they publish is false . 
  in this case , the lie is in silently assuming that gibraltar has territorial waters at all . 
  the actual facts are actually worse than what the daily mail is presenting . 
  _ spain does not recognize any territorial waters of gibraltar _ , at all , since according to the government the original treaty very clearly specified `` only the castle and city '' . 
  [ not even the eu recognizes gibraltar ' territorial waters ] ( http://en.mercopress.com/2012/11/30/eu-court-of-justice-confirms-spain-has-a-listed-nature-site-in-gibraltar-waters ) . 
  assuming that there are gibraltar waters to trespass at all is already a one-sided view . 
   same you could argue that hitler had a democratic mandate to remove democracy and murder unwanted groups of people because he won a democratic election . 
  no , he did n't won . 
   my view is that democracy not automatically : you 'd have to elaborate on why democracy is not the most fair of all known systems ...  this badly written law is an example of the limitation of democracy . 
  cause , surely , having an enlighted individual or an unelected group of people dictate exactly the same law in a `` my way or the highway '' fashion for your own good is much better . 
  you are the one painting the issue as `` muddy '' , saying that it is not straightforward if this was about a democratic republic vs fascist dictatorship . 
  i am not going to enter into nitpicking on whether the 2nd republic had problems or not ( because it did , but so does the current regime -- imagine how would spain look today if we had started _ ahead _ of the other countries in the civil rights race instead of several decades behind ) . 
  i am just going to point the silliness of saying that `` is is not straightforward '' to say that one side basically made a coup d'etat against a democratic government . 
  this is a _ fact _ . 
  this is how history rewriting begins . 
  first you muddy the waters , then . . 
  i _ do _ have an obligation to point that `` one of the options '' was a _ lawful democratic republic _ while the other one was a fucking . 
  fascist . 
  dictatorship . 
  which is what i pointed at the start of the discussion . 
  i have to ponder exactly what goes through the brain of someone who would try to paint this comparison as `` muddy '' . 
  you are not a fascist for saying that the 2nd republic may have been a shitshow ( in the same way i would n't consider myself a fascist for saying that the _ current regime _ is an actual shitshow ) . 
  you , however , would be a fascist if _ even for a second _ you entertain the idea that a fascist _ dictatorship _ was justifiable in any way when compared to a working democracy . 
   arbitrary confiscation of private property , vote recount manipulation , political assassinations through the police and/or sanctioned groups . 
  hum . 
  are you sure you 're not confusing the actual republic with what happened _ after _ the coup ? 
   having a worse regimen afterwards does n't make this one any good . 
  sorry , there 's just _ no color _ . 
  the 1931 constitution was just better ( according to today 's definitions , e.g. 
  women voting rights ) than almost anything else in the day . 
  not to mention that the fact the weimar republic had its problems does n't excuse damn friggin ' hitler . 
  yes , it is straightforward to answer . 
  in which way the democratic government was ` unlawful ' ? 
  but denying the holocaust is somewhere where i 'd draw the line . 
  you 're for sure a nutcase if you are still doing that . 
  going to jail because you made a movie about a historical hitler assassination attempt and the court considered that as `` promotion of terrorism '' ... is what makes this different . 
  this is basically what happened . 
  you might argue that the teenager in question was humiliating the victim ... but the victim , in this case , was basically hitler . 
  tldr the court is now saying that the fight against our fascist dictators is now `` terrorism '' . 
  of course it is being done to avoid rising the conflict again , because the hitler side does not want the public opinion to realize they are still in power . 
  specially now that there 's no longer any communist enemy to fear ... 
  `` preventing radical islam from spreading its message of terror '' . 
  this is not a hate speech law . 
  this is a anti-terrorism law . 
  half of this reddit ( or more ) would find the law acceptable and _ would have cheered for it _ , since `` it allows us to go against radical mosques '' . 
  the fact that it also allows the government to go against `` radical '' teenagers tweeting against our local historical hitler equivalent is just an '' `` unfortunately unforeseen side effect '' '' . 
  i 'm certain of that . 
  next time there is a terrorist attack , think carefully about your reactions . 
  it was promoted as a tool to fight terrorism , so yes , it had support . 
  this is because the `` hitler '' side ( i 'll leave it to you whether it is the right or the wrong side , but you can bet what i think ) basically won the war , and their descendants are still ruling this country . 
  so obviously , any mention of ... `` hey guys , what about getting some justice , now that this is supposedly a democracy et al. . . like , can i get to know what you did with my father 's corpse after you guys executed him ? '', 
  gets answered with a `` there was no wrong side ! '' . 
  by repeating that enough times , they are convincing [ international observers ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/26/argentina-spain-general-franco-judge ) ... 
  the usual : put a few random kids behind bars , make an example to the general population .
