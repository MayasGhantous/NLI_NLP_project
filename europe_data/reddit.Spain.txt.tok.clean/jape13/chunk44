  works for piracy ... 
  next : putting in jail all authors of `` the downfall '' hitler youtube parodies because they humiliate victims of allied terrorism . 
  and now you get why i 'm more scared of my government than from terrorism . 
  ah , yet another 1984 `` feature '' proposed with the _ wo n't anyone think of the terrorists ?!? 
  ! _ argument . 
   just a couple of guys jailed `` we are doing nothing '' . 
  and on what charges were the guys jailed ? 
   it 's been done since forever . 
  some things are prohibited to be mocked across europe for years . 
  fact that you see someone being sentenced just now is your own ignorance . 
  ok your highness , show me . 
  show me one guy jailed in democratic europe for something he said . 
  i could only think of holocaust-denier level stuff . 
  the new part is not the fact that hate speech is forbidden . 
  it is the fact that _ precisely _ anti-terrorism laws are being used to prosecute these guys . 
  and before you start , no , it 's not just one rap singer . 
  4-5 random teenagers jailed this month alone , and it is being done using a law specifically designed to target `` islamic terrorism '' : https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/25/world/europe/spain-europe-protest-free-speech.html?_r=0 but we are doing nothing , of course . 
   requiring visas for russia has nothing to do with it . 
  it 's not about visas -- he had one . 
  it 's about the airport interview and how you can _ literally _ ruin your life with one misguided answer thanks to the draconian border policies that european countries are implementing in response to terrorism . 
  but we are doing nothing , of course . 
   you ca n't even comprehand that they themselves do not want spain either . 
  what on earth do i need to comprehend to understand the fact that we are rejecting refugees ? 
  me and another few hundred thousand people were demonstrating not too long ago precisely because of that . 
   you still see them as people running from war torn places but this is not the case for almost 2 years now . 
  the people you see today want to benefit just themsleves and spain is not in their plans . 
  most of them are not even from syria . 
  for the 100th time , just no . 
  it is a war torn place . 
  i am plenty aware that most of them have never been syrian , specially the early ones , since syria was hosting almost half of all afghan and iraq refugees . 
  i 'd quote acnur but you 'd say that they are biased , so why bother . 
  and exactly why would this matter ? 
  have you read the geneva convention ? 
   it 's done for a reason and it seems it 's doing what 's it intended to do . 
  so we are not doing anything . 
  clearly . 
   i , being an european citizen , would not have been allowed to do that . 
  a majority of european citizens have voted to do that . 
  fortunately . 
  this is one of the rights actually _ i _ fought for ( no need to look back at my parents for it ) . 
  and now , it is lost . 
  my bag is searched while crossing the french-italian border on a _ private _ vehicle and all i can do is bend over . 
  but we are not doing anything . 
   you just trow things and hope they stick but of course none are sticking , because `` we are not doing anything '' . 
   eating up their money , selling them weapons and allowing them to spread their radical beliefs is a huge deal to me . 
  we are no longer selling them weapons , we are freezing their accounts based on lame charges , and as per your own post above , we are putting them on jail . 
  what else do you want ? 
  a state of emergency so you can search their homes without warrant ? 
  done in france . 
  deported to random countries without trial ? 
  done in germany ( pending echr , but does n't look likely to do what is supposed to do these days ) . 
  what else ? 
  as i suggested above , maybe we should drop the right to reunion ? 
  i think we tend to strike too much these days . 
  one extra turkey-funded demonstration and watch how quickly we will lose another fundamental right in europe . 
  mark my words . 
  so , _ ironically _ , i am currently in a bus to lyon airport , and the bus was stopped around 20minuts ago . 
  ** our bags ** ( around 40 passengers ) ** were searched by armed gendarmes ** . 
  1hr delay for a 1h bus trip . 
  despite the coincidence i have to assume it has nothing to do with the fact i posted the above message , and that it was another random search , perhaps because of the london craze reaction . 
  we 're not doing anything , my ass . 
   yep , bulgaria-malta , malta-barcelona , malta-bulgaria , zero military presence isnide the airport i can confirm that barcelona had nothing as of _ yesterday _ , and as i said , spain had been mostly clean . 
  but barcelona sants train station - check lyon tgv - check lyon airport - check charles de gaulle - check zaventem - check ( `` join the military '' adverts included ) trondheim - check and this is just for a trip last week ...  according to me , yep , they are not closed . 
  ok , where ? 
   terrorism and the mocking of it 's victims is a kind of hate speech for me . 
  `` to show our respect for charlie hebdo , we 'll put all of their colleagues on jail '' whatever is your opinion on whether it is effective or not , it is something that is being done now using anti-terrorism laws . 
   it 's because they have visa requiring to some eu nations and refuse to remove it . 
  i wo n't even argue this since i think there 's plenty of examples left . 
   probably the economic restrictions but i am not sure . 
  is it relevant to this discussion as well ? 
  increased airport controls _ is _ part of this discussion . 
   no one wanted to come great , now there is no migrant problem at all . 
  in any case , many countries are not accepting them , and spain is one of them . 
   your headlines are hilarious . 
  they got someone with false travel documents in the shengen area during a check . 
  geez . 
  so racist i could care less about your opinion . 
  the headline just shows how schengen is being regularly suspended these days -- even if you are ignorant of it . 
   huge deal and loss of rights right here . 
  i could care less of your opinion . 
  if you dislike this example , take any other loss . 
   maybe stop sucking sa money and not doing anything about radical mosques rather than jailing this lone rapper that probably got the idea from somewhere shrugs . 
  so now it 's `` not doing anything about radical mosques '' rather than `` not doing anything at all '' ... 
  evidence beyond a reasonable doubt is actually less strict than obvious . 
  if one can not even dispel reasonable doubt is that one has basically no evidence . 
  terrorism used to involve a political cause . 
  i fail to see these on almost anything that is being called terrorism these days . 
   never got chekced in an airport before . 
  where do you live ? 
  last 2 flights i did n't see any guns at all to be fair . 
  really ? 
  _ really ? _ you have n't see military presence in european airports this last year ? 
  and to be honest i thought spain was safe from this since we mostly hate our military ... but on my past trip to bilbao there were army guys too . 
  it is not surprising to me in the slightlest that [ people who do n't travel at all are the ones most in favour of this types of restrictions . ] ( https://www.indy100.com/article/passport-united-states-donald-trump-republican-rural-map-ownership-america-7436541 ) . 
   is not stopping anyone to preach in the wahabi mosques really ? 
  _ really _ ? 
  they 're [ putting people in prison now for `` offensive '' tweets about long-dead historical figures ] ( https://www.wsj.com/articles/spanish-rap-star-sentenced-to-prison-for-tweets-1484853050 ) . 
  but according to you wahabi mosques are exempt from this . 
   and importing isis terrorists without checking them . 
  so for some reason they keep checking me but they do n't check isis terrorists .
