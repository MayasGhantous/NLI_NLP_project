  yes , sure . 
   and where is getting a visa harder ? 
  my company just forwarded an email to me about restrictions for egyptian citizens . 
  last week , there was talks about eu requiring visa again for american citizens . 
  the week before that , the trump ban . 
  a month ago , i got a russian friend stopped at the eu border for 24h just because he said the wrong words during the border interview . 
  there 's daily new horror stories about people being retained at the us and uk borders , even with valid visas . 
  where is it that you live ? 
   what part of the geneva convention ? 
  the refugee one ? 
  the one that the refugees ignore themselves , become migrants and still get asylum in germany ? 
  how is it ignored ? 
  because countries are not accepting them , period . 
   you mean when they try processing people that are not eu citizens ( no shengen rules apply ) and fail at it because someone did n't close it 's border and did not apply the rules that are required when you enter shengen ? 
  sound like not doing anything to me . 
  no , i mean when i ( a spain citizen ) am stopped at the french border , searched , groped , and passport-stamped for absolutely no reason . 
  just google for [ france airport queues at passport control ] ( http://www.latribune.fr/entreprises-finance/services/transport-logistique/roissy-adp-veut-en-finir-avec-les-queues-interminables-aux-controles-de-police-617292.html ) . 
  or [ schengen suspension ] ( http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20170130/local/illegal-travel-from-italy-discovered-with-suspension-of-schengen.638106 ) . 
  or anything you 'd like for . 
   i think they already had conscription there [ no . 
  ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/02/europe/sweden-conscription/ )  what world did you live in untill this day ? 
  this is not a single case here , every time something happens the same statements are made and nothing is done to prevent the next one * please stop saying that _ nothing is done _ * . 
  `` none so blind as those who refuse to see '' , as we say in spain . 
   your so called `` loss of rights '' , i do n't know what you are even refering to , but are as good as nothing when you are dead by the next atack . 
  this is literally a textbook example of demagoguery . 
  a word i have n't seen used in a long time ever since it became mainstream politics . 
  actually i am going to propose that for the sake of change we do _ absolutely nothing _ this time . 
  otherwise i fear which one of _ my _ rights are they going to indefinitely suspend this time . 
  reunion ? 
   so your suggestion is to just cross our collective fingers ? 
  the suggestion is to treat this risk _ with the same importance _ _ you _ treat other risks of similar or even larger magnitude . 
  to think for a second of the downsides of any proposal you try to implement to mitigate this risk _ as you would treat other risks of similar or even larger magnitude _ . 
  there 's a fucking guy with machine gun groping my parts every time i try to board a flight and you say we 're not doing anything ? 
  the government in my own country is putting people behind bars just because of some tweets could `` enact terrorism '' and you say we 're not doing anything ? 
  getting visas is getting harder not easier for the first time since the last world war and you say we 're not doing anything ? 
  european countries now drop schengen whenever they feel like it and we 're not doing anything ? 
  the geneva conventions are being regularly ignored whenever its convenient and you say we 're not doing anything ? 
  nord european countries are increasing military spending and some of them are bringing back conscription and you say we 're not doing anything ? 
  i can be thrown in jail _ without the right to consult a lawyer _ until i 'm suddenly deported out of _ my _ country to a random place i have no relationship with other than my ascendance and you say we 're not doing anything ? 
  many countries are considering building walls , fences with razor blades ( or have already built ) as if it was east berlin all over again except over much larger areas and you say we 're not doing anything ? 
  mass surveillance is now commonplace in almost all european countries up to the point leaks about how they 're basically spying on _ fucking _ everyone no longer surprise us and you say we 're not doing anything ? 
  separation of powers is no longer existent in many western democracies , with executives declaring almost-perpetual states of emergency , overriding legislative bodies and replacing judges as they see fit , and you say we 're not doing anything ? 
  several parties with more than 20 % polling in european countries promote not only allowing but directly encouraging _ discrimination _ in employment by race/ascendance/religion , and you say we 're not doing anything ? 
  i do n't know in which world you guys live that a single lunatic yesterday is more important than the loss of rights that me , my father , and my grandfathers fought for more than a century . 
  all the elements of 1984 are literally here . 
  crime-think ( twitter-crime ) , tvs that spy on us , an enemy towards whom we dedicate our daily 5 minutes of hate ( and if you do n't , you are `` unpatriotic '' ) , growing unconcern for human rights for `` increased safety '' , ... and every single one of those rights has been lost to `` fighting terrorism '' . 
  i have to ponder if the time when you 'll say `` we finally did something '' is when we start the civil war that is in the preface to 1984 ... 
  i do n't know which accident is more preventable , to be honest . 
  a lunatic driving a car with the intention of causing damage or a lunatic driving the car under the influence . 
   its just a perceived threat when they march down the street for sharia in the thousands where ? 
   when the heart of a european capital gets struck like yesterday https://visionzerolondon.wordpress.com/latest-pedestrians-and-cyclists-deaths-in-london/  when millions of them are openly calling for the destruction of us and our culture . 
  where ? 
   a clear and present danger can not be ignored any more https://visionzerolondon.wordpress.com/latest-pedestrians-and-cyclists-deaths-in-london/  for human rights no one is even infringing on this is the reason one of the arguments of brexit was to be able to ignore the rulings of the echr ... 
   what a load of horseshit . 
  when you 're feeling discriminated against you go and commit terrorist attacks ? 
  really ? 
  if muslims are so fragile that they go batshit crazy at the slightest sing of unfriendliness then they need to be kept out of our countries . 
  `` if the average voter is so fragile that it drops all pretense of human rights at the slightlest increase of `` perceived '' migration and votes batshit insane far-right-wing parties , they need to be kept out of my countries . '', 
  actually , 47 % vs 38 % ** is ** a majority . 
  absolute majority is what you 're thinking of . 
  i agree with the rest of the observation , which is why . .  not a single referendum has been made . 
  this is because , as i 've said numerous times , spain is actually a fake country , and a big percentage of its current citizens do not have any respect for its flag at all , or even actively fight what it represents . 
   they had an pseudo-referendum in 2014 ( 33 % turnout ) ... low turnout , but majority was in favor . 
   then they converted regional election into another referendum , getting 47 % support for independence ... again , majority in favor  i guess the idea is make referendums over and over until they get 51 % to back a declaration of independence . 
  actually , not a single referendum has been made . 
  doctrina parot , illegatilization of political parties , `` enaltecimiento del terrorismo '' ( the tirititeros were accused of a pre-mordaza crime ) , and a extremely long list . 
  just check the latest report on human rights ... and all the ones before it . 
  great , `` mission accomplished '' . 
  now , will we see any of the fuck-human-rights draconian laws that were approved `` in order to fight them more easily '' repelled ? 
  yes it did . 
  we have a shitton of draconian laws and a pretty bad record at human rights because of them . 
  i 'd say the won . 
   algeria became independent via a referendum that was voted in the ensemble of france . 
  here we are , rewriting history again ... no , the algerian referendum was voted _ in algeria _ only . 
  and by the way , quite a lot of blood was spilled in order for it to happen ( and even as descendant of pied noirs , i still think it was the right move ) . 
   ireland became independent via an act of the parliament of the uk . 
  ... which basically approved a resolution saying that they would allow ireland 's houses ( not the parliament of uk ) to decide whether to continue with uk rule or not ( which is how northern ireland happened ) . 
  let 's not even the mention the blood that was shed before this one happened . 
  evidently , the precedents show that the only possible forward way is for another civil war . 
  * removes glasses * * ponders if you read what you wrote * what is the part you quoted exactly trying to achieve ? 
  how is exactly an argument of any type the fact that the court was physically located in catalonia ? 
   to pay your medicines instead of opening fake embassies i thought the `` less iphones '' argument would already be d\u00e9mod\u00e9 , specially after this week in the us , but i guess i was wrong . 
  because all polls do the same in order to increase the accuracy by tenfold . 
  it 's just common sense . 
   why are you being obtuse on this ? 
  do n't you agree that a parliament you can coerce into whatever you want is vastly different than a parliament you ca n't control in any way ? 
  of course i agree on that . 
  but in which way did hollande control the parliament if he had to use a 49.3 ? 
   the president picks the prime minister [ ... ] from the party that has won the legislative elections i know almost nothing of the french system other than what spain shamelessly copied . 
  in any case , if this true , then it means that france basically has no separation at all between executive and legislative ... 
   the burden of proof relies on you first to prove your `` fact '' what ? 
  are you denying that [ contact of the wheel with the road produces pollution ? ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=particulate+matter+wheel ) ? 
  are you denying that even [ optimistic estimates not even show 10x less particulates ] ( http://www.pnas.org/content/111/52/18490.abstract ) ? 
  this is older than the mis-attributted study which showed they were on par ... 
  in fact , i ponder if you live on the same city as i do , as `` your observations '' include a significant number of `` junk scavenger vans '' that constantly roam around the city ... are you sure you 're not thinking of mad max ? 
  in fact , i propose the following eye opening experiment . 
  just look out of the window , and count cars , buses , and any other type of vehicle you could think of . 
  repeat this once for every hour , to eliminate bias caused by rush hours ( which would , by the way , lean the numbers towards private cars ) . 
  do you still think for a second that nothing but private cars are the main cause of pollution if barcelona ? 
  did you see any of these `` scavenging vans '' during this experiment ?
