  it was their upbringing . 
  the turks were good workers do n't get me wrong but they raised one rubbish generation after the other that had every oportunity to flourish yet a significant amount of them failed to do exactly that . 
  as a second order blood relative of a spaniard who emigrated to germany during the 50s wave , i can only laugh at this , considering the reception they got . 
  if they did n't break a bone that day , they `` did n't work hard enough '' that day . 
  xenophobia is always the same story ... 
  yet , its not exactly convincing when there is the much simpler explanation `` police is racist '' , which is what is known to be going on many other countries , such as spain , or the usa . 
  please explain why . 
  i 'm questioning the assumption that incarceration ratio means actual crime ratio . 
  not only its not proven anywhere , it is also quite easy to find data on how are your chances of proper defense much lower if you 're black . 
   the situation in sweden must be great . 
  what the fuck . 
  the situation in sweden _ is _ great . 
  compare it to the us , compare it to even souther european countries . . until some of them started voting nazi parties , the stereotype in spain was that scandinavian democracies were the only ones _ from the entire world _ that actually worked ( i.e. 
  rid of corruption , no stupid voters , actual 3 power separation , etc. 
   if i remember correctly a study in 2005 by br\u00c5 found out that half ( 47 % or 53 % ) the people in prison serving long term were of foreign descent . 
  and now these studies are n't made in fear of racism . 
  seriously , if you gave me the same numbers for e.g. 
  spain , i 'd immediately assume the problem is that police is racist , and i 'd bet a month 's salary i would be right . 
  so , cut the suspicious middleman and point directly to the actual data . 
  our laws were made in 78 and they still mention blasphemy . 
   almost all issues raised were wrong : `` it is not my useless visualization that is wrong , it is the reviewers !, 
  curse you , reviewer # 2 !!! '', 
  the fact that it is completely misleading , therefore useless as a visualization , is not controversial ? 
   _ the choice of the pairs of languages on which to apply the metric _, 
  i do n't known if its the metric or the choice of the pairs of languages on which to apply the metric , but this graph is even more broken since it now shows catalan closer to italian than occitan ... 
  almost every speaker of a romance language can _ read _ average difficulty texts in most other romance languages . 
  this is the basis of interlingua , for example . 
   neither were punished , which kinda validates what i said , does n't it ? 
  the point is , diplomats from me are _ not _ allowed to pull off `` outrageous shit '' . 
  if they do , they get kicked out of the country -- the maximum punishment that you can apply to a foreign diplomat . 
  this is exactly opposite as what you suggested in your post , and your two current examples in fact contradict you . 
  so why do you keep insisting ? 
  that is not exactly `` allowed '' , since on both situations they were made persona non grata ; the highest ( and only ) sanction you can apply to a foreign diplomat . 
   currently , diplomats from the me are allowed to pull off far more outrageous shit than riding a camel . 
  like for example ? 
  they do both things _ at the same time _ ? 
  meh , those refugees are truly skilled !, 
  some photos in http://cat.elpais.com/cat/2017/02/18/album/1487436805_078495.html ( note : i 'm not attending  ) . 
  the usual thing with the trump voters/bots : they believe everyone agrees with trump 's core assumptions ( deep down ) . 
  such as that mexico is composed of `` bad hombres '' and therefore everyone in the world would ressent a comparison with mexico . 
  of course not , since to do that while attempting to do maintain any facade of self-consistance , they would also need to ban the el pollo one ( aka fascist spanish flag ) . 
  and there are too many of those around to enrage ... 
   notice how i specifically said muslim terrorist attacks notice how i explicitly ignored it since i can not figure _ why _ that would be important for a terrorist attack . 
  at some point i 'm quite sure you 're going to ask for sunni attacks only just to shape the data to your incorrect view . 
   explain how tourists are now less likely to die in terror attacks recently than before . 
  that is exactly what the data shows . 
   can you give me any source that shows how muslim terrorist attacks in europe have n't increased in the past few years ? 
  because i very highly doubt that . 
  http://www.datagraver.com/case/people-killed-by-terrorism-per-year-in-western-europe-1970-2015  exactly , we have a given probability of dying from a certain cause so why would we worry about the rising probability of dying from any other cause . 
  great , cause antibiotic resistant-organisms present a much faster faster rising threat . 
   a vastly increased amount of terrorist attacks false . .  the statistical error of dying in a plane crash still a nonsensical value , since youre more likely , among many things , to fall down on your shower and crush your skull on the day before the trip . 
  went to a city that is more dangerous in almost any metric . . ( i live there ), 
  `` feels '' -- the source of many of the problems in this day and age . 
   can you point out an instance where government default has not made the life of common people harder ? 
  can you point an instance where not defaulting has not made life of people harder ? 
  no one is pointing this up as the universal solution to everything . 
  just as , possibly , the least painful alternative . 
  ... why ? 
  and please note that `` taking revenge '' is also a dream . 
  not the damage that they will cause , which will be very real , but the `` taking '' part . 
  wait , what ? 
  i do n't think for a second that either the uk or the us have been the first countries to vote for new , young parties after being `` fed up with the system '' . 
  what they have been the first for , if anything , is the first countries to vote for idiots because they were `` fed up with the system '' . 
  nothing happened _ in _ the reactor . 
  this has nothing to do with the nuclear part , it seems . 
   the fact is that the borders within the schengen-eu have the same status as the border between usa and mexico . 
  no , not at all . 
  why ???? 
   i fail to see how your comment adds anything but misinformation . 
  `` fortress europe '' is not any misinformation . 
  we have as much barbed wire ( or worse -- razor wire , of which my country is very proud of ) in the outside borders as the us currently has with mexico . 
  and the majority of the population is in favor of adding more fences , not less . 
  i meant `` how little of a country is '' as in , it would not change the fact that scotland is _ not _ a country de facto . 
  apologies . 
   i do n't know the exact numbers , memory fails me alas , but i seem to remember scottish independence gaining ground in scotland ( as a majority already ) , whereas in catalonia and the baque country the `` majorities '' are n't as defined . 
  your memory is failing , and also this would not change at all how little of a country scotland is , in practice . 
   a national army having to have deadly weapons because of the arms race between countries ( and not use them ) , and people blowing up innocents because of their hateful ideology . 
  the ad is pointing that _ if they ever get to use their deadly weapons _ , then the analogy exists , and i certainly agree . 
  i mean , what 's the difference between a national army and `` people '' ? 
  what 's the difference between deadly nuclear weapons and `` blowing up innocents '' ? 
  what 's the difference between arms races between countries and `` hateful ideology '' ? 
  the video clearly says `` in the eu '' . 
  scotland is as much of a country as california is . 
  de jure , sure . 
  de facto , as much as flanders or catalonia . 
  reasoning : what would have happened had westminster parliament not agreed to devolution , or more recently , the independence referendum ? 
   it 's because right wingers recently are more organised and very united in their goals , whereas the rest of us cut them too much slack and think they 're not too bad/don ' t want to be too confrontational or just plain old want to hear varied opinions . 
  i do n't think this is `` recent '' at all . 
  it has been like that for my entire life . 
  even the spanish civil war was basically one big `` right-wingish '' front against a _ myriad _ ( and i really mean a myriad ) of left-wingish forces . 
  representatives which are literally supposed to represent the will of the `` general populace '' . 
   you have a parliamentary system precisely to avoid the will of the people . 
  so in which way it does that ? 
  stop criticizing others for stuff that she herself is doing ? 
  likewise , voting for anti-immigration parties when half of your young have themselves emigrated to other countries which may also vote on anti-immigration parties . . 
  sorry , but no : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_urban_areas_in_the_european_union not even close . 
   it 's the net migration rate , emigration is already deducted . 
  that has absolutely nothing to do with what i said . 
  why are n't the labour markets aimed at servicing the public good ? 
  they are in my country ... despite the fact that they 're obviously not very efficient at doing so .
