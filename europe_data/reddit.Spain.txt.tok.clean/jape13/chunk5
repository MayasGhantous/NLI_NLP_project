  that is sure to smooth out the rest of the conversation !, 
  i hardly speak _ any _ of these languages ( i was born in teruel ) , and yet i am able to understand how the _ complete _ lack of tact many spaniards show literally prevents peaceful conversation . 
   well , if i ask you `` could you tell me where the cathedral is ? '', 
  in english and you answer me the direction in spanish it 's a pretty rude movement unless you do n't know english , in which case i assume you would n't give me the direction in spanish . 
  welcome to bilingual countries !, 
  it happens often , frequently in both directions , and no one cares . 
  now add some theatrics to suggest that this is the bane of all evil and it is what will happen if they start teaching catalan in some of the catalan-speaking areas of aragon . 
  that is totally not going to remind catalan-speaking people of the [ `` soyez propres '' ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/speakfrenchbeclean.jpg ) campaigns france used to make occitane a nearly-extinct language . 
  and it 's certainly going to set the minority of catalan speakers in aragon in the proper mood for further discussion . 
  that 's what they 're doing . 
  creating divisions where there are none . 
   while the user i answer to basically calls an ethnic cleanse by the spanish government . 
  and the example i linked above shows the current spanish government attempting to win votes for future elections based on ethnic cleansing . 
  as said , this is not a random spaniard , nor even a mayor-of-nowhere random politician doing a gaffe . 
  that was a _ paid advertisement _ . 
  imagine the current catalonia ruling party doing the opposite advertisement in catalonia . 
  it would most definitely trigger a civil war _ in catalonia _ alone , and _ universal _ condemnation by the rest of spain . 
   which looks like the most probable thing i 'd disagree , but in any case ...  they might want to move elsewhere other than catalonia . 
  and i do n't know if the spanish government would help this people . 
  that 's why i 'm worried . 
  and i must emphasize my question again : why do you believe that ? 
  i mean , why do you think they would want to move elsewhere ? 
  it 's not like anyone is proposing a berlin wall or anything like that . 
  this seems part of yet another fear , uncertainty and doubt campaign . 
   catalonia who disagree with independance and what will they do in case separation hapens . 
  we plan to kill them all and dump them on mass graves . 
  then refuse repeated requests by the un to set up some public funds to open up these graves . 
  oh wait ... now , seriously , what i would like to know is why you are worried about this . 
  which one of pro-secession parties have made any kind of remarks that could have caused you to worry about this ? 
  using exactly which school of logic can you argue `` that _ most _ of spain respects catalonia '' and then try to argue that `` on the other hand [ catalonia does not respect spain ] '' citing _ a single example _ ? 
  do you want more examples ? 
  listen to this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93hemrrn_4w and this does not come from a random spaniard . 
  it was a _ paid advertisement _ of the current ruling party in spain _ literally making fun of the catalan language _ . 
  and you wonder why people like you are managing to cause people _ not born in catalonia _ to also feel that catalonia needs to secede ? 
  except for trolls , almost everyone knows that despite the fact that stupid pp is trying _ its best _ to tear catalonia-spain relations apart , most people in spain actually do not have any specifically negative opinion of catalans . 
  _ but the opposite is also true _ : despite best efforts by certain parties , most people in catalonia have no negative feelings about the rest of spain . 
   read again and/or learn to count . 
  literally , the text in bold translates to : `` one school in nav\u00e0s and two in osona '' . 
  last time i read about peano axioms , 2 +1 was equal to 3 . 
  and if you want a list of all the 3743 public schools in catalonia , i could provide a list , including addresses and phone numbers . 
   i do n't have time to help you with that ... 
  but you do have time to troll ... 
   most schools in the little towns of girona , barcelona and lleida have giants pro-independence flags/slogans in the very front entrance . 
  as per _ your own link _ all of the non-secessionist parties tried to find examples of `` adoctrination '' in catalan schools and yet all they could find where `` estelades '' in _ just 3 schools _ out of the approximately 3700 public schools in catalonia . 
  clearly rampant indoctrination !, 
  it 's even worse than 40 years ago !, 
  nazi germany or * gasp * north korea levels !, 
  heck , i can count many more than 3 schools with christian symbols ( which i would remove too ) , while in my 30 + years living in catalonia , i am yet to see a single school with a `` estelada '' . 
   either you do n't know or you are misrepresenting the reality ... sigh . 
  in fact , i would argue it 's the `` yes '' supportes the ones that have least options , because the major `` yes '' parties have all associated into a single ballot option . 
  imo a stupid move , probably designed to ( exploiting the stupidities of spain 's d'hondt-based voting system ) make it possible to have  50 % of parliament seats with only ~ 45 % of voters . 
  i suspect that if they had not actually joined , `` yes '' supporter parties would have ended up with more than 50 % of the vote but significantly less than 50 % of seats . 
   if they were treated as an equal to the rest of the communities , they would lose a lot of their current competences . 
  which competences ? 
  so called `` camps clause '' basically ensures _ any _ competence granted to catalonia ( and specifically catalonia ) is automatically granted to valencia . 
  and this clause comes from one of the most anti-catalanist parties around ... 
  good examples . 
  both of them are comprised of actual federal , republican states ( unlike spain today ) . 
   i see it as the only way we stop war and hunger . 
  but this is almost never true . 
  in fact , smaller countries tend to have better functioning democracies , if only because their citizens are represented more proportionally . 
  should n't you take that argument somewhere else ? 
  like the nordic countries , or the uk ? 
  i mean , for all that 's worth , catalonia 's population is actually very pro-european union , even in support of a federated union . 
  they even voted ` yes ' to the european constitution back when it was a red herring . 
   i do n't think so . 
  this case starts with a complaint from an erc local politician in 2012 . 
  it 's also handled from a court in el vendrell ( catalonia ) . 
  a complaint in 2012 means the case has already virtually prescribed , since it presumably happened before that , there is a 4-year statute of limitations for illegal funding , and no way in hell any case is going to be built in less than half a year by whatever they find out today . 
  yes , that 's spain ( & catalonia ) for us ... maybe if there 's an additional referendum in november , 
  hey , look on the bright side : we have finally found a way to get the wheels of justice rolling in spain : call for independence plebiscite/elections . 
  catalonia is not even independent yet , and still independence is already showing positive effects !, 
  both in spain ( more efficient justice system ) and specially catalonia ( finally someone is prosecuting this ) . 
  give those election-motivated zealots a few more years and we might very well rid catalonia of corruption !, 
  just to give you an idea how frigging slow the wheels of justice roll in spain , this `` 3 % comission '' case [ was widely known as early as 2005 ] ( http://elpais.com/diario/2005/02/25/espana/1109286001_850215.html ) . 
  it is usual for the statute of limitations for a given corruption case to be [ long expired by the time the prosecutor office gets to a case ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/escolar/inutil-tribunal-cuentas_6_97350265.html ) . 
  i 'm quite sure this case is already prescribed too , and therefore the current operation is clearly just for show . 
  but i 'm still thankful that someone is at least trying , even if for the wrong , election motivated reasons . 
   the fee was a month 's rent a month ? 
  mine was _ 6 _ months , and i 'm spaniard . 
  `` fortunately '' , i was planning on staying in bcn for 6 months exactly ... 
  that would , in fact , be africa  however , if you center on western culture , that 's another story ... 
   you 're better than the others the discussion is about being ` different ' , not better or worse . 
  note that i do n't care ; i do n't think being `` different '' is a requisite for secession . 
  well yes , i 've already seen that when discussing these topics it 's best for karma to just throw around cliche `` facts '' that are a few decades old , that are reposted in almost every thread , and that even if valid would have no impact in the debate . 
  having any kind of discussion based on logic and avoiding fallacies is old fashion these days . 
  there 's something different though : that a significant number of people want to be independent . 
  i do n't know if there are any underlying historical reasons ( most probably not ) , but i do n't see why they would change the outcome of any debate either . 
   then that 's not a reason to split a country . 
  why not ? 
  it 's widely known and [ actually proven ] ( http://astonjournals.com/manuscripts/vol2010/assj-2_vol2010.pdf ) that smaller states have better functioning democracies . 
  in fact it 's one of the [ pro-independence arguments ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/03/catalan-independence-spain-flawed-greater-democracy ) that gets exported the most , for those who are not much into the intricacies of the relationship between the different spanish nations . 
  the rest of your post is just a poor tu quoque argument which i 'm going to summarily dismiss . 
  except ... 
  since when is being right-wing a problem ? 
  the problem here is much worse ... 
  though , a smaller voter base would be easier to change than a larger one . 
   sorry , i really do n't understand , would n't aficionados spend their money in completely unrelated ways to animal quality of life ? 
  if a shitton of empresarios suddenly find themselves in dire need of an extra influx of money , it 's not a big stretch to think that they will start doing meat , and this will increase competition . 
  some of them will try to differentiate by presenting themselves as animal-friendly/ecological farms .
