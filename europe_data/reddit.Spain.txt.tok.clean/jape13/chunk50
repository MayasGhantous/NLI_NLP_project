  a minority ruling over a majority is n't that , either . 
  however , systems such as fptp , whose goal seem to be to distort the results as much as possible , i find deplorable to say the least . 
  why not a preferential/transferable system ? 
  why do these systems consistently ignore null votes ? 
  `` not voting '' does n't count , either . 
  what is going to happen if there 's 20 % participation ? 
  absolutely nothing . 
  it 's funny how most voting systems in `` modern western democracies '' are completely absurd , almost designed to ensure you never get to be able to express your interests unless they happen to match the majority 's . 
  fptp , d'hondt , ballotage , ... all seem to have terrible conceptual problems . 
  `` socialists and leftists '' would like to remind you that what you actually need is to _ eat _ , and not necessarily to work ; and that being able to work does not necessarily imply being able to eat . 
  when spain uses twitter-censorship laws passed `` to prevent radical islam from spreading its hate '' in order to jail people who write jokes about fascist dictators . 
  never . 
  seen . 
  single . 
  terrorism . 
  law . 
  repealed . 
  once you lose the right , it will be lost forever . 
  so , they want to take away our precious human rights and we wo n't let them by being first to destroy these very rights ? 
  what 's amazing is that after . . 10 years ? 
  people still can think only of breivik . 
  at this point , since you spent a whopping 60 seconds to read the links i gave and again produced an empty response without pointing out what is the problem with my arguments , i have to assume that you are playing with me , laughing at your keyboard at the fact that it is possible for you to make a random fellow waste time on the www answering your obviously useless questions . 
  so goodbye . 
   this is your claim . 
  now what are you using in order to support such a laughable claim ? 
  are you serious about this , just blissfully unaware , or outright trolling ? 
  do n't you remember this -- http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/02/17/espana/1140189726.html ? 
  who is _ first _ to go running to the supreme court whenever the catalan parliament passes _ anything _ even if it 's something as unrelated to secession as eviction laws http://www.eldiario.es/politica/pah-podemos-erc-recurso-ley_antidesahucios_0_507449723.html , cinema http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/politica/print-531937.shtml , education http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/10/16/barcelona/1255694915.html , energy http://www.eldiario.es/catalunya/politica/tc-codigo-consumo-comercio-cataluna_0_438856641.html ... 
  almost 46 appeals to laws voted by the catalian parliament that pp did not like . 
  and specially that pp did not like , since not even the majority of the spanish parliament agrees with them http://www.europapress.es/economia/laboral-00346/noticia-congreso-exige-retirar-recurso-rajoy-contra-ley-catalana-vivienda-20161018171805.html and most of these appeals ended up being ignored by the supreme court anyway http://www.publico.es/politica/puigdemont-no-ve-rajoy-voluntad.html though for sure the ones where the court failed and ended up in suspended laws did end up getting pp a lot of favor from catalans ... plus everything else that i have mentioned in my previous posts about education , which is , for obvious reasons , my favorite topic . 
  obviously , pp is like , the cavalry when it comes to accepting the _ currently legal _ sovereignty of the catalan parliament _ even without getting into secession stuff _ . 
  big fans . 
   you 're just making shit up like for example ? 
  and after running out of arguments and questions of maturity , we begin launching the vague accusations of `` falseness '' . 
  so clich\u00e9 . 
   you only seem to make false claims like for example ? 
   that have nothing to do with the government actions . 
  ah yes , cause these were not done by the government . 
  just extremely recent ex-members of it , right ? 
   of course i say it 's not as bad as you try to portray it . 
  yes , it 's not as bad . 
  they have [ political adverts where catalan is portrayed as the devil 's tongue ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93hemrrn_4w ) , there are [ audio leaks about our ministry of state tried to lay ruin to the catalan 's health care system ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20160622/402690747904/fernandez-diaz-grabaciones-sistema-sanitario-de-alfonso.html ) , they 're literally trying to roll back almost 2 decades of devolution in education policies by now meddling with the catalan 's attempt at having a primarily-catalan education system ( which , specially in the mayor cities , has not really succeeded that much ) . 
  but no , it 's not as bad as i try to portray it . 
   they literally are the statu quo ( together with psoe ) , with a few reactionary members in there . 
  which is the reason that whenever they rule there is an increase in support for secession ( much more than when corruptg\u00e8ncia rules , for starters ) seriously , do a sanity check on yourself . 
  i can not help but read `` huge numbers '' with trump 's voice . 
  the term collaborationist , last time i read , implies both an internal and external force . 
  i do n't see what did you expect from collaborateurs , to have hungarian-sounding surnames ? 
  the collaborateurs from vichy did n't have french-sounding surnames ? 
  what is the point of this argument ? 
   the same way the people of madrid with all their castillian surnames went through hell to try to stop he guy . 
  that is out of the question , no one even doubts that . 
  the question is : did someone who basically was catholic and spanish-speaking really suffer more than someone who was n't , and had this imposed to them ? 
  can you really argue `` hey it was n't that bad to me , how can these crybabies complain so much about it '' ? 
   the situation is not comparable to vichy france . 
  the only difference i can see is that france was a different country from germany , and that germany did n't try as hard to impose the german culture , just the hum , how to euphemize ... `` work ethic '' and fascist parts . 
  no , i said `` parliament , laws and education system '' in order to paraphrase yourself . 
  so , if you are here saying that pp has absolutely no interest in meddling with catalonia 's education system ( which , for the record , is a law passed by catalonia 's parliament ) , then ... 
  i 'm not even sure in which world you live in . 
  because i believe that 's 1/3 of all the gas they 're throwing to the fire , possibly more . 
  and almost all types of press are hammering daily about it , and pp 's political campaign in my hometown ( which happens to be outside catalonia ) was mostly based on this . 
   the thing is franco 's coup was n't some kind of castillian or `` madrile\u00f1o '' conspiracy `` conspiracy '' ? 
  it was a fucking dictatorship that _ imposed _ his vision of spanish culture and customs ( `` nacional catolicismo '' ) to the rest of the country . 
  what part here is hard to miss ? 
  how can you say for a second that the regions that did not share this culture suffered the most ? 
   in reality they were fascist , carlistas , monarchy supporters and all kinds of anti-republican forces all along the country supporting the guy and his bs . 
  sure you can find collaborationists everywhere , but are you going to argue because of that that e.g. 
  vichy france did n't suffer more than germany from nazism ? 
   also `` literally hitler something something !, 
  ! '' lol franco _ is _ our hitler . 
  there is nothing to `` lol '' about this . 
  we are literally , and yes , literally , discussing about a fascist dictator in ww2 europe who happened to also gas jews and kill a shitton of people . 
  there is no hyperbole here . 
  are you trying to argue , right here , right now , that pp is perfectly content about the status of catalonia 's parliament , laws , and education system , and is not continuously trying to create hate against it ever since rajoy started to become a thing ? 
  please remember i work in education ... 
  this subreddit 's current opinion is that referendums are evil , thanks to brexit . 
  so good luck . 
   that does n't mean it 's the general opinion of a country . 
  an strange argument considering most of this comes from the _ current ruling party _ . 
   franco was just a dickhead to everyone , including his fellow galicians . 
  this is literally like saying `` hitler was a dickhead to everyone , including his fellow austrians '' . 
  i hope the nonsense is clear enough . 
   yes , you separatists act like spoiled children and present yourselves as victims when politically confronted and do n't want to hear this . 
  to put it simply , because some people in spain ( including in catalonia ) , still get angry at the fact that catalonia `` has its own parliament , laws , and education system where catalan is supposed to be the main language '' . 
  including the current ruling party . 
  they 're given almost a daily argument by the ruling party , as if to stir the flames in order in order to distract the attention from something else . 
  now , where i have seen that strategy ? 
  ah yes , the dangers of `` populist '' parties !, 
   breaking the country apart is not a way to solve it . 
  i still ca n't see how it is possible to have a fully federal system when a significant portion does n't want a federation at all and are in fact in favor of more centralization . 
  i think breaking the country apart is right now _ the only way _ to solve it . 
   to allow catalonia to decide over the sovereignity of a country and break its constitution is not democratic at all . 
  it may not be legal , but ... in which way it is not democratic ? 
  you can have democracy without constitutions ... 
   just because you legally ca n't hold a referendum does n't mean you get to ignore the population who prefer the status quo and may be the majority !, 
  the idea is precisely to escape the existing legislation in order to be able to hold a referendum :  the intention in the text is that this part of the legislation would come into effect first in order to be able to hold the referendum . 
  this is more worrying :  and indicates that a majority of votes in favor , no matter how slim , and with no minimum participation level , would ratify the decision and mean that it was binding . 
  but i 'm not sure if there 's any _ really _ fairer way . 
  feel free to post alternative ideas , if you can justify them ... 
  it benefits youtube/spotify/twitch more than the users .
