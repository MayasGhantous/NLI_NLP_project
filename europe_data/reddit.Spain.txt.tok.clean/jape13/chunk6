  after all , they ( supposedly ) own large areas of `` dehesa '' , which puts them at an advantage in this area . 
  and this is without even getting into the ( current ) subsidies ... 
  yes , that 's economic theory . 
  also , i 'm thinking land . 
  he just repeated the above poster 's argument without change . 
  it 's still a false dilemma . 
  i could not find where on the constitution it 's written that in order for a bull or any other animal to make use of those `` dehesas '' it needs to agree to be subjected to barbaric torture . 
  there 's many other options that both fiske-harisson and carnivorousvegan conveniently ignore . 
  wow , did you just take a quote from airplane !, 
  seriously ? 
  you need help . 
  what you need to do is to lookup the debate it was parodying , and from which political position was the guy who used the `` they knew what they were getting into '' argument most . 
  a hint : not left-wing . 
  and , you should know : * bullfighting has `` safety regulations '' too , and i 'm sure they were being followed . 
  * suicide is illegal here . 
  summing it up : if you ever find yourself uttering the phrase `` they knew what they were getting into '' , you should realize that a ) you 're right-wing b ) it 's a small thought leap until you start blaming passengers for an airplane crash : http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=show_mesg&amp;forum=102&amp;topic_id=3156867&amp;mesg_id=3156867, 
  as long as this uncivilized spectacle remains associated with my nationality , then i fully believe _ i _ deserve to be `` spat on '' . 
  it would be one thing if they were accusing spaniards of being pro-savages with a huge majority of spaniards disapproving of bull-fighting . 
  but that is certainly not the case . 
  and it 's one of the reasons i do n't wear the spanish flag on this subreddit . 
  also do n't come talking to me about how country x does this or that . 
  that would be a tu quoque fallacy . 
  maybe nationals of those countries should be ashamed of themselves too . 
  in fact , forget the bulls and the blackjack !, 
   the people who died knew what they got themselves into i hate this argument . 
  even classic old airplane !, 
  made fun of it the way it deserves to be parodied :  they bought their tickets , they knew what they were getting into . 
  i say , let 'em crash https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn0wdjx-wkw, 
  your argument is the usual false dilemma fallacy . 
  we _ could _ spend the resources we waste in bull fighting on improving the quality of life of bulls ( and other animals ) _ without _ having to eventually grotesquely kill them for show . 
  and many other options . 
   do you have glorifying memorials for the officers of auswitz ? 
  we ( sadly ) do in spain , fwiw . 
  except that they 've been always amongst us !, 
  in / r/europe , they are . 
  it 's not funny , actually . 
  i 'm sure that was actually the intent of the law . 
  so that people erroneously think `` privacy is too annoying '' . 
   also less than 10 % of our laws originate from the eu . 
  and i do n't understand why it comes to this . 
  what does this crap mean ? 
  we now treat `` laws '' as quantifiable ? 
  what is that 10 % -- is it sopa ? 
  is it all the `` impopular '' stuff and they 're using the eu as scapegoat as every other eu country ? 
  wait a second . 
  you have 1 in a 100 chance _ to fucking die _ and it 's `` very safe if you go by facts and statistics '' ? 
  just what kind of troll are you ? 
  `` human rights blah blah '' is _ exactly _ the problem with this subreddit . 
  the past decades of history with the mediterranean border completely destroy your little proposal . 
   sorry if i 'm late on replies y' all , this many downvotes made the system think i was a spambot . 
  this says more about the state of this subreddit than the rest of the thread . 
  downvoting is ** not ** to be used if you disagree with the comment . 
  hell , of course , we 're talking about _ kids _ making jokes . 
  i worked at a school at spain and ` kids ' ( around 16 y/o ) also joked about it ( and they were most definitely _ not _ muslim at all ) . 
  there was even a popular joke around about bush losing his `` towers '' in his chess game . 
  kids are kids ... 
  in fact , i am 100 % certain at least one member of at least one political party in brussels also danced after the attacks . 
   systemic , i.e. 
  beyond pp systemic ! = beyond pp . 
  systemic means that all parties participate on it more or less uniformly , and that is certainly _ not the case _ . 
  one might argue that it is systemic because most voters vote for parties where corruption _ is _ systemic ( pp , psoe , corruptg\u00e8ncia -- and please do n't say `` recent scandals '' , since the history of corruptg\u00e8ncia is extremely long , and even the scandals reported last year are anything but `` recent '' -- more like cases from the 2000s that are being stirred by the press in the 2015s for `` reasons '' ) . 
  but a handful cases of corruption after you ignore the bazillions caused by the two major parties hardly means that corruption is `` systemic to all parties '' . 
   podemos are being investigated by the prosecutor . 
  unfortunately , you will probably say that the prosecutor is a tool of the pp . 
  and there in lies the problem , there is no trust in the system as a whole . 
  first , podemos is just one of the minor parties and even if you could prove them to be `` despicable evil '' you 'd still have 10 other parties to chose from . 
  second , being investigated by the prosecutor is necessary if there are allegations . 
  i do n't see why that 's necessarily a source of mistrust of the judicial system . 
  the `` tool of the pp '' that you mention is almost continuously sentencing against members of pp while very few people of the minor parties have ever been actually condemned ( just a few cases in iu ) . 
  third , as i said , an allegation is just that , an allegation , an opinion ... not a fact . 
  sentences , on the other hand , are more than that . 
   podemos , and citudanes just have n't had enough time to be as corrupt . 
  the fact is , by your admission , that they 're not as corrupt as the main parties . 
  and yet despite that you find no reason to encourage others to vote for them . 
  why ? 
  because you feel that they will become as corrupt as the major parties ? 
  why ? 
  your stupid logic makes the corruption problem worse !, 
  you _ need _ to penalize parties that show systematic corruption , and _ encourage _ parties that have little of it . 
  thinking that `` all the parties are equally corrupt '' _ only encourages the currently ruling party _ to do even more evil _ since it will have no repercussions _ . 
  in the meanwhile , you 're not allowing the minor parties to actually prove themselves . 
  you 're already classified all of them as `` systematically corrupt '' . 
  even if all the `` corruption '' you can find is to lie in a $ 1000 scholarship grant application form . 
  and this is the reason i call your logic insane . 
  most probably , the constant bombardment of petty change `` alleged '' corruption cases that the news loves to report of the smaller parties , while hiding that the ruling party is dismembering itself , with most of its executive confirmed to be on the panama papers and the like , is exactly designed to cause this feeling in the general population and thus ensure they continuously vote for the major parties or even worse , does n't vote . 
   given that the laws , and treatment of corruption will continue can you refute the allegations by the newspapers i linked to ? 
  it would be trivial to refute , since they 're just that , allegations , opinions , etc. 
  how many actual confirmed cases do you happen to know for the smaller parties ? 
  and please do n't use the `` police does n't prosecute '' argument since we all know that the current ruling party would _ love _ to put certain elements of the minor parties behind bars , and that their finances are being scrutinized with exaggerated detail . 
   i 'll let you into a little secret : there are lots of countries were none of the parties have corruption . 
  there are none . 
  please let me know of one . 
  remember the metric you 're evaluating the parties against here : not a single _ alleged _ case of corruption . 
  that 's the metric you 're using to evaluate ciutadans and podemos . 
  good luck finding such a idyllic country . 
   it 's a fantasy to believe pp are the end all of corruption . 
  yes , and i 've never said so . 
  but it 's _ insane _ thinking that getting rid of pp will not deal deal a major blow to corruption . 
  and it 's even more insane to think that if the next party is equally corrupt , getting immediately rid of it too will not deal a major blow to corruption either . 
  he was widely known to be almost the most crooked active politician in spain .
