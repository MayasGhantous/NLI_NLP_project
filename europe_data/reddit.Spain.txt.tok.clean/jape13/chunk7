  but the worst part is that they 're `` firing '' him because pp ( his party ) is already in campaign mode . 
  they plan to use this to pp 's advantage despite the fact that for 5 years they 've put one of the most crooked politicians in the entirety of spain in charge of commerce . 
  and the really worst part is that it 'll most probably work . 
  watch their numbers increase in the following polls . 
   unfortunately , no . 
  fortunately , yes . 
  if you 're at this point even trying to compare the `` systemic '' level of corruption of ppsoe ( and corruptverg\u00e8ncia ) with that of the other parties ( podemos , ciutadans , iu , etc. ), 
  you 're plainly insane . 
  the problem obviously is that people _ still _ vote for the major parties . 
  people seem to fail to penalize corruption in this country -- democracy is failing us here . 
  and arguments like yours are to be blamed . 
  if you do n't agree that voting for _ anything _ other than the major parties will definitely improve the corruption situation , then _ you 're also part of the problem _ , because you 're not only actively ensuring the major parties stay in power _ without any repercussion _ , but also preventing the smaller parties from actually having a chance to prove themselves . 
  `` m\u00e1s vale malo conocido que bueno por conocer '' is one of the evils of this country . 
  there was this saying , us police used more bullets to kill a man _ armed only with a rock _ than the bullets the finnish police fired _ during a full 3 years _ . 
  the reason no one can realize that is that politicians _ in every member country _ usually use the `` brussels made me do this !!! '', 
  rhetoric even when they _ actually voted for that _ in the eu parliament . 
  the eu is used as the universal scapegoat to justify all those unpopular policies that politicians would not dare support on their home countries yet they need to push because of e.g. 
  corporate `` friends '' . 
  it 's the same rhetoric that is used by some of the catalonia secessionist parties -- `` spain made us do it ! '', 
  even when they voted for doing that in the spanish parliament . 
  i hate when they do that -- even if i myself lean more on the secessionist side . 
  the net result is that the eu , eventually , will lose all popular support despite its actual positive effects . 
  if you can leave , by definition , you 're not losing any sovereignty . 
  the eu is n't bound by the ttip currently , that is also fact . 
  maybe it 'll be called tisa , if it ever arrives . 
   also the branch of the conservatives that want that would be extremely undermined by losing the referendum so do the greens have any significant representation in the uk parliament these days ? 
  they 're the only ones who have consistently voted against tisa and the like . 
  almost no representation ? 
  thought so . 
  enjoy your `` free trade '' health care . 
  you will have this crap whether you 're in the eu or not , because that is the _ desire _ of the uk parliament . 
  so please do n't use it as an argument against the eu _ since your country is contributing to the problem _ ( as is mine ) . 
   after brexit we would be out of ttip too , which i celebrate . 
  and why do you come to this nonsensical conclusion ? 
  by getting rid of the eu you assume you will get rid of the _ uk _ politicians that are currently voting in favor of ttip in the eu parliament and executive branches ? 
  more likely , by getting out of the eu you will get a much stronger version of ttip since most of the opposition seems to come from central europe and the other nordic countries . 
  but i agree it 's actually better for the uk since that would represent the opinions of their parliament ( and thus , of its citizens ) more closely , even if completely against common sense , as with ttip . 
  and exactly in which eu institution did merkel attempt a coup d'\u00e9tat to impose her decisions in the first place ? 
  solidarity _ to the usa _ ? 
  what about it ? 
  if you can predict the future , what are you doing here ? 
  or that the countries where he could collect that medal are constantly vilified by the western democracies . 
  and technically it is still low . 
  if you read the article we are talking of a 2 % guess at the extreme . 
  funny to see the same arguments in scotland , catalonia anti-secessionist rethoric . 
  `` you 'll lose economic security !, 
  fear !, 
  tremble ! '', 
  for some reason i 'll never figure out venezuela is currently used by the main spanish right-wing parties as their favourite `` axis of evil '' country . 
  yeah , it 's funny , but these types of acts have been kind of one of those stereotypes spaniards have of the french . 
  remember the stories in the 70s-80s about french border agents literally burning down spanish product ( oranges iirc ) just to make spain look bad in eea reports ? 
  if you actually read the link you 'll find out it cites the times as source , and that their meaning of `` siesta '' is the stereotypical one , including photos from _ tourists _ . 
  ignoring the `` siesta '' trash which is just ignorant/mistranslation , here we have a supposed `` conservative '' party ( pp ) doing something that 's actually more socialist than the parties pp refers to as `` communist ah , the populists ... 
  just typical uk tabloid trash . 
  the worst part : the times is actually asking me for money to read this piece of garbage that is so full of century-old incorrect stereotypical trash bullshit my browser cache still smells like crap . 
  i knew that the media situation in the uk was bad , but is it really this bad ? 
   ask any person who is against abortion if they 'd rather have `` only in case of rape '' or `` always '' . 
  they 'll pick the first option . 
  ask any person in favour of abortion if they 'd rather pick `` only in case of rape '' or `` never '' . 
  they will pick the first option . 
  ( ironically , you 're using `` in favor '' or `` against '' abortion yourself . ), 
  what the hell ? 
  how can a pro-life person be satisfied by this fictional middle ground ? 
  `` you 're killing babies ! '', 
  how can a pro-choice person be satisfied by this fictional middle ground ? 
  `` you 're preventing choice ! '', 
  you keep pursuing the example that i myself came with as how the belief that there 's a `` middle ground '' , commonly held by those with no strong opinion on the topic , is constantly being used by politicians to manipulate the ignorant public . 
  it 's not a middle ground . 
  it 's a broken position that is sustained on beliefs and very thin arguments . 
   ask any person who is against abortion if they 'd rather have `` only in case of rape '' or `` always '' . 
  they 'll pick the first option `` ask someone you 're about to kill whether they prefer the fast or the slow death . '', 
  this is a false choice dilemma . 
   again , call it whatever you want . 
  but between the `` never alcohol '' and `` always alcohol '' camps , this is something both prefer than giving what the other wants . 
  no , not really . 
  what use is prohibition only when driving to someone who is in favor of full prohibition ? 
  that 's the `` no alcohol on wednesdays '' example i put above . 
   still , half a budget is better than none . 
  actually , no : it 's wasted money . 
   you keep mentioning the politician 's fallacy . 
  i do n't even think you know what it 's about . 
  : facepalm :  it does look a lot like the second syllogism in the wiki , does n't it ? 
  not really . 
  if you wanted to exemplify a broken syllogism , _ c _ would be `` isis is you '' . 
  : rolleyes :  the problem with your reasoning is that your definition of `` camp '' is so loosely defined , that everyone is both in the same camp as everyone else and in the other camp as well !, 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  my definition of camp is precisely _ too strictly _ defined if anything . 
  if you are for religion , you 're in the `` for religion '' camp . 
  how is that complicated ? 
  what , ca n't you really handle the logic truth that you 're in the same camps as isis for some topics ? 
  are you one of those who ca n't deal with vegans because `` hitler was one '' ? 
   i 'm generally for abortion , but with certain limitations . 
  you are _ allowing _ abortion , period . 
  it 's funny that the topic is so clouded by this point that people fail to realize that . 
   the camp a-camp b style of rhetorics is a war metaphor . 
  it works really well if we in dire circumstances must choose where we belong and what use for this discussion is those who _ do n't have an opinion _ ? 
   just because i have two arms and two legs does n't mean that i 'm in the same camp as donald trump , since we have that in common . 
  you think you 're funny , but logic has no middle ground either . 
  either a or \u00ac a. 
  politics , however , have never been about logic .
