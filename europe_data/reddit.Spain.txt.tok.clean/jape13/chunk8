   to the question : `` are you for or against religion ? 
  '' , as an atheist i 'm not a believer , but i believe in freedom of religion . 
  in that case , that 'll put me in the same camp as isis , since they are religious too . 
  _ that _ is a load of nonsense . 
  what problem do you have if you 're in the same camp as isis in a topic ? 
  you can be for religion , which puts you in the same camp as isis , and for freedom of religion , which does not . 
  what you can not do is be `` middle ground '' in favor of religion ( how ? ), 
  or `` middle ground '' in support of freedom of religion ( how ? ) . 
  you made _ exactly _ the same politician 's fallacy as the above poster . 
  please think logically a bit before answering . 
  in fact , taxation is exactly what i had in mind when saying that `` most '' issues have no middle ground . 
  however , this is hardly frequent . 
  it 's more common to ask for specific projects such as `` i want esa to have budget for a mission to mars . '', 
  or similar , in which case , what use is `` half the budget '' ? 
  and please note that even if there 's a natural gradation , it still does not mean that there 's a middle ground !, 
   that 's the reason there is a certain limit on the amount of alcohol you 're allowed to have in your blood when driving . 
  yes , the _ necessary _ so that your driving ability is not compromised . 
  what use would be a `` middle ground '' here ? 
   abortions can be allowed under various conditions , ranging from `` always '' to `` only in cases of rape '' to `` never '' but that was exactly my example !, 
  how is that a middle ground ? 
  that 's just another position !, 
  so you 're allowing immigration then ... 
  and there you are , with the usual pollitician 's fallacy . 
  campaigning for `` drinking coke '' _ does not mean _ that you have to drink _ nothing else _ . 
  that is one of the type of lies i had in mind when politicians manipulate public opinion and try to create a mythical `` middle ground '' that does not exist in reality . 
  notice that the middle ground that you propose , `` drinking coke and something else '' , is actually exactly what camp b ( aka those who favor drinking coke ) wants . 
  it 's funny that you yourself created an example where the middle ground was an illusion that favored camp coke . 
  if we center on the actual issue of whether we need to _ drink coke _ or _ not drink coke _ , where is the middle ground ? 
  if you _ drink coke at all _ , even a bit , you 've already put yourself into one of the camps . 
  and if you do n't , and instead do e.g. , drink soda , then you 've also position 'd yourself in one of the camps . 
  there 's _ no middle ground _ for most issues . 
  a practical example of how the `` middle ground '' is used to manipulate public opinion is , for example , when the legislative body creates a law allowing ( or banning , depending on your political leaning ) abortion _ for everyone _ no questions asked . 
  there 's a public outcry , and thus they settle `` for the middle ground '' and allow/ban abortion only for +18 people , with father consent , etc. 
  ... which _ is exactly what the legislative body actually wanted to do in the first place _ . 
  the `` middle ground '' is , most of the time , an _ illusion _ . 
  it does not exist if you think of it rationally . 
  how do you define the middle ground ? 
  you do a on mondays , wednesdays and fridays and \u00ac a on tuesdays , thursdays and weekends ? 
  generally , the people who use the `` middle ground '' , `` centrist '' , etc. 
  arguments are just carefully moving the overton window right to where they want it . 
  watch carefully for their full discourse . 
  and that 's the history of / r/europe . 
  everyone with half a brain has quit . 
  the few that remain ( and specially those that enter threads like this one , like me ) just want to troll by this point . 
  two articles from politico.eu in a day ? 
   authorities ca n't do that because we have a ton of privacy protections legally . 
  and not only privacy protections , but also the fact that you still can not read a person 's thoughts . 
  good luck trying to catch teams of 2 or 3 people ( or even 1 !, 
  ) , as they become relatively more common since ` organized ' larger terrorist bands are on a downwards trend and mostly gone . 
  what 's less privacy going to do against a lone gunman ? 
  virtually , the only true defense is that [ it is actually harder than it sounds to damage anything other than yourself ] ( https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/11/beyond_security.html ) . 
  but but but molenbeek !, 
   i think you are letting the media and being a new-ish parent mess with your head . 
  funnily , when someone says the same about brussels ... 
  it 's hard to say from the picture , but if we look at the [ sources ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?query=bookmark_ds-055296_qid_-28e8cee9_uid_-3f171eb0&amp;layout=time,c,x,0;citizen,l,y,0;sex,l,z,0;unit,l,z,1;age,l,z,2;asyl_app,l,z,3;geo,l,z,4;indicators,c,z,5;&amp;zselection=ds-055296asyl_app,asy_app;ds-055296unit,per;ds-055296geo,total;ds-055296indicators,obs_flag;ds-055296age,total;ds-055296sex,t;&amp;rankname1=age_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname2=indicators_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname3=asyl-app_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname4=sex_1_2_0_0&amp;rankname5=unit_1_2_0_0&amp;rankname6=geo_1_2_0_1&amp;rankname7=time_1_0_0_0&amp;rankname8=citizen_1_2_0_1&amp;sortr=asc_1&amp;sortc=asc_-1_first&amp;rstp=&amp;cstp=&amp;rdch=&amp;cdch=&amp;rdm=true&amp;cdm=true&amp;footnes=false&amp;empty=false&amp;wai=false&amp;time_mode=none&amp;time_most_recent=false&amp;lang=en&amp;cfo=%23%23%23%2c%23%23%23.%23%23%23 ) ... just this past month , there were 75,365 asylum applications to the eu , of which 34,845 ( 46 % ) were from syria , 10,555 from iraq ( 14 % ) , 8,195 from afghanistan ( 11 % ) , 1905 from iran ( 3 % ) , ... 
  so technically , it is true , for both definitions of majority . 
  with margin to spare if afghans and iran are included . 
   as i wrote in another comment , in certain countries , in certain very specific situations , relatively long preventive detention is a possibility for suspects . 
  and just to see how terrible this is , look at your neighbor country . 
  to sum it up very quickly , the law allows for a `` suspected '' terrorist to be detained for _ no reason _ up to 3 weeks . 
  during this time , the suspect has no right to know what he is being accused of , or if he is at all . 
  he has no right to legal counsel ( no lawyer for you ! ), 
  or any other type of external communication whatsoever ( no phone call to family , no internet , nothing ) . 
  after the 3 weeks are over , a judge may even call for additional `` preventive '' prison time . 
  officially , this may only be invoked in cases where there is a `` proven '' membership to an `` armed group '' with the goal of `` disturbing constitutional order '' . 
  in practice : * it 's been used to detain lawyers of eta terrorists long enough to ensure they would _ miss _ their own trials !, 
  http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/2344497/0/guardia-civil/detenciones-abogados/frente-carceles-eta/ ( spanish ) * `` problematic '' trade union members because they `` broke a security camera '' http://www.europapress.es/noticia.aspx?cod=20070219163720&amp;ch=294 ( spanish ) * a newspaper had all of its journalists `` detained '' until their newspaper went under : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/egunkaria . 
  all of them were later found not guilty in court . 
  rumors of torture . 
  * having a `` funny '' hairstyle https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/caso_4f ( spanish ) . 
  yes , this happened . 
  poor girl suicided right after she got out of prison . 
  there 's even a documentary series about it : https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ciutat_morta ( spanish ) . 
  * pgp users ( off-the-shelf cryptographic software ) https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/01/security-not-crime-unless-youre-anarchist put yourself on their shoes : you 're using pgp and suddenly swat team rushes in , puts bag on your head , throws you into prison . 
  they do n't tell you what you 're being detained for . 
  they do n't tell your lawyer . 
  in fact , they do n't let you contact your lawyer or anyone else . 
  weeks start passing by ... 
  this is not science fiction . 
  this _ has happened _ on this country in the 21st century . 
   update : source https://muslimstatistics.wordpress.com   that 's not a hateful thing to say , just the truth . 
  how come you call the `` truth '' a pamphlet whose main source for the first article is literally whisper ( `` police rumors '' ) , whose secondary sources are interpolations from decade old polls whose own authors have said not to use the data for that interpretation ( which the article itself refers as a `` coverup '' ) , whose title is clearly chosen to send a broken message ( `` 100 % of rapes commited by less than 1 % of the population !, 
  '' ) , even if we assume that the data is true , and whose assumptions are completely thrown away by a single counterexample -- france -- right in the comments ? 
  show all the data you want and we can discuss it , but stop calling random musings the `` truth '' . 
  not really . 
  if you 're talking about youth unemployment , all that does is delay the average patterning age ; people have children later in life ( late 30s is not rare ) . 
   how do spanish people deal with their small children ? 
  one word : grandmas . 
  ( sigh ) . 
   think not that i am come to send peace on earth : i came not to send peace , but a sword . 
  please read your bible again before you come to the conclusion that he is advocating to turn the sword on your relatives . 
  gandhi is well-know to have said that it is better to be violent than to do nothing , i.e. 
  he 's never encouraged `` to roll over and die '' as someone above put , but that 's too much for this conversation already . 
  certainly , i never doubted that . 
  in fact , to quote a rather poor movie that had a similar ideology , `` the only winning move is not to play '' . 
  that is at the core of pacifist ideology . 
  consider that the objective of the people that follow that strategy is to avoid killing others , not `` winning games '' . 
  it 's hard to argue that `` not killing anyone , period '' is a bad strategy for that . 
  if you had to kill anyone to win , it was not a victory . 
   you have no idea of gandhi , nor satyagraha of course not .
