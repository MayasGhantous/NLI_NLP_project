  you expect me to become an expert from a medium-sized wikipedia article ? 
   avoid any direct response to the original context ???? 
   keep diverting to what topic i 've been diverting ???? 
   using elitist words and arguments . 
  `` elitist words '' ?????? 
  elitist arguments ?????? 
   there is no way to show something to someone who does n't want to open their eyes . 
  you 've not really even _ tried _ to show anything . 
  you just mention that `` ideology taken too far is harmful '' , a statement that is completely irrelevant , but also false , as i 've shown using plain logic . 
  then , you 've started linking to a pretty generic article about gandhi without specifically quoting _ anything _ . 
  then , you 've asked me if i agreed to gandhi 's view on jews , which i 've answered , despite the fact that it had nothing to do on the discussion . 
  you 've then started with spiritualism -- `` the answer is in front of your eyes '' -- again without actually quoting anything . 
  mentioned that my words were `` poetical '' . 
  i do n't understand if your command of english is limited or what , but my words are _ hardly _ `` poetical '' . 
  and then you go on with spiritual remarks about needing to `` open my eyes '' , which is something _ i _ would actually refer as `` poetical '' . 
  well , certainly it 's been a waste of time so far . 
  i still do n't get quite sure what 's your point here , so i 'll have to guess : - do you want to prove that gandhi was a bastard in some other topic ? 
  like , he killed ants for fun on his free time ? 
  he tortured woman ? 
  he did n't eat meat ? 
  what would that serve ? 
  would that change the argument in the slightest ? 
  - do you want to show that gandhi violated his own ideology sometimes ? 
  well , i 'd like to know about that , out of curiosity . 
  but . . what would that serve ? 
  would that change the argument in the slightest ? 
  - do you want to show that gandhi correctly following his own ideology eventually resulted in more harm ? 
  and you do that by showing an example -- israel -- where his ideology was not followed and resulted in a _ still ongoing _ war ? 
  what an interesting choice of example ... - something else ? 
  and how is that `` taking an ideology '' too far ? 
  that 's just _ taking the ideology _ , period . 
  if he said that `` yes , there 's an exception , you can kill people if _ a _ '' then he _ would not be taking his own ideology _ , which he defined as `` there 's no possible reason to kill someone '' . 
  basic logic ... 
   but his philosophy is you never use violence against violence . 
  if someone attacks you or your country , you allow yourself to get attacked yes , and ? 
   if you still want to continue the discussion , then first respond whether whatever his views were on jews/brits is right , and then let 's talk . 
  this is a textbook example of the most stupid argument ever . 
  to put on analogy : before discussing on the merits of dna , i need to respond on the views of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james_watson on eugenics ? 
  did they teach you philosophy at school ? 
  are you trying to discredit a man in order to discredit an argument ? 
  as for the small part that wikipedia mentions , i actually agree :  the jews should disclaim any intention of realizing their aspiration _ under the protection of arms _ and should rely wholly on the goodwill of arabs . 
  _ no exception _ can possibly be taken [ ... ] . 
  to think that there 's an exception and that thus their will can be enforced _ by the power of arms _ would be an example of double-think and a violation of his own ideology . 
   taken too far , it will end up being harmful what does it mean to `` take an ideology '' too far ? 
  are you assuming that there exists a `` mythical '' middle point at the `` center '' of all the ideologies and that you can place yourself ideologically there ? 
  there 's no way to take on a ideology `` mid way '' ; by definition , you would n't be taking it . 
  and certainly , a `` do no harm '' ideology will not _ cause _ any harm if you actually take it ... 
  and do i think that 's a point of pride , or rather a symptom of what goes on here , since i said i 'm anti-christianity ? 
  this subreddit was like that before it had its `` eternal september '' . 
  did i suggest otherwise ? 
  by the way you suck at trolling . 
  if you want to follow me around replying to every comment i post ( 10 replies in the last hour ) at least think of better arguments . 
   you think i 'm religious ? 
   anyway , nice to be a `` good christian '' hiding behind a military and police and border countries and military allies consisting of `` bad christians '' . 
  most of this subreddit definitely _ is _ , as other discussions i 've had shown . 
  good for you , if you are n't . 
  i wo n't have to discredit angels flying to the heavens in unicorns and the like . 
  but i hope you realize the amount of double-think in here . 
  oh i can think of many scenarios of that , yes . 
  i can not think of any where a small group of people in power kept a much larger number subjugated , without the support or at least the indifference of those subjugated . 
  and my premise , before you forget , is that it is hard to be indifferent once your government starts literally killing the rest of the world . 
  drones may change the picture though , and that scares me , which is the reason i 'm mostly against that . 
   unless you 're suggesting a sit-in at the reischtag would 've sorted it out . 
  do you think it would n't ? 
  what does the nazi party do once they start needing to kill his own countrymen in order to do anything ? 
  find themselves another `` aryan race '' to upbring ? 
  you 're really suggesting that nazis kept in power all by themselves ? 
  that they had no support of a -- deceived -- german population ? 
  that if a significant part of the country turns on its government you can still wage war not to mention wage war with the rest of europe ? 
  i mean , do you even know any history ? 
   hey , you were the one referring to the '' ** early ** 20th century '' . 
   what are the german population going to do once they control all of europe ? 
  is this bait ? 
  once they 're _ killing _ the rest of europe ? 
  what do you think they 'll do ? 
  or you 're one of those who argues that the majority of germany knew what the nazis we 're up to ? 
  there 's a shitton of people that want to rule . 
  there 's a a lot less people that want to rule over nothing but corpses . 
  hell yes . 
  but to win they would have needed to literally _ kill _ most of the world 's population . 
  good luck hiding that from the german population ( since you invoked godwin , i 'm going to do so too ) . 
   fighting an obviously evil thing is sometimes the right thing to do . 
  hopefully you will understand that at some point . 
  no : it 's the _ easy _ and coward solution . 
   being eradicated means you 've failed at the one thing humanity is objectively designed to do : propagate , reproduce and survive . 
  confirmed : you 're an animal , nothing else . 
  no better than them . 
  here 's the thing : ** i would prefer to die than to live on this world of yours ** . 
  if all you want to do is to fuck and kill feel free to inherit the earth . 
  oh they 're all gone . 
  okay . 
  and why do you think that is a problem ? 
  for someone who prefers to die than to have blood on their hands , if anything , that says something of those who killed them . 
  this subreddit is filled with more and more hate everyday . 
  whatever happened to the `` i 'm willing to die before killing anyone else '' ideals ? 
  did they turn into `` i 'm willing to send soldiers into a warzone to die from the comfort of my sofa '' ? 
  and the worst part is that those of us who do not advocate a war-mongering solution are called `` leftist cowards '' . 
  guess who are the real cowards . 
  calling for violence is _ the easy answer _ , you morons . 
  do n't you think that i 'm filled with rage everytime some lunatic kills tens of people ?
