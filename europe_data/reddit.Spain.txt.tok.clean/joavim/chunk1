argument from authority . 
  in my experience , that is something everybody says about their own country and in no way restricted to spain . 
  i see , there 's a typo in that `` being '' should read `` begin '' . 
  your argument is a subjective opinion . 
  the system in italy and a majority of european countries is built so that the people elect the legislative , who then appoint and control the executive . 
  you seem to favour a system where the executive is directly elected . 
  there are good arguments in favour of that view , but also many against it , and acting as if your position was the indisputably true one is not going to promote dialogue on this issue . 
   seriously ? 
  `` ma'am '' . 
  better ? 
   no , i understood perfectly : you made a pedantic point about the letter of law , and i pointed out to you that you are wrong both on the letter of the law and on the practice of the law , which is indeed relevant . 
   not only does the law in italy recognize that the legitimacy of a pm is rooted in the parliamentary elections , but the practice of elections in italy has been so during our second republic . 
  democratic legitimacy does n't being and end with what is technically legally possible . 
  once again , the law in italy in this respect is not different from the law in countries like the uk , germany , spain , the netherlands , etc. 
  all italian prime ministers you mentioned have derived their legitimacy from the democratically elected parliament . 
  by your logic , gordon brown was not a legitimate british prime minister . 
   democratic legitimacy does n't being and end with what is technically legally possible . 
  i do n't understand this sentence . 
  there 's catalan too , and i 'm fluent in italian , though i 'm not proficient in it since i never learnt it properly , only through being in italy often . 
  it 's not very common , but spanish and catalan are my native languages , and i studied english and german and became a professional translator . 
  having family in italy , i picked up italian as well ( not too hard ) . 
   which you keep assuming you know sufficiently well , which is very wrong and very arrogant of you * i * am the one assuming stuff ? 
  i know too well what i know , but you , sir , do not know me . 
  you are the one assuming i know nothing about your country . 
  that is not true . 
  i happen to be in milan right now , as i am very often , since i have family here . 
  but that is irrelevant . 
  facts stand irrespective of who states them . 
   it has n't been so in practice , nor has it been so in law , law which has come to recognize that parties must declare their pm candidates and programs of government during the elections . 
  so of course the possibility of a government that was n't the one intended by the voters remains , but it 's legitimacy has n't been substantial since 1998 at the latest . 
  you can have a caretaker government , sure , you can rule with a majority born out of unthinkable compromise , but you ca n't claim that you have been given a mandate to be more than a caretaker . 
  whereas , on the other hand , all three of the unelected governments have done far more , enacting vast sweeping reforms of our state , even constitutional reforms , without the electorate being much consulted on it . 
  this is why they have no democratic legitimacy under both the laws and the political practices of italy , and why it 's decidedly not `` our fault '' that they 've been as shitty as they were . 
  you misunderstood what i was talking about . 
  i am referring to the fact that italy uses a parliamentary system , meaning the executive power ( which , unlike in presidential systems , is not directly elected by the people in universal suffrage ) derives its power from the legislative ( which is ) . 
  the prime minister of italy is appointed by the president and * must be confirmed by the parliament * . 
  to say that the prime ministers of italy have no democratic legitimacy under italian law is to show a profound lack of knowledge as to what the law in italy is . 
  if you think your governments were n't elected , you do n't understand how parliamentary democracies work . 
  did you ... did you just say hans eisler was a better composer than haydn ? 
  i was . 
   of course , we have only our terrible governments to thank for this situation . 
  was expecting this . 
  southern european countries will never get out of the mess they 've put themselves in unless people start accepting their own responsibility . 
  the goverments are shockingly incompetent , but the government is n't made up of an alien race of middle-aged men and women brought into southern europe ready to take control of a ministry . 
  politicians are people , born and raised in the same society as everybody else . 
  many of those who give all blame to the government are the ones who go to great lengths to evade taxes or took mortgages they knew they could n't pay . 
   but this generation has more uneducated people than previous ones blatantly false . 
  i really do n't see the problem . 
  i 'm in my late 20s and have a good , stable and well-paying job in my field . 
  i 'm in germany . 
  joke 's on them . 
  i do n't fold my underwear . 
  what did haydn do wrong ? 
  he died almost 70 years before germany was created as a state . 
  he just composed a wonderful string quartet and decades later people used the music for the current german anthem . 
  but the day of german unity was last friday , october 3rd , because on october 3rd 1990 germany reunited , right ? 
  pique never really fit in the pp . 
  you could just see he was n't really a true conservative bigot at heart and he struggled to justify his party 's absurd views and actions . 
  you had a very patriotic girlfriend . 
  most people would n't care about that stuff . 
  it 's not very well-known in spain . 
  it 's interesting , but as our fellow redditor said it does n't make sense , since the `` s '' is not lisped in spain , and people with a lisp defect can not say the `` s '' sound . 
  i 'm not pissed off by any of the two ... educated latin american spanish sounds better than educated european spanish . 
  and spaniards * are * lazy fucks . 
  brilliant . 
  i agree with you that if the us does n't win one soon it 's going to start to get boring , but bear in mind they did win in 2008 and only just miraculously lost in 2012 . 
  i love watching the ryder cup . 
  i had lots of fun this weekend . 
  now i have tons of stuff i need to do for tomorrow ... 
  this has to to with phonetics . 
  interestingly , it 's the same case with dutch/german . 
  dutch people can understand spoken german pretty well even when they have n't studied it properly , but germans have trouble understanding spoken dutch . 
  also , dutch people speak english much better than germans , partly due to subtitling/dubbing . 
  in their defense , dutch is much more closely related to english than spanish is . 
  nobody is denying that germany is an economic powerweight . 
  what some are saying is that germans tend to be all too proud of that , while ignoring or underplaying the benefit they draw from being the biggest and most populous economy in a common market and within a currency area . 
  they ( you ) are too quick to take credit for things like bailing out greece , passing it as a purely altruistic endeavour , while not mentioning the impact that a greek default would have on german banks and , more importantly , the potentially catastrophic message it would send to the market . 
  if greece can be forced to default , who 's next ? 
  not to mention the real nature of that `` help '' . 
  greeks themselves are in the worst situation they 've been in decades . 
  a huge part of the blame is theirs to bear , but the severe austerity measures imposed by germany et al. 
  are also critically responsible . 
  no doubt germans are one of the most europeanist countries in europe . 
  part of that is certainly sincere commitment to the idea of europe . 
  but a big part of it , much bigger than you make it to be , is due to pure commercial , political and economic self-interested reasons . 
   germany alone carries more than a fifth of the eu gdp . 
  it 's a fact . 
  and if i ca n't be proud of that , frankly , i do n't give a fuck what that makes me . 
  it is an outstanding achievement and since all ** fuckwits like you ** are great at always sabotaging any german attempt at displaying pride at turning a broken country into the strongest and most important economy in the eu , which , again , is a fucking fact , ** you can just jerk your neighbours dick real good ** to keep the circle going . 
   but yeah , just go ahead and ** call us arrogant or nazis ** , really feels great to see how compassionate you are . 
  i am fucking through with this topic , ** call me when you got your bachelor 's in political sciences ** or something . 
  insults , personal attacks , strawman arguments , arguments from authority ... congratulations . 
  you 're really helping improve your country 's image . 
  as others have pointed out , you come off as picking the positive bits of your country while conveniently leaving out the not-so-nice ones . 
  there was no need to explain anything . 
  i can tell you that the reason so many southern europeans view germans as arrogant is precisely because of attitudes like the one you showed in your comment . 
  `` we 're so proud of our altruistic contribution to the eu , always willing to lend a helping hand to our friends in times of trouble '' etc. 
  etc. , while ignoring the gigantic self-interested forces that lie behind that `` help '' . 
  you 're just making things worse ... 
  i do n't think that 's the most delusional part .
