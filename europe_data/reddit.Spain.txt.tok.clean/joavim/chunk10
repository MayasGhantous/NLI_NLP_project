   the second largest party headed by a person whose ideal ethnic makeup of the population is 2 % none-danish at most . 
  is that a direct quote ? 
  does n't sound very left-wing to me ... 
  i do n't know why i expected to understand danish politics better after watching * borgen * . 
   venstre 's desire to create a two-tier system for western and non-western immigrants where citizens from countries like the u.s. and australia would n't be subject to the rule seems more possible to succeed . 
  sorry i know i 'm 16 days late ... who would this rule apply to ? 
  americans and australians only ? 
  europeans ? 
  europeans west of the `` iron curtain '' ? 
  europeans north of paris ? 
  sorry , i know i 'm 16 days late ... but who are you referring to when you say `` they '' ? 
  i 'm watching the tv series * borgen * with my girlfriend these days . 
  excellent show !, 
  it means there are some regions that have a lot of devolved power and competences ( basque country , catalonia , navarre ) while others do n't have much autonomy and are largely governed by madrid ( the castiles , murcia , etc. ) . 
  but even the regions with lots of devolved power do not have as much power as the states in true federal countries , like germany or the us . 
  it is n't . 
  it 's decentralized , but not federal . 
  i take it you 're american . 
  many federal states in europe ( germany , belgium ) did not really give their states the option . 
  in the case of germany , it was basically the allies who forced federalism upon them . 
   a federal state only solution to this problem , imho . 
  true federalism , all regions ( or federal states ) get equal amount of competences , whether they want them ( catalonia , basque country ) or not ( castiles , murcia , etc. 
   why should ethnicity or nationality matter at all ? 
  they do n't , in this case . 
  players from any ethnicity or any nationality can play for athletic , as long as they were formed in a basque club academy . 
  i pay 18 euros a month for the tv licence here in germany ( 18 fucking euros every month ) and i * still * have to put up with endless ads on public radio and tv . 
  when you compare it to the situation in other countries , i just do n't get it . 
  my experience as a spaniard : guardia civil : fascist cunts . 
  policia local : hit or miss . 
  some were great , polite and professional . 
  others were corrupt assholes . 
  policia nacional : no complaints . 
  every interaction i 've had with them has been great . 
  only 21 ? 
  how did he die ? 
  it 's about the gateway , but not only . 
  over 10 % of the population in spain are immigrants . 
  are we talking liberal in the european sense ? 
  as in liberal-democrats ? 
  edit : it seems they are , as they are a member of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe group in the european parliament . 
  i do n't understand your comment . 
  are you saying `` non-believer '' and `` atheist '' are two different things ? 
  i think they 're pretty much the same ... an atheist is someone who does n't believe in god . 
  that is , a non-believer . 
  i think the people who wrote the poll options had in mind a radical definition of atheist ( as in `` absolutely certain that there is no god '' ) . 
  `` no affiliation '' is not a good translation of `` no creyente '' . 
  creyente means `` believer '' ( from the verb `` creer '' , to believe ) . 
  no creyente = non-believer . 
  the spanish poll has two options : `` non-believer '' and `` atheist '' , which amount to pretty much the same thing . 
  combined , they make up roughly 25 % of the answers . 
  you 're right . 
  the thing is , `` typisch '' is functioning here not as an adjective , but as an adverb , and does n't therefore modify `` mentalit\u00e4t '' . 
   wonderful how cases allow you to express this without adding additional words , is n't it ? 
  this has nothing to do with cases . 
  `` die typisch britische mentalit\u00e4t '' --  `` typisch '' is here an adverb , and therefore not declined . 
  `` die typische britische mentalit\u00e4t '' --  `` typische '' is here an adjective , and declined ( nominative , feminine ) . 
  although it 's hard to see , `` typisch '' in the first sentence does not in fact refer to `` britisch '' , as you said , but to the verb , which is implicit . 
  this is one of the instances where german is less specific than english . 
  unlike in english , in german there usually are n't any morphological differences between adverbs and adjectives . 
  this becomes clear if we translate both sentences above into english : `` the * typically * british mentality '' ( `` die typisch britische mentalit\u00e4t '' ) `` the * typical * british mentality '' ( `` die typische britische mentalit\u00e4t '' ) source : linguist . 
  makes sense , considering the definition of the adjective * spartan * itself : http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/spartan spartan 1 line breaks : spar | tan pronunciation : / \u02c8sp\u0251\u02d0t ( \u0259 ) n / adjective showing or characterized by austerity or a lack of comfort or luxury : * `` the accommodation was fairly spartan '' *, 
  this is true in some latin american countries , but i 've never heard anyone say anana in spain . 
  do n't know why you 're being downvoted , you 're right . 
  one only needs to look at previous metroscopia survey results and compare them to other polls and to electoral results . 
   this is why podemos and now ciudadanos are getting bigger and bigger every day , no known link to corrupts or big companies . 
  yet . 
  i heard they mistook dublin for belfast . 
  indeed . 
  top-class in the world as far as fighters go . 
  the la metropolitan area also has more people than the republic of ireland . 
  because the constitution prevents him from doing so . 
  clegg would be rivera ( ciudadanos ) . 
  the king does n't get to decide anything . 
  he 's just a mediator at the expense of what the parties decide . 
  he did n't propose a candidate this time because the parties told him they 're not willing to reach an agreement to support any candidate . 
  prime minister . 
  the best term in english is prime minister . 
  i 'm having trouble understanding this graph . 
  does that mean italians are very critical of themselves compared with how others are critical of them , and on the other extreme russians are very complacent with themselves compared with how critical others are of them ? 
  what is the source ? 
  ok i think you have a different understanding of what `` spanish '' means than i do . 
  depends who you ask . 
  that 's the funny bit , they 're not . 
  what ? 
  what other spanish countries ? 
  i love this, 
  at soccer you are, 
  you misunderstood . 
  i do n't get new episodes of house of cards . 
  only sky subscribers get them . 
  netflix customers have to wait almost a year to watch those episodes . 
  amazon prime is even worse in germany at least . 
  the library for the prime subscription is smaller than op 's dick , and many of them are n't offered in hd nor in original version nor with subtitles . 
  it 's laughable . 
  i live in germany and cancelled netflix when i found out they 're selling the rights to the new seasons of house of cards to sky for the first six months . 
  house of cards is a fucking netflix series . 
  they 're producing a show , then selling it to another company * while having their customers pay for their services * . 
  what kind of asshole service is that ? 
   yeah , saw him mention lower down that they made 30k-35k $ a year together . 
  that would be very very low in norway .
