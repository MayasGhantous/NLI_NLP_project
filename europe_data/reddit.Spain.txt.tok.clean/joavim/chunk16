  the gauls were a celtic people . 
  the indigenous people of perpignan , nice , bayonne , strassbourg and dunkirk are very heterogenous . 
  it 's a very complicated topic , and it 's especially complicated in the case of france . 
  the `` native people of france '' , meaning the people indigenous to the areas within metropolitan france ( let 's leave overseas territories out ) are of very heterogeneous origins . 
  they 're celts , basques , catalans , germans , italians , dutch ... 
  not in spain though . 
  it 's `` presidente del gobierno '' ( president of the government ) . 
  it 's not . 
  the chief of government in spain is referred to in english as [ prime minister ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prime_minister_of_spain ) . 
  it 's really not that difficult . 
  basically , the spanish `` presidente del gobierno '' is always [ translated into english as * prime minister * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prime_minister_of_spain ) , which is the standard term for a chief of government in a parliamentary system . 
  translating it as `` president '' like you did is confusing and is thus avoided . 
  barack obama is the president of the united states . 
  francois hollande is the president of france . 
  but mariano rajoy is not the president of spain . 
  he 's the president of the government of spain . 
  another example is italy , where the prime minister is called * presidente del consiglio * ( `` president of the council '' ) , but is also never translated into english as `` president '' . 
   far from the eyes , far from the heart as they say . 
  out of sight , out of mind . 
  disagree about the last sentence . 
  the german fdp , the lib-dems , etc. 
  are socially progressive . 
  beautiful little chorale . 
  he did not . 
  he never incited violence . 
  he did not . 
  he never incited violence . 
  i agree with you . 
  people should not be prosecuted for encouraging violence . 
  i 'm very concerned about the state of freedom of speech in europe these days . 
  this is one issue where the us are ahead of us . 
  what ? 
  gross or after taxes ? 
  i do n't know how it was in france . 
  i suspect spanish people had less trouble there at first , seeing as france is closer to spain linguistically , culturally and ethnically than germany is . 
  it will change because of the different culture of those immigrants , not because of their different ethnicity . 
  take the case of philipp r\u00f6sler , former german minister . 
  he 's ethnically vietnamese , but was adopted as a baby by a german couple . 
  he 's the definition of a german upper-middle-class posh person . 
  yet some people still called him a foreigner ( * ausl\u00e4nder * ) . 
  that is pure racism . 
  that is what i 'm talking about . 
  multiculturalism has to do with culture , not with ethnicity . 
  you 're all over the place . 
  that is not only racist , it 's textbook racism . 
  it is literally what the nazis wanted . 
  and do n't give me the whole `` but they 're not saying one ethnicity is better , they just do n't want anyone of any other ethnicity in their country '' . 
  that crap does n't fool anybody . 
  i was referring to the fact that many people seem to disagree with / u/imjustpassinby 's view that what counts is not whether you are an ethnic german , but whether you share the same core set of values and are willing to integrate . 
  i 'm not a muslim , and i try to live in full compliance with the laws . 
  in fact , i swore to do so when i became a civil servant ( * beamte * ) . 
  i 'm not the one being racist . 
  op 's comment , a criticism of a now deleted full-blown racist comment , is at 0 and tagged as controversial ( many upvotes and downvotes ) . 
  i 'm a spaniard who moved to germany seven years ago . 
  i speak fluent german , work with germans , hang out with my german friends and am about to marry my german girlfriend . 
  i 've done my best to integrate . 
  should i go home now , since i 'm not an ethnic german ? 
  10,5 % , not 15,5 % . 
  i did volunteer work at the `` spanish centre '' ( centro espa\u00f1ol ) , a cultural centre for spanish immigrants who came to the german city where i live in the 1960 's and 1970 's . 
  the people there are those same * gastarbeiter * , now in their 70s and 80s . 
  they tell me stories about how , while most germans were nice to them , some people would call them names ( `` kanaken '' , etc. ), 
  when they first arrived and told them to go back to their countries . 
  where are the second - and third-generation spaniards ? 
  certainly not in that centre . 
  they 're nowhere to be seen because these old men and women who decided to stay in germany set themselves as a goal to get their children integrated into the german society . 
  in my state , they refused to build spanish schools as the state proposed , and sent their kids to extracurricular activities with germans , signed them up for the local german football teams , etc. 
  as a result , their children grew up more german than spanish , married mostly germans and ended up blending with the local population to such an extent that these days they 're only recognisable ( sometimes ) by their spanish-sounding surnames . 
  so allow me to be skeptical at your claim that it 's the fault of the local population when immigrants become radicalised and culture has nothing to do with it . 
  my favourite is `` happy end '' . 
  i was watching a ddr documentary the other day and watched schabowski giving the now legendary press conference . 
  you could see he had no idea what to say when he was asked when the provision would come into effect and he said as far as he knew it was valid right away . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3qvjwzgc2a one of history 's most significant `` oops '' moments . 
  i wondered whether he was still alive . 
  i guess i know now . 
  the us is richer , but also much more unequal . 
  haha you typed it but you have no idea what ppp stands for . 
  their track record is just subpar for a western european country . 
  we 're talking about slovenia , but still no same-sex marriage in sight in switzerland . 
  women got the right to vote in 1971 , and in some cantons as late as the 1990s ... 
  but switzerland is not very socially progressive ... 
  the us is much more religious than spain , that 's for sure . 
  easy : we 're not as catholic as you think . 
  certainly not as much as italy and ireland , for instance . 
  [ eurobarometer poll 2010 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_europe#eurobarometer_poll_2010 ) : `` do you believe there is a god ? '', 
  italy : 74 % ireland : 70 % spain : 59 %, 
  what you are advocating for is called tyranny of the majority . 
  no it does n't . 
  stop pretending concepts do n't change and evolve . 
  i remember my grandmother used to admonish my father when he went to work on sunday to earn a little more money and weekend bonuses . 
  she stopped short of killing him , but she was a very devout catholic and she did n't like him working on the day of the lord . 
  i think it 's safe to say our concept of sunday has changed in that regard at the very least . 
  and so has the concept of marriage . 
  marriage used to be for life . 
  it is n't any more . 
  has the concept of marriage disappeared because of that change ? 
  no , and it will not disappear because gays are allowed to marry . 
  fine then . 
  let 's not redefine or modify what we inherited from organised religion . 
  i 'd like a first row ticket for the adulterer stoning please . 
  and i hope you do n't mind i killed my neighbour who was mowing the lawn on sunday .
