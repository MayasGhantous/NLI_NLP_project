  there 's always portugal . 
  in your example , it does . 
  * precisely * is n't used in english to mean what * precisamente * means in your sentence . 
  but that 's not the way you use the word in english . 
  you wanted to say : `` catalunya en estos momentos no es el mejor ejemplo de eso precisamente ... '' a more idiomatic way of saying that in english could be : `` catalonia is not exactly the best example of that right now ... '' no native speaker would use the word `` precisely '' there to mean what you intended it to mean . 
  perhaps some native speakers will comment on it . 
   precisely not the way that word is used in english . 
  1996 was not 2015, 
  think of the supreme court . 
  that should make the choice obvious . 
  predictions , not previsions . 
  japan ? 
  lol . 
  the nikkei is now lower than it was in 1989 . 
  where the hell are you getting this from ? 
  betting markets gave remain a 90 % chance yesterday . 
  betfair was paying leave at 10/1 . 
  not a chance . 
  this was inevitable . 
  we have reached a point where things have to get much worse for them to get better . 
  which is inherent to technocracy, 
  spain will want to bargain the shit out of that . 
  galicia 's regional identity is not as strong as you think . 
  it 's not comparable to basque country or catalonia . 
  maybe not everybody thinks like you want them to think . 
  that is what eurovision is all about . 
  might be . 
  i 'm 185cm , but older people are noticeably shorter . 
  then again , the same is true in many countries . 
  what ? 
  what ? 
  what 's with spain ? 
  i would n't be surprised if people in southern areas are shorter than in northern areas ( basque country , navarra , catalonia , etc. 
  you mean you 're from groningen , italy . 
  the brand new hbo series : it 's always sunny in faro wait . 
  it actually is . 
  random chile, 
  if you do n't know the word , just make them up :d, 
  i do n't think i did . 
  oh , i did n't even think of the meaning `` to cover '' . 
  maybe '' \u00fcberleben '' would be a better example . 
  that is a form of what linguists call hypercorrection and is very common with speakers of languages that lack progressive tenses like , wait for it , german . 
  not quite . 
  german is osv ( object-subject-verb ) in subordinate clauses , but svo ( subject-verb-object ) in main clauses . 
  it 's a good rule of thumb , but it 's not infallible . 
  '' \u00dcber '' is itself a word , but we do n't say `` ich lege es mir \u00fcber '' nor `` ich habe es mir \u00fcbergelegt '' . 
  the difference is morphological , not grammatical . 
  that is , english just happens to write phrasal verbs as two words , while german writes them together . 
  prime minister is the better term in english . 
  they could all just come back to mama . 
  cherry-pickingtm , religion 's modus operandi . 
  slavery is upheld and justified in the new testament . 
  only to regain popularity 200 years later . 
  paine was way ahead of his time . 
  that graph is a mess , and it 's just an opinion . 
  you keep using it as if it was some sort of authority . 
  explain to me how a party can be socially progressive only for the rich . 
  the fdp supports gay rights , decriminalisation of drugs , etc. 
  for everyone , not just for rich gays . 
  i agree that libertarians and classical liberal parties like the fdp are more likely to coalesce with conservative parties , because the differences on social policy are less all-encompassing and more easy to overcome than economic differences . 
  libertarians , however , are known to be socially liberal in the us . 
  i 'm sorry , what ? 
  how is the fdp to the right of the cdu and the afd ? 
  they 're pro-free market which is usually seen as a right-wing position , but as a classical liberal party , they 're socially progressive and definitely to the left of those two parties . 
  fdp on the whole is a centrist party . 
  i do n't know that it 's more popular in spain than in italy or portugal . 
  besides , watching is n't the same as playing . 
  she will . 
  for real . 
  people do n't learn ... 
  much , much bigger . 
  hey , i managed to combine sexism and disdain for vegetarians in one uncalled for sentence !, 
  are n't i brave , guys ? 
  what ? 
  the us has nationwide same-sex marriage with full adoption rights . 
  fdp they 're sorely needed in the german parliament . 
  they expelled h\u00f6cke last week . 
  and he will . 
  it 's going to be fillon vs le pen in the second round , and le pen will win in that case . 
  if you 're going to stay in the country indefinitely , you should strive to integrate , and learning the language is the first fundamental step . 
  not true . 
  his chances on the different betting markets and prediction markets hovered around 20 % -30 % , and on election day were 15 % . 
  le pen ' s chances are now already over 30 % . 
  for what reasons ? 
  more like not willing , or able , to integrate in the german workplace and society . 
  which is the least that should be required of any immigrant . 
  you do n't know that le pen wo n't win . 
  why not both ? 
  you do n't have to vote for le pen if you bet on her winning . 
  for now . 
  my god . 
  you really believe that do n't you ? 
  do you have any proof of the contrary ? 
  we 'll have to wait until election day and see who 's right .
