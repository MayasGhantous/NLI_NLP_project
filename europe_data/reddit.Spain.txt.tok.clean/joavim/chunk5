  i 'm going to comment on this submission . 
  later . 
  an ikea piece of furniture . 
  hmm pure aircraft carriers are n't designed for relief efforts . 
  some modern warships like the spanish [ l61 juan carlos i ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_ship_juan_carlos_i_ ( l61 ) ) are indeed designed with multipurpose capability in mind . 
  he has none . 
  he was too busy plotting a coup to oust his party friend . 
   janoekovytsj took me a while to figure out who you were referring to . 
  * speciesist, 
  it 's good . 
  the men are nice , the women are busty , the rules are to be followed at all times and the beer is legendary . 
  the weather is shit , but i doubt you 'd notice as much as i did . 
  i do n't see what the problem is . 
  i 'm a 27-year-old spaniard and have a good-paying and safe job . 
  i moved to germany . 
  some of us do think animals should n't be killed even for food . 
  wait , what ? 
  so they hit the animals in the head to render them unconscious , then they let them wake up again , * then * they kill them ? 
  how does that make any sense ? 
  well you see otto , i was talking about the widespread implementation of the system in all of europe , which happened post-ww2 . 
  what do you mean ? 
  that is one poor-ass argument ... the countries that are going `` bankrupt '' are greece , portugal , spain , ireland , italy , etc. 
  germany , the netherlands and the scandinavian countries are doing just fine with their socialised health care . 
  besides , it 's not as if the socialised health care system is something new . 
  it 's been there for more than half a century . 
  where do you live ? 
  i live in germany now , and the health care system here is definitely better than in spain , but honestly it 's not that bad . 
  you do know that the families of deceased teachers in germany get a pension right ? 
  do n't know about that . 
  fucking catalans made me pay for an extra yoghurt last time i had surgery . 
   so now i ** only ** have to pay $ 100,000 . 
  christ . 
  i definitely think italy . 
  i 'd never heard of the french version of his name or of his painting . 
  i 'd say we spaniards can make a pretty solid claim as well !, 
  yes . 
  it depicts an episode of the war known in spain as the war of independence and in english as the [ peninsular war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peninsular_war ) , against napoleon 's army . 
  the term `` guerrilla '' , spanish for `` small war '' , was coined in this conflict . 
  goya drew a series of sketches during this war , called [ `` los desastres de la guerra '' ( the disasters of war ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/los_desastres_de_la_guerra ) . 
  nice addition , and from a french person at that !, 
  it 's fine now . 
  you were faster than me . 
  we agreed on las meninas and guernica . 
  i 'd add some dal\u00ed : [ the persistence of memory ] ( http://uploads5.wikipaintings.org/images/salvador-dali/the-persistence-of-memory-1931.jpg ) ( la persistencia de la memoria ) . 
  fyi , the link is broken . 
  [ guernica ] ( http://www.museoreinasofia.es/sites/default/files/obras/de00050.jpg ) , by pablo picasso .

  edit : figured i 'd add something from francisco de goya : [ saturn devouring his son ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/francisco_de_goya%2c_saturno_devorando_a_su_hijo_%281819-1823%29.jpg/220px-francisco_de_goya%2c_saturno_devorando_a_su_hijo_%281819-1823%29.jpg ) ( saturno devorando a un hijo ), 
  he tried that already . 
  spain 's top court told him to fuck off . 
  do n't forget the pensioners also constitute a net loss to the health care system . 
  losing them does n't only have drawbacks . 
  i have a hard time picturing a spanish retiree moving to northern europe . 
  even young people find it hard to leave the warmth for the cold , let alone senior people ... 
  i would n't know . 
  i migrated years ago and live in germany now . 
  the spanish passport has [ pictures of migratory animals ] ( http://estaticos03.elmundo.es/elmundo/imagenes/2011/04/16/portada/1302937548_extras_portada_0.jpg ), 
  have you been to berlin ? 
  the wall is one of germany 's top tourist attractions . 
  `` ich flieg ' nach mallorca morgen '' --  `` major kamorgen ! '', 
  `` bei der generalprobe ... '' --  `` general probe ! '', 
  i 'm afraid there 's been a major misunderstanding here . 
   major * mayor a major is a military officer . 
  not sure if sarcastic or ca n't read ... 
  rule # 1 of europe : thou shall not question the eurovision song contest . 
  straight from the beach , bitch !, 
  the work of the catalan government has certainly played a role in the conservation of catalan , but a rather small one from a historical perspective and one that is often overstated ( due to the recent-time bias ) . 
  catalan was already much more widely spoken in the spanish part of catalonia than in the french part before franco died . 
  it really is shocking to see how different the evolution of catalan has been on both sides of the border . 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_national_transliteration ), 
   janukowicz is that how you spell yanukovych in polish ? 
  looks cool . 
  edit : bitches mine is the [ official latin transliteration of his name . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_national_transliteration ), 
  call me crazy , but i 'd like the european union to be european . 
  while we can split hairs and debate about whether russia , israell , armenia or even turkey are european , talking about morocco , algeria or egypt is taking it too far . 
  egypt ? 
  it is * ok *, 
  can confirm . 
  source : spaniard . 
  went to a sauna in finland and thought i was going to die . 
  haha fair enough . 
   before the spanish govt were refusing their request ? 
  there was no `` before the spanish govt were refusing their request '' . 
  they have refused all along , and have made it clear in very unequivocal terms from the get go . 
  i am convinced that attitude has created more than one independentist . 
  this kind of referenda end up with less affirmative votes than the surveys initially predict ( see quebec ) . 
  and if i know the catalans well , most of them would not like to separate from spain completely . 
   there is the possibility that had the spanish government been more like the uk government from the start , then there would n't such support for an independence movement as there would n't be the extra incentivising factor that people feel like they are fighting repression . 
  i feel like that is indisputable . 
  unlike cameron 's administration , the spanish government is not mature enough to see it has a very good opportunity to hush the catalan independentist movement for quite some time . 
  if they agreed to hold the referendum under the condition that it contained a clear yes ( independent state ) or no ( status quo ) answers , i am convinced the no would win by a comfortable margin . 
  i 'm curious : is your username supposed to be `` whistling '' in catalan ? 
  in that case , there 's an i that should n't be there . 
  wait . 
  are you saying a doctor earns little more than 2000 $ a year ? 
  the accusations were justified . 
  this is blatantly wrong . 
   following your example , english people were saxons during the 7th-11th centuries until isolation and the merger with other cultures such as normans helped create a different identity .
