   actually , even we , in spanish , refer to them as anglosajones when talking about native english . 
  so what ? 
  see above . 
   valencia was probably never catalonia ( the same way the crown of aragon was probably never just `` catalonia and some lands '' ) , but that does not mean valencians do not share some common ethnicity with catalans , and different from castilians or andalusians , for example . 
  just the fact that they , along with balearic people , share some very tightly related languages is proof enough . 
  i 've never said anything to the contrary . 
   another loosely related curiosity i read recently , is that a third of the spanish people has been found to share genetic markers with the people from magreb and the middle east , so the expulsion of islamic and jewish citizens during the reconquista may not have been as thorough as it 's often thought . 
  that 's not as loosely connected as you think , actually . 
  the influence of moorish and sephardic people was much more pronounced in valencia than in more northern areas , which has left traces even in the language ( which is a single language , really ) . 
  not to mention the influx of aragonese settlers and later castilian immigrants . 
  the ethnic roots of people from england are nuanced just like the ethnic roots of people from valencia are . 
   it 's their culture and ancestral origins and since the vast majority of valencians come from catalan settlers , you 're catalan in ethnicity . 
  and its not forced , it 's simply an historical fact . 
  why am i catalan ? 
  why are we not both romans ? 
  wow , spain . 
  looking good . 
   the map is just pointing out that people from valencia share an ethnicity with people from catalonia if it calls valencians catalans , because they share an ethnicity with people from catalonia , why does it differentiate between the english and the germans ? 
   tough the kingom of aragon was basically catalonia wow . 
  and then people wonder why other spaniards say catalans are arrogant ... how can you make such a statement with a straight face ? 
   capital in barcelona wrong . 
  i challenge to show me an independent reliable source stating that . 
  the crown of aragon had no * de jure * capital . 
  the * de facto * capital was in naples for much of the 15th and 16th centuries , and it moved around a lot otherwise , as was common in medieval kingdoms . 
   catalan kings you mean like [ ferdinand i , the catholic ? ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferdinand_ii_of_aragon ) . 
  or [ his father , john ii ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_ii_of_aragon ) ? 
  or [ peter iii ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peter_iii_of_aragon ) ? 
  or [ james i , the conqueror ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james_i_of_aragon ) ? 
  are you just making stuff up ? 
   and the name `` arag\u00f3 '' just being forced upon us by vatican law kind of like the name `` catalan '' being forced upon us by imperialistic catalan independentists like yourself . 
   we are talking about ethnicity , and , valencia was vigorously repopulated by settlers from lleida and it 's surrouding lands , being therefore from catalan ethnicity . 
  wow . 
  all right . 
  so you 're saying that ethnicity is the basis of a people 's identity . 
  does that mean the english are german ? 
  after all , england was populated by settlers from modern-day germany . 
  how what ? 
  i 'm not the one making the positive claim . 
  if you think valencians have been catalans at any point in history , the ownace is on you to produce some supporting evidence . 
  valencia was founded as the kingdom of valencia , a realm of the king of aragon , just like all the other realms he had , including the ones in modern-day catalonia . 
  never in history has valencia been part of catalonia . 
  fellow valencian here . 
  no animosity towards history or catalans either . 
  but valencians are just not catalans and have never been . 
  sweet jesus !, 
  i 'm reading this 18 days late , but just wanted to let you know you have a good nose . 
  in the past weeks , several high-ranking officials within the ruling conservative party have been voicing their opposition to this law , calling for modifications during the parliamentary process . 
  hehe well let 's see whether i was right !, 
  bold prediction !, 
  i 'm now convinced you are a troll . 
  etymology as a noun is uncountable . 
  you ca n't say `` an etymology '' , just like you ca n't say `` a linguistics '' . 
  actually i do n't ... 
  i know what the discipline of etymology is , but what is `` an '' etymology ? 
  do you mean an etymological dictionary ? 
  they most certainly do n't mean the same thing in english . 
  no idea why you posted a quote in latin . 
  no ... gallic is an adjective referring to the gauls , a celtic tribe from modern-day france . 
  i suspect you were trying to say `` gaelic '' . 
  what is an etymology and where can i buy one ? 
  anyway , i 'm a linguist and a native speaker of catalan . 
  the word `` daurat '' is attested in early catalan writings . 
  [ source ] ( http://dcvb.iecat.net/ ), 
  i do n't understand that sentence . 
  lots of hours writing an essay about it at uni . 
  i do n't even know where to start with this comment ... what is `` gallic '' ? 
  and how on earth are welsh ( a celtic language ) and occitan ( a romance language derived from latin ) part of this supposed ... language family ? 
  it makes no sense . 
  you might be right with '' \u00e1ureo '' , but the catalan `` daurat '' is certainly not a learned word . 
  true . 
  as in costa daurada ( the golden coast ) . 
  i moved to germany six years ago , at 21 . 
  i 'm better integrated than most third-generation turkish germans , and i dare say i speak better german than some of them . 
   niveau what, 
  no ... i know baltic languages are indo-european ( i 'm a linguist ) . 
  i was saying the notion that baltic and slavic languages form a single sub-group within indo-european languages is contested . 
  i 'm not op btw . 
  which is what matters in this context . 
  it 's not . 
  you might be referring to the controversial notion that baltic and slavic form one sub-family of languages withing indo-european languages . 
   one , two , three , whour ... that 's how i count when my mother-in-law comes to visit . 
  or , you know , english . 
  likely a tap , not a guttural rendition of `` r '' . 
  so more like the spanish r than the french one . 
  same in spanish . 
  not quite . 
  most polls were saying 51-53 % yes/49 -47 % no , and it was 55-45 . 
  racism is discriminating on the basis of race . 
  it 's as racist to assume a black man is violent as it is to be shocked that an asian person is bad at maths . 
  the regulations you talk about are not based on race , but on nationality . 
  in a few cases , there exist some laws that favour people from a certain race . 
  those laws are indeed racist , as was the us national origins act of 1921 and especially its successor in 1924 . 
  i think that bot has been dead for months . 
  absolute majority in seats is not the same as +50 % of the votes . 
  the publico poll says independentist parties will reach 48.8 % of the votes . 
  the argument is that it would be hypocritical to declare these elections as a referendum for independence , then say you 've won when you have n't got 50 % of the votes . 
  calling it right now : the independentist parties ( junts pel si + cup ) will not get the absolute majority in the elections on the 27th . 
  why should race matter ? 
  quite honestly , i could n't care less about the colour of people 's skin . 
  if you want to talk about culture , society , etc. , i 'm all for it , but this is literally a non-issue , a made-up problem in a world with tonnes of very real and consequential problems .
