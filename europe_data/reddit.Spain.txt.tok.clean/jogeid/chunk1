yeah well , it was a counter-example , i know every country has a dark past ... 
  maybe i 'm a second-generation immigrant with a culture different from the place i was born and want my own country here . 
  your arguments have no consistency ... 
  that 's stupid madrid tale is rubbish . 
  i 'm not from madrid , in fact , i live in south spain . 
  maybe i 'm an immigrant and my neighborhood consists mainly of immigrants like me . 
  do i have the right to self-determination ? 
  yeah , tell that to iran in the fifties or the iraqis in the 2000s !, 
  yeah , they hate us with passion , do n't know why . 
  the most curious thing about this `` sentiment '' is that it has no base . 
  the wars that did happen between our countries ended centuries ago and they continue hating us like zombies without brain ... 
  i seriously do n't understand this attitude . 
  you said that !, 
  exactly , you have refuted your own nationalistic argument , congratulations !, 
  i 'd like to learn your language ... 
  if i had free time : /, 
  so catalonia is a part os spain because they have common history , 
  meanwhile , pujol ( former catalonia pm ) is being investigated for his tax evasion , corruption and other crimes . 
  [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jordi_pujol_i_soley#corruption_scandals ), 
  so , you are against your own constitution is n't it ? 
  learn some history and go back to the ukip subreddit before judging my country . 
  so , if i make a referendum to independence my neighborhood ( or my city ) , it would be ok ? 
  because you say so !, 
  catalonia is an autonomous region , not a `` nation '' . 
  again , this topic ... 
  it is a propaganda act disguised as a ( non-neutral ) consultation . 
  i 've said it in this subreddit that the intent of catalan government ( and ciu , the party that won last elections ) is to increase the confrontation between catalans and the rest of spaniards hoping that catalans forget their multiple corruption scandals . 
  yeah , that justifies this bloodbath ... 
  that 's the war . 
  it 's horrible , seriously horrible . 
  this is huge !, 
  i 've never seen a spanish pm apologizes and acknowledge his party corruption cases . 
  of course , the reason could be a new party that is shaking the foundations of spanish politicis , podemos . 
  well , maybe eu parlament should first determine if a territory is in dispute or not . 
  if there is no case , eu parlament should also give the territory to one of the countries and the other country should agree in this solution . 
  otherwise , see my [ comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2k83fx/cutesygermany_and_the_netherlands_end/clj9s9l ), 
  is a joint control of this territory possible ? 
  i mean , given that both states are in the eu , could n't be some kind on bilateral territorial agreements on disputed territories ? 
  maybe both countries should agree in real and down-to-earth questions like taxes , transports , education and if no agreement is possible , ask the population or the european parlament and let them decide the matter . 
  also , eu parlament would have special powers in this shared-sovereignty territories : police , for example . 
  i think this could be an interesting topic to discuss in european parlament and a good way to resolve this kind of disputes . 
  ah , a year !, 
  not a month !, 
  i can understand they live in the worst possible condition comparing to us , europeans :(, 
  ok , thank you for answering . 
  i am serious . 
  many qualified spanish workers are emigrating to uk , ireland , germany and even sweden because there is no jobs . 
  how in hell immigrants suppose that they are going to find one ? 
  serious question , why do they come to spain if there is no job there for them ? 
  and another one , knowing that crossing the border is ilegal , why do they keep illegally coming to europe ? 
  it is because it is very difficult to immigrate to an eu country legally or what ? 
  meanwhile , on the palestinian side : [ fatah honors jerusalem hit-and-run terrorist ] ( http://www.timesofisrael.com/fatah-honors-jerusalem-hit-and-run-terrorist/ ) it 's sad that it seems that both sides agree in not ending the undeclared war that plagues the old british mandate of palestine . 
  i 'm hoping they make a referendum , exit the eu and stop complaining like children . 
  seriously , recent news about uk and eu make me think politicians are childish and the citizens that eleceted them have really no idea about how countries work . 
  let 's say another stupidity , for example , `` uk citizens are racist '' . 
  there is many hispanophobia indeed . 
  francoist * troops, 
  hahaha , great !, 
  well , your behavior indicates otherwise . 
  do you want to compare both ? 
  spanish empire died at the beginning of xix century , uk has colonies until now . 
  let me remind you of [ internment camps in kenya in 1950s ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mau_mau_uprising#human_rights_abuses_in_british_concentration_camps ) and [ the troubles in ireland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_troubles ) , and many more incidents during xx century . 
  ukip is a ultranationalist and somewhat-racist party that likes to build the mentality of us vs. them . 
  this strategy is similar of what you are making here bringing up again and again gibraltar topic . 
  i think you are the only one troll , bringing up an unrelated topic with african immigration of poor and desperate people searching for a better future . 
  look , your country politicians have been involved in a [ sexual child abuse ] ( http://scgnews.com/the-uk-political-pedophile-ring-scandal-is-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg-the-full-story-is-much-more-d ) since the 1980s , and also you have corruption in many institutions according to your national police , scotland yard [ link ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/the-corruption-of-britain-uks-key-institutions-infiltrated-by-criminals-9052617.html ) . 
  so , we can maybe be in a worst economic situation than uk ( considering that london city is a tax haven and uk colonial past , it could n't be other way ) but you have also your own corruption/criminal problems . 
  and again , and again , gibraltar . 
  gibraltar as nothing to do with african immigration to eu . 
  seriously , go back to / r/ukip and be happy there . 
  thus , we do n't have pure white skin like you all , 
  learn some history , first and stop spreading ukip lies . 
  ceuta and melilla are not colonies , gibraltar is a colony . 
  ceuta and melilla are older than morocco . 
  as we can see here , gibraltar topic is always bring up from british people . 
  are you all so chauvinistic that use any excuse to `` defend '' your country against what you perceive as a menace ? 
  seriously , i do n't understand . 
  we are talking about immigration in the south border of spain ( that happens to be the same south border of the european union ) and you try to talk about gibraltar . 
  a topic that is totally unrelated to african immigration to the eu . 
  what 's the point on bringing gibraltar topic every time spain-related news appear ? 
  from the faqs [ 5 . 
  how can you measure corruption ? 
  ] ( http://www.transparency.org/whoweare/organisation/faqs_on_corruption/9/#measurecorruption ) : * by its nature , corruption is secretive and complex . 
  given that bribes occur illicitly , however , a specific figure can only ever be approximate , and it excludes other corrupt transactions such as the embezzlement of public funds or theft of public assets , or non-monetary bribes such as favours , services and gifts . 
  analyses which focus on the movement of money also ignore the social costs of corruption , which are impossible to quantify . 
  no one knows how much the loss of a talented entrepreneur or an acclaimed scientist costs a country . 
  who can say what social malaise , illiteracy , inadequate medical care or means in economic terms ? 
  over time , however , research has shown us that people 's perceptions offer a reliable estimate of the nature and scope of corruption in a given country . 
  the perceptions of country analysts , business people or the general public form the basis of our corruption indices , the corruption perceptions index and the global corruption barometer . 
  for more information , see our research section . 
  * so , this index is bogus because it is based on ** public perception ** , not in facts like actual sentences . 
  and here we 've got a spanish-hater ukip member !, 
  some differences : - catalans had the same repression that any others had . 
  - there was n't a brutal war against catalans and not-catalans . 
  - catalans were not exterminated ... bosnians were . 
  point taken . 
  honest question : why do n't they divide the country in three smaller nations for bosniaks , serbs and croats as they did for yugoslavia ? 
   the world is also a melting point . 
  conclusion : countries do n't exist . 
  the `` world '' is not a country where people share a common history .
