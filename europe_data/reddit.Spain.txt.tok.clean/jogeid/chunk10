  we are back at the big nations bossing everyone around . 
  and many of the smaller nations will start looking back to america for alliances , instead at the eu . 
  because with americans you know at least where you stand . 
  eu is not broken , it is a common project that needs solutions . 
  accusing other eu countries for being the cause of greece , germany , spain , italy , or whatever country problems is not going to solve nor this country nor eu issues . 
  i do n't know , seriously , you guys did it better . 
  here we are fighting because : - which language should be the second language of eu . 
  - a commemorative coin of a battle fought 200 years ago . 
  - war reparations from wwii . 
  - greece bankruptcy - ukrainians have died for the eu flag and we have completely ignored them ( i see this as the biggest failure ) . 
  and all the ** problems ** come from : - eu has failed to make a joint fiscal policy . 
  - thus , we have failed to make a joint foreign policy ( without a joint forces , of course ) . 
  - using eu as a cow that can be milked anytime we need . 
  - failure to improve real union because some countries defend their own interests . 
  i envy your great nation . 
  in 200 years you have made an unique culture based on integrating other cultures in yours and are a real union . 
  in europe , this is impossible . 
  since the beginning of this crisis the ultra-nationalism , bigotry and old hates of some countries are increasing steadily . 
  we are a failure as makers of a new nation . 
  non-sensical idea . 
  why favoring european integration with measures like erasmus program if you do n't want that we share our culture ? 
  `` russia is not our enemy , but if we continue to believe the story of the bad enemy , violence will increase and the war will come here , in europe , in this square , in italy '' . 
  is current russian government threatening europe ? 
  are they so desperate or delusional ?

  i do n't want a medieval religion that treats women as cattle and forbids homosexuality in my country nor in the eu . 
  why is estonia so obsessed with being `` nordic '' ? 
  usually , `` eastern countries '' are the descendants of the urss . 
  they are eastern people compared to us ( spaniards ) because romania , hungary and poland are east of spain . 
  call me what you like . 
  i 'm a spaniard . 
  if you want to call us southern or atlantean , i do n't give a damn . 
  i 'd love to welcome more romanians , hungarians and polish people in spain . 
  hardwork eastern people are the best . 
  yeah , good luck saying that in 50 years when uk is full of muslims :d, 
  glad to know you 've had a warm welcome in spain ,

  thank to god , spain does not have any matter in south america and you and only you are enough to make that continent what it is today . 
  so you are descendant of conquerors , congratulations you 're a stealer of native-land and killer according to your own arguments . 
  once spanish descendant people were born in colombia , are they spanish or colombian ? 
  because there are many white people nowadays in colombia descendants of what you call `` killers '' . 
  maybe even you have some tainted spanish blood , because you know my ancestors remained in spain while yours are ( at leas in a part ) surely are from spain . 
  is colombia going to return stolen lands to natives ? 
  the whole map is bullshit : - where is the nationalist movement in andalusia ?

  that is the reason why the basque nationalist party does n't fully approves catalan push for independence [ internal war in bnp ] ( http://www.elconfidencialdigital.com/politica/independencia-cataluna-provoca-interna-pnv_0_2573742621.html ) - valencian nationalism has some relevance because the creation of [ comprom\u00eds ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/comprom%c3%ads ) that is a union of several nationalist movements . 
  comprom\u00eds votes in valencian chamber have pushed for a socialist government ending two decades of popular party control . 
  if they continue to challenge the law , the legal insecurity will be increasing and therefore this downgrade .

  secession or more money ? 
  because you know if he wants and independent state , why does he insist in asking for more money ? 
  that 's not true at all .

  why do they propose english as an official language in belgium ? 
  is it spoken there by a majority of population ? 
  is this a way of increasing foreign investment ? 
  let me remember you there were a regional elections , not a plebiscite . 
  in fact you 're right , catalonia is a part of spain , 
  i could n't have said better . 
  good summary . 
  maybe you have no idea about spanish society ... just sayin ', 
  son of immigrants that hate his home country . 
  nothing to see here . 
  i did n't say otherwise . 
  but what i fail to see here is people criticizing corrupt catalan politicians that use the nationalism as a scapegoat of their own corruption .

  ok , catalonia is a paragon of failure . 
  also , your flair title sucks . 
  take note that the answers of the people are real , showing that they are repulsed and offer help for denouncing the hostel owner to police . 
  filmed with hidden camera , two actors disguised as a gay tourist couple ask for help to translate hostel indications to * real * people passing by the streets . 
  every single one of these people have the same reaction . 
  they are repulsed by the homofobic content of the indications and suggest or even offers their help to denounce the hostel owner to police . 
  where is the rule that says a player ca n't yell when hitting ? 
  because you say so , of course . 
  there is no rule against yelling so ... stop spreading lies . 
  being from spain means no allies for me ... - maybe romania could be considered a close friend . 
  - italians are like us but they understand us we do n't understand them . 
  i seriously think spain should improve its foreign relationships ...

  after reading the very controversial discussion created [ in this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2xc0fp/italys_new_lingua_franca/ ) , what are your thoughts of making english ( or any other language ) an official second-language in every country of the eu ? 
  could it be a good gesture to increase communication or would it make the others language die ?
