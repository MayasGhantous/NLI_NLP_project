   catalans and the basques and all other spanish autonomous communities are different than the spanish in general . 
  if you ca n't get that , than there 's no point in even talking to you about this . 
  this is a fallacy . 
  basques , catalans , galicians , valencians , castilians , asturians , etc form spain . 
  each one of them is a part of what we call spain . 
   so unless you do : bye !, 
  bye  you deny the existence of other cultures within spain and instead want one spanish identity . 
  that is nationalist . 
  only in your dreams i said that , you live in a fairy-tale world where every culture is separated from the others . 
  franco has only one policy : him . 
  he was a dictator that attacked anyone that thought anything different than his regime . 
  you are doing the same . 
  your vision of catalans , basques , galicians ... is incomplete because people moves and spain is a melting pot of cultures , traditions and ideas . 
  you , nationalists , fail to understand that . 
  northern ireland is famous for their racism towards other cultures so my comment stands ... 
   el banc d'inversi\u00f3 nord-americ\u00e0 alerta que un eventual estat catal\u00e0 tindria problemes per finan\u00e7ar-se , podria quedar fora de la uni\u00f3 europea i veuria com caixabank i banc sabadell abandonarien catalunya yeah , so morgan stanley says that ( in an hypothetical secession ) catalonia would be out of eu , could have problems when asking for money and the two biggest banks of catalonia would go out catalonia . 
  no , we only read avui :d, 
  so brave !, 
  attacking me for wanting a right for every citizen of a country ... 
  sorry racist !, 
  but you have been spotted clearly , 
  if you can read spanish , [ read this source ] ( http://www.antena3.com/noticias/espana/unidad-antiblanqueo-capitales-liechtenstein-investiga-pujol_2014092900384.html ) , do you like antena3 or only like avui ? 
  racist uncultured bigots . 
  really he did n't know that flag was the eu flag ? 
  education system must be shit in the uk . 
  interesting , and yet some people in spain claims that we spend to much in military expenses . 
  yeah , other parts that have bigger budgets like madrid , that has a fiscal deficit much bigger than yours < / ironic , 
  and ? 
  so , you 're saying ** there is no separation of powers also in catalonia ** ? 
  because everything is part of the same system ... 
  make ad-hominem attacks when desperate !, 
  ah , and `` el mundo '' has changed its director since 11m . 
  no , it 's not . 
  catalonia has their own education system , health services , autonomous police , law courts , tax revenue service and parlament . 
  every catalan citizen has the right and obligation to know and use catalan . 
   the court and spanish government wo n't let go , no matter what , and there 's nothing legal mas can do . 
  the only thing possible would be to step to the un and accuse spain of not giving the catalans a basic human right . 
  that right belongs to all the spanish , `` catalans '' in particular do n't have this right more than one neighborhood of barcelona , one town of extremadura , or one region of spain . 
  ok , i do n't like the choosing of the constitutional court members but does its choosing method invalidate their opinion on this matter ? 
  they are different problems to solve : - change constitutional court members ( no proposals from any party [ including nationalist parties ] ) - constitutional change ( no proposals to allow a self-determination referendum from any party [ again , also including nationalist parties ] ), 
  well , i do n't know , i do n't work for the government , but what i know is that artur mas has only threaten with secession and has not discussed nor proposed any constitutional change . 
  about competences , spain is the most decentralized state of the world [ 1 ] ( http://www.academia.edu/1847753/decentralization_in_spain ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/getting-the-most-out-of-public-sector-decentralisation-in-spain_838564110008 ) [ 3 ] ( http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2fs10258-012-0085-4#page-1 ) . 
  they have their own laws , police , taxes , health services , education , transports and parlament . 
  they have even been defined as `` historical nationality '' but they ask for more self-government when they are practically an state . 
  my opinion is that , given that they have an [ enormous public debt of 60000 million of euros ] ( http://public.tableausoftware.com/profile/patricia4830#!/vizhome/deudapblicajunio/deudapblica ) , and a bigger-than-average government [ corruption ] ( http://en.ria.ru/world/20140929/193428876/liechtenstein-implicates-catalan-president-in-illegal-business.html ) , they want to hide this matters with the `` catalan self-determination referendum '' . 
  stop spreading lies without any proof . 
  downvote squad !!, 
  why ? 
  why the central government when is artur mas and his party the ones that want to secede ? 
  he has to start the discussion and he has not started anything . 
  only demands and threats to the central government and he has been laughing of other spaniards [ here artur mas mocks andalusians and galicians ] ( http://www.vozbcn.com/2011/09/29/87230/rivera-incoherencias-linguisticas-mas/ ), 
  you said that without evidences . 
  no , spain 's democracy is comparable to us , france or german democracy . 
  not to secede an autonomous community from spain ... 
  it 's simple . 
  autonomous communities have not the right to convoque self-determination referenda . 
  nice does not mean legal , i 'm afraid . 
  constitution needs a change to allow this referenda . 
  what about if a part of a autonomous region wants to secede ? 
  what about other regions ? 
  these problems need to be addressed . 
  also i agree with you that the question is obscure and that mas does not want to hold the referendum . 
  i think it is making noise to make people forget its links with pujol in lichtenstein . 
  what change was proposed ? 
  yeah , the us , china , russia and other big players agree with that . 
  each country has its own laws . 
  ok , i redo my question : why ca n't artur mas ( using his party in spanish congress ) propose a constitutional change ? 
  because every downvote come with a flag attached ... 
  according to our current constitution , autonomous regions ( which catalonia is one of them ) does not have self-determination right . 
  this right is only of all the spaniards . 
  constitution needs updating to resolve this matter and nobody ( including nationalist catalan parties ) has proposed a change . 
  the only legal way to do it is changing the constitution to allow this kind of self-determination referendum . 
  read about this topic before you spread more lies . 
  spain : we are not cunts with any other country ... because , we are only cunts with ourselves . 
  it 's illegal according to spanish constitution , what did they expect ? 
  now the great questions : - when is artur mas ( catalan president ) to propose a change on the constitution to allow a self-determination referendum ? 
  remember , nobody has proposed a change in the constitution . 
  - why is he so centered in his own way of declaring the referendum ? 
  - why did n't he discuss his intentions with other forces ? 
  - what is artur mas to answer to corruption allegations in liechtenstein . 
  more info in that possible corruption link between catalan ex-president and current catalan president : - [ liechtenstein implicates catalan president in illegal business after independence call ] ( http://article.wn.com/view/2014/09/29/liechtenstein_implicates_catalan_president_in_illegal_busine/ ) ( english ) - [ liechtenstein ve v\u00ednculos entre artur mas y los negocios ilegales de los pujol ] ( http://noticias.lainformacion.com/espana/liechtenstein-ve-vinculos-entre-artur-mas-y-los-negocios-ilegales-de-los-pujol_rtavwaatkw4ecpxhz4fck1/ ) ( spanish ), 
  also , barcelona gdp is greater than other catalan regions , are you going to let barceloneses make its own state ? 
  it is a nationalist fallacy . 
  madrid is in the center of the country so , it is more logical if the rails pass by this city . 
  this centralization also affects other regions as well . 
  its postponement has been bad for other regions like murcia , comunidad valenciana and andaluc\u00eda . 
  you are not different than the other regions . 
  stop with the manipulation , your region has received more funds than madrid , although the later hosts the capital . 
  maybe they simply were cunts ... 
  my experience is exactly the opposite . 
  i was with catalan friends of a friend ( that was also there ) and they were speaking in catalan ( i do n't understand it but it 's no big deal ) and when one of them switched to spanish to communicate with three of us , the other ones were angry towards her and ** asked her to stop speaking spanish ** ... 
  i was like wtf ? 
  note : we were in south spain , nobody speaks or understands catalan . 
  the same happens in france or the uk and their capitals are not in the geographically center of the country , while in spain , madrid is . 
  i 've given some data , you 're giving us emotional discourse and personal attacks . 
  talk about brainwashing ? 
  i have given some sources , what about yours ? 
  you have only given a \u00a1 n emotional and funny comment . 
  and none has make some proposal por constitution amendment . 
  while you are all demonizing spain ( or its government ) nobody discuss the inclusion in the constitution of new self-determination rights by towns , provinces or autonomous communities ( regions ) .
