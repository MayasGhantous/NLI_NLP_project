  no party has proposed concrete changes in constitution , even the nationalists parties , because they want confrontation between regions and between them and the central government . 
  only psoe has make a timid effort claiming that our constitution has to be changed ( but without explicating in which articles and in what way ) . 
  and you are all talking about economy , rights , etc. . . 
  while in spain we do n't understand this illegal move made by artur mas . 
  on the other side , pnv ( basque nationalist party ) president , \u00cd\u00f1igo urkullu wants a pact to change the constitution and to obtain more self-government in a legal way [ source ] ( http://www.libertaddigital.com/espana/2014-09-26/urkullu-aboga-por-pactos-para-cambiar-la-constitucion-y-tener-mas-soberania-1276529219/ ) . 
  to sum up , i 'm fascinated by many people talking with their hearts about this matter . 
  calling some kind of subjective historical rights or simply hating spain for whatever reasons and supporting a clearly ilegal ( according to our constitution ) referendum . 
   spain 's economy is already bad , without catalonia it would become a very poor country . 
  false . 
  catalonia has an enormous debt ( 60000millions ) and it would have to pay it on its own .

  i do n't understand how they could name a square to thatcher . 
  she was one of the worst pms of the uk leaving many hard working people without a job . 
  i also do n't understand esperanza aguirre and ana botella 's fascination with thatcher ... 
  the same for your :d, 
  good for you for stalking me , you make me feel loved :d, 
  i 'm afraid that is a situation that happens very often : /, 
  well every part will defend their side . 
  keep in mind that from almost 40 years ago , catalans have had their own education system that has been able to distribute its propaganda very well . 
  at first it was not so much , but in the last 10-15 years it has been much worst , making so , do n't believe what a young catalan says because he or she can be brainwashed . 
  examples of brainwashing : - [ the historian sir john elliot says : `` catalan children are learning fake history '' ] ( http://www.lavozlibre.com/noticias/ampliar/656042/el-historiador-john-elliott-los-jovenes-catalanes-aprenden-una-historia-falsa ) - [ aragon denounces that catalan textbooks show a part of aragon as catalan land ] ( http://www.abc.es/local-aragon/20130903/abci-aragon-denuncia-libros-textos-201309031109.html ) ( aragon is other autonomous region next to catalonia ) - [ nationalist indoctrination of catalan children ] ( http://www.periodistadigital.com/cataluna/barcelona/2012/10/13/ebro-adoctrina-romanos-nacionalismo-wert-cataluna-escuelas-nacionalismo-catalana.shtml ) - a [ foro coches thread that contains many real examples of nationalist indoctrination in children catalan textbooks ] ( http://m.forocoches.com/foro/showthread.php?t=2674535 ) - [ how they indoctrinate children ] ( http://www.alertadigital.com/2012/10/17/asi-fomentan-el-separatismo-en-espana-los-libros-de-texto/ ) - [ other article about the matter by a barcelona newspaper ] ( http://www.vozbcn.com/2011/09/09/84937/libros-texto-escuelas-adoctrinamiento/ ) - in this post , [ a law professor denounces history manipulations in his daughter history book ] ( http://jardindehipotesis.blogspot.com.es/2014/05/historia-manipulacion-ignorancia.html ) - [ they have changed its old kingdom to kingdom of catalonia when it really was kingdom of aragon ] ( http://eldia.es/2012-11-29/criterios/14-falso-reino-cataluna.htm ) - [ more propaganda and manipulation ] ( http://www.elconfidencialdigital.com/politica/historia-cataluna-pp-ley-wert_0_2243175672.html ) i understand that you do n't speak spanish , but if you want to take a look to these links , i think your opinion about this problem will change . 
  we could say the same about the [ republic of lakotah ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_lakotah ) , founded on the grounds of a broken treaty by the us [ treaty of fort laramie ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_fort_laramie_ ( 1851 \\ ) ) . 
  so no , i 'm not talking about texas or cascadia . 
  but you are the civilized people , the guardians of the world and we are retards in a backward-ass country of savages that kills bulls and ... nobody expects the spanish inquisition !, 
  so let me understand this , you support entering internal conflicts and taking their land by force . 
  many here in spain think the same . 
  i do n't know . 
  i 'm not a politician , but what i know is that catalan president ( artur mas ) : - he has not proposed any constitutional change . 
  it could have proposed a new article , a modification of one article , talk with government ( which did some accords with its party in 1996 ) , opposition parties like psoe , etc. 
  - he only has asserted that ** they are going to make a referendum without discussion or dialogue with other political parties ( including non-catalan bigger spanish parties ) ** . 
  - he has not offered other options and he is only open for dialogue with nationalists forces . 
  - he is immovable from its political position keep in mind that while the scottish nationalists made a pact with uk gov to make their independence referendum , catalan nationalists have not make any move to legitimate and make legal their referendum . 
  so , my opinion stands . 
  ** i think they are doing it for the show ** . 
  i did n't said that . 
  i 've just said that if you are comparing the situation of a colony to ceuta and melilla , you are simply wrong . 
  but , hey , nobody criticizes the us about being and indivisible country , only the evil spaniards , because they ... are catholics that kill bulls and ** spanish inquisition ** !, 
  and before downvotes come to me , i 'm not anti-independence but if the rules make this independence impossible , maybe we should talk about changing the rules and finding some common ground to discuss this change . 
  one thing that makes me think about catalonia is that making a regional referendum is illegal according to spanish constitution . 
  and the catalan nationalists have not proposed changing the constitution to allow this kind of referendum . 
  concluding , ** they have not make a single serious proposal of constitutional change , they do n't want negotiation , they want only their terms ** . 
  so , my view is that they simply want catalans to forget about corrupt jordi pujol wit his fortune of 1 billion of euros obtained by blackmailing and coaction . 
  sources : [ 1 ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-14/ex-catalan-leader-pujol-hit-by-fraud-influence-trafficking-suit.html ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/20140814/ex-catalan-leader-hit-with-corruption-lawsuit ) . 
  other possible option is asking for more money from the central government . 
  they are always asking more money and treating with independence . 
  edit : thing -  think , has -  have ( i was sleepy :p ), 
  anti-spanish sentiment in this subreddit ... 
  i like to debunk its fallacies . 
  morocco did n't exist when ceuta and melilla were founded . 
  spain did exist when gibraltar was conquered . 
  learn some history and stop repeating bullshit , please . 
  `` rich '' with a public debt of 61 billion euros ... 
  come to spain !, 
  it 's empty !, 
  your `` kind '' seems to forget that your medieval `` spanish shire '' depended on the frankish kingdom . 
  when ? 
  you have never been a nation . 
  care to explain ? 
  what did they expect ? 
  every new eu state must adopt the euro as its currency . 
  uk and denmark are special cases ( do n't know about sweden , i suppose it is also a special case ) . 
  spain does n't have to warn anybody , it is a well known fact . 
   if scotland is not the successor state of uk . 
  it 's a new state applying for membership . 
  that 's going to be the spanish position . 
  it should be that position for any other eu member , indeed . 
  spain is not nervous about anything . 
  stop spreading lies . 
  spain does not recognize unilateral independent countries ( like kosovo ) . 
  it recognizes only bilateral independence agreements ( like montenegro ) . 
  because they tend to have corrupt governments that make the people poorer so they need a common enemy : the `` evil '' spaniards . 
  yeah , in my experience , many people like visiting lisbon and porto or even working there . 
  and portuguese language learning in high school is increasing its number of students each year . 
  family war !, 
  next friday on cinemas !, 
  we only hate rommanian beggars not the `` common '' joe , 
  argentinians hate us ... really , look some argentinian forum and you will see it . 
  ahhh yeah , the philipiness , spains biological son gave up in adoption . 
  duck embryos ?
