  spain : - portugal : lost brother with a strangled relationship improving slowly ) . 
  - italy : brother . 
  - french : elder big brother admired by spain . 
  - romania : distant cousin . 
  - germany : boss . 
  - uk : rich neighbor . 
  - latin-american countries : disowned sons . 
  you 're right . 
  with th pujol corruption case , nationalist politicians have become more beligerant . 
  could or could n't . 
  i love this kind of political-fiction and fear-mongering , also with some anti-spanish rhetoric . . 
  [ region debt dynamic map ] ( http://public.tableausoftware.com/profile/patricia4830#!/vizhome/deudapblicajunio/deudapblica ) data source : [ autonomous regions debt ] ( http://www.bde.es/webbde/es/estadis/infoest/a1306b.pdf ) [ more information about spanish debt ] ( http://www.bde.es/webbde/es/estadis/infoest/htmls/cdp.html ), 
  ciu ( nationalist party ) governs city council , barcelona city hall , and autonomous region . 
  you forget to mention that the local and autonomous police depend on the nationalist government that can manipulate the data ( it would not the first time this happens ) . 
  national government reports half a million . 
  if there were two million , people density in the march would be insane . 
  other sources [ 1 ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/cataluna/2014/09/11/5411bad6ca47414a708b4577.html ) , [ 2 ] ( http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2014/09/11/catalunya/1410448185_312936.html ) , [ 3 ] ( http://noticias.lainformacion.com/espana/la-division-el-actor-principal-de-la-diada-mas-politizada-que-se-recuerda_uwqd6oh6oedmhfu1toi9n4/ ) are talking about 400000-650000 people . 
  not that i want the uk out of eu , but i do n't want a country were a majority of its citizens do n't want their country to be part of eu . 
  so , in abstract i do n't want uk to leave eu . 
  in particular to this case , yeah , uk should leave uk if its citizens demand it . 
  they hate us or at most , they ignore us . 
  many of them accuse us of killing native-americans and conquering their lands , although our ( and mine ) ancestors stayed in spain being almost slaves of rich people . 
  thus , it happened five centuries ago , so ** why is it our fault ? ** . 
  others say that we are exploiting them now because they are customers of big spanish corporations like movistar , santander and bbva ... yeah , of course , i 'm waiting for my monthly check to come from these companies , it is a total of 1000 $ for each spanish citizen ( it 's irony , of course ) . 
  in the last two decades have been some latin-american immigration to spain , and i 'd say they have been treated very well . 
  but they have formed some gangs like \u00d1etas , dominicans do n't play , etc. 
  that , well , are gangs and rob , kill , etc. 
  and ... there is also a small group of [ puerto ricans ] ( http://www.elnuevodia.com/resuenaenespanaintentodereunificaralaislaconlamadrepatria-1804351.html ) and another of [ cubans ] ( http://referendumparacubaya.blogspot.com.es/2012/07/reintegrar-cuba-como-la-comunidad.html ) that want the annexation with spain . 
  to sum up , many times , when i read a latin-american talking about spain , he or she is criticizing us because `` we murdered many indians '' :(, 
  deport the non-citizens , jail the citizens for terrorist support and reeducate youth in the principles of europe : peace , convivence and equality . 
  that could be true , as you said , in the fifties . 
  now , in my experience , we get along very well . 
  about the catalan thing ... yeah , they also call us , southern spaniards , lazy and robbers so do n't be surprised if we do n't like them . 
  i do n't think so . 
  maybe a combination of several factors including : - geographical location . 
  - religion . 
  - one/multiple ethnic/culture by country . 
  - existence of natural resources . 
  so , i would n't blame eastern orthodox church for all east europe problems . 
  in my opinion , romania , ukraine , russia , bulgaria and yugoslavia ( and later serbia ) have many ethnicities/cultures by country , that causes tensions and have configured the turbulent history of this part of europe . 
  before anyone calls me racist , why i think that having a country with one ethnicity/culture is easier to manage ? 
  because if everybody thinks the same , it 's simply easier to work together . 
  otherwise , there will be discussions and , in some cases , there have been a war . 
  now , we are seeing the same problems in some western countries with a huge foreigner-born and descendant population . 
  because some of these people do n't want to integrate and adopt the traditions , culture and language , conflicts happens : - surge in crime . 
  - isis volunteering . 
  - car burning . 
  - etc. 
  at last , one country that loves us ... , 
  i 've seen several in south spain . 
  is being pro gender equality islamophobic ? 
  at last !, 
  i do n't like anti-women caveman-like religions in my country . 
  i 'm catholic . 
  from what i see in my environment ( young 20-something people ) , it is not common . 
  my peers are not bigoted gay-haters . 
  i know that there is some people ( opus dei and kikos ) that have more dislike or simply hate gay people , single moms , etc , but they are not the majority in spain . 
  we are one of the most gay-friendly countries of europe . 
  [ lgbt rights in spain ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_spain ) . 
  this senator is poisoned by bigoted beliefs and , thank to god , she does n't represent the views of the majority of spaniards . 
  you were wrong . 
  in fact , [ the estelada ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estelada ) is based on the cuban design . 
  horrible design ... a flag based on cuban or puerto rican flag ? 
  well , i went to london on holiday and in the border control they asked me if i went to the uk to work ( i did n't of course ) . 
  i noticed his air of superiority toward me that , sincerely , angered ( a bit ) me . 
  these greedy nationalists want whatever to achieve its idyllic independence , even if they destroy catalonia in the process . 
  i 'm surprised that the [ alhambra ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alhambra ) is not in this list : - /, 
  true . 
  spanish will be more useful to you on your return to usa . 
  also , it 's a simpler language than german with easier pronunciation than french . 
  the new jobless dream : join an army a fight a war ... disgusting and shaming . 
  thus , note the * 2nd republic spanish * flag in the right hand of one of these boys . 
  many of the left sympathizers in spain support russian invasion , maybe because this same republican government [ sold our gold reserves to the urss in exchange of help ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_involvement_in_the_spanish_civil_war#ussr ) . 
  the extreme left is stupid in spain , it has the same stupidity than neonazis but disguised in a republican or communist flag . 
  according to some reports , [ pujol stole 1800 millions during the last 30 years ] ( http://spanishnewsonline.blogspot.com.es/2014/08/the-pujol-would-be-seventh-richest-in.html ), 
  let me put this straight : adding at least one [ war criminal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radovan_karad%c5%bei%c4%87 ) ( i do n't know about the others ) photo is not going to help you accepted and in fact , it is going to make people reluctant to even visit / r/srpska subteddit . 
  what i ca n't understand is why you people admire them . 
  in granada we 've got [ these ] ( http://treneando.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/tren-alhambra-gonzalez-molero-del-ideal.jpg ) :d, 
  sat is a [ corrupt communist union ] ( http://www.davidjackson.info/blog/tag/sindicato-andaluz-de-trabajadores/ ) involved in [ stealing and threatening ] ( http://murciatoday.com/militants-steal-food-from-supermarkets-to-feed-the-unemployed-and-disadvantaged._12705-a.html#.u-dne41_uka ) . 
  those that say spain is a racist country , take a [ look at this ] ( http://www.vice.com/read/guide-to-european-racist-leagues ), 
  yeah , for example , barcelona is [ staunchly racist ] ( http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/showtopic-g187497-i44-k649653-o50-safety_and_racism_in_barcelona-barcelona_catalonia.html ) . 
  leftist people is very racist in spain because they think they are above these layman-people flaws . 
  [ ourselves ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nationalisms_and_regionalisms_of_spain ) * i am firmly convinced that spain is the strongest country of the world . 
  century after century trying to destroy herself and still no success * otto von bismarck . 
  they 've been caught . 
  i will never vote for a party that has been paid by another country , much less a un-democratic one like venezuela . 
   i get told is that i 'm a bigot for not wanting open borders no , british eurosceptics are bigots for not wanting eu-immigration to uk but wanting emigration and freedom of movement for them in the eu . 
  nowadays most of europe respect the declaration of human rights , including rights of minorities , women and homosexuals and enforces the separation between beliefs and government . 
  that are our core values . 
  that ca n't be said about morocco , tunisia and turkey . 
  morocco , tunisia and turkey will never become secular states and they do not share our european values , so , why would they be part of our union ? 
  of course , a modern federation with : * a second language for all * common military forces * federal police force * one foreign policy * one economic and fiscal policy * full freedom of movement, 
  exactly . 
  i think that luxembourg should be set as an example for every country in our union . 
  but , let 's face it , nobody apart from spain and latin-america speaks it . 
  english however is spoken all over the world . 
  it is translated !, 
  i will take a look to the books , thank you !, 
  we love you too !,
