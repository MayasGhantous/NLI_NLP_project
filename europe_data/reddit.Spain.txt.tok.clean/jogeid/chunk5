  that only shows citizens that have a good opinion of their own country . 
  it is a corruption ** perception ** index , it does n't prove anything . 
  * it 's not prejudiced to say germany is full of warmongering racists because , your country started wwii and killed 6 million people in gas chambers . 
  * i 'm sure you do n't like this generalization and i 'm sure you do n't think is true ( i do n't ) . 
  please , have some empathy and learn about other countries instead of repeating lies without any foundation . 
  i do n't know anybody that does `` siestas '' , but yeah , spaniards are lazy and are always sleeping . 
  i know my country very well , thank you . 
  go trolling about non-issues elsewhere , 
  i 'm sure the king of spain signs everything the president of government wants to , because , you know , democracy . 
  in fact , if you read both articles 63 and 64 it is said clearly : art . 
  * the responsability to declare war and make peace belongs to the king . 
  ** previously he needs congress autorization ** . 
  in spanish , it is called [ presidente del gobierno ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prime_minister_of_spain ) ( president of government ) . 
  some countries call this position prime minister . 
  it is not forbidden editorialisation of news in this subreddit ? 
  thank you for that information , very interesting . 
  downvote me again for giving proof !, 
  i like it !, 
  in the electoral program of the 2014 european parlament elections of erc wanted to include a clause of `` reunification '' with the other `` catalan territories '' . 
  if you do n't know erc means catalan republic left and is a catalan nationalist party which forms the union of parties that will ask for catalonia independence `` junts per el si '' . 
  calm down and use english for easing that everyone can understand , ok ? 
  albania was isolated from other countries during its dictatorship much worse than spain in the 50s . 
  that is what felipe gonz\u00e1lez is referring to . 
  catalonia could become an isolated country if achieves independence alienating neighbor countries like spain , france and italy . 
  [ in the electoral program of the 2014 european parlament elections of erc ] ( http://www.cronicaglobal.com/es/downloads2/20140504programa-erc-europeas.pdf ) wanted to include a clause of `` reunification '' with the other `` catalan territories '' . 
  if you do n't know erc means catalan republic left and is a catalan nationalist party which forms the union of parties that will ask for catalonia independence `` junts per el si '' . 
  calm down and do n't insult anybody , ok ? 
  when in doubt , blame the nazis !, 
  first , franco was a fascist-like regime based on national-catholicism , that is , francoism . 
  it was not mussolini-like fascism . 
  the problem with nationalism in catalonia is making artificial differences between people and promoting hate . 
  all of this to hide the [ rampant corruption that plagues catalonia ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3itu51/anticorruption_prosecutor_found_ex_ciu_treasurer/ ) . 
  do you think that francoist regime only oppressed catalonia ? 
  my own family was oppressed or even executed so stop calling yourself `` special '' , all the country was under a dictatorship . 
  you call me stupid for disagreeing with your position , so brave . 
  let 's go back to the topic . 
  do you think that only catalonia suffered in the civil war ? 
  do you think that only catalans were repressed by francoism ? 
  let me remember you that madrid and gernica were bombed and that republicans fled in masse or were interned in camps through all spain , from south to north . 
  i 'm not , are you ? 
  i seriously hope catalonia becomes free of you all corrupt nationalist politicians . 
  yeah , when you do it in a legal way , no like last year , having nationalist politicians counting votes, 
  downvote me but : - latin american citizens can acquire spanish nationality after 2 years living here , in spain ( because you know , they have spanish ancestry ) . 
  - sefardi jews use a spanish based language and have a particular culture based on the spanish one plus they were expelled from spain ( what it is not fair ) . 
  catalan nationalists have made claims to what they call `` catalan territories '' like germany made with austria in the 1930s ' annexation . 
  are spain and russia in state of war ? 
  oh my god !, 
  i did n't know that !, 
  do you have any link where my president did the declaration ? 
  annexing other regions without asking them is pretty similar of what germany nacional-socialist regime did . 
  selling fuel is cooperating ? 
  in my country , it is called `` disrobe a saint to wear another '' . 
  what about the country of origin of the refugees ? 
  it will remain empty of workforce and young people , effectively converting it in a desert . 
  on the other side , why do you think that this refugees will adapt to their home country ? 
  why do you think that they will be able to do any jobs or conducting local business ? 
  remember we 're dealing with people that does n't speak local language , does n't know anything about local laws and have a different culture , not even an european one ( no respect for women or homosexuals , no freedom of religion , etc ) . 
  thus , take note that this refugees must return to its original country in a few years , so your idea has no basis . 
  has nato declared an official policy of refusing docking of russian submarines ? 
  what is the problem ? 
  they use gibraltar the way they want ( as a nuclear submarine base ) . 
  spain is not a vassal nation of uk . 
  i do n't want to know what he thought about spaniards ... 
  it 's a statistical law , terrorists tend to have a specific background not based in hungary . 
  maybe you do n't like that , but take a look to this [ graph ] ( http://www.statista.com/statistics/236983/terrorist-attacks-by-country/ ) that shows countries with most terrorist attacks . 
  i demand the gold of our mountains , romans !, 
  if someone talks shit about spain , it is spaniard for sure . 
  why ? 
  it is in mename 's frontpage ... 
  or maybe their culture were not known of breeding terrorists ... you know . 
  they were virreynados not colonies , so , no . 
  thus , people who exploited natives were born there so , no . 
  take a look to google translate translation if you do n't like my translation . 
  ok , so do you have a problem with the source because its name is `` el espa\u00f1ol '' , so i suppose you do n't like the new york times or washigtong post or even usa today because of their city/country bases names . 
  so , you excuse corruption because it happens in an nationalist party ? 
  tag me whatever you like , i do n't care . 
  i do n't know , read the article . 
  maybe you prefer rampant corruption than a judicial investigation . 
  is propaganda because it does n't fit your political agenda ? 
  telling the current state of a criminal investigation is doing propaganda , of course . 
  one was a colony of the other ... 
  i 'm not sure is the same situation . 
  considering that hungarians and austrians were part of the same country not to much ago , it does not surprise me . 
  i 've done my own translation but in case it is not good enough , there is this [ google translate link ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.elespanol.com%2factualidad%2fanticorrupcion-descubre-que-la-familia-sumarroca-pagaba-un-3-de-comisiones-a-ciu%2f ) for anyone that wants it . 
  anti-corruption prosecutor and civil guard were surprised to find ex-treasurer of converg\u00e9ncia democr\u00e1tica de catalu\u00f1a ( cdc ) destroying incriminating evidence . 
  investigator found in the office of daniel os\u00e1car a paper shredder full of documents linked to teyco , sumarroca family corporation that paid [ illegal ] commissions of 3 % to the nationalist party . 
  prosecutors fernando bermejo and jos\u00e9 grinda lead the entry and investigation of os\u00e1car properties and in the headquarters of cdc . 
  they have already sorted the documents that were being destroyed in the paper shredder to be reconstructed as soon as possible . 
  anti-corruption knows that sumarroca family has been paying to ciu a 3 % in commission in each construction work contract that were assigned to them by nationalist mayors . 
  investigators reach this conclusion after analyzing documentation found in a police search of the residence and offices of jordi sumarroca claverol , ceo of teyco and son of the founder of cdc , carles sumarroca coixet . 
  prosecutors started this friday a new operation inside the ` torredembara case ' where the have been investigating payments of at least ** 1.43 millions of euros ** in [ ilegal ] commissions to ciu ex-mayor daniel massaqu\u00e9 . 
  in this new phase of the investigation , the focus is on following the funds to the party and el espa\u00d1ol have known that investigators have already found that the link has been fundaci\u00f3n catalanista y dem\u00f3crata ( catdem ) . 
  this foundation is already under police search . 
  thus , there has been police search in the following city halls : sant celoni , sant cugat , figueres y lloret de mar. 
  according to some sources inside the investigation , the platform used for introducing the ilegal commissions in the party , has been the foundation linked to convergencia that 's been searched this friday . 
  thus , it 's going to be a police search in the residence of daniel os\u00e0car , ex-treasurer of ciu . 
  sumarroca family used seven corporations to bribe the ex mayor of toredembarra . 
  after detecting the existence of these corporations , prosecutors that lead the investigation , bermejo and grinda , started the ` operaci\u00f3n petrum ' [ petrum operation ] last 23th july . 
  this operations ended with the arrest of jordi sumarroca and eight police searches in residences of the prosecuted and construction corporation headquarters [ teyco headquarters ] . 
  these payments were first done throughout dos corporations of [ daniel ] massagu\u00e9 : maes flequers i pastissers bakery and daloi real state agency .
