  these payments were realized between december of 2011 and august of 2013 throughout several telcoy subsidiaries : teycotel bcn , teycotel cap roig , teycotel gesti\u00f3 d\u2019hotels and castellbell residencial . 
  these [ fund ] operations are not baked by any legal document , so that 's what public prosecutors think that they are [ ilegal ] commissions . 
  after teyco ceo arrest , the corporation made an announcement saying that they knew about the payments to the ex mayor but denied that they were ilegal commissions . 
  `` all of our commercial relationships with ex mayor were documented , legal , transparent , private and professional and without any link with being massagu\u00e9 the mayor '' . 
  according to the same announcement , `` teyco and massagu\u00e9 have and accord to jointly manage restaurants in hotels and that money were going to be spent in equipment '' . 
  `` business stopped and now massagu\u00e9 owns us money '' , explained from teyco .

  now you 're talking , what about spanish gold russia stole 70 years ago ? 
  because you say so , of course . 
  [ urss involvement in spanish civil war ( 1936-1939 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_involvement_in_the_spanish_civil_war#ussr ) where it supplied arms and other stuff . 
  thus , with complicity of communist government , urss stole spanish gold reserves in spanish national bank . 
  this affaire is know in spain as [ moscow gold ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_gold ) . 
  everybody knows that [ charles iii of spain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_iii_of_spain ) was a damn fascist . 
  very interesting and nice pictures . 
  also i 'm impressed you have a legend about [ trajan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trajan )  thank you !, 
  spain ( [ according to wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_spain ) ) : * ** romanians ** ( 730340 ) : our beloved brothers of east europe have populated many towns and in general are great people ( unless they 're gypsies , you know ... ) . 
  * ** moroccans ** ( 714221 ) : our poor south neighbors . 
  the richer come to study degrees in spain and when they end stay here . 
  the poorer work in the almeria glasshouses or other `` menial '' jobs . 
  * ** british ** ( 311774 ) : these are official numbers , unofficial numbers estimates that there can be many more british living in spain . 
  there are towns overrun by british ( called english here ) . 
  they are not integrated , they do n't speak spanish because they do n't want to . 
  * ** ecuadorians ** ( 212970 ) : not counting nationalized immigrants , ecuador is a poor country so they come here , as hispanic americans if they stay two years here , they can ask nationality . 
  they do menial jobs working as waitress , cleaners , etc. 
  situation is improving for them though . 
  * ** colombians ** ( 172368 ) : similar to ecuadorians . 
  * ** bolivians ** ( 126421 ) : similar to ecuadorians . 
  * ** bolivians ** ( 126421 ) : similar to ecuadorians . 
  * ** germans ** ( 149522 ) : they have conquered majorca . 
  we love them . 
  * ** italians ** ( 182249 ) : they speak spanish better than us . 
  we love them . 
  * ** bulgarians ** ( 140206 ) : never met a bulgarian in spain . 
  i suppose that they are called romanians a lot . 
  * ** chinese ** ( 164555 ) : they live a parallel life according to most spaniards . 
  they seem to be hard workers so many people have no problem with them . 
  last generation chinese speak spanish and are somewhat integrated in our society . 
  for a second i did n't get it ... 
  no , these are mistakes about spain : * galicia is not in the atlantic coast ? 
  * castille & leon cities ca n't be cold ? 
  spain : * not all of spain is mediterranean , we 've got a big atlantic coast . 
  * spain has zones were you can be very cold . 
  * spain is in europe , not south america . 
  we are not mexicans . 
  c'mon , we are waiting for you !, 
  return to your swamp , racist ukip troll . 
  i see you already know the important parts of spanish pop-culture :d, 
  tiresome topic , each year the same ... 
  surprisingly bad quality soil in spain ... 
  i 'm genuinely amazed ... 
  could you show an example of racism against a zone of uk ? 
  why should n't a country choose what kind of people can immigrate to it ? 
  that selection can be based on culture , language , education level and even religion . 
  i see no issue here . 
  in spain we also say `` birra '' . 
  i think that the sound of the cx and ux letters are difficult . 
  the difficult pronunciation and being non-ascii contribute to make esperanto a marginal language . 
  they always show a somewhat racist tone when speaking about spain so ... 
  why do the newspapers use clich\u00e9 images like this one when talking about spain ? 
  madrid is the richest [ source ] ( http://www.datosmacro.com/pib/espana-comunidades-autonomas ) ftfy . 
  by the way , do you think nationalism is fueled by wanting more money ? 
  i suppose you also can blame erc and icv because they were part of catalan government ... 
  7 times ? 
  i know the b\u00e1rcenas and p\u00fanica affaire but we are comparing not `` one guy '' , we are comparing a ex pm , his family and above all his political party that governed catalonia for almost 30 years . 
  i think that catalan corruption is as high as in other parts of spain , and they 're hiding the accusations and investigations under the nationalist flag , creating a confrontation in the society of catalonia . 
  if we start comparing corruption cases , you should compare the 30 years of tax fraud of the catalan pm to the rest , do n't you think `` pal '' ? 
  well , currently , strangely the pnv ( basque nationalist party ) supports the idea of changing the constitution and later , making a referendum . 
  another interesting issue is the cost of the 9 line of the barcelona underground that has surpassed the cost of the high-speed train madrid-barcelona . 
  it has reached 7 times what it was initially supposed to cost . 
  source : [ esc\u00e1ndalo : la l\u00ednea 9 del metro de barcelona duplica el coste del ave a madrid ] ( http://www.libremercado.com/2015-06-12/escandalo-la-linea-9-del-metro-de-barcelona-duplica-el-coste-del-ave-a-madrid-1276550332/ ) in spanish . 
  yes , catalan politicians have been using nationalism to ask for more money to spanish central government . 
  thus , they have been pushing for nationalism to make people forget where does all the public money goes .

  i 'm not opposed to the referendum , but constitution must be changed to allow that . 
  it 's a simple matter of not breaking the law . 
  from time to time this language maps appear in / r/europe and each one of them shows a bigger proportion of knowledge and use of regional languages than the real one . 
  thus , where are the sources of this map ? 
  unemployment situation is slowly improving . 
  of course , limited contacts are most of the contracts but you can not expect to fully recover of a 6-year crisis in only one year . 
  employers are not fully confident that our economy will continue improving so that 's the reason why the contracts are limited . 
  in my city i see more people in bars and shops and generally speaking there is some optimism in people . 
  many think next year will be better and the crisis will fade away . 
  catalans are using nationalism as a scapegoat for their own corruption issues . 
  our constitution forbids one region of making this kind of referendum . 
  catalans have never proposed any change to the constitution to continue blackmailing spanish government , asking for more money . 
  in my own circle of people , nobody think that catalans should vote without asking the rest of the country or changing our constitution . 
  thank you !, 
  it would be interesting to see a graph of these long term jobless people by work sector and by education . 
  anyone know if there is something like this available ? 
  things to be ** proud ** of my country ( spain ) : - great language , culture and cuisine . 
  - we did n't exterminate ( much ) native americans , we mixed with them creating spanish america . 
  - democratic transition of 1978 . 
  - being currently a peacefully gay-friendly country . 
  - we do n't have right-wing nationalist parties like other eu countries ( i 'm not going to mention them ) . 
  things that ** hate ** about my country : - no democratic government has invested in scientific research . 
  - nationalism and separatism that serves the interest of rich people .
