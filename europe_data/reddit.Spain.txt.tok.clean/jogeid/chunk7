  - unemployment . 
  - corruption . 
  - low culture level in our population . 
  - politicians . 
  - film : they show a `` fake '' spain full of no-standard people . 
  - that many spanish people criticize spain but do nothing to change the country . 
  i hope bullfighting becomes a bloodless sport and we can at last work in important matters like employment instead of absurd ideological debates . 
  so , we should let france and uk deal with calais immigrants on their own , i guess . 
  is this true ? 
  honest question , have they helped italy , spain and greece when dealing with immigrants ? 
  do you have any proof that we let foreigner people enter by airport without any control ? 
  because coming this statement from a citizen from a country full of immigrants ... 
  it sounds funny to me . 
  france is notorious for its * laissez-fair * with immigrants in calais . 
  hunter is from north america , not spain . 
  francoist regime was fascist or totalitarian in style but not in its foundations . 
  80s and spanish dictatorship ? 
  franco 's regime ended in 1978 . 
  thus , calling franco 's regime fascist is not totally correct . 
  it was a dictatorship \u00e0 la mussolini but based on national-catholicism . 
  the heavy armed border between spain in france was caused by eta terrorist that made their actions in spain being some of them hidden in france . 
  they have almost all the competences of an independent state , what else can be offered to them ? 
  please , read some neutral information about this topic and do n't let yourself guide for catalan propaganda . 
  non-neutral source , discarded . 
  catalan has not offered anything in exchange . 
  that 's not how thing 's are done in a negotiation . 
  they do n't have to `` please '' spain , but politics means talking and reaching a compromise between all the parties . 
  that 's exactly the oposite of what the nationalists are doing . 
  because our magna carta ( yeah i swapped the order ) forbids this . 
  it must be changed , catalan nationalists has make no intention or proposal to change it . 
  they do n't want secession . 
  the want to blackmail the central government with independency to get more money .

  current spanish constitution does not allow that , why do n't they propose a change to our carta magna ? 
  nobody proposed changing our constitution because catalan nationalist intentions are always blackmailing central government to get more money . 
  yeah , catalan nationalists were so democratic and wanted a good dialogue that the alternatives were : - independency - more money it seems blackmailing to me . 
  what ? 
  you are lying . 
  many people are catalans and are not discriminated . 
  in my experience , andalusians are more discriminated and mocked that catalans . 
  what do you think if i 'd booed or burnt the catalan flag ? 
  using football as a political tool is wrong . 
  football should join people not separate them . 
  there was no effort to stop the booing . 
  this kind of hate towards spain makes many spaniards sick because we have no fault in their hate-fueled nationalism, 
  there is anything wrong , but fcb supports catalan nationalism and the booing of the spanish anthem was part of this support . 
  no , usually they are republicans . 
  for example erc ( 2nd catalan natinalist party ) means catalan republic left in catalan . 
  let 's take a look to facts regarding fcb support of catalan nationalism : - [ the role of fc barcelona in fueling catalan nationalism ] ( http://www.sportskeeda.com/football/the-role-of-fc-barcelona-in-fueling-catalan-nationalism ) - [ fc barcelona , catalan independence movement makes team more than a club ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/29/fc-barcelona-catalan-independence_n_2038634.html ) - [ fc barcelona and catalonia 's road to independence -- video on the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2012/nov/22/fc-barcelona-catalonia-independence-video ) - [ fc barcelona supports independence referendum ] ( http://www.melty.es/fc-barcelona-apoyo-al-referendum-por-la-independencia-de-cataluna-a144278.html ) . 
  remember that this referendum was done without any legal and democratic warranties . 
  - [ xabi , about the nationalist scream ] ( http://www.20minutos.es/deportes/noticia/barcelona-real-madrid-independencia-1610625/0/ ) - ex-president of fc barcelona , joan laporta founded a nationalist party called `` solidaritat catalana per la independencia '' ( catalan solidarity towards independency ) . 
  [ in fact , he founded that political party when he was still fcb president ] ( http://www.mundodeportivo.com/20100630/joan-laporta-funda-su-partido-politico-siendo-aun-presidente_53955456469.html ) . 
  kroeber anthropological society of university of berkley [ has an interesting paper about this topic ] ( http://kas.berkeley.edu/documents/issue_101/7-benjamin.pdf ) . 
  if you do n't want to read it , jump to the conclusions :  ** f\u00fatbol club barcelona is a symbol of catalan nationalism ** and is considered to be the `` home team '' team for catalonia . 
  despite its global image , the club is still linked to the local community . 
  by attributing the world cup victory to bar\u00e7a 's contributions , the catalan-language press claims the victory not only for fc barcelona , but also for the catalan nation . 
  since the spanish victory would have been difficult to ignore in the headlines , representing the victory in a different light keeps it aligned with the ideology of the catalan press . 
  although former president jordi pujol acknowledged that the spanish victory in south africa `` did its bit to muffle the effect of the barcelona rally '' ( strubell 2011:59 ) , the catalan press did its best to keep the story alive . 
  assigning the world cup championship to bar\u00e7a 's players reinforced the importance and power of catalonia at a time when the region was struggling to renegotiate its relationship with the spanish central government . 
  therefore , ** invoking the image of fc barcelona was a political action ** influenced by language ideologies and the newspapers ' ties to the catalan nation . 
  they do n't want to be part of spain , booed spanish anthem but they play a spanish tournament . 
  totally nonsensical . 
  we only care about drug dealers and tax evaders using gibraltar as an operation base . 
  there is also the issue with territorial waters and the illegal expansion of gibraltar port sinking concrete blocks in non-uk waters . 
  it 's not the number of corruption cases , it is the amount of money . 
  but do n't take my word , here we have a [ paper done in the 2012 by the eu ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docgener/work/2012_02_governance.pdf ) that says that ** catalonia is the 130th region ( of 199 ) with better quality of government ** , below every other region of spain ( and spain itself with a poor 107th place , that really sucks ) . 
  take this as you want it , but catalonia has a problem with its current government . 
  everything is forged when does n't follow your ideas , my friend , 
  i love mexican cuisine :d on a more serious tone , i 'm afraid i do n't really know . 
  i 've met only one mexican and he was happy to visit spain and also was a cool guy but i do n't know about bilateral relationships , think they 're good though . 
  there are some curiosities about relationships between spain and mexico : - [ alaska ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alaska_ ( singer \\ ) ) , a very famous singer that lives in spain , was born in mexico . 
  - moctezuma descendants lives in spain [ duke of moctezuma de tultengo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duke_of_moctezuma_de_tultengo ) and they are high nobility ( grandes de espa\u00f1a ) . 
  - there was a big migration of spaniards to mexico following the end of the civil war . 
  - currently , there are almost 40000 mexicans living in spain . 
  supposedly , catalans have a deficit of 8000 m $ [ source ] ( http://www.expansion.com/2014/07/23/economia/1406101646.html ) but other regions like madrid have bigger deficit . 
  indeed , if we compute the deficit as a % of its pib both madrid and baleares are losing more than your government . 
  it is believed that pujol family has been stolen and money laundering ( it is being investigated that oriol , ex catalan pm son , has money launder 3 000 m $ ) . 
  why do n't you ask them about the deficit ? 
  [ source ] ( http://dolcacatalunya.com/2014/07/30/jordi-pujol-el-video-del-fraude/ ) it is also curious that catalonia owes 60 000 m $ , the region with biggest debt of spain . 
  mmmm no , it is related : [ ada colau asks for a meeting with catalan pm because catalan government owes money to barcelona local government ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/cataluna/2015/05/27/55661c7c22601d53378b45a0.html ) where did this money go ? 
  [ by central government you mean former catalan pm jordi pujol ? 
  ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/20141217/powerful-catalan-ex-leader-jordi-pujol-named-in-fraud-probe-spain ), 
  of the end of a corrupt network of politicians that use blackmailing to ask for more money to the central government . 
  maybe barcelona it 's just the beginning . 
  i 'm feeling someone is burnt . 
  thank you for the explanation , very interesting . 
  alfonso x was the king responsible of normalizing spanish and he choosed the `` norma toledana '' ( spoken spanish rules from toledo ) instead `` norma sevillana '' ( rules from sevilla ) or `` norma burgalesa '' ( rules from burgos ) . 
  i have n't found much information about this but here is a [ document ] ( http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra-visor/el-plurilinguismo-en-la-corte-de-alfonso-x-el-sabio/html/9d79beb4-8114-4b9d-b852-2643a8aa0a6e_2.html ) that brings light about this interesting topic . 
  by the way , if i 'm not mistaken , alfonso x was also important in galician language because he liked it and created many literature works in that language . 
  technically , in sevilla and surronding areas , they speak `` original mexican '' :d, 
  argentina has an currency devaluation of almost 20 % ... 
  our king took inca gold to pay endless european wars ... 
  meanwhile spanish population was also very poor . 
  orgasmus you said ? 
  rage intensifies !, 
  ok , thank you for the info  that being said , what i wanted to said is that it has no sense to think of these past crimes as a thing of our time . 
  sadly , many south-americans hate spain because `` we '' killed many `` indians '' ... 
  i do n't think something similar happens with british and their ex-colonies . 
  it is said that polish women have big breasts ... 
  aham , now it 's a consultation not a referendum ?
