  catalan nationalist do it for the money . 
  catalonia has a gargantuan debt [ link1 ] ( http://www.datosmacro.com/deuda/espana-comunidades-autonomas/cataluna ) and its leaders are always asking more money to rob . 
  it seems that ada colau victory means that barcelona citizens have awaken . 
  what about women breast size ? 
  i do n't get it , `` the devourer of towns '' ? 
  [ enjoy non-partisan vote counting ] ( https://dolcacatalunyadotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/captura-de-pantalla-2014-11-11-a-las-0-01-20.png ) for those that do n't know , he is oriol junqueras , catalan nationalist politician counting votes of independent referendum . 
  seriously ? 
  i have n't had a nap in years . 
  in fact , i eat lunch at work and go back home in the afternoon so , i ca n't take a nap even if i wanted . 
  citation needed ... 
  yeah , a referendum voted by less than 30 % of the voters ... 
  i mean that the bigger parties are national , not regional . 
  the bigger regional parties are ciu and pnv , i think . 
  i think that one of the main differences between our system and yours is the presence of the same political parties in all our regions while you have the walloons and the flemish parties ( if i 'm not wrong , of course ) . 
  ah , yeah i do n't speak castillian spanish either , 
  flag mad ? 
  what ? 
  please take note that i 'm not talking about current english ( maybe british ) people or american . 
  the citizens of these countries have no relation with the xviii-xix century people apart from being their descendants . 
  it 's stupid to ask for reparations to people that take no part in some old events . 
  take a look to [ autonomous communities of spain ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/autonomous_communities_of_spain ), 
  comparing with what the english and their colonist , no , we did n't exterminate them . 
  in fact , there were several important figures that fight for their rights like [ bartolom\u00e9 de las casas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bartolom%c3%a9_de_las_casas ), 
  we ( spaniards ) ... - we do n't take siestas . 
  - we are not always partying . 
  - we are not a conservative country . 
  - we are not racists . 
  we are bitter about ourselves and has no problem calling a black man `` black '' ( negro in spanish ) . 
  - spain is hot but also has mountainous and cold zones . 
  - we do n't worry about gibraltar , we only worry about its money-laundering issues and our territorial waters . 
  - you can be spaniard and also basque , catalan or whatever . 
  there are many ways of being a spaniard . 
  - each region has as almost the same level of autonomy than a real country , including their own taxes , police , language laws , etc. 
  spain is the most decentralized country in the world . 
  - spanish inquisition did n't kill as near as many as it is believed . 
  it is product of the [ black legend ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_legend ) . 
  - xvi century spaniards did n't exterminate the south-american natives ( like the english or americans in north america ) , they mixed with them . 
  that 's why there is so many biracial people in south-america . 
  - bullfighting is an old tradition perpetuated by old people and our `` rednecks '' . 
  young educated people do n't like it . 
  - our country is in europe ( not in south america ) . 
  - we are a developed country . 
  yes , currently we are in a big recession but even now , we are a developed country . 
  it 's third position in votes says otherwise . 
  congratulations , ireland !, 
  yeah , i know the english passion for queueing :d, 
  not sure if serious or joking but there was a queue in the school i 've just voted . 
  hahahaha , excellent !, 
  c'mon please someone make a video of juncker \u00e0 la thug life :d, 
  so , why is cameron pushing for a referendum in the 2016 ? 
  i suppose that if only a minority of conservative voters have a pro-secession stance he wo n't dare to do that , is n't it ? 
  no , we are talking about the common mentality of `` i do n't like the eu '' that happens to be in the uk at the moment . 
  racism not so subtle ... 
  i did n't expect anything else from a truly uk citizen like you . 
  i suppose not all people voted conservative for the brexit , but , indeed it was one fundamental points in the last elections . 
  not all europeans want uk in the eu . 
  if its citizens do n't want to be europeans i respect their opinion . 
  if they wish to be independent , i prefer an independent uk set apart from the eu . 
  it is not a crime , but it is a fact . 
  if the majority of your citizens wants the brexit ( horrible name by the way ) , why not give it to them ? 
  in fact , i 'm in favor of controlling eu immigrants , [ included british national ones that enjoy benefits in france , spain and other eu countries ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/19/-sp-thousands-britons-claim-benefits-eu ) . 
  when you have just chosen a conservative party that has pledged to make a referendum for the uk exit of the eu in 2016 ? 
  i do n't see any racism in my statement , only the truth . 
  most of your fellow citizens have voted for a secessionist party and in fact , this party has had a major victory in the polls . 
  being from the uk , i 'm not surprised by your opinion . 
  so , why do you it in your flair ? 
  and eu flag is a symbol of peace and unity ... 
  so i do n't see the issue here . 
  best answer ever :d, 
  it would be nice if this flags become used in real world , instead of national flag + europe flag . 
  why is ada a liar ? 
  current mayor , xavier trias has some issues everybody should know : * [ trillas spends half a million euros in official travels ] ( http://vozpopuli.com/actualidad/53217-el-alcalde-de-barcelona-acumula-gastos-en-viajes-oficiales-por-mas-de-medio-millon-de-euros ) , including a 11 days trip to miami , medell\u00edn , bogot\u00e1 and rio de janeiro . 
  * [ barcelona mayor spends 9 million euros ] ( http://vozpopuli.com/actualidad/60830-trias-se-gasta-9-millones-de-euros-en-publicitar-sus-obras-en-barcelona-antes-de-las-elecciones-de-mayo ) making propaganda . 
  it 's easy to spend money , when it is not your money ... 
  there is a wall in the alhambra built with muslim tombstones . 
  it was built by the christians when they took the city in 1492 , [ photos ] ( http://nuestragranada.blogspot.com.es/2010/02/el-muro-de-la-alhambra.html ) . 
  because they are not official languages of a nation of the eu . 
  they are official languages in a region of a country . 
  using regional languages in the european parlament would be a costly measure and would achieve nothing because all the residents in these regions can speak spanish . 
  in fact , i support the use of only one language in the eu governing bodies because the money spent in translations is atrocious [ 1 billion of eur in 2006 ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/cost-in-translation-eu-spends-83641bn-on-language-services-407991.html ) , because of the translations between 24 languages : http://www.pri.org/stories/2013-05-24/european-union-prepares-adopt-24th-official-language-costs-mount-calls-english . 
  he means that they are official in their respective regions , not in spain . 
  cyprus had stronger ( cultural and historical ) ties with europe ( greece ) than israel . 
  thus , above all , including israel in eu would be equivalent to hit a wasp nest . 
  no , they are not europeans . 
  even if they were , its government is helping isis and is progressively leaning to islamism so , hell no . 
  israel is not in europe , so no . 
  sorry for giving my opinion and asking for more information . . 
  i 'm not comparing the situation with anybody apart from luxembourg . 
  is the language topic a taboo in belgium ? 
  there are no efforts for finding a common tongue , even a foreign one ? 
  foreign trade is not an affair of the belgian government ? 
  so strange , i did n't know that . 
  will take a look to the wikipedia article , thanks !, 
  the `` fiscal deficit '' is not a thing , for example , madrid and balearic islands pay more than catalonia [ link ] ( http://www.expansion.com/2014/07/26/economia/1406386572.html ) . 
  i seriously think that all this stuff of `` fiscal deficit '' and comparing every time with the rest of spain is done with the intention of not talking about [ pujol corruption case ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21613309-jordi-pujols-confession-undermines-catalans-hopes-independence-scandal-catalonia ) . 
  i 'm not `` grasping for straws '' , in fact , it 's the same for me if you go away or stay with the rest of spain . 
  what i do n't like is calling people like me `` lazy '' and insulting spanish speakers because we live in other place than catalonia , or use spanish , english or whatever language we like . 
  yeah , take a look on how some independent catalan nationalists insult the rest of spain : * [ a catalana councilman asks for sponsoring extremaduran children ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2008/07/30/actualidad/1217405834_850215.html ) * [ laporta , former football club fcb and current leader of nationalist party solidaritat catalana per la independ\u00e8ncia , insulted 20 times extremaduran president ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/10/09/barcelona/1255068730.html ) * [ duran i lleida , catalan leader calls andalusian countrymen lazy and accuses them of being drinking in the bar because of agriculture subsidies ] ( http://www.laopiniondemalaga.es/andalucia/2011/10/09/nacionalismo-catalan-nuevo-andaluces/455734.html ) * [ a catalan nationalist insults andalusians calling them lazy because `` most andalusians work less than 4 hours a day '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25yqj8txr_e ) * [ nationalist party ciu makes propaganda calling the rest of spain subsidized regions on behalf of catalonia ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/catalunyaplural/ciu-espana-subsidiada-cataluna-productiva_0_171133066.html ) * [ montserrat candini , mayor of a town in barcelona province calls the parents that ask for shared spanish-catalan education with fascists and compares them with islamic salafists ] ( http://www.vozbcn.com/2011/09/14/85511/candini-insulta-padres-bilinguismo/ ) at least we know that only the radical nationalist catalans think that way . 
  i do n't like one country meddling with another country 's affairs . 
  i can understand that flemish government would want an independent economic mission to usa ( the same way quebec has one in london ) .
