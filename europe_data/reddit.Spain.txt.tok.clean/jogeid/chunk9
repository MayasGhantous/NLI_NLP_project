  in this case , it looks like a political mistake of the netherlands government that does n't help the good relationships between the countries of the eu . 
  also , i do n't understand politics in belgium and why it 's a problem having several languages in one country . 
  seriously , learn both you all or learn a new one as a second-language for all ( english ? ) . 
  luxembourg is a multilingual country and they are happy the way they are . 
  spain is not aggressive , catalan government is using the independence and making confrontation with central government as a scapegoat for its own corruption problems , see pujol case . 
  it should be interesting to compare this data to the salaries . 
  maybe the cost of buying an apartment is proportionally more expensive than in other regions of germany . 
  please read your own link , ceuta has never been a moroccan city . 
  in fact , ceuta was founded before the creation of morocco . 
  second ? 
  i 've just woke up from my ** third ** siesta !, 
  just in time for take some dinner and go to bed again !, 
  really , really good :d, 
  i 'm not trying to say anything . 
  that link is a `` i 'm sorry , spain '' letter written by a mapuche journalist ( south-american native ) . 
  i read it years ago and i 've just remember about it . 
  i have n't found in english so , i 've linked in spanish . 
  basically he says that the blame for the most part of the disappearance of his culture is in chile and argentina , not spain . 
  of course , i 'm not trying to say that spanish empire were saints , there were native slaves and they also were abused in the viceroyalties during xv-xviii centuries . 
  yeah , like all empires , spanish empire did atrocities but also did some good things . 
  also , we ? 
  my ancestors have been country-men since xvi century so i have no part in these matters only incidentally because it happens that i 'm spaniard . 
  pardon my ignorance but ... tatar are not ukrainians ? 
  and the eu bureaucrats are completely ignorant about how to improve the creation of big tech companies that compete with the american ones , so they use the law as a deterrent . 
  but they will tell you that we , the spaniards , are the `` badies '' ... 
  why not ** bulgarian macedonia ** ? 
  was this name proposed by the someone , anytime ? 
  the people that lives in fyrm are ( that i 'm aware of ) of slavic culture and language and they live in a land supposedly called macedonia . 
  it could be a good arrangement between greeks and macedonians . 
  it does n't matter because he had to go to usa to continue his work so ... 
  he was calling me franquist so ... 
  i 've given arguments yet you only try to call me `` illiterate '' , i think that 's because you do n't have anything else to say ? 
  both sides did atrocities . 
  i 'm not brainwashed by the propaganda that says that the second republic was the best . 
  considering that they killed anarchists and other communists ( poum ) in the war . 
  also , one of my ancestors ( a militiaman ) was killed by the army in the war because he took part in the firesquad that murdered a priest and other civilians ... 
  i know what i 'm saying `` idiot '' . 
  i did n't said that . 
  the army was pissed of the killing of civilians and mad the worst possible decission , that is declare war . 
  we should stop taking sides . 
  it was a war caused by both sides imo . 
  the republic failed to protect some social groups of left-ideology terrorists , even encouraging the murders and the army should n't have attacked and declared the war . 
  same for you , bloody franquist !, 
  it was indeed a turbulent time . 
  there was an growing social conflict that ended in a civil war . 
  the second republic had many ideas and was a moving force for spain . 
  the main problem is that it failed in keeping peace between the different political actors of that time . 
  considering the killings of anarchists in casaviejas , yeah , the second republic was a bad thing . 
  ... that ended in the most cruel civil war that happened in spain . 
  what a poor written style for an article in a newspaper like washington post : * * draghi says `` he 'll do '' * * * now the ecb was able to calm things down for a little while by giving banks super-cheap loans to buy bonds with ... * * * it turns out the pain in spain was self-fulfilling * * * newly-printed money *, 
  well , it 's no taboo in spain , everybody knows that there is sexual tourism in majorca . 
  totally agree with his opinion . 
  english should be official second language of the union . 
  and people with english as native tongue should pick up other language and learn it , that 's all . 
  and now you fuck everyone else with your language politics . 
  well , i 'm from the south and the animosity against catalan erupts when their leaders call us lazy like in [ this case by dur\u00e1n i lleida ] ( http://www.diariocordoba.com/noticias/cordobaandalucia/nacionalismo-catalan-recurre-otra-vez-insultos-andaluces_669118.html ) . 
  i did n't know that there are several galician dialects . 
  did he lived in zones with different dialects so he speaks an unified galician because of that ? 
  or is there another reason ? 
  if a public servant does not feel fluent in that language , he/she can call one of his/her mates for help . 
  i do n't see the issue here . 
  in my country languages are used as a political tool in hands of the nationalist parties , in particular , catalan and basque . 
  it 's a shame that their beautiful languages are used that way but that 's the way it is . 
  this attitude simply discourages people of other regions to learn these languages so , its their loss . 
  galician people do n't force their language and that 's the reason they grow some positive attitude in us , spanish-speakers . 
  in fact , our prime minister knows that language and there is no problem with that . 
  i personally do n't care about what language do you speak while you do n't force your language upon the others . 
  that 's why i think that each town should vote what languages want and in what order of precedence , including european languages like english , french , german , etc. 
  that way , using the popular vote , we do n't force any language to anyone . 
  on a regional level , only knowledge one of the languages of the region should be required . 
  it does n't matter if it is the regional or the national language . 
  at least one of them should be known to every public servant , maintaining complete neutrality in the so-called `` language dispute '' of many bi-lingual regions . 
  edit : to answer your question ( catalan or basque nationalist : 10 , non-nationalist : 1 ) . 
  he simply miss the worst recent period of time of spain ... 
  meanwhile , in the real world ... [ jordi pujol 's , ex pm of catalonia , corruption scandal ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21613309-jordi-pujols-confession-undermines-catalans-hopes-independence-scandal-catalonia ), 
  the same-as-ever catalan nationalist political stance with the only intention of asking spanish government for more money to waste . 
  very intelligent ... do n't teach your children the 3rd most spoken language , why could it be useful ? 
  business is business , my friend . 
  try being spanish ... we are lazy , take siestas of 4 hours each day , pass the day in the beach and of courser , we kill bulls and we hate gibraltar and want to conquer uk . 
  oh , and do n't get me with the jokes about the spanish inquisition . 
  just to clarify , this bank belongs to the [ banca privada d'andorra ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banca_privada_d%27andorra ) , a bank from the tax haven of [ andorra ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andorra ) . 
  why has greece forgotten this loan during the last 70 years ? 
   this comparison is just absurd . 
  you are comparing a former colony that developed to a nation driven by a single ethnic group to a federation of countries that have histories ( with all the implications of said history ) going back thousands of years . 
  usa has many ethnicities . 
   you laugh at the language issue but i do n't see why my language should be relegated to a museum just because more people speak another one . 
  i 'm not laughing . 
  i 'm just saying a second common language is needed to ease the communication between europeans . 
  if you want to speak your language or a death tongue , it 's up to you , but we must have an useful language for everyday communication , not for nationalist and ilogical reasons . 
   as for the war reparations the argument is not so much about getting anything back as for the moral stance of germany . 
  germany was pardoned the majority of its debt after ww2 in order to allow for reconstruction . 
  greece was obligated to donate money to the country that destroyed them . 
  in case you did not know nazi germany obligated the puppet government of occupied greece to lend to the reich significant sums . 
  payment of that debt was forfeited by greece until the reuinification of germany not forever . 
  then germany reunited and the eu paid a lot for said reunification in the spirit of solidarity . 
  now greece asks for some solidarity and the germans are calling them lazy ass donkeys and refuse to consider the same measures that were so generously handed to them . 
  germany has paid plenty of war reparations . 
  why greece ask for more now , almost 70 years later the end of wwii ? 
  simply as an excuse of its fiscal * wrondoings * . 
   the eu is broken and that 's because there is no common dream anymore .
