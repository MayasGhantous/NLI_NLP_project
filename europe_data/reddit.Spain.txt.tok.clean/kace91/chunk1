at least create a legal framework for the use of this power , instead of naively thinking if we somehow pressure the government enough they 'll stop doing it . 
  you still do n't understand . 
  it 's not about the legality of the situation , it 's about the technical aspect . 
  `` we 'll make this safe for everyone except the government '' is not a valid option : if you force door manufacturers to make every door in a way that police agents can always open it , then thiefs will also be able to open them through the same system . 
  in the case of the san bernardino incident , what the fbi did was hiring a hacker that had found a failure in the system . 
  in that case , it actually is a discussion on whether the fbi was legitimized to do it , but i 'm not entering that debate , that 's a whole different matter . 
  the difference between the two is that in the san bernardino incident the fbi beneffited of a security flaw * that was already there , by an oversight on apple 's part . 
  * in this proposed idea , however , the engineers of apple will have to * on purpose leave security flaws on the products they design * just in case the fbi ever wants to use it , and in doing so expose all their clients to potential attacks by third parties . 
  you seem to have a severe misunderstanding of what was proposed . 
  it 's ** backdoor access ** . 
  it 's not facebook being asked to give your information and having to comply , it 's facebook being forced to make its own application breakable by letting a security flaw in on purpose so governments can hack into it . 
  this does n't help keep the process secure . 
  it 's just making every single application unsafe by law , in a way that can potentially spread : if anyone gets knowledge of the vulnerability they can effectively have access to everyone 's private lives.snd before you say `` well the government can keep this info secure '' , no they ca n't . 
  this is the information age , even the almighty american agencies just recognized a month ago that their own software was filtered and is being sold around the world now . 
  you could add the death of carme chacon , first woman to be minister of defense - at 47 , due to a heart condition . 
   there are paid protestors sent there by soros . 
  where can i apply ? 
  those guys have a dream job , they 're getting paid to go to the very same protests i would join for free . 
   the dining room , deep in the hotel , is a broad space of high ceilings and coving , with thick carpets to muffle the screams . 
  it is decorated in various shades of taupe , biscuit and fuck you . 
  there 's a little gilt here and there , to remind us that this is a room designed for people for whom guilt is unfamiliar . 
  now here 's some journalism i can get behind . 
   carmena wo n't be able to force banks or sareb to open their stock , so if the only way is more stock competing against the free market , then that 's what 's needed . 
  i do n't know about regional governments , but we need a huge state level tax that penalizes keeping buildings unused . 
  creating more living space wo n't help if the process that lead to our current situation is n't fixed . 
  [ there 's actually a reason for that !, 
  ] ( http://www.abc.es/20100325/madrid-madrid/bandera-techo-espana-20100325 ) long story short , the owners put it there because it adds 16 meters to the official height , so they can keep the title of tallest building in spain . 
  we had this same discussion in a thread two days ago but sadly i think it did n't make the front page . 
  usa , the uk and the eu all officially consider eta a terrorist group ( canada too i think ) , yet the whole week there have been news about them in the bbc and they 've gone through ridiculous lengths to avoid using the word . 
  as a spaniard , i 'm lowering a lot my opinion of the bbc after this , i 've always considered them relatively objective . 
  i might write a letter this evening . 
   your police force is ok , it 's not amazing . 
  if it was amazing i would n't be able to exit the subway in madrid at lavapies make my way to la latina and score all the hash i want from the many many many moroccans chilling on the streets slinging it like candy . 
  believe it or not , terrorism is treated more seriously than weed . 
  [ but , ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2016/11/19/actualidad/1479537885_652818.html ) speaking [ seriously ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2017/03/17/actualidad/1489759121_789670.html ) now , [ we 've ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2016/10/12/actualidad/1476251928_056138.html ) got [ a nice ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2016/12/28/actualidad/1482919214_430988.html ) track [ record ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2015/11/03/actualidad/1446530674_736867.html ) . 
  other branches of the police are ok , but ( sadly ) enforcing a dictatorship first , and then battling eta in democracy , have left us with a pretty capable force battling terrorism . 
  the million of muslim nationals that are well integrated also contribute to security , since they tend to denounce extremism if they see it brewing . 
  there have been 74 crackdowns against yihadist terrorists just in the last 3 years , most of which were about to commit a crime . 
  most people do n't even know it because it does n't make frontpage news . 
  also , banning refugees from the country would endanger the lives of many innocents for a not really high increase in security . 
  studies show that refugees and terrorism are n't really that connected : statistically speaking the average profile of a terrorist is a national citizen ( descentant of either moderate immigrants , or from ethnically spanish christian families ) that is radicalized in secret consumming propaganda from the internet - a ** huge ** part of our security is based on surveillance of certain websites and social network profiles . 
  do you realize that half of spanish culture is shaped by 700 years of islamic heritage , right ? 
  some of our most amazing buildings are old mosques , we still conserve their water systems , literature ... more than enough for us to know quite well that the religion is not the problem , extremists branches are . 
  we 've had violence before , we 'll have it in the future . 
  it 's inevitable . 
  we have an amazing police force that has already caught and foiled hundreds of plots , to minimize the danger , but even if one eventually succeeds saving thousands of people is still a risk worth taking . 
  i hold a similar view as with abortion : the place where to draw the line is blurry , but `` never '' is waay too conservative . 
  did you answer to the wrong thread ? 
  my country is as far from fucked in social/violence issues as you can be , and our economy has nothing to do with terrorist extremists ... 
  at some point , someone , somehow , became convinced that the correct thing to do with his life was to run over innocents using a stolen truck . 
  it is tempting to label him as a monster and ignore his motives after seeing what he did , but i think we must struggle to see his viewpoint to understand how that came to happen - just so we can stop it from happening again , in the same way that we strive to understand how cancer spreads . 
  hey , i just wanted to say that we appreciate the effort you guys put in this subreddit . 
  i 'm watching in real time how you 're working against the clock to keep the thread free of hate speech , and i realize the effort you put in to keep the place decent . 
  props to you !, 
   thing is , western culture and the way it unfolded has very difficult time accepting `` we do n't know '' as an answer . 
   hence religion is being shunned more and more . 
  i 'd argue the very opposite : i 've always considered religion a manifestation of our natural lack of ability to accept `` i do n't know '' as an answer . 
  we naturally have an impulse to understand the causes and effects of every event around us , so we ca n't stand not fully understanding our environment ; and so , we create stories to hold on to . 
  in the past the questions where `` what causes rain and thunder '' , or `` what is up there , beyond the sky '' ; now those are answered , but we still wonder what happens after we die , or who or what started the universe . 
  sorry to hear about that . 
  i hope she 's well ( considering the circumstances ) . 
   you have n't read the basics of abrahamic religions - the book of genesis . 
  humans have free will precisely because they left the shelter of eden , where no such diseases existed , to have a world of their own , where they will suffer , they will take responsibility , they will act independently - outside of god managing them or their world . 
   god put people in eden , where no such hardships existed . 
  earth is meant to be a punishment that determines people 's moral choices . 
  none of that makes any sense if you fully grasp the full extent of the definition of a god - all powerfullness . 
  a punishment is a corrective . 
  it 's a method we use to correct undesired behavior . 
  a god does n't need to teach anything to a person - he could just have the person know something with a mere wish . 
  a god would not need a corrective because he can make something perfect ( or else he is not a god ) , and if he finds a flaw ( which should be already impossible , but whatever ) he can just * wish that flaw away * . 
  now , you would say that `` that method contradicts free will '' but it 's again an underappreciation of the concept of god : both the very concept of free will , and humanity 's longing for it , * are also god 's creation * . 
  what 's the point of creating us with a desire to choose for ourselves and risk making a wrong choice , when god already knows the good one ? 
  so the only explanation left is that god creates on purpose creatures with a desire to fail and stride away from his perfect path , and then hurts them for doing so despite knowing from the start that they would ( he is all knowing ) . 
  it 's pointless and cruel . 
  whatever is the end of his mistery process , he could just wish to be at the end of said process and save people of any misery . 
   here we have free will and ability to act as we please because there is no god to manage the place , but also suffering and hardship , precisely because there is no god around to manage the place . 
  unless you define every single hardship suffered by humans to be a result from human free will , the argument falls . 
  there is not an incompatibility between , say , removing cancer and keeping free will . 
  in fact , it 's not only about god not removing painful illnesses , but about * having specifically created them . 
  holy shit . 
  how can one keep living after something like that . 
  lol , i vote for the somewhat far left in my country and i 'm situated to the right of macron , agreeing a 56 % with him and 49 % with fucking le pen, 
  i mean , just the combination of the us , the uk and the eu is already pretty much the whole western world - it should be enough to at least deserve a mention like `` considered by some to be a terrorist organization '' . 
  also , the definition of terrorism fits like a glove ( using violent means to create fear or terrror in pursue of a political or ideological goal ) . 
  and to be clear , i 'm not entering to debate the validity of their ideology - just their violent methods and the fact that they 've targeted innocent civilians . 
  it 's fine to be critical , i would be too . 
  and the misuse of faculties to impose ideologies is certainly a problem that deserves to be addressed . 
  i just do n't think it 's right to support the closure of a university based on a random list of the courses offered without further information , as a lot of people is doing here ( not saying you 're part of them ) . 
  per wikipedia :  the european union and the united states list eta as a terrorist group in their relevant watch lists . 
  the united kingdom lists eta as a terrorist group under the terrorism act 2000 . 
  yet this piece by the bbc seems to go through great lenghts to avoid using the term . 
  it 's a small detail , but i 'm very curious about why . 
  we can both agree that there are both good and bad teachers , and that bad teachers will try to push their ideology as a class requirement . 
  we can also agree that this practice is naturally more common in social sciences , since there is n't as much room for ideology in , say , math - even though they still manage to do it , believe me . 
  what i do n't get , however , it 's why some of you have automatically decided that those courses are grouped in the category of bad teachers without having seen a lecture , nor knowing who is teaching each class , nor even having read the course syllabus . 
  i 'm pretty quick to call bullshit when i see it , but i am yet to see proof of their agenda pushing ( not saying there is none , just that i have no proof so far ) and in fact what i 've checked has been positive - for example , all classes seem to put a good amount of importance in critical thinking and autonomous projects instead of just lecturing and having students repeat the lecture . 
  we 're on it , that 's why southern european governments push against austerity - although spain remains very commited to it as long as it 's eu policy because we benefit a lot from having a good relationship with our neighbours . 
  hopefully with a potential turn to schulz/macron , and the uk out of the way , we 'll see a change in policy that benefits us . 
  some of our problems are unexcusable though - the bureaucratic nightmare that is being a freelance/small business owner , for example . 
  we 'll hopefully tackle those issues in the future , a lot of parties now carry that in their programs and we 're seeing growth .
