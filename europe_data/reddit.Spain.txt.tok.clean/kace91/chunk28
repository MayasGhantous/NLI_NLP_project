  i work as a developer . 
  the non-spoken rule seems to be `` dress accordingly if we 're meeting clients , otherwise do whatever you want '' . 
  dress accordingly = business casual or something similar . 
  on fridays i go to the gym till 9-10 pm so , after work plus that , i 'm usually too tired to go out . 
  saturdays are when the magic happens ... 
  the `` deaf '' girls collecting signs are all around europe , we have them in madrid and i 've seen other users of this forum mentioning them from other capitals . 
  there were several sharing class with me during primary school ( native spanish gypsies ) . 
  they were nice although you could see the culture was different . 
  they claimed that they were descendants of jesus and old kings and so the laws did n't apply to them because a `` payo '' ( slur for non-gypsies ) can never rule over a gypsy and that the only reason to follow the law was to avoid danger so not getting caught or avoiding punishment due to being minors was just as good . 
  they also claimed that if someone is scammed then that person is to blame for being a fool , and that in any case where conflict arises the only way to solve it is to fight to prove you have honor . 
  but the thing is that in practice they were really cool with the kids that they knew , there was basically this attitude of `` if i know you , you 're like family and i 'll back you up whatever happens '' . 
  that aside , i personally was the `` victim '' of a robbery attempt back when i was about 18 by a kid that was like 13 . 
  he did n't even carry a knife , he was basically banking on the idea that if i reacted his whole family would come after me , so i just ignored him and walked all the way home with a kid behind me trying to get his hand into my pockets or get me to hit him . 
  it is funny in hindsight although it was annoying as hell at the time . 
  to be fair that only happens during teenage years - the kids miss school a lot so they 're always in the street and they rob/deal drugs . 
  i 've never had a problem with an adult spanish gypsy , there are a lot in my neighbourhood and they are as nice as they come . 
  eastern european gypsies have also been around for some years . 
  all interactions i 've had with them have been watching them beg and or trying to scam tourists in the city center , i 've literally never seen them in any other context . 
  my great grandfather fought in the spanish civil war , during which he was warned in advance of an assassination attempt against him and had to ran away to france ... later ending up in a concentration camp . 
  real lucky guy . 
  apparently i am , yes . 
  well , i ca n't tell you how to feel :p but i was mostly referring to a certain condescending attitude i see towards americans , and practically all posts by us users get downvoted unless they 're specifically about criticizing the us . 
   there is also `` take/do a spanish one '' , `` ta en spansk en '' - cut corners/half-ass/illegal but simple solution for that we 've got `` hacerlo a lo gitano '' - `` to do it gypsy-style '' . 
  that 's what i read on the internet too , but according to / u/luciustitius they use the same expression in slovenia so i 'm not really trusting that explanation - it would require their words for `` swedish '' and `` zueco shoes '' also being similar sounding in their language , and them reaching the same idiom , which does n't sound plausible . 
   an indian line : a queue . 
   it 's all chinese for me : i do n't understand what you are saying . 
  we share those !, 
  and the turk 's head one too , in our case it 's the person that will take the punishment in lieu of others - like being the one that goes to jail after your company does something ilegal . 
   being drunk like a polish man : no need to explanations here . 
  on the same line , we have drinking like a cossack . 
   english condom : a condom . 
  i do n't really get this one . 
  what does the english reference add ? 
  does it mean something different if you just say condom ? 
  that 's a curious one . 
  if there 's something i would n't have imagined we 'd be referenced for , it 's workers ' benefits :(, 
  to be fair i do n't know where it comes from ... perhaps from swedish tourists being unaware of surrounding events due to not speaking spanish ? 
  just a guess . 
  you do n't really need flairs to tell spaniards apart . 
  if someone 's arguing with a spaniard you know that person is a spaniard too . 
  unless he mentions the armada . 
  then he might be british . 
   be sure to order your tortilla without onion . 
  i do n't see why that 's bad advice . 
  i know they 're partisan issues in america , but the question asked `` by european standards '' , which is the part i put between parenthesis . 
   other big issues that could affect them ( changes to social security and medicare ) are political non-starters not worth discussing ; i ca n't take that argument because i do n't think reddit ignores that possibility just based on infeasibility : universal basic income seems to be equally unachievable and is brought up all the time , and i 've personally never heard old people mentioned in arguments about healthcare on reddit . 
  if somehow the operation is given the green light from china , south korea and japan , then by all means do what you have to do ( i 'm assuming that consent from all parties implies that the complex issues like what to do with the country afterwards have been properly planned ) . 
  however , if it 's yet another `` let 's kill the bad guys and leave a mess '' operation then i really do n't approve , no matter how big the threat north korea is . 
  as far as i 've seen , it 's a non story , other than it being a curiosity for people that like to know about military tech and history . 
  there has n't been any number of civilian casualties and it 's a military operation like any other . 
  i 'm as critical of trump as they come but i ca n't see how the story is related to him , neither positively nor negatively . 
   not to mention their tendency to ask you weird questions like it 's a pop quiz about the store you work in for absolutely no reason can you expand on that ? 
  what kind of questions ? 
  not sure if it can count as reenactment , but a lot of small towns have `` fiestas de moros y cristianos '' ( literally moors and christians dates ) which commemorate the conquest by muslims and the following reconquista . 
  they tend to consist of several pseudo-military parades where [ the opposing factions ] ( https://myspanishinspain.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/moros_3.jpg ) walk around in [ their battle armor . ] ( http://images.vozpopuli.com/2016/12/12/memesis/virales/moros-cristianos-caravaca-cruz-murcia_980312010_4910783_1020x634.jpg ) . 
  they 're probably not historically accurate at all , but it 's impressive watching a medieval army walk around - a mounted knight might not seem like much in a movie but when he 's approaching you and you realize it 's twice your height while your whole body vibrates due to the war drums , it 's a different matter . 
  americans are great in general , but i hate that they 're always the ones to hire segway tours around the city - just fucking walk , those things are really annoying to have passing around you . 
   spanish/latin american : come in laaarge tour groups and visit random stuff around the city , usually not a problem but consider how tiny our streets are and how we all have places to go . 
  does n't help they sometimes stand in front of my university buildings by the entrance , and i am late for lectures/seminars because of them . 
  it is traditional for high schools to organize an `` end of basic studies '' international trip and practically all classes end up choosing either italy or the netherlands for some reason . 
  that might partly explain the groups . 
  for some cultures , lack of response or engagement in an activity is a proper way to act , and even desirable to let others save face . 
  for example , if someone invites you to an event you might just not answer the text and the other person will understand and not insist . 
  or you might think that acting as if a recent argument has n't happened is a way to move on . 
  spaniards * loathe * that behaviour . 
  it 's about the worst thing you could do to us . 
  our culture is very confrontational ( in the good sense ) , so ignoring someone is like saying `` i care so little about you that i wo n't even take your action seriously , * you do n't exist to me * '' . 
  it 's better to scream at someone at the top of your lungs than to give them the silent treatment . 
  ---------------------------------- some shorter ones : - spaniards are `` unknowingly racist '' . 
  perhaps race insensitive is the correct term ? 
  there are n't any racist ideas , but there are lots of pop culture that could certainly come up as offensive that we do n't realize . 
  for example , [ one of the most popular kinds of candy are these chocolate balls whose brand name is conguitos ( literally `` little congos '' ) . 
  ] ( https://www.tienda.lacasa.es/468-pos_thickbox/conguitos-24-uds-20-g.jpg ) or in mortadelo comics , perhaps the most famous among kids , [ asians are still drawn like racist wwii era caricatures , and speak switching r and l ] ( http://mortadelo-filemon.com/images/photos/vinyetas/aventuras_largas_ibanyez/elplemionovel.jpg ) - the writer does n't have any racist views , he 's just old as fuck and the artistic style comes from the times of the dictatorship and isolationism . 
  - spaniards are tolerant , in the good and bad sense . 
  you want a gay marriage , cover your whole skin in tatoos , sing a song about an orgy with the virgin ? 
  very few would mind - but for the same rule , natural medicine , homeopathy or palm reading are accepted , * their version is as good as yours * . 
  - spaniards keep their bets and dares . 
  do you want a spaniard to do something ? 
  just shout at them * no hay huevos * ( literally `` there 's no balls [ to do x ] '' ) . 
  they 'll do it 100 % of the time . 
  - spaniards are n't punctual . 
  you 're gon na meet someone at 6 ? 
  be prepared to be still waiting at 6:20 . 
  for spain i guess the accent of madrid would be perceived as somewhat neutral , in the sense that it 's the one that most people use on tv . 
  no version it 's wrong , though . 
  i 'm pretty sure i wo n't see public pensions for me . 
  if i 'm wrong all the better , but i 'll be paying for a private pension fund on top of my taxes just in case . 
  that 's basically my idea , yup . 
  which is n't that weird , after all . 
  most people end up following the ideas that ( they think ) will benefit them the most , and reddit is just too homogeneous for everyone to be represented . 
  albert rivera , leader of the center right , overreacted after someone implied he was a cocaine addict , and ever since then he 's become a running joke : [ it snows in madrid ] ( http://statics.vistoenlasredes.com/vefs/2017/03/vef_463008_ha_nevado_en_madrid_y_se_ha_puesto_muy_feliz_pornbsptecnobotijo.jpg?cb=3380191 ) [ happy consumers ' day ] ( http://statics.vistoenlasredes.com/vefs/2017/03/vef_462486_por_un_consumo_responsable_por_fairlane4.jpg?cb=4472622 ) [ `` we add the methylamine to the based we prepared let it cool and in an hour we 'll have it ready to consume '' ] ( http://statics.vistoenlasredes.com/vefs/2017/03/vef_461642_ya_sabemos_lo_que_le_gusta_hacer_a_albert_rivera_en_sus_ratos_libres_por_frankysebas.jpg?cb=5231024 ) ------------------ people laugh at our president for being a boring speaker using this pic with with obama . 
  example with the switch to summer time : [ `` so at 3am it will be 2 am , which means tomorrow the sun will rise sooner ... no , later , and then ... its all to save water ... '' ] ( http://statics.vistoenlasredes.com/vefs/2017/03/vef_463221_rajoy_lo_esta_pillando_todavia_por_muyempanao.jpg?cb=6438129 ) [ every time the government proposes a new budget cut or something this image of the president appears ] ( http://statics.vistoenlasredes.com/vefs/2016/10/vef_452947_no_se_quien_da_mas_miedo_por_elcojodelepanto.jpg?cb=1999301 ), 
  excluding extreme subs like the donald and the `` full communism '' crowd , reddit basically lacks political ideology besides `` things that will benefit a white male american in his twenties '' . 
  for example , yay for weed legalization ( left wing to me ) , public education and healthcare ( non partisan to me ) , favor of gays ( non partisan ) , but usually virulent reaction to any mention of feminism of any kind , 0 empathy for minorities with a different ideology like muslim refugees , hard on for gun rights ( all of those feel off the charts right wing ) , 0 interest for policies or lack thereof that affect older people , as pensioners are basically seen as just `` the ones who caused our current problems '' , absolute opposition to any idea that controls verbal abuse towards minorities under the flag of freedom of expression , and a huge creepy amount of military worship . 
  that is completely true . 
  this place works fine as a place for europeans to discuss european affairs , but it is very unwelcoming to foreigners , and even more so to americans . 
  what 's the difference between the first ten and the other ammendments ? 
   in suits at common law , where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars , the right of trial by jury shall be preserved , and no fact tried by a jury , shall be otherwise re-examined in any court of the united states , than according to the rules of the common law . 
  this sounds weird , specifically the fact that it states a fixed amount ( i assume 20 dollars was a very different value at the time of its writing ) . 
  neither slavery nor involuntary servitude , except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted , shall exist within the united states , or any place subject to their jurisdiction .
