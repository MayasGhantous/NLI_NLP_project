  this one sounds a little fucked . 
  can you be sentenced to become a slave ? 
  wtf is going on with that exception ? 
  if i had to choose one i would go for the twenty second . 
  i do n't think it would be wrong for an elected leader to serve more than 8 years if he 's still popular enough to be elected . 
  yet he performs well : the aim of the song is to make you cry and you do so . 
  i mean , i 'm not going out with the head chopping crowd haha . 
  most of the more religious i 've met were n't actually catholic , but evangelical christians , which might explain the different approach . 
  in spain a secession of catalonia is theoretically possible , and by eu rules the resulting country would not be part of the eu - but there is n't any anti eu ideology going on there so they would probably apply and be fast tracked into rejoining . 
  there 's definitely a connection between spain and latin america . 
  some countries more than others , but generally speaking i could go to live in any spanish speaking country without much culture shock . 
  however , there are also some half hidden deep cultural differences that arise in closer relations . 
  for example , most latin american people with whom i 've had closed relations are far more socially restricted by religion ( as in your should n't masturbate , do n't cuss using terms that are religiously offensive , virgin till marriage , etc. ) . 
  i do n't know to what degree those are actually followed but at the very least the illusion is maintained in public . 
  there 's also other kinds of social conservatism ( men should behave in a manly manner , women take care of the household , girls that like casual relationships are whores , loads of homophobia , etc ) . 
  keep in mind that i 'm talking * comparatively in relation to spain * . 
  it 's not like ecuador is ruled by isis . 
   i 'm not sure about that . 
  here in spain , the right is the one who pushes for punishing hate speech and the likes . 
  i do n't agree , the right deffends mostly the right of honor and `` humililation of victims of terrorism '' laws . 
  they oppose for example the banning/removal of fascist symbols and apology of the dictatorship , we do n't have laws in the style of germany . 
  you 're mediterranean by proxy < 3, 
   is it something you really do with your hands ? 
  i do n't know why i find this question so funny . 
  yeah , basically describes the attitude of captain jack sparrow . 
  lawlessness with sort of an endearing connotation . 
  hard to say due to media silence and so on , but i 've known of at least 3 different claims . 
  a foreign english teacher i had in highschool ( american ) went to a market and asked the guy to make sure the meat did n't have preservatives added . 
  he could n't understand the guy 's angry reaction at the mere implication of such a possibility and so she came back to class claiming the guy was way too sensitive about the traditional products he sold . 
  what actually happened , as we let her know , is that `` preservativos '' is spanish for condoms . 
  all active and controlling the whole territory ? 
  :p see , the thing is that our constitution makes the king exempt from the law - technically he could kill someone in broad daylight and it would be fine . 
  since ours has had an ... intense life , institutions were worried that after abdication he would be hit with a shitton of paternity lawsuits . 
  to avoid that , they invented the category of `` king emeritus '' so he could remain a king after abdicating on his son . 
    but seriously : i left that sub because of how incredibly hateful it was towards refugees . 
  it 's actually one of the reasons for me to stay . 
  someone has to rebate them , 
  number of kings ? 
  we have two with their respective queens , i shit you not . 
   in europe you only get it with lots of additional sugar . 
  amazon has it with no added sugar for a great price , at least here in spain - their own brand i think . 
   high quality american chocolate not that , please . 
  if you like that , [ let me introduce you to our amazing version of elvis ' in the ghetto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrtfyitddwa ) . 
  i need to translate some of them at some point . 
  goyo jimenez has a hilarious set of monologues comparing stereotypical american life as portrayed in hollywood movies ( giant houses , prom , sex under a fireplace with romantic music in a hut ) vs. average middle class spanish life . 
  spain has an * amazing * stand up community , and i think at least some of them would be in par with the most world famous ( chapelle , bill burr , louis ck , etc. 
  ) , however afaik they 've never been translated and they 'd suffer from the language barrier . 
  dylan moran is amazing , although i prefer his stand up shows . 
  it is illegal to fire employees due to political opinions . 
  i 'd say it is however quite annoying and does n't lead to anything that is n't either shouting into your echo chamber or dumbed down discussion - i have not seen constructive political dialogue come from facebook , ** ever ** . 
  i think it 's far wiser to just leave that to personal interactions . 
  yeah i 'd say people in those scenarios just treat politics as a source of banter like football . 
  `` oh turns out you vote iu . . am i going to find a barricade in the office when i go tomorrow ? '', 
  one point that most discussions of this kind tend to forget is that a lot of countries form their national identity by glorifying their fight for independence : peru 's national anthem states that `` some day , the beaches of iberia will feel the terror of our cannons '' , and the old anthem of argentina talks about `` ripping appart the iberian lion '' , for example . 
  i 'm not condemning it ( it 's not like we were making friends over there in times of the empire ) , but it 's certainly something to take into account . 
  i do n't know ... who has a great economy , shitty weather , scores badly on social issues , does n't have a catholic tradition and puts ketchup in pasta ? 
  portuguese ? 
  does n't look like anything to me . 
  where is that place ? 
  our constitution , article 14 :  all spaniards are equal to the law , without any possible discrimination based on ** birth , ** race , ** sex , ** religion , opinion or any other personal or social circumstance . 
  article 57  the crown of spain is ** based on heritage ** by successors of don juan carlos the first of borbon ... [ ... ] on the succession line , ** men precede women ** [ ... ], 
  reading speed is 1:1 ; for writing , it depends : i can write just as fast but i still rely on spell check for english , to avoid minor mistakes . 
  i would * never * spell a word wrong in spanish , although that could be due to the fact that spanish is far more regular . 
  hace you heard of frankenstein ? 
  that 's what i 'm trying right now . 
  the catch is that it comes with a smaller salary and lack of job stability ( you never know if the company will still be alive year ) . 
  i wish a decent wage and a decent schedule were n't mutually exclusive . 
   and to learn english : use subs , not dubs . 
  i know that , but there 's no way to change it . 
  the elder wo n't accept it for regular tv because `` why would i need to read while watching tv '' , and there 's a whole industry built around dubbing that would be killed . 
  i watch everything in original version and for that i need to either torrent most shows or go to the one or two movie theaters in the city that play undubbed content . 
  netflix makes things a little easier but there 's a lot of content missing . 
  as for the reduced working hours , talking to the average spanish boss is like talking to a wall of bricks . 
  they 'll usually tell you something like `` well then you 're saying that you can do your work in 6 hours so you 're robbing me by wasting the other two !, 
  and not only do you steal from me but you ask me to make it official ? 
  i mean , i think of it as * `` have you wondered what this tastes like ? 
  try it once !, 
  '' * rather than a place to buy products regularly haha . 
  the prices are n't that horrible if you think of it as a one-time thing . 
   but watching the news yesterday and seeing d\u00edaz say how voting for her is for `` psoe de siempre '' like it 's a good thing was insane to me . 
  the whole support for her is unbelievable . 
  the way that whole wing of the psoe maimed their own party just to prevent a coalition with podemos showed how far they 're willing to go to put their personal positions over political interests . 
  and yet , diaz is still a serious contender for leadership . 
  the amount of backstabbing that took place there , and the fact that they allowed the pp to govern * while running on a campaign based on `` let 's keep them from governing '' * should have taken everyone involved down - and i 'm not saying that sanchez and iglesias played their cards well to be completely fair . 
  rajoy was in one of the worst positions his party has had in any election and still came out on top just by waiting for all his opponents to hang themselves . 
  that 's how shit our current parties are , they had an undefended goal and still scored for the opposing team . 
  and ciudadanos would be a good alternative if only they dropped or relaxed their conservative views . 
  but i 've seen them ignore several key issues ( the gag law , dropping the plan to increase investments in r&d to stop brain drain , their refusal to allow 16-17 year olds to abort without paternal authorization , and some others ) and mainly , it irks me to no end to see that they shoehorn the issue of catalonia and the unity of spain as a red line for practically all interactions with other parties . 
  i 'm not particulary pro-secession but i think we have more important issues to worry about . 
  there 's a chain store in my city called taste of america that carries basically all american food products that are n't common here . 
  food aside , there 's nothing i can think of ... 
  at this point i do n't even know if we 're more or less corrupt than we used to be . 
  like , on the one hand there 's a new scandal every week ... on the other , * there are scandals * . 
  meaning that it seems that corruption seems to be surfacing and being cut down . 
  rajoy has probably seen some shit but i do n't see him being personally interested in taking a part of the cake - unlike aznar or aguirre . 
  he 's still covered for others however , the `` se fuerte '' sms and defense of barbera should n't be acceptable even if he was just protecting his party . 
  i 'm worried about the power plays in the psoe too . 
  if susana diaz manages to get leadership i 'll lose all hopes for the moderate left in this country in the near future . 
  and podemos is making it harder and harder to support them ... 
  yeah i 'm not saying it ca n't be done , just that it rubs me the wrong way that all main candidates are around that age - hillary is 69 , trump is 72 .
