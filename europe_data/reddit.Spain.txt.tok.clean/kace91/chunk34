  el quijote was n't a mandatory read , just excerpts from it , but i actually agree with that choice ( having read it as an adult ) because i do n't think a 14 year old can appreciate it , and forcing it to a 1.000 page tome in old spanish would just make him hate reading . 
  textbooks are the teacher 's choice i think , but we only used just notes philosophy and some `` less important '' subjects ( ethics , physical education , etc. 
  there is no attempt whatsoever to cover up anything in spanish history , as national pride is n't ever taken into account . 
  in fact now that i think of it , i think there is not a single historical figure of which we got a positive view ... perhaps carlos iii was praised as a failed opportunity to have evolved the country , that 's about it . 
   i did n't study the greeks , the romans , the gods , the arab invasion , the arab expulsion , the discovery of america , the colonies , i did n't study the french revolution , the russian revolution , the wwi , the wwii , the fall of the berlin wall , etc. 
  nothing . 
  wtf . 
  your case is definitely not common , where did you study ? 
  we went through all of these at length and depth . 
  they are in the curriculum , i do n't think you can blame the eso reform for that . 
   i found them pretty handy \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  is paris significantly more assholish than other big cities ? 
  i mean , most people in spain say something similar about madrid so i wonder if i would feel at home there . 
  kinda , although i mainly make vr apps for non-gaming purposes . 
  education , architecture tools , marketing campaigns and the like . 
  honestly , i think that the mix of gendered nouns and verb conjugations would make spanish a bitch to learn ( glad i know it by default ) . 
  chinese is cool for ignoring that , and for having meaning built into the script - things like computer being symbol for electric + symbol for brain , it 's like learning puzzles . 
  when we talk about spoken language things are the opposite though . 
  spanish is easy as fuck : just 5 vowel sounds , regular pronunciation , no distinction between b and v or between soft g and j ( the only hard detail is the difference between strong r and the j sound ) . 
  chinese is hell with its tones . 
  ... your river is a decapitated duck held by an eagle ? 
  [ my workplace ] ( http://imgur.com/oqvqok3 ) [ how my workplace looks like at 9 am ( this is spain after all ) ] ( http://imgur.com/jdyaame ) what commute looks like . 
  [ outside ] ( https://www.metromadrid.es/comun/imagenes/metro_en_imagenes/material_movil/tren_3000_2.jpg ) and [ inside ] ( http://induremon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/metro_interior_1.jpg ) [ view from my home 's window ] ( http://imgur.com/49o474u ) [ my living room - just moved , i have n't redecorated so it still looks like an old man 's house ] ( http://imgur.com/0sqka1r ) [ my buddy ] ( http://imgur.com/edelf1t ) [ typical place to go a random regular day after work ] ( http://www.atras-sec.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/100-montaditos2.jpg ) [ what food looks like there ] ( https://385e281c53d80c958c4a-d460ce610c7fad6b3cb1da8c31b5ee8e.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/photos/madrid/wj5lfsiec0b2lnirbdbfpj9v6v0fsmoy.jpg ), 
  i do n't think these kind of communities exist in spain . 
  the closest idea i can think of are [ conventos de clausura , ] ( http://www.abc.es/media/sociedad/2016/01/26/mercedarias-descalzas--620x349.jpg ) , catholic religious orders where the monks or nuns are voluntarily `` jailed '' inside the convent and wo n't have contact with the outside world except for emergencies like going to the doctor . 
  some of them seem kind of ... harsh what can a person expect if they are to break the rule ? 
  i guess they ca n't be warned of their misbehaor since the other person ca n't think they have anything to teach :p, 
  can you expand on that ? 
  what are those rules , or some examples ? 
  i thought we were the only country in the iberian peninsula , but / r/europe taught me otherwise . 
  i know you 're joking , but if any mexican reads that they 'll be mainly offended about you considering them south americans ... 
  they 're quite sensitive about the us claiming the concept of north america for themselves . 
   wrong can we use a different word for these things ? 
  it kind of brings flashbacks . 
  spain has several arabic toponyms that are funnily redundant . 
  a common example is the bridge of alcantara , from `` al qantarat '' , which means the bridge . 
  so we have the bridge of the bridge . 
  at least in western europe , the points about lgbt rights , the rise of religion and the value of science are n't at stake at all . 
  if anything , i 'm only seeing science being attacked by green advocates - gmos , complete rejection of nuclear energy , `` chemicals are bad for you '' , `` wifi signals give you cancer '' , all that stuff . 
  i am yet to meet a single climate change denier in all my life , and the few people that i 've met that are strongly religious ( meaning no sex till marriage , against homosexuality , creationist , etc ) are first generation immigrants from south america ; their children have already adopted local values instead . 
  as for censorship , i think the uk has different values than continental europe , specially in regards of state vigilantism . 
  i still think we are going to see some changes to our definition of censorship in the fight against fake news and viral bullshit . 
  as for immigration and european sentiment i ca n't tell . 
  spain appears to be a bubble right now ( well , iberia , since our portuguese homies are n't biting either ) , but the sentiment in other countries is indeed worrying . 
  if you 're coming to spain for a long term stay ( erasmus student or similar ) do n't rent a house without physically seeing it first . 
  if that is n't possible , at the very least have a native check the ad . 
  when i was looking for a place to rent it was all full of amazing fake ads , most of which were n't even real spanish ( just google translated gibberish ) . 
  how are littering and snow related ? 
  it 's probably obvious but i 've never seen snow lasting more than 2 days so i ca n't really tell . 
  your cringe-worthy is our above average, 
  i 'd go with minos ( in greek mythology he 's the son of europe ) . 
  those sound like pokemon names ... 
   oooh  i 'm an alien  an illegal alien  i 'm an englishman in benidorm ... ( i 'm sorry , i had to do it ), 
  no matter how intensely our political views collide , or how different our worldview is , we as spaniards stand united : * you do n't put chorizo in a goddamned paella * . 
  that aside , i think we 're cool with pretty much anything . 
  some idiots in the field of marketing try to copy the us and make `` millenials '' a thing here , even though nobody uses the term ; you only see it in ads and in some newspapers that try to cather to the young . 
  other than that , nothing really specific . 
  i meant that the incident * i described * took place several years ago . 
  so it could n't possibly have been affected by the events mentioned in the linked article , which happened later . 
  i do n't think that 's the case , as this particular incident took place several years ago ... 
  i found germany to be more socially regressive than i expected . 
  for context , in spain we pretty much group all of central and northern europe as `` countries more advanced than we are '' , both economically and socially . 
  visiting a friend in berlin , i was surprised to find out that gay marriage is n't legal , and night clubs have far more `` macho culture '' for example , where men act much more manly . 
  the most extreme culture shock came a night when my friend 's friend joined us for a party . 
  he was a middle eastern software engineer . 
  we chatted about our common field on the way to a night club , and once we got there we got told that the club was full and they did n't accept anyone else . 
  so we go back to the street , i propose to go find a different place . 
  the middle eastern guy just says `` nah i feel tired . . 
  i 'm gon na go home now . 
  but you should try getting in again after i go '' . 
  i did n't even realize the implication until he went home , my friend and i entered the club again , and suddenly there was no problem and we could enter the place just fine . 
  no one said anything explicitly , but we all knew what just happened . 
  the five eyes working together , that 's not scary at all :p, 
  i do n't think anything can top [ the bravery of our president facing journalists in press conferences ] ( http://233grados.lainformacion.com/.a/6a00e552985c0d8833017d427ef743970c-500wi ), 
   it 's that , if someone was known to be jewish by their peers , would they be treated differently ? 
  not at all . 
  it would be like saying that you 're sikh , taoist , rastafarian or neo-pagan ; meaning that meeting them would be an unusual encounter and there could be some curious questions . 
  there are however some traces of `` jews control the banks and the system '' among the conspiracy crowd , but it 's not due to their racism , they 're just unconsciously buying into the propaganda when they search for info about the illuminati and so on . 
  most of them are militantly against all forms of xenophobia , and would never be caught dead being or appearing so . 
  i remember watching a guy in a supermarket with a swastika tattooed on the back of his head . 
  i must have been 10 years old or something . 
  that 's about it ... 
   maybe i 'm getting old , but i do n't really see them anymore . 
  it might be because i 'm younger but i 've never crossed paths with any of those groups . 
  i know the ultra sur and frente atl\u00e9tico exist but that 's about it . 
  madrid has [ the 4 towers , ] ( http://www.turismomadrid.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cuatro_torres_business_area.jpg ) which on their own are nice but stick out like a sore thumb . 
  just out of curiosity : are you remarkably informed about the law over your compatriots , or is it common for swedes to know the rules to that extent ? 
  in our current society , it is a fair assumption that a regular person needs a job to survive . 
  thus , for a lot of workers , losing their job could mean being unable to pay the bills , rent , feeding their families , etc. 
  in those conditions , no fair deal can be stablished between worker and employer . 
  it is not a fair negotiation if one of the parts has a gun pointing to the other 's head . 
  i would agree to the abolishment of worker protections if we had universal income that took away the workers ' vulnerability . 
  when survival is n't on the line , then workers can actually negotiate their conditions fairly . 
  if it was n't enough with the moral principle , i 'm not even convinced that the so called workers flexibility is beneficial for the economy . 
  it is true that the flexibility given to companies might make it easier to run a business ; but it also has detrimental effects . 
  some that come to mind : - it increases insecurity among workers , which in turn can discourage spending - if you can be laid off at will , you 're much more likely to save and avoid unnecessary expenses , and that refusal to spend money reduces the sales of the businesses you would have otherwise bought from . 
  - it discourages people from having kids ( a pregnant woman or a worker with kids wo n't be as freely available to the company and could be fired as a result , so people would avoid it if they ca n't risk getting fired ) . 
  - it makes workers fearful of standing up for fear of drawing the bad kind of attention to them , which discourages proactiveness and innovation . 
  - i believe out of personal experience that workers that feel protected and safe produce far better results than those who are stressed and fearful . 
  well , most of the minority of franco supporters usually fall among two different categories : - the first one is basically what i mentioned about my grandmother .
