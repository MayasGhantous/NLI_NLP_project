tldr : poland wants to replace their 50 years old [ s-125 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s-125_neva/pechora ) , [ s-200 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s-200_%28missile%29 ) and [ kub ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2k12_kub ) [ surface to air missiles ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surface-to-air_missile ) with something made in this millennium and not made by russia . 
   although countries should not have such little regard for their commitments they will make agreements without any intention of even making the most basic effort to meet them . 
  but they do , the nato agreement has never been breached , the important thing from my previous post is that any document that is n't [ ratified ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ratification ) by the legislative is n't an agreement between countries , it 's just the personal position of the people who sign it . 
  ( and that 's understood by anyone who signed the document ) . 
   according to projections done by europe , the eu 's population will grow to 520 million in 2035 and then lower the 505 million in 2060 . 
  so a population decline of 15 million people in 25 years is what i would call , ` couple million ' . 
  your data is 7 years old . 
  in spain in 7 years we went from `` emerging power '' to `` poor man of europe '' for example , it says that our population will grow to 52million , well , since 2010 it 's being going down by 200,000 a year ( from a maximum of 47 ) . 
   wo n't happen . 
  there will not be more for you , because everything is going to lower . 
  less people = less customers . 
  certainly there wo n't be more ipads nor more bmws per capita , but there will be more arable land , more beaches , better housing , more fishes and more energy ( both hydro/solar/whatever hydrocarbons we have ) . 
   europe 's population is going to shrink a couple million . 
  [ spain 's population will go down 6 millions in 50 years according to our always too optimistic government . 
  if those babies were born today in 6 years they 'll be 6 , so they would n't be able to solve your problem . 
  really , the baby boomers will be the end of us , or at least of our social states . 
  yeah , [ i understand that ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_decline ) , i simply disagree with the idea of keeping the population stable , both for egotistical reasons ( more for me ) and for ecological/social ones . 
  i also understand that population decline causes problems with the social security , but the current systems are already unsustainable and in any case the current unemployment rate tells us that most of us younglings are n't really needed . 
  that 's why japan invest in robots . 
  but really , [ we ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_european_union ) have almost twice the population of the [ usa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states ) in [ less than half the territory ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geography_of_the_european_union ) , so maybe we should use a solution that does n't add more people . 
   it 's bad for a country if it 's birthrate drops below 2,1 . 
  it means that there will be less people in a country and that people , on average , will be older . 
  that 's not necessarily bad , that 's just different . 
  in fact depopulation is ecological and can mean a higher standard of living ( ie : with half the population our yards would be twice as large , we 'll have more food , we 'll need less energy ... ) . 
   members agreed to it in the 90s iirc . 
  sure , but we should n't mix [ declarations ] ( https://treaties.un.org/pages/overview.aspx?path=overview/definition/page1_en.xml#declarations ) and [ treaties ] ( https://treaties.un.org/pages/overview.aspx?path=overview/definition/page1_en.xml#treaties ) : a declaration :  the term is often deliberately chosen to indicate that the parties do not intend to create binding obligations but merely want to declare certain aspirations . 
  declarations can however also be treaties in the generic sense intended to be binding at international law . 
  it is therefore necessary to establish in each individual case whether the parties intended to create binding obligations . 
  ascertaining the intention of the parties can often be a difficult task and these agreements are always contained in declarations , ( [ example pdf of the wales declaration ] ( https://www.google.es/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0cceqfjaa&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.gov.uk%2fgovernment%2fuploads%2fsystem%2fuploads%2fattachment_data%2ffile%2f351406%2fwales_summit_declaration.pdf&amp;ei=zedrvmg6gm_xasc1gvgo&amp;usg=afqjcnfachkrf7xp-p5ybg79ygr_g-z5tg&amp;sig2=edgprqpozklzml-iy-rr5q&amp;bvm=bv.78597519,d.d2s ) ) that do not try to impose that intention to create binding obligations . 
  also technically they are n't made by states , but by their executive powers because in all democracies a treaty has to be ratified by the legislative power and this text does n't even have a ratification process . 
  thus we must conclude that they are signed mostly as a memento of the event , an event with huge political relevance but no juridical one . 
  ** tldr : if nato wants to impose the 2 % rule they have to modify the treaties , not sign the international equivalent of the guest book ; otherwise they are only guidelines . 
  exactly , the [ nato treaty ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_17120.htm ? ), 
  says nothing about spending targets and the only reference to a 2 % gdp requirement comes from a non-binding pledge made in the [ wales summit of this year ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140906/defreg/309060023/nato-allies-commit-defense-boost ) . 
  did you remove your flair ? 
   a esto habr\u00eda que sumarle la parte de la poblaci\u00f3n en edad de voto de los habitantes de crimea , territorio controlado por los rebeldes y los refugiados en rusia that 's where i was going : before 2013 , there was a close to 50 % -50 % divide between the pro russian and the pro eu vote , so when putin accepted crimea into the russian federation he altered that % , both directly by reducing the number of voters of the party of the regions in ukraine ( literally by removing crimean voters from the equation ) and indirectly by disenfranchising part of the ukrainians who care neither for russia nor for ukraine ( but who did n't want a war ) . 
  well , they are at war , so it makes sense that many either could n't vote , were n't allowed to vote or did n't want to vote , both in the rebel held areas and in the frontier zones ( places like kharkiv or dnepropetrovsk ) . 
  you can not simply assume what any of them would have voted ( specially by extrapolating from pre war data ) , as both the borders and the situation has changed ( i 'm sure that many people in the east wanted to speak in russian , but did most of them want a war ? 
  did they agree with the euromaidan 's repression ? 
  the polite men ? 
  who knows ? ) . 
  finally , while i thank you for writing in spanish ( and your spanish is quite good ) , this is an english speaking forum , so more people would understand you in english . 
   ( former party of regions ) - 7,6 % - pro-russian so putin got crimea but lost ukraine .
