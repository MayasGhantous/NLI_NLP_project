  is it because dvb-t requires a larger antenna ? 
  not really , most illegal immigrants ( from south america , morocco and asia ) come through barajas airport , and simply overstay their visas , and those do n't enter illegally . 
  in fact the total number of immigrants in spain keeps [ going down ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_spain#currently ) , partially due to some of them obtaining spanish nationality , but mostly due to re-emigration and return to their origin countries , due to our marvelous economy . 
  certainly not a role model , but they are the best example of what a new founded country can do when faced with an existential threat . 
   the cost of tanks , combat aircraft and frigates does not depend on gdp per capita . 
  no , but if you multiply gdp per capita by the population ( `` capita '' , if you will ) what do you get ? 
   also , most south america 's countries have been independent decades longer than us . 
  you 've been independent for 24 years , in the same amount of time israel ( similar population as the baltics ) went from nothing to defeating the combined forces of syria , egypt and jordan . 
   we 're one of the few ones actually spending  2 % of gdp in military defence . 
  and you have nothing to show for it , beyond some second hand cv-90 and patria pasi . 
  maybe you should question yourself how was that money spent ( 2 % of $ 170 billions ( [ the gdp of the three combined ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_states#statistics ) ) should have been enough for some pretty decent forces ) . 
  i understand that you ca n't create a military in a day , but is n't it weird how under armed the baltics are ? 
  between the three of them they have a population of [ 6.2 millions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_states#statistics ) ( larger than finland or norway ) , they have a [ gdp per capita ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28nominal%29_per_capita ) higher than most of south america and they have access to all weapon markets , yet between the three of them they have : * 0 tanks * 0 combat aircraft * 0 frigates really , it 's understandable to ask your neighbors for help but if they believe that they are in imminent danger they should also prepare their defenses , otherwise it gets hard to believe them . 
  a friend of mine got a bottle to the head in [ d\u00fan laoghaire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d%c3%ban_laoghaire%e2%80%93rathdown ) for being too dark skinned ( and the garda did nothing ) .

   britain went to great lengths to help anyone that was resisting the axis . 
  thanks for the help against franco and his friends . 
  an anarchist web ( the linked one ) calls it an anti-anarchist operation . 
  the official web of the police and most media just calls it a detention of people who , according to the police , belong to a criminal organization and give the name of the organization . 
   yes this dumb american does understand sorry if i sounded condescending , not my intention . 
  and yeah , we grow up watching yellow buses and crown victoria taxis/police cars so when we find one some find them interesting , it 's kinda like arriving to london and finding the first double decker bus , not the most memorable thing ever , but still gets a photo or two . 
  literally the first bus photo i found on imgur ( that one is from argentina , but i 've seen similar ones in spain ) . 
  of course we have school buses , but they are just [ normal intercity buses ] ( http://i.imgur.com/h5llw.jpg ) of different sizes , not special yellow buses . 
  also , europe is kinda big , so chances are that the answer varies a lot between countries . 
  while there 's clearly an inexcusable failure in shooting at a fishing vessel and in letting a civilian ship into the training area , during training it 's common to purposely miss and shoot around the target ( as obviously that way the drone last longer ) . 
  greece invested a token amount ( 20 millions ) before the crisis to be part of a high tech project in what 's seem as the future of aviation . 
  for comparison , during the same time frame the german armed forces have spent close to 1000 millions in the [ eads barracuda ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eads_barracuda ) ( that crashed ) , and the [ eurohawk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northrop_grumman_rq-4_global_hawk#eurohawk ) ( that was eventually cancelled ) . 
  the comments in this thread are n't much better ( towards indians , italians and russians ), 
  the [ tornado adv ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/panavia_tornado_adv ) was the air defense variant and it was n't removed from british service until the eurofighter was considered advanced enough . 
  most large european countries like to keep two different fighters : germany , italy and uk : tornado and eurofighter ( uk and italy are replacing the tornado with the f-35 ) , france : rafale and m-2000 , poland : f-16 and mig-29 , spain : f-18 and eurofighter that has two advantages : * you change half the planes every 15 years instead of all at the same time . 
  ( thus you always have some new ones and some that actually work ) . 
  * if there 's a problem with a model you do n't suddenly lose all of the af at the same time . 
  it 's so fucking great we do n't even need that w\u00f6rk und money thing everybody talks about . 
  at least people remember you , asturias and cantabria get no sun either and we are just that unexplored thing between galicia and euskadi . 
  the fact that both olivenza and the savage islands are wrongly situated tells how important the whole issue is for both sides ( most spaniards ca n't name all of our [ plazas de soberan\u00eda ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plazas_de_soberan%c3%ada ) nor locate gibraltar either , but muh territory ) . 
  libya ? 
  egypt ? 
  the balkans ? 
  yeah , the only possible option would be to create something like the us military , with both national guards and the proper federal military . 
  following on that , there would be an important difference , as the eu military would be a large defensive one to fend off any invasion of the eu ( with nukes , aircraft carriers and the like ) while every country would keep small and deployable forces to be used how they see fit ( from pissing off the argies to peace keeping in car ) . 
  but then there 's the question : who would die for the eu ? 
  will a german soldier be willing to die defending the falklands ? 
  a british one defending mayotte ? 
  a latvian defending ceuta ? 
  and unless the answer to that is yes , no country will renounce to their military . 
  i 've always loved : `` o follamos todos o la puta al r\u00edo '' ( either we all fuck her or we throw the whore into the river ) .

   outraged spain hits back where 's the outrage and how did we hit back ? 
  according to the article we just asked the french ambassador for their official position , and some spanish trade organizations said that what was done was bad . 
  dude looks like oberyn martell . 
   was in spain only for a very short period . 
  [ serhane ben abdelmajid ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/serhane_ben_abdelmajid ) lived for at least 14 years in spain . 
  [ i would n't call them chill ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_madrid_train_bombings ), 
   there is a reason why italy is a contributor to the eu budget and spain is a net receiver . 
  technically true , but nowadays [ spain pays around 11,100 millions and gets 11,500 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budget_of_the_european_union#eu-28_contributions_.282014.29 ) , so feel free to tell me where to send the whooping 9 $ that i 'm nefariously stealing . 
  really , the criticism made sense in the nineties , but since the 2000 's enlargements , the euromoneys left spain . 
  our industry represent a larger share of our gdp than italy 's ( [ spain 26 % ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/spain/gdp_composition_by_sector.html ) , [ italy 24,4 % ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/italy/gdp_composition_by_sector.html ) ) . 
  we may not have a finmeccanica or a ferrari , so it gets harder to point at a clear name , but , for example , [ we are the second largest car manufacturer in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_motor_vehicle_production ) ( behind germany , but beyond france , uk or italy ) . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  i ask because what i 've read is that the negotiations should be with uk , as the uk is the member of the eu , not gibraltar ; but i 've never read about a veto if the whole uk does n't join . 
  i do agree with your point , but one of the largest ammunition manufacturers in europe is owned by the governments of your country and norway , so please cut the `` everyone else is evil '' , all our countries are equally rotten . 
  yeah , [ i mean nammo , who recently opened offices in uae ] ( https://nammo.com/news-and-events/news/nammo-has-established-an-office-in-abu-dhabi/ ) , surely to sell doves and flowers . 
  also , finland just sold [ patria amvs to uae ] ( http://www.janes.com/article/57535/uae-orders-patria-amvs ) . 
  it 's true that many work in agriculture , but i would n't go as far as to say that they are necessary , as there 's an unemployment level of 29 % in andaluc\u00eda ( where most of those greenhouses are ) . 
  yeah , france always had a bigger relationship with morocco than we did , so you have a more heterogeneous society , but in france it happened all through the whole 20th century and here it happened in ten years , so we get more immigrants ( 13,8 % vs 11,6 % ) while you get more citizens of non-french ancestry . 
  it 's also important how while there are many moroccans in spain there are barely any algerian , who are a huge part of the number of muslims in france , so that also affects the perception of the situation . 
  the link is in spanish , so of course it 's my bad if it was n't understood , but if you go a little lower you 'll see that around 1/3 came from latin-america , 1/3 from europe and , 1/3 from the rest of the world , and out of that last third around 1 million came from africa , and of those , 775,000 are from morocco . 
  it does n't happen as much in spain because we 've been bribing morocco since the nineties , and i mean everyone there , from the politicians ( development help ) , to the policemen in the frontier and also because morocco itself is in a better situation than turkey . 
  but tbh we had a similar situation during the last decade , when we got around [ 4 million extra immigrants ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/inmigraci%c3%b3n_en_espa%c3%b1a#evoluci.c3.b3n_de_la_migraci.c3.b3n_en_espa.c3.b1a ) and according to the eu it was a local issue so we did n't get any meaningful help , except constant criticism from other eu countries whenever anything bad happened . 
  yep , the idiots legitimized the regime they tried to destroy , while forcing a much needed purge of francoist officers . 
  for those who do n't know of the event , it 's very similar to the soviet coup of 1991 . 
  i 'm reading about it and apparently san ant\u00f3n or san antonio festivity varies a lot between spanish regions , in madrid for example it 's apparently pretty common among catholics , but here in asturias not so much . 
  we do ? 
  but the risk of bail-in if you keep a deposit is also higher than zero . 
  none , because greece does n't have the funds and the migrants wo n't stay there , but that 's what both / u/lolkac and `` the eu '' of op 's article implies that should happen if the greek border towards the rest of europe were closed . 
  and for that greece would need much more money , like 10b a year . 
  over five years gives less than a 100 millions per year , or a hundred $ per migrant/year at a million migrants per year . 
  do you think saving , controlling , housing and feeding a person for a year cost 100 $ ? 
   then you can \u00b4 t pay to a certain amount of money in cash any more that 's already happening in spain :  payment may not be made in cash when one of the parties acts as employer or professional , for amounts equal to or greater than 2,500 euros [ source ] ( http://www.agenciatributaria.es/aeat.internet/en_gb/inicio/_componentes_/_le_interesa_conocer/_relacionados_/nota_informativa.shtml ),

  yeah , but there 's [ al-nusra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-nusra_front ) , that is n't much better . 
  the article does n't say that all of them will be aircraft carrier fighter jets , just that uk is going to buy 138 fighters . 
  i presume that 's just the f-35 order , both land based for the raf and svtol for the royal navy , [ and that number has been known since 2006 and is unrelated to isis or syria . 
  ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6219122.stm ), 
  or maybe it 's because they are n't scared of their military , so why not use them if they ever need to .
