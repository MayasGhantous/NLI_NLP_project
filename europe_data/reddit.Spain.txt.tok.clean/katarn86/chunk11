  for example , here in spain whenever there 's a terrorist alert it 's common to see soldiers patrolling through the rail lines , ports and other infrastructure ( [ and sometimes even train stations ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2004/12/29/album/1104311817_910215.html#1104311817_910215_0000000005 ) ) or when there 's a large fire we send soldiers to help the firefighters . 
  eta please , not `` the basques '' . 
  and yeah , partially because of eta , but also because of [ micg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moroccan_islamic_combatant_group ) , [ aqim ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-qaeda_in_the_islamic_maghreb ) and other groups . 
  according to wikipedia , raf killed 34 , while ira killed 1823 and eta 829 . 
  in any case , the three of them pale when compared to what was done by non state actors during wwii and what happens even today in many places through the world , so the idea of a `` most famous terrorist organization from 20th century '' becomes moot . 
  i agree with your point on how wars are now won with technology and not with steel , but nowadays the west is n't the only source of technology , and china is more than willing to do business with russia , and up to a point , so are south korea , israel or india . 
   they never had a prayer at matching the us again true , they 've tried to postpone the unavoidable by refurbishing old systems and fudging numbers , but the truth is that india has more t-90 and su-30 than them , and that their only scary thing are their nukes . 
   canada definitely has troubles even modernizing it 's small army , how can russia afford the re-militarization ? 
  basically because canada spends its money in social services , [ so their people have a long and prosperous life ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_life_expectancy ) while russia buys sexy ships trying to one-up the largest economy in the world . 
  also , russia inherited most soviet military factories and personnel ( russia has 3 million workers in their military industrial complex , most of them public workers ) , so as they already have the means , and they have to pay their salaries anyway , it 's easier for putin to sell the project than it would be for harper . 
  most of this has been public knowledge for years , as the russian navy is currently acquiring only [ 10 borei ssbn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/borei_class_submarine ) and [ 12 yasen ssn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yasen-class_submarine ) , and those are n't enough for the whole fleet ( specially the 12 yasen ) , so obviously some older [ oscar ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oscar-class_submarine ) , [ akulas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/akula-class_submarine ) , [ deltas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delta-class_submarine ) and maybe [ sierras ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sierra_class_submarine ) will be kept for some years . 
  for comparison , the usn currently has [ 14 ohio ssbn and four ssgn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ohio-class_submarine ) , and 39 [ los angeles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/los_angeles-class_submarine ) , 3 [ seawolf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seawolf-class_submarine ) and 12 [ virginia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/virginia-class_submarine ) ssn . 
  [ guadarrama 's tunnel is 28km long ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guadarrama_tunnel ) , so they must mean road tunnel , and even then madrid has a 10km long tunnel ( the m30 ) . 
  in any case , kudos to portugal , as better infrastructure is always good news . 
   there should be more spaniards like you . 
  while it 's true you wo n't find many pro-independentist spaniards in places like madrid , there 's lots of people in other spanish regions who think catalonians should have a right to have a referendum , either due to the belief in self determination or simply because many of us think that question should be answered once and for all , as it 's impossible to plan for our future if we do n't even know who wants to be part of our future . 
  once i 've said that , i 'll also want to congratulate catalonians , as you have been wiser than mas and have seen through his deception and have voted erc ( i still think mas will never really go for independence , only erc will ), 
  as someone from asturias , i wish that somehow the workers are able to continue their work , either as a subsidiary of other company or as their own trademark , but due to our stupid legal system , they 'll probably end all unemployed , even though the demand for low cost transportation is huge in spain and there 's not a single mainstream spanish motorbike manufacturer . 
  there are no spanish policemen in catalonia . 
  while downvoting dissenting opinions is a big problem in reddit , / r/europe has it even worse due to the fact that most of us do n't use english as our main language , so lots of people consider it perfectly reasonable to downvote an opinion instead of trying to write a rebuttal . 
  and yes , it sucks . 
  in this thread : people who do n't understand [ reddiquette ] ( http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette ) : please dont : downvote opinions just because you disagree with them . 
  the down arrow is for comments that add little or nothing to the discussion . 
  yes , but twenty years ago , most polish women could n't easily take a bus to germany and ask for an abortion in the first hospital they could find . 
  it 's interesting how a major british newspaper mixes the european union and the [ european court of human rights ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_court_of_human_rights ) , when those are entirely separated organisms . 
  also , of course the eu courts hear about more violations of human rights now than five years ago , as three of the four worst offenders , according to that list , entered the eu exactly five years ago . 
  edit : poland entered the eu in 2004 , not 2007 . 
  the european union . 
  prevention is always more desirable than abortion , i 'm sure no one disputes that , but the problem is what to do when prevention has n't been enough , or even when the woman was n't willing to sex . 
  also , restricting abortion in poland will cause a boom in abortion clinics in neighbor countries , for those women who can pay , and the return of barbaric practices for those women who can not . 
  woah !, 
  an appeal to the founding fathers !, 
  what are we now ? 
  americans ? 
  also , while i 'm not an expert , i seem to recall that the founding fathers , monnet and schuman , were n't really worried about debt , as peace in europe and rebuilding the continent were seen as more pressing matters . 
  well , the thing is i 've never said catalonia would n't be able to pay for those pensions , i only said it would be hard and expensive , specially because while future demographic projections are bad for the whole of europe , they are specially bad for catalonia . 
  maybe i 'm not understanding something , as i do n't speak catalonian , but , according to your data , would n't catalonia have obtained 26,003 millions as ss ( quadre 4 , adding the different ss concepts ) while , according to quadre 5 , the spanish ss spended 26,476 millions in catalonia ? 
  also , it 's interesting how in your first post in this thread you said i was spreading missinformation , then in the second you said i must be wrong , without basing your assertion , and in your third post you said that my official data of 2012 was besides the point , while you post 2009 data . 
  please do n't use charged words if you want to keep a civil debate . 
  [ the process is initiated by the commision ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legislature_of_the_european_union ) and the process require the intervention of both the council and the parliament . 
  this is the main legislative body , as most laws have to be approved by the council . 
  in fact the whole history of the eu is based on the idea of progressive cession of competences from the council ( the constituent countries ) to the parliament ( who represent the european citizens ), 
  there 's already an european institution where countries are represented as equals with legislative , fiscal and control competences : [ council of the european union ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_the_european_union ) . 
  according to the [ spanish social security ] ( http://www.seg-social.es/internet_1/estadistica/est/pensiones_y_pensionistas/pensiones_contributivas_en_vigor/por_comunidades_aut_nomas_y_provincias/estc_005357 ) , right now there are 1.606.353 receivers of public pensions in catalonia , making catalonia the autonomous community with the higher number of receivers ( even though the population of andalucia is higher ) so no , the catalonian pension system would n't improve with independence . 
  it 's true that catalonia have higher salaries and lower unemployment than some other regions , but it 's also true that due to the catalonian economic boom in the 60 's -80 's and the 60 's baby boom there 's right now a lot of people reaching retirement age who , due to those high salaries have a right to a pretty large pension , and it 's those people who would cause an imbalance in the eventual catalonian pension system . 
  as i said , those are just the numbers i 've heard , ( i think they distributed the debt as a percentage of gdp and not population , but you 're right , i 'm not sure what way would be fairer ) regarding the public companies , the largest ones are those that provide public services and utilities , so i think the fair thing would be that you kept those that are on catalonia and we 'll keep the remaining ones . 
  also , regarding the military , while it 's true you 've paid for your share of the equipment , it 's also true that the transfer of military assets requires the agreement of the usa and you , at least in the begging wo n't be in nato , so usa will probably not agree to a transfer of , for example , patriot missiles , aegis frigates or combat fighters . 
  but the point is moot , as mas have already said they do n't want to have an army . 
  and yeah , regarding the eu , i 'm not sure if that 's a pro or a con . 
  the main pros of catalonian independence would be that they 'll have economic and political institutions better adapted to their needs and would have fulfilled a wish that part of their population have had for centuries . 
  the list of cons would depend on the conditions of the secession but i think would include : the loss of its place in the eu and the euro ( spain will veto the accession ) , the loss of some of their largest companies ( some have already said their market is spain , so they can not afford the customs ) , their obligation to affront a fair share of the spanish debt ( someone have said around 20 % ) the need to establish a pension system ( that would be woefully expensive , as the catalonian population is quite old ) and a military ( now payed by spain ) and , depending on the conditions , they may also have to pay for the relocation of those who live in catalonia but want to be spaniards . 
  i wo n't say if catalonians should become independent ( it 's none of my business ) but it wo n't be cheap . 
  so a former vice chairman of moody 's tells us we should destroy the euro and we decide his word is suddenly worth something ? 
  / r/europe , you used to be better that that !, 
   but i 'm sure you guys are smarter and wo n't start killing each other for stupid historical reasons . 
  do n't worry , right now both the catalonian and the spanish governments are `` best friends ever '' behind doors and it 's only when they speak to their electorate that they remember those stupid historical reasons . 
  thank you for your post , sometimes we all tend to lose objectivity when speaking about the current crisis , and yes , it 's true the situation in spain is worse than it was years ago , but comparing to eastern europe and north africa we are still a bunch wealthy fucks who spend their time moaning because we ca n't afford the new iphone . 
  on the other hand , it 's sad that we , as an european society , seem hellbent in becoming a new serbia instead of being another france or sweden . 
  yes , of course we have to cut waste expending and yes , we should export more , but your claim that 5.640.000 persons should simply `` go find a job '' is simply preposterous and undermines the hardships caused by this whole situation . 
  do you know there 's more unemployed people in spain than there 's finnish people ? 
  i agree it 's offensive to wear that , but it must be said that this photo is from 2010 : [ el pa\u00eds in spanish ] ( http://elpais.com/diario/2010/04/13/espana/1271109616_850215.html ) and according to that newspaper , the cop was investigated for that . 
  regarding those investigations , i 'm not really sure what will happen , as libya does n't have a police system and the militias will probably try to blame each other in their struggle for power . 
  also , yeah , sometimes downvotes misteriously appear , specially in r/europe because it 's easier to click an arrow than to write a reply in a launguage that it 's not yours . 
  of course , i did n't claim all libyans should be lumped together for those acts , i was just refering to the fact that among all muslims , libyans should n't have any animosity towards america . 
  yes , of course the egyptians have a right to be angry , after all , the usa have maintained a puppet government in egypt for decades , so i think the flag burning may be reasonable , but what did the americans do to the libyans ? 
  kill their despotic leader and help they attain democracy !, 
  that 's some terrible act and a enough reason to storm a consulate !, 
  and yes , of course it 's unfair to group 1.000.000.000 persons for the action of some hundreds , but you should understand that after all , everyone who commented in those threads is absolutely powerless and the worse thing they are going to do is just that ( that 's the main reason i think a direct democracy ca n't work , sometimes we just become angry and make terrible decisions , like , storming a consulate for no real reason ) also , regarding the whole situation i think most americans thought the usa was redeeming itself for iraq and afghanistan by helping democracy grow in north africa and they have now seem those dreams shattered and that 's the cause of that 's anger , the feeling that their conception of the world was wrong . 
  aq kills four american citizens , including the main representative of the usa in libya during 9/11 and some americans decide to write some comments in a webpage . 
  one is an act of war , the other is a peaceful expression of angst . 
  how are those acts not different ? 
  yes , i understand the reaction of reddit was n't pc but , really , you ca n't really expect reasonable behavior under those circumstances . 
  you are right . 
  and it 's quite a sight !, 
  2:46 is the government debt level of the eurozone really 18,2 % of our gdp ? 
  the wikipedia article i linked in my previous post explains what the nazis wanted to do in eastern europe and it included the death of hundreds of millions of persons mostly through famine and the enslavement of the remaining ones for use as peasants . 
  that was the plan for the east and why i 'm glad germany lost the war . 
  also , in the 40 's it was technically possible , inhuman beyond comprehension , but possible . 
  in my country 52 % of the youths are unemployed , that 's almost 2.000.000 of youths ready to embrace any ideology that offers them some future , so no , i do n't think we 'll relive the xix century riots , we 'll probably go directly to the xx 's wars !, 
  ww2 was pretty obvious to everyone and the nazi plan is common knowledge [ generalplan ost ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generalplan_ost ), 
  i really hope his comment was sarcastic . 
  anti-belorussian content ? 
  i 'm sorry , but / r/europe is a north vs south circlejerk , belorussia is n't even on the radar, 
  i do n't always agree with norrsken , but while she tends to generalize , as we all do , it 's always important to hear the other side in a debate , also , i 'm not really sure calling us southerners populist is really worse than calling the northerners greedy nazies, 
  your perspective is quite interesting , in fact it sounds exactly like the way some spaniards distrust the french because they are bigger and because napoleon . 
  regarding the portuguese-uk relationship , you are right , you saw them as allies while they treated portugal like a mere interest , but well , maybe that 's why our empires disappeared while their grew . 
  i think the gdp estimate of spain is rigged , as in the last five years a sector that represented almost 20 % of our economy has disappeared , yet our gdp have growth, 
  do n't worry , half of my country agrees with you , hell , they kicked out a king just to add some purple !, 
  yes , the flag looks great ( imho ) , but we 're the springfield and shelbyville of europe , we do n't like each other even though we do n't even know why !, 
  regarding an `` iberian union '' i think it wo n't ever be possible as you 'll never accept madrid as a capital , the same way we wo n't accept lisbon , but it would be nice if we could cooperate in other areas , like a iberian [ eu battlegroup ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eu_battlegroup ), 
  [ according to this link in spanish , ] ( http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20120510/bankia/524266.shtml ) they own 12 % of iag ( british airways and iberia ) and you are right , that should be worth a lot, 
  yes , of course they should pay for being gullible , and i think they are already paying , as one year ago they bought the shares at 3.75 $ and today they are at 0.70 , so they , lied by their government , have already lost 80 % of their investment . 
  the good thing though is that right now the goverment could simply rebuy those shares at market values , but what would it do then ? 
  simply sell the bank assets and liquidate the bank ? 
  if they tried they would n't get enough to even pay the deposits , so every single creditor of bankia would have to bear the losses . 
  regarding the swedish bank save of the nineties , due to your previous comments in thoses topics i 've already read about it , and while exemplary , i think there 's a huge difference between your situation and ours , as you could solve your problem with 11 billions of dollars , 4 % of your gdp while we would need something like a trillion , and trust me , we do n't have a trillion , and i 'm not sure there 's anyone willing to lend us one ( it would also double our public debt , making a private problem public and socializing the loses ) finally , i agree the ez should demand shares , the problem is that right now , the real value of bankia , cam , catalunya caixa , banco de valencia and ccm is negative , they are all economic zombies , they keep moving due to accounting tricks , but no one would want those shares !, 
  personally i think the banks should fall and their assets used to pay the deposits , workers and lenders , their ceos should be beheaded for treason and every single politician that allowed this to happen should be banned from ever having a public employ and most should also be imprisoned . 
  trust me , i have a huge problem with banksters and as i say i think they should pay , but something tells me my proposed course of action would probably cause ww3 , as every single bank in the world would then demand reprisals against my country . 
  the problem with demanding collateral in the case of bankia , lies in the fact that it was formed by a group of public and politically controlled cajas and they were only privatized when bubble bursted , so i 'm not really sure it 's fair to blame the current shareholders , as they are mostly small savers who now know they were lied by the spanish central bank about the solvency of bankia and whose savings have already mostly dissapeared . 
  oth it must be said that the spanish government tried to improve the situation by injecting 4500 millions of $ in bankia via frob , and it now owns 49 % of the shares , but those investors were scamed badly .
