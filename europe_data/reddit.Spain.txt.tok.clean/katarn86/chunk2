  also , the [ dogc is also published in spanish ] ( http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/portaldogc?newlang=es_es ) , and while i understand your reasons , i guess that more people here understand spanish than catalan ( obviously english would be ideal , but neither the boe nor the dogc write in english ) . 
   killing them [ why would you do that ] ( http://i.imgur.com/op17c5e.jpg ) ? 
  [ baka !, 
  i 'm alright , but hot women keep trying to [ kiss me ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lfdvkob.jpg ) , i should go to the winchester until everything blows over . 
   the legislation requires a person accused of homophobia to prove their innocence wat ? 
  as long as your antivirus is updated you have nothing to fear from us . 
  nope , that would be barcenas , or maybe pujol ( we have many of those ) . 
  we should close the guadarrama tunnels for at least 28 weeks . 
  damn , that 's not laziness , that 's advanced not-giving-a-fuck . 
  this one is an impostor , instead of presents he brings secret deals and money laundering . 
  sorry , but no exceptions . 
  you are as responsible for this situation as the average liberian is and here in / r/europe people keep saying that we should quarantine them and shoot the ones that get close to eu . 
  and yeah , fuck that bitch . 
  we should quarantine madrid . 
  do n't worry , [ our dude ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miguel_arias_ca%c3%b1ete ) is n't fit for the position either . 
  is n't the dollar appreciating against pretty much everyone ? 
  yeah , after that i stopped watching house of cards for days . 
  at least he uses public transport . 
   he 's not a civil servant , he 's a property registrar . 
  it 's a civil service-ish thing but not quite . 
  according to [ their law ] ( http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/privado/lh.html ) they are funcionarios ( civil servants ) , but yeah they are a weird group with their own offices and workers . 
   there are constant rumours in galicia that he 's secretly gay and married for appearances never heard it ( and i 'm asturian ) , but that could explain his love of large , thick cigars . 
  mariano rajoy is our president and the current leader of the pp ( partido popular ) , he 's conservative even though he says he 's centrist , he 's pro austerity , pro big business and pro eu . 
  he 's against increased social spending , against catalonia 's referendum , and specially he 's against anything that could change the current status quo ( thus he wo n't change things like abortion or gay marriage even though he probably disagrees with them , and he also wo n't try to solve problems like unemployment or the sustainability of the social state ) and he 's famous in spain for his reserved personality ( thus his actions are always done through others , others who can therefore be blamed in lieu of him ) . 
  before being president he was vice president and minister of internal affairs , education and public sector ( not at the same time ) during aznar 's government and before that he was a member of galicia 's parliament . 
  regarding his personal life , he 's from galicia , he 's a high ranking public servant , catholic and married ( but his wife is not a public figure , in stark comparison to the previous two `` first wives '' ) . 
  in other words , he 's basically useless . 
  a person is unemployed in spain if he/she : - does n't have a job and - is actively searching for one ( that means registering in the public office ) and - is able to start a job in a maximum of two weeks . 
  therefore a student could be counted as unemployed , but only if he/she wants to work , is searching for jobs and has the time to work , otherwise no , students are n't automatically counted as employed nor as unemployed as they are considered inactive population . 
  yes it is . 
  here most people under 30 still live with their parents or emigrate . 
  i think it 's because most spanish speakers tend to stay in spanish speaking forums , and also because nowadays catalan people thrive to be seen as catalans , and therefore participate more in international forums and like to show your affiliation . 
  but yeah , it 's unusual . 
  the high representative of spain , / u/katarn86 replies that we should create a european federation , a million man army and a social salary and integrate ukraine , moldova and the balkans in our union , we should also solve all of our bubbles and develop alternative energy sources . 
  while we are at it we should also allow those pesky catalans to vote , nuke moscow and lower taxes . 
  will that be enough fun for today , or does the viking king / u/umsakis lord of all denmark and claimant to the title of king of the north demand more entertainment ? 
  yeah , too many people here behave like we are ambassadors from our countries instead of understanding that we are simply bored people trying to read news from different parts of europe . 
  i assume that he 's thinking about russia 's pr and how this will be sold as the proof of the alliance between the kiev junta/banderas and the nato/nazis ( of course i disagree on both points , but that 's how it 's gon na be sold by rt ) . 
  they can but they wo n't , as it would destroy relationships with all of their business partners ( and because nobody wants to see the wrath of the dota players ) . 
  high five !, 
  again , every single euro country except finland and luxembourg has broken the 3 % limit at least once , in fact , [ germany and france were the ones who decided that no country should ever be punished for breaking it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stability_and_growth_pact#reform_2005 ) , so i ca n't see how germany can now claim any moral superiority . 
  also , if you think that international law has anything in common with contract law or with morality , you are in for a treat ( just ask crimea , iraq or syria ) . 
   breaking it ( as france wants to ) is violating the agreement and following it means violating the agreement between the french government and its citizens . 
  also , [ unless you are from finland or luxembourg , your country has also done the same at least once . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stability_and_growth_pact#member_states_by_sgp_criteria ), 
  thanks to [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_madrid_train_bombings#description_of_the_bombings ) and the collective hysteria that followed , we do . 
  the european union was created by the [ eu treaty ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maastricht_treaty ) in 1992 . 
  before that the [ ecsc ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_coal_and_steel_community ) , the [ eec ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_community ) and [ euratom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_atomic_energy_community ) existed , but they did n't have competences in international matters ( and thus would have been unable to sanction anyone ) . 
  no reason to be sorry , and in fact we do have many statues of naked people ( also many old churches , but obviously there are bigger ones elsewhere ) . 
  and yep , fabada and cider , hopefully not at the same time . 
  another classics are the [ cachopo ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/cachopo ) ( sorry , not in english , it 's two beef steaks with ham and cheese between them and then breaded ) and [ frixuelos ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/frisuelos ) ( mostly crepes with apple sauce or cream ) . 
  did n't expect to ever see my unremarkable city of [ oviedo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oviedo ) on reddit . 
  i hope that you enjoyed your trip , and for anyone watching , i promise that we have something to see beyond statues of naked people . 
  the eu did n't even exist in 1979 , so you are certainly right , the eu did n't sanction iran in 1979 . 
  the first round was in [ 1979 ] ( http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/executive_order_12170 ) . 
  sure , but understanding why they dislike the west require understanding their pov , and in their pov , we suck while the russians are quite neutral . 
   why do n't you tell the full story ? 
  because i 'm not an encyclopaedia . 
  wikipedia is one , and therefore i linked it . 
   why are they offended ? 
  let 's see : - cia and mi6 overthrew mossaddegh [ because he wanted to nationalize iran 's oil ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_iranian_coup_d%27%c3%a9tat ) . 
  - cia then propped [ reza pahlavi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mohammad_reza_pahlavi ) , as he was easier to control . 
  - the shah then started a campaign of torture and kidnappings . 
  - the shah also granted us and british companies the largest oil and military contracts of that time . 
  - among the kidnapped were many shi'ite clerics . 
  - those clerics then decided to start ruling the country , and thus the [ iranian revolution ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iranian_revolution ) happened , and the [ iran hostage crisis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran_hostage_crisis ) also happened . 
  - then they decided to nationalize the oil , and thus caused huge losses to many us companies , so the us responded by terminating relationships with them and by propping saddam hussein in iraq , thus starting the [ first gulf war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran%e2%80%93iraq_war ) , that only caused 120,000 - 600,000 dead iranians . 
  soo , nothing , it 's just iranians being crazy . 
  of course not , after all [ we are the ones that have been punishing them for decades ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sanctions_against_iran ) , so why should they help us ? 
  if we want help we should visit our good friends of the saud and thani houses , they 'll give us a great deal for the head of assad . 
  sure , the deed may have been done by a german company , but if they sold the company they also sold the liability , thus the new hochtief 's owners will probably be the one that has to pay , even if after that they are able to sue the previous owners . 
  also , with spain being spain , chances are that somehow we will end up paying for acs 's problems ( after all , acs 's president is also real madrid 's president ) . 
  great , now we will end up paying the fine !, 
  actually the germans would be the the first ones , but silver medal is still pretty good . 
  and yeah , politics and energy are a terrible mix . 
  while i love that we are going in the right direction , comparing installed capacity of nuclear plants and windmills is always problematic , as nukes produce a very stable output ( except when under maintenance and refuelling ) while windmills only generate power when there 's wind , and the wind does n't care about demand ( something that is n't a problem with hydro power and is less of an issue with solar ) . 
  in any case , yay us !, 
  for once we are among the good ones !, 
   on the chart spain is only at 0.6 % while officially our military expenditure for this year is around 6,500 millions of $ ( and thus close to that .6 % ) our real expenditure is actually closer to 11,000 millions , as in spain most materiel programs are financed by the ministry of industry , not by defence ( an accounting trick ) and most international missions are financed by supplementary funds , therefore our `` expenditure per gdp '' is close to japan , canada or germany . 
   and that is very far away from doing its part and taking its share of the responsibility . 
  if that 's the official nato position then they are free to kick us out of the club . 
   2 % - of-gdp-rule is anyone else baffled by this concept ? 
  i mean , i could understand if nato wanted capabilities ( keep x tanks , y fighters , z destroyers ... ) but simply asking for more money , without caring for how that money is spent sounds absurd and wasteful . 
  hell , my country currently has the best military that we 've ever had and people keep saying that we should spend even more money . 
   i 'm curious , how do spaniards justify stopping catalonians from exercising their right to self-determination ? 
  is the reasoning as ethically indefensible as the one that calls for the annexation of gibraltar or do they actually have legitimate reasons ? 
  why do you assume that all of us agree with our government ? 
  there 's an error regarding spanish data , as there should be a second one in catalonia and no one in galicia ( there was a project to build one there , but it was stopped in the 80s ) . 
  thanks for the correction . 
  well we have many , but common examples include : * [ desfiladero de despe\u00f1aperros ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/despe%c3%b1aperros ) - gorge of throwing-dogs-down-the-cliff . 
  * until last week we had [ matajudios ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/castrillo_mota_de_jud%c3%ados ) - killjews ( it 's been changed to mota de jud\u00edos - jew hill ) . 
  * villapene - `` penisvillage '' * alcantarilla - `` manhole '' * guarrom\u00e1n - `` dirtyman '' * cenicero - `` ashtray '' edit : and `` el pozo de las mujeres muertas '' - the dead women 's well . 
  ( plus all of hstoichkov 's of course ) . 
  edit2 : typo ( as found by joaommx ), 
  the stupidity of our politicians clearly know no limits . 
   madrid became the first city in the world to name a square after the uk 's former conservative leader why do we have a square named like thatcher ? 
  did she ever do anything for madrid or is this another stupidity of madrid 's mayor ? 
  regarding piracy we were usually the victims ( [ northern spain ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/viking_age#spain ) still has many fortress against the vikings , southern had a problem with the [ barbary pirates ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barbary_pirates ) and everyone knows about the [ galleons ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_treasure_fleet ) and our relationship with the british privateers ) . 
  we were a bunch of assholes on land , but we were n't famous for being pirates . 
  meanwhile we had many famous sailors ( like [ alvaro de baz\u00e1n ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%81lvaro_de_baz%c3%a1n,_1st_marquis_of_santa_cruz ) , [ blas de lezo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blas_de_lezo ) , [ john of austria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_of_austria ) and , of course , even though they are n't spaniards , [ magallanes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferdinand_magellan ) and [ col\u00f3n ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christopher_columbus ) are also part of our history ) .
