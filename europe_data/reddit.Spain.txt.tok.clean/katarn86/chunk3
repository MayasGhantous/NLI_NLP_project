   fatties make me sick . 
   just face it - you 're fat because you 're stupid . 
  this is n't / r/fatpeoplehate , there 's no need to call names . 
  but beyond that , i agree , keeping a healthy weight is n't expensive nor hard , it only requires some self respect and a basic understanding of chemistry . 
  if asked i 'll vote yes , but who knows what will happen here . 
   no one got jailed as it seems no law has been broken . 
  is harassment not a crime in germany ? 
  well , / r/europe has always been a little circlejerky about the whole eu thing , so most people who dislike the eu tend to leave the sub and therefore have n't voted in this survey ( i think that 's a pity , but in any community it 's almost inevitable ) . 
  if it were my sovereignty of course i would n't want to share it , the thing is that i 'm currently sharing it with another 47,000,000 , so adding another 0 does n't seem like a problem . 
  makes sense , as the romanian company iar has produced a [ licensed copy of the puma ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iar_330 ) since 1975 and airbus has had a joint venture with them for the last 14 years . 
  uber is probably large enough to fight the decision all the way to the ecj , and due to the protection of the freedom of services [ stated in the tfeu ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/living_working/services-establishment/index_en.htm ) they may even win . 
  but with most eu taxi lobbies fighting for `` their '' business and the power and employment that they represent , i think no one knows what 's going to happen . 
  according to the swiss government , [ who promptly suspended her ] ( http://www.blick.ch/news/politik/bund-greift-durch-porno-sekretaerin-per-sofort-freigestellt-id3036107.html ) ( nsfw ) , because she 's a public worker and her actions thus represent her country . 
  personally i think the fact that a porn actress ( named adeline ) was hired as a secretary for a public institution is a bigger news than the fact that she took some photos , but maybe that 's just me . 
  i know that it 's evident to all of us , but we must not forget that spain is still an economic and social shithole and that germany is still the european powerhouse . 
  hell , i 'll be glad if we had only twice as much unemployment as germany 's 5 % ( we are at around 25 % ) . 
  it 's interesting how the guardian links to some random articles about femen , someone from ny and brigitte bardot but forgets to link to the survey that supposedly proves their claim . 
  it is n't common on a wide scale is spain either , but shit happens and it happens everywhere . 
  well , i post on reddit almost every day , but it 's usually not on / r/europe , because once you are here for a long enough time you start to predict the top posts by only reading the titles . 
  regarding the news , most of it is known in spain , as in the military you can find low level corruption ( already explained by / u/angry _ spaniard ) , mid level ( fuel and guns sometimes disappear ) and a lot of high level corruption ( programs that end up costing twice what they should , buying ifvs that ca n't shoot , tanks that ca n't see or aircraft that ca n't legally fly ) . 
  but on the whole it 's the same as in any other country , and the solutions should be the same in most countries ( more oversight , more open books and less `` national security '' bullshit ) . 
  well , snowden and manning also did the moral thing and were punished for it . 
  how did you know ? 
  do you keep a list of all of the hot girls in spain ? 
  can you share it ? 
  yep , if i give a gun to a kid and the kid kills someone i 'll be the one accused of manslaughter , even if it was an accident . 
  if i leave a dangerous dog alone in the park and it bites someone , justice will put down the dog , but i 'll end paying for it . 
   if blatant corruption is not detected ( like in the case of red flag linux ) , then it ca n't really be compared with ms as the work can be seen as contributing to `` the global commons '' . 
  i agree that it is n't comparable to ms practices , and up to some point i understand that building a `` local '' distro may be useful as a way to promote foss , it 's just that most of these projects behave just like repackaged ubuntu with different logos , a couple different packages and without any other difference , and i think that it just dilutes the work of others and promote very shady deals : the most common of these deals is related to support , as creating such distros opens ways of ensuring that only one company can provide it ( because only their workers are certified to work with it ) , and once the system is working and as long as it 's cheaper than ms no one will question the future bills ( the same way that some administrations believe that paying ms 's ransom is unavoidable ) . 
  another common shady behaviour is trying to sell the project as advanced r&d and thus attempt to find some grant , as for example [ melinux ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/melinux ) ( link in spanish ) , is just an ubuntu clone made in melilla by some public local entity called solime and is financed by the eu through [ erdf ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_regional_development_fund ) , and i ca n't understand why . 
  finally , with this i 'm not saying that all foss projects are shady nor that small , personal projects are useless , as there 's nothing wrong in creating your distro , either because you want some special quality or simply because you want , my only problem is with the relationship between some creators and public funding . 
  i love the use of linux on public administrations , but this tendency of making custom distros for every little organism smells slightly like corruption . 
  of course so does giving ms huge amounts of money for newer versions of office and windows , so i guess that at least linux is cheaper and more open , but still , [ the number of public funded distros in spain is worrying ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/anexo:distribuciones_gnu/linux_de_espa%c3%b1a ) ( not all of these get public funding , but most do or are made by public institutions ) . 
  they do n't think that italy ( or greece or spain ) can handle this , their idea is that , well , it sucks that it happens but at least it is n't happening to them , so we should keep it that way . 
  meanwhile frontex is still useless and dublin ii has n't been changed . 
  they look great , much better than our king 's face . 
  there are examples of people surviving similar falls : * [ vesna vulovi\u0107 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vesna_vulovi%c4%87 ) * [ alan magee ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alan_magee ) * [ juliane koepcke ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/juliane_koepcke ) * [ nicholas alkemade ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicholas_alkemade ) i agree that they are all exceptions to your rule , and that the chances are extremely low , but assuming that there ca n't be people alive after a crash is negligent by itself and another insult to the victims . 
  yeah , `` could '' that 's the problem , as many things could have happened , but due to the stupidity of the rebels we 'll never know , the families will never know , and admittedly under special circumstances , [ some could have survived ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sole_survivors_of_airline_accidents_or_incidents ) , but no one even tried to find them and help them . 
  the more i think about it the angrier i become . 
  for example , how do we know that everyone died on the crash ? 
  there was no attempt to save anyone and no emergency service , so who knows what happened to those poor people . 
   i 'm assuming the fact that i have a spaniard passport certifies i really am a citizen of spain ? 
  yep , if you have a spanish passport you are spaniard , compatriota . 
   my second question is , is it true i can live in any country within the european union , as long as i have a citizenship from another eu country ? 
  they require both a eu nationality and enough money to subsists , so that second requisite could be a problem . 
  and answering your last question , you should understand that an eu passport does n't only allow you to enter eu , it also allows you to reside in any of the countries where spain ( through the eu or otherwise ) has a free visa regime ( so you can go to places with better economic prospects than the eu , [ take a look at the list ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_requirements_for_spanish_citizens#territories ) ) . 
  good luck . 
  you are either a mad man or a tactical genius , in both cases you should fight for juncker 's job . 
  in spain almost every important topic varies between schools : first , the muslim rule is usually simplified . 
  then the reconquista tends to be whitewashed . 
  from then you learn about the conquest of america , that was made by three dudes ( col\u00f3n , cort\u00e9s an pizarro ) , and that is usually represented as a bad thing ( but again , it varies between schools ) . 
  from the conquest then we go directly to the xviii century , the independence wars and napole\u00f3n ( who was obviously defeated by the people from madrid , not in waterloo as you may have heard ) . 
  next you study the carlist wars , and the beginnings of the independentists movements ( usually misrepresented either in one direction or the other ) and the loss of cuba , philippines and puerto rico . 
  and then finally we study a lot about the twentieth century ( ww1 , primo de rivera , 2nd republic , civil war , ww2 , franco and constitution , with some other international conflicts in between ) , and it 's in this last place were everything becomes very nebulous and every teacher tries to sway the pupils in one direction ( usually according to the personal convictions of the teacher , the ideology of the school and the autonomous community where you live ) . 
  edit : also , i 'm sure the religious conflicts and the conquest of europe are seen differently by other european countries ( for example philip ii is usually seen as a competent king , but probably the dutch do n't feel that way . ), 
  yes , we picked a side while we told the world we were going to just defend the poor civilians with a no fly zone . 
  because we never use war to push our interests . 
  i mean , sure we are more subtle , but we bombed libya , iraq and afghanistan while they bombed chechnya and georgia and annexed crimea , we are friends with the saudis while they are friends with the ayatollahs and both sides allow syria to happen . 
  really , both sides are full of shit . 
  in spain every single day . 
   the european union , the 27-nation trading bloc . 
  poor croatia , always forgotten . 
   my point was that european defence co-operation has had some real benefits , and arguably there is a lot wasted within the eu 's 27 armies , air forces and navies . 
  sure , i agree with that , but the problem is that in many of these programs we are finding all of the problems of a multinational process ( it 's hard to agree and everything is slow ) and we are n't finding the supposed benefits ( again , the rafale has a similar price as the ef , and france is free to decide how they want their planes ) , so while i agree that the interoperativity element is important , something is n't working . 
  also , i do n't really know which one is better , and let 's hope we never find it . 
  finally , i 'm not sure if it 's good to put all of our eggs in the same basket , as for example what would happen to our collective defence if we all used eurofighters and we suddenly discovered that the russians can easily counter it ? 
  or what if the company that sells them ( eurofighter gmbh , i think ) decides to jack up the prices because they know we have no option beyond paying ( this is the situation that usa may eventually have with lockheed martin and it sounds very dangerous ) . 
  again , i agree that it 's cheaper in the short term to consolidate the providers , but i 'm not sure of the long term effects of that policy . 
  why not make it an eu project ? 
  that way we could all send some troops and let them play with their toys and practice deployments without offending russia . 
  it would also show commitment towards the defence of eastern europe and prepare the area for any eventual hostility . 
  really , it 's a win-win . 
  last time we sent [ rato ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rodrigo_rato ) to the imf , so they should have known better . 
  oh god , you named the two worst projects ever !, 
  we ( spain ) are paying something like 65 millions for every [ nh90 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nhindustries_nh90 ) ( when it should be something like 20 , 30 tops ) because our then defence minister decided to make a new factory in his autonomous community . 
  and the damn [ a400m ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a400m ) was sold as an `` easy '' project to replace c-130s and c-160s ( instead of buying [ c-17 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boeing_c-17_globemaster_iii ) s and new c-130js ) but only after everyone signed airbus confessed that they had no idea about when the damned thing would fly ( and again , it eventually costed twice as much as it should ) . 
  but yeah , your [ eurohawk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northrop_grumman_rq-4_global_hawk#eurohawk ) are even funnier ( 600,000,000 $ down the drain ) , so it seems that european procurement is n't the only problem . 
   france france left the ef project to pursue a national jet ( the rafale ) , and it 's as good as the ef and not more expensive . 
   the entire nokia deal has bred more xenophobia regarding doing business with foreigners than anything else i 've seen . 
  makes sense , but the whole situation tells more about nokia 's executive 's naivety than about the evils of the foreign businessmen . 
  really , microsoft unofficial motto is `` embrace , extend , and extinguish '' . 
  actually with 26 % of unemployment i prefer the first option , but i understand that the pov from romania may be different . 
  `` consolidating assets '' always means `` reducing redundancies '' , or said a different way , firing people and closing shops . 
  that 's a great idea , specially because it would destroy the economy of koenigsberg . 
   georgia , armenia and azerbaijan are basically fine . 
  they are certainly better than syria , but their territorial problems make the spanish 's ones look easy to solve . 
   iran should be our friends , damn it . 
  i 've always thought that way , they are n't perfect but they are certainly better than `` our friends '' the saudis . 
   which leaves us with iraq and syria . 
  two out of six is not bad . 
  people moan about how we are `` being invaded '' by africans because of ceuta , melilla and lampedusa , so imagine what would happen if isis could jump the border easily . 
  really , i 've seen too many fucked up videos about syria and iraq to want them as neighbours . 
  i know that everything i 've said is totally unfair towards the turkish people , but the idea of keeping one buffer state between eu and isis sounds much better than becoming part of the middle east . 
  and they are surrounded by marvellous countries that would suddenly become our frontier . 
  and i did it twice !, 
  while i agree that a problem in grovelines would n't cause long term problems in either city , your own link explains how the wind can sent radioactive ashes to very long distances . 
  for example according to your link , the belarusian town of slawharad is 236 km away from chernobyl ( according to google earth ) and it had areas with more than 40 curies/km2 , areas that were confiscated by the ussr because they were deemed unsafe . 
  now , again according to google earth , the distance between grovelines and westminster is 166km , brussels is at 160 , and paris is at 239km , so i 'll assume that if something serious happened there , a huge amount of people would want to evacuate , even if , as i said , most people would be back to their homes in a couple days , or as soon as the ashes touched ground ( or probably sea ) . 
  ** tldr : ** no long term problem but probably lots of short term panic , also no more d-day commemoration . 
  that also makes sense , as the station closest to the uk ( grovelines ) was built in 1980 and the current high voltage link between france and uk opened in 1986 .
