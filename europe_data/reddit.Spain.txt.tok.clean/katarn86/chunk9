  but i 'm from the north , so maybe in andaluc\u00eda it may be more emphasized . 
  actually most spaniards do n't really care about gibraltar , and personally my only gripes are how they 've become a fiscal haven ( sucking much needed cash from andaluc\u00eda ) and the lack of police cooperation ( the main cause of this childish behaviour ) . 
  regarding ceuta and melilla vs gibraltar , i think there 's one difference though , as ceuta and melilla were funded before morocco even existed , so i 'm not sure how morocco claims any title over them . 
  wait !, 
  one can mail shit ? 
  i think i 'm going to send a steamy worded letter to our dear president . 
  a miner from asturias who sold them the explosives ( jos\u00e9 emilio su\u00e1rez trashorras ) . 
  so , mostly like our cajas were until 2008 : - controlled by local and regional politicians . 
  - financing local business but also the local administrations and the political parties ( and their pharaonic constructions ) . 
  - not for profit , but with ever growing salaries for the administrators and other people `` in the know '' . 
  and we all know how our mostly unsupervised and `` socially responsible '' cajas ended . 
  well , they were part of the `` strongest banking system of europe '' so of course they were an example !, 
  / s , but tbh , comparing to bankia , cam or catalunya caixa they are n't really that bad , i mean , they are the financing arm of the opus dei , but at least they do n't have to feed hundreds of politicians . 
  this is the bank bailout that was planned in july , the one that initially was to be up to 100bn $ , but luckily our `` very responsible '' banks have ended up only needing 39.5 bn . 
  unfortunately right now nobody knows if it will be enough , as the blackhole that is bankia keeps growing , and other holes start to appear ( popular , liberbank , maybe one of three big ones ) . 
  also , i still do n't think this is a positive news , no matter what some may say , as those banks should simply be liquidated , and those billions will end up being payed either by the spaniard people or by the eu , but never by the banksters . 
   rivers of alcohol  you must pay a visit sometime !, 
  yep , said like that sounds like a wonderful place !, 
  and i just read about direct flights between alc and ovd , so i may actually do it . 
  that 's actually news for me . 
  i 'm from asturias so i 've only watched them on tv , but they all seem so devout that i 've never would have thought of it as a family tradition . 
  as a spaniard , i hope that this does n't extend through europe , as it 's already too hard to explain to foreigners that in spain [ these ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazareno ) are maybe religious nut jobs , but not necessarily racist ones . 
  in the end the waiters will be charged with attempted murder , the tourist will keep his pound of steak , and the restaurant will be forced to give half of his fortune to the man . 
   wow , why ? 
  because qaddafi got raped with a knife , and sisi does n't want to be raped with a knife . 
   do egypt even have the infrastructure to support ships of this type what about crewmen and maintenance . 
  not really , and israel would get angry if they did , so the ships will probably be used as a taxi to yemen . 
  yeah , we agreed to something like 16,000 . 
  tldr : they are basically replacing obsolete systems with modern equivalents in their six 20-years old frigates and buying some patrol boats to replace their 40 years old corvettes , also , in the next decade they may replace their oiler and buy a second hand lpd . 
  it all sounds perfectly reasonable . 
   guess chittagong it is then . 
  [ it 's old and unfinished ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_cruiser_ukrayina ) , but if the price is low enough and it can float the us could do a `` hunt for the red october '' . 
  turkey has a navy and a functioning state , so invading turkish waters may be complicated . 
  thank you too for your infographics ( hopefully you kept them all after what happened to military photos ) . 
  with you , / u/tabasco-habanero and charly015 who needs jane 's !, 
   mm ffg - multirole frigate ( fremm )  ffl - frigates do our f-80s ( oliver hazzard perry ) count as mm ffg or as ffl ? 
  also , thanks for your work in / r/warshipporn . 
  according to google , the original 's `` fridskr\u00e4nkning '' should be `` gender/domestic violence '' , and while i agree about the need to also curb domestic violence against men , i do n't know anything about what 's being done about it in sweden , so i have no opinion . 
  [ same document google-translated to english . 
  ] ( https://translate.google.es/translate?hl=es&amp;sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.bra.se%2fdownload%2f18.421a6a7d13def01048a80006935%2f1433171474854%2f40gla.xls ), 
   not usually . 
  maybe `` rebel '' but rarely opposition , and only someone who is really uninformed would lump them in together . 
  [ this bbc map disagrees with you . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-22798391 ) , as it does lump all together and calls them `` opposition '' . 
  attacking someone while carrying thousands of $ of camera sounds pretty retarded . 
  and attacking a defenseless woman while she 's carrying her kid is a bitch move . 
  therefore she 's a retarded bitch . 
  are these from miniature model 's boxes ? 
  they remind me of [ revell ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=revell+tank&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=917&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cayq_auoawovchmi6qm599pqxwivgs4uch3i5abq ) boxes . 
  yep , somehow having huge unemployment rates and no public housing nor welfare benefits for refugees makes us a bad destination . 
  at the same time we have close to 6,000,000 immigrants , most of whom arrived in the last 15 years and many who came from unstable areas ( mostly the sahel ) , but they do n't have refugee status , so they do n't appear in these statistics . 
  at least in my experience i usually stay on the fence because the reasons to report given by the `` report '' button fortunately are n't that common : spam vote manipulation personal information sexualizing minors breaking reddit and while there 's always : other ( max 100 character ) ; things like personal attacks , obvious derailings of threads , low quality post or similar issues never seem as important as `` sexualizing minors '' , so i end up not bothering the mods . 
  sorry if it came as that , i was just trying to agree with you on how weird the whole `` international waters '' between finland and eesti thing is . 
   north stream yeah , that would piss the russians ( really , why is nord stream still open ? 
  are n't we supposed to be punishing putin ? ), 
  you can extend the territorial waters , but all countries must respect [ innocent passage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/innocent_passage ) rights through them , so no , you can not legally blockade st. petersburg ( trust me , if spain could install a toll booth in tarifa and ceuta we 'll be rich ) . 
   it seems you have some reading comprehension problems . 
  you are such a nice person . 
  i see that you are a glass half-full kind of person , i used to be that way ( until the fire nation attacked ) . 
   you think unemployment is regained quickly ? 
  after a crisis like ours ? 
  of course not , but the current forecasts say that if everything goes well we 'll have an unemployment of 15 % in 2020 , and by then it 'll have been 13 years since the bubble 's burst . 
   it 'll take years at the most , but we 're finally back on track . 
  yeah , but if rajoy keeps forgetting about that 22 % while touting how great the gdp and the debt are doing he 'll be out in november , and the next president may not care as much about `` eu good boy points '' as he does . 
  well , yeah , calling 22 % of unemployment and 49 % youth unemployment a recovery is an insult to anyone 's intelligence . 
  wikipedia 's definition for '' [ economic recovery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_recovery ) '' :  an economic recovery is the phase of the business cycle following a recession , during which an economy ** regains and exceeds peak employment ** and output levels achieved prior to downturn . 
  a recovery period is typically characterized by abnormally high levels of growth in real gross domestic product , ** employment ** , corporate profits , and other indicators . 
  ( emphasis mine ) so , exactly , how 's unemployment unrelated to this news ? 
  [ yeah , everything is awesome in spain ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/spain/youth-unemployment-rate ) . 
  i think that he 's mixing sweden and [ switzerland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_immigration_referendum,_february_2014 ) . 
  yes , it was . 
  for the last 20 or so years russia has kept three different nuclear programs with the purpose of replacing soviet ( ie : old and mostly ukrainian ) missiles with ones fully manufactured and maintained in russia . 
  those missiles are : the [ topol-m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rt-2pm2_topol-m ) , the [ yars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rs-24_yars ) and the [ bulava ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rsm-56_bulava ) . 
  of course is debatable if russia needs so many missiles , but this is n't an unexpected development . 
   normally it 's spelled as piigs [ 1 ] but i like to spell it back to front because calling these countries `` pigs '' sounds quite insulting imho . 
  thank you . 
  i 'd assume that 's mostly because italy and spain were the two large countries who did n't limit the freedom of movement against romanians and bulgarians when you got into the eu . 
  the us president travels in one [ 747 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/air_force_one ) , plus various [ c-17 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boeing_c-17_globemaster_iii ) ( transporting his [ limos ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/presidential_state_car_%28united_states%29 ) , [ helicopters ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hmx-1 ) and security ) . 
  that 's not exactly green . 
   he had not been vaccinated given that his parents are against the practice . 
  i hope that they rot in jail . 
  also :  the russian ambassador to spain managed to bring the drug via plane from moscow to barcelona in the early hours of monday morning . 
  thanks , russia . 
   either spain is scared of immigrants , they 're reinforcing the mediterranean against russia , or the us is gearing up for an intervention in sudan . 
  or simply after benghazi the us understood that basing troops in unstable african countries is a bad idea , so as they were already paying for mor\u00f3n , and the base is close to africa , why not put some troops there . 
  also , what do you think that some 2k marines would do against russia or immigrants that spain ca n't ? 
  specially in an area where the spanish military keeps our main navy base ( rota ) , our naval infantry ( about 5,000 soldiers ) , two army brigades ( like 16,000 soldiers ) , our patriot missiles , and like half of our eurofighters . 
  actually the c-295 was designed and is manufactured in spain ( the `` c '' is for casa , our former aircraft manufacturer that 's now part of airbus ) . 
  actually they 've acquired an [ lhd ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_ship_juan_carlos_i_%28l61%29 ) , not an [ lpd ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galicia-class_landing_platform_dock ) . 
  in any case , it 's interesting how france was n't able to sell the two they built for russia , and how popular the spanish design is becoming ( we 've sold two to australia , one to turkey and we are trying to sell four to india , plus the one we use for ourselves ) . 
  nope , just the two ships . 
  we also have a program for 22 [ nh90 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nhindustries_nh90 ) for 1700 millions ( 77 per bird , twice what other countries are paying ) , we were supposed to pay 1200 for 45 helicopters , but somehow we 've ended with the current price . 
  really , the spanish defense industry is a joke . 
  they did it because the two public shipyards did n't have enough workload and as a way to covertly pay for the workers salaries ( 2015 is election 's year in spain , so closing the shipyards was political suicide , specially as they are in cadiz and ferrol , cities with pretty high unemployment ) . 
  but yeah , for that kind of money they could have built a second [ lhd ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_ship_juan_carlos_i_%28l61%29 ) , 4 opvs or a couple hospitals . 
   three new vessels at an estimated cost of $ 150m meanwhile we are building [ two slightly larger opvs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buque_de_acci%c3%b3n_mar%c3%adtima ) for 333 millions . 
  true that , between shitty music , ads and religion it 's easy to simply forget about the radio and just listen to mp3 , but sometimes it 's useful to tune some newscast and sports , and for those radio is still the simplest option , at least for the driver . 
  that makes perfect sense , thanks for the answer . 
  that 's going to suck for everyone with an old car . 
  also , does anyone know why is dab used when there 's also dvb-t radio ?
