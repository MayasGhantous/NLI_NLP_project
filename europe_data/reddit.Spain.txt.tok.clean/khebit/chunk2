  i 'm all for a spain of nations , but just aknowledge that not ** every fucking thing is castilla ** . 
  there has been bullfighting in barcelona ** since the xivth century ** - is that castillian cultural invasion ? 
  the flamenco originates in gipsy culture mainly around granada and spread around the south to andalucia , murcia and extremadura - is that the core castilla ? 
  has castilla even embraced it ? 
  heck , i would say flamenco is more pivotal in catalonia because of the immigration influx from the south during decades than in the rest of spain . 
  nobody i 've ever met from madrid up to the north has given a fuck about flamenco . 
  as always , it looks like you try to make everything merge into a common enemy , sometimes you call it madrid , now you call it castilla . 
  and by doing that you are effectively doing what you complain about : ** you erase the culture of the rest of the spanish regions ** , as if there was no extremadura , no andalucia , no asturias , no la rioja , no cantabria : only the really bad castilla !, 
  i really do n't think they are oppressed at all either , considering they are one of the richest regions of spain and they have a considerable amount of regional autonomy . 
  so why ? 
  i indeed guess economy plays a huge role , even more when we are in the middle of a huge financial crisis , and a lot of people believe being independent will mean their economy will be better off , but that is just my opinion . 
  * and castilla is to blame for the extension , most of the times natural , of its language ? 
  * you should understand that castilla played a fundamental role during the reconquista , which led to their language being dominant . 
  and just like people switched to latin centuries ago because of the roman cultural power , they then switched to castillian . 
  * is also castilla to blame for the fact that most channels want to appeal to the broader audience , as essentially everyone speaks spanish but not everyone speaks another language ? 
  * i really do n't understand this argument - why have tv shows in a language the majority of the population does n't understand ? 
  and remember that co-official languages are always subbed and never dubbed ( except for live events ) , so it 's not like there 's a disrespect for the speakers . 
  * and should we blame on castilla the fact that tourists think stereotypes about barcelona ? 
  * i mean , here you are n't even considering that every single city has stereotypes that are flat out false , and also , catalonia has a rich history related to bullfighting ( and you ca n't blame this on castilla as well ) , and flamenco originated not in castilla but mainly from the gypsy culture . 
  castilla ( understood as castilla y le\u00f3n + castilla la mancha + madrid ( + arguably cantabria , extremadura or la rioja ) is the biggest part of spain , and as such you could say that it holds the biggest power . 
  but still we 've had presidents from andalucia , or from galicia currently , and we 've had policies benefitting basque country ( with their fiscal pact ) and catalonia with the help of catalan parties to felipe gonz\u00e1lez and aznar in order to pass major laws such as budget , all while ceuta , melilla and the canary islands keep their special tax status ... overall , i do n't think castilla can be considered to be * dominant * over the rest . 
  also , i 'm not saying spain is nothing . 
  i 'm saying spain appeared as the union of different regions , with slightly different cultures , so saying one of those regions is n't spain makes no sense to me . 
  i 'm not claiming spain is something `` artificial '' . 
  i genuinely do n't see the problem with the first sentence . 
  and well , spanish is called that way because it is the most common language shared by the country , but even in south america they sometimes call it castillian . 
  no , that would be like saying `` catalonia is not castilla '' , which is obvious . 
  catalonia is catalonia , castilla is castilla , spain is both of them plus several more . 
  scotland is scotland , england is england , they are both different and yet they both together are the united kingdom . 
  no apologies needed !, 
  the whole `` madrid 's subjugation '' is just wrong ** in my opinion ** . 
  firstly , in 1714 , there was no such thing as spain invading catalonia . 
  spain 's king had died without children , and the new one came from the borbons in france - felipe v. however , being allied with the french did n't sound good to many catalans as half a century ago they had lost the rosell\u00f3 in a war against them , so they supported austrians and english and revolted , claiming carlos iii was the legitimate heir to the throne . 
  eventually their coalition , which was strong in catalonia , valencia and balearic islands , got defeated , and after a siege barcelona fell in 1714 to one spanish king while defending another spanish king . 
  and about franco , well , firstly madrid was the last city to be conquered by the francoist army , after being bombed quite a lot of times , and a pretty long siege , so it 's not like they did n't suffer the wrath of the war . 
  and also , blaming everything done by franco in catalonia to castilla/madrid means assuming there were no executions of left people , no land stolen from farmers , and no injustices commited in the rest of spain at the time - which is outright wrong . 
  tl ; dr : every single region in spain has been eventually fucked up , so let 's not blame everything on madrid or castilla as if they 've spent all their history trying to destroy catalonia . 
  i like it when they say `` catalonia is not spain '' , because to me it feels like saying `` scotland is not britain '' : you may not want to be part of the united kingdom , but you are definitely in an island called britain . 
  in the same way , catalonia might not like being in the same state than the rest of the regions , but to me there is no such thing as `` spain '' without any of its regions . 
  i think they should be able to decide their own future . 
  at the same time , i do n't like the idea of them voting with a distorted perspective of future and past , and i 'll explain myself : if they say they want to be independent because of money , or because they prefer having a smaller government , or because ( on line with cup ) they dislike the current idea of europe and want to drive towards a smaller , more social state , that 's fine for me ( even though i disagree with all of those reasons ) . 
  however , it really grinds my gears when i hear reasons such as : * * franco hated catalonia !, 
  catalan was forbidden !, 
  * yeah , well , franco killed thousands of people , destroyed the country in a civil war , destroyed the economies of a lot of parts , did nothing to address cultural problems such as a lot of people being illiterate , having nothing to eat , owning no land and being essentially slaves to their patrons ... and that did n't just happen in catalonia . 
  i understand you got fucked , now you should also understand we all got fucked too . 
  spain steals from us !, 
  * so ... spain also steals from the richer people because they pay more taxes ? 
  i guess they should argue that because they have private health care and education and use none of the public infrastructure as they go everywhere in helicopter , they should go along tax free , right ? 
  well no . 
  spain had a fierce protectionism which hugely benefited catalonia 's industry , which in turn made you richer . 
  i guess the payback is allowing the rest of the regions to catch up . 
  * * spain invaded us in 1714 !, 
  * that 's just ... argh , i hate it . 
  catalonia 's history has been `` revised '' lately , in a way that makes it look like it existed before fucking pangea . 
  the `` catalan empire '' was actually the aragonese crown , and there was nothing more than the count of barcelona . 
  there was no such thing as `` pa\u00efsos catalans '' , and even since the catholic monarchs catalonia became de facto part of what we now call spain . 
  in 1714 catalonia just chose to back a different king during a civil war , and even mr. casanova , now praised as independentist , said something on the line of `` bleeding for the king , the homeland , and the freedom of all spain '' . 
  i do n't think that 's specially pro-independence , at all . 
  tl ; dr : yes , let them decide , but for god 's sake , do n't vote based on stupid arguments that have been repeated again and again until they now look like the truth . 
  forgiving castilla , what for if i may ask ? 
  are castillians even a half-serious independent movement ? 
  i would n't say so . 
  and most of spain would vote against , do n't even doubt it ( though i think a lot would support a referendum ) . 
   catalonia is also much more left-leaning than the rest of spain ( though someone can correct me if i am wrong ) , which dates back to the spanish civil war . 
  naturally a political divide like that is going to lead to talk of independence . 
  i would n't say so : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalonian_parliamentary_election,_2012 - ciu , which in the spanish spectrum is more leaning towards the right , has been historically one of the most ( if not the most ) relevant parties in catalonia , although for quite a long time the tripartit ( coalition of 3 left parties ) prevented them from forming government . 
  they lean more towards the left than other regions such as galicia or madrid for sure , but not as much as andalucia or extremadura for example . 
  after all , their economy is based on a powerful middle-high class , with a lot of economical power , which probably does n't like left parties . 
  in the south we very often feel like the scapegoat of catalonian politicians - things are bad up there ? 
  no problem , it 's not our fault , it 's the southern regions that take our money and do nothing all day !, 
  they just live off our taxes !, 
  you may think it 's an exaggeration , but after comments like [ * `` adopt a kid from extremadura \\ [ sw region \\ ] '' * ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2008/07/30/actualidad/1217405834_850215.html ) from a city councillor , or jordi pujol , president of the generalitat de catalunya , saying the andalusian man is [ * `` not coherent , anarchic , destroyed , hungry , living in a state of ignorance and of cultural , mental and spiritual misery '' * ] ( http://sevilla.abc.es/andalucia/cordoba/20140827/sevp-pujol-andaluces-20140827.html ) are kind of frequent , up to the oint you get tired of being considered inferior for being born in one region . 
  artur mas has already said that he will go on with the independentist project as long as he gets a majority in seats ( which as of now he has , if we look at polls ) , regardless of whether he has an actual majority in votes or not . 
  jordi pujol was president of the generalitat for 20 + years and he said some [ pretty nice things ] ( http://www.cartasaldirector.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/10375150_744802032232040_6297099248762074744_n.jpg ) about how andalusians are destroyed people , an anarchic and poor mentality . 
  does that mean anything ? 
  no , because we just accept he was a moron . 
  also , it 's not like you are the only ones to suffer . 
  southern regions got fucked since the reconquista with all the agricultural land being divided among the rich land owners , destroying any option of improving the economy . 
  in sevilla , the very first day the spanish civil war started , our dearest queipo de llano decided it was about time to take the troops around the city , and after all the parts of the city were under control , 6000 people had died , as the orders were to shoot anyone that looked suspicious . 
  also , it 's not like everything was negative for catalonia . 
  there was a huge protectionism towards catalan products ( even stendhal acknowledged that ) that fueled cuban independece movements , first electricity and rail lines , seat production lines , support for barcelona ' 92 ... tl ; dr : spain 's one and only goal has never been to fuck with catalonia , there just were a bunch of retarded rulers that fucked the whole country . 
   do n't you think that this history alone is a reason for independence ? 
  2 quotes by 2 retarded guys ( fraga , really ? 
  ) , something done by a king 250 years ago , and something done by a dictator that fucked up all of the country 80 years ago . 
  with that filter every fucking village could find reasons to become independent . 
  [ * we 're all amigos here * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0htrnaa8ae ), 
  there 's plenty of precedent of people calling everyone every way . 
  pp fascists , podemos communists , go back to cuba , look how venezuela is , ap was founded by a minister of franco , companys was a traitor , companys is a prophet ... 
  it 's senseless to claim offence according to what a specific media says . 
  a lot of those houses belong to banks , though , and those are the same banks that received billions from the government in bailout plans . 
  yes , the government is the one that should provide the housing , but i ca n't see what 's wrong with using the thousands of abandoned , bank-owned houses for families that due to economic circumstances ca n't afford a better place to live . 
  but becherovka is so good though !, 
  i would n't disagree with spending all day drinking it , 
   spanish history is pretty embarrassing - you had mountains of gold from s. america but ended up being fleeced by genoese then flemish bankers , while the brits humiliated you militarily and ended up being a backwater for centuries , the industrial revolution passing you by . 
  we were too proud ( and our kings after xvith century where too stupid ) to admit that things were n't going well , so we just kept throwing the american gold that was n't taken by british pirates at our army to keep fighting useless wars , and by the time the industrial revolution came , our empire was long gone , despite the efforts to keep it together by empowering our colonies and trying to put them at the same level than mainland spain in spanish ' 1812 constitution ( thank you , fernando vii , you fucktard ! ), 
  i disagree with respect to the military humiliations though - brits were also humiliated really often ( cartagena de indias or their own invincible army stand out ) , and we had arguably the best soldiers for a period of time , plus some really clutch battles like lepanto . 
  we just were n't too good at pr apparently ( as juderias defended when he introduced the term * black legend * ) . 
  they are probably more informed than the average european citizen . 
   so according to the ministry the shipping companies actually support putting a tax on them ? 
  better the devil you know , i guess .
