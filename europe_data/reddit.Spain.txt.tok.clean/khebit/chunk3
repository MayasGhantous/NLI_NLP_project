  there is too much uncertainty in voting no for the people that are okay with the current situation . 
   this law intends to address a very real problem . 
  eta assassinated 486 police officers or soldiers since spain is democratic eta declared a ceasefire , there have been no killings since 2010 , fortunately . 
  so i do n't think it has anything to do with them . 
  well , at the same time , had greece defaulted , some european banks would have lost tons of money . 
  so i do n't think it was just * solidarity * , there were some economic interests behind troika 's help . 
   ... well , the bill collectors are knocking and greece 's ** older more mature and intelligent ** big brothers ... 
  this is just as senseless as greeks blaming germany for all of their problems . 
  the classic `` they do n't know how things work , and we do because we are smarter '' argument is just really stupid . 
  it is indeed , in spanish * h * is n't pronounced in * hahaha * so it is like saying * a a a * ( theoretically , as everyone ends up pronouncing it the standard way ) . 
  so instead * ja * is used , which has almost the same pronunciation ( with just the * j * being a little stronger than the * h * ), 
  i 'd prefer them to be far from the middle east at the moment , for safety 's sake , just like when spain sent tons of art pieces from their museums away during civil war . 
  that way we 'll at least be sure they do n't get destroyed . 
   i mean , you supposedly do not want people seeing who you are voting for , right ? 
  how can you keep the secrecy if everyone sees the ballot you 're picking from the table ? 
  i honestly do n't care , i just take the one with the party i 'm supporting and put it inside the enveloppe ( ai n't nobody got time for booths ) . 
  yeah , people might see which party i 'm voting , but i could n't care less . 
  i guess you can choose to keep your vote secret , but you might as well not hide it . 
  i would say it 's either [ the visigoths losing to the muslims at guadalete ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_guadalete ) ( and an 8 centuries period of muslim presence in the iberian peninsula ) or , more straightforward , colombus ' discovery of the americas , that lead spain into a golden era , with an empire spanning the whole globe . 
   the us is also an ocean away from germany , while the ussr was next door . 
  does n't that reinforce ussr 's stance ? 
  i mean , even if the us got involved there was an entire ocean separating them from germany , whereas the soviets had germany as neighbours after their joint invasion of poland so they had no reason to want war . 
  61.5 % youth unemployment in andalucia , future is bright here !, 
  i might try to go as a [ volunteer for the eu pavillion ] ( http://www.expo2015.volunteer4europe.org/ ) - is anyone else in for this ? 
  honestly , most of the people that went to russia only did so to `` clean their names '' . 
  does n't the king have a theoretical veto power , by not confirming and signing the law ? 
  ( of course this would never happen , but i think it 's possible on paper ? ), 
  [ this video is a good example of how they are in seville ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg8n60e5krw ) . 
  it 's one of the most importants , the esperanza de triana , during the madrug\u00e1 ( the night between thursday and friday ) . 
  there are tons of videos , i think they 're worth even if it 's just to listen to the wonderful music . 
  wait , what ? 
  apparently , [ the same happened in france yesterday ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2015/04/03/01016-20150403artfig00338-80-kilos-de-cocaine-decouverts-dans-des-cartons-de-bananes.php ) ( 80kg , hidden in `` bananas '' ), 
  [ this one should be easy , right ? 
  ] ( https://ontheflightpath.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mp900402711.jpg ), 
  the best thing of the spanish legion is , clearly , [ the goat ] ( http://www.emtstatic.com/2009/04/manolo.jpg ) . 
  does that take into consideration value of exports , or simply amount/weight ? 
  if you are using that paradigm , then there is no way germany started wwi , as they just said they would defend austria . 
   germany 's actions caused the second world war as others have stated , there are more theaters . 
  for example , japan invaded china before 1939 . 
  yes , germany started a war , and are to blame for it , but it should n't be considered the ** only ** responsible of the conflict ( which unfortunately is a popular opinion ), 
  oh for fuck 's sake , i 'm from andalucia . 
  try visiting a political discussion in a spanish website ( like forocoches ) with a location tag from andalucia . 
  whenever there is a discussion , everyone will start talking about how good would spain be without andalucia , how we are lazy people , how we just waste money and provide nothing , how we do n't know how to speak , how we are useless gypsies . 
  let 's not pretend this does n't exist , and you are the only ones affected . 
  defending spain 's interests means defending the 3 corridors . 
  plus , do n't forget , if catalonia is to become independent , why would the government invest there ? 
  plus , the mediterranean corridor is on the way , but there 's just no money . 
  sources on what ? 
  and yet again , the classical `` hah , now we go away and you will be poor !! '' . 
  catalonia is important , but stop thinking it 's thank to you that the earth moves around the sun - calm down and if you want independence think more about your problems and do n't pretend you 'll be the new switzerland and we will disappear . 
  as always , madrid madrid madrid . 
  everything that is n't catalonia is madrid . 
  everything against catalonia is caused by madrid . 
  if it 's bad , it 's madrid - if it 's madrid , it 's bad . 
  spain is getting near to 50 million people living here , let 's not pretend madrid controls everything , as it 's just a preposterous claim . 
  the central corridor is just another option , there are advantages and disadvantages . 
   who said we are going to close borders ? 
  that 's exactly what we do n't want to do and it is what spain and the rest of the eu countries will get if they veto the catalonia entry in the eu . 
  well , you said it one sentence afterwards . 
  you are going to close them and wo n't open them until they let you enter eu - you are to blame , not them . 
  and then again , that will harm you more than spain and france , that will find alternative ways . 
  it 's always used it as a kind of extorsion ( hey , we will close your borders !, 
  you will have no way to go through catalonia !, 
  you either let us in , or we 'll close the frontier ) , but i 'm not sure it will work that way . 
   we are the bad guys . 
  no , you are trying to protect your interests , madrid and aragon are trying to protect theirs . 
  when you do it , it 's economy , it 's sensible , we just want the best . 
  when they do it , they are catalanophobes and just want to piss you off . 
  you want one corridor because it will benefit you , aragon wants the one that will benefit them . 
  plus , aragon is not going to become independent , so a corridor would stay in spain whatever happens , so it 's win-win for the rest of spain . 
  do n't pretend that difference is caused by hate towards catalonia . 
  not like duran i lleida is the only person that insults people from andalucia/extremadura , but what he said was pretty harsh ( had the situation been inverted , had it been ch\u00e1ves talking about catalonia , you would have seen this printed in every secesionist propaganda for the rest of times ) . 
  you talked before about the hatred after the plane crash - i see as much hate whenever there is a talk about per , for example . 
  yes , a lot of spaniards insult people from catalonia , but the same happens at almost every region - and you always try to make it look like it 's `` the evil madrid '' . 
  there is much more spain far from madrid , and we all have to deal with problems and hatred , but i do n't think dividing ourselves is the best way to deal with our problems . 
  welp , that 's a good way to cover downvotes . 
  `` hey , they downvoted me , but it 's because they hate me ! '' . 
  plus i do n't think there 's more than ~ 10 active spaniards here . 
  catalanophobic propaganda is the answer to the one you seem to have against the rest of spain ( being from andalucia i can tell you it 's pretty boring to see every politician saying they do n't want to keep paying us , we 're a bunch of lazy people , etc ) . 
   50 years ago france 's relations with spain were almost completely shut down . 
  also , i ca n't see that super strong alliance of loyalty between france and spain that some of you try to picture . 
  trust me , last thing france wants is to have to redirect their commercial flow of transport of goods through the center pyrinees . 
  though that is spain 's wet dream because it 'd mean it 'd go all through madrid ( even more than now ) . 
  not really , that 's aragon 's wet dream because they would finally get a piece of the cake , and would get the central corridor that catalonia has been shutting down for a while to support the mediterranean one . 
  plus , are you really going to close borders ? 
  will you force them to use alternative routes ? 
  aight , but you should realise that will destroy your economy . 
  september 27th are the elections , not the referendum for independence . 
  different things , and it 's just stupid to try to use those elections for other means . 
  do they want to force people to vote only based in whether they want independence or not ? 
  yes or no will be all the political options available ? 
  as a southerner i do n't think i could deal with those horrible northern winters . 
  i 'm also fine with my +40 \u00bac summers . 
  i guess the weather alone would be a huge argument against moving away from me, 
  if past counts , you have mr. [ niels henrik abel ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/niels_henrik_abel ) , a top notch mathematician, 
  podemos is suffering a lot of media pressure lately , it feels like la sexta is now their only `` supporter '' whereas before they were in many tv channels . 
  like last week 's * documentary * about venezuela aired on antena 3 , while all parties try to focus on the friendship between podemos ' leaders and venezuelan psuv . 
  and it also feels like cs has taken their place in the media as `` this is now the mainstream change party '', 
  at a national level , psoe and podemos will be much closer , andalucia being the last fortress of the psoe where they 've always won for 33 years in a row . 
   i was hoping c 's to have more power in the parliament .
