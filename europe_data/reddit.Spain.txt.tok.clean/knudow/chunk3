  oh , i 'm curious about what people from south america think about the topic . 
  was the brazilian girl saying that they were american too or was it `` do n't call us americans !, 
  it bothers me a bit that you kept referring to yourself as `` america '' , the name of the whole continent ( there are several continent models ) , to the point that everybody now uses america to talk about a country inside the continent of america . 
  it makes things confusing . 
  but i do n't hate you . 
  basically the whole coast of spain has separatist movements : [ map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/separatismos_na_espanha.svg/500px-separatismos_na_espanha.svg.png ) this is just the map of regions with a political party focused on separating , it does n't mean that it 's supported by a lot of people . 
  the only ones i think can succed are the catalan and basque ones . 
  in some regions people have a separatist feeling but know that there 's no way their region can support itself . 
  we are a bunch of kingdoms with different cultures and languages stuck together in a country , of course we are a nation of nations !, 
  basically all stereotypes people think about spain are stereotypes people in spain think about andalucians . 
   also , is there an undergoing process of homogenization of these cultures , especially among the youth ? 
  nope . 
  youth people are proud of their own cultures . 
  now i imagine a lot of pissed people pointing up and shouting : `` fuck the sky ! '', 
  basically what you just said . 
  people do n't swear on public media but everyone swears in their daily speech apart from a few uptight people . 
  in spain we also like to shit on things . 
  it 's normal to swear by saying `` me cago en ( i shit on ) '' and then adding whatever you feel like . 
  me cago en la mar - i shit on the sea me cago en la puta - i shit on the whore me cago en la hostia - i shit on the \u00bf communion wafer ? 
  me cago en la puta madre que te pari\u00f3 - i shit on the whore mother that gave birth to you old people will possibly glare at you if you shit on god , which is a common expressi\u00f3n ( me cago en dios ) kids use a `` light '' version of these things . 
  like saying fudge instead of fuck in english . 
  they can change `` me cago '' to `` cachis '' and say things like `` cachis en la mar '' ( i do n't think `` cachis '' has any meaning ) or keep the shitting part but change the other . 
  `` me cago en la fruta '' ( fruit ) instead of puta , or `` me cago en ros '' ( no meaning ) instead of dios, 
  i think it varies from city to city . 
  in mine we have different containers for recycling and organic matter . 
  organic matter is picked every night by garbage men around 4am from monday to saturday . 
  it 's technically forbidden to throw your garbage in the container before 8 or 9pm or sundays , but people do it anyway . 
  recycling containers are emptied less often . 
  the do this during the day because it gets noisy . 
  woah , i did n't know that . 
  even if it is n't `` the one '' , the cup 's story and journey is awesome . 
  i ca n't think of a national treasure that represents spain as a whole , but in asturias is definitely the victory cross ( [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/victory_cross ) ) ( [ image ] ( http://arte.laguia2000.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/oviedo_-_catedral_camara_santa_02.jpg ) ) . 
  it was made in 908 and given by king alfonso iii of asturias to the cathedral of oviedo . 
  legend says ( it 's been debunked recently ) that inside the cross was the original wooden cross that king pelayo made in covadonga when he started the reconquista . 
  it became asturias ' [ coat of arms ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/escudo_de_asturias.svg/500px-escudo_de_asturias.svg.png ) and [ flag ] ( http://fotos.elcomerciodigital.com/201005/bandera.jpg ) bonus pics of pelayo with his cross in different statues along asturias [ statue 1 ] ( http://mm.queaprendemoshoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/don-pelayo-estatua-em-gijon-674x1024.jpg ) [ statue 2 ] ( https://guerrayhistoria.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/pelayo.jpg ), 
  subtitles when i 'm alone , dubbed when i 'm watching it with friends, 
  back in the day you could buy paperback european comics for cheap ( 3 $ or so ) in newsstands . 
  i used to read a lot of spanish , french and belgian comics when i was a kid . 
  there were special comics that had a lot of different comics inside , something like the japanese manga magazines . 
  it had a lot of different stories and you had to buy it every week ( or month , i do n't remember ) in order to continue the story . 
  then they stopped selling the paperbacks version . 
  you now have to buy a 13 $ hardback with the same number of pages . 
  i 'm sorry , mortadelo , spirou , i ca n't afford that :( i started buying marvel comics ( dc is not that big here . 
  marvel has a lot of single issues every month , while dc comics are usually released in a kind of tpb format that include a bunch of issues together ( they also have single issues for some series , but a lot less than marvel ) ) well , i started buying comics before civil war . 
  all was great untill civil war started and triying to buy and read all the crossovers was such a pain in the ass i almost gave up ... then world war hulk happened and i stopped buying comics . 
  i ca n't stand so many crossovers in both marvel and dc . 
  now the only regular us comic i buy is the walking dead . 
  i started buying manga when i was in high school . 
  i have n't stopped yet . 
  whenever i visit the store to get my monthly volumes i see all the marvel covers looking at me ... but no , i 'm not going to fall for that again !!, 
  little spirou also looks at me and i feel so sad , but it 's just too much money . 
  it 's only for one week each year ( in most places ) and it brings a lot of money to local businesses, 
  must be a barcelona thing . 
  i 've never seen a sombrero for sale in all my life : s, 
  this is why i watch eurovision every year . 
  i 've had this song in my phone since then . 
  i love it when it starts playing when using the shuffle mode . 
  you 're right !, 
  i 've never heard those terms used for that . 
  i just asked my whole family and they looked at me weird when i read comadre 's definition out loud, 
  edit : i 'm wrong , we have the terms `` compadre '' ( co-father ) and `` comadre '' ( co-mother ) it took me a while to get your question . 
  no , in spain we just refer to them as `` my son 's godfather '' or `` my goddaughter 's parents '', 
   no , no you probably would n't . 
  of course i would . 
  swearing is something so normal you do n't stop and think before saying it . 
   the most famous imo are ast\u00e9rix , tintin , titeuf , lucky luke , marsupilami , iznogoud . 
  no spirou or the smurfs ? 
  i think the american version are not the same of what we had here . 
  judging by pictures i 've seen , you have a lot of those sugary pieces in the cereal . 
  here we just had the loops . 
  i only recall eating cereals with those sugary things once . 
  they felt weird . 
  and then i suppose the eu banned them . 
  i think kellogg 's stopped selling froot loops all over europe years ago . 
  i 'd love to eat them again before i die . 
  by law you ca n't work more than 8 hours per day in spain . 
  shops divide this in something like opening from 9am to 1pm and then from 5pm to 9pm . 
  offices and things like that do a `` you start at x time , you can leave for 1 hour to have lunch , but you are going to work 8 hours '' so basically everyone goes to eat at 1-4pm or so . 
  those are the eating times . 
  after that , restaurants usually close for a while because they have to clean the kitchen , floor and everything and get ready to open again after a while . 
  now , there could be a lot of ways to employ people at a bar/restaurant . 
  if you make enough money you could hire 2 cooks and 2 waiters each day and make them start work when the bar opens , at ~ 8am . 
  then their daily work ends at 4pm and the second cook and second waiter will work from 5pm to 1am or so . 
  you still have to close for a while after lunch . 
  but most bars/restaurants are family owned bar , so the owners work there too and the are there all day . 
  what they do is manage themselves from 8 to 12 , then the hired cook and waiter will come from 12 to 16 , when there 's a lot of people drinking and eating , go home/rest until 20 and come back again from 20 to 24 , when people go out drinking and having dinner again . 
  the owners close for a while at 16 so they can clean everything , maybe go get the kid from school ( ends at 17 usually ) and they 'll open again after cleaning , usually just the bar . 
  i think i spent too much thinking and rewritting all this and now i do n't know if it makes any sense whatsoever . 
  hum ... 83 universities with 243 campuses http://rankinguniversidad.es/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cuantas-universidad-espana.png for example , in asturias there 's one university , the `` university of oviedo '' , but there are campuses in multiple cities . 
  cities are close , so even if your campus is in another city , it 's only a 30-40 min drive so people usually live with their parents if they go to a nearby campus . 
  you do n't live in campus , you just go to class everyday like in high school and then back home when classes end, 
  on the basis of your results , we estimate you know 73 % of the english words . 
  you said yes to 80 % of the existing words . 
  you said yes to 7 % of the nonwords . 
  is a bit weird testing your english knowledge when the difficult words are all latin words ... 
  i think every city/town/village / region has cool things to see . 
  everytime you hear someone talk about spain it 's always `` oh , yes , i 've been to madrid/barcelona , it was great !! '', 
  ask any spaniard not living in a big city like that if they want to live there ... most of them will say : `` fuck no , it 's great in here !! '', 
  less , of course . 
  i 'm sure the big cities have a lot of diversity , but if you go to smaller cities ...
