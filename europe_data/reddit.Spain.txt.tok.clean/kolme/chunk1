well , spanish party `` podemos '' has an official subreddit , where the politicians do * amas * and the like . 
  they should have access , i guess . 
  money laundering , organized crime ? 
  hey , sounds like our government !, 
  yes , it is relatively common . 
  and i actually never thought about the `` meaning '' of the surname . 
  i would n't trust her with my life . 
  - __ she 's involved in one of the biggest corruption scandals in spain __ ( let that rest a bit , one of the * biggest * corruption scandals in * spain * ) . 
  she told the judge she did n't know anything about the big ass car she had sitting in her garage . 
  - __ she has literally no knowledge in the health field . __ zero . 
  that was made clear in the press conference where she were surrounded by experts and the only thing she did ( other than reading some introduction at the beginning ) was refusing to answer about her resignation . 
  funnily enough , there 's a minister which is a qualified doctor , but she 's not the health minister . 
  - __ brought two sick people from africa , against the advice of many experts . __ nurse associations complained that they did n't have the means to treat them ( even less after the spend cuts ) . 
  many believe that the fact that they were priests , was a deciding factor ; this government had said before things like `` the virgin protects spain '' and such looney stuff . 
  - __ they lied in the press conference , and appeared very hesitant . __ what they say does n't fit with the medical staff version . 
  honestly , they were just trying to cover their own ass , parroting slogans like `` all necessary safety measures were taken '' , where the truth is : they let a nurse , who said had fiber , after directly attending affected people , go on vacation . 
  she came back to the hospital with symptoms , * on her own foot * . 
  yes , our politicians are not the best . 
  according to the [ royal spanish academy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/real_academia_espa%c3%b1ola ) , it means : - [ a group of bushes ] ( http://lema.rae.es/drae/srv/search?id=uolipmvmudxx2awqkjyo ) . 
  - first person singular of * [ matar ] ( http://lema.rae.es/drae/srv/search?id=klzby38hedxx2bjj6syf ) * ( to kill ) in the present tense : * yo mato , t\u00fa matas , \u00e9l mata . 
  * i did n't know about the first one , it 's probably not used very often . 
  a bunch of related words have the same root , though : * matojo , matorral , mata ... *, 
  well that 's impressive , having words that span from '' \u00f8 '' to `` speciall\u00e6gepraksisplanl\u00e6gningsstabilliseringsperiode '' ;-), 
  right , i was `` germanizing '' it . 
  thanks for satisfying my curiosity !, 
  very interesting !, 
  does '' \u00e5\u00f8 '' mean `` river island '' ? 
  ( the river being middle sized ), 
  do you guys have any shorter words , like just the \u00b0 ? 
  who elected this hoompa loompa anyways , and why does she have effective power over sovereign nations ? 
  ^ no , ^ seriously , ^ somebody ^ enlighten ^ me . 
  most galizians i 've met are heavy spanish nationalists , heck , even franco was born there !, 
  i think they would rather fight for spain annexing portugal :p, 
  many people in spain are all for the vote in catalonia ( including me ) because , you know : democracy , self determination , etc. 
  hopefully there will be a political change in the next elections and podemos , equo and other forces can enter the parliament and change the tone of the talks . 
  also , i do n't think the spanish army would march in catalonia if you `` became independently independent '' . 
  i do n't think anybody in spain would want that other than neonazis or `` franquists '' ( and lucky us/you , they 're not on the rise ) . 
   the finns , who were not starving , soon dubbed the rrab-3 cluster bomb `` molotov 's bread basket '' , and named the improvised incendiary device that they used to counter soviet tanks the `` molotov cocktail '' , as `` a drink to go with the food '' . 
  huehuehue , you finn guys are _ the bomb . _, 
  i live in berlin , if that makes it any harder ;-), 
  free circulation of people is useful . 
  i 'm not interested in the eu turning into a military superpower . 
  although i usually disagree with * frau merkel * , i 'm with her on this one . 
  military escalation is * not * the sensible answer . 
  the internal discourse of the kremlin is `` the west is onto us '' . 
  if we plant military presence right outside their border , we 're just giving them more reasons to step up their game . 
  fire to put out fire . 
  she actually said `` nope , we do n't want to provoke the russians '' ( or something along the lines ) . 
  that 's what i heard on tv anyways , on _ die tagesschau _ . 
   * brb flushing penises down the toilet . 
  3nl4rg3 y0ur p3n15 by 5 1nch35 !, 
  thanks !, 
  * finally * some actual arguments . 
  no , why do n't * you * take him seriously ? 
  that 's your only reason ? 
  because of the college radical hippies ? 
  anarchism does n't have anything to do with throwing cobblestone . 
  it 's not a core concept . 
  many anarchists are completely against all kinds of violence ( i have no proof , but my personal experience tells me most of them ) . 
  citing wikipedia : `` many anarchists oppose all forms of aggression , supporting self-defense or non-violence ( anarcho-pacifism ) '' . 
  just being curious , what does make you do n't taking him seriously ? 
   should be decentralized , with decisions made by horizontal consultation and consensus . 
  the key concept , and exactly what people do n't understand about anarchism . 
  not all of them are anti-organization , also not all of them are against democratic reformation . 
  for example , libertarian socialism is considered a form of anarchy . 
  the problem with the word is that it 's got a very broad meaning . 
  citing wikipedia , `` as a subtle and anti-dogmatic philosophy , anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy . 
  anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view , instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy '' . 
  i think what all we can agree on is opposing hierarchical power . 
  nobody should decide how you live or what you do based on his position in the hierarchy . 
  but we can still organize and decide together what to do . 
  well , chomsky is not a teenager anymore . 
  and i think everybody takes him seriously ( at the very least , his linguistic facet ) . 
  as a spaniard living `` abroad '' i also get the feeling spaniards do n't understand portuguese , but the portuguese do understand spanish . 
  we spanish people sometimes experience what english speaking people also experience abroad , but much milder : many people speak your native language , in tourist locations things are in spanish , etc ; and you can get away with not speaking the local or common language fluently . 
  also spain 's education system is admittedly awful . 
  when confronted with a `` foreigner '' for the first time , an average spaniard has only listened to * real * english no more than a couple of hours of canned text book cd 's . 
  of course we do n't understand shit . 
  i 'm so sorry that you 're right . 
  i 've been told this by many portuguese people : `` when we go over to spain , we speak spanish , when you come over , you speak spanish too ! '', 
  if it makes you happier , people from galicia understands portuguese perfectly , and if try hard i can understand brazilian people pretty good . 
  jokes aside , it 's such a shame !, 
  it takes us spaniards very little effort , and it sounds very beautiful !, 
  my anecdotal experience , as a berlin resident , also * weist drauf hin * . 
  happens in spain too , very isolated rural areas of spain where vasque or catalan is `` monolingually '' spoken by very humble people , often very old people . 
  that 's why even though i 'm from the south were we speak only spanish , i am all for mandatory bilingual lettering in those regions ( yes , it 's funny but in spain that 's sometimes a hot political debate , go figure ) . 
  ** edit : ** not only mandatory lettering , all civil servants should speak the regions language , etc. 
   stop being gay ( as i made you ) or your family drowns !, 
  -- love you , god . 
  joke 's on you . 
  i 'm from spain . 
  agreed , it 's grrrreat !, 
  and if so , * why * ? 
  [ see my other comment . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1xie46/two_million_british_people_emigrated_to_eu/cfc3kr0 ) tldr : it 's in the little details . 
  people who do n't understand the language around them look detached , they do n't interact with the environment in a natural way . 
  for example , somebody says something funny in the line and everybody stares and laughs , tourists just grin with a `` wat ? '', 
  face . 
  natives quickly glance through the menu instead of staring at it with a puzzled look . 
  you can tell apart a non-speaker a mile far away .
