  and switching to english is something pretty common in berlin . 
  i 'm pretty fluent in german , and i still get people speaking to me in english . 
  does n't matter where you come from , english is the standard fallback . 
  most disturbing is to me though , is how accurately people can tell i 'm spanish just by the looks . 
  yeah , berlin `` is '' also the second turkish city by population . 
  http://www.thebubblebubble.com/china-bubble/ yes it could burst . 
  and what would probably happen is another economic crisis . 
  china buys most of the us debt , so it 's tied tightly to western economy . 
  just google `` china economic bubble '' , you do n't have to believe my word . 
  corrupt enough to integrate in the eu . 
  ^ do n't ^ ^ take ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ ^ seriously , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ was ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ kidding . 
  i knew you guys were eu material :'), 
  quickly growing economies are the perfect environment for growing bubbles ( sometimes the quick growth is just a symptom of the bubble ) . 
  china , for example , is just a massive bubble in itself ( although i think that concerns the us more than us ) i was just wondering `` aloud '' . 
  apologies for not actually reading the article -- i 'm currently at work . 
  ^ i ^ became ^ aware ^ when ^ one ^ day ^ googling ^ it ... ^ before ^ that ^ i ^ had ^ no ^ idea ^ \\ ( it ^ is ^ derived ^ from ^ my ^ actual ^ surname ) . 
  ^ thanks ^ for ^ the ^ tip , ^ though !, 
  so , does that mean that the next time a bubble bursts we 're all going down with them ? 
  i happened to live at the time in kreuzberg , at a corner which was always busy with people partying . 
  so it was more like a bunch of loud pubs in a street , not really a city wide frenzy . 
  i was living in germany a couple of years ago when lena , the german contestant won . 
  i had no fucking idea she won , let alone who she was or that eurovision was going on . 
  so i 'm chilling at home and go out to the street to buy cigarettes . 
  streets filled with people cheering , german flags everywhere , out of fucking nowhere . 
  wtf ? 
  i ask a girl , shouting over the loud cheering , '' ** what is going on ? ** '' . 
  '' ** lena won , wooohhooo !! ** '' . 
  ** who is lena !? 
  ** , i shout . 
  -- ** was ? 
  ** -- ### ** who is lena !? 
  ** she laughed and told me , and i got some funny looks from people around . 
  bought the cigarettes and went right back home . 
  and that 's the most excited i * ever * got about eurovision . 
  about 250 billion annually in our `` underground economy '' , and increasing : http://www.lavanguardia.com/economia/20140129/54399683663/tecnicos-de-hacienda-cifran-la-economia-sumergida-en-el-24-6-pib.html roughly a 25 % of the economy . 
  in spain ( according to the tax institution ) it 's about 250 billion annually , and increasing : http://www.lavanguardia.com/economia/20140129/54399683663/tecnicos-de-hacienda-cifran-la-economia-sumergida-en-el-24-6-pib.html roughly a 25 % of the economy . 
  yeah , that 's a quarter of the whole economy . 
  germany is * very * corrupt . 
  still not world-class corrupt like spain is , but it is very corrupt . 
  to point something significant out , [ germany signed but did not comply ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_convention_against_corruption#signatures.2c_ratifications_and_entry_into_force ) with the un conventions against corruption . 
  also , the [ ber airport fiasco ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21569065-so-much-industrious-germans-doing-things-time-eternal-building-site ) looks very familiar to me . 
  seems like a good old spanish-style corruption . 
  ( do n't get me wrong , i love germany -- it 's just not the holy grail of perfectionism that some people think it is ), 
  i 'm from spain but i live in germany . 
  and by your username i guess we 're also about the same age . 
  mediterranean emigrants high-five ;-), 
  but hey , at least you live in a gorgeous island !, 
  ^ ^ \\ ( was ^ ^ there ^ ^ last ^ ^ summer ), 
  although the matter can be , so to speak , * philosophically debated * ; in this very case it is the catholic powers who are pushing this , for religious reasons . 
  in my opinion you 're both right . 
  quotes from both sides struck me as unbelievable . 
  shamelessness , double standards , and only pure geopolitical and economical interests . 
  the whole thing is pretty `` cold-warish '' , i hope it does n't end in a proxy war in ukraine . 
  i love these things !, 
  i 'd love to have one of every european country . 
  absolutely !, 
  settle guys , it was a ~ ~ n ~ ~ * european * discovery . 
  you guys have pro- and anti-muslim parties ? 
  well , debates between members of those must be ... interesting . 
  we do , specially those who 've been to other eu countries , which are a lot . 
  [ yes . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_the_second_spanish_republic ) i 'd rather keep the current one , though ; just leaving the monarchy symbols out . 
  for diplomacy reasons and because everyone in the world knows the current one . 
  only the king , as written in the constitution . 
  as for the daughter ... well , she does have good contacts . 
  yes , there is , sort of . 
  have you ever seen red - yellow - purple flags in spanish leftist demonstration ? 
  those are spanish republic flags . 
  they 're to be seen in this sub too . 
  come on dude , you should rally for catal\u00e0 . 
  do you even independentism ? 
  he was appointed by franco himself as his successor . 
  shortly before dying , franco said something along the lines `` do n't worry guys , i leave everything * tied , and well tied * '' . 
  well , it took me  20 years of my life to realize what he meant . 
  and he was right !, 
  the juan carlos savior of all spaniards and paladin of democracy and all things nice \u00a9 is the sweetened version in the happy land . 
  truth is , spain is still under the control of the families that were in control back then . 
  heck , even the politicians , judges and aristocracy are descendants of the * original * ones !, 
  oh , how i wish to see the borbons kicked out in my lifetime ... * dreamy sigh *, 
  not really gossipy . 
  it 's the royal family stealing millions . 
  why ? 
  and where are you from , if i may ask ? 
  edit : just curious , not that i want to * win you over * . 
  * imputar * -  summon  desimpute unsummon ? 
  disregard ? 
  we republicans have been informed about it for a long time . 
  to put it in perspective , the king was `` almost poor '' when he arrived 40 years ago , and now has one of the biggest fortunes in europe . 
  they changed `` charged '' for `` summoned over '' . 
  she did n't get charged ( yet ) and probably never will :( oh well , hope is the last to die . 
  this is already very good news , anyways . 
  the spanish monarchy 's image is getting really bad , both nationally and internationally . 
  that 's a good start !, 
  bae caught me arm racing, 
  i think you 'll likelier get boned by the kgb and then murdered by putin 's daughter . 
  sounds like they all have one big , collective penis . 
  but , but i 'm andalusian :(, 
  we 're going back to the past . 
  see you guys in the future !, 
  ^ ^ maybe,
