  there are not so many extremists in spain , really . 
  i agree on many things with / u/angry _ spaniard , but not really in this matter . 
  spanish people , although traditionally catholic , are pretty forward-thinking . 
  spain is the world leading country in gay acceptance , for example . 
  what happens in spain is , most people do n't really care about politics . 
  or they do , but are too lazy to go to vote . 
  or think it does n't change anything . 
  the biggest winner in spanish elections is always the abstention . 
  the conservative party ( pp ) voters do always vote `` religiously '' , so they always have a solid base . 
  left wing voters , on the other hand , are not so forgiving of their parties , and tend to punish them in the elections after a scandal . 
  even though , the social democrat party is the party which stayed the longest in power in the spanish democracy . 
  that sums it up very well indeed . 
  i do n't think so . 
  in case of things going down that road , first it would need to go diplomatically through the eu , otan , onu and all the entities to which both uk and es belong . 
  it 's never going to happen though . 
  they 'll exchange some nice words and rajoy will come back chanting victory and proclaiming himself savior of the country ( whatever the outcome ) . 
  agreed !, 
  the pp always pull this ace from the hole whenever they 're in trouble and need a smoke bomb ( and boy do they need one ) . 
  they also like to brag about how they 're `` defending spain '' . 
  but let me tell you , rajoy has already shat his pants . 
  he does n't even dare facing a press conference to talk to his voters . 
  i bet he 's scared to death , he 'll be nope'ing out of the situation like a little bitch in no time . 
  quoting himself : * it 's bery difficult todo esto . 
  welp , til . 
  well , it fuelled my german skills . 
  from 0 to fluent in ~ 5 years . 
  economy journalists who ignore the meaning of inflation/deflation ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  it is pure manipulation , nothing to do with ignorance . 
  ( btw , i know `` el pais '' very well . 
  they 're not to be trusted ) . 
  spanish politicians said we 're not in depression , we just have temporarily `` negative growth '' . 
  i cringe every time i remember this . 
  that 's good !, 
  it means the people in power are afraid of you guys . 
  all my support to the protesters !, 
  pats on the back all around guys !, 
  now let 's all think about our nobel price . 
  wow so europe such fraternity, 
  late edit : hey , you changed your flair , sneaky bastard !, 
  this is the right answer . 
  spanish is pretty straight-forward , as you 've surely already realized !, 
  it 's got not so many exceptions as english or german ( which are my second and third languages ) , and if you can read a word , you can automatically pronounce . 
  that 's why we do n't have spelling bee contests in spanish-speaking countries ( they do n't make any sense here ) . 
  good luck in your journey , and just pm me if you need some directions !, 
  correct : d\u00eda is exactly the same case : a diphthong which is `` broken down '' to form a hiatus . 
  i 'm guessing you 're learning ( or you already did ) spanish as a second language , in that case i guess they do n't usually go so deep inside our accenting rules ; unless you 're doing a spanish major or something like that . 
  i learned all that stuff at school , as i was born and raised in spain . 
  i googled around and there seems to be lots of resources about it , [ this one looked good to me ] ( http://spanishaccents.bc.edu/rules.html ) . 
  apart from those rules , there are a bunch of exceptions ( example : _ el _ vs _ \u00e9l _ -- _ the _ vs _ he _ ) . 
  those are mostly to differentiate two words which sound exactly the same . 
  they 're called [ acentos diacr\u00edticos ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/acento_diacr%c3%adtico ) and luckly there are not so many of them !, 
  no , because `` i '' is a weak vowel and `` o '' a strong one , so when they 're together they form a syllable ( this association is called a diphthong ) . 
  this association can be broken with an accent on the weak vowel , so summing up : adi\u00f3s -  a-di\u00f3s ad\u00edos -  a-d\u00ed-os adios -  \u00e1-dios the strong vowels are `` a '' , `` e '' and `` o '' and the weak ones `` i '' and `` u '' . 
  that 's the reason why mar\u00eda and r\u00edo ( river ) , for example , are written with an accent . 
  definitely . 
  i 've got the impression europe is getting racist as fuck ( maybe we already were ? ), 
  football , i guess ? 
  and not a single thing was damaged . 
  they just had to paint them over . 
  germany . 
  spanish banks are not known for their honesty . 
  they 're always trying to con the heck out of people . 
  some stuff on the news lately : - they sold toxic assets to very old / illiterate people , by lying about everything - in spain , if you fail to pay a loan , you lose your house . 
  but you * still * owe the bank - they lobby for lowering salaries , they often bribe politicians - they evade money , do money laundry , etc. 
  - they artificially keep the housing prices high , so that they do n't lose any money in assets ( they have thousands of empty houses ) with the support of the government i could go on and on about how these guys are screwing the spanish society . 
  it is * not * as simple as you said . 
  if the legal contract is draconian , then yes . 
  legal does n't mean ethic . 
  i 'd rather have a jam\u00f3n serrano as a king as the current family ^ oh ^ and ^ ib\u00e9rico ^ de ^ bellota ^ if ^ possible !, 
  not strange ? 
  it happens to me like * always * . 
  well , in his defense , i also own beko wash machine , and they are reliable af . 
  and they are quite cheap !, 
  he 's in it just for the banter . 
  the absolute mad lad . 
  thanks , obama !, 
   falling public support well , was it supported by anyone , to begin with ? 
  this was completely unasked for !, 
  i actually had `` lapdogs '' in mind when i wrote it , but i think that 's a spanish idiom , i do n't know if it makes sense in english . 
  accomplices . 
  maybe usa would have not gone to war without any supporters . 
  being 100 % honest , i would not touch that shit , not even with a 10ft pole . 
  stripping nationality is a human rights violation . 
  most normal people ( who are aware of the severe consequences ) would not agree with that , even for very dangerous criminals . 
  i do n't think so . 
  the people were pretty upset about him lying about the terrorist attack of 11/3 . 
  energetic lobbies wo n't allow it and they 're pretty deep in the government . 
  all the former spanish pm ended up in some energetic company as `` consultants '' . 
  this companies only think in short-term benefits . 
  they 're basically committing long-term suicide and taking us all with them . 
  muslims have absolutely * nothing * to do with this . 
  you can read [ my comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/127v6w/spanish_unemployment_rate_by_province/c6sx330 ) if you 're interested in the real reasons . 
  there are also not that many , specially in comparison with france or germany . 
  * alarming high levels of institutionalized corruption . 
  * deep-rooted , ever-lasting [ clientelism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clientelism ) . 
  * no change of government ( psoe ) in the entire modern democracy . 
  * lack of any industry other than agriculture and tourism . 
  * historically an agriculture region where nowadays nobody wants to work in it ( or it is n't even worth it ) . 
  * all the land belongs to very few people .
