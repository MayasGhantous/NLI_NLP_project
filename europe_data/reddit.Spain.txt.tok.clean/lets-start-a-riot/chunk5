  so if someone visits crimea , ca n't enter ukraine ? 
  or is more because the statement ? 
  or is because he is famous ? 
  or a mix of all ? 
  nah im just upset , the whole spain should go for a walk and that includes me, 
  thats democracy . 
  in spain the second republic went a bit too far progresive ( for that times i mean ) women rights , elimination of all relations between state and church , universal vote for everyone ( women included ) above 23 , divorce and civil unions , priviledge status for catalonia and basque country , etc. 
  it backfired so bad that we ended with the civil war . 
  disclaimer : assuming we had the civil war for this alone is idiotic , the republic wasnt just flowers and good deeds , what i mean is that we ended with a dictatorship really conservative , catholic and against progressive thinking . 
  i just understand that we swallowed all the reforms without doing shit , people gave him the majority and then complaint about it . 
  someone that still votes for rajoy after all he has done deserves nothing of my respect but hey if your lovely people support a plasma tv they can vote for him all they want . 
  i hope all the people you know that support the pp did n't go to the manifestations or complaint about the social cutbacks , i hate hypocrites . 
  pp still dominating the scene , seriously spain go fuck your elf . 
  every time i see rajoy speaking i just think that `` le falta un verano , le falta un hervor , le falta una aclarada '' , he is definitely not the sharpest tool in the box . 
  pretty much yes, 
  you say that , i say it does n't . 
  how creating a pipeline from rusia to turkey can make turkey more energy independent ? 
  is n't it exactly the opposite ? 
  well the poll was done for the bbc by globescan : http://www.globescan.com/news-and-analysis/press-releases/press-releases-2013/277-views-of-china-and-india-slide-while-uks-ratings-climb.html here 's israel : http://www.globescan.com/images/images/pressreleases/bbc2013_country_ratings/bbc2531_m1ft_ctry.gif, 
  you just have to say that you are syrian and you will be living the dream in germany . 
  also you can make a polandball with this .

  i do n't know the whole list but quite sure you are right . 
  `` atentado a la autoridad '' is the name of the felony . 
  a politician that is a member of the congress falls into the category of authority . 
  members of congress , police , armed forces , judges , even some public servants ( sanitary inspectors and such ) are included in that group . 
  what are we ? 
  a bunch of pussies ? 
  we do n't throw cakes , [ we throw cars with homemade bombs to their cuarters ] ( http://www.theleader.info/550/article/45937/spain/national/madrid-pp-suffer-attempted-car-bomb-attack/ ) ( they are spanish bombs so they do n't explode ), 
  well , til . 
  i guess the apple does n't fall far from the tree, 
  atentado a la autoridad ( idk the exact translation : attack on authority ?? ), 
  is 5-6 years in prison but i do n't know what is going to happen to him since he is a minor . 
  this is not the way to go but i ca n't say that i did n't enjoy it , rajoy deserves that and more , leon style . 
  i 'm way more worried about that kid , he is 17 , a stupid kid who probably has ruined his life without daring to think twice . 
  ~ ~ right now i 'm sure there are some parents crying and nervous as fuck ~ ~ . 
  stupid kid , he is going to regret that . 
  edit : [ seems like he is not regreting it too much ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3791156/thumbs/r-agresor-large570.jpg ), 
  dead serious map of [ spain ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lkmj6h8.jpg ), 
  he killed himself so he could hunt down jesus , the overlord of the jews ( i dont know if we can link webcomics so i wont do it , but you get the idea ), 
  europe does n't have a sillicon valley like the us has , which is a huge drawback also in terms of internet bussines i would say we are rather behind . 
  apart from that i dont know . 
  fair enough, 
  competition ? 
  google buy companies like they are sweets . 
  instead of having hundreds of companies now we have one company , this kills competition and innovation , companies do n't fight against each other because they are the same one . 
  some company invented something or did something innovative ? 
  [ google buys it .

  have a nice day . 
  the black sea is not property of turkey alone , for me the two cases are the same but the article says that intercepting a russian ship is routine but intercepting a us ship is really dangerous . 
  i guess out of my personal space . 
  what i find funny about this is that you are saying that russia shouldnt fly their helicopters in the baltic close to estonian ( im not sure what country was ) airspace , doesnt matter that russia and kaliningrad are in the baltic but you dont say shit about the us sending a warship from the other side of the planet to russias frontdoor . 
  if a helicopter is a knife a missile launcher warship is an ak47 . 
  how safe do you feel with a guy that comes from the other side of the city to waive his ak in your frontdoor ? 
  a helicopter on the deck of the ship and the fighters did several passes . 
  i still dont see the similarity between a helicopter in international airspace and waiving your knife in the face of someone . 
  thats true but to be honest streets named after franco and his friends should be renamed , we have a law about this but the mayors just plain ignore it . 
  we can , its just that the eu likes to whine a lot . 
  we had fences with tear gas dispenser in ceuta and melilla and we couldnt use them because the eu said no . 
  also now we have all subsaharian inmigrant saying that he is from syria . 
  you should think about creating a foreing legion and then we will send you all the guys jumping the fence . 
  2 birds 1 stone , spain saves the eu . 
  the witcher games are that good ? 
  ive read the books ( years ago ) and they were just bad and by bad i mean bad as fuck . 
  i thought it was more polite than retard . 
   the ministry of defence in london said the typhoons saw the anti-submarine warfare helicopter on the deck of a stereguschiy class corvette when they reached the scene , in what was described as a `` friendly visit '' http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/10839095/raf-typhoons-sent-to-intercept-russian-helicopter-over-baltic.html a helicopter on the deck of the ship ... 
  seriously ?? 
  really bold move from russia . 
  i also like how the article says `` friendly visit '', 
  how did that helicopter create the incident ? 
  yes , in the baltic . 
  i like this part :  maritime/air incident  date : 18/05/14  states involved : united kingdom ; russia  geographical region : baltic  incident details : raf fighters intercept a russian helicopter and shadow it back to its parent corvette ; the fighters perform several passes of the warship . 
   category : near-routine and then this :  us warship harassed by russian aircraft in the black sea  date : 12/04/14  states involved : united states ; russia  geographical region : black sea  incident details : an unarmed russian fighter aircraft made 12 passes of the american warship the uss cook . 
   category : serious . 
  such aggressive behaviour , if repeated by an armed aircraft , could have resulted in the ship commander targeting the aircraft in an act of self-defence . 
  russian near us ship ? 
  aggresive behaviour british near russian ship ? 
  near - routine, 
  you ca n't just shot down an aircraft in international airspace just because it has its transponders switched off . 
  they are flying avobe the baltic sea not above estonia , so they are not violating anything in those incidents . 
  also if you read the articles the 2 times they entered inside estonia airspace  the aircraft stayed 1.2 nautical miles deep in estonian airspace for about a minute . 
  the aircraft 's transponder was switched on and it had previously given the control a flight plan , according to which it was meant to fly only in the international airspace . 
  what should spain do to the uk in this case : http://blogs.new.spectator.co.uk/2013/08/when-the-tory-mp-accidentally-invaded-spain-with-the-royal-marines/ thank god you are just a reddit armchair general , if you were in charge spain would be at war with the british . 
  hahahahahahaha bullshit dude , how many gypsis do you know ? 
  you get it wrong , you are surrounded by water not to prevent invasions but to keep you away from the rest of europe .
