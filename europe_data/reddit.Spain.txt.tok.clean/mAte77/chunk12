  i do n't give a crap . 
  you are actively advocating in favour of dominant and residual cultures . 
  i do n't want to be in a country where there is n't equality between cultures . 
  period . 
   i really do n't understand this argument - why have tv shows in a language the majority of the population does n't understand ? 
  are you playing dumb ? 
  i hope you are . 
   i mean , here you are n't even considering that every single city has stereotypes that are flat out false , and also , catalonia has a rich history related to bullfighting ( and you ca n't blame this on castilla as well ) , and flamenco originated not in castilla but mainly from the gypsy culture . 
  i simply do not one people to associate bulls and flamenco with catalonia . 
  that 's all . 
  you are yet again saying `` fuck catalan culture when you can have castillan culture there '' . 
  as for the flamenco having gypsy originins , i do n't care either . 
  spain has embraced it and it 's an important part of the culture . 
  anyway , i get your message . 
  you are all for a spain of nations as long as they their name is catsile . 
  they did suffer , not as much , so what ? 
  do we get extra points for having a democratically elected president executed ? 
  or having our language forbid ? 
  or having most of our textile industrie semi-shut down by the government because it did n't fit the necessities of the regime ? 
  am i supposed to be better than you because we had to hide like rats in some basement to hear some catalan band or read and discuss about some books . 
  what 's the point of this comment of yours ? 
  what does it have to do with what i said ? 
  as of 2010 when everything started . 
   i do n't think castilla can be considered to be dominant over the rest . 
  except when the language that originated there has been extended , sometimes imposed , to the rest of the country . 
  expect if you turn on the tv or the radio 75 % of the channels are in spanish , and except for the fact that people believe that flamenco and toros are typical in barcelona . 
  re-read . 
  i never suggested there are a lot ** now ** . 
  i said that if franco was able to win a war and stay 40 years in power , well , there must have been quite a good amount of people that were okay with him , both during and after the war . 
  also , saying all of spain suffered from the guy is correct , but saying that there was as opression in teruel , salamanca , zamora , segovia , ciudad real , ja\u00e9n , extremadura , and huge etc. 
  as there was in catalonia , the basque country or madrid i simply wrong . 
   it 's plain false in this case though , considering i was just expressing my own opinion , i guess you know better than myself how i feel and what are my reasons to feel that way . 
   you just want to make it look like that ... that 's the whole point . 
  twist . 
  i was twisting words , i was twisting the reality . 
  it 's all manipulation . 
  always . 
   because you perfectly know that there are many catalans that actually feel spanish and do n't want to secede . 
  even if you hate that , in your insides . 
  hell yes i know , for fucks sake , i live in the place you know ? 
  elections are coming , do n't worry that we will find out the actual figures with the only way you 've left us . +, 
  show me one of these people . 
  a tweet , a facebook post , anything . 
  people asking to put bombs in catalan demonstrations happens every single fucking time there 's one . 
  or every time bar\u00e7a plays an important match . 
  except the brits were all for a referendum and i only remembered nice words to the scots encouraging to stay . 
  what i read from the spanish counterparts is that 1 ) everything is a plot by mas to cover corruption 2 ) we are all brain-washed and fed up with nationalistic propaganda 3 ) fuck you you ca n't get a referendum because law , regrdless of how pathetically antidemocratic it is . 
  you really need to look up `` sarcasm '' in the dictionary ... 
   and last but not least ... catalans also feel spanish , millions of them . 
  independentists do n't , even if they speak spanish and share most of our culture , but the identity stuff in catalonia is quite sensible and you can feel it , mostly in a peaceful way , yet it is there . 
  you do really know nothing about the matter do you ? 
  myself , andalusian father ; i speak with him every day in spanish . 
  i have several relatives in cadiz whom i visit once a year . 
  i want to feel myself spanish , i embrace spanish culture , the food , the humour , the way of living life . 
  in the next elections my father will vote independence . 
  stupid comments like pretty much all of yours in the catalan threads make it really easy to tilt the balance towards 100 % catalan 0 % spanish . 
  you are trying too hard . 
  from you understanding , the catalan people were spanish during , for example , the 13th century ? 
  you are acknowledging that `` spain '' per se is nothing , that spain is just the sum of different nations ( which btw no one in the main political parties would dare to say ) yet you are totally okay with one of these regions being the dominant over the rest . 
  false . 
  i heard somewhere that spain is at least 10,000 years old . 
  you are putting it as if franco had literally no support during any time of his ruling . 
  they won a civil war for a reason and that reason is n't 100 % german and italian help . 
  there 's a lot of ghosts from that dictatorship that still remain nowadays . 
   ca n't wait for the guardia civil to say it was 200.000 ~ ~ people ~ ~ ** arturs mas **, 
  there were concerts , activities and everything for everyone . 
  however , the rally was clearly for the independence . 
  you had to dress a particular way , you had to go to a specific place and you had to actively do some things . 
  sure there were some curious tourists wandering around , but i have n't seen any entering the concentration , basically because it 's been crowded as fuck . 
  i firmly believe there was no one that does n't support independence in the rally , and if there were they must have ended up there by mistake ; as i said , the rally is for the independence . 
  its name is `` via lliure a la rep\u00fablica catalana '' , which roughly translates to `` free way to the catalan republic '' . 
  does n't everyone abuse the rotten system ? 
  if spain wants to do a proper referendum , it 's literally in their hands . 
  to be fair being the capital of the country helps , a lot . 
  did n't know that about the balearics , though . 
  interesting . 
  a fairer share of taxes within the catalan tax-payers . 
  ( yes , egoism and what not . 
  i do n't want my taxes to go somewhere where i do n't feel wanted . 
  http://www.joserodriguez.info/bloc/la-catalanofobia-banal-de-baja-intensidad/ this is how the different regions are regarded by the rest of the country . ), 
  and simply a fairer , better country . 
  we want to build it from scratch , without the obvious flaws of an outdated constitution written after 40 years of dictatorship at a time where we would have voted a mcdonald 's menu as our constitution . 
  such foundations of a new country would mean complete freedom for the people to set no limits to social rights , freedom and many other concerns that are completely ignored by the spanish government ( eg : look into the war crimes of the spanish civil war , finally compensate the relatives of those who have family buried in some hole with hundreds of people there , abolition of bulls once and for all , etc. ) . 
  we the citizens would be able to demand the the people in charge of redacting the fundamental laws to make them absolutely intolerant towards corruption , for instance , among very important things that are wrong but there 's no way they 're going to change in spain in a foreseeable future . 
  and we will . 
  edit : about the link i posted : that data is from 1994 , 2 years after the barcelona olympics which were a honey moon of spanish pride and i 'd say things between spain and catalonia were pretty good . 
  if back then the opinion was this , imagine how things are at the moment ... 
  we only need a couple more of fucked up laws or declarations from the spanish government and we 're done . 
  they are the true engine of the independentist movement . 
  that 's what you get when you literally deny all other options of consultation . 
  you know better . 
  ugh , have n't you read the comment ? 
  we speak spanish just as good as the rest of spain ... 
  to start off , we do 3 weekly hours of spanish , not 2 . 
  we want to teach maths , science , history , geography , etc. 
  in catalan , that 's all ; a large percentage of the population is in favour of that , only some families ( some as in less than 30 or even less ) complain that there should be more spanish . 
  anyway , grades in spanish tend to be higher than the grades in catalan , and we are above the average in comparison to the rest of spain so i think things are pretty okay as they are , no need to change . 
  i actually called his post the stupid thing , not the guy himself . 
  i 'm not taking in back by any means . 
  when you spit such clear bullshit you have to prepare for being called out and receiving these kind of answers .
