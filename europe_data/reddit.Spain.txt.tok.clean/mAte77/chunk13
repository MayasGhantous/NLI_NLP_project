  it may look harsh from your point of view but i swear i see too many posts like this in this subreddit and i 'm quite fed up already . 
   the sense of superior is the reason you are were you are as a country . 
  i literally ca n't puzzle out what does that mean . 
  as for the rest of your worthless post , i would like to risk myself into wasting some more time reading your future answer so here it goes . 
  tell me one of these single facts that i bent . 
  uh , i did n't know what bodycount meant . 
  of course i do n't want anyone to die . 
  i think we are sensible enough in the xxith century not to commit such mistake . 
  bodycount ? 
  this is amazing lol . 
  what has money have to do with it ? 
  do you only know regions in the world based on their gdp ? 
  i said california as i coould 've said nebraska and the point is the same . 
  ehh no ? 
  stupidity is strong in this one . 
   how can you have independence when you were never your own country . . 
  i understand scotland independence from the union but catalonia has always been a region of aragon and then spain . 
  you are never your own country until you are . 
  what a stupid point , with that reasoning there would n't be any single country . 
  you 'd have to be a country since the beggining of times . 
   yes they have their own language ( although they all speak spanish , except some very old rural people ) , but so does galicia , vasc country , valencia , aragon . . where do you stop ? 
  yes everyone speaks spanish , but everyone knows catalan as well ; speaking it or not is a matter of refusing to do so . 
  catalan is used in everything , lol , it 's not some peasant language with which you can only communicate with sheep and cows in the mountains . 
  and by the way , valencia has its own language , you said it raight , which is catalan ... ( and it 's basque country fyi ) . 
  finally i would like to highlight this :  i understand scotland independence from the union but catalonia has always been a region of aragon and then spain . 
  `` catalonia has always been a region of ** aragon ** and ** then ** spain '' . 
  we are no longer a region of spain , but * also * a region of aragon . 
  and this has been like super forever right ? 
  catalan counties never existed , and the crown of aragon was an autonomous community within spain ; only disguised as a '' ??? '', 
  where we had completely different laws and taxing system than castile with no ties other than monarchic union . 
  and just so you can save it , sharing king and queen does n't fuse the countries . 
  as you very well said , scotland was a completely independent country from england , yet they shared the same king , the king of scotland , during some time . 
  i will let you know when your politicians are directly compared with nazism , fascism , communism and its leaders . 
  be advised , it probably wo n't happen . 
  idealistic ? 
  i seem to be a standard westen european civilized citizen . 
  are you really deffending a bunch of countries getting fucked over with wars and such so others can profit off it ? 
  this is like saying `` fuck democracy in arabia saudia and the middle east because it overcomes strategic interests of the usa and europe '', 
  i think we wo n't actually, 
   i only learnt about catalonia from this thread . 
  had heard the name before but had no idea what it was . 
  i 'm typically more clued in compared to most of my friends as well so probably none of them know what it is . 
  perhaps you 're a bunch of ignorants , no offense . 
  wait ... you do n't really know catalonia just as you know flandes , bavaria , toscana , california or cornwall ? 
  you just posted your opinion on why any region should n't get independece . 
  half of those are not even geographically europe , let alone culturally speaking . 
  and i ca n't believe you are comparing catalan separatism with eta , ira , the eastern rising , kosovo , or the balkan wars . 
  after some research , it has been determined that the usa gives approximately 0 fucks for both hong kong and taiwan , let alone the tibet ( lol ) . 
  why ? 
  in this subreddit : europeans : this is a risky move , you will be out of the eu , it can end up badly , etc. . . spaniards : brainwash !, 
  mas literally hitler, 
  i think you guys have n't quite grasped we are talking about china . 
   most of europe have no idea about catalonia , are you serious ? 
   ust look at crimea or donetsk republic , the world are rallying to the aid of ukraine , not crimea or donetsk perhaps that 's because ukraine is being fucking invaded by russia ?? 
  you guys make really shitty comparisons . 
  yes . 
  but it 's china . 
  are you really putting china as a role model for deplomatic relations . 
   taiwan and china have a similar dispute , yet the rest of the world seems quite unaffected by semantic fights like these , of course they are n't affected . 
  it 's china , they could militirally occupy taiwan right now and nothing would happen . 
  if unilateral independence is pulled it will have the support of a democratically elected government . 
  this has been stated everywhere , even in the spanish news . 
  god , it 's like having a discussion against a wall . 
   i consider catalonia as spanish as andalucia or madrid , and i ( i do n't think i speaking only for me ) well , maybe you should n't ? 
  that is a far fetched view of catalan society as a whole . 
   taiwan and china . 
   china, 
  the eu wo n't allow having a member of the union behaving like a dictatorial police state . 
  you live under a rock ? 
  or the philippines or egypt . 
  what 's your point ? 
  crimea has been occupied , same with the donbass region ... 
  i think there 's a * slim * difference . 
  i know , and it 's a stupid point . 
  the last year 's vote was officialy promoted by the government and everything ... 
  i wish they did that . 
  full instant international support . 
  the usa or ireland for instance . 
   as you can see from the numbers posted earlier , spain has a bigger population and economy than catalonia , so it makes total sense ( from a strictly technocratic cost-benefit perspective ) to pay more attention to what spain wants than to what catalonia wants . 
  the eu can absolutely survive without catalonia ; the converse is n't true . 
  everything you said it 's true . 
  then again , why would the eu have to forbid catalonia 's entry to the eu just to please spain ? 
  ( yes , spain can veto and blah blah , but i 'm not seeing all the european countries backing up spain on this while hurting themselves in a smaller or bigger degree ) the only country that is sensitive about this nationalisticly speaking is spain , the rest of the countries do n't give a shit and wo n't cut economic and diplomatic ties with catalan industry and business . 
  no one is willing to shoot themlseves in the foot except spain , or so i hope . 
   also , it looks from the polls as if the pro-independence parties get only a slight majority . 
  would it even be legitimate for them to declare independence when there are a great many people living in catalonia who are not entitled to vote because they 're eu citizens and not spanish ones , and who might prefer to stay in the eu ? 
  ehh , of course . 
  i remember saying in another thread this list is utterly stupid and got a fair amount of downvotes . 
  a list that lists castille , leon or cantabria as separatists movements ca n't be taken seriously , and that 's only in the spanish section . 
  you can count the actual spearatist movements with a hand . 
  lost in translation / s. 
  on a more serious note , i think this is , among other issues , one of the reasons why kicking catalonia out of the union would be waay more work and harm for the eu than keeping it . 
  the eu would be better off with an independent catalonia ( in the scenario where everyone is happy and flowers and sunshines ) than without catalonia . 
  the exit of catalonia from the eu would be 100 % to please spain , which is not an economical nor ideological motive , but a dimplomatic one . 
  doing all this just to `` teach 'em and show 'em what they get '' is hurtful for the eu, 
  exactly this . 
  if spain were dumb enough to ever take a single tank for a walk they 're done , even if they do n't shoot a single bullet . 
  sorry , did n't realize you were talking about votes , my bad . 
  here 's my answer regarding this : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jqhve/catalan_independence_about_to_become_a_reality/curhqhf, 
  ah , now i see what he meant .
