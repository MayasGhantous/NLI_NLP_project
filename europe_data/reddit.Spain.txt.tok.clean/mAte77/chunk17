  you can change the little text that appears when you hover over a flair !, 
  and you base that statement on what ? 
  and of course everybody that supports catalan independence or catalanism hates spain . 
  also , if there is something that fuels this nationalism based in hatred ( still a tiny percentage ) is these tweets and these comments , nothing else . 
  you ca n't insult without expecting to get insulted back . 
   there was no effort to stop the booing how would you exactly stop 50,000 people ( being extremely generous with that number ) from booing what they want ? 
   this kind of hate towards spain makes many spaniards sick because we have no fault in their hate-fueled nationalism top kek - https://twitter.com/search?q=putos%20catalanes&amp;src=typd[1] - https://twitter.com/search?q=himno%20bomba&amp;src=typd[2] - https://twitter.com/search?q=puta%20catalu%c3%b1a&amp;src=typd, 
  are you sure you answered the right comment ? 
  this has nothing to do with it . 
  england is a parliamentary monarchy and their cup is called the footbal association cup , as raw as that . 
  if spain does n't change the cup name , hence getting rid of its political connotancies , it is because they do not want . 
  or is it written in some article of the constitution that we ca n't change the name of the cup ? 
  - france : coupe de france de football - germany : dfb pokal - italy : coppa italia - belgium : coupe de belgique / beker van belgi\u00eb c'mon ... 
   there is anything wrong period . 
  do not try to start a mess from nothing . 
   the booing of the spanish anthem was part of this support . 
  no , both bilbao and barcelona made official statements not to boo the anthem . 
  i am not sure what point are you trying to prove . 
  not at all . 
  this king does not represent us . 
   classless and aggressive . 
  no , it 's freedom of speech . 
  charlie hebdo mocked the faith of almost a billion of people but everybody deffended his drawings because freedom of speech . 
  there are moments in life where you have to shut up and accept the circumstances and instead of getting so mad and angry at the booers you should ask `` what have we done that they act like this ? '' . 
  this is not agressive , this is agressive : - https://twitter.com/search?q=putos%20catalanes&amp;src=typd - https://twitter.com/search?q=himno%20bomba&amp;src=typd - https://twitter.com/search?q=puta%20catalu%c3%b1a&amp;src=typd, 
   let 's take a look to facts regarding fcb support of catalan nationalism : completely and utterly irrelevant . 
  the club has its stand regarding these matters and everybody is absolutely free to support the club or not . 
  it is completely legal to use catalan symbols and so on , and these kind of symbols are supported by the fans . 
  when you think what are bar\u00e7a 's colors , you think of blue , red , and yellow . 
  f.c.barcelona has never made use of independentists flags , only the `` legal '' and official one . 
  is it wrong to use that flag ? 
  shall we consider it radical and nationalistic from now on ? 
  [ is this nationalistic ? 
  ] ( http://www.corazonblanco.com/media/galeria/44/7/0/8/8/n_real_madrid_camiseta_cr7-4478807.jpg ) , | [ or this ? 
  ( look at this andalusian flag !, 
  oh , nasty ) ] ( http://www.palanganas.com/media/galeria/52/3/2/8/2/o_sevilla_fc_varios-1142823.jpg )  f\u00fatbol club barcelona is a symbol of catalan nationalism and is considered to be the `` home team '' team for catalonia . 
  despite its global image , the club is still linked to the local community anything wrong with that ? 
   jordi pujol we can be talking about the reproduction of the senegalese otter that you will manage to mention this guy one way or another . 
  i swear to god that we are not that different from scotland in terms of nationalism and usage of national symbols but it looks like it 's only wrong to do so when we do it . 
   no politics on a football field and around it is allowed !, 
  yesterday they played the final of the copa de su majestad el rey , formerly known as copa del general\u00edsimo . 
  politics where ? 
  have they ever cared for anthems being booed ? 
  is this the first time an anthem has been booed ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abkxg33ntp0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vmz55tjwpm ( french anthem being booed by , guess who ? 
  spanish fans !, 
  we better do nothing in this case ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8ccog_j50i the double standrards are strong in this one , and these are the first 3 results i got from my google search . 
  edit : analizing the downvotes ... 
  i guess it 's another case of `` completely non-nationalistic '' spaniards , who of course get deeply offended for these kind of things . 
  you are missing the fact that this has nothing to do with the clubs . 
  that is actually stupid and they should n't worry about it . 
  both teams made official statements encouraging the fans not to boo the anthem . 
  at any moment did they support it so it 'd be unfair by the institutions in charge of sanctioning the teams to do so because everything that happened was an individual and uncontrollable manifestation . 
  now that 's what i call music . 
  yet it has bothered the spanish federation , the spanish government and an important part of spaniards . 
  they plan on sanctioning both teams . 
  what can i say , that map rates the baltics even worse than catalonia and i 'd take the latvian or lithuanian government over ours or the spanish one without thinking it . 
  and regarding the money thing , it has n't even been confirmed after months of investigations ( or inventions from the newspapers ) . 
  what can i say , if you make me choose between 10,000 politicians that steal 1 euro each , or 1 politician that steals 10,000 euros , i pick the second one . 
  corruption in catalonia looks like an anechtodal problem whilst in spain it looks like it 's part of the political modus operandi itself . 
  i think it 's easier to correct the current catalan panorama than the spanish one , where corruption seems to be another aspect of scene . 
   take this as you want it , but catalonia has a problem with its current government . 
  for the record , i agree with that . 
  and you could argue that the spanish government owes money to the catalan one by not investing the billions of catalan taxes that are collected by madrid to catalonia . 
  barcelona is working with the money that la generalitat can give to them , and la generalitat are working with the money that spain let 's them ... 
  it looks like la generalitat should be able to solve such financial problem with absolutely no competences in that regard . 
  i assure you ada colau would keep her mouth shut if we were able to manage our own taxes because such problem would n't exist . 
  but bringing this point we are dragging the discussion the a point that is too far away from the initial discussion and we are not going to solve anything anyway , regardless of how it goes , everyone will stick to his ideas . 
  it 's always funny that you use this prick who has n't even been sentenced to cast a shadow on everything catalan related while every single week there is a new somewhat important spanish politician being arrested for corruption . 
  if i were to list all pp-related corruption scandals ( i say pp because they probably have the most opened cases , but the truth is that barely no important part is safe ) , i would probably need 2 comments to do so . 
  catalan politics are corrupt to an extent that is way lower than spanish politics , yet you always bring the corruption point to the discussion which is something that does n't back your side of the argument by any mean . 
  i still do n't understand it . 
  i 'm still butthurt and i 'm not even bizantian, 
  am i witnessing the birth of a new troll \u00bf, 
  if you have n't lost your identity you wo n't vote for the parties that will try to get rid of catalan in schools , for instance ... 
  reminiscence of 1 century ago . 
  this post is odd : 4 hours old , front page and a good percentage of upvotes but no comments at all while being a discussion based post . 
  i 'll start . 
  i think it is quite difficult to predict this year 's elections since there are new parties which threaten the traditional 2 big parties . 
  however , i think that people will vote overall the same shit as always because we do not fucking learn at all . 
  and of course this will be followed by 4 long years of whining , complaining and wondering how the fuck did these guys get in power . 
  edit : first estimations --  pp and psoe being the first and second force in almost all cities ( without counting catalonia and the basque country were they are not that popular ) what a shitty country , we are doomed to stay like this until the end of our days . 
  does n't matter how many corruption scandals per week pp has , they are always on top . 
  i hope everybody keeps their mouth shut and i will be so pissed if people start complaining and asking for `` change '' for the 18736th time . 
  your voice is your vote , if you want something to change do not fucking vote pp all over and over . 
  edit 2 : this is a little off-topic but do you remember during the non-official referendum in catalonia ( 9-n ) where everywhere lost their minds because some photos of children were published showing them casting the vote for their parents ? 
  you probably wo n't remember the reaction of both / r/europe and the press but some people used that to claim that the referendum was antidemocratic and a joke . 
  well , look what i found : [ poor child who probably ca n't spell his own name is forced to vote ] ( https://twitter.com/el_pais/status/602545265682288640 ) . 
  is this claim stupid ? 
  sure it is , i was just showing some double standards that the spanish press has . 
  ( i found it mildly interesting ), 
  ah okay it 's cis data , i thought they made those graphs from the different results in the different cities and regions . 
  something was wrong with t , now it makes sense . 
  thanks, 
  if votes are anonymous how do they make these kind of graphs ? 
  i 'm genuinely interested, 
  put your fucking votes in the air !, 
  we call it `` la fiesta de la democracia '' for a reason . 
  we fucking love fiesta and will take any chance to transform anything into it . 
  he really slipped in that one lol .
