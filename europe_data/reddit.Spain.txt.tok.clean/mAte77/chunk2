  i 'm sure a lot of people will help you here , though . 
  we do n't certanly know . 
  and no , it does n't have any direct effect . 
  first world ? 
  you mean the us seeing its geographic position to set some navy bases ? 
  during the cold war the only way the us could overcome the sovietic barrier to broadcast radio inthe ussr was via a huge radio antennas in a beach near barcelona . 
  it was the only point were the radio waves would bounce perfectly in the atmosfere to surpass the block . 
  the radio was called radio liberty and it played an important role . 
  the only way the us could build those was with the approval of franco and in exchange they pacted the entry of spain in the unesco . 
  spain during the dictatorship was pretty much like , from the point of view from eu and the us : do whatever you want to do as long as you do n't bother too much and do n't mess with us . 
  yeah the same way they did n't allow the 39 year old dictatorship in spain . 
  we are one of the few countries its dictator died in his bed , with all the honors . 
  i know , it 's a shame, 
   so catalonia is a part os spain because they have common history  okay europe . 
  reunite as the roman empire . 
  i think the brits know much better how democracy works, 
  while they are investigating , a shit ton of politicians , who had links with the current government , have already been put to jail . 
  could you also tell me what are these other crimes ? 
  he is only being investigated for tax evasion , and it is likely that it was his sons , and not him . 
  it is weird how you do n't say a word about actual corruption scandals , whith a lot more of money involved , but instead you support youself with these cases which we do n't even know if they are guilty or not . 
  edit : i clicked the link and saw they talked about 100 million euros . 
  wikipedia is n't a reliable source as i could write any ohter thing . 
  you guys are so stubborn with this jordi pujol thing ( you and the media ) , could n't you get me a more reliable source ? 
  at least a newspaper or something with more realistic numbers . 
  there 's no good claim or bad claim . 
  the topic in this thread is that the government has forbidden catalonia to vote and express their concerns . 
  there simply ca n't be arguments against letting people vote . 
  i did n't say otherwhise . 
  they are actually in their right to do so . 
  however , the international community would instantly back up catalonia after it happened . 
  or at least they should . 
   media control . 
  all the catalan media has been horribly manipulative . 
   catalan 's are free to watch/read/listen to whatever they want . 
  there are 2 important catalan speaking channels , between 3-5 radio stations and a good amount of newspapers . 
  however , there are at least 6 important channels in spanish . 
  a huge amount of radio stations in spanish and another huge amount of newspapers . 
   corruption . 
  the catalan political sphere is as corrupt as the valencian pp . 
  erm ... no ? 
  catalan political sphere is pretty much corruption-free atm . 
  even though some newspapers try too hard to make it seem like it is not . 
  there 's not a single corruption scandal linked to anyone that 's ruling the region . 
  we ca n't say the same for the central government and pp/psoe . 
   election control and representation . 
  if one group wins with 51 % what will happen ? 
  it 's really fishy situation , and i ca n't trust mas with a clean election . 
  51 % -  majority . 
  what would result in ? 
  4-5million people in the streets ? 
  insane rebellions ? 
  in the xxi century you can no longer shut down the people like this , at least in a `` democratic '' country . 
  democratic : look at the thread 's title . 
  language : look at what education minister wert is trying to do . 
  catalan is being killed and reduced to marginity . 
  ( luckily in catalonia we 'll resist , for ever ) . 
  the language the speakers of east aragon consider as catalan , which it is , is now officially called lapao ( as if we talk of a mogolian dialect ) , just not considering it catalan . 
  ( there 's no other explanation , trust me ) . 
  costums : the catalan parliament decided by almost unanimity to ban the `` toros '' , yet the central government is trying to reintroduce them . 
  the `` trabucaires '' were fined for 25000 $ after a pp councillor completely made up they were simulating an execution ( his ) right in front of his door . 
  the truth is that the trabucaires are a tradition in catalonia and what they do during some celebrations in some towns is a tour thorugh the city , stopping at some points and shooting the air . 
  it 's not that we are not protected , it is that we are attacked by spain , which is even worse . 
  yes , what 's wrong with them ? 
  and what 's wrong with you underestimating and despising every identity which does n't have its own country ? 
  that 's what we are trying to solve . 
   so far , your country is spain too , as you will doubtlessly find out if you try to travel abroad on a `` catalan passport '' . 
  passport/dni `` joke '' ( let 's call it that way to avoid confrontations ) : \u2713, 
  shut up adoctrionated cunt , you watch to much nazi-catalan tv / s, 
  i would gladly take a life economically speaking more demanding as long as my democratic rights , my language and my costums were porotected . 
  even though it would n't happen anyway . 
  there 's no way we would become poorer or less competitive with europe . 
  you telling me that if we made and ** official ** referendum for the independence of catalonia , the same as scotland 's , it would be allowed ? 
  lol , best joke of the thread so far . 
  hey fellow catalans , we were wrong !!, 
  they were banning our consulatations because they were crappy and with no democratic guarantees !, 
  we should have listened to them while they were proposing us a legal an official referendum !, 
  i 'm actually having hard times figuring out if you left your / s there . 
  do they have regions with ** massive ** concentrations for it ? 
  i mean , maybe m\u00e9xico could have anti-secession laws but which region would want to be independent from it ? 
  i 'm aware of some independentists movements and either they are in undemocratic countries or they are following the same path as us ( considering they are also forbidden to vote by `` democratic ways '' ), 
  a law that opresses a democracy makes it no longer a democracy . 
   are against allowing a vote on ~ ~ independence ~ ~ they are against of independence , do n't get me wrong . 
  but what they are really against is the right of people to vote according to their concerns about their future . 
  yeah , getting out of a 39 year long dictatorship may have something to do with it . 
  people in 1978 was seeking for any sort of democracy . 
  i 'll tell you what . 
  today , only people who is older than 54 could vote that constitution . 
  it is fair to safe that the ** majority ** of the population is living under an outdated constitution . 
  we could change it , and we ( or you , i hope ) will eventually do . 
  what i know for sure is that this hypotetical consitution would not still allow either official or non-official referendums of these kind . 
  which is sad . 
  edit , typo, 
   change things legally but do n't want to . 
  what the fuck ? 
  it is the central government and the politically corrupted constitutional court which are literally like a wall . 
  wan na have all your neighboorhood to be independent ? 
  if it was for me go ahead . 
  have fun being a 30 people country with no economical power ( as all your jobs are abroad ) , no military , no nothing . 
  yes , it is stupid what i 've just said , so it is what you have . 
  stop with these pointless agurments .
