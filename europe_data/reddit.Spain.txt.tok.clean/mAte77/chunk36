  i am 100 % sure there was no malice intended here since this is , as the article says , a regular chant by now and it does n't really bother the independentists . 
  it 's a legitimate claim . 
  well , the `` they wo n't fool us '' is a bit odd and funny , but there is no ill feelings . 
  demographics as they stand are making independence bound to happen . 
  if i remember correctly the numbers are around 60 % support for independence among the ages 16-25 or so . 
  immigrants are usually way less pro-independence since that is not `` their fight '' so to speak , and understandably they want as little political and economical turmoil as possible . 
  catalan independentism is quite tied with language more than anything . 
  we received a lot of immigrants from the rest of spain ( i am the result of one ! ), 
  that came in a time where you did n't need to learn catalan at all ( it was , well , forbidden ) and it was n't taught in schools , so they did n't . 
  as you climb up into the demographics ladder , you will find less and less people that can/do communicate in catalan . 
  now that catalan is a normal language such as spanish , the youth knows it to a decently high extend . 
  this is very poorly explained and i hope someone else can explain it to you better . 
  the fact is that the disparity in numbers is huge . 
  less than 30 % of sons from both spanish-speaker parents are in favour of independence , while around 70 % of sons from both catalan-speakers parents are for it . 
  the numbers water down when only 1 parent is catalan/spanish speaker and so on . 
  if this keeps `` working '' as is , independence should be inevitable in less than 20 years or so . 
  * sigh ... this shit again * the 2014 consultation was never intended to provide a binding result to follow through . 
  it was a mere act of rebellion and willingness to vote , period . 
  the last elections were indeed planned as a plebiscite , but all went to shit ( to some extent ) the moment csqep decided to be not for nor against independence . 
  among their leaders there were independentists and unionist , and that diversity replicated among their voters . 
  there was a 48 % explicit support for independence and a 39 % explicit support for the opposite . 
  there is no way to calculate nor estimate anything in a precise way , but the most important fact that everyone conveniently forgets about is that if only a 16 % of that 470,000 people that did n't choose a particular side were to vote/would have voted yes , then we 'd have gotten an explicit 50 + % of support for independence . 
  there have been multiple consultations and polls within that party which have shown , always , a higher deal of support for independence than the petty 16 % , so it is quite fair to say that in the last elections there was a majority of people that wanted independence . 
  that does n't matter at all since you need the actual numbers to empower these claims to the next step . 
  inb4 `` if they wanted independence why did n't they vote independentist parties then ??? 
  '' : well , you could either vote the far-left anti-capitalism party , or the party with the corrupt ciu in it . 
  some people ca n't stand either of them . 
  some people also still believe that a legal referendum scotland-like is possible , so they voted the party that still , naively , pointed in that direction . 
  i must be missing something since i do n't see what 's wrong with that ? 
  in parliament seats there is . 
  however , in those elections purely explicit independentist vote `` only '' managed to achieve a 48 % of the total vote . 
  there was a party that was n't for nor against independence , but defended a legal , binding referendum ; had and have pro-independence people ; and during the campaign assured the voters that you could be independentist and vote for them since your interests as one would be protected . 
  we obviously ca n't know which share of that party 's voters would like independence , so that election ca n't be used as a plebiscite . 
  the only way to do away with doubts is a referendum . 
  for the record , this demonstration was not only against independence , but also against a referendum , which should say quite a lot of things , right ? 
  translation : during the march , we 've heard classic chants such as `` they wo n't fool us : catalonia is spain '' or `` i 'm a spaniard '' , and some others in catalan such as `` let 's stop the coup !, 
  '' , the later having awakened some complaints from some of the attenders towards the organization for being , precisely , in catalan . 
  source , the very much super-indepdentist ( / s , for the foreigners ) la vanguardia : http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20170319/421011245713/manifestacion-sociedad-civil-catalana-barcelona.html, 
  oh boy , i assure you they were . 
  not organized by the government . 
  there will only be one if the catalan government have the balls to go through . 
  dude , haha . 
  tv3 are only reporting a number given by the police . 
  here , have a source more catering to the status quo http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2017/03/19/catalunya/1489922300_102790.html?id_externo_rsoc=tw_cm . 
  another source for no reason ( idle effort since any news source that is willing to report a number besides the organizer 's will give you that figure . 
  it 's not like i am making this up ) : http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/cataluna/2017-03-19/miles-de-personas-se-manifiestan-en-barcelona-contra-el_1351212/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=ecfdmanual damn municipal police !, 
  look at this : https://twitter.com/cataloniawatch/status/843452335493910528 even newspapers like el mundo were reporting around the 5000 mark . 
  quite a pointless discussion , though . 
  let 's pretend 15000 people went there . 
  hell , i 'll even give you 30.000 people for no reason . 
  that 's still a very small number . 
  more people went to give support to the alledged `` coup perpetrators '' , haha . 
  i only answered a question . 
  i did n't put any labels anywhere . 
  not that those old hags were the only shameful stain in the demonstration , the ex-lider of the far-right party fuerza nueva was leading the march , lol . 
  15000 according to organizers , here : http://www.elmundo.es/cataluna/2017/03/19/58ce6b5646163f382a8b466e.html 6500 according to the police , here : http://www.ccma.cat/324/manifestacio-a-barcelona-contra-el-cop-separatista/noticia/2778916/, 
  as far as i know there has been at least one flag from a couple of good ole `` con franco se viv\u00eda mejor '' elders with the good ole `` legionarios a luchar , legionarios a morir '' banner ( or whatever the hell the banner is ) . 
  they were demanding the intervention of the army ; true democrats . 
  would it ? 
  what brings the recognition of the plurinationality within spain ? 
  unless i 'm missing something , it 'd be a mere nominal change , with no real practical consequences . 
  in the constitution we 'd have `` spain is a state/country formed by the diferent nationalities within our borders '' ( or whatever ) , and that 'd be it . 
  that change would n't allow a referendum since it 'd still be an attempt to break spain 's sovereignty from a constitutional standpoint . 
  unless you modify whatever clause that forbids a referendum , we wo n't be able to do one . 
  changing the concept of `` nation '' in the constitutional framework does n't bring anything onto the table . 
  not arguing that it is n't a nice needed change , do n't get me wrong . 
  self-determination does n't necessarily mean independence . 
  self-determination is , as the word suggest , the right to autonomously determine your future . 
  in 2014 scotland did decide to remain in the uk in an act of self-determination . 
  it was 2.3 m , actually , which amounts to 38 % of the census . 
  if `` barely at all '' means that to you , that 's a different problem . 
  and good christ the logic in `` abstention = no '' . 
   they , independentist catalonians have done a good work with international propaganda and everyone wants to look modern and very multicultural until shit knocks on their door . 
  what does that even mean hahahah . 
  and by the way , they want a referendum , do n't they ? 
  since its result also affects me despite not being catalonian , let 's hold it in all the country . 
  those politicians do n't want that , they 'd lose it and lose their opportunity to steal every single cent from catalonian treasure while roaring about the glory of fatherland catalonia . 
  good lord what a steaming pile of bollocks . 
  in what country independence referendums are held state-wide ? 
  lose the opportunity to steal from catalan treasure ? 
  if the corruption we have in catalonia is big enough to warrant this comment , you must firmly believe that politicians in other regions literally steal from the households at gunpoint . 
  spanish press has done so much damage . 
  catalonia has one of the lowest rates of corrupt politicans per capita , as well as money stolen per capita . 
  the fact that you guys believe catalonia is some kind of administration within sicily in its shadiest days goes to show the quality of the media . 
  i wo n't bother looking up the articles from the ny times ( or the finantial times , do n't remember which one it was ) calling out how biased spanish media is . 
  here you have some maps that show in one way or another corruption in spain , which funnily enough are from the kind of media that magnifies every catalan corruption scandal out there . 
  thank god facts are facts . 
  http://www.solosequenosenada.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/corrupcion-en-espana-noviembre-2014.jpg http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ecd3v7zgcqs/ub87wfi8ori/aaaaaaaaw3i/zgpxgargtym/s1600/mapa+corrupcion+elpais+jun13.png https://socialescepcor.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/mapa-de-la-corrupcion-en-espac3b1a.jpg?w=884&amp;h=391 and i can link as many as you want ; or you can look it up yourself `` mapa corruption espa\u00f1a '' . 
  reminder , you must account for population . 
  we may have the same amount of corruption scandals as , say , the balearics , yet we have 7x the population . 
   i know from the outside of spain this is seen a lot like : `` spain - yeah that country that had inquisition and murdered native americans 500 years ago - still opresses the people of catalonia - and i can say many things of this situation of catalans and catalonia because i went to barcelona for a week last summer and i like bar\u00e7a fc '' more like : `` spanish and the uk look like advanced democracies that respect the people within their borders . 
  i do n't know much , nor i care , about the legal and historic background , but if the uk allowed a referendum why ca n't spain ? '', 
  then you 'd go : `` but the uk does n't have a constitution that forbids it ( which is false ) and spain does . '', 
  and then they 'd say : `` and why do n't they change it so they can have one '' and then you 'd say : `` because we do n't want it '' . 
  and they 'd go : `` ah , so it 's only lack of political will . 
  it 's not like a divine force prevents from changing anything ; you simply do n't allow it . 
  all in all , the difference between the uk and spain is lack of political will and respect towards one region . 
  the rest ( constitutional background ) is a convenient excuse on which to lie their political reasons . 
  and snp got 46 % of the vote in the last elections , what 's your point ? 
  we ca n't hold a referendum unless we have evidence that more than 50 % would vote yes ?
