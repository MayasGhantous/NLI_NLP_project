  and yeah , independentism has raised so much thanks to , among other things , all these 19th century declarations by some spanish politicians and journalists . 
  i am 100 % sure indepententism would n't be that huge if they just allowed to vote and respectd us . 
  if people had equal oppurtunities regardless of where they were born they would n't come to the developed countries . 
  you only need to travel abroad in a poor country to see how fucked up the children are since the very first moment they are born . 
  while we fight and work to have the walthiest of the life-styles , they have to focus all their time and capabilities just to survive and help their families . 
  i really wonder how could someone pretend to be spanish . 
  like , most of the spaniards i know pretend to be something else lol, 
  care to explain what the second symbol you linked refers to ? 
  i googled it but got little information . 
  here in catalonia we are called nazis by the government in a weekly basis for trying to vote . 
  i love swastikas . 
  i like the shape and how they fit in a wide variety of colour combinations . 
  it just looks good . 
  then i think about what it used to mean 70 years ago and feel so bad with myself . 
  i am 100 % anti-nazi and anti-fascist but i 'm somehow so fascinated by this symbol and in general all the nazi symbology . 
  spelled `` euro '' , pronounced `` euru '' . 
  and the cents are `` c\u00e8ntims '', 
  i have a couple of his books . 
  they are both hilarious and interesting . 
  / r/europeancirclejerk edit : [ le ], 
  indeed , same day but with slight differences respecting the forbidden referendum . 
  and do n't ask , i do n't know them . 
  it is the same question and the same day but there 's something different . 
  lyrics for the interested : ** catalan ** catalunya , triomfant , tornar\u00e0 a ser rica i plena !, 
  bon cop de fal\u00e7 , defensors de la terra !, 
  buen golpe de hoz , \u00a1 defensores de la tierra !, 
  -------- ( estribillo ) ----------- que tiemble el enemigo al ver nuestra ense\u00f1a : como hacemos caer espigas de oro , cuando conviene segamos cadenas ----- ( estribillo ) ----- ** english ** catalonia triumphant shall again be rich and bountiful . 
  drive away these people , who are so conceited and so contemptful . 
  refrain : strike with your sickle !, 
  strike with your sickle , defenders of the land !, 
  strike with your sickle !, 
  now is the time , reapers . 
  now is the time to stand alert . 
  for when another june comes , let us sharpen our tools well . 
  refrain may the enemy tremble , upon seeing our symbol . 
  just as we cut golden ears of wheat , when the time calls we cut off chains . 
  refrain my formatting sucks so much i hope it is clear . 
  oh damn i 'm so dumb , and thank you , til . 
  yes , they are . 
  but this nationalism is n't an exlusive one . 
  during the 9/11 i saw people from all over the world : black people , muslims , asians , nordics , south americans , etc. . . you do not have to meet any requirements to take part in this movement , it is just the pursuit of a new , better country for our children and grandchildren sake . 
  could i get the original link from / r/frisson ? 
  and yeah during the catalan history the poor farmers have always have to harbor french or spanish troops in their homes and they had to feed them so they ended up quite fed up haha . 
  imagine how it would be if , for example , you were from one country and you had to feed troops from another country who do n't represent nor defend you and feeding them with the resources you have to barely feed your own family . 
  even though it is an independentist movement we do n't want to isolate from the international context . 
  we want to be heard by both the european community and the totallity of the world . 
  we are ready and capable to belong to the european union . 
  and well catalonia was one of the strongest pro-anarquist territories back in 1900 , if not the most so there you have the esperanto flag , 
  i 'm not sure that 's an offcial website . 
  check this : http://www.sagradafamilia.cat/sf-eng/docs_serveis/infotarifesind.php?lang=0, 
  where was this photo taken ? 
  it is beautiful . 
  this would be 100 % true if we were talking 100 years ago . 
  you nailed it , but it is really hard for me to imagine this thing happening in the xxith century . 
  what about making it like the other independentists refrendums ? 
  you are telling me that if there was a 74 % yes vote ( which is immense ) it would n't be enough ? 
  every 4 people , 3 have to fuck themselves so the one remaining is happy ? 
  come on . 
  no , having catalonia means you are just catalan , it does n't have independentist connotations . 
  there are more regional flairs for spain such as the andaluse or galicia . 
  there is an oriented pro-independence flair in here which is the [ estelada ] ( http://esteladadelpoble.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/estelada1.jpg ) . 
  at first i had that but switched because somehow i was getting slaughtered in every comment i made , misteriosuly it all changed when i no longer had it . 
  the catalan flair is like the scottish , during the refrendum i saw plenty of scottish flairs but that did n't mean they were pro-independence or not . 
  i know , this is why  i 'm getting to the point where i do n't give a shit about anything . 
  you ca n't imagine how tired i am about all of this ... :(, 
  time will tell . 
  catalonia is bigger in terms of population , territory and economy than a lot of states in eu which are doing above the average of the european countries . 
  yes yes . 
  well of course not . 
  if the question was `` would you like catalonia to stay in spain ? '', 
  then i would say no . 
  should it be more complicated ? 
  i hope so . 
  ** edit : ** i only hope the central government send the troops to barcelona and occupy the city . 
  this would have immense repercusion worldwide and we ( the catalans ) would have the intrnational support by our side . 
  we are in 2014 guys , this shit of filling cities with tanks and so ended many years ago . 
  and hell no , i do n't want another franco dictatorship , but i 'm calmed because i know it is impossible that we get that shit again . 
  yes . 
  i 'm getting to the point where i do n't give a shit about anything . 
  i just want to vote . 
  yup , only reason i root for spain is because of the catalans who play there . 
  i would n't hate spain national team anyway , it 's just another team . 
  i am so sad right now ... 
  i agree there will no be a referendum , probably . 
  but i wan na play , make it 11 cookiez, 
  guys , / u/aeduh says independence is impossible . 
  no more 1,5 million concentrations , they are useless . 
  take your spanish flags in your balconies and sing along the spanish anthem and let 's finally erase every word in catalan from the educational system . 
  you are dead wrong if you thing this subject will be decided by the will of a few banks ... 
  so , so wrong . 
  idc how many people of the elite you know . 
  i do n't even know why you had to mention it . 
  does that give you a special status ? 
  are you now better ? 
  you are telling me the central government wo n't give us independence tomorrow ? 
  what a surprise !, 
  this is what we are fighhting for . 
  we have finally taken your `` neutral '' `` impartial '' mask !!, 
  in the end , you are just one more salty spaniard . 
  democracy ?
