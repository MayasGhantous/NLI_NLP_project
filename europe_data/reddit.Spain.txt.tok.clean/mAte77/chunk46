  it does n't work like that . 
  you ca n't just insult everyone in this thread and then ask for class , it 's not smart . 
  ask for class , and then insult everyone , for future reference . 
  ah , so the `` malice '' line is drawn by the number of people murdered , got it . 
  come on , most of the people in that arena were children for fuck 's sake . 
  a catalan comments about catalonia in / r/europe , shocker . 
  have you seen yours ? 
  after a while in this subreddit you get to know some people from within certain circles , and you are waaaaaay more obsessed with catalonia than i am , even if your obsession is driven with rather dark motivation . 
  look at your history , out of your last 10 ~ comments , 70-80 % are about catalonia , mind you . 
  and when you are n't commenting in threads about catalonia , negatively ( that 's out of the question ) , you comment in threads about spain , as is expectable from a spaniard . 
  are you pushing some kind of agenda then ? 
  or it 's only the catalans that push agendas . 
  well , perception is a subjective thing . 
  i can recreate this `` joke '' with 9/11 and is still tasteless . 
  `` he genuinely asks if the wtc was that famous building that had a very famous italian restaurant in it , and the other guy tells him that not everything is about food , and he responds with haha yes it is ! '' . 
  as the buildings collapse . 
  in fact , op managed to force that journalist into being a demented piece of shit so he could then shitpost about spain on reddit . 
  pure evil , someone stop him . 
  what in the living fuck are you even talking about ? 
  would you say anything if the op was from elsewhere ? 
   i am spanish and i do n't know who this guy is and i am even not sure wheter i have 13 tv on my tv . 
  13 tv receives public funds and is funded by the church . 
  the journalists in the video are well-known . 
  spain media discredits itself with this shit . 
  such a shame that , out of all the things you should be criticizing ( about the things shown in this thread ) , you go for that obsession of yours with catalonia . 
  this has nothing to do with catalonia , get over yourself . 
  as malicious as making jokes as the second plane crashes into the the other world trade center tower, 
  my thoughts are with the british people , but let 's not be reactionary . 
  haha of course they were n't banned for being catalan . 
  however , the catalan people has only been able to somewhat defend their interests in the spanish courts during the 2nd republic and after franco 's dictatorship . 
  that 's what i meant , margall was a federationist who cared for catalonia but not nearly as much as for spain , the other two did n't give a shit for catalonia , especially prim , they just happened to be catalans . 
  neither of these were catalan nationalists . 
  and ? 
  that 's like saying the galicia is very well represented because rajoy is from there . 
  prim was catalan and pi-margall and estanislau figueras were the first two presidents of the 1st republic ( til ) who stayed in office a combined total of 5 months ( the 1st republic was such a shitshow ) . 
  ah okay , i do get it now . 
  i also studied some sociology haha :p .  the fact that catalonia independence has almost no support in the peninsula and the eu should be more concerning to you that if you are right or not , because being right about whatever the stuff drives you nowhere , while having support does . 
  i mean , considering how things work , you 're totally right , but how do we achieve this ? 
  all news outlets are terribly biased against anything close to pro-referendum ( let alone pro-indy ) , which creates the illusion of unbias , since they all report the same . 
  if you understand catalan , this video does a good job at explaining it . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9vdqn1pemk&amp;feature=youtu.bethis tweet chain also calls out a phenomenon that nowadays happens now and again . 
  https://twitter.com/joanmariapique/status/866600711597023233  again : it does n't matter if you think , or said that andalusians are lazy or not . 
  what does matter is if andalusians ( or any spaniard ) believe you did so . 
  if they do , is because your politicians , either said so ( as did duran i lleida said with per , very stupid move ) or handed the possibility to your opposition to frame the conversation ( difficult to avoid , albeit possible to control as podemos does ) . 
  i agree , but , is n't that very , very sad ? 
  during psoe race between sanchez and diaz , zapatero said we catalans did n't fancy susana because she was andalusian ** and ** a woman . 
  i mean , what the actual fuck ? 
  we even elected an andalusian to be our president 10 years ago ? 
  you ca n't imagine how frustrating it is when we ask nicely for a referendum 17 times and they 're all turned down with only just a `` no '' , and when rufian gets cocky and we threat with carrying on unilaterally , then we are the bad guys and the no-nice guys that `` refuse to negotiate and talk '' . 
  or how now and again , in spanish tv shows whenever they talk about corruption they manage to sneak in the `` fact '' that catalonia is one of the most corrupt regions in spain , if not the most , whereas that 's absolutely false by any metric . 
  who cares about that , though ? 
  i do n't know if you use twitter , but in almost every tweet regarding corruption ( mainly from news outlets ) , you get a chain of numerous tweets from spaniards saying `` y catalu\u00f1a qu\u00e9 ? '', 
  `` sisi , pero 3 % y puyol robaron m\u00e1s '' and the like . 
  the lack of sympathy is because spanish politicians bar podemos ca n't even imagine a spain without catalonia . 
  you 're saying that we wasted our chance at catering to psoe to get a referendum and that 's not true at all . 
  had we given them all the blowjobs in the world , had we said they were the coolest party with the best ideas and principles , it would n't have changed a thing . 
  sanchez , the guy that got defenestrated for saying no to rajoy , was n't even pro-referendum as `` some things are outside the realm of politics '' . 
  the fact that we do n't have support in spain besides podemos and iu has nothing to do with however harsh and anomistitaly we 've come across . 
  in the last 5 years we 've tried to negotiate a referendum 17 times , and the negotiations have never gone farther than `` just no '' . 
  you 're talking as though there was an initial air of `` openess '' and `` will to negotiate and discuss '' which was turned down by the extremist , angry catalans . 
   if it 's not pretty clear for you , at this point , that facts do not matter a lot in politics , i think you are the one deluding yourself here . 
  also , did you just admit to not caring about facts ? 
  when i said that it 's sad that you still believe those things , i was referring to the lazy andalusians bit . 
   it 's not like giving speeches about lazy andalusians and fascist spaniards gives you lots of friendly points . 
  if a regional leader of psoe wanted to support you , he would have no ammo to sell his idea , basically because catalonian parties made a good job of making sure that no one had political capital to support their cause . 
  it is so sad that on this day and age you still believe these things . 
  as sad as thinking that psoe would ever concede a referendum of this sort . 
  do you guys really think that we catalans had our chance to do it right but we just bottled it ? 
   you made some good points though . 
  it does n't seem to matter , flair-based downvoting is the norm in these threads . 
  had my comment been posted under any other flair , it 'd would n't be at its current -4 . 
  improve your reading comprehension . 
  i said algeria was n't a colony ** either ** . 
  til i 'm not real . 
  there more you know, 
  algeria was n't a colony either . 
   catalonian was n't even banned , just excluded from burocratic procedings following standard borbonic policy on language and state centralization ( which sucks do n't get me wrong ) and is n't that a ban ? 
  why do you think irish is this state today ? 
  when you make a language redundant and useless , it disappears . 
  it 's very simple , you do n't need to shoot on sight whomever speaks it publicly ; just ban it from anything important : bureaucracy , education , work environment . 
  the language stops developing in those fields , and is only useful in mundane situations . 
  after a couple generations , the kids are spoken to in the imposed language to spare their efforts of having to learn another language if they want to do something more glamorous than doing house-work all their life . 
  the situation in catalonia was not that different from the irish , it 's just that it is much more shocking that it happened in the early 1900 's , whereas that catalan oppression happened in the 1700 's , when it was rather normal . 
  both countries had leaders executed , wars fought and very , very civilian casualties . 
  notice i have n't weighed in the famine at any moment , for that happened half a century before the irish rebellion . 
  i was trying to compare the rebellious stages . 
  and to be fair , catalonia only got meaningful representation in the spanish parliament in 1977 . 
  it 's not like since the xvth century we 've had our share of representative in the spanish courts . 
   education system where catalan is the main vehicular language and it 's protected and encouraged over spanish . 
  good god . 
  how exactly is encouraged and protected since the spanish government averages 1 attempt to abolish catalan as the main language in education per term ? 
  catalan is only protected by the catalan government . 
  in the department of justice , which as far as i know is a competence for the spanish government , not too long ago a lawyer was n't able to present her case in catalan because the judge `` did n't understand it '' , despite the judge having lived in catalonia for some time . 
  they argued for like 10 minutes , the judge in spanish and the lawyer in catalan , which proved that the judge understood catalan just fine , and just did n't want her to do it in catalan . 
  there 's that time not too long ago when a catalan was fined with 600 $ for addressing a guardia civil in catalan in barcelona 's airport . 
  i wo n't even plunge into your `` its own parliament , laws and education system '' . 
  i just want to say that we average one impugned catalan law per month , which means that our parliament is n't nearly as sovereign as a parliament should be . 
  this bit seems so hard to understand for some reason . 
  under franco , leftists and franco 's dissidents had to struggle and perish all over spain . 
  what 's the difference , then , in the oppression a catalan or a castillan received ?
