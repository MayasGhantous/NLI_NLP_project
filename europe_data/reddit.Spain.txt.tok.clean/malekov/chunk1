typical eastern european comment !, 
  i really liked seeing low happy . 
  such a gentleman . 
  buy this http://m.ebay.com/itm?itemid=271394516960, 
  everybody spies on everybody . 
  how many seats in the ep would iceland have ? 
  can we get a historical ( added ) data of this ? 
  is this legal or lawful ? 
   why does it have to be plotted on a political level it is nuts 3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nomenclature_of_territorial_units_for_statistics which is an standard for this kind of things again , the description of what 's rural and what 's mixed is on the footer , and they aggregate the data on nuts-3 borders , and putting a color/type according to the end %, 
  that 's two more for spain that i thought, 
  there 's been slaves born in most of europe in the past , yes, 
  thanks, 
  as someone who happen to know almost nothing about irish history ( except the biggest things ) . 
  are the statements in this article/book real ? 
  like the king of spain . 
  except with less elephant killing, 
  yes . 
  also , the barcelona-madrid should have been first instead of the sevilla-madrid :-(, 
  [ advanced risc machines ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arm_holdings ), 
  you meant barcelona 92 ? 
  ahhhh , it 's not like we 're sudan ... 
   i was instilled with such nationalistic pride that i was just about ready to hop on a boat and invade france . 
  * headline : `` redditor with a union jack invades france '' * subheadline : `` finds no resistance . 
  but stays for the food . '', 
  in madrid people was all in for 2012 games , that bid was lost . 
  in 2016 people was sort of in , that bid was also lost . 
  now they 're ( we are ) mostly ` meeeeh ' . 
  yeah . 
  that 's the big question right now here . 
  the politicians answers is that most is already done and paid . 
  i 'm not so sure, 
  side question : did londoners find their olympics good for the city and/or uk ? 
  greece is a 1st world country and indonesia is ( and was then much more ) a developing country . 
  in a developing country a 30 % increase per capita may be 1000 $ , in greece 1000 $ per capita would be about 5 % or so, 
  italian for me . 
  but catalan has some words that sound so nice, 
  there was a story here yesterday http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1hmu2r/eu_to_vote_to_suspend_us_data_sharing_agreements/ about this . 
  now parliament voted on it, 
  he wo n't be able to hold any public charges ever ? 
  can we get your old clothes ? 
   they are n't even in the same time zone ( which is a little bit crazy ... come on guys ! ), 
  we 're the ones off , we should be in the uk/pt time zone , not in the same time zone as poland, 
  didnt portugal spin off from kingdom of leon ? 
  i 'm truly sorry if i was wrong, 
  it cost something , not free like in $ scandinavian_country but not super duper costly as in usa, 
   rosenberg was an early and powerful nazi ideologue , particularly on racial issues . 
  he directed the nazi party 's foreign affairs department and edited the nazi newspaper . 
  several of his memos to hitler were cited as evidence during the post-war nuremberg trials . 
   rosenberg also directed the systematic nazi looting of jewish art , cultural and religious property throughout europe . 
  the nazi unit created to seize such artifacts was called task force reichsleiter rosenberg . 
   he was convicted of crimes against humanity and was one of a dozen senior nazi officials executed in october 1946 . 
  his diary , once held by nuremberg prosecutors as evidence , vanished after the trial . 
  anything that gives a bit more of light on that era is always welcome, 
  a curious data point its that france went from 83 % to 77 % in the last five years . 
  hum !, 
  makes a lot of sense . 
  yes . 
  spain may have a lot more % of catholic , but those who define as catholic barely go to church . 
  there are more catholics in spain and the laws passed pretty nicely and without that many demonstrations on the streets, 
  as long as we can keep up inventing new cool words we should be fine, 
  the same thing they say about obama in the us , sort of , right ?

  does apple even pay vat in the eu countries they have retail operations ? 
  tale of two redditors, 
  we have like 300.000 british and like 50 redditors living amongst us !, 
  i fear a rebellion, 
  also people who does n't want a job , and/or doesnt need a job , and/or are not looking for job , because they 're studying of because they do chores at home , or because they simply do n't want/need to work, 
  27 % unemployment ! = 27 % of the population out of work, 
  the trick is we all export and somehow the aliens will import, 
  the romans went digging for gold and left this behind http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/las_m%c3%a9dulas.jpg + http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_t4re3u8-0mi/s6rad9aqqei/aaaaaaaaczq/ip1zexznjoe/s1600/las+medulas+bierzo+natura.bmp ( biggest roman gold mine according to wiki http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/las_m%c3%a9dulas ) also , a templar castle http://www.casaruralbierzo.com/espinoso/fotos/cas_p.gif used by the templar 's grand master of castille , templars were not a common thing this far south-west of europe , but still pretty cool, 
  that was what i was thinking , yes . 
  ps edited above comment . 
  i am ready to go to a jihad defending qwerty against any azerty-loving infidels . 
  i 've always heard of germany as `` the engine '' . 
  but yes , previous reforms by the spd are what put germany on the right track after the reunification . 
  right ? 
  yes . 
  i totally agree with you . 
  but i ~ ~ can ~ ~ ca n't blame the germans that are not able or refuse to link those premises : `` germany is doing pretty well thank you very much '' is simpler to think that `` because of merkel actions some people where i use to go to vacation are unemployed , and our the best solution is for us to get a little inflation and higher wages so an equilibrium point is reached in the eurozone so we wo n't have to keep bailing countries one after another '', 
  she is doing a pretty god job at governing germany to be fair , at least it seems so from the outside . 
  we can only dream of a spain with 5 % unemployment . 
  you devious monster , go get a shovel !, 
  and a firehose, 
  drunken compatriots are not to be sorry . 
  i mean , if you did n't do it , why apologize ? 
  or did you ? 
  they do constantly on salou without any street named that, 
  obviously . 
  it wo n't ever be suddenly . 
  this is a surplus which is being invested . 
  not the day to day pensions . 
  also , it 's one of the last things to cut . 
  the ss fund still has been untouched , despite having surplus for years when the country is running on deficit .
