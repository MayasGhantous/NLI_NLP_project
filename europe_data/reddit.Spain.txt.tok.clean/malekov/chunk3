  if the conservatives are in power , independentism surges . 
  if the socialists are , it boils down . 
  this will become a nice thread . 
  first off . 
  disclaimer . 
  * i 'm from madrid * i think catalonia is a nation * i think castille is a nation * i think spain is a nation ( or nation of nations , like germany , russia , & so on ) * i think spain is not the same as castille ( castille is like ... what ? 
  25-30 % of total spanish population ? ), 
  * i think spain as a nation does in fact , englobe `` inner nations '' ** so ... **  because we 're do n't consider ourselves spaniards . 
  well . 
  that 's not right . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_independentism#polls  we better build a hight speed train to nowhere that nobody uses what train ? 
  to madrid which is already used more than plane ( and is the most heavily used business route in spain , if not europe ) . 
  or the mediterranean which is said by the eu as a project of ` most relevance ' . 
  but anyway . 
   i do n't want to be part of a country that treats me like shit . 
  yeah . 
   i personally will never say i 'm spanish , while it 's equivalent to say that i 'm castillian castille is castille . 
  spain is spain . 
  merging the two as one was a victory of franco . 
  you repeating that ` mantra ' is the proof . 
  [ ve should invade ze finland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ), 
  the best thing is i think @brunt2 thought @urkki 's flag flair was sweden 's instead of finland 's, 
  i was n't implying that spd should make a coalition with linke !, 
  i think we agree on most of the topics . 
   and the people will ask `` why ? '', 
  because eurozone is germany 's biggest client and if we cut , cut & cut but ca n't issue new debt at reasonable interest to invest in growth ... we ca n't buy german things . 
  and i 'm not talking about german cars alone . 
  i 'm talking about high speed german trains , german chemicals , german pharmaceuticals , and so on and so forth, 
  sorry , i 'm not an expert in german politics . 
  i commented only what i researched . 
  * gr\u00fcne supports eurobonds http://www.greens-efa.eu/de/eurobonds-and-budget-surveillance-4868.html * linke supports eurobonds http://www.die-linke.de/nc/dielinke/nachrichten/detail/zurueck/selected-news-and-documents/artikel/euro-bonds-will-come-1/?phpsessid=a3d05c006f1b4210cc87fd921bdbbd42 * spd supports eurobonds http://www.spd.de/aktuelles/eurobonds those are facts . 
  although it does n't mean i do n't agree with you that a cdu-spd coalition would be best . 
  and that general german pop does n't currently like the idea . 
  maybe if merkel gets : * fiscal union with so called piigs agreeing to 0 % deficit by '16 * high penalties if not maybe she could then , tell the german people : `` now it 's our turn to move '' . 
  anyway , thanks for the insight . 
  well , there are other ways . 
  ecb funneling money through fed or imf , for instance . 
  2013 , spd is in favor of eurobonds , as well as gr\u00fcne and linke . 
  the only against them are fdp and cdu ( and i think not all of the cdu , please someone correct me if im wrong ), 
  i did that already . 
  so , if uk & usa ( both aaa ) have worst debt/gdp & deficit/gdp than current eurozone , eurobonds should get aaa , right ? 
  we should make a `` scumbag telegraph '' meme or something, 
  what the fuck ? 
  thanks for the correction . 
  i had it right and i must have changed it by mistake . 
  i kinda hate it too ), 
  better title : `` in two weeks all of the piigs governments have fallen in a period of under 6 months . '', 
  thanks for your note . 
  i did know that president was a bit `` lower '' than pm , but not that it was `` ceremonial '' . 
  i edited the original note . 
  spain 's top newspaper center-left elpais opens tomorrow ( 10-nov ) with 5 column frontpage http://p.twimg.com/ad2songcqaaoqgg.jpg#twimg ** headline : ** merkel & sarkozy redesign the eurozone ** sub : ** franco-german axis aims to create a strong core with euro countries * they are contemplating the exit from the euro of some of its current partners * `` it will be the end of the europe we know '', 
  woah . 
  citation needed !, 
  well , it 's not the same ... but spain ( & portugal ) joined in 1986 just 11 years after decades of dictatorship . 
  and joining the eu it 's the most important thing ever happening to modern-day spain . 
  spain democracy was/is weak . 
  without the eu we could have been stagnated in pseudo-democracy or similar status for years . 
  i think it will be helpful for all the balkans and serbia . 
  basically , what seefor ( dk ) says . 
  i think is understandable , at least until rest of the eurozone figure things out with new policies and such . 
  that could take at least 5 years but i 'll say 10 with conservative figures, 
  there 's some loopholes ... 
  it wo n't apply if in a recession or a natural disaster . 
  they ` key ' is 0.4 % deficit tops ( 0,26 % by central govt , 0.14 % by autonomous communities ( the not-so-federal-as-in-germany-but-more-than-in-france-regions ) , 0 % local govts ) . 
  this number wont be written directly in the constitution , but in a law , so it could be modified easily ... 
  i 'm not sure how it will work out . 
  and it wo n't be ` up ' until 2018 ... 2nd ps . 
  it 's not a debt ceiling , it 's a deficit one !, 
  nice reply , thanks for the insight, 
  good link , thanks, 
  haha , it 's not that i think that , i was making assumptions and asking people from the uk to know more about it , thanks for the answer !, 
  i 'll reply myself , maybe i 'm a bit simplistic but in the case of scotland the votes in 2010 were for libdems , labour & snp , all of three are `` pro-eu '' , right ? 
  the conservatives & ukip get their seats/votes mainly ( if not all of them ) from england . 
  that 's what i read in this map of 2010 elections anyway . 
  thanks for the insight, 
  it 's the uk or is it england ? 
  what i 'd like to know is the level of eurosceptiscim in scotland , wales , england and north ireland . 
  any links ? 
  what i understood from the article was `` fiscal policy integration asap '', 
  kurzarbeit really works/worked well for germany . 
  if only more countries adopted such policies, 
  yes . 
  sorry , i was on a hurry  http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/bruselas/respalda/decision/francia/cerrar/temporalmente/frontera/ferroviaria/italia/elpepuint/20110418elpepuint_7/tes ( translation to english : http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.elpais.com%2farticulo%2finternacional%2fbruselas%2frespalda%2fdecision%2ffrancia%2fcerrar%2ftemporalmente%2ffrontera%2fferroviaria%2fitalia%2felpepuint%2f20110418elpepuint_7%2ftes ) & & http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/romania-italy.9ls, 
  romania accepted 200 of tunisians a few hours ago and france said ( with eu commission support ) that yesterday 's block was because of `` tiny riots '' and was about three hours long . 
  since then , the train-traffic is open, 
  of course . 
   the problem with the euro is that there are a lot of countries , like portugal , spain , greece and others that want to see a devalued euro no . 
  germany would want the euro weakened to export more outside the eurozone . 
  spain , greece , portugal would like the euro strong to import things cheaper ( like oil , for instance ) . 
  you could visit some south european cities like rome , barcelona , madrid , sicily , athens , lisbon , nice , lyon , ibiza and such as the winter is less winter there . 
  forget cities north of denmark if you do n't like tons of snow and ice, 
  tha main thing : if greece falls apart , portugal , ireland and spain ( not sure about italy ) are much in debt and will face more difficulties than now, 
  far right-wing franco-lover extremists are blaming him for things he did n't do . 
  love it . 
  a spaniard . 
  not me . 
  not sir . 
  i wont forget the photo of the azores with bush , blair and aznar agreeing the iraq war . 
  hi , i asked the question in the comments of another thread ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/irz7k/euroscepticism_by_country/c267h4w ) but since i do n't want to get off topic there . 
  i just create a new thread if allowed .
