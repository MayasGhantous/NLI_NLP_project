and the `` black credit cards '' investigation . 
  also , you get exactly zero subsidies , low-interest loans , etc for moving out . 
  many of our northern comrades move out because of those economic incentives . 
  that 's not the case of spain ( and possibly portugal , etc ) where , when you move out , you are totally on your own . 
  you say 400k as if that was pocket change in spain . 
  the mean income of those with a job in madrid [ was 26k ] ( http://www.ine.es/dyngs/inebase/es/operacion.htm?c=estadistica_c&amp;cid=1254736061721&amp;menu=resultados&amp;idp=1254735976596 ) before taxes . 
  in spain , one of the factors of the housing bubble was tax incentives . 
  if you had a mortgage , you could reduce your personal income tax by up to 1500 eur per person , per year . 
  only from 2013 onwards did the government finally remove this incentive , after many , many years . 
  edit : clarification . 
  the spanish ministry of defence researched the `` willingness to defend the country '' and only 16 % of the poll responders were willing to do so . 
  [ news article in spanish ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2014/09/03/5406166822601ded528b45aa.html ) . 
  yep . 
  coal extraction is heavily subsidised in the north of spain ( asturias , essentially ) and has been so since the 80s iirc . 
  it 's tough , because entire villages depend on the single industry . 
  however , given the current situation , with 23 % unemployment , i fail to see why the government should subsidise this particular industry before other zillions of unemployed workers . 
  the region in a mini-war state but i do n't think they are going anywhere . 
  nobody uses `` tv '' in spain . 
  we use * tele * ( like brit * telly * ) or * televisi\u00f3n * . 
  if i were to point a single cause of the spanish shitstorm , it would be the failure of the banco de espa\u00f1a ( national bank ) and the various governments as macro regulators . 
  they sit happily for years , watching the credit-fueled growth figures . 
  those were the dunces . 
  my two cents : i went to germany a couple of months ago and i choose sixt . 
  all the rates were more or less the same as the bigger fishes , but the `` small print '' was clearer with them . 
  as a spaniard , the idea of voluntary firefighters shocks me . 
  i 'm picturing a lot of well-intended people on fire . 
  are volunteers thoroughly trained or what ? 
  or unemployment rates . 
  the bond yield spreads are up again because there are many unknowns around the 100bn bailout . 
  specifically , the 100bn credit has a clause that forces the country to give priority to the credit before other financial instruments ( national bonds included ) when it 's pay time . 
  so , this is bad news for `` the other '' guys . 
  i do n't know what are you talking about ... [ rajoy saying ( in spanish ) he does n't speak english ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwdwtrpskl0 ) [ zapatero ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbukzlyqj8g ) [ aznar ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkzkzfpz9i0 ), 
  ok , no worries !, 
  til what `` lisp '' is !, 
  if i understand you correctly , `` sistema '' ( system ) is pronounced more like english `` thythtem '' in some places ( i 'm thinking mainly about andalusia here ) and more like `` system '' in others ( mainly central and northern spain ) . 
  short answer : the `` correct '' way is `` system '' . 
  that 's how somebody from the national tv or radio would pronounce it . 
  however , there 's no actual `` right '' or `` wrong '' in regional pronunciations . 
  there 's no absolute and final measuring rule to compare against . 
  about how speakers with different pronunciations sound to each other : it mostly tells where are you from , regionally , there is no major pejorative implications . 
  if i hear someone pronouncing `` th '' i would think `` he 's form the south '' but not `` he 's stupid '' or `` he 's from a remote village '' . 
  edit : may you be referring to what `` foolano '' insted ? 
  no , of course not , but you linked the comment section in your original post . 
  just to be clear , you linked : http://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook/2012/06/spains-banks?sort=3#sort-comments ( and this points to the comments ) . 
  while the `` correct '' link is : http://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook/2012/06/spains-banks, 
  no , no problem , i 'm basically saying the same thing as you . 
  it 's only that your url links to a comment in the `` comment '' section , instead of the article itself , and there 's some dude moaning about how crap spain is ( part true , part exaggeration ) . 
  i 'm partly positive about the bailouts : apart from the broken banking system , spain has no urgent and immediate major problems . 
  the government is slowly cutting the deficit . 
  however , as government spending has shrunk a lot , that also means that the economy is recession again , so the problem is more long-term . 
  well . 
  that did n't sound very positive but ... there are my two cents , anyway . 
  i ` ts not a video , it ' a a radio broadcast . 
  the fall of the monetary union would not be a happy and relaxed one : there would be capitals flights , * corralitos * , devaluations , huge inflation , economic unstabilities , economic downturns , and unpayed ( or unpayable ) debts . 
  in the next decade this could lead to social unrest and the rise of demagogic and nationalist parties in the `` losing '' countries , and resentment in all of them . 
  this would not be a eu-favourable scenario . 
  i do n't understand the accent when the `` spanish '' guy talks . 
  that 's how bad it is . 
  to be fair , in 2008 and 2009 the things did n't look so bad as they look now . 
  you linked a comment that contains some truths and a lot of crap . 
  i do n't think it 's a reliable source of information . 
  otoh , our pm and the economy minister have been telling us a lot of lies , inside and outside spain . 
  they insist it 's not a bailout ( it is ) , that it 's only the banking system the part that 's going to be rescued ( a lie : the money is transferred to the government , then the government bails out the banks , so the government itself is subsidiary for the bailout ) and that the taxpayers are not going to pay nothing ( false : we are going to pay for the interest in the best case , and are going to pay for the principal in case the banking system ca n't return it ) . 
  my wife speaks several languages well and german is her favourite by far . 
  omnis saturatio mala , perdicis autem pessima ... that 's the only thing i remember from latin lessons . 
  there 's also a latin radio ( from finland , of course ) [ link ] ( http://yle.fi/radio1/tiede/nuntii_latini/ ), 
  some argentinians said to me that we spaniards always talk as if we were angry or upset . 
  i had to concede , argentinian sounds so much better , musical . 
  why spanish ? 
  ( not offended , just curious ! ), 
  sorry , what 's the `` th/s '' sound ? 
  could you provide some words as examples ? 
  in a few occasions i 've heard someone speaking in greek and it takes me a few ~ ~ of ~ ~ seconds ~ ~ of ~ ~ until i realise it 's not spanish what i 'm hearing . 
  it 's strange because the languages are not related . 
  true for spain . 
  i ` ts a shame that , being a touristic country , really few people speak english , and rarely good enough . 
  here , everything is always dubbed and subtitled to spanish ( they do it very well , btw ) . 
  yeah , people talk too loud here . 
  my worst experience is having four chilean guys loudly arguing about politics during a 3 hour plane trip . 
  every minute of it . 
  sorry , we 're trying to . 
  i have my taxes up to date , and my pay has been cut . 
  this is funny because i 'm a renting guy and i never benefited from the housing bubble . 
  and i 've never taken a credit . 
  here i go : personal favourites : - brazilian portuguese - argentinian spanish then : - swedish - italian - german - andalusia region spanish - catalonian - castille region spanish - french - greek ( edit ) . 
  i find weird how similar it sounds to spanish , sometimes . 
  - portuguese - galician - `` bbc '' english - '' ` merica '' english - `` other '' english pronunciations then only language i really do n't like is dutch . 
  it 's nothing against the country or the people ( they 're great ) . 
  it 's just the sound . 
  strange , is n't it ? 
  btw , ~ ~ do ~ ~ does the spanish `` j '' ( like in `` jam\u00f3n '' ) sound too strong ? 
  i wonder if it 's sounds disgusting to foreign ears . 
  main rule : ser ( to be ) - being in a state that is regarded as permanent . 
  estar ( to be ) - being in a state that is regarded as temporary , or simply being somewhere . 
  i thinks that swedish sounds quite neat . 
  is it true that when spaniards try to speak portuguese ( without knowing the language ) we sound like crap ? 
  yes please !, 
  our politicians here are so hated , that the idea of being governed from a ( fair ) european ( or even `` germanic '' ) administration is relatively welcome here . 
  i speak for the people i know . 
  when i was younger , other kids would laugh at me because i was `` too white '' .
