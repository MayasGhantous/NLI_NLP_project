two words : massive abstention . 
  it 's not about being emotionally attached , it 's about being human . 
  there was no proof that the dog was infected , and they used him as an easy scapegoat to pay for the government 's incompetence . 
  and there 's more to it , but please do n't let me interrupt your edgy moment . 
  absolutely outrageous . 
  they just killed the dog . 
  no quarantine , no tests , no proof , no nothing . 
  what a joke of a country i live in . 
  injecting a defenseless animal with a deadly substance without any proof just because `` he might have it '' ? 
  sounds more like murder to me . 
  she brought them to the country and did n't make sure to enforce the proper security measures to treat them . 
  just read the comments in this thread ... ever since they brought the priest ( rip ) it 's been fuck up after fuck up . 
  spain ca n't handle shit they let the nurse on vacation after she attended the priest who died from ebola . 
  and they threw the infected blankets into the normal laundry instead of burning them . 
  oh god we 're so fucked . 
  just tell him to not travel to madrid if he does n't want to die horribly i 'm panicking and i 'm like 500km away from madrid . 
  goddamnit ana mato in the other hand , feels good to be valencian right now . 
  then he would just use the spanish flag . 
  edit . 
  to everyone trying to correct me , ** in spain 's particular case ** , people who use catalonia as their location/flag are usually passive independentists . 
  it does n't mean they 're raging militant i 'm - gonna-burn-a-spanish-flag separatists , but they 'd rather say they 're from catalonia instead of spain . 
  you can calm down now . 
  more like `` do what i say or i 'll stop breathing !! '', 
  as far as the nation is concerned , he can go fuck himself . 
  so tired of the jews bitching about everything all the time . 
  it 's like that kid on the class that you ca n't even look at because he immediately yells `` i 'll tell my mum on you , you 're bullying me !!, 
  we sucked . 
  brb moving, 
  spain . 
  umm , those are n't neutral , those are the most leftist newspapers i know . 
  not that it 's a bad thing , but the purpose of this thread is to find something * neutral * . 
  some national pride right there . 
  so ... like an eastern version of the us ? 
  dude . 
  no monarchy . 
  it 's 2014 . 
  now * if only * we became a federal republic and stopped this circus once and for all ... a man can dream . 
  i think some of their propositions are borderline-utopic because they 're new to the political landscape , and they are n't aware some of the stuff they want to do is easier said than done . 
  people say they do n't get a good feeling about podemos ... makes me wonder if they know what a [ dangerous party ] ( https://www.google.es/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=vox+espa%c3%b1a ) actually looks like . 
  glad those bastards did n't get anything . 
  it depends . 
  if the r is the first letter it has a stronger sound than if it 's in the middle or the end of the word . 
  if you want a strong-sounding r in the middle of a word , you use two . 
  strong-sounding ( like a cat purring ) : * ** r ** eal ( real ) * fe ** rr ** oca ** rr ** il ( railroad ) * ciga ** rr ** illo ( cigarette ) * ** r ** obar ( stealing ) soft-sounding ( similar to the english pronunciation ) : * c ** r ** eatividad ( creativity ) * navega ** r ** ( sail/browse ) * cocod ** r ** ilo ( crocodile ) * ab ** r ** evia ** r ** ( abbreviating ) [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrvmjy_xtsi ), 
  yep , damn kittens are so hyper !, 
  a british shorthair kitten . 
  [ henry . 
  [ is this what you mean ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfbalpx8jmc ) i mean no offense but it sounds ( and reads ) like broken spanish . 
  holy cow , you 're just like my wife !, 
  she learned catalan by watching card captor sakura and thinks that catalan dubs are overall better than their spanish counterparts , she grew up with latin-american dubbed disney movies ( she absolutely loves alice in wonderland and would never watch a spaniard dub of it ) . 
  and speaking of movies , when frozen came out we downloaded both versions and concluded that the latin-american one destroyed the spaniard one in terms of quality ... it 's both a matter of taste and customs . 
  i for one ca n't stand the latin-american dub for the simpsons . 
  oh my god please hear me out on this one . 
  spanish : lots of insightful flamewars about which dub is better , the european one or the latin-american one . 
  it 's obvious that you 'll prefer the one you grew up with , but people are so smart they bitch about the other dub whenever they can . 
  just so you people can understand how fucking annoying it is , put yourself in this situation : german is the main language for almost everything , so voice actors dub all the good stuff so americans can watch it . 
  movies , tv shows , anime , documentaries ... and so do the british !, 
  ... but with english actors . 
  the content is the same , except for the accent and some regional expressions that americans do n't use . 
  so , a random american wants to hear once again the pokemon opening to revive his childhood , but oh oh !, 
  he found the british one , with different lyrics and a different singer . 
  what does he do ? 
  search for the american one ? 
  absolutely fucking not . 
  he bitches about how bad the english dub is and how inferior the british are for having such a cheap dub . 
  now imagine this with every opening , every clip and every movie where people can publicly comment . 
  all the time . 
  that 's right . 
  you 're lucky you do n't have to put up with that shit . 
  goddamn turkish govt . 
  is retarded . 
  it ruins them all . 
  end of story . 
  i 'm with tuenti.com , around 11 $ , 1gb and 75 minutes to call , which is a lot since i rarely call anyone . 
  about fucking time . 
  the question is , why the hell do you watch telemadrid . 
  ... if you survive . 
  lol , i think i 'll pass on this one, 
  abc and la raz\u00f3n ... ca n't tell which one i loathe the most . 
  finally . 
  i agree whole-heartedly . 
  both the king and his family are nothing but parasites . 
  i wanted to cross it out too , but i do n't wan na run out of risky places to visit . 
  list of places i 'm hesitant to visit : [ ] ~ ~ china ~ ~ nope , i like not having lung cancer [ ] ~ ~ u.s.a. ~ ~ nope , i like not having my privacy blatantly violated [ ] india, 
  winning the euro cup in 2008 and then the world cup in 2010 . 
  people would n't shut up about being proud spaniards and `` yo soy espa\u00f1ol espa\u00f1ol espa\u00f1ol '' shirt sales skyrocketed . 
  ** spain ** the ruling party made a [ cringeworthy spot ] ( http://www.abc.es/elecciones/catalanas/2015/abci-video-cataluna-rajoy-201509251045.html ) pretending to care about catalonians ( with a terrible accent for the most part ) , after years of belittling them and mocking their desire to become independent . 
  and just as expected , they 've been mercilessly ridiculed all over social media . 
  truly a popcorn worthy spectacle . 
  they did once . 
  things did n't go well :\\ ^ ), 
  i did n't understand a single word ... yet i did . 
  such a weird feeling . 
  and cs : go ... 
   they are serving german interests at the momen are n't they always ... 
  my so and i just got a job each , so i 'm inclined to agree . 
  you 're not one to talk about racism being a problem , honestly . 
  unless you 're planning to ask every local `` hey this is catalonia right ? 
  independence ftw '' , i would n't give it any importance .
