  well , people tend to lose their shit when you try to monetize something that 's been free since the beginning of time . 
  luckily it 's all in the past now ... 
  lol / r/europe too ? 
  no subreddit is safe ... 
  everyone despises gypsies over here , but i have n't seen anything `` graphic '' yet . 
  people wo n't attack/discriminate them but they do n't want anything to do with gypsies ( except buying from them ) . 
  i know they are attacked and discriminated in other parts of the country . 
  this is just my personal experience . 
  bravo !, 
  i do n't usually feel proud of our police but today is one of those days :d, 
  i got my mom to send her a postcard too , do you mind translating this please ? 
   dear isa ,  thanks to my daughter i 've found out that you 're sick and that you like to receive postcards . 
   i know you 're very young , so i 'm not writing much . 
  this right here is a postcard from my country , which is very beautiful . 
  kisses and all my best wishes to you !, 
   hugs to your parents and all of my moral support to them . 
   with love ... edit . 
  grammar and stuff, 
  can you translate this please ? 
   dear isa ,  i hope you like cats . 
  these are my little ones : henry and ichigo . 
  from spain with love !, 
  i live at one of the top tourist destinations in spain ( and pretty close to the beach ) , and let me tell you ... it absolutely sucks from october to april . 
  not nice , not hot , and no hot women . 
  just old people . 
  call me crazy but i 'd rather strip them nude , put them on cages and put them on display for public humiliation . 
  the cage should have a sign on top `` i < 3 isis '' and people should be allowed to laugh at them and use their cages as trash cans . 
  do this for a week and then let them rot in prison for the rest of their lives . 
  here 's what my common sense tells me : * the intel is overstudied at this point * nothing new can be gotten from it * they 've already taken advantage of it * it 's too late for isis to do anything about the leak i 'm guessing this is a `` yes , we stole your car but it 's already disassembled and the parts were sold and shipped all around the world '' situation . 
  that 's what he gets for being a sell-out . 
  the only good part about yesterday 's debate was listening to iglesias dropping truths like bombs and s\u00e1nchez not having the balls to even look at him . 
  i tried to replace google with ddg for a good month , and man , the image search sucks ass . 
  it 's as if my grandma was in charge , making sure every abomination she says counts as a valid word in the dictionary . 
  i 'm surprised they have n't accepted `` cocreta '' yet . 
  filthy language traitors . 
  it 's not . 
  in the valencian community , some of us speak valencian , which is like catalan with a spanish pronunciation ( pretty fugly if you ask me ) . 
  they 're very similar but some words differ ( e.g. 
  ` noia ' means girl in catalan , but valencians use ` xiqueta ' ) , the accent is clearly different and valencian is considered a dialect , while catalan is officially a language . 
  i live in the south east , and i always found it funny how elderly asturians always speak 50/50 ( spanish mixed with asturian ) . 
  by far the loveliest people in our country . 
  how about you come up with something better to compete against uber instead of whining ? 
  this is like seeing blockbuster complaining about netflix . 
  adapt or die . 
  never heard of it . 
  does n't seem like the kind of store i 'd buy from either . 
  `` fine , i 'll go to the comments , someone probably pasted the whole thing aaaaand yep , there it is '', 
  that 's great , but i unsubbed after 2 months . 
  there is a ton of popular movies that are nowhere to be seen , let alone shows . 
  it hit me when i found myself trying movie after movie ... strangely , netflix found every single one of them ... in a way :  `` titles related to < the exact movie you 're looking for but you ca n't watch here  '' they keep adding stuff but the library is still too small in my opinion . 
  1 - the channel your grandma watches , full of pseudojournalism , cooking recipes and health tips , with the occasional news thrown in 2 - documentaries , movies , interesting stuff antena 3 - right wing asslickers and strong promoters of our crappy tv shows cuatro ( 4 ) - crappy american shows , news ( mostly neutral , but leaning to the left ) and sometimes interesting programs telecinco ( 5 ) - bread and circuses for the peasantry , aka pure , unfiltered tv trash with its own news la sexta ( 6 ) - left wing asslickers and sports , movies and american shows too clan - kids channel , pretty much everything is unwatchable unless you 're under 5 boing - kids channel , this is where they put the cool stuff the rest are nothing special . 
  i 'm gon na sum it up : pp ( right ) : `` wow we lost a lot of voters but we still have the majority of votes ... phew ... anybody want to make a deal with us so we can stay in charge ? '', 
  ciudadanos ( center right ) : `` yes , all of my yes , and you guys should do the same or i 'll talk shit about you in interviews '' psoe ( sorta left ) : `` nope '' podemos ( left ) : `` nope '' small parties : `` nope '' ----- psoe : `` who wants to make a deal with us ~ '' podemos : `` what 's your stance on catalonia 's independ -- '' psoe : `` over my dead body '' podemos : `` no deal then '' pp : if nobody wants to make a deal with c 's and us , we still do n't hold the majority to stay in charge ... * all the parties look at each other * http://i.imgur.com/ifeez.gif ----- most likely scenario ( in my opinion ) : re-elections in a couple of months . 
  still , +7 million votes for the conservatives , +5 m for each of the two leftist parties , almost 30 % of abstentionists ... 
  quoting my own comment for this : [ old people and abstentionists are our fucking doom . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3xbfln/who_will_win_the_next_spanish_elections/cy39mfa ) sad to say i saw it coming . 
  i do n't . 
  rivera does n't even know what he wants . 
  he contradicts himself quite often , lacks character and it feels like he does n't have the slightest intention to actually * rule * , it 's more like he 's waiting to make deals with other parties to let them do the pesky ruling part . 
  most of the interviews just make me think c 's is pp lite . 
  his suggestions are either too moderate or `` up for discussion '' . 
  hopefully after the debate people realize this and wo n't waste their votes . 
  old people and abstentionists are our fucking doom . 
  poor guy is a dumbass . 
  he lacks both balls and intelligence . 
  he is pm just because there was no one better to choose from and a lot of people abstained . 
  there was a debate a few days ago and all the main candidates were there ... except him . 
  he sent the vp to fight his fight because literally everybody knew he 's a pussy , and he would 've been utterly destroyed . 
  every time he talks , the entire spaniard internet makes fun of him . 
  that 's how dumb he is . 
  and now he got punched in the face by a teen , son of a family close to him . 
  i kinda feel bad for him lol, 
  sweden , uk and iceland and denmark confirmed the only non-pleb countries in the continent . 
  i so wish he was the one giving birth to every unwanted pregnancy . 
  what a massive self-righteous asshat . 
  is he trying to find things in common with the un or ... ? 
  main representative of the most regressive institution in western society that held mankind in science obscurity for nearly a thousand years has the nerve to call something `` ideological colonisation '' and `` insidious indoctrination '' . 
  we 're witnessing hillary levels of pandering here . 
  it depends on where you buy !, 
  big supermarkets usually have sucky fruits and vegetables - the small stores is where it 's at . 
  but you have to buy carefully there too . 
  thanks but where 's the spicy factor ? 
  the hot pepper variety in this country is an absolute joke . 
  you better be , now i 'm craving guacamole and ca n't get any d :, 
  every time i read m\u00e9jico i die a little inside . 
  like when i read espanya . 
  i like when they genuinely try to speak spanish - i respect it , and if they 're having a hard time getting their point across , i 'll speak english with them to make things easier . 
  however , if they just stop me in the middle of the street and start asking shit in english , like i 'm ** supposed ** to know the language , i just play crazy , `` perdona pero no te entiendo '' and keep walking . 
  good . 
  it 's starting to look like a `` i want them to rerun the lottery until my number wins '' thing . 
  enjoy it while it lasts , fellas !, 
  not with that pm . 
  having everyone in the workplace wearing headscarfs while wearing `` sorry muslims '' signs sounds more possible . 
  because nothing attracts tourism like totalitarian regimes !, 
   / r/europe has no default stance on the issue it 's almost as if the sub was conformed by many people from different countries . 
  so microsoft gets slapped with two lawsuits over forced win10 upgrades and facebook could have to pay $ 5b ... great news , but it 'll be even greater when they 're actually punished . 
  `` now pls let me join the eu '', 
  almost as sore as we are after the election results , buddy . 
  summing up : - cmd + shift +3 = screenshot of the whole screen , file on the desktop - cmd + shift +4 = screenshot of the selected area , file on the desktop - ctrl + cmd + shift +3 = screenshot of the whole screen , saved on the clipboard - ctrl + cmd + shift +4 = screenshot of the selected area , saved on the clipboard and before anyone says anything : yes , it takes four keys on macs to do what can be done by just pressing prtsrc on windows .
