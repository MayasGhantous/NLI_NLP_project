  i 've always said and heard gouda , as it would read in spanish , might be a regional thing but ca n't recall ever hearing it called guda, 
  we do , sorry for the butchering !, 
  never a dictatorship, 
  something like pa-e-lja would be closer to the way we say it i think ( [ pa ' e \u03bba ] ) , but paeja/paeya would work too and is easier , the ll sound is close enough to those and in some areas it 's pronounced same as y. 
  it 's the out of nowhere weird i in between a and e what throws me off and makes it sound so weird . 
  paella , i 've heard some foreigners say something like paiela , which sounds really weird and harder to pronounce that the normal way . 
  edit : another one i remembered and this one is so common !, 
  i live in m\u00e9xico so tamales are a very common food item , singular is tamal and plural is tamales , but seems like almost every gringo ( even many who have spent time in m\u00e9xico ) say tamale for the singular , and i 've even seen one trying to correct a mexican about this . 
  yep , true , i 've heard that one more in south america but it 's also used in m\u00e9xico sometimes, 
  pasta - pasta/dough/paste lana ( i 've heard this in m\u00e9xico ) - wool, 
  and in spanish too, 
  monday . 
  good colors , i agree , but looks too busy , specially the tons of little stars part , i know they represent all the states but from a visual point of view it 's just too much imo . 
  where would they be deported to when they do n't have any id with them ? 
  once an identity is stablished will the country of origin allow them back without any official id ? 
  nothing can be done until those 2 issues are solved, 
  i have my id in the wallet , that 's what i carry around , for the passport i have a passport holder wallet thingy for when i travel and need it , but the rest of the time it stays at home in a drawer , no point in carrying it around plus its size makes it inconvenient . 
  26 $ , lasts for 10 years if you are 30 + years old , otherwise it 's 5 years, 
  i think you have a really skewed concept of what equal opportunity means if you are n't including in it things as basic as healthcare , housing or food security ... 
  from wikipedia : `` charles did not learn to speak until the age of four nor to walk until eight , [ 6 ] and was treated as virtually an infant until he was ten years old . 
  his jaw was so badly deformed ( an extreme example of the so-called habsburg jaw ) that he could barely speak or chew . 
  fearing the frail child would be overtaxed , his caretakers did not force charles to attend school . 
  the indolence of the young charles was indulged to such an extent that at times he was not expected to be clean . 
  when his half-brother don juan jos\u00e9 of austria , an illegitimate son of philip iv , obtained power by exiling the queen mother from court , he covered his nose and insisted that the king at least brush his hair . '', 
  `` charles ii 's genome was actually more homozygous than that of a child whose parents are siblings . 
  [ 6 ] he was born physically and mentally disabled , and disfigured . 
  possibly through affliction with mandibular prognathism , he was barely able to chew . 
  [ 6 ] his tongue was so large that his speech could barely be understood , and he frequently drooled . 
  [ 6 ] '' total jewel, 
  i know who was n't : [ carlos ii ] ( http://www.monografias.com/trabajos101/historia-clinica-carlos-ii-austria/image001.png ) , inbreeding is n't a good thing , guys !, 
  maybe our current king is the most attractive one we 've had ?

  only once in spain , it was a weekend 's night and i was walking home at maybe 3 am-ish , at this square by a street full of bars there was a fight , at first i did n't think more of it other than asshole drunks fighting bleh :p , but then i saw that 3 guys were beating the shit of another in a corner , kicking his head and stuff so i called the emergency services , they kept asking me whether the guy on the floor was conscious or not or if he was bleeding and to go check , as if i was going to get into that mess , wtf !, 
  so they said they 'd send the police and an ambulance and i left to go home . 
  around a litre per week to week and a half i think ? 
  whatever i use with coffee basically . 
  yeah , quite a few actually while travelling in latin america , not much to think about , very different places sharing a name only usually because the founder was from that place in spain , a bit funny when a proper city is named after a tiny village in the middle of nowhere that you 've been to , like [ this ] ( http://i828.photobucket.com/albums/zz201/osorno_chile/osornoaereo.jpg ) is named after [ this ] ( http://www.ayuntamiento.org/fotos/ayuntamiento-osorno-la-mayor-10501292.jpg ) , but that 's about it . 
  you missed galicia : they answer a question with another question and ca n't make decisions . 
  i 've only tried it once and did n't like it at all , i think it 's an acquired taste ? 
  to me it was just oily nasty weirdness but even if i liked it i would n't be able to buy it in my home city , or at least i 've never seen it at any supermarket there . 
  in that category i 'd say pipas ( sunflower seeds ) and quicos ( fried/toasted corn ), 
  very similar saying in spanish , give someone the hand and they take your arm .

  same here , i do any dishes that are left and put them away , pick up and fold clothes , etc. . . tidy up a bit so she can do the cleaning . 
  she comes every 2 weeks so i do some quick cleaning around regularly and she does the serious stuff . 
  in spain half an hour is normal margin and i was often among the less punctual of my friends , now i 'm living in latin america where if you are one hour late chances are you 'll be the first one to show up and still have to wait for quite a while , among my friends here they consider me super punctual which is just so weird to me haha . 
  portugal . 
  i have n't noticed any popularity whatsoever , and no , no desire to attend , many years ago i watched a bit of a game with my brother on tv , super boring . 
  i was also given the same name of one of my grandmother 's dead babies !, 
  but that one shat herself to death and my mother just happened to like the name , killed by a horse is way more badass . 
  no , only one of my aunts knows absolutely everybody on her side of the family from when she was a child til now and has some stories , but she just ca n't stop talking and jumps all over the place on topics people and what not and is super dramatic , now she is also slipping into dementia so it is a real chore being around her for long . 
  one thing i remember , but this is n't a story , but an interesting and kind of creepy window into how life used to be , my grandmother had like 7 or 8 children but only 3 made it to adulthood , back in the day oldest son and oldest daughter would get some family name and the rest would be just given the name of the saint in their birthday or some day nearby if that saint name was too ugly . 
  it was specially important that the oldest son would have the name of the parental grandfather for some reason . 
  so this aunt who never shuts up is the oldest so she got to have the family name , but by when my uncle was born already a couple of sons had been born and died in infancy , all 3 of them had the same name , they would just keep giving the same name to children til one survived long enough to keep it , so my uncle always had 2 graves with his name already filled in the village cemetery . 
  there 's this gypsy family who sells bedding stuff at the flea market in my home town , nice people but i feel a bit bad for the wife of one of the sons , she is the one i have talked most with and you can tell she is intelligent and had other ambitions but feels a bit trapped , gypsy culture is very machist , most women quit school and get married pretty young , start having children right away and are expected to fit this very strict role . 
  men make decisions , have much more freedom and do n't move a finger at home . 
  back in my old job we used to deal often with this gypsy guy who had some sort of authority position in the local gypsy community , he was nice but you could tell you did n't want him as enemy haha . 
  once we were robbed during the night , someone broke in and stole 2 cars , this was in a small city so our boss called this guy to ask him to keep an eye open and let him know if he knew anything . 
  so that same night this gypsy guy calls my boss to tell him to go to this place right away , that he had found the cars and the thieves , so my boss goes a bit freaked out , turns out gypsy guy and 2 of his sons had caught these 2 other gypsies , tied them up , beaten them a bit and had them there still tied for my boss to beat them at will and recover the cars , my boss was livid , that was n't at all what he expected when he called this guy , finding the cars yeah but not that whole mafia style crap . 
  order gazpacho or salmorejo but make sure to ask the waiter to heat it up for you . 
  insist in having dinner at 7 pm and lunch at noon . 
  mormons and jehova witnesses are mostly recent latin american immigrants , they are seen as annoying and weird . 
  paquito chocolatero, 
  what ???? 
  slavics !, 
  portuguese !, 
  catch up !, 
  the french are trying to claim your pessimism gold medals !, 
  you ca n't win in that when portugal and a bunch of slavic countries are also in the competition, 
  but but but pouring alcohol down the drain ???? 
  heresy !, 
  hahaha i showed that and raphael 's [ aquarius ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-haka7gcq0y ) to a friend from the us recently , he could n't believe what he was watching hahahah, 
  slang can be completely different in each country but the rest are minor differences . 
  small grammatical ones ( t\u00fa / vos , vosotros/ustedes ) and in pronunciation mostly the `` seseo '' but also more localized stuff like the `` sh '' for `` y '' in argentina or the way we say the s in spain , some vocabulary in words with prehispanic origin and that 's about it , intonation/accent also varies in each country and also in different regions within each country , but all in all we understand each other without much difficulty other than the random local word or slang expression . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b4ppc6b3ne ), 
  and desde santurce a bilbaooooooo, 
  argentines poke fun on uruguayans for speaking slowly , so they must be able to tell each other apart , but i could n't hear the difference to be honest . 
  [ amanece , que no es poco ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094641/ ) , edit : only [ clip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_fulhr6zfk ) with subtitles i could find and i also like a lot [ el milagro de p. tinto ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151572/ ), 
  valladolid , burgos , around that area, 
  and [ perejil !, 
  ] ( http://lugaresconhistoria.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/isla-de-perejil.jpg ) , got a rock already :p, 
  not everywhere in andaluc\u00eda , some areas do what you described , called `` ceceo '' , while others do s sound for everything called `` seseo '' and others differentiate between both sounds like in castillian spanish . 
  same could be said about spaniards , most of us do n't care , the smugglers and all that is what we do n't like but we do n't care who owns the rock . 
  also if you give it back it would be the end of stuff like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgjjmoen_ao, 
  in spain a ca\u00f1a , which is just a glass of beer , no standard measure but it 's smaller than a pint , closer to half a pint or so but it varies . 
  a jarra ( jar ) is usually a litre and a corto would be a small glass of beer . 
  heretic pagan infidels !, 
  we must `` invite '' them to convert to the true faith !, 
  sardinia !, 
  because it is absolutely gorgeous , fantastic weather , great people , good food , ... what 's not to like ? 
  read about that a couple of days ago i think , what.the.fuck , also carrero blanco jokes have been a thing for over 40 years , what 's next , no jokes about habsburgs ' inbreeding ? 
  in my area they are cooked in a sauce , on san marcos day there 's a festival in an island on the river and everybody goes there to eat snails from the stands , good stuff !, 
  yes , of course , portugal caralho !, 
  portugal and spain are like the siblings who like to either ignore or mock each other , until someone else tries to pick on one of them , only we can do that to each other :p . 
  depends , i can read pretty much as fast as i do in spanish , but sometimes convoluted sentences will take me reading them more than once to untangle them in my head . 
  i only look up words when i ca n't guess their meaning by context . 
  for writing i 'm slower than in spanish and get stuck now and then doubting the spelling of a word , with sentences that do n't sound quite right but i ca n't tell exactly where the problem is , etc. . . as far as looking up words , usually i manage with the vocabulary i have but i 'll look up words when i want to be specific or if i draw a blank . 
  i struggle more with oral communication . 
  no , if i remember well moving it to that day ( i also ca n't remember which one of those 2 it is ) was considered back in the day but it was kept on october 12th . 
  cost is a factor yeah , but also language , cultural ties , ease to travel around , etc. ...
