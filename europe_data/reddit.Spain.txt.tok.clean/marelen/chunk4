  cool !, 
  i hope you enjoy it a lot , 
  extremadura and castilla y le\u00f3n would probably be the most underrated ones . 
  that 's up to each person and taste , i personally prefer them to french press , but that 's just me . 
  it was the same in spain , the last name exp\u00f3sito comes from that exact same origin https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/exp%c3%b3sito, 
  nono , french press are different , mine is one of [ these ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moka_pot ), 
  ooooh chocolate con churros , have n't had one in years !, 
  mostly because i always go back home during summer but now you made me crave it hahaha . 
  of the commercial brands my favourite one in m\u00e9xico is blas\u00f3n ( in case they have it ) , and it costs here a bit under $ 4 . 
  i 've had that coffee maker forever , they are undestructible haha . 
  i thought coffee would be cheaper in the us because of those free refills everywhere . 
  in spain i usually pay around 2-3 $ / 250 grs if i remember well , but now i 'm living in m\u00e9xico and got spoiled because the pretty good stuff here costs around the same or less than the middle of the road alright stuff back home . 
  i make coffee in one of [ these ] ( https://bargaweb.barganero.com/fotosproductos/1/240x240/1636908_0.jpg ) , i have the instant coffee emergency kit for when i do n't have the time to make real coffee ( or for when i 'm so brainless i made it but fucked it up ), 
  [ this bread ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vzbn-p_w62y/uvcwubc-cri/aaaaaaaaqa8/arruw7ootd4/s1600/ta.jpg ) is called torta de aranda , torta castellana or torta/pan de aceite , it has oil in the dough and it 's delicious, 
  estados unidos ( united states ), 
  drunken karaoke spanish classics , total dandruff overdose !, 
  https://youtu.be/tfpqkpsajam?t=18 https://youtu.be/vx9tqs6lito?t=20 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljntnoc81oa https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imfgsvsaxm0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfn0bsfte6i, 
  when talking about the past , the spanish conquest and the times of the colony , they have a point and i agree spain went there to exploit locals and resources , some really ugly stuff there but it was also a very different time . 
  but if the conversation is all presentisms and personal accusations i 'd just ignore them because that 's just nonsense hatred and i 'm not biting . 
  luckily you only meet this second type online , in real life that kind of blind resentment is almost non-existent in my experience . 
  mexican food in spain is pretty shamefully bad most of the time , we need more mexicans to come and cook the real deal !, 
  on the other hand spanish omelettes are always overcooked in m\u00e9xico , people freak out if the eggs are n't cooked to death leaving the omelette super dry . 
  i like it with chorizo :d but if it has chorizo it ca n't have onion, 
  it is pretty popular in spain , specially among teenagers , i grew up on calimocho :p, 
  it was n't just a cultural difference in this case , it really went too far , i was having dinner with a friend from the us who was very annoyed and embarrassed by it , i was mostly shocked and not in a good way , it was my first time in the us so i did n't know at the time if that was normal or not , it was n't . 
  do n't leave coimbra out !, 
  it 's beautiful and midway between those two . 
  incredibly intrusive server, 
  the `` i might as well spit on your face '' look while not even doing their job right , but i 've also have had good experiences in france , it 's just that that one stood out as a pretty bad one . 
  worst : the us , bolivia and france best : portugal , m\u00e9xico and italy talking about specific good and bad experiences i remember and not necessarily the countries as a whole , although customer service in bolivia is pretty bad in general while in m\u00e9xico it can go either way and portugal is consistently good in my experience . 
  might be galician , it goes more up and down , like singing , but would have to hear a sample to be sure, 
  met once this guy who had the stereotypical bilbao accent even when speaking german , it was hilarious !, 
  galician accent is up there too , also it 's super contagious !, 
  there 's also the problem that if those numbers come from people self identifying as vegetarians that can actually mean a lot of things , from true vegetarians to people who try to avoid red meat and everything in between . 
  i know this is just anecdotal but i do n't know any spaniard who is a true vegetarian yet i do know several who identify themselves as such or as almost vegetarians ( be it for simplicity reasons or whatever , i do n't really know ) but in reality all of them eat at least fish and seafood and occasionally jam\u00f3n or cecina and the like . 
  yep , beautiful places , just wanted to show some examples taramundi [ 1 ] ( http://www.loasturiano.com/images/2061g.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.asveigas.com/images/oscos-eo.png ) los ancares [ 1 ] ( http://www.laspain.com/lugo/cervantes_lugo7.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://cdn.20m.es/img2/recortes/2010/12/26/4215-700-501.jpg ) a capelada [ 1 ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/55/c3/51/55c3513e8e8931c3548df1d703b69821.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.galiciaunica.es/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/costa-m%c3%a1gica-de-a-capelada..jpg ) picos de europa [ 1 ] ( http://blog.axtur.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/lagos-de-covadonga.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.yokmok.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/urriellu.jpg ) [ 3 ] ( http://photos.eltiempo.es.s3.amazonaws.com/80/22/e4397c7295a3e3811559ca5a793699e0_720x560.jpg ) [ cares river gorge ] ( http://static.wixstatic.com/media/5441c9_1362296f09fd4dabbb20ee732859f1fe.jpg ) [ ribeira sacra wine region ] ( http://www.aribeirasacra.info/uploads/1/8/8/2/18820202/672733_orig.jpg ) [ gulpiyuri beach ] ( https://userscontent2.emaze.com/images/4c280f38-670f-48e8-a5af-dd1a73d07da9/a7ad70df549131fb4be2ca200818ed42.jpg ) [ el gavieiro beach ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wg491kiy4ik/u3fkphtr7gi/aaaaaaaajkg/nktg9aeh5z8/s1600/220.jpg ) [ somiedo ] ( http://www.parquenaturalsomiedo.com/images/pic04.jpg ) o courel [ 1 ] ( http://www.galiciaunica.es/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/los-maravillosos-contrastes-de-la-serra-do-courel..jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.nationalgeographic.com.es/medio/2016/02/25/la-sierra-de-ayllon_960x648_9cf1613c.jpg ) [ 3 ] ( http://espanafascinante.com/wp-content/uploads/o_courel_2_galicia_lugo-1.jpg ), 
  not big at all , quite uncommon throughout the country and outside of the biggest cities and a few other spots it 's really rare . 
   claro !, 
  and for mockups i 'm partial to chema pamundi , carmelo cot\u00f3n and aitor tilla :d, 
  not the nationality , nope , but the long distance thing might be an issue and same for some cultural differences , but those depend on the individual person and circumstances rather than their nationality . 
  nope , that sounds pretty cool !, 
  we did nothing like that, 
  you 're probably mixing it up with spanish , where pronto means soon/early, 
  nope, 
  yup , cheaper and more english speakers than spain , neither country is that good for vegetarians but there are always options, 
  there are resources left , but in most cases it 's not economically viable to exploit them ( plus the environmental impact ) for resources that are n't in most cases scarce and can be imported cheaply , also , like you said , mining has been a thing for millennia so the easy to exploit mining has been done long ago . 
  no indians or pakistanis at corner stores where i 'm from , most are owned by spaniards and the rest by chinese or latin americans , and one by a bulgarian . 
  for us we need a song about corruption , but ca n't think of any :(, 
  yep , regional and national flag along with the eu one, 
  nope , speaking of terrorism the 80s and 90s were way more violent in spain than it is now and same can be said for other countries , it 's just that this current type of terrorism is international and not local , so instead of different countries dealing with their own local threats with little attention abroad now it 's seen on a global scale with lots of attention over every incident . 
  [ this guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/santiago_ram%c3%b3n_y_cajal ), 
  fully agree , perfectly said . 
  i think we should work towards achieving the conditions to make it a reality sometime in the future , because it just makes perfect sense to me , but i do n't think we are anywhere near ready to implement it yet and getting there wo n't be easy, 
  i think it 's also because there 's no hardcore monarchism in spain , at least that 's my impression , people like or support the king but very few care about the monarchy as an institution, 
  nope , no idea who that is, 
  that one i have less trouble with , with the `` v '' i can make the sound when purposefully trying to pronounce a word right , but in normal conversation forget it , it just does n't come out , but the `` sh '' i can do in normal conversation even if at times i skip it without thinking for a normal `` s '', 
  all the usual suspects of every native spanish speaker : every vowel sound that is n't one of the 5 we have ( and forget about long/short ones because my brain ca n't do that ) , trying not to say an `` e '' at the beginning of words like `` special '' , `` v '' , `` j '' and probably some other stuff i 'm forgetting right now, 
  first time i went to the us it was for the grand canyon , i really wanted to go there , then i made friends , and went back to visit them , wanted to go to yosemite , san francisco , travel along the west coast and all that . 
  it 's a beautiful country , i just wish mass transportation was n't so bad . 
  in canada i 've only been to vancouver and the rockies and i loved it there , ca n't wait to go to other parts of the country , might go to montreal this summer . 
  and further south i absolutely love latin america , so much to see both nature and cities , such cool and friendly people , interesting mix of colonial and indigenous cultures , just a great part of the world . 
  castilla y le\u00f3n does n't have an anthem or a capital either , i know the lack of an official capital is unusual , i believe it 's just castilla y le\u00f3n and the basque country who do n't have one ? 
  but as far as anthems go i thought it was more random , with the most nationalistic areas having one and the rest maybe or maybe not ... except asturias , but that one might as well be the national anthem for whenever a drunk group of spaniards get together abroad :d, 
  [ superl\u00f3pez !, 
  in the area i 'm from ( castilla y le\u00f3n ) it 's celebrated but there is n't a deep tradition for the most part , carnaval celebrations were outlawed during the dictatorship so once they were permitted again after franco 's death there was n't much to go back to in most places . 
  people dress up on monday and tuesday and go out to party and on tuesday night there 's the burial of the sardine to mark the end of carnaval and the beginning of cuaresma . 
  in other parts of the country though there are bigger celebrations , like c\u00e1diz or the canary islands , and also some small towns scattered around spain managed to maintain their own carnaval traditions . 
  i do n't have one , but this is what i was listening to now https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sval7le5gy, 
  yes , for me it 's been often a matter of voting for what i perceive to be the least bad one or so the worst one does n't win : / , there 's just too much corruption and populism around to feel that anyone is good for the job, 
  you 'd have to check with the university you want to attend , they 'd likely ask you not just for your diploma ( officially translated and all that ) but also a list of the classes you took to check if they fit the equivalent of compulsory studies in that country to access university , if some is lacking you 'd have to take them before applying to college , and also depending on which degree you want to study you 'd need to have taken different classes , at least this is how it works in spain as far as i know and i imagine it 's not too different elsewhere . 
  at least in the region i 'm from definitely , and do n't ever dare to leave a window open during a storm , the spirits of all grandmothers would roll in their graves hahaha, 
  the corriente , biggest fear of all grandmothers, 
  we do that too , and the [ bel\u00e9n ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xoo_poxj_l4/vi6hf_jh6wi/aaaaaaaaakc/n3_j8wzzxpk/s1600/20141215_094929.jpg ) which is the whole village , i think you guys do that in some regions too ? 
  at least in napoli i think ? 
  yep , they have it at least in argentina , not sure where else , it 's also a thing in m\u00e9xico , not south america but i took you meant latin america ? 
  [ spanish mastiff ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_mastiff ) , i really like these dogs , not the most fun ones since once they are adults they basically do their thing and pass completely on being pet or play with you or anything haha , but they are very gentle and loyal , very cool huge dogs, 
  que si la abuela fuma - whether grandma smokes : stop making silly excuses \u00a1 pero qu\u00e9 -- ni qu\u00e9 ni\u00f1o muerto !, 
  - but what -- or what dead child !, 
  : what the fuck are you talking about !, 
  como puta por rastrojo - like a hooker through/in the stubble ( a field after harvesting ) : when you are very busy with tons of different minor unpleasant works/chores to get done edit : forgot one i really like haha , nunca digas de este agua no beber\u00e9 ni este cura no es mi padre - never say i wo n't drink from this water nor this priest is not my father : never say never . 
  means the same if you skip the priest part which is optional but it 's what makes the expression funny, 
  not ancient but the [ cantar de m\u00edo cid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cantar_de_mio_cid ) would probably be the closest example i can think of, 
  mmm we could use all that nice nice infraestructure and stuff , sold !, 
  you better start practicing your rs :d oh wait , we 've been sold to portugal , nevermind then , you can go do guerrilla, 
  that would suck because portuguese from portugal is impossible to understand ... on the other hand we 'd get past\u00e9is de bel\u00e9m , bacalhau and towels , they all speak portu\u00f1ol and we 'd take cheese , wine and jam\u00f3n with us , so not too bad , i 'd welcome my new portuguese overlords and go on with my life :d, 
  in spain we are really bad in general and most people ca n't hold a conversation in a foreign language , things are improving though but i think we are still one of the worst countries in europe in this aspect . 
  talking specifically about foreign languages here , of course in regions where there 's another official language on top of spanish many people will speak both . 
  we do have some expressions leftover from long ago that would make any foreigner 's jaw drop to the floor even if they are used here with no trace of antisemitism and only out of tradition , probably the worst one is salir a matar jud\u00edos , which in le\u00f3n just means going out bar hopping drinking wine limonada during semana santa , but man does it sound terrible . 
  mostly walking , sometimes bus , occasionally taxi if i have to bring home a big shopping or something heavy ( i do n't have a car ) . 
  no , that makes no sense , nationality has nothing to do with ethnicity or anything like that , what a weird question . 
  spain : follow the camino de santiago til fr\u00f3mista , in fr\u00f3mista you can take a bike path that follows the canal de castilla and runs more or less paralel to the autov\u00eda all the way down to valladolid . 
  yes , every year an official calendar is published with the national public holidays and the comunidades aut\u00f3nomas can move those that fall on sunday to the following day or use it for an extra holiday at some other time of the year . 
  point is you still have the same number of public holidays no matter what . 
  you reminded me of [ this very cool old ad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfhamzfjjry ), 
  all of them as long as you fit their requirements, 
  no , i believe that the aim should always be both protecting society and rehabilitation so i ca n't support death penalty on principle based on that , and same goes for life imprisonment sentences when they mean no room for future release in case the inmate is ready to go back to society . 
  and this is not even taking into account the fact that justice systems are fallible , what makes the whole thing even worse . 
  same in spain , we do 2 kisses , i think you guys do one ? 
  m/m family and friends hugs or half hugs are common too , more than kisses , for special occasions or when you have n't seen each other for a while or as a `` hi , so good to see you ! '', 
  i knew him as some random american rich guy/business man with a very bad hairdo , but that was it .
