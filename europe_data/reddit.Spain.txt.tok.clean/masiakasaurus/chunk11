  take ciu/cdc/nowdil out of those `` the catalans '' . 
  they were pretty happy conspiring with pp to block colau from becoming mayor of barcelona while at the height of the supposed catalan `` crisis '' . 
  heh , one of his posters in ciudad universitaria had lipstick on it . 
  wtf . 
  they vote for plenty of women : aguirre , cifuentes , barbera , barcina , cospedal , fabra jr , etc , etc , etc. 
  this is not saudi arabia . 
  it 's sarcasm, 
  an interesting comment in another board points that we are during olive season and turnout is falling the most in provinces where it is grown . 
  since farmhands go home at 18:00 , we might see an increase in late votes there . 
  participaci\u00f3n going up in provinces more sympathetic to podemos , falling hard in psoe ( and to a lesser extent pp ) strongholds . 
  edit : less turnout in asturias too , which is bad news for psoe but mostly iu-up . 
  artur mas might be the greatest illusionist alive . 
  he also awarded the medal for police merit to the virgin mary . 
  the medal cops get for being shot in the line of duty . 
  yes . 
  that one . 
  when you do n't count votes of people over 60 years of age pp becomes almost a testimonial party . 
  home alone . 
  years ago , jurassic park . 
   also i do n't know how passionate about independence the catalonian are , but the constant shut down of the referendum could lead to a new eta forming pffffthahahahahahahaaaaa, 
  plus , he shares last name with a famous filmmaker . 
  i 'm ashamed to say that 's why i memorized it . 
  if c 's votes for a pp government with pnv and dil support i 'm going to laugh my ass off . 
  before i shoot myself , that is . 
  muh gun lobby money !, 
  the involvement apparently amounts to having a podemos flyer in his pocket at the time of his arrest . 
  the kind of flyers they are handing out on the street this past week . 
  plus , the skull is the hardest bone , for obvious reasons . 
  they eased the security to show `` closeness to the people '' during the campaign . 
  this happening to the introducer of the gag law , pusher for higher sentences to petty crime while lowering the ones for corruption and grand larceny , in the middle of the hardest economic crisis in recent menory no less , and restorer of life sentences in all but name , it 's almost poetic justice . 
  if he had not ruled against the country for 4 years , he would have not needed to fake proximity to the commoners come election time , and this mentally disturbed punk would have never come near him as a result . 
  i honestly have no idea . 
  they are very rarely in the news , and only for stuff like putting miniexplosives in trash bins and calling police about them . 
  like a saturday morning cartoon flair of eta wannabes . 
  kid 's a retard . 
  the way some ppsunos tried to blame podemos is just pathetic . 
  edit : lmao the attacker 's parents are wealthy and their home is almost next to rajoy 's house in pontevedra . 
  edit 2 : kid 's parents said to be `` close '' to rajoy 's own father . 
  `` your boy hit my boy ! '', 
  only ? 
  they feel like 10 !, 
  no mud please . 
  child abuse ? 
  but i made them !, 
  but according to the 1632 series , that 's only bad when the spanish and maybe the french do it . 
  there are two shows shot in the alhambra about the last years of the nasrid kingdom : `` requiem for granada '' and the second season of `` isabel '' . 
  why would this show leave out its villains ? 
  spain from about 1445 to 1517 . 
  are fatty aliens trying to islamize our pets ? 
  `` british best people in world , british study finds . 
  british media has its weekly sucking of own cock . 
  it tasted fine , like always . '', 
  so , do you think this will have an effect on the next french and german elections ? 
  the original false advertising . 
  it 's not my job to make independentism decrease . 
  if it was for me , i 'd demand a referendum to make spain independent of catalonia . 
  is n't most spionage actually business/corporations related , even when it relates to relations between nations ? 
  oh god ... we have had trillo and wert as ambassadors ... 0_o, 
  when was merkel a friend of spain ? 
  the best summary of the catalan election is this one from an user of meneame.net : `` before the election , the election was a referendum to the pro-independence parties and not a referendum to the anti-independence parties . 
  after the election , the election was a referendum to the anti-independence parties and not a referendum to the pro-independence parties . '', 
   they wanted to be independent , but they did n't have an army large enough to stop castile , so desperate sought help in france . 
  one king for another . 
  they wanted not to feed the * spanish * army * defending catalonia from french invasion * , so they went to the other side , offered to join it figuring things would stay the same as within spain , except without war . 
  then they were shocked that joining france meant to lose catalan autonomy , feed the french army and fight spain . 
  they promptly realized they fucked up , went back to spain , and had the fucking gall to blame spain for fucking everything up when they got spain exhausted and had to concede a province to the french . 
  a province where catalan is going the way of the dinosaurs and that has deserved no comment from paris except `` it needs be assimilated '' for the next 4 hundred years . 
   about catalan being nowadays near extinction , that 's fud . 
  they would speak french and catalan , as they now speak spanish and catalan . 
  so you are n't aware of the french government deciding ** not even a week ago ** that there is no official language in france but french and things are n't going to change anytime soon ? 
  that when a pro-catalan independence party was formed in roussillon ** not even two months ago ** , it was fucking illegalized ** the next morning ** and no one even rose a point about it ? 
  how can you be so fucking blind about things happening right on your doorstep ? 
  the historical infatuation with france is definitely the goddammost baffling feature of catalan nationalism . 
  the only thing it makes sense is as an effect of seeing the grass ( and the money ) greener on the other side of the border blinding judgement . 
  let petty hatred of madrid guide you , and complain only when you are being ripped apart by the wolves . 
  why should we worry , spain will always be there to bail out catalonia . 
  like the master and the slave , the more dependent you are on spain the less respect for it you have . 
   do they really think they can be self-sufficient country without spain ? 
  they demand everything to stay the same except for catalonia not paying spanish taxes . 
  they want spain to lift up her dress and ask to be fucked if they want to . 
  the fucking ridiculous part is that they are voting for a udi with less of the votes necessary to change catalan electoral law . 
  cup 's electoral campaign was not to support a udi if votes for cup+j xs were not above 51 % and look where we are today . 
   the problem is that the government of spain has refused to establish a dialogue a dialogue requires two parts . 
  all the catalan government has done in the past 5 years is `` do what i say '' . 
  they keep talking about dialogue but they make no attempt to dialogue . 
  it 's `` all i want now !, 
  all i want now ! '' . 
  then they complain that the other part is not `` diialoguing '' when they make no attempt to dialogue themselves . 
  rinse and repeat . 
   or to allow a referendum as happened in scotland . 
  there is a legal , scheduled framework to make such referendum happen . 
  the catalan government and the parties behind it have refused to even set it in motion . 
  then they put the blame on the other part for not surrendering and acting as their beck and call boys when they feel like it . 
   catalan separatists are tired of being ignored they are not ignored and they very much enjoy it  and no longer recognize the authority of the spanish constitution . 
  ... and they do when it suits them , and do n't when it does n't . 
  they also expect everyone to act the same it it serves their ( the catalan `` nationalists '' ) interests, 
  gerrymangering , posturing and corruption . 
  that 's why . 
  because pp itself gave up catalonia 10 years ago in exchange for reaping catalanophobe votes in cyl , aragon and valencia . 
  * that 's exactly what pp and ciu intend with doing this .
