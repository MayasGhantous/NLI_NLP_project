  there is a reason they do n't have a constitution . 
  tifu by calling elections thinking i had them in the bag - twice, 
  my shit poor undemocratic corrupt country paid your revolution and is the reason you do n't spell color with an ` u ' today . 
  unfortunately , it could n't keep you from sucking uk colonialist ass . 
  it is the uk who is taking gibraltar out of the eu , not spain . 
  was ? 
  picardo does n't live in gibraltar . 
  hold my wine . 
  it 's no one 's business but the turks . 
  nothing more stupid than a polish nazi . 
  ... well , besides a jewish polish nazi , i suppose . 
  `` boris johnson , in an even more awful-looking whig , reveals that he joined the lib dems to stop brexit '', 
  [ sehr gut ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/11iojb/the_german_word_bitte_is_really_versatile/ ), 
  tsk - the eu is not the world . 
  whoever knew that the departure of the country who joined the eu to sabotage it from the inside would make the eu work smoothly . 
  the story is so bizarre , i ca n't help but think that they are n't telling us everything . 
  a job as prison guard . 
  there are two kinds of things in the world : things catalonia is the best at , and things catalonia would be the best at if spain did n't keep her down . 
  i suppose she is popular with those farmers who are overturning spanish food trucks all the time . 
  and with those hunters in the pyrenees who would rather kill all the remaining bears and wolves than get along with the eu 's wildlife legislation . 
  interesting , could it have originated with the evacuation of spanish troops from denmark in the napoleonic wars ? 
  https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/expedici\u00f3n_espa\u00f1ola_a_dinamarca ( i always assumed it was something from the swedish beach tourism boom in the 1960s ), 
  aznar learned english so well he forgot to speak spanish . 
  `` uk living '', 
  showing that there is a problem would be a good start . 
   there is a clear mandate for the catalan nationalist parties to call for a referendum . 
  since when ? 
  the only reason separatists have a minimal majority in the catalan parliament now is because of past gerrymandering alloting more seats proportionally to the more conservative , rural and nationalist lleida and girona than to barcelona and tarragona . 
  majority that is n't even enough to change the catalan electoral law as per the rules of the catalan statute of autonomy approved by the very same catalan parliament . 
  it is simply ridiculous . 
   you 're not going to convince the pp . 
  it 's as simple as that . 
  newsflash : pp has no majority in the spanish parliament . 
   perhaps in the future , podemos might be able to twist the hand of the psoe but right now , due to the current composition of the spanish parliament , there is nothing that the catalan nationalist parties can do despite the fact that they clearly have a democratic mandate . 
  so the catalan government says jump and the spanish must say how much . 
  i know ciu/pdecat or whatever they want to call themselves would love it , but spain is not a colony of catalonia and the vote of a non-catalan is worth the same as a catalan . 
  or a citizen of lleida + girona , for that matter . 
  and they are too special snowflakes to even debate and try to convince them , so they demand they do what they say , when they say , and because they say . 
  they can take any issue to the spanish parliament any time they want . 
  they have n't . 
  madrid is literally doing nothing . 
  if you are catalan , you can be spanish for the perks and not spanish for the responsibilities . 
  or so they say . 
  19 months ago , the catalan president said udi would come in 18 months . 
  this is the first we hear from him in 2 months . 
  he must be really busy , though . 
  he is the best paid public servant in spain after all ( more than the king and the prime minister ) . 
  you must be new here . 
  catalan independence was superpopular before they read what the resident catalans were saying . 
  learn to read and stop deflecting questions . 
  i do n't even know why the british instantly jump to say `` but what about ceuta and melilla '' every goddam time gibraltar cries wolf again . 
  it 's like they are too stupid to realize that when they do that , they just show : a ) that they know nothing of ceuta and melilla beyond the fact that spain owns them , and b ) that the uk has no justification whatsoever to hold onto gibraltar , so they literally have to resort to whataboutism . 
  well , let 's start with the basics . 
  you can see spain from ceuta . 
  can you see the uk from gibraltar ? 
  then what the fuck is the uk doing there ? 
   this was rebuffed in characteristically undiplomatic form by equally unsufferable blabbermouth fabian picardo , gibraltar 's chief minister , with a literal `` hands off the rock ! '' . 
  preceded by three theatrically big noes , if i remember correctly . 
  it 's like he just met the sith lord who really runs the us from the shadows , and he said `` three months was enough for a joke . 
  now do what i had laid out for hillary . '', 
  in the us , ohio is a swinger state that always seems to vote for the party that wins the presidential election . 
  what region is the `` ohio '' of your country ? 
  in spain 's case it 's aragon . 
  woah .

  i was too young to remember but i think that means photos of the autopsies being aired on tv programs of dubious informative value . 
  i do n't think the trial itself was aired . 
  but i would n't be surprised if it was in the regional valencian tv ( c9 ) . 
  by the way : i thought i had included the [ alcasser girls case ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_alcasser_girls ) in the list above , but i just realized i did n't ( jesus what happened to this country in the early 90s ? 
  add to that the idea that this country is somehow perpetually stuck in 1600 ad , simply because in other countries schools do n't teach about spain after that date ( and with the accuracy of everything that is taught before college , that is ) . 
  i think they sang something different in the french version . 
  if you do n't mind reading you can try criminalia : http://criminalia.es/resultados-de-la-busqueda/?g=crimen&amp;c=espana, 
  a long-lived , mainstream , non-sensationalist program that talks about murders and criminal cases ? 
  i wish !, 
  the closest to that is probably some programs in regional stations ( like basque etb and valencia 's canal 9 ) and a short-lived series by a3 ( same that did the one above , but everything that station does is in some way sensationalized ) . 
  the only thing left are stand-alones or particular programs in more general investigative shows like tve 's informe semanal and la sexta 's equipo de investigaci\u00f3n . 
  but they already a pain in the ass to look for them if you are spanish , so imagine if you are not ... 
  funny , because your request made me want to revisit puerto hurraco , so i searched for a doc on youtube and intended to watch it today . 
  here it is : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ycywmub5m, 
  1888 - `` the crime of fuencarral street '' . 
  the first media circus in the history of spain . 
  people extinguishing a house fire found a dead widow ( stabbed pre-fire ) and her narcotized maid and dog in another room . 
  the matter became political ( of course ) , with some people accussing the maid and others the widow 's son . 
  the maid was defended by nicol\u00e1s salmer\u00f3n , former president of the i republic . 
  to his surprise , the maid declared herself guilty at the trial , ruining all defense and ensuring her a one-way trip to the garrote . 
  she screamed '' \u00a1 dolores , 14000 duros ! '', 
  ( 70000 pesetas ) before her execution . 
  the widow 's son was imprisoned for throwing a woman off a window years later . 
  1902 - `` the crime of don benito '' . 
  a woman and her teenage daughter were killed by a petty aristocrat who thought he was above the law . 
  he was not . 
  1918 - `` the crime of cuenca '' . 
  two farm wardens were brutally tortured until they confessed to have killed a shepherd missing since 1910 . 
  the shepherd was found alive in 1926 and the judge killed himself . 
  1959 - jos\u00e9 mar\u00eda jarabo , a spree killer who killed 4 people over a ring . 
  caught when the idiot took his blood-splattered shirt to the laundry . 
  1971 - manuel delgado villegas aka the puerto strangler , our most infamous serial killer . 
  not much of a crime case , because he was sent to a nutter house for life without trial . 
  1975 - `` the crime of los galindos '' . 
  supposedly unsolved mass murder of 5 farm workers with a very obvious solution .
