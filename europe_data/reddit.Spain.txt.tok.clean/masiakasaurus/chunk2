  spain is not , i remark , a * castilian * state , nor is spanish nationalism a castilian centric nationalism . 
  it always irks me to see foreigners talk of `` castile '' as if it was spain 's serbia . 
  in reality the word `` castile '' is hardly used in spanish politics , and castile outside of madrid is and has always been one of the most neglected parts by the central government . 
  this is fueled by the lack of an actual castilian sentiment despite those same minoritary elements . 
  most castilians asked will say that they are from their town or province rather than castilian . 
  someone from cuenca will be hard pressed to believe that he has anything more in common with one from burgos than with one from andalusia or valencia . 
  the main reason of a map is to be informative . 
  this one fails at that . 
  it mixes happily separatist with simply regionalist or even folkloric movements , and presents them as if they were the same , and equally strong . 
  most seem to be chosen at random . 
  it has leonese as separatists , when the aim of all four of them is to separate from * the autonomy of castilla y le\u00f3n * and have their own one inside spain . 
  it has * asturias * of all places as a separatist region , one where their inhabitants say `` this is spain and the rest conquered land '' . 
  it seems the author scrapped the bottom of the barrel to fill its map with new `` nations '' , yet at the same time forgot plenty of other pitifully minoritary movements . 
  you are paying homage to leonese , valencian , aragonese and even asturian regionalists , well why not include the castilian nationalists , the eastern andalusians that want their own region simply because they hate seville , or the movement for an independent community of madrid ? 
  those things exists too , and have about the same following and hopes of getting a line in a newspaper on a very slow day . 
  same in spain in 2008 . 
  then in 2011 a lot of people decided not to vote `` because they are all the same '' , and ended with the policies of the german * and * spanish right . 
  it makes france look like a micronation . 
  the banker that trusted his bank so much , he had his own money in a different bank in switzerland . 
  every member of his family from his great-grandfather to his children is/was a banker too . 
  it 's a stupid map either way . 
  you do n't . 
  spain will do not shit because it 's britain 's business . 
  this is not a kosovo situation where the independence was the work of an outside force . 
  spain recognized montenegro and does n't oppose its entry in the eu for example . 
  and yes , i 'm aware cameron put the fan and tried to spill his shit onto us . 
  if he says `` evil spain will keep you out of eu '' he does n't gather the same criticism as if he says `` i will keep you out of the eu '' ( britain also has a say in that , remember ? 
  it 's just a way to fight for ratings without doing good content . 
  but you are right anyway , a3 has always been dumber than the others . 
  there are so many lepe jokes that a lot people are n't aware that it is a real place . 
  i 'm just relieved that they did n't elope with the kid because he might get a blood transfer . 
  crying for vegetables not being exported to russia and suspiring for russian mobsters to buy overprized beachfront property . 
  this is funny because back in 2010 people blamed in part the british press coverage [ for the election going to russia ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/9252469.stm ) . 
  they do n't ignore it . 
  they are proud . 
  an octopus . 
  amazing potential , kills itself before reaching it . 
  i typed `` regardless of political inclinations '' with the very same one-testicled dwarf in mind . 
  all over the east actually . 
  there is a town hall in some valencian town that still keeps an upside down portrait of philip v from that time . 
  but others could argue that the centralization and reorganization began with philip v were necessary to put spain back on track from the place it was with the latter habsburgs . 
  ferdinand vii , `` the felon king '' . 
  he 's the less divisive figure in the history of spain . 
  everyone , regardless of political inclinations , believes he was an asshole and bringer of countless bad things that followed . 
  jeepers . 
  time flies . 
  the worst is that these cry wolf phenomena end generating dislike and suspicion about the whole group ( s ) , while the idiots that did it get scot-free . 
  soon as i read it , it reminded me of the retard that said a black man had carved a backwards ` b ' on her face for wearing a romney pin during the 2012 election . 
  of course , the b was backwards because she scratched herself while staring into a mirror ... 
  there is no spain in this study . 
  the iliterate who made the table wrote `` spin '' in its place . 
  shut up south galician, 
  1492 to 1643 ( battle of rocroi ) . 
  it was quite the long run . 
  the ban might or might not be prorrogated in september . 
  spain exports about 1 % of her weapons sold per year to israel . 
  it is merely symbolic . 
  but , it is a symbol . 
  they could have done nothing . 
  today you learned bullshit . 
  pujol is the sacrifice agreed by mas and rajoy to justify the cancellation of the referendum . 
  the fuck are you talking about . 
  she should n't have been asked that question because it 's none of her business . 
  the journalist is an idiot . 
  oh how i love when foreigners get confused about this . 
  wow . 
  these guys are tough . 
  i think we are finally nearing the end of that conflict . 
  i wonder if we will ever read news about who is ` liable ' for doing nothing during the 2014 gaza bombing . 
  eh , maybe her lawyer is sick and the poor guy must do the job of both . 
   the coronation has been used by the conservatives and the catholic church and he ca n't do anything about that . 
  well , he could have chosen his first visit as head of state to be anywhere else but to the motherfucking vatican , could n't he ? 
  i 'm surprised as well . 
  mostly because a titjob here is a `` cuban '' . 
  `` foreigner-hating parties of different countries fail to work together . 
  also , the sky is blue today '', 
  `` gangster will be forced to break legs if insured does n't pay protection racket , says report '', 
  dumping his sorry ass when they get enough votes to rule alone , i guess . 
  but you only talk shit about spain . 
  meanwhile , the catalan language dies in france . 
  mas pulling the reverse . 
  surprised : no one . 
  you do n't understand . 
  catalonia accounts for about 80 % of planet earth 's wealth . 
  they would be paving las ramblas in diamonds and tying the dogs with butifarra if it was n't for those dang mesetarian thieves . 
  how can they cope , i wonder ? 
  they earned the heavens either way . 
  they fell from there once , after all . 
  ` course , brazil 's climate is only crap to european players ... joke ^ joke ^ joke,

  and here i though it was because of those riots a couple years ago . 
  we did n't need a ghost goal to win one . 
  way before it began , i said this cup would be won by a south american team other than brazil . 
  and no matter the result , it wo n't erase the past 10 years .
