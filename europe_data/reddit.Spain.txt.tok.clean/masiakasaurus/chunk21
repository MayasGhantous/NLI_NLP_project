  you have these with a white family , white friends , white neighbors , white teachers , white coworkers , white friendly neighborhood policemen , except this one random guy who is black . 
  and you have these other shows with a black family , black friends , black neighbors , black teachers , black coworkers , black friendly neighborhood policemen except this one random guy who is white . 
  * people already talked about high school cliques - but high school graduation dances and high school football being a moneymaker for the school ( and the school hiring a professional coach to coach high school kids and nothing more ) is just as weird, 
  if it was the right stereotypes , for once , i 'd appreciate it . 
  usually it 's an amalgamation of caribbean , sicily and bangladesh stereotypes . 
  the tv pundits say `` con perdon '' . 
  in my circle there is `` hablando rapido y mal '' . 
  something defended by people who are either very , very young or very , very old . 
  [ you asked ] ( https://elementarypolitics.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/dumb-and-dumber.jpg ), 
  i think theresa may wants to regulate the internet . 
  she has said that for months if not years . 
  i also think that has fuck all to do with stopping terrorism . 
  so you did n't mean depraved ? 
  i assumed you meant that and thought you misspelled it . 
  introduce yourself in spanish , say that you are n't fluent and ask if you can switch to another language . 
  the difference is that in c 's case it is just hot air . 
  they are the latest iteration of aznar 's claim that pp was a center party in the mid-90s and miquel roca 's ciu national front party in the early 80s . 
  our habsburgs may speak spanish but they were so very , very much german first and flemish second . 
  they wasted an obscene ammount of our resources in playing the hre puzzle game and fighting the dutch ( and derived conflicts - * after * charles v basically created the netherlands out of whole cloth and made them capable of fighting back ) while neglecting fronts that were more important to us like north africa , northern navarre and the balkans . 
  they wrecked our parliaments ( in castile 's case ) and economy by using us as a conquered cashcow or simply misunderstanding how it all worked ( e.g. 
  the catastrophic expulsion of the moriscos ) . 
  they get a pass compared to the bourbons because the country was on top of the wave while they were in charge , but that had nothing to do with them . 
  the bourbons did more and better reforms in their first 100 years than the habsburgs did in 200 , and the country actually bounced back during that time ( but then charles iv , ferdinand vii and isabella ii had to come in a row ) . 
  `` spain is the strongest nation in the world . 
  it tried to destroy itself for centuries , without success . '', 
  -- not bismarck nothing speaks of a country 's past success like the number of countries who hate it centuries after the fact . 
  you tried it first . 
  and kept trying after the rest of the world realized it was a bad idea . 
  you never produced a stupid dynasty . 
  so you imported two . 
  edit : related to that : `` such a good vassal , if he only had a good lord . '', 
  - el cantar de mio cid edit2 : you were so powerful you nerfed yourself . 
  you are so humble , you only follow your own ideas after a foreigner sells them to you . 
  you never let idiots behind , but prop them to the top . 
  you might actually be more helpful than me at answering this , because i am often at a loss to understand foreign stereotypes about spain . 
  especially american ones . 
  it 's austria 's fault . 
   uk and spain : have been unified countries for much longer , but consist of one dominant `` nation '' ( england/castile ) ruling over the smaller ones ( wales , scotland/catalonia , basques ) . 
  they were essentially conquered and never really given a choice . 
  as a result , the emphasis on independence is much stronger . 
  you may be describing the uk , but not spain . 
   hello , i 'm doing a school paper on the rise of franco , and i want to discuss spanish cultural values that may have contributed to his rise to power . 
  then i suggest you do further research , because he came to power at the point of a gun and not because of `` spanish cultural values '' . 
   probably , but here 's still room for improvement . 
  obviously , but why are you talking of that like this is a mark of shame for spain ? 
  murder is bad by definition , but if i said that the murder rate is ** a flaw of spain ** , i should n't be surprised if someone came and reminded me that spain actually has one of the lowest murder rates in the world . 
   fiction . 
  fiction that stems from reality . 
  if there were n't societal pressures for women to leave their career and if women were n't expected to take their husband 's name upon marriage , those issues would not be worth exploring in fiction . 
  we live in a country where those are non-issues , because 1 ) women who have a career , if anything , are expected to continue it , rather than see that money invested in reaching it go to waste , and 2 ) women do n't take their husband 's name upon marriage ( and after the latest reform , not even children will bear their father 's surname first by default ) . 
  predictably , those issues do n't show up in * our * fiction because they are non-issues in * our * reality , unlike in other countries where they do exist . 
   it 's the exact opposite . 
  being good at something does n't mean that it 's a non issue . 
  this month women have died in spain killed by their couples . 
  aknowledging an issue is what moves you forward to improve . 
  ( ... ) i see these kind of things . 
  and looking away does n't make them dissapear . 
  and where did i say you should look away ? 
  my issue is with the implication that it is worse here , not that it is an issue . 
  to make another comparison : i could speak against anti-pedophile hysteria without supporting pedophilia or claiming that pedophilia does n't exist . 
   i agree , but even if we are one of the best countries in this matter , it still exist and it 's very backwards . 
  let 's not compare us with worse countries , only with better countries . 
  dude , in the matter of gender violence , ** we ** are the better country . 
  we are bottom of the barrel in nearly every stat about threats to women 's rights and the two we are not is the result of archaic laws that are may be in the books but not really enforced : http://www.womanstats.org/newmapspage.html just think , how many times have you seen a foreign show/film with a woman debating if she should give up her career to raise children or adopt her husband 's name after marriage ? 
  having such plots in spanish media would be nonsensical if not outright impossible . 
  so much for this bullshit stereotype of spanish culture being male-centric and patriarchal . 
  edit : your message is actually an example of what i 'd consider spain 's real fault : the widespread and completely undeserved belief that we are and always will be the worst at everything , no matter what ... and since we ca n't get better anyway , why should we try ? 
  this generates a de-facto stance against recognizing and valuing people 's talent , new opportunities , and hard work in general . 
  the worst is when it degenerates in actively sabotaging other people just because we see them as potentially more successful than we are , even if that will report us nothing and their success would actually benefit us . 
  how different would the history of spain be , for instance , if the navy had invested in peral 's submarine in the 1880s ? 
  how many cases are like that today ? 
  the guy who invented long-endurance lightbulbs in valencia and was scammed out of implementing it by rus and the valencian pp come to mind . 
  as does the fact that the government has basically destroyed the clean energy industry in a country that has more sun , winds and tides than the rest of the continent combined . 
  or british , french , portuguese , italians , dutch , americans ( of all countries ) , filipinos ... 
  turkey , it 's like watching spain in a funfair mirror ... 
  hmmm , it does have arabic as an official language , after all ... 
  in tangiers or casablanca . 
  i live in front of a convent ... 
   i 've seen examples of it used long before any significant swedish contact sorry to ask so late , but you made me genuinly intrigued . 
  can you name some of these old examples ? 
  english pensioners moving to spain beach towns and complaining that people speak in spanish . 
  beach serbia with a fantasy name, 
  there is a sizeable number of muslims in ceuta and melilla , melilla being the only town in spain where muslims make more than 50 % of the population . 
  they tend to get very defensive about how they are spanish and not moroccan and how their roots are old and deep in ceuta and melilla , and barring that , al-andalus . 
  even the odd crackpot who joins al-qaeda or isis will insist to their newfound comrades that he is andalusi and not moroccan . 
  locally , the rightwingers vote pp like rightwingers in the rest of the country , and the leftwingers are divided between psoe and a number of minor parties , also like leftwingers elsewhere . 
  some of these minor left parties are small enough to be muslim majority or muslim only . 
  their platforms might include stuff like making moroccan arabic an official language in ceuta , arguing that it is native and locally spoken ( berber is more commonly spoken in melilla if i recall ) , and at the same time have as their biggest demand that ceuta and melilla be elevated from autonomous cities to autonomous communities , making them even more integrated into spain , if one can say that . 
  they also have probably the highest rate of volunteering for the spanish army of any collective in spain . 
  the ground in the rest is too hard to dig cellars ? 
  an artificial lake 4 kilometers away . 
  true : we talk like machine guns . 
  false : we are catholic zealots who ask a priest before taking a shit . 
   el hombre lobo de allariz [ wikipedia link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manuel_blanco_romasanta ) this is so weird . 
  i seem to remember an article from a year ago claiming that he was genetically female ( ! ), 
  but looked like a man and was raised as such . 
  africans = hardworking caribbeans = latin lovers brazilians = football players europeans and north americans = like any other member of their nationality, 
  ... is that you , marc ? 
  the best known is probably [ manuel delgado villegas aka `` el arropiero '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manuel_delgado_villegas ) , who was the kind of wandering idiot killer type like ottis toole . 
  not quite crazy but prone to random violence and just too stupid to value life , he would kill all sorts of people just because he felt like it in the moment .
