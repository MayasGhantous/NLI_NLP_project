  they might call it comedy but i got tired fast of eyerolling , facepalming and not cracking a single laugh . 
  and dogs will be tied with sausages and naked women will rain down from the sky . 
  and it 's not bottom of the barrel stuff only . 
  last year , my father told me that his doctor was signing a new contract every friday , to fill the same post she had for the past two months . 
  and that was a public health center . 
  have things like that in mind when the government brags that x thousand jobs have been created in y time ... 
  please , ban ki moon is that weird chinese cartoon with the fake animals . 
  life , uh , finds a way . 
   the victim , named locally as otar tsukhishvili , was mauled to death this morning when he entered a warehouse where the animal had [ been ] hiding for the last three days .

  this is a pope generally perceived as `` cool '' , even by reddit atheists . 
  the numbers would be different if ratzinger was the option there . 
  i though this guy was part of the spanish branch anyway ? 
  that the descendants of louis xv died with the count de chambord and this guy is a descendant of alfonso xiii , just through an elder son that he passed over for being deaf , or something . 
  maybe there is another explanation and it involves inbreeding , likely . 
  as an user of meneame put it : `` but we still pay her luxury life in switzerland . '', 
  the fuck does this even mean . 
  never seen a pregnant arrow ? 
  italy : you can correlate latitude with street cleanliness . 
  as in , you can eat off the ground in milan . 
  venice , verona and florence are old but alright . 
  rome has a litter problem . 
  and naples is a dump . 
  did n't bother to go to sicily , the italians themselves adviced against it . 
  other things i found surprising : noticeably wet and humid air in the middle of july ( you never get that in madrid ) , gigantic street dogs , plaques honoring people murdered by the maffia , absolutely trashy tv and motorcycles running on the sidewalk ( they are seen as bikes rather than motor vehicles apparently ) . 
   `` it 's anti-natural '' , because as we know , everything that is natural is good for your health !, 
  case in point : epidemics and internal parasites . 
  completely natural occurences . 
  get yours asap !, 
  relation with europe was n't a topic in the spanish election . 
  indeed . 
  i 'm confident to say that every voter of c 's in castilla-la mancha actually wants a pp government , but hates cospedal with a passion . 
  her 4 years at the helm have been worse than 20 years of pp excess in madrid and valencia put together , practically parodic . 
  and then there are her gaffes at national level . 
  you ca n't even use the small patriotism card when your leader does n't even reside or work regularly in the region , but in madrid . 
  they are different shades of green , but it is not evident in some screens . 
  let 's give a minute to maria dolores de cospedal , president of the castile-la mancha region running for reelection and pp 's number two , who four years ago gerrymandered the regional election law to benefit her party - according to the votes predicted by polls * 4 years ago * . 
  in this time , the political landscape in spain has changed so much , that now she has won a plurality but no absolute majority , and none of the other two parties with representation ( psoe and podemos ) want her in charge . 
  had she left the former election law untouched , emerging right-wing party ciudadanos would have won 4 seats and could have chosen to support her for a second mandate ; instead , as per her blatantly gerrymandered law , ciudadanos gets no seats while podemos gets 3 , despite a difference in votes between the two of a little over 1000 . tl ; dr : in her attempt to secure herself a second mandate by dirty means , * she has made it impossible !, 
  in madrid city , pp only got 1 seat more than ahora madrid ( supported by podemos ) by the skin of their teeth . 
  they were still tied when there was only one district left counting votes , late at night . 
  it is practically a given that psoe ( third force ) will support ahora madrid 's candidate for mayor in exchange for podemos supporting psoe 's candidate for governor of madrid province/region . 
  because the only two things they have in common are knock-off catalan flags and a hatred of catalans . 
  jesus on a fucking cross . 
  it 's the end of the world ... and i feel fine . 
  2 and a half million votes lost by pp despite participation numbers similar to 2011 . 
  rajoy nowhere to be seen , but that 's usual .

  i thought we were supposed to thank god for italy , and just wonder what 's that empty space west of badajoz . 
  it is another venue for corruption that only exists thanks to heavy subsidies .

  [ evolution of under 16 marriages per year since 1975 ] ( http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2015-04-29/division-en-la-comunidad-gitana-los-menores-de-16-anos-no-pueden-casarse-en-espana_784529/ ) the total number of girls under 16 that got married in spain last year is ... two . 
  perfect example of law being so much of a non-issue government forgot to actualize it , until it resulted in tragedy ( the albacete one ) . 
  from first glance , the castilian-aragonese and castilian-grenadan borders are off , and the lordship of biscay is depicted as part of navarre even though it had been castilian for 150 years at this point . 
  edit : lmao they use the castilian spelling of aragon but not the castilian spelling of castile . 
  does n't this come right after changing the prosecutor ? 
  and as a result , gibraltar 's sovereignty is held by britain , not gibraltar . 
  because recognizing countries that come out of foreign armed intervention is the sane thing to do . 
  i 'll see you when belgium recognizes the donetsk people 's republic . 
  we do n't . 
   the result was a massive rejection of the concept . 
  the former governor of gibraltar is in b\u00e1rcenas ' papers , for fuck 's sake . 
  ceuta and melilla were never part of morocco . 
  but if it helps you sleep , we 'll give them to morocco when people jumps the border fences into morocco and not the other way around . 
  no , they stop them at sea and divert them to spain . 
  they do n't do that when drug runners come close though , but they do stop the spanish coastguards chasing them . 
  their self-determination is being a tax haven . 
  no , really , that 's the chore of the issue . 
  gibraltar has no sovereignty . 
  and you can also takle a guy with a gun without being shot in the process , but it 's way unlikelier than if the guy is carrying a knife or a crossbow . 
  i have not listened to news since early this morning but iirc all it took was an unarmed school worker who was not a teacher ( security ? 
  administrative ? 
  to tackle and disarm this kid . 
  his first victim and probable planned target ( the female teacher ) was injured with the crossbow * and * a knife yet survived , so we can almost chalk the fact that anyone died at all to bad luck . 
  obviously if someone wants to spin this to back their pro-gun rethoric it will happen anyway , but it can be used to dispell a pro-gun stance just as easily . 
  had this kid had access to a gun , we 'd been counting dead by the dozen . 
  here the badges do their work but the judges often do n't do theirs ( or are not allowed to ) . 
  our most notable far-right mouthpiece was a maoist in his youth ... 
  it 's the average time for any murderer , alas . 
  and the father then went and threw the gun into the sea .
