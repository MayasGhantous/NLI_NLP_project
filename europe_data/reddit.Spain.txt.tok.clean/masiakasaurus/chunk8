  lithuania 's current flag has the most original combination of colors of all european tricolours . 
  and you do n't . 
  a desert is defined by rainfall , not plant cover . 
  [ godwin 's law ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/godwinslaw ) is a logical fallacy that argues something is bad because the nazis or most especifically hitler himself did/liked it . 
  : eating sugar is bad because [ hitler ate sugar ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/hitleratesugar ) . 
  how times change . 
  when i was born the common wisdom would be that the ussr was funding far left groups in europe , and guys like the national front would be up in arms over that . 
  bulgaria is the only country in the world where turning your head side to side means `` yes '' and up and down `` no '' . 
  britain is the only european country to ever drive the wildboar to extinction . 
  finland is the country with more axe murders per year . 
  there is a buddhist majority republic in russia . 
  european russia . 
  the german word for cockroach also means `` southern german '' in northern german dialects , and `` northern german '' in southern german dialects . 
  people have forgotten the international image of the russian monarchy before the revolution . 
  the godwin of the time was `` the tsar '' . 
  public opinion in france and britain welcomed the overthrowing of the monarchy . 
  the governments had no problem with it ( or even the bolkshevik takeover ) until russia pulled out of the war . 
  wilson , who carried an unashamed pro-entente policy since the beginning of the war , did n't want to join them until russia was out . 
  only spain offered asylum to the russian imperial family and negotiated their release with the soviets . 
  and that was a personal initiative of alfonso xiii , more than a government one . 
  photographs were also considered a very serious affair at this time . 
  to smile in a photograph would be like showing up naked at a church . 
  poor kid got overthrown that very year . 
  that 's the british way . 
  the spanish way is `` make the locals yourself , especially when they do n't want to '' . 
  you do n't get [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/countries_with_dominant_mestizo_and_native_american_population.svg ) by going nazi . 
  well , there is that moroccan recruiter woman in catalonia that taught her 3 yo son to say `` death to the infidels '' on the phone . 
  spain in the americas was all about assimilation , which is the opposite of what the nazis ever intended in eastern europe . 
  there are [ no locals ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herero_and_namaqua_genocide ) in the german panel , as a clever french user said before me . 
  since 1789 , the french way of thinking has always been that if you speak french and follow french law , you are french . 
  there is no money to be made in the french league , let alone in a catalan league were the only sides worth watching are bar\u00e7a and ( huehue ) espanyol . 
  this is why the ** only ** independence plan drawn by pro-independence figures so far involves bar\u00e7a playing in la liga , as well as double-nationality for all catalans , eu membership and no barriers to catalan exports to `` spain '' , among others . 
  the rethoric boils down to being part of spain without paying spanish taxes . 
  that 's all they say , want to , and will accept nothing else . 
  and they have the gall to cry and protest because the other side does n't want to negotiate , when they themselves do n't accept negotiation , but blind acceptance of their points . 
  then again , we all know all is a lie by ciu and erc to ask for reelection after 4 years of not improving the catalans ' livelihood but rather making it worse while syphoning money to andorra . 
  it 's all those mesetarians ' fault that steal catalonia 's money . 
  our accounts in foreign banks multiply because we are the master race blessed by our father , who speakt catalan . 
  participation went up and they had to divide the cake between 5 parties instead of 3 . 
  that psoe won the same seats does n't mean it got the same votes : in fact , it lost 100,000 from 2012 , which was its worst result ever prior to this year 's . 
  i 've never heard an environmentalist statement from podemos . 
  of course . 
  they do wars for a reason . 
  not nothing . 
  and none of them were armed . 
  do n't tell me that 's dumb . 
  thing of anyone climbing a fence like that ( the three of them ) with a bag of guns . 
  'cause you are not going to raise an army with only a gun for you , you know . 
  why does the uk cling to the channel islands ? 
  you could do [ that ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/territorial_conquests_of_philip_ii_of_france.png ) with [ anything ] ( http://pittsfield.ss3.sharpschool.com/userfiles/servers/server_1057139/file/absolutism/france_1552-1798.png ) . 
  a gray , sexy time . 
  well there is a right wing pundit over here that is 24/7 on tv and is a blatant mouthpiece for the government . 
  he claims to be independent and apolitical but he fools nobody because just as the government changes discourse every other week he does the same , always in agreement with it . 
  the only thing that remains the same in his speech day after day is finishing with `` and that 's what they are doing in holland '' . 
  retard does n't even call it low countries . 
  and i wo n't be surprised if most of the things he says happen in holland actually dont happen in holland . 
  still , he seems to hold `` doing it in holland '' as the ever winning argument that ca n't be rebutted , and that 's pretty stupid in itself . 
  i 'm as tired with the fascination that potheads and 25 yo teenagers have for amsterdam and the red district as if it was the promised land ( or that there was nothing else in the country ) . 
  that in america i can understand . 
  but here , smoking pot and picking up prostitutes is legal anyway . 
  they are just not in some grocer 's window . 
  my final petty reason is the whole discourse about dutch total football and how it 's a great national side every time a world cup or euro happens . 
  then you play well for 2 matches and suck in the rest . 
  in fact , you do better in competition when you play worse . 
  that 's it . 
  it 's nothing serious but the thread is neither . 
  it was just the first country that popped in my head . 
  what 's that green spot next to moscow and why was it not russian for so long ? 
  will you hate me if i say the netherlands ? 
  most polls are actually predicting podemos to win the general elections in all basque provinces and navarre ( something that is n't remarked in mainstream media for some reason ) . 
  and it makes sense . 
  they are a magnet for a large part of the population that was tired of the nationalist bullshit discourse ( basque and spanish nationalist ) and did n't bother to vote anymore . 
  they have realized that pp , psoe , pnv , upn are all the same , and want results , not flag-waving . 
  it will happen too in catalonia when erc hits the rocks and sinks like ciu . 
  it 's still worth noting that podemos might carry barcelona in the next elections according to the same polls , though . 
  barcelona is half the vote in catalonia . 
  expected one from 1918 or so . 
  that other unified germany . 
  i first read that as `` the swedes have been busty '' . 
  did n't you hear the government ? 
  you need god to be happy , not dinosaur eggs . 
  ah , only 8 months more ... 
  ah , so this was just another instance of catalonia trying to one up andalusia . 
  iraqis going to syria ... tourism , no doubt . 
   i 'm having a hard time buying that e.g. 
  the spanish and the irish are that genetically similar . 
  both are cul-de-sacs at the westernmost ends of europe , one isolated by mountain ranges , the other by the sea . 
  it makes more sense for both to be the less touched by gene flow diffusing from the far east of the continent and largely retaining the pre-indoeuropean ( pre-neolithic ? ), 
  genetic makeup . 
  sardinia 's first colonizers came from the north , via corsica . 
  there are basque elections this year . 
  when europeans took over those places . 
  do n't tell me the design does n't scream `` 1990s attitude '' . 
  [ this is the flag of eta .

  `` if one praises england , he is english . 
  if one talks badly of prussia , he is french . 
  and if one talks badly of spain , he is a spaniard . '', 
   that 's bullshit . 
  what about the ciudatans + psoe pact ?
