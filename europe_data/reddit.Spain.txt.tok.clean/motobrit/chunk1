the democratic majority want to close the borders to foreigners . 
  do we really know that ? 
  boris was promising that freedom of movement would remain right up to the day of the referendum . 
  the official leave campaign was all about `` sovereignty '' , `` taking back control '' , '' # 350m a week to spend on the nhs '' , and `` not having to follow silly eu rules '' . 
  only farage 's non-official ` leave.eu ' campaign used immigration as a key point . 
  if one in fifty leave voters thought freedom of movement would stay * just as the leave campaign leading light said it would * -- and would n't have voted ` leave ' if it did n't -- maybe the vote would have gone the other way . 
  or maybe it would n't : maybe there are remain voters who would have been willing to give up the economic advantages of staying in the eu in order to stop eu immigration ( but i doubt it ) . 
  seems to me that the truth is that it 's non-eu immigration ( let 's not mince words : muslim immigration ) that people in the uk are really against . 
  who really gives a shit about a belgian coming to the uk , when he has to get a job within three months or go home , and is n't eligible for benefits or non-emergency nhs treatment ? 
  and of course , the woman who promised to reduce non-eu immigration as home secretary ( and totally failed to do so ) is now prime minister , here to save us from immigrants . 
  full disclosure : i 'm a british immigrant to spain . 
  yet . 
  the ramblas , barcelona . 
  it 's just a street full of tourists , pickpockets and the city 's shittiest restaurants . 
  there is ** absolutely nothing ** there for tourists to see or do , yet every tourist who comes here goes to the ramblas . 
  if that 's the standard , [ not in madrid either ] ( https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5698/21600289150_a2169cb317_z.jpg ) .

  yesterday i went to the orange shop down the road and told them i wanted fibre optic internet in my flat . 
  within 90 minutes the tech arrived , and an hour later i had a 300mb fibre connection . 
  i 'm still tempted to pinch myself in case it was all a dream . 
  this is ** not ** normal for spain . 
  mcdonalds used to sell it in the uk up until the early 90s . 
  at the time they also sold ` mcdonald 's cola ' instead of coke , so every time you ordered a coke , they 'd have to ask `` mcdonald 's cola ? 
  yeah and the racists on the acid attack posts are already claiming you 're only reading about white british attackers because the media [ does n't report on muslim attackers ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/6n77o3/teen_arrested_after_five_linked_acid_attacks_in/dk7jpzu/ ) . 
  not so great for the green areas bit though . 
  it never ceases to amaze me how many people here have dogs when it seems to me not to be a very dog-suitable city . 
  when i lived in the uk i had a 5 litre reflux column still . 
  made vodka with it ( i usually steeped fruit in it for flavour ) . 
  in canarias i have had illegally produced aguardiente . 
  pretty horrible . 
  in normandie i 've had illegally produced calvados . 
  quality ranges from `` as good as commercial calvados '' to `` induces vomiting '' . 
  i lived for a year in a ch\u00e2teau in normandie . 
  there was only the ch\u00e2teau and a couple of farms in the road it was on , which was named after the ch\u00e2teau . 
  the ch\u00e2teau just had a name , unsurprisingly . 
  then the mayor insisted we put a house number on the gatepost ( and supplied the number in the approved design ) and used it for the address . 
  we put up the number , but preferred just to continue to use the ch\u00e2teau name and tiny village it was near as the address instead of `` 3 , route du ch\u00e2teau le machin chouette '' . 
  mornings , after gym , before going out in the evening ( in summer ) . 
  so could be once in winter ( on non-gym day ) or three times in summer ( on gym days when i also go out in the evening ) . 
  shampoo : i 've got a buzz-cut so just use shower gel . 
  this is the one i was going to post . 
  dunno about the rest of spain , but people in barcelona work really hard . 
  i 'm from britain , live in barcelona . 
  i can only have one flair . 
  not noticed that myself , no . 
  i can easily believe it though with the terror attacks , and the increasing number of muslim immigrants . 
  muslim immigration has happened here quite recently , and quite quickly ( not counting al-andalus ) . 
  i 'm an immigrant to spain myself . 
  so i guess my life is multicultural in that respect . 
  in terms of participating in these cultures , i am a casteller , attend cal\u00e7otadas and correfocs ( all catalan cultural things ) , i have been to an iftar , my fridge contains korean kimchi , cheese from asturias , italy , and canarias , i eat spanish , pakistani , latin american , bangladeshi and indian food ( and sometimes filipino ) , i still cook french food and keep up with french news ( i lived there a while ago ) . 
  i have friends here from colombia , venezuela , mexico , serbia and other places and i go to their cultural events . 
  i watch spanish tv , and keep up with spanish politics and news events on the web . 
  i speak spanish to b2 + level ( still studying ) and french to b1/b2 . 
  i would still say that when i lived in the uk i got a lot from the other cultures that live in the uk , especially food-wise . 
  i do n't think multiculturalism is a necessity for a society , but i do think that it can enrich a society . 
  there are things from other cultures that you can take if you want , and leave if you do n't . 
  i 'm also aware that i 'm a minority in wanting to live in an immigrant barrio . 
  that 's fine . 
  different strokes for different folks . 
  a couple of weeks ago it was the end of ramadan , and at dawn i was awoken by the call of the muezzin at the mosque in my street ( this only happens on very special days ) , and looked out into the street to see all the people going to the mosque and i thought it was charming , though i realise that a lot of people would n't and i do n't criticise them for that . 
  diversity of cultures . 
  the building my flat is in is a good example . 
  we have catalan , spanish , british , filipino , pakistani , indian , cuban , and doubtless other nationalities and cultures . 
  we 're all minorities in this building : there 's no majority culture or background . 
  in my neighborhood there are shops , restaurants and businesses representing all these cultures and many more . 
  personally , i like it , and i choose to live in the most culturally diverse barrio of the city . 
  as long as the native culture is not completely displaced , and that natives are n't expected to adopt foreign cultures i ca n't see a problem . 
  i do my bit by not forcing people to drink tea or get sunburn . 
  strange definition of public place . 
  to me it means anywhere to which the public have substantial access ; streets , parks , roads , pavements , shops , libraries , museums , etc. 
  this is the legal definition in us , uk and spain anyway . 
  i 'm also pretty sure that hijabs are not ( yet ) banned in public universities . 
  yes , i think muslims are generally happy in spain . 
  i live in a barrio with a lot of muslim immigrants . 
  my neighbours are first-generation pakistani immigrants , there 's a mosque in my street , my butcher , greengrocer , supermarket , hardware store , and building merchant are all run by pakistanis or bangladeshis . 
  they 're all just trying to make a living like the rest of us . 
  there 's no burka ban here , but i very rarely see women in niqabs or burkas . 
  hijab yes : extremely common . 
  i 'm personally against the burka ban , and do n't think there 's any chance of it happening in spain . 
  muslim immigrants seem to be pretty well integrated in spain , at least [ according to this ( old : 2011 ) government survey ] ( http://www.interior.gob.es/documents/642317/1201485/valores,%20actitudes+y+opiniones+de+los+inmigrantes+de+religi%c3%b3n+musulmana+\\ ( nipo +126 -11 -022 -1 \\ ) . pdf/0bf98a9b-bd 97-490f-8e53-0e6885a34e0a ) . 
  82 % of muslims in spain agree that `` the three great monotheistic religions ( judaism , christianity and islam ) are equally great and none can be considered superior to the others '' . 
  only 5 % disagree . 
  and only 14 % of muslims are opposed to inter-faith marriages . 
   in france they have a ban on all religious symbols in public places . 
  that 's not true . 
  it 's just hijabs . 
  [ edit : not [ hijabs ] ( https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0704/7797/products/coffee_grande.jpg?v=1477047191 ) , [ niqabs ] ( http://d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_large/public/images/15/09/shutterstock_269101841.jpg?itok=rgnvaf5c ) ] religious symbols are banned in schools and some government offices , and employers have the ( rarely exercised ) right to ban employees from wearing them , but they 're not `` banned in public places '' . 
  you know that the us and uk deposed elected , popular and liberal prime minister mosaddegh in a coup in 1953 and installed mohammad reza shah , right ? 
  and that the backlash to his autocratic , brutal and corrupt rule was the background to the islamic revolution ? 
  it 's legal , and i 'm happy about that . 
  i never gamble , and i think it can be problematic , but i 'm tolerant of people who do . 
  banning gambling wo n't make it go away ; it would just put it into the hands of organised crime . 
  problem gamblers are going to be even worse off if they are in debt to the mafia . 
  to be fair , london generates 30 % of uk 's taxes . 
  yeah , surely everybody knows that , right ? 
  pretty common in barcelona . 
  most of my friends have it . 
  i do n't .
