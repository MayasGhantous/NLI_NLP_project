  lived in france for four years and did n't have to do anything like that ( though it 's hard to rent a flat without a job in france ) . 
  so basically it 's down to following local rules , or staying outside the local economy . 
  native english . 
  `` learned '' french and german in school ( in the uk ) . 
  in quotes because the teaching quality was so poor i really could n't understand a damn thing in either language . 
  failed french exam , and dropped out of german long before the exam . 
  did n't actually try to use either language until i was in my late 30s . 
  languages were not considered important at all at my school , nor by my peers or parents , which i think was common at the time , particularly for boys . 
  now i speak reasonable french ( b1 ) and spanish ( still studying spanish at b2 for 4 hours a week ) , and can read and understand catalan reasonably well . 
  maybe still have a1 german . 
  i 'm planning to finish spanish at b2 , then switch to catalan classes , and continue working on spanish with my exchange partner and self-study . 
  it is very important to me that i learn to speak both fluently .

   and there seems to be a clamour for people to do something but not much agreement on what that something is yeah , on my facebook feed about a dozen people have post `` we must do something ! '', 
  posts . 
  i 've replied to each asking what action i should support that wo n't make things worse in the long run and have received * one * response . 
  the response was that `` we '' should stick two fingers up to putin and send in `` peacekeepers '' without a unsc resolution . 
  which to me does n't fit the `` wo n't make things worse in the long run '' requirement .

  bureaucracy . 
  put anyone behind a desk in spain ( same in france ) and their instant attitude is `` no '' . 
  it still grinds my gears after years , because i know it does n't have to be that way . 
  if -- for example -- you arrive at a post office in the uk with a stuffed aardvark you want to post to ulan bator , the clerk will bend over backwards to help : they will see it as a challenge to solve your problem . 
  here , given the slightest excuse , you will be sent away unsatisfied and the desk-jockey * will be happy about it * . 
  is it only in the uk that you can buy a car from someone without having to queue up for hours at a government office to be sneered at ( and have to pay a fee for the privilege ) ? 
  yes !, 
  bars and restaurants are much nicer places to be in since smoking bans have been introduced . 
  and i say this as a * smoker * . 
  he 's long gone , sadly . 
  i guess he died or started wearing clothes and now nobody recognises him . 
  that 's a shame . 
  because now it 's full of tourists , bad restaurants , and pick-pockets , and after dark the fake hookers come out to steal from you too . 
  barcelona has so much to see , but you can skip getting ripped off or pick-pocketed on the rambla . 
  god only knows why all the tourist guides recommend you go there . 
  and do n't forget the other shit-related catalan christmas tradition , the [ caga ti\u00f3 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ti%c3%b3_de_nadal ) ( shitting log ) . 
  very popular in the uk , not so popular in spain ( though i have no trouble buying it ) . 
  the big question is crunchy or smooth ? 
  and the answer is crunchy . 
  huh ? 
  a diphthong is a sound formed by the combination of two vowels in one syllable , right ? 
  i guess you are , because i found those difficult . 
  at the start , even telling the difference between the different u sounds was difficult . 
  i really could n't hear the difference between ` dessous ' and ` dessus ' ( ` under ' and ` on ' for non-french speakers ) spoken at conversational speed . 
  i guess it 's because we just do n't have that second u sound in english . 
   the impression i 've got from people who know the gun club ( mainly 1 para and sasc types ) is that it was a bit too sloppy and that the then director special forces was quite scathing about the whole operation . 
  i should bloody well hope so . 
  it was a total balls-up . 
  [ or you could be scottish and have a table leg in a bag . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_of_harry_stanley ) [ or you could have a criminal 's friend in your mini ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shooting_of_stephen_waldorf ) . 
  that guy survived because the policeman who tried to execute him ( no exaggeration ) was out of bullets . 
  this kind of thing is thankfully very rare in the uk though . 
  we know that the special reconnaissance regiment were there ( from the inquest ) . 
  we know the shooting was military-style ; so19 not being trained to jump on people and shoot them seven times in the head . 
  we know the ` police ' did n't announce themselves as police , which would go against their very deeply-ingrained training . 
  it 's hardly a a great leap of logic to think the shooters were special forces . 
  personally , i have an open mind about it , but given that the police lied about * every single other aspect * of the shooting , i would n't be at all surprised . 
  even if the shooters * were * special forces , i do n't really see what difference it makes . 
  there is no eu law against flag-burning , nor protecting flag-burning . 
  it 's up to the member states . 
  many eu countries [ have laws against flag burning ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_desecration ) , but the uk ( for example ) does n't . 
  stop getting involved in foreign adventures like iraq , syria , libya . 
  keep tabs on what 's being preached in mosques , and jail people who incite violence . 
  the spanish authorities are pretty good at the second one already . 
  some would say the laws are too broad , e.g making a statement that `` could be perceived '' as inciting others to commit violent attacks . 
  watch out posting one of those `` we should just wipe islam off the face of the earth '' fb posts !, 
  despite the continued warnings , there has n't been an islamic terrorist act in spain that i know of since the madrid train bombings in 2004 ( 192 dead , over 2000 injured ) . 
  muslims in spain seem to be pretty well integrated , according to [ this government survey ] ( http://www.interior.gob.es/documents/642317/1201485/valores,%20actitudes+y+opiniones+de+los+inmigrantes+de+religi%c3%b3n+musulmana+\\ ( nipo +126 -11 -022 -1 \\ ) . pdf/0bf98a9b-bd 97-490f-8e53-0e6885a34e0a ) . 
  for example , 82 % of muslims in spain agree that `` the three great monotheistic religions ( judaism , christianity and islam ) are equally great and none can be considered superior to the others '' . 
  only 5 % disagree . 
  and only 14 % of muslims are opposed to inter-faith marriages . 
  i 'm pretty sure that those figures would n't be reflected in the catholic majority . 
  so i guess spain is doing something right . 
  a friend of mine hunts rabbits in la palma . 
  seem to remember him telling me a story about hiding from the police so i guess it 's not legal where he does it . 
   when you get older things get harder meh . 
  left my home country at 38 . 
  moved to france , did n't know anyone , did n't speak french . 
  found beautiful woman , moved with her to a beautiful city . 
  lived there until i was 42 . 
  moved to spain . 
  did n't know anyone , hardly spoke spanish . 
  now i live in a beautiful city , have a great circle of friends and a fantastic woman . 
  my only regret is that i did n't do it all sooner . 
   the people i know who voted leave did n't talk about it much , this was just a general feeling . 
  yeah , i suspected as much . 
   for those particular people , they are fed up of some of the eu 's more ridicuulous rules did they mention any in particular ? 
  like a couple of examples you could give that they actually mentioned ? 
  well , there 's the weather for one thing . 
  in a related comment , / u/kinokokoro says [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1updcy/why_was_the_term_blue_man_used_to_refer_to_black/cekg2cx/ ) :  in irish , we use the term `` fear gorm '' ( lit . 
  `` blue man ) because `` fear dubh '' ( lit . 
  black man ) can refer to the devil . 
   bunch of idiots who do n't know/accept that democracy means that sometimes things do n't go your way . 
  that 's very harsh . 
  the ` march for europe ' was n't violent or bad-natured . 
  the only arrest was a pro-brexit demonstrator who stole eddie izzard 's hat ( ! ) . 
  and i think the demonstrators had a point . 
  britain 's democracy is n't run on referendums . 
  the brexit referendum was called by a prime minister who did n't want it ( it was to attempt to steal support for the conservatives from ukip ) , figure-headed by a man who did n't want it ( boris , who just wanted to increase his political capital ) , and sold on a pack of demonstrable lies ( # 350m a week that we 'll spend on the nhs . 
  oh wait , no we wo n't ) . 
  trump will be president for four or eight years , but brexit will last forever .
