  even if in the future the uk rejoins , they wo n't have all the special deals ( rebate , keeping their own currency , keeping border controls , etc ) they had before . 
  i certainly do n't remember any demonstrations in the uk against a general election result . 
  the result in the us was legitimate , and in line with their normal democratic process . 
   today whoopi goldberg said that the us does elections `` better than anywhere else in the world '' . 
  i think it was a very ignorant comment i dunno . 
  maybe she has studied the electoral system in every other country in the world . 
  different countries in europe differ greatly , but in general europeans have a different attitude to `` freedom of speech '' than in the us . 
  for example , holocaust denial is illegal in france , spain and germany , but it 's legal in the uk . 
  i do n't know about other countries . 
  there was a huge public debate about the [ holocaust denial law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gayssot_act ) before it was introduced in france , and the public were overwhelmingly in support of it . 
  it was n't enforced unilaterally by government edict ( which is how americans seem to see it , if my reddit experience is anything to go by ) . 
  it was supported by the public , and it could be repealed at any time if a political party could get enough support to do so ( the front national want to repeal it because they keep falling foul of it ) . 
  in the uk , there are laws against harassment , incitement to racial hatred , and a law against sending malicious communications ( expressly designed to cause distress or anxiety ) . 
  this last law has been on the books since long before the web ; it 's just as illegal to do this over twitter as in a letter . 
  freedom of speech is guaranteed in secton 1 of article 10 of the european convention on human rights :  everyone has the right to freedom of expression . 
  this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers . 
  this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting , television or cinema enterprises . 
  but what the left hand gives , the right hand takes away in section 2 :  the exercise of these freedoms , since it carries with it duties and responsibilities , may be subject to such formalities , conditions , restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society , in the interests of national security , territorial integrity or public safety , for the prevention of disorder or crime , for the protection of health or morals , for the protection of the reputation or rights of others , for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence , or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary . 
  the truth is that the us also has limits on free speech . 
  if you doubt me , try threatening the president 's life , shouting `` fire '' in a crowded theatre , or just ask chelsea manning how things are working out . 
  or i guess , check out the [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_free_speech_exceptions ) . 
  we just differ in where the lines are drawn . 
  i really think the biggest difference is that over here we tend to be more pragmatic and less dogmatic than in the us . 
   if so , how does that affect your posts on reddit ? 
  absolutely not at all . 
  it never even crosses my mind . 
  the simpsons , i think . 
  yeah , but brits are pretty good at queuing , even drunk ones . 
  in a pub in britain everyone at the bar knows who is next , and it 's generally respected , at least in ` local ' pubs . 
  here it 's just whoever the barman fancies serving next . 
  so usually women . 
  so much so that for a long time i thought the expression was `` tiran m\u00e1s dos tetas que dos carteras '' . 
  for movies , yes , but estrenar is also used for real objects like shoes , a newly refurbished apartment ( `` apartamentos para estrenar '' ) , etc. 
  yeah , true . 
  if the standard is `` no single word exists in english '' you could post practically every german compound word !, 
   we have double surnames . 
  and so as a foreigner in spain some of my letters come addressed to [ my first name ] [ my middle name ( which is not my family name ) ] . 
  the bank managed to do this with my first bank account . 
  i stupidly corrected them before realising how useful it might be to have a bank account in a name that 's not actually mine . 
  not exactly . 
  it 's specifically used for the aches you get a day or so later . 
  also not one word ;-), 
  * agujetas * : muscle soreness after exercise . 
  the nearest english term i can think of is `` doms '' ( delayed onset muscle soreness ) . 
  apparently in latin america this also means ` shoelaces ' . 
  * estrenar * : to use something for the first time , launch a project , premiere a movie , etc. 
  * anteayer * : the day before yesterday . 
  i 'm still learning spanish , and like to ` collect ' these kind of words . 
   these guys just want to go to england because they heard it 's pretty much heaven on earth and they tend to be from places with historical ties to the uk . 
  and a lot of people in the jungle have contacts and relatives in the uk already . 
  in the uk i 'd say that most people think it 's about benefits ( because the right-wing press tells them that ) , but benefits for refugees are * far * higher in france than the uk . 
  people in the uk also think that all refugees want to come to the uk , but the reality is that france gets more than twice as many people applying for refugee status than the uk . 
  ah , ok . yeah that makes sense . 
  did n't notice any attitude towards the english language either . 
  i always had the attitude that it was for me to speak french and not for the french to speak english , and did n't spend any time in paris until my french was ok . 
  so maybe that 's it . 
  and everyone in france was tolerant and patient with my bad french when i started learning ( except for * you * , rude woman in tabac in lyon ! ), 
  i live in spain . 
  flair does the spanish bit , username does the british bit . 
  coins are fair game , but better to keep the notes as they are : all the same and with nobody on them . 
  funny , because i 'm english , i lived in france for five years , and never got any attitude from anyone . 
  people would mock british food ( except scotch whisky ) , but that 's fair enough . 
  when i was at school ( i 'm 45 , this was in the uk ) , all the ` surrender ' jokes were about the italians . 
  i suspect they largely changed into being about the french in the run-up to the iraq war ( 2003 ) . 
   and by the way its really stupid calling basques and catalans spanish and when they do something offensive , wrong or which does not agree with your ideology then they arent spanish anymore . 
  yeah , i was told ( by a canario ) `` catalu\u00f1a is n't part of spain !, 
  '' , then five minutes later he complained that `` catalans want to break up spain ! '' . 
  easy to find in spain . 
  and not just in lidl . 
  you 've got ta be kidding ... 
  it 's the best !, 
  butter beats olive oil hands-down for fried eggs !, 
  yeah , i once bought ` bacon de pavo ' because it said on the packet that it had 70 % less fat . 
  what it did n't say on the packet was that it had 100 % more horrible . 
  that day i vowed to never again eat the meat of the turkey-pig . 
  it exists at about a similar profile in both france and spain : sliced processed meats , and to a lesser extent fresh , but pretty much always in pieces , not whole birds . 
  they 're not eaten for christmas ( and obviously not thanksgiving ) here . 
  slightly off-topic , in english they 're apparently called ` turkeys ' because it was thought they came from turkey . 
  in france they 're called ` dinde ' because it was thought they came from india ( ` poulet * d'inde * ' ) . 
  this goes on in [ a bunch of european languages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_names_for_turkeys ) . 
  most seem to agree on the indian thing ( they are of course from the new world ) . 
  el laberinto del fauno todo sobre mi madre los girasoles ciegos ( ok , i mainly picked this because i have a massive crush on maribel verd\u00fa ), 
  and great year-round weather . 
  la palma is beautiful if you like a quiet life , and property is cheap . 
   i personally am of the opinion a ban on abortion is a breach in a woman 's personal freedom i totally agree . 
   and the eu needs to be way more proactive on this issue i totally disagree . 
  the situation is the same in ireland and it 's down to the irish to change their constitution , not the eu . 
  ` una cubana ' here . 
  seems to me that a pretty high proportion of brits want unfettered access to the eu markets but do n't want freedom of movement . 
  it 's like it 's ok for money , goods and services to move around freely , but not people . 
  i 'm really glad the rest of the eu is refusing to compromise on this . 
  money has the right to move freely ? 
  so should people . 
  if people accept ` hard brexit ' ( no freedom of movement , no special access to eu markets ) , then fine ; i respect that ( though it 's not my preference ) . 
  barcelona : tallest are the ' [ twin towers ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/1307070.jpg ) ' ( hotel arts and torre mapfre ) at 154m . 
  best-looking tall building ( imo ) is the [ torre agbar ] ( http://bcnshop.barcelonaturisme.com/files/5445-7583-imagen/torre-agbar-noche-arquitectura-barcelona-pf-c1.jpg ) at 144m . 
  looks like a giant vibrator . 
  tallest * structure * is the [ torre de collserola ] ( http://www.vuelosalmundo.es/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_19197604.jpg ) at 288m . 
  the top floor of the ` pod ' is 152m , and the tower is supported by guy wires . 
  i speak spanish and french , and can understand a fair bit of catalan .
