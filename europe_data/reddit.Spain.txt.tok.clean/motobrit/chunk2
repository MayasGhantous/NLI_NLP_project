  i just have a big-ass fan . 
  much cheaper to run , and i can leave the windows open . 
  i 've thought about installing air-con , but not taken the plunge . 
  my parents have air-con in the bedroom ** in the uk ** . 
  my mother gets very hot at night . 
  what is this map ? 
  when was -- say -- brazil a british colony ? 
  i hope you 're right , but he 's shrugged off every other scandal he 's had , including having been sacked * several * times for outright lying . 
  and predictions of how political things are going to go have n't been panning out very well lately for the predictors ... 
   well sure , they 're citizens but i wonder if any of them would actually consider themselves spanish . 
  they probably do n't . 
  no , they do n't . 
  not at all . 
  to be fair , he is the only one i can think of meeting . 
  [ edit : also met a german in la palma , canarias who 'd lived there for over 10 years and could n't hold a conversation in spanish ! ], 
  all my friends from non-spanish speaking countries have either studied hard and speak at least b2 spanish , or are still studying . 
  a good number of them have also studied catalan . 
  i only know one non-catalan hispanohablante who has studied catalan though . 
   it 's practically impossible to find citizens who ca n't speak spanish true i 'm sure , but i know two !, 
  both born in spain to a spanish father and english mother , left spain when they were 2.5 and 6 months respectively ( now mid-20s ) . 
  they 've never lived in spain since , and only one has even been here on holiday . 
  spanish citizenship is also available to anyone born to a spanish parent , so even if they had been born in england they would have been eligible ( without the language or culture test , as far as i know ) . 
  the language part of the citizenship test is pretty easy . 
  you only need level a2 . 
  the constitution and culture bit actually requires better reading comprehension in spanish than the language test . 
  [ model ccse test ] ( https://www.pruebaccse.com/modelo-de-prueba-ejemplo-oficial/ ) [ model language test ] ( http://www.parainmigrantes.info/modelo-de-examen-dele-a2-examen-de-idioma-para-la-nacionalidad-espanola/ ) i have n't actually taken the tests for real yet , just for fun . 
  i have to wait another 8 years before i 'm eligible for citizenship anyway . 
  stooooory time !, 
  i had been in spain a few months , and was in a bar near the sagrada fam\u00edlia . 
  there was a irishman of about 65 years trying to order a vodka and tonic from the non-english speaking barman , but somehow failing at this task . 
  i provided ` translation ' services , irish dude gets his vt. 
  so we get to talking ... 
  he tells me he owned and ran a bar nearby for ** eleven years ** , owns property in the city , and can not speak any spanish or catalan . 
  and if bojo the clown takes over ? 
  prefer it !, 
  sweeter , fruitier , rounder mouth-feel . 
  torres 10 ( catalan , $ 13 ) is my current favourite , but i 'd be happier with really cheap stuff like magno ( jerez , $ 9.50 ) than -- say -- hennessy xo . 
  i lived in france and have tried quite a few mid-to-high end cognacs . 
  yeah , i like it as a digestif . 
  i 'm going to go ahead and outrage the french here by saying i prefer cheap spanish brandy to expensive french cognac .

  black friday . 
  i mean , wtf ? 
  we do n't even have thanksgiving !, 
  halloween ** is ** all hallow 's eve : the day before all saints day ( `` all hallows '' ) , which is the day before all souls ' day . 
  all together they 're called [ allhallowtide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allhallowtide ) . 
  i feel the same . 
  without the eu we 'd just be a bunch of countries again ( i know some people would like that , but i would n't ) , but i think we 're stronger together , and that the eu brings us together as people . 
  the eu has also given me the opportunity to live and work in france and spain , which i never would otherwise have had ( i 'm self-employed so no employer to sponsor me for a visa ) . 
  there are a good number of uk politicians who want to reduce state spending to us-style levels as proportion of gdp ( eg , george osborne ) , and to have a us-style health service ( eg , jeremy hunt ) . 
  but they do n't really have the balls to try and sell the idea to the public . 
  instead , they talk about `` austerity '' and `` nhs is in unsustainable crisis '' . 
  i doubt opinion has changed much in [ 23 days ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6d6lgh/europeans_living_in_monarchies_besides_the_uk_how/?ref=search_posts ) . 
  sigh . 
  the trolls on here barely even * try * any more . 
  no , i mean eu citizens . 
  if you do n't have a job or be financially independent in three months of arrival the uk can kick you out ( they do this to lots of gypsies , seen it on the tv ) . 
  in spain you 've got the nie requirement : you have to have a nie by law after three months , and you can only get one with a job contract or by providing a bank certificate showing deposits of over $ 5k and private no-limit , zero-co-pay health insurance . 
  there 's freedom of movement of ** labour ** , but not benefit claimant ( afaik ) . 
  eu migrants have three months to find a job or they have to leave , unless they can show that they can support themselves ( savings + private health insurance ) . 
  this is the case in spain and the uk anyway , i 'm assuming it 's the same across the eu . 
  this seems completely fair to me . 
  i do n't expect eu countries to take in other eu countries ' citizens and provide for them . 
  if a migrant comes to a country with no ability to speak the language , i fail to see how they will be that much more employable in three months , even with free language classes . 
  i would n't support free language classes for jobless recently-arrived eu migrants , as they 're not eligible for state benefits , and that 's opening a big can of worms . 
  refugees would be a different matter , though in the uk for one they are not allowed to work , so it wo n't help them find a job , but should make their lives easier . 
  here in barcelona there are a lot of eu immigrants that do n't speak spanish or catalan , but they tend to have jobs where they do n't need to ( call centres in their own language , english teaching , tech and science jobs where english is spoken in the workplace ) . 
  i 'm not sure we have many low-skilled eu migrants ; i imagine they want to go somewhere with a lower rate of unemployment . 
  we have quite a lot of illegal immigrants from africa though . 
  cataluyna also gives almost-free catalan classes ( at least to intermediate level ) to anyone who legally lives here , no matter where they come from . 
  native english . 
  helps a bit with german ( sometimes ) . 
  still understand my scouse mate better when he speaks spanish than english though . 
  french , made learning spanish easier , did n't really help me understand any languages though . 
  spanish : comes with free bonus ability to understand the sense of conversations in italian and catalan . 
  aaaa + would definitely learn again . 
  catalan : i 've not put a great deal of effort in yet ( still learning spanish ) but understand 80 % with what little effort i have put in ( sorry catalans ; i 'll start properly when i 've passed my b2 spanish ), 
  pg tips . 
  $ 7 for 200 `` 2-cup '' catering bags . 
  they make one cup . 
  earl grey tastes to me like someone 's squirted cheap perfume in it . 
  / straying offtopic my ( bcn catalan ) gf says she only says `` oncle '' for her actual uncle , and tio only to mean ` dude ' . 
  i do n't doubt it 's different in other areas though . 
  tiet and tieta are used colloquially here to mean uncle and aunt too . 
  i want : * soft brexit ( by which i mean a good trade deal for both sides ) * rights for eu citizens in the uk and vice versa . 
  if necessary limited to those who are already on the wrong side of the channel . 
  * the uk to have no influence in internal eu affairs with the right deal , this could work out well for both sides . 
   what could possibly go wrong ? 
   & nbsp ;  oh wait , many things already have yeah , the euro has collapsed in value , and the leaders of the eu have scored two electoral own-goals in a little over a year and made themselves laughing stocks . 
  oh wait , my bad : that 's britain . 
  it has effectively removed her mandate for a `` hard brexit '' though . 
  ca n't really help because it depends on your tastes and budget . 
  but i can say that you have the three worst places for pickpockets in the world on your list , so be super-careful . 
  in order : barcelona , rome , paris . 
  no wallets or phones in back pockets , ignore anyone who tries to talk to you in the street , keep bags zipped and in front of you , do n't put phones or wallets down on caf\u00e9 tables . 
  follow these rules and the pickpockets will steal from someone else .
