  do n't let it put you off visiting ; i live in central barcelona and love it , and i do n't get pickpocketed . 
  cards : if they 're not `` chip and pin '' they almost certainly wo n't be accepted in shops , and also some atms . 
  uk -  france -  spain ( canarias ) -  france -  spain ( catalunya ), 
  yep , there are many , many filipinos in north raval in barcelona . 
  i lived in a house with 8 flats and 4 were filipino families , and when i walk past one particular local school in the afternoon it seems to be 90 % filipino kids . 
  they seem very nice , and very family-oriented . 
  not yet for me either , but i got a text from orange yesterday saying that free eu roaming will be included in my tariff from 15/06 . 
  the day they are * forced * to include it . 
  i 'd like two girls so i can name them portia and mercedes . 
  i 'm not even really into cars . 
  just child cruelty . 
  i honestly do n't mind people having or expressing these opinions , but it 's not what this sub is for . 
  this thread needs to be deleted .

  spain : bought a flat recently . 
  day 1 : viewed flat , liked it , paid a ` signal of interest ' ( small holding deposit , $ 1000 ) day 5 : paid the actual deposit ( 10 % of price , minus the $ 1000 already paid ) day 10 : lawyer checked ownership , ensured no outstanding charges/taxes , looked over the paperwork ( certificate of habitability , technical inspection report that all houses have to have here ) . 
  he charged me $ 150 for this , which i thought was very little . 
  day 21 : transferred deeds , paid balance and taxes ( 10 % of purchase price ) , took keys . 
  it could have been quicker , it 's just that we set the date for the transfer for a day that both parties were available . 
  yeah , i took a while to adjust to that . 
  in the uk if you 're chatting to a woman in a bar and she touches you on the shoulder when she laughs , she is showing * very * strong interest in you . 
  here , it means nothing special . 
  yeah , i 've seen stand-up bars in madrid where everyone is even throwing their * prawn shells * on the floor . 
  i 'm thankful that people are more civilised up here . 
  every day before leaving the house , and again after working out ( which i try to do 3 times a week ) . 
  often it 'll be three times in summer because i 'll shower again before going out in the evening . 
  it 's so hot and humid here in summer that when you get out of the shower , you never really dry because you start sweating again straight away . 
  i live in barcelona , and i love it . 
  i had to go back to the uk a couple of years back for family reasons and things just kept reminding me of bcn . 
  it 's like i 'm infatuated . 
  it 's not perfect by any means , but i consider myself very lucky to live here . 
  yeah , i watch it on iplayer . 
  just selected programmes , mainly documentaries plus have i got news for you . 
   how do you watch it with a vpn . 
  i used to use [ get_iplayer ] ( https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer/wiki/documentation ) through a proxy server but it stopped working and i have n't looked into upgrading it . 
   how much does it cost ? 
  it does n't cost me anything because i have access to the vpn for work purposes . 
  if i did n't have it , i would use turbovpn on android and watch on a phone or tablet . 
  also free . 
  i 've never met a spaniard who had anything but contempt for the royals . 
  i think there 's a lot of support for queen elizabeth in the uk because she is personally a [ very ] ( https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/38621/queen_copy.jpg ) [ cool ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dmdsykgprdq/t9dpkvuykki/aaaaaaaaa0u/8ohzszfm9_s/s1600/hrh+the+queen+elizabeth+on+a+motorcycle+cropped.jpg ) [ person ] ( https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2012/5/30/1338389649914/princess-elizabeth-now-qu-008.jpg?w=620&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=b7600f7d11c42d8a8ac2f6d6607b17d1 ) and has been a great monarch . 
  i very much doubt the current uk support for the royals will outlive her by very long . 
  yeah , la marseillaise is the only anthem i 've heard which is actually a good song . 
  not language-based , but ... 
  i 'm somewhere in the middle of the political spectrum . 
  if i 'm to the right of someone on an issue , i 'm told i 'm heartless or selfish . 
  if i 'm to the left of someone on an issue , i 'm told i 'm ignorant , naive , or deluded ( this has happened on this very sub ) . 
  this seems to transcend national and linguistic borders , having happened in three countries in three languages . 
  you can watch [ bbc world online here ] ( http://www.giniko.com/watch.php?id=216 ) or [ here ] ( http://www.stream2watch.cc/live-television/united-kingdom/bbc-world-news-live-stream ) . 
  in the eu , only luxembourg and malta have a rate lower than 19 % ; the vast majority of countries charge more . 
  in hungary it 's 27 % !, 
  dunno why it 's called that , but it 's the tax on goods and services added at the point of sale . 
  yes . 
  the law says that if they have a well-founded fear of persecution due to their race , religion , nationality , political opinion or membership of a particular social group , then we have a duty to take them . 
  and i 'm happy with that law at the moment . 
  i rented a car in the canary islands and my gf got flashed by a speed camera . 
  i got the fine in the post to my uk address . 
   the funny thing is very few people use pounds as a weight measurement any more , so most customers have no idea what the burger is about . 
  they got the metric system there , they would n't know what the fuck a quarter pounder is . 
  salt and vinegar is the classic british accompaniment to chips . 
  really ? 
  that 's amazing . 
  there are definitely a lot of breaches of that going on then . 
  scotland = unicorn [ no shit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_symbols_of_scotland#flora_and_fauna ) . 
  yeah , bull for spain . 
  donkey for cataluyna . 
  my experience was that i would email the owner or agency , and they would reply telling you to call on the phone . 
  when they heard my accent they would then say the flat was already rented . 
  in one case i asked a catalan friend to call immediately after ( to check my suspicion that it was down to me being foreign ) , and she was offered an opportunity to view the flat . 
  it 's tricky to prove , but more than one friend here has been told straight out by an agency that the owner would n't rent them the flat `` because he/she does n't rent to foreigners '' . 
   common or not ? 
  very common , but * much * more common to see young women here in barcelona wearing little or no make up at all than it is in the uk , where i think it 's more culturally `` required '' . 
   what age do you see women with makeup mid to late teens here , earlier in the uk . 
   are women as obsessed with it as it is here in north america ? 
  dunno about north america . 
  they do n't seem obsessed with it to me , so i guess not . 
   do you like it ? 
  there 's a fashion here at the moment for very bold red lipstick , which i personally do n't think looks attractive , but that 's fashion ; i 'm sure it looks great to them and their peers . 
  whatever floats their boat really , but would n't encourage my partner to wear heavy makeup . 
  here 's some information on [ eu anti-discrimination law ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/justice/discrimination/files/present_a_discrimination_claim_handbook_en.pdf ) . 
  from the pdf :  an applicant for a property rental with an immigrant background suspected that he was the target of discrimination . 
  two swedish friends agreed to apply to the estate agency for apartments as well . 
  they were both given a chance to see the apartment while their immigrant friend was not . 
  although this test was not decisive , it did help to prove the overall case . 
  the case was decided in favour of the plaintiff and damages were awarded ( gothenburg district court , judgment t13077-05 of 06.11.2007 ) . 
  plaintiff [ in that case ] ( http://www.do.se/globalassets/diskrimineringsarenden/hovratt/dom-hovratt-hyresvard-omed2006-331.pdf ) got $ 4000 . 
  the way it 's going , maybe not for long . 
  in the eu it 's illegal to discriminate against people on the basis of their nationality , if that nationality is another eu country . 
  you can legally refuse to rent to people from turkey ( for example ) , but not from an eu country . 
  you will sometimes see adverts here that specify `` eu nationals only '' because the agents are aware of the law . 
  i 've been refused the opportunity to rent flats because i am foreign , ( as have several of my friends ) . 
  this is illegal if those foreigners are eu citizens , as we happen to be . 
  but who 's got the time to pursue it in court ? 
  we just move on to the next . 
  yeah , but your work partners are probably a lot more worldly-wise than a bk employee , and think a lot faster on their feet . 
  i once had to resort to speaking in a ludicrous fake us accent in a pizza hut in la to order a coca-cola : the waitress simply could n't understand me after about six attempts . 
  i am british from london and speak with a standard english accent . 
  while i 'm here , i 'd like to remark on the * ludicrous number * of times i 've requested tobacco , filters , and cigarette papers in france , only to have the clerk not be able to understand my pronunciation of `` feuilles '' ( which i think is pretty close to native ) .
