  i mean , what the fuck ? 
  the guy wants tobacco , filters , and what ** in heaven ** can be that third mysterious thing ? 
  barcelona to tenerife south : 2312km $ 19.99 by ryanair, 
  barcelona : there are quite a lot of sikhs in the barrio where i live ( there is a gurudwara is 200m from my flat ) . 
  i 'd think someone who was recognisably sikh was a local ( or a tourist if he was doing something touristy ) . 
  however , a sikh student from the us came to barcelona and had [ this experience ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/barcelona/comments/40ivbf/as_a_sikh_study_abroad_student_in_bcn/ ) . 
  so the police apparently think that sikhs are muslims , and suspicious ones at that . 
   make them equal in everything [ ... ] just without the name `` marriage '' attached to it ) so , not equal then ? 
  that only requires a lack of clouds . 
  the crown estate [ does * not * belong to the monarch ] ( https://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/our-business/faqs/#whoownsthecrownestate ) or the royal family . 
  if the uk got rid of the monarchy , the current royals are not walking away with the crown estate . 
  even royal-sycophant magazine tatler [ do n't claim this ] ( http://www.tatler.com/news/articles/january-2014/the-monarch-and-her-money ) . 
  and there 's no mention of the money it costs the uk to keep the royals secure ( the royal protection squad costs # 100m a year alone ) . 
  the `` awesome uk castle '' he shows at 2:55 is mont sant michel . 
  in france . 
  `` boring and stinky '' versailles gets more tourists per year than all the uk castles and palaces put together . 
  france gets way more tourists than the uk , despite cutting off their royals ' heads 200 years ago . 
  he mentions in passing that george iii swapped the crown estate for ** paying off his debts ** and the civil list , then never mentions the debts again . 
  how much do you think hundreds of years of interest on that debt is worth ? 
  [ edit : there may well be legitimate reasons for wanting or not wanting the uk to be a monarchy , but to be frank , the reasons in that video are bullshit . ], 
   they lease land to the government for much less than it 's worth , essentially in exchange for the throne . 
  nope . 
  george iii exchanged the crown estate for parliament ** paying off his debts ** and ( much less significantly ) an income in the form of the civil list . 
   if you remove the throne it 'd be a legal mess and no one really knows what 'd happen , but they 'd certainly have claim for all that land even royal-sycophant magazine [ tatler ] ( http://www.tatler.com/news/articles/january-2014/the-monarch-and-her-money ) do n't claim this . 
  that land belongs to the country , not to the royal family . 
   damn your ~ ~ convincing ~ ~ manipulative and completely factually incorrect youtube videos . 
  ftfy, 
   palaces are private properties . 
  in the uk , only sandringham and balmoral are privately owned by the queen . 
  the others are all * crown * property , and thus are not the monarch 's private property . 
  also , the `` awesome uk castle '' shown is mont sant michel in france . 
  and in reality `` boring stinky '' versailles gets more visitors than all of the uk 's castles and palaces put together , and france gets ** way ** more tourists than the uk . 
  and not a * mention * of the # 100m + per year royal security bill ( that 's the royal protection squad alone ) . 
  the whole video is tosh , start to finish . 
  that or he 's found some . 
  `` think of how stupid the average person is , and realize half of them are stupider than that '' george carlin, 
  and the blair government expected 5,000 to 13,000 net immigrants per year , and that was wrong by an order of magnitude . 
  [ edit : [ source ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/mar/24/how-immigration-came-to-haunt-labour-inside-story ) ], 
  never heard of it either , but sounds interesting . 
  i 'll give it a go . 
  thanks !, 
  barcelona : * `` dollar stores '' / homeware : overwhelmingly chinese run , to the extent that these shops are called `` chinos '' * convenience stores : pakistani , to the extent that these shops are called `` pakis '' ( this makes a brit cringe , and i ca n't bring myself to say it ) . 
  * independent mobile phone shops : pakistani * building labourers : disproportionately latin americans * pubs in the city center : irish and british run chinese people run lots of small and/or unfashionable caf\u00e9 / bars ( selling local food , not chinese food ) . 
  they 're generally quite a lot cheaper than locally-run places . 
  the proportion of these is increasing , because ( as a friend in the trade tells me ) , once the chinese buy a bar , they will never sell it . 
  and they are always looking for bars to buy . 
  in actual paper cash . 
  small businesses ( or big businesses come to that ) are n't easy to run here because of bureaucracy and complicated taxes . 
  i think it would be a big boost to the economy if it were less complicated , like it is in the uk . 
  give it time . 
  all the romanians i know are awesome . 
  before i knew any i guess i just thought of gypsies or vampires . 
  [ ignore flair , i 'm originally british ] * paternal grandfather : no , was in a reserved occupation ( toolmaker ) so did n't fight . 
  * paternal grandmother : worked in aircraft factory . 
  * maternal great-grandmother : did n't fight ( obviously ) , but got bombed out twice ( east end of london ) . 
  * maternal grandmother : [ land girl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/women%27s_land_army ) , and it was the first time she left london . 
  she had a lot of funny stories . 
  * maternal grandfather : volunteered for royal air force , became an aircraft engineer , mainly in north africa . 
  it changed his life from butcher 's delivery boy to skilled engineer , and he worked in aerospace until retirement , so he did pretty well out of the war . 
   do they talk about it often according to my mother , my grandfather had some nasty experiences , but he would n't talk about them . 
  he only ever mentioned the war in my presence with funny stories . 
  one that comes to mind is when they were stationed at a desert airfield and one night he and a few friends got drunk on home-made booze . 
  in the morning , they woke up to find the camp empty . 
  during the night the alarm must have sounded and the airfield had been evacuated . 
  this would mean german armour was coming . 
  but they had slept through it in a drunken stupor . 
  so they 're stuck in the desert with no transport , and no idea where to go , waiting for rommel to arrive . 
  eventually a plume of dust shows that there are vehicles approaching , so they hide in the camp , assuming it 's the germans . 
  in fact , it 's the british returning to the camp . 
  it had been a false alarm . 
  when the rest of the unit get back to the camp , they sneak out of their hiding places , and nobody noticed they had missed the evacuation . 
  i 'm not for a moment going to claim it 's definitely a true story : my grandfather valued the quality of a story over its veracity . 
  in his later years , he and my grandmother joined a town-twinning association , and the twin town was wissen in germany . 
  they would go there every year and stay with a particular german couple of the same age , and the german couple would come and stay with them . 
  so there were no grudges or hard feelings against germany or the germans . 
  do you mean capote anglaise ? 
  i was told this came from a military overcoat . 
  so capote anglaise literally meant ` english overcoat ' . 
  is that wrong ? 
  you only need enough racists to tip the balance and you could then accurately say that `` trump won because of racism '' . 
  you do n't have to believe that half of america is racist . 
  no , i 'm 100 % sure you 're right . 
  it would surely be protected under the first amendment . 
  i remember the french presidential debates between hollande and sarkozy and they both said they would ban the niqab , and that neither would privatise any more nationalised assets , and i thought `` it would be the other way round in the uk !, 
  the ban was upheld in the echr [ not on the basis of public security ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/01/france-burqa-ban-upheld-human-rights-court ) , but on the basis that the government had a right to preserve the french ideal of `` living together '' . 
   the european judges decided otherwise , declaring that the preservation of a certain idea of `` living together '' was the `` legitimate aim '' of the french authorities . 
  the 2010 ban on the niqab and burka was ruled constitutional ( and survived a challenge in the european court of human rights ) . 
  so maybe not . 
  in other words , why is fn popular ( but do n't mention the elephant in the room ) ? 
  * many working-class people in france are suffering the effects of de-industrialisation , and feel that their country is losing its identity due to immigration . 
  * fn has simple answers to these problems : isolationism , protectionism , nationalism . 
  * the demographic is slanted towards those who are lower paid , less educated and from ` small town ' and rural france . 
  * not all fn supporters are racist , all the racists support fn , and there are easily enough of those to make a big difference . 
   because it 's further integration that is bringing out euroscepticism across europe . 
  yeah , small minded nationalism , like he said . 
  yeah , absurd is n't really the right word , more like odd , strange , unusual ... 4th july/5th november/14 juillet are nothing like a correfoc , and beer festivals are obvious , onion/leek festivals are n't . 
  i 'm a casteller , and i can guarantee that the authorities would n't let that happen in the uk without so much safety equipment it would n't be fun any more . 
  anyway , they 're all great traditions and i love them !, 
   ca n't think of any more though atm !, 
  some awesome and perhaps absurd to foreigners things catalans do : * [ correfocs ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=correfoc&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjnr67g9axtahvechokhzshch0q_auibigb&amp;biw=1549&amp;bih=898 ) ( basically people throwing fireworks ) * [ caganers ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=correfoc&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjnr67g9axtahvechokhzshch0q_auibigb&amp;biw=1549&amp;bih=898#safe=off&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=caganer ) ( christmas figures of people taking a shit ) * [ castellers ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=correfoc&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjnr67g9axtahvechokhzshch0q_auibigb&amp;biw=1549&amp;bih=898#safe=off&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=castellers ) ( people arranging themselves into towers ) * [ cal\u00e7otadas ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=correfoc&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjnr67g9axtahvechokhzshch0q_auibigb&amp;biw=1549&amp;bih=898#safe=off&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=cal%c3%a7otada ) ( eat a load of grilled onion/leek things ) my mother point-blank refused to take a caga ti\u00f3 back the the uk for my nephews because of the `` poops presents '' thing !,
