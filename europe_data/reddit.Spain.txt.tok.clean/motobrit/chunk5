  there was a tv series in the uk about ten years ago where absurd uk tv chef jamie oliver went to italy in a vw van and drove around cooking regional specialities in market squares and plazas . 
  of course , he has to `` put a twist '' on everything by changing all the recipes , then gets very upset when absolutely all the italians tell him that it 's wrong and no good . 
  it was unintentionally hilarious . 
  i should have mentioned that i 'm originally british , despite the flair ( immigrant to spain ) . 
  you ca n't get a `` decent '' cup of tea in spain either . 
  tea is just different in britain and ireland . 
  if you buy tetley or liptons in the us , it 's just a totally different product to what the same companies sell in the uk . 
  british tea is n't really a refined thing : it 's bloody strong ( irish probably more so ) . 
  everywhere else i 've tried it , it 's more like a subtle infusion than something that stains your spoons , cups and teeth . 
  it 's just what we 've been brought up with ; i expect everyone else would hate it . 
  but seriously , american food is great imo . 
  when i used to go quite frequently , my diet would go straight out of the window for the duration of my stay . 
  ordinary diners , good burger places , 1000-calorie salads , bltas ... mmmmm ... 
  obligatory `` you ca n't get a decent cup of tea in the us '' . 
  i do n't like hershey 's chocolate , and once had a terrible curry in san francisco but other than that i 've been pretty damn happy with all the food i 've had in america . 
   why do you need to have an opinion on something you know nothing about ? 
  what does that do for you ? 
  ** you ** brought it up . 
  i have never said that obamacare was good , or was succeeding . 
  you seem to be trying to prove that i know nothing of us politics . 
  you 're wrong . 
  for example , i ( and i expect most people here ) know that trump failed to replace it the other week , even though the gop have control of both houses . 
  what do you know of recent european political events ? 
  i 'd imagine ** much ** less than we know about us politics , which was my point . 
  yep , healthcare is fundamentally broken in the us . 
  everybody knows that !, 
   take obamacare for example . 
  eurofags have no fucking idea what obamacare entails apart from the simplest , simplest selling points , like number of people `` with health insurance . '', 
  a lot of us know a fair bit about it , having followed it from the beginning , and still following it now . 
  and we know that it 's shit because the senate was going to filibuster any sensible system ( like we have in every country in europe ) . 
  well , yeah . 
  that 's what i meant !, 
   gymnasiums / offtopic i once read a popular maths book , and it was talking about two european mathematicians ( let 's say leibniz and euler , though it was n't ) . 
  it said something along the lines of `` and they also liked to take care of their bodies , having both been regulars at the same gymnasium '' . 
  i strongly suspect they in fact went to the same school . 
  ( on the original question i 've no idea : too old and no kids ) . 
   as an american it always amazes how far-right europeans think trump and `` trumpettes '' are . 
  over here -- at least in `` western '' europe -- opinions like these are far-right : * pro death penalty * pro torture * anti abortion * anti public healthcare i would say that we would be judging `` far-right '' by our own standards , not by us standards . 
   nothing against europeans , as you ca n't get a true feel of the politics in america ( they are very complicated ) i think you underestimate how much exposure to us politics ( and interest in us politics ) we have in europe . 
  as an example , i came to the us in 2008 specifically to be there for the election . 
  a lot of us are awake and following the election on election nights . 
  it seems to me that a lot of americans think that europe is socialist , but in reality there are very few countries in europe where the ( local ) left-wing is in power . 
  france ( for only the second time since wwii ) , portugal , greece , um ... any help here fellow eurofags ? 
  and do many americans stay up to follow the elections in the uk , france , germany , etc ? 
  i doubt it , on the basis that even my most psephologically-minded american friends do n't ( to be fair , that might be because they do n't get much time off work ) . 
  my adopted country , spain has quite complicated rules which i think are a little unfair . 
  if you are spanish by origin , you are allowed to take citizenship of another country and keep your spanish citizenship . 
  if you are not spanish , on taking spanish citizenship , you must renounce your other citizenship ( s ) , unless it is from an iberoamerican country , andorra , the philippines , equatorial guinea or portugal . 
  i do n't have a problem with people who choose to have dual citizenship , but i do think the rules in spain should be `` allow it '' or `` do n't allow it '' . 
  it existed in [ catalunya too until 2002 ] ( http://www.lasdrogas.info/noticias/453/cataluna-eleva-hasta-los-18-anos-la-edad-minima-para-poder-comprar-alcohol.html ) . 
  i still see the occasional old sign in bars stating minimum age 16 for up to 23 % , 18 for over 23 % alcohol . 
  ok , thanks . 
  i 've heard `` comer de co\u00f1a '' but did n't know it was n't standard usage . 
  and the ` etc ' bit really meant `` i have run out of examples '' . 
  [ well , it 's not only me . 
  ] ( https://www.google.es/search?safe=off&amp;q=%22pasado%20de%20co%c3%b1a%22&amp;*&amp;rct=j ) [ i 'm not a native speaker though . 
  my go-to adjective was ` tramb\u00f3lico ' until i found out it 's not a word ! ], 
  but pasarselo de co\u00f1a , comer de co\u00f1a , etc. . . 
   or sexism how esposa means both wife and handcuffs in spanish . 
  my spanish teacher ( a philologist ) told me that the handcuffs meaning comes from the fact that the handcuffs are joined together in a pair ( they are ` spoused ' ) . 
  esposo means husband ( though it has fallen out of use in modern spanish ) . 
  had the word for handcuffs had a masculine gender ( and the vagaries of noun gender in latin languages mean that it very much could have ) , then the word for handcuffs would be the same as the word for husbands . 
  both come from the latin verb spond\u0113re , which means promise , * bind * or pledge . 
  we get a bunch of english words from this root , including spouse , respond , sponsor , etc. 
  [ mont saint michel ] ( http://www.francetourisme.fr/images/excursions/mont_saint_michel.jpg ) , normandie [ sagrada fam\u00edlia ] ( http://suitelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/sagrada1.jpg ) , barcelona ( especially [ the interior ] ( https://cdn.clorian.com/img/clients/sagradafamilia/galeria/2-big.jpg?v=20170330070550 ) ) . 
  i organise a eurovision party in a bar every year . 
  not many spanish or catalans come considering that we 're in barcelona : we get more foreigners than locals ( british , irish , french ) . 
  the spanish who come tend to take it a lot more seriously than the other nationalities ( who do n't take it seriously at all ) . 
  i still like it , but not as much as i used to now that there are so many serious entries ( i 'm thinking long-haired nordic wood nymphs wailing at a wind machine ) . 
  i preferred the old days when it was more camp and fun and there were more metallic mini-skirts and ludicrous shoes . 
  wow !, 
  a barcelona story that did n't involve anyone getting pickpocketed !, 
  ( to be honest , i 've only ever heard it used ironically or for comedic effect . ), 
  i wonder if it 's also due to the fact that muslim immigrants are pretty well integrated in spain , at least [ according to this ( old : 2011 ) government survey ] ( http://www.interior.gob.es/documents/642317/1201485/valores,%20actitudes+y+opiniones+de+los+inmigrantes+de+religi%c3%b3n+musulmana+\\ ( nipo +126 -11 -022 -1 \\ ) . pdf/0bf98a9b-bd 97-490f-8e53-0e6885a34e0a ) . 
  82 % of muslims in spain agree that `` the three great monotheistic religions ( judaism , christianity and islam ) are equally great and none can be considered superior to the others '' . 
  only 5 % disagree . 
  and only 14 % of muslims are opposed to inter-faith marriages . 
  it gets a mention [ in may 's a50 letter yesterday ] ( https://www.scribd.com/document/343396953/pm-letter-to-eu-council-president ) :  we should always put our citizens first . 
  there is obvious complexity in the discussions we are about to undertake but we should remember that at the heart of our talks are the interests of all our citizens . 
  there are , for example , many citizens of the remaining member states living in the united kingdom and uk citizens living elsewhere in the european union and we should aim to strike an early agreement about their rights . 
  [ this is the process currently ] ( https://www.gov.uk/eea-registration-certificate/overview ) . 
  personally , i 'd wait a bit and see what reciprocal deal the eu27 and the uk come up with , because it 's likely to be an easier process . 
  you can always start the registration later if there 's no deal ( unlikely ) . 
  i 'm a british immigrant to spain ( no spanish citizenship yet ) and i 'm not worrying yet . 
  the truth is that it 's a big priority for all the governments that existing immigrants ' rights are protected , they 're just not showing their hand at this point . 
  [ wearing brit hat ] it 's a bit of a worry for people who run one-person businesses though . 
  the weird thing is that both the people i know who have been called up have been called up more than once . 
  yes , but i live in a majority-immigrant area . 
  before i lived here i would make special trips to indian and chinese supermarkets for specific things , and get everything else at the ` normal ' supermarket . 
  * indian supermarket : spices ; rice ; dried nuts , fruits and beans ; tea . 
  * chinese supermarket : sriracha , ramen , sauces and ingredients for chinese cooking . 
  * meat : i either get from one of the many muslim butchers or from the ( single ) chinese-run butcher ( pork , especially of course ) . 
  * fruits and vegetables : pakistani-run independent fruteria . 
  * bread/pastries : pakistani-run independent bakery . 
  * lidl : cheese , yoghurt , milk , muesli , toiletries * beer : pakistani-run independent shop over the road . 
  * kabanosy from polish shop in another district whenever i 'm passing it . 
  & nbsp ; * `` normal '' supermarket : spanish stuff : fuet and similar sausages , wine , ham ; bacon , eggs , household products ( cleaning etc ) , toilet paper . 
  irrelevant . 
  the vast , vast majority of eu migrants to the uk are not muslims , and the majority of migrants to the uk are not from the eu . 
  if eu immigration to the uk stops or slows , non-eu immigration will end up increasing to even higher levels to make up some of the difference ( uk is approaching full employment , so needs immigrant workers ) .
