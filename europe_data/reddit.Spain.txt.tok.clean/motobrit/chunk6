  the result will be more muslim immigrants to the uk . 
  depends . 
  if they 've got a cogent argument ( democratic deficit , strong-arming poorer countries to follow certain policies , eu army ; anything that actually makes sense even if i do n't agree with the argument ) then i do n't look down on them at all . 
  if brits say something about '' [ straight bananas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrgmtdsj_tk ) '' , `` silly rules '' ( when they ca n't name a single one ) , or `` too many muslims '' , then yeah , i look down on them . 
  not * too * harshly though , because they 've been lied to about these kind of things by successive governments and most of the print media for decades . 
   did n't even question the government taking the country into iraq for example . 
  today programme ? 
  leading to the death of david kelly and the hutton enquiry ? 
  i 've got to admit that the bbc got spanked there ( even though we all know it 's true that campbell `` sexed up '' the dossier ) , and they 've been softer on the government since . 
  had central heating in two out of eight flats i 've lived in . 
  others were either air-conditioning with heat function or no heat or air at all . 
  no cable , no antenna in my flat . 
  i watch a couple of spanish shows on the official free streaming sites , torrent a few us series and watch bbc from the official through a uk vpn ( though i probably wo n't get away with it for much longer , so will torrent them ) . 
  i feel a bit guilty about it , but there you go . 
  if i watch football ( bar\u00e7a , world cup and euros ) i will go to a bar . 
  bear in mind that hostel prices vary enormously with season and what 's going on in the city . 
  they might charge $ 10 a night in january , but during summer it will be a lot more . 
  during events like primavera sound it could be over $ 100 a night . 
  so basically make sure you book ahead . 
  hostels generally have lockers for your luggage . 
  [ none ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_estonia ) . 
  i 's a shame i have only one upvote to give . 
  i 'd also add that many british people benefit from freedom of movement : 900,000 live in other european countries . 
  home distilling is illegal in the uk , but it goes on . 
  when i lived in the uk i had a home-made 5 litre reflux still . 
  most of the product was then flavoured with fruit . 
  i knew two other home-distillers too . 
  the risk is n't from the law , or from drinking the product , it 's having 5 litres of ethanol explode in your face . 
  illegal distilling is also [ done commercially ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-14151509 ) . 
  when i lived in normandie ( france ) , home distilling of calvados ( from cider ) was n't unheard of . 
   no one even suggested staying in the common market until after the result `` absolutely nobody is talking about threatening our place in the single market '' -- daniel hannan mep ( architect of brexit ) `` only a madman would actually leave the market '' -- owen paterson mp , vote leave backer `` would n't it be terrible if we were really like norway and switzerland ? 
  really ? 
  they 're rich . 
  they 're happy . 
  they 're self-governing '' -- nigel farage , ukip leader `` the norwegian option , the eea option , i think that it might be initally attractive for some business people '' -- matthew elliot , vote leave chief executive `` our trade will almost certainly continue with the eu on similar to current circumstances ... the reality is that the hard-headed , pragmatic businessmen on the continent will do everything to ensure that trade with britain continues uninterrupted . '' -- david davis , speech , 26 may 2016 `` the eu 's supporters say ` we must have access to the single market ' . 
  britain will have access to the single market after we vote leave '' -- vote leave , `` what happens when we vote leave ? '', 
  `` there will continue to be free trade , and access to the single market '' -- boris johnson , the telegraph , 26 june 2016 `` it should be win-win for us and it will be if we vote to leave and we can maintain free trade , stop sending money and also have control of our borders '' -- michael gove , bbc , 8 may 2016 `` the idea that our trade will suffer ... is silly '' -- vote leave , `` what happens when we vote leave '' [ copied this from a facebook post i made so there are no links , but they are easily googled ], 
  i do n't really think of americans as being stoners , but i do feel that those who * do * smoke really go in for the stoner `` lifestyle '' . 
  in spain i feel that most of those who smoke weed either just smoke now and then , or even if they 're daily smokers they do n't let it take over their lives . 
  for one thing , people here mix weed with tobacco , so smoking a joint is like drinking a couple of beers . 
  americans all seem to smoke weed on its own , so it 's more like drinking a litre of vodka . 
   what draws you to that conclusion ? 
  just prejudice , i guess . 
   hell , even if you want to skip the waits , private healthcare here is dirty cheap compared to the us and will let you get an appointment with an specialist within days ( depending on location ) . 
  yes , this is skipped over by the people who like to criticise `` socialised '' medicine by saying you have to wait for care . 
  if you 're that bothered about the quality of public healthcare or waiting times , you can pay for private healthcare at very cheap prices . 
  when i came to spain , i had to take out fully comprehensive health insurance with no co-pays ( because i did n't have a job contract ) . 
  i still have it , and it costs me $ 52 per month ( 45 year-old smoker ) . 
  what kind of insurance could you buy in the us for $ 55 per month ? 
  oh god . 
  i knew this video would pop up . 
  i know that cgp grey is a a massive uk/royal lover , but i 've never been able to work out whether he 's being deliberately manipulative or simply ignorant in this video . 
  the crown estate [ does * not * belong to the monarch ] ( https://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/our-business/faqs/#whoownsthecrownestate ) or the royal family . 
  if the uk got rid of the monarchy , the current royals are not walking away with the crown estate . 
  even royal-sycophant magazine tatler [ do n't claim this ] ( http://www.tatler.com/news/articles/january-2014/the-monarch-and-her-money ) . 
  and there 's no mention of the money it costs the uk to keep the royals secure ( the royal protection squad costs # 100m a year alone ) . 
  the `` awesome uk castle '' he shows at 2:55 is mont sant michel . 
  in france . 
  `` boring and stinky '' versailles gets more tourists per year than all the uk castles and palaces put together . 
  there may well be legitimate reasons for wanting or not wanting the uk to be a monarchy , but to be frank , the reasons in that video are bullshit . 
  it was big for a while here , now it 's really rare to see someone vaping . 
  i 've got friends here in barcelona working in tech ( startups ) and science ( biotech ) in english only . 
  so perhaps op should start looking here . 
  i ask native spanish speakers to correct my mistakes . 
  then i really quickly regret it . 
  satellite photography appears to confirm your view . 
   how am i supposed to even respond to this ? 
  i do n't know . 
  there 's a real sickness in the uk at the moment . 
  many people are willing to believe anything that reinforces their prejudices . 
  my mother recently told me that she voted for brexit because the `` nhs ca n't cope with all the immigrants '' . 
  my opinions on the nhs are : * the nhs would be horribly understaffed without all the immigrant doctors , nurses , auxiliaries and cleaners . 
  * the uk government are currently * reducing * healthcare provision , services and hospital beds . 
  i believe this is because they are deliberately engineering a crisis so they can tell us that they `` have to '' privatise the nhs . 
  * spend any time in an nhs hospital and you will immediately see that the vast majority of patients are very old british people , not young healthy poles . 
  * france takes way more immigrants and refugees than the uk and their health service is not in crisis . 
  add to that : * i 'm living in spain as an eu immigrant ( along with a huge number of other brits ) , so her wish to leave the eu will make things difficult for her own flesh and blood . 
  * one of my parents ' best friends is polish ( but has lived in the uk for 30 + years , so perhaps he does n't count ) . 
  * more uk immigrants come from outside the eu than inside . 
  and this is from a basically sweet little old lady . 
  britain :  how accepting is your government of either immigrants or migrants ? 
  not accepting at all . 
  the uk is currently in the process of committing pretty serious economic self-harm in order to stop eu immigrants coming into the country . 
  before the brexit vote , it was all about `` taking back control '' , `` sovereignty '' , etc. 
  but since the referendum the focus has been almost exclusively on immigrantion . 
  illegal immigrants are imprisoned and deported when found . 
  most immigrants to the uk in recent years are non-eu immigrants . 
   but just in general , how easy is it to get citizenship in your country ? 
  once you 're in , pretty easy . 
  basically live legally in the uk for five years , apply and take a citizenship test . 
  it 's difficult to get in though , unless you have family already in the country ( the usual route for non-eu immigrants ) . 
  spain : much easier to get a work visa than uk . 
  have to wait 10 years for citizenship . 
  no plans to leave schengen area . 
  illegal immigrants largely tolerated . 
  do n't forget the [ norman cathedrals in the north ] ( http://www.thehistoryhub.com/rouen-cathedral-facts-pictures.htm ) . 
   revolver only [ black powder muzzle-loaded handguns are permitted in the uk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/firearms_policy_in_the_united_kingdom#pistols ) . 
   you can sell alcohol in bars , caf\u00e9s , restaurants , supermarkets , dollar shops , at any time the shop is open . 
  the laws can be more restrictive locally . 
  in barcelona you ca n't buy alcohol after 11pm in shops .
