  there are plenty of illegal beer-sellers in the streets in the city centre who will sell beer at any time to anyone , so that 's kinda counter-productive . 
  the police crack down on them from time to time . 
  a very respectable-looking 40 + year old friend of mine was on his way to a house party with a bag full of beer during a crackdown and the police seized the beer on the basis that he had bought it from a * latero * , even though he had a receipt in the bag showing he had bought it earlier in the day . 
  drinking in the streets here is technically illegal but not enforced unless you are causing trouble . 
  botellones/street drinking seems to be tolerated on the beach and in a few public squares ( i pity the people who live on those squares ) . 
  happy hours are [ restricted ] ( http://www.barcelona-metropolitan.com/eating-and-drinking/bye-bye-happy-hour/ ) , but enforcement is non-existent as far as i know . 
  organised bar-crawls ( aimed at tourists ) are also banned , but still happen . 
  central barcelona is pretty clean , but only due to the insane amount of work the ajuntamento put into cleaning the streets all day and all night . 
  having said that , people round here are pretty good at picking up their dogs ' shit , unlike in france ( lyon , at least ) . 
  they use the subjunctive everywhere the french do , and also about 10 other ( sometimes baffling ) situations . 
  i once did a test where i had to choose whether the verb should be indicative or subjunctive and i got less than 50 % right . 
  i would have done better tossing a coin . 
  and this was after studying it for a while !, 
  yeah , when i lived in france and had language exchange partners , without exception their goal was always to `` lose their french accent '' . 
  i personally do n't think that 's really a goal worth putting a lot of effort into . 
  an accent is fine as long as you are pronouncing the words correctly ( no , you ca n't say `` s ` ree '' for `` three '' ) . 
  i love accents ( especially french accents ) , as long as the speaker is intelligible . 
  not a single spanish person has ever told me they wanted to lose their spanish accent , and i 've had more spanish language exchange partners . 
  seems to be a french thing . 
  [ i 'm a native english speaker from england . 
  sorry for confusing flair ], 
  dude , try learning spanish for some * real * subjunctive pain . 
  i had a lot of trouble with the different ` u ' sounds . 
  like dessous and dessus have opposite meanings but they sounded exactly the same to me when i was learning . 
  i guess the equivalent would be when french people have trouble distinguishing between ` sheet ' and ` shit ' . 
  [ i 'm a native english speaker despite the flair ], 
  just gon na chime in on not trying to `` do it all '' . 
  i meet quite a few americans , australians , new zealanders here in barcelona who have been running round the european hotspots like blue-arsed flies and they 're exhausted and skint . 
  skint because they 've only had time to visit the super-touristy areas where everything is really expensive . 
  2,4,6 : i would n't worry about it . 
  you 'll be fine . 
  5 : varies depending on distance , demand , etc. 
  there 's no general rule . 
  7 : go in summer . 
  so i 'd advise you to pick where you really want to go and stick to those at first . 
  also , probably no need to plan it down to the day ( or even week ) . 
  suck it and see , see if you meet other people , see if you like the places you go . 
  finally , take care of your belongings . 
  in touristy areas of rome , barcelona , prague , london , paris , amsterdam and doubtless elsewhere there are extremely skilled pickpockets and scammers that non-locals do n't seem to be prepared for . 
  you 're very unlikely to get hurt , but extremely likely to have your stuff stolen without you realising if you make it at all easy ( like keeping things in your back pocket ) . 
  leave your passport at the hotel . 
  any ` friendly local ' in a touristy area is likely to be trying to steal from you . 
  finally , finally ; have fun !, 
  but would n't this be the same in finland ? 
  lots of restaurants and small shops in spain do n't accept cards . 
  most others have a limit ( cards only accepted for purchases over $ 10 , for example ) . 
  this is probably because the national sport here is tax evasion . 
   i agree that article 10 of the echr does indeed give everyone the freedom to burn flags it does n't , because section 2 of article 10 allows member states to take away pretty much every freedom :  the exercise of these freedoms , since it carries with it duties and responsibilities , may be subject to such formalities , conditions , restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society , in the interests of national security , territorial integrity or public safety , for the prevention of disorder or crime , for the protection of health or morals , for the protection of the reputation or rights of others , for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence , or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary . 
  quite a few eu countries have [ laws against flag-burning ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_desecration ) . 
  the uk does n't . 
  op : this question was asked [ 2 months ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5fjbpa/does_eu_law_protect_citizens_who_want_to_burn/ ) . 
  [ yes , in some circumstances ] ( http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ecintheuk/bananas-and-brussels/ ) . 
  [ more myths and facts here ] ( http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ecintheuk/euromyths-a-z-index/ ), 
  best i can do is : * wild boar ( normandy ) * golden eagle ( scotland ) * hoopoe ( normandy , remarkable for the area ) * black guillemot ( brighton , remarkable for the area ) * peregrine falcons ( brighton ; sagrada fam\u00edlia , barcelona ) i 'd be over the moon to see lynx tracks anywhere !, 
  another left-libertarian here . 
   in my point of view , the question if it 's `` allowed '' to form an independent country has to be seen based on the spanish constitution , which i never read . 
  section 2 of the spanish constitution says :  the constitution is based on the indissoluble unity of the spanish nation , the common and indivisible homeland of all spaniards ; it recognizes and guarantees the right to self-government of the nationalities and regions of which it is composed and the solidarity among them all . 
  so catalan independence is not compatible with this ( like it or not ) . 
  constitutions can and should be amended when necessary though . 
  you 've got to remember that the constitution was written in 1978 , immediately after decades of dictatorship , and things are different now . 
  i 've completely changed my mind on scottish independence since the general election and the eu referendum . 
  i should point out that i always thought that scotland had the * right * to be independent . 
  at the time of the independence referendum , i hoped that scotland would vote to stay in the union for totally selfish reasons : in the past , scottish labour mps helped keep the tories out of power in the uk . 
  i also thought it would be in scotland 's best interests so it could stay in the eu . 
  now labour have been wiped out in scotland , and scotland is leaving the eu whether they like it or not , i 've no objection to them leaving the union , and i think that in the long term they would be better off for two reasons : 1 . 
  the tories never really cared about scotland , and they care even less now . 
  scotland can start the process to rejoin the eu on the day they get independence . 
  i 'd really like to see a super-majority though . 
  having seen what a close referendum vote has done in the uk , i would n't want to see that repeated . 
  [ i 'm originally british , from london ], 
  yeah , but i think this is a * `` conservative '' * thing . 
  they have this idea that everything used to be better in the ( unspecified ) past , and that we have to go back to that past . 
  `` progressives '' have the idea that the future can be better than the past . 
  look for vose : stands for versi\u00f3n original subtitulado en espa\u00f1ol . 
  otherwise it 'll be dubbed . 
  no , sadly . 
  i 've never seen them here except at our ( local ) `` oktoberfest '' . 
   there was tons of xenophobia in it . 
  most of the leave campaign 's material was about foreigners and refugees . 
  yeaaah ... not really . 
  i think you 're right that the vote was down to xenophobia , but i do n't agree that the leave campaign 's material was mostly about foreigners or refugees . 
  the official leave campaign did n't focus on immigration * at all * . 
  in fact , boris was promising right up until after the vote that freedom of movement would remain . 
  the rhetoric was all about `` taking back control '' , '' # 350m a week to spend on the nhs '' , `` not having to follow stupid eu rules '' . 
  the ukip ` leave.eu ' campaign only briefly focussed on immigration with [ this famous poster ] ( http://home.bt.com/images/nigel-farage-accused-of-xenophobic-fear-tactics-over-disgusting-brexit-poster-136406830219703901-160616153009.jpg ) . 
  and of course , those people in the picture are syrian , and they 're not entering the uk , because we * already * had control of our borders . 
  so ukip quietly dropped it . 
  this does n't mean that individuals did n't vote brexit for racist/xenophobic reasons though . 
  any brexiters that i debated with all started off on ( spurious ) non-xenophobic arguments , but i could always get them to admit in the end that it was basically a dislike of foreigners . 
  so it would go something like : b : `` eu is not democratic '' me : the council is appointed by elected representatives . 
  we directly elect members of the parliament . 
  yet in the uk , we have bishops in the house of lords , and do n't elect our prime minister . 
  there 's a democratic deficit in the eu , but it 's not as bad as the one in the uk . 
  b : `` we have to follow lots of stupid eu laws '' me : can you name a single one ? 
  b : ... something ridiculous about bananas , or total silence . 
  b : blah blah eu human rights legislation me : can you name one human right the eu guarantees which you want to lose ? 
  b : the nhs ca n't cope with all the immigrants me : the nhs has * many * immigrant workers , from consultants to nurses to cleaners . 
  eu immigrants are not eligible for nhs treatment until they start working . 
  eu immigrants are generally young and in good health . 
  the pressure on the nhs is down to the government deliberately engineering a crisis by under-funding it , and the increasing number of old people .
