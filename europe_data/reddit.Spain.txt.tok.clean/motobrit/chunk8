  b : they come over here and get free houses . 
  me : they 're not eligible for any benefits until they find work , and have to find work in three months . 
  and nobody gets free houses anyway . 
  b : they take our jobs . 
  me : the uk is approaching full employment . 
  have you or has anyone you know lost a job to an eu immigrant ? 
  b : you hear nothing but polish spoken in the street . 
  products in supermarkets have polish labelling as well as english . 
  me : aaaand there we go . 
  something which really does n't affect you one bit is the ultimate reason for voting for something that will massively damage the uk economy . 
  and i 'm sure there will be people here who do n't agree with my characterisation , but they * have * to agree that xenophobes ` carried ' the vote . 
  if only one in 50 brexit voters was motivated by a dislike of foreigners , ( and it was a lot more than that ) that was enough to change the outcome from ` remain ' to ` leave ' . 
  yeah , my experience is that about three years ago it seemed like every third shop in barcelona was an e-cig shop , all selling those e-go type e-cigs ( which were pretty shit really ) . 
  they 've almost all gone now . 
  there are only a few e-cig shops in the whole city now , and they 're focussing on selling mods , not e-go types . 
  at the time , vaping was really popular . 
  i 'd estimate that 50 % of smokers in my ` local ' bar were using them . 
  this bar allows people to vape inside , btw . 
  then there were some articles in the press saying that they were ` just as bad for you as cigarettes ' ( bullshit of course ) . 
  so with that , and the poor quality of the e-cigs of the time , everybody in my bar stopped using them and went back to cigarettes . 
  i 've got a decent mod-type e-cig which i use during the day , but generally smoke ordinary cigarettes when i 'm out in the evenings . 
  do n't get me wrong : i 'm in support of capitalism : i think it 's the only viable way to drive the kind of economy we all want and need . 
  but it ca n't provide everything a society needs : we have to use capitalism instead of letting it use us . 
  church tax looks interesting . 
  i will look into it when i have a bit of time . 
  thanks . 
  / shrugs i 'm against forced privatisation of public utilities , i 'm against bailing out the banks instead of supporting greece writing off their debts , i 'm in support of freedom of marriage , i 'm pro-europe , not pro-europe-as-many-client-states-of-germany ... merkel is * way * to the right of me , both socially and economically . 
  not that it matters in this context . 
  i 'd be happy with a leader like her in spain , even though my personal political convictions are very different to hers . 
  she seems to have done very well in positioning germany as the natural leader of the eu . 
  before the refugee crisis , i thought she was just a great technocrat , but her response to the crisis showed that she is willing to risk sacrificing her popularity for her principles . 
  this shows a rare strength of character for a politician . 
  i 'm not sure i agree with her policy on refugees , but i admire her for making her case and for changing the opinions of many sceptics on a very emotive issue . 
  the little englanders/island monkeys in the uk absolutely hate her , which is another plus point for me . 
  i 'm pretty sure that half the questions asked on here are to troll one of us saying something that they can post on that sub . 
  having lived and run businesses in the uk , france and spain , i 'd rate them on a scale from 1 - 10 in terms of difficulty of navigating the bureaucracy : uk : 1 france : 8 spain : 10, 
  british lack of bureaucracy , simple taxes . 
  they can keep absolutely everything else . 
   2nd time he was over 2g/l http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/c6/c6e184c37df932d599fc1db174c7c7b2c8caf5400bc6b13d6865c1393f7b3122.jpg, 
  that all brits have bad teeth . 
  i mean , ** i ** have bad teeth , but by no means do all brits . 
  / pls ignore flair . 
  teeth not spanish yet . 
   where are you ? 
  spain . 
   and what 's your plan ? 
  if they tell me i have to leave , i wo n't : i 'll just stay illegally . 
  there are many illegal immigrants in spain . 
  it 'll save me paying taxes ( which i currently happily pay ) . 
  also , i 'm not adverse to the idea of a spanish wife . 
  looks really pretty , and the slovenians i know are all cool people , but i do n't know much about it . 
  i looked at going to ljublijana for a weekend in the summer but flights from barcelona were expensive and not direct . 
  us corporate culture is toxic too , and i think this is due in some part to at-will employment . 
  i * dread * working on projects with american corporate clients . 
  they will : * drag every project out to 2 - 5 times the duration a uk client would take * cc 10 or 20 people into every email discussion , even if no action is required from 19 of those people * schedule conference calls with 5 , 10 , 15 people , where the issues could be dealt with by a few emails between two people * deliberately send emails late at night and sundays to show everyone how hard they work * sabotage each other 's work and undermine each other ; finger-pointing and publicly calling people out for making what they see as errors * try to be the ` gatekeeper ' of information , and try to make everything rely on their input instead of allowing the most suitable person to take responsibility basically , it seem to me that they have a deep need to show how important they are in a project , and they always want to make project drag on and on . 
  and i think this is to reduce the probability of them suddenly being `` let go '' . 
  which is my final complaint about working with us corps : half the time , the person you are working with will have suddenly been `` let go '' and you have to start again with a new employee . 
  i do n't really have the power to set prices for projects , but if i did , i would charge us corps at least double the price for uk corps , because it always takes us at least twice the work to achieve the same result . 
  i do n't have these issues with individual american clients , so it 's not an innately ` american ' thing . 
  i 'm going to weigh in on mosley , because despite my flair , i 'm british and i 'll defer to the real spanish here on franco . 
  mosley is seen in the uk as something between a buffoon and a traitor . 
  comic writer pg wodehouse mocks mosley in the code of the woosters ( as `` roderick spode '' , leader of the black shorts ) , and that pretty much sums up what people in the uk think about mosley , post wwii :  the trouble with you , spode , is that just because you have succeeded in inducing a handful of half-wits to disfigure the london scene by going about in black shorts , you think you 're someone . 
  you hear them shouting `` heil , spode ! '', 
  and you imagine it is the voice of the people . 
  that is where you make your bloomer [ mistake ] . 
  what the voice of the people is saying is : `` look at that frightful ass spode swanking about in footer bags [ football shorts ] !, 
  did you ever in your puff [ life ] see such a perfect perisher [ idiot ] ? '', 
  [ translations provided for those who do n't speak 1930s upper-class english slang ] ironically , wodehouse was later imprisoned by the nazis and forced to make propaganda broadcasts , and his reputation was destroyed ( unfairly imo ) in the uk . 
  wodehouse was ahead of his time in mocking the fascists , as fascism in the uk was pretty popular before the breakout of wwii . 
  both the [ daily mail ] ( https://offgraun.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/hurrah-for-the-blackshirts.jpg ) and the [ daily mirror ] ( http://www.atangledweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/daily-mirror-give-the-blackshirts-a-helping-hand.jpg ) ( very popular uk newspapers at the time ) published articles in support of the blackshirts ( admittedly , both were written by the same guy ) . 
  king edward viii supported the fascists , and [ here he is teaching the current queen to do a nazi salute ] ( https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/07/19/12/queen-nazi-salute-getty.jpg ) . 
  with the outbreak of wwii , the buf ( british union of fascists ) lost pretty much all public support , was banned , and prominent fascists including mosley were interned ( imprisoned without trial ) . 
  so really , i would say that wwii took the wind out of the sails of british fascism . 
  having said that , neo-nazis and crypto-nazis have a lot ** more ** support in the uk ( though it 's still very fringe , and restricted pretty much exclusively to the uneducated ) than in spain . 
  maybe this is because the uk did n't live under the boot of fascism . 
  and i would argue that changing the succession to avoid a catholic monarch was anti-monarchist . 
  i also think parliament should n't have changed the law on primogeniture recently . 
  if we ca n't trust god to choose the monarch completely correctly , we should n't him to do it at all . 
  and if we do n't trust him to do it , we should do it democratically . 
   you ca n't choose your monarch , it kind of defeats the point . 
  thank you !, 
  if anyone ever thinks to themselves `` we should skip charles and go straight to william '' * they are not a monarchist * . 
   i simply ca n't trust that video as an unbiased source as he is clearly hugely anti-monarchy cgp grey is clearly hugely pro-monarchy . 
  the facts remain that the crown estate is not the queens property , and one single french palace ( versailles ) gets more visitors than all the uk 's castles and palaces put together . 
  this video is total bullshit . 
  the monarch ** does n't ** own the crown estate . 
  the ` awesome ' uk castle shown is mont sant michel in france . 
  the palace of versailles gets more visitors than all the uk 's castles and palaces put together . 
  cgp grey has a hardon for the royal family and the chocolate-box view of the uk , so he distorts the facts to fit his agenda . 
  no , because it 's a slippery slope . 
  before long it will just be undeniable evidence or a confession . 
  far simpler just not to have state sanctioned murder . 
  it does n't work as a deterrent , some criminals * want * it ( timothy mcveigh , quite likely dylan roof , islamic terrorists ) , it does n't `` undo '' their crimes . 
  it just makes society more brutal for no gain except giving a feeling of vengeance . 
  and vengeance is not justice . 
  if someone is wrongly imprisoned and found to be innocent ( which happens all the time ) , they can be released . 
  not so if you 've murdered them . 
  i do n't see * that * much . 
  it 's the biggest story in europe at the moment ( europe as a political , rather than geographic entity ) , so it 's likely to come up frequently . 
  even if i was bored by it , i would just have to accept that it 's not going to stop for a long time .
