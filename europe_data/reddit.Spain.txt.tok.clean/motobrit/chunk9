  also , english people think that germany are their deadly rivals at football . 
  germany 's real football rivals are holland , and they do n't really care about the england team . 
   you 've obviously never had a british education if you think we do n't predominantly use metric . 
  i ** had ** a british education ( i did n't leave the uk until i was 38 ) . 
  i ** do n't ** think britain does n't predominantly use metric . 
  i 'm just annoyed that the bbc have chosen to use imperial units in a * science * program , irrespective of the age of the presenter . 
  and i still suspect this is to make it easier to sell to the us . 
  maybe , but i find it difficult to believe , because attenborough also used fahrenheit for temperature , and even my 70 + year old parents gave that up for celsius 20 years ago . 
  it 's time to let imperial go in the uk . 
  education has been in metric for * 45 years * now . 
  btw , i 'm british despite my flair : username checks out . 
  good for them . 
  i was recently watching the ( excellent ) bbc `` planet earth ii '' series , and had a minor fit every time the commentary used imperial units ( feet , inches , pounds ) . 
  i can only assume they did this to make the series easier to sell in the us . 
  barcelona : pretty much only tourists drink ` pints ' ( 0.5 l ) . 
  $ 4 - $ 5 in the city centre , cheaper outside . 
  my usual bar sells ca\u00f1as ( 0.33 l ) for $ 2 , and ` pints ' ( 0.5 l ) for $ 4.50 . 
  so a litre in ca\u00f1as costs $ 6 , and a litre in ` pints ' costs $ 9 . 
  this is because the pint-ordering tourists are less price-sensitive than the locals . 
  we do n't drink pints because they get warm before you 've finished them ( at least in the summer ) . 
  op is troll or has stockholm syndrome . 
   bottom line is that one is as easy and simple as the other [ ... ] it takes very little effort to memorize either of them 1 litre of water has a mass of 1kg and a volume of 1000cm ^ 3 . 
  1 pint of water has a mass of 1.04375 lb and a volume of 34.677429099 in ^ 3 . 
  neither of those two numbers are divisible by 12 . 
  you have those memorised , right ? 
   imperial units also deal with what 's more likely to be encountered in the real world only in the us , liberia and burma . 
   a thou is a 1000th of an inch which is by far all that is needed in the every day world . 
  chains and furlongs are nice if memorized and nothing more than miles are also needed 99 % of the time in real life . 
  1 micrometre is 1e-6 metres . 
  1km is 1e3 metres . 
  so there are 1e9 micrometres in a km . 
  i can do this in my head . 
  let 's work out how many ` thou ' there are in a mile , shall we ? 
  three arbitrary factors to memorise there . 
  i ca n't do this in my head , so i 'll use a calculator . 
  answer is 63,360,000 . 
  *** what always makes me laugh is that imperial proponents cheerfully use si units for electricity ( volts , amps , ohms ) , but do n't have the ability that the rest of the world does to relate these to their other units . 
  eg , 1 amp passing through a resistance of 1 ohm for 1 second is a joule . 
  now i challenge an imperial-prisoner to tell me what that is equivalent to in force over distance . 
  a schoolboy studying basic physics could tell you that in europe ( it 's one newton metre : 1n \u00b7 m ) . 
  or 0.737562 foot \u00b7 pounds ( you had that memorised , right ? ) . 
  [ edit : changed microns to micrometres for clarity ], 
  quite . 
  it 's a lame justification for intransigence . 
  the government 's position is that it 's not compatible with the constitution ( '' * indissoluble unity of the spanish nation , the common and indivisible homeland of all spaniards * '' ) . 
  catalans voted overwhelmingly to accept the constitution in 1978 . 
  so no takesy backsy , no referendum , no self-determination , ever . 
  of course in reality , the constitution does n't prevent a * non-binding * referendum , and constitutions can be amended . 
   which allows member states to limit speech in many , many cases actually , to take that a bit further , i think section 2 would allow a member state to ban any kind of free speech that they might be likely to want to ban , rendering section 1 pretty pointless . 
   the exercise of these freedoms , since it carries with it duties and responsibilities , may be subject to such formalities , conditions , restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society , in the interests of national security , territorial integrity or public safety , for the prevention of disorder or crime , for the protection of health or morals , for the protection of the reputation or rights of others , for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence , or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary . 
   which implies that citizens would n't have the right , for example , to advocate abolishment of certain rights protected in the echr . 
  it 's just `` that citizens would n't have the right ** under the ehcr ** to advocate abolishment of certain rights protected in the echr '' . 
  the echr is a minimum set of rights , in addition to rights that you get from your member state . 
  in the uk , two men are allowed to marry . 
  in france they are not [ edit : i am wrong ; they are . 
  but not in germany ] . 
  echr says nothing about this . 
  there are a lot of commentators ( usually with an extreme anti-eu bias ) who conflate ( probably deliberately ) `` not having a right to do x under the echr '' and `` x is banned under the echr '' . 
  plenty of minority parties advocate against various parts of the echr , and even advocate for withdrawal , and it 's not illegal to do that in their member states . 
  but if it * were * illegal in a member state , you could n't use the echr to have the law overturned . 
   although on closer reading , rather than prohibiting that form of speech , it 's actually only refusing to protect it , which i guess would n't technically prohibit member states from protecting it . 
  that 's it . 
  article 10 guarantees freedom of speech , then what the right hand giveth , the left hand taketh away with section 2 , which ** allows ** member states to limit speech in many , many cases , but does n't ** require ** them to do it . 
  i am absolutely sure that an eu member could adopt the same laws on freedom of speech as the us tomorrow , and it would n't be illegal under eu law . 
  it 's really unlikely to happen because of historical and cultural reasons , but not reasons of eu law . 
   this article really does n't seem to belong in the document at all . 
  yeah , it 's shitty drafting and as clear as mud . 
  quite the reverse , surely ? 
  can you give me an example of protected speech in the us which is proscribed under eu law ? 
  wow . 
  the difference in level of discourse is astounding . 
  does n't matter . 
  it 's a member state issue . 
  there 's no european law on hate speech . 
  though section 2 of [ article 10 of the european convention on human rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_10_of_the_european_convention_on_human_rights ) * allows * restrictions on free speech at a national level ( e.g. 
  criminalising holocaust denial , which is illegal in many but not all eu states ) , none are required . 
  only the tenth amendment . 
  and the fourth is n't compatible with the ( awful ) european arrest warrant system , so some tweaking required there to one of them . 
  the rest appear to me to be down to the member state , and are compatible with eu membership . 
  yeah , that cgp grey video is a pile of shite . 
  he says that nobody wants to visit crappy french castles , but instead prefer `` awesome '' british castles . 
  aaaaaand illustrates `` awesome british castle '' with a picture of mont sant michel . 
  in france . 
  and of course versailles gets more visitors that all the british castles and palaces put together . 
  he also conflates the crown estates with the monarch 's property . 
  they are not the same thing at all , and if we abolished the monarchy , the deposed monarch is not going to be able to bugger off with the crown estates . 
  the queen 's personal property is really about # 200m , plus balmoral and sandringham . 
  yeah , it 's a lot , but it ** absolutely does not ** include the crown estates ( worth about # 12bn ) . 
  they 're just not hers . 
   in barcelona there are quite a few [ 941 sleeping on the streets , and 1,973 sleeping in shelters etc.

   i think turkey will join the eu in the ( distant ) future cyprus has a veto ( as do all existing members ) , so this is extremely unlikely while turkey occupies half their country . 
  greece is also extremely unlikely to accept turkish accession to the eu for the same reason ( and others ) . 
  when i went to normal local-market agencies , they all wanted a nie , as did electricity and gas companies . 
  did n't need one for the bank account though : in fact , i needed the bank certificate showing i had the savings to get the nie . 
  i think the takeaway from this is that in spain , they just make it up as they go along . 
  yeah , me too , but they were basically sublets , not on the open market . 
  i was a non-economic resident of spain , and i was required to show i had savings ( they wanted a minimum of $ 5.8 k ) and fully-comprehensive health insurance with no co-pay ( not travel insurance ) . 
  i only needed this to get my [ nie number ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nie_number ) so i could rent a flat and get connected to utilities . 
  if i was going to flatshare or sublet , i would n't have needed that .
