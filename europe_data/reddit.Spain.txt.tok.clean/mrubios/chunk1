i ca n't even ... what 's the reasoning behind that ? 
   2 years in jail wat . 
  same here , buses are mercedes-benz too . 
  [ why are you not using this ? 
  ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/herp-derp-for-youtube/ioomnmgjblnnolpdgdhebainmfbipjoh ), 
  is driving a normal hobby ? 
  because those 1000kg metal things at high speed are way more dangerous than a rifle . 
  ** news-flash ** : criminals already have guns . 
  attempting to murder someone is the action , the `` why '' does n't matter . 
  and trying to murder someone and getting some killed by accident are vastly different actions . 
   what 's the problem ? 
  that in practice does n't work like that . 
   some hate crimes against whites may be dismissed as not being hate crimes ) this is the problem , in most cases there 's no way to really prove anything . 
  it should n't , law should should punish equal actions equally regardless of motives . 
  i 'd love to play a match without bloodcyka , invoker , sniper , riki or pudge . 
  volvo pls do it . 
   we also have cable here , but it 's pretty niche . 
  i think ** only one company does it ** what ? 
  ono , movistar , jazztel , orange , r , euskatel , adamo , vodafone ... they all do cable . 
  adamo already does 1gbps in a few places of asturias and catalonia ( hands down the best spanish connection , but expanding very slowly ) . 
  r has 1gbps ready cable in most galician houses but they only offer 200/300mbps ( still waiting for the competition to catch up ... ) so does euskatel in basque country ( not sure if they offer 300mbps yet ) . 
  and movistar + vodafone are deploying a joint network on virtually all small-to-middle sized cities right now , so expect 300/500/1000mbps connections in a few years ( they 're throwing a ridiculous amount of money at this ) . 
  but then again , most people stick to the cheapest connection available which is usually adsl / adsl2 + . 
  oh look , a bunch of b/w mediocre photos . 
  how artsy . 
  fair enough , 
  you ca n't change things from prison either , and the military is not about morals , it 's about doing what you 're told . 
  mind that i 'm not critisizing him for doing so , in fact i admire the fact that he stood for what he believed in , not everyone can say that . 
  just find it funny that people think this is strange , he would be rightfully accused of insubordination ** everywhere ** , implying `` this is a spain thing '' is pure nonsense . 
   i would go as far as saying that military and corruption go hand in hand everywhere . 
  this . 
  for the military to work you have to give some people almost absolute power , that ends up breeding corruption no matter how honorable they might seem . 
  you realize the exact same thing would happen in any other country , right ? 
  you give up some freedoms when you ( willingly ) join the military , openly criticising your superiors through non-military channels is one of them . 
  the end of the earth according to romans . 
  what american roller coaster industry ? 
  b&m and intamin pretty much dominate the market and they 're both swiss . 
  stupid people do stupid things . 
  that 's life 101 . 
  that depends on who you ask . 
  rekt, 
  yeah , that 's why we spend 10 % of our gdp on the military and worship our glorious leader mariano rajoy brea . 
  i literally can not wait to kill some of those catalonian traitors . 
  only if you educate yourself first . 
  not until the left stops trying to make the second one happen again . 
  does n't matter , neither ( or everyone ) should have it . 
  wot, 
  no homo, 
  you can have both . 
  that 's what good design is , 
  function  form , period . 
  i was talking about the trams btw . 
  til : terrible design is the future . 
  wan na bet 50 $ the attackers were * european * instead of european ? 
  we go ironically though . 
  i 'm already a sexual * dynamo * m8 . 
  please strike spain too , i just saw frozen with elsa singing `` sueltalo '' like her powers were explosive farting ... 
  * junker summon table pls *, 
   occasional stabbing or shooting or bombing between the far-right and far-left . 
  * and nothing of value was lost . 
  if they 'd struck earlier they could have done lots of things , but they did n't . 
  at that point with apple / samsung dominating already the `` me too '' approach is hopeless . 
  the let 's say 2 % of a 80 % share is worse than the 80 ~ 90 % of a 10 % share . 
  android nokias would n't sell shit , just like sony or htc . 
  `` everything but anarchocapitalism is not capitalism '' is so 2009 . 
  most euphoric cyberlibertarians already moved to less obvious bullshit , did n't you get the memo ? 
  they 're * the samsung * of windows phone , around 9 out of 10 wp8/8 .1 phones are nokia . 
  i ca n't see a better position for them after being so ridiculously late to the proper smartphone market , they 're selling more phones every day , that 's something most companies ca n't say . 
  and ~ 90 % of those are either samsung or chinese crap . 
  going android would have been even worse for nokia . 
  and if nokia went with android it would be another blip in the radar just like every single company except samsung . 
  it 's amazing for pr0n and fine for everything else . 
   the two biggest parties , which are 73 % of the total representation , are both against the independence , so it 's rather impossible to do . 
  they are the two biggest parties because they are the two most supported parties , so mechanism is working perfectly fine . 
  that was bait m8 . 
  it 's completely false , not `` strong '' . 
  i never see self-criticism though . 
  * buying these high-risk financial product was totally not my fault , banks are literally robbing people !! 1 !, 
  we love to shift blame , it 's like a national sport . 
  that 's pretty easy assuming most of the population do n't want a monarchy . 
  which is not actually the case . 
   except it does n't reality disagrees , according to both the polls and elections . 
   because the state model should always answer to the will of its people indeed , and most spaniards voted monarchic parties in the last elections . 
  good thing the economy is not a zero sum game then . 
  we do n't have a * republican flag * , the left likes to use the second republic one though . 
  independentist vote would have to be really massive , so it 's very very hard . 
  and there 're big parties in catalonia/basque country that are not pro-independence . 
  the constitution can be changed . 
  not really , it 's a nebulous concept in a mostly useless piece of paper that is not enforceable . 
  nobody knows where to put the line on that * right * anyway . 
  we libertarianism now . 
  i have no idea , but it seems like you 're pretty knowledgeable . 
   now it would be a good step to reinstall a pre-franco spain . 
  if that means a second republic spain then no , thank you . 
  this was planned 6 months ago . 
  your argument is invalid . 
  do you seriously think pablemos has anything to do with this ? 
  topkek, 
  even though i consider myself a republican i ca n't think of a better head of state right now , unless you ask the average edgy-left teen you 'll get pretty similar answers in most cases . 
  while there 's a lot to argue about monarchy itself , the man is ridiculously well prepared .
