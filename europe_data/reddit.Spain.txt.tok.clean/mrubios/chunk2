  dat telecinco prime time , the word `` populism '' is quite not enough to define this this . 
   feminism  equality dis newspeak . 
  centre-right wins over centre-left with a small margin but with huge losses for both overall . 
  lots of smaller parties ( mostly left ) getting more votes , even 5 seats for a completely new ( and controversial ) one . 
  pablemos getting 5 seats , great ... now pp and psoe will add their own clowns to telecinco 's prime time too . 
  thank you guise .

   google has the money to expand over the country and why would you want one isp to `` expand over the country '' ? 
  local companies work vastly better . 
  i rather have have 100 small corporations working together than a huge one blatantly buying the regulators . 
  having the advertisement overlords as your isp sounds like a great idea .

  he 's not going to touch gay marriage . 
  he might look stupid but he 's smart enough to not risk future votes just to please a couple of ultra-religious senile grandpas that will probably be dead in 4/8 years , they can tap into the new generations who already take that equality for granted and might be looking for more conservative policies .

  there 's literally no rational arguments for criminalization . 
  how so ? 
  things have changed a lot since the 90 's . 
  full disk encryption is 3 clicks away now ( on both desktop and mobile operative systems ) , things like owncloud or even osx server let you setup your own servers in minutes , bittorrent sync will give you access to all your files without touching a third party machine , and so on ...

  romans = / = european union i do n't see how those `` genocides '' are relevant from a modern perspective , every single culture in the world has mixed with or driven off other cultures , including the welsh ( they were not the first ones to habit the current british isles ) . 
  there 's a lot more to living than having more disposable income .

  yes , we are hot . 
  well yes , if you win a lottery . 
  but that works almost everywhere . 
   that and the ease of immigrating into the us . 
  you are kidding right ? 
  emigrating to the us is impossible / a nightmare unless you have a pretty good excuse , just like to europe or any highly developed nation for that matter . 
  millions , they are a country ... 
   also , ** unlike most of the the eu ** -- excluding finland/sweden who have the sami , ** the us did not wipe out its aboriginal people ** wait ... what ? 
  i found it pretty funny . 
   becouse of the globalisation we ve lost ** billions of jobs ** .
