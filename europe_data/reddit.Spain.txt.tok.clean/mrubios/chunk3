  they got nothing on the r [ a ] t doto m [ a ] ster r [ a ] ce . 
  that was cute :3, 
   germans and their efficiency at mass murder that escalated quickly ... 
  you are right , my cheeky comment makes no sense whatsoever ... that 's what i get for stopping at the headline :(, 
   * ad hominem fallacies are a compelling argument . 
   population in general seeing dishonest people succeed and honest people getting nowhere this is devastating for any society . 
  ca n't wait for those russian tanks in bcn . 
  that non-existent repression sounds very romantic though . 
  and apparently it fuels populism extremely well , even in 2014 . 
   it even explicitly limits itself to representation and not forms of direct rule or sortition . 
  if that 's democracy i do n't think i want it . 
  it 's certainly better than a majority tyranny . 
   any spanish party that shows the minimum of openness towards negotiating anything related to catalonia will find itself immediately attacked ( as traitors ) by the ** other parties ** what other parties think should n't matter to them . 
  that 's one hell of a hangover . 
  not sure if serious ... 
  regular users just do n't advocate , that 's more of a power user / fanboy thing . 
  around 80 % of the smartphone/tablet market . 
  what point ? 
  it 's not like they hate america or american companies , you said that no * casual * user uses linux or would drop windows for it which is completely false , i was just pointing that out because it 's already happening . 
  that 's also true , but what 's your point ? 
  i was just pointing that you are wrong :  i have never heard anyone advocate for linux as an operating system for the masses that was n't someone who 's hobby or career revolved around computers . 
  also , aosp is open source . 
  i want danish sockets for my house , they look so happy . 
  we 90 's now . 
  no , but they are done with windows afaik . 
  this is coming from a w8/wp/onedrive / bing user by the way . 
  you might have heard about this obscure thing called android . 
  yeah , my grandparents just love windows 8 . 
  you must be fun at parties . 
  ... but not culturally . 
  you do n't need an office in the city centre . 
  because in most cases mega-skyscrappers make no economic sense . 
  it 's more of a * waving your dick around * thing . 
  that cluster looks really cool . 
  that would be the most unexpected way to actually put spanish tanks in barcelona . 
  spain can into republics again ? 
   ukrainian homophobia , though ? 
  no problem !, 
  except the part where , you know ... nobody said that . 
  i 'm ok with that , for now . 
  wot, 
  [ dispelling the myths of frying with olive oil . 
  ] ( http://www.oliveoiltimes.com/whats-cooking-with-olive-oil/frying-with-olive-oil/30470 ) most stuff should be fried at around ~ 180\u00ba c , which is well under the smoking point of even the cheapest olive oil . 
  til : some of the best chefs in the world are not serious about making food . 
   what are they going to do ? 
  i could beat the shit out of you m86735781623 . 
  * you would n't understand . 
   nobody cooks with olive oil i do ... 
  a-are you ok ? 
  perhaps you should see a doctor . 
  ^ ^ ^ prepare ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ credit ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ card . 
  * everyone must speak danish because i like danish . 
  sounds like spain , here they use the word * fascist * though . 
  because the remaining languages become more efficient and more people are allowed to communicate . 
  nothing . 
  apart from making sure that everything we know about them is properly archived of course . 
  what is this i do n't even ... 
   * pp is literally ~ ~ hitler ~ ~ franco . 
  * the hyperbole is strong with this one . 
  oh you poor thing ... 
  dat history rewriting . 
  it 's macedonia apparently . 
   55 euros per month when you put it that way ... still nope . 
   because the costs of a melt down are in the trillions . 
  literally !, 
   the problem is , that it might render quite ** huge parts ** of germany uninhabitable . 
  you should stop taking movies so seriously , they are just fiction . 
  great , less competition . 
  in before those 300mb connections are mysteriously delayed to 2016 . 
  pudge pls no . 
  what ? 
  u wot m861273452893462837462342893678121892402937428936429384 ? 
  you ca n't have apm without telemadrid , it just does n't work . 
  serbia pls no ... 
  suddently norway big . 
  * for real this time guys !, 
  you should get up to speed , it 's not only about crimea anymore . 
  because they are basically russian . 
  holy anecdotal evidence batman !, 
  i do n't see the `` western culture '' diverging anytime soon . 
  as long as russia and china exist europe and north america will remain ( for better or worse ) natural allies . 
  that 's cute . 
  yes . 
  has science gone too far ? 
  because those two are complete opposites . 
  please do n't provide so many sources for your counterargument , my browser is about to explode . 
  spain of course . 
  that 's sounds really nice , but uninformed opinions are completely useless in the best case scenario and mildly to extremely dangerous in real ones . 
  wait ... are you trying to deny the human sexual dimorphism ? 
  political correctness it 's getting popcorn worthy already . 
  no , thank you . 
   they are just pp without the francoist triad of military , bullfighting and the catholic church . 
  lol * my grandmother is just like a bicicle without the wheels , handlebar and chain . 
  do you even read ? 
  because if you did you 'd see that the article is not quoting junker 's statement . 
   so , what happens next ? 
  we wait for the actual results ? 
  is this supposed to be the drowned kid 2.0 ? 
  did n't you see the drowned kid ??!!??!, 
   diversity and multiculturalism are two very powerful mechanisms through which humanity prospers .
