  what ? 
  those two things are literally opposites . 
  multiculturalism , by definition , destroys diversity since you end up with less different cultures than you had before . 
  we could reduce it to just `` islam '' if you prefer . 
   companies would move to spain . 
  it 's already happening , they 've been moving for years since mas started his political shenanigans . 
  and especially now that ** catalan ** lobbyists have managed to push the new law which that makes it extremely easy compared to how it was before , it 's a well known secret that most ibex35 companies currently established in barcelona are either considering moving or already preparing to do so ( mostly to madrid , for obvious reasons ) . 
   no , but there is a spanish identity what the fuck ? 
  there 's absolutely no such thing as a `` spanish '' culture that everyone but catalans share . 
  what is commonly sold as `` spanish '' abroad is nothing more than a weird mix of catalan , castillian , basque , galician , andalucian , aragonese or valencian stuff . 
  someone from let 's say cantabria and someone from andalucia know how to speak the same language , pay taxes to the same government and will cheer for the same team at the world cup but other than that , they have pretty much nothing in common . 
  everything about catalonia is and has always been an integral part of the `` spanish culture '' , in fact , it be could be argued that it would n't make to much sense to even talk about `` spain '' without it . 
   you both hate each other [ citation needed ], 
  did you just compare catalonia to a ~ $ 17 trillion gdp state like california ? 
   * your anecdotal opinion is not welcomed because my feelings . 
  you know what republic used that red and yellow flag ? 
  [ the spanish one . 
  ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/primera_rep%c3%bablica_espa%c3%b1ola ), 
  yes , a piece of cloth totally killed your grandparent . 
  why is this massive bullshit being upvoted ? 
  the current flag has existed for more than 200 years and has nothing to do with franco 's dictatorship other than being used at the time , ** [ just like during the first republic ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/flag_of_the_first_spanish_republic.svg ) ** and all the other post-empire spanish states except for the short lived ( and quite disastrous ) second republic . 
  we 've never been under 8 % unemployment , even during the huge bubble . 
  they 're structural . 
  cool story bro . 
  by nature drm relies on encryption , so yes . 
   it would be crippling for financial services in the city  `` crippling '' that 's an understatement if i ever saw one ... banning encryption would make modern banking ( and many other industries ) ** absolutely impossible ** in the uk . 
  i do n't even begin to understand how could he possibly think that banning encryption is actually possible . 
  ca n't wait to see him try though , pretty fun stuff . 
  he 's strangely good looking . 
  other than that he 's your average populist politician , you 've seen one you 've seen them all . 
  gay marriages were 1,72 % of the total . 
  of those the 5,11 % ended up in divorce , the rate for heterosexual ones was 8,56 % during the same period . 
   our base are the universal human rights you mean a bunch of random things some dudes wrote on a paper ? 
  that 's a solid ethical base right there lol, 
   dear rome : there is a strong correlation between bigotry against homosexuals and being secretly gay . 
  [ citation needed ], 
  the `` but how can i explain my kids ? '', 
  argument is the only one that makes my blood boil . 
  [ just fucking tell them , jesus . 
   2015  cds i do n't even have anything that could read them anyway ... 
  it 's a direct comparison , literally . 
  you 're just moving the goalposts . 
  only if that kurdish base is european . 
  keep up with the edits mate . 
  not sure if sweden yes or sweden yes . 
   disgusting * expresses le swede redditor from the comfort of his home . 
   my parents are mass-going catholics , and they do n't care what the vatican thinks . 
  spain in a nutshell . 
  * - do you consider yourself catholic ? 
  * * - yes . 
  * * - so you agree with the moral stances of the catholic church , right ? 
  * * - not really . 
  * * - ok ... when was the last time you went to church ? 
  * * - 7 years ago for my sister 's wedding . 
  i 'd start looking into changing the pr department before becoming absolutely irrelevant if i were they . 
  clock 's ticking , grave by grave . 
  except we are not bees or wasps , we are already much more successful at survival and in this case a kidnapped child would not be an actual `` threat to our nest '' ( read : society ) , the scope is completely different . 
  also , other animals do not understand concepts like state , legitimacy , ethics , justice or due process . 
  so is mob `` justice '' supposed to be a good ( as in widely accepted ) thing there ? 
  the whole concept of rallying armed blokes to go out and * take out the bad guys * seems pretty dangerous , not to mention uncivilized ... that 's something i would expect from some african failed state , not the us . 
  that sounds absolutely ridiculous . 
  yes . 
   if we want to build bridges , we should learn to speak a common language . 
  about how some lgbt orgs work . 
  i do n't know why are you getting downvoted . 
  a decent chunk of the modern lgbt `` movement '' ** do not ** want normalization simply because that would represent the death of it . . which means no more victim complex and most importantly , tasty public funding . 
  the map has absolutely no value simply because the higher the score is the less normalized gsms are . 
  a country with absolutely total acceptance would represent a score very close to 0 % since no specific laws would exist . 
  because the index is not about measuring to what extent `` lgbti people '' are able to live a normal life having equal rights and opportunities , it 's about how much legal attention whoring and * special * laws they have . 
  which is pretty ironic because that 's exactly what gsms used to fight against . 
  oh look , this pointless index again . 
  yet another example of publicly funded lgbtwtfbbq nonsense that completely fails to focus on actual issues . 
  * turboprop fuel ca n't melt conspiracy maymays . 
  [ the simpsons did it better . 
   extrem spanish nationalistic party , whose sole political program is to opose anything relating the catalan culture or language . 
  what they are is actually irrelevant . 
  spain in a nutshell . 
  that 's the thing , illegal immigration hits legal immigrants the hardest . 
  i do n't know know how some people can not see something so obvious , or even get surprised when they realize they 're some of the ones that hate it most . 
  while also bitching while we did , because fences are not pc enough . 
  i 'm bleeding now . 
  if you define societies by territory , sure . 
  replacing ! = being a part of . 
  other than western sahara , islam has never been part of spain 's history . 
  invading something does n't make you a part of it . 
  oh but we already do , for plenty of things . 
  oh my ... who would have thought !, 
  no thank you . 
   implying usa is actually doing something to stop it . 
  they are , not 100 % because there 's pc to be held . 
  but they could be , especially now that surveillance technology makes it easy . 
   that 's not an option . 
  of course it is , you buy a fence , put it on the ground and you police it , it 's a pretty simple concept really . 
  pretty much all states in the world have been doing it for centuries in one way or another . 
  no ... there never was . 
  the chinese government agrees with you , in fact , they 're already starting to work on a similar system . 
   2015  it is what defines us as a country . 
  that german guilt lmfao . 
   itt : american redditors telling germans how they should run their country ( also other european redditors ) . 
  if it 's not supposed to be discussed why would you post that shit in the first place ?
