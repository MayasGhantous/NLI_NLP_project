  this is not facebook . 
   i could n't see rajoy take in 1 million refugees in a single year . 
  thank god , luckily he 's not ** that ** stupid . 
   in a free country implying . 
  is this the german ( or most european nations for that matter ) concept of justice ? 
  poland is love , poland is life . 
  see you around mate o /, 
   that one can invoke the argument from fallacy against a position does not prove one 's own position either i never said it did ...  but / u/zyllber [ 1 ] only points out your argument is fallacious , which is true . 
  indeed , and so is the implication that i 'm wrong because my argument is fallacious . 
   therefore your argument is unsound . 
  whatever my argument is does not change the conclusion . 
  he/she chose to believe their words while i did n't . 
   you have n't proven anything about / u/zyllber [ 2 ] 's original argument . 
  i never tried to and neither did him/her , without access to those detention centers the two scenarios ( they lie / they do not lie ) are equally posible . 
  you only had to listen . 
  rekt, 
  so is your implication !, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/argument_from_fallacy is n't logic fun ? 
   afaik the un and hrw so ... no one worth listening to . 
  do n't know about the australian human rights commision . 
  but considering how much of a joke the un is , i 'd take it for granted . 
  why not !, 
   deeper level of idiocy ... 
  the irony . 
  ** #prayforportugal **, 
  umm ... you 're getting the cookies , period . 
  the only diference is that you 're informed about it . 
  * literally . 
   if the whole ukraine is in war , i dont see a reason why we could refuse them . 
  the whole syria is not at war . 
  marriage is some legal paperwork , i do n't see how it `` strengthens is the feeling of responsibility toward one another '' ... 
  why the fuck were you getting downvoted ? 
  anyway ... 
  in spain homosexual marriages divorced less than heterosexual ones , around ~ 5 % compared to ~ 8 % , slightly different figures were thrown around in the media early this year during the whole 10 anniversary thing . 
  what a disaster , your remote surgeries are going to get all interrupted now . 
  they can do it if they feel so inclined . 
  yep , the us strides ahead . 
  as usual . 
  i 'm pretty sure `` everyone '' is not going to perform remote surgery on `` everyone '' . 
  that would be doctors , working in ** a hospital ** , doing surgery to patients in ** another hospital ** which would be technically trivial to connect through dedicated fiber . 
   people have to remember the history here , how the fascist dictator franco brutalised spain . 
  ftfy, 
  lmao why did i miss that ? 
  i could n't care less about what spanish meps voted because i did n't vote in the european elections to begin with . 
  if some state wants to butcher their internet it should be voted in its parliament or whatever other governing body they have not in some elevated shit that , in practice , answers to no one . 
  once more , remove eu . 
  that 's gorgeous . 
  welp ... guess i 'm not versed enough in benefit shopping . 
   they refused luxembourg for crying out loud !, 
  who the fuck chooses germany over luxembourg on a benefits buffet ? 
  fronce pls . 
  * we did it reddit !, 
  what the fuck is `` white '' to begin with ? 
  so newspeak will be mandatory ? 
  it 's the verge , what did you expect ? 
  journalism and informed opinions ? 
  i see pp are making the most of their last two months . 
  lmao, 
  sounds great , bring it on . 
  straya pls ... do you even eurovision ? 
  of course you do . 
  i like how this gets downvoted into oblivion because how dare french people have a language . 
  such diversity in this `` union '' , truly fascinating . 
  it 's fine , we 'll take the tourists :3, 
  free trade and somewhat standarized industry regulations , that 's more than enough . 
  looking back , the eu delusion should have died in 2004 . 
  what a surprise , who would have guessed ? 
  that looks fucking awesome . 
  it was , and we gave zero shits like you should . 
   stay or go back to spain they 're already in spain , ceuta and melilla are two of the 19 autonomous communities ( cities in this case ) that form spain , they 're just as spanish as asturias , madrid or aragon . 
  what you 're saying is that we should force a spanish population out of their homes and give away their territory to some random state that it was never part of , which is batshit insane to put it lightly ... 
  you , i like you . 
   it 's so simple !, 
  actually , it is . 
  it 's called borders , and they 've been a thing for thousands of years . 
  so do you want to just abandon and hand out ~ 200000 spanish citizens to the moroccan government ? 
  what are you trying to say exactly ? 
  is a youtube video `` everywhere '' ? 
  it was n't even mentioned here . 
  spain existed before gibraltar . 
  and no one other than cheap uk tabloids actually care about the pointless bitching . 
  because they were spanish territories full of spanish citizens before morocco was even remotely a thing . 
  let 's not repeat the western sahara blunder , shall we ? 
  the problem in spain is the time it takes to fill and have all the useless bullshit approved , not the money . 
   this wave was coming no matter what . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the greek , italian , french and spanish navies are more than enough to keep a bunch of boats from invading the schengen borders . 
  germans are so * racist * . 
   * when were you when uropean union dies ? 
  this is getting ridiculous ... 
  can i starve my son to make a point too or would that be illegal ? 
  do n't worry , he says they 're fine . 
   if someone was lactose intolerant you also would n't lie to him . 
  health issues ! = imaginary fantasies, 
  source ? 
  are they even trying ? 
  * we are deeply concerned guise . 
   yet we still have iana [ 1 ] , ntia [ 2 ] or w3c [ 3 ] . 
  none of those are government agencies nor release legally binding rules . 
  not really news , it 's just another day in the `` european '' commision . 
   is spain white kek 'd,
