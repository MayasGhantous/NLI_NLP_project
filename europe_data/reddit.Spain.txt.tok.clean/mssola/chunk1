in catalonia corruption is of course not acceptable , and since there 's been cases of that , people get angry quite rapidly when some case pops up . 
  however , when you say `` less acceptable '' i think that you want me to compare it with other regions in spain . 
  i ca n't do that , since i 've only lived in catalonia and , therefore , i do n't honestly know what 's the real view on corruption in other spanish regions . 
  in my opinion time will tell . 
  nobody can predict the future  there 's also been cases of corruption in catalonia . 
  there are some parties ( e.g. 
  cup ) that want independence to start with a clean slate ( as they put it : `` per canviar-ho tot '' / `` to change everything '' ) . 
  this includes corruption . 
  other parties ( like erc , icv ) that are in favor of this referendum have also been quite persistent in regards to getting rid of corruption and such . 
  so , only one can hope , 
  `` la merc\u00e8 '' is how it 's called the local festivities in barcelona . 
  every single town in catalonia has a couple of days ( or even a week ) where it 's local holidays . 
  therefore , there 's nothing special in `` la merc\u00e8 '' in this regard . 
  imho the important thing is that they could vote . 
  regardless of the result , they are free . 
  a * consulta * is an non binding consultation . 
  this is done this way in an attempt to avoid the spanish government shutting it down . 
  but as you might already know , the spanish government will most likely shut it down anyways . 
  i have n't found a link in english but [ here ] ( http://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/declaraci%c3%b3_de_sobirania_i_del_dret_a_decidir_del_poble_de_catalunya ) it is a resolution from the catalan parliament saying exactly that , that catalonia is a sovereign region , 
  there 's no easy answer to this , believe me :-) to make things simple and short , we can say that both catalonia and the basque country have strong nationalistic/independentist forces . 
  this situation has created tensions multiple times between the spanish royal family and the people from these two regions . 
  again , as i 'm saying , this is a simplification , but i hope that you get the idea :-), 
  according to the polls , federalism is weak in spain ( i say weak but i could use stronger words really :p ) . 
  with the crisis the number of people that says that spain needs to be more centralist have increased . 
  so , yes , they can change : to a more centralist spain most likely . 
  i see your point , but this is not the case for spain . 
  my honest feeling about this is that currently the image of the spanish monarchy can not be any worse and that the abdication is not * that * surprising . 
  therefore , * any * change is good if you want to keep the monarchy going ( and yes , felipe seems to be more popular than his father ) . 
  so , in my opinion , this change will hardly backfire to the spanish crown . 
  anyways , the `` big '' parties ( pp and psoe ) have welcomed the new king . 
  this means that there wo n't be any referendum or republican process , or at least not from pp 's and psoe 's end . 
  as i 've stated before , a referendum would 've been the fairest thing to do , so i guess that now it just depends on the spanish people if there will be a referendum of some sorts ( but i 'm sure that there wo n't ) . 
  yes , i know about erc , the referendum in catalonia , the two-party system crisis , etc. 
  my comment replies to the feeling that `` pablo iglesias , the kingslayer '' might seem like this guy alone had something to do with the abdication of the king . 
  i think that we all know that this is not true . 
  now , has pablo iglesias and his party contributed to the abdication of the king ? 
  i do n't think so either , to be honest . 
  in my opinion the abdication is just a desperate move that has more to do with `` let 's make monarchy cool again '' rather than the actual political situation in spain . 
  in fact i doubt that the current political situation has anything to do with this decision . 
  but this is just my * skeptical me * speaking , 
  i have to say that this is a pretty good argument  however , i disagree . 
  no matter how non-partisan a person is , if it 's involved in politics ( and a king/queen has to be involved in politics , regardless if its role is minimal , as in spain ) , he will have more sympathy to some candidates to others . 
  in my point of view , this is not being neutral . 
  this leads to my conclusion that , at least in politics , nobody can be 100 % neutral . 
  therefore , no matter how hard you try to * pick * a king/queen , it will always take sides ( or at least contribute in politics in a non-neutral way ) . 
  another point you make is to * pick * a person that has close ties to the history of its country . 
  this is a ** really ** poor argument in spain  let 's see , the current royal family is from house bourbon . 
  this family entered in spain through a war that divided the country ( in my point of view it was a civil war , but it 's not called like this in spanish history ) . 
  to make this short ( and to be as neutral as a catalan guy can be :p ) , this was a * disaster * for the kingdoms that formed the crown of aragon ( some people on twitter are making the joke of felipe v ( 1714 ) and felipe vi ( 2014 ) ) . 
  therefore , this is not a point that you want to make in spain . 
  finally , as you can see , regardless of your position , at some point you have to * pick * a king or a queen . 
  this * decision * was made in spain centuries ago . 
  the current spanish people had no say in that decision , it was made for us . 
  anyways , you have to * pick * a king/queen . 
  in order to pick a king/queen , you have to vote , and this is called democracy . 
  when you want to pick in a democratic way the head of the state , this is called republic . 
  in my opinion a republic is the fairest solution . 
  while writing this i thought that your first point ( non-partisan , apolitical , ... ) can be fixed if the candidates of a republican election are not tied to any party . 
  again , this might be wishful thinking , since ( as i said before ) , no matter how hard you try , all the candidates would have political preferences to one side or another . 
  i might be wrong , but in the last european elections pablo iglesias and his party had a clear and * unexpected * success . 
  his party is seen by some people as a regeneration of spanish politics . 
  since the abdication of the king is important , i guess that supporters from pablo iglesias are seeing this as an oportunity to say that things are changing in spanish politics . 
  again , i might be wrong , but that 's just my 2 cents  but , does pablo iglesias have something to do with the king abdicating : no . 
  nope . 
  in a serious tone , in aim for debate : why would you prefer a member of one particular family to be the only one allowed to be the head of the state rather than a democratically elected candidate ? 
  well , the king is abdicating , that 's a hell of a reason to vote in my opinion . 
  the spanish people has to decide whether the new king is accepted or not . 
  but again , this is not going to happen . 
  if the spanish people vote for `` no '' ( which is probable , and in places like catalonia or the basque country it 's certain ) , then spain will have to go through a period of political `` instability '' ( like if things are stable right now ... ) and that 's a huge deal for pp and psoe . 
  so , again , even if it 's the fairest thing to do , a referendum monarchy vs republic is not going to happen . 
  the spanish people has to vote monarchy vs republic ** regardless ** the opinions that letizia might have regarding abortion . 
  kinda . . 
  he was the one who led spain through the democratic process and he stood still in an attempt of coup d'\u00e9tat . 
  because of this , during the 80s , 90s he was considered kinda like a * hero * . 
  i 'd say that in the last decade his popularity has declined greatly : read / u/angry _ spaniard first response , they were n't just * affairs * , they were ** major ** scandals that he dodged because the king can not be prosecuted in a legal process . 
  apart from that , in regions like catalonia or the basque country the king was n't that much * loved * for other reasons . 
  a federal republic would be the best idea for spain really . 
  but it 's not going to happen and we all know that , 
  the western powers stepping in is a ** huge ** * if * in my humble opinion  ninja edit : let 's not forget that the franco government was blessed by the usa because of his anti-communism ... 
  i guess that we will never know  but i believe that they had no real choice . 
  if they decided to vote `` no '' , and therefore look for a third republic , the army would 've stepped in for sure ( by saying that the `` no '' was towards the whole democratic process ) . 
  yes , the people of spain ratified the king back then . 
  my point is that it was their only real option ( unless you were a francoist fan , of course ) . 
  now that democracy is pretty established in spain , there should be a referendum monarchy vs republic . 
  that would be the fairest thing . 
  but on a serious note , this is not going to happen ... 
  i agree with / u/angry _ spaniard . 
  back then the only options were : constitutional monarchy or `` good luck with the army '' . 
  i do n't think no one is seriously considering a republican process . 
  and you 're right , this is is a desperate move from the king to keep monarchy going . 
  and let 's hope that his son does n't like to hunt too ... 
  i agree with you  my point is that he was appointed by franco in the first place . 
  `` the guy ** appointed by franco ** ... '' ftfy, 
  i feel almost exactly the same . 
  the only difference is that in the last elections i voted for cup . 
  yes , they are quite extremist , but i like some proposals they make in regards to democracy . 
  if we are talking about economy , i 'm more in the lines of erc , but i also like some considerations that the cup are putting in the table . 
  so , long story short : i 'm more on the lines of erc but i like some proposals of the cup that i think are important . 
  thus , since i knew they would n't win , i voted for them , because i knew that they would shake things up and put on the table some ideas that other `` traditional '' parties would n't like and that i think are important . 
  it 's also shocking because it 's the first election they win since the 30s,
