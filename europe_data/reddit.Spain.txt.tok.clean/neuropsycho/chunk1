but for some reason , not other flags like the catalan , not even the separatist flag . 
  spain is like that kid in school that was good at sports , but bad at everything else . 
  i wonder if the spanish opinion is influenced somehow by the separatist movements in spain , where the fear of being `` outside the eu '' may be seen as the main deterrent . 
  well , i 'm no expert and i only know what i read online . 
  apparently , after all major territories in the caribbean and the pacific gained independence or got annexed by other countries , there were numerous little islands here and there that were expensive to maintain . 
  spain decided to [ sell all the remaining pacific island to germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german%e2%80%93spanish_treaty_\\ ( 1899 \\ ) ) in 1899 , but they forgot to included some minor islands in the micronesia : the guedes , coroa , pescadores and ocea . 
  ( although in other places they mention other names : [ kapingamarangi , nukuoro , mapia , rongerik and ulithi ] ( http://www.fondear.org/infonautic/hombre_y_mar/relatos/oceania/micronesia_01.jpg ) ) they did n't realise until much later , and in the 1940 's they decided to refuse any claims on these islands ( you know , economically it was n't the best moment , post-civil war and all ) [ source ] ( http://www.europapress.es/nacional/noticia-gobierno-zanja-toda-especulacion-mantenimiento-posesiones-espanolas-pacifico-20140420112139.html ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.libertaddigital.com/espana/2015-09-08/es-realmente-espanola-la-micronesia-espanola-1276556556/ ), 
  actually , after all territories had been ceded or separated from spain , there were a few meaningless pacific islands that were left out in a treaty by mistake , and were n't ceded to germany at that time . 
  technically they were still spanish , but of course , spain officially rejected them when they realised , since they were obviously a mistake . 
  translation for us mortals who do n't ( yet ) speak german or a scandinavian language ? 
  pretty please ? 
  yes , but we already got rid of those . 
  no , i mean , i know for sure it 's a church ( not apartments ) because of the cross on the roof , even if it 's almost hidden . 
  and the [ lutheran cathedral ] ( http://photos.wikimapia.org/p/00/00/72/53/34_big.jpg ) is also great . 
  it has a huge/horrible cross at the rooftop , barely visible from any angle . 
  the one at klaukkala looks more like a hard drive enclosure than a church . 
  btw , another candidate would be the [ catholic church at tampere ] ( http://photos.wikimapia.org/p/00/01/32/16/46_big.jpg ) . 
  young people are actually adopting the northern binge drinking pattern instead of the traditional one in mediterranean countries . 
  in the picture it actually looked bad and i felt sorry for you guys . 
  then i googled it and it seems ok . 
  i might try it someday . 
  c'mon , it 's the easiest country . 
  c shaped map ? 
  actually , you probably are . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/citizenship_of_the_european_union  european union citizenship is supplementary to national citizenship and affords rights such as the right to vote in european elections , the right to free movement , settlement and employment across the eu , and the right to consular protection by other eu states ' embassies when a person 's country of citizenship does not maintain an embassy or consulate in the country they need protection in . 
  yes , yes , i agree , it 's a start . 
  but working part time meant that you can not pay rent , you can not a loan from the bank , you can not buy a house . 
  basically you can not take part in the economy and you depend on others to survive . 
  part-time jobs are fine for teenagers , students and little else . 
  if you 're over 25 , you need job security to live in this country . 
  nice . 
  at least it 's not canned paella , as another used commented . 
  it 's good news , undoubtely , amd i hope this trend continues . 
  however , the overwhelming majority of new jobs are temporary , and lots of them are part time . 
  employment should be measured in worked hours , and not whether someone has a job or not , because that way , ome person working half time should n't count the same to statistics as one fulltime worker . 
  spanish week ? 
  they do n't do that one in spain !, 
  what kind of stuff they sell ? 
  olive oil and cheese ? 
  wow , you found one in the wild . 
  took some pictures or something ? 
  macedonia ? 
  you must eat a lot of fruit salad there !, 
  well , this is just correct . 
  exactly that . 
  do n't join us guys , it 's a trap . 
  yes , amateur gps trackers usually combine gps+gsm for that reason . 
  i would have imagined that planes had some sort of continous satellite communitation for that reason . 
  this is what i meant , in theory it should be possible to track a plane up to the place of the accident ( airborne or not ) . 
  but even in that case , we should be able to locate the plane up to the point it crashed into the water , no ? 
  of course , but i meant something in the lines of promoting self-employment and business creation . 
  and well , also subsidies because change does n't happen overnight and you do n't want people to ... well . . starve to death . 
  why voting the left decreases the likehood for creating jobs ? 
  ( serious ), 
  and why there are regions where people are more hardworking than others ? 
  it 's all cultural in my opinion . 
  we must somehow try to encourage change when these situations are present , by giving incentives so people benefit from working , and consolidating an economy in the region . 
  i 'm no social scientist or economist , and i do n't really know the situation in the us or czechia , but at least in spain unemployment correlates with less industrialization ( more rural areas ) , where opportunities are scarce because less people are needed nowadays to work in that sector and there are no alternatives ( well , tourism is an option ) . 
  seriously , people here fight for working at mcdonalds . 
  there 's people who do n't want to work elsewhere , although luckily , most of them want to . 
  if only they could . 
  i can assure you , if you provide opportunities , people will work , that does not depend on the region/countr . 
  deep down we are all motivated by the same factors , it does n't matter if you live in norway , china or uganda . 
  of course , but when one variable precedes the other one , you can sense some direction ... 
  subsidies can be very useful , but the problem appears when you do n't also invest the money in developing/industrializating a region so it can sustain itself in the long term . 
  this was what i was thinking . 
  look at southern italy . 
  you can still see the effects of being part of the crown of aragon , even after 150 years . 
   i 'm convinced the western world gets less religious because of their lack of knowledge about the church and i 'm convinced that the western world gets less religious because their increasing knowledge about science . 
  i do n't know about the rest , but spain ? 
  i 'd have trouble finding people who consider themselves `` christians '' , specially among the younger generations . 
  since catholicism was heavily imposed by the government in the past , it has been associated with the righ-wing dictatorship and most people see the church as an outdated institution . 
  it 's not the 50s anymore . 
  nowaways most people just say that they `` believe '' in something or are `` spiritual '' ( in the case of believers ) , and non-religious/agnostic/atheist for the rest . 
  however , we are still `` culturally '' christians . 
  we get baptised , do the communion ( although not as much ) and we get married by the church , so oficially , most of us count as `` catholic '' , including myself , and i guess statistics reflect that . 
  i also live in a city in one of the least religious regions in spain , so my opinion might not be representative of the whole country . 
  ( sorry for the rant ), 
  french and catalan , even if they share some grammar features and vocabulary , have vastly different pronunciations . 
  in its written form you can more or less understand it if you are patient . 
  actually , i think that the closest language to catalan is italian ( not counting occitan ) . 
  at least spanish is written as it is pronounced . 
  english on the other hand ... 
  i 'm actually waiting for the greek course to be released in duolingo , which will be pretty soon , to start studying it , 
  captain sweden saves the day again !, 
  i agree with that . 
  in my country , most romanian immigrants just go unnoticed , and the `` visible '' ones are those that we associated with beggars and gypsies . 
  btw , why ca n't you say the same about the chinese ? 
  [ by the way , homer , what 's your least favorite country ? 
  italy or france ? 
  i thought the last refuge was gibraltar ... 
  which was basically the case . 
  spain ( and the rest of the pigs ) ended up doing what merkel said . 
  we had no choice in what economic policy we had to follow . 
  so i do n't agree with you . 
  there has been a plan . 
  i 'm not saying the plan was `` make southern europe cheap as china '' , but there has been a debate between austerity and growth in which the affected citizens had no say in it . 
  they should specify if they mean economically liberal or social liberal , which are commonly on opposite sides . 
  i know , i was just trying to make a point . 
  a whole political party should n't be labeled according to the ideology of a minority of their voters .
