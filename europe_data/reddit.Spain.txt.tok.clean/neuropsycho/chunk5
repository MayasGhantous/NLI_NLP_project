  just pick up the three stigmas , let them sun dry , and you 'll have some saffron , 
  i had no idea the volcanoes in the canary islands were still active !, 
  i heard about the submarine eruptions near el hierro , but actual lava flowing on land ... wow . 
  they could 've just posed for the photo . 
  btw : what an ugly village ... 
  yes !, 
  i loved it !, 
  rice ? 
  is n't it usually made with chick peas , or that 's portuguese version ? 
  mmmm . 
  no , no clue . 
  yep !, 
  i remember the discussions about how long ( and dangerous ) that swing in the intro must have been . 
  yes . 
  just stay away from the ramblas . 
  locals do n't go there anymore , now it 's just a tourist trap , and the pickpockets are a problem . 
  since you are a romanian and seem to know about spain , can i just ask you something ? 
  where are your people ? 
  it 's supposed to be one of the largest immigration groups in spain , but you are barely visible , compared to other immigrant groups like moroccans and latinos . 
  i personally only met two persons from your country , both working in research , very nice and professional people . 
  well , apart from the gypsies playing the accordion in the metro that started appearing since the 2000s , but that 's it . 
  regarding the language , the thing is that in catalonia most people are able to speak both languages perfectly , so we assume that and change from one to the other in the same conversation all the time . 
  usually telling people that you do n't understand is enough for them to switch back to spanish/english ( if possible ) . 
  regarding the moroccans and gypsies ... 
  i do n't know any official numbers so i do n't really know if they lead the numbers in petty theft . 
  and yeah , the amount of tourism is creating tensions between neighbors and tourists , mostly because the lack of control over illegal touristic apartments . 
  but it 's not tourism itself the problem !, 
  i 'm sorry you did n't felt welcome . 
  we 'll try to improve next time , 
  yeah , how dare they use their official language !, 
  napolitana, 
  oh , the quebec city of spain !, 
  oh , so do you dance flamenco ? 
  beware of the false friend : [ cult ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cult ), 
  some people would still be separatists , but they would be a minority ( like it was 15 years ago ) , and most people would settle for that . 
  actually , that was the initial idea , in 1975 , before the '' * caf\u00e9 para todos * '' . 
  also , it should be respected by people , and that would be the hardest part . 
  a paper does n't do anything if people do n't believe it . 
  if catalonia or the basque country passes some random law , it should n't be on the front page of most spanish newspapers by the next morning , claiming why can they do that and not la rioja ( for instance ) . 
  it does n't work if these regions are still the target of `` ideological warfare '' in order to scrape some votes . 
  basically , something like quebec would work . 
  great . 
  not only fear of getting buried ... also uncertainty . 
  but then it must move veeeeery slowly , like a meter every few years . 
  otherwise the trees would n't have had time to grow . 
  yeah ... no . 
  i 'd rather call the [ usap ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/usa_perpignan ) . 
  well , and singapore [ was expelled ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/singapore_in_malaysia#expulsion ) from malaysia . 
  i 'm just giving ideas ... ( btw , watching the video ), 
   all western countries have representative democracies , not direct ones . 
  [ ehem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/direct_democracy#switzerland )  every single constitution protects the national integrity of the nation , every single one . 
  [ aha ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_independence ) [ i see ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quebec_sovereignty_movement ) [ right ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dissolution_of_the_soviet_union )  it is just how things work . 
  let that be written into stone and shall never be discussed again . 
  yes , of course , it 's part of our identity , people are proud and do not want to lose it . 
  the catalan language is in a minority position right now , while spanish is thriving not only in catalonia , but around the world . 
  in school , catalan is used as a way to integrate newcomers in primary school . 
  however , we dedicate the same hours to teaching catalan and spanish language and literature in school . 
  which they try to revoke every other day . 
  and right-wing parties use it as a political weapon to gain votes in other spanish regions . 
  also , that 's in theory . 
  in secondary school , i had more classes in spanish than in catalan . 
  it really depends on the teacher , since at the end of the day , people just want a good teacher who can perfectly express himself than having to use a specific language . 
  [ from the same newspaper ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20170206/414044203541/juicio-artur-mas-en-directo.html ) . 
  i guess they used outdated data in the article you linked . 
  people had to register to come to the demonstration ( to plan ahead , i suppose ) , and they already reached 50000 inscriptions . 
  ok , not and expert in duneology . 
  what keeps this huge pile of sand from moving ( because of the wind ) and burying the forest ( and possible houses ) nearby ? 
  they [ changed the constitution ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/reforma_constitucional_espa%c3%b1ola_de_2011 ) almost overnight , without needing to check for approval for the rest of the population , in order so solve the debt crisis in 2011 . 
  so it 's definitely possible , and could be done quickly if the two main political parties agreed in allowing the referendum . 
  the constitution is definitely not the problem here . 
  in this particular case , i believe they are quite fragmented . 
  in some of the unionist demonstrations , you could see a bunch of the pre-constitutional ( francoist ) flags ; those are only a minority who hold a more radical view and not representative at all of the unionist standpoint . 
  then there 's sympathizers of ciudadanos and pp , which might represent a more average unionist voter , but also do n't want to be associated with one another ( because corruption , rivalry , etc. ) . 
  and then there 's what they call `` the silent majority '' ( * la mayor\u00eda silenciosa * ) which are people who just do n't care enough about the issue , and would probably vote `` no '' in order to avoid further complications . 
  i can be wrong , that 's just my two cents . 
  thanks !, 
  i disagree . 
  in my opinion , laws should reflect moral values , not vice-versa . 
  and in the 99 % of the cases , they do , but sometimes they tend to be a little behind , like in this case . 
  i think it 's [ totally legitimate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_disobedience ) to ignore a law if you are doing the right thing . 
  of course , if we start discussing what 's moral and what 's not , we would get into a full philosophical debate . 
  damn !, 
  we are screwed no matter what . 
  you should n't feel threatened by those flags . 
  they are just a sign for the current malcontent of the population . 
  the catalan separatist movement is characterized by its peacefulness and tolerance ( at least , that 's the general vibe ) and tries to encompass all kinds of people . 
  it 's not its goal to threaten anybody , but just to show what people want and that something is going on . 
  they do n't mean we hate spain ( quite the contrary !, 
  ) , or that we suddenly feel expansionist and are going to annex your land . 
  seriously , i understand you do n't identify with them , but you should n't worry . 
  they are just a way of stating the problem we currently have . 
  i believe sensible people are the exception , not the norm , anywhere in the world . 
  i agree in saying that if you did n't vote , you ca n't complain ( you had your chance and you did n't use it ) . 
  but this is an important issue , and everyone should be listened . 
  in this particular case , most no-voters felt it was unnecessary and did n't bother to show up in the ballots . 
  the issue here is not whether it 's legal or not , but whether laws should be above democracy . 
  get to the bottom ? 
  it 's relatively simple . 
  illegal ? 
  yes .
