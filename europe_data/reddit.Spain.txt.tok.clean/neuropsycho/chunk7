  i 've been reading more about this topic , and it seems that [ he did more than just making fun of that attack ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/11/06/inenglish/1446806508_614024.html?rel=mas ) . 
  he also tweeted in support of the terrorist organization eta and threatened some politicians and the police . 
  i do n't know if that deserves a two year sentence , but he definitely crossed a line . 
  good one !, 
  ps : have a good time in jail , we 'll miss you ... 
  that 's what came to my mind as well . 
  i must say i 'm a bit disappointed now :(, 
  it 's outraging . 
  this guy and the iconic way he died in 1973 ( eta put a bomb and his car flow over a building ) have been the target for jokes for decades . 
  since he was appointed president of spain by the dictator , franco , he was the planned successor for the dictatorship . 
  his death meant a relief for many people , despite the contempt towards the terrorist group . 
  i guess that another one of the reasons is that nowadays we place more importance in prevention with more emphasis in primary care , so maybe less hospital beds are needed . 
  cool . 
  it 's more like an underwater park than a museum , but i like it . 
  wow , i would n't have guessed we were so low . 
  so , what 's the reason for that ? 
  do some countries keep people in a hospital bed when they could be sent home , or just the opposite ? 
  i do n't see a clear relationship of this data with the quality of healthcare . 
  upvote for ff7 and the cognitive dissonance it gave me, 
  guat do you min ? 
  i espeak espanish and my acsent is bery best . 
  ok , ok , i should review my highschool notes ... 
  i 'm clearly not an expert in linguistics . 
  thanks !, 
  i was wrong then . 
  i thought you did n't use the \u00e8 and \u00f2 . 
  actually , almost all the valencian people i know are from the city of valencia , so i based my opinion on how they sound . 
  it is true that people at castell\u00f3 sound just like the accent of south of tarragona , and it 's not as marked as in the capital . 
  also , you have two different orthographies for norwegian : bokmal and nynorsk , right ? 
  btw , do you consider norwegian , swedish and danish to be dialects of the same language , or just separate languages ? 
  i remember , some years ago , asking for a norwegian phrasebook in a small bookstore in norway , and the owner ( a middle-aged man ) always referred to it as `` scandinavian language '' . 
  edit : ignore this comment , too many inaccuracies . 
  but / u/charmach90 is right , in western catalan dialects , and in valencia in particular , they do n't have the voiced `` s '' phoneme ( / z / ) and only use the 5 acute vowels that spanish uses , not the 7 or 8 used in other catalan dialects . 
  so yes , from a distance , it sounds like spanish with catalan grammar and vocabulary . 
  i had to look it up : * a hot arab girl from north africa . 
  commonly used in france . 
  * https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=beurette, 
  can jo\u00e3o be used for girls ? 
  i had an english teacher with that name . 
  she was born in south-africa , but her family had a portuguese background . 
  in catalonia , short names are becoming more trendy : most popular names ( 2016 ) : for girls : martina , julia , laia , lucia , emma , maria , aina , paula , noa , carla for boys : marc , alex , mart\u00ed , hugo , biel , eric , jan , nil , pol , pau source : [ 1 ] ( http://interactius.ara.cat/noms-nen-nena-catalans/ ), 
  same happened years ago with cigarette-shaped chocolates . 
  i do n't know if these policies are really useful , but it 's not a big deal anyway . 
  most of it , like 80 % of the words , but i have to really pay attention . 
  and that 's because it 's a formal setting and he speaks clearly . 
  i prefer [ this one .

   biking home from work do you have some kind of superpower ? 
  i rode my bike today at 5\u00ba and almost regretted it . 
  pineapples from spain ? 
  well , not from one day to the next , but we should aim for it . 
  happy cake day !, 
  how can public transportation be more expensive than commuting by car ? 
  that defeats its purpose . 
  i did a quick math , and going to work to barcelona everyday costs less than half if i took the train + subway than if i drove by car . 
  and that 's without counting the cost of parking all day . 
  we kinda did that already . 
  had civil war . 
  country ruined for a few decades . 
  economic help from the united states . 
  economic boom . 
  new constitution . 
  however , stagnation since the 90s and finally the economic recession . 
  even better . 
  how can we be like you on this matter ? 
  the local government has been planning ways to discourage the use of private vehicles within the city for years . 
  we have a high population density which translates in a high car density [ \\ ( 6000 cars/km ^ 2 , twice as much as london \\ ) ] ( http://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/qualitataire/ca/noticia/sabies-que-barcelona-zss-la-ciutat-deuropa-amb-mzss-densitat-de-vehicles ) and the levels of pollution are concerning . 
  things like narrowing the lanes in the street and creating more bike lanes are part of this plan . 
  also creating big parking lots outside the city so people can leave their car there and take the subway . 
  * superblocks * are a more radical approach , despite many neighbours being against it . 
  in my opinion , it 's a good idea and all changes face some opposition at first , specially when the beneficial effects wo n't be seen short-term . 
  for that to work , public transportation must be a real option . 
  it already is pretty good within the city limits , but it could be improved between and within the metro area . 
  edit : oh , i forgot . 
  the city council is proposing that the most polluting cars ( mainly those build before 2005 ) [ should be banned from entering the city ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/local/barcelona/20161121/412028354146/barcelona-restricciones-coches-mas-contaminantes-2020.html ) starting 2020 . 
  only 6 % ... 
  i 'm jelly :(, 
  thanks . 
  mmm . . only the section between plasencia and badajoz is planned to open this year . 
  anyway , the article only talks about the spanish section of the rail . 
  has portugal resumed the works ? 
  any portuguese can weight in ? 
  what 's the situation of the high-speed train between lisbon and madrid ? 
  i heard that the construction was halted because of the crisis , but has it been resumed ? 
  good lord ... 
  usually yes , this area is called `` eixample '' ( `` the enlargement '' ) which is usually divided in two ( left/right sections ) . 
  but all the other [ districts and neighborhoods ] ( http://mapabarcelona360.es/carte/image/es/mapa-barrios-barcelona.jpg ) are different , and many of them started as separate villages ( gr\u00e0cia , sant andreu , pedralbes , etc. ), 
  that were integrated into barcelona once the city overgrown them . 
  so it 's quite easy to recognize every part of the city , even when you see it from the air . 
  i 've been doing that for more than 10 years now , i got used to it . 
  also , having a small garden or being closer to nature compensates , 
  you know , there 's civilization beyond collserola, 
  they renovated the stores last year or so , and now aldis here look waay classier than dia or lidl . 
  mercadona is usually a bigger type of supermarket , so i ca n't really compare . 
  now that you mention it ... was n't alcampo called auchan years ago , in spain ? 
  nice color selection !, 
  seriously ? 
  they both started with the same business level , but now lidl is a sketchy place full of weird people , cardboard boxes in the middle of the way , even weirder cashiers that do n't know how to count . 
  aldi on the other hand , has switched to a more `` hipster '' attitude and has a great selection on fresh products ( i specially love cheeses , bio products and sausages ) . 
  i had no idea there were two aldis .
