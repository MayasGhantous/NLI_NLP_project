totally agree . 
  here in spain same thing is happening , the past is been erased , rewritten , demonized or idealized to fit political agendas . 
  or at least there is significant effort been put into this , with apparent success . 
  while we should accept our past and learn from it . 
  sounds like you are missing the point . 
  there are plenty more cases , euthanasia has been legal for over 15 years in some states which is the place to look at in order to further understand its implications . 
  im not against euthanasia but i cant let empathy decide for me playing down its potential pitfalls , can you ? 
  im sorry if it did seem like i meant to direspect basques , on the contrary i happen to highly value their history and traditions . 
  ive met some and even hold dear friendship with a handful . 
  some historical events involving your people are trully formidable . 
  but nothing related to eta was . 
  bringing up secession claims on this thread , is at the very least unfortunate . 
  i can only hope you agree to that . 
  been basque is not incompatible with been spanish , in fact there was a time in which it was said none was more castillian than the basques , and well known figures like miguel unamuno embraced dearly both aspects of himself . 
  cheers . 
  ironically , thats what you just did . 
  at some point in your life , you will hopefully and most likely begin to question `` why '' . 
  good luck . 
  agree . 
  yeah !, 
  there were also aquitanians , celtiberians , iberians , lusitanians , tartesians ... until those french and spanish opressors arrived , to replace and/or enforce them . 
  or wait , perhaps those original populations evolved and trough the events of history , became who they are today ? 
  are you familiar to the terms balkanization and populism ? 
  sounds legit , lets rip a piece of france , another one from spain , and glue them together to make a new basque state . 
  while at it , based on ethnic groups , origins , historical regions and so on . 
  ireland should undoubtly be reunified , savoy segregated from france , naples from italy , flanders from belgium , shall i go on ? 
  at first glance , its only human ( empathy ) to inmediatly agree on allowing a person to legally make this happen . 
  i feel deeply moved and inclined in favor of euthanasia , but there are other aspects to consider , to ponder on . 
  one of them is its possible abuse . 
  for instance , in oregon ( eeuu ) , its already legal , and there was a case in which a woman received a letter from her insurance company refusing to pay for her chemotherapy , but offering assisted suicide instead . 
  i 'm torn about this subject , its too delicate , who draws the line ? 
  how ? 
  there is no `` easy '' here . 
  in a lush island surrounded by water teaming with fish and land that fattened pig and cattle alike , how could one failed crop cause a famine ? 
  according to british law , irish catholics could not apply for fishing or hunting licenses . 
  their pigs and cattle were sent to england to feed the british and to export for trade , while the landlords kept the fine cuts for themselves . 
  ireland was part of the british empire , the most powerful empire in the world at that time - yet the british government stood by and did nothing to help their subjects overcome this hardship . 
  in our time , an enforced famine such as this would be labeled genocide yet in the 1800s it was merely an unfortunate tragedy . 
  i dont remember the numbers but had a similar experience in switzerland , the rates are preety insane there too . 
  i 'd say its just meant to disappear , probably should have already , its sort of anachronical . 
  but its part of our ( past ) culture and shouldnt be remembered with spite . 
  the last part ( everything been always wrong at home ) sounds a lot like spain !, 
  honestly , if you cant see how wicked is your interpretation i dont think there is much else to say . 
  the treaty ceded the constructions , no land , no sovereignity , no jurisdiction and therefore no territorial waters . 
  perhaps you should ponder upon the choice of words that were used , or you can stick with your delussional bigot view . 
  no territorial jurisdiction means no territorial waters or airspace . 
  ** spain exclusively yielded the castle and the city of gibraltar . 
  ** at the end of 2008 , the ** european commission included most of the territorial waters that surround gibraltar under a marine conservation area ** known as the `` estrecho oriental '' that will be ** maintained by spain . 
  ** the uk initiated legal proceedings with the support of gibraltar , which were initially rejected by the general court on procedural grounds . 
  a 2011 appeal was dismissed , again on procedural grounds . 
  the european court of justice had again ruled against that appeal in 2012 . 
  you are asking how ** no ** territorial jurisdiction whatsoever relates to territorial waters ? 
  you forgot this part :  [ ... ] the catholic king wills , and takes it to be understood , that the above-named propriety be yielded to great britain without any territorial jurisdiction and without any open communication by land with the country round about . 
  where is the video , the proof ? 
  there is none there , besides thats from past october . 
  it claims opposition members were shooting at the police , which is hillarious because they dont have weapons . 
  maduros govt sent past week word to all the remaning embassies in vzla about the suppossed terrorism showing pictures of oppositors with hand made slingshots and calling those `` modern weaponry '' . 
  this is awesome and very informative , thanks . 
  but , but , mistery ** sources from the catalan government told the cna ** ... so it must be true . 
  i hope that includes home delivery service !, 
   number of victims still disputed : between 200 and 1,200 claimed by different sources . 
  i also made a post , credulous enough to think i could incite debate about the historical facts been disputed and controversial to date . 
  https://redd.it/67nxww maybe in another 80 years . 
  this . 
  to ( arguably ) quote bismarck : ` i am firmly convinced that spain is the strongest country of the world . 
  century after century trying to destroy herself and still no success . ', 
  im not saying otherwise , sorry if it came across that way . 
  i question its world-wide symbol relevance , taking into consideration its magnitude , wouldnt the bombing of hiroshima , among many others , better represent `` terror bombing '' ? 
  it wasnt the first either , see the bombings of madrid ( a few months earlier ) , durango or ja\u00e9n ( less than a month earlier ) : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_madrid#aerial_bombardment https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_durango https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_ja%c3%a9n its not about belittling it . 
  its about understanding why it became what it is today . 
  not everyone has a hidden agenda , my sole purpose was to invite ** civilized discussion ** about a controversial historical event , on its 80th sad aniversary . 
  you have a very strong opinion about the topic but i dont see the need to get personal . 
  hahaha , see what i mean ? 
  i didnt even say where i stand but i alrdy get downvoted . . 
  here in spain you can be proud of been basque , catalan , asturian , gallician or whatever region you come from . 
  its alright to wave flags and bump your chest for those . 
  you can even be proud of been european , or just a `` citizen of the world '' . 
  but identifying yourself as a spaniard ? 
  in public ? 
  at the very least you will raise eyebrowns , and if you dare say you are proud you are automatically a fascist oppresor . 
  im not even kidding . 
  spaniards can only feel a certain degree of national pride during worldcup and such ( and only if winning ) . 
  in the same way , opposing independence ( even if you are catalan ) turns you into a fascist anti-democrat ignorant and an enemy , which is not very popular , so most `` unionists '' remain quiet . 
   spanish unionists out in force thats not really the case . 
  im preety sure you will find more ppl using catalonian flags than spanish one in those threads . 
  besides , unlike the uk , been an `` unionist '' in spain is generally frowned upon . 
  : facepalm : reading this filled my bullshit quota of the day , have a great day redditors !, 
  oh boy , let the namecalling begin , thats gon na help your case . 
  for the last time , think for yourself , do some research , stop been a sheep . 
  there were tourists attending numerous events waving esteladas who had no idea what it actually meant , but `` it was free '' , given to them at the entrance , so they just went with it . 
  does that make the estelada absolutly meaningless ? 
  the fact that you or your buddies ignore its insurrectial background ( hell it was conceived as a combat flag ) , and pejorative meaning towards the spaniards does not make those facts go away either . 
  and please , dont pretend to lecture me or label me ( franco ? 
  really ? ), 
  just becaude ** you dont know ** the history of the symbols you use or mention . 
  im not the one hating or attacking . 
  help yourself . 
  im preety sure you didnt have the slightest clue , just like you dont seem to know the origins and meaning of the senyera . 
  im certainly not irrational nor feeling any anger . 
  i will admit i find the estelada a disgusting choice , specially since you consider the senyera to represent your nationalism .
