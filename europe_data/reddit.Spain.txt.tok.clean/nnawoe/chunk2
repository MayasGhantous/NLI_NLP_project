  i do not expect you to provide any kind or reasonning for your choice . 
  the estelada represents hate towards spaniards , its a xenophobic version of the senyera with a stain of failed comunism on it . 
  i kindly advice you to start thinking for yourself . 
  got ta love the quality of your ( lack of ) arguments . 
  you keep claiming you know things 100 % even when you clearly show otherwise , contradict yourself or discard information `` ad hominen '' . 
  besides , labeling an association of catalans who dont share your ideology as ** `` fascist extreme right anti-democratic organization full of ignorance '' ** sounds as something we could hear maduro say about opposition demostrators these days . 
  it came from combining the traditional four red stripes over a yellow field of the senyera ( catalonian regional flag ) with a blue triangle at the hoist containing a five-pointed white star , ** inspired by the flags of cuba and puerto rico ** in a clear reference to the disaster of 1898 . 
  its creator , vicen\u00e7 albert ballester used to sign vicime ( viva la independencia de catalu\u00f1a y muera espa\u00f1a ) . 
  ** the 3rd article of the provisional constitution of the catalan republic , written and approved in 1928 in cuba by the assemblea constituent ( constituent assembly ) of catalan separatism , specifically provided that the official flag of the catalan republic should consist of four red bars on a yellow field , superimposed with a white five-pointed star in a blue triangle . 
  ** https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/estelada edit : keep in mind that the op probably doesnt know the origins of his flag either . 
  was not talking about you , but the op , hes using that catalonian-cuban hybrid flag and has made clear trough his comments that he believes the independence will happen , and that the ema will remain at bcn regardless . 
  edit : i just find it somewhere betwen hillarious and delussional , sorry for the missunderstanding . 
  since you dont seem to know whats populism , and visuals tend to help : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe56ru35kfw, 
  a separatist posting about ** spain 's candidature to the new ema headquarters ** , flying over the fact that the secession movement he supports wont let this happen . 
  what a time to be alive . 
   catalan independentism is not populism . 
  how is life in denial bro ? 
  he was called `` el campeador '' ( the champion ) , `` the cid '' comes from a spanish dialect of arabic , sidi , meaning `` sir '' or `` lord , '' mostly used by the moors during his life . 
  he also fought for them . 
  oh i care , even if its just about 3000 souls . 
  im afraid there are other reasons for those sour relations , but something as insignificant as the falklands ( to the uk ) would be a preety good way to start restoring them . 
  no , i dont think that would be necessary , nor have i suggested such thing . 
  im more into integration and equality , but its not up to me anyhow . 
  im just pointing out that , according to census data , less than 25 % population declares themselves british citizens ( less than 800 ppl ) , but every single one of them becomes 200 % british as long as that keeps the little haven running . 
  you heartless bastard : shakesfist :, 
  very informative , thanks . 
  to the average redditor 's contentment all argentina had to do is bribe about 1500 voters on that given referendum . 
  not that the uk would have given up the islands as they claim but at least we wouldnt have to endure the everlasting `` self-determination '' jack of all trades . 
  do you really believe that ? 
  dont you understand that there are companies operating in the uk who also dodge regulations and taxes trough your own havens ? 
  do i really have to spell it out ? 
  couple interesting reads : https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/07/tax-haven-curse/491411/ http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-tax-havens-panama-papers-offshore-20160419-story.html, 
  the criollo elite had plenty of power and seeked more , yes ... have you even seen that link ? 
  cause however trusty that source may be , if anything , it proves my point ... dude just do some research . 
  it is indeed very complicated . 
  but to think it would have been possible to mantain those territories for 300 years without integration falls flat . 
  the black legend 's shadow is still strong however . 
  this so wrong . 
  just a few pointers you can easily fact check : 1 ) there were voceroyalties in eu too , like aragon or naples . 
  and every subject to the crown had the same rights . 
  2 ) there were american spanish ( which is how `` criollos '' prefered to be known as ) in positions of power even in madrid , the american viceroyalties were prosper and loyal to the point they made several proposals to move the king to nueva espa\u00f1a ( m\u00e9xico ) . 
  3 ) those so called juntas were all formed and proclaimed in the name of the king of spain , ferdinand vii to protect his sovereignity rejecting that of napoleon 's brother . 
  4 ) ** the spaniards were too busy fighting off the french to send `` armies '' over to america . 
  the so called wars of independence were in fact civil wars , 99 % of the royalist army were native hispanic americans . 
  ** its a far more complex matter , but overall , as you can see , the picture is a lot different than what you are sold / selling . 
  no , i dont see it . 
  ive only pointed out that you are missinformed and missinforming , once you run out of arguments you suggest im under mental stress , but apparently its me `` looking for a fight '' . 
  i really dont follow . 
  good luck . 
  well mine too , notice the ** ruin-run ** wordplay . 
  i guess i suck ar british-humor . 
  im guessing you did not shame yourself enuff history-wise and decided to randomly choose a fancy psychology term to label me ? 
  keep it up . 
  are you seriously asking ? 
  sounds like you are suitable to ruin the country . 
  actually they dont , they have a negative impact to uks economy aswell . 
  who said anything about invading ? 
  did i miss anything or are we back at 1982 ? 
  all i could read regarding invasion in this thread , was british warmongers boasting about their royal air force/navy and their so beloved nukes ... 
  the day someone came up with the pinciple of self-determination as the perfect mask to mantain colonies that thrive operating outside the law , disregarding the un and instantly gaining international support . 
  must have been glorious . 
  excuse me ? 
  seems you ignore almost two decades of civil wars ( and the events that lead to them ) . 
  also , argentina wasnt a dominion , but a part of spain . 
  anyway , not that you red a history book in your life i guess , probably better to keep it simple , right ? 
  i actually agree with you for the most part , but the uk needs to put an end to their tax haven network . 
  its far more serious ( and shadowy ) than we are lead to believe . 
  edit : then again , allowing them to operate as such is what keeps their imperial tour up : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/galleries/what-are-the-14-british-overseas-territories-and-how-can-i-visit-them/, 
  if the uk didnt allow that ** `` dodgy stuff '' ** everything would be different , and once the inhabitants enter the 21th century they may take other aspects into consideration before voting , at no point i said anything about forcibly annexing . 
  then again , its a ** colony ** . 
  and seriously , are you gon na compare catalonia and the falklands ? 
  do you even realize how ridiculous is to type stuff like that and call other ppl stupid ? 
  falklands , yet another tax haven , with a population below 3000 ppl , who will of course vote against losing ther priviledges . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/14/gibraltar-falklands-deny-logic-history i wish people would drop the `` but they want to remain brittish '' chant , its a rather cheap pretext for their indolence . 
  make those downvotes rain . 
  i live in a coru\u00f1a and im currently typing from lisbon , dude why the hell are you going north ?!? 
  dont take me wrong , galicia is really beautiful , but the weather ... 
  i think we have gone full circle more than once alrdy . 
  you are convinced otherwise , even if you dont really have a deep knowledge of the events , and you wont allow your convictions to move an inch . 
  i wasnt always so clear against independence . 
  i dedicated it time and effort , to gather enough info from both separatists and unionists , which allowed me to produce an informed opinion which is where i stand . 
  therefore i insist , look into it , you might surprise yourself , im not trying to convince you , im asking yourself to do some research because you seem reasonable enough to probably regret your words had you a deeper understanding of the situation . 
  cheers . 
  looks like we share the sentiment . 
  given the fractured nature of spain , a clean sheet is most likely in order . 
  but looking at the past is important to avoid making the same mistakes , and to sometimes rescue traditional values or formulas that worked . 
  in that regard , that imperial past had plenty of lights to be rescued , not glorified but given its rightful recognition . 
  we have to look forward , learning from the past , not denying it . 
  no , its actually about the house ( territory integrity ) and the children ( catalonians who want to stay spanish , are undecided or simply dont care ) . 
  nobody stops dissidents from leaving , but they wont since truth is by now , they alrdy live like its almost another country anyway . 
  nobody is defending non-catalan politicians , im pointing out that the whole separatism act promoved for decades by cat 's govt is a corruption facade , like a shell man 's game . 
  i suggest you look into it . 
  you dont justify wrong-doing like that , back to your analogy , if my wife was untruthfully claiming i beat her and the kids , and the jury finds out that she lied , but also finds out that i tax evaded , those are two different matters not to be messed and she is to face charges for infamous accusation and manipulation . 
  interesting . 
  so you , and all catalonians , are spanish then . 
  i hope you dont say that too often around your separatists buddies . 
  your last statement means something totally different btw , dont play smart . 
  look : being blonde is not an opinion . 
  ! = being blonde does n't dictate your opinion . 
  both are true , while having very different meanings .
