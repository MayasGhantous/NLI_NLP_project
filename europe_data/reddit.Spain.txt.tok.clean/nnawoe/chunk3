  actually , i love your analogy , cause if that were the case we are not talking about me telling my wife she cant leave me , we are discussing wether or not she gets to keep the house and the children . 
  their moto has been `` espanya ens roba '' ( spain steals from us ) , tons of antispanish propaganda and empty promises , there are probably some legit separatists with whom i 'd love to have a talk but i 've never met one , just bigots like the ones on reddit echoing cat 's govt propaganda . 
  i fully understand your self-determination reasoning but its oversimplified and doesnt take into account the corrupted nature of this secession movement . 
  also spain is a nation , even if it doesnt act like one . 
  well , i dont know where did you get that from , arent we way beyond `` imperialistic '' ideals anyway ? 
  got ta say , and i mean no offense , you should research a bit about `` la tricolor '' and the 2nd republic all together , once the 3rd republic arrives we wouldnt want it to ressemble ** anything ** from the former . 
  so , considering this is something that affects the entire country , how come the rest of spain doesnt get a say ? 
  and you fail to see that there is no win for central govt in enabling the referendum , separatists wont give up and the reason you mention will remain aswell . 
  do you even know what the reason is ? 
  it doesnt look like it . 
  yeah corruption is everywhere ( not just spain ) , and spreads . 
  fighting corruption involves taking down its facades to expose it , be that in madrid , barcelona or anywhere else . 
  i understand your point , and even share the sentiment , but who gets to vote ? 
  all spaniards ? 
  only those living in catalonia ? 
  since how long ? 
  only those born in catalonia ? 
  what are the exceptions ? 
  lets say it happens and , regardless of who exactly got to vote , unionists win : changes nothing . 
  separatists will keep at it , again and again until they win , its a neverendum . 
  its a political weapon and also a facade for their corruption , they just cant give it up . 
  being spanish is not an opinion . 
  or wait , is it ? 
  how does this works ? 
  i assume you didnt know only 25 % population were native french speakers by the time of the french revolution , and for the sake of unity of the nation , regional languages were denied co-official status . 
  he is bringing up a valid comparison since spain 's policies have been all the contrary in regards to regional languages and well , see where it leads to . 
  had france given catalan co-official status , protection , resources and so on , its not too much of a stretch to think france could be facing a very similar problem by now . 
   i only care about this issue inasmuch as i think enforcing one 's will upon people who may not want it is wrong do you realize this goes both ways right ? 
  and im not just talking about ppl like the person you were replying to , who live in catalonia and desire to remain in spain , but also about the rest of spaniards who dont live there . 
  agreed , even tho so much has been lost/destroyed . 
  a fine specimen that one ... 
  sadly agreed . 
  if that makes you feel better ... 
  just my thought :|, 
  got ta love the hypocresy . 
  these guys despise the rest of spain , the spanish language and our symbols . 
  they openly declare they dont feel spanish , their movement motto is `` espanya ens roba '' - * spain steals from us * - ( while milking central govt ) but they want to retain free social security , unemployment subsidies and everything that comes from actually been a spaniard . 
  they are just filling their pockets behind the independist facade . 
  bigots keep the heat up for them . 
  talk about milking ... 
   good news . 
  found some ** fabricated ** data . 
  ftfy, 
  you just harvested yourself a few hundred separatist enemies who cant see their catalonian ancients origins in that map . 
  good luck . 
  he looks a bit like steven seagal . 
  first and foremost , i want to condemn the horrors of war , such as the bombing of this town , depicted in picasso 's masterpiece , a tapestry copy of which is displayed at the wall of the un building in ny . 
  nonetheless , 80 years later , the events on this tragic day are still controversial and often used as a political weapon in spain . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_guernica#casualties does what actually happened to this small town justify its becoming a world-wide symbol for `` terror bombing '' ? 
  considering picasso himself refered to his creation as propaganda , wouldnt this be a historical case of tremendous magnification ? 
  thats because foreigners who study the conflict or the 2nd republic , usually have a more neutral stance , its not really about preserving an `` excuse '' . 
  prejudices and politics turn history into `` black and white '' which is so dangerous , not because of the black since nobody in his right mind wants another dictatorship , but for the white . 
  i guess that would be the iberian union period under philip the prudent . 
  my so is portuguese and im sentimental . 
  if you like it `` dark '' , i suggest the book `` tree of hate '' - philip w. powell -- just to get you started . 
  i have no interest in serbia , you are using andorra 's flag . 
  sonner or later you will realize you have been fooled , but you wont have the courage nor the stomach to face it . 
  i hope you move to andorra once the independence facade for corruption falls down . 
  thats a proper zasca , beautiful . 
  he certainly does . 
  apparently its a very flexible term , nation , perfect for populists . 
  https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/09/09/world/europe/occitanie-france-catalans.html you just dont know much at all . 
  after reading all your posts in this chain i have to agree : you have no clue what you are talking about . 
  i wonder why do you support something you know nothing about . 
  if the ideas you defend were to be taken seriously we would have hundreds of referendums and new states coming up . 
  do you know whats the legal situation of catalonian language in france ? 
  do you support the secession of that part of france too ? 
  or savoy , the basque country , etc. . 
  lets say catalonia becomes independent , but then a part of it also wants independence , and/or a city or two decide to become city-states , shouldnt those be allowed ? 
  or do we have to protect the catalonian territorial unity then ? 
  do you see where am going or are your convictions too strong to consider you might be wrong ? 
  well im actually with you 100 % , and i dont usually agree with french people so there is that . 
  you are of course right , its one of its core principles in fact . 
  it was late , and i messed up , what i meant is that no right to secession has yet been recognized under international law , which ive edited , and correlates now with the rest of the paragraph . 
  i can see that your convictions are strong but you have ignored every other point ive brought up , you keep looking at this as if spain was an aggresor and also fail to provide an alternative solution for gibraltarians on the brexit aftermath . 
  well , to begin with , the whole nationalist movement began with pujol , and its all about power , corruption and money , everything else is make up . 
  in the unlikely scenario in which catalonian ** neverendum ** ends up making it happen , its new govt will rake in higher taxes and drop uncomfortable regulations in the name of progress , while filling their pockets . 
  its not like they even bother hiding their agenda , since spanish govt total incompetence ( and corruption ) does nothing about it . 
  somewhere to start  https://youtu.be/ud-mcphjttw, 
  im with you , but sadly there are catalan separatists that are trying to rewrite history to suit their needs for independence , utretch is important in their new tale and they are supporting uk even in brussels in a very shameful display of ignorance and lack of self respect . 
  the craziest part is that catalonian independence , at least the way its been set in motion and if it ends up happening , will be a disaster for catalonians themselves above all . 
  this small article shows a vague map and provides some info , not much . 
  http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/627-holy-rock-gibraltar-the-mother-of-all-territorial-disputes it just flies over , and doesnt mention the fact that the teatry ceded no territorial waters or airspace , those were taken after under no agreement . 
  or how , in two separate ocassions , gibraltarians suffered yellow fever epidemics , requested permission to set up a campaign hospital in the neutral border ceded by spain , got it granted in good will and made its settlement permanent . 
  the airport was built during spanish civil war , again expanding illegally while spaniards were busy killing each other . 
  there is a lot more , and not everything is dark , but it certainly beats game lf thrones . 
  anyway , in reality there are no such things as totally unbiased sources . 
  you can check the facts , i have in the past . 
  cheers . 
  also , you said before '' ... and if spain wants to violate its teatry with britain ... '' , thats what i was talking about . 
  now you talk about international law and self determination , well : ** no right to secession has yet been recognized under international law ** . 
  un general assembly resolution 2353 specifically asserted that gibraltar is a colony which impinges on the territorial integrity of spain and thus on spanish right to self-determination , and that a referendum of the colonial population could not change that . 
  and even if it was , which it might , with spains consent , how is that gon na work for gibraltar ? 
  do they become another andorra ? 
  they wont be allowed to join the ue as a tax haven and they cant as a part of the uk ... 
  in the end , putting aside political hysteria , once everyone realizes their days as tax haven are coming to an end , its only logical by cultural and territorial standards that the rock is returned , in the best interest of the gibraltarians themselves . 
  so , you consider spanish ** diplomatic claims ** , for decades recognized by the un , which are based preciselly on international law , and the terms and conditions of the treaty , some of which britain has shamelessly violated , to be wrong and pose in itself an action of violation of said treaty . 
  http://www.exteriores.gob.es/portal/en/politicaexteriorcooperacion/gibraltar/paginas/historia.aspx this is spanish govt moderate official position . 
  since apparently you didnt read or give credit to the article i posted earlier , i dont think this will do either . 
  i just find it amazing how can ppl stand so firmly by their opinons when they obviously dont really have enough data , you deflect documented arguments and contradict the un ( and currently eu ) without hesitation .
