lmao !, 
  corrected it, 
  there are a few missing like occitan . 
  netflix is the pilar core of humanity !, 
  sheez !, 
  nice  why are there so many languages missing though ? 
  have you ever opened a book ? 
  that 's clearly the pope 's home . 
  san marino is hidden inside taiwan . 
  erm ... china . 
  erm ... idk !, 
  they have koalas . 
  that 's enough to say they rock !, 
  lies !, 
  that 's a picture of vatican city from space , not italy, 
  i guessed so , but it seems tinny for me ( with all due respect ofc ! ) . 
  i 'm used tahat in catalonia , a 7milions inhabitants region , msssive demonstrations go for more than a milion people . 
  wrong name, 
  well ... 
  this ** massive ** thing could be debated, 
   the eu is doing just fine that 's your vision , not mine . 
  if you wan na impose it fine , but i 'd rather have you respect others . 
  as i said earlier , ** on my point of view ** , i would n't call `` fine '' or `` positive '' holding members that call womens less smart and justify them earning less . 
  i do n't see as `` positive '' , a union that does n't bother trying to impose the compliment of human rights ( assylum on this casae ) on its members , when it does not have the direct power but it ** does ** have more than enough strategies to force so . 
  i do n't consider `` fine '' , an eu that stays with members , such as spain , that have had thousands of thortures ( without investigation ) in just a decade , +6600 if amnesty international is to be trusted . 
  i have n't said the eu is something bad , i said that its ** not enough ** and which therefore i 'm not gon na support . 
  but feel free to manipulate !, 
  i 'm the first one that supports open borders . 
  i 'm anti-eu because i belive they do n't do as much as they can , because i would go a lot further than it will really do . 
  gj downvoting before answer , btw !, 
  repeated post, 
  do n't generalize , there are both extrems . 
  i would be the first one to support a super state , but i want nothing to do with an union that i consider a passive responsible of thousands on mediterranean sea . 
  i want nothing to do with countries that call women less smart and justify them earning less . 
  and so on . 
  reasons can be quite oposed . 
  erm . . no . 
  barcelona needs a legislation against especulation, 
  ** catalonia ** - [ amazon announced its fifth imvestment ] ( http://m.ara.cat/en/amazon-in-martorelles-investment-catalonia_0_1773422722.html ) , something that see.s like if amazon had a crush here . 
  - [ spain 's popular party , acused jimmy carter 's foundation of `` being bribbed '' because of having meeted with our mhp carles puigdemont ] ( http://m.ara.cat/politica/albiol-puigdemont-reunir-se-jimmy-carter_0_1774022811.html ) . 
  they acussed hardvard of the same this week too . 
  - fillon , has [ shown support for a referendum in catalonia . 
  ] ( http://m.ara.cat/politica/fillon_0_1773422832.html ) he 's so far the second french candidate to do so . 
  - [ the german leftish party , dielinke , has supported a referendum , and shown its refusal for spanish political trials . 
  - de alfonso , one of the main responsibles of a political ideology witch hunt called * operaci\u00f3n catalu\u00f1a * , was on a comission in spain 's chamber ( thst pp , c 's and psoe tried to block ) - danish enhedslisten , [ gave support to a catalan selfdetermination referendum ] ( https://twitter.com/nvillumsen/status/849280873681833985 ) . 
  - ** spain ** - eta has finally given out its weapons to french state , since spanish one did n't even want that . 
  even french governamemt has been crutic with rajoy 's governament attitude . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39512637?ns_mchannel=social&amp;ns_campaign=bbc_breaking&amp;ns_source=twitter&amp;ns_linkname=news_central ) bbc 's premiere of when they planned to disarm . 
  - and well , general pressuposts were presented , giving even less financistion to catalonia/valencia/balearic islands than last year 's even though than the ghost milionary investments that rajoy announced s few weeks ago . 
  ( mainly old promises ), 
  and catalonia 's hollidays federation !, 
  erm ... andorra i mean, 
  but this should work for the countries that are comitting state-terrorism there too . 
  its not lost if you know where it is , duh !, 
  yet here we give subsides to francisco franco foundation . 
  smh . 
  catalan votes on europesn elections decide catalan nuts 4 ( or nuts 3 , i forgot ) seats , not danish or british ones . 
  i 'm not sure we are underestanding eachother lol edit : earlier i refered to both european parliment and state 's parliments . 
  do you even know what transitional laws are ? 
  those create an independent legal mark , which fron a jurisdictionary point of view works as a declaration of indepndence . 
  then , the hague would have to enter the dispute , due to spain 's tc lgal impotency , all together with the entrance of international community into th crisis . 
  then , those would have to opt for either a referndum or repression ( and the second one isnt as easy to sell as first one ) , hence why catalonia has focused on giving to know the process to international community would ut be boycotted ? 
  this week , spanish polls ( by ceo ) , said that there would be a +70 % of participation , and that the independence would win by +60 % thanks to this 30 % boycotting it . 
  podemos voters are a decisive secto on here , hence why its psrty is part of the * national pact for the referendum * . 
  and yed , you will sure start more political trials . 
  all ep parties have had members condemn those trials , even the epp . 
  and that 's without even counting venice 's comission statements . 
  do you know that 155 just backs imposing orders for a temporal time ? 
  not even kick a single mp . 
  plus it would be too late then , since it would be an international affair . 
  its cititzens did, 
  you have x-ray powers !, 
  you dont even get reductions to absurd , smh . 
  i 'm talking about european mps ( actually dome us ones have done it too this week ) , not spanish or catalan ones . 
  an mp from another country , will rarely interfer on other countrys crisis because it would create diplomatic conflicts , but lately , this has n't been like that at all . 
  that 's what i was trying to say . 
  sorry if i did n't explain it allright !, 
  and all unionists i know think that spain has judicial independence . 
  yet , venice comission and ocde say that it does n't . 
  so leave demagogy st home please . 
  are you really comparing crimea to gibraltar ? 
  a 98 % voted against that in 2002 lol, 
  lol ? 
  you should read less abc . 
  catalonia simply hold a ** non-vinculant ** referendum ( which independece won btw ) in 2014 and a plebiscitary elections ( won by independentists too btw ) that is why we had a 18 months road to plan a referenum and a new state . 
  but hey !, 
  if lies make you happy gl , 
  naples was part of spain and wasnt a colony . 
  and so was burgundy , morroco ... ( or is ceuta a colony ? ), 
  there are tons of examples . 
  yet , this would change nothing . 
  nor any other member . 
  yet , lots of groups duch as alde have taking hughe steps towards it . 
  and even parliments . 
  switzerland officially suported a referendum in catalonia a an answer to the crisis earlier this year for example . 
  ye , an independent catalonia out of the eu would still mean 7milion of european cititzens ( spanish constitution prevents you from lose your nationality unless you want to , so therefore you would stay european ) , so it would n't just make happy one side . 
  it wo n't be for much time though . 
  if we follow catalan parliment plans ( plans are allwayd plans ofc ) , they will aprove some transition laws , which work as a udi , so therefore , it would become an international matter . 
  lol . 
  do n't you spaniards ever learn ?
