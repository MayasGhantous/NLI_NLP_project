  and no , not on here , it has been mainly impressive peaceful manifestations ( like a 400kms human chain ) . 
  although i may say that spain would prefer violence as an excuse . 
  the have a terrorist group , called eta , which used to be really active 20 years ago ( for basque country 's independence ) . 
  earlier this week , the organitzation anounced that it will finally disband . 
  spain 's governament even refused to negotiate ( like less years of prision for those terrorists ) in order to achieve full peace . 
  but no , i live like 10 mins away from it, 
  neither did they , but for catalonia 's deal international community 's view will be the decisive part ( if a yes wins on a referendum , of course ) , and spain is screwing itself on that . 
  just a few examples : - this week , uk parliment started a comission to follow catalonia 's independence movement ( switzerland and finland did it last year ) . 
  spain 's governament started diplomatic conflicts due to it . 
  - spain started trials against catalan politicians and our former president because of not thowing back o 2014 's `` referendum '' ( they ended up banned from public office ) . 
  this made lots of ep mp 's ( from all groups ) directly support catalonia ( which on political scene is quite a lot ) . 
  - spain tried to boicot a few acts on which diplocat members ( a semiprivate company that works for catalan parliment as exterior projection of the region ) were invited , which did piss a couple of governaments . 
  and that 's leaving apart spain calling gibraltar and andorra part of their territories lol, 
  yes and no . 
  it is kind of complicated lol , but what they intend to do is create a new legal mark ( works as an unilateral declaration of independence ) , on which it would be legal to celebrate it . 
  also note that there 's division between lawyers and judges on wether a referendum would be ilegal or not . 
  the constitutional court was the one that said that it was n't legal , but last week , venice comission ( eu ) , said that this court was n't independent at all , so its kind of strange lol . 
  did n't want to add all this stuff on the comment to make it easier to underestand for a foreign person . 
  sadly i do n't think they exist due that it is n't finished yet , since it would be like explaining half french revolution ( not comparing both things btw ) . 
  there was one made in 2011 which explains the starts ( was literally the year it started ) on [ youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mshed0hlrsq ) , but its made in catalan only :( [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/60945h/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20170319/df51wr4/ ) you have a `` short '' explaining of it for another redditor though, 
  i guess you mean [ that ] ( http://photo980x880.mnstatic.com/f4c7e9228cfd4c72871c22325b96a10b/abadia-de-montserrat.jpg ) that 's a monastery , although it doesn have a restaurant , shop , etc. 
  you know , due to tourism, 
  it is , but as you can imagine , living the day-to-day on here makes it way easier . 
  let me try again : arround 2011 , catalan independence ( due to numerous reasons ) boosted from its historical 10-15 % ( which was the usual minority ) to a big movement . 
  this was seen in [ 2011 's diada ] ( http://www.ara.cat/2012/09/11/politica/vista-diada-gracia-celia-atset_772132934_12905173_1000x680.jpg ) ( catalonia 's national day ) on which about ** 1.5 milions of people ** , out of a 7milions inhabitants region , took the streets at the shout of * catalonia , europe 's new state * . 
  this was a point , that broke regional politics into a new topic : independence ( which was n't really discussed before ) . 
  catalonia started then a process on which about an 80 % of its parliment asked for a referendum . 
  spain 's central governament , though , oposed it , since they thought ( and think ) that it was ilegal . 
  in 2014 , catalonia 's governament , decided to celebrate a ** referendum ** even without spain 's aproval . 
  as you can probably guess , spain 's governament acted against it and ** declared it ilegal ** through spain 's constitutional court ( note that european parliment defines this court as non-independent ) . 
  then , some catalan political groups that had given support for the referendum , asked for it to be took down as the constitutional court asked , but other parties oposed it , so what they did was : - change its referendum aspect into what they called * participative process * , a referendum without a real impact but a symbolism that said * we , catalans , want to vote our future * . 
  - let two non-governamental organitzations hold it in place of catalonia 's governament ( was just a legal way to avoid not celebrating it ) anyways , this referendum or however you want to call it , was held , and a 40 % of the census voted . 
  the results were an 80 % proindependence and a 20 % prospain , but as i said it did n't have a real impact . 
  this , though , was a moment of break up with spain , on which catalan politicians started talking about democracy as staying with people , as giving people the change to decide by themselves , meanwhile spain 's governament started talking about law . 
  after this moment , catalonia 's parliment called for a new regional ** elections ** , which would be seen as [ plebiscitary ] ( https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/plebiscite ) between the ** yes ** and the ** no ** . 
  the results were : - an 48 % of the votes for proindependence parties - a 39 % for antiindependence parties - and the rest , an 11 % of votes , for a party that oposes independence but wants a referendum over it . 
  because of catalonia 's electoral vote system , this ended up as a parliment that had a majority of seats occupied by political parties that wanted independence . 
  also , since 2014 's `` referendum '' , catalonia 's governament focused on an exterior policy with was based on explaining what was happening in catalonia and how was everything gon na be done since then to other parliments , companies , reporters , etc. 
  they tried to make the world be as aware as they could about what was going on ( more on that latter ) . 
  anyways , this new parliment , was decided to go for independence ( hence the plebiscite ) , but since it had been won with a not-so-clear percentage ( 48 % ) , they decided to op-out for a referendum , this time for real . 
  and that 's where we are right now . 
  those proindependence parties , being aware that if they call out for another referendum it will be just another time like in 2014 , they decided to try a new path : - offer , over and over dialogue with spanish governament , which this one oposes . 
  - catalonia 's parliment has prepared three transition laws , which once aproved , will create a ** new legal mark ** , on which the referendum would be legal ( also note that they have fixed on respecting international laws ) . 
  this will kind of work as an unilateral declaration of independence , which will force ** international community to step in ** and either support spain or catalonia . 
  as you can probably guess , the clue on here , would be ** international community ** , and especially europe , hence why this fix on international projection . 
  and this is what is suposed to happen : this setember , catalonia will approve those transition laws and then call out the referendum . 
  lmk if you need info on anything else !, 
  note : nowadays , its a rural area tourism destination mainly, 
  its kinda complicated . 
  there was a test-out referendum in 2014 ( called * 9n * ) , which was banned by spain 's constitutional court . 
  then , catalonia 's governament turned it into a * participative process * , on which an 80 % voted independencw but only a 40 % voted . 
  in 20015 , catalonia held some plebiscitary elections on wether to keep going for independence or not . 
  a 48 % turned to back this way , against a 39 % . 
  there 's an independentist majority in catalan parliment , but spain 's governament still oposes it , so catalan proreferendum forces ( about a 70 % ) planned 3 laws that they call * transition laws * . 
  what are they ? 
  3 fundamental laws , designed with international law as a base , that once aproved , will create a new legislation , and therefore , have a legal msrk on which the referendum will be legal . 
  this , though , will force international community to step in and either support spain or a referendum as a key to solve the problem ( note that catalan governamemt has spent 4 years giving to know * catalan process * arround the world for it ), 
  [ sky view ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/muntanya_de_montserrat_aerial.jpg ), 
  ** catalonia ** ( spain ) - catalan independence referendum campaigns started . 
  - [ sagrada familia ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=sagrada+familia&amp;client=ms-android-samsung&amp;prmd=imvn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjhtoobzulsahwg7xqkhajfaw4q_auibygb&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=560 ) will be finished in 2026 - spanish governament announced thay it wants to ban second catalan * antieviction law * . 
  - the basque terrorist organitzation , has announced that it plans to finally disband in both spain and france , but spanish mp mariano rajoy refuses to implement any change to its immobilism . 
  - more ep mp 's are taking an step against spain for 9n referendum political trial . 
  - uk has started this week , a parlimentary group forum to openly talk about catalonia ( edtonia , switzerland and finland already have one ) - just today , the extreme right organitzation , scc , organized a manifestation ( about 1k of manifestants ) in barcelona asking for the ** article 155 ** , which wpuld be a temporal supression of catalan autonomy . 
  they also went to clap on from of a * guardia civil * officie in barcelona well known by being friendly to fascists . 
  and one human towers * colla * ( la colla de tarragona ) is gon na search for * new talents * out of +1200 students !, 
  shit !, 
  now europe will have to face refugee 's human rights !, 
  * waves sarcasm sign *, 
  you a couple of days late sir  know the `` funniest '' part of all that ? 
  that yesterday , spain 's coinstitutional court leader , on his goodbye speech , said that catalonia 's independence movemwnt could n't be resolved on courts but thru political debate . 
  you know ... after two years being one of the main responsibles of those political trials . 
  and meanwhile in spain its all for popular party but catalonia and basque country . 
  smh . 
  i said rtve . 
  a3 and t5 are seen too . 
  rtve is not only seen as a worthless channel but the biggest manipulation channel out there ( not an opinion , i 'm refering to its reporters admiting it or even regional leaders saying they would manipulate whatever they wanted , and that ofc to `` errors '' like bon jovi 's translation on camp nou ) , plus there 's a history behind catalonia-balearic/valencia tv channels sharing , which makies them closer to us than rtve . 
  love how banalized is dmeocracy term nowadays ... smh, 
  tv , 8tv and the rest of god\u00f3 channels , la xarxa , and the rest of channels with a catalan programation do the same . 
  there 's no point at wasting time on it , they affect us as much as french ones . 
  what can affect us are catalan parties primaries ( psc , csqp , cdc , erc , etc ) , so we simply ignore the rest ( not even people who watches tele5 or other state-wide channels pays attention to it ) . 
  and about rtve ... 
  there are more viewers of ib3 than rtve in catalonia to be honest ... 
  bit you 'll have to wait till 2018 , 
  and punica 's , etc. 
  catalonia 's topic , as you can underestand , is the first main topic on here , but we are n't really focused on primaries ( never been really ) from pp , c 's , psoe and podemos . 
  podemos is the one that grabs more attention ( still as secondary , due to having csqp , icv , euia and ada colau 's new party ) , on pp and psoe we just fix on ppc and psc , and c 's ... well , we 've seen enough to know that that 's rivera 's kalifat and that it wo n't change anytime soon , so we just skip it lol, 
  well , that was n't on news here tho . 
  as you can guess , mas 's trial , venice comission and spain 's try to manipulate venice comission 's report took most of the attention ( plus the worldwide scotland referendum , turkey-dutch drama ... ), 
  touch\u00e9 !, 
  urss was good economically ( coparing it to tsar 's empire ) . 
  that does n't mean he 's good , exactly as we know by the example, 
  what 's stupid is generalitzating by what 1 random dummie did . 
  is it mentioning newspapers with thousands and thousands of readers ? 
  ( abc is one of spain 's main newspapers ) . 
  if you learn to writte i 'm responding that guy generalization , not saying anything about the initial comment . 
  but oh well , when you have no drama you can just create it !, 
  as said , you are blocked . 
  1 ) this sentence is n't even mentioned on there 2 ) [ i guess pp is then fascist ? 
  ] ( http://www.publico.es/tremending/2016/12/14/el-pp-de-alella-usa-un-aguila-franquista-para-felicitar-la-navidad/ ) and that [ c 's is a party of sexists ? 
  ] ( http://www.infolibre.es/noticias/politica/2015/12/15/el_cabeza_lista_por_cantabria_equipara_violencia_machista_con_feminista_42275_1012.html ) yeah , there 's an small diference tho : they do n't have ministers that go pray every day at two fascist dictators nor [ villages that build them tributes ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2016/05/16/5739bcd2468aeb372f8b463a.html ) anyways , have fun !,
