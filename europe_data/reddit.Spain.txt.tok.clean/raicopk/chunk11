  not gon na waste time if you ca n't stop generalizating . 
  idiot people is everyowhere and with all ideiologies , if you ca n't stop generalitzation i 'll just procees to block you . 
  btw , that * espanya ens roba * is nothing but a demagogic lie spreaded by popular party and ciudadanos . 
  cdu ? 
  i guess we should mention germanwings accident ? 
  or paris terrorist attack ? 
  or abc calling catalans nazis ? 
  or a c 's member saying that catalans are like the ku klux klan ? 
  or the newspapper `` el espa\u00f1ol '' calling catalan independentists talibans ? 
  the diference would be that you are generalizing with a random duchebag , meanwhile i 'm using important newspapers and politicians . 
  pp was literally founded by a fascist, 
  how are they ? 
  just yesterday , venice comission said that what spain did ( to not face catalonia 's political problem ) , grant the constitutional court the power to ban politicians , was at the level of turkey 's court system . 
  you know ... priorities ... btw , the tsjc , initialy refused the trial , it was spain 's supreme court the one that re-opened the trial, 
  lol, 
  i 'm just saying that is really contradictory, 
  spain 's supreme court will add its word later , they have the last word , so we will see if supreme court subscribes it or it has been an autonomous sentence by the tsjc ( as it seems ) , which could make it change . 
  yeah ... although i had never even contempled it before the last attitudes madrid-barcelona , so as most of people that thinks that way , it has been something we have been forced to kind of . 
  anyways , i did n't assist to last one !, 
  did n't like the idea of having it divided in five different cities , since i though having 1.5 milions of people together was a lot stronger that this could be, 
  idk ... 
  i do n't find it really trustworthy . 
  bolivia has a 3.0 / 7 freedom rating and tunisia a 2.7 / 7 , but yet the score is lower . 
  also , with a partly free media and internet , they get on the free category . 
  or senegal , a 2.0 / freedom rating with partly free press , also counted as free . 
  ( especially as a country that prosecutes lgtb acording to the same website ) p.s. 
  syria even has a negative score . . that 's just stupid ( the negative score , which should be 0 ), 
  2014 's catalan diada ( national day ) , it represents the senyera ( catalan flag ) , and if you see merkel arround there do n't freak !, 
  there was also obama , d.cameron and other `` main leaders '' . 
  was intended to be kind of a call to international comunity [ 2012 ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/r/godo/lv/p1/website/imagenes/2012/09/12/recortada/lv_20120912_lv_fotos_d_54350113264-992x558@lavanguardia-web.jpg ) [ 2013 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_way ) [ 2015 ] ( http://ep00.epimg.net/elpais/imagenes/2015/09/11/album/1441980680_532332_1441990197_album_normal.jpg ) [ 2016 ] ( http://estaticos.elperiodico.com/resources/jpg/5/1/quinta-diada-multitudinaria-1473624339715.jpg ) note : last one , was made on five different cities . 
  those weird things you can see represented hearts that were moved at sound of music representing the heartbeat of the * five catalan republics * . 
  each city intended to represnent one, 
  which site ? 
  there 's no source on the image, 
  shush !, 
  you now have an excuse to celebrate oktoberfest !, 
  lol , that may be on main-spanish media ... over here you have mas/ortega/rigau / homs trials , millet 's trials , the vencie comission amonestating spain over its anything-but-independent judicial system ... 
  hey !, 
  you revoked some rights already !, 
  we are called nazi for saying * we want to vote * with some [ nice coloured tshirts !, 
  ] ( http://www.nihil-obstat.nabarralde.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/via-catalana-2014-11-setembre-gran-via-de-les-corts-catalanes.jpg ) and well ... 
  i wo n't even comment the fascists part lol, 
  ** catalonia - spain ** spain 's governament , threatened ( again ) with the state of exception , and a couple of days later , venice comission called spain 's judicial system anything but pretty due to the reforms that were made ( due to catalan thing ) to execute judgements by itself , to enchance reforms that gives it more powers and to even ban politicians from charge . 
  anyways , the study spain was presented on was altogether with countries such as turkey , so i think that speaks a bit about it already :3, 
  well , basically cuz without turkey 's help , the eu will have to face refugee 's human rights and ask their countries * cough * spain * cough * to do what they are suposed to do . 
  sad things , you know ? 
  why 's bolivia partly free ? 
  kinda awkward to see tunisia considered as free but not them, 
  lol !, 
  they probably have more spanish-speaker reporters that english-reporters . 
  anyways , the press conference was made for quite a few other state 's presidents too , and therefore , newspapers ca n't bring a reporter for each european language, 
  the difference is , that over there , spanish is n't a language shown through all educational levels ( as a `` must class '' , not like french , art history or german ) meanwhile it is in spain . 
  both languages are widely spoken , but english , like it or not , has inposed as what esperanto intended to be , meanwhile spanish is just another language ( as important as hindi or mandarin , yes , but far from english ) . 
  so nope , its not the same . 
  rajoy does n't even know galician , the language from wherw he comes from, 
  totally agree !, 
  i think you forgot to mention the times that us did the same ( or worse ) too . 
  you know ... casualities !, 
  after the quotation of my comment ? 
  i was just separating holocayst from soviet genocide due to them being absolutely diferent ( note that i 'm not saying amy was more important ), 
  its a genocide sinjar massacre was part of, 
  yes !, 
  sorry , * iazidites * is in my language , thought it did n't change, 
  erm ... south sudan maybe ? 
  first time un declared famine since somalia 's . 
  btw , on the second thing , spain did the same with cuba during independence war . 
  as i said , that 's no excuse for what was done , but do n't talk as if it had n't happened before please . 
  for respect to people who has/is suffering those horrors too, 
  holocaust took concentration camps from soviet russia , but that 's all you can compare between both genocides . 
  i was n't discusing if it was or was n't . 
  i 'm the first one who agrees on the horror that this genocide represents , as any other does , i was just trying to say that holocaust was n't a good comparision . 
  but well , they ignored that part and took it to the other level . 
  do you realize this was done in lots of other genocides too ? 
  i 'm talking about the comparation , not how horrible was what soviets did , we both agree on that . 
  anyways , if you keep talking about the genocide ( sexond time : i was n't taking about it ) instead of the comparision i 'll just ignore it . 
  also other regions greeted soviets . 
  people will greet anyone who frees them from an opresor . 
  so why not mention iazidites or sikhs instead ? 
  or greeks , or ... as i said , it was in efect a genocide , and it has to be threated as it , but holocaust was ( sadly ) diferent from all other genocides . 
  what i 'm talkong about its the comparison , not the fact of how horrible what was done is . 
  not everywhere !, 
  do n't you mess with my brits !, 
  it was a genocide too , but its way different . 
  i 'm sorry , but its like comparing turkish genocide on iazidites to the holocaust . 
  edit for mad people : i 'm not saying by any means that it was n't a genocide , just saying that holocaust was n't a good comparision . 
  that 's stupid . 
  they are related to it , but do n't have anything to do with it . 
  i mean ... its like if a couple is breaking up and you , as a friend of both of them want to decide about it too because it would affect you also, 
  which kind of shit ? 
  wanting your taxes to be well spent ? 
  smh ... btw , like half of madrid 's gdp comes from capital effect . 
  okay , so if i find an spaniard that calls me fascist cuz of wanting a referendum i 'm a fascist ? 
  cuz there are lots that do so too . 
  i think i have known more catalans living there my whole life than you on this subredit js . 
  `` spain robs us '' again you use another stereotipe . 
  a few people used to say this , in 2011 . 
  nowadays , the only ones that use this are ppsoec 's , so i see how much you know about the situation . 
  i 'm not trying to convince you about anything , i 'm just explaining my thoughts . 
  catalonia will accept any offer that satisfaces the region , as it should . 
  i mean , we want to get along , but let 's be honest : we wo n't be able too unless wither catalonia drops out independence thing ( not likely ) or it becomes independent ( thru a referendum ) , then spanish system is forced to be fully-reformed and therefore spaniards ( slowly ) see how pp fooled them .
