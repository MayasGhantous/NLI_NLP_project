  italy is the lower with a 2.7 and denmark the higher with a 7.1 , most of countries are between a 4 and a 6 . 
  spain 's governament subsidzes [ abc newspapper ] ( http://i42.tinypic.com/2unyjpg.jpg ) , that makes them hitler-friendly ? 
  that 's just nonsensless ... 
  wrong , those are 3k polls that have been fluctuating from 40 to 48 % since 2013 as it happened from brexit before the vote . 
  if you want a real support `` proof '' just check 27s results , on which 70 % of elegible catalans voted , a 48 % of support against a 39 % , and a 11 % that did n't define itself ( which gathers people from both options ), 
  that 's butthurt people ( and that goes to both sides btw lol ), 
  1 ) it has not been 18 months yet , those 18 months yet , just a year passed by , and everything on their route paper has been done but the referendum , which wo n't be `` official '' till transition laws are approved . 
  2 ) 2014 's was n't a referendum , since when it was banned by spain 's court , the organitzation was dropped from catalonia 's parliment to private entities ( anc and omnium cultural ) , this time ( acording to politicians , we will see ) they inteend to builda new legality to make it relevant . 
  also , they are negociating with lots of other sectors ( such as catalonia 's pirate party ) in order to include them . 
  we will see if its celebrated or not , and if it is celebrated if it turns out to be a vinculating referendum or just another `` 9n '' , but please remember that those 18 months started in january of 2016 , when the catalan pm carles puigdemont was elected ( from 27 of september elections ) . 
  first of all , i 'm a catakan and pro-independence , so my view on if it should declare independence unilaterally is clearly a yes ( with a won referendum first ) , but the miltary intervention , is n't really a plausible scenario . 
  not too long ago , an spanish exgeneral said that neither spain had rescoursces nor soldiers to occupy catalonia , and apart from that : i doubt spain would like internatioal community to have that view of them . 
  this would , though , depend on international community 's intervention on an hipotetical breakup . 
  would they opose it ? 
  or recognize the referendum ? 
  i belive they wuld simply adapt ; some would be faster on it and some wiould be really reticent , but would end up adapting . 
  also note , that catalan parliment has some `` transition laws '' ready for the referendum , which are an independence declaration that would build a new legal mark ( following international law ) in order to celebrate the referendum and therefore build ( or not ) te new state, 
   ok . just if the independence wins the referendum . 
  right ? 
  he said the referendum will be validant , yes , vut it also works the other way arround . 
   is n't article 155 supposed to create an organism to replace the funtions of the organzations of the region but without disolving them ? 
  no , it just gives the central governament power to make catalan governament apply their laws , but ca n't kick a single mp . 
  it has never been applied thpugh , so there 's quite a lot confusion about it : there are even lawyers that defend ( idk if this part is true ) that due to the central governament not having tools to kick a single mp , the regional governament could keep blocking those laws and reforms , converting 155th article into a political freeze till its all sorted out . 
  they should be in prision , as well as half of popular party ( spain 's pm included ) , spain 's ruling party . 
  or are some xorrupts bad but not others ? 
  hipocrite ... 
  yyyyeaaahh ... and c 's would win municipal elections in barcelona too !, 
  keep dreaming mate , keep dreaming lol, 
   puidgemont has said he will declare unilateral independence no matter what not true  the goverment will be forced to revoke the status of autonomous community and take care of catalonia directly . 
  they do n't have power to actually , not even article 155 gives this power . 
  2014 's was a nonbinding participative process aimed at sending international community a * we want to vote * message ( it was n't even hold by public entities but two ngos ) , which was followed with 2 years of explaining what 's up in catalonia to the international community . 
  this one , is ( suposed to at least ) going to be vinculant , and will be backed by three secret transition laws that catalan governament has prepared already , which are suposed to create a legal back for functionaries . 
  was already posted today p.s. 
  if you want a personal advise , i dont recomend you posting about catalan independence here , you will get a bunch downvotes !, 
   ( or better saying , nationalists from barcelona ) according to polls about an 80 % of catalans want a referendum , but whatever ...  are taking nearly as a certainty that catalonia would remain in eu . 
  well , there 's simply no precedent , so what happens has n't been worked out . 
  i 'm personally not proeu ( long history ) , so i dont care about it , but that 's why catalan governament has been pressing spanish governament . 
  if they agreed on a referendum , we would have an official stance took by the eu , but as its logic , they wont take any official stance ( no matter which one it is ) once the decision is already done ( if its done ) . 
  whatever happens to the uk wo n't be the same than what would happen to catalonia , no matter if its better or worse . 
  every region is its own , and gets dealed on its own way . 
  seeing brexit would n't change anything at all but the `` wait '' excuse ( there 's allways thing happening that affect us one way or another ) . 
  a referendum does n't mean independence , both options are called in . 
  its simple , lets expose what every side thinks and let 's decide . 
  there would be no point on waiting from my point of view !, 
  why wait though ? 
  i mean , if you take a decision , take into account all possible scenarios , but why would we have to wait ? 
  simply take a decision and stick with it . 
   did the catalan province not ban bull fightings in the streets and the spanish king and goverment basicly said no ? 
  first , we are not a province lol . 
  yes , we banned it quite a few years ago , and earlier this year , spain 's constitutional court banned it saying that it was incunstitutional ( canary islands have had banned it for arround 30 years and it hasnt been considered inconstitutional so far ) . 
  even with that , though , the catalan governament says that its still ilegal ( idk if there has been any bullfighting celebration since then ) . 
   but was n't it franco who appointed the next king and gave that king the abilty to have full power ? 
  wich also includes the power to rule the army ? 
  franco was n't a king , he was a fascist dictatorship , but yes , he designed spain 's exking as his successor , but i do n't think he had any power over the army ( spanish congress does if i 'm not worng ) . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticies/manifest-pep-guardiola-referendum-1-octubre-catala-castella-angles-anc-omnium/ ) you have guardiola 's speech . 
  you know ... 
  in case you want to know what he said before commenting ... p.s. 
  he made the speech in catalan , spanish and ** english ** . 
  [ and here 's spain 's pm with arabia saudi 's absolute monarch ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8363/8286687463_024a0fb453_b.jpg ) . 
  the point ? 
  then i guess ( for example ) you consider spain as a country that commited a genocide during colonitzation ( as the rest of colonial states ) ? 
  because considering brits as nondemocrats because not fighting franco but not doing that with spain is really hipocrite, 
  do you realize that the uae is built by seven constituentmonarchies ? 
  uae head of governament is a ** primer minister ** , the other monarchies are absolute monarchies , so its not the same than oman and arabia saudi ( or brunei ) by any means . 
  as i said earlier , this does n't make it any better , but its simply not the same kind of governament . 
  its like comparing pears with apples, 
  i guess you blame french for not helping either ? 
  and tunisians ? 
  and americans ? 
  and protuguese ? 
  man , i guess you can only travel to russia and ex-soviet countires ... 
  exactly , federal . 
  its as undemocratic as arabia 's saudi 's one , but its not the same . 
  they do quite often on here . 
  i honestly think this sub 's opinion about scotland is like a `` vendetta for brexit '' . 
  otherwise there 's no logic on it . 
  well , its not like [ spanish governament respects its constitution either ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.es/2013/12/05/articulos-constitucion-no-se-cumplen_n_4384451.html ) ... 
  y' all are evilness !, 
  gibraltar is the same way even if a 98 % deci ... nuthin ' !, 
  more likely after spain 's constitutional court blast sentence over catalan * estatut * . 
  not our fault they spent years to dodge the effect of it on electoral results ... 
  or not !, 
  lets just find out with the only possible way , a referendum edit : r/spain crew group-downvoting again lol, 
   and i 'm against that . 
  glad about it !, 
  just did n't get the initial comment point tho . 
   not a democracy anyway , but i was pointing the uae . 
  not the uae either the only absolute monarchies in middle east are arabia saudi and oman , the ones , that are currently destroying yemen and yemenies p.s. 
  there 's some people that 's mad areound here . 
  that downvoting ... lol, 
  and spanish governament has plenty of relations with arabia saudi , a ** real ** absolute monarchy ( qatar is not btw , just a monarchy ) . 
  what 's the point ? 
  as you said , money is money . 
  most of people was from barcelona today lolshall i remind you that podemos is based on both unionists and independentists ? 
  you will find them in catalan , spanish , french , occitan , basque , english ... its simply a way of saying that its an inclusive independentist movement . 
  plus well ... not like barcelona doesnt have tourists !, 
  oh , such a lovely sentence !, 
  we love you too !, 
  none sweetheart , none, 
  christianity only exists in europe now ?
