  how ? 
  have you even read it ? 
  here you have article 1  all peoples have the right of self-determination . 
  by virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic , social and cultural development . 
  yes , and ? 
  where does it say that its subordinated ? 
  helsinki accords ** are n't neither binding nor are a treaty ** , so the iccpr is the primal law on this case . 
  well , the only international law that we have quoted so far . 
  definitely not my day !, 
  erm . . nope , sorry . 
  im talking about the ** international covenant on civil and political rights ** , if you say there 's territorial integrity international laws that get over this one , quote those convenants . 
  its really simple . 
  wikipedia may be great for some things , but on that its worthless . 
   for every recommendation such as that you can pull up a bunch of international norms and precedents prioritizing territorial integrity over self determination . 
  quote me an international law article that does so . 
  btw , no newspapers article , go to the threaty , conveny or whatever and quote it from there . 
  i do n't need biased views . 
   break up of a state has to be justified enough to be accepted as a unilateral act by the breakaway territory yes ? 
  and where does international community define how 's it ( or not ) justified ? 
  lol ? 
  we speak english too !, 
  we even hace another subredidt only in english ( r/catalonia ) but this one is more active , so i usually simply recommend going to r/catalunya . 
  its not a `` conversation '' , its a post on which people can post comments . 
  you can comment giving support or exposing your thoughts on the topic, 
  again . 
  as ** the article says ** , he speaks about [ un non-self-governing territories ] ( http://www.un.org/en/decolonization/nonselfgovterritories.shtml ) , not self-determination , which is completely different . 
  heck , according to that not even puerto rico , lativia or bosnia has the right to self-determination ... 
  why ca n't he give his support ? 
  wtf is that ? 
   the eu will not allow catalonia to leave the eu even if it wants lol !, 
  if they let the uk leave they can work it out without catalonia . 
  but i doubt neither the eu nor catalonia would at lwast manage economic colaboration threaties . 
  especially when catalonia is part of the mediterranean corridor . 
  if there had been a way a few years ago to rework the relation catalonia-spain ... 
  wait !, 
  lol , this is not needed man . 
  there are unionists that are against that `` monarchy '' too . 
  besides quoting me an interview ( without audio ) on which ban ki mon refers to the * un non-self-governing territories list * ( something absolutely different ) , what about if you link me a #resolution passed by the un and not a guy who has no power to decide such things ? 
  acording to that list , neither kosovo , nor lithuania , finland , bosnia , albania , etc had the right to self-determination . 
  man , there 's even a [ link ] ( http://www.un.org/en/decolonization/nonselfgovterritories.shtml ) to the list ... at least read your own souces ? 
  according to venice comission referendum legitimacy recomendations for example ? 
  heck , our pm even contacted with them earlier this month to let them know we were fixing on their guidelines . 
  `` the law of the land '' lol !, 
  as i said , yes , we know that independence would be an economic hit for both regions . 
  and we both would survive . 
  but the deal is not economy , its the mix up of a lot of other things that convince us . 
  the republic part was something that the * comuns * wanted . 
  it was included so they felt more part of it . 
   or countries part of a dictatorship , lol !, 
  go back to school . 
  let me quote you the ** international covenant on civil and political rights ** : part i article 1 1 . 
  all peoples have the right of self-determination . 
  by virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic , social and cultural development . 
  -----------------  not for rich regions that do n't want to redistribute wealth . 
  you know ** nothing ** about catalan independentism , do you ? 
  why would they want to be in the eu if thwy did n't want to help other regions ? 
  its a region that gives more than it recives . 
  man , i think you have seen to many apocalypsis tv shows ... 
  it will be an economic hit ? 
  yes , for both catslonia and spain , but there are more important things than economy . 
  especially when what we call ecobony is basically on a 4 % of the people . 
  and not really , it does have good things for the eu too . 
  catalonia has actually been an important factor fpr peace on basque country and corsica , and its being seend quite close on kurdistan . 
  nothing is black or white, 
  podem on this case , silly me !, 
  if im not wrong , cec will stay away from the referendum , so it will be the earlier parties the ones that will have to indivudually decide . 
  you independentist !, 
  how `` damaging '' is catalan independentism ? 
   after all catalan people look at us as [ example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_way ) but we dont pay copyright !, 
  hehehe jokes apart !, 
  we do love yall !, 
  that 's the sad part lol . 
  i mean , rajoy has said no to a referendum , but also said no to more autonomy , a better financment , recognizing catalan as official ... or well , like when sanchez offered to recognize catalonia as a nation without recognizing selfdetermination . 
  idk if they see us like idiots or what but i 'm still unable to underestand it . 
  by fluid you mean 3/4 of the parliment being held by the historical bipartidism plus pp 's puppet party , c 's ? 
  it wasnt approved . 
  shall i rember that zapatero , after saying the mythical `` aprovar\u00e9 el estatuto que los catalanes voten '' voted against it ? 
  they defended some parts , yes , but that 's not accepting what catalans voted . 
  actually , it was what zapatero did that triggered more . 
  cuz lets be honest , pp was even founded by a fascist dictatorship ministerz we know who they are , but psoe ( and psc ) were a traditional force in catalonia . 
  it felt like a kick on our parts . 
  meanwhile , no german party has made an official statement against a referendum, 
  catalonia is a proeu region , so yes , they would seek to join the eu ( or efta in case spain vetos it ) . 
  its not a matter of sovereignity if you ask so . 
   voter turnout of more than 60 % is not enough . 
  let 's do the math : let 's say you get 70 % yes , 30 % no , and the turnout was 60 % . 
   then by pure math , you can only say `` at least 42 % of catalonians support independence '' ( because 70 % of 60 is 42 ) . 
  that is still below 50 % approval . 
  this is just dumb . 
  as i said , there are parts of both sides not willing to vote , so you ** ca n't ** count abstentions on any side . 
  a 40 % is n't legitimate because half of the population doesnt vote , no matter which opinions they have , but if a 60 % ( for example ) votes , its ** is ** legitime , due to having a participation as high as most of referendums and elections across the world . 
   and that 's if you agree that 50 % support is enough to go for independence , which is n't really clear : people could argue that such a major move should need a high majority , of 2/3rds or whatever . 
  this was an offer that catalan governament did to madrid : choose the date , question , participation and results needed ... not our fault they said no . 
  catalonia has independentist parties and ngos that call for boycotts too as they did with 2014 's participation process . 
  as i comented myself earlier , i 'm independentist and did n't vote in 2014 . 
  if there 's a 60 % turn out , it will become legitime , of course , it would n't if the turn out was a 40 % , but if polls are to be belived it will be more thsn that . 
  not you !, 
  i know who 's downvoting , its allways the same crew , was simply pointing at them with the edit my apologizes if it seemed like i refered to you !, 
  erm ... nope . 
  threaties are already done , only efta members accept ( or not ) new members .
