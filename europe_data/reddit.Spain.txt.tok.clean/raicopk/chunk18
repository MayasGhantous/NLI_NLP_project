  and yeah , china just has 1bilion more of inhabitants than catalonia . 
  small details !, 
  if it was that this way , brexit would n't be a thing, 
  on your country , die linke already has , 
  really ? 
  man , what would you say if i linked you ladirecta ? 
  sabadell said it , yes , but later on said they would n't . 
  they simply say whatever is better for them on the moment . 
  1 ) since the start , 9n , was defined as a participative process , mainly because political wprds were n't as deep as nowadays : heck !, 
  we did n't even speak about selfdetermination but `` right to decide '' !, 
  2 ) no , it was n't held by catalan governament . 
  it was hosted by private entities , anc and \u00d2mnium cultural . 
  3 ) not a single officer worked on it , it was held entirely by 40000 volunteers that the anc had . 
  norway has actually holded ( all together with diplocat ) quite a few debates about catalan indepndence . 
  there has n't been any official stance , so its unknown what would they do . 
  why mention la caixa ? 
  we have multinationals that are a lot more important such as gr\u00edfols . 
  and source abou la caixa 's statement ? 
  never heard that . 
  and even more , one of the things that catalan governament has prepared in case the yes wins , is the foundation of the `` banca p\u00fablica catalana '' ( catalan public bank ), 
  the eu has n't made any official statement on it atm . 
  all statements have been personal , some against it , and others ( such as die linke 's ) for it . 
  anyways , there 's only one way to find out . 
  switzerland , an efta member , offered its parliment to `` show direct democracy '' to spain . 
  and i do n't think that 's dumb !, 
  not a kingdom either guifr\u00e9 el pil\u00f2s united catalan counties , but it was a weird union !, 
  sadly not the ruling party . 
  when they opposed any kind of dialogue earlier this year when eta presented the start of its disolution process i honestly wanted to slap rajoy . 
  i mean , leave ideologies apart , we are talking about putting the end to a long-time violent conflict !, 
  polls , if they are to be belived , show that arround a 70 % would vote . 
  anyways , there 's only ** one ** way to find out . 
  ther rest we can say are merely expeculations . 
  simply no one lol . 
  the hague will have to step in , but nowadays , psoe is as far as c 's ( and belive me , i hate to say that ! ) . 
  and yeah , even sanchez is totally oposed to it . 
  politicians here have n't done it because of that either . 
  heck , our proindependentist governament is built by a coalition from right-wingers ( centralists for europe ) , leftists and far-lefts !, 
  there 's an extremelly wide view about it . 
  the spanish governament has no power over it . 
  only the member states , which spain is n't , and they have bewn quite keen with catalonia lately . 
  you might be a really optimistic person, 
  catalan estatut simply aimed for autonomy , it was aproved on referendum by catalans , but it was banned ( thanks to popular party collecting signatures across spain `` against catalonia '' - this is how it was seen , not presented as that tho ) because of being inconstitutional , while the same inconstitutional articles were later on accepted on * andalucia 's estatuto * . 
  this was a triggering moment , that made part of catalonia think that a catalonia within spain was n't possible anymore . 
  and why not ? 
  would love to see your arguments  edit : guess people loves debating ? 
  lol, 
  meh , we will go to efta then, 
  i may recomend you to not waste time with this user , just check his post history . 
  heck , he even called us indoctrinated on another post awhile ago !, 
  you know ... neutrality, 
  well , the alternative to the constutution was a fascist dictatorship again . 
  would n't you had signed it ? 
  the same spanish governament [ does n't follow it ] ( http://m.huffingtonpost.es/2013/12/05/articulos-constitucion-no-se-cumplen_n_4384451.html ) . 
  linked you a huffington post article about it . 
  edit : typos . 
  gosh , how am i typing today ? 
  yeah , but its a quite wide topic , so thought i 'd say that it required quite a bit more of explanation heck !, 
  even ( personally ) being able to really welcome refugees is a decisive factor for me !, 
  and y' all go next !, 
  if you think catalan nationalism is that way you know nothing about catalonia . 
  polls ( made by unionist catalan newspapers la vanguardia and el peri\u00f2ric ) asked for a referendum summoned by catalan governament , so it does n't mattee on that result . 
  ( also , let me add that there are lawyer associations that defend that its legal within spanish constitution ), 
  there 's a lot more : language , politics , povs , the conception we have of spanish state ( not spaniards ) ... 
  if you want to see our point of views , i encourage you to come post at r/catalunya , you will be extremelly welcome !, 
   ( there you will get more answers than on here since there are more catalan redditors hanging out ) ), 
  whole independence process has been peaceful , and it will stay this way , so nope . 
  if polls are to be belived a 70-80 % of catalans want the referendum , so i guess not . 
  anyways , there 's only one way to know and no , 2014 's vote was defined as participation proceds from the start . 
  not really . 
  polls nowadays show that a 70-80 % want to vote , so it wo n't be a low-participation referendum . 
  i , for example , refused to vote in 2014 ( as an independentist ) because it was neither a referendum nor was held by public institutions . 
  actually , the closer thing to a real prediction were the plebiscitary elections of 25th of september of 2015 , where a 48 % voted yes ( jxsi ) , a 39 % voted no ( pp , psc and c 's ) and the other 11 % , voted csqp , a party that defined itself as neutral ( its proreferendum and holds both independentists and unionists ) . 
  fun fact : csqp , will decide its posture on the referendum today through a militant vote . 
  edit : i guess the downvotes are because you do n't like the results ? 
  60 % negative ? 
  there has never been such a poll , all have been fluctuations arround 45 % for each option, 
  not * un paso adelante * for sure i have never been such a fan of spanish tv shows but for those `` story-less comedies '' such as two men an a half ( for a mainstream example ) , so wo n't be much help on those sorry lol . 
  * las chicas del cable * , is a netflix spanish show , which some people said was promising , but do n't personally know about it . 
  anyways , for catalonia you do have from * plats bruts * ( only in catalan , but avaliable on youtube and tv3 , our public tv website ) to merl\u00ed ( kind of like netflix 's rita , avaliable in catalan , spanish and soon in english , netflix bought its world rights ) . 
  what kind of shows do you prefer ? 
  if it works on here good for you !, 
  just thought i 'd say in case i could give a habd with it, 
  r/askeurope might get you better answers , 
  what ? 
  lol, 
  lol ? 
  i 'm a man and i 'm ok with this measure . 
  being a twat in full public transports is n't okay . 
  this affects both men and women , not just one gender, 
   bombs explode . 
  trucks run over people . 
  rampant stabbings happening if it was for that , no legislation could had been passed during the last centuries in europe ...  europe is being over flooded with illegal migration . 
  spain ? 
  not really ... just 900/17000 refuges ( eu quota ) , which ** are n't migrants ** have been accepted so far , so nope, 
  actually , this was a mix up that this guy made from the reat title and the first paragraph ( `` madrid has moved to ban ` manspreading ' on its public transport system after feminists convinced the city 's left-wing council that men invading the space of others with their splayed legs was a problem that needed to be tackled . '' ) . 
  but yeah , i agree anyways , i wonder how did madrid politicians resolve all the city problems in order to move to politics like these one !, 
  lol , trump is a business man , so nope , if anything , he will likely end up promoting researches in order to gain money . 
  he is a jerk , sexist , racist , but not an idiot , nor are the other members of his party ( afterall he 's not omnipotent ) . 
  one thing is campaign and another one what 's done later on . 
  no , you added it so it fits your `` ideology '' , just need to check your post history .
