  also , of you add the first paragraph , why just add the parts you like ? 
  why not add all the paragraph ? 
  not like its really long ... 
  there were quite a few posted with different sources , just do a short search before posting ? 
  its not a `` feminist measure '' , this affects women too ( although of being less frequent ) . 
  but yeah , idk how it will work out . 
  i see, 
  do n't take my word because i have no idea about it , but i 'd say urbanism, 
  and why do you think so ? 
  either that or results based on his search history, 
  1 ) the title is just `` madrid bans ` manspreading ' on buses '' 2 ) this was already posted yesterday 3 ) although being less frequent , this measure affects women too , so its not a one-gender measure . 
  lol ? 
  i dare you to find another single comment of mine saying that !, 
  its callef geography , turkey is considered a part of asia , its not me saying that it should or should not be part of it . 
  chill ? 
  it was just a joke , you are the one that ca n't even take a joke . 
  only instanbul is european . 
  like 95 % is ** geographically ** part of asia . 
  just hit an atlas man . . 
  turkey isnt part of europan continent ... 
  cerd\u00e0 * you are spanish . 
  you should know what rhat word without the accent means lol 2 . 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/znxiyl2.jpg ) you have the original plan by idelfons cerd\u00e0, 
  [ it does n't ? 
  they were two blocks per square . 
  it wasnt till companies seen profit that there were three layers ( and later four ) . 
   besides , all the blocks had to have a garden/park inside , in order to create green spaces for everyone . 
  did n't i just say that ? 
  130 years , sounds like something else from our lovely eixample, 
  i 'm not talking about xxith century , im talking about its ** original ** design , which inxluded shops too , the vision that there was of them by then . 
  it was a zone made ** for ** people . 
  yeah , descriminalizing domestic violence was n't worse !, 
  smh, 
  but putin is russian !, 
  lol , now seriously , both of those sexists should be out of power , but they are n't the problem , the problem is why they actually get those votes . 
  great , someone fighting sexism with sexism !, 
  * facepalm *, 
  i cant even tell if you are serious ... 
  not really . 
  sexism ca n't fight sexism . 
  if competent people , no matter their genere , were in charge , the world wpuld be a better place . 
  not l'eixample , it was designed all at once . 
  not true , the green zones were designed for urban life , but the companies thst were buildong the house , later on , keept building ( on the two sides that were n't intended to be built ) in order to win more money , not because it was a waste but because they could exploit it more . 
  not the city 's , only the eixample is that way . 
  fun fact : only two sides of those squared were planned to have buildings , the rest had to be green zones for its inhabitants , but people saw money and ... well !, 
  as someone from catalonia , there 's no one here that has n't been there for at least one weekend . 
  it is a nice place !, 
  i mean , its not london , but ... and yes , they used to not pay * direct * taxes as far as i know , but not anymore . 
  still lot less than we , europeans , have had to learn from tho . 
  anyways , as i said , racism on x place does n't justify racism , neither on asia nor europe , neither america nor africa . 
  no one considers it normal . 
  but its nonsensless to ask for x country to not act racist if your own country ca n't do the same . 
  also , europe , has quite a lot more experience from which to learn of than for example sudan does . 
   also i 'm whiter than cream but i 'm romanian and i 've been an immigrant since i was a child . 
  i experienced racism and discrimination a lot . 
  no need to be black to experience it . 
  racism is n't a thing that affects `` black people '' only ... 
  racism somewhere else is n't an excuse to be racist . 
  ( btw , i 'm not commenting on that `` study '' ), 
  actually searched it the other day . 
  it appears to be a tribute the architect wanted to make for montserrat and antoni gaud\u00ed ( u/gerardpb2 in case you want to know too ), 
  that 's not what they have been voted for , so nope . 
  they did n't add restrictions to airbnb , they added them to especulation . 
  none . 
  would n't even consider it . 
  security is n't an excuse to cut people rights . 
  lie ... well , yeah , you got us ... and municipal water was managed inside before !, 
  i do n't think europeans have been hidding at home the last centuries . . 
  the map on the bottom right of the image ? 
  the one that shows europe * facepalm *, 
  12 replies ? 
  really ? 
  i dont think it matters of its european or not . 
  historic patrimony should be respected everwhere, 
  nope . 
  that map is missing kosovo . 
  edit : guess some serbians are arround ? 
  agreed !, 
  they are banned in half catalonia actually !, 
  ( and hope on whole cat soon ! ), 
  i guess you mean `` correbous '' the word you used dowsnt even exist in spanish , and they have been banned in half catalonia already too ( by local governaments ) , vic , for example , decided it thur a referendum . 
  but yeah , i agree , should be banned everywhere , ** without exeption ** , if someone wants to torture an animal for fun there are psicologists for something . 
   catashit such a neutral guy you sound , huh ? 
  why is turkey there ? 
  and why is australia missing ? 
  spp ? 
  the right-wing sindicate that exercited as popular acusation on the political trials against our former president and two current mps because of organizing a non binding vote ? 
  seems neutral !, 
  anyways , they can go back to their homes then , we have our own police body for something ... 
  lol , just check how that salty forocoches troll replied . 
  a lil bit more and called me 3 % !, 
  i 'm not gon na consider okay having an 18 % of enmpoyment ( or 16 % , for us , still a ** lot ** ) , especially during summer , when most of them are shitty , temporal jobs !, 
  can you ? 
  #impressive im talking about the nonsense of calling a decline impressive when there are still almost 4milions jobless . 
  were n't you saying the other day you `` didnt give a fuck '' about what i said ? 
  then stop commenting on my posts . 
  at least do n't be an hypocrite . 
  most of them are temporal jobs due to tourism, 
  either there will be not much working hours ( as it changed thru other industrial revolutions ) or we would switch to an universal rent , which is actually being used on some places already . 
  again lol , this has nothing to do with being catalan !,
