  you peeps are the ones that lost more territory on world 's history ( and still at it ) . 
  work is already done  erc and pdecat ( cdc doesnt exist ) will be back to normal forms after the referendum as it should , but we will have decided : * and nah , im not marking as i didnt mark those from junker when slovenia was to become independent . 
  ( waves the actual eu member ), 
  you will see , 
  well , i dont perdonally support eu , so its not bad for me ( i do n't mainly cuz i refuse to work with mps that call woman less smart or with countries that font respect asylum human right , so not brexit-alike reasons ) , but yeah , pretty negative for most of catalans . 
  anyways , this region , although being tinny , its a neto contributor and a needed region for mediterrsnean corridor ( which eu already paid for ) , so i guess ( we will see later tho ! ), 
  that maybe efta could be an option, 
  it will be announced in june . 
  they are gon na approve three `` transition laws '' before anouncing it , but it has already been said thst it will be arround the second week of september . 
  if the referendum is successful , yes , it would leave both ( note that most of catalans support thw eu , so doubt there would n't be any kind of agreements for some colaboration till something is worked out on long run ) . 
  would it be unilateral though ? 
  acording to the hague on kosovo 's case , unilaterality does n't exist when one side refuses to negotiate . 
  its holding a vinculant referendum , so pretty like it . 
  anyways , seems he got piseed at my comment lol, 
  it is !, 
  wo n't after september tho, 
  * raises hand * wait ... 
  does google maps count ? 
   rocky pfft , i knew you wanted to talk about gibraltar !, 
  neither from spain, 
  as acurate as a monkey bum drawing, 
  dont mix those up then . 
  and btw , i already answered you . 
  it uses an ** open source ** ( g maps ) on which if someone doesnt like its commerce to show up they can remove it . 
  goohle maps tos is not a `` for whatever i wsnt '' thing , its a ** take it or leave it ** . 
  the main title says it . 
  do n't need to read too much . 
  okay , explain me ** how can defending the use of two languages be xenophobia but not the imposition of one ** . 
  seriously , i do n't get it . 
  did you even read catalan codi de consum linguistic articles ? 
  if not just screw off . 
  last one was the ( second ) fake quote, 
  well , this would be pretty long to explsin , but here goes a * short * summary : to start by , estatut 's throwback ( with psoes backstab and pp searching for signatures * against catalonia * ) was a hit , yes , but it was just an explosion of lots of things . 
  by then , i still was n't an `` independentist '' . 
  i thought we needed a referendum to solve it out , but would had probably voted no on it . 
  yet , spain did n't only keep up with a constant no , but some of its sectors started calling us names ( from nazis to talibans , , from ku klux klan members to terrorists , from nondemocrats due to requesting a referendum to ... well , all kind of things ) . 
  also , note that those were not only idiots but first line politicians and newspapers . 
  i personally would suport a bigger state , hence why i would be willing to independize and a day later join the uk ( only one example ) , or absolutely support an european super state . 
  just , not at any price . 
  not at the price of not having a democracy . 
  not at the price of renouncing rights . 
  and well , after that , all spain has done has just convinced me even more about it . 
  from spending my taxes into building fake proofs for political tries , to ministers , feeling proud of `` having destroyed catalan sanitary system '' . 
  so ... nowadays the question would be more lilely . . why not ? 
  usually , quotes are literal , not manipulations of what people says . 
  fyi . 
  so i 'll ignore your first * quote * . 
  lies ? 
  idk * saying that is the generslitat of catalunya , saying thst its xenophobia ... actually , the only linguistic xenophobia id yours . 
  meanwhile we demand for our rights to be respected , in both catalan and spanish , when you do anything that 's on your hand , even if its thru lies , to stop it . 
  and again with fake quotes smh, 
  1 ) this was exactly what you were trying to do . 
  2 ) as i said , i dont agree with this app , but i dont go arround bitching about it with lies . 
  3 ) tripadvisor lets you get a ** full ** review . 
  yet , in spain , its a lot more clear whether you have s right to be attended on your language . 
  but it exists in catalonia too , even if some australopitecus like you do n't want it , so is simply giving tools to people to have more info about them . 
  if they want to have their rights respected , they will be sble to . 
  if they do n't care , they will move along . 
  guessed so , but not likely all of them are really keen on accepting refugees either ... 
  aimed * and yes , giving cititzens more information about comerces is its main feature . 
  i personally do n't use it , nor i 'm going to , but asking to be attended in catalan ( or spanish ) , is a ** right ** that any catalan has . 
  and no , the * friction * is being created by yall . 
  or does asking for your rights to be respected is creating unnecessary frictions ? 
  cuz if it is ... well , rip humanity . 
  it simply uses google maps data , an opensource database if someone does n't want their local on there , you can remove it . 
  and as an usual local guides ( g. maps cobtributor ) i can assure you its pretty easy . 
  you are required to know both languages in order to attend the public , yet , people is smart enough to diference between a foreign who may not be good at it yet and someone who simply refuses to ( i 've meet people that has lived here 40 years and refused it ) . 
  and i wo n't even comment on this `` and if you do n't like me '' since it has the ** same ** functionality than google maps , trip advisor , etc. 
  i 'm not trying to `` characterise you '' , i 'm simply pointing out your lies and hipocrisy . 
  and wtf ? 
  cultural protection ? 
  its simply giving tools to people to have ** its rights protected ** . 
  if you do n't want to underestand it feel free to , but do n't lie about this anymore please . 
  lol ? 
  i guess you are just a troll . 
  lol , i see your problem is with people asking for its rights then . 
  and yes ? 
  does it bother you to have public money spent on the church ? 
  and on the fascist foundation * fundaci\u00f3n francisco franco * ? 
  and on ave 's for 20 inhabitants villages ? 
  and ... 
  but you just whine about that ( adding as much lies as possible ) . 
  your problem are n't public funds , your problem is another one . 
   that organisation receives subsidies from the generalitat . 
  as said earlier , their incomes from that are ** minimal ** . 
  almost all the ngos recive subsizes , even the far-right anticatalan association * scc *  tripadvisor seeks to review businesses on their service ; this app is only concerned with catalan language proficienc this app gives a place for catalan speakers to review the bussines on all forms . 
  language is a big part of it , yet , buy shall i remember that catalan * codi de consum * grants the right to customers to be attended in both catalan and spanish ? 
  not giving this right to the customer , no matter which language is choosen , is ** ilegal ** , yet , the app 's feature simply aims at letting people have this right provided . 
   the codi de consum is not a legal requirement for operating your business : so long as you can speak one language to fulfil the legal requirements there is no obligation to learn the other . 
  you are a compulsive liar . 
  its the legislation that creates a legal mark on which companies have represented its rights and obligations towards the customer . 
  not quite sure . . [ here ] ( https://www.es.amnesty.org/en-que-estamos/noticias/noticia/articulo/10-anos-sin-investigar-adecuadamente-el-trato-dado-a-detenidos-por-tropas-espanolas-en-irak/ ) you have an article from amnesty international about tortures by spaniard soldiers in irak , and [ here ] ( http://www.publico.es/politica/espana-vivido-2004-mas-600.html ) +6600 tortures ( complaints , not all of them are presented by fear ) in 10 years . 
  and do n't get me wrong !, 
  hope this changes and those start being prosecuted as they should !, 
  wait ... migrants or refugees ? 
  come on guys , they are n't the same , its not that difficult !, 
  looks beautiful !, 
  although i think that some peeps created r/casualeurope for those random picture posts ( i 'm not sure though , so do n't take my word ) . 
  that 's just a lie . 
  it has some ( ** minimal ** ) subsides as most of ngos do in catalonia ( even the anticatalan farright * scc * recives subsides ) .
