  catalonia has a shitton of unemployment too !, 
  but its just dumb to say that a 17,8 % is n't much !, 
  i mean ... maybe it is n't much for kosovo , but ask in sweeden !, 
  leave your political drama outside salty boy . 
  catalonia has a hughe unemployment too , and i wish therw were as much jobs as needed for catalonia , spain , albania , kosovo ... 
  simply pointing out at ** how stupid ** it is to say that a ** 17,8 % of unemployment ** is not much . 
  if you wan na whine feel free to , but ** i did n't even mention catalonia . 
  ** whatever 's good for your propaganda !, 
  on what ? 
  lol if you think an 17.8 % of unemployment is nothing gl !, 
   spain 's impressive unemployment declines lol !, 
  impressive is having all that unemployment . 
  and especially now , when half of new contracts are due to summer holliday temporal workers !, 
  you linked a google amp link , not the real article, 
  with gaud\u00ed being as much of an icon for catalonia as he is ? 
  if someone bertrayed his biggest legacy he/she would n't end up happy, 
  well , catalonia has quite a few more than the rest of regions though ( leaving apart basque country on here ), 
   given as you are giving us the news from catalonia only , does catalonia have its own exclusive newspapers and tv channels etc and the like ? 
  yeah . 
  pretty much a few newspapers , such as ara , vilaweb , el nacional , el m\u00f3n , el punt avui , la directa , aldia , cataloniatoday , catalannewsagency , regi\u00f37 , diaridegirona , el peri\u00f2dic , la vanguardia , la jornada ... also some of them have an english version , but not much active sadly . 
  and same for tv channels , since you have 8tv , tv3 , 324 , ib3 , a. 
  ( will open soon ) , 3xl , esport3 ...  is it that things such as the 2 catalans climbing everest were reported lots on in catalonia but not elsewhere in spain ? 
  i 'm sure there was some other report about killian jornet , but not much ( taking out la vanguardia , el nacional and el periodico , catalan newspapers that have spanish editions ones too ) compared to catalonia , since he 's kind of an icon on here . 
  this said , though , the guardian dod give killian jornet 's climbs coverage too !, 
  after i made the post ), 
  like +130 years ago . 
  i dont remember the exact date . 
  its an expiatory themple ( antoni gaud\u00ed 's idea ) , it has to be built entirely by donations . 
  it shows `` native '' languages , not majoritary ones, 
  lol . 
  actually its suposed to be finished in about 10 years if it goes as planned, 
  hmm . . 
  did n't knew that !, 
  i simply said that this is n't a term that catalans uses , nothing else . 
  if you want to keep up your stupidity do it , but not here please . 
  racists are ( sadly ) everywhere , but this does n't give you the right to say that there 's an insult used on here which is not used . 
  also , ( not part of the article ) catalan governament passed a law earlier last year that did n't allow light/water/gas provider companies to cut the power to economically vulnerable people . 
  the law , though , is nowadays not applied because spanish constitutional court turned it down . 
  ** english translation ** : the woman died in a fire caused by candles because she had her power cut . 
  the catalan government sanctioned the company gas natural $ 500,000 following the death of a woman of 81 years reus , according to tv3 . 
  she died on november 14 , her light was cut bumy gas natural and thereforw illuminated her house with candles , one of which caused a fire at his home and killed her . 
  the government opened disciplinary proceedings against gas natural and described the events of ` very serious ' . 
  the secretary for business and competitiveness , joan aregio said there was no reason because the company had not notified the council social services as indicated by the law . 
  the death of the woman opened the debate on energy poverty and the responsibility of the suppliers and the administration in the case of people vulnerable suffering power cuts . 
  as someone that has lived its whole life in catalonia and who 's fathers are from andalusia ( so technically what some call a `` charnego '' ) , i have only heard spaniards use this term . 
  they call you lazy cuz of siesta being a tradition , not cuz of being poor, 
  again , a rant is n't an opinion . 
  want to give your opinion ? 
  you are extremelly welcome !, 
  want to just rant arround like if it was a necessity ? 
  well , good luck then , i will feel sorry for you . 
   do n't try to curtail my ability to express myself . 
  lol ? 
  you are the one ranting because there is `` too many posts about catalonia '' . 
  as said , if you do n't want to read them , ** do n't read them , just skip ** , but dont come rant . 
   there 's alot of them is n't there ? 
  not actually . 
  if there were uptades of all what happens , you would have posts every few hours . 
  i do n't see you whinning about trump , russia or brexit posts tho . 
   is there a problem with me giving my opinion ? 
  giving an opinion is n't equal to ranting . 
  opinions are more than welcome , rants arent . 
  if you do n't like posts about catalonia , or do n't want to be informed about it , simply skip them . 
  not everyone wants to ignore it . 
  no way . 
  actually , balearic islands and valencia are more likely to leave than galicia . 
  popular party won there on last elections in ** whole ** region but one town, 
  wow . . you are bitching on ** literally ** every post where `` catalonia '' is mentioned ... 
  well , it depends on your view ... of course , its not arabia saudi !, 
  but if the region was threated alright and wasnt used as a political instrument , half of catalans would n't be independentist . 
  as you can imagine , its something that ca n't really be expained : you must live it and extract your own ideas . 
  i dont `` hate '' spain , so nope . 
  then you simply are n't leftist lol . 
  its like saying `` im leftwinger and im against feminism '' . 
  and again , i 'll quote myself , smartpants :  i was generalizing  tend to  more often, 
   no i \u00b4 m not arguing that , they are not comparable situations your country has a rule of law governing self determination to be approved by all spaniards . 
  britain does not . 
  acrually you are wrong [ this ] ( https://www.infolibre.es/noticias/politica/2017/03/22/un_manifiesto_500_juristas_defiende_que_referendum_catalan_cabe_constitucion_62859_1012.html ) is one of lots of manifestos from catalan and spanish lawyers that say that a referendum in catalonia would be legal . 
  spanish constitutional court , its simply not independent at all . 
  and its not me saying it , its european venice comission on its latest report . 
   if we did this today we would not expect the eu or any other modern democracy to be waiting with open arms and alms . 
  we dont either . 
  catalonia is proeu on maybe a 90 % , and the rest would be proeu if the eu did more on refugee mattee and such . 
  but this does n't mean that catalans will renounce selfdetermination for the union , they will not . 
  you that like saying that things are n't comparable , you should remember that spanish constitution was voted on a moment where the alternative was fascism . 
  heck , from far right to comunists agreed on it !, 
   this was achieved through dialogue with the national governments not posturing and cock shouting in the international press . 
  i hope this is ignorance ... we havent dialogated ?!?!? 
  we have spent 7 years giving spain chances to do so , latest dialogue offer was this week , and it was denied by spanish president mr.rajoy in less than 24 hours . 
  the deny goes fron a referendum to a new financial system , from making catalan language official , to giving back to catalonia the historic intitutions that it still does n't have . 
  if you dont want to support selfdetermination you sre on your right , but please , do n't be as shameless to say we havent tried to negotiate, 
  not true . 
  according to polls , an 80 % of catalans want a referendum , so only pp voters ( a residual party here , that is the major one in spain ) would boycott it . 
  this referendum , has been actually planned by independentist and by non-indepenentist parties to assure a decent turn out . 
  also , the question of oue president , was because this week , wpanish governament started calling catalan governament as responsibles of a * coup d'\u00c9tat * , all of them at once . 
   if things are to change in spain all spaniards should have a say but catalonians do n't want this i guess you also support another independence referendum on ireland on where british , welsh and scotlands can vote too , right ? 
  because that 's what you are defending here ... and man . . wo n't even coment on the rest ... 
  scottland support in this sub , is as a vendetta for brexit , nothing else, 
  not if it hadnt already . 
  its nothing new at all ...
