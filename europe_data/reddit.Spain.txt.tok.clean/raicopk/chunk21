   if the police asks you to speak in spanish in spain , you have to . 
  erm ... nope . 
  catalonia 's estatut ** grants you the right for being attended in any of the official languages ** , so the police must switch to catalan , spanish or aranese as asked . 
  i was generalizing . 
  there 's people for all likes , but leftwing , ** tends ** to defend self determination morw often than right wings . 
  the quote was a one-time thing , not the idea . 
  just spend some time with the party 's history on polish parliment . 
  discriminating because of your sex is against them , yup . 
   it is without the approval of the central government as i already said , this does n't make it unilateral acording to the hague . 
   according to 5 countries in the eu kosovo is part of serbia so what the hague says does n't seem to sway them . 
  homosexuality is still discriminated in a pretty notable part of the eu . 
  does this mean that human rights are n't important then ? 
  because its the same argument you used ... 
  its discriminating women , so yes , ita a humsn rights violation . 
  enacting then would simply be a ** hughe * '' violation . 
  its not them being dumb , its them being a ** violation of human rights ** . 
  call things by its name . 
  according to the hague , on kosovo , unilaterally does n't exist when the other side does n't want to negotiate at all . 
  and btw , how is it `` not being carried like scotland one '' ? 
  this sub only supprts scotland independence , and because a vendetta for brexit . 
  but meh , not a surprise , its a right-winged sub afterall ... 
  i 'd recommend you to inform yourself first . 
  this question comes after a week of pp acusing the catalan governament of a coupe d'\u00c9tat , on a more than clear verbal tone increase . 
  also , on diplomatic relations , thosw hostile relations tend to be a preparation to make look the other one bad , and therefore , opening an small possibility to armed way ( from their part ) . 
  there are thousands of lawyers that presented a * querella * on spanish constitutional coutry defending that its not unconstitutional . 
  there 's a professional division , but constitutional court , is n't independent at all ( just read european venice comission 's 2017 report on it ) edit : i guess you do n't like people pointing out your lies ? 
  playing the victim ? 
  we are n't the ones that inhabilitated politics for a non official rerferendum like the one in south tyrol ( in 2014 too ) . 
  garc\u00eda is an adjective ? 
  a federal state with politicians that call women `` less smarter , weaker and should earn less '' ? 
  no , ty !, 
  cuz bad , nuts people must not be european , right ? 
  why do you repost this ? 
  not even 24hours have passed ... 
  us 's biggest chinatown ? 
  this is how the world works ... 
  stalker !, 
  it was about time !, 
  nor it wants to . 
  all it wants is a ballot box . 
  it was just an answer to that comment upside here . 
  depends on who you ask . 
  there are plenty of judges and lawyers that defend that its [ legal ] ( http://www.infolibre.es/noticias/politica/2017/03/22/un_manifiesto_500_juristas_defiende_que_referendum_catalan_cabe_constitucion_62859_1012.html ) ( and others say it is n't ) . 
  spanish constitutional court , though , is extremelly politized ( according to venice comission ) . 
  and even if we considered it `` illegal '' , what ? 
  spanish governament violates [ 23 articles ] ( https://www.google.es/searchurl/rr.html#app=com.huffingtonpost.android&amp;pingbase=https://www.google.es/&amp;url=http://m.huffingtonpost.es/2013/12/05/articulos-constitucion-no-se-cumplen_n_4384451.html ) of its constitution . 
  we would be ignoring it aiming at democracy meanwhile they ignore it for commodity . 
  also , catalan governament has supported a hughe foregin action in order to let international community know what happens here .

  and why not exactly ? 
  after half day of laughs they deleted the tweet btw, 
  2014 's participation process was n't neither announced as somthing validant nor was held by public institutions ( more preciselly anc and omnium ) . 
  it was simply aimed at showing the world a `` we want to vote '' image . 
  i dare you to find our former president artur mas saying that it was validant . 
  edit : there 's some people that doesnt stand seeing other views lol, 
  according to [ polls ] ( http://www.directe.cat/noticia/240194/el-periodico-coincideix-amb-la-vanguardia-mes-dun-70-a-favor-dun-referendum-per-lautodeter ) , arround a 70 % would vote , so you are wrong . 
  this refrrendum has been planned with non-independentist , democratic parties exactly for that . 
  edit : i see there 's some mad people arround ? 
  if you do n't like polls results its fine , but why downvote ? 
  not like spanish army has the rescoures to occupy a `` rebel catalonia '' according to the exmilitar leader that presented to 26j elections with podemos,

  the first picturw is part of a `` meetings room '' part of his office . 
  on left side duh, 
  catalan * his name is killian jornet and he has done plenty of [ races ] ( https://dades.naciodigital.cat/redaccio/arxius/imatges/200907/576_1248084150kilian.jpg ) with an * estelada * ( catalan independentist flag ) on his back , so doubt he feels spanish at all . 
  i do n't see any link . 
  and i know pretty well where it is , and its not part of the airport . 
  and ? 
  its still not a propiety of defense but a cession for that ministery . 
  its in * el prat de llobregat * ** municipal term ** , not the airport . 
  wtf you saying ? 
  the airport was priginally for catalonia 's aeroclub . 
  later , spanish defense occupied part of it , but already in the '20 they had left the terminal for iberia , the first comercial line . 
  spanish army has absolutely no propiety on el prat . 
  lol !, 
  we have had an everest-fan week !, 
  although to be fair , killian jornet is kind of an icon in catalonia , so all his `` top challenges '' get quite a bit coverage here, 
  catalonia : ** politics ** - our mhp * carles puigdemont * , vicepresident * oriol junqueras * and foreign affairs minister went to madrid to give a conference explaining the catalan referendum and lending our arm to madrid for last time to [ dialogate ] ( https://www.google.es/amp/www.elperiodico.com/es/amp/noticias/politica/texto-integro-conferencia-carles-puigdemont-madrid-por-referendum-6054269 ) before we stick to the so-called transition laws . 
  the conference was held on a building propiety of madrid 's city hall , which was ceded by its mayor , from podemos . 
  - popular party , and c 's , started a [ campaign ] ( https://www.google.es/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://pysnnoticias.com/no-quedarse-el-pp-se-inicia-la-campana-en-contra-de-la-conferencia-puigdemont/&amp;ved=0ahukewiim_cyr5luahxjtbqkhdvdbz8qfggomam&amp;usg=afqjcne6lugujnmlc2qb8fasi0epag5q9w&amp;sig2=av6j_imkweru_volcdibkq ) against the conference in madrid ( yes , a conference , nothing else ) . 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rdoplsi.jpg ) you have alicia sanchez camacho during that campain and her * marevillosa * grammar !, 
  - one day after puigdemont offering dialogue for a pacted rederendum , spain 's pm mariano rajoy , refused to negotiate , so catalan independentist parties and ngos urged our mhp to keep its plan going and present the referendum date so campaigns officially start . 
  - [ our mhp will organize tomorrow a summit ] ( http://m.ara.cat/politica/neus-munte-data-pregunta-referendum_0_1804019776.html ) with all proreferendum parties/ngos . 
  referendum ** date and question ** will be announced within two weeks maximum . 
  - former spanish mp , miguel \u00c1ngel rodr\u00edguez , [ compared ] ( http://www.elespanol.com/reportajes/entrevistas/20170526/218978265_0.html ) catalan independentists with `` someone trying to rape your daughter '' . 
  all normal !, 
  ** non politics ** - [ killian jornet ] ( http://m.ara.cat/esports/kilian-jornet-segon-ascens-everest_0_1804019773.html ) climbed everest twice this week without artificial oxygen ( those bottles i mean ! ), 
  - [ ferran latorre ] ( http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticies/video-el-moment-en-que-ferran-latorre-ha-coronat-leverest/ ) climbed everest , being the first catalan to climb all the +8000 m mountains . 
  - [ la jornada ] ( https://www.diarijornada.coop ) newspaper has been born , a leftist , pro ppcc , cooperative-shaped newspaper , which could ( or not ) change how main newspapers here work . 
  august in barcelona without an hotel/hostel reservation ? 
  if you get unlucky ... its one of the top 5 tourist destinations in europe . 
  anyways , for bcn , i would recommend to not miss * sagrada fam\u00edlia * , this antoni gaud\u00ed building is a must , even if you do n't enter inside . 
  the rest really depends on what you are into . 
  for example , if you like `` giving a shot to other cultures '' , i 'd recommend to go to a human towers festival if there 's any going on ( a pretty amazing tradition from catalonia ) , but as said , this depends on your interests . 
  yup , but they are n't part of munich .
