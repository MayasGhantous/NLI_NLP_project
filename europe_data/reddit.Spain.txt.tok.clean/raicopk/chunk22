  same happens for barcelona , but badalona ( although he even counted far cities like manresa ) , has nothing to do with bcn, 
  yup , but then why say cities in post ? 
  eurostat does n't get data for big cities on the statics `` packs '' for nuts regions, 
  yes . 
  it says that he defined urban areas limits ( apart from ile de france ) , that 's why i dont get why he uses regions map, 
  the first map shows provinces/regions , not cities, 
  ** for mods ** : posted it due to european countries in the coalition being responsible of what happened . 
  but since it took place in syria and not europe , let me know if it would be better to delete the post . 
   what defines a catalan ? 
  what defines an scotish ? 
  and a british ? 
  and ...  what about valencians ? 
  what about them ? 
  what about occitans ? 
  what about sardinians ? 
  i do n't get your point here ... 
  i have n't said they do n't have anything to say . 
  i said that they have ** the same to say ** than a french or a german . 
  you justified 13tv ( 8th biggest tv ) doing so on my post yesterday , and have fun , you were reported by it too . 
  anyways , not gon na waste more time on you . 
  please abstain from replying my posts from now on , ty . 
  by `` shit like this '' you mean saying that ** only catalans should vote on an indy referendum over catalonia ** ? 
  those evil catalans !, 
  how do they dare to vote about ** their ** future without letting other regions vote for them !, 
  if someone is annoyed by seeing that other wants to decide its ** own future ** , the first person has a problem . 
  want to expose your opinion on being for or against independence ? 
  you will be absolutely welcome !, 
  as i would welcome a french , a kurd or a chinese doing so . 
  but want to vote my future for me ? 
  then i honestly dgaf if you get annoyed . 
  just did , touch\u00e9 !, 
  but what spaniards underestand by `` taking a side '' on catalan argument is them voting too ( according to the ine , their polling organitzation ) , not just being for or against it . 
   i disagree on this because for many spanish people their idea of spain includes catalonia . 
  and british idea of the uk includes scotland ...  and catalan independence will impact them very directly and so would happen with southern frenchs . 
  i 'm sorry , but its like saying that whole europe should had voted brexit . 
  ballot boxes , worse than nukes !, 
   if you are not spanish/catalan i think it is better to refrain from having a strong opinion about this . 
  spaniards have as much to say on the topic than french , brits or americans . 
  if they want to say they are up or against independence , they will be welcome , but they have as much right to vote in the referendum as ukranians had to vote on brexit, 
  fascist ? 
  go hit a book lol . 
  its simply disgusting to speak with someone who is ** trying to justify people making fun of dead kids ** if you had any respect , to start by , you wouldnt be justifying people that makes fun of dead kids, 
  are you even reading what you writte ? 
  if there 's more variety , holding a 2 % of quota is really notable . 
  almost all the channels have a 0.5 % or lower ( way lower ) quota . 
  and convince anyone ? 
  im not trying to convince an australopitecus like you . . 
  i just shared a new on r/europe and you came to try and justify it . 
  make a post on r/barcelona or r/catalonia for a decent amount of replies, 
  ok , the 8th channel most seen in spain isnt relevant . 
  * facepalm * p.s. 
  there are a lot more of open channels , not counting paid ones . 
  its actually pretty relevant . 
  do you realize thst the top is holded by t5 with a 15 % ? 
  the second one , is a3 , with a ~ 12 % , and the third one , if iirc , is lower than a 9 % . 
  its not 2004 , there are n't just 20 channels but hundreds . 
  fake . 
  its quota is a 2,3 % , the same one than la 2 , neox or divinity . 
  they ( sadly ) have the same quota than * la 2 * , * neox * or * divinity * , so i doubt they have trouble finding people . 
  right !, 
  we paid whole baltic states governaments , jimmy carter and even harvard !, 
  you and your world lol, 
  just hit up datosmarcos and you will see . 
  btw , those eu valorations can be altered by a lot of things , from a referendum on catalonia to new elections due to pedro sanchez removing support to pp , or even the * moci\u00f3n de censura * prospering . 
   so usurping the legitimate powers of the government breaking the constitution and the estatut is n't a coup ? 
  then i guess that spanish governament [ performs various coups everu day ] ( http://m.huffingtonpost.es/2013/12/05/articulos-constitucion-no-se-cumplen_n_4384451.html ) , right ? 
  anyways , like i see you have an ideology line close to spanish libertas , i 'll stop wasting my time replying you . 
  yours sincerely , one between milions that will support the `` coup '', 
   year.the debt is n't above 100 % and the commision forecast also see it going down . 
  according to world bank , the debt was a 99,8 % in 2015 , and nowadays its a [ 99,40 % ] ( http://www.datosmacro.com/deuda/espana ) , lower than in 2015 due to gdp grow but higher on real terms . 
  and not true , even more , according to the governament , which emptied the popular-called * caja de pensiones * , has already said that they will [ create more public debt if they ca n't pay pensions ] ( http://www.elconfidencial.com/mercados/2017-01-10/deuda-publica-tesoro-pensiones-fondo-reserva-deficit_1314104/ ) and wtf ? 
  really ? 
  you have no shame ... 
  lol ... 
  i reject it too ( and i 'm independentist ) . 
  this means nothing though . 
  udi is only contemplated in case spain blocks the referendum by force , and even then , there would be a referenfum later to give ( or not ) legitimacy to the act . 
  this article is made from an * el pa\u00eds * document on which catalan governament already said that is ** fake **, 
  and ? 
  i have strong ties with the uk and you dont see me whinning on brexit-related posts, 
  of course they do !, 
  have n't tried it myself , but i was told they blocked it, 
  netflix originals are actually pretty diverse . 
  `` rita '' , for example , is european . 
  they are doing nice here . 
  yes , american trash tv but its the one that sells lol, 
  local channels dont have a 2,3 % share , the same one that * la 2 * , * neox * or * divinity * have . 
  good !, 
  detain and judge ** all corrupts ** !, 
  it was made when it was all going on though . 
  this is quite worse than lets say , joking some days later ( from my point of view , ofc ) . 
  there are lots of kinds of humor , i would n't like it even then but could at least kind of underestand it . 
  i said conservative to not say something else lol, 
  plus moment is pretty important ... its a lot different to joke years later than when its happening, 
  13tv is an state-wide channel , and pretty sure you do know that you have it ( even if you do n't watch it ) , and is [ as seen ] ( http://ecoteuve.eleconomista.es/audiencias/ ) as * la 2 * , * neox * , or * divinity * , which are known by everyone . 
  and as i said earlier , i would had shared the post too if it was a catalan tv channel the one that did this . 
  yet , if you wan na keep up lying feel free to . 
  ** p.s. 
  an spanish tv channel isnt equal to spain ** , but whatever, 
  it is n't the worse that this tv channel ( 13tv ) has said live , so doubt it .
