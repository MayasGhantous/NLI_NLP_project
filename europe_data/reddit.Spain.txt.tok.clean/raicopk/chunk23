  its a pretty conservative tv channel . 
  they are n't sports presenters , they are journalists that are often in political debates of this tv channel, 
  not an state but we do celebrate it in catalonia . 
  its not `` very big '' , but we have a yearly `` fira de santa ll\u00facia '' in barcelona which is quite popular, 
  i wondee how would a detailed map look ( nuts 2 divisions for example ), 
  not like your hands are clean when talking about kurds and other minorities either ... 
  kurdis case is extremelly different, 
  truth hurts, 
  shush atlantis !, 
  you dont exist !, 
  and the point ? 
  its also an slang word for d * ck , that 's probably why the name, 
   they 're a minority , most of their exports go to other parts of the country they 're part of today if polls are to be trusted , a 80 % of catalans want a referendum , and the majority of catalam exports nowadays go to the rest of europe , not spain ( since arround 2015 ), 
  a udi is ** only ** planned in case spain blocks the referendum by force . 
  how would it be radical then ? 
  it would be something you are forced to . 
  even after a udi , a referendum would be held, 
  do you realize that this is ** only ** planned in case spain blocks september referendum by the force ? 
  and even after an hipotetic udi , there would be a referendum . 
  what a definition you have of spam , wow . . 
  if you do n't want to know what happens in catalonia feel free to not read the articles , you are on your right , but those news he is posting are pretty important for both catalan anf spanish politics , and not everyone wants to ignore it , so do n't be a barrier for them . 
  amd exactly why is it `` propaganda '' ? 
  its simply him talking about today 's conference in madrid , last public offer of dialogue before catalonia goes its own way . 
  that 's an extremelly wide question . 
  in catalonia , only , you have important ngo that are fighting banks kicking people out of their banks , you have groups fighting the fascist legacy that franco left , groups fighting for independence ( and this september 's referendum ) , trade unions fighting to fix the unemployment , bad salaries , etc. 
  if you are 70 years old you will feel great there, 
  the catalan mp jordi turull ( one of the maximum responsibles of the ruling party ) said that this are fake news . 
  catalonia wont go for a udi unless a referendum is held, 
  the catalan mp jordi turull already said this is fake . 
  can we stop promoting fake news please ? 
  you are a lil late lol . 
  fc barcelona presented its adherition to the national pact for the referendum like 2 weeks ago, 
  fake [ here ] ( http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticies/el-pais-publica-un-text-que-afirma-que-es-lesborrany-la-llei-de-transitorietat/ ) you have jordi turull , one of the main mps on catalan governament saying that this `` filtration '' is not true, 
  radical ? 
  lmao, 
  so polish politicians that call women `` weaker , less smart and that should earn less '' arent a threat to the eu but a region ** asking for a ballot ** , on which its inhsbitants are extremelly proeu is a threat ? 
  how does that work ? 
  there will be three transition laws passed on catalan parliment ( which are already prepared ) , then a referendum will be helf in setember and in case the `` yes '' wins , they will proceed to a udi . 
  the candidates , efta ( and montenegro idk why ), 
  then its eu , not europe, 
  when you wan na bitch arround and have no arguments ...  encouraging violence ? 
  are you fucking retarded ? 
  torturating eta memberd as amnesty international proved isnt encouraging violence ? 
   catalans helped the terrorists , deal with it carod rovira had a talk with eta members and shortly after , thenterrorist group announced peace in catalonia . 
  but yeah , this was helping them . 
  smh . 
  if it was for people like you eta would still doing terrorist attacks . 
   they had their own terrorist organization yay !, 
  latest bitch !, 
  not only * terra lliure * had no supports at all nor anything to do with eta but it also disbanded in ** 1995 ** . 
  we need new leader then . 
  this should be good news !, 
  you tell us !, 
  negotiating peace with a terrorist group towards catalonia is a bad thing ? 
  i guess encouraging violence as spanish governament did with that group was better ? 
  never enough posts of girona :p, 
  hey !, 
  that 's my post !, 
  in case anyone is wondering , that 's part of a festival called [ temps de flors ] ( http://www.gironatempsdeflors.net/cat/inici.php ) that tries to * make the city explode with colours * during about a week , celebrating this week its 62th edition . 
  although this year 's edition was n't as good as last ones , i thought i 'd share some of the spots that were * flowered up * for the festival !, 
  germans you slacking, 
  hmm . . the ones on the village werent there when i visited !, 
  nice to see tho !, 
  and meanwhile spanish governament with mps that openly call catalans [ terrorists ] ( https://www.google.es/amp/m.publico.es/politica/partidos-catalanes-indignados-margallo-equiparar.html/amp ) . 
  some stuff gives votes and some does n't ... 
  lovely town !, 
  i have it as my [ wallpaper ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yhoagrb.jpg ) fun fact : the two flags on the bridge are a * senyera * ( catalan flag ) and an * estetada * ( catalan proindependence flag ), 
  its just a way to sell the message the graphic creator wanted to give . 
  not neutral, 
  they counted wars on the continent only . 
  basically cuz otherwise there 's no possible graphic . 
  also , note that its till 2000 only, 
  american troops dont equal to peace under ** any * circumstance, 
  apparently ... 
  yeah , the milions that still voted le pen were a mirage ... 
  none . 
  none at all on this century . 
  i 'd suggest you to hit up a book explaining spanish political/administrative divisions , you will be surprised !, 
  guess that whoever made all those * comunidades autonomas * maps on google was a brat that wanted to lie to us !, 
  and nice !, 
  love that logic !, 
  the night of museums is n't a bucharest-only thing , its actually dont by lots of countries !, 
  we talking about madrid now ? 
  and btw , why you change language now ? 
  thought we were chatting in english !, 
  if you learn to read you will see i have n't said castile didnt exist but that ** it does not anymore ** . 
  your own example points out at it not being castile but an union of old castile and leon crowns , something different . 
  you missing western russia and australia, 
  lol ? 
  their estatuto refers to the region as an union of leon and castile crowns , so as i said , castile does n't exist . 
  predisposiciones generales althought its mentioned a lot more , here you have the ** first ** point  1 . 
  castile and leon * castile does n't exist anymore, 
  australians are as european as germans , so chill !, 
  and they placed it on russia ( and ukraine ) because it breaks map less than it would moving it in middke of balkans, 
  despite being a comedy ( too ) , i 'd say * plats bruts * for catalonia . 
  and no , uks the office is way better !, 
  lol murica and its world, 
  go back to murica ... 
  dont get me wrong , i would n't either if it was n't for all the support shows ( for a referendum ) that we have already recived . 
  catalan governament has spent 4 years trying to make all governaments aware of our sutuation , and it has given its fruits .
