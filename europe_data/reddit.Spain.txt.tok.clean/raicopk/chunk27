  yeah , but i consider the others a lot more important, 
  how the heck are you suposed to respect diversity without respecting part of it . 
  are you fucking serious ? 
  google says unicorns exist too, 
  a lot more . 
  yet a country that doesnt respect lgtb doesnt respect diversity, 
  was just joking it is a nice iniciative , but if ukraine wanted to be lgtb friendly ( no offense intended ) , it could start by legislation besides symbolism, 
  they ran out of paint ? 
  lol ? 
  the governament is built by pdecat ( proeu ) , erc ( mainly proeu with some minoritary antieu sectors ) and cup ( absolutely antieu ) , with which i share my view of the eu . 
  a udi would end up with a catalonia out of the eu , but all eu , catalonia and even spain would be interested on being together on the union , so yes , after some stuff was settled , things would go straight up to rejoining . 
  would catalonia rejoin without a referendum ? 
  i highly doubt it . 
  ( and yes , tje yes would win , not saying that ), 
  sorry , im sooo tired of arguing with you from other threads . 
  you and rainymeadow are a waste of time to argue with, 
  spain would be the first one interested on it actually lol , due to mediterranean corridor . 
  a big part of its economy ( valencia , murcia , andalucia ... ) needs cooperation with catalonia . 
  btw , im not proeu , so idc about it !, 
  erm ... you better ask that !, 
  cuz if it was for me eu can go eff itself !, 
  yup , hated it pretty much lol . 
  i do enjoy slide 's hughe customitzation tho, 
  slide , but was aimed at saying that it was posted literally 1min before yours lol, 
  just leave it . . smh, 
  i dont like ? 
  it has been proved that sugar is ** more adictive than cocaine **, 
  there 's something i dont get about those maps . . why are there ** so many ** languages missing ? 
  seen the other post my apologizes !, 
  other subreddit, 
  touch\u00e9 then !, 
  not really ... aragon crown ( i guess thats what you mean ) didnt have those borders , and this one , was divided into different sovereign regions ( institutionally speaking ) . 
  anyways , this map is satire , they just stuck with thw most known names of the region i 'd say, 
  you have already been shown how a `` dna map '' would look alike . 
  anyways , the map legend divides it into imaginary culture groups, 
  maybe im wrong and i seen it in another sub ( def not r/arabs ) , but i can assure you i saw it !, 
  i freaked out seeing catalonia divided !, 
  wasnt this posted s couple days ago already ? 
  give aragon back to spain and i 'll suport occitan-basque-catalan region !, 
  the heck you got those culture groups from ? 
  hogar social madrid , its the name of the neonazi group, 
  maybe because of the same reason this madrid neonazi group [ ca n't ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ynkgq7p.jpg ) even draw it ? 
  no , the referendum is gon na be hold this september ( no date yet , prob later this month ) , that 's the campaign that a ngo started, 
  late for ? 
  yes lol, 
  good to know washington isnt arround !, 
  lol !, 
  * s\u00ed * means * yes * , but maybe its made of silicon !, 
  lol . 
  whatever you say dear liar , whatever you say . 
  have fun in m\u00e1laga !, 
  wow . . you seriously got some lying problems . 
   making threats now , where they heck do you see a threat ? 
  do you underestand english ? 
   you sound like some dictators around the world woah !, 
  your general knowledge is mindblowing !, 
  you should go to * atrapa un mili\u00f3n * !, 
  * waves sarcasm flag *  how long until you delete this comment like you did with your previous one ? 
  its not deleted , its still up there . 
  i even edited it awhile ago to complete it  have fun pathologic liar !, 
  if you spread lies saying that our parties promote hate towards spain you can go fuck yourself , you have no shame at all . 
  keep your dirty lies for yourself , if you really lived in catalonia you would know that what you said it not true at all . 
  dont belive what that troll said btw , its a hughe lie , but well ... 
  nothing new for us sadly, 
  of course !, 
  well , personally i 'd say because i havent been called ku klix klan member by a member of pp because of wanting a referendum , but this apart , bescially because pp defines itself ( more or less ) as they are , meanwhile c 's tries to seem what they are n't . 
  as i said , they are the darkest side of spanish politics . 
  on my point of view they are the spanish copy of libertas . 
  or they are since they presented in european elections with them , somethibg that changed their politics hughely . 
  in catalonia , they initialy defended aborting for example meanwhile nowadays they wont even think about it . 
  and that 's leavig behind them supporting sexists like de az\u00faa , being foundeds by sexists and homophobics like arcadi espada . 
  its kinda complicated to explain lol . 
  you are a lying dipshit . 
  how can you have no shame to lie that way ? 
  but i may thank idiots like you for convincing people to be independentist ( yall did it for me awhile ago ) . 
  if there 's a udi first it will be because spain has bloked the referendum ( an 80 % of catalans want it ) by force . 
  if they do this , people that would now vote no would mostly switch to the yes ( due to spain 's act ) , so it would be very unlikely . 
  hey !, 
  meanwhile they dont have to think why their media allways says the same no mstter its ideology . . let them be !, 
  just far ... 
  flemish media is saying the same than catalan one , but meh ... the * meseta * is the * meseta *, 
  on my point of view ? 
  yup , waaaay worse, 
  it is ( and love that pdecat isnt !, 
  ) , but followed by them , and not by such an importsnt distance . 
  but anyways , erc doesnt support maduro either, 
  i honestly doubt spain will even consider using force , but as i said earlier , it would be really unresponsible for our governsment to prepare for independencw without takong all scenarios into account . 
  blocked ? 
  doubt it . 
  boycotted ? 
  yes , by pp and c 's ( and its circles ) , here 's where psc and podem parties in catalonia enter : they defend the no but thru a referendum , and therefore , if we get them to participate ( podem has shown itself close to it , not psc tho ) it will give a great legitimacy in the view of international community . 
  anyways , we will see !, 
  catalonia doesnt want independence for sovereignity , they ( i dont include myself here ) are proeu as a whole . 
  almost no one is antieu , and antieus ( me ) dont care about sovereignity either but feel the eu doesnt do enough to defend human rights . 
  so imo tje '' divided we are weaker '' thing doesnt have a point on catalonia . 
  aaaanyways . . its mainly ( would be long to explain in detail ) because people not beliving on spain , not belving it as neither democratic , fair nor ( even ) safe for their culture/language . 
  if we go back to 2011 , where independentism started being `` something serious '' after spain 's constitutiona court throw back catalan estatut after catalan aproved it in a referendum , there was not an indeendentist majority but a majority that wanted a referendum to decide whether to stay on spain , try to get an special status inside spain ( as basque country or navarra have ) or simply leave the country . 
  madrid 's answer was simple and plain : no . 
  no to any change . 
  this was a point of no return for lots of people , and distance between both sides got even worse , till the point on which we have had mps kicked out of their seats for holding a ** non-vinculant referendum ** .
