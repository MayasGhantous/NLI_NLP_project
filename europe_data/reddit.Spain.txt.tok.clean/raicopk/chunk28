  can do a list with `` usual reasons '' that catalan independentists feel if you want to . 
  just didnt want to writte ( and explain ) an spam comment lol, 
  you can keep castille part of catalonia , ty !, 
  and dont touch mainland catalonia !, 
  grrr !, 
  well , i consider c 's the darkest side of politics , so i dont agree on it , but yes , there 's a lot of people in c 's better than jordi ca\u00f1as, 
  man , idk how is spanish cinema so shitty . . with this imagination you would make avatar look like meh !, 
  we cant , if we could know rhe future things would be really different !, 
  but we have had mps kicked from their seats for holding votes and a lot of other dirty tactics , so to be honest , force isnt the only thing we havent seen . 
  when we look at it , we slready describe it as a udi with a posterior referendum , so i honestly doubt we would give uo on second part . 
  but hey !, 
  we will see . 
  we both agree on that a referendum is the right way to sort it out . 
  edit : since i see some people downvoted you , i 'll say i wasnt one of them . 
  the norm ? 
  i can assure you ( me included ) that not even independentists would be willing to accept a udi only . 
  there are scenarios planned for all cases , from spain willing to negotiate to spain using the force . 
  it would be really irresponsible otherwise for a governament to plan a way to independence without taking into account all possible scenarios . 
  and idk if yall have an example arround there , but populism has nothing to do at all with catalonia 's separatism , actually , this is a movement lead by society , which has just turned into politics for its final stages ( because as you can imagine , society wouldnt be able to decide anything peacefully without politics ) . 
  we have had politics kicked out of their seats for holding a non-binding referendum , but when we say extreme , we mean if they use the force in ** referendum day ** , forcing people to not be able to . 
  he 's a troll , just see his posts history . 
  will come out and bitch at anything catalonia-related . 
  meh , will still be way nicer than jordi ca\u00f1as . 
  this one is really a douchebag with zero respect for anyone, 
  you said venezuela !, 
  lets mention podemos !, 
  lol , this was just a minor proindependentist party which got its support . 
  main independentist parties are against maduro . 
  edit : for people downvoting : pdecat , made a press conference straight after this new came out on which they showed their refusal to maduro, 
  udi is just planned in case spain prevents the referendum by force , and even then , there would be a referendum after the udi to legitimate the decision . 
  its not something that we want to do ( we just want a democratic referendum ) but that we plan `` just in case '' . 
  epp name does the same than fn , and not only by name , they define themselves as it too . 
  its marketing . 
  yet , i dont find normal to whine about fn on this but not epp either ( and dont get me wrong , im against both parties ), 
  ** centre ** right ? 
  please , dont make me lose the smsll faith i have on the eu . 
  please !, 
  and idk about there , but socialists dont do it either on spain , so you would have to go for trully leftist parties . 
  recent ? 
  [ here 's ] ( https://twitter.com/astroehlein/status/767295841409372160 ) a tweet from an hungarian european parliment mp 1 year ago that tslks by itself, 
  yeah , the epp sure has worker defense as its pilar core too !, 
  lol ? 
  you literally know a shit of history i 'll stop wasting my time with you , cya . 
  you are just dumb . 
  i was n't talking about politics , i was talking about history , yet , you simply trying to avoid being pointed out at your ignorance as you have already been . 
  the point is you talking about spain and catalonia from ignorance . 
  but well , not the first one from ` merica with this knowledge, 
  have i even mentioned this ? 
  lmao . 
  american you had to be, 
  lol ? 
  becoming one country can work with protecting languages and cultures . 
  almost no one would support it if it required to renounce to that . 
  oh gosh . . how many languages do you know ? 
  because you do n't even underestand english ... 
  when is ** not ** equal to where . 
  spain did have a fascism regime , after a civil war ( 1936-1939 ) , which ended in 1978 . 
  yet , catalonia was during war and post war , antifascist , till a point , on which our president was executed , the only democratically elected ( republican ) president executed in europe . 
  learn history before whinning . 
  or grammar ... or both . 
  the us starting a war ? 
  no way !, 
  maybe r/askeurope or r/hungary would help you better . 
  idk much about it so cant really help, 
  do you even know when fascism ideology was born ? 
  ofc you dont . 
  fascism ? 
  woah !, 
  man , you sure know much about catalonia !, 
  look how much fascist we are that spain is the only europeam country that ever executed a democratically-elected president , our president llu\u00eds companys . 
  ik history isnt your point in ` merica , but at least hit up the wiki !, 
  you can try , but unless you opt for a procomunism coup ... 
  number one on what ? 
  military coups ? 
  you can keep tje first spot on that !, 
  oh , go organize some military coup and shush, 
  not true . 
  this happens when american ** imperialism ** is mentioned , something extremelly different . 
  and in this case , its more than justified, 
  lol ... dreaming is free man, 
  wtf are you saying ? 
  it doesnt matter if mainstreet people uses it or not . 
  if you let nuns use those clothings but not muslisms you are being racist . 
  plain and simple . 
  or well , let me be more precise : islamophobic, 
   banning muslim women from wearing the veil is n't `` racist '' . 
  its not if you ban christians from wearibg the same appeals . 
  yet , i dont think she pretends to ban [ this ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=monja&amp;client=ms-android-samsung&amp;prmd=ivmn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewio0jo8ymttahucvbokhruncgkq_auicsgb#imgrc=iibvlmdrjrokvm: ) . 
  for tourism ? 
  are they active too ? 
  because that 's investing into catholicism ... 
  most ? 
  so it pays for some ? 
  why not do the same for other religions then ? 
  im personally up for states not investing into religions , but when i say this , i mean all of them , not just `` foreigin '' ones . 
  let me doubt on that . 
  anyways , the article says what it says . 
  can you answer me something ? 
  does your state spend any peny into cristian curches mantainance ? 
  did you even read it ?
