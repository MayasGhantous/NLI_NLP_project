  smh, 
  dont forget the plural !, 
  catalonia and basque country have their owns, 
  police ** s **, 
  nice !, 
  then we can move * ciudadanos * party over there and do a '' * charlie , we have a problem * '' thing !, 
  can you stop editorializing titles please ? 
  dont forget that in soviet america votes dominate you, 
  not so sure simce im not much into history of that period , but here goes a map of indoeuropean catalan wikipedia page ( ot repeats in spanish one at least ) [ link ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gee6dyo.jpg ) i do know , though , that there have been aqueology researches arround the pyrenees, 
  hmm ... 
  if le pen doesnt win and yall give us an special status ( dont worry !, 
  just means our own governament capable of deciding our futures , including educational language ) i 'm up for it !, 
  idk about the basque country , but in french catalonia , there is a quite high number of kids that goes to * escoles bressol * where they are shown catalan too . 
  not to mention the movement * sem catalunya nord * that has originated there since the new macroregion name ( they wanted it to be named occitane-pays catalan ) , as far as i know , almost all townhalls were up for it . 
  * facepalm *, 
  its a hawt language !, 
  and it has nothing to do ^ with ^ being ^ similar ^ to ^ catalan, 
  catalonia and aragon nowadays have as much in common as with the palatinate also , if there were a federal history-based provincies , catalonia would prob have french catalonia back as well as euskhalerria french basque country . 
  i thought they arrived to catalonia and parts of valencia ? 
  im not talking about you , i was talking aboit the article . 
  anyways dear troll , take care !, 
  hi there troll !, 
  basque and catalan police are independent police to spanish police , so they are n't part of the `` spanish police '' . 
  yeah !, 
  with an small diferenve !, 
  texan rangers , arent excluded from state cooperation by the governament as it happens with spaniard regional police . 
  even for citco . 
  spanish police and basque/catalan one are asolutely different . 
  anyways , you should get some humor sense , it was just a joke, 
  this was before , nowadays its simply a plain `` no regional police '' excuse . 
  and lmao with downvotes !, 
  some ppcs voters are arround !, 
  fail !, 
  1 ) i was just joking arround 2 ) the newspaper ( not you ) did screw it a lil bit on saying spanish police . 
  not only because they arent but because they are often left out from ~ ~ international ~ ~ european police coordination ( [ as well as basque police ] ( https://www.google.es/amp/amp.europapress.es/nacional/noticia-rajoy-abre-reforzar-papel-ertzaintza-cooperacion-policial-europea-20170405100224.html ) ) for being regional . 
  there were lots of volunteers from other countries that helped all along the war, 
  really ? 
  so i guess italian one was n't bad ? 
  here we `` celebrate '' 365 days a year the liberation day electing a fascist-founded party and having thousands of streets as an homenage for spanish fascists !, 
  fascist spain didnt persecute jews either . 
  that doesnt revert the rest of their atrocities . 
  beautiful country , with a green ~ ~ pm ~ ~ president ( yay !, 
  ) , a pretty flag , and historically with a dynasty that caused a war here !, 
  ( yes , ik that 's not the war ** s ** you thinkng about ) trouble guys ... oh , also love their flag !, 
  catalonia * and done by mossos , so not even spanish-wide police either ( as ertzaintza isnt ) edit : since some people dont get jokes , here goes a tip : #jokealert, 
  did you take your meds today ? 
  legal on the autonomus conumity since its not a competency . 
  hence why bull fighting ban was throwed back . 
  yet , olot was the first city to ban it on its municipal territory , followed by a lot of others such as igualada , my hometown . 
  the one that is being banned all over the territory ? 
  try again , 
  and same for spain . 
  there 's a lot of people that does * comunion * because of their parents but that define themselves as atheists, 
  well . . basically that macron will have won, 
  only russia does this !, 
  ask hillary !, 
  no lol, 
  you asked them ? 
  and sheez , go buy some humor sense, 
  now i like georgia a bit more !, 
   if your `` religion '' requires animal torture well then fuck off well , to be fair we have spain torturing animals for fun, 
  its not a tyranny if people wears it against its own will . 
  it is if they do want to wear it . 
  i dont see us european banning other similar clothings from christianism ... 
   the moment spain would recognise catalonian independence is the moment catalonia would leave the eu , automatically woah !, 
  you just literally repeated what i said !, 
  i dont agree on what he said , but if catalonia leaves the eu ( good for me :p ) , it will even be recognized by spain first . 
  eu ca n't kick a region from an state member , so therefore , the recognizment would have to be prior . 
  also , there are other alternatives such as efta which could be easier than eu edit : why you not using spanish flair ? 
  i 'm selling some humor sense !, 
  spaniards prob . 
  brits know givraltarians want to sray on their country , so its not bad for them, 
  a wordpress site as source ? 
  its gibraltar !, 
  recent ? 
  really ? 
  we are talking about a referendum on which 70-80 % of people would vote ( all polls agree on that ) . 
  that 's not a low turnout by any means . 
  it dissoluted in 1995 . 
  independentism back then and now has nothing to do with eachother . 
  actual one , really started in 2011 , and it has been represented by peaceful demonstrations , campaigns and ( posterior ) politics . 
  edit : actually , acordikg to basque politics , catalonia is an example to definitively leave the violent way . 
  lol . 
  you and your world, 
  ok , i see you are a troll lol, 
  do you know anything about catalan independentism ? 
  there hasnt been a single cristak broken , its not like in corsega or basque country . 
  and really ? 
  taxes ? 
  if taxes were a reason , catalonia wouldnt want to be part of the eu , since its a contributor region . 
  by berlin *, 
  dont get me wrong , its nothing about culture or language . 
  catalonia has an strong europeism . 
  its simply about * with who * ( visions do differ , its just part of the population ) . 
  spain 's vision , for some catlans , is anything but positive . 
  if there was a referendum in catalonia tomorrow , i would vote yes with no doubt , yet , just one day later i 'd be willing to merge into italy ( just an example ) , so its nothing about sovereignity nor culture . 
  3 years ago , something like that would had worked , not nowadays though . 
  not only because you would get not much support for it in spain ( there would be prob more support for getting rid of autonomies ) but because there 's also , part of catalonia ( i include myself here ) , who simply doesnt see themselves inside an spanish state anymore . 
  but yeah , the referendum is probably going to be close as you said, 
  if it was only her ... not like spain 's ** education ** minister is that far ... actually i 'd say he 's worse .
