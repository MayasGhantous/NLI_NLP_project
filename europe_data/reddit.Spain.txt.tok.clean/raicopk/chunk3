  like a 90 % is run by donations and its members quotes . 
  and i cam tell you , i was a member of it a couple of years ago . 
  now though , if you wan na keep lying go for it . 
  i 'll take that as an `` i 'm not from ukraine '' :p, 
  got ta agree with u/neils _ fs but you have more recent [ examples ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/10/06/inenglish/1475762366_981489.html ) !, 
  this was spain lol . 
  uk 's royal navy was on its waters, 
  its clearly not . 
  it has been financied and developed by a totally different organitzation , an ngo , which you are pretty aware of . 
  you should add that it works like tripadvisor , to give more info , 
  it was not . 
  was funded by an independent ngo, 
  it was made by an ngo called * plataforma per la llengua * , which is aimed at promoting catalan language on catalan-speaking areas . 
  it has nothing to do with the governament . 
  here a preview of why and by who was this app made : [ plataforma per la llengua ] ( https://www.plataforma-llengua.cat/ ) , an ngo aimed at promoting catalan language on its speaking zones , created this app as an answer to tripadvisor not allowing reviews on catalan , since catalanspeakers did n't have a place for so . 
  also , note that catalan consume code ( * codi de consum * ) , requires ** any ** commerce with activity on catalonia to be able to attend the customer in both catalan and spanish, 
  1 ) this app was created as an answer to tripadvisor , when it refused to accept any reviews in catalan ( they delete them ) . 
  2 ) although i do n't use the app ( nor going to ) , acording to catalan * codi de consum * , any customer has the ** right ** to be attended in either catalan or spanish as he/she wishes , so therefore , someone who does n't do this is actually breaking the law ( and i repeat that i 'm not gon na use the app fyi ) . 
  3 ) i personally see it more aimed at giving people more information , as for example google maps tells you ifyou can use nfc on locals . 
  its not , the poster is simply trying to spread lies .

  catalan code of consume ** requires ** any company to be able to attend customers on ** both ** catalan and spanish languages, 
  its not lol , the poster is just quite anticatalonia .

  really ? 
  not only is something that has done an independent organitzation ( * plataforma per la llengua * ) , but its simply aimed at making a * catalan-language tripadvisor * since this website does n't allow this language on its reviews ( they delete them ) . 
  catalan * codi de consum * , requires ** any ** company to be able to give its service to the cunsomer in both catalan and spanish . 
  edit : corrected a couple typos !, 
  lol !, 
  [ not enough ? 
  ] ( http://www.tarragonaturisme.cat/sites/default/files/styles/full_image_with_copyright/public/placa-de-toros-bianual-de-castellers.jpg?itok=ywtifs41 ) and yes !, 
  that 's our superbowl !, 
  lol . 
  i did n't even mention catalonia . 
  and actually , [ used it a few times ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/60a2cs/montserrat_anoia_catalonia/ ) with no problem at all . 
  heck , we even have an * estelada * as flair on here !, 
  not even a * senyera * on r/ask europe though . 
  even with them having somaliland ... 
  wts humor sense message me !, 
  and the downvotes ? 
  this may look like a train , idk , but it is a tram ( even the company is called like that ) . 
  fact : antoni gaud\u00ed died ( 3 days later ) after being stuck by a barcelona tram too, 
  that 's karma bitches, 
  gosh , say ** visca ** instead please !, 
  btw , most of catalan separatists ( me included ) have been forced to this ideology !, 
  not like we would n't prefer to be at home and be done with the drama !, 
  really ? 
  i guesa amnesty international denouncing +6600 tortures and policial abuses in 10 years is n't against human rights ? 
  i guess that girl that is on jail for tweeting jokes about carrero blanco had its human rights respecteds ? 
  i guess that raper that went to jail for ** singing against the crown ** had its human rights respected ? 
  and so on ... spain 's ** governament ** is nowadays a shithole , and pardon the expression . 
  you are refering to un letter for desconolitzation ( idr rhe exact name ) , two different things . 
  self determination right ia backed by [ international convenant of civill and political rights ] ( http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx ) , 1966 . 
  as i said , two different things . 
  does that include alghero and balearics ? 
  if so i 'm in !, 
  yall geemans can keep your towels on majorca !, 
  tell that to your camarades . 
  the crazy rant of zapatero and aznar gets more newspaper space than . .

   like vatalonian nationalists on steroids idk how i should take that ... - . -, 
  they have some really keen neighbours that even offered to pay for border controls on one of their territories ( and kinda on other easter ones ) . 
  * waves sarcasm flag *, 
  read my other comments on this , not gon na explain it again . 
  as i said , go back to your mational front cave please . 
  its exactly the practice he used . 
  he refered as groups of peoples by a religion name without judging by that religion as i already explained . 
  otherwise , i would had used the islamophoby term, 
  yup , itsislamophobia instead , but he did n't mean it as the religion but for a * group of people * as its usually generalized as , hence why i said racism . 
  there are muslisms who are as european as the first homo sapiens of the continent , but he just refered to migrant ones . 
  why ? 
  cuz of that generalitzation . 
  so you are a racist idiot only ? 
  could had say it earlier !, 
  would n't had wasted my time !, 
  now go back to your national front cave, 
  as i said earlier , that 's not true . 
  not everywhere at least . 
  there have actually been studies where if there 's more diversity , results tend to be slightly better . 
  that 's a valid reason ? 
  how would it desestabilize ? 
  especially in europe , a land that has had migration waves nonstop . 
  internals , externals ... 
  hoe much time did it took you to learn your language properly ? 
  ( if you speak it properly ) 10 years ? 
  i 'm sure there are lots of things about it that you do n't know yet . 
  but yet , you want migrants to learn it in 1 year ? 
  ( example date ) honestly i hope you have n't thought much about it , vuz otherwise is quite rude . 
  and yes , you said that the eu could be less selfcentred too , but that doea n't take the fact of you saying what you said about migrants . 
  again , there 's np valid reason for it . 
  doubt it english has become the global language kinda . 
  and most ( if not all , idk ) of european countries show english on schools , meanwhile german is n't that common, 
  there 's only mirandese in portugal , isnt it ? 
  there 's only mirandese in portugal , isnt it ? 
  that 's not true . 
  not everywhere at least . 
  migrants here learn both spanish and catalan .
