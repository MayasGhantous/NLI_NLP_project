   you seem to have the same rights any other spaniards has . 
  exactly !, 
  in a country without separation of powers ( comisse venice said ) that doesnt even let its regime be investigated ( osce said ) . 
  idk if you consider starting political trials for holding a vote democratic , but i clearly dont . 
  they do have tibet ( and hong kong ) , yet they supported it . 
  know why ? 
  thanks to cup and euia political parties , which may make them see catalonia as a possible `` friend '' since they are closer on some aspects . 
  its a dumb move , i agree , but that 's up to them, 
  he did , after spanish presures . 
  this , though , denotew the willignes to negotiate for his part once the moment comes . 
  especially for france , that as well as spain and catalonia needs the mediterranean corridor for its a conomic devolopement . 
  and ? 
  i want too !, 
  not true . 
  not only because moody 's ( amd i hate to quote an speculatist company ) said that using the force on catalonia could end up with hughe financal problems for spain , but bcause it would then be an international problem and not an spanish one . 
  this was before or after spain accused jimmy carter foundation and harvard of being bribed ? 
  there 's one difference between catslan and spanish diplomscy : spain ask for favours ( acording to maragallo , not me ) meanwhile catalonia ( as carter said ) just explains its situation . 
  [ this ] ( https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/hearing/subcommittee-hearing-u-s-policy-toward-national-self-determination-movements/ ) is the full conference transcript . 
  there was an abstract pdf , can search it later if you want . 
  1 ) spain 's consittutional court , said this year that catalan independence was a problem of political willignes , not legality . 
  2 ) referendum ( if it goed as cataloniq 's governament plans , of course ) wont be under spanish law but catalan one . 
  cataloniq 's governament has prepared three `` transition laws '' that would create a new legality on which the referendum would be legal . 
  if those laws are approved , that would be a hit on spanish-catalan-european politics , which would force international community to step in , either in favour of spain or in favour of a referendum as a neutral term . 
  and idk what you think , but a `` lets vote '' is easier to sell than a `` no . 
  nom '' . 
  note that an udi is only plsnned in case spain uses the force , not under any other circumstance . 
  they do know thst catalonia would at least be partialy recognized ( kosovo alike ) , it wouldnt be like south ossieta . 
  catalonia 's goveenament , during the last years , has been prettt active on international community trying to make our problem known for this time . 
  this , has given its fruits , even china 's communist party signed s motion this year on which they supported a referendum ( do n't ask me why . 
  i dont get why they did it with hong kong 's case but they did ) . 
  of couse , it would be something slow and low-stability movement , but catalonia 's governament has done nice here . 
  for example , all multinational expsnsions done the last years , such as amazon or zurich , have had personal contact with the pm , who explsinef them the situations , so they are mainly aware . 
  but yes , i 'm pretty sure that they will go foward no matter what spain says . 
  and udi , in catalonia , is allways planned with a posterior referendum to give it legitimacy . 
  a udi is simply planned in case spain uses the force . 
  we will do a referendum anyways . 
  a udi , would simply be to force international community to step in and support a referendum as a `` win-win '' . . this said , though , our transition laws , will work as that really . 
  btw , the udi scenario was planned by puigdemont ** only ** if spain uses the force , nothing else . 
   the us , the uk , france and china would n't agree unless spain does . 
  lol ? 
  the us 's foreign affairs house was really critic with spain . 
  the uk is pissed at gibraltar claims . 
  fillon and melenchor have both given support for a referendum this month . 
  only le pen is against . 
  china communist party has literally signed a motion of support for catalonia this year , in * partido del trabajo * mexico 's xxith communist meeting . 
  a motion that was started by cup and euia parties, 
  with a dui ? 
  it wouldnt be an spanish matter anymore but an international one . 
  only the hague would be able to speak, 
  its not an option . 
  neither for spaniards , who do n't want to ( not willing to negotiate anything at all ) nor catalans , who have way more thsn enough negative views of the country . 
  it would be a hit ( for both catalonia and spain ) , but its a matter of preferences : do you prefer stability or democracy ? 
  i 'll go for the second, 
  it all depends on if you are recognized , semi-recognized or not recognized at all, 
  i 'm pretty sure it was more than clear , but advise taken !, 
  comment edited !, 
  #serbian alarm edit : since some did n't get it , i 'll now wave a sarcasm sign !, 
  serbia ? 
  idts, 
  did you even listen the interview for what this statement this refers to ? 
  we will simply take it, 
  you could check before posting . 
  this was already posted like 1 hour ago . 
  pfft !, 
  it could for me !, 
  also a die linke or fillon/melenchor win on france !, 
  then you better vidit it in 2026 when its finished !, 
  every single day , 24 hours a day , 7 days a week till we are successful with it . 
  do n't worry though , once we are successful , you wo n't hear it anymore !, 
  anyways , we ( idk over there ) have a saying thd says `` you do n't ask for rights , you take them '' , so if it was for me you would n't hear anything but a one-time unilateral referendum . 
  in europe ? 
  how many countries are there on which cititzens only speak english ? 
  nah , we simply ask for ** one ** thing . 
  nothing else, 
  not even europeans can lol, 
  you labeling us states would be more likely if they answered a l\u00e4nders map, 
  english : today , giant `` yes '' posters have appeared in several different locations in catalonia . 
  no organization has claimed responsibility for the campaign , which has become viral on social networks . 
  the initiative concerns the referendum convened by the catalan government in september . 
  many users have shared pictures of their populations `` yes '' . 
  the label accompanying the initiative is #uns\u00edgegant . 
  girona , vic , olot , tarragona , camprodon , granollers and lleida are some municipalities that have shown `` yes '' . 
  here are some pictures . 
  still the same . 
  i 'd probably say xavier albiol for catalonia , but yet , he keeps getting votes , so therw has to be people who doesnt see him that way . 
  lol , this simply depends on your ideology, 
  maybe geography and history have something to do with it ? 
  sanders is far left ? 
  ok , i just lost all faith on humanity !, 
  spain has an imperialism complex . 
  they want to be an empire , getting back sll its territoried and st the same time not letting them go away no matter if those territories want so . 
  wait . . dos thst treaty say spain can get cosovereignity ? 
  ikr lol . 
  oliven\u00e7a hasnt had a referendum while gibrsltar has . 
  a 98 % said they wanted to be brittish !, 
   spain never even said anything about gibraltar they did . 
  even margallo , spain 's foreign minister , said `` spanish flag will wave in gibraltar , and a lot before some think '' . 
  from this , to placing a giant spanish flag over gibraltar 's rock , something ilegal btw . 
  cuz portuguese arent stupid lol, 
  military polices , which are army-connected , such as * koninklijke marechaussee * over there , do have further functions than civil police duties .
