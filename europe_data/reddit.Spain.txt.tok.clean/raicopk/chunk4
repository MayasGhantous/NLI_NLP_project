  and why not allow migration ? 
  i do n't see a single valid argument to not do so . 
  well ... to be honest spain would n't have a chamce imposibg against a country like the uk . 
  both powers ( both military and economic ) are kinda different . 
  anyways , the prpblem is not politicians wanting it , the problem is the drama that declarations like the ones that maragallo did ( the * pondremos la bandera , y mucho antes de lo que algunos piensan * ) , which can be seen like a provocation . 
  btw , its not like that , this source took the sentence out of place . 
  as far as i know , may wanted to leave clear that if gibraltarians wanted to be british they would be it no matter how much it costed . 
  somehting alike that the uk would side them .

  lol ? 
  none of the mentioned got a 10 % of preaupporta than catalonia has ( 2016-2017 mostly ) . 
  none . 
  you can lie all you want , but it was junker itself the one that refused to recognize it . 
  amd we now know it as a member state . 
  there were official stances ( and not with catalonia fyi ) . 
  eu is n't in crisis ? 
  guesa european leaders launching a `` rebuild europe '' this aniversary was just because they are borred . 
  guess one of its most important members is just a casuality . 
  guess populism rising all over it means nothing . 
  btw , i 'm not mixing it up , all groups had members define it as political trials . 
  do n't wamt to accept it ? 
  ok , but enough demagogy . 
  as i saod , even one epp member did so . 
  alde had no official stance on it till after this trial . 
  now it has . 
  c 's is just a minor group of lots that found alde fyi . 
  `` most '' and yet you only find an example lol . 
  anyways , you can go fuck yourself , gpt tired of your demagogy . 
  minimal ? 
  no other selfdetermination movement has got as much supports as catalonia ( apart from colonies ) . 
  and lol ? 
  catalonia 's * full de ruta does not require an unilateral secession * ( basically because acording to the hague , its not unilateral if the other part does n't tend its hand to negotiate ) , ehat it aims at is aproving the transition laws , something that would force intermational comunity to step in and therefore force a referendum . 
  btw , eu , before its referendum , aaid that it would not recognize it . 
  yet , a few years later they welcomed them as a member state . 
  amd now , the eu is in a deep crisis due to brexit . 
  they have shown a hughe flexibility lately . 
  and about nato ... 
  there was a referendum on spain on whether to join or not to join nato . 
  the yes won everywhere but on catalonia , basque country and half canarias . 
  a lie ? 
  not only all of the parlimentary groups have had mps openly talk againt those political trials ( even the epp , with a polish mp ) , but alde has took an official stance of support for catalonia 's referendum and a total refuse of those trials . 
  a couple of days after mas 's sentence if i 'm not wrong . 
  yes ? 
  like which ones ? 
  france ? 
  where nova caledonia will hold one next year ? 
  ot where north catalonia will hold a non-vinculant one ( like 9n ) in 2018 too ? 
  in switzerland ? 
  because its pm has offered its governament to `` give spain lessons of direct democracy '' answering a question from a members of the party of the grens . 
  norway ? 
  who has created a comission for catalan process . 
  oh , no . . turkey more likely , huh ? 
  sweetheart , that 's what i was talking about on the first comment . 
  idgaf if you were n't talking about it , the comment wasnt directed at you . 
  and lol ? 
  we have had supports from russia to us , from uk to china ( surprisingly ) , from denmark to baltic states . 
  states do n't enter internal disputes until they arent internal anymore . 
  catalonia has broken this rule on quite a few cases . 
  and even with that , catalonia 's governament plan ( we will see if it goes how they intended it ofc ) is simply to force intermational community to step in . 
  and if they step in what do you think the result would be ? 
  a referendum or ignoring a peaceful momevemt that only asks to vote ? 
  i bet its quite easier to sell a ballot than supporting political trials ( not my words , words of european mps from all groups ) . 
  neither there 's an scenario on which catalonia becomes independent and madrid refuses to negotiate the terms of the separation , yet its politicians keep defending so , so all i 'm doing is representing this nonplausible situation . 
  yet , if you keep taking stuff out of context i 'll simply silence you . 
  repeated ? 
  lol . 
  the * upper hand * , would more likely be all the exterior support shows in any cases . 
  in any case its said that it would n't require a negotiation , which is between what people wants . 
  lol ? 
  serbia did had negotiation about the debt ( forced , but it had it ) . 
  ** that 's ** what i 'm talking about .
