  there is no simple case that has had no negotiation at all ( except somaliland and such , which are n't comparable ) . 
  you are talking about an scenario with negotiation ( on which i agree ) n but even though of being like a 0.01 % possible , spaniards main political forces still defens that there would be none at all . 
  do n't you dare to hit sagrada familia !, 
  everyone it !, 
  it will assume it . 
  not if things got ugly ( because of spain lets supose ) though . 
  and nope , debt isnt regional , in this case is statewide . 
  in an hipotetical two states situation , debt would have to be paid by the same state that obtained it , hence why your greece example would n't work . 
  this said , though , separations ( you can just look into the 2 years talks for brexit ) take negotiation in order to divide up actives , pasives , etc. 
  that scenario ( which as i said would only be on a really ugly situation ) , would require , a zero negotiation momentum . 
  also , please dont mix up regional and stateeide debt , the one that is more than a 100 % of the gdp is spain 's statewide public debt, 
  spanish politicians ( from rightwing major party , pp , to the more leftist party on parliment , podemos ) have been pressing a ** lot ** on getting a cosovereignity over the city ( not sovereignity because , acording to polls , gibraltarians feel brittish and not spanish ) , till the point that spain 's exterior minister , maragallo , literally said `` i 'll place the spaniah glag , and a lot faster than some think '' . 
  as you can imagine , this is more than a provocation at diplomatic level . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.google.es/amp/politica.elpais.com/politica/2016/10/06/actualidad/1475736600_039904.amp.html ) a video of him saying it . 
  note : the fascist spanish party vox 's leader , santiago abascal , was [ arrested ] ( https://www.google.es/amp/www.elespanol.com/espana/20160620/133987064_0.amp.html ) because of putting an spanish giant flag over gibraltar 's * rock * at the shout of * gibraltar espa\u00f1ol !, 
  * ( gibraltar spanish !, 
  ) , which as far as i know is ilegal on there ( putting a flag on the rock i mean ) . 
  note2 .0 : i personally belive that this gibraltar drama is what has brought uk 's chamber into creating a parlimentary group comiasion of support for catalan referendum . 
  lol . 
  there has already been confrontations btw both polices/armies more than one ( not this year , in arround 2008 you already had them ) . 
  anyways , i meant that may said this * in case spain did anything that could damage british sovereignity on the city * , not on past stuff, 
  do n't think it would work well !, 
  ceuta and melilla 's do n't work unless there are a couple of guardia civil murders arround such as in tarajal : /, 
  lmao , you are from asturias . 
  referendum is a thing that has ro be held in catalonia , not asturias so its irrelevant really . 
  and btw , catalonia refusing to pay its part of the debt its a card that will be played only if spain plays dirty ( such as vetoing into the eu ) , nothing that anyone ( me included ) wants to do . 
  but with your lovely governament who knows . . 
  ikr lol, 
  there 's ** none ** . 
  the difference btw both cases is that its cititzens want to be british , but dont want to be spanish . 
  really ? 
  then i guess than north catalonia should n't be french too ? 
  also granada shoudl n't be spanish . 
  nor burgundy french , normandy french ... heck , germany shouldnt even exist then , right ? 
  i 'd recomend you to study some spanish histroy and literature , especially the so called * generaci\u00f3n del 98 * . 
  nowadays , spain is as ** pre ** generaci\u00f3n del 98 spain was . 
  vox is just the most extremist on it . 
  the main party in spain 's chamber has supported it . 
  podemos , the most leftist party on the chamber has supported it too . 
  and well , i wo n't even talk about spain 's libertas . . 
  spain 's . 
  and yeah , troll or whatever , but the public debt is still there, 
  yeah , just +100 % of your gdp ... ( +150 % if catalonia refuses to pay its part ) you know ... a couple of cents, 
  erm ... nope . 
  its just the post98 complex striking in spain again, 
  they did . 
  before first referendum , as an strategy to scare off catalonia . 
  now , though , there 's the postbrexit gibraltar drama , so they now rather have uk as a divided country . 
  yup . 
  yall know quite a bit about building walls, 
  spain would n't last 15 mins more likely, 
  lol ? 
  how is it their land ? 
  yall will have enough work paying your debt , 
  sge never said this . 
  she just said that uk wouldnt accept spain 's actions on gibraltar when neither irs spanish land nor gobraltar inhabitants want to be spanish, 
  lol ? 
  there are quite a few parties that defend cosovereignity on gibraltar ( even when gibraltarians dont want it ) . 
  that 's denmark * denmark * !, 
  lol, 
  we will get them to edit it jn a couple of months , dont worry !, 
  or well . . 
  if they dont we will build a human tower in front of thwir offices to enter thru a window ans do it ourselves !, 
  till september yes . . 
  spain 's logic is weird lol . 
  do n't let people that does n't want to be part of your country leave but instead try to annex territories that also dont want to be part of your country, 
  how can you even log in with that username ? 
  yup , it mat already be russian land by then !, 
  note : just messing arround , please do n't get offended if you are from ukraine !, 
  lol . 
  actually did a post awhile ago with a mixt up of uk 's and catalonia 's flag : https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/5zy54x/flag_of_the_uk_if_scotland_was_switched_for/, 
  there are a couple , yes , but you will find more barcelona ( city ) flags than scotish really ... ( not that demonstrations are different ), 
  hey brits !, 
  if we declare independence and then declare war on you will y' all annex us ? 
  [ we can have a hawt flag ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/5zy54x/flag_of_the_uk_if_scotland_was_switched_for/ ) !, 
  not gon na show you basic maths , i 've got other things to do . 
  just use this website meanwhile  percentagecalculator.net as you will see , its a +16 % with catalonia only , not 15 with both regions, 
  ok , you simply dont know how to get a percentage then lol . 
  anyways , i 'm not gon na argue dumb maths with you . 
  spain has nothing to decide over catalonia . 
  take care . 
  never heard anout plebiscitary votes ? 
  second spanish republic was voted that way smartpants edit : added response after he edited his response, 
  catalonia is by itself +16 % of spain 's population . 
   vote participations are usually under 50 % lol ? 
  27s ( 2015 ) had a turnout of a 77 % , a 68 % in 2012 . 
  and so on , so stop lying please . 
  anyways , have fun in your own world lol . 
  why not count it ? 
  the governament was alive anyways , the only time it has been * stopped * was after secession war ( and regencies ) , and restored by carlists later on . 
  [ here ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/president_de_la_generalitat_de_catalunya ) a full list since spanish version misses most of its history . 
   seems like an interesting topic can assure you it is !, 
  its set on 19th century nationalist movements , on political catalanism in this case , which kinda creates some of the bases of catalan independentism . 
   but not all have their own civil code nor their own police force i think . 
  you are totally right !, 
  that was the reached limit on the so known * caf\u00e9 para todos * , since those were keept by historic reasons only . 
  you do n't recall correctly . 
  2014 's neither was a referendum nor was boycotted . 
  simply , there was some sectors that do not want to vote on a referendum , as there are on all of them . 
   if turnout is low because only one side is n't turning out you have an issue , if turnout is average and both sides are turning out you do n't have an issue .
