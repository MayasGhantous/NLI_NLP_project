  and that 's the deal , pp and c 's defineself determination referendums as antidemocratic , and therefore , the sector they represent would not vote , but as i said , they are a minority . 
  csqp and psc , are two main prorederendum parties , which do not agree on independence but would support celebrating it . 
  hence , why i said that pp/c 's would not be relevant . 
  and no , an hypotetical win , would probably oscilate between a 50 and a 65 % ( guessing pp and c 's does not participate ) , which is n't really far from the real opinion ( 27s plebiscitary elections ended up with a 48 % of support , a 39 % against it and the rest , an 11 % , by a party , csqp that did n't want to be counted as `` yes '' or `` no '' due to holding both independentists and nonindependentists ) . 
  also , those elections had the highest historical turn out on catalan regional elections . 
  i do underestand your view on the 80 % though . 
   in my view 51 % would be enough touch\u00e9 then !, 
  i simply do n't get when other people says that 51 % is enough since is ignoring a majority to listen to a minority . 
  erm ... nope . 
  if you manifest your wish to keep it you do n't lose it . 
  you would lose it in case you accepted one from a country spain has no agreements with without manifesting that you want to keep it . 
  there 's an small but ** really important ** difference . 
  they were boycotted too , just not by lots of people . 
  if someone boycotts it it would be pp and c 's sector , which is a minority of the population , so my comment stands . 
  it would be hard if there was a 40 % , as it was in 2014 's participative process , but i can assure you it would n't go down from 60 % ( 73 % according to ceo polls ) . 
  anyways , if all goes as catalonia 's governament plan , it will be official . 
  why ? 
  as you may know , spain oposes it , but catalonia , has prepared what they call * transition laws * ( somekind like brexit 's ) , which would create a new legislation . 
  this , would force the international community to step in , and either get them to make spain accept the referendum or back spain , something that imo would be really strange , since , eventhough with spain 's pressions , lots of diplomats , mps , etc have steped in for catalonia 's referendum the last two yeras . 
  actually , the uk created a comission ( with members of all parties ) which intends to follow and support a `` democratic answer for catalonia '' ( after denmark , switzerland and norway parliments did ) . 
  what i do n't get though is this +55 % ( or another number , i underestand is an example ) . 
  i mean ... would it be democratic to say that a 51 % is n't enough but at the same time say that what a 49 % is enough ? 
  it sounds kinda * demos * - breaking, 
  it is . 
  well , this and the `` its unconstitutional '' thing , which is kinda hypocrite since main governament is the first one to not follow constitution when it does n't want to . 
   i do n't think so do you notice that not only half of them are leftist parties like erc and psc but that most ciu governaments were supported by then other two leftist parties ? 
  also , yes , catalonia has its own civil code . 
  spain wanted to unify them in 19th century , but after a long political crisis , spain ceded to catalan lliga regionalista and did n't remove it . 
  study the * bases de manresa * for more details of that political crisis . 
  btw , you should add that other ccaas have this too ( in order to not make it think like its a one-region thing ) . 
  if you go arround catalonia , you will see * esteladas * ( proindependence flag ) and * senyeras * ( catalan national flag ) everywhere , so it is really strong . 
  this said , though , this is n't the only worry , since there is a lot of unemployment , a low economy , etc. 
  comparing it to 2014 's participative process ( not a referendum ) is just simple and plain demagogy . 
  catalonia 's governament , acording to their plan , intends to use the so called * translition laws * , which for a lawyer work as an udi which would create a new legislation on which a referendum would be legal . 
  this , would ** force ** the international community to step in either for the referendum or for spain . 
  and honestly doubt they will opose a referendum on a situation like that . 
  that 's wrong . 
  in 2014 , spain 's governament banned the referendum , and catalonia 's governament , turned it into a * participative process * which did n't intend to have a real effect but blink an eye on international community and know what cititzens though . 
  it had a 40 % of participation . 
  other referendums in europe , have been accpeted as valid ith a lower turn out, 
  brexit did n't require those percentages . 
  nor did scottland 's ( with the no ) , nor ireland 's , spain 's second republic plebiscitary elections ... 
  did their old constitution , though , say that no one can lose their nationality if they do n't wish to ? 
  spain 's does . 
  it would be way more of a 50 % if a referendumj is held . 
  a 20 % of people said they would n't vote on it , so they would n't be counted on real terms, 
  that 's bullshit from unionists . 
  why would catalans then want to stay on the eu then ? 
  they are a giving region . 
  really ? 
  in 27s , exterior votes were won by jxsi , a catalan proindependence coalition, 
  they wouldn not have to choose if they didnt want to . 
  ever heard about double nationalities ? 
  heck , i know a person with 4 of them ( spanish is one ), 
  so a 51 % wouldnt be enough to decide but a 49 % would ? 
  lol ? 
  that 's actually a nice word to describe c 's . 
  they relreaent the darkest part of politics ( for both catalans and spaniards ), 
  you are quite wrong . 
  not only lost of those ( i 'm one of them ) are proindependentists , but also , ceo said that on a referendum a yes would won . 
  why ? 
  because a 20 % refused to vote , which gives independence a huuughe boost, 
  but unless you are from spain 's libertas ... 
  spain is spain . 
  dont mix europe on that lol, 
  bring me with you brits !, 
  you know you love our beaches !, 
  so why even talk about it then ? 
  and of course they are different !, 
  there are n't two comparable cases . 
  neither kosovo not hong kong , neither cuba not scotland , neither nova caledonia nor puerto rico . 
  and so on , but ( correct me if i 'm worng on you ) , antireferendum spaniards tend to compare whenever its possitive for them and then refuse to when its negative . 
  the reason of spain 's union as we underestand it nowadays was spanish secession war , not aragon pu . 
  shall i remember that this war ended with the institutions , civil liberties and special status of lots of regions ? 
  ( not catalonia only ) . 
  if you ( as a general reference , not you you ) defend self determination on countries that united like the uk you should do the same for ( some ) spanish regions too . 
  but well , there seems to be somekind of selective amnesia when it comes to this . 
  btw , do n't mix ccaas on here , those are a mixt up of historical regions and literal make ups , which you should identify as noncomparable ( what i said , amnesia ) . 
  it has n't . 
  you have plenty of books that mentioned catalonia before that as a politucal union of catalan counties . 
  and even with that , catalonia has declared independence a few times . 
  last one was during spanish civil war, 
  1 ) there are eu alternatives 2 ) catalonia is wrll placed geographically . 
  mediterranean corridor is an economic need for italy , framce and spain , and it has had huge investments already 3 ) not everyone is proeu, 
  same here . 
  both * senyera * and * estelada * ( proindependence flags ) are everywhere . 
  well , and bar\u00e7a ones too to be fair, 
  nah ... mariano rajoy 's governament just pays for fake proofs for polotical trials such as the one against xavier trias . 
  or well . . to microsoft for ther famous powerpoints . 
  they were announced in 2015 , and what a surprise !, 
  ignored later on , eventhought of having accepted eu 's money for mediterranean corridor . 
  heck , catalan ibex members didnt even go to rajoy 's conference due tp their escepticism ... ibex members , who are suppsed tp be closer to pp than anyone . 
  edit : i have n't downvoted anything sweetheart, 
  note : those investment announcements were made in 2015 too . 
  hope you enjoy it !, 
  nice !, 
  last year i went on a thursday it was totally okay . 
  there 's quite a few people the whole week but on weekends there may be too much people , so i 'd recomend going middle-week . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.gironatempsdeflors.net ) you have the official website , which also includes lista of restaurants , hotels , etc. 
  i do n't know much about girona hotels due to not living really far from it , so would n't be much of a help :( btw , have you checked out tripadvisor ( or whichever website is used where you live ) ?
