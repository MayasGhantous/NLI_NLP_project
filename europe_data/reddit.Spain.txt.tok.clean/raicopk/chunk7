  yeah , the uk ia full of xenophobic attacks against spaniards but spainiards welcomes them with the arms open . 
  smh . 
  there 's dumb people everywhere , and spain does n't stay behind on the list . 
  if you want to justify ukfobia with that you have a problem , cuz then they couls also rightfully call us p.i.g.s. 
  i 'm antibrexit and antieu at the same time ( + later ) , but proscottish referendum . 
  1 ) i 'm againt the eu as how i see it today . 
  i 'd be willing to give all my sovereignty , or found any * superstate * , but not at any price . 
  i want nothing to do with countries who 's mps say that women are less smart and weaker . 
  i want nothing to do with countries ruled by parties foundeds by fascists . 
  i want nothing to do with countries who 's mps suggest putting pog heads on fences to scare refugees . 
  and so on . 
  this said though , i would n't think it twice to give up any sovereignity my country had in order to build an humanitary and democratic country . 
  so why i 'm against brexit then ? 
  well , brexit had the oposite point of view of the eu than i do . 
  2 ) being from catalonia , you can probably underestand why i support their referendum ( and kurdistan 's , vall d'aran 's , hong kong 's . . ) . 
  but if i was scottish , i 'd probably opt for the no ( maybe brexit could change it ) . 
  i mean , although not knowing as much as i wish about their situation , i 'd probably be closer to scottish independentists than to prouk 's side , but having an state that cared for you ( even a little bit only , idk ) would make a hughe difference against an state that ... well , called you * nazi * for the same . 
  and kosovo ? 
  according to the hague it wasnt ilegal . 
  yet they are more reticent on recognizing it and not vetoing it than serbia, 
  well . . the rest of the world ... 
  [ here ] ( https://plus.google.com/communities/115206103919246392275 ) you have a google + comunity with plenty of screenshots . 
  i was just messing . 
  i do like it due to its smooth and `` smart search '' though . 
  hey !, 
  you !, 
  did n't your teacher show you that evie is the best launcher ? 
  gosh , what an educative system ... 
  showing mats and not evie !, 
  hence why its not `` well '' at all , it should be . 
  this people have been allways arround , they are not new . 
  their supports are new . 
  but do you know the worst part of this ? 
  that right wing will become even more rightish , and leftwing more central . 
  its not only an `` extremist '' and the rest being normal , everything moves . 
  i hope you are joking ... 
  gosh ... 
  this launcher ... long live evie launcher !, 
   netherlands rejected populism massively their elections , was one of those days on which even leftish get happy seeing a rightwing party win . 
  if that 's going well for you ... 
  there 's racist people everywhere js, 
  lol , what do you hope a group like epp will do ? 
  nationalisms are n't antieu only . 
  and main european counteies would have had an important international scene anyways, 
  smartpants , a refugee is n't the same than an ilegal immigrant . 
  if you are gon na reply please leave racism apart , kty !, 
  ` merica, 
  [ another view ] ( http://www.enciclopedia.cat/sites/default/files/media/foto/fg002939.jpg ), 
  such an stunning place, 
  but they are n't alone on that lol, 
  hey !, 
  you !, 
  there are kids arround !, 
  ikr lol . 
  i mean . . if their goal is to `` create terror '' , ehy wouldnt they take advantage of those situations ? 
  well , to be fair spanish media even ignored another spanish mp ( or was this one ? 
  i forgot ) bragging about having destroyed catalan sanitary system, 
  of course it does . 
  in international community though , in spain this gives you votes sadly . 
  neither . 
  uk and greece should be part of `` revulutionary '' part due to its history, 
  no lol, 
  they do n't care about it ? 
  i guess they voted the plebiscite cuz they had nothing to do , huh ? 
  and no , unionism not having manifestations is because its not atractive to sell a `` we dont want a referendum '' idea . 
  as it wouldnt be to get an antilgtb demonstration, 
  and your point is ... dwarm refered to 6000 people , 6000 people counting buses that came from all spain with members of the fascist francisco franco foundation , from the far-right scc , the xenophobic pxc and espa\u00f1a 3000 and the spanish libertas . 
  and to make it even better , the far-right organitzation dol\u00e7a catalunya as source . 
  btw , there 's plenty of catalans that are proindependentist too and do n't feel the need of demonstrations too , so your argument is pointless, 
  different languages . 
  in balearic islands it should appear catalan ( as you can see in catalonia , and although its political debate , valencia ) . 
  about ukraine , if i 'm honest , idk much about their linguistic situation . 
  also note that this is a general map : italy by itself is completely complex by languages . 
  eu official languages * :p, 
  forgot the points on balearic islands , 
  that 's just waaaaaaay subjective ... 
  amazing . 
  just ... amazing !, 
  sooo ... now selfdetermination right is just for the regions that are poor ? 
  the others can fuck off ? 
  btw , 3conomy is the last motive for catalonia 's independence nowadays . 
  france ? 
  the one that has allowed a referendum on nova caledonia ? 
  or the one with a member running for the elections that openlu defended a referendum for catalonia ? 
  its a cathedral built up on a high alture . 
  and that was the normal idea for cathedrals back then, 
  well , to be fsir it has been designed by gaudi experts that wanted to give him a tribute . 
  gaudi was unique . 
  although he did design some impressive shit for his time ( he talked about prohectors , which were reeeeeeally rare by then , pointing at the central tower ) . 
  sadly he didnt finish the designs, 
  i may change ny mind in 2026 , but till then , once sagrada familia is finished , girona will be my fav city :p, 
  you should try * temps de flors * festival if you havent !, 
  went there last edition . 
  they gained a permanent visitor !, 
  lol, 
  think they are smart enough to read the title, 
  this is mainly due to history . 
  eixample , though , has an interesting history behind its design ( which was kinda ignored though ) . 
  and some more pictures from my * crush city * : - from the [ river ] ( https://www.goldcar.es/assets/img/oficinas/background/gro-5.jpg ) - what 's called [ call jueu ] ( http://equipatgedema.cat/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0437-1.jpg ) - [ temps de flors ] ( https://www.google.es/search?espv=2&amp;biw=1360&amp;bih=638&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=girona+temps+de+flors&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjpq6vzkujsahxjvxqkhutrblaqhyyigg ) - google search to see different editions from the [ festival ] ( http://www.gironatempsdeflors.net/cat/inici.php ), 
  sooo ... not ascension island ?
