  and more countries . 
  you want , and that 's fair , but you can keep all yankies then !, 
  and ? 
  totally !, 
  that 's why they give street names to barmans of fascist bars , why they sent fascist christmas greetings thru facebook ... you know !, 
  things communists do !, 
  sheez, 
  well ... 
  being called * polaco * ( polish ) as a reference to the catalans that were sent by franco to poland concentration camps , is n't exactly what we call polite on here ... idk on there tho, 
  they were recovering from cuba/filipines independence wars , and had lots of problems ( such as four or five nationalist movements ) , but first world war gave a huge boost to its economy ( till 1920 , then there was a crisis again lol ) . 
  i ca n't assure it was , but i think so . 
  identity , in this case , is just an excuse to fight for two different views . 
  i can assure you , that the sectors in catalonia that would be willing to build an european state are mostly proindependentist . 
  why ? 
  they want it , but not at any price . 
  that would n't be catalonia 's case , i can assure you . 
  not with regions such as * vall d'aran *, 
  6000 persons acording to guardia urbana . 
  ** 6000 ** , out of 7 milions of people, 
  erm ... its not like they waved spain 's flags ... 
  note : that 's [ not ] ( https://chibacity.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/5.png ) spain 's flag, 
  not fundacion francisco franco, 
  there were waaaaay more than plenty of [ those ] ( https://chibacity.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/5.png ) . 
  that 's not spain 's flag sir . 
  exactly . 
  kosovo had armed groups fighting for independence , meanwhile catalonia is going for a peaceful and democratic process . 
  france is holding an independence referendum just this year ... lol and also , french catalonia will have a referendum ( without an official result ) in 2018 . 
  their constitutional court defined it as freedom of speech, 
  1 ) nationalisms ( you forgot aragonese , galician , andalucian and valencian ones ) were before franco . 
  2 ) the one with dangerous ideas is spanish nationalism nowadays . 
  catalonia 's is a nationalism that breaks with the idea of this word, 
  what europe ca n't afford is refuse to hear people, 
  actually catalonia would be one of the easiest suports into forming a mega-state, 
  its a looong story , here some of the most-popular reasons : - different culture and language . 
  catalans , do n't feel they are safe ( the culture and language ) in spain . 
  - not being able to hold a referendum . 
  lots of people ( me included ) , were n't proindependentist , but thought that a referendum was the only democratic way to solve this out . 
  spain absolutely oposed it , making some people lose its hope on this state . 
  - incompatibility of ideologies , a lil bit like canada and quebec . 
  - a long-way stereotipes ( there was a popular term used to talk about catalans which was ** polaco ** , polish , term which refered to catalans that were deported to extermination camps in poland in second world war ) . 
  - having mps ( such as * jordi ca\u00f1as * ) comparing catalans with ku klux klan because of wanting a referendum . 
  - being openly acused by main newspapers of being nazis ( abc ) or talibans ( el espa\u00f1ol ) , and other ofences such as those . 
  - economy . 
  that 's allways a matter . 
  spain has a system on which some regions pay more than the others , with the exception of navarra and basque country , which have their own financial system . 
  - and the matter that started it ( 2011 ) : psoe governament , promised to accept catalonia 's new estatut , and after catalonia aproved it through a referendum , they did n't only opose its aprovation , but the other major spanish party , popular party , started a campaign in spain seeking for signatures against it ( got 40.000 i belive ) . 
  this was seen as a back stab . 
  because this was organitzed by far right ( 6000 persons assisted acording to police ) , meanwhile republican flags are usually waved by leftish people, 
  the offense is who did it . 
  the manifestation was organized by scc , a far-right organitzation , hence why there were members from * francisco franco foundation * on there, 
  erm ... 
  they were 6k of manifestants , with quite a few franquist flags and shouting `` articulo 155 ya '' . 
  btw , * dol\u00e7acatalunya * is part of scc , a far * right organitzation, 
  you are being critic about brits coming to spain and not willing to learn the language , but when this is done by an spaniard in b. 
  country , catalonia , balearic islands , galicia , etc. 
  its seen as okay . 
  the most voted party was literally funded by an spanish minister of fascist spain ( franco 's era ) . 
  and that 's leaving them out of organizing tributes for [ franco and hitler ] ( http://www.larazon.es/espana/franco-y-hitler-protagonistas-en-las-fiestas-de-guadamur-aa12651133 ) , etc, 
  actually i meant it because spain was n't `` destroyed '' . 
  it was actually making money from europe , so kinda odd its compared to france . 
  pfft . 
  that may not be a priority for you , for me it totally is !, 
  btw , if you want some european strong forces just go for an european army , nato is basically an excuse for us to keep its imperialism up . 
  the one with top votes was founded by a minister of fascist spain ( franco 's era ) . 
  not much more needed to say really ... and c 's has been proved to have lots of relations with far-right ( from frendship with spain 's * alt-right test * vox , to a former c 's mp being the vicepresident of the far-right organitzation * societat civil catalana * ), 
  lol , spain has n't even declared ilegal the newspaper that used to do those [ covers ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=abc+hitler&amp;espv=2&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjag9nqr-xsahvjslqkhyycbnmqsaqiga&amp;biw=1360&amp;bih=638 ) , so there 's quiiiiite some flexibility :p, 
  yeah , tell that to edward snowden , sweetheart, 
  immigration is n't a right . 
  assylum for refugees is a human right . 
  its not that hard to underestand the difference between migrants , refugees and internally displaced people . 
  those stereotypes happen everywhere . 
  uk is no exeption . 
  spain is no exception . 
  germany is no exception . 
  and so on ... 
  i have been called way worse stereotipes , js . 
  the saddest part is that spaniards defend doing this in regions of its country where other languages are spoken . 
  you know ... its called karma . 
  does this mean yankies leave ? 
  cuz it will disband before any other referendum can take place ? 
  nice !, 
  you are totally gon na get a 6.0 earthquake on there !, 
  in both scotland and catalonia it would be a situation that we do n't honestly know of . 
  european laws do n't talk about new states , so there 's no official policy . 
  if they were independent and recognized , spain would veto them both as it does with kosovo , but i personally do n't think it would work ( unless there were more vetos ) . 
  in the baltic states , europe threated them with not accepting them into in and look at them now . 
  also note , that according to spanish constitution ( idk about scottland ) , catalans ( not new born ones ) would still have european cititzen due to not losing spanish one , and i belive 7milion of cititzens are an important share . 
  catalonia is strongly proeu , yes , but they do n't really belive spain would veto catalonia . 
  why ? 
  - to veto us they would have to recognize us as an state . 
  its not possible to veto a region . 
  - catalonioa , in this case , which holds the biggest regional gdp in spain , could refuse to pay its part of national debt in spain ( with is +100 % of gdp counting catalonia ) . 
  - luckily , catalonia has an important geostrategic location , not only for mediterranean corridor ( that france and italy need but that spain spent the eu subsides on other things ) but for its turistic importance . 
  - eu is in a deep crisis nowadays , and not only that : a few countries of its are constantly fighting to not lose to the far-right . 
  would an organitzation like that , would be willing to leave a region where its rightwing is like france 's leftwing ? 
  anyways , if scotland or catalonia are vetoed , they have other options such as efta . 
  lol . 
  maybe if you writte to mods they would add it :p, 
  yes !, 
  we have heard quite a lot of hong kong for example .
