both problems can be solved with latest-generation reactor designs that can use the depleted fuel from older reactors ** as the fuel source ** , yielding as a by-product much less-radioactive and much less-lengthy waste . 
  newer reactors can be the solution to the older ones ' problems , so that the latter do n't need to be shut down immediately , but as planned . 
  being `` the best '' out of a practice that probably has no way of being any good is n't saying a lot . 
  the fact that for a `` comedy '' it has relatively few plays on words works in its favour no doubt , but it 's still horrid if you simply compare the versions . 
  it is a disgrace . 
  as are the nahuatl and various other languages indigenous to mexico and central america . 
  what i 'm getting at is that it 's also their prerrogative . 
  i believe the people should be able to choose what to do with the folklore and the languages ( which are for the most part no longer useful in an increasingly modernised world ) , and just as what happened during franquismo was horrible and hopefully never to be repeated , i also consider it a bit absurd for the government to try and force it down everyone 's throats ( having euskera be worth more points than literally everything else that speaks to your expertise and competency for public opositions , for instance ) when half of bilbao does n't speak it ( and i 'm talking natives , do n't get me started on how this affects migratory issues ) , not to mention the whole euskaltegi corruption/nonsensical business . 
  but i understand this was probably to be expected for a few years after such a regime as a matter of overcompensation . 
  but then it can get to absurd situations like having people ignore/scoff at you when you try to ask them something in spanish , in motherfucking barcelona ( aka ; a city whose economy is heavily based on tourism ) . 
  anyways , i digress . 
  i 'm not sure i agree about what the future holds , and while i think a collective identity is important for some people , i do believe/hope that the younger generations are arriving with less radical ideals against an imaginary enemy that 's been inherited from their grandparents , and who they sure as hell never got to suffer . 
  i think it 's safe to say they 're rather uninterested . 
  defending the culture and the language is a no-brainer , and something not even those of us who are n't for a separation are against . 
  oh yeah , i 'm not saying you should n't have the right to complain . 
  i 'm saying that by not participating in democracy , you 're just a whiner , and demonstrably very much a part of the problem . 
  people are indeed free to be stupid . 
  just as i 'm free to remind them of how stupid they are . 
  while continuing to complain about the situation ? 
  because in practice the royal family has no real power here , much like in the uk . 
  if they were smarter they could really make themselves more useful , and gain the people 's favour , but alas . 
  i believe so . 
  they might very well have bought an extra decade or two . 
  if he ( felipe ) does really well , he might even convince the people that a monarchy has advantages over a republic . 
  but to get to that point he 'd probably need to solve a couple of international crises or something . 
  no kidding . 
  this kind of reasoning is dangerous . 
  it 's the same reason i 'm so afraid that so many in my generation have taken to refusing to vote `` because what 's the point ? 
  `` you either die a hero '' ... 
   so when a referendum comes up eg the fiscal treaty that wasnt drawn up when the nearest national election took place how can you say the government adequately represent people 's views on it ? 
  again , this is how democracy works , and this is what choosing a representative means . 
  it 's the exact same way with national issues that come up after the elections . 
  it does not mean people are getting lied at or cheated , as these have been the terms from the beginning . 
  i tire of explaining this . 
   people vote for national representatives on the basis of national issues , not european ones please , speak for yourself . 
   its a legally obliged under our constitution ok then , that 's why i added the disclaimer . 
  good on your country if the population is happy with that arrangement , but not every country has such an arrangement , and it 's not a bad thing . 
  if we were discontent with the current situation , we 'd change it ( as indeed some citizen movements in some countries have ) . 
   now are you honestly saying had the citizens in every member state gotten a vote that their collective vote would match their governments ? 
  i 'm not a wizard , but i 'm pretty sure in general terms this would be the case , yes . 
  and , again , whenever this does n't happen people get voted out and either the opossition replaces them , or new parties are created to represent the complex issues . 
   if proper democracy was practised the eu would be significantly different than it is now . 
  i 'm sorry but this is just inflammatory demagogy . 
  and again , false ( unless you can point out which laws specifically have been broken where to deem it all `` not a proper democracy ) . 
  may i instead suggest an alternate hypothesis , where your personal disagreement with the views on this matter with the majority of the european population tints your view on the facts in a paranoid way ? 
  now , listen . 
  i tire of this discussion where i continue to ask for the basis of your claims , and you continue to do nothing but provide opinions pretending to be facts . 
  you neglect to answer directly ( again , with the falseness of `` the eu is slowly integrating itself without the say so of the national parliaments '' ) . 
  so unless your next comment is something different than this , i will not be responding further , as going in circles is n't the most constructive use of my time . 
   source it ? 
  i mean come on its common sense the epitomal cop-out . 
  no , it is not common sense , hence my request for a source example . 
   citizens of the other member states have not been able to vote on nice , lisbon , rome , fiscal treaty . 
  uhm ... are you familiar with how a democracy works ? 
  people choose representatives , and the representatives make the decisions . 
  that 's how it works on all levels of goverment , and the union level is no exception . 
  if the citizens of other countries ( mine included ) did n't directly vote for individual laws or treaties , it 's because we chose representatives to do it , the exact same way your govenment does n't create a referendum for every law they pass nationally . 
  in countries like yours , where the population is so divided on these sorts of things , it 's a nice gesture to do a referendum , but unless especifically coded into law , not something necessary . 
  in these ( like mine ) `` other countires '' people are n't up in arms about it , and people who disagree will simply vote differently in the next election . 
  the way democracy works . 
  either way , even with your `` common sense '' explanation , it 's clear that your claim :  the eu is slowly integrating itself without the say so of the national parliaments is hyperbolic , needlessly inflammatory , deceitful , and completely and utterly false . 
  you 're going to have to source this claim , because i ca n't think of a single example that even loosely resembles what you 're saying . 
  mexico is north america too , fyi . 
  but see , now you 're arguing for separation for separation 's sake , in the name of some sort of historical continuity or even national pride . 
  i do n't consider those to be very constructive arguments on which to make important political decisions . 
  but to counter with the same sort of argument , if the irish people of ** today ** wanted it , then why the hell should they not be able to get it ? 
  they 're not the same who fought for independence ( and a federation should n't have to be a threat to independence , mind you ) , and with how much the world has changed , would n't restricting their choice as to what to do be a far greater threat to independence than a federation ? 
  what i 'm saying is that a federation has some very real and tangible benefits , and using the centuries-old rhetoric appealing to nationalism and independence ( stemmed from times when unifying territories was a forceful and non-democratic process ) to counter it just does n't cut it anymore . 
  there are also some valid arguments against a federation , so if we 're to discuss this , i 'd rather see debated those based on the real world merits and downfalls , rather than tribalistic mentalities . 
  you 're making a lot of assumptions here . 
  your premises are that a ) `` national sovereignty '' is a universally good and desirable thing , and b ) , that `` surrendering it '' is an undisputed evil . 
  some of us consider a ) oftentimes much more a pc excuse for tribalism and xenophobia without any real benefits ( provided the population is still democratically represented ) , , and b ) a very desirable , voluntary action with some very obvious and tangible benefits , as opposed to some very vague `` ideals '' . 
   you can use the tablet charger for phones but not the other way around sure you can , it 's just hella slow . 
  source : i primarily charge my tablet with a 1amp phone charger . 
   it already was somewhat randomly chosen ? 
  they had to start somewhere i guess , but it stands to reason that if the swiss ' actions and attitude do not change on this matter , the rest of the measures shall follow . 
  and no , it was n't random in the sense that it is something that specifically affects the freedom of movement of a part of the population ( as opposed to something entirely different and non-related as was your suggestion ) . 
  iirc , the guillotine clause establishes to some extent the delays until various measures are to be taken . 
  i 'm not exactly sure what your particular beef with this measure is . 
  i get you 're somehow personally angered by the fact that it affects students , but your alternative suggestions make no sense , and whether we agree that students should n't be the first to be affected or not is irrelevant , as it would have followed suit . 
  if i had to guess , i 'd say that they wanted to make a policy change that would be noticeable and significant , but not one that would immediately cause major economic and political halting and caos as would be the case if , for instance , they revoked the swiss ' right to work and live in eu countries without a visa or residence permit . 
  this is a measure that comparatively speaking is much easier to reverse and that much less important consequences to the countries ' functioning . 
  ( university ) students and researchers voted on this measure as well . 
  are consequences to be decided at random ? 
   why do anything then ? 
  because due to the guillotine clause in the bilateral agreement switzerland had signed , this was what was supposed to happen . 
  nothing more , nothing less . 
   but here it means that the people go to voting booths and by choosing an option express their opinion on an issue . 
  yeah , but not exactly . 
  it 's a democratic instrument by which the populace tells their government what it is they want them to pass onto law . 
  in fact , iirc , the results of said referendum are binding for the government in question , in that they have to sign it into law in 3 years ' time . 
   it 's not a question of being ( un ) fair but a question of how to get the desired result . 
  awesome reasoning . 
  / s on a serious note , who says the eu wants to `` get a result '' ? 
   if someone , who you felt has no business of telling you anything , `` punished '' you for expressing your opinion passing a law is not `` expressing an opinion '' . 
  screw your head on straight . 
  with their decision they 're affecting the lives of a lot of ( foreign ) people directly , but now indirectly they 're affecting the lives of their own . 
  and in a completely fair and predictable outcome , no less . 
   and curtailing the freedom of movement of capital would likely make a stronger point and would that point be ? 
  that the eu is a petty control-freak ?
