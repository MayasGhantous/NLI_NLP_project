  which does n't make them '' be right '' in this instance , mind you , they 're certainly quite intolerant if they 're bothered by people in swimsuits . 
  but let 's not pretend harassment does n't happen , and that 's likely a big part of why renting the place out will allow them to have some undisturbed fun . 
  should we not want them to just have fun carelessly ? 
  is that not a big western value in itself that likely would help integration generations down the road ? 
  sure , but my point is that a ) surely even salaffis like to have fun every now and then ( and for them `` fun '' just ca n't be had around infidels showing their bodies ) , and b ) a waterpark seems like a rather silly place to unite for any sort of nefarious purposes . 
  i can see both sides . 
  but in the end i agree : they 're using their money to do this . 
  slightly aggressive sure , but ultimately well within the real of things that should be tolerated in any first world country . 
  i also think a proportion of them might not be doing it aggressively , but rather as a way to have fun without feeling like they have to be perpetually observed and singled out for choosing to dress the way they do . 
  because i 'd have a hard time believing the women going to a waterpark are the kind that are truly oppressed by their husbands and such . 
  still sad , though . 
  wow . 
  are you serious in that you 're unaware of any kind of analysis by mainstream economists or financial institutions ? 
  either way , [ heres a little something to get you started on your quest for knowledge on this matter ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hm-treasury-analysis-the-long-term-economic-impact-of-eu-membership-and-the-alternatives ) . 
   it 's basic supply and demand it 's not , i 'm sorry . 
  i 'm also sorry you 've engaged in the exact same armchair economist handwaving i denounced from op . 
  uhm excuse me but what ? 
  your whole world is organised in accordance to sound economic studies . 
  do you have any sort of systematic evidence to source your claim ? 
  i 'm sorry but it sounds like your implication is that economics as a field of study is mostly invalid , speculation , and/or completely optional to the functioninf of modern society . 
  and that 's just incredibly ignorant in a `` scientologists have valid criticisms of modern psychiatry '' kind of way . 
   our privacy and consumer rights standards will be undermined or the us will sue ( note that suing has no chance to fail in the critics logic , because evil corporate judges ! ) . 
  i do n't think that 's the logic at all . 
  it 's not trivial to allow these ridiculous matters to even get to a court , and it 's not necessary for there to be a possibility for these matters to be won ( although they actually are , is that not the whole function of them being allowed to go to court ? ), 
  for such matters to be extremely undesirable . 
  please do n't discount such an important viewpoint , and do n't be so naive so as to believe that what 's `` right and just '' will always be protected despite anything , or that the ultimate sovereignty of countries would n't be threatened , even in partial manners , with these sorts of deals . 
  it takes a great deal of mental gymnastics , i think , to remain so calm on the face of these measures being introduced as part of these trade deals ( and so non-transparently as they are ) , as if the interested parties were n't doing their ( very economically and legally powerful ) homeworks before going through all the effort . 
  you seem to be right , i was misinformed on the subject . 
  i think the overall point still stands , though . 
   i am explaining why people voted this way and should n't be blamed for it , not that brexit is a good idea i honestly do n't understand your arguments though . 
  you 've argued thus far ( and not merely relayed ) : * that the rich benefit from europe * that the poor do n't * brexit not necessarily a good idea * educated tweens may have selfish biases ergo : * we should n't blame people for voting the way they did ? 
  i 'm sorry , i may be a bit too rigid , but i 'm not quite grasping what your overall argument is , and i think you engaged in quite a bit of goalpost-moving . 
  either people who voted `` leave '' have legitimate arguments and i should n't blame them , or they do n't , and i absolutely can on account of them not doing proper research on something they cast a ~ ~ legally binding ( as is the case for uk referendums ) ~ ~ vote on . 
  you absolutely can not have it both ways . 
  exactly this argument , from all i 've heard , is particularly incomprehensibke to me . 
  but if you want to make a bet out of how lower-classes britons will end up faring in the aftermath of brexit , be my guest : remindme !, 
  3 years, 
   that higher-educated people voted for the right thing because they are smarter except i did n't say that . 
  i said they 're better informed . 
  please do n't put words in my mouth . 
   this argument is brought forward a lot and i do n't buy it . 
  as compelling as your `` sounds logical '' argument is , it simply contradicts extensive consensus from the field of economics . 
  if you want to argue from facts , you 'll need to provide sources . 
  otherwise , emotional rhetoric does n't interest me in the slightest , effective as it might have been during the brexit campaign . 
  and would , from a certain perspective , likely be truthful as well . 
  i see this less as a discriminatory practise than a pragmatic one ; for a multi-year project , when you start out , would you not much rather work with people you 're reasonably certain will still be within your own geopolitical region in 2 years 's time ? 
  do n't get me wrong , this absolutely blows , and uk scientists have my deepest sympathies , for something they likely tried to prevent , but in the end they got fucked over by their own compatriots for mostly racist reasons , and this will be just the beginning of a long list of unfortunate ramifications for the uk . 
  everyone in the uk are benefitting from being in the eu , not just direct grant-receivers . 
  or do you hold , in this very narrow scope of analysis , for instance , that the population ( and indeed the economy ) at large does n't benefit from an increased ( as compared to nationally-supported ) scientific and research activity in general ? 
  op may have worded it wrong , in that it 's far more accurate to speak of the * perception * or * being conscious * of the benefits , rather than actually receiving them ; and it 'd hold true in the sense that indeed higher-educated people in general voted `` stay '' as they 're , indeed , generally more aware than the rest of the population of exactly how beneficial being in the eu turns out to be for the uk . 
  this some trump-level oversimplification here . 
   maybe i 'm too dumb . 
  i did not sugges this . 
   imminent dictatorship this was n't my claim either . 
  my claim was that he would try . 
  but just some off the top of my head : * trying to control the media ( keeping certain news orgs outside the briefings , inviting some non-legitimate yet very in-line with their narrative `` news orgs '' to them ... ) . 
  you might think these are child tactics , and to some extent they are indeed laughable ; but consider how targeted cnn has been , for instance , and the uncharacteristically enthusiastic some of their show hosts were about praising him over syria . 
  * more on the information wars/propaganda : trying to create fake news about his opponents without regard for veracity or even plausibility ( obama wiretapping him , various other conspiracy theories ) ... again , you might think this is idiotic , but he 's got huge segments of the population actually ** believing ** these things , and even the skeptics among us/the media are caught up in an impossibly past-paced news cycle that does n't allow to hold him accountable for the very egregious things that he 's been doing . 
  * disregard for laws and balances . 
  he 's tried to use all his available powers to push his agenda , and even extend them . 
  so far other parts of the government have fought back ( the judiciary shutting down his muslim ban ) , but others are just rolling with it . 
  next in this point to look out for is for him to attempt to expand his actual powers via convincing/coercing the legislative power to grant him more capabilities ( they 've already removed fillibustering for the supreme court confirmations , which is an undisputed , if indirect , reach of the executive branch 's power into the judiciary ) . 
  he literally feels he 's above the law , and has expressed it quite a few times ( shooting someone on the fifth ave. . . ) . 
  and things that have been `` common sense '' , yet not laws ( such as providing his tax returns ) , he absolutely will disregard . 
  * is slowly dismantling various government agencies . 
  * assembled his own intelligence team . 
  would n't want the agencies already in place to interfere in his matters , given , among other things , that their allegiance does n't stand with him directly , but with the interests of the country . 
  * disregard for the actual wellbeing of the population . 
  he wants to repeal and replace obamacare without so much as a study behind how much this will cost and how many people this will affect ( of course we know these things now ) . 
  reducing the bugdet not only for healthcare , but also for education directly and indirectly points towards an inequivocal trend . 
  he 's robbing the public blind with his various trips and security expenses which forces the agencies in charge of his security to take money out of the budget and pay it directly to his hostelry companies . 
  * trying to buy/win over the military . 
  the budget increase for the military has this motivation , plus having the added advantage of making it easier to institute a police state if necessary . 
  * if all else fails , he 's got an escape plan in the form of support/ties from foreign authoritarians , which is the absolute very least his russian ties are about . 
  there are more sinister possibilities , though . 
  * warmongering ( this one is self explanatory ) . 
  and there 's more , but these are the absolutely blatantly evident . 
  this man has been less than 3 fucking months in charge , what do you expect he 'll have achieved by year 's end ? 
  turn on the newscast . 
  now pick up a history book on your totalitarian of choice , get to the chapter about its beginnings . 
  compare . 
  i link them insofar as they all form a part of a global pattern where politics are moving towards the right , with a generalised overarching theme of intolerance . 
  i did not mean to suggest they were comparable in gravity at all . 
  saying `` it 's jusf a vote to leave the union '' is ignoring completely the background of xenophobic rhetoric that a large part of the campaign was based on . 
  which is not to say everyone who voted `` leave '' did it for those reasons , but they did vote for it regardless . 
  it sparked a chain of events that ended up putting may in power . 
  no , it 's not fascism yet , but it 's slowly walking in that direction , for sure . 
  are you for real ? 
  do you believe for a second trump wo n't try to go full dictator until someone or something stops him ? 
  i know what stats you 're talking about . 
  how about you link the source and i 'll explain what 's actually going on , that the sensationalist tabloid you found them in wo n't tell you ? 
   everything to do with their way of parenting which you know has ** everything ** to do with their socioeconomic backgrounds , do n't you ? 
   you do n't see many asian kids in europe making problems , even though they might not have the best financial position at first i 've literally never come across an asian family who were alone , without support , unable to get a job , and barely scraping by . 
  for better or worse , even though they do n't immigrate with tons of money , they do n't exactly come here on boats , alone , and without a plan . 
  they 're also not fleeing from anything , except worse possibilities for social mobility . 
  and everyone knows it . 
  funny , seeing as romanian and latin-american immigrants c children suffer from the issues , which are associated with the same socioeconomic problems . 
  the data does n't support your biases , i 'm afraid . 
  link to evidence of you want to convince anyone next time . 
   it is more and more difficult for white kids to grow up in the bubble that people like me ( and probably most on this subreddit ) grew up in , the bubble where we can simultaneously believe in the long-term harmlessness of immigration while being personally shielded from its immediate harm .
