  i did n't grow up , nor went to school with , in a `` white bubble '' . 
  it may have been a non-poverty bubble , but then that 's just to be expected . 
  i never felt threatened nor in danger from the well educated ethnical minorities i grew up surrounded by . 
  which is not to say your father may not be right , but does he recognise that the fact that immigrants in inner cities tend to be poorer and less educated , is something we could potentially fix with policy ? 
  imagine ubi were implemented in europe tomorrow , and ** all ** legal immigrants did n't have to worry for their immediate sustenance , going through bullshit `` prove you 're trying to find a job to get a miserable social help '' , having to settle for putting your whole family in a rented room in the worst part of town , and obviously , contemplate having to turn to prostitution/dealing/other crime ; all while you take the time to properly learn the language , and perhaps even get some skills training and certifications going , in order to , in a couple of years , be able to ** truly ** join the workforce in an effective capacity . 
  most people who believe immigrant kids are somehow inherently dangerous , violent , or otherwise scary do n't quite understand that children , excepting in grave diseases like autism and such , are absolutely always reacting to the environment them and their parents are living in . 
  my wife is a child-adolescent psychiatrist fwiw , and she says her office is filled with conduct disorders from otherwise psychiatrically-healthy children who , despite living in a first world country , are living in horrible situations that are very difficult address from a social pov , because the problems are the usual mobility barriers getting in the way of climbing out of poverty . 
  and yes , these minority kids are indeed the prototypical `` problem children `` at their respective city schools , and school teachers have them sent to the psychiatrist alarmed , but nobody seems to understand the true , actual real cause for their being like that is fucking poverty , and the feedback loops that prevent their families , well h meaning as they might be , from climbing out of it . 
   which / u/cativellauni has mentioned may not be the case !, 
  to my great alarm , yes . 
  i do n't disagree with what you 've said , but what can be done besides being politically active , voting , and trying to not panic ? 
  i do believe/hope between the real-world repercussions that brexit will have on the uk , combined with what trump will end up doing to the us , in very concrete economic terms ( if nothing else ) , will help dissuade these nationalistic , far-right fantasies amongst those people who see the world as one big conspiracy from which lepen might save them from . 
  but then again there are a few automation/labour crises on the horizon in the next few years , so more economic downturn ( regardless of policy ) will possibly lead to an increasing identification with these radical ideologies . 
  and those are very troubling exceptions , no doubt . 
  well , their intent with the new budget seems to reduce education even more , so ... 
  believe me , i 'm well aware . 
  certainly a reason for europe to remain ever tighter . 
   do n't worry obama care is going down . 
  i do n't doubt this will get done , but boy is it weird seeing people championing this . 
  the tragedy with ignorant people like you is , that you wo n't even realise how fucked this will render you until it 's too late . 
  people from this side of the pond ca n't unfortunately do anything for you poor souls but try and warn you , and see it all unfold before our eyes . 
  i did , but honestly , i do n't engage with those people on here anymore than i try to explain to a drunk patient why i wo n't try to `` negotiate '' anything with them until they 've sobered up . 
  i know they 're disenfranchised and all , but ** willful ** ignorance is something that i refuse to lend any kind of legitimacy or voice to . 
  incompetence has its own way of destroying a country . 
  the gop are all too happy to take this opportunity to remove any and all regulations for businesses , and the fact that he 's slowly dismantling the very agencies meant to , well , regulate different matters is a kind of damage of its own that should under no circumstances be dismissed as clown-like . 
  the guy is a clown , but the us government is n't exactly a perpetual motion machine that will continue churning along effectively during the lack of a very motivated and capable leadership . 
  fortunately the historically strong push for ever better education is n't waning , and if we 're being perfectly honest , most of the support for these emerging far-right political parties stem from old people , who , to put it bluntly , are next up on the chopping block . 
  a few countries have a genuine problem with young people endorsing far-right ideologies , but those are the countries which are suffering the most economically , and we can ** surely ** improve that stuff . 
  slowly ( greece 's problem with all-encompassing , and everywhere-encroached corruption wo n't be solved overnight or merely with cash injections ) , no doubt , but progressively . 
  in this particular matter , such `` stereotypically '' european programs like the erasmus university exchange programs , i believe , are a huge help in slowly changing fatalistic , socially-ingrained corruption cultures . 
  paper ballots are n't terribly secure either , and certainly not accountable on an individual level , other than bluntly counting the votes . 
  you seem to thin we have this figured out , but in the real world , what you call `` inconvenience '' is a ** huge ** factor that in very real ways impede true democracy from happening . 
  well , since you ca n't walk into a computer either , that seems kinds hard . 
  and either if it were possible , then some people would object that the elderly and computer-illiterate would n't be abke to check . 
  no system can be perfect ( although your concern could be addressed ) , but the question is wether we can improve things with technology , and the answer is an undoubted and emphatic `` yes '' . 
   it needs to be 100 % anonymous , if there 's anything that can trace back to you , essentially making it provable that you voted a certain way  of course , the moment you make electronic voting fully anonymous , you open the flood gates to undetectable fraud . 
  i think you might be unaware of how public-private key cryptography can actually achieve this ( and this is in fact how these projects are being coded up ) . 
  assymetric crypto can make it so , on the `` registry '' of votes , my vote appears as an anonymous string of characters that can never be traced back to me , but if it came to a recount , and the government required me to re-derive my public key ( using their private one as well ) , it would come out the exact same way . 
  privacy and accountability at the same time . 
  [ this is an explanation of how asymmetric crypto works for dumbasses like me ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebfamv-_do ) . 
  nobody could coerce me , because to derive the same key that voted , they would also need the government 's key ( or more likely the separate and impartial entity entrusted with the creation of such keys to prevent governments from meddling with the election ) . 
  and my vote would still be completely anonymous . 
  provable if need be , but anonymous . 
   the second of those literally lets you sell your vote . 
  but that 's a matter of presence , is it not ? 
  no matter the technical details , if a person is not forced to physically go to a voting booth so that people can see they 're not being threatened or otherwise co opted , this possibility will always exist . 
  so as a society we can either accept that this will be a possibility , or enable electronic voting that requires physical presence , where the private key to cast a vote is generated on-site , and preferably derived from some personal keys ( like many countries already have personal cryptographic credentials built into their national identity documents ) . 
  see ? 
  shit i had n't even thought about , and now you 're responding to yourself . 
  let me hook you up with more info into that company : https://secure.vote/ https://voteflux.org/about/, 
  cheers !, 
  remember 2018 could be a super defining election . 
  from the outcome of that an impeachment process can be born . 
  jokes can be a coping mechanism . 
  that 's why colbert is so popular even after he stopped being so actively politically sour in his new show . 
  do n't take it as an offense , we 're all horrified about trump , and he has a very good chance of actually fucking the world up for the next few decades . 
  we 'll see what happens today , but france is toying with fascism in their upcoming election . 
  brexit ca n't completely be attributed to trump , but surely there 's some of that as well . 
  laugh with us . 
  `` prospered '' is a strong word . 
  we stopped getting actively fucked by the incumbent party for a few months there . 
  then we had repeat elections and the votes centralised towards that very party . 
  the population here is weird . 
  the real good answer is that if you truly ca n't find a single candidate whose views you can feel represented by ( and i do think in these systems you 'd need to be a very special snowflake for this to be the case ) , you should really start your own party . 
  i know not everyone will want to do this , and some people are just `` against everyone and everything in politics '' , but that 's absurd . 
  it 's of course their right not to participate in democracy , but in my mind , people who do so should lose any right to complain about anything government-related for the duration of the term of the election they skipped . 
  that escalated quickly . 
  were n't pseudonymous blockchains such as bitcoins supposed to solve both the anonymity ( with private/public crypto ) and accountability problems ? 
  i 've heard an australian company is looking into commercialising just the very thing . 
  then again , it 's not my industry , so i imagine my layman ramblings sound about as absurd to you as when people try to tell me why i 'm wrong about my job . 
  i also subscribe to the `` recent dictatorship '' theory . 
  but aside from that , i also think we 've had to live with far more diverse peoples throughout our history , as compared to more northern countries , not to mention our current closeness to african and muslim countries ( with a ton of immigration from them ) . 
  we 've also had to find a way to solve or at least maintain the peace amongst multiple groups that consider themselves separate cultural entities . 
  i do think a generalised need for tolerance in other aspects leads to tolerance in these matters . 
  do n't know , i 'm sure the center-europeans would chalk it up to all the sun we get . 
  that law is up in the chopping block this year , thankfully . 
  that said , please do n't call rajoy `` the spanish trump '' . 
  he 's an asshole who supports all kinds of corruption , but hyperbole like this subtracts impact from the words that are meant to describe horrible situations . 
  when rajoy leaves office we 'll still have a functioning government , which right now is rather plural btw , and afaic see into the future , we do n't have any aspiring autocrats demagogically raising support for institutionalised racism , hate , the dismantling of the social safety net , and the destruction of the environment the way , for instance , france does , or some of the countries from the north . 
  no offense , but pick up a book on bioethics . 
   people should be able to consciously sign away some of their rights this is not something we currently allow under any western legal system . 
  i hope you realise the magnitude of what you 're suggesting , leaving completely aside the fact that you 're responding to a completely different matter , because legality / = ethicality . 
   nobody is forcing them to sign anything . 
  and this , this is a separate matter that should also be considered . 
  one of the arguments against remunerated surrogacy is precisely this . 
  which are similar to those of legalising prostitution . 
   we try to make things as good as possible without undermining freedom . 
  ... which is but one of the ethical issues that surround surrogacy . 
  a contract that would sign away the right of autonomy , is but one of the possibilities being discussed on this very thread , precisely by the people that are denying the fact that there are ethical issues associated with it . 
  your comparison to marriage and driving are false equivalences , for this very reason ( among a few others ) . 
   i say that it is more ethical for governments to provide and assist with such surrogacy contracts than it is for governments to drive surrogacy underground . 
  now ** this ** is a compelling argument , that i thoroughly support . 
  but then perhaps we 'd get into other things of arguments , which are not worth it to get into when we disagree on a more superficial level , but that 's definitely something that should be considered as an important factor . 
  i see in the length of time it takes you to reply to the comments i 'm expending time and mental effort on , exactly how much consideration you 're giving the subject . 
  but no , we 're not saying the exact same things . 
  at least twice you have changed your stance on the actual topic ( the ethicality of it ) , and you do n't seem even willing to see it . 
  thanks for at least not devolving into insults . 
  and please , do consider the book thing . 
  cheers . 
   i never once denied that .
