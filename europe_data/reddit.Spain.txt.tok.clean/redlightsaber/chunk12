  you are denying it in the very following phrase . 
  but i can quote you a few more times where you denied it :  there are ethical issues in most things in life . 
  my point is this is why contracts are written up . 
  --  but if all parties agree to the terms of the contract , then it means all parties agree there are no ethical issues --   `` well they all sign a paper '' does n't mean ethical questions no longer exist . 
  law does n't make ethics obsolete . 
  it is n't her baby to abort . 
  unless the woman is being forced into surrogacy , ** i do not see any ethical issues here . 
  ** ... do i need to keep going ? 
  because these were literally just your comments above . 
  `` signing rights away '' ( certainly fundamental human rights like the right to autonomy ) is n't a thing that 's recognised by any western legal system , let alone something that , even if it existed , would wipe the ethical issues away ( as , might i remind you , you have clearly , repeatedly , and unequivocally denied ) . 
   it is n't a matter of you 're correct and i 'm wrong as much as you 'd like to believe that is that so ? 
  i 'm wrong in saying that no amounts laws could ever take the ethical issues away ? 
  uhm . 
   i never argued there were no ethical dilemmas involved with surrogacy . 
  ... dude  i 'm saying that when all parties are privy to these dilemmas and still agree to it , it should not be an issue for others . 
  that 's not how rights work , i 'm afraid . 
  nor is `` would it be an issue for others '' something we 're even discussing . 
  you 're using ( apparently inadvertently ) straw men arguments completely and failing to understand the root of what is actually being discussed . 
  that 's the only discrepancy here , the degree to which we understand what 's been discussed here , let alone the issue itself to any meaningful depth . 
  again , i implore you to take a step back , and if you 're actually as passionate on the subject as you 're showing to be , pick up an introductory book on bioethics , and get acquainted with the topic at hand . 
  turn this into something you can meaningfully discuss something about . 
  no , this is n't a matter of `` a discrepancy of opinions '' , nor was my argument to compare surrogacy to genocide . 
  i was helping you understand that the argument you 're making ( whether you realise it or not ) is that `` the solution '' to ethical problems seems to lie with laws and contracts , and that that argument is * false * . 
  even if a surrogate mother changes her mind mid-pregancy , but is forced to give up her baby because she signed a contract , ** it does not make the ethical matter solved ** . 
  can you stop for a second believing you 're automatically right , try and pause to consider what the rest of the people on this thread are trying to help you understand , and humbly try and break the argument down in to parts everyone is trying to guide you into ? 
  read the comments several times if you need to , oftentimes i have realised my mistake much later after taking a second look and realising , that no , people were n't out to simply contradict me , but i was simply not even understanthing the nature of the problem in the first place . 
  you are failing to understand that `` ethical concerns '' is not an equivalent term to `` legal grey area '' . 
  the law does not equal what is ethical ( not by a long shot ) ; and i feel a bit confused by your failure to see this . 
  so i 'll give you an absurdist equivalency of what you 're arguing for ( that legality = ethicality ) . 
  in nazi germany , the right to life of jewish people was ** legally ** put into question . 
  clearly ( i hope we can agree to this ? ), 
  such measures ( you know , the extermination of jews ) , although legal at the time , was unquestionably unethical . 
  do you see how your answer to the ethical questions ( `` the answer is to make a contract and make it legally binding ! '' ), 
  is not in any way actually solving the problem ? 
   this is what contracts are for as i said , the problems are of an ethical nature , not a legal one . 
  and forgive me for not considering `` well , the contract she signed says she 's not allowed to keep him '' a satisfactory solution , because it 's not , even though it 's done as so in certain places . 
  like parental rights in the case the surrogate mother decides/feels attached to the baby and gets the idea they might want to keep them themselves . 
  it 's a veritable clusterfuck or rights-trampling that i , as someone who 's been a part of a hospital 's bioethics committee , do n't have a satisfactory answer to . 
  surrogacy is a completely different matter , with its own set of separate ethical problems that are nowhere near as clear cut as the matter of marriage equality is ; that as a matter of coincidence happens to affect the `` equality '' of same-sex marriages in a practical manner . 
  i just wanted to point this out in the midst of this debate , because the subtext of that phrase seems to be that by not outright opening the legal floodgates for surrogacy , such countries are being somewhat `` backwards '' . 
  no shit . 
  i 'm a pretty regular person with fairly commom deviancies , but i 'd be terrified of running for office . 
   how can we be so arrogant to presume that suddenly after thousands of years of written history as testimony of our nature well , in the last 100 years , science and technology have advanced far , far more than in the last 10k years combined . 
  i do n't think it 's an unrealistic expectation at all , and certainly not arrogant . 
  but it seems we 're not quite there yet , i 'll give you that . 
  i 'm not sure if i 'm waking to a reality i was previously blind to , but i used to see military spending as more or less a waste detracting from other sorts of social policies with much better capabilities to effect good on the world . 
  a relic of the last century of large scares , if you will . 
  with what 's been going on in the world in the last 6 months , i find my position on military spending shifting , and i 'm scared of it . 
  i 'm 100 % opposed to war , but with narcissistic maniac having all the power to be wielded from our supposed biggest ally , who as it turns out might very likely be setting russia ( led by a narcissistic , although actually intelligent , autocrat ) to raise in prominence again , i feel ... relatively defenceless ? 
  shit , this is how extremists and/or aspiring autocrats get to power ( and look at how venezuela is doing , and had been doing in the last couple of decades ) . 
  and if i 'm feeling this way , how are people who do n't try to keep themselves informed in a rigorous manner , supposed to feel ? 
  shit 's going to get dark for a few decades , i 'm afraid . 
  i did n't want to , and never expected to , live through this in my generation . 
   i do n't know why do you have urge to whitewash this . 
  [ goes on a tirade of pure speculation regarding the demographics of crime ] . 
  yeah , you 're the unbiased one here . 
  fantastic example of a slippery slope fallacy . 
  jesus h. christ , the xenophobia on this sub ( and please , forgive me that i accurately call it that , even though i 'm sure you 'll give me 5 rationalisations for why `` it 's not that '' ) has truly become the dominant voice . 
  i swear to god 3 years ago nobody would have believed me if i told then this was where we were headed . 
  please also note i 'm not judging you , but i 'm struggling to understand how , on an individual level ( i do understand how it works at the population level ) , such changes in basic values can occur in such a small amount of time . 
  oh , by all means , feel free to expound on how you believe `` we are ruining our societies '' . 
  i 'm serious , as , if anything , what history has shown us is that massive immigrations ( and this one is n't even close to being considered that ) do actually the opposite ; create some tensions on the short term , while things normalise in the long term . 
  and when many of our countries have somewhat inverted pyramid population graphs , landing us in budget-balancing issues , it becomes a ** really ** though proposition to suggest that introducing * some * ( again , not even close to being massive ) working and reproductive age refugees into our societies will be in any way long-term detrimental to our societies , let alone `` destructive '' . 
   ruining our own societies dramatisation much ? 
  these sorts of hyperbolic and ultimately emotional appeals do little bit subtract from your credibility , at least in serious debates . 
  i 'm well aware it 's in fact very effective as a political tool , landing us in this situation . 
  i find your view to very closely aligned with my own . 
  you are not wrong , and i agree ( as i 've detailed in another one of my comments ) ; and yet , what i claimed is nothing more than that . 
  what i 'm arguing against is this notion that `` it 's a coin toss '' , which is something i 'm sure you disagree with as well . 
  hold that though , i 'm about to email all world banks and economic institutions to let them know that according to `` some articles on the internet you read '' all their knowledge , their models , their predictions ( on which the world economy runs , btw ) are in essence useless . 
  i 'm sure they 'll be super interested to learn that social sciences are n't comparable to the `` real physical world sciences '' ( which are themselves based on unfalsifiable and untestable formal sciences ) . 
  it 's funny how often i 've had to debate the nature and philosophy of science , a matter i thought has been settled quite a while ago . 
  almost as if , truly , we 're living in a post-truth world . 
  so your argument against a sound economic model is ... 
  some dude 's opinion ? 
  i 'm not kidding here , nor even disrespecting mr. smith 's ( a historian by training ) opinion . 
  but it 's still an opinion . 
  when mr. smith leads or orders an economic institution to conduct an analysis on the matter ( which is what the treasury 's report is , incidentally ) , then i 'll regard his opinions as something other than that . 
  and that 's what this debate boils down to , does n't it ? 
  whether you `` believe '' the economic sciences are any more useful or rigorous than a simple opinion . 
  it would seem like an otherwise non-controversial matter , but alas , here were are . 
  hence my comparison with climate models , which turns out to be a perfect analogy , seeing the morphing of your arguments . 
  but hey !, 
  some congressman brought a snowball into the chamber in the us a few months ago !, 
   the report you link emphasises that it is an analysis and not a forecast , nobody can know the future no , no no !, 
  the correct conclusion to draw from your ( correct ) first phrase is n't the implication that it 's a coin toss , because eveb though it 's true a simulation ca n't predict the price of the gbp on january of 2045 , it can absolutely tell us what overall , ** macroeconomic ** consequences a hard brexit will have ( and the report continues on to detail it ) . 
   but its not impossible to have a prosperous economy outside of the eu . 
  and this is a straw man because i do n't believe anyone has claimed such a thing . 
  only that it 'll be in an overall worse shape than if it stays . 
   so to overrule the referendum because they ` know better ' ? 
  im not calling for that either ( altough the argument can be made that the powers that be have discretion to do this since the uk is neither a direct democracy , nor was the referendum legally binding , nor its campaign subject to the legal rigors that an election is ) . 
   but if the people want , for example , less immigration , despite all of the economic benefit they bring , then fine , let them pay that cost . 
  we agree wholeheartedly there . 
   a scientific model based on millennia of information you know economics is a scientific discipline , do you not ? 
  this quoted phrase is literally descriptive of it . 
  if you do n't want to continue `` humouring me '' that 's fine . 
  as long as you 've learned something today , and you think twice about such matters in the future , and proudly proclaiming you did n't vote because the outcome is unknowable . 
  i 'm sorry to say you wasted a vote because you did n't bother to google . 
   that largely depends on whether its leadership continues to refuse to listen to the people of europe no , not quite , not if you 're talking about economic growth . 
  there are clearly good economic decisions , and there are bad economic decisions .
