  `` listening to the people of europe '' has absolutely no correlation to whether something is a good economic decision ( the uk will find out about this in a couple of years ) ; and further than that you 're conflating matters so horrendously , that you make it hard to make a clear debate on a particular matter , and turn it into one of ideologic demagoguery . 
  again , apply all your questions to the matter of climate change , which is another well-understood system with good models to study its future . 
  if you respond that we would indeed need to be time travellers to predict what the effects of a 2\u00bac global temperature increase would be , then we have a far bigger , more fundamental misunderstanding , about the nature of these problems . 
  nevermind the fact that i provided exactly what you asked for , and you seem to not have even skimmed it . 
  why ask for data you 're not even going to check out ? 
  in your previous comment you accuse me of `` patronising you '' because i `` do n't agree with your opinion '' , and despite me providing an extremely comprehensive source for what you consider to be `` my opinion '' , you 're not even engaging , and are , in an act of almost incomprehensible irony , patronising me for literally `` not agreeing with your ( demonstrably unsourced and uninformed ) opinion on whether this matter is even modellable for the next 20-30 years '' . 
  please help me understand , because i 'm a bit lost here regarding your attitude and `` opinions '' . 
   appear to be putting words into my mouth  when i 'm quite clearly just saying that the future appears uncertain either way that is exactly what i claimed you defended , so i 'm not sure where you 're coming from ? 
  the future ** is n't ** uncertain in the event of a hard brexit , but you were ( and continue to be in this very comment ! ), 
  adamant that such a thing is more of a `` coin toss '' , by citing thae fact that both sides of the campaign claim different things , and concluding that there 's no more validity to one side over the other . 
  and this notion , it 's false . 
  there 's a whole field of economics dedicated to studying these matters , and its scholars overwhelmingly support just one side of the debate . 
  [ the uk treasury analysis of ` the long-term economic impact of eu ... ] ( http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/brexit04.pdf )  show me definitive scientific/economic proof there id n't `` definitive scientific proof '' for climate change either , fyi . 
  just the current best understanding of how the climate works , and the current models based on that data , and the scientific consensus around the validity of those models . 
  this is the equivalent for the british economy . 
  this document is n't even hard to find either , but i see you had n't even looked for it , before deciding `` such information does n't exist '' . 
  so i find it terrible shame , and very telling , that you 'd defend such matters so forcefully without so much as doing a cursory google search . 
  this is quite dumb , too , i 'm afraid . 
  pretending country-wide macroeconomics is n't a pretty well underdtood field , is a bit like climate denialism . 
  would you claim `` we ca n't really know about the climate until its changes are far more dramatic '' ? 
  exactly . 
  anyone arguing `` look , economically things have n't gone to shit , clearly the brexit apocalyptic predictions were a lie ! '', 
  are damned fools . 
  it 's impossible for them to find out until it 's too late . 
   they 've said about maintaining and greater control of borders , sure . 
  whether you agree with it or not , it 's a legitimate point as the future could hold anything ( not against race , but against any threat ) as the population increases . 
  i 'm sorry but the whole immigration thing is absolutely a racist thing , hard as it may be too hear to people who do n't see themselves as racist . 
  the data on either economic matters or even criminality does n't support a rational case for `` harsher immigration control '' . 
  but hey , perhaps i 'm being close-minded . 
  give me a non-racist argument for immigration control , and we can take it from there . 
   but that implies that every person who is a brexiter is a single minded person , with all the same rhetoric that is n't the only necessary explanation . 
  but it 's similar to the situation with the trump voters : not everyone who voted for trump is a racist . 
  but for ** no-one ** of those who voted for him , was the idea of institutionalised racism and fundamentally racist rhetoric a deal breaker . 
  [ nah , they 'll just be getting level ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/percentage-of-obese-population-by-country-in-europe-map/ ), 
  also true . 
  it 's mainly the ideologues and anarchists going `` we pay more to the mainland than we get back '' . 
  ... which is true , but in reality every person with half a brain recognises that the difference between them and a less-favourable ( for tourism ) country like , say , malta , is the fact that they 're a part of a major , industrially-developed country to lend them a sort of legitimacy . 
  make sense ? 
  your impression is correct . 
  i mistook your original , extremely short , comment . 
  oh , cool , so hydrogen into slightly heavier hydrogen . 
   reactor is 500mw  and has to dissipate 10 seconds of energy no , but that 's the thing with fusion . 
  without the strict containment of the field , the fusion reaction would stop instantly , with that 1g of matter being able to `` affect '' its surroundings with the amount of energy that it contains at that very moment . 
  so i think giving the calculation 10 seconds of fusion reactor energy is overestimating the contained energy by orders of magnitude . 
  i 'm also unsure of the matter that 's being fusioned together ( presumably hydrogen into helium ? 
  ) , [ let me give it a go at tweaking your formula  ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=20+degrees+c+%2b+ ( ( specific + heat + of + helium + * +1 g ) % 2b +15000000 + degrees + c ) + + % 2f + ( ( specific + heat + of + water ) + * + ( 50m + * +25 m + * +2 m ) + * + ( water + density ) ) ) yeah , i suck at physics , but you get the idea of what i was trying to figure out . 
  edit : how on earth do you link to urls that contain parentheses ? 
  not when the amount of matter is that small , distributed along such a large space , and that was his whole point . 
  i 'm too incompetent to perform the calculations , but i 'm sure someone could illustrate what that 1g of plasma at 150 million degrees would do in the outside world . 
  if unleashed in a swimming pool for instance , how much hotter would it end up making the water ? 
  this is terribly interesting to me . 
  i would have thought this was n't possible , but then again i 'm in another profession that used to enforce very formal wear ( medicine ) , and nowadays there 's no dress code either . 
   soft power , public support , and information , then i do n't see any problem with that yet that 's not all you 're suggesting , is it , given that you seem to support at least keeping the talks open ? 
   we 're talking about promoting goodness in humanity here , not sending troops to fight a civil war . 
  we 've been confronted with this slippery slope before . 
  if we 're `` nurturing '' ( or however you want to call it ) the liberal factions within turkey , and one day their government decides to brutally subdue , say , a protest , the kind of people who argue for the things you argue then will tend to argue for the need , nay , ** responsibility ** to ( militarily ) intervene , and protect those people . 
  and it would n't be an insane argument given that , indeed , by `` nurturing '' them in some partial manner we will have been morally responsible for them to have gotten in that mess in the first place . 
  you seem to be thoroughly convinced of the need not to intervene in third-world countries , so i 'll actually throw the question back to you : what exactly about turkey being geographically closer to us gives us the moral justification to seek to meddle in their internal affairs any more than in a third world country ? 
  after all , should n't your arguments ** for ** interventionism apply even more so in such countries ? 
   it needs to be nurtured rather than pushed away . 
  treating countries like children does n't strike me as a good idea . 
  actually it kind of sounds like a preliminary justification for paternalistic military/economic/legislative interventionism . 
  europe is supposed to be a common project for like-minded people ( to an extent ) . 
  assimilation was never a founding goal , and in not sure it would be an ethical one either . 
  if they want to join , the onus should be on them to show that they share the kinds of values with the rest of the members to belong . 
  perfect situational awareness !, 
  try going to the hospital , get diagnosed with bacilliferous tb , and then proclaim you want to be discharged . 
  they will strap you to the bed if needed until you are trated and no longer contagious . 
  there are limits to body autonomy , and those limits lie precisely at the intersection with public health . 
  we just do n't experience those limits on a daily basis , so we infer that surely body autonomy must trump everything else . 
  that is a mistaken belief . 
  bioethics is very clear that matters of public health trump by far the right for body autonomy . 
  so just like they will quarantine you if they diagnose you with bacilliferous tuberculosis , even against your will , vaccines are compulsory in some places due to the overwhelming evidence that they \u00f1rovide such benefits in matter of herd immunity . 
  the fact that they 're so consistently proven to have such ridiculously low rates of serious side effects is but the icing that makes this whole debate such a no brainer for bioethicists . 
  also , parents do n't have full rights to the body autonomy of their sons . 
  they ca n't subject them to non-reconstructive plastic surgery . 
  in most sane places they ca n't circumcise them . 
  thry ca n't in fact subject them to any medical procedure that is n't an emergency , or would hamper their normal psychological or physical development if left untreated , until they can at least partially consent . 
  oh , for sure , great day regardless !, 
  i do n't think gp meant it that merkel was infallible and incapable of makingnmistakes , but rather that she 's a notorious and cunning political animal , so this seemingly haphazard comment in an unrelated interview for a magazine , which ended up resulting in the opposition 's campaigning power being greatly diminished just before the campaign , probably was n't exactly an accident . 
  particularly when she avoided a shitstorm with her own party in the process . 
  i mean , this was long , long overdue for a western european country , but it 's a shame all these ultimately non-controversial issues end up becoming political bargaining chips . 
  junior employees are hired locally regardless . 
  i actually meant the opposite ... that they * would * be fine almost anywhere . 
  barring spain , portugal , and italy , there probably are n't many european countries where you could just drop-in anglo-speaking executives/workers in major cities and have them be able to function perfectly fine . 
  except for more formal settings i already do n't really use the legacy phone sustem anymore . 
  regardless , we 're talking of the advantages of getting cheaper data . 
  my phone has a dual sim slot , and freedompop has free basic call service ( or i 'm sure i could setup something far more elegant with a local sip number provider for pennies ) . 
  i know ; but should this new legislation not change this ? 
  the `` anticriminal '' bit has been used in numerous countries without any concrete proof that it does anything . 
  it 's an excuse , the same as all other privacy-squashing legislation . 
  please do n't throw your support it behind it so blindly ; i understand terrorism is scary , but this is n't the way to prevent it . 
  what happens with the prepaid data sims they sell at airports and such without id ? 
  it 's a shame because it will require a lawsuit , but they 're setting themselves up for massive fines . 
  is there any way to know if while visiting dk the rest of us will have our agreements honoured ? 
  tbf , since this rule will have applied before brexit , i hope it will remain in place . 
  if not by law , by the horrible publicity that it would land the first company to roll it back . 
  the ban starts flr the day before , so the reasoning i think is more about people bein hung over and lazy to go vote . 
   the latter disadvantage applies just as well to the more gifted children . 
  you 're absolutely right ; and this phenomenon has been studied at lenght .
