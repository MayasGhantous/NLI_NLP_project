  fortunately , smarter children also have more psychological and emotional resources to deal with that . 
  and to my knowledge , save from ( and with very mixed results at that ) bumping the kids up a few years in school ( and that brings its own set of psychological issues ; ones which are not clear at all that are better than the ones they replaced ) , there 's not a lot special programs can do about that . 
   if they have problems , they 're worth trying to find solutions for . 
  hey , i 'm all for that . 
  different countries have instituted very different such programs , and to my knowledge none have gotten impressive results at all . 
  but i think you are having trouble understanding the reasoning behind needing evidence . 
  when you 're in charge of spending money to make the most out of it , you do n't just give it to the guy promising his system will make kids smarter . 
  you ask him for proof . 
  it 's as simple as that . 
  research is not banned from this perspective ( and it is n't in reality ) ; plenty of pilot programs have and continue to be made to research on the matter . 
  i myself find the premise a little idealistic ( that special programs would make gifted kids into adult geniuses and hyperachievers , when the evidence from developmental psychology points to most gifted children being simply cognitively mature for their age , rather than true geniuses that 'll continue to be so into adulthood ) , but i 'm not one to argue against evidence if shown to me . 
   you compare absolute achievement with a certain minimum , i compare unrealized potential achievement . 
  as i already argued to death in the other comment tree , this is something that needs to be proven ( starting with a method to measure `` unrealised potential '' ) before we are to start throwing money at it . 
  that is all that i 'm saying . 
  show me the evidence that these programs work , and i 'll concede a great deal of your points . 
  but you are stubborn to provide this evidence , which is worrying . 
  either you ** do n't ** know whether evidence on the matter exists ( which should make you wonder why you 're so adamantly supporting these measures ) , or you outright know that these programs do n't work , which makes me severely question what your motivations behind this are . 
   up to which level , and how much support do they still need afterwards ? 
   also keep in mind that i just disagree with the notion that `` i consider it more important to reach the less talented kids than the really bright ones '' . 
  ideally , everyone gets what he needs of course . 
  no ; you quite clearly said `` it 's a waste of effort '' , when quite clearly , it objectively is not . 
   we 'll use the same criterium you use to identify the challenged ones , just the opposite end of the bell curve . 
  fine . 
  iq it is . 
  but while for the lower percentiles the risk is clear , and the special programs ' help evident , for the upper percentiles this is not the case at all . 
   however you want to define top potential , if someone out of that group does n't realize his potential it 's a bigger loss than when someone of low potential does n't . 
  so now you 're to switch it to `` potential '' ? 
  as i said numerous times before ( and you have n't bothered to address ) : even if i agreed with this notion ( and i certainly do n't ; i think it 's a far bigger tragedy to have people preventably live worse-off lives than it is to have people live good-enough lives but that `` could have been better '' ) , special programs for the gifted ** have n't shown ** ( to my knowledge ) that they can truly help these children `` reach their full potential '' , whatever the hell that might mean . 
  put it another way : unless you show me otherwise , why should we invest money on something we 're not even sure that works ? 
   depression , demotivation and lack of proper study habits are certainly not exclusively caused by psychiatric illness . 
  depression ** is ** a psychiatric illness , motivation is only within the reach of the person involved ( if you do n't believe me , ask any psychiatrist working with drug addiction ) , and discipline is n't something one majoritarily gets from school anyways . 
   absence of evidence is not evidence of absence . 
  this could just as well signal a lack of interest in the matter . 
  this better be a joke : if you want to justify investing public money in it , you damn well should ** show ** that it works beforehand . 
  otherwise , i have this perfectly nice bridge for sale over here ... 
  besides : the matter has very much been studied . 
  `` evidence of absence '' , scientifically speaking , is not attainable . 
  much like we ca n't prove god does not exist . 
  but when you look for something and do n't find it , well ...  however , you ignore that the same effort would do just as much to improve the achievement of someone else , and that the return on investment will be higher because these people can do more than an average person . 
  prove this , and i 'll be completely in agreement with you . 
  it 's not that i despise gifted children or anything , mind you ( what with me having been one and all that . . ) . 
  i just think it ridiculous that people would demand programs that have n't shown to be good for much other than give the parents of said kids topics to try and make their friends envious about . 
   we have limited means to spend on these issues , and instead of focusing everything to try to bring the lower end of the bell curve up to average , i think it 's more beneficial to society as a whole to invest some of this support in the higher end of the bell curve . 
  well , that 's your opinion . 
  one i disagree with , but respectable nonetheless . 
  but i 'll tell you why i disagree : think of it in terms of money : would you think it more valuable to society to invest in letting some people achieve `` millionaire '' status , or to get absolutely everyone out of poverty ? 
  as you yourself said , resources are definitely limited . 
  i 'm nowhere near against investing in gifted children ( provided it 's a program that 's proven not only to work , but also that it wo n't have any unintended consequences ) , as long as we 've already achieved the goal of helping every and all children with special needs . 
  the smart kids will do ok without the help . 
  education / = special education . 
  i did n't say it does n't matter at all . 
  but discipline , out of all things , is n't something that 's primarily learnt in school . 
  suggesting kids with ** more ** intellectual resources would end up worse off than normal kids without special help ... now that 's quite the claim . 
  and it 's the kind of claim you need to elaborate on with more than your perceptions . 
   i 'm sorry to break the news to you . 
  except what you said is not a fact , but rather an opinion . 
  and an opinion directly contradicted by the available evidence , at that . 
  special programs have definitely shown that they can drastically improve the functionality of challenged children . 
   i used the expression of the comment i responded to to indicate the people with the most intellectual talent . 
  when you appropriate a term you have to be responsible for it . 
  how would ** you ** identify these children , then ? 
  please say it 's not iq , because by now it 's painfully obvious that iq does n't correlate very well ( or linearly at all ) with overall success in life , happiness , or some measured form of contribution to society , real or perceived . 
  everyone has problems , the loss to society is just higher when it happens to their top potential . 
  a ) [ citation needed ] ( as i said , iq is not a predictor of future contribution to society ) , and b ) you were advocating for special ** education ** programs , not psychiatric prophylactic ones . 
  make up your mind ( or stop arguing for the sake of argument , whatever your reason for being so inconsistent is ) . 
   in addition , the high potential people are just as much out of sync with the rest of society as the low potential people . 
  again , i think this will need a citation . 
  i do n't believe it 's true at all . 
   you could justify giving them the same attention , but giving them less is just spiteful . 
  it 's not when , to my knowledge ( and again , please correct me if i 'm wrong ; while i 've done some research on the matter it 's definitely not my field ) , there is n't a lot of evidence that investing in special education for the top percentiles of iq results in any kind of measurable benefits for society ( and perhaps not even to the individuals ) . 
   so can less gifted ones . 
  no , less gifted ones are definitely , and statistically measurably worse off without special help . 
   in the first case society loses more though . 
  here i am requesting sources again . 
  and i said that where , exactly ? 
  please do n't make a habit of debating using straw man arguments ; it 's deeply dishonest . 
  hey , i hear you . 
  my experience is almost identical to what you described . 
  a switch to medical school was definitely a shock to my previous modus vivendi . 
  but you know what ? 
  eventually , i adapted , and i succeeded , as i assume you 've done as well . 
  perhaps others have not . 
  my only discrepancy with your story is that i saw the rest of university students struggling equally than me . 
  some of them got better grades , but then again that is not equal to not struggling , since i consider spending 8 hours a day ( not even during exams time ) , if not a struggle , at the very least not a great life . 
  and not one i wanted for me , at any rate . 
  in a philosophical sense , maybe it makes sense to want to make kids never let their guards down to acquire study habits that 'll prevent them from failing in university . 
  however , i think that 's perfectly possible within the frame of the normal schooling system . 
  i do blame my parents ( in a matter-of-fact way , not like i resent them or anything ) for not forcing me to acquire good study habits , needless as they might have been during my school years . 
  but in the end it 's all good . 
  everyone struggles in life , and that part of mine was my personal struggle at least up to this point . 
  i wonder if attempting to rid kids of every conceivable roadbump along the way might leave them horribly unprepared for when things in life ( as they sometimes do ) go horribly wrong . 
   i just meant that 90 % of school time was spent on not learning anything . 
  except for the aforementioned social and life skills , which is no small feat . 
   it does n't have to be that way . 
  many remarkable people have started at a young age . 
  terence tao was doing university maths by age nine . 
  and i 'd do obscene things to be permitted to be terence tao 's psychoanalyst . 
  my hypothesis is that , at 9 years of age , spending a huge amount of time doing what highly educated young adults are usually paid for ( while not even getting the pay or even the `` appropriate '' peer recognition an adult would ) , while probably awesome for building a curriculum for later life ( and i do mean decades later ) , may be not such a great thing for the development of a child 's psyche . 
  to put it another way : just because kids ** can ** be put to work in assembly lines in factories ( as they once were , in fact ) , does n't mean they should . 
  as much as the child ( who has not even close to a complete [ or much at all ] superego , ie : whose value systems are heavily reliant on their primary caretakers ) seems to `` enjoy '' it .
