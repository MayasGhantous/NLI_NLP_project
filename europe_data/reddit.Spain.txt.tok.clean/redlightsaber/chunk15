  but hey , i do hope the guy is genuinely happy and that i 'm wrong on some level . 
   i agree , and it 's important to design schools to accommodate both this and the different intellectual needs of different children . 
  i believe it can and should be done !, 
  perhaps . 
   but i know many who really did n't learn what everyone is learning  they 'd learnt it before , or very quickly see the contradiction here ? 
  at least if i understood what you were trying to say correctly . 
  it 's not like because of boredom these kids are not actually learning the material and getting behind even `` normal '' kids . 
  i wo n't deny there 's a potential for boredom in schools . 
  what i do think is being overemphasised is what being smart has to do with it . 
  some things in school are very boring . 
  and even intellectually superior kids do n't find everything interesting . 
  bullying should be addressed no doubt . 
  but that 's not an exact correlation with being smarter either . 
   also , i do n't really see why it 's ok to waste intellectual potential like this woah there , this is what i meant in my previous comment , and the questions i posed remain unanswered . 
   do we really want to waste human potential in the things that really matter ? 
  but what exactly is being wasted ? 
  anything even remotely useful for society ( perhaps with the exception of music , indeed ) is learnt much , much later in life , at the university level . 
  i 'd like to think musically talented and inclined children would be captured by the school 's ** regular ** music program . 
  but otherwise , and that was my main point , school , aside from having a very important role in giving the population a lowest-common-denominator education , is also the place where children learn equally important social and life skills . 
  my impression is that segregation would have an overall far more negative impact in this regard than the ( big-picture ) relatively-unimportant achievement of teaching an 11 year-old to do engineering entry-level calculus . 
  which would achieve , what , exactly ? 
  save him a few months or years when university time came ? 
  this was , btw what i always perceived ( even at my age then ) as the underlying drama in the series `` douguie houser , md '' . 
  the poor bastard was having to deal with adult responsibilities while his peers were probably discovering * life * . 
  and he did n't even belong in that world either . 
  and for what ? 
  a few people being in awe of his abilities ? 
  good points , i think i agree with most of them . 
  or perhaps they would have been so regardless ? 
   but it 's a waste of effort to try to bring the borderline mentally handicapped up to par with the average . 
  well , that 's quite the disconcerting opinion . 
   they are going to be limited in their choices anyway holy shit . 
  no really . 
   potential phd 's from becoming depressed , suicidal or disillusioned with society a ) phds , aside from having a ( not as high as you might think ) baseline intellectual barrier to entry , have not much to do with intelligence , and b ) am i to understand that you claim the reason intelligence is somewhat correlated with certain mental illnesses is because of a lack of proper programs ? 
  that 's going to need a source , please , because al the silly researchers right now are focusing on genetic factors , something to do with dominant traits in one group being recessive in other or other some such thing . 
  am i alone in the opinion ( perhaps completely biased and based on anecdotal evidence ) , that gifted kids can have a perfectly normal and happy childhood and school experience in a normal schooling system ? 
  and producing perfectly happy and high-achieving and successful adults ? 
  here 's a very tricky , and potentially very politically incorrect question : is there any evidence whatsoever that programs for `` gifted children '' ( of any kind ) actually result in smarter/more gifted/more successful/happier/whatever adults ? 
  i may be biased because of my personal history , but i do n't see anything wrong with letting kids just be kids , have a good time with their peers , learn what everyone is learning , and not worry too much about the fucking future . 
  they 'll be doing that the rest of their lives . 
  and gifted kids who also have big curiosities will find the resources ( it 's not like information is n't easily available , it was n't even back in my day before the internet ) . 
  i sometimes feel like people who complain about these things are assuming a lot of things at best , and at worst think of those kids as a resource that needs to be exploited . 
  i , too , believe reaching less talented kids is vastly more important , integrative , and conducting to happier/more successful adults than catering to special kids would be . 
  are you serious ? 
  no wonder you do n't even see this as a big issue ( or see most people here as racist assholes ) . 
  you do n't even understand the problem . 
  i do n't have a plan . 
  either of those 2 options seems to not end well ( yes , even `` de-escalation '' , while allowing them to live their lives as if nothing 's happened within the welfare system , is reinforcing the notion that they do n't need education [ and why should they want to get it ? ] ) . 
  i do n't know what i 'd do if i were in charge of tackling the issue . 
  and this is coming from someone who does n't dislike gypsies ( in my country , by and far they 're rather nice if you treat them well , but they 're still very much unintegrated and a social problem ) , and works with them on an almost daily basis ( mental health ) . 
  no , according to ( most of ) them . 
  that 's the actual reason none of the integration efforts have worked ( the sane ones at least ) . 
  that 's great , except for the little detail that they see their children going to school ( education ) as an agression . 
  being realistic , it 's something all countries using the euro should have had from the beginning . 
  with all of us tied up by this single currency , the effects of a badly-managed country ( economically ) will be felt by all of us . 
  as we 're seeing right now in the form of the euro crisis . 
  the faith in one 's family includes the belief that they ** will ** do what 's best for you , which does n't have to be exclusive with being in the best interest of the family overall , mind you . 
  i think pluis put it very elloquently when he said us westerners have a very hard time comprehending the depths of such concepts . 
  this is one instance of it , i think . 
  and to add the obligatory anecdotal evidence , i 've met a few people who were married by arrangement , and who seemed about as happy as any other couple i know . 
  i know so my answer was n't necessarily directed at you . 
  of course what people in the real world get away with is different from what would be logical ; i 'm merely pointimg out , since we 're discussing ideologies here , why taking these sorts of stances is justified . 
  it 's european values that allow for such conditions to exist . 
  if they want that , they need to get with the program . 
  they should n't come here taking advantage of what we 've built , and bringing with them the kind of behaviours that would tear all of it down . 
  agreed with all of it . 
  but then ( referring to your last point ) , some people would make the point that if it 's too hard to leave behind a culture of opression , perhaps it 's just not possible or practical to reach a true integration ( and by that i do n't necessarily mean that they should lose their roots or religion ) , and that that would be an argument for further restricting immigration from these countries . 
  at the very least i do believe in the countries where this is a bigger issue ( as you said , france , for instance ) it should n't be off-limits , nor necessarily racist ( although some of the reasons behind their supporters undoubtedly are ) for measures to be taken to cut into these oppresive practises . 
  how they should be executed , however , is a difficult matter that i do n't have the answer to , in order to reach a good balance between tolerance for culture and religion , and intolerance for things that go against `` western values '' ( ie : human rights violations ) . 
  i know , most muslims do n't yell for a stoning at the sight of female hair , but they do deem it incorrect ( while ironically not thinking the same of men who violate the `` muslim dress code '' ) . 
  500 years ago not many cultures were even remotely similar to what we are today ; but 50 years ago in the majority of countries that today * force * ( either by active repression or by socially-intilled one [ indoctrination ] ) women to wear burqas and niqabs , did n't use to do so at all ; and the relatively few women who did did so arguably for true religious devotion . 
  i do understand that the governments use religion as an excuse to opress people ; but leaving aside the fact that the islamic revolution had for the most part the support of the people , it 's undeniably true that muslims who immigrate to western countries ( and who are therefore not compelled by law to continue to be repressed anymore ) still force their women to wear burqas ( niqabs are admiteddly rarer , but the do happen as well ) . 
  i 've personally never met a muslim who wore a burqa at home but took it off when they arrived at their new country . 
  i * have * met `` progressive '' muslims ( who do n't force their women to wear burqas and all that ) , but they behaved the same way back home , and they certainly were for the most part divorced from their religion , in a very similar way us westerners are divorced from ours ( even amongst those who consider themselves religious ) . 
   i think if someone does n't want to hire someone on the basis of their ethnicity then that is a discriminatory act , it is racist , there is n't really a lot left to discuss is there ? 
  of course , but i was n't talking about not hiring muslims in that sentence . 
  i meant ztiller 's comment 's general tone of dissaproval towards any discussion on the matter . 
  you have great points , most of which i agree with . 
  i hear you . 
  but some of the concerns are legitimate , i think . 
  and in your very post there a couple of unfair comparisons . 
   people say that islam advocates executions etc. 
  so does the bible etc. 
  yet there are n't very many executions done in western countries for those reasons , are they ? 
  the different religions can be interpreted , and it 's true that there are * some * `` flavours '' of islam that are relatively progressive and would n't pose much trouble for a western society . 
  i do n't think executions are the big complaint however , but rather the misoginy . 
  this is not `` isolated groups '' of islam which treat women like objects that we 're talking about here . 
  we 're talking , virtually everyone who has n't outright for the most part divorced islam , does n't think it right for a woman to go out alone in public . 
  or without a burqa ( or niquab ) , or to date . 
  or drive . 
  i 'd love to be proven wrong on this bit , please do if you have available info . 
   some muslims come here , and shout that they want sharia law . 
  in the end , they will never get it . 
   we have neo-nazis walking around propagating for a new holocaust etc. 
  yet their race/beliefs is never brought up . 
  for the most part , i agree with this . 
  but it does n't mean the discourse should n't be had . 
  the uk iirc , was considering ( or did they actually implement it ? ), 
  some sort of paralell court system based on sharia law ? 
  so it 's not as simple as just saying `` they 'll never get it '' , it is a very real possibility in some places , and probably rightfully so ; after all , the government is there to serve the people , and if a large enough portion of the people want something , they ought to get it .
