  it 's not about `` driving points home '' , it 's about dealing with consequences for your own actions . 
  if you do n't want people from the union entering your country without fuss , you ca n't expect to have your own people go onto the union without a fuss . 
  it 's about as simple as it gets . 
  it 's no doubt a sad state of affairs for students , but if the swiss as a whole care about their students surely they 'll correct that primitive law , and reap the benefits of living in a modern , first-world country , with open borders . 
   i 'm quite sure that punishment is by definition a ( negative ) consequence of an action . 
  it is a rather unimportant distinction . 
  what it boils down to is that the swiss people voted against opening their borders to ( a small part of ) europeans . 
  and now the border closing if being effected in the opposite direction ( in the form of an indirect closing of the erasmus program ) . 
  i can completely understand why the swiss would vote for such a law , but i would not understand is a generalised outrage over the consequences . 
  it 's very likely that this measure was prematurely effected as a symbolic punishment , but it would have come sooner or later ( without the retaliatory intent ) anyways . 
  i frankly for one believe that it being done in this way has the best chance of showing the swiss populace of what exactly they voted for , and to understand on a deeper level that to reap to benefits of an open borders policy , one has to actually have open borders . 
  otherwise it would just be mooching . 
  i think it 's overall a sad thing because at least in a great proportion what motivated most people to vote for this law was sheer xenophobia . 
    last thursday , the national union of students in switzerland ( vss ) and the european students union sounded a warning about the potential impact of the swiss immigration vote on the erasmus programme . 
  perhaps this move will help these students make their voices heard amongst their own people ? 
   the are only effective actions and ineffective actions . 
  so how come , might i ask , that you consider one kind to be more effective than the other ? 
  considering of course that what 's going in catalu\u00f1a has been going on for decades and never has it come to fruition , and that the occupy movement has achieved equally as little ? 
  what i 'm getting at is that regardless of the adjectives we use ( valid , good , effective ) , you clearly think one form of protest is more [ whathaveyou ] than the other ( the kind that i happen to consider less desirable in the sense that it 's anchored in the more primitive and societally-regressive attitudes like xenophobia ) , when aside from these moral implications , both have been equally unsuccesful in achieving their goals ? 
   and yes , i consider the occupy protests glorified street theater . 
  explain to me why , then , in your mind , these nationalistic demonstrations are any more valid or `` legitimate '' than the occupy protests ? 
   while revolt is non-optimum , it is far easier than reform . 
  we can not allow the perfect be the enemy of the good . 
  i believe the current practice of economics is wrong in advocating the opposite i do n't know how you measure `` good '' versus `` bad '' , but while i get your point , i think it 's equivocal . 
  revolt might be a * faster * way of changing things , but it 's not easier , nor without consequences . 
  and those consequences in this instance would be measured in far poorer economic outputs for all parties involved . 
  i do n't know if you know quite how bad the situation is in spain , but `` poorer outcomes '' would actually quite literally mean `` higher poverty rates '' . 
   lacking in this tribalism , the frustration would be more diffused and confused , similar to the occupy-like protests we have seen . 
  i do n't quite understand if this is a critique of the occupy-like protests ( which have been the most the american populace have involved themselves in politics in quite a few decades ) , or an endorsement of the tribalistic-bordering-on-outright-xenophobia nationalism that is going on in certain places of spain , and elsewhere in the world , but either way i think it 's the wrong approach . 
  when it comes down to it , these protests are a ) tribalistic in nature ( not good in any light from where i 'm standing ) , and b ) if they achieved their goal there 'd be economic suffering for everyone ** very much in contrast with the fantasy that drives these protests ** ( that they 'll do much better if they split off ) . 
  this is ** not ** a calculated sacrifice , like , say , when the majority of spaniards elected the current government because he had adequately ( from pr pov ) sold that he 'd put in place austerity measures that would make things worse for a while with the promise of a better future . 
  `` venting frustrations in a more focused way '' is well and all , but then again , when a neighbourhood gathers to torture and ultimately burn someone who raped a girl , it 's also a focused way to vent a frustration . 
  it 's just not one that is very adequate , from any pov , imo . 
  except for the fact that economists ( damn am i going to be vague on my sources here , but i 'm talking from having read articles here and there a couple of years ago , the last time this issue came up in a big way ) largely agree that in a crisis such as this one , an independisation , far from solving anything , would likely make the road to recovery longer and harder for all parties involved . 
  but all of that is irrelevant ; the vast majority of the population ( and those who 'll be voting ) are neither economists nor in a particularly knowledgeable position to assess the causes and possible solutions for this crisis . 
  certainly not those who 'll angrily hiss at you upon discovering you do n't speak catalan on the street . 
  you might be right in your assessment ( and i wo n't pretend i have any more insight to offer on the matter than you , or anything i 've read ) , but make no mistake about it ; this is n't at allabout finding reasonable or even rational solutions to a well-defined problem . 
  this is tribalism at its core . 
  to people downvoting me : i 'm sorry you disagree , but the conversation would be far more enriching if you voiced your opinions and views instead . 
  also , i 'm not necessarily pro-spain or anti-independence , but that 's far off from universally and mindlessly agreeing with , and refusing to critically analise what 's going on in my society . 
  because in times of hardship , our tribalistic origins start to show , and we generally like to maintain the illusion that our problems are n't really our fault ( because there always needs to be someone at fault , right ? 
  ) , that we could all be so much better if we were n't forced to commune with these `` others '' , that are n't quite really `` us '' . 
  it 's a very interesting phebnomenon , and it 's the biggest reason behind things like the rise of nazism in post wwi germany , etc. 
  there 's a guy , a psychoanalyst called vamik volkan , who 's dedicated himself to studying these sorts of phenomenons , and has worked using this knowledge to help resolve international conflicts . 
  he 's been a nobel peace price nominee because of this . 
  worth a look into his works if you 're interested in these sorts of things . 
   portugal often subtitles their films and programmes whereas spain dubs them . 
  this is more a symptom than the cause imo . 
  but yeah , the english level here is pretty dismal . 
  i 'm not disagreeing . 
   but even if that 's the case i still feel the spanish way would be preferable to the american way . 
  oh , i do n't disagree . 
  i certainly think it 's the lesser of 2 evils . 
  but that does n't mean we need to stop looking for better solutions !, 
  i do n't know about the societal measures , but i 'll tell you the guy ( or anyone , really ) has ever had to go hungry , and providing he behaves like half a human being ( not hitting other users ; abstinence is n't even necessary ) , he 'd always have a place to stay ( at the very minimum the municipal shelter ) . 
  for his addiction what works is the medical treatment , and he 's certainly getting that . 
  the one thing studies show regarding treatments and addiction is that all the treatments in the world wo n't be successful if the patient is n't willing to change . 
  as i said , for this guy the addiction is almost secondary . 
  he does n't want to stop consuming or get better to be able to find a job and reinsert himself in `` normal society '' . 
  he 's been sober for months at a time ( with methadone i mean ) , but he 's never reached for it . 
  he does n't aspire for anything else than having a paycheque to blow on , well , blow ( and heroin ) , and not having to work for it . 
  and he believes he 's owed as much . 
  it is representative of a dire situation that is going on in the us , absolutely . 
  you 're making my point for me . 
  people at the fringes of society often show exaggerated dysfuntional traits of the society they 're a part of , as in the case i exposed . 
  i even explained this . 
  your inability or unwillingness to understand this does nothing to detract from the point . 
  i 'm not the first person , nor will i be the last , to decry the perhaps unavoidable , but definitely negative consequences of an overly lax wellfare system . 
  whether the laxitude occurs at the law level or in practice is up for debate , but it is undeniable . 
  as a fellow world citizen who 's also living in spain i have to agree . 
  the culture here is one of such entitlement that sometimes i ca n't help but being extremely cynic about it . 
  perhaps it has to do with my job ( i often work with people at the fringes of society ) , but say , just the other day a heroin addict who has n't worked a day for about 2 decades came to me complaining that `` the state would n't give him anything , so how could he hope to get better if nobody was willing to help him ? '', 
  ( in reality he had received tons of help numerous times , even to the point of being given a flat and some money to live on on the condition he stayed clean , but he 's burned all those options ) . 
  i realise his case is perhaps a bit extreme ( and he has numerous issues aside from the addiction ) , but it serves to illustrate how for some people even the notion of having to work to live is almost outrageous , expecting instead that the state should take care of them because they 're not given what they feel they 're owed by right ( an awesome life , an awesome job , an awesome house ) . 
  now , i do n't think the solution would be to swing in the completely opposite direction , but surely there 's a happy middle ground . 
  what losses ? 
  surely on a mass scale it evens out . 
  can we see your sources as well ? 
  what exactly is it that you 're trying to prove here ? 
  we 're talking about homicide here ... 
  i think he might have meant `` pure '' , unadulterated capitalism . 
  that in which the government does n't provide many or at all equalising services and programs ( education , healthcare , social security ) , that in which the private sector is n't regulated much or at all . 
  that in which taxes are n't collected proportionally to wealth ( and pragmatically at times , it goes the other way around ) . 
  such a system inequivocally promotes the concentration of wealth , and ensures self-reinforcing structures that stand in the way of people moving across social strata . 
  think the level of inequality in the us vs your average european country . 
  the former is much closer to the `` pure '' capitalism end of the spectrum . 
  they have skillsets you do n't . 
  mainly being very proficient ( natively so , in fact ) in their language and culture . 
  if you resent these companies hiring those people so , go and acquire those skills . 
  i 'm pretty damned sure such a hotel would very much rather hire a local ( who adequately knew the language and culture ) which would be vastly cheaper for them . 
  i get what you 're saying , and i empathise , i really do ... but honestly , some attitudes ( mainly those of entitlement ) just irk me a bit . 
  and i mean this in the least possible offensive way ; i see plenty of this in my own country ( spain ) , and i just wish i could make all these people see these matters from my pov ( which i think in this regard is a bit more objective ) . 
  i understand where you 're coming from , but if we were going by absolutely literal equality , then it stands to reason the age of retirement for women ( who live longer ) should be raised as well . 
  but alas , we 're not and this is nonsensical , so perhaps a little bit of specific inequality for an overall better equality is a fair price to pay , imo . 
  omg this is glorious !, 
   in my life which is why i asked for evidence . 
  confirmation bias has a terrible convincing power , like that . 
   what is wrong with the members of one country wanting to keep it the way they like it ? 
  do n't change the topic of the discussion . 
  we are not discussing whether a country has a right to choose for themselves ( which of course i agree they should ) : we were discussing the reality and rationality ( or lack thereof , more exactly ) behind the `` fears '' of immigration , and their connections with tribal mentality , and ultimately , racism .
