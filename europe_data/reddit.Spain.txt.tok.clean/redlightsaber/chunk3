  and in that context , to answer your question , there 's plenty that is morally wrong with the current anti-immigration resurgence in the last few months all over europe . 
  my argument is precisely that it 's wrong because it 's ultimately based on prejudice , racism , and tribalistic mentality . 
  even disregarding the ethical aspect of it , it 's wrong because we should never seek to set public policy based on irrational arguments . 
  oh , ok ; but i did n't ask for examples of that as it is evidently clear from everything that has to do with human beings , that nothing ever happens 100 % of the time . 
  it still holds true generally , though , and that 's what matters . 
  so single instances of violence are proof of `` cultural degradation '' ? 
  i 'm genuinely not following . 
  shit , are we seriously going down ** this ** route again ? 
  i do know how to google , and i 've found quite the opposite ( from serious academic sources , i mean ) . 
  is science really what will guide your opinions ? 
  because if so , i can definitely attempt and educate you with real sources . 
  i have a feeling this is not the case , and you use `` science '' ( or what you think it is ) as an argument only when it confirms your beliefs . 
  except this is a false fear , if this is actually your argument . 
  immigrants of course have to follow the laws of the host country , and the host country has more than enough resources to enforce them . 
  i will not deny that certain cultures are more difficult to integrate into the host one , but that 's a temporary issue , as it has been proven time and time again that as soon as in the next generation , their mentality is that of the host country , much to the chagrin of the original immigrants ' generation . 
  and even in the `` adjustment period '' , the only people that are affected by their non-immediate integration is themselves . 
  if you think i 'm wrong , i 'm willing to be educated , i 'm nothing if not open minded , i think . 
  show me instances where these sorts of things lead to `` cultural degradation '' or whatever the fear-du-jour is . 
  but do take into account , that , as my flair flag shows , i 'm in one of the eu countries that experiences more constant immigration . 
  it 's terribly amusing to me that northern countries are suddenly so worried about immigration . 
   ite amount of resources this is but another justification . 
  most other refugee situation in history ended up with a cultural integration and often even to the economic benefit of the host country , particularly in our situation where the population is so old most countries are looking at serious and hurtful retirement reform in the next few years . 
  no other event lile this in history ended up with the host country going hungry or economically devastated ( unless you can provide examples and proof of it ) . 
  us in europe are certainly far from risking that . 
  but when realistically such an influx of immigration has the potential to expand our economy overnight , these sorts of arguments reveal what 's really behind them . 
  and it 's not rational . 
  well , the thing that 's wrong with it is that this mentality has fueled literally every single non-civil war in history ( and even then ... ) . 
  as long as we continue refusing to let go of these primitive ways of thinking ( that , granted , served a purpose in a pre-political and literally prehistoric world ) , preventable human suffering will continue to exist , to the detriment of us all . 
  because the same way we condemn ( i hope ) the holocaust that happened not a century ago , we will be judged for this , and furthermore for not having heeded such a recent , drastic , and unambiguous cautionary tale . 
  and if on top of all of this you continue maintaining that `` there 's nothing wrong with this '' , well , i 'm at a loss for words . 
   i hate seeing my culture destroyed and how , exactly , would that come about ? 
  how would , say , 100k refugees `` destriy your culture '' in a country of 65million ? 
  hell , 5 % of the population there is muslim already . 
  i 'm sorry , but i fail to understand the argument , in that i do n't see how this immigration would substantially change anything . 
  in practise and most people 's mind , there is no such distinction . 
  they only seek to rationally justify their prejudices , and for that , these subtle differences do wonders . 
  in reality , it 's all down to tribalistic mentalities of rejecting and fearing `` the other '' . 
   before you start blathering , vicente fox he was not quite all right in the head , and whether he actually said this or not , does n't prove anything aboit what yoi 're claiming . 
  illegal immigration into the us is a phenomenon that predated him by decades , is perfectly explainable , and furthermore has even been decreasing afaik . 
  these sorts of conspiracy theories frighten me in that some people seriously consider them plausible . 
  a slippery slope argumenr ? 
   people will disagree about where on that scale things stop being reasonable . 
  i hope you understand what it is you 're defending here ( do tyou frequent this sub much ? 
  ) , because `` reasonableness '' , it is not . 
  i wo n't turn this into a personal argument ( mainly because i do n't what it is exactly that you consider '' reasonable '' in this particular debate ; you 've been careful not to sully yourself with it ) , but boy am i dismayed at the kinds of things i 've read here in the last few days . 
  but hey , as long as we 're not even remotely inconvenienced , huh ? 
  i 'm having a really though time understanding what 's so `` completely moral , yet just expressing a different opinion '' , about supporting the non-compliance with a simple universal human rights tenet . 
  i 'm sorry about this , and you can call my argument an appeal to emotion all you want , but you ( the collective `` you '' ) simply can not have it both ways . 
  after literally centuries of building this continent ( western europe ** and ** the uk ) on colonialism and exploitation over the rest of the world , very directly owing our wealth and stability to those times ( and at the detriment of developing nations ) , it 's wholly and completely hypocritical and yes , immoral , to just want to close off the borders and shield ourselves from all those disgraced people , citing vague fears of `` overwhelming of our welfare systems '' , or using simply racist or xenophobic rhetoric regarding their intrinsic morality ( or supposed lack thereof , to be more exact ) . 
  so , again , i fully respect your right to have an opinion . 
  what you do n't get to do , though , is say and feel like you 're somehow justified in supporting these immoral measures . 
  i hope a similar thing will happen all throughout europe . 
  the responses in this sub , a reflection of the general radicalisation and right-shifting in public opinion in the last few months ( and noticeably even weeks ! ), 
  is something i would not have thought possible some 6-7 years ago . 
  the german people are not the only ones who have required help throughout history . 
  all of us have . 
  how soon we forget !, 
  a beacon of hope amongst all the veiled ( and not so veiled ) xenophobia that has been going on in this sub in the last few days . 
  thankfully countries which massively accepted european jews during wwii did n't think this way . 
  i 'm not forcing anyone , but i disagree that this is simply a master of choice . 
  we have a duty towards less fortunate countries . 
  if for nothing else than because through the centuries our progress and growth have come at the expense of other countries . 
  no , that 's not even remotely the point . 
  humanitarianism does n't mean expecting the same in return . 
  it means they 're fellow human beings who through no fault of their own ended up in an extremely fucked up place . 
  it would have been hard enough just to have to leave their home countries and everything they know and love behind ( and having to watch it be destroyed ) , but now they also have to endure the humiliation and indifference of being called opportunists and no country being willing to help then out . 
  my appeal to relatable circumstances was meant only to facilitate empathy . 
  it should n't even need to be said . 
  how soon we forget . 
  not only do i completely disagree with this fatalist notion , but i also think you 're completely missing the point . 
  or wilfully ignoring it , which is worse . 
  i sure hope our countries never end up getting into a war where we would need to go somewhere else as refugees . 
  and i 'm not arguing for a no-questions-asked open-doors policy either . 
  but i also take issue with the `` opportunistic '' mentality , to an extent . 
  they are not enemies , they 're looking for a better life . 
  they were n't born on the right place to achieve that . 
  it 's certainly a bit douchy to effectively take the resources meant for real refugees , i agree there . 
  what we risk of course is throwing it real refugees . 
  it 's not a simple problem and there are no simple solutions . 
  but if we turn the discourse into veiled xenophobia and essentially racism ( aside from the usual paranoid tribalistic quarrels between member states ) , we are n't going to be able to solve this in the best possible way . 
  and i fully believe the other nations should work together and chip in with resources/infrastructure to help deal with this situation , but this tribalistic/reveng-y attitude is awful and not conducive to any meaningful solution at all . 
  40 years down the road i think we will all look back to this moment and feel collectively ashamed for what political discourse and perhaps even actions this has generated . 
  it 's almost as if we have learnt nothing , and the ideological critics of the eu are right in that this can only function as long as `` things are good '' . 
  we 're talking about human beings here , for ducks sake . 
  and they 're escaping very real threats . 
  how can we be so heartless ? 
  this is a problem for the whole of europe , why would you consider them going `` somewhere else '' to be `` lucky '' ? 
   and i just find it funny that all these `` left '' just ca n't wait to label someone same as their hated opponent `` right '' so are you really better than them ? 
  please do explain what you meant here , then , specifically by using the commas . 
  i 'm genuinely curious . 
   i am however vouching for a reform in migration would tou care to explain what specific policies you would like to see implemented in a migration reform , then ? 
   something must be done before this gets out of hand . 
  or else i fear more refugee centres will burn and more thalys train shootings will happen . 
  because , and forgive me if i 'm misrepresenting you here , it sounds to me like you 're arguing that neonazis ' doings is at least indirectly the fault of the immigrants coming here , and therefore that the easiest solution is for them not to come . 
  instead of , you know , capturing and trying people commiting these acts , and o treat immigrants by the same laws . 
  please do correct me if i 'm wrong . 
   just because one of these groups are total scumbags with no excuse for burning down a freaking refugee center for innocent people does n't mean the other one 's totally clean funnily enough , the opposite also holds true . 
  how is homophobia amongst a certain group of people grounds for anti-immigration policies ? 
  you 're fearmongering , i think , when you talk about `` a threat to european culture '' . 
  these are comolex problems , so i wo n't prete d to defend that a conpletely open doors policy with no other changes would lead to a wonderful world , but do you not understand that tribalism and xenophobia feeds into these particular groups and makes them double-down on their anti-western propaganda in their own countries ?
