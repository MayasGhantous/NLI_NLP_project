  not to talk about those who actually migrate . 
  if they 're looked down upon as subhuman , second-class citizens , what options do they have ** but ** to remain isolated within closely-tied communnities that favour radicalisation and discourage cultural integration ? 
  i 'll spare you from personal stories and anecdotes , but as with most issues , a big portion of it can be solved with education . 
  and that ca n't happen if they 're ever more closed off to the rest of society . 
  they come for the economic opportunities ( and let 's not kid ourselves here , they benefit us greatly on that front , as do most immigrants ) , let 's help them realise that our way of life is also something worth sharing in . 
  am i wrong or did you just proclaim that somehow left/right on a political spectrum is somehow a subjective thing ? 
  because if that 's the case , wow . 
  i 'm sorry you feel so strongly about it that you felt the need to directly insult him . 
  i guess this means you felt identified with the group of people he was talking about , and then felt insulted . 
  being objective , though , i do n't think you can positively deny that out of the people/parties/associations / platforms that support , disseminate , and propose anti-immigration and generally xenophobic measures , the vast majority , and indeed probably all of them , are of a right-wing political orientation . 
  so while his form was n't adequate , he is factually correct . 
  it is , to me . 
  would you mind elaborating a bit , please ? 
  thanks !, 
  not within the eu with sepa , they do n't . 
  and they did n't before that in those kinds of corporate accounts either . 
  it seems that when cornered for actual reasons , you need to resort to fud to explain what is ultimately an opinion . 
   it would take a seriously heavy toll on our company . 
  by all means please explain how , and what your position is within that company , because it is my understanding that once infrastructure is paid for and maintained , the data itself incurs in no additiinal operational costs for the provider . 
  i might be extrapolating from regularly wired isps , but i can not imagine why or how it would be any different for mobile providers . 
  at worst they 'll be forced to upgrade their infrastructure sooner than they might have otherwise due to increased usage , but i have trouble believing tourism as compared to the regular population of a country would represent such a huge increase in usage . 
  i 'm genuinely curious . 
  do you have some more details about how net neutraility is being lost with this legislation ? 
  he was n't just `` complaining '' , he had a very valid point regarding agendas and intentions behind certain threads . 
  you 're free to disagree with it , but you could as well explain your reasons for why you did . 
  doing it the way you did made you sound reactionary , that you are unwilling to discuss , and just generally lending credence to his point regarding agendas ( and his insinuation regarding blatant racism and xenophobia going unchallenged in this sub ) . 
  so let me get this straight , your problem is n't that they observe , but that they * learn * from it ? 
  am i reading this correctly ? 
  your genuine rebuttals to his comments i have no problem with , for all i care you could engage in an eternal debate with him about it . 
  what i take issue with is you responding to some comment with essentially `` stfu , this sub is not for you '' . 
  so why have n't mods enforced a restricted access until you submit documentation proving you 're european ? 
  this is a subreddit , and while i would like stuff here to remain on topic and not turn into yet another forum for american politics , it 's simply insane to believe or expect that only europeans should be allowed here . 
  it 's one thing not to cater to their interests , and another to shut them up because `` they 're not a part of this club '' . 
  he expressed , i think , a valid opinion ; but if you disagree with him you should debate him on the merit of it , instead of snapping with an ad hominem . 
  that or try to push a vote to make this sub restricted only to europeans . 
  but if that happened , i , for one , would unsubscribe . 
  it 's a public forum . 
  if you want a private forum , go to your town hall meetings . 
  i for one not only do n't mind , but actually like that people from other places come and watch , perhaps even ( oh the horror ! ), 
  asking questions to better understand the world around them . 
  it speaks to their willingness to learn and their open-mindedness . 
  one ca n't have the kind of opinions you expressed and then complain `` lol americans are so stupid for believing stereotype x '' ... 
  i mean , you could , but that would n't be very smart . 
  i 'll try reading the book in spite of myself , but from a cursory overview , i just do n't see how it solves the problems we 're discussing here . 
  i take it by your username ( and assuming this is your main account ) , that this is an ideology you 're deeply invested in , and that 's cool , but it should n't mean you have to have your mind closed to valid criticisms and holes in the theory 's logics . 
   if you understand how companies like uber and airbnb are disrupting entire sectors for the better i 'm not sure it 's `` for the better '' , but they sure are making those sectors much cheaper than they used to be . 
  i certainly understand how they work , but aside from not seeing how they apply to this topic ( using lay/untrained/non-professional people to offer services that used to be relegated to people who were devoted to them ) , i just get the feeling that you 're / they 're throwing these hip buzzwords/concepts out there as if they will magically solve a complex matter because reasons . 
  have you seen `` parks and recreation '' 's episode `` fluoride '' ? 
  this is exactly how i feel when i read these sorts of propositions . 
   let governance systems do what they do best , and let other suppliers do what they do best here 's a few facts for you : the us is the last first world country that relies on almost exclusively private healthcare , and it 's by leaps and bounds the [ least efficient healthcare system ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_%28ppp%29_per_capita ) in the [ world ] ( http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/data/oecd-health-statistics/oecd-health-data-health-care-quality-indicators_data-00592-en ) .

  now , i choose this example because it 's the most marked in terms of how differently a country does things different to the rest . 
  admittedly , an n = 1 example is a hard thing to draw conclusions out of , so feel free to try and debunk it , but at the end of the it 's very much in line with the rest of the examples with less dramatic differences of when countries choose to have private businesses provide services on its behalf , and i for one believe what evidence we have should not be ignored . 
  not that this is an unexplained phenomenon , mind you : it 's only logical ( as i think we went in circles around a few days ago when we started this debate ) , that when a business needs to extract some benefits from providing a service , there 's a ceiling to the efficiency they can achieve ( but more realistically will always strive to drive margins to be ever higher ) , as compared to a government that does n't need to profit from said service . 
  this is a case of ( at least with ancap ideology ) of irreconcilable inner contradictions . 
  i think your ideology is compelling , do n't get me wrong , but until there is some hard data , or at the very least some very concrete and accounted-for projections and example budgets for how this could be balanced , i will remain very skeptic of the libertarian/anarchocapitalist/whateveryourthingiscalled model of `` businesses can self regulate and do everything better and more efficiently/cheaper than the government can '' . 
  and if you 're a person that values objectivity and logic , you should n't be dismissing what the evidence that 's already out there is telling you . 
   if they 're to receive no services from a nation service provider , why ask them to pay for them ? 
  because i did n't say they would n't receive services , only that they 're not to vote on them ( except with their feet i suppose , as you say ) as they 're but incidental beneficiaries of them . 
  and even if they 're incidental beneficiares , they derive huge profits from them . 
  the argument for taxing corporations is that it reduces the tax burden on ** people ** . 
  i guess a scheme could be devised to tax people a great deal more and corporations none ( the same way an argument could be made against vat ) , sure , but aside from requiring a huge restructuring of the tax systems , in reality the fact is simply that the people , indirectly , have chosen for it to be so . 
  a government is made by and for the people , and corporations are not people . 
  `` stealing '' ( to use an ancap/libertarian term ) from a corporation is a far lesser wrong , as corporations are not people . 
  is it clear at all what i 'm trying to get at ? 
  i mean , i do n't disagree too much , but i think you 're greatly overstating its relative importance to other far more tangible , and costly gvorenment services as a real indicator of good services provided by a government that is taxing comparatively little . 
   the absurdity of the current system becomes very obvious . 
  i do n't think it 's absurd , but it 's definitely as good as technology allowed it to . 
  there just is n't a practical way to reach a consensus where the whole population gets to decide on complex matters ; particularly matters that require technical knowledge . 
  adding to the fact that we also require certain safeguards against `` the tyrrany of the masses '' . 
  it 's not perfect , but it 's better than any possible alternative for right now . 
  i do believe we 're on the verge of a technological/political revolution in that regard , with technologies like the blockchain permitting for as of yet unforseen direct participation and automatic enforcement of truly democratically decided-on matters . 
  at this point i forget what your argument against democracy was as it related to the matter of corporate taxes , but surely you were n't proposing a better alternative that nobody in history had been able to do , right ? 
   honestly , if a company like apple had that percentage of customer dissatisfaction , they 'd go bankrupt in days . 
  sure , sure ; but then again the objectives of governments and lawmakers vs. that of shareholders could n't be further apart . 
  this analogy does n't make sense as a valid one , and at any rate i , again , do n't see what you were trying to arrive at with it . 
   i do n't see how it can possibly be claimed that the current political os represents `` the will of the people '' . 
  well , as close to it as it will ever get to be . 
  even with the technocratic revolution , the fundamental inability of reality to accommodate all possible opinions and wishes will not be changed . 
  what will change is the rate at which progress can happen ( ie : the time between the emergence of an issue and its resolution ) , and it will protect the populace from the tyranny of money over politics which is an issue that has only reached absurd levels ( in effect eroding the democratic process ) in recent decades . 
  there will still , and i think always will , be sectors of the population which are unhappy with the results on any given decision . 
  one thing i can guarantee wo n't happen in such a world , though , are situations where a corporation like apple gets to pay next to nothing at all while the citizens are taxed quite a bit to continue to aid ** it ** to make more money which in the end ends up being funneled to foreign investors and executives , never to be seen `` trickling down '' into the economy or the people of that country again . 
  but until then , a proposal for a law that attempts to solve this issue ( caused by corruption in the first place ) union-wide is a good first step , even if it arrived a few years later than it should have . 
  i see you forgot to address the simple mathematical impossibility that is that you claim you 'd like for everyone to pay very little taxes while still getting tons of services in return . 
  i 'm more worried about this amongst your arguments ( most of which i think we 've found i at least partly agree with ) than anything else . 
   they provide these services for two categories of client : private ( citizens ) and corporate ( companies ) this notion is extremely worrisome for me . 
  functionally they provide services to corporations , sure ; but on principle i do not agree at all that they should seek to serve corporations . 
  a government is elected by and represents the citizens , and nobody else . 
   there is a market of nations , each vying for your custom . 
  i do n't disagree with this too much , except when you include corporations in the list of `` propspective customers '' . 
   luxembourg is n't much lower in terms of price , but presents amazing value in terms of service not substantially different than those offered by other european countries . 
  now , to corporations , they offer and ** extremely ** good deal , and it should n't be the case , because they fund those services with private citizens ' tax dollars mostly . 
  and they 're in the hard situation that a lot of their own people do n't oppose this , because due to this vicious causality cycle their economy is centered around financial services , and those people are employed by these corporations . 
  plenty of luxembourgans are extremely displeased with this situations , though , rest assured . 
   estonia is perhaps a better example : taxes are quite a bit lower , and the whole interaction with government is done online they , however , offer what i would describe as substantially ( or proportionately , to be more accurate ) less services to their citizenry . 
  i think it 's odd that you choose to use '' ease of interaction with the government '' as a metric for provided services , that 's not at all the first ( or most expensive , or urgent ) thing that comes to mind when one thinks of government services . 
   but it 's not too farfetched to imagine a start-up in the future that would act on behalf of a million average joes and negociate a better tax deal with their government . 
  it is in that form , but the more likely , and actually existing situation is that of people electing the kind of politicians that run on making government efficient ( which might be in the form of lowering taxes or upping services ) . 
   what i 'd like to see is not that apple pay a higher tax to be the same as you , but that you would pay the same tax as apple currently do , for a better service . 
  thing is , you see , is that this is a mathematical impossibility .
