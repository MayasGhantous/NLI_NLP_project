  it 'd be completely unsustainable . 
  these government services are n't cheap , and whatever potential for improvements always may exist , in general tax revenue is pretty efficiently turned into services . 
  at least in europe . 
   why , though ? 
  this is a simple one : because i elect it to be so . 
   i mean , you do n't equate your interests with those of any other provider , do you ? 
  but you see , government is not just a service provider . 
  it 's also the embodiement of the will of the people . 
  it 's innacurate to compare them to an isp , for instamce ( even though they could also , in fact , provide internet services if the people will it to ) . 
   is it because you get to vote once every 5 years ? 
  you got it ( saving of course the extreme oversimplification of this : we vote at least every year and a half or 2 , and there are many other ways to interact with the government in a causal manner ) . 
   a tax is introduced as a minor percentage of the overall system , and gradually augments to take over the system itself as time goes by . 
  you do n't make any mentions to the kinds of services that have been introduces by european governments in the last century as opposed to countries with lower tax rates . 
   realising that every day since new year has been spent working for someone other than oneself . 
  i 'd be surprised if many people at all actually felt this way . 
  i know i do n't . 
  i get plenty of services that i would n't in other places . 
  it 's a big reason for why i decided not to stay in the us , actually . 
   when you look at smaller and more streamlined nations giving citizens as well as corporations a better service for a lower price ( luxembourg , for example ) please do expound on what `` services '' does a nation offer to a corporation other than a low tax rate ? 
  at any rate , luxembourg 's income tax rates [ are n't particularly low as compared to the rest of europe , so i have no idea of what you 're talking about ] ( http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/taxes/income-taxes-abroad/luxembourg/index_en.htm ) . 
   it comes from corporations that choose nations where they will be treated in a business-friendly manner , i.e. 
  not like cash cows did i understand you wrong , or did you just say that corporations make governments lower the taxes on the citizenry ? 
  no ; citizens via democratic pressure , make sure the taxes on them are kept at the lowest levels possible for the services as a society we 've decided we want them to provide . 
   london now has over 600,000 french people you 're , again mixing up citizens and corporations.we can debate both , but please do n't use them interchangeably . 
   given that corporations pay a fee ( taxes ) for services they 're receiving it 's hard to make this argument when via loopholes some companies end up paying almost nothing at all . 
  apple pays 2 % of revenue income in ireland . 
  is it better than 0 ? 
  sure . 
  is it a fair taxation for the services provided ? 
  hardly . 
  ireland decided to allow this for a variety of reasons , from lobbying and corruption to a few jobs formirish people . 
  but make no mistake about it . 
   when either of them gets a bad deal , they vote with their feet , get out of the country and find a better deal elsewhere . 
  precisely , which is what this proposed law would minimise , by preventing some countries from allowing their citizenry to subsidise the services provided to some corporations . 
   but you 're still equating the interests of a state with the interests of its citizens oh , i most definitely am , at least on a large enough timescale . 
  i do n't subscribe to the various conspiracy theories on unchallenged and unchallengeable nepotism and oppresive governments , based on my lifelong experience as being an informed citizen of the european union . 
  and i see this proposed law as an extension of that democratic process . 
  parkinson 's law was never a serious hypothesis describing an economic phenomenon , much less a proven one . 
  in tax revenues , it makes particularly little sense , given the constant political pressure to lower taxes on the citizenry , and which , rest assured , happens all the time whenever the budget allows for it . 
  a fact you also overlook is that even if this were n't the case , a country having a superavit in the budget does n't mean that money magically vanishes ; it gets converted into governmental services . 
  and you 're again , equating the consumer market with corporate headquartering , in a manner that does n't make sense . 
  corporations are not customers countries want to sell anything to . 
  if a corporation moves to another country due to lower taxes , its overall effect is detrimental to the citizens of both countries ( and the redistribution power of both countries as it relates to this company becomes greatly diminished , leading to more concentration of wealth towards the top executives of the corporation , leading to more economic stagnation ) , even if comparatively the country where the corporation moved to benefits somewhat with more jobs and a tax revenue that it did n't have before . 
  you could frame it as a game theory problem , and one where if all the countries in a given market agree to set equal rules , all would stand to benefit . 
  earlier in your previous comments you made a comparative argument with the us , while obviating the fact that the us , being a single country , collects federal taxes irrespective of the states ' laws , and then somewhat redistributes it through federal programs . 
  this is essential because some states can only function due to this federal aid , due to the gross inequality between some states . 
  i 'm not sure this is a model we should be attempting to mimic , at least not as long as we want to maintain some semblance of national sovereignty . 
  i not only remain unconvinced by your arguments , the more i debate with you the more i realise how good of an idea this law is . 
  perhaps if you had any kind of source whatsoever to backup any of your claims ... 
  but , you did n't actually answer my question . 
  you seem to be equating companies with people , and countries with companies , and drawing parallels between the consumer market and corporate headquartering . 
  none of this makes sense to me , so i 'm afraid i must insist on a source for your claims . 
  sounds like an excellent point , but if this were true ( and i do n't know for sure that it is n't ) , i think huge multinationals would not seek out these `` tax heavens '' . 
  something does not add up . 
  well , if they 're arguing for it , i guess we 're about to find out whether they 'll put their money where their mouth is . 
  i 'm not an expert in macroeconomics , but your argument does n't seem to make any kind of sense to me . 
  would you care expounding a bit more , and perhaps even sourcing your claim ? 
  imo if we 're all going to be beholden to a single currency , with no country having the control to inflate their own to make themselves more competitive in the exports markets , it only makes sense that we 'd have a unified taxing system . 
  these companies are allowed to operate union-wide while being able to choose to pay as little taxes as possible ... which of course can only be to the detriment of the taxpayers/consumers . 
  how can an increase in corporate tax revenue ** not ** lead a lower need for income taxes ? 
  oh by all means , please do clarify ... 
  do you then mean bbc in this case , then ? 
  i ca n't say i saw them misrepresent the technology . 
  or is the rumours that she was `` fired '' ? 
  because that , of course , even she denies . 
  i do n't see how this is relevant . 
  the scientific consensus is that gmos so far ** are ** pretty safe . 
  this is not to say that we should automatically open the floodgates ( and i personally support the eu 's general rulings on gm crops ) , but seriously , where 's the anti-s ` ience there ? 
  i do n't agree with the death sentences , but 20 years minimun without parole seems like a good starting point . 
  i completely agree , most people do n't treat this kind of stuff with the severity it deserves . 
  a while ago i read in a bok about the philosophical implications of increased life spans that when we get to live for , say , 300years , a murder would have to be considered a much greater crime than it is today , on account of the expected years of income generation , establishment of relationships , etc. 
  following this logic ( which i agree with ) , destroying the physical evidence of livimg things from millions of years ago , it should indeed be conidered a very , very serious crime . 
  but it has yet another implication : many of these sorts of fossils/ruins/sites get routinely demolished ** on purpose ** every decade in order to further commercial or political interests ( the recent destroying of the viking site to build a government building in dublin comes to mind ) , which i absolutely bet that are much more numerous than the atrocities perpetrated by single individuals . 
  so while i support that people who destroyed these nests get rightfully punished , i would n't want it to become yet another situation where individuals get punished but people or organisations with power or money do n't . 
  i 'm truly sorry for this , have an internet hug . 
  i genuinely do n't know what the solution is : on the one hand i think * certain * risks are to be accepted for the sake of saving some lives of people fleeing from a war zone , but on the other , i 'm not sure that all the integration classes in the world can make an adult who was brought up to believe child rape `` is no big deal '' , suddenly change their mind ( i hope i 'm wrong on this though ) . 
  the fact that this situation seemingly does n't have a happy solution m makes me really uncomfortable and preoccupied for the future . 
  in actuality , it 's about proper places of sleeping . 
  nobody in finland ( or sweden for that matter ) who really wants to have a warm bed has to sleep on the street . 
  pretty much the o ly requirement is to ask to be let into the shelter , follow some basic norms ( schedules and such ) , and like , not kill anyone , generally be violent or obnoxious , or consume drugs or alcohol while inside the shelter . 
  considering anyone who has a drug/alcohol withdrawal problem can also simply walk into a hospital to get help ( both immediate for the deprivation and an inclusion into an addictions programme ) , what we 're left with are people who simply do n't want the help , or are unwilling to pay the small price not to sleep on the streets , who 'd sleep in benches . 
  and from that perspective , expecting these people not to use up useful urban furniture seems far more reasonable . 
  the path that got us here and allowed isis to consolidate and continue o convince and recruit new militants ( includings people on the west ) , had quite more to do with us meddling in their affairs ( playing to support their enemies from centuries ago ) , quite literally labelling all of them `` terrorist states '' , and turning their countries to shit in the span of very few years . 
  and all of that for the single purpose of ensuring our access to cheap oil . 
  if you lived in one of those countries , had a reasonably high standard of living , and suddenly had this happen to you ... 
  i don ' know if you 'd be a terrorist , but i guarantee you you 'd be ** at least ** pissed the fuck off at the west . 
  hell , i am , and i 'm from here . 
  that said , this , too ( terrorist attacks on the west ) is a relatively new phenomenon , that is vastly predated by muslim immigration and integration . 
  so , surely , even though full integration might not be achievable , it does n't necessarily have to be problematic . 
  actually going back in time to before 9/11 ( or even better to the late 60 's ) would be a pretty sweet spot to live in terms of our cohabiation with muslims . 
  it is a difficult `` problem '' to hack , no doubt . 
  and i quote problem because perhaps `` full cultural integration '' is n't a realistic , or even a necessary goal to achieve peace . 
  perhaps muslims can coexist with europeans in europe , as long as we all respect each other , all the laws are being followed , and a minimum set of core values is shared . 
  of course i 'm talking about basic things like freedom to practise religion ( meaning no considering us infidels worth killing ) , gender equality , and no discrimination . 
  a big catch -- 22 i see with this situation , is that the muslim-origin people i know that posses these values have for all intents and purposes abandoned islam . 
  i do n't know whether there 's a denomination of islam that 's compatible with these things , but so far it looks unlikely , in my very limited experience . 
  the fact that it 's a difficult problem to solve , though , does not mean we should resort to turning our until-now ( badly ) repressed racism and xenophobia back up to 11 . 
  `` they '' ( observant muslisms ) consider us morally corrup because of our lifestyles , and that 's a problem they have . 
  but if we do the same thing , and use it as justification for all sorts of segregatorial or anti-immigration policies , then we are not being any better than . 
  i would n't say that 's what they 're doing .
