  they 're fleeing from a ( from their pov ) totalitarian state . 
  that said , what i think your overarching point is , is true . 
  us treating the refugees as subhuman , terrorist scum is very ironic and inconsistent . 
   it directly implies you want to live in near sterile environment . 
  advocating for hand-washing after using the toilet = ** directly ** implying i want to live in a sterile environment ? 
  you 're reaching insane levels of argument-stretching , i 'm afraid . 
   washing hands specificly directly after using the toilet does very little because of that does very little of what ? 
  of reducing choliform bacteria contamination and disemination amongst the population ? 
  i ask because i hope i 'm understanding wrong . 
   in either case you have not demonstrated you have education of any value . 
  i 've purposefully refrained from making an argument from authority , since facts should stand on their own . 
  but since you 're curious , i 'm actually a physician who , while not being a specialist in infectious diseases , has worked in the past in the field of public health . 
  i 'll take all of that as a yes , then . 
  hey if you wo n't go to dtudy microbiology to understand why fecal contamination is extremely undesirable even in the first world , then at the very least go and talk to your doctor about it . 
  i could answer point by point on all the assumptions you 're making where you 're wrong , but frankly , this is tiring , particularly for someone who 's proud of their not wishing to be educated . 
   like if it is even desirable to live in near sterile environment . 
  yet again , this is a straw man , as i 've never said , insinuated , or even hinted at something like this . 
  have a good day . 
   but bacteria out of mine ass specifically are safe . 
  if they were n't i would be infected already wow . 
  no , really , utter and complete wow . 
  so let me get rhis straight , just so i ca n't be accused of putting words in your mouth : you 're holding that choliform bacteria in general ( and yours in particular ) is `` safe '' ( both for yourself and for others ) , and furrhermore , that the opposite holds true ( that others ' is safe for you , excepting , and i quote , `` some very rare strains that are indeed dangerous '' , because you evidently do n't see the need for people to wash their hands after using the bathroom ) . 
  did i get it straight ? 
  because if it is , i truly have nothing else to say here , except to suggest to you that you take an introductory course in microbiology at your local university . 
  this is not an insult . 
   i never said toilets are perfectly clean which i said nothing of ( talking of straw men ? ), 
   or that washing hand is pointless . 
    genitals are among the cleanest body parts . 
  [ ... ] hands in contrast , organ for touching things , are far better environment for germs to spread . 
  well you did n't outright , but what sort of thesis were you defending here , then ? 
  please ** do ** clarify . 
   what are you so afraid of anyway ? 
  oh , so now we 're back to defending said thesis while * not * saying you should n't wash hands ? 
  i 'm afraid of people citing the advamces in modern medicine , which are mostly a function of improved hygiene , and then contradicting themselves by stating by saying that choliform bacteria ** on food ** [ `` is n't really dangerous in itself '' ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/pathogenic_escherichia_coli ) . 
  after accusing me of using straw men you go on to mention an indeed non-problematic infection in the modern world while ignoring [ the rest for some reason ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/fecal-oral_route ) . 
   you are a prime example of an educated idiot when all else fails ...  with an idiotic assumption that rest of the world is a sterile environment again doing the very thing you accuse me of , hey ? 
  where * on earth * did i say or imply that ? 
  i very much said the opposite , in fact , by precisely delimitating the difference between non-pathogenic bacteria ( in most of the rest of the environment ) , and the kind of bacteria that comes right out of your ass , and can indeed be dangerous . 
  now , do n't get me wrong , this is as fun as any other pointless debate on the internet , but unless you stop using fallacies ( let alone personal insults ) , i will just not bother respomding any further . 
  have a good day . 
   genitals are among the cleanest body parts you 're deluding yourself , i 'm sorry . 
  the whole area is riddled with choliform bacteria , and different people have their genitals colonised by different organisms ( group b strep , which makes it important to screen women before delivery so they do n't pass it onto the baby , ureaplasma and related bacteria that causes frequent utis , staph aureus . 
  which does n't mean of course that your hands at some point ca n't be more `` dirty '' ; but it 's really not the same if you go out to do , say , gardening , and get your hands full of soil and bacteria that would simply not survive inside your body , than to have them smeared with actual human pathogens . 
  it seriously blows my mind that in post - lister world and all the research that followed him there are poeple attempting to minimise the importance of it . 
  thankfully i assure you your doctor washed his hands both after going to the toilet and before seeing you . 
  and last but not least , i do n't want to touch yoir hand if you 've been handling your dick and not washed it afterwards . 
  regardless of your awareness of having gotten pee on them , your dick leaks after it 's tucked in , and there will always be residue in your underwear . 
  just was your hands , please . 
   you wash your hands and immediately grab with your sticky wet hands the same dirty handle people are touching on their way in . 
  the part you touch is the one people touch on their way ** out ** . 
  and thanks to people who do n't wash their hands after having touched their pee-smeared and choliform-infested dicks , i agree that it 's a disgusting hot spot for transmission of pathogens . 
  the hygiene hypothesis does n't necessarily ( or really ) support not washing one 's hands which has over and over , unmistakenly , proven to reduce the transmission of human pathogens in various environments . 
  being more prone to contracting the flu wo n't do any good to your immune system . 
  which is the bare absolute minimum , and doed n't do a lot to address the difficulties of climbing out of poverty , excepting not having to worry that their children would literally starve . 
  i already explained how they 're such . 
  what sense does it make that you need to prove to having lived in this city for 2 years before you can be granted a few nights of stay a year at the homeless shelter ? 
  what does * that * solve , excepting a very specific user case ? 
  same with welfare . 
  could i not rightfully call this `` xenophobic '' , at least functionally ), 
  i agree a lot , and i had n't up until i read your comment quite recognised the problem as such . 
  immigrants come into a western country being economically unfavoured . 
  they end up living in shitty places , and next to people in similar situations ( in my city , * that * neighbourhood is made up of immigrants , but also national drug addicts , generally prople of low socioeconomic status , and the roma , which , while not being really foreign at this point , have failed completely to integrate . 
  i guess in a sense this `` shields '' the higher classes by preventing `` these people '' from roaming around the rest of the city , but them being all together certainly makes all of these problems add work and synergise . 
  we 've known from the us 's experiment with `` projects '' that such arrangements simply do not work . 
  and the problem is made worse via a xenophobic and `` poorophobic '' policies regarding welfare . 
  if i got fired tomorrow , i 'd have no problem getting paid unemployment , at a large percentage of my current salary , and for quite a while . 
  my quality of life would likely not be affected at all , provided i found another job within the next couple of years ( which would be trivial notmonly to my education , but also because i would continue having disposablemincome that 'd allow me to continue educating myself if necessary , but certainly by not having to worry or face other problems inherent to poverty . 
  this is ** excellent ** , but it falls apart when it comes to people who currently do n't have ( or never have had ) a job , let alone foreigners . 
  how are these people supposed to be able to land on their feet again if they have to jump trhough infernal bureaucratic hoops ( and sometimes requiring to demondtrate to having lived in this city to be able to receive things as basic as homelessness shelter , let alone non-contributive pensions ) to have access to these benefits ? 
  the answer is , they ca n't . 
  they need to find the cheapest acoomodation in the cheapest part of town ( which means a drug and violence riddled neighbourhood in aa tiny appartment perhaps sharing a room with 2 other people ) with what little money they have or could manage to obtain ( via , of course illegal means if there are no legal means ) . 
  and even when they end up qualifying for such benefits , the welfare pensions are barely enough to be able to continue living in that part of town , in that shitty shared room with other people who might be themselves addicts or violent , and needing to eat in special social soup kitchens ... an awful way to live and completely comtrary to facilitating their integration , contentment , and finding of decent jobs . 
  access to social benefits needs to be humane , and it needs to be accessible , from the get-go , even to foreigners . 
  i know this is a hard fucking political sell due to human nature , but it 's the only sane way to reduce these problems in a significant way . 
   but i 'm sure you understand the true meaning of wahabi customs better than wahabis ... 
  i do n't see how this is the conclusion to the previous phrase . 
  your wife also ** is n't ** a muslim observant of the burqua . 
  so why are you using her as a source of information ? 
  is her job that of a mental healthcare worker and is she trained to look for and recognise the signs of psychological indoctrination ? 
  does her professional relationship with these women include a full debriefing , structural interview , and specific psychological tools for this purpose ? 
  or is it , oh wait , that they did n't outwardly seem the way abused women look on movies : bruised , tears permanently in their eyes , thousand-yard stare ( not that she 'd be able to see bruising on their faces if they had any ) , waiting tfor their husbands to get away for a second so they can ask for help ? 
  i see . 
  quality evidence here . 
  here 's a better question you could ask your wife , whose job we ignore : were these women going alone to conduct business with her ? 
  and if they were , could a man from her jobsite have conducted the same kind of business as your wife did with them , no problem ? 
  and what exactly is your wife 's job that , as a feminist , gives her the security that her perceptions are correct ? 
  what are her qualifications ? 
  and if we 're starting to use personal anecdotes in this debate , would it change your mind * at all * to hear the experiences of an actual mental healthcare provider with this subset of the muslim population , or even with muslims in general regarding their gender beliefs and attitudes ? 
   this is far more pronounced than the effect of religion . 
  this , aside from being , again , an attempt to exonerate islam from being the biggest offender ( a sad state of affairs ) , is terribly unsubstantiated . 
   and nazi symbolism ( ditto ) are good examples to me of the undue harship principle in action  but where is the `` undue hardship '' involved if some women choose to wear burka or niqab ? 
  this is the sort of naive justification that you simply can not expect to be passed for a valid debating point . 
  you will need to explain to me where the exact difference between these is , because i 'm not really seeing it . 
  i 'm srrious here , you would have made a far better point by defending the virtues of expressing all sorts of beliefs systems freely despite the consequences for freedom 's sake . 
  i 'll tell you where the `` undue hardship '' in wearing a piece of cloth over your head or whole body is : it marks these women as belonging to a belief system where , despite their claim to the contrary , the reasoning goes that a ) they are inferior to men ( as shown by various circumstances , from the fact that men do n't have to wear these despite the quraan calling for special clothes for men as well , from the fact that a woman ca n't be allowed to drive , go anywhere without a man from their family , or be trusted to be and speak with any non-relative man under penalty of barbaric punishments ) b ) thry are sexual objects are the causative agent for men 's lust , and covering themselves is their responsibility in avoiding crimes of lust , c ) hinder normalised interaction in the western world ( which is a fucked-up way for a growing up girl to develop , and which will hinder that nlrmal and healthy development ) , and d ) not unlike nazi symbolism , it represents a belief system that ( excepting `` no true scotsman claims to the comtrary since , you know , it 's in the fucking book for all to see ) that calls for a war and killing of infidels and apostates ( letting aside women for committing all sorts of various crimes like deciding to have sex with a man other than their husband , and that , far from calling for it , has caused literally incalculable deaths both in distant and recent history . 
  oh and of course , the small tiny detail that e ) the fact that in their countires of origin ( impossible to dissociate from what happens in the west mind you ) , ** they do n't have a choice on whether to wear it ** , both due to literal laws on the matter , and due to their families demanding it under threat of various bodily punishes ( including death which , did i mention is perfectly a-ok acclrding to their belief system which you claim they simply want to celebrate and express freely ? ), 
  not that all of that is necesary to prove `` undue hardship '' mind you , as imo you could just take any of those letters to argue such . 
   this has been seen as an `` excess '' that has unfair or dangerous consequences and needs to be prohibited which is exactly the same reasons this ban is justified . 
  it should n't be an exception in your arguments because it 's an example with many more parallels to this situation than you 're willing to accept ylurself . 
  now , before engaging in no-true scotsman arguments to defeat some of my arguments regarding islam ( particularly in the places where the burqa is used ) , just answer me this : if this is truly a free expression of religious fervor , tell me what would happen to one of these women in their home countries ( bjt also sometimes in the west ) , if they decided they did n't want to wear those clothing articles for a day while having a walk through the city .
