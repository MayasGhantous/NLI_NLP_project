  and we can take it from there . 
  plus , you did n't answer my question . 
  is this a sort of reductio ad-absurdum ? 
  regardless , it 's wrong . 
  other practices from different cultural/religious groups are also outlawed . 
  from fgm , to the aforementioned swastika , to some specific cults in the us , and scientology in germany . 
  there really are a lot of different examples from all over the world , depending on which practices from which cultures/religions become a sufficiently grave problem for that particular country for that particular timeline . 
  so i guess what i 'm saying is that i do n't see where i 'm even tacitly making that claim . 
  but you absolutely know this , because you needed to make the `` non polygamist '' exception to make your point . 
  so i 'm not sure what exactly is it you 're attempting to say here , when you 've shifted you main debating point from defending islam 's treatment of women or arguing against this new law , to i guess attempting to make claim stuff or making me feel ashamed for defending the points that i am . 
  you 're attempting to bring it into personal ground , and i wonder why that is . 
  that said though , i think you raise an interesting question . 
  the question of , in this moment in history which religion is having the biggest and most grave effect in its treatment of women . 
  personally i do think islam in general takes the cake on this one , but i 'm nor prepared to defend that claim in a formal debate . 
  regardless of it is or is n't , though ( and i 'm open to consider alternative religions for the spot of `` worse treatment of women with thr biggest societal impact right now in switzerland , so educate me ) tryingng to , via a debate , split hairs to not earn the title of '' the religion with ** the absolute worst ** treatment of women '' , is already a pretty sad state of affairs which makes me , again , wonder why you 're embarking in this `` crusade '' . 
  as i said , this was not my thread . 
  but regardless , was there any particular source or secrion of that wikipedia page that you wanted me to look at ? 
  from a quick overview i see no mentions to studies on the attitudes you were debating about . 
  if you 're judt expressing an opinion , that 's fine and we can leave it at that . 
  if you were trying to debate , though ( among other things to continue evolving your personal opinions ) , comparing a goddamned burqa to christianity is just qualitatively incorrect , and i was pointing that out . 
  really ? 
  ones whose husbands truly do n't care either way , and who wear it of their own accord , ey ? 
  be sure to have them contact their nearest liberal tv station , they 're looking for those kinds of interviews to show islam in a progressive light . 
  oh , wait , you said `` not being beat into it '' . 
  yeah well , rhat 's a different beast . 
  do you know anything about indoctrination at all ? 
  the fact that pcp is illegal does n't stop people from taking it , yet it does n't mean the law is wrong . 
  are we now supposed to legalise or not even bother about anything that is n't 100 % enforceable , regardless of how actually wrong it is ? 
  evidece , crappy as you might think it is , can only be debunked by higher-quality evidence . 
  if you ask for evidence , it 's insane to judt not accept what is given . 
  you 're free to disagree , but you simply can not logically hold your argument without higher quality of evidence . 
  pmease note i 'm saying nothing on this matter , only pointing out the faults in your arguments . 
  you seem to not understand the difference between pressure and repression . 
  the christian daughter , if she decided to dress scantly for haloween , would perhaps be looked down upon by her dad , but she would not be beat , and certainly not killed . 
  her ( backwards and sexist foe sure ) religion does n't justify or downright demand those sorts of punishments . 
  while she may decide not to , she truly is ** free ** not to follow those guidelines , because they are not quite literally law in the place she comes from . 
  do you truly not see the differemce here ? 
  i 've yet to see a single inteview with one of these supposedly protesting women against the bans where the husband is like `` i truly do n't give a shit whether she wears it or not '' . 
  not a single one . 
  something to think about , ey ? 
  this is an interesring debate , and while i 'm the first to declare there are no perfect solutions , i think i side with banning it . 
  allow me to explain . 
  observant muslims claim that the burka and niquab are an expression of religious freedom . 
  yet we ** know ** there is a rather non-insignificant number of women for whom this is n't even remotely the case . 
  they 're not expressing themselves freely , but they 're rather afraid and peer-pressured into it . 
  it is absolutely possible that `` genuinely psychologically free '' women will be inconvenienced by this restriction , yet they should be the first to understand the necessary sacrifice will lead to a bigger good for their kind . 
  the fact that they do n't i find deeply disturbing , the way i would find people protesting for the freedom to use the swastika or the confederate flag . 
  is it a restriction of a certain freedom and is it generally undesirable ? 
  sure . 
  but sometimes for very specific reasons involving the greater good , the trampling of individual rights becomes necessary . 
  mandatory vaccinations come to mind . 
  the fact that some people ( or even themselves ) claim that this will only serve to restrict their lives more by making them stay at home and preventing further integration are but confirmimg the necessity of this , and the repressive nature of those clothes . 
  if your religious symbol were banned tomorrow you 'd be pissed , but you would n't stop going out . 
  the fact that their husbands ( or even themselves ! ), 
  would rather they stayed at home rather than show their hair/face in public , is even further proof that there is something else going on aside from the religious expression , a kind of attitude regarding womanhood that simply has no place in the western value system . 
  and while part of this value system includes freedoms , it also includes protecting the weak and ensuring growing up free from these sorts of beliefs . 
  it 's not the west 's job to accomodate every possible way of living when that includes some sort of repression . 
  and that is demonstrably different from religious freedom . 
  well , it makes one wonder why , even after this same article has hit the front page from another sub , in this one it is being downvoted and has zero comments . 
  do these news not adhere to the narrative expressed over here over the last few days ? 
  is it inconvenient to find out all of our reactionary ( and non-reactionary ) racism and xenophobia was not only unjustified , but downright wrong ? 
  actually this would n't hold true because in such a state ( they exist and they 're called police states , absolutist states , or dictatorships ) , you can bet your ass nobody searches the homes of the people in power , the officers themselves , or anyone else in connection with `` the party '' . 
  yeah do n't get me wrong , the attacks were horrible , but living in a state with a functioning rule of law is much preferable than the alternative , even in those times were those same laws hinder preventing these things . 
  that said , things can always improve , and i 'm sure investing in smarter intelligence is the way to go . 
   and that anything give is entirely optional this is legally untrue ( are you unaware of this ? 
  ) , and morally abhorrent . 
  furthermore , it seems like you 're trying really hard to avoid saying you are ** against granting refuge to escaping syrians ** , while meaning exactly and unequivocally that . 
  for someone who 's accused me of plenty of appeals to emotion and other logical fallacies , this comes as a sad surprise . 
   you 've just basically filled in the blanks in your own head keep telling yourself that . 
  i 'd ask younto further clarify , but it seems you 're done actually debating . 
  feel free to prove me wrong , though . 
  otherwise , have a nice day . 
   good thing i did n't say this then . 
    now that we 're under attack here from those same `` fleeing '' people , am i allowed to flee to a richer country who are obligated to give me a free house ? 
  huh . 
  i must have completely and embarrasingly misread your implication from that ironic phrase . 
  if your implication was not that europe should stop accepting refugees , then , by all means , please explain to me what it is ** exactly ** that you implied with that joke ? 
   so it is entirely logical to have been against free entry from the beginning . 
  in other words , to summarise your answer to my question : ** yes ** , you were in fact against accepting refugees even before you got `` proof '' that `` refugees were murderers '' . 
  leaving aside the fact that this very answer from you hilariously comtradicts your former refusal to admit you were against accepting refugees ; i 'd say this whole answer qualifies you for the very terms you 're trying to distamce yourself from , and that you so indignatedly called me out on . 
  to recapitulate : you hold that it 's logical to not allow `` people from those religions/cultures/ethnicities '' to take refuge and reside in your country because , the only logical conclusion is that when they grow up they will do so holding a grudge against the country that took them in , and will end up perpetrating terrorist attacks . 
  do ii have it more or less correct , or is there some correction you 'd like to make to this summarising of your claims throughout this whole discussion ? 
  the funny thing is , with your first paragraph i agree somewhat . 
  it 'd be lovely if we could identify every single refugee and determine their origin and true need for asylum . 
  the reality , however , is a bit complex , and at the same time an inability to reliably identify them , should n't preclude them from gettimg asylum . 
  are there extremist islamists using the refugee crisis in their favour ? 
  absolutely . 
  is this , however , a sufficiemt reason ( even based on security concerns ) for countries to stop accepting refugees at all ? 
  and as i 'm sure you know , a ton of countries/groups have expressed their discontent with having to accept refugees , even before these attacks . 
  so something else is at play here . 
  so please , tell me , that up until these attacks , you were not so staunchly against accepting refugees . 
  is this true ? 
  that your beliefs follow logically the real observed risks , and you only becvame afraid of refugees ( understandably so ) upon learning that one of the attackers entered the eu using that route . 
  about me calling you racist : you 're right , it might have been the wrong term , given that you specifically did n't mention their race . 
  xenophobe , islamophobe , however ... take your pick . 
  are you recognising the untruthfulness of speaking in plural , and advocating for the abandonment of thousands upon thousands of human beings as a reaction to the very recent finding that one of tens of thoudsands of refugees was actually an isis operative ? 
  i 'm genuinely trying to gather what it is you 're saying here . 
  i 'm sorry , but wether my point is `` lazy , manipulative and counterproductive to a genuine conversation '' , rests entirely on whether he can produce evidence for what i asked , which would be the other only interpretation of his comment . 
  so you made yourself part of this debate by declaring my comment as such . 
  my bad , allow me to respond to your challenge .
