  your phrase `` now we 're under attack by those same fleeing people '' , it is a generalisation . 
  you 're using a plural , where apparently a single unconfirmed terrorist ( out of quite a few in an obviously highly coordinated attack ) came into europe using the refugee route . 
  that 's called generalising , and is one of the defining characteristics of racism . 
  but my point was that somehow this point would have been made even without these findings . 
  i actually edited my post to keep it short . 
  my next phrase was asking him to describe an instance where the terms were used to defend an ** actual ** murderer , like his claim was . 
  perhaps i 'm misinformed , but i 'm not anything if not open minded . 
  illuminate me with the answer to that question , please . 
  i 'm sure that 's your main worry , lol . 
  as a corolary , i womder if you 'd stay to `` defend your country '' , if the same situation arose in yours . 
  i was not aware , that 's terribly unfortunate for the current debate . 
  and no , i guess i did n't get the main point from your comment . 
  all i saw was racism . 
  feel free to explain it to me . 
  thankfully it does n't look that way . 
  well see , though . 
   people killed by refugee ?? 
  perhaps ( i have n't heard them though ) , but the comments in this very thread demonstrate nothing but sheer racism . 
  do you need concrete examples or will you see it for yourself ? 
   we 're under attack here from those same `` fleeing '' people well , i 'd sure love to see a modicum of proof for this interesting claim . 
  or is being `` from the same general geographic area or from the same religion '' enough to be considered literally the same people nowadays ? 
  so , just to be clear , what you 're implying is that muslim syrian refugees are murderers ? 
  is that it ? 
  is the documentary a fair representation of the book ? 
  will be sure to checj it out . 
  as much as i hate to say it , this is exactly the case . 
  and what 's worse is that we ( the collective we ) deserve it completely . 
  in a spur of racism and xenophobia , we sought to elect the representatives that would `` keep those people away '' , without regard for anything else . 
  but who would have thought that , when you vote for one aspect of society/morality to go back in time against the already achieved progress , that we would end up losing progress and liberties in other areas as well ? 
  this is why antiamericanism is idiotic when it shows up around this sub . 
  we got fooled by the exact same trick americans are persuaded to vote against their best interest , by conflating real issues and policy with bullshit '' issues '' that appeal to warped senses of morality or superiority , as well as primitive tribalistic ideas of `` us vs. them '' . 
  we deserve this , completely . 
  now we should try and learn from this , and stop backtracking on progress every now and again when we feel threatened by invisible boogey men . 
   they have n't really shown much irresponsibility on that end . 
  threathening with a loaded firearm is n't irresponsible ? 
  boy do i disagree . 
   i do n't blame hungary for acting the way they did but you did imply it . 
  you 're comparing a single , 5500 people event , with what hungary had to endure , and it 's not even comparable , not even taking into consideration the resources difference between the two countries . 
  in the end if you guys decide to exit the shengen agreement , i guess nobody can stop you . 
  it 'll just be one more chapter in the history books reminding us that , no matter how `` developed '' we think we are , when push comes to shove , history will always repeat itself . 
  got some sources for those claims ? 
  concern for what ? 
  what is the fear here ? 
  i 'm sorry if i find `` cultural compatibility '' a very ill-defined , yet in practice very euphemistic term for `` i do n't want to see people different than me around town '' . 
  not sure what your point is . 
  i mean i am , obviously , but you 're not making a coherent or rational argument at all . 
  `` a culture '' is n't a sentient organism . 
  it 's not a person . 
  `` destroying it '' , by however ridiculous definition you choose to adopt , does n't pose any kind of moral problem , no . 
  but more to the point : ** your ** culture is the direct result of what you call `` culture destruction '' ( which in reality is more like `` evolution of culture '' ) . 
  human groups have been moving around the world since we 've been humans , and while most of those culture-mixing events were effected via violent means ( wars and invasions ) , they remain separate concepts . 
  in this instance , there 's no violence eliciting this particular cultural-modifying event , so i truly see no problem whatsoever . 
   is it morally right to defend your identity ? 
  this is quite the loaded question , but let me put it like this : it 's only people with fragile personal identities that feel so threatened by any change to their group identity . 
  this does n't make any such people bad persons , but it does tend to lead to an easying of the path down justification for increasingly others ' - rights ' - violating actions , all the way down to violence ( if you 're willing to learn more about this subject , this has been the life 's work of notable psychiatrist dr. vamik volkan , who has some tremendously interesting books ) . 
  which is the answer to your question in fact : i do n't see a problem with `` defending your identity '' , as long as the means to `` defend your identity '' do n't end up hurting other people in matters more important than that of `` their identities '' . 
  at your level of arguing , this means restricting immigration which would lead to people not receiving help they need , but more importantly internationally-recognised ( by law ) rights to political asylum . 
  but this is not the end of the road for people holding this mentality , as indeed it 's what ends up justifying violence against this group of people in this continent . 
  i 'll take false analogy for 500 . 
  i do n't think he was saying otherwise . 
  but if your defense for this attitude is `` it 's not just your racist grandpa anymore who thinks in this manner '' , well , i 'd consider it a piss poor response . 
  and as a far an example i can go without going godwin law on you , but god dammit ... 
  since you 're so much into not conflating different concepts , i 'd ask you not to conflate the concepts of `` morally justified '' or `` ethically right '' , with `` majority opinion '' . 
  slavery was once perfectly socially acceptable . 
  up until surprisingly recently , homophobia was as well . 
  it did not make any of those things right , no matter how much you repeat the words `` culturally compatible '' . 
  what about the staff ? 
  or the non-smokers who 'll inevitably for one reason or another end upgoing there ? 
   that way smokers have their space and most bars still accommodate people who do n't want to ruin their lungs while getting a pint . 
  i think the reasoning goes that even in those few pubs there will be non-smokers ( not the least of whom would be the employees ) , that should still be protected from second-hand smoke . 
  in places where this has become habit , there really is n't that big of a problem for smokers to go out every half hour or so to get their fix . 
  and pubs are suddenly much `` cleaner '' places where even parents with small children can go amd hang out with their frienda . 
  i admire your optimism , and while having reached this point for the most part i agree with you , it does n't in any way invalidate my concerns , nor those of the people opposing the ttip . 
  which is how we even got to this `` comfortable '' spot in the first place , something you seem to forget , judging by your past comments . 
   i trust them and yet the opposers are the idiots !, 
   what you 're writing flies in the face of academic when it comes to international negotiations . 
  is that so ? 
  care to link to any such academic sources ? 
  nevertheless , i get a feeling that , whatever happens , the ttip will rewrite a lot of what was considered `` academic '' ( i 'm sure you meant `` diplomacy '' there , btw , as it 's quite a different thing ) . 
  the world , it 's a-changing , and ignoring that will be the downfall of many of these corporations . 
   if they change their mind when the agreement is made public , i might oppose it . 
  that 's the thing though , is n't it ? 
  you wo n't be able to !, 
   we can see what their model looks like in ceta . 
  because you say so ? 
  i thought it was unknowable . 
   i know people can be against ttip , they 're just stupid for being so at this stage . 
  see , i disagree . 
  the ttip is not the first agreement to be negotiated in secret , but it probably is the biggest one yet . 
  for that , it 's getting unprecedented publicity , which is a good thing . 
  in a post-2008 world , i do n't think it 's stupid at all to be extremely wary of under-regulated corporations negotiating with governments , ** in secret ** . 
  sure , there are hypothetical ( ie : post-hoc ) justifications for why secret negotiations could be better ( for some parties at least ) , but none of them are really convincing to the modern western citizenry . 
  so now , they 're not stupid for being against it , at any stage . 
  and not only because according to their own rules , by the time they would be made public it would already be too late to oppose them , but it certainly does n't help . 
  in such a world , there companies and governments are finding , either things are done out in the open , or they get sacked . 
  they 'll have to wait a couple of generations if they want a new , docile society of complacent people that trust blindly , but that 'll be the case only if those of us in charge of the world today do a good job of it . 
  is it at all relevant ? 
  dude , now you 're trying to argue about the specifics of ttip with me . 
  you contradict yourself ( how come you know the leaked chapter `` has changed radically '' if it 's still very much a secret ? ), 
  continuously , and i 'm just not interested .
