  the point of contention was wheter people could be against the ttip , and while obvious to anyone else , i had to demonstrate that it indeed was the case . 
  go try and proselytise tje ttip somewhere else , or at least not with me . 
   because you do n't know what 's in it yet . 
  you know at a certain point the text was leaked , right ? 
   oh wait , there are no concrete provisions because the entire thing is still being negotiated and subject to change . 
  right , but what ** did ** emerge at that point in time was sufficient to confirm the suspicions that ( surprise surprise ! ), 
  a trade being negotiated in secret was very ublikely to end up being favourable to either citizens or individual countries ' sovereignty . 
  those 2 aspect were more than enough to make public support of the ttip * as a whole * become very low , even if , as you very anally point out for some reason , technically the public still does n't know about individual provisions . 
  it 's not necessary to know the final form of the ttip to be against it , ** as it is happening ** , as much as it makes you angry . 
  excellent rebuttal . 
  good day . 
   however , is n't a key problem the real world cost and schedule overruns ? 
  is it ? 
  [ take a look at the active nuclear power plants ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_nuclear_power_stations ) none of whom , to my knowledge ( excepting for research stations ) are running at a loss . 
  i 'm at a loss because i never thought this was a contested point , and it seems we 're debating different matters . 
  now , granted , most of those currently running plants are based on 50 + year-old designs , and new power plants ** wo n't ** be built based on those . 
  and that 's for good reason , but it also comes at a cost . 
  i think our main disagreement stems from my willingness to tolerate some temporary price hikes and setbacks , because it means developing a new generation type of reactor that , aside from helping us continue to wean ourselves off of fossils , will solve the waste problems thatthe previous designs caused , and most of which right now lies in storage pools on-site , with continued maintenance costs . 
  i thought this was a worthy goal that even anti-nuclear environmentalists would jump on , but i seem to have miscalculated the actual reasons behind most anti-nuc environmentalism . 
  perhaps you might like to focus on the point at hand instead of feighing rightgeous indignation to derail the discussion ? 
  like , perhaps even refuting it or providing evidence to your claim ? 
  why go the anger route , when we 're debating objective matters here ? 
   nuclear also poses a level of risk far exceeding that of any other energy production method known but , this [ has been refuted to death ] ( https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20928053-600-fossil-fuels-are-far-deadlier-than-nuclear-power/ ) . 
  what further evidence do people like you need to finally see the issue from an objective pov ? 
   does solar have costs of waste storage into 100,000 years , or risk of accident ? 
  do modern fast breeder designs ? 
  do you even know that the answer to this question is `` no '' ? 
  because it does n't sound like you do . 
  plus , you seem to be greatly overestimating the ability of solar to provide reliable and continuous , year-long power , which it absolutely , most definitely , does not , and can never do . 
   the market has spoken . 
  actually it has n't , as it 's been greatly muddled and muffled due to uninformed opinions such as yourself 's . 
  nuclear was well underway to be greatly branched out and developed even further until the 70 's and 80 's when the anti-nuc movement really took off , with severe political ramifications . 
  citing `` free market '' as proof of anything is clearly a fallacious argument in light of a ) the market being dominated by fossil fuels as of today , and b ) the market not truly having been free to choose nuclear , as it had until the 70 's . 
   sure , it wrecks upstream ecosystems is this not enough ? 
  with fast-breeder reactors , `` nuclear waste '' really stops becoming a reasonable concern , whose environmental footprint is measurably much much smaller than that of even old-design nuclear plants . 
   are claiming that it is too late now . 
  ffffff ca n't tell you how much this makes my blood boil . 
   hydro i did n't expect an environmentalist to cite hydo as a viable option at all , especially as compared to fast-breeder designs , in 2016 . 
  i hope you realise that even chaim nissim has publicly conceded that his opposition to nuclear power at the time stemmed from a deep ignorance and overestimation of the risks . 
  in your previous comment you cite a 30-year development time and overestimated costs , as a reason for why nuclear should be abandoned as an option in favour of other renewables , while completely ignoring that , while getting better by the decade , we 're still living in a world that 's firmly run on fossils . 
  you also seem to be ignorant or dishonestly ignore the fact that the bn800 reactor design , while indeed having taken a lot of time and resources to develop , is actually well on its way to become an industrially-exportable design that 's already in the final stages of being sold to china , for one , to begin a `` ready-to-build '' installation . 
  this should resuce the cost by an order of magnitude , and i fully expect this to become the model for nuclear power in the xxi century . 
  citing `` historical costs '' as a concern when `` environmental '' activism has been historically reaponsible for much of that ( take superphenix 's some 70 months of politically-motivated downtime in its decade-long life , when it produced phenomenally high and operationally-cheap amounts of energy on the years that it was fully operational as a prime example ) , seems like a particularly shady brand of dishonesty . 
  make no mistake about it , history wo n't be kind to anti-nuclear activism in light of much it set back our eventual independence from fossil power . 
  i would n't be surprised if later analyses end up concluding that the reaching of the point-of-no-return regarding global warming could have been averted had nuclear power been allowed to be developed without opposition . 
  i ca n't express with words my disgust for this particular brand of irrational cult . 
   he would have faced trial before any extradition could have taken place . 
  that 's completely irrelevant . 
  do you understand that the sexual assault charges are n't what he 's ( rightfully ) afraid of ? 
  what the fuck does it matter however he 's found of those charges if afterwards he 'll be shipped off to the us under espionage charges ? 
  do you even comprehend the concept of political prosecution ? 
   he fled the country and later fled that country 's jurisdiction . 
  he did , although not while he was formally charged . 
  are you suggesting he should n't have been free to move in however manner he desired ? 
  i 'm finding your morals troublesome . 
   that is not trying to comply regardless of any offer he makes that suits his purposes . 
  that phrase is innerly-inconsistent . 
  he did try to comply in however manner did n't put him in danger of being extradited . 
  i happen to find a lot of meaning in the response from the authorities at the time , by refusing to take the offer for was , at the time and according to them , `` merely preliminary questioning '' . 
  i ca n't of course conclude from this that the whole thing was definitely and decidedly a sham , but it does lend credence to the notion , to anyone with half a brain . 
   would you accept this excuse for any common rapist ? 
  a ) the fact that he 's a rapist is not established ( funny that you 're just so damn keen to conclude that a 43 year-old man with no history of sexual offences whatsoever suddenly committed not 1 but 2 sexual assaults in the span of a few days in the context of a very politically-charged release of documents ) , and b ) if their life was in danger , and even if i were ** convinced ** he actually committed a sexual assault crime , you what ? 
  absofucking-lutely i would support them taking steps to prevent themselves being unjustifiable being extradited to a country with such a piss-poor record of human rights violations . 
  let me repeat this again , in case your inner mob-punisher does n't quite get it : even if he were indeed a rapist , i would completely support what he did , in the interest of not ending in the hands of the us . 
  every single person ( and country ) in the world understands this very basic tenet of international law that everyone should have a right not to be prosecuted unfairly by countries that do n't respect the right to a fair trial . 
  you would do the same , i would do the same , and thankfully there are plenty of other countries that agree and are willing to provide political asylum for that very reason ( a process that is no unlike a trial in itself , and that assange surely went trough by now , allowing him to remain under the protection of ecuador ) . 
   i just have read more than most people who comment on the subject . 
  if there 's any truth to this ( personal biases tend to be strong with people with such strong opinoins ) , i 'm ** very ** surprised by your conclusions on the matter . 
   i think i 'm entitled to judge  that 's not mob rule i 'll just leave that sink in for a second . 
   if he could be brought before a court he should be hey , i agree !, 
  it just so happens that due to the nature of the circumstances he was n't assured a fair treatment ( what with sweden being ready and willing to extradite him the second he fell into their hands ) . 
  the tried to comply , though , did he not offer to be questioned by the relevant authorities via videoconference and they refused ? 
  i 'm a bit fussy on the details this having happened so long ago , but surely someone so claims to be such an expert on the matter remembers all of this . 
   i have read the accounts they gave i see , indeed you believe in mob rule , as you have already made the judgement by having read something on the internet . 
  you do n't need to answer that question on my other comment . 
  and i wo n't be wasting any more time with you . 
   that 's his fault . 
  that 's the thing , is n't it ? 
  he 's an internationally prosecuted person , on account of his having divulged pretty embarrasing secrets about the us ' government . 
  imagine he - gasp - was n't guilty . 
  surely you could concede of this possibility ( and if you ca n't there really is n't much to discuss with you ) . 
  in this case , do you see how all of this anger and hatred for his character is distracting from the actual issue ? 
  you 're treating this person as guilty when it has n't been proven so . 
  are you of the habit of doing that , generally ? 
  do you see `` mob rule '' as a valid way to impart justice in a first-world country ? 
  but more importantly than that , you 're unable to separate opinions of individuals from complex matters from the organisations they 're leading . 
  that 's a huge problem for any citizen living in a modern democracy . 
  as / u/megakeeperman said , this is the kind of poor mental hygiene that has put the american voters in the current shitshow that they 're in . 
  ... and you do n't see any problem whatsoever with the fact that in your mind this man that leads this terribly important organisation that had done such good for the world , is nothing more than `` that rapist that is fleeing from the authorities '' ? 
  shit man , nobody is asking anyone to beatify him , and cults of personality are not my thing , but does it not at all cross your mind that this is a propaganda war , and discrediting the head of wikileaks is the ** first ** thing that any government who wanted to shut down what this organisation is doing , would do ? 
  and it 's working ; in this thread you 're not talking about the implications of the information wikileaks is about to release ; you 're preoccupied with a man potentially skipping from a sexual assault charge . 
  i do see your pov . 
  it 's a difficult and non-binary issue . 
  you bring up some good points . 
  it 's not , but you 're doing a false equivalency . 
  these people would n't be ok with their own cousins wearing normal swimsuits . 
  i mentioned the `` infidel '' bit for misguided effect , and that 's a factor for sure , but their issue lies with the dress code , with the threshold they have for considering something indecent exposure . 
  a far better equivalency would be how you 'd feel if at a nudist beach people looked at you weird , and even harassed you for wearing a swimsuit . 
  i have the sad impression that many people here would say `` well then it 'd be my fault for going to that beach , so i would get out of there '' , but they 'd be missing the point . 
  the point is that in a tolerant society , even if we preferred to be naked all the time , we should not be harassing people for not wanting to be so themselves .
