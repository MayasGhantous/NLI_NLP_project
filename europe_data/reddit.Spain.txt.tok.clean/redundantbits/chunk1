source ? 
  first of all , what i said may be inaccurate but it is not silly . 
  i just put ( maybe in a wrong way ) an example to explain things . 
  what is , really , silly , is to say that * they * have been pausing * everything * * forever * . 
  i think anyone a bit critic would see that . 
  pd : and i know the railway thing . 
  the one-way railway i use to go to barcelona is from 1931 . 
  i understand what you mean , i * feel * like you but i * think * this is a bit idealistic . 
  the spanish flag does n't represent me , but the spanish state does represent me since i can choose who governates it . 
  and if i 've learned something is that flags in the modern world are a bit like music genres . 
  i consider myself catalan , and in some part also spanish , and in another part i consider myself european . 
  as if a music band considers itself progressive folk rock whatever ... oh and this :  a m\u00e9s , no s\u00e9 , pot ser divertit . 
  ( anyway , i dunno , it could be fun . ), 
  please . 
  let 's be serious here . 
  this is why this movement has low credibility ( for me ) . 
  i 'd like to see if catalonia becomes a state how many catalans would want the spanish nationality and how many people would leave to country in the first difficult years to search for a better live . 
  i do n't see much compromise here ... 
  i think yes , though i 'll vote ` no ' . 
  i 'm no at all alone . 
  try not to generalise !, 
  not only on this but in general ( pun intended ) . 
  and here everyone uses english , 
  yes , now i totally agree with you . 
  i used to be very idealistic ( i was younger too ) . 
  however , if i have to take it this way , i will vote ` no ' . 
  this . 
  you nailed it . 
  what i want to say is this . 
  a lot of people voting one thing , even if it 's a majority , does n't make this thing * good * . 
  it makes it * legitimete * . 
  but not letting these people express their idea , be it right or wrong , would lead to make the people angrier . 
  and there actually is a lot of people wanting to express themselves . 
  let 's do it and really open the debate . 
  thanks , i was to post this video, 
  javi i totally agree with you . 
  i 've read your comments in this thread . 
  as a catalan i feel deep disappointment with how things are turning . 
  i even feel shame . 
  i just feel like one of these days i 'll start calling to random telephone numbers in the rest of spain just to say `` sorry ` bout all this catalan shit dude ... please just do n't think we 're all the same . 
  peace ! '', 
  yes . 
  however , catalonia massively voted for this consitution back in the late 70s . 
  and also , it is difficult in the second decade of the xxi century what a nation is ... 
  i used to sympathise with the separation movement , but i no longer like this nation , or better said , how nationalism is manipulating it . 
  i think most of the spanish population outside catalonia is against separation . 
  some of them because they think we are better united and some of them just because `` this is spain !, 
  end of discussion ! '' . 
  there are also people who may be against independence but agree with the referendum and then there are some people who are just so tired about this shit that they want to separate from catalonia . 
  economically speaking , it would be very bad for both catalonia and spain . 
  actually , all this separation thing is already having bad repercusions specially for catalonia because foreign inversions inside are droping . 
  also , spain is pausing important inversions in catalonia like the mediterranean corridor until this clears up . 
  i will vote no-no . 
  i just hope this referendum puts things on the table and all this shit `` ends '' or at least becomes more clear . 
  it is a ` we do n't talk about this ' kinda deal, 
  i am from catalonia and all my life i used to stand for separation . 
  i had always supported any kind of act for independence , even if i did not 100 % agree with it , thinking al least it was a step towards the idependence and towards creating the debate needed to make the separation happen . 
  well , since a couple of years ago , i 'm no longer pro-separation . 
  ** in the last years , the movement for separation has become stronger , ** specially after the 2011-09-11 pro-separation demonstration ( where i participated ) . 
  ** but stronger does n't mean more solid . 
  ** if the movement has won more people , it 's mostly no-brain stupid people that carry a flag just because it 's mainstream , just as if it was a bar\u00e7a-madrid competition . 
  the main political party in catalonia ( ciu ) , which is right-wing and has never stood for a clear yes or no , has suddenly become pro-separation since that september . 
  it was like `` ok , we have been ambiguous for as long as we could , now we ca n't avoid to be clear . 
  but , separation will only happen if we ( ciu ) are the leaders of this movement '' . 
  and ever since that , it 's been an increasing nationalism everyday . 
  politics , economics and the media in catalunya go quite together since the powefull ones in the three aspects are mostly the same . 
  yes , that means a lot of corruption , but in respect with this issue it has become almost a fascism . 
  all the news in the public television are clearly pro-separation , the newspaper partially owned by people from ciu is given for free in the trains , universities , etc. 
  and so on . 
  but it 's not like ok , we clearly stand for this side , it 's about lies and manipulation of history and news , about not giving equal voice to all political parties , etc. 
  ** neo-fascism ** i would say . 
  they try to spread ( most of the times unfounded ) hate towards the rest of spain , talking shit about them as if they were * the enemy * , as if * all * the responsability of the crisis in catalonia came from * them * . 
  it comes that only a few things can be blamed on the rest of spain , and most of the shit comes from inside catalonia . 
  this obviously pisses spanish people off , and in return they hate us more . 
  it 's a vicious circle . 
  but what surprises me is that spain has ( at leat now ) a lot of arguments to say `` hey catalonia , you 're just doing it wrong . 
  let 's sit and put things clear '' but they have n't done it ( institutionaly ) . 
  my conclusion is that for a long time both catalan and spanish political parties have taken short-term profit ( votes ) from talking shit about the others , making hate grow little by little in both sides . 
  and even now that the situation has become serious , they keep doing that . 
  i strongly think that both sides know that all this is going to end being nothing . 
  the situation is really sad , because meanwhile both mas and rajoy take strong political decisions that cut people 's rights and social status , also doing their corrupt stuff and so . 
  it 's ( almost ) all a big big manipulation and the only thing that gives me a little hope is that i think people are starting to be aware of that . 
  now they put this double-question referendum : ** 1 . 
  do you want catalonia to become a state ? 
  do you want it to be an independent state ? 
  ** what the hell ? 
  how is that supposed to be a ** one ** simple , direct and understandable question ? 
  what does even * independent * state mean ? 
  no state is independent , not even north korea . 
  what if we become a * state * but not an * independent state * ? 
  also , how the hell are the results going to be interpreted ? 
  what i think is that all of them , everybody , knows that all this is just not going to happen . 
  they 've been this ambiguous to gain the needed support of some parties to make the referendum . 
  they say a picture says more than a thousand words . 
  well , [ this ] ( https://scontent-b-mad.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/p480x480/1003572_10152989916652588_209016325_n.jpg ) one reflects how convinced they look about the referendum . 
  i think democracy is not people having power , but people having the power to choose who is in their government . 
  i 've liked the idea of adding the third question : ** 3 . 
  justify your answer . 
  ** ** tl ; dr : ** both spanish and catalan people are under a big manipulation ( actually , under a fight between two big manipulations ) . 
  nationalisms , when they gain power , they can quickly become neo-fascisms .
