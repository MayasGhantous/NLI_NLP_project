it 's funny how people in spain is starting to identify with the creditor and not with the debtor ... 
  i think this is good for rajoy too . 
  2 silver medals in basketball at the olympics games , and some more in euro cups ... 
  if i were greek i would say 2006 basketball world cup semifinals . 
  greece - usa . 
  that was amazing, 
  the ** scots ** did n't lose , only the independentist ones . 
  they have declared themselves against an unilateral declaration of independence very clearly , if that counts . 
  but go ahead , create a new state with these strong roots . 
  they should use a flag with the eagle . 
  i hate how they appropriate of the constitutional flag . 
  not so fast , he cold be dumped now he is surrounded by leftists . 
  you are watching it in this thread . 
  suddenly csqep votes does n't count in either way . 
  they have won , no matter what . 
  votes , seats , whatever . 
  they are a joke . 
  they have already said that they do n't care , they will declare independence . 
  but there is more , the other independentist party is a far left one that have stated that wo n't vote for artur mas for president . 
  lots of drama . 
  reddit is going to love it . 
  exit polls have no other purpose that giving tv stations something to broadcast until there are real results , so they can sell ads until then . 
  they are a waste of time and effort , and a source of frustration . 
  catalonia is split in two halves , it 's dramatic . 
  both camps should be pretty worried . 
  there are n't no parties . 
  who upvotes this ? 
  please , wait to the official results , it 's just a couple of hours, 
  i just want this thing to end , in any way . 
  i used to have an opinion . 
  not anymore . 
  the electoral campaign , with its media overload , has been too much for me . 
  you , dear foreigners , just ca n't imagine how awful it has been . 
  i 'm sure you can smell the bullshit from wherever you are . 
  the flags incident at the barcelona council 's balcony was the last straw . 
  i would like to go far from spain and catalonia , and never look back . 
   we 'll only have a single eu race , where everyone 's iq averages out closer to 100 with far less variance ( i.e. 
  : less geniuses ) , what !? 
  why do you believe that miscegenation ( had to look it up the word ) would decrease the variance of the iq ? 
  probably the last medal for a long time ( may be in rio there is a last chance ) , but one of the sweetest because how unexpected has been . 
  france and greece probably were better teams overall . 
  the final has been a bit disappointing after two epic games , but finals rarely make great games . 
  congrats to the players . 
  some good news at last . 
  directives must be `` implemented '' as national level laws , but regulations and decisions are directly applicable . 
  so , no labourist government in ... may be a decade or so ? 
  i used jaime because i speak spanish and that 's how we call it here in aragon . 
  i should probably have used james and alphonso , but i do n't know why it 's so important or surprising . 
  please , do n't lecture me ( a copy-paste from another thread , btw ) . 
  i know a bit about `` iberian '' history , and the difference about the crown and kingdom of aragon . 
  what you are referring to is when may be speak propperly about the modern state of spain . 
  it 's a simplification but it 's fine . 
  i wo n't dispute it . 
  what i was referring to is before that , some spanish kings ** in medieval times ** wanted to unify spain under a single dinasty , and the concept of state did n't exist by then , but that was the most similar thing they could think of . 
  and that using your strict rules , speaking of catalonia before 1400s is also wrong . 
  specially leridans did n't want to be taken as catalans in a date as late as 1337 . 
  if you are using `` iberian '' as a purely geographical term in contrast to a political `` spanish '' , i would say that is very , very debatable . 
  the concept of a modern state like today 's spain of course was unthinkable in medieval times . 
  but christian medieval kings believed in a united peninsula ( yes the whole thing ) under the rule of a single christian king , like it was in the visigoths era . 
  you can find the term `` espa\u00f1a '' and `` espa\u00f1as '' in writings of such different kings like jaime i of aragon or alfonso x of castile . 
  not to mention that under that rules would n't be appropiate to use the term `` catalan '' in a medieval context . 
  catalans included ... 
  the article says that similar actions have been declared legal by courts of other cities . 
  i wonder how it can be the case , since discriminates banks and real state agencies compared to private owners . 
  i guess a lot of them are going to be sold to private investors . 
  good time to buy a house in barcelona . 
  i think he 's referring to people who gets evicted in a bearish housing market . 
  they will get less money for their property in the court 's ~ ~ bid ~ ~ auction , so their remaining debt will be higher . 
  yes , but only for company level agreements . 
  in bigger scopes , the most representative unions defend the workers ' interests . 
  i think you are wrong . 
  serbia ( 4-0 ) , italy ( 3-1 ) , spain ( 2-2 ) , turkey ( 2-2 ) , germany ( 1-3 ) , iceland ( 0-4 ) . 
  it 's third right now . 
  if wins , at least will keep that position since beated turkey . 
  also , [ see this ] ( http://www.eurobasket2015.org/en/compid_qmrzdyczi6eoanoruf9le2.season_2015.roundid_9322.coid_xggbdcwwjiaxnyk-xthyd2.articlemode_on.html ) edit : it 's the opposite of a formality . 
  it 's a live or die match for spain and germany . 
  * spain 's game against germany is just a formality . 
  if spain loses and turkey wins , spain will be out of the tournament . 
  also in spain . 
  usually the contract the worker signs , includes a reference to the agreement ( * convenio * ) which regulates the job relationship . 
  national agreements can be overriden ( improved ) at a lower level : region , province , or the company itself . 
  cadiz does n't count :-p, 
  i think that the differences are being exaggerated in this thread . 
  the `` educated spanish '' that politicians or tv broadcasters use is pretty similar everywhere . 
  i guess they are just pretending to be americans speaking spanish , to be consistent with the lyrics . 
  they are both colombian iirc . 
  but i think it 's more due to the cultural clash , i guess americans calling to indian call centers will have the same problem . 
  i have heard that some people recommend to call the catalan phone number , and just speak in spanish , since the person at the other will be a spainiard ( no offense ) . 
  hmmm ... how about / r/spanish ? 
  i know you did n't say it explicitely , but sugusino was saying something along the lines ( and later confirmed it ) , and i thought you both were smoking the same . 
  ( it was a joke , or a sarcasm if you prefer . 
  also , the smoking part . ), 
  now i 'm sure you are a troll and just want the catalan independentists to look bad . 
  keep the good work !!, 
  not only the sucession war was against catalonia , also the civil war was . 
  if you do n't agree is because you are a fascist and/or a brainwashed idiot . 
  `` we '' as in the `` spanish republic goverment '' . 
  buf !, 
  ! , i do n't agree with what they are going to pass , but i that 's a bit biased way of explaining it . 
   apparently it was a thing in the civil war because they spoke weird the catalan batallion that fought in the netherlands against the orange 's was called * tercio del papagayo * ( parrot 's batallion ) , because this very exact reason .
