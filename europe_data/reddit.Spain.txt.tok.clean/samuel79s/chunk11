  humans have had that kind of relationship with animals for centuries . 
  but . 
  things have changed a lot in the last 50 year , and even people raised in rural areas do n't live in that kind of environment anymore . 
  even if they own livestock they have it in intensive farms , not adjacent to their homes . 
  that mentality is only alive in older people . 
  also , i find these spectacles way worse than `` normal '' bull fighting . 
  bull fighters are almost sportmen , who have medical resources ready if they get injured and get paid to do what they do . 
  but these `` fiestas '' are at the reach of drunk guys and teenagers . 
  everybody has the right to do something stupid , and not die because of it . 
  it 's just too dangerous . 
   office meetings you may have a point here ... 
  i will call them * ultra agile meetings * , and will try to sell the idea ... 
  i post this to show that bull fighting and bull culture it 's not only a problem because of animal cruelty , but also pretty dangerous . 
  those men were spectators . 
  sometimes i just do n't understand to my fellow countrymen .

  mortgage . 
  in spain , if you bough your house before 31/12/2012 you have a tax deduction of 15 % up to 9000eur/year ** per person ** ( so 18k for a couple ) on amortizations . 
  yes , it 's crazy . 
  one of the reasons of the housing bubble . 
  ok , here we go . 
  i make 35k $ gross . 
  that 's a net 1900eur/month + 2 extra pays a bit lower . 
  my wife is a freelance lawyer . 
  varies a lot but she does on average around 1500 eur ( without extra ) . 
  food : 800-1000 shelter : mortgage 400 + 70 for community of property owners costs . 
  electricity & heating : ~ 120 gas : 50 + internet & mobile : 70eur private healthcare : 180eur . 
  public healthcare does n't covert dental , and its quality has worsened in recent years ( ~ ~ saturated ~ ~ crowded er rooms , long delays for common exams like mri , etc. . . ) school costs : 90eur their school is n't public , though is partially ( mostly ) financed by the state . 
  and for the spainiards , no , it 's not a catholic school . 
  those are the main costs , but you have to add lots of extras for the kids , car costs , etc. . . which probably will add other 300 or more on average . 
  i remember those times . 
  things change with kids ... a lot . 
  selection bias . 
  poor people do n't want to share their misery . 
  i 'm not in the demographic group the op is interested in ( married , 2 kids ... ) , so i wo n't do it neither, 
  i read that the problem in the us is that you need the car to do groceries , so it 's cheaper to buy processed food once a month than buying fresh food every other day . 
  the key word here is ** restructured ** . 
  the headline `` surprisingly '' lost it . 
  * around 70 per cent of restructured mortgage loans are n't being serviced * the original ft 's article ( search * greek public stops paying off personal debts as uncertainty grows * ) makes clear that its referring to mortgages that already defaulted : * `` we restructured it twice , thanks to my old colleagues at the bank but we still could n't keep up with the payments , '' says george , now a struggling investment consultant *, 
   minimum standards and mutual recognition in such matters are enough . 
  that 's the definition of federation or i 'm missing something ? 
  unification does n't mean centralization . 
   there is no shared identity there are some values that are definitely shared by most europeans , distinctive even into the western world . 
  lots of great things can be built over them . 
  well , i do n't agree with most of you say . 
  for the record , i work on it and know some things about the labour laws because i 'm married to a labour lawyer ^ and ^ sometimes ^ i ^ ca n't ^ avoid ^ listening ^ to ^ her . 
  it 's true that `` obra o servicio '' contract is abused , but even if used legitimaly , has a layoff compensation of 8days/year . 
  i would say also that people at our sector do n't sue enough . 
  if you have switched clients , for example , makes pretty easy for a lawyer to prove there was a fraud , and get a better deal on the layoff compensation . 
  regarding this , the last labour reform changed the negotiation field . 
  until then , if a company was declared `` guilty '' in a layoff case , it should pay the salaries up to the date of the ruling of the court ( * salarios de tramitacion * ) . 
  that could be a year or more in the overhelmed courts of big cities !!, 
  there was an incentive on the company to settle soon , which is not true anymore . 
  the reality is that people on it is rarely layed off , they leave way before that . 
  about jobs , there are a lot of shitty ones , and i agree that * all of them * are underpaid . 
  but once you 're not a junior anymore and once you have switched jobs looking for something better you get to the 25k-30k range ( in the big cities ) . 
  not good , but not as bad as the entry level . 
  actually there 's a shortage of good software engineers ( i think this is true in most of the world ) . 
  average deployed code is pretty bad , and most programmers care very little about what they are doing , and rightfully so , since they are so underpaid . 
   sevillanas/flamenco/mexican hats/toros . 
  oh my , here we go again . 
  if you do n't like it why do you sell it in the ramblas ? 
  barretinas do n't sell well ? 
  and , there is a huge andalousian community in barcelona . 
  its `` feria de abril '' is bigger than malaga 's one , and there are probably hundreds of `` tablaos '' in barcelona ... its part of identity you like it or not . 
  do n't go to to inner counties like pened\u00e9s and expect to see those items , but in barcelona and the coast are common , and have been for decades . 
  basques dancing sevillanas ... that 's a show i would pay for . 
  unless you are spanish i guess . 
  when i do , portuguese tend to enter portu\u00f1ol mode almost instantly . 
  i remember one time when a portuguese that had been almost exclusively with spaniards for some days started to speak portu\u00f1ol to a brazilian ... hilarious . 
  spain suddenly lost its appeal for half the tourists ... 
  and that 's why inequality in the us is so high ... 
  in spain you ca n't ** legally ** hire nobody without paid holidays and sick days . 
  and yes , most people think , included myself , that is a sensible thing . 
   and do you have anything to say abou the bull fighting protectionism ? 
  and , as we have already discussed but i see you do n't care , do you have anything to say about them not wanting to condemn any of the responsibles for the francoist crimes ? 
  i have addressed the francoist part extensively , and showed that is false . 
  the bull fighting part , i concede , but i think its a pretty minor issue . 
   holy shit are you naive . 
  of course he wo n't say he is francoist lol . 
  so they are francoist but they hide it ? 
  that 's your point ? 
  really ? 
  it 's fine , i think that any neutral reader has enough information to decide what kind of party is c 's . 
  best regards . 
   centralization has nothing to do with fascism , which i did n't even say . 
  it has to do with being right wing in the social matter , which is what i said . 
   yeah . 
  i 'm sorry , that does n't make any sense . 
  anyway , the abortion/prostitution ... part , do n't you have anything to say ? 
   i remember that at least in less than 6 month there was some sort of votation of that kind on which pp and c 'd both voted no ... 
  i remember it too . 
  but you forgot the part where they were insulted by cup members , who called them fascists , and nuria gispert did n't allowed them to reply , so they left . 
  you ca n't manipulate it as much as you want , but i 'm sure you wo n't find an interview to rivera in which he defends franquism . 
  btw , they have been openly [ threatened by cup members in the parliament ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxqyfkmqa4i ) . 
  it 's easy to find which they position is ... if you want to hear it . 
  you clearly [ are n't talking about ciudadanos regarding fascism ] ( https://www.ciudadanos-cs.org/prensa/ciutadans_cs_condena_el_fascismo_en_una_propuesta_del_parlament/6255/ ) . 
  they also argue for federalizing spain , but not in an asymmetric way and keeping fiscal transfers ( of course ) . 
  also , centralism has nothing to do with fascism .
