  yes it 's unfair , but almost nobody wanted to reform it in 2004-2007 . 
  when things were going well , i assure you that talking to people about a housing bubble and the mortgage law was like preaching in the desert . 
  people literally laughed at me . 
  also , 200k is n't the same for the average spainiard than for the average finnish . 
  income , unemployment levels are very different . 
  and after all , it was riskier than it seemed . 
  look at bank 's deliquency rates and how some banks ( cajas ) had to be bailed out . 
  currency not coin . 
  for non-spainiards , one of her proposals is to create a currency for barcelona . 
  yes , really !!!, 
  i 'm being serious . 
  on the other hand , i 'm interested in crypto currencys ... it could be the first one `` real '' experiment . 
  how cool is that ? 
  very true . 
  ada colau is a leftist activist who could be called `` radical '' . 
  she has fought mainly against foreclosures . 
  her organization supports ( presumably ) homeless people who illegally occupies houses whose property is held by banks or public institutions , and her organization organizes and advices people about how to occupy that houses . 
  she also tried to pass a law that retroactively changed the mortage law . 
  in spain , if you ca n't pay a mortage , a court takes your home and sells it in an auction . 
  if the bid is n't high enough to cover the principal of the debt , you still owe money to the bank . 
  also , if the auction has n't any bids , the bank may get the house at 50 % ( or 60 % ? ), 
  of their ** current ** valuation . 
  is n't a fair law for sure , but you ca n't change the rules mid-game . 
  mortage interest rates have been very low just because of this law . 
  juridical security is n't optional , but a basis of democracy . 
  i respect her ~ ~ work ~ ~ good intentions but i think that the end does n't justify the means , while probably she thinks otherwise . 
  on the other hand , manuela carmena has been a well respected judge , who has reached the ~ ~ supreme court ~ ~ general council of the judiciary , and fought against the dictatorship in the 60 's and 70 's . 
  she 's intellectually brilliant , and after retiring she has started some initiatives like a non-profit which hires ex-convicts to help them to reintegrate into society . 
  i think that is outrageus to compare them , they are n't in the same league . 
  just my opinion . 
  i like this [ one ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/cataluna/2015/05/11/55509c3c268e3e5a698b4573.html ), 
  she was communist in the 60 's and 70 's when the communists where the ones who fought against the dictatorship . 
  judges ca n't join parties in spain so she has been out of them for nearly 40 years ... 
  no , pp ( conservatives ) is still the most voted party and psoe ( socialdemocrats ) is the second one . 
  the new parties are going to win some big cities , but with moderate percentages ( ~ 30 % ) . 
   both barcelona and madrid will most probably have two new mayors from independent candidatures also zaragoza ( 650k inhab . ), 
  the problem is that at 25 % of unemployment , some of those rights are n't enforced , and jobs go directly to the submerged economy where the worker is completely unprotected . 
  i think there 's room for reasonable labour market reforms . 
  i 'm not an expert , though . 
  that 's the theory but as you surely know , councils routinely vote on affairs out of their competence , as condemning franquism or rejecting the last education law . 
  they have zero real effect but are used as an electoral weapon . 
  at some point , some party it 's going to force the council to take a side with one of those declarations . 
  or the generalitat is going to ask something to the council to support `` the process '' . 
  or the guardia urbana ( the local police ) is going to make an estimation of a protest that does n't match what the organizers claimed ... 
  in either way , something will happen that will be read as taking sides . 
  i guess barcelona en com\u00fa is n't positioned regarding separatist affairs , is it ? 
  ( sorry di n't know how to phrase it , but i think it 's understandable ) . 
  i do n't see how that it 's going to work . 
  at some point of the future they are going to be challenged in that matter , and the coallition could fall apart . 
  i think that 's more important that it seems : the battle between podemos or ciudadanos for third . 
  lot of people who just want a new party ruling the country ( elections in november ) , will follow the party most likely to win , and that 's going to be signaled in this elections . 
  it 's a feedback loop that just made ciudadanos crush upyd . 
  i expect a big boost for the winner of the two in the polls . 
  huh ? 
  of course there are polling booths . 
  i 've seen people to take ballots of a lot of different parties and go to the polling booth to put just one of them into the envelope . 
  i think it 's just in case there are n't ballots of the party you want to vote inside the booth . 
  but , are you serious ? 
  you ca n't just take the ballots from the table in the basque country ? 
  my bet is that they will be 4th force , not third . 
  it will be hard to know exactly , since they do n't use their name for the councils , and not all regions choose their governments . 
  ciudadanos it 's gon na make the headlines tomorrow . 
  remember , it 's a bet . 
  edit : i would have lost my bet . 
  podemos it 's way stronger overall . 
  fernando , isabel , i doubt that english guy it 's good enough for your daughter catherine , and his brother henry is way worse . 
  do n't marry her with any of them . 
  and oh , btw , columbus it 's fucking crazy , do n't finance his travel . 
  and let alone the jews . 
  and that thing , the inquisition , is n't a great idea ... 
  i 'm that guy , thinking `` a single vote is insignificant ... it 's way below the margin of error ... no election has been decided for a single vote ... '' at the end , i always go . 
  * catalonia lost part of its status in 1714 * for our foreign friends , i think that 's important to emphasize that that was n't something that affected only to catalonia . 
  aragon , valencia and the balears also lost ** most ** ( not all ) of their privileges , institutions and some laws . 
  the basques retained theirs , because switched to the winner side at time ( lucky them ) . 
  it had some upsides too , since until then only castilians were allowed to trade with american colonies . 
  in those regions , and i would say that also in catalonia until very recently , there is no animosity towards castile or the borbons for these events , which are seen just as shit that happened centuries ago , such as when ferdinand vii derogated the liberal constitution of 1812 ... 
   the most democratic solution is to ~ ~ respect ~ ~ reform the constitution ftfy . 
  there would be more solutions , even without reforming the constitution . 
  a state-wide non-abiding referendum on the issue could be done , so we would know the opinion of catalonia itself , and the rest of the country . 
  it 's true that at the end , everything depends on what do you think the sovereignity resides . 
  at the current state level ? 
  at the region level ? 
  at the province ? 
  etc. . . that 's why long ago i draw the conclussion that any level is as good or bad as any other , as long respects the rights of the individuals , provides juridical security and seeks social justice . 
  they would n't call themselves `` spanish '' , but the cup is pretty leftist imho ... 
  it 's not an university , it 's a school , with only 120 pc 's . 
  nothing to see here . 
  it 's hard to choose , but for me it 's the [ constitution of 1812 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_constitution_of_1812 ) , which marked what spain could have been , but at the end it was n't . 
  it was a very liberal constitution , which reduced the power of the crown and the church , and granted equal rights to spainiards and colonies residents ( indigenous and criollos ) . 
  spain could have become a modern state , and not the shithole that was during the xix and part of the xx , but obviously it was n't of the liking of an absolutist king , fernando vii , who derogated it as soon as he could . 
  he 's called `` the felon king '' for a reason . 
  it 's not swept under the rug . 
  it is ( was ) way worse . 
  that period it 's called the reconquista ( 700 years no less ) , and until the democracy the focus was put on how the christian kings battled the moors in a sort of crusade , until the whole peninsula was free of muslims . 
  nowadays the story is taught very differently . 
  the reality was very messy since christians and muslims were racially identical ( basically people were incentivated or plainly forced to convert when their town was conquered ) and cross religion alliances were n't rare ( muslims and christians fighting other christians or muslims together ) . 
  the story of muslim kingdoms ( taifas ) it 's also taught , but may be not as profoundly as the story of christian ones ( blame nationalism for that ) . 
  something similiar happens with the spanish war of independence against napoleon . 
  the french as a invasion force had their issues but also brought the revolution ideals , which lots of intellectuals supported . 
  at the end , they were way better than that motherfucker of fernando vii .
