  this was first proposed by the psoe long time ago and for some reason they did n't implement it . 
  probably because has its drawbacks , too . 
  probably they were more `` prudent '' before the law was passed and declared constitutional ( which was n't clear-cut ) . 
  * http://www.elmundo.es/encuentros/invitados/2008/02/2902/ they are politicians after all . 
  and while podemos show signs of stagnation they are still growing in the polls ... 
  * * we support it , because nobody has n't still explained why calling it marriage should be a problem for the rest of the citizens . 
  * before the dawn * by nicholas wade . 
  i became interested on human evolution , specially non sapiens species , since i read * a brief history of humankind * by noah harari , which i strongly recommend . 
  i do n't understand why everyone accepts immediately that his schoolmates have seen the execution part . 
  his face has been on the news , so they do n't need to watch it in full to recognize him . 
  ciudadanos/ciutadans is n't a new party . 
  it was born in 2006 , claiming for regeneration , well before the economic crisis , which should speak in their favor . 
  they have a young and brilliant leader , a realizable economic program , are catalan but strive for spain ... but they lack of structure outside catalonia , which will be probably their achilles heel . 
  anyway , i 'll vote them . 
  is this still a popular opinion in france ? 
  reminds me the famous quote '' europe ends at the pyrinees '' . 
  * * it is an error of geography to have assigned spain to europe ; it belongs to africa : blood , manners , language , the way of life and making war , in spain everything is african . 
  the two nations have been mixed up for too long -- the carthaginians who came from africa to spain , the vandals who left spain for africa , the moors who stayed in spain for 700 years -- for such a long cohabitation not to have confused the race and customs of the two countries . 
  if the spaniard were mohammedan , he would be completely african ; it is religion that has kept it in europe . 
  * the general court states that , if the ecb were to consider that that power is necessary for proper performance of the task referred to , it would be for the ecb , acting on the basis of article 129 ( 3 ) of the feu treaty , to request the eu legislature to amend article 22 of the statute , by the addition of an explicit reference to securities clearing . 
  * i have read that this modification of the treaties does n't need unanimity so , it 's in the hands of the eurozone members to force this policy . 
  also opel in zaragoza ... 
  not with pre downloaded maps , but yeah , the point was clear enough . 
   ** wtf ** is wrong with the south of spain / facepalm underground employment , i guess . 
  massive screwup . 
  first a dog census is made , where each owner provides some genetic sample of his pet . 
  the dna of this sample is sequenced and stored in a database . 
  once this database is complete , some council workers take the poo from the streets and analyze it . 
  if there is a match with any of the previously sequenced samples , the dog 's owner is fined . 
   are being brought down one by one . 
  pure posturing . 
  they ca n't by effectively derogated until there is a new government ( whatever it is ) . 
  i do n't know if you understand how limited the options are . 
  imagine that the labourists were in fact two parties , one leaded by corbyn and the other by miliband , and the options were : * miliband supporting cameron * miliband being supported by corbyn ** and the snp ** ( clegg is irrelevant in this universe ~ ~ also ~ ~ too ) . 
  now multiply the animosity between parties by 100x and you will be close to understand what the problem is . 
  he is the skinniest no doubt about it ... but man , he is from vallecas !, 
  i 'm sure he has seen some shit ... 
  i imagine him puking the tequila over sanchez and lighting him with a zippo . 
  then he would make one of his corny metaphors as * we have just fired the torch of change * or something like that . 
  there is no choice . 
  the constitution states that there must be new elections two months after the first attempt of choosing a prime minister if none of the subsequent attempts is successful . 
  my money is on iglesias !, 
  no , they do n't . 
  that 's the problem , probably the outcome will be similar and some leaders have already burnt some bridges ... 
  do n't feed the troll . 
  if is a good deterrent it may work ... as it seems , jativa has implemented the system and works . 
  in spain 's case , i 'm greatly surprised is not * flamenco * , * bullfighting * or something like that . 
  i 'm glad things have changed , and have changed so much that a ( i guess ) young basque like you find unbelievable that there was no ethnic component in eta violence and in basque society in general . 
  but there was , and not 100 years ago . 
  it 's easy to find references if you look for them [ 1 ] ( http://www.dialogosdelduero.com/2012/11/de-charnegos-maketos-y-coreanos-ii-de-ii.html ) , [ 2 ] ( http://jo-ta-ke.blogspot.com.es/2007/03/belarrimotzas-maketos-y-manchurianos.html ) ... 
  * there are dozens of testimonies like this . 
  i do n't think it has any sense to continue with this thread we are not going anywhere . 
   you 're mixing up things . 
  no i 'm not . 
  eta and some basque nationalists consider that only basque nationalists are true basques . 
  moreso if they were n't of true basque origin . 
  you also have flirted with this idea , not long ago , while arguing with / u/rc72 , when you stated that the aguirre 's , etc. . who flew from the basque country because eta threats where spanish who happened to be born in the basque country . 
  again , more proof : the official symbols of euskadi ( hymn , etc. . . ) are intrisically nationalists and were not chosen by unanimity . 
  so yes , eta and its surroundings targeted preferently who they considered invaders . 
   the `` us '' in `` they killed one of us '' usually referred to the status of the person as a basque nationalist , not as a basque overall . 
  as i said previously , there is no distintion between a basque or a basque nationalist for some people . 
   ( pnv , ea ) tolerated , and some sections even actively supported , eta up until the mid-1990s . 
  whoa . 
  if someone dared to say this during the 90 's ( which i happen to remember perfectly ) the response of those parties would have been complete outrage . 
  but it 's true that some portions of those parties had zero empathy for victims who were n't basque under their very own definition . 
  oh , it was a key factor for sure . 
  and the proof is that a part of the basque society reacted very differently those rare times when eta killed a pnv member . 
  for them was `` killed one of us '' this time . 
  lots of those victims were considered spanish who happened to be born in the basque country or just foreigners because were immigrants or children of a immigrant couple . 
  if you challenge yourself out of your comfort zone you probably will change your mind . 
  btw , [ found a reference of ethnic insults in the 80 's ] ( http://blogs.elconfidencial.com/espana/notebook/2009-04-29/el-insulto-racista-en-euskadi-lopez-mas-que-lopez_406145/ ) . 
  that 's not true . 
  that word was common at the very least until the 60 's and 70 's . 
  and the basque nationalism has been far from open-minded and welcoming . 
  i should n't have to argue too much in this regard to anyone who knows recent spanish history ... not unlike spanish nationalism really . 
  your comment is a good example of nationalism ... and no it 's not a compliment . 
  you are pretty acritical towards how the basque society has handled immigration . 
  the word * maketo * is the pejorative way to refer to castilian immigrants and you know perfectly well that the first basque nationalist was outright racist and catholic fundamentalist . 
  so no , not always the basque nation has been so tolerant . 
  this should n't be a problem for you as individual , if you personally are open-minded and tolerant . 
  but at the moment in which you believe that there is some kind of unbreakable link between you and that people from 80 years ago , they become your people and write a comment so self indulgent as the one you just wrote . 
  the whole concept of nation is a bit backwards in this place and age . 
  nationalism was understandable in the xixth century , where people of an area could identify with certain customs , and essentially everyone had access to the same reads , the same art expressions , etc. . . 
  this is n't true anymore . 
  we as westerners already share a good deal of cultural references ( thanks to hollywood ) and our children will do even more . 
  it 's a good thing that our states pivot over a concept of citizenship completely detached of race , origins or religion . 
  modern nationalisms also claim to not share those parameters but they have exchanged them by simple adherence to the nation itself , which is n't a lot better ; is still a way to draw a line between them and us . 
  it makes me sick when politicians allude to nations as something concrete , durable and eternal . 
  no , nations does n't even exist nor they are a sort of supernatural beings . 
  they are human constructs that served a purpose , like tribes , and hopefully in some centuries they will be seen also as a backwards thing . 
  it was in the front page yesterday . 
  this has been said several times in reddit in the last days , but i will repeat it nonetheless . 
  it 's the same date , but not the same day . 
  spain was using the new gregorian calendar , while england used the julian one . 
  they were n't very fond of the pope because ... reasons . 
  i have n't seen the movie , but yes , is the same aguirre . 
  there is also a spanish movie about him : * el dorado * . 
  i read it after a couple a failed attempts , and understood what the fuss was about . 
  it 's absolutely hilarious . 
  a complete mad , cruel and bloodthirsty conqueror ... ( which btw is completely unrelated to cervantes ) .
