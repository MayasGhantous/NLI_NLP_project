   what 's the problem with that ? 
  sounds like they were stopped from entering illegally . 
  it could be against refugee laws . 
  * spain has been heavily criticized by a number of international institutions and organizations for its longstanding practice of push backs and for the recent implementation of a new law which seeks to legalize them . 
  spanish interior minister fern\u00e1ndez d\u00edas has continued to assert that push backs are legal and do not breach national or human rights law . 
  the applicants ' spanish lawyer , gonzalo boye , added : `` any ruling that push backs are in violation of the applicants ' rights under the european convention on human rights would imply that spain 's new law on collective expulsions itself is incompatible with the convention and should be amended . 
  '' * [ source ] ( http://www.statewatch.org/news/2015/aug/echr-hot-returns.html )  is this at ceuta / melilla ? 
  yes . 
   today in spain energy self-generation is illegal . 
  `` only '' if you connect it to the grid and do n't pay the associated taxes . 
  imho the worst that he has done is [ this ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-23/spain-power-auction-pricing-may-put-economy-at-risk ) . 
  designing a shitty auction system and cancelling it because * atypical circumstances * without any proof marks a whole new level of incompetence . 
   they 're illegal but ca n't be deported ? 
  the thing is that they are n't deported . 
  they cross the fence and they are intercepted before a second one , and returned to morocco immediately without being identified even . 
  whoa , stop reediting you response i have to start from scratch each time ;-)  you think the constitution should stay as it is ? 
  the judiciary needs reform , and the monarchy have shown themselves to be every bit as corrupt as the pp . 
  no , i think it needs some changes , but iirc only the election of the constitutional court is sealed by the constitution and the rest of the reforms needed can be done just by normal or organic laws . 
  there 's lot of room for improvement without touching a comma of the constitution . 
   not to mention the `` anti-separatist '' elements of the constitution . 
  that does n't have any relation with the topic , but i think that most constitutions have strong territorial integrity clauses . 
   can those change without a new constitution ? 
  definitely !!, 
  it 's much more simple . 
  if corruption would mean the ellectoral death of a party , politicians would fix the thing by themselves . 
  an ethically exigent society is all what 's needed . 
  i think we are giving steps in that direction , `` thanks '' to the crisis , but not fast enough . 
   can you refute the allegations by the newspapers i linked to ? 
  i wo n't refute it , but i will put them in context . 
  in podemos case , no one has been still charged with anything . 
  assuming that that money was used to create podemos is a huge assumption , and a lot more of evidence is needed to be able to say that the current party is somehow a result of that money . 
  it 's not even very politically relevant since podemos founders have never hided their symphaties towards chavism . 
  i would n't touch a podemos ballot with a ten foot pole due to that , but they have been pretty open about it . 
  monedero did avoid taxes , but immediately resigned from its attributions in the party ( he was n't even an elected official ) and did so before being charged with a crime . 
  jordi ca\u00f1as was charged for fiscal crime , again not for a political corruption case , and immediately resigned from his seat in the catalan parliament . 
  he has been hired by the party , but while i think that , if he 's declared guilty ( the case is still on trial ) , he deserves his political death , i do n't think that he deserves also his civil and professional death . 
  i see a big difference between these cases and the other ones . 
   spain needs to get rid of franco 's constitution and monarchy , and start clean . 
  yeah , everything is the constitution fault . 
  that does n't make any sense . 
  it 's curious because i agree with you in that corruption may be considered as systemic since the system allows , or has allowed , to flourish it for a long time . 
  but i do n't buy your arguments . 
  there are orders of magnitude of difference between the established parties and the new parties ' corruption , and those new parties are fighting hard for changing the rules by proposing very concrete measures ( end of politicians immunity , internal democracy , etc. . . ) even psoe has been clearly forced to jump into the bandwagon given that their ellectorate seems much less forgiving about the issue . 
  if you refer to the scene around 1:30 , he disappears from sight so i assumed that he was looking for the parents in the nearby houses . 
  it was a genuine question since this incident reminded me about [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4d20te/the_seat_arrangements_in_the_european_parliaments/d1n6iuy ) from a couple weeks ago . 
  is this a common ocurrence in the british parliament ? 
   do you think you guys will get a stable gov ` t ? 
  that 's the million dollar question . 
  the polls shows psoe ( social-dem ) and pp ( conservatives ) stationary , ciudadanos ( liberals ) going up and podemos ( left ) going down significativelly . 
  but three months before the elections are n't very trustable . 
   who do you think will win ? 
  win as in `` the most voted '' pp . 
  win as in forming government , i do n't know . 
  if latest polls are right , the most probable outcomes are : * pp+c 's if and only if rajoy steps down . 
  * psoe+c 's if rajoy does n't want to resign . 
  they will only have 140/350 seats but podemos will have no choice than support that government because the alternative is a pp government . 
   who ( if anyone ) are you rooting for ? 
  they propose some really needed reforms , like removing an administrative level ( the province ) that 's an old and expensive vestige of the past when spain did n't have autonomous regions ( almost states of a federal system ) , without throwing the economy out of the window . 
  i prefer the coalition with psoe by far , though . 
  spain . 
  lot 's of posturing , but no new government . 
  new elections in sight . 
  well , top usa universities also had [ similar schemes in place ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/the-ivy-leagues-history-of-discriminating-against-jews-2014-12 ) . 
  not a problem in spain , eh ? 
  expelling them in 1492 saved us of lot of trouble ... / s, 
  this reminds me of [ this story ] ( http://www.ruthfullyyours.com/2012/10/04/the-fifth-problem-math-anti-semitism-in-the-soviet-union-edward-frenkel/ ) , which explains how jews were discriminated when applied to certain soviet universities . 
  there was even a kind of math problems called `` jewish problems '' , which are pretty hard but have seemingly easy answers which were used to dismiss jewish applicants . 
  i do n't think he 's referring to that . 
  of course they have their right to get their unemployment payments , but that subsidies have some requirements , like residing in spain ( you need to ask for permission if you want to do even a small trip ) . 
  there is a myth about people collecting their spanish unemployment while living in romania ( or other countries ) , which is a fraud . 
  as i said before , i do n't even know if it 's easily doable since i think you have to seal your papers in the unemployment office at least once a month . 
  this really happens ? 
  do n't you have to go to the unemployment office physically at least once a month ? 
  or it can be done by internet ? 
  fair enough , but you should announce your intentions now , not when she gets pregnant . 
  i say this because it could change her willingness to have a baby with you . 
  dunno why you are being so massively downvoted . 
  you are bringing up valid points . 
   also people do n't go to jail for vandalism . 
  but there is no reason to think that the guilty parties wont be punished . 
  french police could certainly try to avoid this situations and as it seems is n't doing anything . 
  if nobody is identified by police , how is going to be punished or fined ? 
  moreover , it should be considered vandalism only if the truck is parked in that moment . 
  if they intercept it by intimidating the driver , i 'm sure that more severe criminal offenses could be in play here . 
  the article argues that this is a surprising outcome , and that expected figures were around 10 % . 
  also , that this is a novel study . 
  it is n't new or unexpected . 
  i remember have read in `` before the dawn '' about the rate of `` non-paternity events '' , and it was a pretty low value ( well , if 2 % is high or low is still debatable . 
  also , [ this article from 2010 ] ( http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/06/the-paternity-myth-the-rarity-of-cuckoldry/#.vwx4aywhpqe ) already debunks the  10 % myth , which probably comes from the data gathered from fathers who ask for a paterntity test . 
  this is biased data obviously , since does n't represent a random sample of the population but conditioned by fathers who already suspect not being the biological father . 
  so , not news . 
  good . 
  how many refugees is going to accept the vatican ? 
  she 's from a pretty wealthy family so may be she is not a just a figurehead [ * ] like many other wifes . 
  [ \\* \\ ] dunno if this translates exactly to the spanish word * testaferro *, 
  something is pretty fucked up when you ca n't tell what 's satire and what is n't . 
  i ca n't find it right now , but not long ago , i read an article ( in spanish ) that argued that socialdemocracy was dying because its own success . 
  part of their former distinctive reivindications : universal healthcare , retirement pensions , abortion rights , etc. . . were already so widely accepted , at least publicily , by right-wing conservatives , that they could n't distinguish themselves anymore from them , and so the upper and middle-class votes were going to liberal parties while the lower was resorting to more radical left parties . 
   source : had sex with a 24 year old girl when i was 14 and googled it . 
  you were awaiting a thread like this to brag about it , eh ... ?
