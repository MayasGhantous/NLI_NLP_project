  this was in the 1600s ... some things never change . 
  how is possible numerically ? 
  because spanish electoral law is n't proportional . 
  because applies the d'hondt law per ellectoral circunscription . 
  because every circunscription ( the province ) has a different `` potential voters per seat '' ratio , and may have a different % of participation . 
  independentism is strong in the rural areas ( or less urban if you wish ) . 
  for example : * barcelona . 
  85 seats . 
  voters in the last elections 2.7 m =  31kvotes/seat * girona . 
  17 seats . 
  voters : 350k =  20kvotes/seat . 
  look at publico 's poll 73/135 seats with 48.8 % of votes . 
  who needs tanks having banks ? 
  that 's one possibility . 
  the thing is that a court has to declare it ( i do n't know which , but one int madrid ) , and the police has to arrest them . 
  there are multiple police forces in catalonia , but the main one depends from the catalan goverment ( but must follow the court 's orders , obviously ) . 
  my opinion , but it 's biased , is that the thing would go like this : 1 . 
  seize catalan goverment funds . 
  there 's no step 2 . 
   independence will be declared if and only if they get over 50 % of the votes . 
  no , no and no . 
  read / u/mate77 posts . 
  * they plan to declare independence with a majority of seats , even if it 's less than the 50 % of votes . 
  * you are welcome . 
  no , fortunatelly there 's not an armed milita or anything like that . 
  it would be more like a chess game , in which both goverments will promulge laws and decrees , and will expect that the civil servants and citizens ( police , courts and financial institutions specially ) , will follow them . 
  the chaos , but without blood in the streets . 
  at least a good argument in this thread :-), 
   i try not to use any insults or anything of that sort , try harder  `` 50 % of the votes '' . 
  and since you directly contradicted the facts of the reality i said less that 50 % of the ** votes ** , and it 's factually correct . 
  the publico one gives 48,8 % to independentism , and the lower end of the interval at the other poll does it too . 
  your answer is needlessly offensive , and you should retire it ( for your own good , says more about you than about me ) . 
  if you still want to discuss civilly about the issue , i gave my opinion to / u/mate77, 
  well , i would n't call it huge . 
  ciu party has got similar results alone , and that 's a coalition of the two biggest ones right now , plus the cup and a dozen of smaller ones . 
  but anyway , president mas is cheating at its own game . 
  if these elections are a sort of plebiscite , you must count votes , not seats . 
  dhond ' t law and the unequal proportions of votes per seat in the different provinces are distorting the result . 
  you ca n't have your cake and eat it too . 
  but , hey , any end to this madness will be fine . 
  the last three years of media overload with this issue have been enough . 
  if they manage to get the independence with less than the 50 % of the votes as those polls say , it will be an amazing feat , certainly . 
  edit : some people have n't undestood what i mean . 
  those polls show that is probable for jxsi to get a ** majority of seats without a majority of votes ** . 
  citing myself below : * how is possible numerically ?

  * * because applies the d'hondt law per ellectoral circunscription .

  that 's cheating . 
  i think best compromise between economy and weather is in northern italy or south east france . 
  i would go for italy . 
  thank you . 
  in mobile seemed ok . 
  while i acknowledge that nation may be used in that sense ( my country is full of nationalists without state ) , `` nationality '' is rarely so . 
  and in this context , would make no sense , since he is referring explicitely to a `` having a paper ( = passport ) '' as proof for `` nationality '' ( = citizenship of a state ) . 
  and what 's your alternative ? 
  return to the times in which you had to claim to have an [ `` old christian '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_christian ) lineage ? 
  i feel sorrow for these people , if really exists . 
  it surprising that so much people ( 40 % now ) openly declare themselves to be on the right of the political spectrum . 
  in spain would be unthinkable , almost nobody does that . 
  if you define yourself as a centrist , or declare that political left-right divide is now meaningless/too simplistic , is because you are on the right , just ashamed to admit it . 
  i 'm a centrist ( now , draw your own conclusions ;-) . 
  more specifically , a [ social liberalist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_liberalism ) . 
  and your point is ... 
   how often are you on reddit in an average week ? 
  depends on work load , but usually everyday , at least 2 or 3 times . 
   how often do you visit / r/europe ? 
  i do n't really visit reddit itself . 
  i first go to the / r/europe first , then check others subreddits , front page , etc. . if i have the time . 
  if i were a mod , i would probably spend near 100 % of my reddit time in this sub . 
   what country are you normally resident in ? 
  spain  do you speak any languages besides english ? 
  ( if yes : which and to what level ? ), 
  spanish , native level . 
   what interests you about europe ? 
  about the eu , specifically , i like the concept of a transnational federation , in which differences are respected but , at the same time , tries to level the rights and standards of living of all its citizens . 
  i consider myself , or try to be , a post-nationalist , so the eu is the political framework that i like the most , since is based in citizenship and not on nationality . 
   what are your favourite and least favourite things about / r/europe ? 
  the least : the endless immigration threads , i try to avoid them . 
  the most : having the opportunity to get to know about news that go almost unnoticed by spanish media , like the nazi train or the eslovenian frontier guard sentenced to 15yrs in russia . 
   do you have experience as a moderator or similar ? 
   why do you want to be a moderator ? 
  i 'm not sure . 
  i just want to help because i like the sub , but i would n't do it if it was n't a shortage of good moderators . 
   why do you think you would be a good moderator ? 
  because i do n't really want to be one , just i 'm offering myself because of civism ? 
   do you have any expirence with statistics , datamining or reddit bots ? 
  yes . 
  i 'm somewhat proficient in `` numerical '' python ( pandas , ipython , numpy , matplotlib ... ) . 
  i have done some r courses and read some books , but since i do n't work with it daily i have forgotten most of it . 
   what is your opinion on the immigration megathread ? 
  what do you think went wrong ( if anything ) ? 
  i do n't know , i try to avoid that threads .
