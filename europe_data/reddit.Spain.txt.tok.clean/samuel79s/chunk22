  that 's all i can say without resorting to wikipedia . 
  opportunity cost . 
  40km $ spent in high speed railroads , are 40km $ not spent in roads , hospitals , etc. . . 
  there is consensus among the economists that spanish high speed infraestructure makes no sense , even adding all the externalities , and being generous when estimating them . 
  excuse my ignorance , is the same sinn fein than the northern ireland one ? 
  compared to anything bar airports with no planes . 
  amancio not amanico . 
  spanish high speed trains are an horrible investment . 
  when he says expensive , he is n't referring to the price of the tickets . 
  this opinion of yours is in withdrawal in spain , where the trendy thing is to criticize that period . 
  ahem ... ireland is still here . 
  out of the graph ... [ relevant xkcd ] ( https://xkcd.com/435/ ), 
  whoa !, 
  i wrote my comment without reading yours . 
  i could have saved time just linking to it . 
  it 's not a sovietic trait , though . 
  only one ? 
  i wish i could change first the willingness to game the system and to take the biggest possible advantage in every situation . 
  people here think that they are entitled to everything without giving anything in return , and effort is not something that is encouraged or praised enough . 
  the general mentality is this : if a taxpayer can evade taxes , he probably will . 
  if a bussinesman can pay below minimum wage , he probably will . 
  if someone can jump a queue because he knows a civil servant who happen to work there , he probably will ... 
  but at the same time , everyone wants free universal healthcare ( with drugs heavily subsidized ) , generous unemployment payments and pensions , fair services , etc. . . 
  there is some people who think that the rampant corruption of recent years has been performed by a * caste * of politicians , who were detached from the real people . 
  there is an alternative explanation whihch is far more frightening : our politicians are , in fact , a representative sample of the spanish people . 
  mostly the same ( hardly anything ) . 
  they ask for 15 ministries ** in total ** , instead of the current 12 . 
  and they want for themselves a half of them . 
  well , right now his opinion is n't more qualified than anyone else 's one . 
  it 's completely out of his hands . 
  elections in summer ... 
  i wonder how this will affect the turnout . 
  i ca n't find any about this in main spanish online newspapers . 
  shame . 
  not all arm chips are designed by arm , though ( most probably are n't ) . 
  its [ business model ] ( http://www.anandtech.com/show/7112/the-arm-diaries-part-1-how-arms-business-model-works ) its pretty interesting and includes complete designs ( ready to be implemented in silicon ) , partial designs ( excluding the lower level ) and just licenses to make arm compatible designs so can run the same software , but with a design developed completely without any arm intervention . 
  this does n't diminish at all arm 's merit , on the contrary . 
  i do n't see the point of presidents of the republic in those countries where they have so much limited power . 
  i understand how parliamentary monarchies have evolved by removing rights from the king one by one without pulling down him completely , but , once you got rid of monarchs , what 's the point ? 
  the american system make a lot more sense , imo , and avoids deadlocks like the one we are suffering now in spain ( i know the congress still may block government initiatives , but still ) . 
  lucky you , but a currency best trait should n't be to act as an investment . 
  it would be much more impressing if you have said that you had performed a significant amount of your purchases using bitcoin . 
  you guessed wrong ( because your prejudices i guess ) . 
  ciudadanos supports the removal as the psoe does , just want it done with some sensitiveness and competence . 
  you can ask for it to the mods . 
  they guy is [ in the street already ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/baleares/2016/02/12/56bd0452ca47416d6f8b45cf.html ) . 
  i have no words , i am as baffled as you all . 
   why the allies did n't liberate spain like they did with other countries ? 
  well , not only that . 
  the uk and france favoured franco at the start of the war , and the non-intervention committee was a joke . 
  the embargo was only enforced on the republic , while italy and germany were sending troops and material in droves to the sublevated forces . 
  only the ussr send some help to the republic ( and may be mexico ? 
  ) , but only after getting the spanish treasure as a deposit ... 
  it 's pretty dull . 
  it 's near to the escorial so if you go there it may deserve a quick visit , but other than that is completely skippable . 
  it 's way more complex than that . 
  for example , alava and navarre kept their fiscal autonomy since those provinces supported franco . 
  also the carlists batallion of [ requetes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/requet%c3%a9s ) had a key role in the sublevated side , as others have pointed out . 
  edit : i recommend you [ this book ] ( http://www.amazon.com/spanish-republic-civil-war-1931-1939/dp/0691007578 ) , if you are truly interested on having a balanced view on the republic , and the spanish civil war . 
  hmmm ... the new spanish government is probably going to ask for some debt relief ... may be is n't that good idea , is it ? 
  the sad part is those guys are probably some idiots who now are going to be seen as martyrs of free speech , something they definitely do n't deserve ( as they do n't deserve to be jailed , too ) . 
  they have spread their message more than they would have ever imagined . 
  i do n't like their anarchist message at all , and their lack of common sense ( if you see most of your public are kids and your show is n't for them , warn the parents instead of blindly go on ) but i 'm forced to stand with them because of this disproportionated action of a sole judge . 
   the jail is basically for the `` gora alka-eta '' part which i still do n't understand the context . 
  the cop puts the banner and use it as fake evidence to incriminate the witch ... 
  it worked really well , the fiction ended having effects in the real world as in woody allen 's `` the purple rose of cairo '' . 
   this just reinforces my view that especially at the municipal level ideology really is n't anywhere near as important as basic competence . 
  i agree . 
  i would plainly forbid any motion or proposal which is n't directly related to the city or town . 
  spanish city councils routinely vote on issues so important for their citizens as the legitimacy of israeli settlements or strikes which occur on companies which do n't even have presence on the city . 
   the programme advised people that it was n't a children 's show . 
  here lies the problem . 
  as it seems , it was initially publicised as such , and it was only changed to `` not suitable for children '' an hour before the show . 
  something that was also unknown for council execs , who reported the incident to the police ( it was n't a civil lawsuit as you said ) . 
  but , yeah , its quite unbelievable that they have ended in preventive prision for this ( what they could do which constitutes a immediate risk , broadcast the show on youtube or something ? ) . 
  this certainly eclipses what was a huge misunderstanding , product of a mismanagement . 
  edit : btw , great summary . 
  it was my preferred option before the elections , but they are short of at least 20 seats or so . 
  just ca n't work . 
  if anything , it may get both a bit of good pr for the next elections . 
  i guess you have met a hardly representative sample of spainiards , specially if you used the term * social-democrats * . 
  or may be just wants to put pp and podemos in the situation of voting together against him to discredit both . 
   it 's hardly an agreement that is entirely favourable to the uk ( and its far from meeting the expectation of those people in the uk that actually wanted to see reform . . ) , i admit that the analysis i have read have been written by europeists/eu federalists , but i think it 's clear that the uk will have an special status into the eu . 
   as to it being humiliating , it should n't be seen that way , correct me if i 'm wrong , but this agreement should be ratified by the european council , without even consulting to their national parliaments . 
  that means that the rest of governments are going to accept something they would n't want just to please the uk . 
  but the uk is not going to show that level of commitment , but will have a referendum , even after having reached a deal that satisfies to its government . 
  if uk rejects a deal tailored for it , is definitely going to be humiliating for the rest . 
  if uk votes to leave after making us swallow such a favourable ( for them ) agreement is going to be humiliating . 
  catholicism has its perks , too !, 
  a note with a bomb 's threat has been found in the flight sva 226 of saudi airlines ( madrid-riad ) . 
  that 's the only known by now . 
  edit : the passengers already have been evacuated from the plane . 
  in my region the date is called `` jueves lardero '' , and we eat [ * longaniza * ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=longaniza&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;hs=vbk&amp;channel=fs&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewivunym_93kahvfobqkhyn0dqiq_auibygb&amp;biw=1270&amp;bih=791#channel=fs&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=longaniza+frita ) . 
  it 's a sort of sausage with spices . 
  edit : i did n't know until today that * lardero * is a synonym of * graso * ( fat ) , so the translation is the same `` fat thursday '' . 
  asymmetry , quasi-veto introduced , stealth modification of the treaties , unjustified removal of benefits to eu citizens in uk . 
  google translation seems to be pretty understandable : ** a shame , everything is backward ** * the worst of tusk trimming package is certain social benefits to community migrants * * the six documents ( and letter ) president of the european council , donald tusk , to placate the british euroscepticism are a disgrace . 
  from a european and pro-european perspective , it contains countless setbacks and only relative progress , regulatory simplification . 
  * * it could be the consecration of the double speed in the eu , the more integrationist and no , for what tusk calls for `` mutual respect '' , especially in banking and monetary affairs , alas , the city . 
  * * but it is futile to talk , because the integration does not add them to any other mechanism and reluctant , the ability to return the policy to the council and the promise to find a `` satisfactory solution '' to the complainer : a quasi-veto .
