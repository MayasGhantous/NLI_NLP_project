  i 'm probably being a bit pedantic , but he has n't necessarily to choose a candidate among the party leaders , though it would be very surprising , and would n't do such a thing without the support of the main parties . 
  no , he could perfectly be minister of defense . 
  the 2nd from zaragoza ( my city ) , and he did n't get a seat , despite having good prospects . 
  anyway , given the of quotes of pablo iglesias [ praising the role of the venezuelan army ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btiyap0imeo&amp;t=16m40s ) is a bit ... ahem ... worrying, 
  til ... but what i already knew is that there was also a president of the republic and president of the government during the 2nd republic . 
  not sure about the first ... 
  * presidente del gobierno * is what in other countries is called prime minister . 
  i used pm for clarity . 
  yes , and i want a lamborghini . 
  but i will accept the mercedes if the alternative is a crappy car ... 
  defense ? 
  wtf ?? 
  i 'm thinking about it and actually makes sense : better give them the presidency and so avoid nationalists get more perks . 
  even pp could offer its abstention only to avoid podemos going into the government . 
  note that they still need * explicit support * from at least nationalist party ( basque pnv is the only real , non-independentist alternative ) , or ciudadanos ' abstention . 
  strictly it 's not . 
  he chooses the candidate after consulting the parliamentary groups , who still has to get a majority of votes in the parliament to be elected pm . 
  but , in theory , he could ** propose ** anyone he wants . 
  it 's a proposal , there is n't anything decided yet . 
  he has shared this proposal with the king , who must now choose a candidate to pm to be voted by the parlament ( surely rajoy for this first round , but he has n't enough votes ) . 
  but it 's definitely newsworthy and a big surprise . 
  yeah , but it 's trusting everythin on the poison going undetected . 
  once it has been , points directly to the service secret of a nuclear power and leaves a clear trace detectable with a geiger counter . 
  edit : as / u/limitlessltd points , it 's not easy to detect if you are n't looking for it . 
  great reading . 
  why anyone would choose a poison that leaves a such identifiable trace with everything it touches is beyond me . 
  here that 's exactly the limit . 
  a cartoon of the prince ( now king ) going doggy style with the princess was worth being prosecuted because of [ insults against the crown ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7092866.stm ) . 
  btw , [ here is the picture ] ( https://jonkepa.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/el-jueves.jpg ) . 
  well , that , and [ muhammad ] ( http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2012-09-20-portadamahoma1.jpg ) , but the second is self censorship . 
  i explicitelly differentiated between the words * conquer * and * settle * . 
  op said valencia was conquered by catalans from the crown of aragon , while the truth is that it was conquered mostly by aragonese noblemen . 
  aragon was bigger than today , and catalan was ( as is today ) spoken also by aragonese people , so language and nationality do n't always go in hand . 
  it 's not hard to find references about both facts . 
  also , i do n't want to start a flamewar here , but there are allegations about how the * llibre del repartiment * was [ manipulated in the xixth century ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/la-aventura-de-la-historia/2015/09/21/56000616ca4741391d8b45ad.html ) . 
  it 's pronounced \u03b8 , like in the horizontal stripes . 
  the captions explain it correctly . 
  you have different colors for bilingual areas , and languages in uppercase , spanish dialects in lower case . 
  regarding andalousian , it 's believed that ancients `` andalousians '' ( those who lived in the roman province of baetica ) , already spoke latin with a pretty distinctive accent . 
  [ cicero wrote in defense of the poet archias ] ( http://en.antiquitatem.com/pronunciation-of-latin-romance-languages ) * especially so since metellus was so keen to have his deeds written about that he even gave an audience to poets of cordoban birth , though their style sounded coarse and outlandish . 
  i did n't say anything about the language . 
  catalan was widely used in good chunks of the former kingdom of aragon . 
  valencia was conquered mostly by aragonese noblemen , while the opposite was true for majorca . 
  they former got angry with james i because he decided to create a new kingdom , instead of adding the territory to aragon ( as he had done with tortosa ) . 
  the settlement was way more mixed . 
  source : what i remember menendez pidal 's * historia de espa\u00f1a *, 
  i guess that , under the point of view of a eurosceptic , understimates the strength of the uk to get a tailored deal . 
  yes , because the only reason i may have to ask you to stay polite is because i work for el mundo . 
  the fact that you just called someone a liar and/or a retard has nothing to do with it . 
  it will have zero impact in any case . 
  the positions are very entrenched and their supporters wo n't change their mind . 
  specially given that pp 's funding is a stinking pile of shit already . 
  they try to avoid the thing . 
  and when they ca n't , they usually abstain or vote against it . 
  that 's what they have done in motions asking caracas to release the political prisoners in the spanish senate ( abstain ) or the european parliament ( against ) . 
  links ( in spanish sorry ) : http://www.europapress.es/nacional/noticia-senado-pide-liberacion-presos-politicos-venezolanos-abstencion-podemos-20150902140114.html http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2015/03/12/actualidad/1426156705_160690.html, 
  * stick to the issues and stay civil * / r/europe guidelines, 
  they have had pretty big hits ( gal , filesa , b\u00e1rcenas , pujol ... ) , a big miss ( 11m conspiration theory ) and some smaller ones ( trias ? 
  take with a grain of salt . 
  but they are n't sensationalistic rubbish as others are suggesting . 
  arancha is the diminutive of aranzazu . 
  if that 's the case , it should be easy to check who is right , because directly contradicts abc 's report . 
   if i 'm not wrong , he worked for a producer that then sold the programs to various tv channels , one on which is hispan tv from iran . 
  that is in no way incorrect . 
  afaik , no , fort apache is sold exclusively to hispan tv ( remember that beatriz talegon was asked to not to show her cleavage because did n't please to the iranians ) . 
  also , iglesias justified it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=va5nlsxc-ia, 
  it does n't deny its existence . 
  it states that the origin of the investigation could have had political intentions , and that there are n't evidences of crime . 
  the fact that is n't irregular o illegal , does n't make it free of criticism , though . 
  if podemos has commited to be open about the finances of their leaders , and iglesias has n't reported all of his income from the last two years , is something morally reprehensible . 
  even , by itself , the sole fact of working for a iranian funded tv channel may deserve some criticism by itself . 
  anyway , if that 's the case , should be a matter of investigative journalism , and not police investigation . 
  much less if those police reports are used solely to be leaked to the press . 
  queipo de llano definitely deserves a special mention . 
  i interpret this as in historic figures , not common criminals . 
  i recently read sender 's * the equinoctial adventure of lope de aguirre * , so i think [ lope de aguirre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lope_de_aguirre ) could be a good fit . 
  iirc this hugely contradicts spanish jurisprudence . 
  in spain , an employer ca n't even read company owned addresses ' emails if they are personnaly identifiable ( for example name.surname@company.com ca n't be snooped , while manager.accounting@company.com can be ) . 
  the right side . 
  in both senses . 
  the same in would happen spain ... including the fckng smokers !, 
  that , or the bus comes from that direction . 
   it 's a nuts-1 level map , and portugal in nuts-i us divided into islands and mainland , so no internal borders at this level . 
  only at nuts-ii , where you would see the borders of the smaller regions . 
  til about that nuts thing ... 
  the aggregation of some spanish regions seems a bit weird . 
  the first link is brutal . 
  from 00:50 , more or less says that it 's in iranian 's interest to spread a leftist message in latin america and spain because is bad to its adversaries , so we take advantage of it . 
  anyway , i do n't think it 's illegal . 
  no i 'm not !!, 
  it was you who introduced the notion of catalan police ( mossos de esquadra ) not abiding to the law . 
  * not allow it legally , obviously ... * there 's no such thing `` madrid 's court orders '' . 
  the spanish government does n't control the courts , as in any other country with power separation . 
  for example , artur mas is being judged by barcelona 's court . 
  let 's imagine he is declared guilty ( he does n't face jail time , but let 's suppouse it ) , and refuses to give himself out . 
  the judge issues an order of capture against him . 
  the mossos ' head refuse to apply it . 
  the judge orders then national police to capture them , and some mossos ' avoid it , using , or threatening to use , their weapons . 
  what 's going on here ? 
  do you suggest that the answer is * too bad , just let it go * ?
