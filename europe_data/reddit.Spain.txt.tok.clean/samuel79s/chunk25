  what police work are those guys doing ? 
  define `` richer '' ( and barcelona , i guess you mean catalonia ) . 
  [ it 's first in total gdp , 4th in gdp per capita ] ( http://www.datosmacro.com/pib/espana-comunidades-autonomas ) . 
  ok , it seems i 'm not explaining myself correctly . 
  there is no such dichotomy . 
  there is no * staying loyal to madrid or barcelona * . 
  that language is applicable to militar units , not police forces . 
  police in democratic states follow court orders , and what are you suggesting is that they start to ignore them , so effectively became a militia . 
  what obsession with tanks . 
  first of all , it 's highly unlikely , almost unimaginable , that catalan police will ignore court orders . 
  if some do ( there are 17000 in total ) , they will have to be arrested/disarmed by their mates or other police forces ( 7000 in catalonia right now , tens of thousands in neighboring zones ) you ca n't just allow a paramilitary force to operate in your country just because they wear an uniform . 
  30 % of the catalans . 
  47 % who voted in favour in the so called plebiscite . 
  interesting but i would like to see how they fare against the rest of the population . 
  i think that in spain pensioners are in way better financial shape than the average . 
  what 's the meaning of * this is about return of capital , not return on capital . * ? 
  i do n't know if i understand it well . 
  means that this is about not losing money , not simply getting a lower ( or zero ) interest on money ? 
  the reasoning is that the soverignity of the country it 's in the hands of all the citizens and ca n't be pieced apart . 
  not to talk that the majority of the catalans does n't want to take this route . 
  so it happened once 35 years ago because some generals went mad and so it would n't be bizarre if that happens today ? 
  sorry , but ca n't agree . 
  that was a coup against the legitimate government and happened in valencia , not in catalonia . 
  what has this got to do with anything ? 
  nothing with real consequences has been approved by the catalan parlament yet , but we may be close to that moment . 
  a workmate called the new catalan president * the idiot who will end up in jail * ... 
  only 30 % of census , at best , supports unilateral independence . 
  do you think the spanish government is going to just let it go ? 
  it 's absurd . 
  do you think that a state is going to allow an armed force to operate in its territory without doing anything ? 
  i hope that never happens , because it will be actually dangerous . 
  i copy and paste my own response from [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/spain/comments/40je8n/does_catalonia_have_a_big_chance_to_separate_from/ ) ** does catalonia have a big chance to separate from spain ? 
  ** imho , it 's pretty slim , if exists . 
  it would need a sustained state of civil disobedience for long enough for both sides to look for a solution based on co-sovereignity or the like . 
  in the meantime , the welfare state would go to hell , so basically people need to care more about independence than about their well-being . 
  you do n't get that with a popular support of 47 % ( 30 % of the census ) , probably less among the people who actually make a difference : public servants and upper management of companies . 
  the first risk their jobs by disobeying and may face criminal charges for prevarication . 
  the second put at risk their companies by not paying in taxes in the right account ( which may end freezed anyway ) , and also may face criminal charges for disloyal administration or be sued by shareholders if a public company , etc. . . 
  but may be separatists have some master plan that i ca n't imagine \u00af _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  i 'm out of the loop . 
  i know that hillary was using some private email addresses for official matters , but i do n't know if these recently published emails are somehow related to that scandal or are a completely different thing . 
  i do n't think is comparable . 
  that happened in the 50 's and both portugal and spain were ruled by dictators . 
  the haircut . 
  they have seen some electoral poll , and it did n't look bright ... 
  i do n't know who is the script writer but deserves an emmy . 
  what a victory !, 
  they must be very proud . 
  independence is round the corner ... 
  i also take my shoes off and use slippers when at home , change my socks and bath daily . 
  so what ? 
  we are talking about going into other people 's houses . 
  pretend it as much as you wish , it does n't work . 
  your feet will smell after a work shift at 40\u00bac , unless you do n't put a step in the street because you travel in a car with a/c and also work in an indoor office with a/c . 
  and i did n't talk only about the smell , but also about the sweat . 
  you will sweat after 5 min under the sun , and some of your guests may not wear socks . 
  we are looking for a general rule that works for everybody in order to became a custom , not only to 21st century white collars with carpeted floors . 
  edit : grammar, 
   if you think it is a nobrainer to leave your shoes on then probably you are a little too literal in how you use `` nobrainer '' i will step into this since it was me who used the expression `` no-brainer '' . 
  now you mention this marvellous organ , we could use it a bit more and try to guess how the atmospheric conditions could have shaped the respectives cultures , instead of resorting to simple explanations like `` mediterraneans are filthy people who do n't wash their feet '' . 
  in mediterranean summer , you reach +30 \u00bac ** almost every day ** , and if you wear socks , they will be sweaty in 5 minutes after leaving home . 
  the alternative is to wear sandals , but you do n't want people in their bare feet walking over slippery surfaces , which are far more common than wooden floors or carpets . 
  in contrast , in sweden , probably you do n't pass 20\u00bac in most summer days , but in winter is common to wear boots , probably muddy or wet , therefore , makes sense to remove them when entering a house . 
   wash your feet with soap , change socks everyday and take your goddamn shoes off when you 're at home.they smell because you 're wearing them all day long everyday . 
  you do n't reach 40\u00bac in summer , do you ? 
  you leave your shoes on . 
  always . 
  it 's a nobrainer . 
  there may be an exception with women in heels if the hosts have a wooden floor . 
  then , it may be considered polite to ask for ~ ~ another kind of shoes ~ ~ slippers to the hosts . 
  i 'm being pedantic , but carnaval is just before the fasting period ( cuaresma in spanish , lent in english ) . 
  it 's like your last chance for experimenting gluttony , lust ... until easter passes . 
  republican in this context means ira alike ? 
  indeed !, 
  i watched him live when real madrid came to zaragoza in the 90 's . 
  his battles with a center called ken `` animal '' bannister were formidable . 
  by then his ankles were already clearly damaged , but still he dominated the game . 
  the fact that he had a more than decent nba career with his injuries is unbelievable . 
  i also remember his games with the lithuanian nt , next to marciolenis and kurtinaitis . 
  those were the times ... 
  a couple of hyper-excited kids ... 
  so there is a thread about a train full of goods stolen by the nazis , and a german somehow manages to mention a totally unrelated spanish shipwreck ... well played . 
  great !, 
  but honestly , is hard to believe that dutch government was capable of convincing any big player in the tech industry of introducing a backdoor for them . 
  unlike spain , obviously . 
   they , on the other hand , have only started paying attention to this ... issue ... very recently , as i 've admited many times . 
  i 'm sorry , but there are more counterexamples ( 2008 ) : https://www.ciudadanos-cs.org/prensa/si_a_la_dignidad_de_las_victimas_pero_cuidado_con_politizarlas_senalo_albert_rivera/402/ they are a pretty incompetent kind of fascists , i should add . 
  regarding abortion , is in the first link , that 's what i brought it to the table . 
  basically you are deaf to any argument does n't fit your image of them . 
  you do n't like them , so they are fascists . 
  fine . 
  count me as fascist , too ( in case you did n't already ) . 
  you have already `` won '' any possible debate . 
   a true plebiscite ? 
  and that would be exactly ... what ? 
  a true plebiscite , not regional elections disguised as one . 
   you should recognize now that adding jxsi to the cup ones was n't exactly fair game too . 
   why ?? 
  if is n't evident to you , there is nothing i can say to change your mind . 
  honestly , i had a higher concept of you .
