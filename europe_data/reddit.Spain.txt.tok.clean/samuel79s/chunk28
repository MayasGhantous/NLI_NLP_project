  it wo n't be easy , but i think most people want politicians to reach agreements and nationalists out of the picture . 
  it 's pretty bad , honestly . 
  anyway , they need time to grow organically before becoming a real alternative . 
  i wonder if there is place for a true liberal party in spain . 
   half of them want less autonomy and more centralization , and the other half want more autonomy . 
  i do n't think any of them asks for less autonomy . 
  taifas ' kings always want more power . 
  what they want is ** more money ** . 
  on the contrary , i think women of this country will vote massively to the first female candidate with any chance to win ( let it be pp 's soraya or psoe 's susana ) . 
  that 's what the unofficial poll that i have done says , at least :-) also , pp has had plenty of women as regional leaders ( aguirre , cospedal , rudi , barbera , etc. . . ) . 
  because it 's unmanageable . 
  italy is the canonical example . 
  no , there are more options . 
  hard to swallow , but there are more . 
  if psoe and ciudadanos both abstain , pp could be still in power . 
  i do n't know who won , but spain has lost, 
  psoe could decide to abstain if podemos asks something unacceptable for them like a catalan referendum . 
  do n't rule out pp yet . 
  he just want to believe it . 
  it 's suicide for psoe . 
  ai n't that bad . 
  it 's better than rajoy as orator , and way more sincere than iglesias . 
  i do n't dislike the fact that psoe governs , what worries me are podemos ' conditions . 
  i just voted too , and i have to say it was crowded . 
  i think it 's also interesting to note which european leaders explicitely have supported any of the candidates . 
  * mariano rajoy : supported by angela merkel . 
  * pedro sanchez : supported by manuel valls . 
  * pablo iglesias : supported by alexis tsipras . 
  * albert rivera : supported by guy verhofstadt . 
   i 've got a question : what is actually at stake in this election ? 
  like , i know that there is the possibility of either psoe or pp becoming the major governing party ( although probably with support of smaller parties ) but i do n't know what they 're actually planning to do . 
  what could we see change because of this election ? 
  it 's hard to know , because there is little consensus among the four parties . 
  they plan on changing the constitution , no less , but is gon na be tough . 
  i think there is little overlap about their proposals . 
  anyway , things i think could change because a big compromise may be made ( 3 of 4 parties ) : * derogation of gag law . 
  * a big pact on education . 
  education laws in spain have always been changed without consensus , so when the other party ( pp-psoe ) has reached the power , has reformed the previous law or redacted a new one . 
  the last one had some aspects particularly bad , like making religion part of the curriculum again . 
  i guess a pact is possible this time , if none of the parties behaves too partisanly . 
  * measures against corruption . 
  c 's and podemos have some interesting proposals about this , and they have stated they could reach agreements by themselves . 
  pp and psoe will need to jump on the bandwagon to not to lose face . 
   and , do any of them have serious economic reforms ? 
  * pp : some fine tuning . 
  lowering taxes , incentives to those who continue working after reaching retirement age ... no big reforms . 
  * psoe : keeping the main taxes and raising some of them , but in a armonized way in the whole country ( there are some taxes that are up to the region to apply , like inheritance tax ) , derogation of pp 's labour law . 
  raising progressively the minimum salary up to 2025 . 
  negotiate higher deficit objectives with the eu ... * c 's ( disclaimer , i know their program better and i 'm going to vote them ) . 
  a moderate reduction of income tax , changing labour law to allow a single kind of contract , a monetary supplement to workers with lower wages , a bankruptcy law for individuals , invest 3 % of gdp in r&d , lower taxes for freelancers who do n't reach minimum wage , lower and simplify vat ... * podemos . 
  increase income tax for the higher `` steps '' ( 48 % right now iirc ) and lower it for the lower ones , guaranteed income equal to the minimum wager for everyone , raise the minimum wage ... finance most of it with a huge surge of income from fighting fiscal fraud . 
  ignore eu deficit objectives ... 
  it 's a huge simplification , obviously . 
  * scenario 1d * rivera changes his mind to avoid new elections but imposes hard conditions on the pp like ... rajoy 's head !!, 
  edit : well thought , he has asked other parties to do the same . 
  if after the first votings psoe and podemos do n't abstain , he will be freed from his promise . 
  you should . 
  he 's a competent guy , a respected lawyer who is well versed in corruption cases . 
  it 's a shame , we need mp 's like him . 
  but rosa diez went berserk with sosa wagner and was the begining of the end for upyd . 
   catsiqespot was not a pro-independence party . 
  they 're certainly not unionist , but did not support independence either . 
  they did n't pull that trick until they saw they had failed . 
  during the ellectoral campaign called them * botiflers * ( traitors ) * ad infinitum * . 
   i would like to see podemos in power , why do you hate us !? ... 
  * looks flair * oh !, 
  * if pp and ciudadanos achieve an absolute majority ( boring option ) : * * scenario 1 : rajoy will be prime minister with the votes of pp and abstention of ciudadanos . 
  * sorry , but i do n't agree . 
  c 's abstention will only allow pp to invest mariano rajoy if they get a great result ( 140 + seats ) . 
  let 's suppouse c 's has 60 seats . 
  that means that pp needs ( 350-60 ) / 2 = 145 seats ** of explicit support ** . 
  that 's well above poll estimates for them . 
  so , no , i do n't think the analysis is right . 
  that 's why makes no sense, 
  they are n't part of government in none of those . 
  if they are blinded by power , they play their cards pretty badly . 
  podemos ca n't do anything sensible like that because they are a coalition . 
  the catalan wing will ask for a referendum no matter what , and would break with rest of the coalition . 
  besides , pablo iglesias is a * prima dona * , and wo n't want to abstain . 
  no , i do n't see that happening . 
  no , i was just pointing out that , if c 's abstains with pp and votes against every other candidate , we are very probably headed to new elections ( if the polls are right ) . 
  if c 's opts for abstention for the investiture , and has , let 's say , 60 seats , that means pp needs ( 350-60 ) / 2 = 145 seats . 
  it 's very unlikely that pp will achieve such a good result . 
  * ... spain is still a country stratified by age and status in which protected insiders enjoy secure employment and pension rights while young outsiders struggle to gain a foothold . 
  * spot on . 
  about the question of the headline . 
  yes , it 's too early , look to portugal . 
  yeah , let 's protect the brain and leave the balls completely exposed . 
  evolution is a bitch . 
  it can only be greece ... and you know it . 
  ahem , it was premeditated , so no . 
  poor pedro s\u00e1nchez , now will considered the instigator after having called him dishonest ... 
  ahem , spain aproved a similar law 5 years ago ... 
  not each year , every five years . 
  and it 's way less than it should be if the basque country used the same system that the rest of the country . 
  look at fiscal pressure or whatever it 's called in english . 
  i know you pay taxes . 
  i 'm not dumb , but thank you . 
  again , if your workers do n't have primary studies , you hardly may have r&d based economy . 
  and my point is that you ca n't look things in isolation , it 's a complex system and prosperity of richers regions is also built on .
