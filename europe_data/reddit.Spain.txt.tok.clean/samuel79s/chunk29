  this can be managed better ... and that 's what we should focus on . 
  i 'm done with this thread , i do n't think we 'll get any further . 
  best regards . 
  and the central goverment gets the money from ... ? 
  do you know what 's an outrage ? 
  compare invesments in madrid 's port vs barcelona 's one ? 
  what do you have to say to that ? 
  :-p now seriously , you are obsessed with madrid , spain is way more than that , you should know . 
  relax a bit . 
  i seriously think that you understimate how that regions have evolved , and how their work force have contributed to the growth of northern regions . 
  and money is n't flowing without control , that 's what fiscal union is for . 
  i guess you are a kid who never has contributed to the system , but here you are , claiming for `` your '' money and lecturing people . 
  do n't tell me more , you 'll say now that you are a leftist , are n't you ? 
  those regions have done huge steps in the last 30 years . 
  do you realize that in 1980 analfabetism in andalousia was around 20 % vs 5 % in the northern regions ? 
  do you think that in a single generation you can change that ? 
  god , if some of those people still will be in the work force . 
   but does huesca really vote that different from zaragoza those bastards will do the opposite which zaragoza does just to fuck around :-p, 
  i understand , you believe it 's your tribe 's money . 
  does n't work that way , fortunately . 
  money has to be redistributed at the citizens ' level , at least in social states . 
  and i hope this redistribution someday will be done at the eu level , and money will flow where is more needed . 
  that 's why fiscal union is needed , not to fuck southerners for the sake of it . 
   the allocation from the province to the autonomy level . 
  even that would be an earthquake . 
  zaragoza would swallow the whole aragon : zaragoza 's province : 1m . 
  7 seats huesca 's province : 250k . 
  3 seats teruel 's province : 150k . 
  3 seats something similar would happen with barcelona , but less extreme . 
  fiscal autonomy works great for the richest regions , not for the poorest . 
  there 's no way in which andalousia or extremadura could keep their public services at their current level without fiscal transfers . 
  and that 's the whole thing of spain is about ( for some of us ) , the same rights for all its citizens , including access to public services , regardless of where they live . 
  fuck the rojigualda , that 's what i stand for . 
  i think psoe is collapsing , hence the podemos increase . 
  also , it 's somewhat clear that they wo n't win , so people will vote them as a punishment for older parties . 
  they are the * rageful option * . 
  i do n't think rivera is so bad at debating . 
  imho he crushed iglesias in the informal debate in salvados , and in the university 's one he did better ( again , imho ) . 
  but he was very nervous in the debate to four , probably his expectations were too high too soon and was overstressed . 
  and iglesias shines in the sort of melee that those kind of debates became . 
  thanks !!, 
  did n't know this happened ...

  anyway , there 's very little comentary , just the data . 
  in red , the lower end for every party and in green the upper one . 
  the summary in percentages : pp : 24.5 < -  29.9 psoe : 17.0 < -  23.3 c 's : 16.5 < -  23.3 podemos : 14.7 < -  23.1 iu : 2.7 < -  6.3 there wo n't be new polls , since the spanish electoral law does n't allow it . 
  edit : now my personal opinion . 
  podemos is gaining momentum , and could be in the higher end of its interval . 
  could be 3rd or even 2nd . 
  that 's why romanians learn spanish so fast , i guess . 
   additionally english is not really hard to learn . 
  english is pretty hard to pronunciate , imho ( [ lots of vowel sounds ] ( http://spanishlinguist.us/2013/04/spanish-vowels-vs-english-vowels/ ) ), 
   actually , they 're right here but not honest again . 
  he knows full well that the us does n't want to extradite him but to useful idiots it 's a perfect cover story . 
  honest question . 
  if he is n't afraid of being extradited to the us , why he does n't just accept to go to sweden ? 
  what 's the worst penalty he could get ? 
  i guess that less than the five years he has spent in a sort of home arrest . 
  of course , this would be a no-brainer if there was n't a risk of extradition to the us .

  ** very prevalent ** . 
  the effect is that most of young people of europe share the same cultural references , and nationalism makes less sense than ever . 
  it originated in an era when people of a place had access to the same books , the same traditions , etc. . . and makes little sense now . 
  it has its downsides since it may be seen as a uniformizing force , and the main example is we have imported american traditions like halloween . 
  luckily , thanks to internet , culture and entertaiment are diversifying , so people lose part of their nationally-based cultural identity in exchange of an identity based on their interests . 
  i think ... 
  in zaragoza we have a roman museum and roman ruins , but nothing compared to , well , rome . 
  you ca n't fly directly to rome , but madrid is less than two hours in train , and you can fly from there . 
  and wine !, 
  hopefully hsts and hpkp will be common in some years ... * fingers crossed *, 
  hmmm , i 'm pretty surprised . 
  `` public '' means provided freely by a region/state/council ? 
  in spain , public ( usually council provided ) networks are [ limited to 256kbps ] ( https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=boe-a-2010-12831 ) , and ca n't reach residential buildings . 
  this is to safeguard the competence in the telecommunications market . 
  i thought that there was a transposition of some eu regulation , hence my surprise . 
  thank you for your answer and for your work . 
  it 's always enlightening to hear from someone who deeply knows about a matter . 
  i will do my homework and will read the honeyball report . 
  human trafficking is one of the biggest problems of our societies , and i think it does n't make into the headlines frequently enough . 
   n. european countries where it 's normal to just have a wider build . 
  yeah , that 's my excuse too . 
  miss catherine , thank you for doing this ama . 
  i woud like to ask you , which policies do you think that are the best for fighting against the form of slavery that human trafficking is ? 
  i 'm no expert at this , but as far i am aware of , there are three models to deal with prostitution in europe ( in a broad sense , not only the eu ) . 
  legalization ( the netherlands-germany model ) , prohibition of the purchase of sex services ( sweden ) and the * do-nothing * policy ( spain ) . 
  which do you think is the best model ? 
  do you think that the eu should force or recommend any of them to its members ? 
  i ask this , because a spanish member of alde ( ciudadanos ) has recently argued for adopting the german model in spain . 
  thank you very much . 
  a highly biased history of the basque . 
  of course there are a lot of simplifications , in this time is understable , but the 20 seconds or so dedicated to the history of the `` basque conflict '' ( eta ) are just unfair to the memory of hundreds of victims . 
  no i will say loud and clear . 
  eta , specially after the amnesty of 1977 , is a terrorist group who killed lot of people , lots of them civilians . 
  and yes , the spanish government recurred to the dirty war in a small period , something that is despicable and i fully condemn , but there is an order of magnitude in the inflicted pain . 
  of course , the video makes no mention to the support of the basque carlists to franco . 
  and the fact that ** navarra and alava kept their fueros during francoism ** due to this support . 
  do you think that the * attention whore * who pablo iglesias is will abstain ? 
  i seriously doubt it . 
  anyway , i wish you are right .
