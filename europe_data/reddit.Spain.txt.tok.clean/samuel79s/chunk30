  i have said that the only sensible choices right now are psoe and c 's . 
  well , they had to translate fuzzy arguments into concrete policies and suddenly did n't look so appealing ... 
  kudos to tsipras this time ... until he deleted it at least . 
  mainly , the fact that the same crime is handled differently depending of the gender of victim and aggressor , with different penalties . 
  also , that preventive measures taken when women denounce the crime are too harsh : the man is immediately arrested until a judge decides aboute the case . 
  this means at the very least a night on prison , and up to a couple of days . 
  this open the door to abuses by women , who could use it for revenge or even as a negotiation card in divorce cases . 
  feminists and critics of this law throw at each other very different statistics about the false accusation rate . 
  my anecodotal experience , since i 'm married to a lawyer , is that false accusations are n't rare , and unscrupulous divorce lawyers do n't hesitate to use it as a tool if needed . 
  said that , it has some undisputed virtues , like the creation of special courts to handle this kind of cases in a timely fashion . 
  feel free to improve it . 
  anything shorter than a thousand pages book will be a simplification . 
  yes , but at this point ai n't that important . 
  any party will need at least the support of other party and the abstention of another . 
  imho this rules out pp and podemos , but even for psoe or c 's will be very hard to reach it . 
  also , the legitimacy of seats vs votes may poison even more any negotiation .

  a quick review of spanish parties . 
  i 'll only review the most prominent ones i will use a 3 dimensional model ( yay ! ), 
  to evaluate every party , being the axes economic policy , social model and territoral model . 
  pp [ popular party ] . 
  it 's the current ruling party . 
  it was founded by some francoist ministers ( the most progressive of them , which is not to say a lot ) . 
  they have governed spain from 1996-2004 and in 2011-2015 . 
  currently they are involved in uncountable corruption scandals . 
  economic policy : liberal ( allegedly but they embrace nationalistic protectionism where they can ) . 
  social model : very conservative . 
  they have opossed to divorce , abortion and homosexual marriage laws , but they have n't derogated any of them . 
  territorial model : originally centralist , but since the current territorial model seems irreversible they have embraced it . 
  psoe [ socialist and worker 's spanish party ] . 
  social democrats . 
  they have governed spain from 1982-1996 and 2004-2011 . 
  in the 90 's they had their fair share of corruption scandals . 
  they lost a lot of support due how they handled the crisis . 
  economic policy : social democrat . 
  social model : progressive . 
  they have promulgated the abortion , divorce and homosexual marriage laws . 
  one of the most critizised ones was the law against `` gender violence '' . 
  territorial model : originally they defended the current , autonomies based , territorial model . 
  now they argue for transforming it in a true federal model , whatever it means . 
  podemos [ we can ] . 
  a new party , born from the social movements that protested against the austerity measures and the political corruption . 
  its leader , pablo iglesias , became famous debate shows in tv . 
  they are allegedly a transversal movement but most of its members have been in left or far left organizations . 
  economic policy : unknown . 
  originally anticapitalistic , but since they went up in the polls they claimed it to be `` nordic social democrat '' . 
  social model : progressive . 
  territorial model : federalised ( i guess ) . 
  they argue for including the right for self determination of territories in the constitution . 
  ciudadanos [ citizens ] ( disclaimer , this is my preferred option by now ) . 
  they are a party born in catalonia in 2006 as a response to catalan nationalism and traditional spanish parties ( pp and psoe ) . 
  it claims to focus in the citizen rights in contrast to territories rights . 
  last year , after a failed alliance with another centrist party , they decided to concur to elections out of catalonia . 
  they formed aggrupations in all spain in record time , which means that lots of their candidates are pretty bad . 
  economic policy : liberal ( allegedly since they have n't governed anywhere ) social model : progressive . 
  they have opened some interesting debates about drug decriminalization and prostitution legallization . 
  territorial model : federalist , but they critics say that 's centralist , since argue for a tight control of the states finances . 
  those are mostly the old school communists . 
  they were the ones who more strongly fought the dictatorship , but after it could n't capitalize those sacrifices . 
  economic policy : anticapitalistic in theory , we do n't know what they would apply in practice . 
  social model : progressive . 
  territorial model : federalist since the start . 
  pnv [ basque nationalistic party ] originally an ethnic-based and ultracatholic party , now it 's a much more moderate right wing party . 
  they strived strongly for independence a decade ago , but now , without explicitelly renouncing to it , they focus more on using and preserving basque territories historical rights . 
  economic policy : liberal inside the basque country , but protectionist with the outside . 
  social model : moderately conservative . 
  territorial model : they do n't care , as long it preserves their rights . 
  catalan nationalistic parties . 
  just now they are a mess , and a category on their own . 
  look into other posts for information . 
  and a not too distant fourth , i should add . 
  in fact , adding the percentages of * traditional * left ( iu ) and the * new * left ( podemos ) you get a cuadruple draw . 
  a portuguese mark whatney ... 
  i would watch that movie . 
  impressive teamwork !, 
  you guys do n't understand . 
  ten ** spanish ** minutes is n't a exact amount of time , but actually a period of time in the 20-40 range of international minutes . 
  also , only a spaniard is needed to do the actual work , but that 's without counting the compulsory couple of observers doing snarky remarks ... 
  given that `` literally '' is very commonly used to mean `` figuratively '' , a light read of the comment may be interpreted as in `` the worst of catalonia is like the average spain '' , hence the downvotes . 
  make a martyr of such idiot . 
  great idea . 
  thank you , officer . 
  please do n't fine me , in spanish equal is written * igual * and egalitarian * igualitario/a * . 
   many women wear it to free themselves from what they perceive as sexual objectification yeah , sure . 
  coincidentally , all women of arabia saudi have freely reached that conclusion , while women of european countries choose to wear from the wide spectrum of * semi-naked * to * fully-covered-with-wide-clothes * . 
  sure . 
  a burqa or a hiyab is an obstacle to any social interaction and has the effect of `` jailing '' the woman even when its outside . 
  people wo n't recognize you , and wo n't initiate spontaneusly any conversation , which is something desirable to controlling husbands and fathers , who do n't want their wifes/daughters to know alternative ways of life . 
  also is an effective way of covering up signs of domestic violence . 
  on the contrary , even if a hiyab is forced on a woman , by itself does n't limit her significatively in her social interactions , since keeps the face clearly visible . 
  and limiting limits on individual freedom ? 
  safety issues aside , a burka or niqab is a tool for female submission and should n't be allowed in a equalitarian society . 
  a hiyab is a whole different story . 
  meanwhile in melilla ( spain ) , the main oposition party is protesting because some schools are [ denying entrance ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.europapress.es%2fceuta-y-melilla%2fnoticia-lider-oposicion-melilla-contra-colegios-prohiban-entrada-mujeres-niqab-burka-20151124220419.html ) to the mothers who wear a niqab or burka . 
  turkmen rebels in syria are n't turk soldiers . 
  op 's was pointing out that argentina 's involvement in the islands could be beneficial to falklanders . 
  i do n't know a lot about argentinian politics , but i guess that macri 's intention is to ** put aside ** sovereignity claims and not unconditioninally accept british standpoint and it would be a friendly gesture from brits to welcome that attitude and not act as argentinian claims were completelly mad and unsubstantiated . 
   what sovereignty issues ? 
  there 's a [ dispute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_general_assembly_resolution_2065 ) . 
  the fact that you have a strong point on it does n't make it disappear .
