  again , i 'm not taking sides , but hey , take it as you wish . 
  ok , your standpoint is more consistent than op 's one . 
  no calls to `` let 's work together '' but `` work with me or go to hell '' . 
   i wonder if there are any other place that would love to have a vote on their sovereignty hmmm , let me think ... hong kong ? 
  i guess you mean that they should be a french * colony * instead of a british one . 
  it 's fine , and i do n't care , i was just pointing out that 's a bit selfish to make a call to work together once you have draw a red line on the main point of disagreement . 
  i think that a more constructive statement would to call to work together ** despite ** the sovereignity issues that should be handled through diplomatic channels , and with observance to international law . 
  edit : if someone is thinking that i 'm saying this because of gibraltar and inspired of some sort spanish-argentinian brotherhood , i 'm not . 
  spain has n't got a lot of love from argentina in recent times . 
   they 're british islands ... 
  it 's better to work together . 
  it 's better to work together , especially once you unconditionally accept my point of view ... 
  you are forgetting to append the / s to all of your posts in this thread , are n't you ? 
   hum , why would it appeal to young guys who would have to become soldiers and die fighting ? 
  men will get their harem of ** houries ** in the next life . 
  i doubt the women are promised the same . 
  edit : i was wrong . 
  from the wikipedia * as for the gender of the houris : the quran does n't indicate that only men would be granted the company of houris -- in fact , it can be inferred from the context that both men and women believers will have a plural number of houris for themselves . 
  [ 22 ] this in turn leads to the assumptions that houris can be both male or female . 
  furthermore , all adjectives used in the quran to refer to the houris can be applied to both females and males ( i.e. , `` splendid '' , `` pure '' , `` companions '' `` modest '' , `` wide-eyed '' , `` gazelle-eyed '' , and even `` large-breasted '' ) . 
  * statement released by paris prosecutor fran\u00e7ois molins says a woman blew herself up by exploding a suicide vest during a predawn saint denis raid . 
  probably more interesting is that , as is reveled in [ this article from insidesources.com ] ( http://www.insidesources.com/new-york-times-article-blaming-encryption-paris-attacks/ ) , the nyt has removed from its page an article ( [ avalaible in the archive.org ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20151115191248/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/world/europe/paris-attackers-communicated-with-isis-officials-say.html ) ) which stated the following : * the attackers are believed to have communicated using encryption technology , according to european officials who had been briefed on the investigation but were not authorized to speak publicly . 
  the first outcome is that we can say goodbye to electoral debate . 
  forget corruption , austerity , etc. . . those things would be very secondary and the debate will be centered on the catalan thing . 
  this is good for the pp , since those are their weak flanks . 
  also rajoy will have the chance to project an image of calmness and firmness , while now is seen mostly as incompetent . 
  the second is that extremisms fuel each other . 
  lot of people of the rest of spain , indifferent or even sensible to catalan claims , are very hurt for things like artur mas laughing while the spanish anthem is booed ( the same could be said about catalans who now are independentists now because how the pp acted with the estatut ) . 
  sentiments will dominate , and psoe has unarguably flirted with nationalists , so pp is the logical choice for a lot of people . 
  they have 2 months , or there will be new elections . 
  my bet is he will be elected * in extremis * , but who knows . 
  it could be very well a tactic , i do n't discard anything . 
  at this point , i do n't think it 's really important who is the catalan or spanish president . 
  bridges are burnt , things will go worse before going better . 
  well , the aircraft have been a bit of a nuisance , but the local economy has had an small surge due all the soldiers deployed . 
  speaking for myself , they can do the manoeuvres every year . 
  i have been told than next year will be in poland ... 
  i do n't want to argue just for the sake of arguing . 
  i thought you were referring to the wing of the psc who historically argued for `` asimetrycal '' federalism , and at the end left the party . 
  if it was n't your intention , fine , i misinterpreted your intention , but i do n't understand what 's the point of putting in the `` more autonomy '' basket anything from the federalists to the independentists . 
  a federal reform is n't for catalonia but for everybody . 
  and c 's has also a federal proposal . 
  no , the plan is to keepthe spanish passport until the catalan has the same strength . 
  and i 'm saying it seriously , that 's what an independentist leader has said . 
   finally , sanchez and the guy from c 's are too good looking to be in the same government . 
  pretty strong political analysis here :-p, 
  sorry , but that argument does n't hold anymore . 
  the independentists of the psc left and funded their own party . 
  remember ? 
  mariano rajoy is n't breaking the constitutional boundaries , it 's not the same at all . 
  what happened today does n't have real consequences . 
  the declaration will be declared inconstitutional and void and that 's all . 
  when they start disobeying the court orders , that 's the tipping point . 
  everyone knew that they were against unilateral independence except you , then . 
  you have no shame . 
   in the 1930 's . 
  franco stooped the last one , and pushed slogans as `` spain is one , great and free '' . 
  actually , stopping independentism was one of the motives for the coup d'etat in 1936 . 
  whoa , whoa , whoa ... pretty hard history rewriting here . 
  it was the republic who suspended the catalan autonomy , and the general batet , who controlled the rebelion , was killed by franco . 
   the rest did n't align . 
  the did n't vote today then ? 
  no , they aligned with the no to this resolution . 
  spain is comparable to the ussr ??? 
  i 'm crying right now . 
  crying . 
  there is n't any reason to think that corruption would increase , it makes no sense . 
  but that 's true for the rest of spain , too , sensitivity and beligerance to corruption has increased a lot . 
  if you are talking about the torredembarra case , it 's from 2012 , but it 's true that everybody knew that corruption was rampant since 2004 when pasqual maragall said what it said . 
  look how parties voted today , please . 
  yes - 72 seats - 47 % of electorate no - 63 seats - 52 % of electorate at the very least is a `` not this way '' . 
  speaking for myself , the `` german outrage '' applies to german goverment 's attitude , not to german citizens . 
  said that , spying elected officials of allies should n't be acceptable , but i concede that hardly can be considered a surprise . 
  well , then the # 1 rule of the game is , if you do it do n't get caught . 
  i 'm sure spain ( or the vatican ! ), 
  are a big threat for germany / s, 
  thank you . 
  very appreciated . 
  after german outrage for us ' spying , i think it 's ~ ~ significative ~ ~ significant . 
  well , not only in spanish embassy . 
  may be i should have posted a more general article : [ report : germany spied on u.s. embassies , vatican ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/11/07/der-spiegel-germany-spied-us-embassies-vatican/75368444/ ) * `` in germany , the bnd 's own selector lists included numerous foreign embassies and consulates , '' der spiegel reported . 
  `` the e-mail addresses , telephone numbers and fax numbers of the diplomatic representations of the united states , france , great britain , sweden , portugal , greece , spain , italy , austria , switzerland and even the vatican were all monitored in this way . '' *, 
  may be catalonia will be independent ( or worse , semi-independent ) in the near term ( 5-10yrs ) , but surely not as a result of a temper tantrum in the middle of the worst financial crisis of the last 50yrs . 
  good luck to everyone potentially affected , i think next year is going to be pretty shitty in economic terms . 
  tldr ; `` wall '' used figuratively . 
   you must be very young , that 's not how it works , the ordinary people begin asking why they are fighting in syria in the first place and that russian civilians dying is n't worth it , it increases civil unrest . 
  that 's a very western ( and recent ) attitude . 
  i do n't think it applies for russia . 
  i do the same , but i do n't know if that 's the common way here or i 'm just a freak . 
  i do n't get it too . 
  people ( well spainiards ) used to cross the minho just to buy towels . 
  it 's absurd . 
  glubs ... of course . 
  thank you . 
  i find it ... shocking . 
  the main users of ~ ~ bank ~ ~ bench parks in spain are old people and teenagers , and they use it as a gathering place . 
  also , if you sit in a ~ ~ bank ~ ~ bench and do n't fully occupy it , people will sit next to you , and even , god forbid , ** they may even try to initiate a conversation ** . 
  son, 
  well , he has been caught twice driving without license , after losing it because a previous offense ... 
  i do n't know if he 's greedy , though .
