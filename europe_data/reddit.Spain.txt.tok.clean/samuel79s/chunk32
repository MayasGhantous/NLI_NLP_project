  is that real ? 
  ca n't believe it ... 
  in spain we have a similar law since 2007 . 
  i guess 11m madrid bombings had something to do with it . 
  https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=boe-a-2007-18243 obviously only metadata is stored ( source and destination ip for internet communications ) . 
  wep weaknesses were more related to initialization vector length , not to rc4 weaknesses . 
  people used to before the internet , but the point is , from whom are you hiding your credit card details ? 
  the goverment ? 
  the store ? 
  it makes no sense . 
  banning pfs does n't make you more vulnerable to a third party . 
  the only scenario i kind think of is one in which a `` hacker '' stores the communications and in the future hacks the server and is able to decrypt them with the recently acquired server key . 
  but if he may get the server key , he will probably will have access to the database , and it 's game over for the customers ' data . 
  btw , using pfs without long server keys (  1024 for rsa ) as lots of web stores do , could make you * more exposed * to mass surveillance not less . 
  see longjam attack . 
  i 'm going to play the devil 's advocate here . 
  how is this different to phone wiretapping ? 
  this is not about mass surveillance , at least in theory . 
  from i understand , the kind of features that would get banned under this law could be perfect forward secrecy/plausible deniability/client encryption . 
  any of them has `` real world '' counterparts that we accept today : * perfect forward secrecy . 
  implies that the transient keys that are used during a communication ca n't be deciphered even with access to the server or client keys . 
  so storing the communication in hopes of deciphering it in the future with a court warrant would be worthless . 
  there 's no perfect correspondence in the real world , since you ca n't intercept a conversation without knowing its content , but we accept that phone conversations may be wiretaped with the adequeate legal guarantees . 
  * plausible deniability . 
  let 's suppose someone is charged with a crime , and there is a encrypted volume in his pc . 
  he 's asked the deciphering key , and he complies . 
  they open the encrypted volume and there 's nothing incriminating , but the software supports plausible deniability so the evidence could be there . 
  today , if someone is asked to reveal something he knows and does n't comply , he can be charged for it . 
  * client encryption . 
  this is the lavabit 's case . 
  the provider of the service just ca n't decipher the data is storing , but again , is akin to the wiretapping case or the fact that snail mail may be intercepted by police during an investigation . 
  edit : btw , i 'm not in favour of this kind of laws , but i do n't think the thing is so clear-cut . 
   are you paid by ciutagrams ? 
  ok course !!, 
  the propaganda that you are spreading is for free ? 
  i ca n't believe that someone so partisan exists . 
  i 'm not talking about a civil war at all !!, 
  but pretending that nothing important will ( or should ) happen is completely naive . 
  you are right in that my last sentence was unnecessary , sorry for that , but i do n't understand the nitpicking . 
  the whole discussion is about if the separatist parties have the support from the catalan electorate to do what they are doing , and they do n't . 
  [ false ] ( https://www.ciudadanos-cs.org/prensa/ciutadans_cs_condena_el_fascismo_en_una_propuesta_del_parlament/6255/ ) and if you are reffering to [ this day ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxqyfkmqa4i ) they left the parliament after being insulted by cup politicians . 
  and if a party has voted together with the pp for years , that has been ciu . 
  please read what i write and not what you imagine i write . 
  * they and unio explicitely were against any unillateral declaration like this . 
  period . 
  * that 's what i said , nothing more , nothing less . 
  is this an unillateral declaration of independence ? 
  yes . 
  so did they , and of course pp-psoe-c 's , argue against it in the electoral period ? 
  yes . 
  so is the most of the catalan ellectorate against it ? 
  yes . 
  see ? 
  it 's not hard . 
   ciutadans is the party of the ibex-35 , the andalusian land-lords , the galician caciques and the catalan bourgeois families . 
  new faces , new name , same the rest . 
  do n't get fooled . 
  vote the pirate party if you do n't want to vote the same people that have always ruled . 
  do n't spect any change coming from the politicians that snort cocaine in the bathroom with the super rich . 
  amazing analysis . 
  do n't get fooled ... they are bad very bad ... trust me ... ok , thank you . 
  look , i 'm taking a analytical ( and cynical ) standpoint here . 
  it 's not about what i want , but what about i think . 
  she may be a marketing product , but a good one . 
  she knows how to debate and shows determination without losing the manners . 
  she 's already liked outside of catalonia , and the wet dream for c 's would be that she gets booed or harassed in the catalan parliament during her speeches . 
  that would boost their prospects ** a lot ** . 
  if it 's going downhill for someone is for podemos . 
  their catalan position is going to drown them , specially if the electoral debate is centered about the catalan thing , and not about economy and cuts . 
  it 's very difficult , i concede , but we 'll see . 
  and arrimadas has a very important role , but not like you are suggesting . 
  she 's the opposition chief in the catalan parliament , and if she shows strength and determination in her speeches against separatists , ciutadans ' popularity will skyrocket . 
  i have n't said that they are unionists , but that ** at the very least ** the 53 % of the electorate was unambigously against this very exact thing . 
  stop repeating that bullshit . 
  they and unio explicitely were against any unillateral declaration like this . 
  period . 
  you ca n't be so naive . 
  it will be a clash and wo n't be pretty , and the spanish government has more tools that going to the courts . 
  look at the 2nd republic to see what could happen : the suspension of the autonomy , the declaration of the state of alarm ... 
  it will eventually , and it 's probably not very far away : there are general elections in december and seems like a perfect moment for that to happen , but this declaration by itself is nothing illegal . 
  it will be declared void by spanish constitutional court , and that is . 
  only a catalan spanish pm could handle this , but i wonder who could he be ... ;-) / s, 
  another declaration without immediate tangible consequences . 
  fine . 
  awake me when the action begins , please . 
  only after the third gin-tonic ... 
  people may have fun however they please , but when zombies start to ring my door , i have to help my children to make their hand-made wytch-costume and all the tv channels are broadcasting halloween specials , i think i am entitled to have an opinion about it . 
  well , i find it gross , disgusting , annoying and interferes with the local tradition of all saints ' day , which is about remembering the deceased . 
  i also do n't like how it 's pushed into kids by the media , and the fact that even laicist schools have embraced a pagan festivity . 
  can i use the word `` hate '' then ? 
  we did n't use to , but now most kids and teenagers do . 
  i hate halloween , but you just ca n't fight with tv channels ** and schools ** promoting a party with costumes and candies ... 
  an undisputed fact . 
  strong words for such a fuzzy concept . 
  you ca n't make an experiment and say `` catalonia is a nation with p < 0.01 '' or even point to juridical proofs as you can do with states . 
  so is disputable and has been disputed . 
  a pointless , never ending and absurd disputation nonetheless . 
  what i say is also applicable to spain as a nation , of course . 
  guilty of being republican , like thousands of spainiards . 
  your comment is just about easily verifiable facts but somehow is donwvoted .
