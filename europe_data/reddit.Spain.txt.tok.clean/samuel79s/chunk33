  wonder why ... 
  again , indulted ** by the republic ** , against whom he commited treason . 
  if you already know french wines are better , why should taste anything else , right ? 
  a friend of mine lived for some years in toulousse , and her advise was : never argue about wine with french people . 
  they may never have tasted a spanish wine , but they are absolutely sure that french is better in every aspect . 
  even in price/quality ratio where the difference is huge . 
  btw , he declared independence during the spanish republic , so the catalan autonomy had to be temporally suspended and he was judged and sentenced to prison , ** before the start of the war ** . 
  he was later indulted , i think , i do n't remember exactly . 
  there is no need to secularize the schools . 
  in spain , catholic schools which get money from the state have n't a word about admittance . 
  they must accept who the state sends to them . 
  it 's obvioulsy rare that muslims take their children to those schools , but it happens . 
  depending on the region , they can still discriminate by sex , though ( only boys/girls schools ) . 
  this is because hate clouds your reasoning abilities . 
  it 's not a day for glorifying the spanish empire , but for celebrating the cultural ties among iberoamerican countries , spain included . 
  it 's only the national day of spain since the eighties . 
  fuck columbus . 
  today 's the first day of the * fiestas del pilar * in zaragoza !, 
  that 's the alcoraz 's cross ( basically st. george 's cross + the moor 's heads ) . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/the-battle-to-lose-independent-vote.html ), 
  yes . 
  i do n't know why , but assumed that was born as an independent kingdom from a county with a soft vassalage to some kings , like aragon or navarre . 
  til portugal was part of the kingdom of leon ... 
  1808-1814 [ spanish war of independence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peninsular_war ), 
  do you need to troll every thread that mentions spain , even if has nothing to do with catalonia ? 
  how mature . 
  is ugly as hell but very informative . 
  thank you !, 
  your president wanted to negotiate about something that 's way way outside the legal framework , in the middle of the worst financial crisis of the 50 years . 
  this was 3 years ago , until then he was asking for a different tax system for catalonia , never independence . 
  then junqueras threatened with declaring independence unilaterally , block spanish trade to france and not pay the part of the spanish debt proportional to the size of catalonia . 
  artur mas lately acquired that discourse . 
  i wo n't discuss about the rest of your comment , because this was about who threatened first , and in which circunstances , not about the threats . 
  you seem to know everything about such an uncertain scenario , makes me envious . 
  it was an example which i thought representative , there are obviously more , but my time is limited . 
  i could have reminded how the els segadors was played together with the spanish hymn in the olympic games . 
  i remember that , i 'm that old . 
  in those days it seemed that the catalan problem had been cordially solved at last to the joy of everyone , in contrast to the basque one . 
  you seem to prefer hyperbole and outrage to actual conversation . 
  say which part you do n't agree , and i will try to rebate it or concede , but lol is n't an argument . 
  [ artur mas in 2010 ] ( http://www.lamarea.com/2015/09/23/artur-mas-en-2010-jamas-iniciare-un-proceso-de-independencia-dividiendo-en-dos-mitades-a-cataluna/ ) * i will never start a process of independence in catalonia which divides the country in two halves * are you really so young that you do n't remember how things used to be ? 
  jxsi : sit to negotiate with me what i have no legal right to do , but i think i deserve , or you will be pretty fucked up . 
  gov : you will be pretty fucked up also , and even with an agreement , it wo n't be pretty ( = out of the eu ) . 
  jxsi : omg !!, 
  are you threatening me ? 
  you so fascist !!, 
   we 've tried for 40 years to negotiate with the spanish government and they have said no to everything . 
  how can you lie so blatantly ? 
  the spanish constitution was redacted also by catalan nationalists , and only 5 years ago mas was strongly against building a independent catalan state . 
  imho , a bank run is a pretty probable scenario in case of a unilateral declaration of independence , but certainly not only limited to catalonia , but the whole spain . 
  also , junqueras and mas have played strongly the card of not paying the debt and destroying the spanish economy by blocking spanish trade . 
  that question has a lot of responses . 
  i will try to offer mine . 
  the strictly legal . 
  the spanish constitution says that the sovereignity resides in the spanish people as a whole , and every spainiard has the right to vote on the matter . 
  someone from toledo owns as much of barcelona as the other way around . 
  in my opinion this is not arbitrary . 
  a country in which any part of it may leave at any time is severely handicapped . 
  for example , the only olympics games that spain has hosted have been in barcelona . 
  if people of the rest of spain have imagined that catalonia could leave , they would never have supported it . 
  but also , may be other spanish cities would n't have been so well suited to host the olympics and would n't have been chosen as a host , so the net result is a lose-lose . 
  apply that criteria to any decission in which the goverment must favour one region in detriment of another . 
  we are in the middle of a high unstability period . 
  spain is just recovering of the worst economic crisis of the last 50 years , and coincidentally with the worst years , independence support has gone from < 30 % to aprox 50 % in 4 years . 
  such reivindication should show that the support is sustained in the time , and be settled in a period of stability , and not a product of populism in a period specially sensitive to it . 
  specially given that the catalonia has a very high level of autonomy already . 
  in summary , i 'm not oppossed to a referendum , but the timing and the way is being handled is completely unfair . 
  the spanish goverment is also performing pretty poorly , but that 's obvious to anyone and probably has been analyzed already . 
   just check the votes in the catalan parliament of cs and pp . 
  not a single time have they disagreed . 
  [ counterexample ] ( https://www.ciudadanos-cs.org/prensa/ciutadans_cs_condena_el_fascismo_en_una_propuesta_del_parlament/6255/ ) , and not a trivial one . 
  * we support it , because nobody has n't still explained why calling it marriage should be a problem for the rest of the citizens . 
  a heatmap with intensity linked to population density would be still more insightful . 
  i would like to try to make one , but i do n't know where to get the results with the right granularity . 
  btw , there are [ some guys ] ( http://www.bcnisnotcat.es/ ) who argue for making a different spanish region with the greenest areas ( barcelona and parts of tarragona ) . 
  government guarantees are useful when a single bank has problems , but not in case of a generalized bank run . 
  if the catalan goverment declares the independence , and it 's not just a rethoric one but actually retains the control of the police forces and tries to push forward , the spanish state will have to declare the state of exception ( or suspend the autonomy , but i do n't think that can be enforce alone ) until seizes their funds , arrests the sublevated policemen , etc. . . that massive instability could end in a bank run for sure , and not limited to catalonia . 
  a bank run in catalonia will trigger one in the rest of spain , or at the very least , in its surrounding areas ( where i am ) . 
  yes i think that the situation is that bad . 
  may be i 'm being conspiranoic , but i think the possibility is real . 
  btw , i was thinking in getting a couple of thousands or a similar amount ... by now . 
  i think that a bank run it 's not impossible if the government has to declare the state of exception or something along the lines . 
  they are going to declare independence . 
  they are too invested to withdraw a millimeter . 
  it will work or not , probably not , but they do n't care about the consequences . 
  i 'm thinking on putting some cash in a safe place , just in case . 
  i 'm not kidding . 
  edit : spelling and ... why the downvotes ? 
  i 'm not and mostly agree . 
  fair enough, 
  they are against an unillateral declaration of independence . 
  they have been very clear about it . 
  may be , but if a social media company with a dominant position starts to censor what they find offensive under an arbitrary framework we have a problem ... 
  yeah , allowing them to play the victim 's card surely will help a lot . 
  they will blame the hypocrisy of the system which apparently promotes the free speech only in one direction and they will right . 
  and then is when they will start to be dangerous . 
  free speech has to have well defined legal boundaries , applied by judges , not by corporations . 
  ahem ... * i disapprove of what you say , but i will defend to the death your right to say it . * ... 
  is that something of the past ? 
  afaik , coordinated manoeuvres between different armies may and have taken place , but the troops keep their structure and only the very high level ranks of the armies have to interact .
