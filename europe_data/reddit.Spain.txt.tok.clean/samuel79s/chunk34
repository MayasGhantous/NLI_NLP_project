  you ca n't expect that kind of english proficiency among spanish , french , germans or italian troops . 
  at all . 
  that 's unrealistic at the very least because the language barrier ... and it 's not hard to imagine other scenarios which can be a source of problems like allegations of promotions based on nationality or quotas , etc. . . 
  chill . 
  he was referring to the ellectoral system only . 
  even accepting your ~ ~ clarivident ~ ~ clairvoyant analysis as unquestionable truth , , apprehending a foreign ship in international waters without any kind of international mandate is what would be labeled as * piracy * if the offender would n't have been the us ' ~ ~ bitch ~ ~ best ally ... 
  i do n't know if the uk had any specific interest , but surely choosing between siding with another commonwealth nation or with the eu was n't a hard decision at all . 
  a full scale war is out the question , but it was later revealed that canada has plans in place which involved bombing spanish fishing ships . 
  trade sanctions would have been a interesting path to solve the thing civilly but the uk voted against them . 
  you are almost there ... 
  the british of course !, 
  ( and ireland ), 
  the [ turbot war ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/turbot_war ) , where spain almost went to war with canada over a fishing dispute . 
  the eu as a whole sided with spain with the exception of ... you know who . 
  just what spanish teachers needed to reinforce their authority in the classroom , parents questioning their judgment and calling to rebellion against them . . yay !, 
  not true , she has been * detained * ( not arrested ) after having ignored two court summonings to declare over the flag incident . 
  the detention has been ordered by the court , and performed by the catalan police . 
  after declaring before the judge she has been released . 
  no big deal . 
  edit : btw , she refused to take down the flag from the municipal facilities during an ellectoral period . 
  the bot . 
  it 's a stupid bot which replies with flower emojis to comments which contain the word `` flower '' . 
  in zaragoza is a pretty recent phenomenon , but it certainly happens in some neighborhoods . 
  strangely enough my guess is that the popularization of the holiday comes from the proliferation of `` bilingual '' schools . 
  those use any anglosaxon custom which may look appealing to kids as an opportunity to bring them into the language ( they do st patrick related things too ) . 
  lucky you, 
  i 'm all against signaling individuals who are n't guilty of any actual crime , no matter what their ideas were . 
  let 's imagine than after the fuss over his presence on the island some nuthead decides to attack him or his relatives . 
  which good would come out of that ? 
  none at all . 
  the gag law derogation should be a no brainer , but the bridges in the opposition seem to be broken . 
  even that could be difficult . 
  if there is no budget for the next year , there will surely be new elections , but it does n't have to be a good thing . 
  the other party with government experience is broken and podemos is going to the trenches and imho , they wo n't be an alternative with that attitude . 
  it 's disappointing , but the new government is pretty weak , and any decision will have to be backed but at least three parties . 
  it 's a whole new thing in spanish politics and an opportunity to build long lasting pacts . 
  good things may still come of this , let 's be optimistic . 
  woody allen has said several times that the spanish dubbing of the characters he plays is even better than the original version . 
  may be they are doing it and all this media drama is just an elaborated smoke screen ... / s, 
  exactly . 
  it 's not about legality but about ethics . 
  aaaaand we have a winner of our daily contest * turn a spanish related thread into a catalan shitfest * sadly we ca n't award you points in the relatedness category , but you went off the charts in demagogy and whataboutism . 
  well done !, 
  there were also isolated incidents like this before the brexit . 
  [ example ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/31zpha/spanish_couple_viciously_attacked_in_york_for/ ) . 
  given how the attacker moves , my bet is that he 's drunk/high . 
  i do n't know shit about finance but does this mean that states which lent money to spain are getting a higher return than the market average ? 
  it was n't such a bad investment after all , was it ? 
  it 's reassuring to realize that politics is also fucked up in other countries too ... 
  i would vote him which proofs he is n't the right candidate ( i always vote losing parties ) . 
  they also promised to avoid a third elections round . 
  but ... but ... we have flairs now !, 
  wow , i did n't know the verb * to moon * , it 's a nice addition to my english words ' repertoire . 
  honestly i have n't done the math , but by then the economy was shrinking and now is growing , and there have been tax cuts so there is more margin to increase them again . 
  my bet is this time most the money will come from the income front and not from the expenses one ... 
  i hope . 
  that 's a drop in the water compared to 2012 cuts ... 
  definitely not true in spain 's case . 
  the article is written by another historian , maria rosa de madariaga , who basically argues that payne has experimented an unexplainable ideological shift towards fascism ( suggests a possible financial motivation ) . 
  as a formerly renowned historian he is being used by a neo francoist breed of historians led by the weird pio moa to legitimize their frantic views . 
  she also criticises also his franco biography , which she argues ca n't be based on novel primary sources as claimed by payne , and which has been apparently debunked chapter by chapter by modern historians . 
  she also cites payne 's position on the controversy regarding the spanish law on historic memory , which payne 's defined as the leftists revenge . . 
  sincerely , i do n't know , lots of vitriol poured by another apparently well regarded historian . 
  whatever is going on it 's weird . 
  the second republic is a romanticized symbol for the left , thanks to 40 years of francoism , so criticizing it is seen as francoism apology . 
  payne has been pretty harsh with the second republic last times ' and that 's definitely one of the reasons . 
  aside from that , and i 'm not an expert on the matter , i have read in several places that in late times he has evolved into a franco supporter . 
  he has even supported the works of pio moa who is almost universally considered a rabid francoist . 
  if you can read spanish , [ this article ] ( http://www.cronicapopular.es/2016/03/una-manipulacion-de-la-historia-al-servicio-del-franquismo-el-caso-de-stanley-g-payne/ ) gives some clues . 
  so even if they early works were well regarded once , they are n't anymore . 
  i have to warn you that payne is now considered a francoist by spanish left , so you wo n't get very far citing him . 
  that 's not true , there was a revolt in asturias when the ceda won the elections . 
  it served as a testing ground for the civil war , and a dangerous precedent which was used to legitimize the coup . 
  valencians and their paella , andalousians and their virgins ... better not to mess with them in either case . 
  * nacionalidad * is a term which the constitution itself uses for regions/countries ** within spain ** , [ reserving the term nation strictly for spain ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/nacionalidad_hist%c3%b3rica ) , even if they informally mean the same ( as fraga itself dixit ) constitutionally do not , hence the recourse ( which is was even dismissed as i said before ) . 
  so no , it 's not the same . 
  by a ( juridical ) mile . 
  sorry but the andalusian statute does n't define andalusia as a nation so your comparison does n't apply . 
  let 's stick to facts , please . 
  it 's not a castilian flag and i was n't the only one who disagreed . 
  i have given you concrete examples . 
  the euro per prescription was turned down in madrid ( ruled by pp ) , the anti evictions bill in andalusia , the social emergency bill in aragon ... 
  it 's an everyday occurrence and the court sometimes rules in a direction and others in the opposite . 
  is there any way to change your opinion or you already have chosen what to believe ? 
  the nation thing was in the preamble and ** still is ** since that part of the laws has no juridical value , constitutional court dixit ( have you read the amendments ? 
  put down the pitchforks for a while , the ruling still is n't official . 
  this should be flaired because the title of the article has changed . 
  not true . 
  regions and government are constantly going to the constitutional over competence conflicts . 
  surprisingly , sometimes even the same party is ruling in both ( no joke ) . 
  there are lots of recent examples . 
  the `` euro for prescription '' tax , anti evictions bill , etc. . . 
  corruption and cronyism are specially rampant in small councils and at the province level ( the province is an administrative division which basically assists to those small councils in several ways ) . 
  aggregating those small municipalities in bigger ones and merging provinces into regions [ 1 ] would greatly help to increase the controls over them but the rural spain opposes to those changes . 
  the parties which more strongly rely in those votes ( pp-psoe ) will never make that step . 
  [ 1 ] to add insult to injury 7/17 regions contain a single province while keeping both administrative levels . 
  if we have to believe what people write in their resumes , the most common level of proficiency is `` conversation level '' , whatever that means . 
   i hated those trips as a kid with my mother , having to buy new clothes as i was growing up . 
  believe me , you have to be grateful for not having had to experience primark ; it 's a fucking nightmare ( for parents and kids alike ) . 
  the party will be run by a committee .
