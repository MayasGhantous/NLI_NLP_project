  27 times the content , it 's a great deal . 
  i know you are n't probably interested , but others may be . 
  nobody is so stupid . 
  my bet is that he did n't want the brexit to succeed but just get enough votes to keep the flame alive so he could live the rest of his life milking the confrontation . 
  we still have to see if it will have started by that date . 
  please no , do n't invent things . 
  spain official statement is that 's an integral part of spain , as tudela or guadalajara . 
  morocco what ? 
  you 're making no sense . 
  please try to make a sensible argument . 
  repeat with me . 
  ceuta has never self determined nor spain has ever supported or denied its self determination . 
  it has been part of iberian kingdoms ( portugal included for centuries ) . 
  so , if morocco has claims about it because is surrounded by ( nowadays ) moroccan land , what has that anything to do with spain statements about self determination ? 
  oh i understand , you are comparing ceuta with crimea or something like that . 
  there is only a caveat , ceuta have n't self determined ** ever ** . 
  it has been part of iberian kingdoms for more than a millennium . 
  do your research please . 
  i do n't get the point you are trying to make , if there is even one . 
  there is no difference between ceuta , catalonia , madrid or albacete from the spanish standpoint , they have no right for self determination . 
  period . 
  so your ` spain accepts self determination when they benefits it ' is bullshit . 
  of course it makes sense . 
  there used to be tariffs , currencies , and other barriers for trade , so rich regions benefited from sharing a market with less productive ones which could n't compete with them ( through devaluation for example ) , even if they had to return part of their wealth through progressive taxes . 
  but now there is a single currency , a single market , no barriers but also weak fiscal transfers through cohesion funds , so what 's the point ? 
  none !, 
  let 's make independent richer regions in europe , what could possibly go wrong ? 
  this is the last independentist one , top execs from catalan government have promised . 
  mark their words .

  i wholeheartedly disagree . 
  madrid 's government is a mess , with several factions fighting between them , and a handful terrible pr screwups in their account . 
  also , i do n't think they have managed to improve the main problems of the city like the garbage collection one . 
  on the other hand , colau ( and her husband if the rumors are right ) has a cohesive group and has managed to attract psc to her side ( which has ruled the city for the most part of the time since the transition to democracy ) , and she has done well in several complex situations ( gracia , metro strikes , independence related affairs , etc. . . ) . 
  big organizations like those have lot of momentum and it 's hard to change course quickly , but i think barcelona 's government is steering in the right direction while madrid 's one not so much . 
  to my surprise , i have to add . 
  i had completely opposed expectations for both majors .

  . net was n't open source a decade ago , so your formidable application depended upon proprietary software which could have had a terrible date triggered bug awaiting to silently corrupt your data . 
  and you could not fix it . 
  i get your point , but off the shelf software makes sense in lots of areas . 
  sure , investing in tailoring your key application , which gives you a competitive advantage could make sense . 
  writing your hr app not so much , unless your company competes in that sector . 
  chill . 
  i did n't want to generalize and that 's why i 've said * some french people * and in other comment i specified it only happened to us twice while we had dozens of interactions . 
  i also ignore why they did n't answer in french , i just can speculate . 
  eta , aside from miltaries and policemen , targeted journalists , businessmen , judges , `` politicians '' ( sometimes merely members of a party without any public role ) , and even drug dealers or anyone who they considered they deserved it . 
  their means of attack ( like the bomb car ) where far for surgical and sometimes attacked places with just some odds of having policemen or civil guards in their vicinity . 
  usually the bombs included shrepnel in what was a clear indication of their intention of making the most possible damage . 
  they also did n't hesitate to attack the targets with their families ( zaragoza civil guard facility attack killed 5 kids and 6 adults ; vic 's one also 5 kids and 5 adults ) . 
  another * modus operandi * was to warn of a bomb in a public place ( hipercor , terminal 4 in barajas ... ) with little time for evacuation , which sometimes was true but others not . 
  that way they could deflect blame into security forces , which is what they have unshamefully done with hipercor 's case . 
  eta deadliest attack was very probably corona hotel 's one in zaragoza . 
  we will never know , since is part of the toll we had to pay for our transition to democracy . 
  anyway , there was a shift in eta 's strategy in the 90 's but before that they performed plenty of indiscriminated attacks . 
  one important distinction with islamic terrorists is that they had n't any desire to die , which reduced their avalaible options . 
  as a side note , a lot of people ignores that there was a [ jihadist bombing ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_el_descanso_bombing ) in 1985 in madrid , with 18 casualties . 
   we think it 's great you 're trying to learn the language belgian ? 
  it 's admirable , indeed . 
  well this happened only twice for dozens of interactions . 
  we have been in france a couple times after that and nothing similar happened . 
  in my limited experience some french people have very little tolerance for bad french . 
  my wife ( my gf when this happened ) speaks some french [ 1 ] but almost no english . 
  while being at a shop in paris , she adressed the clerk in french who proceeded to answer in english ( ? ) . 
  obviously she did n't understand a word , so i had to translate what he said to her in spanish . 
  we did this foolish circle ( french -  english -  spanish ) for the 2 or three sentences we needed to buy what we were looking for . 
  i 'm still wondering what happened . 
  some days later a ground assistant addressed us in the airport in french . 
  she answered in french , but at the moment the guy detected the spanish accent he switched to ** a very broken spanish ** . 
  as it seems , he could n't tolerate to hear moliere 's language mistreated that way and thought that torturing cervantes ' one was better . 
  [ 1 ] i would say even decent . 
  actually the basques are the indisputable winners at that . 
  actually , i was thinking in the americans ... just joking , of course i referred to * independentist * catalans . 
   the uk , on the other hand , was n't even the uk until the act of union in 1707 , psssst ... are you sure you want to use this argument ? 
  because some guys with starred flags would love to argue about when spain started to exist , it 's one of their preferred subjects ... 
  no , you are mixing unrelated things . 
  1 iglesias ran a political tv show in hispan tv ( and obviously got paid for that ) . 
  this is undeniable . 
  2 podemos was bootstraped financially by iranian and venezuelan money . 
  there are supossedly , investigations about this but nothing has been proved and several courts have dismissed it . 
  unproved and pure speculation until now . 
  now , when iglesias was asked why they accepted to run a show in a tv station funded by a government which was a gay-killing theocracy he answered [ this ] ( http://okdiario.com/espana/2016/01/12/pablo-iglesias-justifico-que-la-dictadura-irani-le-financie-para-desestabilizar-a-espana-52633 ) , where he draws the parallelism between lenin 's sealed train and himself and hispan tv . 
  edit : grammar, 
  corbyn could try iglesias ' answer in the uk . 
  that ? 
  oh , remember when the germans sent lenin to russia in a sealed train during the ww1 to destabilize it ? 
  this is mostly the same ... next question ? 
  what about yob ? 
  the wiktionary says it 's mainly used in the uk , australia and new zealand ... 
  i know is somewhat offtopic , but as a spaniard i ca n't avoid to see the parallelism with podemos ' pablo iglesias ( he produced several tv shows for hispan tv , the equivalent of press tv in spanish ), 
  there is another angle to look at it , too . 
  if we consider that the objective to maximize is increased years of life per dollar , healthy people are better investments . 
  which makes no sense whatsoever .
