  smokers and obese people die young and fast from hearts attacks and aggressive cancers before 70 something , while healthy people do so at near 90 after a decade or more of progressive decline , may be suffering alzheimer , requiring expensive care and earning a state pension .

  probably is capped by the isp . 
  in spain you have offerings of 30mbps fiber . 
  well , may be after the initial disappointment for the brexit voting outcome , a lot of snp-backers are realizing that things were n't as easy and rose-tinted as brexiteers were arguing and are drawing a paralellism with snp promises during the independence referendum . 
  does this makes sense ?

  if the alternative is corbyn , they could probably kill some babies on prime time , and still win the election . 
  it 's not bad , just misleading . 
  from the makers of * spain is not andalusia * .

  most spaniards do n't give a fuck about ceuta and melilla in the geopolitical/financial sense since those cities are a liability and a source of problems more than anything else , but they would obviously care about the people who lives there in case of an invasion . 
  in the front lines ? 
  probably not , i would be cannon fodder since i do n't have any military experience . 
  heck , i have never even shoot a real gun . 
  by age i should have attended to compulsory military service , but luckily for me , i asked and was given a moratory to end my degree before having to and in the interim president aznar abolished it . 
  but in the case of an invasion i would obviously put my skills to work for the country . 
  it 's not even a choice , the constitution clearly states spaniards have the obligation to defend spain .

  what 's the worse it could happen to them ? 
  being deported ? 
  the only nature friendly way of wiping your ass is using a stone . 
  seriously , wtf !, 
  where are the `` catalonia is not spain '' trolls when you need them ?

  asked , but whether he ~ ~ achieves it ~ ~ actually tries or not , is a different story, 
  ceuta and melilla are n't covered by nato , so there was no point . 
  the u.s. mediated between both allies and that was it . 
   ( i 'm not catalan for being born in catalonia ) civil vicinity is a thing , and would be perfectly sensible to take it into account on for those kind of matters . 
  the `` biggest theoretical threat '' is actually some attack from morocco to the canary islands or ceuta/melilla . 
   and the provisional spanish governtment which opposes those claims has not been able to conform a new government since last december . 
  so what ? 
  i have explained why is relevant in the next paragraph . 
   new elections ? 
  like elections in december and again in june ? 
  no , obviously regional elections like in september . 
  i do n't understand what conclusion you want to draw ... is it some kind of competition of about government stability or something ? 
  it 's not relevant in any way for this matter . 
  to put things in perspective , the catalan government which makes those claims has been unable to approve the ** 2016 ** budget , and has planned a motion of confidendence for september . 
  so , new elections in catalonia are n't exactly unthinkable , and independentism may be seeking some confrontation in order to start that race in good shape . 
  what 's happening now is that the constitutional court has explicitelly prohibited the debate over the conclusions of the workgroup on the independence roadmap , but if/when it takes place what the court can actually do is unknown ; they are uncharted waters and there are few juridical precedents . 
  btw this is the playing field : courts , motions , etc. . . forget anything like war . 
  stay tuned .

  well , you speak as if that proto catalonia were a single political entity and not a bunch of counties glued together by vassalage pacts . 
   which country ruled over catalonia before ramiro 's daughter married ramon berenguer ? 
  this is to messy and infected by politics to have a honest conversation , but the response to that could be the french kings , with some buts and ifs ( they did n't rule the territory but the catalan counts where their vassals ) . 
  also , that 's just a part of modern day catalonia . 
  tarragona and lleida have their own history . 
  edit : regarding the aragonese laws , they where written in several languages , including but not exclusively , in catalan . 
  you can use tor while connected over an vpn , yes . 
  the reverse ( vpn over tor ) ... it depends , but probably does n't make a lot of sense . 
  about detecting it , depends of the kind of technology the vpn uses . 
  ssl-based vpn 's will look like more normal https browsing , while ipsec based ones are detectable ( and blockable ) through simple inspection . 
  i think vpn traffic is less suspicious because is used extensively by corporate users and does n't provide complete anonymity or access to the dark web . 
  tor attempts to disguise itself as https traffic ( that is , normal encrypted browsing traffic ) , but , while it 's hard to do in real-time due computational constraints , it can be distinguished from `` normal '' https traffic [ through statistical methods and heuristics ] ( http://www.netresec.com/?page=blog&amp;month=2013-04&amp;post=detecting-tor-communication-in-network-traffic ) . 
  so , if the turkish government is capturing traffic and analyzing it afterwards , it could determine that some ip is using tor which is pretty suspicious by itself , since it could be anything from normal browsing to a real-time chat with the coup members , and reveals an a clear intention of evading monitoring .
