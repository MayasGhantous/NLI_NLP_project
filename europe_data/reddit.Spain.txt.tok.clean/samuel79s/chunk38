  well , using tor is suspicious enough by itself and iirc identificable through deep inspection , while reddit is vanila https , and is hard to impossible to know which subreddits you are really visiting . 
  i would probably open a normal tab with a fake account , subscribed to dummy subs , and an incognito one with the real user , while trying to interleave traffic from both . 
  it 's not infallible , but more subtle than using tor , imo . 
  this childish name calling exchange has no place in / r/europe . 
  stop it or you 'll end banned . 
  this warning applies also for / u/gkat . 
  of course . 
  but if we have unamuno as a reference , and i think we should , we should avoid romanticizing the second republic and look to the past in a less bigoted way , which sadly is the complete opposite i see in this thread . 
  unamuno was no fan of the republic , either . 
  at least in what ended being . 
   there was n't any curtailment of democracy or civil rights then , was there ? 
  the situation ca n't be summarized in a post , but the republic was far from being stable . 
  there was already lot of violence from both sides and people here are simplifying too much to my taste , although unarguably the republic was better than the regime the civil war brought . 
  oh , of course . 
  i do n't know why i misread your comment . 
  there is photo of him in the slideshow , in the ninth slide . 
  [ i do n't know ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9al5n5g4q8 ) the war ended but the repression continued for a while . 
  yes , it was fueled by the fact that the main plotter ( general armada ) was king 's former mentor . 
  if i 'm not mistaken it 's a court 's decission , not a goverment 's one .

  imagine the deficit levels we could reach !, 
  copy-paste of my own comment in a similar thread in / r/spain at the theoretical level , i have no problem with that ( i would gladly give up to the spanish national symbols in exchange of the common ones , for example ) , but at the administrative and political level that would be an insurmountable task , bigger than the german reunification , with little to gain since we 're already share a single market . 
  we already have problems with fiscal transfers inside spain to add a new region with 10 million inhabitants and below average income : sitting here i can already hear the yelling from that hypotethical universe ... not going to happen . 
  this comment is fairly inappropiate given the situation and bordering provocation . 
  do n't follow this route .

  yeah , the `` the aragonese historians want to steal the flag '' . 
  whatever , mate . 
   that marriage went through the male line , not the female line . 
  not at all , in aragon existed what was called `` marriage at home '' , read a bit . 
   and obviously rulers are announced with their biggest title and kingdom  county . 
  obviously that contradicts your first point . 
   never wondered why the senyera , the flag of the house of barcelona became also the flag of the crown ? 
  the origin of the senyera is disputed and any intellectually honest person would acknowledge that both thesis , the aragonese and the barcelonese , are unproven . 
  but you choose to believe the version which suits your nationalistic feelings , which , given your record , it 's hardly surprising . 
  that triggered me more than i 'm willing to admit ( i 'm aragonese ) . 
  do n't feed the troll .

  we are not going to be bailed out for paying the pensions , it makes no sense . 
  those will be lowered or the taxes raised . 
  there has been a massive wealth transfer from the younger generations towards the older ones due the housing bubble and how the pension system works , but nobody has had the guts to truly reform the the latter : there are just too much voters at that age group . 
  it will happen anyway , and the sooner , the better .

  yes , at least that 's what spanish media has reported . 
  and please , do n't call her `` yours '' ; every southern european thinks of her as a second mother ... / s, 
  do n't hold your breath ... 
  but angie called mariano for encouraging him to speed things up , so there is a chance this time . 
  when a portuguese and a spanish need to communicate , the spaniard speaks in spanish , which the portuguese will mostly understand as is , and the portuguese in portu\u00f1ol , which is a dumbed down version of portuguese spoken with spanish phonetics . 
  when you say that ... do you include caixa catalunya scandal in the pack or do you keep a separate account for catalan screwups ? 
  catalan independence is only 18 months away ... and has to be true because it has been at that mark for the last two years .

  spain is n't blocking anything , our pm it 's an idiot , but now it 's just stating the obvious : you need to be a sovereign state to join the eu . 
  the uk is the member here , not scotland . 
  not only that . 
  i guess they would like to have some special relationship with the uk , while being inside the eu ; it would be absurd to make a border between scotland and england . 
  there are a lot of loopholes there that must be covered . 
  i 'm all in about letting scotland going back to the eu as is legally and rationally possible , but pretending that 's a matter of saying `` you guys do n't need to leave '' is delusional .
