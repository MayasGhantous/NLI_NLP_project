  i wish the best for scotland ( and for the rest of the uk ) but this is a bit premature and not well thought . 
  i guess scotland would like to keep a free market and free movement with england ... how are they going to reconcile that with being part of the eu ? 
  we still do n't know in the terms of the relationship between eu and the uk . 
  it could be very well a norwegian alike deal , which is far from being a huge change .

  no , that 's not true . 
  no it 's not . 
  it seems so in seats , but in % of votes they have lost very little . 
  i wish i could upvote you a thousand times . 
  the rebirth of the popular front has helped them massively . 
  basically was pp or the commies ... 
  they do n't even have absolute majority in the parlament and need the support of a extreme left party . 
  they could n't approve the budget for this year , and a confidence vote is planned for september . 
  with this electoral landscape , i think the catalans would want to vote again . 
  mostly the same results , +2 % erc , -2 % cdc http://resultados.elpais.com/elecciones/2016/generales/congreso/09/index.html but i expected some big changes due the brexit . 
  i 'm reporting the results for catalonia because i wondered if brexit could have been a massive boost for independentism . 
  what we see is that both parties which form the government coalition there get a mere 31 % ( with cdc , which has been the ruling party for decades , it 's at pp level , which is irrelevant politically there ) . 
  i think that we will see elections in catalonia this year . 
  this just shows test any referendum where the winning side gets less than 60 % is a political failure . 
  cameron has lost both referendums , not just this one . 
  * shall you live in interesting times . 
  * ( chinese curse ), 
  there is no need to rush , but it 's a bit unbelievable that the uk pretends now to delay their departure and use it as a negotiating card ... 
  it looks like that brexiters did n't expect to win and want to buy some time . 
  so you are sovereign to remain in the eu for as much as you want ... 
  this is getting sillier every minute . 
  hmmm the stereotyped catalan and scottish are a bit ... ahem ... * frugal * coincidence ? 
  you read too much in my words . 
  i 'm not blaming anyone , i 'm not saying that nationalists ' do n't have the right to `` sell '' their votes however they want , i 'm explaining the situation . 
  the article hypothesizes about how portugal could be a model for spain , when the parlamentary composition is very different . 
  any coalition different from the conservatives + social democrats just does n't have enough seats to form a government . 
  it 's just that simple . 
  no , it 's not a model for us because we have nationalists/separatists parties which will vote against anyone , right or left , who does n't promise them something they want . 
  and giving them what they want could be very well a political suicide for mainstream parties . 
  * joachim l\u00f6w will guard your crown jewels * bonus points , nobody will ever want to rob ( or even touch !! ), 
  them for ages . 
  well deserved , spain 's defense was shit and the croatians could have scored before . 
  letting a defender kick the penalty was n't the wisest of the choices too . 
  i would love to let this thread die , but i have the impression that you truly believe in your lack of bias and think that your critics are fair and proportional , which imo is far from the truth . 
   both cabacas family and quintana went to the institutions were ciudadanos already was to protest about police brutality , which imo can be related to police brutality in venezuela cabacas and quintana were n't harmed due police brutality , at least not in a comparable sense to police using firearms agains ralliers . 
  those cases are about the approval by the administration of theorically non-lethal weapons which resulted in death an serious wounds . 
  or may be misuse of the equipment by the policemen which turned non-lethal devices in lethal ones . 
  but there was n't a deliberate intention of killing by the police , was it ? 
  what 's ciudadanos stance in the issue ? 
  it 's [ easy to check ] ( https://www.ciudadanos-cs.org/prensa/jordi_canas_felip_puig_ha_perdido_el_control_del_departamento_de_interior/5595/ ) ( [ 2 ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20131218/54398362698/el-parlamento-catalan-aprueba-la-supresion-de-las-pelotas-de-goma.html ) ) in quintana 's case . 
  do n't you agree ? 
  fair enough , let 's critizise then . 
  i ca n't find references to cabacas case . 
  ciudadanos had n't presence in the basque country by then , but if they can go to caracas to critizise maduro now , they could have had an opinion on the issue then . 
  it 's a valid point . 
  if you still want to judge politicians by their emotional responses it 's your choice , but ca n't agree , that is . 
   as for syria : http://www.abc.es/espana/abci-pp-y-psoe-temen-guerra-siria-reviente-campana-electoral-201511190255_noticia.html as i see the supported the idea of ground troops in syria as long it 's approved by the un and the nato . 
  surprising but not a big deal really . 
  in fact , it 's a rather unpopular opinion indeed : at the first televised decapitation his ellectoral prospects would plummet . 
   if you want to think this is just hate for the sake of hating that 's your choice the problem here is that you mix and match anecdotes and critics to policies and is hard to see a coherent discourse farther than the simple bashing for the sake of it . 
  he cried in a very specific moment ... an anecdote which should n't have more importance . 
  critizise him for his approach to the venezuela thing , not for that . 
  the people you cite was wounded/killed by flahs balls . 
  he did n't cry about it ... so what , what 's your point ? 
  what 's c 's policy on flash-balls ? 
  is it critizisable ? 
  is anyhow relevant to the thing we were talking about or you brought the point just because ? 
   after the paris attacks he was quickly willing to send ground troops to syria with some dubious idea of an un mandate as far i remember , he supported france 's response which was n't about ground troops but only `` surgical '' bombings . 
  as most european leaders did , btw . 
  even assumming you are right , i do n't think it 's unbelievable that he felt truly moved by a such sad story and that he did n't fake their tears . 
  people do n't care , we have enough problems already to lecture others about how they should fix theirs . 
  the thing is , is pretty unbelievable that a coallition that supports chavism ( sometimes openly , sometimes veiledly ) could go mainstream in spain , so the other parties are attacking that apparently weak flank ( unshamefully even ) . 
  it 's not working ; the bar is so low already that people despise some politicians and do n't care about anything else . 
  we have a pm who has received undeclared money , and a ruling party who has financed its ellectoral campaigns with bribes . 
  rajoy has awakened this `` monster '' and i despise him doubly because this reason , added on top of his own faults . 
   i doubt anyone in ciudadanos cried when i\u00f1igo cabacas died or when esther quintana lost an eye why do you stop there ? 
  what a crappy attempt of whataboutism . 
  the thing is simpler . 
  op says rivera is crying `` for venezuela '' , while he cried when a mother was describing how her son was killed . 
  humans respond more emotionally when they directly emphatize with victims than when they only intellectually know that a fatality has happened . 
  that 's what i was saying , nothing more , nothing less . 
  i think that 's a pretty understandable reaction , but op and you wanted to bash c 's regardless . 
  your choice . 
  a mother telling how her son was shot dead by the police could move to tears to most people , let it be in venezuela , spain , italy or any other country ... 
  psoe has renovated their structures after zapatero and accepted they did things wrong . 
  it 's true that in andalusia has n't happened that , but it will only do when the andalousians decide so , given it 's a federal party . 
  i would n't recommend anyone to vote them in a regional elections there , but for the central government , i do . 
  he said exactly that , see 17:49 in this video http://youtu.be/btiyap0imeo, 
  i bet it 's a recent graduate and it 's an entry level job ... am i wrong ? 
  how old is he/she ? 
  which sector ? 
  yeah , because their politicians are really shining right now ... you hater . . 
  oh ... my ... goodness ... 
  i ca n't even ... 
   trust me , there 's maybe two or three dummies out of the 5 million podemos voters that say that venezuela is an example . 
  that 's true ... 
  the problem is those voters are also the founders .
