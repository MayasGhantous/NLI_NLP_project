  may be it 's not legal but it 's pretty easy to obtain . 
  well , the question is about the country , not about its inhabitants . 
  so you may believe that britain is a well run country but the british are dicks , just saying ... 
  honestly , i have liked british in the uk , but not british in spain . 
  ha ha , since germany scored 7 against brazil in the semi finals , nobody reminds your 5-1 in an irrelevant qualifying round . 
  thanx germany !, 
  * never let the truth get in the way of a good story * . 
  it was unbelievable , and rightly so . 
  so it 's like the gibraltar of italy ... 
  true . 
  the word * tercermundista * ( proper of a third world country ) used to describe a public service is very common ... 
  * translation ( roughly ) : * listening to a man , easy is to known where he ( first ) saw the sun ( = was born ) , * * if he praises england , he 's english * * if he speaks bad of prussia , is french * * and if he speaks bad of spain ... is spanish . 
  it 's a fair point , and it 's true that ther is an asimmetry here , but i think that legally are two things completelly unrelated , and handled separatelly . 
  abortion is a `` right '' that allows a woman to avoid becoming into a `` human incubator '' . 
  if humans were oviparous , probably abortion would n't be accepted , but pregnancy is something that happens at the woman 's body and has huge impact over her . 
  the most used argument of feminists regarding abortion is that women should be granted the right to control what happens in their body . 
  the fact that women could actually want to avoid having a child more than gestation itself is seen as secondary , since enters the realm of the unprovable . 
  once the process has passed the point under which abortion can be performed , both parents are equally responsible of child 's well being . 
  the roman empire ? 
  ding , ding , ding ... we have a winner !, 
  ** during the early stage of the battle , when the spanish forces had retreated from different defense points to regroup in the larger fortress of san lazaro , feeling victory in his hands vernon dispatched a messenger , captain laws , to britain to inform king george of their victory on may 17 . 
  up to 11 different commemorative medals were minted [ 94 ] in london to celebrate this `` victory '' . 
  in one of these medals admiral vernon was shown looking down upon the `` defeated '' spanish admiral don blas de lezo who appeared kneeling down . 
  for your flag ... winter war ? 
   one country does and eventually gets huge dividends out of it . 
  in fact , it was pretty bad . 
  it wrecked the economy for centuries . 
  no , a battle . 
  i will give you the king : george ii . 
  it 's a bit obscure reference , i admit . 
  commemorative coins were mint before the event , which at the end , it did n't happen . 
  hint : spain-britain . 
  * them * is pp voters , no catalans . 
  thank you . 
  oh great , fighting nonsense with more nonsense . 
  * it was you who started this ... no , it was you ! ... 
  you ! . . 
  you ... 
  more ! . . 
  we 're not friends anymore ... *, 
  i do n't know what you are suggesting , but there were tourist at both sides . 
   i do n't see them doing anything different . 
  do you see mariano rajoy going to a eu meeting and telling them `` yes it is all ok for catalu\u00f1a to join the euro '' ? 
  i do n't well , if merkel says so ... 
  jokes aside that 's a pretty hypothetical scenario , but you seemed to imply , as other people here have argued , that there is deliberate intent of damaging catalonia for no other reason than hate . 
  that 's absurd , and even for this government . 
  the way of getting rid of them is to try to understand their electorate , not to bashing them with questionable claims . 
  oh come on . 
  i do n't like this government but stop demonizing it . 
  it strengthens them more . 
  no way . 
  we , modern-day spainiards ( and i include catalans here ) are pussies and would not take a gun for almost anything in the world . 
  portugal could invade us tomorrow and would n't blink an eye . 
  though our grandfathers were pretty die hard . 
  `` you first '' ... seems a wise strategy . 
  * may you live in interesting times *, 
  til , scottish pounds exists ... 
  resistance is futile , you will be assimilated ... 
   he currently resigned from his party leader position `` to avoid creating a negative image for the party '' ; he did not however resign from his prime-minister position , apparently this `` negative image '' thing is only problematic for the party , not for the country . 
  politicians never cease to amaze me ... 
  thank you . 
  i posted yesterday a similar link , but since it had n't independence in the title it did n't gain traction . 
  i believe that there is some people eager of speaking about this issue , so here it is . 
  at least we wo n't be acused of censorship , we evil spainiards ... / passiveagressive, 
  you can try to do this , but in my opinion greece was on the verge of becoming the poorest country of europe for a generation . 
  ~ ~ gamble ~ ~ play with fire and you will be burnt . 
  haircuts are n't deserved , just assumed when unavoidable . 
  i have to say that when i saw her buying her own groceries in a supermarket , she gained my respect . 
  i ca n't think of any spanish ( right wing ) politician doing the same . 
  if it was a pr stunt ... well done . 
  edit : another thing i like from her . 
  she 's a phd in chemistry !! . 
  spanish prime ministers and important politicians have usually a background in laws . 
  more rarely economics or medicine and very rarely science/engeenering . 
  the most prominent exceptions are javier solana ( physics ) , in a lower range , borrell ( aeronautics and economics ) or rubalcaba ( chemistry ) . 
  you are mixing things that are unrelated . 
  the subsidie 's purpose is to encourage women to continue working or searching for a job ~ ~ ( iirc the requisite is `` situacion asimilada al alta '' or `` being in active or in equivalent status '' , like receiving an unemployment subsidie ) ~ ~ < - false , you need to be actually working . 
  kindergarten is pretty expensive , around 300 + eur/mo and lot of women have the though decision of choosing between a low paying job , may be 900eur , with more than 300 eur of new expenses or keeping at home taking care of her child ( probably enjoying it more and with less effort ) , and may be applying for other subsidies or doing some money `` on the side '' . 
  and even if the woman has a high salary i think it 's a good idea to subsidize part of kindergarten 's cost . 
  there are other subsidies for people with low income , which could apply to mother 's that ca n't work - this one specfically has a different purpose , and i think that it 's fair and a step in the good direction . 
   [ as exemple the maternity subsides at spain ] ( http://www.consumer.es/web/es/economia_domestica/familia/2012/03/01/207458.php ) : a maximum of 1200 euros year for each child under 3 years old . 
  only working women can apply for it you can never get more money than the one that they pay as income tax . 
  what 's wrong with that ? 
  that encourages working mothers . 
  i would prefer free kindergarten or something like that . 
  much worse was the baby check of 2500 $ regardless of income, 
  28 sep 2015 `` check if / u/marranyo got a seat . 
  blackmail . '', 
  the problem has been there since the 90 's , so it is n't exclusive of pp 's goverments . 
  edit : [ since 1988 to be exact ] ( http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2015/05/07/actualidad/1430997604_281032.html ) . 
  yes , a galician cunt . 
  more detailed info [ here ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-14-822_en.htm ) and [ here ( spanish ) ] ( http://www.expansion.com/economia/2015/05/07/554b6b47e2704ea36e8b456b.html ) . 
  the key sentence : * it appeared that the intervenci\u00f3n general de la generalidad valenciana ( iggv ) had systematically sent incorrect information to the national statistical authorities over many years . 
  as well as failing to report considerable health expenditure , the iggv had not respected the accrual principle , required under national and eu law . 
  moreover , reports by the regional court of auditors , flagging these problems , and comments of the regional ministry of health , seemed to have been ignored . 
  i was being sarcastic ... 
  i like the character too , he 's a sort of a buffoon who dares to say things that anyone more does n't . 
  but at the same time i wonder if he has more charisma than talent . 
  i 'm sure that greece produces every drug needed for any serious condition , and of course produces ct and mr scanners and any other conceivable medical equipment that is needed for modern health care . 
  wow , just wow .
