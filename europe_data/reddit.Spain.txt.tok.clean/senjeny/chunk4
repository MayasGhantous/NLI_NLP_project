  i 'm not an expert in the matter , but i suspect that there 's * a lot * of people working in agriculture fields in spain without a contract , and not only romanians , but also from spain and other places . 
  a substantial portion of spain 's underground economy are just day laborers without a contract . 
  as to why they do it : shortage of regular jobs . 
  how did i not know of this one ? 
  subscribed , thanks . 
  `` without the approval of the local people ? '', 
  sorry , but you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  i think you 're just applying your own country 's recent history to another entirely different reality . 
  the world does not work that way . 
  your ethnic criteria about who should vote is both wrong and frightening , and even catalan independentists would never use it . 
  which is funny considering that the majority of scots , catalan and basques do n't want independence . 
   last i heard about it spain had some serious democratic issues care to elaborate ? 
   some brexit campaigners have long said that britain should aim to negotiate a comprehensive new relationship with the eu , seeking access to markets without submitting to eu rules or open migration hey , that 's a good idea !, 
  tomorrow i 'll go to my gym and i 'll tell the manager that i want to negotiate a comprehensive new relationship in which i have access to the facilities without paying for my membership and without having to comply with the gym rules . 
  kinda like every language ever . 
  this subreddit being / r/europe , it can be safely assumed that , unless otherwise stated , we are talking in european terms . 
   the only thing aragon and castille shared was the ruler , nothing else . 
  really ? 
  nothing ? 
  there were no cultural , economic , religious , military or demographic ties at all . 
  only two monarchs . 
  wow . 
   people in aragon could n't go into the americas , for example , beacause that was castilian land . 
  simply untrue . 
  the castilian city of seville was the only port authorized to trade in the new world , but that does not mean that people in aragon could n't go to the americas . 
  of course they could . 
  many did . 
  what are you talking about ? 
   that 's why when aragon was annexed there was a sudden surge of catalans trying to make money in the new world ( the indianos ) oh my god . 
  the `` indianos '' emergence ocurred everywhere across spain during the xix century , ( asturias , galicia , even the canary islands ) not only in catalonia . 
  and it has nothing to do with the annexation of aragon . 
  that 's like saying that the uk does not exist because it consists of four countries with different laws , parliaments , etc , which only share a ruler . 
  wishful thinking vs reality . 
  oh , on the contrary . 
  i 'm not sour at all . 
  in fact , my point was exactly the same as yours ( just with a little pinch of sarcasm , which you do n't seem to have understood ) : it 's stupid to go back into history to make territorial claims . 
  i 'll make sure to use the < / s  tag next time . 
  okay , let 's do this , then . 
  we give ceuta and melilla to morocco and you guys give us california , nevada , arizona , new mexico , texas and florida . 
  deal ? 
  or maybe you should keep it but make sure it 's not a tax haven anymore . 
  1 ) you can have anything between a [ 170 m ^ 2 , 3 bed house ] ( https://www.idealista.com/en/inmueble/27886136/ ) for 42.000 $ and a [ 460m ^ 2 , 7 bed house ] ( https://www.idealista.com/en/inmueble/35743106/ ) for 350.000 $ in rural guadalajara or travel just 150 km to madrid and pay those same 350.000 $ for a [ 50m2 , 1 bed apartment ] ( https://www.idealista.com/en/inmueble/34937096/ ) in a nice neighborhood . 
  2 ) this is the [ largest spanish spider ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0dzv1mn.jpg ), 
  the fact that the perpetrators had committed dozens of killings prior to the hipercor bombing speaks volumes about their intention to not kill anyone in that particular day . 
  sure . 
  and we all know the best way to * not * kill people is placing a bomb in a shopping mall . 
  also , there 's 829 people that would want to discuss your `` spread terror without killing people '' argument . 
  but they ca n't . 
  because eta killed them . 
  now it 's okay to go bombing shopping malls provided you call in advance ? 
  maybe we can place a bomb in your town , call a newspaper and then boom !!!, 
  and if someone dies , totally not our fault . 
  how about [ bombing a shopping mall and killing 21 people ] ( https://devastatingdisasters.com/hipercor-bombing-1987 ) ? 
  or [ bombing a barracks for civil guard families ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/12/world/11-killed-by-bomb-in-northern-spain.html ) and killing 11 , including 5 children ? 
  or maybe kidnapping a 29 year old councilman and [ executing him ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miguel_%c3%81ngel_blanco ) because you do n't like his political party ? 
  does that meet your criteria ? 
  well , then i guess ~ ~ catalonia ~ ~ half of the catalans can take up arms and try to defeat ~ ~ madrid ~ ~ the other half . 
  ftfy, 
  and do n't forget the whole movement is based on this simple idea : `` we are totally okay with receiving eu fundings from richer areas of europe but at the same time we do n't want our taxes to fund poorer parts of spain . '', 
  sooo ... macgyver was not so wrong about the basques after all : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt_-m_e39tm, 
  we have a similar salad in spain and for some weird reason we call it `` russian salad '' . 
  actually , it 's `` ensaladilla rusa '' , which translates to `` russian little salad '' . 
  the fierce gaze of a lion in heat . 
  the fringe . 
  the golden necklace . 
  the four button checked jacket . 
  the fc barcelona tie . 
  there are so many reasons to upvote that photo . 
   have you read the text on the image ? 
  yep . 
   also , why are you mentioning the eu ? 
  because i wanted to ? 
   do you mean that french guyana is in europe , not america , because it 's part of the eu ? 
  take a moment to read my post again . 
  the answer to your question is no . 
  spain 's highest point is not mulhac\u00e9n . 
  mulhac\u00e9n is the highest point in continental spain , but mount teide , in the canary islands , is higher ( 3,718 m. ) one can argue the the canary islands are not geographically in europe , but are nonetheless part of the eu . 
  7 - restore the roman empire but this time keep an eye on those barbarians up north .

   vatican , pope francis , 10\u00a0300\u00a0000 well , i think that number pretty much ends the debate whether this is a list of most followed twitter accounts * in * or * from * each country . 
  and , incidentally , opens the debate about whether pope francis ' twitter account should be considered vatican or argentinian . 
  also , fernando torres in solomon islands . 
  that 's ... weird . 
  stop . 
  you had me at ` food and copious amounts of wine ' . 
  in fact , you had me at ` table ' . 
  we all know what that means . 
   is n't construction way better paid [ than the other 3 ] and not prone to shit like only being scheduled 15 hrs / week ? 
  that was quite true here until 2008 . 
  many of the now unemployed people used to work in the construction sector . 
  then the housing bubble burst and the construction sector basically collapsed . 
  do n't be so sarcastic . 
  it 's a sin . 
  hence the `` except '' . 
  i agree lunch at 12 and dinner at 7 is maybe stretching things too much , but lunch at 13 and dinner at 8 is not so uncommon .
