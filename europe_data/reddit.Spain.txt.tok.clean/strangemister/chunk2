  but you 're right . 
   yugo i knew someone would say that , and nato and mad did n't stop them either !, 
  and also that is why i said * a war between two eu members is impossible to happen . 
  * not a war in europe . 
  think what you must , you can fault everyone on that , not only the eu . 
  the eu has prevented historical rivalries from rising again , like between the french and germans , but of course that is because they were in the union/its creators . 
  because i will live in a student dorm and not in my own house ? 
  and also public display of flags is kinda frowned upon in spain ? 
  by having many friends ... 
  actually in spain the spanish flag is always coupled with the eu flag to represent democracy , so it is actually kinda like a good nationalistic element . 
  tldr : when there is a copycat version of windows that looks exactly the same ie : unity , looks similar enough and behaves similarly to windows . 
  sad it 's development has been stopped . 
  i 'm a missionary ? 
  you said nobody in their right mind would use linux on a desktop computer . 
  and windows and mac also have many flaws . 
  so you can make a joke , i can not . 
  thanks for calling me names too !, 
   i tried linux for quite a while . 
  its was n't working very well . 
  the windows ( and osx ) ui is just a lot better . 
  to each their own , you 've been accustomed to it so it 's hard to switch back . 
   if you want a usefull ui use windows or osx ( even tho it pains me to acknowledge apple here ) . 
  you 've never tried an auto-tilling manager , have you ... you 've never learned about cinnamon too , [ with an ui that is 90 % similar to windows ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cinnamon_\\ ( software \\ ) )  if you want to talk about the average joe then you got to accept that he will be unable to use linux cause linux is hell if you are not tech savvy . 
  nearly no one will switch os to play games or use other programs that simply do n't run on linux . 
  chromebooks !, 
  and that is why i said i hope gpu passthrough will come soon and i am platform agnostic . 
  besides , with the exception of adobe products , very specialized software and games , you can find pretty much everything on linux . 
  also , you say it 's hell , but schools our over spain , my country , have linux and nobody complains . 
  in fact , if you preinstall an os with a browser on a computer and just give it to someone , they wo n't complain too !, 
  and also , linux is android , fyi , it 's so bad !, 
   that simply do n't run on linux . 
  steam on linux has lots of games , fyi , and i hope things will change soon  then why are you telling people to switch ? 
  i am platform agnostic but i want the best . 
   nope . 
  source i 'm a dev . 
  [ nope too . 
  i am an aspiring dev and provide facts , like this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ugvgh/is_linux_better_for_programming/ ), 
  i was responding to this * saying that we should be proud of someone because he is of european or x descent is wrong for obvious reasons . 
  * fyi, 
  okay , i do n't care if you have been insulted , i just reminded you . 
  and yes , but we have a common eu policy for god 's sake , be it on trade or in another field . 
  it especially helps small nations like malta or croatia get a leg up in the international field . 
  that is why you also see the eu represented in various international organizations in addition to its respective countries . 
  sure , try to live in a disunited europe were everyone has a different foreign policy and you 'll see how nato works . 
  both nato and the eu helped bring peace to europe . 
  you should read a little bit more about your country 's history , and see how well liked the germans were in the 1950s , for example . 
  political association favored the creation and unity of other organizations , like nato . 
  and yes because nato was an organization created by the us ? 
  * he has superior european genes and culture and we should be proud of him * come on, 
   i really think that the eu 's role in continental peace is beyond overstated in light of the two things our friendly brit pointed out nato would n't be able to exist without the eu , it could crumble without the unity that the eu brings in political terms ( foreign policy , even if you ca n't see so at first ) . 
  and mad has n't helped to bring peace in many countries all over the world . 
  going by that logic , we should be thankful that russia has nuclear weapons and so on . 
  not by ethnicity , but because he was born , raised , and grew up here . 
  saying that we should be proud of someone because he is of european or x descent is wrong for obvious reasons . 
  [ yes ] ( http://starecat.com/content/wp-content/uploads/how-to-make-your-own-french-flag-white-surrender.jpg ), 
  when he created linux he was a european . 
  i beg to differ , windows ui is familiar and that is why you think it 's easy to use , but hope i remind you that many linux distributions have similar guis like mate so you 'd have no problem in adjusting . 
   why would anyone in their right mind use linux on a destop pc that makes like zero sense . 
  hahahahahaha continue to be spied upon by microsoft , continue to pay for something that always has the same goddamn problems , and i could go on , linux distros are free and can do 90 % of people 's needs . 
  besides , there is a reason why chromebooks are successful , nowadays for the average joe 90 % of what they want to do in a computer can be done in a browser . 
  and also , linux is objectively better for developers ( especially if you couple it with an auto-tillign wm like i3 or 2bwm , and i could go on about its benefits ) . 
  what , windows console is really bad when you into ssh into something ( i assume you 'd use ssh ) it does n't matter what type of `` console '' you have ? 
  other benefits include `` you update your software when you update your operating system , so you do n't have to individually manage updates for individual applications , meaning everything is more secure for the average joe without him being boggled down with tireless . exes '' and freedom as in speech . 
  [ ca n't wait for gpu pass through ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/2z0evz/gpu_passthrough_or_how_to_play_any_game_at_near/ ) ca n't wait until windows dies either too . 
  it is an utterly terrible operating system i only use to play battlefield . 
  and i am platform agnostic , i do n't care what operating system you use , but saying `` why would anyone in their right mind use linux on a destop pc that makes like zero sense '' is utterly foolish , dumb , and proves that you are quite ignorant in regard to this topic . 
  also , linux does n't suffer from bsods .

  * bad nationalism , sorry . 
  and i know !, 
  maybe for your future/present children hahaha . 
  whatever works !, 
  nah , going by that rule , you 'd see fashion thingies with flags from all over the world , and let 's be honest , the only ones that have caught one are uk , us , and canadian thingies , because of guess what , they 've propagandized and so on and so forth . 
  the eu is an institution disliked by many . 
  does n't help either that we europeans ourselves identify first with our country and not europe . 
  i am trying to change that , to maintain `` country '' identity but with europe first . 
  also , we europeans do n't like to identify with our flags because they remind us of nationalism . 
  yes , of course , of course . 
  [ fyi , germany will take over the world , guess because of who ] ( https://m.imgur.com/4zykfzy?r ), 
  hahaha , i do agree with that , it 's definitely not made to wear since it 's a flag !, 
  i beg to differ . 
  the eu flag is the same as the one used in the council of europe , which created it . 
  afaik , the uk is not leaving the council of europe and nobody cares . 
  then buy eu curtains with little golden stars . 
  yes :d also use linux for non-software specific activities like browsing filthy microsoft pleb . 
  it 's open , free , and created by a european . 
  what do you mean ? 
  undeniable , but the eu has also played a major role in uniting us all and bringing peace . 
  a war between two eu members is impossible to happen .

  just a tip , if you wan na avoid lots of tourists , do n't visit the city in june/july/august , 
  how did i take on side ? 
  so saying something that objectively happened and putin himself admitted ( green little men , russian forces ) is taking sides ?
