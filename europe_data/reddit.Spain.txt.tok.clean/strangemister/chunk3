  refusing to talk about it and actively dismissing any evidence around what happened wo n't either . 
  is n't dual citizenship prohibited for ukrainians ? 
   now crimeans try to preserve their ukrainian citizenship to have visa-free access to eu . 
  passport center in kherson is overloaded worse than any other as it 's closest to crimea . 
  not to change topics , but the same here in spain will happen in catalonia . 
  nobody in their right mind will stop being spanish . 
  it 's the sad truth . 
  independence , we do n't wan na be like you , let 's join another country etc , etc , etc. . but when it comes down to mah benefits , hey , i need them , i need them !, 
  i am a rightful citizen of that other country . 
  but didnt you just shout you hated it and it 's an evil virus of satan ? 
  yeah , you 're a hypocrite mate , that is what you really are . 
  i will send some green cute little man too !, 
  do n't worry , they are friendly , they do n't bark !, 
  what what what are you talking about !, 
  men are natural alpha macho predators , very intrinsically violent , women are cutesy good and innocent individuals , no woman in her life could kill another person . 
  women also can not be crazy . 
  back in high school ( meaning the last 6 years of my life ) i had to attend a hell of a lot of `` conferences '' about the subject . 
  the first one , okay , i will shut up and refute to comment on the topic and continue to live my life without getting into any type of conflict and in peace , but right around the third one is when i decided i need to speak up . 
  i remember it was a dude from the university of valencia giving us a speech on how media fails to portray women that have been killed by their husbands `` properly '' . 
  best part : i asked him so can you show us a newspaper that did it right ? 
  he was fucking speechless and then i asked , can you compare so to a report about a man that has been killed by his girlfriend or wife . 
  he was also speechless . 
  and i also argued to him , that since nobody cares about that , nobody cares to report men that have been assassinated , then obviously it will be hard to find good examples . 
  this is the problem . 
  it 's hembrismo , not equality , i hope more people realize this soon . 
  when a woman gets killed by her husband you have 10.000 protests outside . 
  when it 's the husband that has been killed by his wife , nobody bats an eye . 
  also i just love the reaction people had a the `` conferences '' when i challenged their view of the world . 
  you could see them live getting progressively more triggered and using more of their dogma to try to avoid arguing with me . 
  anyways , i am getting just too mad . 
  jos\u00e9 mota is a national treasure . 
  hope we do the same soon in the valencian community, 
  to each their own . 
  too posh for me . 
  why do i hate stephen fry 's voice ? 
  he just sounds so annoying to me , lol . 
  wholeheartedly agree . 
  damn . 
  accurate . 
  i do n't know , maybe they were tired of tourists and my blonde hair is n't particularly spanish so you get the idea ? 
   badabronx what, 
   closes at 8 same in spain in non-major cities lol, 
  yes yes yes that is what i actually meant before same in spanish with huerta , 
  just by chance , does horta mean field ? 
  who are those ? 
  one of eu one of eu one of eu, 
  r/victoria2 is leaking, 
  for obvious reasons :d, 
  [ try to visit it at night ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jfmpgkp.jpg ), 
  then use \u00e0 instead of \u00e1  did you visit the castle  ? 
  * j\u00e1tiva in spanish , with a j  from where are you from originally ? 
  my gateway to spain and europe \u1555 ( \u141b ) \u1557, 
  it fucking sucks . 
  no need to overthink it . 
  second point : come on , short men already have it bad without you having to tell so explicitly . 
  why 'd they have to use that type of car ? 
  that building fucking sucks aesthetically . 
  so we 're the florida of europe ? 
  i guess that explains `` some things '' ... 
  interesting article , 
  sadly , this is the direction ukraine is headed to , with its russian funded `` breakaway '' republics . 
  rankine . 
  i 'm sweating my ass off atm . 
  shut up please . 
  do n't make mah life more depressing . 
  seriously ? 
  ask gerard and you 'll see how spain will be * forced * to accept catalonia . 
  delusion at its best . 
  i think we should do a 12h an irc referendum and post it on r/europe and prohibit all other debates about catalon independence until `` if there is '' the constitutionally illegal referendum . 
  conclusion in catalan/valencian : [ _ la constituci\u00f3 me la passe pels collons _ ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-07zyx4raxom/uawf2x-dzmi/aaaaaaaadna/byxffhokplk/s1600/gif+animado+artur+mas+hace+lo+que+se+le+pone+en+los+collons.gif ), 
  absolutely . 
  king 's immunity though !, 
  king 's immunity : /, 
  yes \u2764, 
  nobody is ... then again , look at what the ex-presidents of france used to do ... 
  good for him , i mean , if you had the capability to do so , would n't you ? 
  i want to see the proof too :d i just hope this book does n't get banned in spain , which it probably will because the king is `` immune '' ... 
  it happened to me too when i barcelona !, 
  i was also surprised , here in valencia waivers are n't that rude `` usually '' or `` at least most of the time '' and if they are , you can get an apology if something goes wrong . 
  so do n't apply the same standards to all of spain , please . 
  fuga de cerebros . 
  enserio ? 
  apart de que \u00e9s il.legal . 
  edit : xe collons !, 
  [ do n't even have a flag because you 're not a country ] x \u2764 \u2764 \u262e \u2763, 
  your constant xds and  too !, 
  you ca n't ? 
  tell that to the thousands of pro-independence catalans who will refuse to give up their spanish citizenship even after they declare `` we are independent '' because of course , losing eu rights and visa free access to countries all around the world , eh , nobody wants that . 
  [ thank god the spanish constitution prohibits the death penalty ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/capital_punishment_in_spain ) and our forces and the guardia civil try to avoid using guns as much as possible ( heck , in some parts of spain , policemen do n't even carry firearms . 
  [ btw , hope i remind you about this from your own country ( look at part 4 of article 51 ) ] ( http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/po00000_.html ), 
  my condolences . 
  more mental gymnastics . 
  there 's a constitution . 
  you do n't comply with the constitution , you receive proper punishment  no like we say in spain `` pajas mentales '' ( mental wanks ) needed !, 
  some people fail to see this , living in their dreams, 
  so much for eu ... 
  [ hi from the other side of the world that also uses che/xe !, 
  [ how about no ] ( http://perdonenquelesmoleste.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/rivera-burns-cs-pp.gif?w=1100 ), 
  like this ( not a joke ) we did n't gain much of you because of poor management , you became independent because of the napoleonic wars . 
  that is it .
