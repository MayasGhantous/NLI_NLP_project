  we love your accent ( most of the time ! ), 
  what the fuck did i just watch ? 
  here in spain it depends on where you go to study and your major ex ; if you want to study cs in catalonia it will cost you 2500 $ per year , in valencia 1500 $ and in andalusia 800 $ . 
  as long as it is complaint with the constitution ? 
  whatever you find around the mountains is good enough to light up a paella fire :d, 
  the difference is that being a short male is viewed negatively by a big portion of the human population . 
  i 'm average , not short . 
  nostalgia attack . 
  oh my god two different individuals have different heights and are part of human evolutionary variation . 
  they were there , but had a bug . 
  good for you mate . 
  now , if you are not interested , fuck off , instead of being an obnoxious moron . 
  [ yes ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/w9wsk4teu1ajw/giphy.gif ), 
  you did n't consider this big factor : people are lazy . 
  i do n't care about what my leaders do on their free time or their method of transportation as long as they are good leaders & not corrupt . 
  you 're french , i do n't care about you , you [ frog eaters ] ( https://imgur.com/k86e7jb ) . 
  [ :d ] ( http://data.whicdn.com/images/101293438/large.gif ), 
  the more you know :d, 
  yes , the `` people used whatever they had to make paella '' is indeed correct , but paella it 's like a spanish tortilla ; - there are a thousand ways to do it , but the traditional recipe is the gold standard everyone loves , and that is from where all the nazism/talibanism comes from . 
  ps : imho , as i said before , valencia or nothing , the size thingie eh , just try to find a `` reliable '' place , use google :d, 
  first of all , yes , at this moment , yes , you like it or not . 
  secondly , we are talking about a traditional dish from the valencian community , not catalonia . 
  yep , and real valencians only use carrasca wood . 
  upvote for el palmar ch\u00e9 :d, 
  when a friend of mine from japan went to a spanish restaurant in nagasaki , he ordered paella and sent me a picture of `` the thing '' . 
  `` the thing '' was green . 
  i had a heart attack . 
  there 's always a limit , pal . 
  yep it is , but you are our son/descendant coopted by the us , so i give you a pass :d, 
  of course !, 
  go back to the euskadi !, 
  get out !,

  go away american heretic , we do n't have that shit in europe . 
  we can prepare our own food , and we 're not a bunch of lazyasses . 
  [ real heresy detected exterminate ] ( https://m.imgur.com/zxedoqi?r ) in all honesty , do whatever you like ; i 've tried many types of rices for paella and imho the best one is the typical/traditionally used [ fallera one ] ( http://www.lafallera.es/productos/caldo-de-carne-y-verduras/ ), 
  ] ( http://dotb.tc0bblfg2d81v7kurec.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/michael-sattler-burned-at-the-stake.jpg ) i told you i am a paella nazi/taliban and also nobody expects the spanish [ inquisition . 
  ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/706/062/9ac.jpg ) like we say in spain , zero tolerance . 
  sorry if i am being brutal, 
  i am going to be honest and straight forward : i am a [ paella ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/paella ) nazi/taliban . 
  paella is life . 
  if you ever visit spain , unless you do n't have the possibility to take a quick and cheap train ride to valencia from madrid , barcelona or any other popular tourist destination in spain , do not eat paella outside of the valencian community/valencia , i beg you for the lord of the sacrosant god that created the university and all of us/evolution . 
  paella is not only about paella . 
  sure , the flavors are incredible , the rice is so amazing that you instantly get an orgasm upon your first bite coupled with the fantastically well placed little sourness feeling you get from the little drops of lemon juice you just gave to your beautiful and dear paella . 
  paella is also about socializing , about sharing , about that feeling of oh , this is amazing and we all know it , about how you get that pleasantness coming from your taste buds and reflect it upon your family members and friends by creating beautiful relations and moments , moments that can only be experienced through paella . 
  paella in short is life . 
  paella , for us valencians is a way of enjoying this world . 
  paella is the result of many civilizations walking upon our lands and giving and sharing their best to all of humanity . 
  paella is not only life , but also a philosophy if you do n't have the possibility to come to valencia or spain , then try to make paella in your own . 
  practice . 
  at first it may be hard , at first you may overburn your rice , but when you get it just right , that rich combination of flavors , oh gee , you will realize what i am talking about . 
  but remember , nothing beats a paella made in valencia . 
  nothing . 
  so come visit us and try out . 
  you will not regret it . 
  long live spain , long live valencia , long live paella !, 
  afaik the youth does n't speak dutch properly anymore and instead use some kind of pseudo dutch english to communicate between each other . 
  tldr ; we think it 's them , the shape of the `` things '' resemble the turbines very well but ca n't say anything `` surely '' because they `` covered '' with a plastic wrap . 
  good for greece/athens finally something positive for them . 
  is the georgraphy of athens a hindrance to the industry though ? 
  afaik , is n't athens quite `` mountainous '' ? 
  it was 38c where i live yesterday . 
  fuck you . 
  hope my anger is understandable, 
  i 'd also add all the other slavic nations . 
  * cons : may step on shit because some random individual `` just could n't hold it anymore '', 
  you think that 's bad ? 
  my friends have been saying despacito since a couple of months ago . 
  i will go shoot a rabbit ( legally of course ) if this continues and make paella with it to shut em up at least temporally . 
  edit : you are invited to attend the fest too i need help ... 
  hey considering the fact that it 's pronounced despa-s-ito then you know ... let them exist ... long live proper distinci\u00f3n co\u00f1o . 
  let 's avoid to begin with then , shall we ? 
  the carlists ( yes they still exist ) made it their own . 
  [ you know the `` scene '' ] ( http://clv.h-cdn.co/assets/15/26/1435082200-she-shed-reeding-nook-0615.jpg ) . 
  you 've seen the movies where everyone has an american or british flag hanged on one of their room 's wall . 
  and i say _ enough _ . 
  it 's time to show some real european identity proudness . 
  we should all have at least one room in our homes with an eu flag hanged on the wall . 
  it 's time to show to show those non-eurs that we are proud of who we are . 
  and yes , i am doing all of this because i am going to college and what to remake myself . 
  either way , all hail our germanoverlords , i mean the eu . 
  but no seriously do this !, 
  help foster something that has brought peace for over 60 years of our european history . 
  yes ? 
  browse my account for confirmation ? 
  i just wanted to point out that maybe that happens in their city/town , but in the cities/towns where i 've lived so far in spain , nope . 
  i can not assess this statement , i think you forgot your / s , 
  if it was n't for the internet i would not care at all . 
   true , healthy people stay healthy until the day they drop dead . 
  lol, 
  i do n't like his accent either ... 
  sure . 
  let the people decide .
