i have a question . 
  could the state of the roads , as well as the differing qualities you see in the picture , also be because of how long it takes the belgians to repair them ? 
  i mean , there 's this road that connects two towns in the area i live that has been under repair for 2 years . 
  two years to repair a few kms of a 50-km/hour road , and it 's still not finished ... oh , and they have to redo the bridge over the highway because they made some engineering mistake or other, 
  maybe it would be good for them to come back and let other people know what it 's really like before they go and fight for isis ? 
  you know , like a counter-propaganda thing where they tell their experiences to others who have romanticized the idea of what isis is . 
  and yes , lock them up in jail and make them pay for their stupidity too . 
   well done madrid , you 've outdone yourself in idiocy . 
  maybe we can be constructive and informed instead of insulting ? 
  and what does madrid have anything to do with this ? 
  it 's a constitution for a whole country , not a city . 
  if the majority of people do n't agree with the constitution , it can be changed . 
  that 's correct . 
  the constitution only allows regions to call for a referendum for cases concerning the region . 
  for cases that affect all of spain , only the central government can do it . 
  in this case , the court consider sthat catalonia separating from spain would indeed affect the whole country , therefore artur mas can not call for that referendum . 
  only way he could do it is if they changed the constitution , in which case you 'd still need a majority of political parties to agree on the changes . 
  he 's basically screwed legally one way or the other, 
  why ? 
  belgium , for example , is catholic and it 's got a high number . 
  i think this graph would be more interesting if we compared it to single males living on their own , and even cost of living vs salaries of people living on their own . 
  also , countries with a strong sense of family or group might prefer to live with other people rather than on their own . 
  being catholic could influence a certain sense of family , but not necessarily be the only factor as to why a country would culturally find the group more important than the individual . 
  it must be hard to invent a game and then get beat by everyone  the us did well and got far . 
  these last few matches of the world cup are brutal . 
  the schedule depends on the region you live in , the student 's age and also if you live in bigger cities vs smaller towns . 
  i was just giving a rough estimate . 
  holidays seem to be similar to portugal . 
  here is an article fyi : http://spain.angloinfo.com/family/schooling-education/school-schedule/, 
  yep . 
  i believe they get a long break for lunch , siesta and recess between 12-15h ( aprox . 
  ) , so it 's not too bad . 
  also , in spain at least , students ' day is long ( 9am-5 or 6pm ) so they have longer summer breaks . 
  it would be interesting to see which students have more hours of school . 
  i think people with lack of education might have a harder time than most to learn another language . 
  it requires skills that they may not have acquired when young , such as capability of study , forming patterns , critical thinking , etc. 
  some people have these skills naturally , but others do n't , and it takes an awful lot of training for them to learn , especially at a later age . 
  i was there for work and this woman in an internet place spoke to me in catalan and would n't budge , so i spoke english . 
  i do n't do propaganda , i 've traveled enough to know that there 's the occasional asshole everywhere . 
  i have a few friends from catalonia , i 've worked with catalonians and all i can say is that they are great people . 
  they will only refuse to speak spanish to spanish people while in catalonia . 
  i 've never seen someone from there trying to speak their own local language in madrid because it would be downright silly since no one speaks their language outside their region !, 
  that being said , i do n't mind them speaking whatever language they want , as long as they do n't try to be insulting with it and just be natural . 
  i mean , if i see someone in madrid that clearly does n't speak spanish , i 'll try and communicate in whatever language we both speak . 
  some people in barcelona -- and the various flemish cities around brussels -- do n't seem to understand this simple concept . 
  this happened to me when i signed up in the zaventem commune when i first arrived . 
  it 's weird as a foreigner to see that they purposefully - and legally -- refuse to communicate with you , especially considering that i 'm new in the country and i should be given a fair amount of time to learn !, 
  the girl who attended me was actually embarrassed at not being able to be more helpful , but not her fault really . 
  i understand pride in one 's language and protecting it , especially a smaller language such as belgian dutch , but languages were created to communicate , not to separate . 
  spain 's cities are quite different and unique , but there is a type of building from the 1800 's is similar in all of them . 
  they 've got balconies and tall windows to let in the breeze . 
  the streets are usually narrow to keep the sun out . 
  a couple of examples : [ madrid ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/elc2q ) [ barcelona ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/e2lqe ) [ seville ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/ux3hs ) country houses vary from region to region .

  you do know that europe is not one nation , right ? 
  so you propose which brand of nationallism : the nazi regime , spain 's 40 years of dictatorship , mussolini 's , portugal 's , greece 's ? 
  there 's a reason why a lot of people in europe are reluctant to go to the far right and it 's because we 've already done it and it did n't exactly work out . 
  it goes against our current values , the ones we have to defend against any form of extremism . 
  it 's not coherent to say `` we want to defend freedom and tolerance by being intolerant and taking away your freedoms '' . 
  forgot to mention : the terrorists attacks were perpetrated mainly by muslims born in europe . 
  so closing european borders to immigration would do very little . 
  i do n't want to give the perpetrators publicity and i do n't want to click on news sites that report their identity . 
  the french press is only going to report the crime , not the person who did it . 
  all you need is : `` young person from syria '' or `` perpetrator had been fighting in syria '' . 
  it 's really not that hard to understand . 
  can we get some sort of flair on articles that identify terrorists ? 
  that way i can choose to not give the news agency more views by clicking on the article . 
  i do n't mind information on them , just not photos and personal details, 
  in brazil you have a big catholic community and a big evangelical community . 
  apparently evangelicals are super strict , not allowing dancing or drinking and are more fundamentalist than the catholics there . 
  protestants are not necessarily less strict than catholics at all - think bible belt in the us - it 's just that protestants tend to speak badly of catholics and vice-versa , so if you grew up in a protestant environment , you probably got a negative image of catholics . 
  having your head up your ass means that you 're oblivious to what the reality of the situation is . 
  and the reality is that the uk just lost bargaining power . 
  not just among regions but also left vs. right which is a hang-up since the xix century all the way to the civil war in the xx . 
  populists did gain supporters , but to the left . 
  and we 're not blaming foreigners for our problems when we have such thieving politicians . 
  maybe they 're referring to the only far right that got votes ? 
  our problems date before franco . 
  we keep fighting amongst ourselves , blaming whichever half of spain we disagree with instead of foreigners ... that 's how our many civil wars started . 
  according to this [ source ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/immigration-in-europe-map-of-the-percentage-and-country-of-origin-of-immigrants/ ) the majority of foreign born people in spain are from morocco . 
  that does n't include muslims born in spain but it indicates a fair number . 
  also , in the uk people have ( percieved ) issues against polish immigrants , so it 's not just about being muslim . 
  i believe that 's when you eat contaminated fish in the upper food chain , not breathing mercury . 
  the map shows mercury concentrations in the air . 
   because mercury occurs naturally in the environment , everyone is exposed to very low levels of mercury in air , water , and food . 
  between 10 and 20 nanograms of mercury per cubic meter ( ng/m3 ) of air have been measured in urban outdoor air . 
  these levels are hundreds of times lower than levels still considered to be `` safe '' to breathe . 
  source : https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=112&amp;tid=24 i mean , the map does not give you how much is in the red area , only `` more than 1.9 ng/m3 '' which could be 2 ng/m3 or 2000ng/m3 but we can assume you 're probably safe or we would be seeing lots of malformed babies being born in the red areas . 
  first off , please refrain from insulting me for no reason , it says less about you than me . 
  secondly , you have very painfully obviously never been around kids , so you can stop trying to have an opinion about something you have no idea about . 
  when you have kids , i guess you can happily tie them to a chair and build a bubble around them so they never ever get out of you control and be the ideal parent you are advocating for . 
  also , make sure they never leave the house and that your house is padded full of pillows with absolutely no glass , electric outlets , sharp corners , stairs , make sure the furniture is screwed in place lest they may topple anything over , make them wear a helmet anx remove shoelaces from their shoes in case they trip , heck , intsall rubber flooring so they bounce when they fall , do n't let them play with anything heavier than a cushion or they might slightly squish their little fingers , feed them cold food so they do n't burn and so you do n't have to use the stove or the oven ... then sit back and watch as the fruit of your loins i 'm sure grows up to be a well-adjusted human under your 100 % infallible parenting skills . 
  they do reach out and try to touch everything . 
  they are curious little creatures that are learning and it 's not a stretch to think they 'd just place their hands on a hot stove . 
  i 'm not sure you 've been around many kids but we 're not talking about rational adults that can be reasoned with and sometimes it takes a shock for them to remember not to do something . 
  that shock could either be a burnt hand or a spank , and as a parent you might find yourself in a quick moment where you are afraid for your child and may spank them to avoid danger . 
  we 're humans , we react and we 're not perfect , but you can distinguish when a parent has done something out of protection to out of spite and abuse , no ? 
  beating a child and spanking are two very different things . 
  a small slap in the butt versus using all your adult strength on a weaker person is just not comparable . 
  that being said , i think it 's a cultural and personal thing and having a government be too intrusive can be damaging to our relationship as a community .
