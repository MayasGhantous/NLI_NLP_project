  podemos ran primaries as well . 
  theirs were n't very competitive ( pablo iglesias won like 80-20 , with low turnout anyways ) , but it was the most open one , with the only requirement being to be registered on their website before the primaries were announced ( to avoid people from other parties sabotaging them ), 
  technically not impossible , just really really hard . 
  not to mention that , if felipe had had a boy , due to vastly outdated succession rules , his 2 older sister would be screwed , with the youngest brother inheriting the crown just for being a boy . 
  had that happened , we would have probably seen a reform by the harder method , as male heir  female heir is in the entrenched part . 
  to quote the constitution :  article 57 , section 1 : the crown of spain shall be inherited by the successors of h.m. juan carlos i de borbon , the legitimate heir of the historic dynasty . 
  succession to the throne shall follow the regular order of primogeniture and representation , in the following order of precedence : the earlier shall precede the later lines ; within the same line , the closer degree shall precede the more distant ; within the same degree , ** the male shall precede the female ; and for the same sex , the older shall precede the younger . 
  ** to be fair , at that time we might as well just screw the monarchy and become a republic ( again ) . 
  wonder how long it will last though ( first did n't even last a full year , second lasted 5 or 8 depending on whether you count the war or not ), 
  well , even without it , the pp would still hold a blocking majority for any kind of reform ( they have an absolute majority in the senate . 
  even in congress they hold more than 1/3 of the seats ( 117 is the minimum to block that ) ) in fact , the pp has been able to block any kind of reform since like 1986 or so . 
  the proces is still quite ridiculous though . 
  it should be at worst like 2/3 of parliament plus referendum ; without new elections . 
  similar to us . 
  we have a hybrid between the `` unammendable '' clauses of the german constitution , and standard flexibility . 
  most of the constitution requires only 3/5 of parliament ( or 50 % +1 in the senate +2 / 3 in congress ) ; plus an optional referendum if at least 35 deputies request it . 
  however , some parts ( iirc the monarchy and basic rights ) require 2/3 ; new elections ; 2/3 again and finally a mandatory binding referendum , so it 's much harder to take that route . 
  the constitution has only been ammended twice though ; both through the first method , and both to comply with eu regulations . 
  so , it basically changed nothing ? 
  i thought quebec is less for independence now, 
  is barcelona city more pro independence ? 
  no star : standard official flag . 
  not independentist white star over blue background : standard independentist flag red star over yellow background : left wing independentist flag ( used by the cup iirc . 
  maybe erc as well ? 
  yet valencia and the balearic islands keep voting for them . 
  especially valencia , where the entirety of the party has been convicted of corruption  .  what 's wrong with them ? 
  yeah , it 's not like the spanish government is working much better at the moment : / still , we do n't have pro business parties in coalition with anti capitalist ones, 
  well , my spanish history curriculum never went that far unfortunately . 
  technically speaking , catalonia has never been independent . 
  if you want to mention the kingdom of aragon ( which also includes valencia , the balearic islands and aragon ; the last one does n't even speak catalan  .  ) even that has n't been independent since the late 1400s or early 1500s ( marriage of the catholic kings / carlos i inheriting the crown ), 
  is canadian federalism actually bad ? 
  whenever i think of a federal country , the us is the first example that comes to mind ( they have a ton of problems , but federalism and states ' rights is n't one of them ), 
  well , there was already once an eta-ish movement there . 
  i could see one rising again if the situation gets uncontrolled : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/terra_lliure, 
  to be fair , i 'd say ciudadanos would compromise even less with the independentists . 
  the pp is n't completely against making a deal with convergencia to have rajoy as president ( as long as the deal does n't include a referendum ) . 
  though the example works better with the pnv and especially cc . 
  ( why does ciudadanos think cc wants to break spain is something i 'll never understand ), 
  to be fair , there has been seizable percentages of population for independence since like 2012 ( around 40 % ) . 
  it 's just now that they outnumber those opposed to it . 
  to be fair , girona is the most pro independence province ( and lleida ) . 
  barcelona is not really for independence . 
   what is spain going to do ? 
  most likely , first they 'll call upon article 155 first :  article 155 1 . 
  if an autonomous community does not fulfil the obligations imposed upon it by the constitution or other laws , or acts in a way seriously prejudicing the general interests of spain , the government , after lodging a complaint with the president of the autonomous community and failing to receive satisfaction therefore , may , following approval granted by an absolute majority of the senate , take the measures necessary in order to compel the latter forcibly to meet said obligations , or in order to protect the above-mentioned general interests . 
  with a view to implementing the measures provided in the foregoing clause , the government may issue instructions to all the authorities of the autonomous communities . 
  this basically means the regional catalan government would be deactivated for a while , and the government could give instructions to the neighbouring communities ( aragon , valencia and the balearic islands ) . 
  most likely they 'll just call the police to control the regional government . 
  if that dose n't work ( which would require the catalan government actually rasing arms against the rest of the country ) , then yes ; invade . 
  the spanish army has barely enough forces to defend catalonia from a decent army , but they can probably handle the situation . 
  most likely they 'll declare the siege state , then invade , making the `` tanks in barcelona '' meme true, 
  well , they definitely can ; in the sense that you also * can * kill people or throw yourself out of a skyscraper . 
  to be fair , they already did one , but no one took it 's results seriously . 
  they also attempted to take the regional election 's results as a referendum , but again , no one takes that seriously . 
  yeah , polls have been very inconsistent these days ( see : brexit , or spanish 2016 elections ) . 
  still , they do signal something probably . 
  pretty much . 
  however they are very ambiguous with how that federal state would look like . 
  i do n't know how the other parties respond to that , but all except the pp support reform . 
  well , if you want to get super duper technical , there 's a way to pass an ammendment with lower votes . 
  first amend how the constitution is ammended , then ammend the part that prohibits independence . 
  each part would `` only '' require either 3/5 of both congress and the senate , or an absolute majority in the senate plus 2/3 of congress ; plus a referendum in each part if at least 35 deputies request it . 
  it 's still super dirty though . 
  plus , the pp can still block that route anyways ( they have an absolute majority in the senate ), 
  the brexit vote did n't make them have any second thoughts ( hell , has n't scottish independentism risen after brexit anyways ? ), 
  what probably made them have second thoughts was the pp conservatives ( very weak in catalonia ) , rising on the rest of the country . 
  in fact , they won in all autonomous communities except catalonia and the basque country . 
  even at the constituency level ( provinces ) the pp still won everywhere except catalonia , the basque country and 3/8 andalusian provinces ( seville , huelva and ja\u00e9n iirc ), 
  still very unlikely . 
  2 out of the 4 main parties oppose any kind of referendum or consession ( the 2 most conservative ones , pp and ciudadanos ) the psoe socialists are mostly opposed to referendums . 
  however , they are open to some concessions , and turning spain into a federal state . 
  furthermore , their catalan branch is in favour of what they call a `` quebec referendum '' , though with that they mean a [ clarity act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clarity_act ) like the one canada made for quebec . 
  not sure if that would solve anything though , it might even make the whole process harder . 
  could some canadian explain to me ? 
  only podemos is totally in favour of a referendum ( they 've said they 'd campaign for no though ) . 
  still , even if all parties agreed with independence , a referencum could only be non-binding ; as a binding one would break many articles of the spanish constitution . 
  even if a non binding one was made , and catalans opted for leaving , we 'd still require a constitutional ammendment , one through the complex process . 
  that means : -2 / 3 of both the congress and the senate . 
  - new elections being called ( obviously all spaniard would vote here , incuding catalonia ) -2 / 3 of the newly elected parliament ( again , both congress and the senate ) - a referendum in which all of spain could vote . 
  the main reason why all this process is n't made is mostly because of how weird it would be to have catalonia wanting to leave , but the rest of the country forcing them to stay . 
  actually , i 'm quite surprised a quebec bank owns 30 % of the line , yet the brits own so little xd, 
  damn , is independence already winning ? 
  that 's quite unexpected tbh ( especially considering how dyfunctional the current catalan government is ) do you have a source ? 
   the next president will decide this , not hollande . 
  what if hollande is reelected ? 
  :p ( not like that has any chance of happenign ), 
  ok . not exactly the same data ( no map , just a poll ) , but it should be enough . 
  in regions where nationalism is strong , here are the results : do you identify yourself as ? 
  ** catalonia ** ( 2015 ) only catalan : 21,6 % more catalan than spaniard : 25,1 % equally catalan and spaniard : 42,1 % more spaniard than catalan : 4,4 % only spaniard : 5,3 % . 
  pro independence : 43,5 % anti independence : 45,5 % ** canary islands ** ( 2015 ) only canarian : 13,6 % more canarian than spaniard : 20,4 % as canarian as spaniard : 50,6 % more spaniard than canarian : 0,6 % only spaniard : 12,1 % ** basque country ** ( 2016 ) only basque : 26 % more basque than spaniard : 18 % as basque as spaniard : 33 % more spaniard than basque : 4 % only spaniard : 4 % . 
  pro independence : 23 % depends on how independence would be : 27 % anti independence : 36 % unsure : 14 % ** galicia ** ( 2012 ) only galician : 4,3 % more galician than spaniard : 19,6 % as galician as spaniard : 65,2 % more spaniard than galician : 4,9 % only spaniard : 4,9 %, 
  seeing this map , why does n't eastern northern ireland split from the rest of the region and join ireland ireland ? 
  well , obama was directly elected . 
  junker was n't . 
  to be fair , if you want to pull the comparison with the us , they did n't elect their senators either until 1913 , when they passed the [ 17th ammendment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seventeenth_amendment_to_the_united_states_constitution ), 
  pretty much this . 
  people apparently do n't care much for eu elections when they occur . 
  turnout for them is around 45 % ; compared to 65 % for town hall elections and 70 % for general ones . 
  even then , most people vote to the eu parliament based on national issues . 
  i would say direct elections to the eu commision would be a nice idea though .
