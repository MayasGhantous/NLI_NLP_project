  also reversed against nc . 
  weak in gran canaria , strong in tenerife . 
  i guess i could include the asg as well , as they 'll get a senator , but they are just a bunch of caciques from la gomera great post otherwise, 
  reminds me a lot of cc here xd ( though their stance is more like getting an agreement with whoever came third in order to keep the government at any price ) that probably happens because of our electoral system though ( whoever decided it was a good idea to give asg 3 seats with 0,25 % of the vote , but 0 seats to ciudadanos with 5,96 % should be fired ), 
  in my opinion , the system should be : ** congress ** autonomical constituencies . 
  direcly proportional to population ( all autonomies get at least 1 seat , including ceuta and melilla ) . 
  in this scenario , lists would n't get as big as you say . 
  andalusia , the most populated autonomy would get approximately 63 seats , which is only twice of what madrid has now . 
  plus , if seats are directly proportional to population , then there are no issues ( the only disproportionality would be ceuta and melilla , which do n't have enough population to get a seat each , getting it ) . 
  in all other aspects , just like now ( so , d'hondt and stuff ) ** senate ** again , autonomical constituencies . 
  however , we move away from open lists and just use the same method we use now for congress . 
  alternatively we can pick a party ( ie no cross voting like now ) , and then order that party 's candidates , using av/stv to select the new senators , according to the number of seats they got from the party vote ( not sure if i explained myself well ) . 
  also , we have the same amount of seats per autonomy . 
  all autonomies will get 12 seats ( this will give us 204 seats ; close to the current number of elected seats ) . 
  ceuta and melilla can get 6 senators each . 
  in the canary islands , el hierro and la gomera get a shared senator . 
  la palma , lanzarote and fuerteventura get a senator each . 
  tenerife and gran canaria get 4 senators each . 
  in the balearic islands , formentera and ibiza can get 3 senators ( shared ) . 
  minorca gets another 3 senators and mallorca can get 6 . 
  i 'm not sure if we should keep the senators elected by the autonomous communities , but if we do , keep their election as it happens today . 
  nothing really . 
  i doubt brexit will have an impact really ; let alone an election defining impact like 11m did for the 2004 election . 
  if anything , it will very slightly harm podemos and the catalan nationalists , and help pp and psoe , but it 's impact will be negligible . 
  to be fair , they do n't get anything for being founding members . 
  it 's just that out of the 6 founding members , 3 are huge and very influential ( france , italy and west germany ) . 
  2 are medium-large sized and rather influential as well ( belgium & netherlands ) only luxenbourg is pretty much small and ignorable . 
  nope . 
  i 'm not saying he has been financed by venezuela ( again , if he had done that , the courts should have said something already , but they have already said they found nothing 5 times already ) however , denying he has never had a connexion with venezuela is definitely not true . 
  he has been supportive of their government in various occasions : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdlwsnm6fne https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at6h6pwhrec https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyjlr2l39r0 he has definitely been supportive of ch\u00e1vez and venezuela in the past . 
  denying that is simply false ( he has changed his position though ) . 
  hint : i 'm far from a podemos hater . 
  in fact , they were my number 2 option when voting , and in the end one of my 2 senate votes went to them . 
  hitler was also defeated in 1945 . 
  franco died in 1975 . 
  there are a lot of people who still can remember his dictatorship ( hell , even my parents can , and they are far from old ! ), 
  and the far right already got representation once , but apparently they are more worried fighting among themselves than actually making a common front like the left : https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/uni%c3%b3n_nacional_ ( coalici % c3 % b3n_de_1979 ), 
  yeah , mostly the greece situation plus the skyrocketing of debt meant we were forced to go to austerty . 
  however , the plan was still a huge mistake tbh . 
  it barely created employment , and was basically repaving roads that did n't need to be repaved and similar useless stuff instead of actually investing . 
  i 'd say that plan was the worst of zapatero 's legacy , and his overall mismanagement of the crisis is what he will remembered for , at least his second term . 
  his first term will be most likely remembered for the social advances , mostly in abortion and gay marriage . 
  you are totally right actually . 
  while our system in paper does not seem like it leads to 2 party systems , in practice it totally does ; mostly because there are lots of provinces where there are 3 or 4 seats , which will be distributed 2-2 or 2-1 , without giving other parties representation . 
  in fact , up until 2011 's elections , the amount of votes for pp+psoe was constantly increasing , reaching a peak in 2008 at 84 % of the vote and 326/350 seats . 
  had nothing happened , we 'd have a 2 party system with some minor parties with a couple of seats , sort of like the uk . 
  however , thanks to the crisis , both parties lost a bit of support in 2011 ( not much , but that was the first time their support had dropped ) , and a ton in 2015 ( they did n't even break 50 % of the popular vote ) so hey , at least the crisis had a positive side , 
   we do n't have nationalist or patriotic party geez , i wonder why that was ? 
  maybe it has to do with this guy ? 
  some people actually want that : http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/cataluna/2016-06-09/cup-referendum-independencia-cuestion-confianza-puigdemont_1214338/, 
  we actually tried to spend at first , during zapatero 's second term , with the plan e , but that absolutely flopped and just made our debt skyrocket ( we actually had very low debt before that , around 35 % of gdp ) . 
  since that flopped , and our debt was increasing fast , we had to start making cuts and austerity policies , but we did try to get out by spending . 
  https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/plan_e ( spanish link , as no english one is available ), 
  he is compared more to maduro tbh ( and that comparison is not fully unfounded ), 
  remember , africa starts in the pyrinees after all, 
  any chance le pen and the fn can win the elections ? 
  or will they just get blown out in the second round like it already happened once ? 
  to be fair , most national parliaments are n't fully proportional to population either . 
  for example , in our parliament : soria ( population 96k ) gets 2 seats in parliament , or one every 46k people . 
  meanwhile madrid ( the province , population 6,5 m ) gets 36 seats ; or one every 180k people . 
  to be fair , if you want to draw the parallels to the us , the federal government does n't have power over education either ; it 's mostly up to the states . 
  hell , even here in spain education is mostly controlled by the regional government , not by madrid . 
  supposedly catalan independentism is falling , and reached it 's peak in 2014 . 
  still , only podemos is open to the idea of a referendum ( and they said they 'd campaign for stay ) . 
  everyone else wo n't even allow it . 
  to be fair , build too many houses and prices will plummet ( that 's actually what happened here ), 
   what ? 
  in the uk we elect our members of parliament . 
  the members of the european parliament are elected in elections as well ( from a party list admittedly , but that 's the method used in spain too for example )  yeah , i know this but it 's not my idea of democracy . 
  i do n't need an extra layer of people to make it less direct . 
  i want to know that only the elected by the people have power . 
  the power of democracy is being able to sack people you do n't like , you ca n't do that to the lawmakers in the eu . 
  to be fair , the uk does n't use this system either ( cameron was elected by parliament after all ) . 
  i guess what you are looking at is a presidential system , like in the us or france ? 
  to be fair , you ca n't directly vote for prime minister in the uk , or in many eu countries for that matter . 
  iirc that 's only one of 3 vetos to a country entering , with the others being francoist spain and morocco, 
  then again , in the 2 referendums they had for joining spain , they rejected it with like 98 % of votes ( one was in 1967 , when spain was under franco though . 
  the other in 2002 ), 
  well , if catalonia ends up being independent i guess we can `` gift '' them gibraltar, 
  fair enough . 
  still , people who smoke usually buy a lot of cigarretes here . 
  then again , whenever we have to import anything from the mainland customs are awful , and inflate prices a lot ( not many people buy online in the islands , as shipping + customs make it a bad option ), 
  the only way i can see the us winning is if hillary gets elected and shortly afterwards she is indicted and has to resign . 
  there is a caretaker government right now . 
  also , the minister of foreign affairs has already made a claim on gibraltar . 
  gibraltar basically answered fuck you, 
  that looks like something that could easily come from / r/the _ donald, 
  an independent catalonia would apparently be roughly on par with belgium in terms of size , with slightly less population ( 7,5 million compared to belgiums 10,5 ), 
  they said the same could happen in catalonia , but nothing has happened in the end . 
  if that ever happened the british army would just invade scotland for a short while . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , is n't the debt requirement just for entering the euro ? 
  scotland could enter the eu with a big deficit . 
  not to mention lots of eurozone countries have huge deficits as well ( * cough * greece * cough * ), 
  40 % unemployment yay !, 
  jajajajajajajajaj reminds me of this ( except you meant it as a joke and this guy was serious unfortunately ) : http://www.cartasaldirector.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/10375150_744802032232040_6297099248762074744_n.jpg, 
  guess they never heard of : `` if you love something , let it free '', 
  to be fair , we have our own rocks in morocco 's coast xd and we are super serious about them , i 'm not surprised we care so much about gibraltar : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perejil_island_crisis, 
  to be fair , a pack of cigarettes also costs around 2,5 $ in the canary islands and nobody would argue that they are a tax heaven . 
  ( maybe slightly more , i do n't smoke after all ), 
  to be fair , gibraltar managed to survive blockaded for quite a bit .
