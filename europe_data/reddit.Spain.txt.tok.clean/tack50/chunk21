  the pp of murcia described this monday as `` reasoned speculation '' written by judge eloy velasco . 
  the judge considers that s\u00e1nchez agreed with the punic network reputational work on the internet and social networks , private in nature under the provision of services to the ministry of education of murcia . 
  in the event that the superior court heed the request of the judge of the national court , this imputation will join the one of prevarication , fraud and embezzlement for which it is being investigated in the auditorium case , on the irregularities in the construction of an equipment cultural in puerto lumbreras , locality of which the politician was mayor . 
  bit of both . 
  on the bad side , it just keeps proving that our politicians are corrupt . 
  on the other , at least one of them was caught and forced to resign , even if his resignation comes extremely late .

  i still wonder how orban and merkel are supposedly from the same eu party . 
  should n't orban at least be in the next right wing group ( ecr , alongside poland 's pis and the british conservatives ), 
  wait , is the wording actually what 's on the ballot ? 
  because those are some seriously loaded questions, 
  la razon deserves a prize compared to the sun . 
  at least it 's serious journalism . 
  even something like okdiario is better . 
  the sun seems comparable to magazines like pronto instead , which no one buys for news . 
  we separate news from gossip . 
  well , the alternatives are either exiting efta ( not worth it unless you actively want protectionism , lose barrier free access to the eu market ) or entering the eu ( probably not worth it for norway , definitely not worth it for iceland ; as they 'd have to follow the eu 's agricultural and fishing regulations ), 
  knowing 4chan , if they side with gibraltar we are dead xd just remember that flag in the middle of nowhere they found :p they can probably do anything they want if they care . 
  i guess we 'll have to summon forocoches or taringa or something, 
  where 's my soros payment then ? 
  i want to become a professional protester !, 
  yeah , he is doing a pretty good job at reducing unemployment i 'll admit . 
  maybe he will fulfill his `` 20 million workers by 2020 '' promise after all ? 
  ok , kill social security , replace it with a fund dependant on how many kids you have . 
  the more kids the more aid from the government . 
  if you ca n't beat them , join them :p, 
  ca n't we just force europe to have a lot more children and fight fire with fire ? 
  what the fuck did you just fucking say about me , you little bitch ? 
  i 'll have you know i graduated top of my class in the royal navy , and i 've been involved in numerous secret raids on the ira , and i have over 300 confirmed kills . 
  i am trained in gorilla warfare and i 'm the top sniper in the entire uk armed forces . 
  you are nothing to me but just another target . 
  i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth , mark my fucking words . 
  you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet ? 
  think again , fucker . 
  as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across the uk and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm , maggot . 
  the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life . 
  you 're fucking dead , kid . 
  i can be anywhere , anytime , and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways , and that 's just with my bare hands . 
  not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat , but i have access to the entire arsenal of the united kingdom marine corps and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent , you little shit . 
  if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little `` clever '' comment was about to bring down upon you , maybe you would have held your fucking tongue . 
  but you could n't , you did n't , and now you 're paying the price , you goddamn idiot . 
  i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it . 
  you 're fucking dead , kiddo . 
  ftfy :p, 
  who ? 
  vox ? 
  ( with a whopping 0.2 % of the vote ), 
  well , we actually went to `` war '' over a tiny uninhabited island off the coast of morocco : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perejil_island_crisis, 
  spain will never invade gibraltar . 
  a wall and allowing no access to gibraltar is the worst scenario, 
  we should talk with mexico to build the wall xd, 
   you complain about gibraltar being a tax hole but completely ignore the fact that ceuta and melilla are also low tax jurisdictions . 
  not the same thing though . 
  ceuta and melilla ( and the canary islands , which also haved lower taxes ) are not tax heavens . 
  they do have lower taxes than the rest of spain ( vat there is 10 % i think , compared to mainland spain 's 21 % ) , but they also have tariffs when shipping from/to the mainland . 
  i sometimes wish morocco owned jersey or the isle of man , if just to come full circle xd uk owns a piece of spain , who owns a piece of morocco , who owns a piece of the uk , etc, 
  actually , i do n't think they do . 
  they speak a weird dialect of english with an andalusian accent . 
  here 's for example a program from gibraltar 's tv station https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pffc9la_poc, 
  there 's actually precedent for that . 
  franco closed the border completely in 1966 and it did n't get open until 1982 , when spain was negotiating access into the eec . 
  spain could simply build a wall and return to the pre 1982 situation, 
  oh , sure , that 's why they 'd join in say , 5 years ( possibly earlier ) while turkey has been unsuccessfully trying to get in since the 80s . 
  a lot harder . 
  yes , spain 's official position was exactly that . 
  ** pre brexit vote ** if scotland leaves , they 'll be out of the eu and have to reapply . 
  spain wo n't veto once they reapply though . 
  ** post brexit vote ** scotland will leave the eu , whether alongside the rest of the uk or if they get independence in less than 2 years . 
  once they are out of the eu and the uk , they can reapply and spain wo n't veto . 
  and yeah , the deficit is not a problem for joining the eu . 
  it * is * a problem for joining the euro though . 
   madrid is keen not to fuel catalonia 's desire for independence . 
  `` we do n't want it [ scottish independence ] to happen , '' he said . 
  `` but if it happens legally and constitutionally , we would not block it . 
  we do n't encourage the breakup of any member states , because we think the future goes in a different direction . '' so basically nothing new . 
  if scotland secedes peacefully with westminster 's approval , spain wo n't veto but they 'll have to go to the end of the queue ( they will probably be fast tracked though , in 5 years they would be able to enter the eu ) if they do n't break up peacefully , spain will veto ( and that 's assuming they are even recognized in the first place , the spanish government still says kosovo is part of serbia for example )  scotland would have no chance of winning the perks enjoyed by the uk , such as the rebate on eu payments . 
  current eu law also requires new joiners to sign up to the euro , an issue that would pose fundamental problems for scotland 's trade with the rest of the uk . 
  also worth mentioning that . 
  then again , scotland can still pull off a sweden and just never fulfill the requirements for euro adoption , staying with either the uk pound or a hypothetical scottish pound . 
  pensions ? 
  maybe , but it 'd require to balance all the pension systems form all of europe , which would be a massive undertaking . 
  not to mention requiring some sort of cost of living adjustments seeing how some countries are vastly more expensive than others , but education ? 
  that wo n't work at all . 
  hell , even here we do n't even have education handled at the national level , each spanish region runs its own system !, 
  i can see the eu giving some extra grants though . 
  again , how do you intend to stop romanians from leaving their own country ? 
  so you want to implement the `` east german solution '' ? 
  ( ie shoot anyone who tries to leave the country ), 
  maybe free movement of people but not free movement of goods ? 
  yeah . 
  actually back when spain was n't in the eu the border was literally impenetrable iirc . 
  gib might as well have been an island, 
  do n't forget to make gibraltar pay for it !, 
  ca n't denmark just restrict grants to poor students ? 
  alternatively have classes be 100 % in danish so no one other than danes will go there . 
  many places do such stuff already . 
  spain can not into reddit :(, 
  did n't canada expand west ? 
  i 'd say the us-british land would be the same . 
  maybe removing those places that were once part of mexico,
