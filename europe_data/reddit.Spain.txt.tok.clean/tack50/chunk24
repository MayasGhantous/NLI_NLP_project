  iirc they do defend a referendum nationally but do n't want catalonia to leave so they had to be ambiguous . 
  i think polling is split 50-50 . 
  there is a pro independence majority in catalonia 's regional assembly though . 
  maybe , maybe not . 
  the catalonia pro independence movement is not as pro eu as spain as a whole . 
  catalonia saw reduced turnout and reduced yes votes compared to the national average in the 2005 eu constitution referendum https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_european_constitution_referendum,_2005 catalonia also voted for leaving nato ( alongside the basque country , navarra and the canary islands ) in 1986 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_nato_membership_referendum,_1986 finally , there 's also the fact that the largest party that wants to leave the eu in spain is the far left catalan independentist cup ( they are the only ones who have representation in a regional assembly after all and got 9 % of the vote or so last time ) . 
  tl ; dr : if spain was leaving the eu , it would probably be supported by catalonia so not really . 
   for example , many in the socialist party have called voters from melenchon to join hamon in a bid to get the socialists to the second round and beat le pen , but this has failed , and both hamon and melenchon struggle around 13-15 % in polls . 
  could hamon negotiate with melenchon and make it so that one becomes pm and the other becomes president ? 
  well , swizerland and california ( not a country , but still ) seem to be doing fine with tons of referendums, 
  oh , sure , i could see such a turkey entering the eu . 
  it 's just that that turkey is too far away for them to even be considered for membership right now, 
  same way as chavez i guess ? 
  he also went to jail ( for doing a coup ), 
  not french but at least over here it is an unpopular idea . 
  we got rid of the draft in 1999 , from then on it 's 100 % voluntaries . 
  then again we have the 2nd lowest relative spending in our military ( only above luxenbourg ) so \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af interestingly , it was abolished as part of a right wing government !, 
  ( aznar 's first term ) . 
  he did it only as a concession to nationalist parties in order for him to be elected though ( particularly the catalan nationalist ciu ), 
  kind of reminds me of catalan independentists , who always say `` we 'll be independent in ( current date ) +18 months '', 
  i 'm actually genuinely shocked that they called it * only * unrealistic to be honest . 
  that 's a very mild term . 
  no ; just le pen is unlikely . 
  afd is just plain impossible . 
  oh , i just did n't know about anything else xd, 
  wondering the same in reverse for the balearic islands tbh . 
  i see no reason for them to perform so badly . 
  yup . 
  here 's aznar ( probably our most conservative pm ) talking about the `` basque liberation movement '' for example : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo8lkbgvpqs, 
  to be fair , the spanish government did that as well . 
  like which ones ? 
  just curious , the `` ley mordaza '' came way after eta was defeated, 
  at least over here we feel the same :( our governor came in third but still got the largest amount of seats . 
  thankfully not as big an embarrassment as trump , but he is still fairly bad, 
   podemos time and again can not deliver on actual governance , and so on and so on . 
  for all what 's worth , the psoe centre-left in spain actually holds a plurality of `` states '' , so at least at the regional level they are holding well . 
  here 's a list : * standard left ( psoe ) : asturias , aragon , castille-la mancha , extremadura , andalucia , valencian community , balearic islands ( 7 ) * nationalist left : cantabria ( 1 ) * standard right ( pp ) : galicia , castille-leon , madrid , murcia , la rioja ( 5 ) * nationalist right : catalonia , basque country , canary islands , navarra ( 4 ) some pickups for the left include catalonia ( where erc almost certainly will replace pdecat as the largest party by the time there 's an election ) , murcia ( where the current governor is being investigated for corruption and cs , psoe and podemos are thinking about how to take him out ) , the canary islands ( although the electoral system makes it hard , but a psoe+p odemos + left wing nationalists has an outside shot of pulling it off ) and maybe even madrid ( where the current pp+c s government won with an extremely narrow majority of 1 seat ) . 
  of course the right can take a lot of the psoe 's regions as well , and 2014 was a left wing wave , but still, 
  out of curiosity , how does that kurdish party get into parliament ? 
  are there enough kurds that it can get 10 % of the vote ? 
  or is there an alternative regional way to get in ? 
  ( kind of how in germany you can get in if you get 3 or more direct seats ) . 
  or do they also get votes in the rest of turkey ? 
  oh , sure , i 'd prefer safe voting even if the results take a long time instead of electronic voting . 
  for all what 's worth we use paper ballots for everything , but 2/4 parties with primaries ( podemos , which opens it to any citizen that registers like 1 month before the election ; and cs which opens it up to only people who pay monthly fees ) do use electronic voting . 
  is n't it handled at the state level in the us though ? 
  yeah , i do agree that it has to be fixed . 
  however , giving some territories more priviledges than others is not a solution ( see for example the basque country today ) . 
  i do think autonomous communities were an ok compromise for 1978 , but they are that , a compromise . 
  we do n't have the risks from back then , there 's nothing stopping us from becoming a federal state ( interestingly , iirc the 2nd republic used a model very similar to the current autonomous communities !, 
  it was the 1st republic that was a federal state ), 
  yeah , i do n't recall tanks in diagonal avenue in 2014 . 
  same will happen in 2017, 
  yup . 
  spanish nationalism got a bad reputation after being forced to everyone during the franco era . 
  the motto of spain at the time was `` one , great and free '', 
  sure , but they are all incredibly tiny . 
  i seriously doubt that they 'd get even 1 % combined, 
  we are intolerant and prejudiced , just against other spaniards xd, 
  spain could also give catalonia a referendum if it wanted . 
  it 's just that it requires a large supermajority : 2/3 of both chambers , new snap elections , 2/3 of both chambers again and a referendum in all of spain still possible though . 
   the uk must ensure that it does not fall into a spain/catalonia stand-off why not ? 
  it seems to be working well enough for us . 
  may can even say `` you got your referendum for a generation '' , now wait 50 years or something like that, 
  sure , but that 's like saying that the governor of california has more power than others in the us, 
  they had more seats in 2010 as third than today as second, 
  for all what 's worth we also do everything by hand :p then again [ our ballots ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/cantabria_papeleta_elecciones_generales_2015_congreso_psoe.png ) are a lot simpler :p even the ones [ for the senate ] http://trendymania.es/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/papeleta_senado_2011_vlc.jpeg ) are n't all that complicated, 
  yup . 
  it wo n't be that bad for the uk . 
  if you equate the eu with the us ; the uk will end up more or less like canada , which is not bad at all . 
  where does eastern europe save costs then ? 
  utilities ? 
  rent ? 
  more like all spanish monarchs since felipe v tbh . 
  so , like maduro in venezuela ? 
  xd seems that 's not the only thing they have in common . 
  fillon should cross the border to the south and come here , he is basically the definition of a spanish politician xd, 
   now the only issue is breaking pp control of the senate . 
  considering how our senate works , very hard . 
  granted if you can get 2/3 of congress to agree then you only need 50 % +1 in the senate ( as opposed to 3/5 in each ) for a reform , but as long as pp has a majority in the senate ( or 1/3 of the congress , which they also have ) that is not going to work . 
  the last time pp did n't have an absolute majority in the senate was in 2008 . 
  however , even then they were still the largest party !, 
  ( 124 senators compared to psoe 's + whatever entesa was 123 senators ) . 
  the last time psoe was the largest party in the senate was in 1993 . 
  also , the last time pp had less than 1/3 of seats was 1989 . 
  either pp is convinced or it 's not going to work . 
  born too early to explore earth born too late to explore the galaxy born just in time to ~ ~ browse dank memes ~ ~ relive the ottoman empire, 
  to be fair , even if erdogan goes full dictator , dictatorships have been in nato before . 
  salazar 's portugal was a nato member after all . 
  turkey 's eu application on the other hand would indeed be cancelled ( not like it is n't already de facto cancelled anyway ), 
  considering how the pp is n't really following that pact , not all that likely to happen . 
  and since most reforms would require a constitutional ammendment it ca n't happen without pp support . 
  yup , semi pr sounds just right . 
  it is proportional on paper , but on practice , barring regional parties , small parties get less seats than they should . 
  iu traditionally got between 4 and 12 % but only got between 0.66 and 8 % of seats . 
  a more recient example is cs , who lost 8 seats ( from 40 to 32 ie from like 12 to 9 % of seats ) with a very minor drop of less than 1 point ( 13.9 to 13.0 ), 
  maybe the more conservative branches of the psoe ( think susama diaz ) would qualify ? 
  they consider themselves leftist , though i 'm not sure if they are republican ( traditionally only iu has been frontally opposed to the monarchy ), 
  yeah , was reading the title only . 
  it was actually must be paid less .
