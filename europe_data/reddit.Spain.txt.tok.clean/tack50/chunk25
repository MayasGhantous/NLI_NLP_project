  reminds me of venezuela for some reason . 
  hope turkey does not fall for that  i mean , pure presidential systems are n't bad * per se * ( just look at the us ) , but they are more vulnerable to dictatorial takeovers by one man than parliamentary systems . 
  cyprus ? 
  ( especially the turkish occupied part xd ) too small i guess . 
  maybe sicily or sardinia ? 
  either 1 , 2 or 4 should do the job . 
  preferrably 2 or 4 as turkey will be harder to pressure than say , libya . 
  for option 4 , assuming they go through land just building an extremely well guarded fence in the greece/bulgaria/turkey border should work . 
  those at sea are towed to wherever they departed from, 
  it 's not the `` they are weaker '' part he is getting suspended for , it 's the `` should be paid less '' part, 
  not sure about rajoy , but aznar was indeed great at speaking foreign languages ^ ^ / s, 
  well , here we have right wing nationalists ( pnv , pdecat ) , left wing nationalists ( erc , eh bildu ) and even centrist nationalists !, 
  why would people watch the balearic islands regional channel instesd of tve , a3 , tele5 , and the like ? 
  why would people watch the balearic islands regional channel instesd of tve , a3 , tele5 , and the like ? 
  probably will never happen , but i guess 1 seat is given to the first 150 parties . 
  who would want to switch with us ? 
  north korea ? 
  we will build a dam and make the ocean pay for it !, 
  wait , that 's already done xd, 
  sure , though i guess it depends on the broadcaster . 
  obviously say , tv3 ( not hating on them , any regional broadcaster would be the same ) will pay less attention to national issues than national broadcasters like say , tve . 
  sure , but they do n't have to use the euro from day 1 . 
  iirc they both peg to the euro , but scotland could peg to the british/english pound if it works better for them . 
  ( or to a mix of both the euro and the pound ), 
  yeah , not just catalonia , it seems like right now it 's trials season . 
  we reciently got urdangar\u00edn , gurtel and a couple others sorted out and today mas & co were also condemned . 
  then there 's the perennial issue of catalonia 's independence and the primaries in all 4 parties !, 
  ( 3 of which are over already , but the psoe 's primary is shaping up to be very interesting , with susana d\u00edaz confirming her candidacy yesterday ), 
  well , they could have a pegged scottish pound ( be it to the euro , to the uk pound or to both ) . 
  bulgaria for example got into the eu in 2007 and their currency is pegged to the euro . 
  same thing with denmark ( although they got in earlier ) . 
  they might have to reduce the debt , but they could still enter without fulfilling the full requirements for the euro , just pledging they 'll keep working to fulfill the euro requirements, 
  bulgaria and denmark have hard pegs to the euro iirc . 
  scotland could develop a similar system . 
  i thought the budget would only be a problem for entering the euro , not the eu itself ? 
  maybe not fully discontinued , but definitely make it so if you have been living abroad for more than say , 10 years ( or have permanent residency and/or dual citizenship ) you ca n't vote abroad . 
  damn , does turkey have a party resembling a centrist party ? 
  ( or at the very least not nationalist ; all 4 seem way too nationalist ), 
  oh , so the `` russian minorities '' thing except turkey takes it very seriously ? 
  how many turks are there that campaigning outside turkey is worth it  . , 
  basic summary of the 3 candidates : ** pedro s\u00e1nchez ** : former secretary general ousted in a party coup when he refused to make rajoy pm , leading the most left wing campaign and going against the abstention allowing rajoy to become pm . 
  ** patxi l\u00f3pez ** : former governor of the basque country . 
  running a middle of the road unifying campaign . 
  only one who is still an mp and thus could confront rajoy in parliament ** susana d\u00edaz ** : running the most conservative campaign of the 3 . 
  critics say she is disliked outside of andalucia and dislike that she 'd be both a party leader and governor . 
  supporters say she has proven to be able to get outright wins ( as opposed to coming in second , then winning through deals with podemos or other left wing parties ) . 
  also worth noting that she is only the second or third woman to contest a party leadership , and if she won , she 'd be the first female party leader . 
  translation of the short text :  the governor of andalucia , susana d\u00edaz , will formally anounce the 26th of march her candidacy to the psoe leadership in a great rally in madrid , as have confirmed to efe socialist sources  with this announcement , d\u00edaz will become the third candidate to lead the psoe , alonside former leader pedro s\u00e1nchez and former governor of the basque country patxi l\u00f3pez , who has presented is manifesto for his candidacy today in a rally in getafe ( madrid ), 
  for all what 's worth , while we 've never had a referendum on eu membership we did have one for the eu constitution in 05 . 
  it passed in 82-18 , with all provinces voting in favour . 
  here are the maps for [ yes votes ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/yesvotespainreferendum.png ) and for [ turnout ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/turnoutspainreferendum.png ) for a referendum that was closer , the one for leaving nato was only won 57-43 . 
  4 autonomous communities voted for leave ( catalonia , basque country , navarra , canary islands ) . 
  here 's the [ map by province ] ( https://accionmasreaccion.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/1986-spain-referendum-nato.png?w=640 ), 
  yeah , even with erdogan i do n't see any reason to kick turkey out of nato . 
  * maybe * cancel turkey 's eu application , and even that 's a pretty harsh punishment . 
  if it 's anything like us yes . 
  even podemos does n't want catalonia to leave . 
  sure , but you need to give smaller communities something . 
  an alternative could be to give the senate equal powers and make it 1 community x senators while the congress is 100 % proportional, 
   anything else was getting 5 % of the votes at max . 
  iu/pce ( between 1977 and 2000 and in 2011 ) and ucd/cds ( between 1977 and 1989 ) consistently got more than 5 % , even though the electoral system punished them hard and they never got more than like 25 seats at their strongest . 
  then again our system has an easy fix . 
  make constituencies be the autonomous communities instead of the provinces , and shuffle the seats so that every community is well represented . 
  2 seats per community plus the rest based upon population sounds right to me . 
  actually , spain is apparently going to be a net contributor to the eu now . 
  without brexit we would have been one by 2020 or so anyways though . 
  yeah . 
  same with the french basque country . 
  for all what 's worth he is the leader of the pp delegation in the european parliament , so he is a pretty important guy . 
  yup . 
  iirc spain does recognize montenegro as an independent state ( legal referendum ) but does not recognize kosovo ( unilateral independence ), 
  and no unionists will vote there and it will be basically worthless , with puigdemont probably calling for early elections some time in 2018 see : 2014 `` referendum '', 
  alternatively a referendum only in catalonia could be made , but it would need to be non-binding and would solve nothing ( as we 'd still need to reform the constitution with approval from all spaniards ), 
  well , defenders of the `` catalonia was forcefully annexed '' theory usually refer to the war of spanish succession , where the kingdom of aragon went with one side and castille went with another . 
  in the end castille won and the priviledges of the kingdom of aragon were abolished . 
  yeah , was referring to 2 years ago , should have put it xd, 
  well , no one is talking the us selling 0 to europe, 
  sure , maybe in the uk , but if our pm had wanted a trump style ban he could have easily had one . 
  no one can vote against their own party since they 'd be expelled . 
  what would happen if all parties saw entering into a coalition as the worst option in the long run ? 
  would the netherlands be paralyzed like us last year ? 
  ( where we finally got a government after a lot of backstabbing in our main centre-left party ), 
  yeah , but he is kind of powerless iirc ; acting more like our king than our pm for example . 
  yup , i 'd hate to see this become / r/politics for europe, 
   he speaks german , pis ran once a great smear campaign on how tusk 's grandfather served in wehrmacht , and he likes each other with merkel . 
  was n't something like 1/3 of poland 's current territory in german hands before 1945 ? 
  that explains the 2nd . 
  also , who would complain that their leader speaks several languages ? 
  xd i wish our pm spoke german . 
  hell , not even major reforms ; just some renaming would be enough !, 
  rename the `` european council '' to eu senate and rename the `` european commision '' to eu government or something like that and that 's it !, 
  looking forward to [ this photo ] ( http://diario16.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/imagen-sin-titulo.jpg ) repeating itself , this time with may/trump/rajoy xd, 
  yeah , we literally took a terrorist attack as retaliation from al qaeda, 
  til we smoke as much as the us and marijuana is still 100 % illegal here . 
  imagine if it was legal xd, 
  yeah but the eu = 4th reich so it * is * germany 's fault ^ ^ / s, 
  yeah , i always though the `` best '' of eastern europe had at least already caught up to `` the worst '' of western europe ( greece/portugal ) . 
  ( using the cold war definition here , i know greece is quite a bit to the east xd ) meanwhile this map makes it seem like there 's still a huge difference, 
  i thought weed was only legal in a couple of states ? 
  ( not like it 's that large of a deterrent , lots of people have smoked weed here ; but still ),
