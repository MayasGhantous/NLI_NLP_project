  they are pro-venezuela and pro-iran though, 
  at least not here in spain . 
  houses habe decreased in price during the crisis because our bubble popped . 
  then again they are starting to increase again ( they are at 2003 levels nowadays , i guess late 90s adjusting for inflation ) https://blog.bankinter.com/documents/20185/226040/3034.vivienda3/812db379-00cf-4059-9efc-1a500982e617, 
  so i told ~ ~ dean ~ ~ trump to ~ ~ lay down on the floor ~ ~ make up a fake attack on sweden at a rally . 
  he actually did it , the absolute madman hahahahhahaha !!!!, 
  why not do a deal ? 
  if hamon wins and ps keeps a majority they make melenchon the pm ? 
  most interesting thing to note here , pp+c s would get a comfortable 13 seat majority ( 189 seats with 176 being needed for a majority ),

  golden dawn ? 
  ahh , the hugely important `` forocoches '' voting block . 
  apparently they now are with vox , and before cs they went with podemos xd, 
  no there is n't . 
  you can suspend their voting rights but that is it . 
  well , we need a civil war here first for that , and for that we need a `` franco 2 '' . 
  `` spanish le pen '' will work just nice xd, 
  does n't portugal actually indeed have an incredibly small amount of free tv though , like 4 channels or so ? 
   greece has no strong far right populism did you forget about golden dawn , probably the most far right of the far right parties ? 
  well , we are in a post truth era of alternative facts after all, 
  rivalries in these kinds of threads : * netherlands-finland * portugal-spain what are some others ? 
  / r/mapswithoutthecanaryislands, 
  yeah , i literally knew nothing about the eu other than `` some guys in brussels telling us `` pay denbts '' and `` we vote for something there every 5 years '' until i started visiting / r/europe, 
  here in spain we replaced the creepy intro with one that was a lot more happy https://youtu.be/bbapivinkdi we also censored the ending , removing the part where the world explodes , 
  interestingly , i am pretty young ( 1998 born ) and i totally remember watching it . 
  not sure if it was my parents saying `` take a look at this '' or if it actually aired as a rerun somewhere ( most likely boomerang ) . 
  did n't like it much for some reason though . 
  yeah . 
  actually , 3 spanish communities ( aragon , madrid and la rioja ) have half their population on just their capital city !, 
  original source ( in spanish , i took the maps , posted them to imgur and put a small english description ) : https://fronterasblog.com/2016/01/14/veinte-mapas-sobre-la-distribucion-de-la-poblacion-en-espana/, 
  not sure about that either , but for some reason i 'm starting to get some `` george w bush '' vibes from trump , seeing how he is distancing himself from europe and such . 
  then again , bush was the us president in [ this famous photo ] ( http://diario16.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/imagen-sin-titulo.jpg ) so maybe we should expect a theresa may-donald trump-mariano rajoy axis this time ? 
  napolitana . 
  in reference to naples , italy . 
  crooked marine using fake jobs !, 
  sad !, 
  yeah , since trump won it 's now northern states and the west coast ^ ^ / s, 
  could spd/greens/fdp work ? 
  and would they get a majority ? 
  if he lost , who 'd be his replacement ? 
  mostly giving multinational corporations too much power and corporations suing eu countries . 
  also , it 's not like trade deals are all that beneficial for the average person . 
  just look at nafta . 
  yeah , i totally agree . 
  that 's also why i 'm mostly neutral towards ceta ( if leaning on against ) , but more opposed to ttip ( dead thanks to trump ) . 
  canada in general is closer in regulations to the eu than the us is , so free eu-canada trade is not as bad ( or as good if you are in favour of ceta ) . 
  sure , there 's the province of las palmas and the province of santa cruz de tenerife , but they are only a line in a map tbh, 
  there 's also the canary islands , which simply forget provinces exist and instead hace `` cabildos '', 
  [ relevant xkcd ] ( https://xkcd.com/1244/ ), 
  ouch , that sounds bad . 
  then again , apparently we are the exception in europe , not the norm :( out of the rest of the eu , only bulgaria , estonia , latvia , cyprus , finland , hungary , lithuania , luxenbourg , and malta are like us ( no extra tv tax ) . 
  the next largest is hungary , and they have less than 1/4 of our population, 
  nope . 
  it 's illegal to grow and sell in spain . 
  ( apparently it 's handled partially at the regional level but there are barely any differences between regions ) . 
  consuming is also illegal , but it only takes a 300 $ fine . 
  i do n't fully understand the laws though , but as far as i know it 's mosly illegal in all cases . 
  yeah , but to be some regional broadcasters are pretty large for what they are . 
  catalonia 's broadcaster ( tv3 ) is somehow on par with rtve  .  then again , tvg is the 2nd most expensive in the country in a $ / capita basis ( first is the basque country at 55 $ / year ) . 
  ours for example costs only 19 $ / person/year , on par with tve . 
  murcia is the cheapest in the country at 7.4 $ / person/year . 
  http://prnoticias.com/television/20146441-cuanto-cuestan-las-televisiones-publicas and we could spend quite a bit less by running ads on tve like back in 2009 and before . 
  oh , sure , but it can be funded without extra taxes , only marginally increasing the eu 's budget . 
  besides , how expensive would it be anyways ? 
  another option is to make it run ads and make it a `` non profit for profit '' , with profits going to the eu 's budget . 
  that would turn the tv channel into an asset . 
  yeah , but not for too long . 
  by the time brexit is effective ( or maybe even now , not sure ) , we 'll be net contributors . 
  granted , pretty small contributors ( closer to neutral than to say , france ) , but still, 
   together with european broadcasting fee and european wide collection agency who said broadcasting fees and collection agencies ? 
  we have our own national tv broadcaster ( tve ) which is funded without fees . 
  ( it gets its money from regular taxes . 
  back on the day it would also run ads ) . 
  i see no issue with doing the same at the eu level . 
  worst case scenario that channel has to run some ads . 
  is n't the bbc widely considered to be one of the most neutral networks in existance though ? 
  i remember when we got the `` best public news '' award in like 2010 instead of the bbc and felt like something huge . 
  most likely you 'd get the content on the original language , subtitled in your language . 
  for original content , it 'd be dubbed in the most used languages and all others would get the english version with subtitles, 
  really ? 
  other than euronews ( which requires you to get cable/satellite tv anyways ) , i ca n't think of any . 
  not that we get here at least . 
  well , not everyone has cable tv , but then again standard tv is pretty nice as well , 
  here in spain we do n't even pay extra taxes for our own public tv ( tve ) soo ... yeah . 
  why would an eu broadcaster be different ? 
  yeah , i totally agree . 
  actually , is there someone pushing for marijuana here ? 
  i can only think of ciudadanos , and i 'm not even totally sure about them either ( and it 's not a priority for them anyways ), 
  tbh , we actually had very little debt in 2008 , but thanks to zapatero 's abysmal 2nd term we doubled the debt . 
  rajoy did n't stop our debt growth either , so between 2007 and 2014 we basically tripled our debt :( thankfully our debt is stable now , but still incredibly high at 100 %, 
  kinda reminds me of us during the 80s and 90s . 
  we also got quite a bit of eu money then . 
  then again , it 's not about the money ; it 's about how you use it . 
  we did n't use it well enough ; funding a bubble instead of investing correctly . 
  hopefully poland gets it right . 
   we 've been protesting so much in the last 3 years or so that honestly ... you start the year expecting to have to protest at one point . 
  kind of reminds me of us between 2011 and 2014 or so . 
  soon enough , you 'll see new parties that get at least some of the romanian protesters ' demands , just like we got podemos and ciudadanos , breaking a 2 party system , 
  nope . 
  i think we are the only ones alongside san marino and another country,
