  eastern europe seems to have at least caught up a bit now . 
  most are at around portugal levels ; maybe a bit higher . 
  we passed the eu constitution back in 05 by an overwhelming margin ( 80-20 ) and i 'm pretty sure we are n't german :p, 
  to be fair , wine + coke is not * that * weird of a drink at least here in spain , but for that youuse the cheapest wine you can find , not good ones xd, 
  oh , same thing here . 
  parliament elects the government and prime minister ( no president as we have a king , but with essencially 0 power ) . 
  it 's just that since we often have minority and coalition governments it would n't be that weird for parliament to repeal an emergency order . 
  just hoping romania could do that . 
  does the government have an absolute majority ? 
  because if so , you are out of luck until the next election , just like us between 2011 and 2015 . :(, 
  to be fair , do n't emergency orders need to be passed by parliament ? 
  at least here they are passed by the government and applied from day 1 , but at the next meeting of parliament they must be approved or repealed, 
  damn , it seems the landscape is bad for a centre-right brit then : / of course , there 's `` safe seats '' and all of that so maybe voting for some parties might be useless , but the big 3 seem bad options . 
  the snp , greens and that wales party are also leftist anyways . 
  ukip is anti eu . 
  maybe some of the ni parties alligns the best with your views ? 
  ( not like you could vote for them anyways ), 
  unrelated , but imo `` save romania union '' is a badass name for a party xd, 
  iirc reddit as a whole is something like 65 % men or so anyways , but / r/europe takes it to the extreme xd, 
  watch them switch to welsh as the officual uk language xd, 
  oh , the us are far from perfect ( see : their latest election ) but they are an ok model i guess . 
  then again it 's not like eu countries are much better on thay regard . 
  pretty sure we have n't had a genuinely good pm other than the very first one , and i 'd gladly take obama over rajoy or zapatero . 
  yeah , except for the eu the `` eu demos '' elects all 751 meps . 
  what you are saying is basically a trueism except under certain circumstances ( like say , our senate where only 209/260 senators or so are directly elected ), 
  the us handles it nicely with both a senate ( 1 state = 2 senators ) and a house of representatives ( 1 person = 1 vote , at least in theory ) . 
  the eu just averages the 2 for its parliament . 
  you could easily kill the council , replace it with a us style senate and make the eu parliament more proportional in exchange . 
  i do agree about the turnout issue though . 
  people need to start thinking about eu elections as eu elections , not as a proxy for national ones . 
  no you do n't . 
  in the uk you only elect 1/650 mps . 
  even in places with a proportional system you only elect a small number of mps ( my constituency for example has 8/350 mps ), 
  well , who do you think you vote for in uk elections ? 
  in fact , other than france off the top of my head , almost all eu countries only elect their mps , who then elect the prime minister , just like the meps elect the commision . 
  as for the second , i just hope they will put themselves out of a job . 
  the council is basically a meeting of the pms , so they will still have a job . 
  yeah , basically a better eu . 
  it is n't really necessary to start from scratch . 
  to be fair , the eu is pretty democratic already . 
  there are elections to the eu parliament after all . 
  but yeah , it still needs some important but simple reforms ( giving the parliament the ability to craft legislation unilaterally or replacing the eu council with a proper eu senate which is at least 50 % directly elected for example ) also , even with brexit and a hypothetical european federation , the uk will be fine . 
  if you want to pull the comparison with the us , in that case the uk would be to the eu what canada is to the us . 
  ok , here are some of the more nationalist communities : in order : only spanish/more spanish than x / equally x and spanish/more x than spanish/only x ** canary islands ** ( october 2015 ) 12,1 / 0,6 / 50,6 / 20,4 / 13,6 http://www.laopinion.es/canarias/2015/10/07/3--canarios-declara-nacionalista/632047.html ** basque country ** 6/2/36 / 23/30 november 2016 https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/euskal_herria ** navarre ** 45 % only navarrese 20 % basque and navarrese 9 % spanish 9 % basque , navarrese and spanish 7 % navarrese and spanish 5 % spanish 5 % european same source and data as before ** valencian community ** october 2015 21,1 / 9,4 / 57,7 / 5,7 / 1,7 http://www.lasprovincias.es/politica/201510/08/siente-espanol-como-valenciano-20151007235736-v.html ** balearic islands ** april 2012\u00a024/57 / 20 ( only had more one than the other and equal options . 
  no `` only spanish '' or `` only x '' option http://www.diariodemallorca.es/mallorca/2012/04/22/57-poblacion-siente-espanola-balear/760732.html, 
  actually , i think they 'd place something like this : republicans : standard conservatives ( german cdu , british conservatives , spanish pp , etc ) macron : the new pro eu liberal centrists ( british lib dems , spanish ciudadanos/albert rivera ) valls ' / hollande 's ps : standard social democrats and centre-left ( british `` new labour '' , like 70 % of the spanish psoe ) melenchon/hamon 's ps : anti establishment far leftists ( corbyn in britain , podemos/pablo iglesias in spain ), 
  yeah , but le pen fillon is only a 60-40 win . 
  that 's definitely winnable for le pen if things continue to go downhill for fillon and/or the french left votes for le pen to avoid austerity and cuts .

  watch republicans repeal that law, 
  yeah , probably also why most of the support is in rural areas while independentists are rare in greater barcelona . 
  avila is actually one of the most well known , and a popular 1 day trip if you are going to madrid ( just like segovia and toledo ), 
  to be fair it 's actually a volcano , so it 's often just named as teide or the teide volcano, 
  to be fair 26 years is a very long time . 
  compare 2016 hungary or poland to 2001 spain or 2000 portugal .

  why are you being downvoted ? 
  it is true . 
  iirc the `` law agains gender violence '' of 2005 removed partially due process for men on some domestic violence instances, 
  google translated and revised article :  the psoe former secretary general , pedro s\u00e1nchez , announced this saturday at an event in dos hermanas ( seville ) that will present himself to the primary process to lead the party , competing with patxi l\u00f3pez and , in all likelihood , susana d\u00edaz . 
  `` it will be an honor to lead your collective project , '' he said , presenting himself as a candidate of the militancy . 
   s\u00e1nchez has asked the manager to `` not weaken the ties of brotherhood between the psoe and the psc . '', 
  i would consider it an `` error '' not to let the catalan socialists vote in the primaries . 
  and he has promised that , if elected , the psc `` will recover the right to participate in the organic life of the party with voice and vote without having to beg . '', 
   the event , which has gathered about 2,000 people , has been a plea in defense of the primaries for the election of the secretary general , the presence of militancy in the decisions of the party and against the barons and the manager . 
  in fact , the mayor of dos hermanas , francisco toscano , has lashed out against `` a minority believed to be more prepared than the bases . '', 
   sanchez has been accompanied by his trust group , such as the deputies od\u00f3n elorza , zaida cantera , luz martinez seijo , adriana lastra and jos\u00e9 luis avalos . 
  he has also shown his support the representative of the left socialist internal current led by jos\u00e9 antonio perez tapias . 
  so , like pablo iglesias here , just with cuba instead of venezuela ? 
   that 's not going to happen , there is far more to that than political will . 
  serious reforms like fiscal union require overwhelming support in the electorate , and that support is unlikely to be there regardless of who 's elected to govern . 
  does n't this vary a lot from country to country though ? 
  i remember we passed the eu constitution by like 80-20 back in the day ( albeit under abysmal turnout ) , while others rejected it 60-40 . 
  could a hypothetical reform be done in an opt-in basis ? 
  do n't forget about le pen , who kinda breaks that :(, 
  we are already creating jobs and growing fairly fast though . 
  salaries are n't great , but we could be doing a lot worse right now . 
  leaving the euro for a hypothetical neo-peseta would be suicide . 
  could n't the queen move to australia instead ? 
  they are also a commonwealth country, 
  damn !, 
  meanwhile here a pizza starts at around 5 $ on the cheapest places , 7-8 at most places, 
  so that 's why latvia can not into potato then . 
  to be fair , a simpler solution would be to just make it so you vote for the eu parties instead of the national ones , even if they have the same people . 
  for 2014 , that would have meant people voting for s&d instead of psoe over here , and schulz 's face alongside that of elena valenciano iirc, 
  hillary/cruz maybe ? 
  that 's the only one i can think of really . 
  to be fair , are n't merkel and schulz really the only ones with a chance ? 
  here on paper we had 4 with a chance , but in reality it was basically a 3 way race ( rajoy/sanchez/iglesias ), 
  well , we were neutral in the last 2 world wars , going neutral on ww3 is probably our destiny : /, 
   libya should be invaded , occupied , made a un protectorate of sorts , and the french led coalition with a diverse un peacekeeping mission should form a common constitution and rebuild a libyan state . 
  this did n't work for irak in 03 . 
  why would it work now ? 
  the ~ ~ german ~ ~ reddit community overall is quite left leaning ftfy, 
  holy shit , that gabriel guy only wins in his own party by 3 points against merkel !, 
  yeah , no wonder he is leaving . 
  even here with terribly unpopular leaders something like 80 % of party members at least will vote for their leader, 
  wait , if labour and the conservatives will both vote for brexit , and fptp greately benefits concentrated parties ( like say , the snp ) , wouls n't the lib dems rise a lot in places that voted remain ouside scotland and ni ? 
  ( basically london and large cities i guess ) . 
  to be fair , they require supermajorities in parliament .
