  in a referendum it is always 50 % +1, 
  somewhere in russia : help !, 
  ~ ~ reddit ~ ~ my train 's braille instructions turned into spanish and i ca n't fix it !, 
  what do i do ? 
  do n't worry , we have a couple of rocks from morocco anyways , so it 's all good in the end , 
  there 's a lot of corruption and `` revolving doors '' between our politicians and energy companies . 
  just to get a sense of it , out of the 3 former prime ministers that are still alive , 2 have gone on to work on energy companies after they left office ( felipe gonzalez and jose mar\u00eda aznar . 
  zapatero is the odd one out ) [ here 's ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pczdesxynlq/vij9aqhl4ni/aaaaaaaasra/11juvhyv8ve/s1600/1.%2b8.%2blos%2b24%2bex%2bpol%25c3%25adticos%2ben%2bel%2bsecor%2bel%25c3%25a9ctrico..png ) a more comprehensive infographic with 24 high level politicians from 5 different parties !, 
  reminds me of a comment i read the day of the brexit vote : david cameron : liberator of scotland , unificator of ireland, 
  for spanish standards it probably is . 
  as a % of gdp in nato we are the ones who spend the second least , only above luxenbourg  . , 
  oh , we had that before too !, 
  i think we passed the usual exceptions ( rape , danger to the mother , malformations ) in the mid 80s, 
  wait , those 2 only add up to 67 % how are the others divided ? 
  and how likely is it that ukip or the lib dems beat labour ? 
  yeah , the us can also be quite progressive . 
  iirc abortiong got legalized there in the 70s . 
  meanwhile here in spain we had to wait until 2010 , and we are sometimes considered to be quite progressive , even for europe 's standards !, 
  was n't trump the anti free trade protectionist candidate ? 
  pretty sure the us wo n't sign a single free trade deal in the next 4 , possibly 8 years, 
   with its us-eu counterpart . 
  i think trump pretty much single handedly killed any chance the ttip had . 
  ceta is a good enough comparison though, 
  not in those regions , but at least here in the canary islands we have literally 0 heating systems at all unless you live in the mountains ( where it does get quite cold , like 5c cold ) . 
  would n't surprise me if murcia was the same . 
  godwin 's law and all , but did n't hitler do something similar to become a dictator ? 
  ok , former yugoslavian country then, 
  yeah , there 's no reason to think a 2 party system would happen unless we use fptp worst case scenario is 2 dominant parties with like 3 minor parties like germany or especially spain pre 2015, 
  hence why it 's the only other balcan country in the eu :p, 
  to be fair , it was n't the first time we had 25 % unemployment . 
  back in the 1993 recession we had 24 % unemployment , and we peaked at 21 % unemployment in the mid 80s . 
  granted those were milder recessions , but still , spain has always had high unemployment, 
  oh , til i guess they can always reform the constitution first . 
  for all what 's worth iirc clinton 's vice presidential candidate did play an instrument ( the harmonica ), 
  yeah , i 'd just replace that with a simple majority and make it a proper senate ( mostly directly elected with a few appointed senators like ours , to get the best of both worlds ), 
  instead of getting completely rid of the council , i 'd replace it with a proper elected senate . 
  all countries get the same amount of representation ( 3 senators staggered every 2 years like the us sounds fine to me . 
  a fourth is elected by the parliaments of each country ), 
  so , voting cs on the european elections ? 
  to be fair , i ca n't see the eu collapsing totally . 
  partially ? 
  sure , but even in a worst case scenario i can still see half the member states ( 14 ) remaining no matter what : http://i.imgur.com/q8jw9ye.jpg ( i have doubts in some , but definitely at least 12 stay . 
  of course most of the important ones would be gone ), 
  well , it * is * spain , just as much as madrid or barcelona . 
  it just is n't located on the mainland . 
  oh , we have those too !, 
  here in las palmas it 's a comfortable 18c !, 
  damn , really ? 
  even here we get more snow xd we had snow for the last time in january 2016 iirc . 
  though i guess you mean in the city ( santander ? ), 
  and not just in the entire region . 
  pretty sure the mountains in cantabria should have a lot more snow . 
  yeah , there 's currently 18c here in las palmas , and not much rain, 
  so , pensions are a ponzi scheme . 
  got it . 
  no polling has been done thus far as the primaries are still quite far ( i think they are predicted for may or so ) . 
  they are also limited to paid psoe affiliated party members ; not all spaniards can vote ; those who are part of the party, 
  for those who do n't know him , he is a former basque country governor ( 2009-2012 ) , and in fact the only non nationalist governor there ever ( all others have belonged to the nationalist pnv party ) . 
  he is currently an mp for vizcaya , and was the speaker of the congress of deputies during the short lived 2016 term ( cancelled due to no government being formed ) . 
  if he is elected , he 'll probably be elected as a consensus centrist alternative to susana d\u00edaz , the more conservative challenger and current governor of andaluc\u00eda and pedro s\u00e1nchez , the deposed leader who is running again ; this time as the left wing candidate . 
  that 's interesting considering the other huge populist movement of 2016 ( trump ) is actually the total opposite xd were remainers in favour of tariffs and brexiteers in favour of free trade ? 
  that 's weird . 
  one question , how many single-issue remainers are there , and could the lib dems take advantage of them like ukip did ? 
  to be fair , up until i started browsing / r/europe i did n't really know how the eu worked . 
  it was just this abstract organization we belong to that gives us cool stuff like single currency or no borders with portugal and france but also tells us to do our homework sometimes . 
  ( ie austerity ) i 'd say less than 5 % of spaniards are knowledgable about the eu , and that 's being generous, 
  yeah , the 2 main islands in the canary islands are actually pretty densely populated source : live in gran canaria, 
  yeah , i 'd personally make it a directly elected proper senate instead of what it is now . 
  africa starts at the pyrinees :p, 
  spain can not into snow : /, 
  we 'll always have sierra nevada :p, 
  no we do n't . 
  japan seems to be doing pretty well , has very low birth rates and almost no inmigration . 
  what about hungary 's constitutional court or equivalent ? 
  damn , would n't that break some sort of basic right enumerated in the hungarian constitution or eu regulations ? 
  ( i 'm betting on freedom of assembly , but it might break others as well ), 
   and i say to them : when you have an 8 am physics class , the cold air really wakes you up . 
  on the contrary , whenever it 's cold here i often refuse to get out of bed xd then again , cold here means something like 15c or so . 
  houses do n't have heating systems . 
  spoken like a true canadian :p, 
  yeah , i remember seeing simiar numbers for the last heat wave, 
  could n't iceland unilaterally implement the euro like say , montenegro did ? 
  that was before he was ever elected though . 
  he had to leave politics for that anyways , and could n't contest any elections because of that . 
  imo it should never get to 100 % . 
  instead it should increase and get to 100 % if your income is infinite , but not before . 
  to get an idea , let 's say you are taxed 90 % , then 99 % , then 99.9 % , 99.99 % , etc, 
  in theory yes , they 'd be to the pp 's right most likely .

  for those without context : former spanish pm jose mar\u00eda aznar ( 1996-2004 ) has often critizised rajoy 's government from the right . 
  it is expected that if he decided to run with his own party , he 'd try to run from the pp 's right . 
  that would also mark the first time a party to the right of the pp gets seats since 1979 , when a pro-francoist party named fuerza nueva got 1 seat . 
  though then again at the time the pp was way more to the right than it is now . 
  also very interesting , he 'd actually win the election in madrid , getting the same amount of seats as rajoy 's pp !, 
  he 'd also come in second in castille-la mancha . 
  he also is n't the only one from the pp that has critizised rajoy 's government . 
  former madrid governor esperanza aguirre ( 2003-2012 ) has also critizised him , and she has sometimes threatened with making her own liberal party !, 
  ~ ~ with blackjack and hookers ~ ~ no idea what would differenciate that from ciudadanos though, 
  yeah me too !, 
  we must be like 3 people in total :d,
