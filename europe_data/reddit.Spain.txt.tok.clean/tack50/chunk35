  do you want all of europe turning in to a one language mono culture state ? '', 
  ok , i 'll answer it , and the answer is obviously no xd . 
  however , even if the eu were to become a country , culture and language would n't disappear . 
  you still have a lot of culture and several languages here in spain , which is much more centralist than the eu will ever be . 
  fine , what about spain . 
  would we be better off economically if we just split into 17 countries ? 
  or the uk if it split into 4 ? 
  sure . 
  you seem to argue that dissolving the eu and replacing it with 28 sovereign states is basically democracy . 
  it 's not . 
  you can be a sovereign state and be undemocratic ( see : every dictatorship ever ) even democracies can be less democratic than the eu . 
  would you say that the us ( which elected the loser of their election and has terrible problems with representativity of the electorate ) is more democratic than the eu ? 
  to be fair , i 'm not sure if europe ( and the world ) really need more nuclear proliferation . 
  france has nukes already , and so does the uk so if russia were to attack we 'd be covered . 
  even if you want to go on the worst case scenario and say france and the uk stay neutral , nukes probably wo n't be used by russia . 
  what would russia gain by making europe the scenario of a fallout game ? 
  we can defend using conventional forces, 
  to be fair , education mergers would never happen . 
  even here we handle our education system mostly at the local level , let alone in the eu !, 
  and for economic laws , greater cooperation leads to greater prosperity for everyone . 
  do you think the us would be better off as 50 individual countries ? 
  or spain better off as 17 individual countries ? 
   how about we ... have sovereign states ... with sovereign governments . 
  i call this idea democracy . 
  sovereign states = / = democracy was spain under franco ( for example ) more democratic than the eu currently is ? 
  hell , would you call europe before the french revolution democracies , but now not ? 
  to be fair , i find it hard to belive that the same government that gave us the `` sun tax '' will now put some nice environmental taxes, 
  i feel like the 5 % figure is accurate . 
  i 've seen everything from 10 % to 1 % , so 5 % fits nicely in the middle . 
  so , like us then ? 
  ( repeating the elections every 6 months ), 
  yeah . 
  actually , when the madrid 04 attacks happened , one of the key reasons for why the state of emergency ( to be precise , the `` state of exception '' , level 2/3 in severity ) , was not called was precisely because all elections are delayed during it . 
  as always , we will remain neutral until the war is over xd, 
  yeah , at the time iirc the arab world was basically on par ( if not a bit better ) than europe . 
  cordoba and granada have some beautiful buildings, 
  well , why not move the letters somewhere else ? 
  or change their colour ? 
  to be fair , i also think spain is a multi national country and i do n't want independence for my region ( canary islands )  . , 
  and a translated version :  the spanish constitution is based on the ** undissolvable ** unity of the spanish nation , common and ** undivisible ** homeland of all spaniards , and recognizes and guarantees the right to autonomy of all regions and nationalities that make it up , and solidarity among them, 
  yeah , i feel like puerto rico is a closer analogy for the us, 
  to be fair , el pais is the most left leaning printed newpaper it 's just that even they are centrist ( they explitly support the conservative susana diaz wing of the psoe ), 
  to be fair , seeing how politiziced the constitutional court is , if a non pp government gets elected it will be magically constitutional again . 
  yeah . 
  i do n't think we have a left wing printed newspaper anymore . 
  i guess el pa\u00eds was the closest thing , but they 've shown their true colours now . 
  on a more desperate option , i read once that the `` state of siege '' or `` state of exception '' could be placed in catalonia if that did n't work , but that 's basically the `` tanks in barcelona '' option, 
  reminds me of something they say here . 
  if it were andalucia ( huge net taker ) instead of catalonia ( net giver ) the one that wanted independence , they 'd be independent by now , and everyone would be happy . 
  for the record , there is a fringe independence movement in the canary islands and an even fringier one in andalucia , but obviously no one cares . 
  technically speaking only a binding referendum is illegal . 
  a non binding one would be legal ( it 's barely more than an elaborate poll ) . 
  the problem is that if catalonia votes for yes , but then the rest of spain does not want them to leave , we are screwed : /, 
  spaniard here and same deal . 
  outside of the southern half of the peninsula i 'm not sure how common they are . 
  i think the northern half has more wheat and grapes , while the canary islands have tomatoes and bananas . 
  edit : [ here 's ] ( http://html.rincondelvago.com/00091435_html_699a6b26.jpg ) a map which partially proves my guess . 
  olives are only grown in what is andalucia , castille-la mancha , extremadura , inner valencia and the southern part of aragon, 
  yeah , i 'll admit it 's a bit hypocritical in our side . 
  i personally defend that ceuta , melilla and gibraltar should be whatever they want ( spanish for the first 2 , british for gibraltar ) . 
  as for the uninhabited islands , i do n't care that much , they are uninhabited xd . 
  i still think we did mostly right in defending them , but that island was n't even worth the price of the helicopter fuel to get there as one newspaper at the time put it, 
   a single currency for 500 + million people just does n't work . 
  as far as i know china and india have twice that and work just fine . 
  i get your point though, 
  should have liberated the useless islands like we did in 2002 : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perejil_island_crisis, 
  inb4 jokes about the us ' georgia, 
  similar thing here ; many stores used a 100 pesetas = 1 euro ( as opposed to the more accurate 166 pesetas = 1 euro , often used as 6 euros = 1000 pesetas for mental calculations ) . 
  we still have a positive opinion of the euro apparently . 
  also , it 's not like italy had a particularly hard conversion . 
  why did n't stores use 1000 lira = 50 cents ? 
  ( or if they still wanted to win money , 1000 lira = 67 cents , which is still not that hard to calculate ; just use 3000 lira = 2 euros ), 
  to be fair , i 'm surprised that italy is more negative about it than greece . 
  hell , we are in roughly the same position as italy and we are more confident in the euro than average !, 
  kind of reminds me of andorra , which until the euro never had an official currency . 
  the spanish peseta and the french franc were the * de facto * currencies used . 
  to be fair , technically speaking you do n't need to carry it every time you leave your house , you just need to have it . 
  if you do n't carry it , you * can * legally be taken to the police station if police needs to verify your identity , but will not be charged with even a fine . 
  still , she 'd better deport them if she wants to do that . 
  otherwise the problem of not integrating them will get worse , not better . 
  to be fair , on my school we only did that twice . 
  first when we were taught to play rugby ( or american football , ca n't remember which ) . 
  the idea was that the boys tackling girls could be dangerous . 
  the other was when we ended a unit ( ie a sport ) , we 'd usually be given free time for 1 or 2 classes , but we had to play a sport . 
  boys usually played soccer , but girls often went with baseball for some reason . 
  however that 's because they wanted . 
  in fact , a non negligible ( like 3-5 ) amount of boys ( among them me ) , usually preferred playing baseball with the girls as opposed to soccer . 
  hell , my school was a huge private school and we did n't have a swimming pool !, 
  ( they considered building one at some point , but in the end they just went with a cheaper gym . 
  we did have a huge football field though ) most people here go in summer to various swimming lessons organized by your local town hall to learn how to swim . 
  they are pretty cheap . 
  one question : who would this apply to ? 
  only illegal inmigrants ? 
  all inmigrants ? 
  non-eu inmigrants ? 
  if it 's the first , i guess it 's not * that * terrible . 
  it at least makes some sense , though you 'd better deport them inmediately if you want to do that ( otherwise you 'll end up with a generation who does not speak french and wo n't be integrated at all , basically isis ' wet dream ) if it 's the later 2 , it 's not defensible at all . 
  like , why should someone who is legally in france and pays french taxes have to pay for his children education ? 
  like , i get it for say , healthcare to avoid people going to france just to get healed ( it 's actually a political issue here ) , but for education ? 
  if you or your children are in school you probably will stay in france for a long time , paying taxes and the like .
