   `` they 're absolutely fake , '' rajoy told the magistrates when asked about documents on which his initials appeared next to amounts of money that allegedly constituted under-the-table bonuses . 
   the documents _ known as the `` b\u00e1rcenas papers '' after the pp 's indicted ex-treasurer , luis b\u00e1rcenas _ were published by daily el pais in jan. 2013 and showed handwritten ledgers detailing the alleged payment of unaccounted-for bonuses in cash ranging from 5,000-15 ,000 euros ( $ 5,600-16 ,800 ) per month to high-ranking pp officials and businessmen between 1990-2009 . 
   `` everything about me is false except some thing or other , '' rajoy said of the information reported in 2013 concerning the b\u00e1rcenas affair . 
   when queried about cash handed over to the pp 's treasury for its illegal funding , rajoy said he had no knowledge of the matter . 
   `` i 've never heard anything about that , '' rajoy said , adding that he had never been in charge of his party 's finances . 
   `` my responsibilities were political , not accounting-related , '' rajoy claimed . 
   a month after the b\u00e1rcenas papers were published , pp employees broke into b\u00e1rcenas ' office at the party 's headquarters and absconded with his two personal computers , according to the former treasurer 's own account . 
   b\u00e1rcenas was put in pre-trial detention in june 2013 due to what judge pablo ruz of the national court described as `` a high risk of flight and to prevent the destruction of evidence . '', 
   a few weeks later , b\u00e1rcenas gave an exclusive interview to el mundo newspaper while in prison in which he said that everything in the papers was true and that the pp had been illegally funding itself for 20 years . 
   he added that the party had been receiving opaque money from businessmen and he , as party treasurer , would later redistribute the cash among top party members and covertly pay for cost over-runs in electoral campaigns . 
   b\u00e1rcenas is now a subject of several proceedings , including the `` g\u00fcrtel '' macro-trial _ which includes wednesday 's hearing _ and the so-called `` b\u00e1rcenas case , '' in which 32 people , including the former mayor of toledo and the ex-justice and interior minister , have been indicted . 
   the g\u00fcrtel case is the biggest political corruption scandal in spanish history , resulting in an estimated loss to the public purse of at least 120 million euros . 
   the case derived its code name from francisco correa , a pp-linked businessman who was arrested in 2009 on suspicion of money laundering , bribery , influence peddling and tax evasion , among other charges . 
   the word `` g\u00fcrtel '' in german is a rough translation of the spanish `` correa , '' which means `` belt . '', 
   correa was the alleged ringleader of a sprawling web of corruption that involved spanish politicians and businessmen alike and was a close personal friend of former conservative prime minister jos\u00e9 mar\u00eda aznar 's son-in-law , alejandro agag . 
   he also maintained close business and personal relationships with several mayors , city councilors and officials in regions governed by the pp , such as valencia and madrid , which allowed him to allegedly rig public bids for lucrative contracts and receive illegal commissions in exchange for his intercession . 
   as of july , more than 900 former and current pp officials had been convicted or were being investigated for corruption . 
   every year , the spanish treasury loses an estimated 88 billion euros due to public sector fraud and embezzlement . 
  tbh i 'd rather have people vote for the relatively clean puppet than for its dirty master, 
  even if you do n't like those 2 cs is both clean and a centre-right party, 
  [ here are the communities that call themselves nations in spain ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/historical_nations_spain.svg/1200px-historical_nations_spain.svg.png ), 
  while the muslim occupation did n't last long , it was taken by the moors for a while . 
  asturias was the place that did n't fall . 
  maybe cantabria as well , idk . 
  those 2 were also the places that took the longest for the romans to conquer . 
  the reason is the abrupt terrain on the area, 
  yeah , the ban was implicit , but some argue that it does n't apply to bullfighting ( like former governor lorenzo olarte , who actually passed that law ) . 
  then again considering how the catalonia ban was brought down maybe if someone brought the case it would be brought down too if it has n't already ? 
  not like we 'll ever know , the last bullfight in the islands happened in 1984 and it does n't look like it will ever come back, 
   last year the spanish congress `` ratified '' the support for bullfighting . 
  upn and pp voted in favor ; psoe and c 's abstained . 
  all the other political parties voted against , but it was n't enough . 
  for all what 's worth the 1991 ban in the canary islands was actually passed thanks to pp !, 
  ( and approved by unanimity ), 
  self governing ski station that doubles as a tax heaven, 
  yeah , basically . 
  i think constitutional court rulings work in a case by case basis but i 'm not sure . 
  alternatively other things may happen : the canary islands 1990 law may be constitutional but catalonia 's 2011 one not for some reason . 
  i 've also seen arguments saying that the canary islands ' law does not actually ban bullfights . 
  it 's unclear if it does since the last bullfight there happened in the early 80s while the law is from 1990 ( bullfighting never really took off in the canary islands ) . 
  the argument centers mostly on the fact that bullfighting is never explicitly named . 
  so depending on how you read the norm it may be a ban or not . 
  as for opinions , they are mostly split . 
  so for example former centrist governor lorenzo olarte said that no , the law does not affect bullfighting . 
  however in modern times the canarian representatives have claimed the law does ban bullfights in the islands . 
  here are 2 mostly reputable sources defending both sides of the argument , the case for [ the ban not affecting bullfights ] ( http://www.abc.es/cultura/toros/abci-mentira-prohibicion-corridas-toros-canarias-201610221807_noticia.html ) and [ the ban banning bullfights ] ( http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20100727/canarias-fue-primera-comunidad-prohibir-toros-1991/342132.shtml ) . 
  as for why it wo n't be challenged , 2 reasons : * bullfighting was never popular in the islands and it 's declining even further so no chance of bullfights happening any time soon * catalonia 's ban was opposed by the conservative and ruling pp . 
  meanwhile the canary islands ban was supported by that party . 
  for all what 's worth bullfighting is 100 % illegal in the canary islands . 
  and in catalonia it used to be that way but the ban got overturned . 
  i do think that catalonia 's regulations on bullfighting make it basically impossible to hold a bullfight though . 
  yeah , i agree . 
  i think with this everyone wins . 
  well , the question now is , will it be overturned like catalonia 's 2011 ban ? 
  or will it stand since no one will challenge it like the one in the canary islands from 1990 ?

  to be fair that seems to have been enough since the 2nd referendum had both higher turnout and a higher `` yes '' vote than the `` no '' in the 1st . 
  to be fair looking at the map there seems to be a remain but unionist area to the east of belfast on the coast . 
  maybe south belfast as well . 
  yeah , i think one of the reasons as for why we are very pro-eu is that when looking at our politicians even so-called `` unelected brussels bureaucrats '' look like a better option, 
  to be fair the largest country in the world by population ( china ) is definitely not a federation and barely gives any autonomy to its regions ( barring special cases like hong kong and even that one is temporary iirc ), 
  to be fair a `` one world government '' is not going to happen any time soon unless we find aliens or something that unifies the world . 
  well , i 'd say yes , but it 's also getting slowly better . 
  salaries are still terrible but at least unemployment is going down . 
  iirc we do n't have any materials resistant enough for one on earth . 
  i do remember reading that a moon space elevator * could * be built with current tech , albeit with a ridiculous price tag, 
  would n't work . 
  the us had a lot of difficulty holding iraq in 2003 , what makes you think libya would be easier ? 
  what about algeria , morocco or egypt ? 
  they are further away , but they are all stable and i guess could be persuaded to put camps ? 
  in a worst case scenario would reinvading libya and pacify it work ? 
  and how expensive would it be ? 
  ( my guess is that it would not be affordable even by the eu at large ) the new government would be essencially forced to accept the camps . 
  100 years, 
   well , glad you accepted that we have tried waiting for that change for foir decades . 
  catalonia voted for gonz\u00e1lez every time , what are you even talking about ? 
  if you are saying that both pp and psoe suck , then guess what , catalonia is still guilty !, 
  they voted psoe every time from 1977 to 2008 . 
  there was never a real possibility of a ciu led government so 2011 does n't really count ( neither does all the times the basque country voted for pnv ) . 
  if catalonia really wanted a 3rd option , it should have voted for ucd in the 70s ( it did n't ) , cds in the 80s ( it did n't ) , upyd in the late 00s ( it did n't ) or iu/pce any time ( it did n't ) . 
  2015 and 2016 do count with podemos , but guess what , the rest of spain does n't agree . 
  maybe a podemos led government will be a possibility in 2020 . 
  maybe not . 
  but catalonia alone should n't decide the next pm . 
  neither should any other place . 
  podemos and psoe lost in 2015-2016 , get over it just like pp voters did in 2008 . 
  pd : the time to replace rajoy was march of 2016 , but both podemos and the catalan parties refused to do so . 
  well , now we have rajoy again . 
  except madrid has an even larger fiscal deficit and they manage just fine . 
   the catalan fiscal deficit has fluctuated between 10 billion and 16 billion euros per year . 
  this means that between 1986 and 2010 , the spanish state has taken approx 214 billion euros in taxes generated in catalonia . 
  money generated in catalonia that never returned back . 
  that 's false . 
  in 2012 for example [ the fiscal deficit was 7439 million $ . ], 
  ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/vangdata/20150722/54434059371/ranking-deficit-fiscal-espana.html ) still a lot , but considering [ catalonia 's gdp in 2012 was 196011 million $ ] ( http://www.datosmacro.com/pib/espana-comunidades-autonomas/cataluna ) , that comes out to a fiscal deficit of 3.4 % . 
  higher than any european region if what you say is true , but not by much , and definitely nowhere near 10 %, 
  ok , let 's go back to say , 1994 . 
  back then spain was consistently voting in psoe governments led by gonz\u00e1lez , who was just as corrupt as rajoy now ( and catalonia voted for gonz\u00e1lez every time , from 1977 to 1996 ) . 
  and yet galicia ( for example ) never tried to become independent . 
  because losing an election is not a reason to become independent .
