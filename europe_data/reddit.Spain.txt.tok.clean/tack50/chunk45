   the political landscape is very fluid in spain right now , changes to the constitution that allow a referendum as a part of a pact to form a government is n't that crazy of an idea . 
  lol nope . 
  you 'd need 2/3 majority in both houses to pass a constitutional reform allowing a referendum . 
  then snap elections and 2/3 of both newly elected houses again . 
  even gonz\u00e1lez in 1982 was very far from that . 
  a non-binding referendum is a lot easier as it would just require a regular law though . 
  i think it could be passed today actually , with psoe+p odemos + catalan nationalists + pnv, 
   and we 're going to do it without a government !, 
  for all what 's worth we did pretty well without a government last year . 
  belgium also did nicely back on the day . 
  then again neither was in the middle of one of the most important negotiations in the history of the country . 
  for all what 's worth there was reciently-ish ( last local election ) an investigation on a vote buying scheme in mog\u00e1n , a touristy municipalty in the canary islands . 
  not sure if they were found guilty or not , but the alleged rate was 50 $ / vote . 
  i guess there are more vote-buying schemes elsewhere but they are n't that common . 
  to be fair we do n't use boxes to tick in our ballots ( except for the senate i guess . 
  do they invalidate it there ? ), 
  also , the question will be : do you want catalonia to be an independent state in the form of a republic ? 
  iirc they once depended on the sdlp for confidence votes or something like that . 
  did n't labour rely on irish nationalists once ? 
  wo n't the dup and uup support may ? 
  iirc they use self reported turnout for all age groups . 
  of course that 's too high but they claim that old people are as likely to overestimate their turnout as young people, 
  same here . 
  you can get an idea of who does a newspaper support by reading their editorials , but they never even do outright `` vote for x '' endorsements , let alone those kinds of covers . 
  to be fair , is n't tabloid just a size ? 
  all our newspapers come in tabloid format and they are ok . also tabloid  huge newspapers , at least for size . 
  i think we might become givers after brexit ( or maybe even without it we would be givers soon , like ireland ) . 
  but for the most part sure . 
  [ to be fair that happens with every country , spain is not an exception ] ( http://councilforeuropeanstudies.org/critcom/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/classification-of-regions-combined.jpg ), 
   i go a lot to rural areas and there is a lot of stupid investment , whenever there are european funds used for something they put a big panel with the exact amount spent and in what it was used . 
  some of the shit you see is incredible that it went through the administration . 
  if that is true , then i guess it 's basically plan e : eu edition, 
  i read reciently that may has a chance of losing her majority equivalent to trump being president . 
  ie not likely but do n't rule it out . 
  unfortunately polling errors in the uk benefit the tories so either she gets a huge majority ( if polls miss ) or a normal sized one ( if they are accurate ), 
  wow so apparently the uk is so poor they ca n't spend 250 million pounds in democracy :(, 
  maybe he wants a minority government propped up by the snp ? 
  as opposed to an actual coalition ? 
  snp/plaid ? 
  ( assuming you are scottish or welsh of course which most brits are n't ) i 'd also recommend the greens but again they have even less of a chance than the lib dems . 
  to be fair euro political parties are almost worthless . 
  merkel and orban are also in the same euro party . 
   the biggest mistake our social democrats ever made post-crash was to apply for membership in 2009 without a referendum . 
  to be fair , is n't that the usual route ? 
  ie negotiations begin and only when they end do people get a referendum ? 
  has any country held 2 ? 
  ( one to begin negotiations and one to enter ), 
   this summer , when he will begin to reform the labour law , it will be fun . 
  ie strikes am i right ? 
   and about the current , i 'd try to eliminate one-province communities because of administrative efficiency but it would be too complicated . 
  to be fair , not all 1 province communities are created equal . 
  i ca n't see the balearic islands for example having to be annexed by catalonia or valencia . 
  ( or split into 3 provinces ) . 
  however i can see navarra joining the basque country . 
  those are just the 2 extremes , there are more borderline cases . 
  not true at all , if you look at france 's neighbours they all have a proportional parliament with a prime minister and no president ( or a president who is just a figurehead ) , and of those only italy is really known for unstable governments . 
  spain , germany and belgium all use a parliamentary system with a proportional parliament and are stable countries . 
  i mean , considering that we changed the map in the 70s that is n't even accurate ( nowadays it would be santander , cantabria ) . 
  i personally prefer the [ modern day map ] ( https://www.msssi.gob.es/organizacion/ccaa/img/spain.jpg ) over the [ 19th century one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/espa%c3%b1a_-_divisi%c3%b3n_provincial_y_regional_de_1833.svg/2500px-espa%c3%b1a_-_divisi%c3%b3n_provincial_y_regional_de_1833.svg.png ) . 
  i personally feel cantabria should be it 's own region ( they even have a nationalist governor ! ), 
  and madrid as well ( otherwise it would dominate castilla la nueva ) . 
  la rioja is harder to defend but even it has its own distinct identity . 
  the current map is 100 % fine , other than the enclaves . 
  i 'd give ademuz to either aragon or castille-la mancha , trevi\u00f1o to the basque country and that bit of ciudad real in toledo to toledo , and do the same with all the enclaves all around the country ( except llivia which is in france ) then again we could do much worse . 
  just look at the [ 18th century map ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jnxd_s1z6n8/vyegesw-cei/aaaaaaaaade/y4j156vwppmrszktw7_cdmxwwk7krfuswck4b/s1600/espa%25c3%25b1a%2bintendencias%2bde%2bfloridablanca.png ), 
  i mean , i normally see that referred by the rivers , so you have the nile area , the tiger-eufrates area ( fertile crescent ) , the indu ( india ) and the yellow ? 
  river area ( china ), 
  maybe they 'll offer staying in the single market to the snp and lib dems in exchange for support ( and in the snp 's case , also no referendum ), 
  see : spain 2005-2007, 
  maybe a greek styled system where it 's proportional but the winner gets 100 extra seats or so ? 
  considering current events , the 46th president of the us will probably be mike pence . 
  i do n't know how likely it is for trump to be impeached , but add to that natural death ( trump is fairly old and does n't have the healthiest habits ) , resignation , assassination and the possibility of pence being the 2024 nominee and winning ( somehow . 
  maybe trump does make america great again ? ), 
  and my money would probably be on him as of today . 
  are you tired of winning yet ? 
  to be fair , as of today that is n't the case as republicans control the white house and both houses of congress . 
  but in most circumstances you are right . 
  ( and maybe even today seeing how republicans ca n't pass that healthcare law ), 
  they have had it for a long time , it 's called the lib dems . 
  currently polling at 9 % or so, 
  why ? 
  if people want more eu , then so be it right ? 
  is n't linke also anti eu ? 
  ( even if they might not want germany fully outside the eu ), 
  to be fair , if it passes a referendum then i do n't care . 
  on the other hand a referendum is not guaranteed :(, 
  the uk will never do that ( unless the lib dems win an overall majority i guess ? 
  not like that 's likely or even possible ), 
  for all what 's worth the `` yes '' was winning in votes in the eu constitution referendums , mostly thanks to spain 's one being a blowout ( 82 % yes ) even if it had low turnout . 
  not like it matters as it needed to be approved by every country , but still worth taking into account that among the places where a referendum was passed yes was leading . 
  that 's probably a reason as for why we are so pro eu . 
  when you look at spanish politicians even `` unelected brussels bureaucrats '' look like an improvement, 
  does this mean a catalonia style standoff in scotland now ? 
  so even if it 's say , fn vs unsubmissive france the right ( lr ) will turn out for the far left rather than the far right ? 
  seems an odd thing to do, 
  i guess [ this one ] ( https://xkcd.com/688/ ), 
  not quite , but as a fake churchill quote says `` the fascists of the future will call themselves anti-fascists '', 
  no idea . 
  i guess to defend the outermost regions ( canary islands , madeira , azores , french guyana , etc ) but then again 2/3 countries with outermost regions ( france and spain ) already have an aircraft carrier each . 
  yup , there 's an election in september iirc,
