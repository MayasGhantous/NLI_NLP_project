  i mean , brexit was a stupid decision , and may and corbyn may not be the best pm candidates ever , but they would still be good pms compared to trump . 
  i ca n't see may or corbyn behaving like trump is doing . 
  reminds me of how andorra declared war on germany on ww1 , but forgot to sign the peace treaty until 1939 ( yes , with hitler and shortly before ww2 ), 
  to be fair , there 's never been a us president as young as say , macron ( 39 years old ) . 
  closest seems to be theodore roosevelt ( 42 years old at inauguration ), 
  maybe there 's a `` pseudo hung parliament '' ? 
  as in say , conservatives on like 320 but can still get a majority easily with the northern irish parties ? 
  ( the dup and uup i guess ), 
   we picked the eea because we wanted trade and no political union , the fact that the agreement seems to be ever-expanding is making it difficult for people to see the difference between the eea membership we have now and a potential eu membership . 
  we 're not keen on the eu , in fact most polls show that 70 % + are against a membership in the eu . 
  yeah , eea is basically starting to look like `` being in the eu except you do n't get a vote '' which would be an stupid option to pick over actual eu membership . 
  i 'd say it 'd be around the same , or maybe slightly better for the remain side as that 1986 referendum was boycotted by the right and nato has stayed out of the spotight mostly . 
  on the other hand the far left is a lot stronger now than it was in 1986 and while in 1986 there was no alternative to pm gonz\u00e1lez ( who said he 'd resign if he lost the referendum ) nowadays it would n't be an issue if pm rajoy threatened with that ( hell , it might even be counter productive ! ), 
  so i 'd say it cancels out in the end . 
  probably between 55-45 and 60-40 . 
  actually , if you do the math the current crop of islam-related terrorism is slightly worse than the troubles in a `` dead per year '' basis . 
  troubles had around 116 dead/year , jihadis kill 130 people/year in europe . 
   spain always seems to be able to get out of conflicts because of their geographical position but now that they are in nato , they have an obligation to answer when called upon yeah , probably that 's also why there is a significant amount of people who want to leave nato ( although in terms of parties it 's only the far left who want to leave ) . 
  a referedum in 1986 failed by 57-43 for remain , but 4 regions ( catalonia , basque country , navarra and canary islands ) voted for leave . 
  actually , i did the math reciently comparing it to northern ireland 's troubles and eta in spain : * jihadi terrorists have killed 324 people in 2.5 years . 
  that 's 130 dead/year * eta killed 829 people in 40 years . 
  that 's rougly 21/year ( although at their height they killed a lot more , probably closer to 50/year but still ) * the troubles in northern ireland ( all sides , so including all terrorists and the police and everyone involved ) killed 3500 people in 30 years . 
  that 's 116 people dead per year . 
  it 's officially worse than even the troubles in northern ireland !, 
  for all what 's worth that puts the risk of a northern ireland related attack at 4/5 in northern ireland and 3/5 in britain . 
  i thought the ira had dissolved a long time ago ? 
  looking at hugarian parties , what happened to mszp ? 
  they seem to be the only left wing opposition ( with a meaningful amount of seats that is ) . 
  they were in government back on the day , so i guess they screwed up very badly and still have n't recovered . 
  not really . 
  the most relevant anti eu party in spain is the catalan cup . 
  it 's small sure , but the rest of spain does n't even have anti eu parties at all . 
  catalonia is not particularly pro eu though , especially compared to the rest of spain . 
  just look at the results of the 2005 eu constitution referendum, 
  yeah , france + us+r ussia was the best case scenario . 
  most likely was just russia as you say . 
  ignore it like he 's been doing since this started . 
  had pdecat settled for more money that extra money would go to catalonia instead of the basque country and the canary islands . 
  and there 's precedent for that , look at pujol and aznar . 
  but no , they had to insist on independence or bust, 
  fine , look at the canary islands then . 
  no fiscal autonomy and their nationalists only push for more money and autonomy . 
  never independence . 
  galicia is also a good example . 
  the process would go like this : - madrid triggers article 155 . 
  basically temporarily takes control of catalonia . 
  there 's no precedent for this ( it was threatened to the canary islands in 1989 when they planned to refuse complying with eu regulation regarding tariffs but in the end the canary islands government complied ) , so it 's a bit up in the air what would happen . 
  - if the independence declaration is actually defended militarily ( say , armed protesters or catalonia 's police force siding with the regional government ) then one of the emergency states could be called ( from weakest to most serious : alarm , exception and siege states ) . 
  there 's actually some precedent with this , as in 2010 the government called the alarm state ( weakest ) to stop an illegal air controllers strike and force workers to return to their positions . 
  if catalonia 's declaration of independence had actual military or paramilitary support behind it , then the exception state would be called to arrest the governor and regional government . 
  of course , this is basically `` tanks in barcelona '' so it 's extremely unlikely , but still worth talking about . 
  i think you need full approval from the un security council . 
  in a best case scenario i can see russia , france and the us letting it slip , but china and the uk probably wo n't ( especially china , who probably does n't want to give tibet and the like any ideas for independence ), 
  1 : i do think a referendum is viable without constitutional reform but only a non-binding one . 
  also if `` yes '' won independence ca n't still be given , it would just be a pressure mechanism to cs and pp 2 : the `` express reform '' happened because psoe+pp had more than 90 % of seats which means they can pass reforms without a referendum . 
  well , there 's already a `` spanish macron '' ( albert rivera and his `` citizens '' party ) and while he has been more successful than previous centrists like cds in the 80s and upyd in the early 2010s , peaking at 14 % and 40/350 seats ( better than any other centrist since suarez and the ucd in 1979 ) , he is still lagging behind the 2 main parties and even far left podemos . 
  now , rivera will be a winner with sanchez 's election as psoe leader ( imo the only sure winner ) , but i seriously doubt that he 'll be able to win the election like macron . 
  if sanchez steals enough votes from podemos while at the same time losing some on his right i can see rivera becoming the 3rd largest party ( with probably around 17 % of the vote ) but that 's about it . 
  he has no chance of outright winning . 
  oh , i already know that xd just sayin that the vote in 2016 and the political leans ' t do n't quite match . 
  the era of 2 party politics is over . 
  most likely scenario for `` pm sanchez '' is psoe+up + nationalists ( they would also need pnv or cc+nc+b ildu though , not just pdecat and erc ) only other option is psoe+c s + up which if it did n't happen last year wo n't happen now except maybe to force a new election like it was planned in murcia . 
  for all what 's worth there are 3 ways leading to pm pedro sanchez via no confidence vote : - psoe+up+c s ( unlikely ) - psoe+up+erc+pdec at + pnv - psoe+up+erc+pdec at + nc+cc+b ildu cc has already said they will not reach a deal with podemos so the 3rd route is unlikely . 
  the first is also unlikely . 
  it 's basically on pnv 's hand . 
  will they support sanchez or will the keep rajoy in exchange for money ? 
  tbh might also make podemos leaning voters from the errej\u00f3n side of the party to return to psoe considering podemos ' attitude . 
  too early to say tbh, 
  looking at that graph you 'd expect psoe to be winning the elections , with cs being the main opposition , podemos being what iu was back on the day and pp being a fringe far right party xd, 
  i thought aznar spoke english as well ? 
  ( and catalan with friends but that 's another story xd ), 
  sure , but he had no chance . 
  that was my `` best case scenario in 2017 for labour '' prediction . 
  obviously barely based in reality at all xd, 
  could n't have explained it better myself , thank you !,

  yeah , i meant a repeat of 2015 . 
  basically no net changes across the board . 
  i think the conservatives won one but that was about it with the popular vote being something like con 42 % lab 35 % lib 8 % then again that does n't seem likely at all . 
  i ran the numbers the other day , and a best case scenario for labour would be basically a repeat of 2015 . 
  i think labour lost 3 seats , the snp 1 and the conservatives gained 4 or something like that . 
  ( everyone else had no net change ) . 
  same here except there are n't even nationalistic anti eu parties . 
  ( at least relevant ones ) . 
  it 's basically a proxy for a general election , with maybe also acting as a platform to launch your new party as you only need slightly less than 2 % to get an mep ( compared to 3 % in madrid/barcelona for a general election or 5 % in many regional parliaments ), 
  more like eu but yeah . 
  the largest country led by a dad/mum is spain !, 
  here 's pm rajoy [ and his youngest son ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryjmhpigg4e ), 
   orban tried that . 
  unfortunately scarcity stil exists in energy production . 
  is it just for households ? 
  i 'd rather have capped energy bills than overly expensive ones . 
  i do n't know how the situation in britain is , but here the bills are definitely overpriced no idea about the question though , but i do think just for households would be better than for everyone . 
   why ? 
  uk universities are some of the most sought after in the world , again scarcity is a factor . 
  scotland has free university . 
  seems to be working fine for them . 
  maybe the rest of the uk should learn from scotland . 
  make foreigners pay for tuition if necessary ( but not brits ) . 
   ughhhh why ?
