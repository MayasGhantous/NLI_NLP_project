  i still wonder how is orban part of the epp . 
  is he really all that close to rajoy , merkel and the like ? 
  he seems like he would fit a lot better in the ecr ( with poland 's pis and the british tories ), 
  maybe they 'll all just join the eurasian union ? 
  it 's probably the eastern tram lines, 
  tbh 30-35c is not rare here either , especially in the southern half of the islands or santa cruz de tenerife ( las palmas and la laguna are colder ), 
  was n't sarkozy to le pen what hamon was to melenchon ? 
  ( ie a less radical version ), 
  also , barcelona also has a pretty nice metro, 
  same here . 
  ca n't remember any teacher who was hot . 
  any chance he becomes the next pm ? 
  well , spain ratified the eu constitution 82-18 bavk in 05 : /, 
  maybe some fillon without the baggage can win instead ? 
  has the schulzzug derailed or what ? 
  though a 4 point lead is not safe at all for the cdu . 
  also , apparently there 's a serious chance of afd not coming in 3rd , but in 4th instead ( surpassed by linke ), 
  or macron-melenchon, 
  nothing suspicious here comrade . 
  move along, 
  sure , but was n't france in the 80s ruled by socialist mitterrand ? 
  what about online education ? 
  here we have the uned , which allows you to get your degree online , only having to go to a centre for tests . 
  i think the industry in france was in the north , so deindustrialization probably . 
  as for the south , they were always conservative . 
  no idea why though, 
  i think she even came behind hamon there, 
  oh , sure , but if they had had a good relation they would have probably not backstabbed him in the first place . 
  maybe that relation deteriorated . 
  i often read that s\u00e1nchez was initially supported by susana d\u00edaz & co. as a `` useful idiot '' who would buy them time until she could run as prime minister , but that s\u00e1nchez did n't act like the useful idiot he was supposed to be . 
  but yeah , i do think the psoe has bad candidates . 
  out of the 3 that are running , only patxi l\u00f3pez is anywhere near good , and even he is n't all that great ( not to mention him having a very ambiguous program ) . 
  if i was forced to choose , i guess l\u00f3pez could stay as the `` centrist let 's get along '' candidate , but instead of s\u00e1nchez i 'd put someone else as the `` true left wing '' candidate ( most likely francina armengol , governor of the balearic islands ) , and also replace d\u00edaz , the `` right wing establishment '' candidate , with javier fernandez ( governor of asturias , leader of the interim commision ) . 
  those are barring random dark horse candidates of course . 
  not the greatest replacements in the world , but still a lot better than what is being offered . 
  if psoe can capitalize on that , sure . 
  ( sanchez and lopez might , but diaz will have a harder time ) if not , well , hope we like another 4 years of pp absolute majority after the next elections thanks to a divided and demoralized left :(, 
  see : early 1930s germany, 
  yeah , that what worries me the most about him . 
  does he really mean what he is saying ? 
  or is it just a strategy to stay as leader ? 
  for all what 's worth he never had a good relation with diaz and the rest of the * barones *, 
  sanchez is most likely hamon . 
  of course susana diaz could turn psoe into pasok 2.0 as well . 
  both have a risk of sinking psoe forever . 
  it just depends on how you want to risk it . 
  for all what 's worth their european parliament delegation is led by miguel urban , leader of the anti capitaists group inside the party , the most radical and left wing . 
  got 10 % on the last leadership election . 
  errej\u00f3n 's group ( the most right wing/pragmatic ) got 35 % . 
  interesting to see lasalle ( who got what , 1 % ? ), 
  taking several communes near the basque country . 
  was he some sort of regional candidate ? 
  i think he claimed to be between fillon and le pen, 
  link ? 
  wow , that 's some serious level of delusion . 
  i mean , i can see le pen winning under the right circumstances ( le pen v fillon , hamon voters and some of macron 's refuse to vote , melenchon 's voters break for le pen in surprisingly large numbers , le pen narrowly wins 51-49 ) , but her getting 50 % was ridiculous, 
  to be fair even if ps had been 100 % with hamon , in a 2nd round le pen/macron scenario they would have gone with macron regardless, 
  well , considering melenchon got 20 % or so , it is not dead at all . 
  why would they be salty ? 
  / theirgirl / got to the 2nd round after all . 
  i do n't think they had any hopes of actually winning . 
  yeah , me too :( oh well , that just means that the polls were right for once , not unexpected at all, 
  thanks ~ ~ obama ~ ~ rajoy, 
  similar here in spain . 
  the right does talk like that sometimes , but they rarely get that carried away , and do so in a more subdued way ( i do n't remember anyone saying `` viva espa\u00f1a ! '', 
  except for maybe the far right ) . 
  here 's rajoy for example ( famous for being one of his usual gaffes ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdoxhykw2jg ( spain is a great nation , and spaniards very spanish and lots of spaniards . 
  thank you very much ) meanwhile that never happens in the left ( who usually defends a more plurinational state ) . 
  in fact when [ the psoe leader campaigned behind a spanish flag ] ( http://images.eldiario.es/politica/pedro-sanchez-teatro-flickr-psoe_ediima20150621_0271_20.jpg ) it was seen as something huge . 
  great job !, 
  i have to say , hamon with his old weird tweets reminds me a lot of pedro s\u00e1nchez ( former psoe leader , running in the primary as the leftist candidate just like hamon ) . 
  he also had some very weird old tweets from when he never though he could be pm : http://www.elespanol.com/espana/20160301/106239410_0.html some of the highlights are : * help !, 
  my car run out of batteries in miguel fleta !, 
  * in the taxi on the longest way to my destination what should i say ? 
  what should i do ? 
  * is there any good mexican restaurant in pozuelo ? 
  * according to el pa\u00eds , spongebob squarepants is the leader on tv . 
  i also agree , just ask our kids . 
  i also like it as well . 
  * spongebob is unbeatable at home , not even real madrid can beat it !, 
  * be bad !, 
  good night friends !, 
  * happy 29th of february !, 
  reivindicating everyone 's right to a birthday, 
  well , that sucks and is unfair : / i guess go to ireland then ? 
  ( also speaks english and is cheaper than england/wales/ni ), 
  to be fair they could just go to scotland . 
  much closer and still british ( for now at least ), 
  yeah , but spain varies a lot from region to region . 
  here in the canary islands i only pay 1100 $ / year for an engineering degree . 
  i think catalonia is the most expensive by far . 
  idk where the cheapest is though . 
  depends on country . 
  here in spain franco 's party ( much better than the nazis sure , but still bad ) is still alive and takes part in our elections actually !, 
  ( although they only get like 0.05 % of the vote ) . 
  here 's their website : www.falange.es, 
  depends on country , but excluding ireland/uk it goes from like 15-20 % in eastern europe to like 90 % in the netherlands iirc, 
  the question then is with or without onion ? 
  yup , basically . 
  here in spain small stores are allowed to open , but not large ones , so small stores can compete against large companies .
