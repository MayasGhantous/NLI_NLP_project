  the greens ? 
  never said it did . 
  le pen is definitely worse . 
  to be fair , our main conservative party is also called people 's party and no one calls them populists : /, 
  he is anti eu ( albeit to a lesser extent than le pen ) and very far left, 
  both are nightmares ; just in different ways . 
   2/3rds of labour voters also voted to remain , and labour have pretty much ignored them whilst trying to park tanks in the opposite direction . 
   even within the tory party , there are those that are still very anti-brexit and see the party going too far to the right , my family and i included . 
  would n't all of those go for the lib dems ? 
  if they got 2/3 of labour 's vote and say , 1/3 of the tories plus their own voters they would probably have a shot at winning the election , or at least of coming in second, 
  i guess they could present candidates in england ? 
  for all what 's worth rajoy was defeated twice here ( 2004 and 2008 ) before finally becoming prime minister . 
  same thing with aznar ( 1989 and 1993 ) and gonz\u00e1lez ( 1977 and 1979 ) . 
  only pm who had never been defeated before in fact was zapatero ( 2004-2011 ), 
  according to polls he would have , polls overrated podemos . 
  but yeah , neither psoe nor podemos want deals with each other now , especially if diaz wins the primary in the psoe . 
  the likely coalition then was podemos + psoe+n ationalists psoe was opposed to it though , but the common thought was that they might concede that or something, 
  i guess that was ukip but that is falling because brexit already happened, 
  to be fair the only advantage is that mps are elected directly , which means they can vote against their party a lot easier . 
  here we use party lists and if you ever vote against your party you are most likely expelled unless you know very well what you were doing ( most likely you were already planning on splitting or something ) then again you can get the same with irv ( all the benefits of fptp with only some of the disadvantages ) but the uk dumbly rejected that in 2011 . 
  does romania have a large tourism industry ? 
  because if not then it makes sense . 
  most temporary contracts for students are usually temporary hires for like 3 months in the high season in summer . 
   it happened before brexit . 
  to be fair it technically happened after brexit . 
  brexit was the 23rd of june , spanish election was the 26th of june ( admittedly the 1st election was before brexit though , back in december 2015 ) . 
  but i do agree with everything else, 
  it 'd actually be the other way around . 
  the uk has to follow almost all of the eu 's laws but has not vote in them . 
  never . 
  they have come close ( 2 holding an election one year , the 3rd in the next year or the year before ) , but never the 3 at the same year . 
  here 's a list of all elections on those 3 countries france : 2017 , 2012 , 2007 , 2002 , 1995 , 1988 , 1981 , 1974 , 1969 , 1965 germany : 2017 , 2013 , 2009 , 2005 , 2002 , 1998 , 1994 , 1990 , 1987,1983 , 1980 , 1976 , 1972 , 1969 , 1965 , 1961 , 1957 , 1953 , 1949 uk : 2015 , 2010 , 2005 , 2001 , 1997 , 1992 , 1987 , 1983 , 1979 , 1974 , 1970 , 1966 , 1964 , 1959 , 1955 , 1951 , 1950, 
  any chance of labour coming in 3rd , even if it 's only in the popular vote ? 
  well , it technically is . 
  the uk could remain on the eea . 
  of course that 'd be dumb though , basically stripping the uk of their voting rights only to get farming and fishing back ( thoguh i think it would fit an independent scotland pretty nicely , almost more than standard eu membership ! ), 
  i think they won an mp , but that mp has since left ukip and become an independent so i guess no . 
  would n't the lib dems be the `` stop brexit '' party though ? 
  considering their terrible polling numbers , would labour block that ? 
  wait , what happened to that `` fixed parliaments act '' ? 
  is it getting repealed ? 
  is may voting `` no confidence '' against herself ? 
  i wish we had a 20h workweek :( but fine , you are welcome !, 
  kind of reminds me of `` el pais '' here . 
  very pro psoe , but only of its most conservative parts ( heirs of former pm gonz\u00e1lez ), 
  i guess the guardian is kind of a liberal newspaper ? 
  who do they generally endorse in uk elections ( assuming they even do endorsements ) ? 
  labour or the lib dems ? 
  honest question : why is everyone worried about a hypothetical `` president melenchon '' ( even if not as much as president le pen ) while no one was worried about a hypothetical pm pablo iglesias here ? 
  i mean sure , maybe iglesias was not going to pull spain out of the eu at all ( though he does want to reform it like melenchon ) , but he was a lot more in bed with venezuela than melenchon ( and iran . 
  oddly enough no russian connection ) is melenchon that much more extremist than iglesias here ? 
  seems like melenchon 's momentum has stopped . 
  in spain while most of our stikes have failed the last successful one was in 2002 . 
  an even more successful one happened in 1988, 
  to be fair not all referendums have ballots with questions where you put an x on the box . 
  here are [ the ballots ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/referendum_constituci%c3%b3n_europea_2005_espa%c3%b1a_%281%29.jpg ) for our 2005 eu constitution referendum . 
  they have the question but the answers are printed on the ballot already, 
  actually , spain at the time used a system very similar to the uk at the time ( fpfp or block voting ) . 
  ca n't find much info as most stuff is centered on the corruption of the system ( for example after the 1907 reform intended to make spain democratic , if there was only 1 candidate he was automatically elected , which made the system worse actually , giving more power to the powerful landlords ) . 
  for all what 's worth the democratic 2nd republic did use a system that forced a 2 party system ( partial block voting i think , which usually gives 75 % of seats in a constituency to the winner and 25 % to the runner up ) . 
  had it not collapsed and ww2 not happened , spain might have seen a 2.5 party system , with the 2 main parties being the `` popular front '' and the ceda , with maybe nationalists thrown in . 
  well , not even reddit as a whole is representative of us voters . 
  / r/the _ donald is also not representative of trump voters ( maybe of young trump voters ? 
  probably still not ), 
  yeah , i do n't know why he chose to mock that out of all things, 
  if what you think is that france needs thatcherism , i 'd say your candidate is fillon , not le pen , but i 'm not french so, 
  deport brexiters to england or wales and deport remainers to scotland/ni/london ? 
  sounds like turkey needs some freedom ^ ^ tm, 
  so just like turkey ? 
  they needed 3/5 + a referendum . 
  i personally think that 's better than 2/3 without it, 
  not really . 
  what led to the civil war was probably a long clash between the interests of the poor peasants and workers and the rich owners plus the instability of the 2nd republic those rigged elections ( although as more people became literate they were less rigged especially in cities ) did lead to instability when even when rigging the elections the 2 established parties could not rule , leading to primo de rivera 's dictatorship, 
  to be fair same happens in spain . 
  probably . 
  if franco had lived forever either he 'd have been removed in some sort of coup/revolution ( like portugal did ) or he 'd still rule spain to this day : /, 
  yeah , if you switch to a democracy when most people ca n't read and write , most likely you 'll get rigged elections . 
  it 's actually what happened in spain in the late 19th century . 
  on paper spain was a democratic country much like the uk at the time , with even universal male suffrage !, 
  on practice elections were not free , but instead were rigged for the 2 main parties to alternate on power giving the illusion of democracy when in reality it was more of an oligarchy of large landlords ruling the country people did n't notice as they could not read and write , especially in rural areas . 
  franco was definitely not the founder of a democratic state though . 
  the spanish equivalent would be either carlos arias navarro ( pm at the time of franco 's death , skipped in official counts as he is considered a `` francoist pm '' ) or adolfo su\u00e1rez ( next pm , is considered 1st pm of democratic spain , but of course he did win ( re ) election in 1979 after the constitution was ratified ), 
  to be fair , there 's nothing inherently wrong with presidential regimes if there are enough checks and balances . 
  the us do fine for example . 
  it 's just that they are very easy to turn into a dictatorship . 
  not just turkey ; venezuela is a text book example of turkey 's future ( minus the hunger and the oil ), 
  not exactly the same but we do have some notoriously conservative cities over here ( most notably madrid and valencia . 
  they did elect left wing mayors in 2015 and even a governor in valencia 's case , but in the general elections they went back to the right ), 
  actually , which was the largest city that did vote for trump ? 
  i think phoenix but i 'm not sure . 
  for all what 's worth there 's thankfully no relation between left/right and city/rural here . 
  madrid consistently votes for right wing candidates for example, 
  depends on the exact method of counting . 
  not a direct equivalent , but here in spain we usually have 50-60 % counted after 2 hours . 
  for all what 's worth spanish elections are also incredibly quick , with something like 50 % of the vote counted after 2h and 99 % after 4h . 
  we know the results before midnight, 
  it 's a turkish legend . 
  darth erdogan was a dark sultan of the turks , so powerful and so wise he could use religion to influence the turks to create dictatorships ... 
  no gaining ground too slowly :(, 
  do n't call it a grave , it 's the future you chose,
