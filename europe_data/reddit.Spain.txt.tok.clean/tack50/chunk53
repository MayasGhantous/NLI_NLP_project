  pretty sure melenchom is n't a nationalist . 
  still almost as dangerous for the eu as le pen, 
  little eu is so cute , 
  ca n't mods ( or op ) fix the title ? 
  interesting . 
  i would expect him to have quite a bit of leverage in his party actually !, 
  ( though obviously less than an actual former prime minister but still quite a bit ) . 
  then again out of the 3 people in similar positions here , 1 retired quietly from politics , though he is kind of involved in his party ; and the other 2 ran for different positions ( one for governor of his region and the other for several eu positions iirc ), 
  was n't he a former prime minister though ? 
  ( or former prime minister candidate at least ), 
  spoiler : hillary will win now the polls for the 1st round * are * wothin the margin of error for all 4 candidates . 
  so you gould get such weird mtaches such as melenchon-fillon , melenchon-le pen or le pen-fillon, 
  so like podemos here basically ? 
  does n't sound too bad . 
  we almost got pm pablo iglesias and people were n't worried . 
  how would a frexit referendum be like ? 
  melenchon + le pen does n't reach 50 % also , can the eu survive without france and the uk ? 
  by definition , you have a 10 % chance of being in the top 10 % ( probably less but still non negligible ), 
  they used to in the 50s iirc, 
  how is macron-melenchon close ? 
  would n't most voters go to macron just like in macron-le pen ? 
  to be fair we also had a `` radical party '' at one point ( 2nd republic ) . 
  they were centrists : /, 
  same here . 
  some have come close ( far leftist alberto garzon and centrist albert rivera used to have 50-55 % approval ) in recient years but they never had a chance of becoming pm . 
  how is that * bad * per se ? 
  i mean , should n't that increase tourism ? 
  or was it on the actual owners ? 
  ( ie tax break for rich people ), 
  wow , i 'm surprised . 
  even rajoy manages to get 3.3 / 10 ( roughly equivalent to 33 % approval i guess ) and he is considered to be hated by everyone but his party, 
  for all what 's worth i think no spanish prime minister has ever had a positive approval rating in the 21st century . 
  though we measure approval in a `` rate these politicians in a 0-10 scale '' instead though . 
  i think rajoy currently has like a 3.1 / 10, 
  to be fair they technically prefer `` neither '' also why do the greens prefer merkel ? 
  is it just me or fillon-a kinda looks like the spanish deputy prime minister soraya saenz de santamaria ? 
  similar to catalan/basque/galician here . 
  does n't the french prime minister have more power if they are from different parties though ? 
  kind of like reddit ? 
  to be fair the rest of former yugoslavia is not as pro eu ( except maybe montenegro ? ), 
  and they also know war on their land . 
  to be fair the european constitution was replaced with the treaty of lisbon which was very similar, 
  what if it was ( god forbid ) le pen vs melenchon ? 
  i thought overseas territories had partial excemptions on that and a couple other things ? 
  to be fair i think last year only the basque country , galicia and the canary islands were able to reach the debt objectives . 
  not like catalonia is n't terrible financially . 
  it is ( though the economy is still strong , the have relatively low unemployment iirc ), 
  never heard it but it does sound great xd, 
  yeah , such failed countries such as germany , france , the netherlands or denmark : /, 
   but i 'm talking the next 10-20 years - they ca n't leave you ( or you and bosna ) as the only non-eu country left in europe . 
  10 years from now is 2027 . 
  i doubt any new countries will enter the eu by then , except maybe montenegro ( and/or a hypothetical independent scotland or norway/iceland/switzerland if they decide to join for some reason ) . 
  20 years does sound reasonable though . 
   it 's not up to us even , eu would demand we accept the independence of kosovo , and even if they do n't , you have 1000 issues related to it . 
  how would a map of eu be drawn ? 
  with kosovo as a part or without ? 
  how would you teach what is a part of eu ? 
  with kosovo or without ? 
  alternatively i guess convince kosovo to rejoin , but that 's probably even harder , if it 's even possible at all . 
  to be fair , serbia probably has a higher chance of entering the eu than say , turkey . 
  then again that 's not saying much . 
  out of all the applicants i think only montenegro has a clear shot at becoming an eu member ? 
  ( unless iceland or norway change their minds and decide to enter , or scotland becomes independent ), 
  to be fair it 's not only the change that matters ; it 's also its speed ( 200 years is ridiculous in geological terms ) and what it brings ( agriculture becomes a lot tougher ), 
  old video ( 2014 ) but i thought it was worth sharing . 
  basically , inspired by stuff like this ( hilariously unrepresentative internet polls ) : http://www.forocoches.com/foro/showthread.php?t=4939650 i 've decided to poll / r/europe to see what people here would vote on eu parliament elections ( feel free to add other positions though , like national elections or even town hall ones ) here 's the poll : http://www.strawpoll.me/10799314 parties ordered by their amount of seats . 
  included options for `` others '' and `` not eligible to vote '' ( ie under 18 or not in the eu ) . 
  now , since many wo n't know the parties , here are they summed up slightly , with notable parties included : ** european people 's party ( epp ) ** : standard centre-right party . 
  notable members include : cdu/csu ( germany ) ; the republicans ( france ) ; po ( poland ) ; pp ( spain ) ; forza italia ( italy ) ; fidesz ( hungary ) ; pnl ( romania ) ; psd ( portugal ) ; nd ( greece ) ; \u00d6vp ( austria ) ; hdz ( croatia ) ; cda ( netherlands ) ; gerb ( bulgaria ) ** progressive alliance of socialists and democrats ( s & d ) ** the standard centre-left party . 
  notable members include : pd ( italy ) ; spd ( germany ) ; labour ( uk ) ; psd ( romania ) ; psoe ( spain ) ; ps ( france ) ; ps ( portugal ) ; sp\u00d6 ( austria ) ; sld-up ( poland ) ; social democrats ( sweden ) ** european conservatives and reformists ( ecr ) ** centre-right to just plain right and ( moderately ? ), 
  notable members include : conservatives ( uk ) ; pis ( poland ) ; n-va ( belgium ) ; df ( denmark ) ** alliance of liberals and democrats ( alde ) ** liberals and centrists . 
  notable members include : fdp ( germany ) ; d66 ( netherlands ) ; ciudadanos ( spain ) ; ano 2011 ( czech republic ) ** european united left/nordic green left ( gue/ngl ) ** far leftists ( most notably the former communist parties ) and ( softly ? 
  moderately ? ), 
  eurosceptic as well . 
  notable members include : akel ( cyprus ) ; die linke ( germany ) ; syriza ( greece ) ; sinn fein ( ireland ) ; podemos ( spain ) ; bloco ( portugal ) ** greens/european free alliance ( greens-efa ) ** green parties ; combined with independentist parties ( think of scottish or catalan independence ) . 
  notable members include : the greens ( germany ) ; europe ecology-the greens ( france ) ; snp ( uk , scotland ) ; erc ( spain , catalonia ) ** europe of freedom and direct democracy ( efdd ) ** basically eurosceptics and populists ( or at least that 's how wikipedia describes them ) . 
  notable members include : ukip ( uk ) ; m5s ( italy ) , sweden democrats ( sweden ) ** europe of nations and freedom ( enf ) ** far-right nationalists and eurosceptics . 
  notable members include : fn ( france ) ; fp\u00d6 ( austria ) ; pvv ( netherlands ) , knp ( poland ), 
  today is the anniversary of [ general francisco franco 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francisco_franco ) ( former dictator in spain ) death . 
  he ruled spain between 1939 and 1975 . 
  apparently [ since last year ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36613295/eu-referendum-farage-declares-independence-day ) june 23rd is now britain 's independence day , so congratulations !, 
  happy independence day !, 
   out of the seven basque regions wait i thought there are 3 ? 
  catalonia is also very rich i think, 
  yeah , there are lots of areas where the closest settlements would be tens of kilometers apart . 
  spain 's interior is very lightly populated with the exception of madrid , so places like extremadura , or both castilles can be pretty desolate . 
  i do think the nearest village will be like 30 km apart at most though so it 's not completely desolate ( although most of those villages will have populations of less than 1000 ) , but still very sparsely populated . 
  the worst offender seems to be an area sometimes called `` spanish siberia '' , with a population density comparable to lapland in northern finland !, 
  yeah , i personally feel like those exclaves and enclaves should be abolished . 
  so trevi\u00f1o goes to alava and villaverde to vizcaya or something, 
  at the national level not really but there have been lots of `` state level '' elections with terrible results . 
  castille la mancha up until reciently was an extremely strict 2 party system like the us . 
  and even now it 's very heavily 2 party centered because of the electoral system . 
  in the canary islands in 2015 the party that got the most seats actually came in 3rd in the popular vote !, 
  ( 18.2 % compared to the 18.7 and 19.7 of the winners ) . 
  not only that but a party with 0.63 % of the vote ( la gomera socialist association ) got 3/60 seats while cs got none with 5.94 % as you must get either 6 % overall or 30 % !, 
  in a single island to get seats . 
  also 17 % of the population get 50 % of the seats while the other 83 % get the other 50 % . 
  similarly other elections like the us where the loser won include catalonia in 1999 or the basque country in the 80s . 
  both again because of lightly populated places being overrepresented .
