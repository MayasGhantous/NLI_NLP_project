  to be fair i do n't get your argument about the greater basque country . 
  first some parts are in france so those are out of the question . 
  as for the others if they both consent there 's an option in the constitution for them to become one community but it has never been activated . 
  neither side really wants that . 
  there 's a pro union government in navarra but they have n't activated the article and i do n't think they will . 
  leon has a party for them to become its own community but it 's quite small . 
  again if they wanted i think they would be allowed but i 'm not sure on that one . 
  it would be ok as it 's own thing though , la rioja is smaller both in population and area . 
  finally castille is split because one castille would make no sense . 
  first it does n't really have defined borders ( does it include cantabria ? 
  everything except the former kingdoms of aragon and navarra in 1500 ? ), 
  also it would be too large in terms of area . 
  and madrid is better off as some sort of capital district . 
  to be fair catalonia only surpassed the basques in the last 7 years or so . 
  up until 2010 basques were the ones who wanted independence while catalonia was mostly quiet . 
  now the tables have turned . 
  well , not really . 
  i guess i could see myself voting for them under the right circumstances , but for all what 's worth i voted psoe ( hence the moderate part ) last time . 
  i would probably vote for them again if there was an election tomorrow . 
  well , let 's look at your positions  a global welfare state , downgrading diplomatic relations with the us and other countries that do n't have a fully representative democracy , skepticism for so called realists who appease republicans , mandatory and automatic voting with enhanced representation for the young , ed : social regulation of nationalism and condemnation of ultranationalism , and nonviolent sabotage or harassment against those who choose to harm the environment or take healthcare away from fellow humans several of those are n't really covered by any spanish party , but i 'd say the spanish far left ( podemos ) would be the closest to your positions i guess , particularly in condemning republicans , fighting against populist nationalists ( although they do love catalan and basque nationalists ) and environmental and health issues , as well as the welfare state . 
  well , not much . 
  i still consider myself a moderate leftist . 
  not much has changed since . 
  as of now yes but that 's a recient development . 
  up until like 2010 or so the basque movement was a lot stronger . 
  in fact even as late as the mid 00s they were pushing for becoming a `` free associated state '' kinda like puerto rico and the us , with the [ ibarretxe plan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ibarretxe_plan ) . 
  they even ( pushed for a referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basque_referendum,_2008 ) like catalonia is doing now !, 
  ( although the basque one was less ambitious and once declared unconstitucional they just forgot about it ), 
  ok , from largest to smallest : ** partido popular ( people 's party ) ** : the mainstream right wing party in spain . 
  supported mostly by old people , especially in the rural north ( castille-leon , galicia ) . 
  founded by a minister in the franco era . 
  ** partido socialista obrero espa\u00f1ol ( spanish socialist workers ' party ) ** : your average social-democratic party in europe . 
  supported mostly by old people , particularly in the rural south ( andaluc\u00eda , extremadura , parts of castille la mancha ) ** podemos ( we can ) ** : you average far left party . 
  they reciently absorbed the remainders of the old communist party . 
  supported mostly by left wing young people in large cities and catalonia/basque country . 
  only national party in favour of independence for catalonia ** ciudadanos ( citizens ) ** : formerly a social-democratic anti-independence party in catalonia , it has evolved into your average centrist and liberal party in all of spain . 
  supported mostly by young people . 
  also we have some nationalist parties , including * esquerra republicana de catalunya ( republican left of catalonia ) * : basically catalonia 's version of the scottish snp ( a left wing pro-independence party ) * partido dem\u00f3crata europeo de catalu\u00f1a ( democratic european party of catalonia ) * : a right wing pro-independence party * eh bildu * : a left wing pro independence basque party . 
  some ties with the terrorist group eta i think . 
  * basque nationalist party * : a right wing basque party that is opposed to independence but still wants more self governance and investment . 
  * canarian coalition * : a centre-right canarian party opposed to independence but wanting more self governance and investment . 
  i think you forgot cs ? 
  ( although its presence in the basque country and navarre is really small ) . 
  also since you are covering navarre you forgot upn . 
  also spanish , but one who studied with the system before the current one ( loe : 2006-2015 ) , not the 80s egb law from the franco era . 
  most stuff applies to us as well . 
  probably to the new lomce students as well , and to the logse students ( early 90s-2006 ), 
  to be fair , do n't americans have to pick non related subjects in university as well ? 
  i keep hearing that from american redditors . 
  so for example a spanish engineering student only really has engineering related subjects throughout the 4 years , but an american student might have stuff like history or the like which are n't related to engineering . 
  i also think i 've heard americans have a lot of choice on those kinds of subjects , while here you just decide between a few pre-determined paths . 
   where ? 
  well , at least where i studied many teachers gradually phased out homework . 
  by year 11 only the maths and physics teachers were putting up homework and even then it was optional ( ie for you to study for tests ) . 
  you might be given `` assignments '' though , which are actually worth quite a lot , but you are normally given like 3 every year or so for each subject . 
  first of all , let me say that this all applies to when i was in high school , but the law has reciently changed and some parts may not apply anymore . 
  should be mostly accurate though . 
   do you grade in the same way america does with a 90 % + being an a , 80-89 being a b , 70-79 being a c , 60-69 being a d , and 59 % - being an f ? 
  and do grades go by semester or something similar ? 
  first , we grade exclusively using numbers , on a scale of 0-10 ( with usually 1 decimal ) . 
  also , the passing grade is 50 % ( ie 5/10 ) , not 60 % . 
  and while grades go on a trimestral basis ( ie 3 reports a year ) , only the 3rd and final report really counts ( the other 2 serve just as an orientation ) . 
  finally , from year 7 on ( when you start the spanish `` high school '' , called eso ) if you fail a subject in june when the year ends you get a 2nd chance in september . 
  if you fail 3 or more subjects you must repeat the year . 
   how many classes will a high school student typically take ? 
  in america it will typically be 6 . 
  also , some schools have all 6 classes a day , some alternate with 3 a day , and some have 3 each semester and you change classes half way through the year . 
  do you use any of these ? 
  depends on the year , but the number is usually between 8 and 10 or so . 
  for reference here are my subjects for 2 different years : * year 9 : 1st language ( spanish ) , foreign language ( english ) , 2nd foreign language ( german ) , math , biology , physics & chemistry ( counts as 1 subject ) , social sciences , physical education , computer science * year 12 : 1st language ( spanish ) , foreign language ( english ) , 2nd foreign language ( german ) , spanish history , math , physics , philosophy , chemistry ( this time as a separate subject ) . 
  also , no , in high school all your classes last for the whole year . 
  as for how many classes you have in a day , you normally have 6 classes a day of like 50 minutes each , with a usual school day being like 8:30 -14:10  how do advanced classes work ? 
  in america , you can typically choose between 2-3 levels of the same class . 
  for example , european history ( basic ) , honors european history ( difficult ) , and ap european history ( college level ) , if there 's only two levels , ap is usually the one that is n't there . 
  they are all introductory level and it 's usually totally up to the student to which they take . 
  there are no advanced classes whatsoever in spain . 
  every student learns the same . 
   is it true that you have an integrated system ? 
  for example , in america , you can take biology , chemistry , physics , anatomy , and more depending on the school in any order you choose ( with exceptions ) . 
  the integrated version of this would be just having `` science '' , or just having `` math '' rather than algebra , geometry , calculus , etc. 
  depends on the subject . 
  some subjects are partially integrated . 
  so there 's a subject called `` biology & geology '' which combines the 2 and another called `` physics & chemistry '' which combines those 2 as well . 
  however math is indeed very integrated , so you have one math course with everything instead of separate algebra , calculus , geometry , etc courses  how big is europe on elective classes ? 
  we can choose a few classes a year that are totally optional , like jrotc ( military class ) , welding , woodshop , etc. 
  well , here in spain you do n't really have any choices whatsoever until year 10 ( some schools give you a small choice on year 9 but mine did n't ) . 
  after year 10 you do have choices but elective classes are n't really a thing . 
  so you must always have a certain amount of subjects , and if your school is small you might not even be able to have certain combinations !, 
  ( like say picking both latin and physics ) . 
  instead the school will probably provide a pre-determined path . 
  also , keep in mind that you have to choose between one of 3 paths for the most part : science ( math , physics , biology , etc ) , `` letters '' ( social sciences , economics , etc ) and arts but no class is completely optional . 
  if you do n't take a certain class it 's because you are taking something else instead . 
   i 've heard there 's no homework in some countries , is this true ? 
  ( and elaborate if it 's an oversimplification ? ), 
  this one probably varies wildly from school to school but anyways . 
  in my experience homework is mostly a thing in primary school ( up until year 6 ) . 
  after primary school it is gradually phased out . 
  so in years 7 or 8 you will still have some homework but by year 10 it should be just optional . 
  some teachers , particularly in science related subjects ( math and physics ) will still put up homework , but it 's normally either just optional for you to study or only counts for the `` work in class '' part of the subject which is almost always worth just a point ( 10 % ), 
  yes , but corruption and cronyism is rampant .
