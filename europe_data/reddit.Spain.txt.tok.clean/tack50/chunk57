  i do n't think catalonia should become independent . 
  however , i do know that the status quo is not working and that something should be done about it . 
  i personally favour catalonia having a referendum , but only if they get huge majorities . 
  something like 2/3 of the regional assembly and then a referendum like montenegro 's ( which required 55 % in favour to pass instead of the usual 50 % and a minimum of 50 % turnout ) , with a clause that if the referendum does n't pass , it ca n't be repeated in at least 20 years . 
  i also favour a federal system that makes everyone fit in spain . 
  lots of regions in spain have regionalist movements , normally demanding more devolved powers and investment in the region . 
  [ here 's a map of regionalist movements in spain ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/separatismos_na_espanha.svg/1250px-separatismos_na_espanha.svg.png ) however , most of them do n't want independence . 
  really it 's only catalonia and the basque country who want it . 
  most other independence movements have roughly 1 % support . 
  yeah , rajoy has a lot of mistakes like that when speaking xd . 
  he might not be the best pm , but he is definitely one of the funnier ones . 
  i guess any island not named gran canaria or tenerife in the canary islands or not named mallorca in the balearic islands is the closest thing . 
  the outdoor activities are obviously a lot different than montana 's ( mostly surfing and beach stuff , though mountains still exist , with the [ tallest mountain in spain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teide ) being in the canary islands ) , but it 's just as isolated if you do n't like beach stuff or outdoorsy stuff . 
  the largest `` minor '' island is lanzarote in the canary islands , with 141k people . 
  the smallest one is formentera in the balearic islands , with only 7700 people . 
  there are large cities in both archipielagos ( palma de mallorca , santa cruz de tenerife and las palmas de gran canaria are all medium to large cities in spain ) , but since they are islands , you 'll have to take a ferry to even get there . 
  and of course for everyone not in the islands it 's a lot further away in the first place . 
  so yeah , i 'd say the `` minor '' islands are the closest thing to `` spanish montana '' , although it 's probably closer to a `` spanish hawaii '' tbh . 
  it 's a different kind of isolation i guess . 
  normally no . 
  although as a spanish federalist i do wish they mentioned the us as a great example of a federal country ( has some mistakes sure , but in terms of `` states rights '' the us are pretty good ) . 
  something like the `` united states of spain '' . 
  interesting . 
  we do call it a `` quarter pounder '' ( cuarto de libra ) here even if no one uses pounds . 
  tvs and wheels ( and maybe pipes as well ? ), 
  are measured in inches . 
  and even then they often include the metric equivalent everything else uses metres . 
   not at all . 
  catalonia has like +90 % of its people being proeu not even spain at large has that many and catalonia is one of the least pro eu places in spain actually !, 
  just take a look at the 2005 eu constitution referendum [ results map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/yesvotespainreferendum.png ) . 
  and catalonia is the only autonomous community with an openly anti eu party represented in the assembly ( cup ) . 
  granted , 64 % support or so is still a lot , but still very far from the national average of 82 %, 
   it is , but the fact that this group has members ( pp ) that have been proved to manipulate elections , citation needed . 
  also , pp is far from the worst in epp . 
  orban is also on epp and he is probably much worse . 
  flair checks out :p, 
  probably like our flag during the francoist era . 
  i will say it 's pretty though , but should n't be used ( except for historical accuracy ) because of what it represents, 
  yeah , wages are quite low as well . 
  the median salary is around 20k $ , but my area ( canary islands ) is poorer than the national average so i guess salaries are also lower . 
  on the other hand i 've often seen that we have the highest prices for groceries and the like , so it might actually be expensive for spanish standards !, 
  ok , so here are some prices for my town : * coffee ( vending machine ) : 55 cents * beer ( at a bar , 25cl ) : 1 $ * beer ( at a supermarket , 33cl ) : 50 cents * litre of milk : 80 cents * bread ( baguette ) : 55 cents for a small one , 1 $ for a large one * bread like [ this ] ( https://airos.es/temas/45-singluten-pan-de-molde.jpg ) : 2,75 $ for one package . 
  * transportation ticket ( city bus ) : 1,40 $ . 
  there are 10 trip tickets for 8.50 $ though ( so , 85 cents per trip ) * eating out ( 2 course menu ) : 9 $ . 
  * eating out bocata , looks like [ this ] ( http://s04.s3c.es/imag/_v3/evasion/640x450/bocata-calamares.jpg ) basically a sandwich but with hard bread : 2.70 $ * cinema ticket : 5 $ * rent : varies a lot , but i guess somewhere around 500 $ a month ? 
  i mean , i do have it in my home , but it 's limited to just 2 rooms , not central ac . 
  for all other rooms a regular fan works fine . 
  i do n't have an air conditioner in my room , so no . 
  i do have a fan like [ this one ] ( http://www.fmcalefaccion.com/129-thickbox_default/ventilador-techo-vt-classic-105.jpg ) . 
  if it 's very hot then sure , i 'll have it on all night long because i ca n't put it on a timer . 
  however the best thing you can do wheter you use ac or a fan is to put it on a timer . 
  that 's what i did when i had an upright fan like [ this one ] ( http://www.leroymerlin.es/img/r25/08/0801/19472572/19472572_z1.jpg ), 
  we are basically the civil war capital of europe at this point . 
  we had the spanish civil war in the 20th century , the 2 or 3 carlist wars in the 19th century , the war of independence ( against a puppet government controlled by france ) , the war of succession in the early 1700s , etc , etc, 
  should take a note from lord buckethead 's manifesto and do a referendum on whether there should be more referendums :p, 
  best : adolfo suarez . 
  he did transition spain into a democracy successfully after all . 
  worst : everyone else . 
  depending on who you ask ones will be worse than others but all are seen as either inept , corrupt , or both compared to current : rajoy has been a very corrupt pm . 
  his performance as also not been the greatest ( although it 's still acceptable i guess ) . 
  compared to the others he is not that much more corrupt than gonz\u00e1lez or aznar , but aznar saw good economic performance ( albeit unsustainable ) and gonz\u00e1lez supposedly modernized the country . 
  rajoy 's performance is mediocre compared to both but still a lot better than zapatero , although zapatero was at least the least corrupt pm we have had . 
  yeah i remember lying about my age to get an account on social media . 
  in fact everyone did that . 
  and here with spanish social networks like tuenti . 
  although it 's technically alive as a phone company ( somehow ) , but the social media stuff has been dead for years now . 
  see : 2011 av referendum . 
  fptp is terrible imo , but if brits like it then good for them !, 
  does n't poland have a prime minister ? 
  there 's your `` president '', 
  i wish we got that . 
  i 'm happy with the current system ( although the senate needs some serious reform ) , but stv is the best electoral system imo . 
  you vote for candidates not parties and it 's representative . 
  add to that open primaries ( like the us or france ) and you get the perfect electoral system, 
  yeah . 
  also worth noting we are quite weird compared to the rest of europe in eating habits apparently . 
  we eat lunch and dinner quite late . 
  same here . 
  there was a short while when it seemed like it could get seats ( 2014 , around the time of the european parliamentary elections ) , but not anymore . 
  the party in question , vox , went somehow from 1.5 % of the vote ( just enough for 1 mp if they got 3 % in madrid which seemed fairly likely ) , to 0.2 % ( 0 mps obviously ), 
  i also use pavos a lot !, 
  there are dozens of us !, 
  dozens !, 
  one of the most popular , at least on the right , is that basque terrorist group [ eta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eta_ ( separatist_group ) ) were the ones behind the [ 2004 madrid bombings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_madrid_train_bombings ) , instead of al qaeda . 
  it usually has the main centre-left party ( psoe ) involved in it in order to help win the elections , saying that they destroyed evidence that it was eta and what not , often directly involving then former and future minister alfredo p\u00e9rez rubalcaba . 
  it 's basically `` jet fuel ca n't melt steel beams : spanish edition '', 
   spain is de facto a federal country . 
  only the name would change . 
  i 'm sure there are federal states out there with less devolved matters than some spanish autonomies . 
  yes and no . 
  so sure , there are federal states where the states have less powers than the spanish autonomies ( i do n't think any federal state has anything comparable to the basque and navarra 's concierto to begin with ) . 
  however spain is not a federation . 
  maybe de facto , but not completely . 
  for example to reform the estatuto you need approval from the central government . 
  meanwhile states in the us for example do n't need approval to reform their state constitution . 
  anyways , this is a good video explaining why spain is not a federation even though the autonomias have comparable powers to germany 's lander ( which is a federation ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjohosfbgt8, 
  i do n't think the diputaciones should be outright abolished . 
  the basque ones seem to work just fine , and so do the cabildos in the canary islands and concells in the balearic islands ( one per island ) . 
  just making them directly elected ( like the cabildos and basque diputaciones ) should be enough for them to become less corrupt , but i think they can fulfill some roles ( at least many are opposed to diputaciones being outright abolished ) . 
  i get that islands are different so that 's probably why cabildos/concells do work fine , but why would diputaciones work fine in the basque country but not anywhere else ?
