  i did the math the other day and the presence of anti eu populists had a pretty nice correlation with how large a country was . 
  so for example malta or slovenia barely have those while of the top 6 only spain has none ( technically poland as well but i think their current leaders are not exactly pro eu ) . 
  wait , does n't ireland have counties and regions ? 
  so , what is the best source then ? 
  i do n't know how good radio is ( i 've heard good stuff about rne ) , and newspapers are also bad as discussed earlier . 
  yeah , i agree , the spanish newspaper landscape is depressing :( it 's not as bad as say , the uk , but it 's definitely not good . 
  i think tv is a better source ( telecinco probably being the best surprisingly , with tve in second ), 
  for all what 's worth spain voted 82-18 in favour of giving the eu more powers with the eu constitution back in 2005 , so i 'd say that makes us pretty pro eu . 
  we also do n't have any `` exit the eu '' movements , and while not everyone is happy with it , even our euroskeptics do n't want to leave ( usually just wanting a more social and less neoliberal eu , whatever that means ), 
  i 'd say he would fit just fine in psoe ( centre-left socialists ) , probably among the centre of that party ( patxi l\u00f3pez branch ) . 
  as for him having a chance , psoe is currently having some trouble staying relevant , but considering he is a good speaker maybe he would be able to keep the party afloat ? 
  as for actually becoming pm , probably , but only if he accepts a referendum in catalonia or wins a decent sized victory which allows him to overcome catalan nationalists . 
  losing power , but easily getting it back ? 
  once or twice a day . 
  my house has some bad wiring or some problem so the surge protector ( the thing that shuts down electricity in case of a short circuit/you sticking your fingers in the outlet ) does a lot of false positives , shutting down electricity once or twice a day . 
  however it 's easily fixed by going to the mainframe and flipping the switch back to the on position . 
  if you have a lot of stuff plugged in at once , overcoming the power allowed for your house , another switch will shut down your electricity so you are not consuming more than you are allowed . 
  again easily fixed , just turn something off and flip the switch back on . 
  this is a lot rarer though , only happens like once every 6 months . 
  as for losing electricity and having to wait hours , i think i 've only had that problem 2 or 3 times in my entire life and i 've been living here for 15 years . 
  once we partially lost electricity after heavy rains because water got inside the walls or something like that ( we gradually recovered it , first the lights and then the outlets , with the upper floor first ) . 
  another time due to scheduled mainteinance . 
  and another time during a lightstorm iirc . 
  yeah , it 's all in spanish with no subtitles . 
  probably intended only for spaniards and to a lesser extent latin americans . 
  sure !, 
  for example for learning stuff like maths and sciences we have [ unicoos ] ( http://www.unicoos.com/ ) . 
  basically it 's spanish khan academy . 
  it 's only aimed at high school level though ( roughly years 7-12 , with some early university stuff ) . 
  also it only has maths , chamistry and physics stuff available so it 's more limited . 
  for all what 's worth it helped my classmates a lot back in the day . 
  many would n't have passed maths were it not for that website . 
  ok , so the powers of our upper house ( senado ) are : ** powers ** * delay bills for up to 2 months * propose ammendments ( these ammendments must be accepted by the lower house ) * power to block constitutional reforms . 
  normal constitutional reforms need at least 50 % +1 there . 
  major ones affecting basic rights , the form of the state ( monarchy/republic etc ) need 2/3 ( or 90 % if the government wants to avoid a referendum ) * in case a region does not follow spain 's laws , the government can remove that region 's devolved powers with a majority in the senate . 
  never used though , but was proposed in the late 80s to the canary islands ( refused to remove tariffs when we entered the eec ) and reciently catalonia ( obvious reasons )  what is the point of your upper houses ? 
  are they figureheads , or do they have legitimate power ? 
  on paper , to represent territories ( kinda like the us senate ) . 
  on practice , a retirement 's home for old politicians , for the most part . 
   do they politically lean differently than your lower house ? 
  yes , our senate leans conservative because there are lots of small conservative provinces while not that many left leaning ones . 
  the last time there was a left wing plurality there was in 1993 . 
  so while pp ( right wing ) only holds 137/350 seats in the lower house , they hold 149/266 senators  has your country considered abolishing them ? 
  yeah , senate reform is often proposed , but no government thus far has gone ahead and reformed it or abolished it . 
  ** method of election ** so the spanish senate is actually mostly directly elected . 
  for the most part there are 4 senators per province . 
  in island regions and the 2 enclaves in morocco things work a little differently . 
  so the large islands ( gran canaria , mallorca , tenerife ) have 3 senators , and the minor islands ( ibiza-formentera , minorca , lanzarote , fuerteventura , la palma , la gomera , el hierro ) have only 1 . 
  the 2 enclaves in morocco ( ceuta and melilla ) have 2 each . 
  however , that only is 209 of the currently 266 senators . 
  the rest are actually appointed by regional assemblies ( the equivalent to american state legislatures ) . 
  each community gets 1 senator , and 1 extra senator for every million people . 
  ceuta and melilla get none , and the island regions ( canary islands , balearic islands ) do not get special treatment here either . 
  also , those senators must be appointed in a way that they represent the legislature 's makeup ( or at least that it 's not too distorted ) . 
  the main problem is that provinces are simply not a good place for territorial representation , as the division that matters more is the autonomous community ( kind of like a us state or german land ) . 
  so communities with more than 1 province are unfairly overrepresented . 
  for example castille-leon ( a mid sized community , but one that is huge in area , with 9 provinces ) has 39 senators , while la rioja has 5 . 
  in an ideal system all communities would have the same amount of senators , or at least they 'd be apportioned in a way that made sense . 
  i want the us to do fine , just like i want my country to do fine . 
  same applies to the uk and any other country really . 
  as for an opportunity to distance itself from the us , i do n't think that will happen . 
  trump will probably be like george w bush , just a small parenthesis in the long run, 
  he 's referring to your mps . 
  so assuming you are pro-independence either rufi\u00e1n and the like ( if you voted erc ) or whoever is in charge of pdecat in the national parliament now ( if you voted cdc ), 
  while in spain we do have districts in our elections , most of the time they do n't represent the citizens of the district but the national party , with extremely few exceptions . 
  the only exceptions are the nationalist parties , where they do represent the region they were elected from because that 's their job ( so basque nationalists will defend the basque country for example ) . 
  as of now 3 regions have such parties directly elected : canary islands ( cc , 1/350 mps ) , basque country ( pnv+b ildu , 7/350 mps ) and catalonia ( erc+pdec at , 17/350 mps ) some other regions have regionalists represented via deals with larger parties , but in these cases the regionalists compromise more . 
  2 nationalist parties have complete control and are de facto independent though : nc ( canary islands , 1/350 mps , contested the election with centre-left psoe ) and comprom\u00eds ( valencai , 4/350 mps , contested the election with far-left podemos ) that basically means that while my district has several mps , only the nationalist mps will explicitly care about the district . 
  everyone else does not . 
  and if you live somewhere without nationalist movements ( say , madrid ) then you are out of luck . 
  yeah i agree . 
  some argue that s\u00e1nchez 's reelection will help but i 'm not sure . 
  on one hand it 's true that some are unhappy with podemos , especially on the more moderate errej\u00f3n wing . 
  maybe psoe will gain those voters back . 
  on the other hand s\u00e1nchez might not be the best candidate to do so , and he seems to be compromising quite a bit with the right wingers in his party so his move to the left might have been just an strategy . 
  hoping that it is n't though . 
  otherwise with a demoralized left and united right it 's pp+c s forever ( or at least until like 2024 or so ) . 
  rajoy reminds me quite a bit of a right wing felipe gonz\u00e1lez though , so maybe he will stay for a long time just like gonz\u00e1lez did . 
  right wing nationalist parties ( ciu in catalonia , pnv in the basque country , cc in the canary islands ) have almost always supported the government whenever we get a hung parliament . 
  they are open to supporting both psoe ( gonz\u00e1lez iv ) and pp ( aznar i , to some extent rajoy ii ) led governments . 
  nowadays catalan nationalists only want independence so they are out , but basque and canarian nationalists are still very pragmatic and support the government in exchange for more investment in their regions ( like we saw with the budget ) . 
  centrist party cs has also been open to supporting both psoe and pp led governments ( not podemos led ones though ) , but in most cases they join with pp since psoe+c s alliances rarely have a majority . 
  not much . 
  our mayor is not really doing that great of a job . 
  he is n't completely terrible ( lots of councils in the island are a lot worse off , but that still does n't mean that the mayor is doing a good job ) as for how difficult it would be to become a councillor , first i 'd have to officially join a party . 
  then convince someone to put me in the party list of councillors in a high enough spot to get elected . 
  in other words , unless you know a politician it 's quite hard to get elected to anything in spain . 
  most like to live in : probably california . 
  good weather , good labour market , seems pretty good for most stuff . 
  only downside is that it 's too expensive iirc . 
  least like to live in : alaska . 
  it 's a beautiful state , but definitely way too cold and remote for me . 
  being a red or blue state would be the least of my worries tbh . 
  of the red states i guess i 'd probably like florida or south carolina and dislike alaska and the dakotas while of the blue ones i guess i 'd probably pick california or virginia and dislike maine . 
   what are the colors in france ? 
  red = left ( they normally have the words `` socialist '' , `` social democratic '' or `` labour '' in their name ) blue = right the us apparently used those colours until the late 90s in some stations , but moved to red = republican for some reason https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgz3p4cexzu, 
  you are now a moderator of / r/pyongyang, 
  the canary islands do n't have any rivers so yeah . 
  most water comes from either underwater , rain stored in dams ( this one almost exclusively for agriculture ) or desalination plants . 
  yeah , kinda similar here .
