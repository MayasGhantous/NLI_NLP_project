  you need one of the official `` masters degree in x engineering '' to be considerered an official engineer here . 
  lawyers also need a similar masters degree to practice law .

  sure !, 
  wales reenters the eu while the rest of britain remains outside :p, 
  probably florida with all the retirees , sunny beaches and the like . 
  another option could be california , but poor . 
  probably lol, 
  i do have it ( bbc world news ) , but i rarely watch it . 
  if i 'm looking for an international news channel i 'll normally watch euronews instead . 
  it 's included in almost all satellite tv deals , so i guess somewhere around 20-30 $ a month ? 
  when i 'm abroad the bbc is my source of information if i ca n't find the international tve spanish channel though . 
  i guess then stick with just moving across the country ? 
  unless those northern italy independentists win i guess . 
  either luxembourg or strasbourg . 
  both are excelent choices, 
  yeah , the 1898 colonies ( except maybe the philippines as they are actually larger than spain itself !, 
  ) + western sahara would probably be the upper limit . 
  even cuba would be hard to manage . 
  puerto rico + western sahara + all those islands in the pacific would be fine though . 
  also , the canary islands are already quite far from mainland spain and yet they are still part of the country just fine . 
  ca n't see why it 'd be different with other places . 
  f1 is pretty popular ( though it 's been declining reciently since it moved to satellite/cable as oposed to regular tv ) mostly thanks to fernando alonso , who put it in the map when he became the first spanish pilot to actually be good ( that was around 2004 or so , shortly before he won his first championship ) . 
  moto gp is also very popular , probably because we have several good pilots there ( jorge lorenzo , dani pedrosa , etc ), 
  [ relevant video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwg5g565pvg ), 
  it 's a good flag . 
  not the absolute greatest , but it 's recognizable , original and not ugly . 
  the state flags on the other hand ... 
  most are terrible ( state shield under a plain background should n't count as a flag . 
  at least make the background not plain xd ) some are nice though , but really , the states should try and get new flags . 
  and [ of ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/flag_of_provo%2c_utah_%281985-2015%29.svg/2000px-flag_of_provo%2c_utah_%281985-2015%29.svg.png ) course we should not [ forget ] ( https://badflags.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/brown-county-nebraska1.gif ) about [ city ] ( https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--dvgc9uyd--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/1413035434213021474.png ) [ and ] ( https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--8t8av8u9--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/1413035434111132450.jpg ) county flags . 
  not like americans ca n't design good flags for that ( i think chicago has a great flag iirc ) . 
  so why not make good city flags ? 
  for cities and counties the shield under a background * is * acceptable ( although it 's better if the background is n't plain ), 
  oh , those too !, 
  but they are only eaten as breakfast really , or as a snack at like 17:30 or so , not as a full lunch or dinner . 
  i do n't get the question ? 
  i guess in each of the 28 member states as they are still considered sovereign countries . 
  black americans : brought as slaves , still treated badly after liberated . 
  native americans : like in those cowboys vs indians movies . 
  other than that , not much . 
  i do n't think street food ( as in food stands in the street ) is all that popular except for maybe kebabs , hamburgers , french fries and the like . 
  those are common items in food stands . 
  as for food you eat on the go , [ bocadillos ] ( http://www.origenttw.com/images/menus/bocata_tortilla.jpg ) , also called bocatas , are probably the most typical spanish choice . 
  that one is a tortilla one , but you can fill them up with basically anything . 
   merkel will not immediately consent to any substantive changes and i doubt she ever will to be honest . 
  what if schulz somehow won ? 
  normally ketchup but mustard is also popular . 
  or `` ali-oli '' . 
  socially ? 
  sure . 
  i 'm pretty sure rivera is socially leftist . 
  obviously not economically though . 
  21 % , with reduced rates of 10 % and 4 % for more necessary stuff . 
  there are regions with different vats though . 
  so in the canary islands the vat is 7 % , and in ceuta and melilla it 's 10 % . 
   we 're supposed to be frogs . 
  so like [ this ] ( https://i.redd.it/lb4nwnw6a73y.png ) ? 
  can confirm , there are no right wing populists here ( at least no relevant ones ) , but tons of left wing ones . 
  liberal : socially liberal/left ( pro gay marriage , anti racists , etc ) and economically centrist/right ( pro lower taxes and anti regulation in general ) some examples are the british lib dems , spain 's ciudadanos or france 's new president emmanuel macron . 
  conservative : socially right wing ( anti gay marriage , anti abortion , etc ) and right wing economically as well ( pro austerity , pro low taxes , anti regulation ) . 
  they seem to be slightly more `` pro austerity '' than `` anti regulation '' though . 
  they are definitely more `` statist '' than liberals . 
  great examples include basically almost every mainstream right wing party in europe , so from merkel 's cdu to the british tories . 
  as for why it means different things in the us , it 's because the us are slightly to the right . 
  most democrats consider themselves left wing , but they do n't go far enough economically to declare themselves socialists or social democrats or something like that ( other than sanders . 
  is there any other famous `` democratic socialist '' democrat ? ), 
  hence why they call themselves liberals . 
  if dropped in europe , i 'd say many would pick the liberal party over the socialist party ( let alone the far left ones like podemos , linke , syriza , etc ) . 
  it can be confusing but still . 
  the [ catholic kings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catholic_monarchs ) , isabel from castille and fernando from aragon . 
  they basically unified what is today spain . 
  not really . 
  in such high latitudes in winter you have what , 3 hours of light ? 
  and even in summer it 's not depressing at all ; the sun sets down at like 20:30 or so . 
  that 's reasonably late . 
  while i can see why more light would be nice , i do n't really mind that . 
  plus i guess it 's annoying if you do n't have black courtains in your windows . 
  not really ; it takes 11h 30 min to cross spain ( southernmost tip of the border with portugal to the border with france in the east ), 
  to be fair it depends on what you compare . 
  the us are a larger in size than even all of europe , and in population even germany is only 1/3 as populous . 
  i guess ukraine/belarus/russia are the closest thing . 
  relatively low population density ( not nebraska levels but still ) and you have to drive through them to get to moscow . 
  most inland areas in the spanish meseta might also qualify . 
  inland spain has a very low population density ( again , not quite nebraska levels but still low ) , with the notable exception of madrid ( imagine if new york was somehow in the middle of kansas with everything else unchanged ) here 's in google maps : https://www.google.es/maps/@42.1283628,-4.1315145,3a,75y,326.1h,91.85t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1su5v8zqs8tytqw02hixdlgq!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo0.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3du5v8zqs8tytqw02hixdlgq%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d149.22441%26pitch%3d0%26thumbfov%3d100!7i13312!8i6656, 
  it 's very bad and we never win , buut i guess i can live with it, 
  that 's about it though ( althoguh even without nukes their military is very large ), 
  to be fair , i think that 's similar here . 
  most highways and trains lead to madrid here as well ( and madrid is actually quite a bit out of the way from everything else ! ) . 
  map of highways : http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6vvauequgxe/vpd7s_gtusi/aaaaaaaaees/7uw7mxtll34/s1600/red-de-carreteras-de-espa%c3%b1a1.jpg red = highway built by the national government blue = toll highway built by the national government yellow = toll less highway built by the regional government light blue = toll highway built by the regional government the railways map is even worse : http://cdn.20m.es/img/2014/11/19/1930635.jpg, 
  i assume as america you mean the usa . 
  in that case we do n't view it in any way because it simply did n't exist in large enough numbers . 
  we did have a lot of spaniards going to latin america ( to the point where `` gallego '' is a legit term to speak about spaniards , and that refers to only a small region of spain ! ) . 
  and yeah , we view them in all 3 categories you said . 
  people looking for a new start , enterpeneurs looking for an opportunity and persecuted people ( not minorities though , but lots of people during the civil war . 
  in fact a friend of mine had one of his grandparents emigrate to cuba during the war for example ) . 
  for all what 's worth the oldest city in the us ( st. agustine , florida ) was founded by spaniards , and a couple others as well ( like say , san antonio , texas ), 
  i thought poland was a popular erasmus destination already ? 
  yeah , we have tons of those , but they are mostly nationalists only for their region , not all of spain ( i guess the kurds are a close enough analogy for turkey ? ), 
  they are located mostly in catalonia and the basque country , though 9/17 spanish regions ( other than those 2 , canary islands , navarra , cantabria , aragon , valencian community , balearic islands and galicia ) have some sort of regionalist movement ( though their strength varies a lot ),
