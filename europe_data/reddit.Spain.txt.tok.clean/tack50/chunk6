  they are just social democrats further to the left than your classic social democrats ( psoe ) , but still not anywhere close to true socialism . 
  sure , they are n't the pcpe after all xd i just called them far left since it 's the furthest left party with representation , and many european countries have similar parties . 
   eh bildu is not the `` political branch of eta '' in any shape or form . 
  the party is a coalition of left-leaning pro-independence basque parties , mostly made of abertzale left parties ( the basque `` patriotic left '' ) . 
  they do n't have any relationship with eta other than having support from the abertzale left ( the so-called basque patriotic left ) . 
  guess i was wrong there ( i was n't very sure about that one ) . 
  i made the connexion mostly on it having serious troubles being legalized iirc ( i was like 13 at the time , ca n't remember exactly what happened ) and otegui ( which went to jail for belonging to eta , or at least sympathising with them ) being the intended candidate to basque country governor . 
  to be fair , one of the alternatives was holding them on the 1st of january : /, 
  except there is such a mechanism . 
  a party needs at least 3 % of the vote in a constituency to enter parliament . 
  however since most constituencies do n't have enough seats for that rule to be triggered that only applies in madrid and barcelona . 
  you also get results like the canarian coalition geting one seat with 0.3 % of the vote ( they are fucking experts at that . 
  in the regional canary islands election they won coming up third in the popular vote ! ), 
  and pacma getting none with 1.3 % . 
  mostly because we are not used to this ( while we use proportional representation , in practice we had a parliament not too different from the uk 's , with 2 big parties and a couple regional small ones ) . 
  `` hung '' parliaments were n't rare , but it was easier to get into agreements then than now , due to regional parties being now pro independence . 
  for example , in 1996 aznar became prime minister with a pp+c iu ( catalan nationalists ) + pnv ( basque nationalists ) + cc ( canarian nationalists ) deal . 
  such a deal would be unthinkable today ( only cc supported the pp today , and they only have 1 seat and are in serious risk of disappearing at the national level . 
  meanwhile in 1996 they were much more healthy and had 4 seats iirc ) also , catalonian parties being pro independence now makes getting a deal even harder , and to top it all off , the prior pp government was hated by everyone except the pp, 
  i think there were 3 reasons : * 1 : to put pressure on the other parties * 2 : iirc it was the only date that would make us avoid an eu fine * 3 : the alternatives were the 1st of january ( new year 's day , even worse than christmas xd ) or the 8th of january ( 2 days after the 6th , the traditional day when kids get their gifts ), 
  that seems the most likely scenario . 
  btw , it would n't be `` around '' christmas , it 'd literally be on christmas xd ( 25th of december ), 
  tl ; dr : not likely at all . 
  with some negotiations and will it * could * be done , but not in 48 hours . 
  anyways , here 's a rundown of the parties that voted both in favour and against ( no abstentions this time around ) : ** in favour ** pp ( people 's party ) ( 137 seats ) classic right wing party and rajoy 's party . 
  comparable to the german cdu or the french republicans ciudadanos ( 32 seats ) : a classic liberal party , like the alde group , the german fdp or the lib dems in the uk . 
  went from an abstention to a yes after a long period of negotiations . 
  canarian coalition ( 1 seat ) : centre-right canary islands nationalists . 
  not independentists . 
  ** against ** psoe ( spanish socialist workers ' party ) ( 84 seats ; el mundo is counting nc 's seat as theirs ) : classic centre left party . 
  comparable to the german spd or the british labour ( pre corbyn probably though ) . 
  podemos and allies ( 64 seats ) : anti establishment far leftist group . 
  comparable to syriza in greece . 
  erc ( republican left of catalonia ) ( 9 seats ) : leftist catalan independentists . 
  pdc ( democratic catalan party , formerly democratic convergence of catalonia ) ( 8 seats ) : right wing catalan independentists pnv ( basque nationalist party ) ( 5 seats ) : right wing basque nationalists . 
  mostly against independence . 
  compromis ( 4 seats ) : left wing valencian nationalists . 
  contested the election in coalition with podemos eh bildu ( 2 seats ) : left wing basque independentists . 
  to an extent , the political branch of eta ( i 'm not sure on this one ; maybe some basques would help ? ) . 
  nc ( new canaries ) ( 1 seat ) : left wing canary islands nationalists . 
  not independentists . 
  contested the election alongside the psoe seeing this , there are various scenarios , none of them particularly likely : * rajoy convincing the psoe to abstain themselves , giving allowing them to easily get a simple majority . 
  * as a backup to the above , the pp convincing the pnv to vote in favour ( hard , ciudadanos does n't like them and even then they 'd have to wait until the basque country 's regional elections on the 25th of september ; but it can be done with enough willpower ; aznar did it in 1996 ) and nc to abstain themselves ( hard as well , their ideas are safely leftist and they 'd be supporting a right wing government ; such a deal would not be understood at the regional level . 
  however the canarian coalition supported that , maybe with a bit more nc will abstain ) * getting the pdc to somehow support the deal ( insanely hard , ciudadanos hates them to death and they probably wo n't settle with anything less than a referendum in catalonia , which is n't an option . 
  * maybe , maaaaaaybe * they 'll settle with greately increased taxing powers , but that is n't likely ) * the psoe deciding to make a move and create an alternative psoe+p odemos + compromis + erc+pdc government . 
  however that definitely requires a referendum in catalonia ( erc is even more pro independence ) , and the psoe does n't like that . 
  they are more open to it , but not much more so than the pp . 
  i ca n't see any more alternative scenarios though , other than voting on the 25th of december edit : wow , never thought i 'd see this , but i 've been given gold :d not too bad for a comment i made with my phone xd . 
  thanks random redditor , 
  to be fair , i wonder what would be those consecuences . 
  putting tariffs on eu products or what ? 
  ( actually , that would n't be that surprising if trump wins ), 
  same in spain . 
  even at the peak of the 00s bubble , unemployment was at 8.5 % . 
  that would be mediocre for other countries , but for spain that was amazing data . 
  yay , below the 20 % threshold !, 
  to be fair , can you live , get a job and the like in the us without knowing english ? 
  actually , american style pizza ( ie the one with the thick crust iirc ) is just as good in my opinion , as long as it 's not from say , domino 's or pizza hut ( though domino 's and pizza hut       telepizza , the leader here ), 
  to be fair , it 's not that uncommon to do that kind of stuff , especially for lazy people that ca n't cook ( like myself unfortunately ) you just cook the pasta , add in packaged tomato sauce ( not ketchup though ) , tuna and that 's it . 
  though absolutely no one eats it that way , you add the sauce to mix it with the pasta and then serve , not dip the pasta in the sauce as if it were french fries xd, 
  - this is blasphemy !, 
  this is madness !, 
  this is lithuania !!, 
  probably germany , with the uk or ireland being nice options as well . 
  seeing headlines like this i kind of feel happy that our nhs is handled by the regional government instead of by madrid . 
  come to think about it , the article mentions england , not the uk . 
  is the scottish nhs handled separately at edimburgh ? 
  to be fair , when was the last time spain and portugal went to war ? 
  i ca n't remember any recient one ( bad history teachers ? ), 
  can confirm . 
  there are actually many cuban doctors over here . 
  yeah . 
  the only critizism to the uk on the falklands i can see is the cost/benefit one . 
  the uk had a lot to lose ( namely money ) and not much to win ( defend some islands with 1k people ) . 
  still , the uk fought an uphill battle and won , they should be congratulated . 
  gib moniez plox, 
  hell , even if the eu became an actual country tomorrow , i doubt it would comoete as one country . 
  most likely a deal loke the one wales and scotland have for football would happen . 
  even if they did ( they do n't ) they should n't integrate ; they should be assimilated , they should forget islam and asopt the customs of the place they go to . 
  when in rome do as romans do ; or so they say . 
  i thought clinton was pretty much the us merkel ? 
  to be fair , the psoe platform is indeed centre-left ( podemos is plain left , pp is right and ciudadanos is liberal , more than pp in some aspects actually ! ), 
  it 's just that they 'll definitely not keep their platform , and they 'll behave like a right wing government anyways . 
  plus , zapatero 's second term hurt the party way too much , to the point where i 'm not sure if they 'll ever recover . 
  this actually reminds me of the 2013 ? 
  psoe primaries , where the corbyn-ish candidate got 20 % of the vote or so . 
  however , there 's also podemos , which i guess is basically a party full of people like that, 
  well , if labour went further to the right , would n't that make the lib dems redundant ? 
  to be fair , the us and russia have enough nukes to destroy the earth several times over . 
  it definitely would n't hurt if the us or russia unilaterally cut their nukes by like 90 % or so . 
  hell , they 'd even get free fuel for nuclear power plants , so they 'd be helping the environment as well !, 
  well , considering vienna to santander is a 21 h drive ( 2200 km ) ; it 's definitely not `` just a drive '' . 
  [ relevant polandball ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/poland_can_into_the_european_space_agency.png ), 
  or it :p, 
  well , in spanish we use nini instead , but i 'm not sure that 'd work in english ( neither-nor does n't sound that well ), 
  short for ni estudia ni trabaja : ( he ) neither works nor studies, 
  well , if all 4 of greece , italy , spain and portugal need a massive bailout then the eu is probably busted . 
  most likely ( temporal ) return to peseta/lira/dracma / escudo and subsequent chaos ensues . 
  if it 's only some of them ( 2 can definitely be manegable ; * maybe * even 3 ) then things could go better . 
  then again i 'm definitely no economist .
