  not to mention ireland and northern ireland , which would suddenly be driving on different sides ( unless ireland switches as well ), 
  actually , how large is a pint ? 
  at least here servings vary , but the pint equivalent is 500 ml i think, 
  i guess a more likely scenario is france keeps an arsenal for itself , gives another to the eu at large ( maybe with a french veto power , idk ), 
  probably not unless flanders and wallonia agree to split . 
  and definitely not in the netherlands . 
  you ca n't have an eu with 200 `` states '', 
  not in my lifetime , but i would n't rule it out by say , 2100 . 
  interestingly , a tenerife gran canaria flight would more expensive at 33 $ !, 
  ( for non residents ), 
  from the canary islands ? 
  to one of the other islands and that 's about it i think . 
  gran canaria-tenerife costs 20 $ each way . 
  if you get very lucky you * might * find a ryanair flight to madrid/barcelona for that price as well but that would be extremely difficult . 
  and that 's counting the 50 % residence discount . 
  without it , you might not even be able to leave the island ( though you could go anywhere in it ), 
  most likely one of these will happen : a : may agrees to a referendum before 2019/general election after this year ( extremely unlikely , especially the first ) . 
  everyone in scotland is happy , idk what the rest of the uk would do . 
  b : may refuses to hold a referendum before 2019/next general election but does agree to hold one after that . 
  nothing happens ( for now ) c : may refuses to hold any referendum whatsoever . 
  there 's a catalonia style standoff lasting until probably the next hung parliament/labour government in fact , i 'd actually give northern ireland slightly better odds of holding a referendum before the end of the decade !, 
  ( mostly because ni would just reunify while scotland would require separate negotiations with the eu . 
  also scotland had a vote 3 years ago while ni did n't ) . 
  after that i do give scotland the better odds of having a vote though . 
  spain has 17 autonomous communities + ceuta and melilla . 
  i 've been to all except the balearic islands , extremadura and murcia . 
  ( and ceuta/melilla ) . 
  that 's 14/17 ( or out of 19 ), 
  probably each time there 's a new corruption scandal and no one cares anymore . 
  i live in the canary islands which i guess some would consider africa ? 
  ( at least geographically ) other than that i have n't ever left europe . 
  though one day i would like to , at least for tourism !, 
  probably psoe 's implosion in late 2016 and their subsequent leadership contest . 
  also the june 2016 repeated general election ( happened 3 days after brexit so i guess it counts ) . 
  tbh up until 2 years ago there were barely any alternatives in many places ( both castilles , la rioja , etc ) iu and upyd would never get mps there ( 2 and 1 respectively in 08 ) , and there are no nationalists there either . 
  who should they have voted for if they wanted their vote to count ? 
  yeah i agree . 
  spain 's political system seems to want just 2 parties with several minor ones ( kind of like the uk ) and it actually worked like that until 3 years ago or so . 
  however that has since broken and now it 's a mess . 
  we finally got a prime minister last year , but we still do n't have an opposition , and the candidates all look terrible for the job . 
  psoe ( centre-left ) supports the government , podemos ( far left ) does not know how to do institutional politics ( currently pushing for a no confidence vote which will get less than 90 mps in favour , needing 176 for it to pass ) and the regional parties ca n't fill that role either ( it does n't help that for the 2 largest ones their entire platform is `` independence !!!! 111 !! '' ), 
  the wikipedia site explains it better than i can though : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leader_of_the_opposition_ ( spain ), 
  normally we do , but now it 's a bit unclear who is the opposition leader . 
  both psoe and podemos claim to be the opposition . 
  podemos thinks that since psoe allowed rajoy to become pm by abstaining that makes them part of the government coalition , making podemos leader pablo iglesias the leader of the opposition . 
  psoe claims it is the largest party without ministers and influence in the government , meaning the opposition belongs to them , but since they do n't have a leader ( and even if they did , he likely wo n't be an mp ) , that leaves the speaker of their group ( antonio hernando ) as * de facto * opposition leader . 
  this is only since last year though , we normally have had a real opposition leader . 
  2011-2015 it was first alfredo p\u00e9rez rubalcava , then pedro s\u00e1nchez , who was the last uncontested opposition leader ( both psoe ) . 
  2004-2011 it was mariano rajoy ( pp ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leader_of_the_opposition_ ( spain ), 
  yeah , i might be doing that . 
  i do n't know . 
  basically what we have now . 
  if i had to change something for the sake of change , i guess i 'd change 2 things : * 1 : call them `` civil union '' or something like that as opposed to marriage . 
  make them equal in everything though ( ie gay couples can adopt , get tax discounts and do whatever a regular married couple can . 
  just without the name `` marriage '' attached to it ) * 2 : allow churches to forbid gay couples from marrying in church . 
  pretty sure this is a thing already though . 
  1 is because imo the word marriage means man and woman ( family ) . 
  but it 's just a semantic thing , that 's literally the least of my priorities and i 'm perfectly fine with calling it marriage . 
  when i voted they did have the papers inside . 
  i split my vote for the senate ( which requires you to take a paper which is why people do n't do it often . 
  but yeah , i agree , that is an attack on privacy . 
  depends on what you are voting for . 
  for anything other than the useless senate , you go into the booth and you 'll find several ballots and envelopes like [ these ] ( http://blogs.antena3.com/clipping/2011/11/21/00041/31.jpg ) . 
  you take the ballot from your favourite party , put it in the envelope and vote . 
  for the senate it 's a bit different . 
  you get a ballot like [ this ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0v8vzbffxxo/vmhoxzeqwui/aaaaaaaabxs/9atowfmvmpg/s1600/senado.jpg ) and you put an x next to the candidates you like the most . 
  the amount of people you can vote for varies depending on where you live . 
  it 's 3 in mainland spain , 2 in the big islands ( gran canaria , tenerife and mallorca ) and 1 everywhere else i think . 
  interesting thing to note is that the large parties usually send pre-filled ballots to everyone ( so if you are voting for a large party you do n't even need to get into the booth ! ), 
  well , we were under one in the 60s and 70s i guess . 
  economically it was n't * too * bad ( the 60s at least , the 70s were n't all that great ) . 
  but i 'll definitely take the freedom and democracy though . 
  lots of them tbh . 
  mostly the basque country or catalonia though . 
  i thought italy was not able to do referendums to leave the eu because of its constitution ? 
  tbh , that 's what we normally use for 2 people lol . 
  so more like 7.5 $ each . 
  well , they do exist , but there are very few of them . 
  your best bet is getting a tourism related job in the high season ( normally summer , but can be winter instead ) . 
  plus , unitl you are 18 you need permission from your parents . 
  also , the youth unemployment rate is 59 % for people unter 24 ( not sure if that includes students but probably not ) . 
  finding a job is simply very hard . 
  right wing : does [ adolfo su\u00e1rez ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adolfo_su%c3%a1rez ) count ? 
  ( he considered himself a centrist , but was probably centre-right ) . 
  if not i guess i 'll have to go all the way back to the 19th century and nominate [ antonio c\u00e1novas del castillo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antonio_c%c3%a1novas_del_castillo ) he basically designed the `` restauration '' regime in the 1870s , to this day still the longest period of `` peace '' ( ie no regime changes ) in spain ( albeit only barely , the current period will overtake it in like 5-6 years ) left wing : i guess [ manuel aza\u00f1a ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manuel_aza%c3%b1a ) ? 
  he was prime minister between 1931 and 1933 , and tried to do several reforms in the country , although he failed . 
  it 's not like we have a better choice . 
  both [ felipe gonz\u00e1lez ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/felipe_gonz%c3%a1lez ) and [ jose luis rodriguez zapatero ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jos%c3%a9_luis_rodr%c3%adguez_zapatero ) would be terrible picks . 
  i guess aza\u00f1a is controversial so the best non controversial option would probably be something like [ pr\u00e1xedes mateo sagasta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pr%c3%a1xedes_mateo_sagasta ) did basically the same as c\u00e1novas for the right , ensuring stability of the regime in the late 19th century . 
  plus he passed universal male suffrage so that has to count for something right ? 
  ( elections were rigged thoguh ), 
  what about buying in a supermarket ? 
  or are those supermarket prices ? 
  ( because if so , that 's ridiculous ! ), 
  what about buying in a supermarket ? 
  or are those supermarket prices ? 
  ( because if so , that 's ridiculous ! ), 
  ok , here 's a list of items : * plastic cups : 1 $ * bag of ice : 1.5 $ * bottle of rum ( 1l ) : 10 $ * bottles of coca-cola ( 2l ) * 2:1 $ in total more or less 15 $ for the alcohol . 
  if you are going to a club later you can add between 5 or 10 $ ( though sometimes it 's free and sometimes it can be up to 15 $ ) depending on the club , the time of night , whether you are a woman or a man , whether the security guard likes you or not , the phase of the moon , etc, 
  damn , that 's a lot of drinking xd i guess only 1 ( or 2 ) alcohol items would be enough for me .
