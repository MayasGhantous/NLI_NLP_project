  depending on the time scale involved , i 'm not even sure if we 'll get to keep catalonia and the basque country . 
  ( probably yes , but still ) i guess we 'll probably become some sort of `` united states of spain '' in the future . 
  the economy will be fine , but it could be a lot better . 
  relatively high unemployment and low paying jobs . 
  also , lots of corruption , to the point where it barely even registers anymore . 
  in society stuff though , i ca n't see the problem . 
  other than legalizing marijuana , what are the big societal issues ? 
   merged into another state so you want to become part of france ? 
   restoration of the monarchy but why ? 
  i thought monarchies were ok if they were old and had ruled for a long time already , but wanting to restore the monarchy in the 21st century is weird . 
  ( we are an exception i know , but it 's not like we had a choice ), 
  i guess whichever you identify with ? 
  not to mention that i think the divide is urban-rural , not by states . 
  ireland has a border with the uk though . 
  i think hawaii also does not do that so you are not alone ? 
  :p but yeah , in europe it 's actually mandated by the eu . 
  reciently the balearic islands governor sent a request to the government for the region to stop using it , but it was dismissed as that is an eu issue . 
  yeah , whenever i leave the country i feel like i 'm eating way too early . 
  well , we often do that here in spain . 
  i mean a hypothetical basque country without navarra ( ie alava/vizcaya/guipuzcoa only ), 
  fun fact : we have a chad flag as well as a romania one xd ( they are the same ), 
   the irak war . 
  here , the main part of the story was how president aznar went against the wishes of the people by supporting the us with boots on the ground . 
  the part touching the us explained the justification and causes of the war ( supposed evidence of weapons of mass destruction that were never found ) . 
  wow , you got all the way to aznar ?!, 
  here we stopped at su\u00e1rez and the transition , and in fact even if we had kept going the last unit that we had to study for pau was gonz\u00e1lez and entering nato and the eu, 
  yeah , though the inflation + general unrest ( strike of 1917 ) , did help in bringing primo de rivera into power . 
  though the regime was already well in it 's way down by ww1 , that was just what left it almost dead . 
  yeah , i meant in case there was n't one . 
  for all what 's worth i think andorra declared war on germany during ww1 and they did n't sign a peace deal until 1939 !, 
  spain ? 
  ( be it for independence or for navarra ), 
  i think many are just catalan posters who want independence since there 's no catalan flair . 
  ( i have no idea what scotland would use in that case though . 
  maybe the eu flair ? ), 
  if you have cable you can access bbc world news , fox news and cnn over here . 
  obviously they are n't spanish channels in english , but it 's the closest thing we have, 
  andaluc\u00eda and the canary islands definitely do not speak `` standard '' castillian spanish . 
  anyways , the standard i think is valladolid/castille-leon spanish , or at leas that 's what i 've heard . 
  oriente medio ( middle east ) . 
  however , oriente pr\u00f3ximo ( near east ) is also interchangably used , but is rare . 
  spain apparently has * just * recovered , with the country reaching the exact same gdp as in 2008 this month . 
  then there 's greece . 
  portugal also has not recovered fully i think ( though their unemployment is a lot better than ours ), 
  do n't care . 
  almost no one has guns over here ( other than a few people in rural areas for hunting , and even then it probably does not bother them either ) . 
  why bother ? 
  to be fair , is n't that * de facto * independence ? 
  i think the ibarrexe plan ( for example ) was basically giving the basque country all powers except defense and foreign relations . 
  probably linked to conspiaracy theories , much like the illuminati and the like . 
  other than that , no one cares for all what 's worth though franco hated freemasons with a passion , often talking about an `` masonic-marxist international conspiracy '' . 
  here 's him talking about that in his last speech for example ( in the 0:50 min mark ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7eb3-6dyvu he literally says `` everything happening to spain and in europe right now is the product of a masonic leftist conspiracy of the political class '', 
   there is a common discussion/debate on whether or not spain is actually a `` nation of nations '' , as basque and catalan people ( sometimes galician , andalusian and canarian as well ) do believe that they form their own cultural nation within spain . 
  there are many clashes between those regions and others that believe in a more uniform spain ( usually castile ) . 
  i 've often seen spain divided into 3 kinds of regions : * centralist regions ( would prefer a centralized government ) : castille-la mancha , castille leon , la rioja , madrid , extremadura . 
  * autonomist/status quo regions ( would prefer a federalized/devolved spain , but nothing too different from what we have now ) : galicia , asturias , cantabria , aragon , navarra , valencian community , balearic islands , andalucia , murcia , canary islands * independentist spain ( they want to leave ) : catalonia , basque country i personally think the current model works fine , but that it should be slightly reformed ( making spain an outright federation , maybe declaring spain a nation of nations but without any legal meaning , etc ), 
  we only have one kind of high school , like the us . 
  however we do have several paths inside each high school , kind of like germany . 
  there are 3 main paths : * sciences . 
  you 'll have all the mandatory subjects common to all paths ( history , spanish , etc ) plus science subjects like biology , technology , math , chemistry , physics , etc. 
  usually but unofficially subdivided into 2 routes : `` healthcare sciences '' ( with biology and chemsitry as mandatory , intended for future doctors , nurses , etc ) and `` science and technolgy '' ( with maths and physics as mandatory , intended for future engineers , architects , etc ) * `` letters '' : mandatory subjects plus social sciences and humanities subjects like economics , statistics , geography , latin , greek , etc. 
  again unofficially subdivided into `` social sciences '' ( usually with mandatory economics and statistics , intended for future business degrees ) and `` humanities '' ( usually with mandatory latin and greek i think , intended for future historians , translators , archeologists , etc ) * arts : mandatory subjects + stuff like artistic drawing , music subjects , etc. 
  this time the subdivision is official , and it 's divided into `` plastic arts '' ( artistic drawing and the like ) and `` scenic arts and music '' ( several music related subjects ) keep in mind not all schools offer all routes or all subject combinations . 
  mine for example limits you to both sciences subdivisions and the `` social sciences '' combination of the `` letters '' path . 
  in fact schools with the arts route are very rare . 
  i think there are only 3 in my 850k inhabitants island ( one for scenic arts and 2 for plastic arts i think ) . 
  then there 's stuff like fp ( proffesional training , kinda like american trade schools ) but that 's outside the normal high school itinerary ( eso/bachillerato ) even if it 's often taught at high schools . 
  well , here in spain we use the same term for regional leaders ( for the most part ) as for the main prime minister . 
  so the prime minister is the presidente del gobierno ( president of the government ) while our `` ministerpr\u00e4sidenten '' are normally called `` presidente de x '' ( president of x ) . 
  for example you have the president of cantabria , president of the canary islands , etc. 
  keep in mind they still are elected like a prime minister so the president title is just because it sounds better . 
  there are exceptions though . 
  in places where the government is not called `` gobierno de x '' ( government of x ) but instead has another title ( normally either `` junta '' or `` generalitat '' ) the title is closer to the national one ( presidente de la junta/generalitat de x : `` president of x 's junta/generalitat '' ) . 
  finally , the basque country uses a title of their own : lehendakari . 
  sometimes a spanish translation is used , close to the first model ( president of the basque autonomous community ) , but it 's pretty rare to see that . 
  yeah , but using president instead of prime minister is not a huge difference . 
  similarly , many times spanish redditors call our prime minister `` president '' . 
  that 's because his official title is `` president of the government '' ( presidente del gobierno ) usually shortened to just `` president '' ( el presidente :p ) . 
  hence the confusion . 
  i mean in 2022, 
  could n't the republicans just win the election against le pen if macron does badly ? 
  for all what 's worth online polls are basically worthless . 
  even in one of the largest spanish forum boards ( forocoches ) the results are not representative at all , with podemos and vox ( a tiny far right party who got 0.2 % of the vote last election ) tied at 26 % , cs at 15 % , pp at 10 % , and psoe at 2 % , tied with fucking falange !, 
  ( franco 's party ), 
  yeah , i agree , these subs lean centre-left , even for european standards . 
  ( though it varies depending on the issue ) . 
  though i 'd say the largest bias is a huge pro-eu bias . 
  we do n't have something like american majors , but the most popular degrees are , in order ( data from the 2013-2014 year ) : business administration , industrial engineering , computer science , economics , law , telecomunications engineering and labour relations http://www.huffingtonpost.es/2013/06/11/ade-carrera-favorita-ofertas-estudiantes_n_3421602.html  it 's gotten to the point where some stem majors poke fun at arts majors . 
  is n't that the same everywhere ? 
  :p at least here it 's common as well . 
  i actually manually ran a similar election ( albeit only 1 round , more like the uk ) with the results of 2011 , 2015 and 2016 in my region ( canary islands ) . 
  the results were : 2011 : pp sweeps all 15 seats 2015 ** santa cruz de tf ** pp :6 psoe : 1 ( they get a seat in southwest tenerife ) ** las palmas ** pp :4 podemos :4 ( lanzarote + all 3 in las palmas de gran canaria ) 2016 : pp sweeps all 15 seats a lot worse than the actual results tbh . 
  then again there were limitations ( had to make las palmas and santa cruz-la laguna large seats with 3 mps each all elected from the same party for example ) the map i used was this . 
  the green seats have 3 mps , all others have only 1 : http://i.imgur.com/g6cllyp.png, 
   switzerland 's direct democracy works because it 's a small country california has a very similar system and it has like 35 million people , comparable to poland, 
  in theory they could pull out without a referendum , but on practice they 'd probably put a non binding one like the one we had for leaving nato in 1986 ( remain won 57-43 ), 
   portugal actually produces an excess of energy makes me think that we should buy our energy from portugal . 
  maybe like that we would have cheaper electricity !, 
   do you think your government is doing enough to tackle it , and how are they proceeding ? 
  i do n't remember any particular policies from the government ( other than pushing hard for drilling for oil in the canary islands with most islanders opposed ) so i guess not  is climate change denial prominent at all in your area ?
