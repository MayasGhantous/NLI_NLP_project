  i think we do n't really need to answer . 
  see : every pro-independence politician ever, 
  for all what 's worth i think the `` soft alcohol '' from 16 on was only in asturias for beer and cider ? 
  i also think the `` no public drinking '' law varies on a town by town basis , and it 's not all that seriously enforced anyways . 
  anyways , i do n't think so . 
  we are still a long way ahead ( or behind depending on your point of view ) of the us, 
  fighting civil wars, 
  for some reason i thought that was moldavia xd, 
   basque country spreads over two countries . 
  also there are some in catalonia who feel like that some areas of southern france ( the area around perpignan and the roussillon ), 
   can it be greater than the sum of its parts , militarily ? 
  i 'm not sure the pro of reduced redundancies outweighs the con of integration friction . 
  i 'd actually say it 'd be less than the sum of its parts , if anything because there are more than 20 different languages they could speak . 
   frankly , how willing are soldiers to die for a supranational political union ? 
  less than for the country , but still probably enough for a small army . 
  alternatively it could be made to pay slightly better than the national army , though i 'm not sure if that 'd be a good thing . 
   relationship with nato . 
  austria , sweden , finland , ireland , cyprus , and malta are in the eu but not nato . 
  i think all of those consider themselves `` neutral '' powers , and as eu treaties stand now , they 'd probably get some sort of opt-out . 
  there is an eu norm somewhere that if one country is attacked all others are required to respond a la nato . 
   without the uk , the eu has one `` major '' military power , france . 
  given france 's favorability ratings of the eu ( lower than anyone but greece ) , this seems like a problem . 
  totally agree . 
  an eu army could be built even if france did leave though ( then again if france left the eu would be on life support , if not completely dead )  without the uk , the eu has one nuclear power , france . 
  do we expect france to sign over its nuclear capability to the eu , or do they retain sole control over it ? 
  that 's on france 's hand to decide . 
  i guess france would get an arsenal for themselves , and another for the eu ( probably subject to extremely limited rules ; betting on unanimity plus no first use at the very least ) . 
  it 's not like national armies would disappear . 
  maybe he was a kid at the time and did n't notice ? 
  ( iirc slovenia mostly escaped the 90s wars ) or he is very old and is fond of the 60s ? 
  ( no idea how those were in yugoslavia , but probably better than the 80s and 90s ), 
  depends on your definition of ethnic , but i guess several of the smaller and medium ones also qualify . 
  i 'm thinking of austria , ireland , greece , denmark , etc. 
  i would support him quite a bit , and i 'd say he 'd be pretty successful actually . 
  i guess the closest person here in modern timeswould be podemos and pablo iglesias but even they are a far cry from that . 
  by car ? 
  i think yes . 
  might be technically illegal but still should be 99 % safe by bus/train ? 
  probably also yes . 
  i do n't think they check ids . 
  if they do it will be tougher though . 
  by plane ? 
  forget it . 
  low chance he gets in the plane ( though trying wo n't hurt i guess ), 
  to be fair i rarely see people missing the peseta here , other than in a `` now things cost twice as much as in 2001 and my salary is the same ! '', 
  manner . 
  so the welfare state is a ponzi scheme . 
  got it, 
  why is spain considered a dictatorship on that map though ? 
  we were fighting the civil war at the time, 
  several reasons : * too far from many parts of the country . 
  it 's almost in a corner . 
  * secessionist movement in catalonia . 
  it 'd be very weird if the capital city of the country seceded . 
  * while historically an important city in the economic sense , not so much so politically . 
  i think in the last election the socialist party proposed moving the senate to barcelona as a concession , but that 's about it . 
  well , i guess we could use valladolid ( 150km to the northwest ) instead , but toledo is definitely the better choice . 
  historic city , in the centre of the country . 
  it 's admittedly a bit small though ( only 83 000 people , but any city in the centre of spain that is n't madrid or a suburb of madrid will have similar issues . 
  central spain is very sparsely populated ) . 
  here 's a map of population density . 
  other than madrid , all provinces in the centre are sparsely populated : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/densidades_de_poblaci%c3%b3n_en_espa%c3%b1a_%282005%29.png soria has a population density comparable to russia actually !, 
  or is it too small ? 
  nothing else really . 
  i guess if voting rights are suspended they could be expelled from the eu though , via a new treaty or something . 
  probably to toledo , which was the historic capital during the middle ages and also is n't all that far from madrid ( 60km to the south ) . 
  here in the canary islands `` un bottell\u00edn '' normally means whatever bottle the bar has . 
  so it can be either 33cl or 25cl or 20cl . 
  well here you normally either order a `` ca\u00f1a '' ( 0.25 l ) or a `` jarra '' ( 0.5 l ) , assuming it 's served in a glass . 
  if not you just ask for a beer . 
  counting only those from 1975 onwards ( and excluding stuff like `` mp for madrid '' which is mandatory ) : * adolfo su\u00e1rez : former head of the state owned tv channel ( tve ) : 1969-1973 * leopoldo calvo sotelo ( after suarez resigned ) : minister for public works ( 1976-1978 ) ; minister for spain 's relation with the eec ( 1978-1980 ) and minister for the economy ( 1980-1981 ) * felipe gonz\u00e1lez ( 1982-1996 ) : secretary general of the spanish socialist workers ' party ( 1974-1997 ) . 
  did n't really do anything else before other than mp for madrid ( 1977-2000 , though his last term was mp for seville instead ) . 
  * jos\u00e9 mar\u00eda aznar ( 1996-2004 ) : governor of castille-leon ( 1987-1989 ) that 's it again unless you count his time as mp . 
  * jose luis rodriguez zapatero ( 2004-2011 ) : mp for leon ( 1986-2004 ) . 
  minister for : public works ( 1996-1999 ) ; education ( 1999-2000 ) and the interior ( 2001-2002 ) ** other pm candidates that were never elected ** * manuel fraga ( 1982,1986 ) : minister of information and tourism ( 1963-1969 ) and of the interior ( 1975-1976 ) . 
  ambassador in london ( 1969-1975 ) . 
  later went on to be governor of galicia ( 1990-2005 ) * joaqu\u00edn almunia ( 2000 ) : minister of work ( 1982-1986 ) and of public works ( 1986-1991 ) * alfredo p\u00e9rez rubalcaba ( 2011 ) : deputy prime minister ( 2010-2011 ) . 
  government spokesman ( 1993-1996 ; 2010-2011 ) . 
  minister of : the interior ( 2006-2011 ) and education ( 1992-1993 ) * pablo iglesias ( 2015,2016 ) : member of the european parliament ( 2014-2015 ) * albert rivera ( 2015,2016 ) : mp in catalonia 's regional assembly ( 2006-2015 ) * pedro s\u00e1nchez ( 2015,2016 ) : `` only mp for madrid '' ( 2013-2016 ) keep in mind spanish cabinets are very flexible so the same person can end up in radically diferent cabinet positions . 
  anyways , counting failed candidates we 've had : * 1 governor ( jose mar\u00eda aznar ) * 3 `` only mps '' ( felipe gonz\u00e1lez , jose luis rodriguez zapatero , pedro s\u00e1nchez ) . 
  interestingly all from the psoe * 2 deputy prime ministers ( mariano rajoy , alfredo p\u00e9rez rubalcaba ) * 5 cabinet members ( leopoldo calvo sotelo , manuel fraga , joaqu\u00edn almunia , mariano rajoy , alfredo p\u00e9rez rubalcaba ) * 1 `` other government position '' ( adolfo su\u00e1rez ) * 1 state legislator ( albert rivera ) * 1 member of the european parliament ( pablo iglesias ) so , if you want to become pm of spain , your best bet is probably to become a cabinet member and have very good relations with your party . 
  this is probably because up until 2014 ( for psoe ) or still to this day ( for pp ) , the party leader and thus pm candidate was appointed by party leaders ( around 1000 of them ) . 
  psoe currently has closed primaries restricted to party members who pay membership dues ( around 150 000 people ) . 
  podemos has open primaries . 
  ciudadanos runs a system similar to psoe . 
  ( around 10 000 people can vote ) . 
  pp still uses the `` party leaders '' system . 
  interestingly though , only 1 cabinet member has ever been directly elected ( calvo-sotelo succeeded suarez after he resigned ) , and even that cabinet member ( rajoy ) was also deputy prime minister and even then it took him 2 failed attempts ( 2004 and 2008 ) until he finally became pm in 2011 . 
  it is rare for governors to contest an election as being party leader and governor is frowned upon by many people as `` accumulating too many positions '' . 
  aznar did that but that 's it . 
  we might get a 2nd pm candidate that was a governor soon though ( susana d\u00edaz from andaluc\u00eda , psoe ) deputy prime minister is roughly the same as cabinet member , slightly better as you are seen as number 2 . 
  i 've often seen current deputy pm suggested as the successor to rajoy . 
  being an mp is also a good position to run from , but you need to do something to avoid being an obscure candidate . 
  it is the best position for `` dark horse '' candidates though . 
   canarian aborigins canary islander here , never met one such person xd hell , i 'm pretty sure not even pro-independence people ( who are already extremely rare ) know about that . 
  controversial opinion : i think we should copy quite a bit from the us ' political system . 
  obviously not all , but there are tons of american ideas i 'd like to have : * ** referendums for a lot of stuff ** : currently the only european country that does this is switzerland , and it 's often dismissed as `` swizerland is a small , homogeneous , educated country so they can afford to do it . 
  we ca n't '' . 
  well , california has a population roughly the size of poland , and still does tons of referendums . 
  and they are n't the only state that does that .
