  i 'd love to see california style referendums here . 
  since the constitution was ratified , we 've had a whopping 2 referendums : 1986 on leaving nato ( remain won ) and 2005 on the eu constitution ( yes won , but france and the netherlands voted no so it was worthless ) . 
  limit them to regional matters if necessary . 
  * ** a us style senate ** ( minus fptp , change it to irv ) . 
  thus far the spanish senate is worthless . 
  it has almost 0 power . 
  i 'd personally almost copy and paste the us senate in here to replace it . 
  give it equal powers to the congress of deputies ( which shall still use even more proportional representation to avoid a 2 party system ) and give each state 4 senators , plus 2 for each of ceuta and melilla ( for a total of 72 senators ) . 
  3 senators are directly elected , seving periods of 6 years , but staggered ( so each state elects one of their senators every 2 years ) . 
  the 4th is appointed by the state legislatures , and serves until there 's a new regional election . 
  for ceuta/melilla , one is appointed and the other is elected . 
  * ** the concept of state 's rights and federalism ** : again , copy and paste this . 
  this could solve lots of problems we have now in spain . 
  each state gets equal powers , but they get a lot of power which the federal government ca n't take away except in case of dire national emergency . 
  * ** mandatory primaries ** : i know the us with fptp for everything and just 2 parties make these easier , but still . 
  i personally think parties should open their primaries to all spaniards aged 18 or more . 
  at the very least those for national , regional and local party leaders ( ie candidates for pm , governor and mayor ) . 
  this would avoid psoe style coup d'etats ( where secretary general pedro sanchez was ousted by party leaders ) or pp style appointments ( where rajoy was appointed by his predecesor , aznar , who was in turn appointed by his predecessor , fraga ) . 
  make them restricted if needed ( ie must register to vote within one party and can only vote in that party ) . 
  this is not restricted to the us , but the us do it the best . 
  * ** separation of powers : ** right now our politicians are too linked together . 
  i already said what i 'd do to the legislative . 
  for the judicial branch , make judges completely appointed within themselves , with politicians having no control or relation to them . 
  for the executive , make it directly elected like in france ( either 2 rounds or irv are fine with me ) . 
  no electoral college though . 
  * ** recall elections : ** i think these are restricted to only a handful of states but they are still a great idea . 
  extend these to all levels of government . 
  well , if you count the ussr 's milestones as european then it is definitely a tie . 
  if not , well , the esa was the first to put a probe on a comet . 
  that 's something right ? 
   parties like vvd and cda are sceptic towards migration , but relatively pro-eu . 
  i guess something like this is what he was looking for ? 
  not that i know of , but some of them are more pro eu than others , normally seeking renegotiation instead of outright leaving . 
  i guess something like fidesz and viktor orban from hungary is the closest you 'll get ? 
  they belong to the epp in the eu parliament , which means they are pro eu , but orban was one of the largest critics of the eu 's refugee policy, 
  yeah , that one also works . 
  there 's technically no `` day of spain '' anyways . 
  6th of december is constitution day ( day the constitution was ratified iirc ) and 12th of october is `` hispanics day '' . 
  no real `` spain 's day '', 
  country : spain 12 of october . 
  day columbus found america region canary islands 30th of may : 1st session of the canary islands ' regional assembly . 
  pretty lame celebration imo, 
  to be fair , i would also put / u/xnicolex ( when civilization ends ) in the `` still holding out hope '' category :p, 
  for all what 's worth he said he lived 6 years in bulgaria , so he should know bulgarian . 
  i would n't completely discard it , if only because of no language barrier . 
  of course salaries will be incredibly low for someone used to 1000 $ rentals ( iirc minimum wage is like 200 $ ? ), 
  depends a lot on which country . 
  sure , why not ? 
  they are a developed and democratic country with less inhabitants than 4 eu countries and a large economy but not so large that it dominates . 
  but say , libya ? 
  no fucking way . 
  for all what 's worth while i ca n't see the us entering the eu ( too large ) , i could see them entering as 50 individual countries , or eu countries entering the us as states 51-77 . 
  for all what 's worth the basque country has `` country '' in it :p however i think the only explanation is that england and scotland were independent in the far past . 
  catalonia has never been independent . 
  not like that matters though ( catalonia and scotland have roughly comparable levels of devolution ), 
  podemos is the largest party , with cs in 2nd , pp in 3rd and psoe on 4th . 
  catalonia would get a referendum . 
  we 'd be a lot more leftist . 
  still fails . 
  in fact he is not even close to passing ( currently tied with rajoy at a 3/10 ) . 
  http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2017-02-07/cis-lideres-mejor-valorados-bladovi-domenech_1327948/ best considered with his own party ( ie not part of the podemos coalition ) seems to be joan baldov\u00ed ( comprom\u00eds ) , with a 4.2 / 10 . 
  nope . 
  i do n't really trust our government that much . 
  not like the opposition is much better . 
  same goes for our local politicians ( governor/mayor ) . 
  i do trust a bit more the president of our island council , but he is still a politician so still ca n't be trusted that much . 
  nobody trusts politicians tbh . 
  i think in recient years the only politicians that have had positive approval have been albert rivera and alberto garz\u00f3n , and even then only barely ( like 5.2 / 10 ) everyone else has never had a positive approval rating . 
  depending on your definition of nazi/fascist , it was * only * 42 years ago . 
  franco still lived until 1975 . 
  to be fair , that 's a problem with all public tv stations . 
  tve has always been biased towards the government , even if some eras were more blatantly biased than others ( zapatero 's 2nd term is usually considered the least biased . 
  no idea which was the most biased though . 
  i guess the franco era xd ), 
  first of all , there are 2 kinds of laws in spain : regular laws and `` organic laws '' . 
  organic laws are above regular laws and affect certain more important areas of government , like fundamental freedoms and liberties , autonomy statutes ( kind of like our equivalent to the us state constitutions , except they need to be ratified by the national congress , not just the `` state legislature '' ) and some other important stuff like say , education or the military laws can be proposed by the following people : * the government ( technically the `` council of ministers '' ) * the congress of deputies ( either 15 mps or a parliamentary grouping ) * a `` state legislature '' ( very rare ) * spanish citizens themselves , by collecting 500k signatures in 6 months ( very rare , 94 laws have been proposed , but only 2 have been passed through this method . 
  37 were rejected by a commision in congress , another 37 were rejected because they did n't get enough signatures . 
  the only 2 that have been passed were laws declaring bullfighting a `` cultural heritage '' and a law regulating debts in homeowner associations ) anyways then the law is passed by the congress of deputies . 
  it need either more yes than no votes for regular laws , or 50 % +1 of all deputies ( ie 176 ) for organic laws . 
  after that it goes to the senate , which can do 3 things . 
  it can pass it without ammendments , pass ammendments ( have to be ratified by the congress of deputies ) or veto the law ( requires an absolute majority ; not just more `` noes '' than `` yes '' ) if the senate vetoes , the congress of deputies can override that veto by either an absolute majority , or a simple majority after waiting for 2 months . 
  ( that 's why most people think the senate is useless ) the executive does not have a veto for most stuff ( then again on a parliamentary system is not that necessary ) . 
  iirc they have a veto on the budget , but that 's about it . 
  for all what 's worth no one really has it in the canary islands , but that goes without saying . 
  i think if you need heating you normally just buy an electric heater and move it around . 
  i do n't want to reignite the yugoslavian wars again . 
  in my house ? 
  one for plastic and cans , one for glass and another one for other stuff . 
  outside my house there are 4 . 
  those 3 plus a blue one for paper . 
  is the 88 $ in overseas departments because their vat is lower ? 
  for example in mainland spain vat is 21 % , but in the canary islands the vat is only 7 % ( on the other hand , buying stuff from the mainland has extra taxes ), 
  same here , except no tv tax . 
  our state broadcaster is funded through general taxes . 
   a republic ( latin : res publica ) is a form of government in which the country is considered a `` public matter '' -- not the private concern or property of the rulers -- and where offices of state are elected or appointed , rather than inherited . 
  it is a government where the head of state is not a monarch and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic apparently we are both right ? 
  same here except it 's the 12th of october, 
  definitely somewhere in latin america . 
  chile , uruguay , argentina and mexico ( in that order ) seem like good places .
