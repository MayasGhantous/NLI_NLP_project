  i thought cuba 's healthcare was top notch for a 3rd world country , almost on par with the us in some aspects ? 
  i thought morocco was safe ? 
  and to some lesser extent algeria and tunisia as well ? 
  yeah , republic only means that there 's no king . 
  saying that the us is a republic , not a democracy is a stupid argument, 
  yeah , our constitution was passed in 1975 and it is already considered outdated by something like 40 % of people . 
  ca n't imagine how outdated a 1789 constitution is xd ( though i 'll recognize that the us constitution was very forward thinking for 1789 , but definitely has flaws in 2017 ), 
   establish a movement for people to learn more about their local politics . 
  it 's stupid you keep voting for the president that 'll `` change everything '' instead of starting from your local elections and moving up . 
  this would also help strengthen third parties . 
  to be fair , we are guilty of this to an extent as well . 
  most people here vote straight ticket ( ie same for local , autonomic and national elections ) . 
  [ las palmas de gran canaria ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/las_palmas_de_gran_canaria ) was founded more or less when the spanish first came here , in 1470 . 
  that means it is 547 years old . 
  that 's quite new for spain and europe 's standards actually . 
  iirc the first traces of settlement in the island can be traced back 2000 years or so . 
  maybe even a bit more . 
  i thought carmena was going to retire and errejon was going to be the nect candidate ? 
  depends on which level of government : town hall : pp ( right wing ; last mayor did a good job ) island council : nc ( left wing canarian nationalists ) regional parliament : probably nc , though i 'd vote for podemos ( left wing ) if their canary islands branch was not such a disaster national election : psoe ( centre-left ) if sanchez ( more left wing candidate ) wins . 
  podemos if susana diaz ( more conservative candidate ) wins . 
  not sure between the 2 if patxi lopez ( between sanchez and diaz ) wins . 
  might change if nc contests the election alone or in coalition with a party other than psoe . 
  european election : psoe/s & d the right has ruled the eu for what , 20 years now ? 
  erc/bildu/whatever left nationalist party you get might be a better option . 
  alternatively i guess psoe might be the least evil but they are the inventors of twitter sjw doctrine and very corrupt so ... cs is probably too right wing for you i guess . 
  yeah , 99 % of the time it 's a bar or club . 
  i 'd also add that many spaniards live in an appartment as opposed to a detatched house so most people simply do n't have enough room and/or would annoy their neighbours . 
  i will say house parties are more enjoyable imo . 
  depends on location . 
  i 'd be quite surprised to find an american learning spain spanish , but not so much if it was a brit or a frenchman . 
  0/10 spanish is probably one of the most common choices for foreign language, 
  they also have more rights than the rest of the country , especially in the taxation area , where they do n't pay their fair share iirc . 
  ( kind of how the uk had a rebate so they had to pay less to the eu ), 
   but honestly , the eu is nothing if not pragmatic . 
  if a member country switched to such a system they might get a few stern words from the eu , but it would be unlikely that it 'd lead to any actual repercussions . 
  actually , the eu would force them to use a proportional system for the european parliament ( the uk had to switch for example ) , but inside their borders they could do whatever they wanted . 
  it 's a bad system , but probably democratic enough for spain at the local level . 
  we 've had lots of elections where the winner of the popular vote did not get the largest amount of seats . 
  some examples include : * [ 1999 catalonia regional election ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_parliamentary_election,_1999 ) the socialist party ( psc ) wins by 0.2 but the nationalist ciu gets 4 seats more than them * [ 2015 canary islands regional election ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canarian_parliamentary_election,_2015 ) nationalist cc ends up in third , beaten by 1.7 % compared to the popular vote winner . 
  however they get the largest amount of seats ( 18 compared to the winner 's 15 ) . 
  * [ basque country regional election 1986 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basque_parliamentary_election,_1986 ) the nationalist pnv won the popular vote by 1.6 % but got 2 seats less than the centre-left psoe ( 17-19 ) so , if the us entered the eu ( let 's set aside the huge differences in size and economy ) , they would n't be that more democratic than us , at least at the local level . 
  even at the national level polls for the 2016 election were predicting that podemos would be 2nd in popular vote but 3rd in seats !, 
  ( then again they underperformed and ended up 3rd in the popular vote as well ) . 
  however , if the us entered the eu it * would * be forced to adopt some kind of proportional system to elect its meps . 
  the eu forces the european parliament to be proportional , so no fptp there . 
  so , just like the uk third parties would thrive in european elections but do terribly in national ones . 
  they would be allowed to keep the electoral system though . 
  democrat all the way . 
  if republicans were actually sane ( even just accepting global warming would be a huge step forwards ) i would at least consider them . 
  as of now , it 's democrat 100 % ( preferably of the `` sanders '' type ), 
  spanish kind of republican here ( do n't mind the monarchy that much but would prefer a republic ) , do n't mind  i actually hate it as well , and it carries some significant connotations ( see : spanish civil war ) . 
  i 'd argue the flag of the very short lived 1st republic is a better choice https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/flag_of_the_first_spanish_republic.svg/1200px-flag_of_the_first_spanish_republic.svg.png, 
   it is much easier to move between european countries than it was before the eu both permanentaly and for brief visits . 
  i 'd argue this is one of the arguments in favour of brexit , at least one of the ones used . 
  see : `` the polish are taking our jobs !!! 111 !! '', 
  extremely common . 
  they do n't get as many dubs as spanish , but they still get a lot . 
  here are examples of famous stuff dubbed into regional languages : * star wars vii in catalan : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncmz3ivj1xc * the hangover ( renamed as `` hangover in las vegas '' like the spanish version ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eg6sj1c-iw * one piece in basque : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yy4dedk__ww interesting to note , sometimes there are even several dubs in one language !, 
  catalan sometimes gets 2 sets of dubs , one for valencia and one for catalonia . 
  here 's a comparison for dragon ball z : * catalan ( catalonia ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjeal6rqilm * catalan/valencian ( valencia ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg5o3litjyy same thing happens with spanish !, 
  this time the split is between spanish from spain and spanish from latin america ( so if you wach a movie in spanish , it 's actually not what is being shown in spain for the most part ) . 
  here 's a comparison for the deadpool movie : * spanish ( spain ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyu7glphg-c * spanish ( latin america ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4ihpy1z1fg, 
  at least here in the canary islands they still do . 
  in fact antena 3 also has a regional connection , which is weird !, 
  ( i think we are the only ones who get it though ) . 
  it is right after the national news , not before though . 
  there is one for every autonomous community though : http://www.rtve.es/noticias/informativos-territoriales/, 
  for us i guess it 's because of 2 main reasons . 
  * first , simply there are n't that many spaniards here to begin with . 
  iirc we are one of the most underrepresented countries in reddit ( last time i checked we had a population of reddit users similar to that of latvia , which has 2 million people compared to our 45 million ) * secondly , many spaniards simply do n't identify as spanish ( we have important amounts of basque and catalan independentists , even in reddit ) . 
  thus , they probably would never use - es at the end of their username . 
  maybe - cat for those in catalonia also , ending your name with - es sounds terrible imo . 
  ca n't imagine being called / u/tack50-es xd that 's what flairs are for after all . 
  i guess that 's in summer . 
  do people still hang their wet clothes outside in russian winters ? 
  yes , but it does n't see that much use . 
  we just hang our clothes overnight unless we really need them dry fast for some reason . 
   this is more often in the nordic countries . 
  here in spain is rather impossible to combine both in cities such as madrid or barcelona . 
  i do n't know what you are talking about . 
  madrid is 55km away from navacerrada , which * is * the countryside . 
  more than what you said , but that 's because madrid is a large city after all . 
   i think the big difference is this : european news is not covered in the us in any meaningful manner . 
  brexit was basically a total of 15 minutes on the evening news spaced 2 minutes a day for a week or so . 
  for all what 's worth , even european news from other countries are not covered in europe , so i do n't expect the us to get those either unless it 's huge stuff like brexit . 
  we do n't get say , california or new york local news here either . 
  in theory europe wide news * should * be more relevant , but they are not that common ( one every 6 months-1 year ) . 
  i guess americans do know about brexit or the refugee crisis for example . 
  for all what 's worth there 's / r/shiteuropeanssay but it 's a lot less populated for some reason, 
   one of the main moments for which he 's remembered is his reaction in 1982 , when members of the military entered congress in a coup d'etat attempt . 
  while all his fellow congressmen dropped to the ground or hid under their tables at the sound of shots , he , along with the president , defied the armed intruders . 
  i remember reading that only he and suarez were the only ones not to obey almost for completely different reasons . 
  suarez supposedly knew about the coup ( yes , the page had quite a bit of tinfoil xd ) while carrillo just thought `` if the coup succeeds i 'll be dead regardless , so i might as well become a martyr '',

  andorra of course xd then again , merging with a self governing ski resort/tax heaven is not a huge achievement, 
  joining bosnia then ? 
  i 'd actually argue andalucia if it was n't because of their terrible economy xd everything else does check out,
