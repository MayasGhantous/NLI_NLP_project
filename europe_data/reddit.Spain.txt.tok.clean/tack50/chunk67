  surprisingly , andalucia strongest economy ? 
  mostly fail ( highest unemployment rate and relatively low gdp per capita ) , but in nominal terms they are third thanks to their high population largest population ? 
  check biggest cultural influence ? 
  definitely check ( the source of almost all spanish stereotypes xd ) generally liberal politics and social views ? 
  mostly check . 
  they do have the largest streak of voting psoe ( centre-left ) since they only went to the right on rajoy 's 2011 landslide ; and seville is one of only 2 provinces that has never voted for a right wing party . 
  on the other hand their branch of the psoe is notorious for being kind of conservative compared to the north of the country . 
  at the state level i 'd say they are generally liberal , but in terms of cities seville is definitely not the most liberal place in spain ( that 'd probably be barcelona ), 
  well , look at catalonia over here . 
  the independence movment has been stagnant for the last 6 years or so . 
  in the basque country it 's actually decreasing !, 
  will her and cameron be seen badly in british history ? 
  ( i guess it 's too early to tell though , maybe scotland does not become independent , the issue is settled and the british empire is resurrected while the eu fails xd ), 
  ah , the good old ~ ~ russian ~ ~ turkish minorities excuse xd, 
  could strasbourg keep the parliament , but brussels all other institutions ? 
  how would turkey take military action against the netherlands ? 
  unless they fly a bomber all the way from istanbul ( which would easily be detected ) , or throw missiles ( does turkey have missiles with a long enough range ? 
  ) , there 's no way for turkey to harm the netherlands . 
  then it 's ww3 , though it 's probably the weirdest and least expected reason to declare it xd, 
  i 'd thought it would be european russia/asian russia ? 
  to be fair , spanish is also called `` castillian '' often . 
  both terms are interchangable ( espa\u00f1ol / castellano ), 
   the only good part to francoist spain was that you know it ends eventually . 
  to be fair , he did do quite a bit of good stuff ( healthcare , lots of public businesses that a supposed socialist like gonzalez privatized  .  ; social security , good economy in the 60s , etc ) not saying `` franco did nothing wrong '' ; he was terrible , but even a terrible dictator was still able to do some good things, 
  yeah , i can see europe just flipping , with former communist countries going to the right and former capitalist ones to the left ( in fact you can already see it in politics right now xd ), 
  would n't a hypothetical `` german autoritarian left wing regime '' be basically the gdr ? 
  yup !, 
  to be precise he said : `` do like i did and do n't get involved in politics '' ( usted haga como yo y no se meta en pol\u00edtica ), 
  similar here . 
  i still have not visited the balearic islands , ceuta , melilla , extremadura and murcia . 
  i am just not that interested in them , except maybe extremadura . 
  the others seem either `` sun and beach '' destinations or just kind of uninteresting, 
  yup !, 
  more than 2 million people actually !, 
  ( more or less average for a spanish region ) iirc it 's the largest eu overseas territory by population . 
  yup . 
  remember bra71l ? 
  am canary islander , can confirm xd the touristy areas might as welk be british or german xd ( and mallorca is apparently even worse in that regard ), 
  do n't forget sandals with socks xd, 
  tbh i wish we had swedish levels of corruption . 
  i guess it 's a matter of perception . 
  well , the canary islands have actually banned bullfighting since 1991 or so !, 
  so you can come here and visit us xd catalonia also banned bullfighting in 2010 , but their ban was reciently overturned, 
  well , many parts of the us ( including the 3 most populated states ) did belong to spain once so i guess it 's hereditary xd, 
  there is also a similar movement for [ puerto rico ] ( http://reunificaciondepuertorico.blogspot.com.es/?m=1 ) apparently . 
  as for places that want to leave spain , there are the obvious ones ( catalonia/basque country ) and even the `` not quite as obvious but still passable '' ( canary islands/balearic islands/valencia/navarra / galicia ) , but there are even leon nationalists , andalusian nationalists , asturias nationalists and even cantabrian nationalists !, 
  ( these last ones actually leading the regional government ! ), 
  oh , my bad then . 
  still seems like a kind of weird fit . 
  wait , is n't tusk supposed to be poland 's `` left '' ( or at least center ) . 
  how could he reach a deal with that korwin guy ? 
  well , we do have quite some divisions . 
  most maps of spain will be divided in one of 2 ways : ** provinces ** they used to be the largest and most important subdivision of spain , but nowadays they are barely more than a geographical term . 
  most of the time ( but not always ) they are named after the capital city of the province . 
  they are still our constituencies for general elections to this day though , and they are quite old , dating back to the 1870s with only one change happening since : spitting the province of the canary islands into 2 : las palmas ( east ) and santa cruz de tenerife ( west ) . 
  even that change happened in the 1920s !, 
  provincial governments are called `` diputaciones '' and have very limited powers . 
  the way of electing them varies a lot depending on where you live : * in the basque country they are directly elected , and work like a small scale version of the autonomous community legislature * in single province autonomous communities ( eg madrid , cantabria , asturias , etc ) they are abolished and their powers have been replaced by the autonomous community for semi-obvious reasons . 
  * in the 2 insular communities ( canary islands and balearic islands ) the powers of the provinces are taken by island councils . 
  there is one for each island and they are directly elected and work like small scale autonomous communities with less power ; just like the provincial governments of the basque country . 
  * everywhere else ( eg andaluc\u00eda , castille-leon , etc ) there are still provincial governments , but they are seen as useless and a `` politician 's retirement home '' . 
  this is because unlike everywhere else , they are not directly elected . 
  instead they are elected by a meeting of all mayors in the province or something like that ( not sure exactly how they work ) . 
  there are 52 provinces in spain or so . 
  ** autonomous communities ** basically our equivalent to us states . 
  they have less powers in general ( for example the equivalent to a state constitution must be ratified by the `` federal government '' ) as spain is not a fully fledged federation , nor a unitary state ; but somewhere between the 2 . 
  in some areas they do have more powers though ; especially the basque country and navarra , which can collect their own taxes and do n't pay what they should ( they love this system and everyone else hates it , but since basque nationalists are often required to form a government no one has dared to remove it ) . 
  they are very new , dating only to the late 70s and early 80s ( although there were some experiments with similar stuff before , especially during both republics ) . 
  the governments of the autonomous communities are directly elected and work mostly the same everywhere ( there is still some variation from place to place , but for the most part they all work the same ) . 
  and yes , they are quite differenciated . 
  there are 17 autonomous communities plus the 2 autonomous cities ( slightly less power than an autonomous community ) of ceuta and melilla . 
  [ here 's a map of both spanish provinces and spanish autonomous communities ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ixpwqaqmvvs/tuwaqwrx_ji/aaaaaaaaabu/knwrredkpqm/s640/mapa+de+espa%25c3%2591a+pol%25c3%258dtico.gif ), 
  a b1 is probably enough to survive , but not enough to get a job or anything like that . 
  i 'd say to be able to survive without assistance ( ie get a job ) the minimum should be a b2 , preferrably a c1, 
  i think it is quite popular in the north ( especially in asturias ) , but at least here ( canary islands ) i 've never seen it . 
  depends on region , circumstances , etc , but unconditional unlimited income ( like iirc germany has for example ) is rare . 
  most of the time if you get welfare it will eventually run out ( unemployment for example runs out in 2 years iirc ) . 
  of course there are some people who fake stuff and can somehow `` tarzan '' ( no good term xd ) their way from welfare check to welfare check , but i have no idea how they do it . 
   in the real world yes , in reddit no . 
  no idea about bulgaria , but definitely here you also ca n't be left wing and opposed to inmigration . 
  then again it 's not like you can be right wing and opposed to inmigration either \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af all our major parties are in favour of inmigration and refugees , even if some more than others . 
  certain sections of the pp are exactly like that , but they hide it in order not to lose votes ( in fact some people are complaining about the pp being too leftist these days , but do n't dare to split into a new party other than vox , which gets 0.2 % of the vote ) . 
  most of them belong to the [ opus dei ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opus_dei ) catholic association . 
  the highest ranking members of that branch of the pp seem to be former minister of justice ( 2011-2014 ) , former governor of madrid `` state '' ( 1995-2003 ) and former mayor of madrid city ( 2003-2011 ) alberto ruiz gallard\u00f3n , who was fired after an incredibly controversial attempt to make abortions illegal in spain again ( abortions were legalized in 2010 ) . 
  in the end he was fired and the pp conservative government was only able to make abortions illegal to girls under 18 ( unless their parents authorized it ) . 
  another good example is former minister of the interior ( 2011-2016 ) jorge fernandez diaz , famous for having ran investigations targeting catalan indpendentist politicians . 
  tl ; dr : yes we have some of those but have to hide their true beliefs and be a lot more moderate than in the us to get elected, 
  yeah , i agree . 
  i 'd argue the catholic kings ( isabel-fernando ) come closer than juan carlos i or adolfo suarez though . 
  centre right . 
  somewhere between the 2 largest parties ( pp/psoe ), 
  no , as no right wing populist party exists in spain ( other than vox , which is a joke with 0.2 % of the vote . 
  i considere myself a leftist in economic issues but a centrist in social ones . 
  i * could * see myself voting for an alt right party if they were leftist/populist/not right wing in economics , but at that point they would n't be alt right anymore . 
  ( to put an example , i could see myself voting for le pen over fillon if i were french , but just in that match . 
  anything else and i would not vote for her ) in the only election i could vote i voted for the psoe social democrats , and in general i would alternate between them , podemos and left wing canary islands nationalists ( nc ) depending on the election . 
  i ca n't see myself voting for the pp except in very limited circumstances ( if our former pp mayor runs again i could vote for him for example , as he was/is not corrupt and did a good job , but he is the exception , not the norm ) . 
  same goes for ciudadanos . 
  did n't the french third and fourth republics have a lot of instability because of that ? 
  ciudadanos : basically the same as pp .
