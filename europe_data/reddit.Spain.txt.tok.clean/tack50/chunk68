  no referendum , no reforms , no nothing psoe : no referendum , but they are open to reforming spain to make it a more federal country podemos : open to a referendum , but does not want catalonia to leave . 
  same here . 
  closest thing was 2 people speaking portuguese in a bus , which i guess were inmigrants ( technically students as the bus was leaving university , but whatever ) but which i did n't personally know . 
  even though portugal is our next door neighbour , it 's rare to find portuguese people in spain . 
  the usual ; catalonia 's independence and corruption . 
  the most recient development in the former seems that the regional government of catalonia wants to hold their illegal referendum in june , and organize it so fast that courts do n't have enough time to stop it . 
  as for the latter , after the king 's brother-in-law was only sentenced to 6 years in prison and not even entering yet , the most recient development ( breaking news actually ) is that the governor of murcia , currently investigated for corruption , might be replaced with a cs + podemos + psoe coalition , as cs wanted him replaced with some other pp member and they refused . 
  this would add another governor to the psoe ( for a total of 8/17 iirc ) and would mark the first time since 1995 that murcia has a non pp governor . 
  yup !, 
  it actually refers to all americans btw , not just those from a certain region ( the northeast ? ) . 
  though it 's kind of an offensive way to refer to americans , not unlike `` gringos '', 
  well , the governor of my region ( canary islands ) did say that trump 's election was a good chance to get american tourists as they wo n't go to mexico anymore because of trump and the wall . 
  http://eldia.es/canarias/2017-02-12/3--trump-puede-abrir-turismo-americano.htm he was also mocked for that , and critizised by the left xd our left is 100 % anti trump , while our right still does not like him but is open to working with him . 
  other than that , our current pm rajoy has said he wants good relations with trump and the us , and he has been critizised by the left for that , saying that he wants another `` trio of the azores '' , in reference to the infamous bush-blair-aznar alliance to invade irak . 
  canary islander here ; supposedly our water is not drinkable xd ( or at least that 's what i 've always been told ) . 
  on the other hand , we apparently have good water so i 'm confused . 
  ok , here are some weird laws we apparently still have * in seville it 's forbidden to look for stuff in the thrash , under a 750 $ fine * in tenerife it 's forbidden to do sandcastles * you ca n't name your son cain , judas or lenin * in madrid you ca n't be a beggar with a dog * in bilbao it is forbidden to sleep in a car * in madrid you have to pass a test to be a street musician * in several cities you ca n't walk outside without a t-shirt * in several cities you ca n't sing on the street not sure how many of these are enforced though ( definitely not the `` no sandcastles in tenerife '' though xd ), 
  wait , you also need a majority in the senate as well ? 
  or is that just to make governing more comfortable ? 
  can the lower chamber override the senate ? 
  ( just like here , where iirc the senate only delays laws ; we had a divided congress-senate back in 04 ), 
  well , i identify as canary islander and spanish mostly equally . 
  i would also add `` european '' in an incredibly distant third and with a ton of asterisks attatched to it though ( mostly because of the eu ) . 
  no spanish in there anywhere ? 
  i assume you want independence ? 
  spaniard here , and while spanish is the overwhelmingly dominant language , we do have quite a bit of regional languages . 
  my region ( canary islands ) does n't have any regional language though , so here people just speak spanish except for tourists and foreigners . 
  however in navarra , the basque country , catalonia , valencia , galicia and the balearic islands ( that 's 6/17 `` states '' ) there is a regional language , and almost everyone there speaks both . 
  catalonia and the basque country do use their regional language a bit more than the others though ( especially navarra , where iirc only the northern half speaks basque ) i personally would probably understand galician well ( very similar to spanish ) ; and also catalan without that much difficulty ( again , not too far from spanish ) . 
  especially for written stuff . 
  however basque might as well be moonspeak xd ( literally unrelated to any other language in the world ), 
  yup . 
  i mean , spain has some glaringly obvious flaws , but the good things about it are usually not considered , hence why we have half the country with nationalist movments xd, 
  so , repeat elections and minority like us await the netherlands ? 
  expect interesting politics from now on then xd, 
  canary islands here , and there are a lot of tourists . 
  they mostly stay in the sunnier southern half of the islands while most people live in the north so there are n't that many exactly where i live ( though you can still see quite a bit in the city centre , just not as many ) , but the south is full of them . 
  they are mostly from germany and the uk, 
  well , i guess you could do the return trip through more of an eastern route , though there will be some overlap no matter what . 
  i think this might be an ok route : https://www.google.es/maps/dir/estocolmo/bruselas/barcelona/mil%c3%a1n/m%c3%banich/berl%c3%adn/59.3389071,18.0797348/@49.7555081,-5.1457012,4z/data=!4m49!4m48!1m5!1m1!1s0x465f763119640bcb:0xa80d27d3679d7766!2m2!1d18.0685808!2d59.3293235!1m10!1m1!1s0x47c3a4ed73c76867:0xc18b3a66787302a7!2m2!1d4.3517103!2d50.8503396!3m4!1m2!1d2.2808656!2d48.8773391!3s0x47e66ff53114dce7:0x4475735583178bf6!1m5!1m1!1s0x12a49816718e30e5:0x44b0fb3d4f47660a!2m2!1d2.1734035!2d41.3850639!1m5!1m1!1s0x4786c1493f1275e7:0x3cffcd13c6740e8d!2m2!1d9.1859243!2d45.4654219!1m5!1m1!1s0x479e75f9a38c5fd9:0x10cb84a7db1987d!2m2!1d11.5819806!2d48.1351253!1m10!1m1!1s0x47a84e373f035901:0x42120465b5e3b70!2m2!1d13.404954!2d52.5200066!3m4!1m2!1d12.5126811!2d55.6963023!3s0x465253cd84ff403b:0x9b1a7dc0da8caf69!1m0!3e0 in short , it is : stockholm ( or wherever you live in sweden ) - brussels-barcelona ( your route , sort of ) ; then go back via milan , munich and berlin . 
  you can also stop in paris between brussels and barcelona as it 's right in the middle of your trip, 
  yeah , the entire north mostly qualifies , especially asturias , the basque country and the province of leon . 
  galicia has always been rural though , and i 'm not sure if cantabria was all that induztrialized . 
  as you said the basque country has managed to find a way out , but asturias has n't . 
  catalonia was ( and still is ) the other large industrial region , but they are doing fine and never went through a rough period . 
  yeah . 
  iirc was n't turkey more or less democratic and free before erdogan ? 
  i do n't remember any such periods for russia, 
  maybe not outright win , but he could have tried to reach a peace deal with britain after conquering france . 
  alternatively he should have forgotten about the soviet union and concentrated himself on taking britain at all costs if they would not capitulate . 
  students will grab any opportunity to throw ~ ~ a themed ~ ~ party with lots of drinking ftfy , 
  german with flexible word orders ? 
  i always thought it was too strict ( having to place verbs on the 2nd position or at the end for example , as opposed to wherever you want in spanish ), 
  apparently you can replace altgr with ctrl + alt , but i 'm not sure if that 's viable, 
  nowadays , no . 
  back on the day ( late 90s early 00s ) we did have a version of trump ( a rich populist businessman entering politics , although he was a centrist not a far right populist ) . 
  he was jesus gil and was the former mayor of marbella and president of atl\u00e9tico de madrid . 
  yeah , the closest thing to spanish trump is probably jesus gil by far ( businessman , president of atl\u00e9tico de madrid and former mayor of marbella ) for living active politicians i guess miguel \u00c1ngel revilla ( governor of cantabria ) is the closest thing to a spanish trump , but even he has nothing in common with trump other than being populist and appearing a lot on tv ( at least compared to other governors ), 
  only whatsapp . 
  that 's the only messaging app spaniards use . 
  living without whatsapp is basically like living under a rock . 
  yeah , while i appreciate juan carlos for what he did during the 1981 coup and transitioning spain into a democracy peacefully , he is far from the best king of spain . 
  ( then again , looking back you have to go back to carlos iii to find a genuinely good king ) . 
  he will go down in history as a good king overall , but who could have been so much better if he had n't been part of so many scandals . 
  also , lluis companys is not a good choice either . 
  i personally feel that our only choice is `` error 404 : file not found '' . 
  maybe adolfo suarez if you need someone . 
  telecinco is probably the least politically biased , but they are a bit sensationalist , and even then their news coverage is pretty limited anyways . 
  the public broadcaster tve is considered to be pretty good , though it 's worse than it used to be . 
  all other channels have some sort of bias . 
  in some it 's a blatantly obvious bias while in others it is more subtle . 
  [ this is what he said ] ( https://aleon.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/pujol-andaluces.jpg ), 
  war . 
  war never changes . 
  wow , that 's a lot ( probably on par if not better than our ~ 22 channels ) on the other hand , iirc american tv is a lot different in how it works compared to europe . 
  if i understand correctly , you ( in new york ) do n't get the same stuff as someone in say , los angeles , even in national channels . 
  ( we kinda use the us model for radio , but for tv you always get the same stuff at the same time no matter where you live , with few exceptions for regional news or advertising ), 
  somewhere around 22 channels . 
  no tv tax ; just plug in your tv and you are ready to go . 
  out of memory and in no particular order : la 1 ( tve ) la 2 ( tve ) antena 3 ( a3media ) cuatro ( mediaset ) telecinco ( mediaset ) la sexta ( a3media ) 13tv 24h ( tve ) clan ( tve ) disney channel boing ( mediaset ) ten dkiss ( discovery ) dmax ( discovery ) a3series ( a3media ) bemad ( mediaset ) gol divinity ( mediaset ) energy ( mediaset ) neox ( a3media ) nova ( a3media ) teledeporte ( tve ) mega ( a3media ) fdf ( mediaset ) paramount channel real madrid tv you also get some regional channels . 
  where i live there 's just one ( tv canaria ) but some places like catalonia can have up to 10 !, 
  wait , does someone still use a black and white license ? 
  nope , gran canaria, 
  since i live on an island , yes , it is quite a lot . 
  you ca n't drive more than like 150 km without going in circles , and even that is a full loop . 
  70 km is probably the upper limit . 
  for mainland spain it is still quite a bit . 
  200 miles ( 320km ) is slightly less than madrid-valencia ( 360km ) , which is probably not a day trip . 
  to be fair , there is a group of people inside the pp that complains that rajoy is too leftist and they want to move to the right ; led by former pm jose maria aznar , and supported by the catholic church , but even they are not trump like . 
  iirc they just want more conservative economics , repealing abortion and reforming gay marriage so it is n't called marriage anymore . 
  exactly the same here in spain . 
  cc is only really meant for possible victims of terrorism or mafias . 
  for all what 's worth even if you join a club here you ca n't carry a gun with you iirc . 
  it must be at home , on the club or sonething ( ca n't go on the street with a covered gun ) . 
  only exception is an extremely limited one for endangered people , probably meant for possible victims of terrorism, 
  i thought the funny one was the murcian accent , which even has some [ memes ] ( https://www.cosasdeunabailarina.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/dosmas.jpg ) ? 
  and of course , then there 's the canarian accent , best exemplified by [ `` yahel '' , the colacao kid ] ( https://www.google.es/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=video&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahukewifzopfmjtsahwmd8akhv4pcyqqtwiigjaa&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3dgyjgdljv5jk&amp;usg=afqjcnfjqhifpkmcc4lzbwvwvj1jwriucq&amp;sig2=e-jeuclapcbnviielrmyog&amp;bvm=bv.147134024,d.zgg ), 
  well , that 's probably fairly priced . 
  my laptop , costed me 610 $ and it had : i5-6200u ; geforce 940mx ; 12gb of ram , 1tb hard drive ( no ssd ) . 
  15 inch 768p display .
