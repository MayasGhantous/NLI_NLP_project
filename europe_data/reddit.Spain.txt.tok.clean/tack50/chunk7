  also , brexit would n't be necessarely the thing that starts that . 
  an orderly exit from the uk that puts it in the eea or something would n't be very harmful to to either side . 
  also , looking back at how we were 100 years ago , we had a socialist/communist revolution attempt disguised as a `` general revolutionary strike '' in 1917 and a successful coup in 1923 that made us a dictatorship ( it did n't last long though ) . 
  not like any of those events have any chance of repeating themselves though . 
  yeah , i still remember our regional government ( canary islands ) praising themselves for having reduced high school dropouts last year or so when in fact it 's just that the depression has forced many to go back to school . 
  oddly enough we are getting record high tourism yet we are still the second autonomous community with the most unemployment iirc . 
  guess there 's only so many jobs tourism can provide . 
  and yes ceuta is very very weird and terrible in stats . 
  iirc they have what , 80 % youth unemployment there ? 
  not really . 
  as terrible as our politicians are , putin has a rating of -80 . 
  i 'm guessing that sort of translates to a 1/10 ? 
  for reference , our politicians scores on the last [ ratings ] ( http://www.expansion.com/economia/politica/2016/08/08/57a86592e5fdeadd6d8b4609.html ) i saw were : * rajoy : 3,35 ( equivalent to -33 ) * sanchez : 3,96 ( equivalent to -21 ) * iglesias : 3,48 ( equivalent to -30 ) * rivera : 3,93 ( equivalent to -21 ) * garzon : 4,55 ( equivalent to -9 ) so , our politicians are terrible , but still better than putin : /, 
  i thought the quiet and asocial stereotype was finnish , not swedish ? 
  i thought polls projected one for 2015 ( and one did happen in 2010 ), 
  could a hung parliament happen instead ? 
  is n't the conservative majority quite slim after all ? 
  well , i guess that is because i sexually identify as an attack helicopter, 
  yeah , when i think of the kid programmes from my childhood ( that were n't cartoons ) i did n't really think of them as entertaining . 
   meanwhile in japan is that an actual kid show in japan !, 
  has the number of fires seen a meaningful increase though ? 
  ( betting on yes , but i 'd like to see a source ), 
  still better than the former `` axis of good '' , comprised of venezuela , cuba and bolivia http://web.archive.org/web/20120130192419/http://www.granma.cu/espanol/2006/enero/mier4/2caracas.html, 
  wait , what ? 
  italy 's gdp in 2000 was 1.1 billion . 
  now it 's 2,1 billion . 
  that 's definitely not `` barely bigger '' . 
  unless it 's ppp or per capita , in which case \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  this could actually fit in / r/nottheonion xd, 
  iirc laws must also be passed by the council , where 1 country = 1 vote we should get a true elected senate though , just like the us . 
  to be fair , their proportion of citizens in the eu is closer to 1/6 , so they actually have less seats than they should, 
  to be fair , germany only has 99/751 seats in the eu parl , and 1/27 ( or 28 ) ? 
  votes in the council . 
  pretty sure they ca n't blackmail by themselves, 
  damn , and i thought the la palma situation was already bad . 
  it 's nothing compared to madeira 's : $ hope things get better , but if the weather is anything similar to what we are having here ( 37 c max in the mountains , though the main city stops at 30 due to some lucky climate stuff ) , it will be hard, 
  well , i 'm a spaniard myself and i 'd say the most important is english you get nowhere today without it ) then either french and german ; both equally useful . 
  french opens many doors in africa if you so wish though , so it gets an slight advantage overall , but if you plan on staying in europe they are exactly equal . 
  i 'd never consider chinese to be a good idea unless you plan on living there . 
  german learning looks like a cakewalk compared to chinese . 
  for the record i know english and german . 
  at my old school ( which i attended until year 7 ) i learned french as well ( we had to pick either that or german at year 9 iirc ) . 
  had i stayed there , i 'd have probably picked french ( my german was awful in comparison ) . 
  however , when i moved to another school we learned only german and english , so i did n't get to make the choice and i have already forgotten almost all of my french . 
  then again , i went to a private school . 
  on a public one you only learn broken english amd very very broken french ; plus native catalan/basque/galician if you live in the respective regions . 
  pretty sure we could bribe libia or argelia to take them in . 
  '' `` rescue them '' '' ie bring them back to libia , turkey or wherever they came from . 
  australia does that and no one cares, 
  well , i do n't live in one of those towns , so i ca n't talk in first person ( podemos did support our socialist mayor , which is n't doing that great of a job tbh . 
  iirc the government is socialists + left wing nationalists , not sure if podemos is in as well ) . 
  from what i can tell in the most important podemos controlled town halls : ** madrid ** carmena is actually doing a pretty decent job . 
  not sure about what she has done tbh , but it does n't seem to me like she has done a bad job . 
  slightly better than the former pp mayor . 
  if i lived there , i would consider reelecting her ( she 's very old though , not sure if she 'll run for reelection ) ** barcelona ** on the opposite side to madrid , barcelona 's mayor colau has done a terrible job . 
  there were some riots caused by something the town hall did ( unsure on the details ) , dumb fines and they had trouble passing a budget !, 
  i 'd definitely not reelect her ( not sure who i 'd vote for instead though . 
  maybe the socialists ? ) . 
  oddly enough i heard once she was considering running for catalonia governor/regional assembly mp , but i 'm not sure if this is true or not . 
  even worse , the current catalonian leader puigdemont in my opinion is quite decent if you remove the independence debate . 
  much better than mas . 
  ** cadiz ** barely know anything . 
  i only know that they reduced the debt and that the former pp mayor was terrible , so i guess podemos is doing a nice job there . 
  well , that 'd end pretty quickly . 
  i seriously doubt soldiers in catalonia would support a revolution against spain . 
  even if they did , they 'd be greatly outnumbered . 
  if they could get international support , they might have a very slim chance though . 
  if you want a beach holiday in spain , try going to the northern cantabric sea ( cantabria or asturias ) instead of the mediterranean . 
  colder , but much more beutiful . 
  if you still prefer the mediterranean , try going to the less known places then ( almeria or girona most likely . 
  maybe huelva or cadiz as well ) . 
  for the balearic islands probably go to menorca over mallorca , ibiza or even formentera . 
  for the canary islands pick la palma , la gomera or el hierro for a mountain holiday and fuerteventura for a beach one , especially the harder to reach west coast . 
  in gran canaria the capital city , las palmas has an awesome beach as well , especially for a city !, 
  well , we actually use that system in eu parliament elections ( and iirc germany does as well ) . 
  our hurdle in national elections is actually lower than germany 's though ( 3 % in a constituency , which means you can get votes with as little as 0,4 % of the vote as a regional party ; like the canarian coalition does ) . 
  in practice though most places do n't have enough seats for a 3 % hurdle ( only madrid and barcelona ) . 
  everywhere else the hurdle is way bigger ; more than 30 % in places like soria !, 
  ideally we should have autonomical constituencies , not provincial ones ( castille is overrepresented and madrid underrepresented for instance ), 
  meanwhile here not a single one of our politicians gets a positive score : $ albert rivera ( liberal ciudadanos ) and alberto garz\u00f3n ( far left unidos podemos ) used to get bare passes ( like +1 or so ) , but now they do n't . 
  wow til : / i thought the falklands were unpopular until the war was won ( why care for 1k inhabitant islands 6000km away ; from a country that is definitely not a threat to national security ? ), 
  pretty much . 
  i mean , looking at our neighbours and a semi-recient '' `` war '' '' : * portugal : would yield an even war stalemate most likely . 
  still , why the fuck would we go to war with them ??? 
  they are probably the best neighbour we have  * france : we 'd be curbstomped ( thinking on something like the 1898 war against the us ) . 
  then again , there 's literally no reason to go to war with them . 
  * andorra : why would we ever invade or be invaded by a glorified self-governing ski resort ? 
  xd * uk ( gibraltar ) : hardest scenario to tell the outcome ; but i 'm leaning on a falklands-ish war . 
  the uk will definitely never do a first strike though , and an invasion would be ridiculously unpopular . 
  * morocco : most realistic scenario . 
  we almost went to war with them in 2002 . 
  i 'm leaning on a spanish victory , but a canary islands invasion woule be kind of hard to defend against . 
  this is probably also the only war that could be popular ; especially in case of an invasion of the peninsula or the islands . 
  * canada : there was an incident with them in 1995 , soo : / . 
  still , this would be the weirdest of all . 
  i ca n't even imagine how it 'd look like . 
  ca n't see canada invading galicia or spain invading newfoundland xd, 
  yeah , most people i know of would just try to get the first flight/ship out of the country and never look back . 
  / r/totallynotrobots, 
  yeah , a full war against morocco for ceuta and melilla could be unpopular , but surrendering might be even more unpopular .
