  if susana d\u00edaz wins the primaries , they are dead for me though ( literally making rajoy president and asking for nothing in exchange ) . 
  s\u00e1nchez or l\u00f3pez are good choices though . 
  * podemos : kind of the opposite problem than the psoe . 
  too leftist in some issues , especially social ones ( feminism , inmigration , etc ) , but again , it 's not like there are important parties truly opposed to those . 
  * nueva canarias : the main problem with them is that they are very small . 
  currently they only hold power in gran canaria 's island assembly . 
  they are my favourite party ( and only one i 'd reelect ) , but since they are so small , i often have to vote for another party that is in coalition with them ( in 2016 that was the psoe ) . 
  the biggest issue with them is that sometimes they feel like a centre-left gran canaria based version of cc , which is a terrible party . 
  first of all , keep in mind european countries usually have their own set of issues , so they are not really directly comparable . 
  ( for example , independence of catalonia is a huge issue here that does n't really have equivalents outside of quebec or scotland , and those are a stretch anyways . ), 
  with that in mind :  economics : i am a liberal . 
  i think that private companies are usually more efficient and have better financial results . 
  i also think that some things should be controlled by the state ( police , military ) . 
  for health and education , the state should guarantee free access . 
  this definitely puts you on the pp . 
  maybe on the more right wing members of ciudadanos as well , though i 'm not sure how much ( the party actually removed all references to social democracy yesterday ; redefining itself as `` liberal-progressives '' . 
  vox might also fit . 
   immigration : i am anti muslim immigration , because in my experience , those people do n't integrate well on western societies and refuse to change their values , probably because they stay ultra religious . 
  i have no problem with immigration from other countries , inside or outside eu . 
  black , white , all the same . 
  you are out of luck here . 
  all parties in spain are pro inmigration to some extent ( including the refugees and muslims ) . 
  i guess there 's vox , but those people are incredibly minoritarian ( 0.2 % of the vote in the last election )  social rights : pro gay marriage , pro abortion , pro legal weed , anti euthanasia . 
  probably ciudadanos here . 
  they are the only ones that have referenced legal marijuana at all iirc . 
  podemos and the psoe are also very pro gay marriage and pro abortion , but i 'm not sure about the other 2 . 
  these kinds of issues are very small here in spain anyways , they barely get a mention  eu : i was a federalist , but now i am very eurosceptic . 
  even so , i would like to see a open europe , with closed external borders . 
  the closest thing to a eurosceptic party here is podemos ( and even they are very mildly eurosceptic ) , but they are eurosceptic for the opposite reasons as you ( iirc they say it is too neoliberal and for the bankers ) . 
  again , vox might be your best choice , but they are incredibly tiny . 
   i think that donal trump is a dumb guy , but he was elected , and probably because he did n't forget that us is not only california and the east coast , but also a lot of inner cities and communities that have been economically devastated in the last decade . 
  0 references to this whatsoever . 
  no one cares about trump other than disliking him , but having to work with him ( reminds me a bit of the situation after zapatero got elected here , who had very bad relations with george w bush )  i am a big supporter of green energy all parties are pro green energy , but the left wing ones ( psoe and especially podemos ) more than the right wing ones . 
  overall , you have a set of issues that are n't common in spain . 
  i think the party which is closest to your views might be vox , but they are a meme ( literally planting spanish flags in gibraltar and having `` make spain great again '' as their slogan ) and incredibly small ( 0.2 % of the vote ) out of the mainstream parties , ciudadanos seems your best bet , but they are pro eu , maybe a bit too left wing on the economy and pro inmigration . 
  well , barcelona to london or rome is only viable by plane . 
  to london iirc just avoid heathrow ( the `` standard '' expensive airport ) and the flights will be cheaper . 
  no idea about rome though . 
  in theory i guess you could fly from girona airport instead of barcelona proper if there are flights from there , but i 'm not sure if it 's viable or cheaper, 
  the data is quite outdated ( 2001 ) , but according to the spanish institute of statistics ( ine ) , the average heights for 15-24 year olds were : men : 177 cm women : 166 cm average : 171 cm i guess it might have increased by 1 or 2 cm over the last 16 years . 
  kind of reminds me of how the 2nd largest spanish speaking country is not colombia or spain anymore , but the usa . 
  definitely the economic crisis . 
  alternatively , the 2004 attacks in madrid combined with the 04 election happenign 3 days later and everything that happened during that short time . 
  yeah . 
  then again i 'm a man and not only am i the only one who uses reddit , i 'm the only one who posts regularly in forum boards period : /, 
  to be fair , i 'm a man and i also found reddit by accident . 
  i think it was either due to a guy posting a 10000 year long game of civ 2 , or twitch plays pokemon related news when it came out . 
  even then it took me a whole year and a half to get to know how reddit worked  . , 
  i think there 's actually a semi-official lyric from the 1920s , but it 's very uncommon to see . 
  exactly the same thing here with tuenti . 
  it was basically spanish facebook . 
  that collapsed quickly around 2013 or so . 
  the company still survives as a phone company , but is way smaller than back on the day . 
  actually , i am cardless , not cash less !, 
  i am only 18 though . 
  i only would really use cards to buy stuff on the internet , and for that i normally just ask my parents and pay them in cash the amount spent . 
  of course if i lived alone it 'd be a whole different story, 
  probably a 3 or so . 
  a bit more stable for now , but still pretty unstable . 
  el mundo is probably the most neutral newspaper . 
  abc and la raz\u00f3n are notoriously conservative and el pa\u00eds is too in bed with the psoe . 
  most people here use tu for singular . 
  usted is seen as pretty formal , so even in some formal contexts it is used ( though usted is preferred for most formal stuff ) for plural the same thing happens with vosotros ( informal ) and ustedes . 
  ( formal ) ** however ** , in essencially all spanish speaking places outside europe ( basically latin america and the canary islands ) ustedes is the only plural form used while vosotros is not used at all . 
  it sounds pretty archaic in those places . 
  politically the main difference seems to be that old people vote for pp/psoe ( the old parties ) while young people vote for podemos/ciudadanos . 
  old people are also a lot more religious and tend to live in rural areas while young people are irreligious and live in cities . 
  are you referring to prime minister , governor , what ? 
  anyways , in my case : ** prime minister ** best : adolfo suarez worst : tie between felipe gonzalez , jose mar\u00eda aznar , jose luis rodriguez zapatero and mariano rajoy ( ie all others ), 
  actually , the largest countries for inmigrants in spain by far are morocco ( close so it makes sense ) and romania ( no idea why ), 
  not exactly that , but zara is considered a low cost brand over here , while i 've heard that everywhere else it is n't considered that bad . 
  yeah ; just looked at the price of barcelona-paris trains and they cost 160 $ one way !, 
  similar distances in both spain ( barcelona-seville ) or france ( biarritz-paris ) cost half of the international one ( around 80 $ in both cases ), 
  ok , looking at each leg : * barcelona-paris : your best bet seems to get a cheap ryanair flight plus some bus from beauvais to the airport ( beauvais is actually 100 km away from paris ) . 
  that costs roughly 35 $ . 
  forget about trains ( more than 100 $ ) or buses ( 95 $ ) . 
  even a non low cost flight from vueling would make more sense ( around 60 $ ) * paris-brussels : a bus ( ouibus ) is your best bet apparently . 
  it only takes 4h and costs 20 $ . 
  a train is faster ( 1h 30 min ) but also more expensive ( around 60 $ ) . 
  they are pretty close , so there are n't many flights . 
  * brussels-amsterdam : exactly the same thing . 
  buses cost around 25 $ but take 4h . 
  trains cost 65 $ and take 2h tl ; dr : go barcelona-paris by plane , everything else by bus, 
  i 'd say most elections have been like that here . 
  2011 was by far the worst in that regard as someone said ( remember why the 15m protests happened ) . 
  also i feel like our regional elections ( canary islands ) do n't really matter . 
  thanks to our great electoral system where a party with 5.9 % gets nothing but one with 0.3 % gets 3/60 seats and where you can lose the popular vote and get the largest amount of seats ( just like in the us ) cc has been ruling since 1993 , even though the last time they won an election outright was in 2003 , and in fact they came in third in the popular vote this election  . , 
  [ here 's a pic ] ( http://cdn.20m.es/img2/recortes/2011/07/30/27882-846-550.jpg ) of the 2 candidates . 
  for those who do n't know , that election had 2 candidates ( it was the last election where the 2 party system was very strong ) : * minister of the interior alfredo perez rubalcava ( 2006-2011 ) , from the psoe . 
  * former vice president ( 2000-2003 ) and minister for several stuff , mariano rajoy , of the pp . 
  in the end , rajoy won a landslide in what was considered a very boring election ( no one really expected the psoe to win after the terrible second term of zapatero ) . 
  one of the most notable things about that election though is the enormous margin of victory for rajoy . 
  the united left also had a good showing , with 7 % and 11 mps , the best since 1996 . 
  rubalcava was unable to win a single autonomous commmunity . 
  even andalucia voted for rajoy for 9 points !, 
  he did come much closer in catalonia somehow ( 29-26 for ciu ) . 
  he did win 2 constituencies ( provinces ) narrowly though ; barcelona and seville, 
  did n't you have a chance to fix it , sort of , and screwed it up badly ? 
  so , you 'd be ok with catalonia 's independence if we give it to the balearic islands , the valencian community and aragon as well ? 
  no , thankfully not  ( i do n't think that 's a good idea tbh , even if it 's the most basic of stuff ) we do have some sections that are especially entrenched and incredibly convoluted to reform , which are the monarchy , and the fundamental stuff and basic rights .
