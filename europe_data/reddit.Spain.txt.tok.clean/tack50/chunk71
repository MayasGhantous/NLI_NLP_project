  catalonia 's main obstacle towards independence is on that part of the constitution ( article 2 to be precise ) . 
  to reform or repeal it you 'd need 2/3 of both chambers at first . 
  then they are inmediately dissolved and we get another election . 
  after that they newly elected chambers must ratify the reform , again by 2/3 of each . 
  finally a binding referendum is called , and that one must pass ( no special requirements though , just 50 % +1 without any minimum turnout ) . 
  the only time i rememeber this kind of reform being discussed was when the queen ( then princess ) was pregnant with her second child and the first had been a daughter . 
  if she had had a son , then we 'd probably have reformed the constitution that way in order to ensure that the daughter did n't get skipped ( spanish law says that in the case of several siblings , the oldest brother gets the crown , even if he 's the youngest . 
  daughters are only considered in the absence of sons ) . 
  since she had another daughter , the issue was not discussed any further . 
  yeah , but you need a big majority to reform the constitution and only podemos ( third largest party ) seems open to reforming it though the `` elaborate way '' , the one that would allow to repeal or reform article 2 and give catalonia a binding referendum . 
  for an `` elaborate reform '' or an outright new constitution you need 2/3 of both chambers , new elections being called , 2/3 of the newly elected chambers and finally a binding referendum passing . 
  everyone else is either opposed to reforming the constitution that way , instead opting for the `` limited way '' ( ca n't replace fundamental stuff or the monarchy ) . 
  some parties are more ambitious than others , from the full federalist ideas of the psoe ( i thing they want something like the `` united states of spain '' ? ), 
  to the pp , which does n't really want reforms but has said that if other parties want them they 'll negotiate . 
  in this case you only need either 3/5 of both chambers or 2/3 of the congress of deputies and 50 % +1 of the senate . 
  a binding referendum is optional ( the last 2 reforms did n't need it ) , but if 10 % of all senators or congressmen call for one , it will be required . 
  since podemos has said that they 'll call for one no matter the reform , a referendum will happen if we reform the constitution . 
   except for one smail detail , scotland is a country , catalonia is n't so what ? 
  they can still become a country for the first time if they so choose . 
  that 's not an argument at all . 
  and i 'm not even from there , nor would i like them to leave . 
  for all what 's worth i think the way we handle it is that illegal inmigrants can only go if they have an emergency , while everyone else can go to their standard doctors as well . 
  so , we have 2 of those then , and could probably have 3 ? 
  ( some sort of food stamps for the poor would be a good idea imo ), 
  fine , why not run 50 single payer systems at the state level , instead of 1 at the national level ? 
  ( though maybe the funding would have to come from the federal government , at least in part ) that 's what we do here after all , and it works well enough . 
  my sweet galician child las palmas-anywhere : no trains :p planes and boats are ok if you live here though . 
  including the 50 % discount from the government ( multiply by 2 to get your price ) las palmas-sc de tenerife : 32 $ , 1h ( by boat or plane , does n't matter ) las palmas-barcelona : 60 $ , 3h, 
  it 's basically a self governing ski station tbh , which also serves as a tax heaven, 
  it 's forbidden over here ( though i think this varies in a town to town basis anyways ) . 
  that does n't stop people from doing so though ; it 's pretty common to go to an area that is n't crowded and just drink there ( the infamous `` botell\u00f3n '' ), 
  not mine , but [ this video ] ( https://youtu.be/t-to1wy4co0 ) divides the us into regions pretty much perfectly, 
  so , reverse siesta ? 
  on the flip side even in winter the sun gets down at like 5:30 or so . 
  brexit was also non binding ; that is n't a problem, 
  here 's a question i can answer first hand :d ( currently trying to get my license ) there are 2 tests here , a theory one , and a practical one . 
  ** theory test ** you get 30 multiple choice questions , and must have at least 27 right to pass the test . 
  there are lots of online courses and resources , as well as books to study . 
  many places also offer classes if you so choose . 
  it 's quite easy if you do a lot of practice tests to be honest ** practice test ** i think this one is like 10-15 min free driving , then a similar amount of time with the examiner telling you where to go . 
  there are 3 kinds of mistakes you can make : slight , bad and disqualifying . 
  10 slight mistakes and you are out . 
  2 bad mistakes and you are out . 
  5 slight and a bad one and you are out . 
  one disqualifying mistake and you are out . 
  for this one you must go take driving lessons , at approximately 25 $ each . 
  you normally require something like 25 to take the test with confidence , though that number will vary wildly depending on your abilities ( i for example apparently suck at driving , so it will take me a couple more lessons ) . 
  well , first of all , 99 % of movies in spain are dubbed in spanish . 
  if you are in a large city you might be able to find a cinema that shows subbed versions , but they are rare . 
  i guess if you live near the portuguese border you * might * be able to watch the movie subbed in portugese there ( they rarely dub movies ) , but i 'm not sure how feasible that would be . 
  as for `` pel\u00edcula enumerada '' , that means that the tickets are numbered , ie you get a fixed seat ( row 3 seat 14 for example ) , and you have to sit there . 
  if it said `` pel\u00edcula no enumerada '' , then you can basically sit wherever you want . 
  ok , here are some ( not necesarily limited to odd , bad or ridiculous ) : article 47 :  all spaniards have the right to enjoy decent and adequate housing . 
  the public authorities shall promote the necessary conditions and establish appropriate standards in order to make this right effective , regulating land use in accordance with the general interest in order to prevent speculation . 
  the community shall have a share in the benefits accruing from the town-planning policies of public bodies . 
  i think we all know how this one really works ( see corruption and speculation running rampant among politicians and other people and the housing bubble ) article 56.3  the person of the king is inviolable and shall not be held accountable . 
  his acts shall always be countersigned in the manner established in section 64 . 
  without such countersignature they shall not be valid , except as provided under section 65 ( 2 ) what all of this means is that in theory the king of spain could kill someone or commit a crime and he would n't go to jail or be trialed in court for it . 
  this is definitely one of the worst and weirdest articles . 
  article 128  1 the entire wealth of the country in its different forms , irrespective of ownership , shall be subordinated to the general interest . 
  public initiative in economic activity is recognised . 
  essential resources or services may be reserved by law to the public sector especially in the case of monopolies . 
  likewise , state intervention in companies may be imposed when the public interest so demands . 
  section 1 is the more interesting here . 
  again , slightly odd , but then again we all know how it works in reality, 
  wait , if for some reason croatia wanted to legalize gay marriage , could n't it do it with a regular law ? 
  our constitution states :  1 : men and women shall have the right to marry with equal rights . 
   2 : a law shall regulate the ways of marriage , the rights and duties of the married , the age and requirements to marry and the causes and effects of separation yet we legalized gay marriage without ammending the constitution ( though i guess point 2 is probably a loophole ), 
  to be fair , i thought that happened everywhere . 
  in fact we had that exact same scenario back in the late 19th century . 
  the king had his 3rd child after he died ( the other 2 were girls , so if he had a boy , he 'd be the heir , but if he had another daughter , then the oldest sister gets the crown ) . 
  in the end he had a son , so he would become king when he became 18 ( alfonso xiii ) . 
  however , that 's not something written down , it 's just assumed, 
  i prefer to play on my native language 100 % i do n't care if a game is only available in english , but if there 's a spanish version available , i 'll play that one , even if the translation is pretty bad ( final fantasy vii comes to mind , though that one is almost a `` so bad it 's good '' kind of thing ) . 
  then again , many games with voice acting are only available in english with subtitles . 
  i think only ubisoft routinely dubs its games . 
  for all what 's worth , in eu servers most of the time people default to english unless there 's a premade ( ie friends playing together ) or people from the same place . 
  is that max allowed weight ( ie car + people + cargo ) ? 
  but most likely that would be considered a large car though , especially for legal purposes . 
  it does n't look like a truck to me . 
  same here . 
  we do have what we call `` furgonetas '' , which are small vans under 3.5 tons ( so you do n't need a separate license ) . 
  they do n't really look like ops car though , even the ones intended for people onstead of cargo ( some are intended for carrying more 6-9 , people on a car iirc . 
  more and it 's a bus ), 
  yeah , but then again considering our current pm is rajoy , that 's not a huge achievement . 
  then again , merkel would probably be better than any pm we 've had since suarez, 
  to be fair our constitutional court is extremely partisan and basically a tool for whoever is in charge of the government . 
  i `` d personally like a model like the us supreme court for us . 
  are n't many of those russians though ? 
  ( from say , the border with azerbaijan or from any part of russia that is definitely not in europe ), 
  19c here in las palmas , but of course we are yhe exception in terms of weather, 
  which part of spain ? 
  andalusia has a totally different weather compared to galicia for example , which is basically british weather . 
  on the flip side andalucia easily gets 40c summers . 
  yeah . 
  even here where there 's literally 0 anti eu movements , the eu is still used as a scapegoat for cuts and tax increases . 
  i do n't think we 've ever reached 7.6 % unemployment like , ever ( at least not since we have reliable statistics ) iirc we have always had at least 8 % unemployment , and that was at the peak of the 00s bubble . 
  funny how double digit unemployment is doomsday in some places while here it 's perfectly fine, 
  [ semi-relevant xkcd ] ( https://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/54/mars_netherlands.png ) source : https://what-if.xkcd.com/54/, 
  idk for europe in general , but at least in spain it 's definitely any year since like the late 80s or so .
