  probably with a cut off at 2008 for obvious reasons . 
  early 20th century saw the end of the restauraci\u00f3n regime , primo de rivera 's dictatorship and the 2nd republic ( good policy on principle , terrible execution ) then we got the civil war and franco ( late franco was n't * too * bad , but still an opressive dictatorship ) . 
  finally the early democracy was ok , but a bit heavy on crime and terrorism probably , hence why i start at the late 80s instead of the late 70s . 
  thanks to trump there 's no chance of ttip ever passing though . 
  alternatively could n't there be no controls between ni and ireland , placing them instead between the rest of the uk and ni ? 
  they 'd be less intrusive there anyways , as you need a passport to board the ship or plane anyways, 
  make britain great again ? 
  fortunately there 's no / r/spainman unlike florida  we still have plenty of weird news and traditions though, 
  what if it 's russia instead ? 
  well , the only real buyer for the canary islands is morocco , and yeah , i 'd rather move anywhere else in spain . 
  it 'd definitely be way much of a change , and almost certainly for the worse . 
  if we were sold to portugal , the only other reasonable buyer instead i could live with it though . 
  it does n't sound that bad . 
  we 'd be like the azores or madeira . 
  also , apparently it was kind of discussed during the spanish-american war whether the us should capture or not the islands ( ended up deciding against it ) . 
  again , i could live under us rule just fine . 
  thanks ! , fixed the link , 
  well , i could name tons just from our prime minister rajoy alone . 
  he seems to be extremely gaffe prone for some reason . 
  here are a few of them : * [ `` what we have done is to fool people '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odb63em2wpa ) * [ `` it 's the neighbours who elect the mayor , and it 's the mayor who wants the neigbours to be the mayor '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jdfwhv2j9c ) * [ `` eta is a great nation '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wargehnazso ) * [ spain is a great nation , and spaniards very spaniards and lots of spaniards ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdc2rfhxeps ) as for others , here 's former prime minister zapatero telling former russian president medevev they have made an agreement to fuck : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp0ntihxgdu or former prime minister aznar suddenly getting a texan accent after meeting with us president george w bush : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcapxtddoea, 
  for the most part franco 's dictatorship is seen as a mostly bad thing ( it was a repressive dictatorship after all ) with some positive lights thrown in ( the developlment of spanish industry in the 50s and tourism and fast development on the 60s ) . 
  no one would defend franco himself or most of the actions he took , especially early on though . 
  the civil war is still seen as a very traumatic event . 
  yeah ; i love [ this graph ] ( http://nortonbooks.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83534ac5b69e201b7c7dc7e86970b-800wi ) it really shows how one 's perception changes dependng on what you are used to xd i think another reason for high unemployment here is that many jobs do n't pay taxes to their employees , so the numbers are slightly inflated ( those people are unemployed but have jobs regardless ) . 
  not sure how much it affects the rate though . 
  currently i 'm mostly playing kerbal space program , with a bit of saints row 4 here and there . 
  yeah , same thing here , especially with chinese people . 
  they rarely do it officially though . 
  i had a friend which we all called by his spanish name , but all his paperwork only showed his chinese name . 
  to be fair , in most of europe ( or at least here in spain ) you can also fire a worker at any time . 
  it 's just that most of the time you must pay some kind of compensation . 
  there are 4 kinds of firing in spain : * proper or disciplinary firing : basically when the worker has done something wrong and he can be fired without compensation . 
  drug abuse , punching your boss or coworkers , stealing stuff from work , etc * nullified firing : just like in the us , you ca n't fire someone for discriminatory reasons . 
  that is called a nullified firing here , and the worker must normally be readmitted . 
  most common cases seem to be with pregnant women . 
  you ca n't fire pregnant women in spain . 
  there are other cases though , like being fired for going on strike or being fired for asking for a raise or an hours reduction . 
  * improper firing : assuming the firing does n't fall under the cases of nullified firings , you can fire a worker at any time for no reason in spain . 
  however , you must pay them a compensation fo 33 days of salary for every year they 've been at the company . 
  ( it used to be 45 days ) . 
  * objective firing : if your business is suffering losses and you need to fire people , you can still do so at any time , and while you 'll still need to pay a compensation , it will be much lower . 
  this time it 's only 20 days for every year at the business , with a limit of one year of salary ( improper firings do n't have limits for compensation ) i personally think this is a better system than `` at will '' ones as they protect the worker more . 
  unfortunately that causes many businesses to hire people as temporary workers instead of fixed ones ( temporary workers are much less protected , but can only be renewed for up to 2 years ) i think it might also raise our unemployment a bit , but i can live with that ( the lowest it 's ever been is 7.5 % or so ; something like 14 % unemployment is normal for spanish standards ) i think cs wants to give the system a big overhaul , while everyone else either just wants to keep it as is ( pp ) or return back to the older systems which had even more protections ( psoe wants to repeal only the 2012 reform from rajoy , podemos want to repeal both that one and zapatero 's 2010 one ), 
  do they get in trouble with `` antifa '' groups ? 
  the few far right movments we have here often do . 
  i have commented like 4 times in / r/altright so i guess yes :p ( and got banned for not being a nazi ) not in real life though . 
  there are some very few franco supporters , but most are very old and really not huge supporters , but kind of nostalgic ( this did n't happen under franco kind ), 
  i 'd say fernando vii was worse . 
  we had a pretty decent democracy for the times then , and we still had most of the spanish empire . 
  fernando vii lost all colonies minus cuba/puerto rico/the philippines , restored the absolute monarchy and set us back at least 100 years . 
  we 've been playing catch up ever since him . 
  carlos iv is also a good choice as he basically surrendered the country to napoleon . 
  yeah , our king also abdicated at the age of 76 , though that was because he was starting to get pretty unpopular because of some affairs he had ( like going to africa to hunt and breaking a bone ) while the prince was still seen as ok . 
  yeah , we also elected a king via parliament once ( amadeo i ) , but he ended up being a failure due to how politically unstable spain was . 
  he was followed by the 1st republic , which did n't even last a full year , before we returned to the borbons again . 
  by name and placing them on a map i think i know all of them ( thanks american redditors ! ) . 
  on stereotypes though , here are the ones i know : * hawaii - the classic hula girls with the flower necklaces and great beaches * washington/oregon - starbucks going hipsters * idaho - potato farmers ( the latvia of the us ? ), 
  * florida - / r/floridaman also retired people and exiled cubans . 
  * texas - people who love guns . 
  everything is bigger there . 
  america 's america . 
  * all states in the middle : flyover corn farms * utah - mormons, 
  it 's not . 
  instead norway is incredibly expensive, 
   2 ) six years after franco died and the king had inherited the country and pushed it into democracy , there was an attempt of coup by a general called tejero . 
  the attempt ( obviously ) failed in part thanks to the king supporting democracy instead of siding with the militars . 
  there has always been a conspiracy theory about the coup having been faked to instill the fear of a new dictatorship and raise support of the king as a democratic savior instead ; theories go from the coup being intentional to intelligence services knowing about it but keeping silent . 
  in defense of this conspiracy theory ( not like i 'm saying it 's true ) , it makes turkey 's recient badly made coup seem professional . 
  on the other hand though , tejero did manage to capture the pm ( both outgoing , suarez , and incoming , calvo sotelo ) ; and all mps , so \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af  3 ) among opponents of podemos , there are news and rumors about the party having started as an operation by the venezuelan government to influence spanish politics , similarly to how the alt right is claimed to be supported by russia . 
  you seem to be mostly right , though in this case some of podemos ' highest ranking members did work for ch\u00e1vez 's government once , and have defended him a lot in the past : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdlwsnm6fne, 
  here 's a picture of [ las palmas de gran canaria ] ( http://www.grancanaria.com/patronato_turismo/fileadmin/diseno2014/img/menu_izquierdo/cabeceras_estaticas/cabecera_lpgc.jpg ) from the air . 
  it shows off our awesome beach in the city centre :d, 
  yeah , even if the basque country became independent it would n't qualify as a microstate at all . 
  it 'd be pretty small , granted , but with 2.2 million people it 'd rank 23/29 , between slovenia and lithuania . 
  scaling to malta they should have 1 mep , as they have less than 1/10th of malta 's population . 
  as for other stuff , i guess in stuff that requires unanimity do n't give them a veto , and in the eu council give them a half-vote or something . 
   1 '25 - obsolete is it really obsolete though ? 
  i know lots of people who still write like that , especially in handwriting . 
  i 'm actually a first year engineering student at my local university , so this question is one i can answer personally anyways , at least in spain you do n't have any of those bullshit classes unrelated to your degree . 
  in my case as i 'm studying engineering all my subjects will be related to engineering ( physics , math , etc ; plus some a bit more related to the exact branch you are studying ) . 
  the only subject i 'll have that is n't really related to my degree is 1 semester of english ( as a foreign language ) . 
  that 's it . 
  if i studied medicine , i 'd only have chemistry , biology and the like ; and if i studied economics i 'd only have subjects related to the economy , math , etc also , the `` major '' system as it exists in the us does n't exist here . 
  you choose your degree right when you enter university and do n't really have any freedom in choosing your subjects ( you 'll normally choose from a set of pre-defined paths for years 3 and 4 , but even that is n't a given ) . 
  no studying generic stuff first then specializing ( if i understand correctly . ), 
  i guess this helps in making college in europe cheaper ? 
  we have quite expensive prices for european standards , and even here you 'll only pay 1200 $ per year or so . 
  ** tl ; dr : no , in europe , or at least in spain you just stick with your `` major '' 's subjects . 
  yes , if they want they should be able to join the eu if they fulfill all the criteria . 
  luxenbourg and malta could be considered microstates ( though admittedly much larger than san marino , with more than 10 times it 's population ) and yet they are part of the eu . 
  i guess some adjustments would be necessary though ( like say , giving them just 1 or 2 seats in the eu parliament as opposed to the minimum of 5 or 6 for example ), 
  yeah , here we got gand\u00eda shore and it was just as bad : /, 
  everything on telecinco here ( minus their news reports , they are somehow the most neutral ! ), 
  it belongs to mediaset , which is apparently owned by former italian pm silvio berlusconi . 
  for some reason i 'm not surprised : /, 
  apparently the catalonian ban was overturned by the constitutional court : https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/20/spanish-court-overturns-catalonia-bullfighting-ban somehow the canary islands ' ban is still in place though  .  i 'd personally give each region the freedom to decide whether they want to ban it outright ( like catalonia/canary islands ) , to not ban it but remove all public grants ( effectively almost killing it ) or to allow it . 
   what happens if the monarch dies with people in line for the throne but his wife is pregnant with a to-be heir ? 
  oh , this is something that has actually happened in spain before !, 
  :d in 1885 , the king of spain , alfonso xii unexpectedly died , while his wife was pregnant with their third son or daughter ( nobody knew then ) . 
  this is actually relevant as the first 2 had been women , so if the third had been a woman as well , the eldest sister would have inherited the throne .
