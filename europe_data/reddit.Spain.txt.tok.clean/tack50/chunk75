  to be fair , you do n't have anything on us :p here 's a map of all independentist movements in spain : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/separatismos_na_espanha.svg/300px-separatismos_na_espanha.svg.png granted many of them are jokes not unlike say , texit ( lol cantabrian independentism xd ) but 2 of them are very serious ( catalonia/basque country ) . 
  as for approval of politicians , i 'm pretty sure we 've never had a pm with a positive approval rating ever . 
  even now the only politician that barely manages to get positive approval is albert rivera , and only sometimes ( he usually is around a 5/10 ), 
  [ obvious troll is obvious ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4083/5055032357_69d1d1be72.jpg ), 
  yeah . 
  i 'm also not a huge fan of the other 2 designs ( cervantes/cathedral of santiago de compostela ) , but those are still better than the king . 
  other than a few people being detained for belonging to it , not much else . 
  the only islamic terrorist attack in spain thus far was the 2004 al qaeda madrid bombings . 
  i think our police has a lot more training against terrorism due to the fight against eta back on the day ? 
  since someone from my country already posted most of the international stuff , i guess i 'll post my national and local wishes : * the cc regional government in the canary islands to finally be ousted ( probably not , but a man can dream ) * unemployment and debt to go down * the government to stop stealing money from the pension 's piggybank ( yes that 's the real name xd ) * no terrorism, 
  it is generally thought that rural people here are more conservative and stuff , but at least electorally the more important variable is region by far , not urban/rural take for instance the map of the 2016 election : http://www.elmundo.es/grafico/espana/2016/06/27/57709ec1e5fdea870f8b4618.html you can reach a lot of conclusions from that map , depending on the region you choose : * in southern spain ( andalusia + extremadura ) , rural areas vote for the centre-left psoe , urban areas vote for the conservative pp ( just look at seville province ; the only place that went for the pp was the city of seville itself plus it 's surroundings for the most part ) . 
  * in catalonia urban areas vote for the leftist and ambiguous in independence podemos while rural areas vote for openly pro independence parties ( erc+c iu ) * in most of the country there is n't really a correlation between the places that vote for the centre left psoe and the conservative pp * the only real difference in most of the country is that podemos is only really sucessful in urban areas, 
  though it seems weird , it does snow sometimes in the canary islands !, 
  we usually get one snow blizzard every 2 years or so . 
  apparently the last time it snowed in my island ( gran canaria ) was this february : http://www.laprovincia.es/multimedia/fotos/gran-canaria/2016-02-19-41052-nieve-cumbre-gran-canaria.html it obviously only snows in the mountains though ( about 20 or 30 km away from me ) . 
  it does n't snow exactly where i live ( almost at sea level lol ), 
  i assume you both speak english ( otherwise how are you speaking to each other xd ) anyways , i think dublin could be fine ? 
  they speak english so that 's not a problem , and iirc the jobs there are fine . 
  also the uk is a nice option . 
  of the 3 you posted , berlin seems to me like the best choice . 
  well , i guess the closest thing is the basque country here . 
  they definitely have the `` everything is bigger in the basque country stereotype '' ( especially in bilbao for some reason xd ) . 
  the `` do n't mess with them '' is not really the first thing that comes to mind , but it 's probably true . 
  interestingly , it 's actually one of the regions with what we call `` dual voting '' . 
  they are moderately leftist in national elections ( they voted for podemos last time ) but quite conservative at the local level . 
  ( the right wing nationalist pnv has ruled for all but 4 years there ), 
  depends on which part of the far-right ( other than anti-inmigrant and anti-eu rethoric , there 's variety in most other issues ) i think some of the far-right ( the french front national ) is pretty happy with the french welfare state ( they just want to remove it for inmigrants , but the native french would keep it ) . 
  if you equate us republicans with trump , then some in the far-right ( like the british ukip ) are actually very pro free trade . 
  in fact , iirc during the brexit referendum one of their main arguments for brexit was free trade , saying that the eu was a protectionist block . 
  i live with my parents : / ( 18 year old , completely normal though ) . 
  to be fair , most of my inmediate family lives in the canary islands as well . 
  only one family member and his family does n't, 
  that 'd trigger the portuguese maybe castille ? 
  that 'd trigger catalonia/basque country no idea, 
  probably only the 2nd ( guns ) . 
  everything else seems reasonable . 
  error 404 : file not found basically too small to be relevant . 
  the largest one seems to be vox , which got like 0.1 % on the last election . 
  unless of coursr you want to count the mainstream right ( pp ) . 
  they are currently in government and got 33 % of the vote , and 137/350 seats, 
  it 's mostly criticism of the eu 's austerity policies what people do n't like here , not the eu itself . 
  we passed the eu constitution by like 75-25, 
  i guess the us could have just given independence to the confederacy ? 
  the us were probably pretty fractured at the time , and the borders mostly there . 
  yeah , probably slightly more popular now , thouhh it has also decreased its popularity for the same reasons, 
  yeah , kind of reminds me of us with alonso . 
  until he became good , f1 was pretty minoritarian . 
  when he got good everyone started watching it , and it had pretty good ratings until this year , when it moved to paid cable tv instead of free ota tv , where it used to air . 
  probably basketball , though after football it gets pretty minoritarian , especially for watching it on tv, 
  maybe the flag of the first spanish republic would work well enough ? 
  https://marcopolito56.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/pabellc3b3n_usado_durante_la_primera_repc3bablica_espac3b1ola.png i personally prefer it much more to that of the 2nd republic, 
  at least here in spain you only get the nationality by being born here if : * none of your parents are spanish , but at least one of them was born here * you do n't have a nationality for whatever reason, 
   spain ( one of the only one to really not have anything like it ) for all what 's worth , our nationality law goes like this . 
  people who acquire the spanish nationality at birth are : * those born from a spanish father or mother * those born from foreign parents in spain , if at least one of their parents was born in spain as well, 
  i guess it 's because after a certain generation ( great grand parents probably ) it does n't really matter . 
  we already pay almost scandinavian level taxes though :( http://www.agenciatributaria.es/aeat.internet/inicio/la_agencia_tributaria/campanas/_campanas_/impuesto_sobre_la_renta_de_las_personas_fisicas__irpf_/_informacion/reforma_renta_2015/tipos_y_escalas_de_gravamen/escala_general_a_aplicar_a_partir_del_ejercicio_2016.shtml add to that a 21 % vat ( thankfully 7 % here in the canary islands , at the cost of making buying on something like amazon not worth it at all ), 
  yeah . 
  kind of reminds me of the arguments i read when both we and some place in the us ( california ? 
  maybe the us as a whole ? ), 
  were both building high speed rail lines . 
  in the us most people were opposed to it as they thought the lines were going to be deficitary and they generally thought of it as a waste of money ( even though the project was viable ) meanwhile in spain villages all across the country fight to have a high speed train station ( even if it makes no sense ) , because `` that money was going to be spent anyways , we might as well spend it here '' . 
  in fact that 's probably one of the reasons most `` states '' here have some sort of nationalist party ( i think only madrid , la rioja and castille-la mancha do n't have one . 
  that 's 3/17 ), 
  making the nuts-1 divisions into states can backfire spectacularly depending on the country . 
  here they make no sense whatsoever for example : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/nuts_es7.png now compare that to our map of `` states '' ( nuts 2 ) http://www.cma.gva.es/areas/estado/bosques/bosq/inventario_forestal/_imagenes/nuevo_mapa_sup_forestal_com.jpg, 
  most catalan independentist parties say they feel catalan and european . 
  the ones opposed to independence say they feel catalan , spanish and european . 
  just take a look at one of ciudadanos ' campaign logos : http://estaticos.elperiodico.com/resources/jpg/3/2/lider-ciudadanos-albert-rivera-cabeza-lista-ciutadans-para-las-autonomicas-catalunya-ines-arrimadas-1440413620523.jpg it 's not that complicated, 
  that 's a huge if , and if they were to unite they might as well do it to improve their home countries . 
  yeah , i meant northwest xd, 
  actually , no xd, 
  yeah , china and india both have like 5 times the population of europe , and the us and russia could make europe resemble the location of a fallout game in seconds . 
  so what ? 
  none of thatis going to happen . 
  shield the middle east with a 100 % impenetrable and indestructible bubble . 
  the problem is unsolvable , the best thing we can do is trap them there until they either stop killing each other volutarily or there 's only one man standing . 
  se\u00f1or ( for men ) . 
  se\u00f1ora ( for married women ) se\u00f1orita ( for unmarried women ) those are the spanish equivalents to mr. ; mrs. and ms respectively . 
  you can also use the form usted instead of t\u00fa as well ( 2 different ways to say you ), 
  i personally do n't really like it . 
  it 's not that often though , it only happens like 10 % of the time, 
  fun fact : spain is actually the country with the largest amount of elevators per capita , thanks to us living mostly in flats instead of houses : http://qz.com/273214/how-spains-bloody-history-gave-it-the-worlds-highest-concentration-of-elevators/, 
  well , there are various divisions you can make in spain . 
  * a north/south division ( draw a horizontal line that goes through madrid ) * a 4 way division . 
  here the categories probably are the south ( andalucia , extremadura , murcia and the canary islands ) , the interior/castille ( castille-leon , madrid , castille-la mancha ; maybe aragon as well . 
  basically the landlocked communities ) , the mediterranean coast ( catalonia , valencian community , balearic islands . 
  maybe murcia or aragon as well ) and the northwest/cantabric coast ( galicia , asturias , cantabria , basque country and navarre ), 
  so portuguese people have 4 surnames ? 
  til, 
   which surname do your future kids get ? 
  you can change this nowadays , but by default , your kids first surname is your husband 's first surname and your kids second surname is your first surname ( this has the consequence of your surname dying out in 2 generations , as your grandchildren wo n't get your surname but that 's still better than the usual 1 ) for example if you are called maria martinez fernandez and your husband is called luis suarez garc\u00eda ( totally finnish names ) , your children will be called ( whatever ) suarez martinez . 
  sure , but is n't that a recient development , and not all that common ? 
  if you want you can also swap your surnames order here as well ( which is the equivalent , sort of ), 
  to be fair , you ca n't sell alcohol in supermarkets and the like from 22:00 to 08:00 here as well . 
  pubs and the like are excluded from this regulation obviously though ( though they can sometimes be expensive ), 
  i never said they were good though , i just said they were the most famous/best known . 
  invade turkey declaring war to both sides , they will unite against the invader . 
  poof , civil war ended ( either that or it 's a 5 way clusterfuck like syria , in which case , no idea ), 
  so , who else would you pick ? 
  here 's a quote from otto von bismark on that topic :  i 'm firmly convinced that spain is the strongest country in the world .
