  yeah , that plus the hitler `` downfall '' parodies and the famous `` angry german kid '', 
  closest thing has been the 2 times i played paintball with my friends , where the instructors gave us some paintball rifles . 
  outside of that , no . 
  is n't it also illegal to die there ? 
  drinking alcohol in the street is illegal here . 
  to drink you must either be in a bar , or drink at someone 's place . 
  of course , that does n't stop people from doing so regardless ( the infamous bottell\u00f3n ) . 
  my town hall did say that they were going to get tough now that a 12 year old girl died from alcohol poisoning in madrid though , and apparently there 's more police than before in the usual botell\u00f3n places . 
  the most famous website here seems to be www.idealista.com it also works if you are trying to buy a house . 
  i guess that varies from country to country . 
  it 's not that rare for the cashier here to help you pack up your things , especially when you are buying a lot . 
  ( no one will help you for 1 or 2 bags ), 
  definitely the philippines , mostly because they were part of spain until 1898 ( just like cuba , puerto rico and a couple islands in the pacific ocean ) . 
  the spanish influence is much less present than in cuba/puerto rico though . 
  filipinos do n't speak spanish anymore ( though the influence can still be seen in some names and loanwords ) , and spain did n't care as much for the philippines as for the other 2 . 
  oh , yeah , forgot about that . 
  imo ideally we should have 2 referendums . 
  one first to reform the constitution and make spain a federal state on paper ( as opposed to now , where it 's only de facto federal ) and set up how a community would leave ( i personally think 3/5 of their state assembly ; just like to reform the constitution , and 55 % on their referendum like montenegro should be fine ) . 
  in this one everyone should vote . 
  then a second referendum restricted to whoever asked for independence . 
  if we must insist on 1 referendum i feel like all of spain should vote , but it will be non-binding regardless ( it goes against the constitution ) . 
  there 's no one with a view similar to mine i think . 
  closest thing is podemos i guess , which defends that catalonia has the right to have a referendum , but seeing how they ca n't pass a constitutional reform changing article 2 ( forbids communities from seceding ) , it will probably have to be non-binding so it 's basically an elaborate poll . 
  they are also in favour of constitutional reform . 
  the psoe defends a federal spain but does not accept independence . 
  everyone else is radically opposed to it . 
  anyways , for us it 's probably : * susana diaz : governor of andalucia . 
  well known for being involved in deposing former psoe leader pedro s\u00e1nchez and currently trying to become the new leader ( running against the deposed leader for now ) * carles puigdemont : governor of catalonia . 
  i think this one is obvious . 
  * miguel \u00c1ngel revilla : governor of cantabria . 
  best known for appearing often in tv and being very populist . 
  he is probably the closest thing to a spanish trump/berlusconi in that aspect . 
  * manuela carmena : mayor of madrid . 
  known for being one of the 2 mayors of podemos in major cities . 
  * ada colau : mayor of barcelona . 
  see the above . 
  * javier fernandez : governor of asturias . 
  best known for leading the temporary commision of the psoe . 
  spain : and no , no way . 
  the government will steal from us and deceive us no matter who is in charge . 
  seriously , out of all elected politicians ( mayor , island governor , autonomous community governor and prime minister ) i only like 1 ( the island governor ) . 
  our mayor is incompetent , our autonomous community governor is corrupt and our prime minister is both :(, 
  ok , this is in las palmas de gran canaria ( canary islands ) , located on the northeast of the island . 
  basically the weather will stay at a constant temperature between like 18c at least and 32 c at most , with very few exceptions . 
  ( towards the hotter half in summer and the colder half in winter ) . 
  it rains sometimes in september-april , and rarely outside of that . 
  that 's some awesome weather we have here :d in other places of the island , weather varies . 
  the rural mountains are cooler ( can get down to low single digits in cold winter days ) . 
  the southern half of the island ( where all the tourists go ) has less rain and is overall usually around 4-5c hotter and usually less cloudy . 
  here 's the wikipedia article about the climate here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/las_palmas#climate, 
  wait , what were the arguments against it ? 
  why would n't wales want more autonomy ? 
  i get vatican city ( though considering it 's size i wonder how independent it truly is ) , but why did n't san marino join the rest of italy when it unified ? 
  hell , why did n't italy try to conquer it ? 
  it 's not like andorra or lichtenstein which have neighbours that could help . 
  yeah . 
  that also makes andorra probably the only elected monarchy in the world , elected by citizens of another country no less . 
  probably renzi . 
  he seems like a good pm to me . 
  either him or whoever is in charge in romania ( iirc he 's doing a good job ) then again , it 's easier for me to name the ones i would not vote for : * hollande ( france ) * rajoy ( spain ) * may ( uk ) * orban ( hungary ) * whoever is in charge in poland atm ( apparently a woman named beata szyd\u0142o , but iirc polish redditors say she 's a puppet from someone else ) * tsipras ( greece ) * merkel ( germany ) then again , this is expected . 
  if i did the same for my country ( vote for one of our 17 governors ) , i 'd probably have to vote for the governor of the balearic islands , and i barely know anything about her , other than that she is a woman from the more left wing part of the psoe . 
  again , i 'd have more people i would never vote for than the opposite . 
  yeah , i could see myself vote for him non ironically ( after all i did vote for his party 's equivalent here in 2016 ) , but i definitely would n't vote for say , merkel . 
  ( not like she 's bad ; she just is n't the kind of politician i like . 
  i 'm more of a leftist ), 
  i guess we could use an electoral college then . 
  that worked great for the us i 'm told ^ / s, 
  yeah , i ca n't see rajoy getting more than 40 % of spanish votes and even that 's a huge stretch, 
  i guess to make it more interesting you should n't be able to vote for your own country 's pm though i 'll admit reading on that dacian guy has definitely sold me on him, 
   always present hypothetical referendum over the independence of catalunya not hypothetical anymore :p https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/proceso_participativo_sobre_el_futuro_pol%c3%adtico_de_catalu%c3%b1a_de_2014 though that was boycotted by almost everyone . 
  well , we 've only had 4 nation wide referendums since franco died in 1975 , so here they are : * [ 1976 referendum on political reform ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_political_reform_referendum,_1976 ) : while franco was dead , spain was still a dictatorship at the time for the most part . 
  this basically made spain a democracy . 
  the campaign and everything else were extremely lame though . 
  * [ 1978 referendum on the constitution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_constitutional_referendum,_1978 ) : slightly more interesting than the one on political reform , it still saw overwhelming approval rates and a lame campaign , with only extremist parties and catalan/basque independentists not approving it . 
  it does have 2 interesting facts though . 
  1 is that ap ( the modern day pp , currently in government ) saw high rates of defection of approval of the constitution ( iirc only 60 % of their mps voted for the constitution to pass ) . 
  2nd is that the basque country saw relatively low approval ( around 70 % compared to the national 90 % ) , which is often used by independentists to defend that they did n't approve the constitution , that they are different , etc * [ 1986 nato exit referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_nato_membership_referendum,_1986 ) : thus far the most competitive ( only a 17 point win , for remain ) and the most constroversial to date . 
  the psoe and incumbent prime minister felipe gonzalez ( loved at the time ) , who had defended not entering nato and called for a referendum , kept his promise and scheduled one , but campaigned for staying . 
  the pro-nato ap ( modern day pp ; current pm rajoy 's party ) refused to campaign , and called for boycotting the referendum and/or voting blank . 
  the leave campaign was led by the communist party , and joined by some other regional parties . 
  felipe gonzalez threatened with resigning if he did n't win , which was the decisive factor in us remaining in nato ( he was untouchable at the time ) . 
  to this day he regrets having held that referendum . 
  again , this referendum is sometimes used by independentists/nationalists , as 4 regions ( canary islands , catalonia , navarra , basque country ) voted for leave while everyone else voted for remain * [ 2005 european constitution referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_european_constitution_referendum,_2005 ) : the most pointless one , but it was not our fault that it led to nowhere . 
  again , most mainstream parties campaigned for yes , while the far left united left and various regional parties campaigned for no . 
  the most interesting fact is that in order to promote the referendum the government sent a copy of the new eu constitution with sunday newspapers or something like that ( there 's a copy at my home ) . 
  also , it passed 82-18 , but turnout was abysmal ( 42 % ) . 
  apparently no one cared . 
  imo it goes something like this : 1986  1978  2005  1976, 
  to be fair , i personally find the [ nato one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_nato_membership_referendum,_1986 ) much more interesting . 
  it was basically the closest thing we 'll have to the uk 's brexit xd . 
  it also features [ one of the largest position changes ] ( https://manuescrig.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/otan-de-entrada-no1.jpg ) in spanish history , done by the psoe and felipe gonzalez . 
  not like there 's much more competition . 
  the [ constitution one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_constitutional_referendum,_1978 ) is interesting , but was approved almost unanimously , which is kind of lame . 
  same but multiplied by 10 goes for the [ 1976 one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_political_reform_referendum,_1976 ) for political reform . 
  i 'm pretty sure the referendums done under franco should not count , and are too old anyways . 
  finally , there 's the [ 2005 eu constution referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_european_constitution_referendum,_2005 ) , which is interesting since we were one of only 2 countries to have it pass via referendum ( the other was luxenbourg ) . 
  however , no one cared , and turnout was abysmal . 
  plus , it was pointless in the end, 
  it varies from country to country . 
  i think no politician here is seriously discussing immigration here , but germany for example probably has a whole different attitude .
