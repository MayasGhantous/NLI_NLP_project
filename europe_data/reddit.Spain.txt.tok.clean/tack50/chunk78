  our time when immigration was actually an issue was during the 00s . 
  if he had a gun , he 'd most likely be facing a lot of policemen . 
  he would not be shot unless he shot first though , especially if he was not pointing at the police officers, 
  well , [ here it is ] ( http://www.canarias7.es/articulo.cfm?id=443817 ) woman investigated for hitting her dog with a stick in her home, 
  do n't all 3 already exist in some way or another already though ? 
  the eu signs treaties on behalf of it 's member states many times ( see ceta , and probably also the paris agreement ) . 
  the eu also has a clause similar to nato article 5 in it somewhere iirc ( ie if say , finland , an eu but not nato member is attacked , the entire eu has to respond , but not the us/canada ) . 
  as for taxes , has n't the eu put some taxes on stuff that is n't really seen by the common citizen ? 
  ( iirc something having to do with financial transactions ), 
  to be fair , in spanish we use the same word for plurality and majority ( mayor\u00eda ) if you need to specify , there 's absolute majority ( 50 % +1 ) and relative/simple majority ( most votes , even if it 's under 50 % ), 
  you are totally right in point 3 , and kind of right in point 1 ( china and india work fine with higher populations than the eu . 
  well , as good as china and india can work at least ) point 2 i feel is less of a problem with the eu itself than with the people not knowing what it does ( we elect an eu parliament after all ) . 
  in any case , it 's easily fixable . 
   also trends from both the eu and usa suggest that something that starts as a federal system on that scale will tend towards something which increasingly centralises power . 
  this is something that is not set in stone though . 
  a very centralized system can also evolve into a federal one . 
  spain became a centralized country officially in 1714 . 
  however , over the course of the 19th , 20th and 21st centuries there have been various attempts at devolution and federalism ( from the first republic , based on federalism ; to today 's `` unitary '' spain with autonomous communities , a federation in all but name ) . 
  the trend could reverse itself if people wanted it . 
  to be fair , the only places i 've found with unisex toilets are very small bars/restaurants which ca n't fit more than one cubicle . 
  if then can , they 'll always try to have 2 ( one for men and one for women ) , even if there 's a common shared area . 
  piedra papel tijeras , basically meaning rock , paper , scissors, 
  yeah , for one of the larger countries in europe , spain is very underrepresented ( just look at / r/es and / r/spain both of which are mostly dead , and it 's the english speaking / r/spain the one that gets the most traffic ) i 'd say that 's because most spaniards ca n't speak english well so they just stick with spanish speaking places ( meneame , burbuja.info , forocoches , mediavida , etc ), 
  probably the argentinian dialect is the most appealing accent for spaniards . 
  yeah . 
  iirc polls were giving them a chance in the december 2015 elections , but we all know what happened . 
  only chance i see them getting a government with that policy is if they can somehow get most of the anti-independence vote in catalonia and get a cs + pp coalition government led by them ( maybe supported by the psoe ) , but i 'm not even sure there 's enough anti-independence people to get such a government . 
  outside of that , i have no idea of where they could get a government . 
  ok , from the far left to the far right , here are some of the measures they wanted in the december 2015 election ( last one was june 2016 , but i could n't find a summed up version of that ) : ** podemos ( left ) ** * some kind of basic last resort salary for unemployed people . 
  also increase the minimum wage . 
  * they 'll put a plan to forbid or delay ousting people who ca n't pay their morgage from their houses , making it easier to renegotiatie their debts * they want to renegotiate spain 's debt * lower the retirement age to 63 years * do a full reform of the constitution from the ground up * repeal both rajoy 's 2012 and zapatero 's 2010 labour reforms ** psoe ( centre-left ) ** * reinforce spain 's non-religious character , like for example making the catholic church pay property taxes for their churches . 
  * repeal rajoy 's 2012 labour reform , but not zapatero 's 2010 one * reform the constitution , but they are less ambitious and more ambiguous than podemos * repeal the `` gag law '' * return the healthcare attention for undocumented inmigrants ** ciudadanos ( centre-right ) ** * repeal both labour reforms , but expecially change spain 's dual hiring ( temporary and indefinite ) with a single labour contract with growning indemnizations for firing workers * repeal some points of the `` gag law '' * they do n't want to give medical assistance to undocumented inmigrants other than for emergencies * reduce taxes for self-employed people * lower the retirement age to 65 years * they also have a strict policy of never entering a government that they do n't lead ( ie , no ciudadanos ministers without a cs president ) ** pp ( right ) ** * they wo n't repeal any labour reforms * they are in favour of the `` gag law '' * they want to reform the electoral law , so that the most voted party is the one that gets the presidency/mayor/governor / whatever ( in many places they won the election but were ousted by left wing coalitions , which they called `` losers coalitions '' ) * they will return medical assistance to inmigrants , but wo n't give them a healthcare card * they want to lower taxes oddly enough in most controversial topics in europe they all agree ( with maybe some differences ) . 
  they are all more or less pro-inmigration . 
  podemos is the most radical by far here ( they want to remove the border fences spikes in ceuta/melilla , eliminate or reform temporarty stay centres for undocumented inmigrants and ban returning inmigrants just as they arrive ) but they all agree here more or less . 
  similarly , all parties are pro eu and pro nato ( though some people in podemos are against nato , probably a holdover from the old united left with which they fused , which was anti nato and not enthusiastic about the eu ), 
  heh , here it 's not just required to have it , but you also need to have it with you at all times . 
  otherwise if the police for sone reason needs to identify you ( rare , but can happen ) , you 'll be taken to the nearest police station to do so . 
  sure , but europe does not exist in a vacuum . 
  for anything outside europe it 's definitely the 2nd best ( slightly above french , significantly under english and way above german ), 
  well , why ? 
  spanish is the second more useful language outside europe , so at the very least i 'd put it tied with german and only behind french for the eu, 
  is n't there also a / r/junker ? 
  imo it should be 3rd or 4th after english ( even if the uk leaves it 's going nowhere ) , german and french . 
  german is more useful inside the eu , spanish more useful outside ( french is only slightly behind spanish for that and also more useful inside europe ), 
  according to [ this page ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/motor/rankings/20160905/4166640254/coches-mas-vendidos-espana-agosto-2016.html ) , the 5 most sold cars in spain are in order : seat leon , volkswagen golf , dacia sandero , opel corsa and seat ibiza it does n't surprise me at all . 
  most cars you see on the streets are seats ( mostly ibizas ) , volkswagens ( golfs and polos ) and a couple from other brands , mostly renault , ford , toyota and dacia, 
  do n't forget the reggaeton . 
  if he goes to spain , that 's the only music he 'll hear when going to clubs . 
  probably the end of ww2, 
  well , you would be right in like the 70s , but spain has become very liberal very fast . 
  we were the third country to legalize gay marriage for example ( 2005 , beaten by only belgium and the netherlands iirc ) . 
  on the flip side , we did n't have legal abortions until 2010 ( mid 80s if you want to count the law that while it made abortion illegal except under certain circumstances , the `` danger to the mother '' clause had a huge loophole ) and the `` ruled by conservatives '' is n't really all that true . 
  sure , franco was very socially conservative ( though he acutally passed very leftist economic stuff when he was in power !, 
  ) , but he was a dictator . 
  after that the only times conservatives have ruled was with aznar ( 1996-2004 ) and rajoy ( 2011-present ) . 
  the 1977-1982 we had a centrist government ( on paper at least , they were more centre-right ) and all other years we 've had socialists in power . 
  * economically liberal in the us sense ( ie leftist ) : probably some of the richer ones like germany or france * economically liberal in the european sense ( closer to free market ) : according to [ this ] ( http://www.heritage.org/index/ranking ) switzerland , ireland , estonia and the uk , in that order * socially liberal : definitely the netherlands , with spain coming in second, 
  if we did n't suspend our elections when a terrorist attack happened literally 3 days before them , we probably never will . 
  it was in the cards , but the government decided against it as it would be seen as surrendering to terrorism imagine 9/11 happening right before an election . 
  that 's what happened here ( albeit with thankfully only 10 % of the casualties ), 
  to be fair , the 2nd republic never suspended elections . 
  or are you trying to compare that to primo de rivera 's coup , which did suspend elections while technically keeping the restauracion regime intact ? 
  ( admittedly much closer , but his dictatorship only lasted for 8 years ), 
  normally how you write it ( in spanish the pronunciation is very easy to get from the spelling , as 1 letter is always 1 sound ) anyways , normally i 'd pronounce it mac-donald 's sometimes when talking fast i might pronounce it mad-donald 's though, 
  definitely portugal . 
  it 's probably the cheapest western european country if you consider it like that ( you ca n't get much more western than portugal , but many would consider it in a separate southern europe category ) if you want to exclude southern europe , then i do n't know . 
  i guess a small town in france ? 
  not really . 
  * maybe * greece should have been kicked out of the euro in 2014 ( the euro , not the eu ) , but even that 's a stretch . 
  poland and hungary also are n't the most pro-eu countries , but i can get behind some of the policy decisions the eu dislikes ( especially border fences . 
  whoever thought letting millions of people in without control was a good idea deserves to go to jail ), 
  basically how things that are very common in europe are seen as impossible in the us because `` we are different '' take single-payer healthcare for example . 
  in the us it 's seen as impossible and way too expensive . 
  however , if only rich places can afford it , then how come spain have it , with a gdp per capita lower than any other state ( lower than even mississippi ) ? 
  or the uk , poorer than 42 of the 50 states ? 
  ( on par with kentucky ), 
  yeah , mostly podemos in spain . 
  yeah , spain and portugal mostly free of far-right politicians . 
  we do have left wing populists though ( i think their us equivalent would be someone like sanders ? 
  they sure love him on twitter ), 
  pretty much . 
  they are close to the american republicans ( albeit to the left of them ) . 
  they have everything from neo-liberals/pseudo-libertarians ( thinking of former governor of madrid esperanza aguirre ) to conservative catholics ( like former minister of the interior jorge fernandez diaz ) for reference , the far right in spain only managed to get seats once ; after the 1979 election , and even then it was only 1 seat . 
  currently i think the largest far-right parties are at either 0.2 % ( vox ) and 0.04 % ( falange ; literally franco 's party ), 
  i 'm 18 , and without a girlfriend , so obviously no . 
  i guess i 'll marry in the far future , but that 's so far away i 've got tons of other things to worry about first . 
  from memory , i think a 1,5 litre bottle costs like 1.2 $ and a 0.5 l one costs 0.8 $ ? 
  traditionally ( ie before last year ) , leftist areas were the ones where the nationalists were ( basque country and especially catalonia , which used to be a socialist stronghold ) and the southern half of the country ( andalucia , extremadura and to a lesser extent castille-la mancha ) , where the left was competitive in rural areas ( remember this is the old centrist psoe , not the new , more radical podemos ) . 
  the conservative strongholds were the northwestern part of the country ( minus asturias and leon ) and the south east ( valencia/murcia ) for reference here 's the [ 2008 map ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7xjfygadm8q/trr_dhegjli/aaaaaaaaama/lugf2fhml7e/s1600/mapa+espa%25c3%25b1a+resultados+2008+por+municipio.png ) ( last socialist victory ) . 
  and here it is at the larger [ constituency level ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/elecciones_generales_de_espa%c3%b1a_de_2008#/media/file:spainprovincemapg2008.png ) finally , our `` swing states '' were the canary islands , aragon , asturias and the balearic islands for the most part , though no fptp means it 's not that much better to campaign there . 
  aragon has been a great bellweather though , predicting the winner of the election all times ( iirc it 's compared to ohio in the us ), 
  no idea , we moved here when i was like 5 years old , so early 00s at the newest . 
  most likely early 90s or so . 
  well , we do have a rural/urban divide . 
  it 's quite noticeable , especially since spain is pretty sparsely populated , especially in the center ( excluding madrid ) . 
  in general i 'd say rural areas are more conservative , more religious and skew older , but i 'd say that 's pretty much it . 
  however , the divide does n't show up much in politics as it does in the us , due to several reasons : * us conservatives are n't very competitive in cities if i understand correctly . 
  spanish conservatives are . 
  the pp held the mayor of madrid for 20 years in a row , and still has control over their state government . 
  the new spanish left is not competitive on rural areas though , just like their us counterparts ( though the old centre-left is very competitive in the rural spanish south : andalusia and extremadura ) * very often the capital of a province ( our constituencies ) can dominate the province by a too large margin for the countryside to compensate ( though that often happens in low population provinces , so even the capital feels rural ) .
