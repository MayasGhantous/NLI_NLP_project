  * even in the middle of the spanish countryside , you are never that far away from a big city . 
  let 's take , say , [ this place ] ( https://www.google.es/maps/place/13110+horcajo+de+los+montes,+cdad.+real/@39.3273019,-4.6553553,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd6ae6a3ef051e17:0x7b3409d8d2353e31!8m2!3d39.3278369!4d-4.648912 ) located in the middle of nowhere in the border between extremadura and castille-la mancha . 
  even from there , toledo ( capital of the state ) is only 100 km away ; ciudad real ( capital of the province ) is even closer ( 82 km ) . 
  hell , madrid is only 180 km away !, 
  let 's do the same for the us . 
  [ random town ] ( https://www.google.es/maps/dir//kaycee,+wyoming+82639,+ee.+uu./@43.7091952,-106.6465363,15z/data=!4m16!1m7!3m6!1s0x875fefd2e73e5047:0x17f862be4c65bace!2skaycee,+wyoming+82639,+ee.+uu . 
  ! 3b1 ! 8m2 ! 3d43 .7102497 ! 4d-106 .6389334 ! 4m7 ! 1m0 ! 1m5 ! 1m1 ! 1s0x875fefd2e73e5047 :0 x17f862be4c65bace ! 2m2 ! 1d-106 .6389338 ! 2d43 .7102499 ) in wyoming . 
  the capital of the state is 400 km away . 
  hell , the closest large city ( that i can find ) , denver , is 550 km away !, 
  [ here 's ] ( http://estaticos.lab.eldiario.es/estaticos/elecciones/analisis/ganador-small.png ) our election map for the 2015 election . 
  keep in mind the basque country and catalonia have their own nationalist parties ( where dark green/dark blue = right wing nationalists and yellow / light green = left wing nationalists ) . 
  everywhere else , from right leaning to left leaning : blue-orange-red-purple, 
  probably anything having to do with catalonia 's independence movement, 
  no idea about living people , but for new babies : hugo for boys ( hugues ? ), 
  lucia for women ( lucy ? ), 
  for surnames the 2 most common are garcia and gonzalez respectively . 
  so , aparently the average spaniard is called hugo garcia gonzalez or lucia garcia gonzalez, 
  presidents ? 
  no way . 
  i think joachim gauck is the president of germany , but that 's it . 
  if you extend that to prime ministers i can name many more . 
  wait , who opposes deportations of illegal inmigrants who commit crimes ? 
  i personally am in favour of deportations , but against stupid inmigration policies ( * cough * `` build a wall and make someone else pay for it '' * cough * ), 
  damn , 82-18 !, 
  but that was a centre-right party against a far right one , so the left probably went with the centre-right if it 's , say , hollande ( or whoever the socialists nominate ) against le pen , would n't that split the vote of the centre-right ? 
  or does the centre-right hate the national front more than they hate the left ? 
  or any of our prime ministrers for that matter, 
  same as i think for catalonia . 
  allow them to have a referendum but us wide . 
  if californians want to leave and the rest of the country agrees to open the door , then allow them to leave, 
  well , probably because most prime ministers in europe are elected exactly like that . 
  also , junker won the popular vote . 
  trump and w bush did not . 
  no , it 's not . 
  at least here you are required to have at least a b1 level on a foreign language , but an erasmus is not mandatory at all . 
  to be fair , other than in some websites here , i 'd say spain is also mostly free from putin fans, 
  basque . 
  it 's not even a contest . 
  literally unrelated to any other language in the world . 
  they should n't happen . 
  trump won , fairly albeit under a terrible election system , but it 's not like we have n't seen similar things happen [ over here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canarian_parliamentary_election,_2015 ) , where the party in third got the most seats !, 
  however , there was only a protest to change the electoral system for the next election , not the outcome , and the party who won the popular vote agreed to be the junior coalition member . 
  ok , 95 % of our ballots ( basically everything except our useless senate ) look like [ this ] ( http://prc.es/archivosbd/agrupaciones_noticias_galeria/0751f5ba9288a801e05786071fa694cd.jpg ) this example is from a nationalist party in the constituency of cantabria for the 2011 general election . 
  larger constituencies have larger ballots to have all the candidates ' names . 
  the senate is a bit different . 
  ballots look like [ this ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0v8vzbffxxo/vmhoxzeqwui/aaaaaaaabxs/9atowfmvmpg/s1600/senado.jpg ) instead ( this one is from the 2015 election in the constituency of murcia ) in them you normally ( the islands and ceuta/melilla work under slightly different rules ) have to pick 3 candidates , which can be from different parties ( though 99 % of people vote a straight ticket ) , and 4 senators per constituency are elected with the first 4 senators being elected . 
  this is fptp , but with an small price for the runner-up ( 3-1 instead of 4-0 ) in the off chance that we get a referendum ( only 2 have been called since the constitution was passed in 1978 : one for the eu constitution which succeeded but failed eu-wide and one for leaving nato which failed outright ) ballots look like [ this ] ( http://cloud10.todocoleccion.online/carteles-politico/tc/2015/11/10/01/52643596.jpg ) . 
  we also have [ ballots for voting blank/abstaining ] ( http://cloud10.todocoleccion.online/documentos-antiguos/tc/2013/08/19/escanear0057.jpg ), 
  approximately 1,10 $ for the large packages , and 40 cts for the small ones . 
  that 's for stuff like lays and the like . 
  off brand cheap stuff costs approximately half of that ( though they usually only sell large packets ), 
  tbh , i 've always found cuatro a little less biased than la sexta . 
  then again my news report of choice is either la 1 or the autonomical channel . 
  i only watch la sexta/cuatro when i want to get news an hour earlier , and sometimes for their debates ( 24h is better on that regard , but on weekends your only choices are la sexta and 13tv  .  ), 
  ** tv ( only channels with news reports ) ** * tve , the public broadcaster ( both la 1 and 24h ) : it 's more or less a centrist channel , but in reality it often supports more the party in government than the opposition . 
  * atresmedia ( antena 3 ) : a centre-right wing channel . 
  they do have probably one of the most famous news presenters though . 
  * cuatro : a leftist channel . 
  they have their news an hour earlier than most channels ( 14:00 and 20:00 as opposed to 15:00 and 21:00 ) . 
  * telecinco : oddly enough , probably the least biased channel . 
  they are considered centrists , but maybe slightly sensationalists ? 
  they are much better known for their tv thrash though ( big brother , s\u00e1lvame , etc ) * la sexta : the unofficial podemos channel . 
  very leftist . 
  they are also the `` standard '' channel with the most news reports * 13tv : literally funded by the catholic church . 
  very right wing , it almost makes la sexta look like the bbc in comparison . 
  * regional tv ( in my case canary islands tv ) : owned by the regional governments almost always . 
  they have a lot of padding with uninteresting small local news , but they would be great for getting informed about important local politics and events were it not for one fatal flaw . 
  they are incredibly biased towards the regional government . 
  thus , tv3 ( catalonia ) is basically independence tv , telemadrid ( madrid ) is basically pp-tv , etc, 
  ok , this will be slightly out of date as the law reciently changed the choices of subjects and stuff , but it should be accurate outside of that ( this is what i studied , and i graduated this 2016 ) * infantil ( kindergarten ) : 0-6 years of age . 
  it 's also optional , and even those who go usually start in the `` 2 years '' or the `` 3 years '' classes . 
  * primaria ( primary school ) : years 1-6 . 
  * eso ( mandatory secondary education ) : years 7-10 . 
  slightly more complicated . 
  it 's also the first time you are allowed to take a test in september to pass subjects you failed in june ( must fail 2 or less to advance to the next grade ? ), 
  and in year 10 you start making some career choices , choosing between an `` engineering '' path ( hard math + physics & chemistry + technology ) , a `` biology '' path ( hard math + physics & chemistry + biology ) , an `` arts '' path ( easy math + music + painting ) and a `` letters '' path ( easy math + second foreign language + latin ) . 
  you also get an extra subject where on paper you are able to choose any subject . 
  keep in mind not all career paths are available in all schools . 
  mine for example force us to have our extra subject be second foreign language ( or computing for the letters path ) . 
  similarly not all paths are available at all schools . 
  in mine for example the arts path was unavailable , and in a friend 's school they only had the arts path and the biology path . 
  after the eso you have 2 choices ( other than dropping out and starting to work ) : standard level fp ( proffessional training ) or bachillerato : * bachillerato ( years 11 and 12 ) . 
  not unlike the eso you get several carrer paths , divided into 3 branches with 2 sub-branches : science ( technology and biology ) , letters ( economics and the like/humanities , latin , greek and the like ) and arts ( plastic/scenic ) . 
  at the end you must pass a mandatory test , the pau ( at least until now , i feel sorry for kids from 1999 and beyond :( ) * standard level fp ( 2 years ) : the averege trades . 
  how to become an electrician , plumber , etc if you finish bachillerato you can go to both a higher level fp or university ( or go to work ) . 
  if you chose standard level fp you can only go to higher level fp : * university : self explainatory * higher level fp ( 2 years ) : similar trades to standard level fp , except they are a lot more useful and can actually give you much better jobs . 
  if you finish this you can go to a related degree in university ( so mechanics can go to engineering degrees , associate nurses can to to medicine , etc ) and skip the first year of your degree . 
  well , ca n't you say the 5th of november , or the 21st of march instead ? 
  at least that 's how we were taught in class , though that might have been in order not to confuse us, 
  well , presidential systems do have advantages , most notably separation of powers . 
  for example , here the executive is appointed by the legislative and the judicial appointed by the other 2 . 
   .  i 've seen the uk sometimes be described as an `` elected dictatorship '' the main risk in presidential systems seems to be the executive and legislative being completely opposed and unable to negotiate , as seen now in places like venezuela, 
  tbh , you do get public primaries ( as opposed to candidates appointed by party leaders ) in exchange for long campaigns , though 18 months is indeed ridiculous . 
  also should n't spending be controlled ? 
  even here the amount of ads each party can put is regulated ( not sure about physical billboards , but on tv and radio each party gets a number of ads proportional to their amount of votes . 
  so major parties get like 200 minutes of ads and minor ones like 10 minutes ), 
  the rest of yugoslavia i guess ? 
  that did n't end too well though, 
  for all what 's worth we actually had [ a local version of that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuj36yjfesg ) which basically put small towns ( i think they had to have less than 10k people ) against each other xd it also lasted until the late 2000s , though the last good edition was the 2005 one . 
  well , he supported it at the time and he actually was aznar 's vice president !,
