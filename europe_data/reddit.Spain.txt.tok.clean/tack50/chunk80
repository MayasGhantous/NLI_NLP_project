  here most people just keep their summer tires and if there 's snow on the road they 'll just turn around and go home \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
   1 ) attempt the deportation of millions of illegal immigrants most likely either nothing or say that we do n't agree and we think that inmigrants ( especially latin american ones ) should n't be deported but that that 's an internal us issue  2 ) trade war with china definitely do whatever the eu says . 
  which probably means trying to act as intermediaries ? 
   3 ) leaving nato actually , this is a trump issue many spaniards would actually like !, 
  we actually tried this in 1986 and 4/17 communities ( kind of our `` states '' ) voted for leaving ( catalonia , basque country , canary islands and navarra ) . 
  the vote was n't particularly close though ( 57-43 ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_nato_membership_referendum,_1986 https://accionmasreaccion.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/1986-spain-referendum-nato.png?w=640 i can definitely see podemos supporting leaving nato as well , and supporting the us , while everyone else will feel sad  4 ) responding to iranian provocation on the sea with deadly force . 
  worst case scenario , irak war 2 : middle east bogaloo happens and we do exactly the same again ( right wing government supports us ' middle eastern invasion , terrorist attack in spain happens , the next election a left wing government that pulls us out is formed ), 
   all cars must be equipped with winter tires between 15th november and 15th march . 
  i assume it 's the same in hungary . 
  wait , is n't that only whenever there 's snow on the road and/or a sign like looks like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/se%c3%b1al_r412_nieve.svg ) ? 
  it 's weird to have to always use winter tires . 
  nope , both countries are in the schengen area . 
  most likely scenario is that you 'll just see a sign like [ this ] ( http://comps.canstockphoto.es/can-stock-photo_csp4607878.jpg ) , and that 's it , not unlike when you go from one state to another in the us the worst case scenario is that you 'll get stopped and searched for drugs or something , but that 's incredibly unlikely . 
  even just asking for your passport is probably not going to happen . 
  ca n't you just go through older toll-less roads instead though ? 
  i love thinking about andorra as a self-governing ski resort in winter and tax heaven all year round . 
  they also apparently declared war on germany on ww1 and never signed a peace treaty until the 25th of september 1939 ( after ww ** 2 ** started ! ), 
  i am a fan of symmetrical bicameralism ( what 's the point of the second if they ca n't do anything like our senate ? 
  ) , but i 'll admit it only works if prime ministers are only elected by the lower house or in presidential systems ( like the usa ) i do think an easier fix would be to switch to direct elections for italian president , with 2 rounds like france, 
  a general strike basically occurs once every 6 years or so , but we have n't had one since like 2012 . 
  that 's actually very surprising seeing how unpopular our government has been , and that strikes generally follow unpopular government decisions . 
  then again , we 've only had 1 strike that succeeded at getting what people wanted , and that was our first general strike under democracy , all the way back in 1988 !, 
  all others have ended in failure unfortunately :(, 
  well , from my country i 'd definitely recommend a trip to madrid . 
  lots of culture , museums and monuments to visit . 
  if you want to go somewhere near as well , day trips to the nearby towns of \u00c1vila , segovia ( with a very famous aqueduct ) and toledo are also good ideas to complement a visit to madrid . 
  tbh , other than maybe replacing the eu council with an actual eu senate and * maybe , maybe * instaurating direct elections to the eu commision and putting legislative power in the parliament , the eu does n't really have that much of a democratic defitit . 
  sure , it could be more democratic , but it 's `` fine '' as is . 
  what it needs though is for people to understand it . 
  i would n't know anything about the eu other than that we are part of it and that we vote for it 's parliament , which in people 's minds is basically an slightly less obvious `` politician 's retirement home '' ( the largest one being the spanish senate ), 
  well , ww1 did have quite a bit of influence in spain 's economy at the time . 
  we were taught that it basically caused inflation and unaffordable prices ( since it was more profitable to sell stuff to the nations in war than to spaniards at home ) , which basically combined to all the other problems of spain at the time caused the 1917 revolutionary strike , which failed but signaled that the regime was on it 's last legs and in 1923 primo de rivera would finally kill it . 
  well , the catalan pro independence movement is actually very unrelated to the left-right spectrum for some reason xd ( not even in scotland it happpens like that ) there 's ciu , which is right wing , erc , which is left wing ; and the cup , which is basically communist/anarchist, 
  yeah , it 's not even that long ago . 
  everyone above 55 or 60 years should remember his regime pretty well . 
  ok , according to [ this calculator ] ( http://cincodias.com/cincodias/2014/11/14/economia/1415968654_402666.html#tabla_resultados ) if you had a pre-tax salary of 100k $ , you 'd have to pay roughly 34k $ in taxes ( an average tax rate of 34 % , but obviously there are different brackets ) . 
  the amount varies slightly depending on where you live, 
  yeah , sons and daughters xd i guess children would have been the more accurate word , but translating fron spanish failed me ( normally you use the masculine plural for groups of both genders as well , with the feminine plural being used only if all members are female ; in this case , if you had all daughters you 'd use the feminine `` hijas '' and if you had all sons or some of both you 'd use `` hijos '' ), 
  pretty much . 
  the pp is actually a very large party , including everything from pseudo-libertarians like former governor of madrid esperanza aguirre to very conservative catholics with ties to the church 's opus dei , like minister of the interior jorge fernandez diaz, 
  except under specific circumpstances , not really . 
  1/3 must go to your sons in equally for all another third must also go to your sons , but can be distributed inequally as you wish the final third can go to whoever you want, 
  well , i live in a suburb of a 350 000 people town ( and co-capital of my `` state '' ) , currently trying to get my driver 's license and a car is nice but not necessary . 
  anyways , there 's a small grocery store 10-15 min away by foot and a very large mall with all you said and quite a bit more , 10 min away by bus ( though there 's only 1 every hour ) , 5 min away by car or 30-35 min away by foot also , my university is either 30 min away by bus , 10 min away by car or 50 min away by foot . 
  so , a car is quite nice , but you can live without one easily . 
  worst thing is definitely going out at night ( no buses between 22:00 -06:00 ) , but there 's thankfully a 24/7 bus stop on that large shopping centre i mentioned , so i 'll just take the bus there then walk 30 minutes through the suburbs ( which while not the best , are n't shady at all ; i 've never had any problems ), 
  try doing that here and you probably wo n't last for long in one piece : /, 
  we probably have a couple , but we do n't really have a term to define them other than maybe lunatics, 
  we have like 11 inhabited islands ( 7 in the canary islands and 4 on the balearic islands ) i 've been to all of the canary islands , but i 've never been to the balearic islands : /, 
  canary islands here , and considering it 's almost always between 18 and 30 c the whole year round , i think we have almost the perfect climate xd, 
  at least in spain , it totally is very weird and i 've never seen it . 
  normally milk comes in 1 l cartons like [ these ] ( http://www.missupermercados.com/images/l/leche-semidesnatada-hacendado-brick-pack-6-x-1-l-6-l-pid-6393922.jpg ) , usually in packs of 6 and mostly with a cap . 
  it 's also not uncommon to see them in 1,5 l plastic bottles like [ this one ] ( http://www.centrallecheraasturiana.es/images/products/highres/3d%20nuevoterritorio%20etiq%201,5l%20semi.jpg ) as well though , usually in packs of 4 . 
  actually , while joining the eea in the future is actually quite likely , i 'm not sure about joining the eu . 
  the uk will lose their opt outs , which would mean they 'd have to pledge to use the euro eventually ( though they can just never fulfill the requirements on purpose , like sweden does ) , among other things, 
  i am not a huge fan of free trade ( i 'm neutral towards ceta and opposed to ttip for all what 's worth ) , but i would totally support a deal with the uk , if only because going from the common market to tariffs is way too hard of a transition . 
  a trade deal should make the transition easier for both sides . 
  tbh , if you want to imagine how the eu flag would look like if the number of stars kept increasing with the amount of members , i 've found that an easy way to do so is : take the us flag of the time , cut the stripes and paint the stars yellow . 
  a hypothetical 28 star eu flag would probably look like [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/rvitozy ) tbh , i think the 12 star one is much better, 
  i am going to guess a 2 or 2.5 we are pretty well known i believe . 
  specifically for americans we are even more well known ( probably a 1.5 ) , as a lot of the current us once belonged to spain ( places like texas , california , florida and puerto rico ), 
  ok , to go into the schengen area with a visa as a tourist you 'll need : * to fill an application form * 2 passport style photos of yourself * a working passport * a copy of your route and your hotel ( s ) confirmation letters * a copy of your plane/boat tickets ( important : they must be both ways , you must also have a return trip booked ) * an insurance policy * you need to demonstrate that you can afford to visi europe , and you are apparently self-employed , so you 'll need a copy of your certification that you are self-employed from your country 's commerce ministry ( or equivalent ) , your tax returns for the last 3 years ( come to think about it , that 's actually a lot of stuff xd ) . 
  a travel agency will probably help you get everything sorted out . 
  if not , a visit to the nearest consulate/embassy of the countries you intend to visit might help . 
  as for your girlfriend , i 'm not sure how she would be able to go . 
  i guess she could follow a process similar to yours , but i 've got no idea how it would work exactly . 
  currently trying to beat bravely default and farcry 4 . 
  i 've been trying to clear up my backlog a bit ( even if it 's not that large ) the last game i beat was metroid prime 1 like 3 weeks ago, 
  oh fine , i thought it was navarra which passed and the basque country who failed . 
  still , navarra , a community that is n't exactly poor and has special priviledges ca n't pass that and galicia and the canary islands can ? 
  yes , yes they did . 
  they did n't do anything about federalism though . 
  yeah , it makes no sense whatsoever . 
  hell , there were actually only 3 communities that actually followed the government 's deficit targets !, 
  ( canary islands , galicia and navarra , which benefits from the same system as the basque country ) . 
  how can the rich basque country fail to meet deficit targets , and the canary islands ( community with the second largest unemploument rate , only behind andalucia ) meet them !? 
  apparently all communities are equal , but some more equal than others : /, 
  yeah , spain is legally a unitary state , but in real life it 's a de facto federation ( albeit a partially dysfunctional one ), 
  ok , i 'll give it a shot for my country ( coins should still be controlled by my country imo ) . 
  i 'll do 8 people , for the 8 coins that exist ( 2 $ , 1 $ , 50 cts , 20 cts , 10 cts , 5 cts , 2 cts , 1 cent ) christopher columbus the catholic kings ( alternative : charles i , philip ii or charles iii ) cervantes picasso ( alternatives : velazquez o dali , probably others as well ) the current king benito p\u00e9rez gald\u00f3s ( alternatives : rosal\u00eda de castro , ) santiago ram\u00f3n y cajal jos\u00e9 ortega y gasset ( alternatives : lucius annaeus seneca ), 
  meh , we had [ franco coins ] ( http://www.vivescortada.com/vivestienda/imagenesdb/100%20p.jpg ) for like 40 years . 
  it 's not like they are fully unknown . 
  actually , it 's not * that * many votes !, 
  only either 60 % in both the senate and congress or an absolute majority in the senate +2 / 3 of congress !, 
  if the pp did n't have an absolute majority in the senate , on paper a psoe+p odemos + cs coalition could pass reforms . 
  a referendum can be forced with just 10 % of either the senate or congress though . 
  plus , with the current electoral system there 's no way the pp will ever lose their hold on the senate , basically blocking any kind of reforms ( even in 2004 when zapatero won they still held the senate and in 2008 with a larger margin they only lost it narrowly ! ), 
  one of the 4 major parties ( the psoe , placed 2nd in the last elections ) , has been calling for a constitutional reform which makes spain a federal state , but they have been pretty ambiguous about it . 
  it can range from pretty much keeping the same system , just making official what is already de facto true ; to something like the united states of spain ( or even more devolved than the usa , as they do n't accept secession of territories ! ) . 
  podemos has been even more ambiguous , saying that they have an attractive model for the basque country and catalonia , but not specifying what that model would look like . 
  they do support independence referendums though . 
  nationalist parties either just want to keep their current compensation/priviledge ( depending on your point of view ) systems , like nc and cc ( canary islands ) or pnv ( basque country ) or outright independence , like bildu ( basque country ) or erc and the formerly called ciu ( catalonia ) ciudadanos also calls for a constitutional reform , but iirc their proposal is more centered on other stuff , like a fairer electoral law , a more useful senate or imposing term limits on prime ministers . 
  the pp is probably opposed to most federal reforms ( have n't heard anything from them tbh ) . 
  as for other reforms , iirc they do n't reject them outright , but they do say that they are happy with the current constitution but that they are open to discussing reform proposals . 
  tbh , if everyone had the basque system , would n't that mean that poorer areas ( like andalucia or extremadura ) will receive the same money as the rich ones , basically killing the solidarity among regions principle ? 
  ( even the eu , which is not even a country has distribution of wealth ! ), 
  yeah , the psoe ( and even then not all of it ) was really the only party proposing that . 
  i can see podemos and the nationalist parties ( minus * maybe * cc ) supporting that as well very easily , but no way pp and cs will ever agree . 
  i see this , and upgrade to [ this ] ( http://www.fuenterrebollo.com/faqs-numismatica/ima98/1873-10reales-cartagena-750.jpg ) i 'll admit though that i prefer the 1st republic to the 2nd . 
  something like cartagena ( a region with literally 0 independentist feelings ) trying to enter the us is so ridiculous it would n't even be accepted as a movie xd it 's also way less controversial and imo has the [ superior flag ] ( https://marcopolito56.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/pabellc3b3n_usado_durante_la_primera_repc3bablica_espac3b1ola.png ),
