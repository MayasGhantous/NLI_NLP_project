  yeah , that only really applies to the canary islands unfortunately . 
  ( though iirc the mediterranean coast still has nice weather ) . 
  i remember going to bilbao in winter and really hating the cold ( thankfully it never rained or anything ), 
   b : germans do n't like buying everything in the same store . 
  we like specialised stores . 
  if our grocery shop sells tires and belts , they may get away with it , but the larger it gets the more it will turn us away . 
  not sure how germany is in that regard , but carrefour and auchan ( really the french retailers ) love to do that and they are pretty successful over here ( not the largest , but still pretty big ), 
  well , pretty much party ; or at least go to a bar with friends . 
  i guess going ot the cinema or something are decent options as well though . 
  i 'd just tell them about the weather . 
  between 20c and 30c all year long , 24/7 !, 
  perfect weather for everything really . 
  no idea . 
  for what it 's worth i think the `` texas of spain '' is probably something like castille ( both castilles . 
  la mancha has a closer weather but it 's more leftist ), 
  to be fair , it would n't be that surprising seeing how texas once belonged to the spanish empire , and later to mexico . 
  a conservative one where people are drunk . 
  ca n't think of much ( do n't know us stereotypes ) i guess louisiana ? 
  well , the first thing is to know the native language of the country you want to go to :p there are exceptions though ( i have an acquaintance of mine in the netherlands , and he ca n't speak dutch at all . 
  he can speak english though ) . 
  if you want to go somewhere you do n't know the language of ; look for an english program ( they are rare here in spain though , but you might be luckier somewhere else ), 
  currently a first year university student living with my parents :p an average appartment in my home town would cost you around 120k $ to buy ; or like 450 $ if you want to rent . 
  yeah , it 's actually the more common way to speak spanish actually ( in the sense that american english is the more common way to speak english ) . 
  check out any novela or latin american tv series ( or dub ) if you want to watch people speaking that way ( there are many more differences than that though ; like say , ustedes/vosotros ), 
  to be fair , if you have trouble with the `` th '' sound , just drop it , and speak only with the `` s '' sound . 
  ( so , you 'd say velasques instead of velathqueth ) that 's actually a very common feature of most spanish accents . 
  in fact , the spain accent is the only one that does n't do that !, 
  ( all across latin america people speak like that ; and even in some spanish regions like the canary islands ; maybe even andalusia as well ? 
  to be honest , i like how [ that line was changed in the dub ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxobpbkinfw ) latin americans did n't do it , and it [ works worse ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qzjb9hjogi ) * quickly hides *, 
  i am actually one of the few students that writes moodle as m\u00fadel xd, 
  come to think about it , there are many large spanish youtubers . 
  elrubiusomg is ok at best ; he is basically the spanish pewdiepie , but he is like the 15th largest channel in youtube . 
  pretty impressive for a channel not in english . 
  holasoygerman is actually second !, 
  but he cheated to get there anyways ; plus he is n't spanish, 
  not to mention smosh , which actually has a full spanish version of their channel with official dubs for their videos ( admittedly thought more for latin america than spain though ) [ elsmosh ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/elsmosh ), 
  france with canada if we must stick to countries , but quebec for paris would probably work better . 
  we get rid of arrogant french speakers and we get instead polite french speakers :d, 
  i personally love the `` esto no es forocoches '' remark on / r/epana xd, 
  for a moment i thought that might be somehow like / r/the _ donald in terms of what was posted there xd, 
  well , erm , it 's almost dead i think . 
  / r/es has very few activity . 
  oddly enough / r/spain has a bit more , but not much . 
  [ relevant simpsons pic ] ( https://67.media.tumblr.com/b5e1db75dabbad7123643d330086ab58/tumblr_nvcwwfhbye1s9y3qio1_500.jpg ), 
  * we are incredibly loud * we do stuff at incredibly weird times for european standards ( lunch at 14:00 ; dinner at 20:30 and that 's in my family , where we actually eat early for spanish standards ! ), 
  i still wonder why there is n't some drink that mixes both . 
  well , when i was like 4 i had difficulty pronouncing the soft r ( the one in english , or in words like `` pera '' ) . 
  i just pronounced them with an l for some reason xd i quickly got over it , but one friend still suffers a bit ( not much ) from that . 
  come to think of it , that 's actually the way to caricaturize asians ' speech over here ( kind of like reversed engrish ; substituting rs with ls ) . 
  i do n't really care since many of my friends already call me by both on casual situations . 
  i would hate to be called mr fulanez ( or sr fulanez ) though ( not real surname ) . 
  just call me either juan ( not real name ) or fulanez , but not se\u00f1or pls xd it 's very rarely used tbh . 
  also , spanish names have 2 surnames for the most part ( one from the father and one from the mother ; women do n't change their surnames when married ) . 
  you normally just use the first one though . 
  yeah , well , i meant 12 hour time, 
  for atvs we normally either call them todoterrenos ( literally all-terrains ; an abreviation of all-terrain vehicle ) . 
  many also call them either jeep ( because of the brand ) or `` cuatro por cuatro '' ( literally 4x4 ) edit : apparently i misunderstood what an atv was . 
  what you posted is what we actually call a quad . 
  as for the watercrafts ; we just call them `` motos de agua '' ( water motorcycles ), 
  according to eurovision , all the way to australia : /, 
  we normally say either `` salud '' ( basically health ) or `` jesus '' ( self explainatory ) . 
  i guess the second is closer to what americans say . 
  normally we use 24h time for written stuff and am/pm for oral communication . 
  it 's not uncommon , but there 's still a lot of people that study on their local university . 
  i 'll personally study in my local university in the canary islands , but many of my high school colleagues are going to the mainland ( mostly madrid ) to study . 
  a couple are going to the uk as well . 
  however , i studied in a private school . 
  pretty sure people from public ones mostly stay at their local university . 
  well , indeed it 's the `` eastern block '' one of the most unhappy with the eu ( not even all of it though . 
  iirc the baltics and romania and bulgaria are n't that unhappy ) however , they are definitely not leaving the eu any time soon . 
  the only country right now i can see exiting is france , and that 's very unlikely ( basically requires le pen to win ; which is very unlikely ; then she calling a referendum and finally the french wanting to leave . 
  none of those are likely , let alone all ) . 
  ok , so on paper spain is a unitary country . 
  ( ie not a federation ) ; probably due to the right 's fear of federalism since pretty much forever ( even today it 's the left that wants a federation ; while the right hates the idea ) . 
  after all , franco 's state motto was `` one ; large and free '' however , in practice it 's actually more of a federation , with directly elected regional governments and different sets of laws in each region . 
  still , the autonomy of the regional governments is limited anyways . 
  in your average life , the regional government holds pretty much the same amount of power as the central one in madrid . 
  if you care , the powers of both the central spanish government and the states ' governments are outlined in the spanish constitution , but the central government has much more power . 
  yeah . 
  the canary islands have more or less the same degree of autonomy as something like the basque country does ( which iirc gets more taxation powers ? ), 
  the vat on the islands is much lower ( 7 % compared to 21 % everywhere else ) and iirc there 's an special `` ref '' ( economical and fiscal regime ) that basically means the islands get some special stuff due to being too far , but that 's it ( and iirc the regional government is complaining that that regime is n't really upheld by the central government ), 
  definitely not over here :p in houses with wooden floors it 's a bit easier to see , but still very rare . 
  in houses with floors that are n't made of wood then everyone uses shoes . 
  forocoches or what ? 
  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icvy7ve6y6a ), 
  yeah , same in mine ; no way we can get under 3kw ( iirc we have like 4.5 or so and sometimes the lights go out because of too much stuff being plugged in ), 
  a very , very reformed turkey i guess could enter ( though that 's very far into the future , like 30 years at best ) . 
  current turkey ? 
  this would be the result : http://i.imgur.com/emy5dhq.png, 
   could you image if we had a froilan as king ? 
  to be fair , i am very curious about having froilan i as king xd he would definitely make for an interesting king . 
  we already did . 
  in 1975 : / oh well , it 's not like spanish republics have the best of track records ( [ first ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_spanish_republic ) did n't even last a full year ; [ second ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_spanish_republic ) only lasted for 5 before a 3 year civil war where it was defeated ), 
  on the flip side , if you somehow manage to use less than 3kw ( or are over 60 , everyone in your family is unemployed or you are a family with lots of children ) , the government will pay for a quarter of your light bill or something like that, 
  actually , i 've been watching dragon ball z kai in mexican spanish reciently xd ( since kai has n't been dubbed in castillian spanish after all ) . 
  it 's definitely much better than the castillian version i grew up with ( do n't know about the catalan/basque/galician versions though ) . 
  definitely worth it if you can stand the accent . 
   the simpsons always dubbed into spanish * shhh * , we do n't want [ that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg2sy4-isj8 ) debate to happen do n't we ? 
   `` das boot '' springs to minds , and `` die untergang '' ( `` downfall '' ) . 
  on the flip-side , i love all those `` die untergang '' parodies , like [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qm5f_gzt06c ) for example xd,
