you did n't realise how mountainous those two mountain chains are ? 
  it 's the highest point in the netherlands mainland . 
  france 's proficiency is worse than spain 's ? 
  that does n't seem right . 
  `` nobody is forcing them '' is not a good excuse for child slavery , just as it is n't for child rape . 
  i thought that was fairly obvious . 
  i 'd be more concerned about the slaves at bangladesh and all that ... 
  yes . 
  europe is a no-go zone full of violent , dangerous muslims who will rape your women and behead you . 
  please make sure you never come near it and just to be sure do not leave your country at all . 
  what are you talking about , exactly ? 
  phew . 
  barely made it . 
  iberia * does * sound pretty epic as a country name . 
  lol, 
  the information that a piece of code is able to convey is always either self-descriptive ( which makes a programming language a language as much as the information a rock provides about itself makes the rock a sentence ) or not provided * in * a programming language ( annotations , etc ) . 
  you * can not * make an assertion in a programming language , and it would n't make sense to be able to . 
  computers execute commands and programming languages allow to give them . 
  if there is ever information in a code it is in an actual language , and it is there for the computer to perform instructed actions onto it or for a human to see , not to * communicate * anything to the computer itself . 
  realising this is as easy as trying to translate this conversation into any programming language . 
  edit : a word, 
  i would n't exactly call it unimportant , it being the sixth most spoken language in the continent ( fourth not counting english and russian ) , but yeah , it is n't the most important either ( within europe at least ) . 
  with programming languages you give commands . 
  you do not communicate meaning . 
  no part of this conversation could be taking place `` in '' a programming language . 
  you can argue about the semantics of the word `` language '' but without further distinction that only serves to imply that languages and programming languages are in the same category , which is flat out incorrect . 
  well , in spain there 's [ the lovers of teruel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lovers_of_teruel ) , which is what i immediately thought of , and we also have [ la celestina ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_celestina ) . 
  still , at least public opinion is consulted and voiced . 
  that 's a big thing . 
  you complain about the translations yet you 're the only commenter in this whole thread who was n't able to comment in english . 
  yeah , spanish as well . 
  ha , lucky you , in spain we do n't even have an `` obligatory referendum '' threshold . 
  if you get 500,000 signatures it gets to congress , but the congress can just say `` lol no '' and tell you to fuck off . 
  yes , this is no isolated incident . 
  people are being arrested over tweets and there 's this alf\u00f3n kid who 's in jail for alleged possession of explosives without any evidence . 
  it 's just that this is * so * blatantly unfair that it is n't something that can be distorted or rationalised away by perspective . 
  putting people in jail before a trial because of * any * kind of puppet show is wrong , and most people ca n't avoid reaching that conclusion however big their alienation is . 
  they 're no more hypocritical than other parties ' voters . 
  podemos and podemos ' sister formations have allied multiple times with psoe to form local governments , most famously in madrid . 
  podemos voters knew or should have known that this was a possibility , a preferred one considering all other options include either pp or ciudadanos . 
  it does n't matter if it 's the lesser of two evils . 
  i do n't know about you , but i would prefer * that * as opposed to the greater evil . 
  this is n't being given enough attention , especially internationally . 
  the gag law and now this , it 's starting to feel like 1984 . 
  yeah ... 
  i would n't trust el pa\u00eds ... oh , and it seems pretty obvious that if more people voted for podemos than for ciudadanos , it means more people want podemos in the government than they want ciudadanos . 
  regardless of what el pa\u00eds 's polls say . 
  god , that hurts . 
  yeah we noticed ... 
  i often forget how beautiful some parts of my country are . 
  seen as they want to raise the minimum wage , and that they 're the ones that would be in the government if this was applied , i do n't think there 's anything wrong with this measure . 
  it 's called alienation . 
  manipulating an oppressed collective into supporting their oppressors . 
  the reason right-wing lower and middle class people are a thing . 
  iberia would be more fitting and epic-sounding ( especially if we ~ ~ invaded ~ ~ annexed portugal ) . 
  besides , eta started when franco was still around , and they even had moderate support from ordinary basque people that were tired of the repression their language and culture suffered . 
  today , all cultures and languages ( save asturian ) within spain are recognised and protected by law , and each region is given certain freedom to self-manage . 
  granted , the situation could be better , but it 's hardly repressive enough to motivate the formation of any kind of terrorist group . 
  if basque independence had been achieved thanks to eta , maybe , but seeing how that turned out , i do n't think so . 
  the link in their [ twitter profile ] ( https://twitter.com/sci_hub ) is up , and it 's likely that it will be updated if there are any changes . 
  until the account gets suspended , that is . 
  it would 've been the same in spanish if it were n't for those goddamn basques :(, 
  greenwich is outdated . 
  the cool thing now is coordinated universal time . 
  username checks out ? 
  why ?!, 
  i want us to come back together !, 
  we can be friends !, 
  yeah , i know . 
  currently laying on my bed in my pitch black bedroom at 11 am , 
  to be fair two cities on the northern tip of morocco belong to us . 
  window shutters are n't ubiquitous everywhere ? 
  yeah , same in spain . 
  i have a vodafone mobile plan and recently something called `` chatzero '' was introduced to my plan . 
  the most popular messaging apps like whatsapp , telegram , line and i think some others no longer count towards my data cap . 
  it 's very convenient but i 'm torn . 
  same for spain . 
  olive branch sunday ( domingo de ramos ) for the initial sunday and resurrection sunday ( domingo de resurrecci\u00f3n ) for the final one . 
  all days inbetween are just `` holy '' ( `` santo '' ) . 
  madrid , paris , lisbon , london , bern , amsterdam , brussels , berlin , rome . 
  as for micro countries luxembourg , monaco , liechtenstein and vatican city . 
  i 'd like to visit athens , edinburgh , dublin , vienna , stockholm , copenhagen and helsinki mainly . 
  plus moscow and reykjavik which also only sort of count . 
  nope . 
  would be cool though . 
  ridiculously expensive too . 
  seriously , it 's probably not worth it if they 're able to study in the eu . 
  lol that sub is still trying to be a thing . 
  oh , the x is a placeholder letter that serves as a gender neutral variant of the adjective . 
  '' @ '' is more common but i like the x better , i 've seen it in english sometimes when speaking about latinxs . 
  the actual adjective is `` negro '' for males and `` negra '' for females . 
  ca n't you get all of them ? 
  we speak of invasions and that makes us sound like a tortured people that does n't stop getting invaded but we are descendant from those people today ( except the napoleon one which we fought against and won ) , it 's as if british colonisation was talked about as `` the british invasion '' over there . 
  all vodafone contracts are roaming-free for the us and europe here in spain . 
  your comment : 1 . 
  does n't make _ any _ sense . 
  does n't answer my question in any comprehensible manner . 
  bye now . 
  there are n't many black spaniards but i guess i 'd just call them spanish and , if race came up , negrx ( not a racial slur in spanish , just means `` black '' ) . 
  why do you [ use the term `` american '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/4o5r3o/what_is_your_favorite_traditional_food_preferably/d4aogqj ) , then ?
