   there are definitely no european countries that engage in imperialism and slavery in the third world right now . 
   though i have no doubt there are some european-based corporations which may profit from slavery-like working conditions in their third world factories . 
  right , but those * very companies * then turn around and sell their slave-produce in europe , the us , etc. 
  * allowing the sale of slave-made products means you are complicit with slavery . 
  seems that your definition of `` modern day '' is quite broad then . 
  just my favorite go-to example , and i used `` the last time '' rhetorically , because sadly * it was n't the last time that happened * . 
  there 's also [ the banana republics ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/banana_republic ) , [ the chilean coup ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/1973_chilean_coup_d'%c3%a9tat ) , the invasion of iraq and afghanistan , the backing of the saudi regime , etc. 
  more coups and interventions arranged by the west , mostly the us or uk : iran ( 1953 ) ; guatemala ( 1954 ) ; thailand ( 1957 ) ; laos ( 1958-60 ) ; the congo ( 1960 ) ; turkey ( 1960 , 1971 & 1980 ) ; ecuador ( 1961 & 1963 ) ; south vietnam ( 1963 ) ; brazil ( 1964 ) ; the dominican republic ( 1963 ) ; argentina ( 1963 ) ; honduras ( 1963 & 2009 ) ; iraq ( 1963 & 2003 ) ; bolivia ( 1964 , 1971 & 1980 ) ; indonesia ( 1965 ) ; ghana ( 1966 ) ; greece ( 1967 ) ; panama ( 1968 & 1989 ) ; cambodia ( 1970 ) ; chile ( 1973 ) ; bangladesh ( 1975 ) ; pakistan ( 1977 ) ; grenada ( 1983 ) ; mauritania ( 1984 ) ; guinea ( 1984 ) ; burkina faso ( 1987 ) ; paraguay ( 1989 ) ; haiti ( 1991 & 2004 ) ; russia ( 1993 ) ; uganda ( 1996 ) ; and libya ( 2011 ) . 
  and so on . 
  all of these have impacts down to the present day , even - no , * especially * the iranian coup, 
   alright fair enough , explain to me how much of a better life these people would have if they did n't have a job . 
  this is such a dumb argument . 
  by this same logic , it should be legal for british companies to pay british workers sweatshop wages in sweatshop conditions , because that 's still better than unemployment . 
  in fact , * that 's exactly the argument used by big business when , in the 1900s , labor laws first started getting passed . 
  * if you think all humans are equal , then they 're entitled to the same standards across the globe . 
  the fact is , whenever people make this argument , they are subconsciously of the opinion that people abroad do n't deserve the same rights as them , which is of course bigoted . 
  i 'll concede that wages should scale with purchasing power , but purchasing power alone - as it stands third world workers are paid far less than first world workers in far inferior conditions for the same labor even as a function of their purchasing power . 
   but if you can come up with an article about the amount of empty third world classrooms the dirty western imperialists snatched their children out of i 'd be completely willing to admit that there are better alternatives . 
  except i just did . 
  at least one of my sources goes over how the police in many countries , paid out by foreign companies , force children out of school to work for them , even if they do n't want to . 
  we 're talking about whole villages and towns being held at the mercy of multinational corporations , mind you . 
   buying goods made from cheap labour = / = imperialism = / = interfering in other countries out of national interest . 
  not directly equal , perhaps , but interrelated . 
  why do we intervene ? 
  to keep cheap goods flowing . 
  how are those cheap good made ? 
  cheap , slave or slave-like labor . 
  what is this called ? 
  imperialism . 
   while xix/xx century us/european actions in middle east caused great deal of issues , i would n't say that they hold all the blame for this mess . 
  no , just like 95 % of the blame . 
   or even majority . 
  * way more than a majority . 
  *  huge part of the problems were created by homegrown arab oppression after disintegration of osman empire . 
  lmao , who disintegrated the ottoman empire in the most destructive way possible ? 
  who redrew its borders ? 
  who created israel ? 
  who decided to put historical enemies within the same polities ? 
  further , you think wahhabist islam would even be a thing if the west was n't leeching oil from the teats of wahhabist arabia ? 
  of course not . 
   either way , things are much more complicated than you make them to be . 
  perhaps , but i was n't going for being complicated . 
  i was going for succinctness . 
  on balance , do european nations and the us hold the blame of about 95 % of the shit that goes down in the third world ? 
  undoubtedly . 
  we can quibble on the exact percentage , but it 's definitely a majority , and even if it was n't , it 's still a significant enough amount that for xenophobes to tell those third worlders not to come to their country is nothing but chauvinism . 
  take off your shirt . 
  look at the tag . 
  was it made in your country or one with similar labor laws ? 
  good . 
  then your country is part of the problem . 
  technically , not actually an iberian ( or a european for that matter ) . 
  but i just happen to love catalonia . 
  no , it 's not a scientific fact . 
  it has a major citation needed . 
  in fact , it 's literally the opposite of a scientific fact . 
  just because people evolve differently does not mean that people evolved differently * in the way that you postulated . 
  shithole countries that breed terrorism do not appear in vacuums , nor do regions like europe get so rich while other regions remain so poor because of pure coincidence , people do not try to flee their home countries for shits and giggles , and most saliently people do n't hate the west simply because they `` hate your freedoms . '', 
  because my comment * was n't * an irrelevant whatboutism .

  imperialism and slavery are pretty much responsible for the first world 's standard of living . 
  [ read this article ] ( http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/11/07/apple_iphone_workers_imprisoned_in_virtual_slavery_report/ ) and stop being an apologist for slavery . 
  [ read this book ] ( http://books.google.com/books?id=p9zhnlljwssc ) [ another article on slavery in supply chains ] ( http://www.antislavery.org/english/slavery_today/slavery_and_what_we_buy.aspx ) [ this article shows how companies can eliminate slave labor from their supply chain , and yet they choose not to ] ( http://www.ihrb.org/commentary/slavery_in_supply_chains.html ) [ meanwhile the immoral , unjust , and frankly pathetic excuse of a british government will not require companies to disclose their use of slaves ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jun/10/companies-slavery-forced-labour-supply-chains-new-laws ) , because according to the home office , it might be too much of a `` burden . '', 
  right , because slavery is not a burden but profiting off it is . 
  and why did the home office make such a proclamation ? 
  [ because the guardian published a piece on how asian slavery was producing prawns for sale in the us and uk ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jun/10/supermarket-prawns-thailand-produced-slave-labour ) . 
  remember the last time a country tried to nationalize its own resources so that multinational leeches from the uk/us could n't profit off of slavery and rapacious resource extraction ? 
  [ iran , 1953 , the virulent leech-cult that is the british government together with the us to overthrew the democratically elected leader of iran because he had the audacity to try and nationalize iranian oil . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_iranian_coup_d'%c3%a9tat ) british petroleum threw a hissy-fit that the uppity iranian slaves were making such a fuss , so the cia and mi6 replaced mossadegh with a brutal dictator who was friendly to their interests , a chain of events that directly led to the rise of the ayatollah and the present status of iran as a theocracy . 
  no fucking shit , but the point is you 're not telling us anything we do n't already know . 
  your comment is childishly simplistic and could be applied to any tragedy in human history . 
  it does n't contribute to or generate discussion . 
  downvote and move on folks . 
  i 'm done talking to this manchild who apparently ca n't form complex thoughts . 
  i meant * in the modern day . 
  [ typical whataboutery ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/whataboutism ) not off to a good start are we , seeing as this is your second comment ? 
  do n't worry , you 'll learn . 
  when will france arrest the anti-ziganist white power leader sarkozy ? 
  when will germany try itself for [ ethnic cleansing ] ( http://euobserver.com/social/30563 ) ? 
  lmao what ? 
  now when do we get a map of european countries that engage in the most imperialism and slavery in the third world ? 
  and people have the audacity to refer to these immigrants as `` invaders . '', 
  yea , it does make you racist . 
  why do you think europe is yours alone ? 
  also , no , it 's really [ comments like this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/2gdc7d/pol_asks_the_whites_to_check_their_privilege/cki60s7 ) that make you racist, 
  lmao muslim `` invaders '' ? 
  you systematically rape and imperialize their home countries for centuries up to and including the present day , but when they try to find a better home for themselves , they 're suddenly `` invaders '' ? 
  can you name any other invading group in history whose plan of invasion involved getting on unseaworthy boats filled to double and triple their capacity that often capsize in the process of bring the supposed invaders to the invaded countries ? 
   who cares if sd is a racist party ? 
  username checks out . 
   the rest is disposed in a safe way , underground . 
  ( there is no problem with that , the earth 's internal heat comes from radioactivity after all ) your parenthetical comment implies that buried radioactive waste is the same thing as radioactivity in the mantle and core . 
  when , in fact , the former poses a threat to life while the latter does n't . 
  yes you did . 
  the part of the earth where radioactive heat is produced is beyond the crust , in the mantle and in the core . 
  hahahaha no we do n't . 
  the deepest holes ever dug by man have never even made it through the crust . 
  except we * ca n't * dig deep enough . 
  i literally just typed out several sentences to show you how wrong you are . 
  here we go again :  the radioactive energy of the earth comes from very deep within , where it has no chance of harming life on the surface .
