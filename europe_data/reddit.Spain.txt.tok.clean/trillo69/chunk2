  oh , you probably would n't like being forced to do something you did n't agree to . 
  we are for those that enter europe through spain , it 's called berlin ii . 
  i do n't understand why mandatory quotas are n't forced onto countries . 
  this kind of anti-eu attitude is n't present when it comes to access to financing from ecb or eu development funds . 
  some governments act like if they were going to receive as many refugees as their country 's population . 
   syria got out of hand for exactly the opposite reasons . 
  ** there was no intervention ** so there was a civil war for 4-5 years , and assad is still there ( sort of ) but there was enough room for isis to take over . 
  that , except for the isis part , was probably intended . 
  and even then i wonder how people who was killed during riots by al assad suddenly turn in something so big as isis . 
  i would have confidence in eu and the us if it were n't because they already proved several times how they `` deal '' with conflicts in the middle east or eastern europe . 
   holy shit , i keep being called racist for opinions like this . 
  if you keep being told that , maybe they are right . 
   why do n't we , instead of spending all of our money on trying to house far too many people ( we can only fit so many . . ) , send our military to make their country safe for them to live !, 
  heh , it 's quite funny you say that considering how all this started ( or iraq ) , on the level of david cameron 's last statement on the syrian conflict . 
  yeah , i did little maths and realised it 's a perfectly normal amount . 
  if you ( germany ) do it , maybe . 
  the other day i saw a refugee on tv saying he had paid $ 10,000 to a smuggler to get to germany . 
  i immediately thought , why do n't they take a plane ? 
  the reporter asked him exactly that and the refugee answered they simply ca n't take ordinary transport ( the eu do not allow it ) . 
  even if they can afford it , they need to risk their lives in the ocean . 
  i ca n't believe how absurd this is . 
  i do n't know about german news , but dublin ii is a big `` fuck you '' to countries like spain , italy or greece regarding illegal immigration . 
  it was about time something like this quotas entered the debate , because i think it 's just common sense . 
  it has restored my faith in the eu after the greek bailout negotiations . 
   look , nobel prize-winning economists paul krugman and joseph stiglitz ; jeffrey sachs of columbia university ; james galbraith of the university of texas at austin ; and thomas piketty , professor at the paris school of economics , amartya sen , ...  the list goes on and on . 
  all of them say the euro is a stupid idea and you should get out of it . 
  specifically , stiglitz said that the first to get out of the euro would fare the best . 
   i 'm no economist , but when a whole bunch of first rate economists agree to say the euro is a bad idea , i think i 'll listen to what they have to say . 
  they agree it 's a bad idea ** without a common fiscal policy ** . 
  it 's quite a different stance . 
  if that 's a yearly amount it seems pretty damn huge , to be honest . 
   i can only say that gays are now 100 % socially accepted and it is the most natural thing to see couples walking around holding hands , or even with a child i wish you were right , honestly . 
  things got much better , but ask any gay or lesbian and they will tell you how they still get harassed from time to time . 
  i have my hopes in the next generation , those raised with gay marriage being something normal . 
   and what about the opinions , desires , and needs of the people who already live there ? 
  if your country ca n't afford that and taking a thousand of refugees maybe you should vote other politicians , because i am sure your people pay a fuckton of taxes , and this refugees will cost much less than what some banks have been bailed out , for example . 
   once they 're in they only cause problems . 
  or maybe they work and pay taxes . 
  you talk like if crimes or felonies do not exist in your country now . 
   no high absolutely speaking but when compared to the poor income of the state , yes . 
  this will sink once you lower salaries because tax collection decreases as well . 
  and if you dare to rise your taxes at the same time you lower your salaries , you 've created the perfect scenery of a deflationary spiral , which is the best way to destroy a country . 
  seriously , the moment you start buying this essay of `` salaries are too high '' , `` public sector is too big '' and such you are doomed . 
  look at my country , look at greece , do you think austerity has solved our problems ? 
  our salaries and quality of life have plummeted , and our country is weaker than 8 years ago . 
  we 've literally thrown 8 years to the bin , just to end way more indebted , with worse public services , worst quality of life and a 25 % of our population below the poverty threshold . 
  and most of my friend migrating to other countries looking for hope . 
  if you appreciate your country and your quality of life think further than `` we earn too much '' . 
  everything u/toppo has replied to you and specially the part about pay cuts has been 100 % accurate in the case of greece and spain . 
  does you purchase capacity get lowered on the day to day ? 
  i know imports gets more expensive , but i have always wondered how does it feel in terms of buying the basics in a full developed country . 
  i was very young when we had the ` peseta ' in spain , and devaluation within the euro seemed less noticeable this last months ( due to ecb qe ) except for electronic goods and travelling . 
  so from my point of view , it seems better than having our wages cut down . 
  because their country is in a fucking war maybe ? 
  fucking exactly this !, 
  even here in spain , which is supposedly an economic potency within eu , would collapse completely without the eu economic aid . 
  but hey , better think not taking a few thousand migrants is worth leaving the eu . 
  * sigh ... *, 
  durao barroso is the president of the european comission , should n't his opinion be taken into account just because we disagree with him ? 
  i am quite sure his opinions ( and the people behind him ) has way more weight than ours . 
   i was saying that the feedback from the ones that show independence feelings was about change without spain no within . 
  lmao , that 's exactly what i said . 
  if they did n't want a change without spain they would n't be pro independence , that 's why your `` sample '' means nothing to give someone else an overview of the situation in galicia or basque country . 
  a sample bigger than `` my pro independence friends to whom i talked '' . 
  we have the recent local elections as a good thermometer of that , and bng ( main pro independent party ) was almost vanished in most of galicia . 
  your statement made it look like something much more extended that it really is , and people outside spain might think the feelings are similar in galicia and catalonia ( what you implied ) when that 's quite far from the reality . 
  please , notice the `` right after '' . 
  and the one who told scotland they would need to apply for eu membership like every other country was durao barroso . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-26215963 http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/feb/16/independent-scotland-extremely-difficult-join-eu most people in catalonia take eu membership for granted , but most likely they would have to `` start over '' , thus my question : what makes you different from scotland ? 
   what you people have to understand is that companies does n't have ideology they go where the money is . 
  the thing is , it 's very likely all that money flows outside catalonia during the process . 
  we see that every time a country faces difficulties ( spain , greece , italy , china , emerging markets ) , catalonia would n't be different . 
  you do n't talk with many galicians then . 
  galician independentism is a small minority here , and if you think otherwise just take a look at our elected parliament . 
  i 'd really like to ask to all the pro-independents in this thread what makes you think you will be allowed in the eu right after becoming an independent nation , when scotland was told just few months ago they would n't and that they would have to apply ( being left out meanwhile ) like every other country . 
  i think is quite an honest and reasonable question . 
  i do n't see this being different from the scotland 's . 
  the thing is most people in spain do n't care whether they become independent or not , nor are against a referendum . 
  it just happen the ones that are actively against make a lot of noise and ~ ~ pay ~ ~ get a lot of attention from the media . 
  you will never see a poll asking your opinion about catalonia independence with the option `` do n't care '' , it 's always against or in favour . 
  to be fair , point 1 is very spot on . 
  half the people around mas are facing a trial for fiscal evasion and receiving bribes for decades . 
  thinking he was not involved or knew nothing is quite na\u00efve or cynical . 
   it is not only unemployment . 
  we have for example a low natality rate , which makes it difficult to pay our pension system . 
  we also have a pretty restrictive territorial organization . 
  that kind of things are making spain difficult ... but all those things are socially speaking difficult to change since they are consolidated in our society . 
  that 's exactly the reason why i say that would n't work in spain , because when liberals in spain talk about a less rigid market they never mention family conciliation or higher salaries so a single member can economically support a family . 
  never . 
  only lower salaries and more work hours are considered , do you honestly think those problems you mentioned would be solved or improve with a more liberal environment ? 
  come on , you know we talk about spain where the `` model liberal/employer '' always end up being a scammer who does not even pay their workers ( gowex , marsans , ... ) while the decent ones shutdown their companies , unable to compete fairly in the `` free market '' . 
   where and when has it been proved as * wrong * ? 
  spain of course . 
  there has been two liberal labour market reforms ( 2010 , 2012 ) in order to make it more flexible , which nullified union agreements and cheapened sacking costs . 
  the result is obvious : unemployment skyrocketed since then , salaries plummeted and the only sight of recovery it has been due to qe from the ecb ( and public debt going from ~ 60 % to ~ 100 % ) . 
  as i said , this is spain . 
  and now that you mention dutch , german , british or french markets , those offer much better coverage for the worker and unemployed than spain , which is limited and you will loose if you refuse to go to an interview . 
   in spain and italy , unfortunately , there are too many people that do not want to work because of these laws . 
  oh , the old `` unemployed do not work because they do n't want to '' , it never ceases to be used . 
  better not to talk about job offers who piss on people 's dignity , which plague spanish job market so people prefer to migrate or join the navy .
