   i 'm not neoliberal , by the way . 
  but i believe there is not a liberal party in spain and in any other mediterranian eu country , and that 's part of the problem . 
  `` i 'm not racist but ... '' do n't worry , i trust you . 
  however as i said we are in spain and we need to think who would apply liberal measures here ( we have rajoy and montoro , not merkel and schauble ) , so we do n't end up in feudalism again . 
   that 's what i was talking about . 
  three sovereign states with 20 million people is a very low population rate . 
  it simplifies the system . 
  spain more than doubles that , so i believe that huge advantage is not possible here . 
  that 's only a problem because of unemployment rates , with lower ones it works even better . 
  do you remember how spain was reducing its deficit/debt during the boom ? 
  then it was sustainable and profitable because working people with decent salaries spend ( and latins a lot ) and pay taxes . 
  some pensions are indeed a problem , like early retired people with miner , shipyards or military pensions ( +2 k/mth ) . 
   i think welfare state is an imperative way of live both in spain and in the european union . 
  but i must say some things in the spanish system have been done wrong . 
  same as in italian , portuguese and greek . 
  i would support a rationalization of our welfare state and a deregularization of labor market . 
  that is as efficient as unpopular , i 'm afraid ... that 's unpopular because it 's proven wrong so far , it might work in another countries ( i doubt it though ) but not in spain . 
  you ca n't blame our unemployment rates on the labour market regulations being too rigid , when basically every single company do n't follow them . 
  union agreements ? 
  they are basically wet paper since the 2010 labour market reform , and i doubt i need to tell you about how fraudulent it 's to renew temporary contracts repeatedly or false freelancers contracting practises . 
  what did our governments do wrong ? 
  well , maybe killing entire sectors of the labour market like renewable energies , or basically allowing energy prices to strangle most businesses economies . 
  how can anyone be charged 25 $ / month with 0.00 electrical consumption ? 
  or using eu funds/debt emissions to never reform our productive model , even though that 's been an elections slogan since i was a child . 
  sweden , norway and finland together amount for more than 20 million of people . 
  if you put it that way it does n't look `` sustainable just because of the size '' . 
  if they can have such welfare is because their taxes are better employed than in other countries , and their politicians do n't kill the internal demand slashing salaries . 
  of course , trying to attach unemployment problems when rates are ~ 7 % helps a lot in terms of sustainability of a welfare system . 
  spain on the welcome side ? 
  well , maybe some cities with left-wing majors . 
  but i really doubt spain with rajoy as pm wants to take any refugee ( even if he stated otherwise , which i really doubt ) . 
  he is more of the `` shoot them '' mentality . 
  but you are not talking about refugees . 
  whether those are all war refugees or not is another question . 
  some countries are basically saying `` quota my ass '' to the refugees , like if this was n't an eu problem . 
  thus my question to whom support this stance . 
  those who are accepted are to be sent to a country in the eu , so we still require quotas . 
  border countries or germany ca n't take them all . 
  yeah , better do nothing and pretend they are not there , or waiting for a pure entity to solve the day . 
  that has worked wonderfully so far . 
  please , i have asked a serious question . 
  i agree all this is unfair to schengen citizens and legal migrants , but taking some of them back to those camps can be quite difficult because the lack of id 's . 
  and what if they came from a now isis zone ? 
  fair enough , any proposal ? 
  but they are already in , thus my question of what to do ** now ** . 
  and you ca n't solve a problem of starvation by saying `` do n't starve '' . 
  i ask for a real solution . 
  i throw a legit and serious question to some in r/europe . 
  why are you against refugee 's quota ? 
  i know it does n't solve the root of the problem or anything in the long term , ** but something must be done now ** . 
  the problem is you can not simply ride them to morocco and dump them because many of them are from other countries , or do n't carry id . 
  unless you take a different approach : morocco did n't do a thing to stop them , so here you have all of them back . 
  but it 's not like spain has a past of facing morocco regime . 
  go to syria with a global sane-countries alliance and force them to live in a civilized way . 
  there 's no other way . 
  leaving them to their own devices does n't work . 
  there 's no tradition of democracy there . 
  developed countries must colonize these lands again and enforce order . 
  then maybe after 2 centuries they 'll be capable of handling freedom . 
  that has worked wonderfully in this and the previous centuries . 
  this will keep happening as long as there are 1st and 2nd class countries in the eu . 
  and abolishing schengen for countries in the borders ( as it is suggested ) will backfire big time , no matter how big is the wall you build , it wo n't stop them . 
  so instead of throwing euros to border countries and scream `` do your job to stop them from going to my country '' or dublin ii bullshit they should think of a real solution in common . 
  not supporting rebellions ( syria ) or looting ( congo ) in their country of origin would be a good start . 
  funny , i met an old friend yesterday who is working in cardiff . 
  he came to spain on vacations , and our plan for tonight is probably like yours . 
  u/andy18cruz you 've heard the crowd . 
  surrender !, 
  it 's funny to see the same news every couple of weeks , always with a different country each time . 
  never ... ... unless you give some * francesinhas * in return . 
  i had lost faith in the german redditors after the greek negotiations , but the comments in this one and other immigration threads has made me recover it . 
  charging people for crimes they have n't done just because you think they eventually would works much worse . 
  isis and other extremists groups can live thanks to that hate speech . 
   i do n't quite get your argument because hartz4 could be seen as a form of austerity . 
  that 's probably correct from a german point of view , with all due respect , provided your unemployment subsidies were higher then . 
  however , compare the hartz4 with the reforms the troika ask to countries like spain or greece in matters like unemployment subsidies , pensions and such . 
  i can summarise them quickly : 1 . 
  wage depression to improve competitiveness ( who said produce high value goods ? ) . 
  some even ask for the total removal of the minimum salary ( ~ 670 $ / month , ~ 4.19 $ / h ) . 
  cut down unemployment subsidies , which are to put it simply , 50 % of your previous income with a maximum of 1084 $ and 24 months . 
  lower minimum pensions or even their removal . 
  we are talking about less than 400 $ / month . 
  nothing to say about early retired with 2k + pensions ( miners , military , ... ) . 
  cheaper sacking costs . 
  funny , because right now it 's literally free in the first 6 months . 
  guess what , the median contract in spain lasts exactly that . 
  in none of these cases people are entitled any kind of help to pay the bills , accommodation or the likes . 
  all those reforms are directed to destroy an already dying part of our society , not helping them . 
  more than 2 million of our unemployed do n't have any kind of income . 
  zero . 
  believe it or not , but such thing as the hartz4 in spain or greece would be seen as miraculous . 
  ps : i used data from my country ( spain ) . 
  for me there is a huge difference between formation offered and what the job market demands . 
  : why having so much nursery schools ( or available vacancies in each one ) when we are literally exporting them to norway , uk and such ? 
  why not temporarily reduce their number so less graduate each year to adapt to demand ? 
  and this can probably be applied to almost every sector or level of education . 
  that 's endemic in spain . 
  being registered for 4h/day and work 8h is just the norm in most of the services sector . 
  and there is literally zero effort from the government to stop that for obvious reasons ( better unemployment data and less social tension ) . 
   the 20 + % unemployment is not as high in reality - otherwise we would be in a very delicated problem with crime figures rising over the board ( it 's on a record low ) , or in a revolutionary status ( politics are changing which is very good but not getting out of hand ... we did n't get neo-nazis here for example ) .
