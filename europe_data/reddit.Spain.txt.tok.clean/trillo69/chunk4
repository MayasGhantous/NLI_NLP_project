  the reason why there are n't riots is just how much support people get from their families , unemployment rate is actually around 24 % according to the epa which takes into account people doing courses , workshops , or those who simply are n't registered . 
  your statement is based on the premise that people who work in the submerged economy is registered as unemployed , and most of the time is actually the opposite : they see the inem as useless and do n't renew their registry . 
  we do have neo-nazis , there are many examples of their demonstrations or `` national '' food banks . 
  they simply do n't make a lot of noise because they side with the current government conservative mind ; they get financial support too through foundations like faes and similar . 
  saying we do n't have them is simply a ( na\u00efve or not ) lie . 
  that 's something that really hurts me as european . 
  germany and the ez keep pushing austerity measures and wage depression as prescription against the crisis . 
  in the meantime , germany has the hartz iv and a minimal wage of 8.5 $ / hr ; other countries have similar measures which really seem to improve the economy in the middle or long term . 
  in the case of greece which has a real social emergency , a basic income against poverty is just a far promise in the bailout agreement . 
  do as i say , not as i do . 
  i would gladly eat my words if someone cares to explain me how that 's not fucking cynical . 
  are salaries in uk actually decreasing ? 
  that 's not what i am told by my friends working in the uk , but exactly the opposite . 
  [ medium salary uk ] ( http://www.datosmacro.com/mercado-laboral/salario-medio/uk ) [ gdp per population uk ] ( http://www.datosmacro.com/pib/uk ), 
  that 's not true , everyone bitches when we shoot at them so they drown in the mediterranean . 
  it 's quite different and less cynical . 
  * edit : grammar *, 
  i have a lot of stitches , went yesterday to play a football match with friends and realised i am in very bad shape , i barely can walk !, 
  i managed to score a hattrick but we lost 6-5 . 
  and i am learning about trading and forex , so i hope i can make an extra with my savings in a future , since state pension seem unlikely when i retire in 40 years . 
  i still freak out with the fact that you can earn money with the bankrupt of a company . 
  tortilla de patata ? 
  when it comes to language most of us are way more worried of how bad we are at english compared to other european countries . 
  we do take some pride of how big our empire was once , or how many good literature has been written in spanish . 
  it 's a very rich language in terms of vocabulary and that makes for a very beautiful platform for written art . 
  even least enthusiasts of reading would agree on this . 
  unless they are `` franco franco , que tiene el culo blanco ... '' . 
  i think most people know better these lyrics than any other . 
  to be honest , if there is any cent destined to change the national anthem , i 'd rather it is to make a new and instrumental one . 
  i simply do n't like it from a musical point of view ( i like the russia and gb one ) as for the lyrics there will never be consensus about them , too many fresh wounds after a civil war and 40 years of dictatorship . 
   i 'm sure you have better  we do n't !, 
   pretty generous with other peoples ' money . 
  92 % of the members of my household believe that estonians ' pay should be doubled . 
  see , it 's not that hard to do !, 
  well , it 's that or lending more . 
  so here the generous option with other 's money is not doing a haircut . 
  and na\u00efve , because a new bailout wo n't be paid back in its entirety . 
  is funny , many of us need subtitles too . 
  yes and no . 
  we had to get rid of the * cajas * ( banks with public participations and politicians as counsellors , for those who might wonder ) , but it was handed very poorly since it was allowed the creation of bankia by merging already bankrupt entities without cleaning assets . 
  what might happen or not ( probably the latter ) to rato or those involved in the huge scam that was bankia wo n't change all the billions that `` re-financing '' has costed the taxpayer . 
  i mean , even if everyone involved is sentenced to jail , we wo n't see a penny back . 
   on the plus side the reform effort has actually been a bit more robust than you suggest . 
  particularly pensions and the financial sectors have been dealt with . 
  you say the labour reforms contributed to depressed wages and low employment but spain will reap the fruit of this in the years to come for sure . 
  as for the pensions , i remember both the banks bailout ( especially bankia ) and interests of our public debt emissions have swallowed those savings several times . 
  about future fruits of this reforms , who knows , but i really doubt we will ever recover all the ` know-how ' lost of closed companies or the massive brain leak of young professional of these years . 
  the massive cut downs in r+d wo n't help either . 
  trust me , i want spain to overcome this crisis , but none of the necessary reforms ( tax evasion , corruption , illegal hiring practises ) have been faced . 
  and they are much more needed than lower more already low salaries . 
  i 've made a quick graph showing inter annual variation of the unemployment rate in spain . 
  the source is the epa ( active population inquiry ) performed by our national statistical institute ( ine ) , you can find it [ here ] ( http://www.ine.es/dyngs/inebase/es/operacion.htm?c=estadistica_c&amp;cid=1254736176918&amp;menu=ultidatos&amp;idp=1254735976595 ) [ annual variation of unemployment rate in spain ] ( http://imgur.com/6eld9m3 ) you can see that the decreasing tendency is broken in q3-2010 and q4-2011 , exactly the dates of our two labour market reforms . 
  it 's easy to affirm the direct effect of both in the unemployment rates , unlike their long-term effects . 
  ps : please forgive the format and possible grammar mistakes , and focus on the data , which is accurate and from an official source . 
   * the policies that tilted a labor market even more in favor of companies might have contributed to the high level of unemployment . 
  it had been argued that french labor market resists crisis better to crisis because it is harder to lay off people , at the cost of less flexibility overall . 
  the only thing achieved by the labour market reform was make possible for companies to substitute an experienced worked with a high salary for an inexperienced one with half the salary . 
  thus if you are 55 yo and you are fired you are likely to never join the labour market again . 
  unemployment rates were starting to improve until the reforms were performed in 2010 and 2012 . 
  before this last reform ( jan ' 12 ) , unemployment rate was 22.85 % , two years later it was 26.03 % according to the epa ( which covers registered and unregistered unemployment ) . 
  you ca n't say they worked properly . 
  what structural reforms ? 
  aside from the labour market reform , which contributed to unemployment sky rocketing and salaries plummeting , nothing has been done . 
  * freelancers still have to pay 300 $ each month even if they have no income . 
  * creating a company in spain is still a nightmare which can easily take months and is much more expensive than in other countries . 
  * taxes are still so high they are chocking internal demand of goods due to a low available rent . 
  * unemployment rates between youth and older than 45 yo is higher than ever . 
  pray to god if you are 55 and get fired . 
  * energetic policy are still forcing infeasibility of renewable energies , penalising self-production . 
  we are the only country with a literal tax on the sun . 
  gdp growth might be the best in years , but spain still has the same structural problems and defects in his labour market and production model as it always has had . 
  add to this the general budgets for 2016 are completely infeasible bullshit , as every single economist in spain have pointed out . 
  seriously , once elections are gone and public investment goes back to normal numbers ( has anyone tried to look at public debt ratios ? ), 
  shit is going to get real . 
  * edit : grammar . 
  a few from spain : ** galicia : ** the stereotype says we hesitate a lot , there 's a said `` you never know if a galician is going up or down '' . 
  i disagree , but we do have the habit of answering a question with another question , e.g. 
  * `` why do you answer with a question ? '', 
  `` did i ? '' * . 
  and somehow due to our accent some people ( most of the time other galicians ) think we are dumb or peasants . 
  this is due to the dictatorship of franco ( 40 years after a civil war ) , as galician was spoken by the poor people , and god saved those who dare to not speaking spanish . 
  ** catalonia : ** it 's said they are stingy/pinchpenny . 
  i do n't know if it 's true , but there are good jokes thanks to it . 
  `` copper wire was created by two catalans pulling on a penny '' . 
  ** basques/bilbao ** they are stronger than chuck norris . 
  a basque only gets a cold if he wants , and they are born wherever they want . 
  this might be due to the cold climate in the region and how they smile at it . 
  it 's a source of good jokes too . 
  ** andalucia : ** the stereotype is they are lazy and are always on party . 
  it 's complete bullshit , on the same way as `` people do not work because they do n't want to '' . 
  an european decree which would harden jail sentences for economic crimes , including bribery and misuse of state funds . 
  politicians , bankers and companies that are judged guilty for those crimes pay a too low price for their acts , given the consequences they carry . 
  to show that is n't the case in spain in 25 % of the cases . 
  i think it 's cristal clear , and quite relevant information about temporal contracts in spain . 
  i never said you were wrong though . 
  however , someone pointed out in the thread the average duration of a temporal contract in spain is 6 months . 
  together with just a 6 % of new long-term contracts and the fact that you ca n't renew temporal contracts indefinitely ( without incurring in the illegality ) ca n't speak really well about our labour market . 
   there are currently 5.2 million registered unemployed in spain , according to the epa . 
  i wonder what 's the annual difference for the epa . 
  the last statistic by the ine ( our statistic national entity ) showed a 25 % of the new contracts had a duration shorter than a week .
