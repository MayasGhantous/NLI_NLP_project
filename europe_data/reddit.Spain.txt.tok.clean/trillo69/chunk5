  for temporal contracts , zero cost in the first 4-6 months ( trial period , no pre-notice either ) . 
  long term contracts are entitled a 20 day/year compensation in most of the cases , limited to 14 months . 
  i think the liquidity injections by the ecb , a low euro and oil prices and the public investment ( which sky rocketed the debt to 97 % gdp ) have much more to do with this data than any government reform . 
  i wonder what will happen once interest rates are raised again and the ecb credit shrinks again . 
   i am not saying anything about whether it makes political sense or not , but from an objective point of view , spain ** is ** _ stealing _ from them : there 's a net positive flow of money from catalonia to spain . 
  from an objective point of view i can say that number is explained because in a recession scenery , madrid and catalonia where able to pay more taxes than the regions with positive numbers , which are coincidentally the ones with worst unemployment rates ( and thus more expenses relative to incomes ) . 
  but hey , let 's just value a country 's issue without taking into account its political sense and let 's call it objective . 
  because why not . 
  ps : you 've guessed wrong . 
  i still do n't get why this is better than changing those treaties so this so called ` best option ' of a temporary grexit could actually happen . 
  the more i read about a temporary grexit , the more i see it like the dual-euro scheme varoufakis supposedly proposed . 
  it 's funny , you see here the same answers than in the `` worst city you 've visited '' thread . 
  except napoli , no one has mentioned napoli here . 
  it 's been published in many other newspapers , el mundo ( which is quite far from my taste ) just happened to be [ the first google result ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=aportacion+catalu%c3%b1a+al+estado+2015&amp;rlz=2y3txls_enes0651es0652google.mako.occam&amp;oq=aportacion+catalu%c3%b1a+al+estado+2015&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.2348j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;espv=1&amp;ie=utf-8 ), 
  it 's stupid to say madrid is stealing catalonia if they are actually paying more taxes ( have a more negative balance than you ) . 
  and of course is negative , would it make any sense to have a positive balance in the richer regions ? 
  that would mean way poorer regions are financing richer ones . 
  anyway , i 've already explained my point clearly in the previous post . 
  my point is not giving false information on purpose to someone who asks a legitimate and serious question . 
  there are plenty of ways to justify why people in catalonia wants the independence without spreading false information . 
   ** it 's common knowledge that we give way more money to madrid than we receive ( about 16.000 million $ per year ) . 
  ** it 's no common knowledge nor true , it 's simply a lie catalan right-wing politicians have repeated over and over again ( * `` espa\u00f1a nos roba/spain is stealing us '' * ) so people would n't talk about their ineptitudes or corruption . 
   the second one is how spain treats us . 
  it 's common knowledge that we give way more money to madrid than we receive ( about 16.000 million $ per year ) . 
  to put that into perspective , people here are very angry with the austerity measures that the catalan government have taken , and all these austerity measures combined have saved about 7.000 million $ . 
  so , if we were independent , the economic crisis would be over soon . 
  a few years ago we tried to negotiate with madrid , but to this day they keep saying no to everything we propose . 
  of course , the unstability created by the independence would last a few years , but after that we would be much better economically . 
  that 's complete bullshit . 
  fiscal balance : * catalu\u00f1a ( -7.439 m ) , madrid ( -19.015 m ) * http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2015/07/22/55aea97fe2704ed7478b45a8.html blame your own catalan governors if you feel scammed , the same fascist that recently have became independence idols . 
  the same that are facing trials after it 's been proven they became rich thanks to corruption . 
   the third and final one is the hate we receive from spain . 
  not from its citizens ( most of them are actually awesome , and i have quite a lot of friends in different places of spain ) , but rather from its official institutions and media . 
  nothing to argue about the crappy spanish media or politicians , but the hate you receive from many spanish citizens is due to my previous statement . 
  stop claiming your problems are our fault . 
  do you think your communications are bad ? 
  come to galicia , we 'll take a train from coru\u00f1a to vigo , or the highway , ** i pay ( even with higher $ / km and lower salaries ) ** . 
  then compare to your infrastructures . 
  honestly , i 'd support the referendum , i could n't care less whether catalu\u00f1a becomes a different country and i honestly think people should have the right to vote to decide it . 
  but please , i beg you , stop blaming others for your own fucking problems because then you wo n't find any empathy at all . 
  there are european citizens who decided to travel to syria to fight ** against ** is . 
  can anyone eli5 why these people can also face jail sentences for that ? 
  ( serious question ), 
  many just survive thanks to government aid ( which are actually hard to qualify for them , and it 's ~ 400 $ / month per family ) , as well as doing small fixes in homes or precarious jobs without contract . 
  charity is also present to help many to cover basic necessities like basic meals or clothes , especially for the youngest . 
  well , so far i ca n't say they were wrong , not at least in this country . 
  most of us ( under 30 ) that decided to go to college are in the same situation , with the difference that we have n't earn a dime these years ( or way less than them ) . 
  even today , i know a lot of people ( engineers , nurses , biologists ) who decided to join the navy because they ca n't find a job , or the ones they are offered are in worse conditions than a novice private . 
  the government just do n't care if a construction worker earns three times a nurse salary ( in private sector ) , or that many decide to migrate as long as that lowers the unemployment rates . 
   look , this is pretty basic : any market ( not just the labor market ) is efficient when it optimizes the behavior of producers and consumers . 
  take spain in the 90s , the country was growing like crazy but could n't reach full unemployment ( around 4-5 % depending on the country ) when other countries could ( see germany , et al. ), 
  that means the market is badly structured . 
  there are no two ways to go about it . 
  i completely agree , i think we had 7 % of unemployment rate in the best years of the boom . 
  that percentage means crisis in many european countries . 
   are companies unable to find qualified workers ? 
   no , there 's just not enough jobs ( which is probably not due to one factor but a myriad : crappy labor legislation , crappy production system , crappy economic planning , and so on ad infinitum ) now , nordic countries do n't all have exactly the same model but for example in denmark , the labor market is really flexible while maintaining the social security net for the unemployed ( the called it flexicurity or some such thing ) . 
  so having a competitive , dynamic labor market is not mutually exclusive with having social security as you are trying to imply . 
  it promotes social mobility and competitiveness . 
  i agree , i really thought that was your point . 
  but let 's admit that 's not the model liberals in spain ( hah , liberals my ass ) would like to implant . 
  they are more on the `` who does n't work is because he does n't want and his laziness '' . 
   your other point was salaries : salaries reflect productivity : if you produce a car , your productivity per hour is higher than if you produce a t-shirt . 
  germany has vw ( for example ) , spain has inditex , mercadona , maybe respsol , not a lot of r&d going on there . 
  so you either change the model and start investing in order to produce , high-end , high-margins stuff ( for which you need a systematic investment in r&d for generations ) or you produce cheap shit with low crappy salaries like bangladesh yeah , i put a very similar example in another reply ( please refer to the parent comment ) . 
  and as i said it has a direct impact on the internal demand due to the low incomes available after taxes . 
  thanks for having elaborated your statement now , your first comment had given me a completely different impression on the matter . 
   i get that all of these things suck , but in the uk we have all of these things and our economy and labour market are either near the best or the best in europe . 
  i do n't buy into the `` lazy spaniard '' stereotype , but there must be something that attracts all these businesses to the uk and not spain , and i do n't buy the language is the only differentiator . 
  that 's a good question . 
  we usually are told that our labour costs are too high , and that 's probably right but caused by a lack of added value industry ( the beer and tortilla example ) . 
  if i were a foreign investor with my sight in spain , my biggest fear would be the weak internal demand of goods , you ca n't rely only on exports , a weak euro and low oil prices . 
  and it do n't know how is this handled in other countries , but our governors like to put the bills under the rug , literally forcing many companies to go bankrupt because of the huge delays in the payments . 
   appreciate your answer though , i ca n't say all of it makes sense as an explanation for the serial under-performance of the spanish economy and employment stats , but some of it does  i wish i were able to provide you with a better one . 
  that problem is entirely different from a bad labour market design , spain ca n't blame the unemployment rates in hiring flexibility . 
  if such was the case , how can nordic countries manage to do it ? 
  they have way stronger union agreements and protection . 
  are companies unable to find qualified workers ? 
  please , we have a 23 % of unemployment rate , they have plenty of professionals from whichever sector they want . 
  maybe some of them should stop looking for unicorns or start paying decent salaries . 
  how is people going to buy good if many are poor even working full time ? 
  the government and the main party in the opposition ( which have been alternating in the government since we have democracy ) have proven to be corrupted to the core . 
  but explaining every single case would take ages , just google `` caso malaya '' , '' eres andaluc\u00eda '' or `` g\u00fcrtel '' to check how many billions of euros just those 3 cases mean . 
  another problem is the current effort of the government in stopping the development and implantation of renewal sources of energy . 
  an entire sector in which spain was leader has been destroyed , a sector which would have been able to absorb many work force from the construction boom of 1996-2008 . 
  why this effort ? 
  well , electric companies are a nice retirement for politics . 
  i think every single former industry ministry is now working for these companies . 
  it 's hard for me to synthesise all problems in a single post , but the labour market is not the problem , at least not the part that attains the worker . 
  underpaid professionals , non paid overtime , non remunerated interns ( this is legal , and it 's a plague ) , contractual fraud and excessive taxes especially for freelancers are a much better explanation . 
  the problem of competitiveness in spain does n't have its root in salaries ( median salary is 21k $ per year , 17k $ for women according to ine ) , but the value of the goods and services we produce . 
  you ca n't expect to compete with a german bmw if you sell ` tortilla ' and beer , which seems to be the main focus of current and previous governments . 
  if by labour market problems you mean forcing people to work 50h per week and paying 40 ( and poorly ) , then i agree . 
  otherwise , stop repeating the same `` it 's hard to fire employees '' lie , as every single temporary contract ( which are the vast majority ) can be terminated without pre-notice and compensation in the first 6 months . 
  all depends on your profile and experience , especially the latter , because the offers with low experience requirements are almost non existent , or whose conditions are insulting . 
  how am i supposed to live with 600 $ ( full time and non paid overtime ) in a city where a room can cost 500 $ per month ? 
  and it can be worse , there 's a lot of people working for free ( lawyers , journalists ) just to have experience in their field . 
  i 'm talking about fully graduates , with master studies and such . 
  this kind of things are not shown in employment statistics , and they are quite common . 
  back on track of your questions .
