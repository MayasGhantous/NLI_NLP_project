  now i do n't feel so bad about missing birmingham . 
  i got 42 . 
  from the first 20 i missed milan , manchester and katowice . 
  as it was on 2008 , 2009 , 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , innit ? 
  according to your source , only in the uk , mostly in upper classes and , it is not said , but as far as i know , [ during only a few decades . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/circumcision#modern_times ), 
  to be fair , cutting off the clitoris foresking is considered female genital mutilation and forbidden in most of the world . 
  by the way , what western european countries routinely used circumcision ? 
  any source ? 
  what about a postcard from barcelona ? 
  in catalan , of course . 
  al around europe , yes . 
  in alice in wonderland the rabbit 's clock is 5 minuts early . 
  that 's because carrol was on oxford , -0 h05 from london .

  i guess you have no idea what jihad means , do n't you ? 
  it means effort . 
  who supports the massacre of civilians ? 
  aside `` je suis une bombe '' could be translated as `` i 'm cool '' and is a normal little kids t-shirt .

  the idea is that if traditionally ( and nowadays , in older generations ) there are more women is because , in great part , many young men , lots more than women , have died in wars . 
  easier to understand , now ? 
  different orders of magnitude , we are talking about . 
   on a national level there are slightly more women than men you must realize we are talking about 25-29 year old . 
  there are more men born than women , and if in total population there are more women is due to higher longevity and wars . 
  but 25-29 have not had any wars and still are not affected by longevity . 
  so , probably , there are more men than women . 
   the map clearly shows how women move to the cities to find new opportunities while men tend to stay behind in the rural areas . 
  so , wales is not a rural area , but catalonia is ? 
  alpes-de-haute-provence is not rural ? 
  is it even less rural than marseille ? 
  are graub\u00fcnden the less rural part of switzerland , or maybe the opposite ? 
  what might be true in scandinavia might not be true elsewhere . 
   none of these figures are true today by far . 
  it 's wishful thinking all over again . 
  wishful thinking might be denying the truth , denying the data every economical study shows . 
  i guess that , if we are so bad economically , spain would be better without us , is n't it ? 
  so , better to have an extra layer ? 
  i do n't understand you . 
   i hate to be that guy but catalonia is in technical bankruptcy and its government needed a spanish bail out . 
  i 'd also hate to be the guy that tells lies and half truths . 
  if i took 8 % of your gdp every year for decades , if you got back only 60 % of your taxes , you 'd be also in techical bankruptcy , or probably worse . 
  in fact , this is one of the main reasons to want to leave . 
  to skip bankrupcy !, 
  no , it does n't . 
  what you define is `` legal '' , no `` legitimate '' . 
  there are illegal legitimate things . 
  as an extreme example , to make it easy to understand , helping a slave to scape from a plantation in georgia , early 18c was legitimate , but illegal . 
   sostres ' articles in the avui , where supposed to be a parody of a posh catalan bourgeois who think that living south the diagonal is living in the 3rd world , outside barcelona there is the jungle , that anyone who do n't vote ciu is a retarded , and of course only poor people speaks spanish etc. 
  it was an interpretation of a character so exaggerated that it was obvious that it should not be taken seriously , an `` esperpento '' . 
  if he was n't in reality a posh catalan bourgeois living north the diagonal , i would be able to believe that was a parody . 
  i guess they are called mostly photographers , or maybe communication experts . 
  have you ever looked at a poll ? 
  also , look for the last bar\u00f2metre . 
  i think erc votes were even higher !, 
  no , just the colour for today 's chain . 
  there 's no colour . 
  today they decided to use yellow as experts said it 's the best colour to be seen from the air in contrast with the asphalt of the roads . 
  never heard about yellow being bad luck in spain . 
  for sure not in catalonia . 
  i 've heard , however , it being not used by theatre actors as it was the colour moli\u00e8re was wearing when he died on stage . 
  not at all . 
  they decided to use yellow as experts said it 's the best colour to be seen from the air in contrast with the asphalt of the roads . 
  sorry , but this time you do n't know what you are talking about . 
  not an `` online poll '' at all . 
  las cuotas se aplican en funci\u00f3n de la poblaci\u00f3n general y no en funci\u00f3n de la poblaci\u00f3n internauta . '' ] ( http://www.cadenaser.com/csermedia/cadenaser/media/201309/11/espana/20130911csrcsrnac_1_pes_pdf.pdf ) and , anyway , those are the same result of all of last polls , online or otherwise . 
  ** you know czech numbers are not true , do n't you ? 
  ** total amounts would be ok , but `` per capita '' are wrong , as you divide beer drank in than place by people living there when , at least in this case , a lot of that beer is drank by tourists ( mostly germans ) on holydays , so they are not on the divisor . 
   having the chain along the proposed borders to spain would be more aesthetically pleasing . 
  the emphasis is not at all in creating borders or in creating distance with spaniards , but on regaining our freedoms and showing unity . 
  also , in fact , all the new borders with spain will have catalan speakers also on the other side of the border . 
  yes , as paella as the cookware is documented long before the dish existed and the dish is correctly and originally called `` arr\u00f2s a la paella '' , as there are , for example , `` arr\u00f2s a la cassola '' or `` arr\u00f2s al forn '' . 
  spaniards are usually nice people as far as you do n't talk about decentralization , national rights , catalan language and culture and a few more things . 
  what relation has this with what you said before , that the cookware 's name comes after the dish ? 
  i 've met no valencian , in person or online , who thinks the dish gives name to the cookware . 
  where do you get your information from ? 
  the onion ? 
  el mundo today ? 
  by the way , you can write whatever you want on your hover text . 
  republic of catalonia ? 
  during richelieu time , it was . 
  when you profited to get independent . 
  never been recognized ? 
  this flag is centuries older than the one you are using !, 
  so , the first one is what here i 'd call ( literal translation ) sock coffee , and the second ( again translating ) american coffee . 
   eurotrash is not knowing the difference between `` caffe americano '' and american-style coffee . 
  what 's the difference , aside of one being italian and the other from the us ? 
  one of the few things i can say in basque : `` bi garagardoak , mesedez '' . 
  mine , because it 's the one i speak better ;-) aside , maybe italian , as it 's not hard to understand has no harsh weird sounds , and it seems it 's sang , not spoken . 
  i 've even read somewhere that the young turks where in fact jews on disguise ... 
   saying you can get a 3 bedroom place in the city centre for # 1200 is simply not true , it says 3040 $ , not # 1200 . 
  i do n't know exact exchange rate , but 3040 $ is , at least , # 2000 . 
  edit : the page translates currencies . 
  it is # 2600 .
