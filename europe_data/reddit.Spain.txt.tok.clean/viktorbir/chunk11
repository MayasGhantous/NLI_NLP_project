  also , the transportation is not at all # 55 , but # 120 . 
  where are you reading the data from ????? 
  here you have it again , [ now in pounds ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=spain&amp;city1=barcelona&amp;country2=united+kingdom&amp;city2=london&amp;displaycurrency=gbp ), 
  i have substracted the price of the flat from the income after taxes . 
  the data is from the previous link , the one you have already seen and we where talkinga about . 
  substract 1 bedroom flat outside city centre and 1 month transportation : * barcelona : 650 $ * london : 1140 $ london is still cheaper . 
  let 's try with 3 bedroom flat outside city centre : * barcelona : 350 $ * london : 330 $ so , the conclusion is that you must choose more carefully the accomodation in london , but if you do so , it is cheaper . 
  and the salaries in barcelona are affected by the fact they are salaries of people with a job , because about 20 % of people are jobless ... 
  i 've assumed the data is from london . 
  edit : [ comparison between barcelona and london ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=spain&amp;country2=united+kingdom&amp;city1=barcelona&amp;city2=london ) salary is about double . 
  prices are not . 
  so , earning a 50 % more and paying , what , 20 % more is a very low standard of living ? 
  worse infrastructure and longer ways . 
  almeria 's vegetables go along the coast , thru murcia , valencia and catalonia . 
  all valencian exports go thru catalonia . 
  it would be very inefficient to go thru basque country . 
  aside , the logical alternative would be not banning catalonia from joining the eu . 
   actually , that 's nonsense . 
  the division of debt is a different issue from the succession in title . 
  read the vienna conventions . 
   there would also be the question of who would pay the pensions of catalan pensioners , for instance ... catalan workers ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  why being kicked out of the eu ? 
  both parts keep all previous treaties . 
  so both are still in the eu . 
  since 1812 , yes catalonia has not been independent . 
  also not since 1714 . 
  but it was before , of course . 
  learn some history, 
  before confederating with aragon was not independent ? 
  while confedarate with aragon was not independent ? 
  while confedarated with aragon and this confederation confederated with castile , was it not independent ? 
  if not , spain is now even less independent now than catalonia was back then . 
   also , many business in catalonia have already stated they will leave if this happens , as they want to remain in european soil ( less taxes , euro coin , and so on ) . 
  this will destabilize the economy , rate agencies will drop catalonia to the lowest level , ... , you see the picture . 
  you 've been reading many right wing spanish newspapers , have n't you ? 
  so , you mean that exports , instead of by lorry or train will go by ship or by plane ? 
  or you mean they magically will build immediatly new alternative infrastructures ? 
  that 's since about 1812 , is n't it ? 
  so , spain is now not independent , as it is part of the eu , you mean , is n't it ? 
  otherwise , catalonia was independent . 
   newly independent countries would have to reapply for eu membership that depends . 
  if the state is divided , both parts are new states , but both inherit rights and duties from the old one . 
  so , `` new '' spain and catalonia would both be part of the eu , and would both share part of the `` old '' spain 's debt . 
  but , if there 's only a new state and the old one remains , the new inherits no right and no duty from the other one . 
  so , spain remains in the eu and still has to pay its debt , catalonia is outside the eu but has 0 debt . 
  first case would be like czecoslovakia split . 
  second like slovenia and yugoslavia . 
  that 's the typical spanish threat . 
  but there have been extraordinary ampliations , as that of eastern germany . 
  also , most commerce between spain and the rest of the eu goes thru catalonia , so in fact , they 'd would not want border taxes in the middle . 
  ( just a side note for / u/amil359 : not such a thing as `` catalonian '' , but catalan ; not `` catalina '' , but catalonia ), 
  do you realize they are talking about proportion ? 
  200 languages in 1/2 million people is a lot more than 800 in nyc . 
  as far as as beam is a * ray or collection of parallel rays emitted from the sun or other luminous body ; as , a beam of light , or of heat . 
  * beamer makes lots of sense as a projector . 
  as in any normal language ? 
  foto or fotografia is catalan for picture fot\u00f2graf the one who takes pictures . 
  same in most other european languages . 
   parking quite ok * a space or spaces in which a vehicle can be parked ; as , there is plenty of parking behind the store . 
  [ wordnet 1.5 ] *  spot proper english : * a short section or illustration ( as between radio or tv programs or in a magazine ) that is often used for advertising *  zapping proper english * to use a remote control to repeatedly change channels on a television . 
  *  crack proper english * of superior excellence ; having qualities to be boasted of ; as , a crack shot . 
  [ colloq . ], 
  [ 1913 webster ] one of our crack speakers in the commons . 
  *  jersey proper english * a close-fitting pullover shirt *  book more than a pseudoanglicism , a shortening of `` portfolio book '' also , i do n't get you differences between pub and club . 
  but it is english , not a pseudo-anglicism . 
  is beamer really not english ? 
  here we say `` projector '' , but i 'm sure i 've seen some technical text ( in english ? ), 
  saying beamer !, 
  we also have the smoking . 
  * jogging is called `` footing '' . 
  * a small kitchen/resting room in an office is called ... the `` office '' :-) * heavy metal becomes not metal , but `` heavy '' . 
  * fashion as an adjective ( this is very `` fashion '' ) * `` planning '' as schedule by the way , i 've heard `` know how '' pronounced as `` no house '' . 
  by the way , seeing that `` footing '' and `` smoking '' are so widespread in europe , is it possible that formerly their english meaning were jogging and tuxedo ? 
  edit : * [ footing vs jogging ] ( http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=footing%2c+jogging&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share= ) * [ wearing a smoking vs wearing a tuxedo ] ( http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=wearing+a+smoking%2c+wearing+a+tuxedo&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share= ) so , maybe not pseudoanglicisms . 
  i 'd say this might be considered latinism , not anglicism . 
  is n't `` light '' proper english ? 
  what 's your difference between a citizen and a national ? 
  and what i 'm saying is in a world subreddit , eu , spain and galician flag make sense . 
  in a europe subreddit , spain and galician flag make sense . 
  in a spain subreddit , galician flag makes sense . 
  so my earth flag is the earth flag ? 
  by the way , uzbekistan flag is widely recognized , otherwise it would not appear on an atlas or people knowledgeable on the subject would n't agree it represents the country . 
  i can create an earth flag , but if it is not widely recognized as the earth flag , my intention does n't matter . 
  if you are a manu supporter , in a general sports subreddit it would make sense to show a `` soccer fan '' badge , but in a soccer subreddit `` soccer fan '' would be silly , better `` manu supporter '' . 
  in / r/europe it makes not much sense . 
  in some wider subreddit , maybe , but here , unless there 's some very special reason , i do n't think it would serve the idea of using badges . 
  in fact , it is the flag of the council of europe ( coe ) and the european union ( eu ) . 
  not the whole europe belong to them . 
  is span better recognised than denmark ? 
  or than switzerland ? 
  also , for example , maltese , is an official language in the eu . 
  catalan is n't . 
  this is not the kind of recognition we like . 
  about the bailout , this is an argument pro independence !, 
  why did we have to apply for it ? 
  of the taxes paid in catalonia about 40 % do n't come back . 
  that 's the equivalent to 8 % of the gdp , or about 16000m $ . 
  with just half of this money back we would n't need any bailout and , on top , no cut should have been done to any public service . 
  i 'm still waiting for the anti independence side to show some cons .
