  not fud , real cons . 
  the only answer we get are insults ( after this booing , twitt by a high level spanish diplomat : `` fucking catalans . 
  they deserve nothing '' ) , threats ( `` there will be a boycott to catalan products , you 'll lose 50 % of your exports '' ) and lies ( `` you 'll be out of the euro '' -- as if andorra , kosovo , monaco , were not in the euro ! ) . 
  anyway ... would you like to be ruled by the spanish government ? 
  neither do us . 
  what you do n't hear under the booing is the spanish anthem played during the barcelona 2013 15th fina world championships . 
  what people sings later is the catalan anthem . 
  i hope , after independence , things are calmed down and this anthem provokes the same non reaction as any other anthem . 
  when i was a kid , not even a single mention . 
   and it has n't been for at least 20-25 years more about at least 35 . 
  my sister was born on '66 and did n't learn them . 
   the civil war and franco ( 1936-1975 ) good to see things have changed . 
  when i was a kid almost nothing was told about ... well almost anything xx century . 
  here , not . 
  no extra ingredients . 
  go to a delicatessen shop and buy some salted butter . 
  quite a difference . 
  what about the flag during the [ kalmar union ? 
  * hamlet * vikings * cinema , specially dogma and lars von trier * butter is salted * butter cookies * christiania * lego * the king wearing the jewish badge during ww2 * greenland , feroe * that big dog * little mermaid, 
  wait till we get independent . 
  why does n't apply ? 
  what 's the difference ? 
  the head of state is the queen of england . 
  also , in catalan they are `` copr\u00ednceps '' and in english co-princes . 
  of course . 
  and canada , australia and other commonwealth countries should n't be on a world version . 
  and by the way , the co-princes of andorra are the french president and the bishop of la seu d'urgell . 
  where many means less than half of them ? 
  a per region map would be much more interesting . 
  masses of 30m people or more make no sense . 
  why the fuck do they use alfabetic order of the countries ' names in their local official form , but then they translate it into english ? 
  it makes no sense !, 
  denmark  germany  estonia  ireland  greece  spain, 
  what is a `` pizzasalad '' ? 
  on page n. 18 ( 20 on the pdf ) , in spain they wrote catalan twice under two names ( catalan and valencian ) and forgot to add occitan ( official in catalonia ) . 
  i did n't see the semivowels , and i still do n't see nasal semivowels anywhere . 
  and although some consider nasal vowels just allophones , this would be 35 sounds ( 37 including those nasal semivowels ) * [ swedish  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_phonology ) 18 consonants + 18 vowels = 36 sounds * [ armenian  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_phonology ) 30 consonants + 6 vowels = 36 sounds * [ breton  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/breton_phonology ) 25 consonants + 11 vowels = 36 sounds * [ english  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english_phonology ) 24 consonants + 12/14 vowels = 36/38 sounds * [ french  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_phonology ) 20 consonants + 13 oral vowels + 4 nasal vowels = 37 sounds . 
  * [ albanian  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albanian_phonology ) 30 consonants + 7 vowels = 37 sounds * [ russian  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_phonology ) 32 consonants + 6 vowels ( + lots of allophones ! ), 
  = 38 sounds * [ ukrainian  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_phonology ) 32 consonants + 6 vowels ( + lots of allophones ! ), 
  = 38 sounds * [ polish  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_phonology ) 31 consonants + 6 oral vowels + 2 nasal vowels = 39 sounds * [ norwegian  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norwegian_phonology ) 23 consonants + 16 vowels = 39 sounds * [ danish  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_phonology ) 21 consonants + 20 vowels = 41 sounds * [ belarusian  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belarusian_phonology ) 36 consonants + 6 vowels = 42 sounds * [ german  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_phonology ) 27 consonants + 17 vowels = 44 sounds * [ irish  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_phonology ) 33 consonants + 11 oral vowels ( + some consider nasal vowels not allophones ) = 44 sounds * [ bulgarian  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgarian_phonology ) 37 consonants + 8 vowels = 45 sounds so , nothing special about portuguese , sorry . 
  a ) it 's not `` catalonian '' but `` catalan '' . 
  i guess you are not `` portugalian '' :-) b ) last opinion polls say in a referendum there would be a result of about 3/5 pro independence , 2/5 against . 
  so i guess you can say it is a very supported movement . 
  last 11 september ( our national day ) , out of 7,5 m population , about 1m ( lowest stimations , highest say 1,5 m ) demonstrated on the streets of barcelona claiming for independence . 
  well , you had 12 years of peace to regroup and organize . 
  if they had fighted you non stop and we had had those 12 years , do n't you think things might have been different ? 
  well , but you had 12 years of peace to prepare yourself !, 
  if the thing is more phonemes than spanish , yes , everyone has more phonemes than spanish !, 
  but they said most phonemes in europe . 
  also , about diphtongs , i think in spanish they have 14 , and some triphtongs . 
  but diphtongs are not different phonemes . 
  well , the flag might have been a hint ... 
  i do n't know whether historically it makes sense , whether it was really possible . 
  that 's not the context we are talking about . 
  it 's about the european 30 years war which in catalonia became la guerra dels segadors and in portugal the war that led to their independence . 
  it was not practical for spaniards to have two wars , one on the west and another on the east at the same time , so they concentrated fighting against catalonia and france ( richelieu times ) . 
  at some times it was more than one colony , but for decades , before the independence it was just o estado do brasil , and talking about relations with former colonies when you are just talking about relations with brazil sounds weird , to me . 
  i agree !, 
  i excuse you , because you are wrong . 
  i could say you have used also `` it 's '' incorrectly , when quoting what i was quoting ... 
   a politician said once that in a certain moment of history spain should have kept portugal and leave catalonia . 
  dunno if it makes any sense . 
  i do n't know if this makes sense , but it would have been great :-), 
  not always independent . 
  and , if you allow non continuous independence , i guess many other countries can be considered older . 
  by the way , andorra has been independent since charles the great times ... and san marino exists since the first year of 4th century . 
  iceland is from the 9th century . 
  same for denmark , sweden and norway . 
  any source ? 
  according to [ wikipedia  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_language#phonology ) `` there is a maximum of 9 oral vowels and 19 consonants '' total 28 . 
  [ catalan , as an example  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_phonology ) 8 vowels and 22/26 consonants ( 26 if you count affricates as different consonants ) . 
  total 30/34 . 
  * paying your coffee , and another one for anyone who 'll come later . 
  claveis revolution . 
  * ancient sailors / empire . 
  * cod fish . 
  * i can understand them if they talk to me , not to each other . 
  they understand my invented portuguese ( mostly catalan with a portuguese accent , and whenever a word in catalan is not similar to the spanish one , go with the spanish one , as in speak : catalan parlar , spanish hablar ) . 
  * they are independent thanks to us ( spain could n't fight two wars at once , west and east , and concentrated fighting us ) * ... ps . 
  * `` it maintains good relations with it 's former colonies in south america '' * colonies ? 
  i thought they only had one colony in south america , brazil . 
  what are the other ones ? 
  and karelia a republic in russia ... 
  \u00c5land is n't also a country , but is on the list . 
  almost the same about greenland . 
  are the inuit speaking greenlanders more nordic than fino-ugric speaking karelians ? 
  what about karelia ? 
  and s\u00e1pmi ? 
  then , you were not answering me , i guess . 
  i was asking the guy who said `` ethnic russians are descended from swedes '' how those ( germanic ) swedes / varangians became slavic , and you answered me they were always slavic ... 
  varangians were a germanic people , not slavic . 
  how come did they become slavic ? 
  and by ethnic do you mean something as genetical ? 
  in catalan newspapers there are news about this . 
  the shape of catalan is quite wrong . 
  also , why do you mix catalan with arpitan ( franco-proven\u00e7al ) ? 
  the colour does not even appear where arpitan is spoken !, 
  also , castilian is the dialect of spanish spoken in castile . 
  better say spanish . 
  otherwise , add other dialects .
