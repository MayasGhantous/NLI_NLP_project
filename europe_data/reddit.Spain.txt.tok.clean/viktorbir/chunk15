  i think we have half a dozen bears on the pyrenees . 
  boars . 
  maybe some wolf . 
  savage dogs . 
  jelly fish . 
  maybe twice a year a shark is spotted . 
  a few venomous snakes * ( malpolon monspessulanus , natrix natrix , macroprotodon cucullatus , vipera latastei , vipera aspis ) . 
  * mediterranean black widow . 
  yellow scorpion . 
  nothing really dangerous, 
  because in english ( and most european languages ) s is a * voiceless alveolar sibilant , * but in spanish ( and catalan , and other iberan languages ) it is * voiceless alveolar * *** retracted *** * sibilant * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiceless_alveolar_fricative, 
   catalan - despite supposedly being mix of spanish and french , excuse me ????????????????????????? 
  wales is a state and catalonia is n't ? 
  of course !, 
  how could i not get it !, 
  how many birds are there in 25 metres ? 
  fact ? 
  what condition does wales fulfill that catalonia does n't ? 
  i 'm not trying to prove wales is not a country . 
  wales is a country , of course !, 
  but i do n't get how come he states wales is , but catalonia not . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/country per cert , com a curiositat , country ve del llat\u00ed contrata , contrada !, 
  just curiosity . 
  who is wales president of prime minister ? 
  when were the last elections to wales parliament ? 
  an independent country , i guess you mean . 
  yeah , sometimes that 's the answer , but everytime fewer people say so . 
  in fact , lately , if you say you are from barcelona they tell you `` ah , catalan ? '', 
  your flag tells us what your country is . 
  not to what independent state it belongs . 
  so , either you change your flag , or you are saying catalonia is europe 's mexico . 
  it was a retorical question . 
  of course wales is a country . 
  as much as catalonia . 
  he was talking about wales compared to the uk , and i said the difference was even greater between catalonia and spain . 
  weirdly , he thinks talking about wales is ok , but not about catalonia . 
  i do n't get it . 
  i did n't doubt it . 
  same for catalonia . 
  you can google it yourself , too . 
  and wales is ? 
  excuse me ? 
  catalonia is europe 's mexico ??????????? 
  since when ? 
  i tell them about barcelona , the fc barcelona and , if they are somehow cultured , gaud\u00ed , sagrada fam\u00edlia , dal\u00ed , mir\u00f3 ... geographically , the pyrenees , between france and spain , 1/5th currently administrated by france , 4/5th by spain . 
  it would be 3rd or 4th on that ranking . 
  catalonia is in the same peninsula as spain and portugal . 
  using so large units is misleading . 
  spain is 37 % , ok , but catalonia is [ 62 % ] ( http://www.ara.cat/societat/territori-catala-boscos_0_609539191.html ) . 
  in fact , catalonia has a [ 62 % ] ( http://www.ara.cat/societat/territori-catala-boscos_0_609539191.html ) of land area covered by forests ... 
  well , it says spain 37 % , but catalonia is 62 % . 
  increadibly bigger difference than yours ... 
  hey , they were jus comparing barcelona and madrid . 
  i know there are worse places . 
  weather ? 
  you have not been much to barcelona . 
  so wet !, 
  a spaniard and two catalans . 
  i have the normal flag , the one we have right now , and the one we 'll have once we become independent , and sugusino has the `` fighting '' one , asking for independence . 
  i 'm also pro independence , but here i think i should just show my nationality , not my political intentions . 
  last friday and in a few minutes . 
  is n't spaghetti pasta ? 
  missing a map with occitania . 
  they are two different languages . 
  catalan is galo-romanic , spanish is ibero-romanic . 
  hence , closer relative to spanish is portuguese , closer relative to catalan is occitan ( another galo-romanic language would be french ) . 
  where are you from ? 
  had you never heard about catalan language ? 
   joder , tu madre gusta de mi this is portuguese just translated word by word into spanish , not spanish at all :-), 
  well , according to many spaniards we speak catalan not because it 's our language , but to annoy them ... 
  given they are called eesti and the code is ee , not at all , i guess . 
  not as a nickname , but a comparison . 
  fenician , jews ... go to twitter and search `` jud\u00edos catalanes '' . 
  in fact , i 've just done this and the secon result is :  kinox tiene antepasados jud\u00edos o fenicios , o quiz\u00e1s catalanes . 
  in spain it 's about catalans . 
  well , they call us jews , anyway . 
  no montenegro , no kosovo ... how old is this map ? 
  just tilt the image 45\u00ba and remove the squares ( were n't we talking about octagons ? ) . 
  you have barcelona grid . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  i was just asking who he is , because it looks half the tweets on that threat are his . 
  you 've not been to many european cities , have n't you ? 
  and you do n't know about ancient roman cities , i guess . 
  also , are us grids made of octogonal blocks ? 
  i thought they were rectangular . 
  what 's american about it ? 
  who 's that peter caltner who seems to need to answer each and every tweet ? 
  former industrial area with lots of abandoned factories . 
  you mistyped `` ethnically '' when you really meant `` genetically '' . 
  an ethnicity is not genetics . 
  although it seems in the us people only consider this trait to consider someone part of an ethnicity . 
  but you met lots of empars or amparos or the like . 
  the local saint patroness . 
  by the way , in previous times montserrat was a male name . 
  it 's the country 's saint patroness , the black `` mother of god '' ( how we call the virgin mary ) from the homonimous mountain . 
  ** female names ** ( from 1,417 % to 0,43 % ) 1 . 
  maria ( b ) 2 . 
  marta ( b ) 6 . 
  josefa ( s ) 8 . 
  laura ( b ) 9 .
