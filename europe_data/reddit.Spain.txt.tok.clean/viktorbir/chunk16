  xavier ( c ) ( c ) means it 's a catalan language name . 
  ( s ) spanish language one . 
  ( b ) that it is the same in both catalan and spanish . 
  many of the spanish names are because before 1975 all names had to be inscribed in spanish , and many people did n't take the effort to arrange it later . 
  also , many others are because the big immigration from spain . 
  maybe 30 % of current population did immigrate from spain , and many others have one of both spaniar parents . 
  ** family names ** ( from 2,305 % to 0,356 % ) 1 .

  torres 20 . 
  \u00c1lvarez aside from garcia , the first one , which historically can be also of catalan origin ( there 's a village called garcia ) , the first catalan family name is 19th , torres . 
  that 's because the huge immigration , and because spaniard names are quite less diverse than catalan ones . 
  you have seen my flag , have n't you ? 
  so , yes , i know what bilingualism is . 
  i also know what diglosia and aculturation are . 
  and if all young people consider english their first language , it 's clearly happening . 
  i guess the future is looking bad . 
  unless you mean good for aculturation . 
  you read the part where it says he 's the science minister , did n't you ? 
  so , italian and spanish oil adapted to uk tastes are worse than greek oil bought in greece . 
  who would have expected !, 
  yeah , we use to put oil on our salads . 
  the amount each one wants . 
   it 's generally accepted that the greek oil ( particularly from peloponessus and crete ) has the best quality/taste generally accepted by who ? 
  then , why do you talk about `` terrorists '' , in plural , and say `` they '' , if you are supposed to be talking about this single attack , done by a single person ? 
  why the fuck do you lie ? 
  i heard that about 3 % of kids in catalonia do n't get vaccinated . 
  no idea what proportion is for medical reasons and what for antivaccination craze . 
  edit : sorry , this weekend they were talking about it on the radio and it 's 1,5 % . 
  for how many more years will this be considered news ? 
  nowadays the `` ti\u00f3 de nadal '' , our form of santa claus , gives big gifts , toys ... but my mother used to explain me when she was young the `` gifts '' were the food they would eat on christmas lunch . 
  swiss , in fact . 
  no problem with spaniards , but spain does n't even let us have an independence referendum . 
  same could be done with andalusia and not just say `` spain '' . 
  so , northern ireland and scotland are now independent and western sahara moroccan . 
  great . 
  it 's in america . 
  `` belongs '' to an european country . 
  in fact , if the parents speak ( poor ) dutch at home the kids will speak worse dutch than if the parents spoke their ( good ) native language . 
  this is one problem with immigrants . 
  they think it will be better if they speak the local language with their kids and , if they are not really proficient in it , it 's worst for the kids . 
  i 'd call '' - mente '' a suffix . 
  do you consider `` l' '' a different word than `` le '' or `` la '' ? 
  if they are not words , what the fuck do they are ? 
  shortest : `` a '' ( at ) , `` i '' ( and ) , `` o '' ( or ) , `` u '' ( one ) . 
  longest : some random chemical compound . 
  the longest i can remember is `` anticonstitucionalment '' ( anticonstitutionally ) . 
  looking on the internet i 've found `` superdesequi\u0140libradament '', 
  the same ridiculous blue flag you are using right now as your flair ? 
  * catalan - native * spanish - almost as native . 
  learnt when i was a kid , some before school * french - quite poorly , but i understand people and they understand me . 
  on primary school ( 6 to 8 grades ) * german - well , almost not at all . 
  i just learnt some not on school , but on language academies when i was 14 to 16 * english - pretty well , i think . 
  i learnt it on secondary school . 
  from 9 to 12 grade * swahili - also very poorly . 
  i learnt some when i was 20 and then at 25-27 , and i went to zanzibar , in a languages academy * portuguese , italian , occitan ... - i do n't really speak them but when traveling i 've found out i can have a conversation with people , also can read technical texts . 
  i do n't get it . 
  is n't it this way all around the world ? 
  i mean , if i do n't understand you , or if we have to change our language to accomodate you , of course we are treating you differently . 
  what do you mean when you say that in some countries in asia and south america the reaction is different ? 
  and eu is not europe ( i guess by eu you mean european union , do n't you ? ), 
  exactly . 
  that 's the reason your headline is wrong . 
  can enter schengen area . 
  not `` europe '' . 
  can enter `` europe '' ? 
  as in istanbul , for example ? 
  or dublin ? 
  immigration since 2000 has been mostly from north africa , south america , china , pakistan and romania . 
  anyway , most people advocating for independence consider everyone here at the moment should be considered nationals . 
  anyway , i used `` immigrant '' in the sense of `` born abroad and coming here '' , not on having or not having papers / nationality / whatsoever . 
  by the way , someone born in ciudad ju\u00e1rez and `` emigrating '' to el paso would be considered immigrant , even if they share the same culture . 
  however , a spaniard coming to catalonia has a different culture and language , but is not an immigrant ... 
  an independent catalonia would be on the second darkest colour , in that map . 
  31 % of the current population were born outside catalonia . 
  in fact , from 2000 to 2008 the population grew from 6m to 7,5 m. 
  you do n't know what a migrant is , do n't you ? 
  look for the definition of migrant . 
  can i deduce this is what 's normal everywhere except the uk ?
