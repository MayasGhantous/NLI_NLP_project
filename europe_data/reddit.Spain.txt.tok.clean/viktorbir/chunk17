  i thought we were talking about international law , not about uno members . 
  have you read when it talks about consensus , eu , usa , red cross , un security council , international court of justice , international community ... ? 
   ** the international community considers the settlements in occupied territory to be illegal , [ 8 ] ** and the united nations has repeatedly upheld the view that israel 's construction of settlements constitutes a violation of the fourth geneva convention . 
  [ 9 ] [ 10 ] israeli neighborhoods in east jerusalem and communities in the golan heights , the latter of which has been annexed by israel , are also considered settlements by the international community , which does not recognise israel 's annexations of these territories . 
  [ 11 ] ** the international court of justice also says these settlements are illegal in a 2004 advisory opinion . 
  [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] ** in april 2012 , un secretary general ban ki-moon , in response to moves by israel to legalise israeli outposts , reiterated that all settlement activity is illegal , and `` runs contrary to israel 's obligations under the road map and repeated quartet calls for the parties to refrain from provocations . 
  '' [ 15 ] similar criticism was advanced by the eu and the us . 
  [ 16 ] [ 17 ] israel disputes the position of the international community and the legal arguments that were used to declare the settlements illegal . 
  [ 18 ]  ** the consensus view [ 80 ] in the international community is that the existence of israeli settlements in the west bank including east jerusalem and the golan heights is in violation of international law . 
  [ 81 ] ** the fourth geneva convention includes statements such as `` the occupying power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies '' . 
  [ 82 ]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/israeli_settlement  ** the international community considers the establishment of israeli settlements in the israeli-occupied territories illegal under international law , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] ** however israel maintains that they are consistent with international law [ 6 ] because it does not agree that the fourth geneva convention applies to the territories occupied in the 1967 six-day war . 
  [ 7 ] ** the united nations security council , the united nations general assembly , the international committee of the red cross , the international court of justice and the high contracting parties to the convention have all affirmed that the fourth geneva convention does apply . 
  [ 8 ] [ 9 ] **  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_law_and_israeli_settlements, 
  being the settlements illegal , according to international laws , how come it is allowed to import anything produced there ? 
  i can not understand it . 
  not decorating . 
  making it clear . 
  again , if i 'm talking about a german who happens to be nationalist , you 'll and everyone will asume they 're a german nationalist . 
  but if this german is a turkish nationalist , i 'll better say it to make it clear . 
  specially if some politicians have tried to link the suspected terrorists with catalan patriotism ( i guess that 's the word you would say in english ) . 
  experts say it 's santi vila , former mayor of figueres and current planning and sustainability minister . 
  usually , if you are talking about a someplace , in this case catalonia , and you say `` nationalist '' you mean `` this place nationalist '' , so it would be `` catalan nationalist '' . 
  this is not the case . 
  this guy is spanish nationalist , anti catalan nationalism . 
  a ) 5 of the muslims were converts , 4 of them `` ethnic spaniards '' ( 5th one , south american ) . 
  b ) he was to provide them with a grenade to attack a jewish bookshop . 
   but a legislative act is still necessary . 
  legislative act is not the same as changing the constitution , innit ? 
  but , then , why should they change the article ? 
  same wording works for homosexual marriages . 
  from the 11 arrested ones , 10 muslims , 1 neonazi / spanish nationalist . 
  is canonical really british ? 
  is n't it south african ? 
  or it 's just the owner , the south african one ? 
  i dont ' get it . 
  what part of that article says marriage must be between man and woman ? 
  albert rivera said he does n't think homosexual marriage should be called marriage ... 
   openly homosexual candidate with an ecuadorian hairdresser hey , what 's with south american guys married to european politicians ? 
  the one most consider the heir to catalan president ( not maybe as catalan president himself , because the party is having some problems , but at least as leader of the party ) is married to a brazilian chef . 
  catalonia : marriage and adoption are ok . we have one of the most advanced antidiscrimination laws in the world . 
  there is some homophobia , of course , mostly old religious folks and some right wing youth . 
  a couple of examples of normality : - the responsible of the main tv news in catalonia tweeted a couple of days ago that he would be not working for a few weeks due to a paternity leave because him and his husband had just had a baby . 
  - the catalan ~ ~ inner affairs ~ ~ planning and sustainability minister , from a center - right party , himself a christian , and considered the probable successor to catalan president , got recently married to a brazilian chef , a man . 
  nobody cared . 
  in fact , in catalan newspapers the headline was about him getting married , and only reading the text or if there were pictures , you knew it was to another man . 
  not because they wanted to hide it , but because it 's not important , and he is the famous one , not the husband , so only him on the headlines . 
  in fact , a plan to declare independence in 18 moths , ** after 27 september , if and only if , pro-independence parties get in those elections an absolute majority . 
  no andorra ? 
  this week there were reports on catalan tv about british tourists ( skiers ) trying to smuggle andorran tobacco in alguaire airport back to the uk . 
  and his opinion is that any pro-soviet is an uneducated asshole . 
  spain 1,7 ? 
  really ? 
  this looks very low . 
  if you think 25 % of the population speak 2 official languages ( spanish plus catalan/occitan/basque / galician ) , and about 3 milion immigrants from non spanish speaking countries , it means only 1 out of 3 would people speak an extra language . 
  i live in catalonia , and everyone i know under 60 speaks at least : catalan , spanish and the ones over 45 some french , the ones under 45 some english . 
  did you have the flag this morning ? 
  because i do n't understand why i asked , otherwise !!!, 
  where do you come from ? 
  not at all . 
  have you read the link ? 
  yes , i am . 
  do you have any problem ? 
  and as this is a post relating to my country , were i can add some context , i do . 
  it 's relevant for the context . 
  it 's different if this is a linguistically and culturally quite homogeneous area that just happens to belong to two different countries due to some weird historical reasons or if there were two different cultures involved . 
  yes . 
  and i do n't get the downvotes . 
  spanish nationalists , maybe ? 
  in fact , a catalan town sorrounded by catalan territoire . 
  in provence , occitania , when i asked for traditional food they served me what i consider normal catalan food . 
  i know brits drive on the other side of the road , but i did n't know they also walk on the wrong side . 
  found it on the tube , with everybody walking into me . 
  in spain ( well , at least in madrid ) i was surprised by how dirty the floor is on bars . 
  they throw everything to the floor : cigarrets , sugar bags , wooden sticks , paper towels ... 
  like in all civilized countries !, 
  in the eu . 
   the highest mountain in the peninsula is not in the pyrenees . 
  just 74 m taller :-), 
  there are fascists / nazi volunteers from all around europe fighting on both sides . 
  * what about the scottish one ? 
  he is from the us ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mandy_patinkin, 
  remember that 's ** new ** entrepreneurs . 
  specially facts with no context . 
  imagine foreign population triplicated , but their rate crime only rose 179 % ... 
  per person ( foreigner ) or in total ? 
  if in total , how much did the foreigners population rise ? 
  this is not what he is saying . 
  cervantes died on 22 april , gregorian calendar , but was buried on 23 april . 
  shakespeare died on 23 april julian calendar . 
  but , i do n't know why , most books wrongly say cervantes died on 23 . 
  catalan rose and book tradition has of course nothing to do with unesco declaring it world book day ... ps . 
  it was catalan government and catalan editors who pressured for this . 
   i am canadian , not american , but i love living in germany . 
  last time i checked canada was in america . 
  to me it sounds as someone saying `` i 'm swiss , not european '' . 
  nice hidraulic tiles . 
  it 's as if you were in barcelona . 
  mostly , the amount of hair . 
  look on bison article on wikipedia , with pictures of both . 
  if you are talking about european bisons , better not use the image of an american one ...
