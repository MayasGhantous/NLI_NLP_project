  different species and so on . 
  bisons in spain ? 
  in the wild ? 
  really ???? 
  edit . 
  ok , i see , reintroduced in 2010 . https://www.rewildingeurope.com/blog/biggest-bison-transport-ever/, 
  that sounds like an old spanish army story ( when there were conscripts ) . 
  is n't that the deffinition of a hawaiian pizza ? 
  [ * coca * ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/coques.jpg ) is not a pizza , but our equivalent . 
  it can be sweet or savory . 
  the main difference between savory * coca * and pizza , aside of the shape ( it 's not round , but rectangular , more efficient space use ) is that it usually has no cheese . 
  the name , of course , is not related to the drug or the drink , but , maybe , to english cake . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coca_ ( pastry ) https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/coca_ ( past % c3 % ads ), 
  one third of it is the gross national income , which does n't take into account nothing but the amount , not the even distribution . 
  last column is not just turk , but `` turk ** and greek '' **, 
  i 'm sorry to tell you , but white chocolate is no chocolate . 
  it 's just cocoa butter with sugar . 
  how come this is not the top comment ? 
  i had read many times it to be one in ten . 
  so , one in fifty is really good . 
  they mixed up the catalan . 
  i mean , it says `` cinquante ** francs ** / ** cinquanta ** franchi '' , when it 's clearly ** `` cinquanta francs '' . 
  for a really weird deffinition of native . 
  are you really saying 70 % of arabs have resorted to violence ? 
  please !, 
  `` they have not resorted to violence '' as have n't 99,9 % of the arabs , either . 
   spanish workers currently tend to start work at 10am , staying until 2pm when they have a siesta up to three hours before leaving at 8pm . 
  this a delayed april 's fool , innit ? 
  in ** some ** european parliaments . 
  albania ? 
  bosnia ? 
  one internet point for you . 
  ( although it may be from the french , too ), 
  hey , minorcans and their `` dia d'enganar '' are already independent and i did n't know it ? 
   while about one in five natives can be considered as islamophobic , the level of phobia against the west among muslims -- for which oddly enough there is no word ; one might call it ` occidentophobia ' -- is much higher still , with 54 percent believing that the west is out to destroy islam . '' thinking that the west is trying to destroy islam is `` occidentophobia '' ? 
  wow , so many western , christian/atheist people in here are `` occidentophobes '' . 
  without the land forces it would n't have work out . 
  players do n't have so high numbers , i think . 
  so , now , according to you , the part bordering denmark is nw ? 
  same as the highly populated part we were talking about ? 
  is that what you mean ? 
  you should use local solar time , to compare . 
  i mean , on most of the year midday is at 14.00 in france and spain , but at 13.00 in italy and germany . 
  on winter midday is at 13.00 in france and spain , but at 12.00 in italy and germany . 
  not in my kitchen or any kitchen i 've ever seen . 
  again , is the part bordering denmark your ne ? 
  by the way , what kind of mental discapacity does n't allow you to answer simple questions ? 
  do you really can not explain why , according to you , nw germany is not on top left , but on middle left ? 
  i guess , according to that logic , what i 'd call nw is your n and the part bordering denmark is your ne , innit ? 
  yeah , we are catalunya . 
  and ny is pronounced the same . 
  also the same as in kenya in swahili and many other kenyan languages , for example . 
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ny_ ( digraph ) * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kikuyu_language#consonants * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gusii_language#consonants * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swahili_language#consonants * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oromo_language#consonant_and_vowel_phonemes * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luo_dialect#consonants * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maasai_language#consonants and , by the way , spanish \u00f1 is the same sound of hungarian ( and catalan ) ny , / \u0272 /, 
  are you really unable to answer ? 
  what a pity !, 
  where is nw on a clock ? 
  not on 10.30 ?? 
   spanish is one of the easiest languages , could you expand on it ?? 
    and because it 's fun to invent new verb conjugations . 
  thy look quite standard , to my catalan eyes . 
  easy , in fact . 
  we have a verb ended in - ur ( dur , to carry ) , many in - re ( as moure , to move ) and non stressed - er ( as c\u00f3rrer , to run ) !, 
  :-) also , those ended in - ir can have two forms , `` parir '' -  `` pareixo '' ( i bear ) / `` tenir '' -  `` tinc '' ( i have ), 
   we have a few vowels ( a , \u00f6 , \u00fc ) and consonants ( gy , ny , ty , zs ) that are somewhat difficult , what 's the problem with ny ? 
  we even have it in our country name !, 
  see the `` something like '' . 
  correctly , that would be `` mi aerodeslizador se ha llenado de anguilas '' . 
  close enough is not correct . 
  do n't make fun of the poor guy . 
  he clearly does n't know the difference between lleno ( full ) and llenado ( filled ) . 
  you said something like `` my hovercraft has been filled with anguilas '', 
  how do you call the archipelago , otherwise ? 
  you have no idea of spanish , do you ? 
  catalan : `` el meu aerolliscador \u00e9s ple d'anguiles '' although i 'd say , more naturally , `` tinc l'aerolliscador ple d'anguiles '' ( i have the hovercraft full of eels ), 
  so , you clearly fail to know in conventional maps , as the one we are talking about , n is on top ( 12 on the clock ) , nw to top left ( 10.30 on the clock ) and w on left ( 9 on the clock , as is the case ) . 
  could you please explain me the difference between nw and w ? 
  where in the map would be w , according to you ????????? 
  * most north point : 55\u00ban * most south point : 47\u00ban * most west point : 6\u00bae * most east point : 15\u00bae the area we are talking about is around 6-8\u00bae , 50-52\u00ban . 
  so , absolutely west , absolutely middle . 
  hence , west . 
  it must be really sad to have such a discapacity that does n't allow you to see where nw and w are on a map held in a standard position . 
  do they let you to park on special places ? 
  the very deffinition of west : http://imgur.com/a/2szia, 
  really , draw a # and you 'll see it 's west germany . 
  or a x. 
  so , no machetes and lower numbers than ever ? 
  draw a # over the map . 
  you 'll see the yellow part is not on top left quadrant , but on left one . 
  really , look again on your own map . 
  the non green part you are talking about next to the netherlands is in the middle part of the country , left side . 
  hence , west . 
  [ excuse me ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/senyera#origin_and_history ) you are 800 years wrong ... 
  wow , clearly catalonia and spain have already disconnected , if this is the first time i hear about this . 
  any spaniard around here ? 
  is this really a thing ? 
  you know north on maps is on top , do n't you ? 
  the area you are talking about is on left , hence west . 
  there 's a restaurant on the country side local people find normal , but english speaking people laugh at : * can fart . 
  * in catalan `` can '' is just '' 's house '' ( or french `` chez '' ) and `` fart '' is saciated .
