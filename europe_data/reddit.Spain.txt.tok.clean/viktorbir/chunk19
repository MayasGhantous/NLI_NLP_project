  so , `` saciated one 's house '' . 
  aside of ours ( best and oldest ) , estonia 's looks great worst would be kosovo ( and maybe cyprus , but not so much ) for having the map on the flag . 
  bosnia and herzegovina too . 
  that would be a good flag for a company , like ikea , not for an independent country . 
  op starts saying he is from canada ... 
  because those are the two coutries mentioned by the op ? 
   , whereas on the spanish side people tend to gather more in urban centers leaving the country side more empty not in galicia . 
  more population nuclei in galicia than in the rest of spain . 
   how can lidl sell jeans for # 5.99 ? 
  according to the very linked article , they do n't . 
  the ones at this price are leggings , not jeans . 
  no idea about facebook , but i 'm catalan and have two family names , and use both . 
  if you see someone named `` x i y '' , it 's clearly catalan ( `` i '' meaning and ) . 
  my mother 's family names were `` roca i roca '' . 
   lind - type ( lindberg , lindstr\u00f6m , lindqvist and lindgren in that order ) . 
  and what 's `` lind - '' ? 
  the one writing the article has no idea what a restoration is , innit ? 
  andorra , of course . 
  in fact , the only independent part of my country . 
   set up by venice 's rulers in 1516 on the site of an old metal foundry , and probably the first community in europe to be segregated by religious belief , the neighborhood took its name from getar , a word in the venetian dialect meaning `` to smelt . '', 
  really ? 
  come visit the `` call '' ( catalan for jewish quarter ) of girona or barcelona or mallorca , or so many other catalan towns . 
  from several centuries before . 
  portugal and canary islands are in the right time zone . 
  have you ever seen a time zones map ? 
  canary islands are 100 % in utc-1 and so is half portugal , the coast , which happens to be the more populated area of the country . 
  what about france ? 
  and belgium and the netherlands . 
  and , in fact , portugal and the canary islands should be utc-1, 
  in fact , colombus not being italian , but catalan , is the only one of their theories that does n't really sound crazy . 
  colombus , cervantes and many others were catalans and there 's been a spanish conspiracy to rewrite history . 
  hey , they have their own `` new history '' institution !, 
  well , they favor a coalition of both center right nationalist parties . 
  makes sense . 
  how do you say to flight ? 
  ( in catalan it 's volar ) and to want ? 
  ( we say voler ) so , in fact , vol has two meanings : a flight and he/she/it wants . 
  how do you say to fly in romanian ? 
  also , vol is he/she/it wants . 
  so vol de mort might ( a little bit ungrammatically ) mean wants of death . 
  which is ... ? 
  by the way , rosemary 's baby 's title in spanish is the devil 's seed . 
  could n't be a bigger spoiler . 
  romania , romance language ... who could have guessed !, 
  in catalan at least he is voldemort , what they changed was the real name . 
  i guess because voldemort appears on the 1st book and we do n't know his real name till much later . 
  i love how romanian is some times so like catalan . 
  dead man 's head is also , literally , cap de mort . 
  does voldemort translate to , in romanian , as flight of death/dead man ? 
  then i 'd have said catalans , not french people . 
   i 'm willing the bet your friends were rather speaking in a `` bourgeois '' manner and called it the `` parisian accent '' . 
  that 's pretty much the diffinition of posh , innit ? 
  also , according [ this collaborative dictionary ] ( http://dictionary.reverso.net/french-english/serviette ) , a serviette is also a briefcase . 
  it does n't say in what dialect . 
  the same according to the [ oxford dictionary ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/translate/french-english/serviette ) . 
  [ in wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_french ) it 's said serviette in swiss french is linge . 
  i 've remembered i learnt about serviette being a backpack in a village near friburg . 
   in the french-speaking areas of switzerland , a popular variation is the `` caf\u00e9 renvers\u00e9 '' ( `` reverse coffee '' ) , which is made by using the milk as a base and adding espresso , in reversal of the normal method of making a `` caf\u00e9 au lait '' . 
   wait in what language is a serviette a backpack ? 
  serviette is what you put on your lap when you eat at a restaurant . 
  i always say caf\u00e9 au lait . 
  where in switzerland are you from ? 
  i learnt those words in la tour de peilz , next to vevey . 
  the french people i know who are not from paris make fun of `` l'accent parisien '' / lak ` sanparisi'an / as being posh . 
  serviette as a backpack ? 
  renvers\u00e9 as a caf\u00e9 au lait ? 
  septante , huitante , nonante ? 
  aside , the lack of difference is n't because the native language was arpitan and it was mostly replaced by standard french ? 
  posh catalan sounds nasal , full of spanish words , sounded consonants pronounced unsounded , s pronounced with a lisp ... edit : seeing what some portuguese guy has writen , yeah , here also with lots of hand movements . 
   in a similar fashion the franks ( now french ) were named after the proto-germanic frankon it seems - which was their local name for the spear . 
  i 'd say franks nowadays are franconians . 
   the allamans where a tribe next to france . 
  and not really a very coherent tribe , but a bunch of people from different tribes , hence all man . 
  in catalan we also call them `` alemanys '' and the country `` alemanya '' . 
  as i said , my french pronounce is awful . 
  i 've always pronounced them differently . 
  i 'll have to blame my teacher . 
  i guess my french pronounce is awful , as i would pronounce renar different from renard , for example . 
  where would you add a d in n\u00e9nuphar ? 
  why ? 
  it 's an official language in the whole of catalonia . 
  good point . 
  also , after some years of droughts ( well , now it 's about 100 days without rain in catalonia ) catalan people have learnt to survive using less water . 
  but , anyway , they have used the total amount or the concentration ? 
  afaik in english it 's minorca . 
  thanks , i did n't get it . 
  so , the balkans do n't care about the south part in south-eastern europe ? 
  what 's `` your '' part of europe ? 
  they do n't call themselves by patronimics , but by given names . 
  i speak both catalan and spanish . 
  the intelligibility is for non bilingual people . 
  for exemple , catalan speakers from perpiny\u00e0 or l'alguer have problems understanding catalan , and i 've met many latin americans who understand nothing of what i say in catalan . 
  what is your language ? 
  catalan or spanish ? 
  do you understand the other without no exposure , no teaching ? 
  that 's nothing near to fluent . 
  really ? 
  what about people from eivissa or mallorca ( specially the inland ) ? 
  they are the worst !, 
  catalan and spanish are not mutually intelligible .
