  catalan and occitan , maybe . 
  which one of those is ** your ** top-level politician ? 
  i see no catalan , there . 
  does king phillip vi really speak basque , or he just can read it ? 
  catalan ( not `` catalonian '' , by the way ) yeah , quite fluently . 
  no idea about galician . 
  catalan president from 2006-2010 speaks better spanish than catalan . 
  he immigrated into catalonia when he was 16 . 
  a ) it 's catalan , not catalonian . 
  b ) catalan is closer to occitan and in the same branch as french , not spanish . 
  a couple have , and they agree croatian president barely speaks croatian . 
  nen , has vist el que he dit , en el post ? 
  :-) i no `` some romanian '' . 
  manuel valls is a native catalan speaker . 
  he also speaks spanish and i guess at least some italian . 
  his mother is italian , but lives in barcelona and i 've always heard her speaking just catalan . 
   ahmet davuto\u011flu wow , that 's a lot . 
  and malay !, 
  but ... is he really the one who holds executive power ? 
  is n't in turkey the president who has it ? 
  edit : oops , sorry !, 
  i see erdogan , when he was in charge , was prime minister ; and president is not like in the us , but more like in germany . 
  innit ? 
  can you explain this ? 
  is he croatian ? 
  no dutch ???? 
  wow !, 
  wow !, 
  but swedish / norwegian / danish is n't a little bit like cheating ? 
   washington was built to serve as a political center . 
  madrid was not . 
   but it would be on the range of segovia or guadalajara , not valdeconejos del arroyo . 
  so ** only ** 98 % to 99 % of it 's current population is linked to it serving as a political center , according to you . 
  i 'd agree . 
   so my question is how does catalonia actually plan on getting any money ? 
  while still a part of spain , as any part of spain . 
  after declaring independence , via taxes , as any other country . 
   last i heard there was a unilateral declaration of independence you heard wrong :-), 
  wow !, 
  i 'm speechless !, 
   madrid was not are you sure ? 
  before becoming the capital it was just a small village . 
   known for toxic speeches and toxic nationalism sorry ? 
  for how long have you known him ? 
  what are those `` toxic speeches '' ? 
  what is that `` toxic nationalism '' ? 
  by the way , do you know his wife is romanian ? 
  some subreddits have subscribers only thanks to their name . 
  for example , / r/es has a total of 22 comments on the 25 front page posts . 
  with 5k subscribers !, 
  not specific enough . 
  here it would be yogurt induced longevity . 
  well , two romance languages sharing words ? 
  who would have guessed !, 
  ;-) but yeah , lots more than you 'd expect , given distance . 
  by the way , is dragon `` drac '' , too ? 
  in catalan you 've written a literal translation of `` happy new year '' , but , as in italian , the most used expression is `` bon any '' , `` good year '' . 
  `` feli\u00e7 any nou '' might be more used when together with `` bon nadal '' ( lit . 
  `` good christmas '' ) , i guess not to repeat the bon , but even then many people say `` bon nadal i bon any !, 
  also a poetical way to say it in other dialects . 
  as used by salvat-papasseit , for example . 
  lapland can not be in canada , sorry . 
  you mean not a lot of people think he is from finland , people knows he is from the north pole . 
  you mean how many of us know finnish state santa is from finland , not from the north pole , do n't you ? 
  before noon ??? 
  m\u00e9s : [ in the united kingdom , ** lunch ** is often a small meal , designed to stave off hunger until they return home from work and eat dinner . 
  it is usually eaten early in the ** afternoon ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lunch#europe ) [ in many modern usages , the term ** dinner ** refers to the ** evening ** meal , which is now often the most significant meal of the day in english-speaking cultures . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dinner#time_of_day ) o sigui , normalment lunch = afternoon i dinner = evening , per\u00f2 christmas dinner = afternoon, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christmas_dinner#uk ), 
  christmas dinner vol dir , de fet , dinar ( un dinar tard\u00e0 , per\u00f2 dinar ) . 
  it only took them 40 years ... 
  is n't this the normal way ? 
  i think it 's the same in basque . 
  some salad and varied starters ( cured meat , sea food , artichokes , asparagus , olives , cheese ... ) 2 .

  stuffed chicken * ( pollastre farcit ) * ( stuffed with meat , raisins and pine nuts , usually ) 5 . 
  some christmas biscuits [ * ( neules ) * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neula ) all of this while drinking sparkling wine [ * ( cava ) * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cava_ ( spanish_wine ) ) or read wine . 
  traditionally , with the rests of the meat you prepare caneloni * ( canelons ) * on boxing day * ( sant esteve ) , * which is also a main holiday . 
  nowadays , you may have canelons also on christmas dinner * ( dinar de nadal ) . 
  and of course they are not evenly distributed . 
  according to the link , in spain they are 2,1 % , 980000 . 
  well , catalonia is about a 16 % of spain 's populati0n , but more than 40 % of them live here . 
  so , a [ 7,3 % of catalan population is muslim ] ( http://www.ara.cat/societat/poblacio-catalana-declara-seguidora-religio_0_1335466612.html ) , and about a 1,5 % ( or less ) of spanish non-catalan population is muslim . 
  no secessionist movement in east ukraine ? 
  that would be a great idea !, 
  usually , last one is badia , second to last gramenet . 
  and , yeah , sant adri\u00e0 can be around . 
  about being or not a city ... 
  according to catalan law it is n't , as it does n't reach 20000 inhabitants . 
  but according international standards , more than 10000 inhabitants in a contiguous area , not devoted to primary sector is a city . 
  so , for reddit , it would be a city . 
  literally , it looks like spain . 
  it 's called [ badia del vall\u00e8s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/badia_del_vall\u00e8s ) and was created during the 60 's , with a city plan shaped like spain 's map ( well , in fact , iberian peninsula ) . 
  the name of the streets and avenues correspond with those of the spanish cities and regions located there : https://www.google.com/maps/@41.5084571,2.1117885,1285m/data=!3m1!1e3 ps . 
  in my hometown we joke about this being created so we would not be the last one on statistics . 
  people , all people , have evolved . 
  otherwise , we would be amoebas , or something similar .
