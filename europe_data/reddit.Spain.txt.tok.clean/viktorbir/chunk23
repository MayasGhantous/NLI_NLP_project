  so , no , you are not right . 
  history exhibition , about those statues , not an art exposition . 
  fava , to us . 
  * faves * ( faba beans , fave ) are bigger than * p\u00e8sols * ( peas , piselli ) . 
  in catalan , patata , patatona , and also figa . 
  just by memory . 
  6m poles were killed in ww2 . 
  half of them jews , half ot them catholics . 
  also , remember the lebensraum . 
  slavs were to be exterminated to leave room for the germans . 
  where in your link can i find that information ? 
  and after thousands of years no kurdish name ? 
  i mean , turkish moved to turkey just hundreds of years ago , but there are quite a few turkish names . 
  not even a single one with a kurdish name ? 
  hard to believe . 
  a ) no bulls are or will be set on fire . 
  b ) unfortunately right now there are still some festivities involving bulls . 
  right now , not in the future . 
  but if we stay , maybe in the future we will be forced to have again bullfighting . 
  genial . 
  that 's good . 
  but i would not have many hopes . 
  i mean , look where some of they meet : http://elpais.com/diario/2010/04/27/espana/1272319203_850215.html, 
  no difference , i guess . 
  never been in any of them . 
  looking on the wikipedia and the web , it seems in a few catalan villages they still have a `` matan\u00e7a del porc '' festival , but in fact those are fairs about pork products and food festivals . 
  no public killing of the pigs . 
  maybe public funding can have some influence ... http://www.eldiario.es/caballodenietzsche/eurodiputados-pp-psoe-subvenciones-tauromaquia_6_318528164.html, 
  qui collons est\u00e0 defensant la tortura dels animals ? 
  if that , according to you , is setting a live bull on fire , [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/fornpyhezt4?t=14s ) must be setting living people on fire , innit ? 
  and , by the way , that infamous tradition was protected not by catalan nationalist but by almost all catalan parliament . 
  in fact , the few ones who voted against were , at that time , usually counted as catalan nationalists . 
  also , all the ones you might count as spanish nationalist voted also for the protection . 
   you do n't say `` madrid has done '' if you live in andalucia , galicia or murcia . 
  madrid decides , says this andalusian newspaper : http://www.diariodesevilla.es/article/sevilla/598419/las/cabalas/junio.html, 
  you are right about the metonymy . 
  just one thing , that `` espanya ens roba '' was the slogan of a very minor party that had 4 mp in the catalan parliament from 2010 to 2012 . 
  almost none has used it since then . 
  well , mostly spanish parties trying to caricaturize catalan independentists . 
  this [ andalusian newspaper ] ( http://www.diariodesevilla.es/article/sevilla/598419/las/cabalas/junio.html ) disagrees with you . 
  madrid is not only the spanish government , but the psoe direction !, 
  hey , in this [ andalusian newspaper ] ( http://www.diariodesevilla.es/article/sevilla/598419/las/cabalas/junio.html ) madrid is not only the spanish government , but the psoe direction !, 
  from a madrid based [ newspaper ] ( http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2016/10/03/estados_unidos/1475522588_726345.html ) , from yesterday :  washington cumple su amenaza al considerar que mosc\u00fa `` no ha cumplido sus compromisos '' so , i guess , they are talking about the cities , not the coutries ' governments ... 
  never heard about washington meaning the us government ? 
  no , there 's not tradition in which a bull is set on fire . 
  or maybe you consider [ * correfocs * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/correfoc ) a tradition that consist of setting people on fire ? 
  edit : hey , what a pity you have removed the link you posted to that supposed bull on fire !, 
  you did n't want people to see you were lying , innit ? 
  a link to the video he has shamelessly removed : https://youtu.be/wviypdqea6u?t=1m23s, 
  in fact , there was a law , for several years , banning any festivity in which an animal was killed , including the very traditional catalan festivity of `` la matan\u00e7a del porc '' ( pig killing , which used to be done in public in the town 's main square ) . 
  there was , however , one exception . 
  bullfighting . 
  so , the 2010 ban was just deleting the exception to the law . 
  to some spaniards any catalan who considers himself a catalan is a nationalist . 
  you realize what that bull has over is mud , do n't you ? 
  yeah , because in fact there 's no tradition of setting live bulls on fire . 
  igual que una agressi\u00f3 \u00e9s diferent d'un assassinat . 
  a ) i 'm against the * bou embolat * ( in fact , i 'm vegetarian , you can imagine i 'm not very pro hurting any animal ) . 
  b ) in the * bou embolat * none stabs the bull , with no intention . 
  c ) in bullfighting they do not only intend to kill . 
  they actually kil . 
  so , yeah , i insist . 
  is morally different . 
  a lot . 
  today i 've been aware that some villages and counties in the balearic islands , valencia and galicia have also banned bullfighting . 
  of course the constitutional court says nothing about it . 
  a ) no animals are `` burnt alive '' . 
  b ) of course stabbing them to death if far worse . 
  hey , congratulations , you have found three pictures from when the most famous bullfighter in the world came to barcelona !, 
  ( and , if i 'm not wrong , that was the last bullfight ever in catalonia ) there had been , historically , tens of bullfighting rings in catalonia . 
  due to lack of attendance there was only one resting , la monumental , in barcelona . 
  * in 2007 there were ** 13 ** bullfights in barcelona . 
  [ two were full , 18000 people , the other eleven had less than 3000 ] ( http://www.racocatala.cat/noticia/15978/any-mes-curses-braus-monumental-barcelona ) . 
  * in 2009 , except the one time jos\u00e9 tom\u00e1s came , [ it was between 70 % and 80 % empty ] ( http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/sociedad/govern-preve-pagar-millon-como-tope-por-veto-los-toros-1160208 ), 
  just what i 'm saying . 
  that 's the reason we want to leave spain !, 
  so , to you , it 's the same moral category ? 
  wow !, 
  it 's the same if someone beats you as if they kill you ? 
  should the law treat them equivalently ? 
  do your really consider there is no moral difference between both things ? 
  really ???? 
  of course there is no diference between hurting and killing . 
  none at all . 
  just a reminding : the president of the constitutional court was appointed member of this court in 2010 . 
  he was a paying member of the ruling party , pp , from 2008 to 2011 . 
  it is unconstitutional for judges to be members of parties . 
  in fact , the president of the court was a member of the ruling party , before and after being designated to constitutional court ... and that is against the constitution !, 
  crazy !, 
  it had been forbiden , for almost a decade , to kill any animal in public , in a show , except for bullfighting , due to nationalistic reasons . 
  what was done was removing the exception to the law . 
  about setting live bulls on fire , you have no idea of what you are talking about . 
  anyway , i think it 's just a whole different category killing vs ( maybe ) hurting . 
   catalan nationalists in spain banned bullfighting to show how much non-spanish they are . 
  that 's why the popular legislative initiative was led by animalist organizations . 
  it seems you can rule anything about bullfighting , except banning it . 
  i guess they 'll just make it somehow impossible to do it , with nonsensical conditions . 
  that . 
  i 'm not using a weird , arcane , hidden meaning of this word . 
  i 'm using the first one .
