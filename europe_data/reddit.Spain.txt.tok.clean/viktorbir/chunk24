  i 'm not talking about modern style bullfighting , of course . 
  but it seems there are written sources for at least 900 years , so centuries , if not millenia . 
  * first * two meanings of [ country according to the collins ] ( http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/country ) dictionary : 1 . a territory distinguished by its people , culture , language , geography , etc 2 . an area of land distinguished by its political autonomy ; state catalonia is a territory distinguished by its people , culture , language , geography , etcy , and has a political autonomy ( in fact , oficially , it 's called an autonomous community ) . 
  yeah , but when you add this ruling to the fact that some articles in the catalan statute were ruled inconstitutional but the same articles as copied in other places statutes remain legal , you start seeing a pattern . 
  bullfighting has been a hispanic ( as in the roman hispania sense ) tradition for centuries , if not millenia . 
  however , in the last centuries it has become , more and more , identified with the most radical spanish-spanish image you can imagine . 
  so , catalans in the last decades have not identified it at all with a catalan tradition , only in some rural areas . 
  but it 's not just this , it 's mostly people has gotten more urbanized and cares much more for animal rights . 
  on the last years bullfighting circus were almost empty , with only old die hard fans and stupid tourists . 
  anyway , the head of the organization that collected the signatures asking for the ban was a chilean guy ... also , as a quite weird thing , in northern catalonia , the fifth of catalonia not under spanish administration , but under french administration , where they had not the spanish pression to become proper spaniards and so on , bullfighting is considered a very important symbol of catalanity ... 
  catalonia banned bullfighting quite a few years ago . 
  this was decided by catalan parliament after being presented a popular petition signed by 180 000 people . 
  this is a country with 7,5 m inhabitants . 
  proportionally , it would be equivalent to about 2m signatures in germany or 1,5 signatures in the uk or france . 
  well , now , the spanish constitutional court ( the highest court ) has turned back that law and made bullfighting legal again in catalonia . 
  guess why we want to leave ? 
  by the way , bullfighting has been banned in the canary islands for a much longer time . 
  yeah , you guessed it right !, 
  it 's still banned , there !, 
  the constitutional court just decided catalonia can not ban it , but no problem about the canary islands , of course !, 
  the reason is that we have legal capacity to legislate ** about ** bullfighting , but not to ban it . 
  there is no political conflict with the canary islands , therefore no action taken .

  they did quite a few great and well informed capsules explaining how everything works . 
  you can see them inside the transmission or as side videos . 
  the ones comenting the castells are catalans , so they pronounce it correctly . 
  the english speaking ones at least say `` coia veia '' . 
  what kills me is one of them talking about the `` casteiers de la vila de ** gr\u00e0thia ** , ** barthelona ** . '', 
  in non medical usage is another person the one using the syringe ? 
  also , previous sentences talk about medicines , weight of a child ( for dosage ) , dosage , blood transfusion ... and following sentences are about different vaccinations , contact lenses , glasses , prescriptions ... 
  so , what makes you think it 's not about medical usage ? 
  `` please , use a new syringe '' , because , as we all know , in europe syringes are reused . 
  right now , since this law , northern catalonia is administratively part of catalonia , yes . 
  that 's what i 'm complaining . 
  that they use a name that does no correspond . 
  lately most occitan language things i see are based in catalonia . 
  so , a region occupying 1/3 of occitania and including 1/5 of catalonia is called occitania . 
  makes sense . 
  suggestions : * generalitat --  catalan government ( it 's in fact the official name used in english ) * diada --  national day * or referendum or referendum --  either referendum or referendum, 
  argentina declared independence in 1816 , was n't recognized by spain till about 1860 . 
  you have no memory . 
  there was no referendum in 2014 . 
  back then , the catalan parliament only had about 30mp pro independence ( now it 's 72 from 135 ) . 
  they asked the spanish parliament for a referendum . 
  the answer was no ( well , in fact , they laughed at their faces ) . 
  they made a law for making referendums . 
  it was nullified . 
  they changed it to a popular consultation . 
  same . 
  later they changed it to a `` participation process '' ( proc\u00e9s participatiu ) . 
  and that is what was done . 
  catal\u00e0 is catalan and , as you say , catalunya is catalonia . 
  catalonian is not a word . 
  buy a dictionary . 
  in fact , catalonia comes from catalan , not the other way around . 
  http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/catalonian http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/catalan, 
  ( catalan , not catalonian . 
  as you do n't say spainian or portugalian ), 
  same with swahili , from saturday to wednesday . 
  thursday and friday are different . 
  as you can see , catalan week days ( monday to saturday ) are extremely similar to french and italian ones , but we put the `` di - '' in front , while they put it at the end , '' - di '' . 
  as `` dimarts '' vs `` mardi '' and `` martedi '' or `` dijous '' vs `` jeudi '' and `` giovedi '' . 
  this all began in 2006 with the new statute . 
  first it was laminated in the spanish congress ( and people like guerra were bragging about it ) . 
  then there was a referendum to aprove it . 
  then the pp denounced it to the constitutional high court . 
  do you remember the pp asking for `` signatures agaisnt catalonia '' ( sic ) ? 
  meanwhile , on 13 september 2009 , the first `` illegal / informal '' referendum on independence was held in arenys de munt . 
  a groundroot movement was born , similar referenda were organized in several places . 
  eventuall , in less than one year , more than one million people had voted in them . 
  the only parties who really collaborated the this were erc and the cup . 
  on july 2010 de constitutional high court declared illegal ( anticonstitutional ) several articles of the catalan statute . 
  fun enough , verbatim articles in orther statutes , like the andalusian one , are still legal !, 
  also , legally , a statute must have been aproved by the people in a referendum . 
  so , for the past 6 years , catalonia 's highest law has been illegal , as there has not been any other referendum . 
  the saturday after the sentence the largest demonstration , till then , in catalonia 's history was held agains the tribunal decision . 
  although politics also assisted , it was organized by a groundroot organization , omnium cultural , which cares about catalan language and culture . 
  it was the first major demonstration where the claims were mostly , if not all , about independence . 
  meanwhile , on one side you have the young people being born or raised already in democracy , who had bee pro independence as teenagers but voted for mainstream parties deciding to be more coherent , and people who had been in independence movements ( small and with fraternicidal tendencies , see life of brian ) decided to create a new organization , the anc ( assemblea nacional catalana , catalan national assembly ) to push for independence . 
  it was an interclassist non partisan organization ( although many of the founders had been from left andfar left parties in the 80s and 90s ) . 
  and it 's then when together , on 2012 , the anc and omnium cultural joined forces and organized the 11th september demonstration , under the lemma : `` catalonia : a new european state '' , that more than one million people joined . 
  and here is when the political parties started realizing the thinks have changed and since then they are trying to ride the wave . 
  but they still can not control it . 
  so , you mean the eu would expell a part of it without recognizing this part of the eu being an independent country ? 
  `` eu 's chief brexit negotiator agrees with nicola sturgeon that independent scotland would gain automatic entry '' http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/eus-chief-brexit-negotiator-agrees-8796253, 
  your link takes me to one of my own posts ... 
  anyway , you said that fulfilling already all the conditions was not enough , that you 'll have to ammend a lots of treaties . 
  but if that 's the extra problem , the ammending of those treaties would have to be done anyway . 
  and , in the eu , usually you can work with provisional rules . 
  i mean , when eastern germany joined it was n't such a burden to modify those treaties . 
  same when greenland left .
