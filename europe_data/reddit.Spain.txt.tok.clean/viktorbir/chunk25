  and , anyway , read what eu 's chief brexit negotiator has said : that independent scotland would gain automatic entry to the eu !, 
  :-) http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/eus-chief-brexit-negotiator-agrees-8796253, 
  if it was in any way efficient it would be already in use . 
  still much more expensive . 
  all fruits and vegetables from almeria , murcia , andalusia , valencia , going to a boat in the cantabric see ? 
  nonsense . 
  are you really telling me cdc has been ( demonstrated ) to be worse then pp or psoe ( b\u00e1rcenas , eros , rita barber\u00e1 , gurtel , naseiro ... ) just take a look at this , please : https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/anexo:casos_judiciales_relacionados_con_corrupci%c3%b3n_pol%c3%adtica_en_espa%c3%b1a, 
  many proindependence are not nationalists at all . 
  was n't the discussion about being expelled from the eu ? 
  just no . 
  carles puigdemont has never ever said anything like that . 
  either you are lying , you do n't remember what you heard or you did n't understand him . 
  by they way , are you talking about that time , as mayor of girona , when he was quoting carles rahola about the fascists troops entering the town during last war ? 
  a ) even if spain , against margallo 's opinion , was not dissolved , the treaties should already have to be amended . 
  no extra work . 
  b ) if margallo is right , spain and catalonia would be in the exact same position . 
  a ) are you comparing the level of corruption of pp and cdc ? 
  :-d b ) pp is 100 % of spanish government . 
  cdc is maybe 50 % of catalan government . 
  how many seats did pp and psoe , and cdc , get on last spanish elections ? 
  and in catalan ones ? 
  there are anti independence good texts . 
  but clearly the ones you are reading are nothing but propaganda . 
  and i 'm asking you to read good pro independence text , of course , not propaganda ones . 
  clear , now ? 
  sorry , i was talking about the last war in the peninsula . 
  last time there were 3 years of war , i think . 
  i wonder if some of the anti independence spaniards will realize one day it was the people , the masses , who have been leading the movement and the politics who have been adapting to it . 
  by the way , on last elections , what was the support in spain to the most corrupt parties ? 
  what about in catalonia ? 
  if there 's someone manipulated , it 's not us catalans ... 
  have you read any text by pro independence movement ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  it seems you have only read anti independence propaganda . 
  well , i think more than 50 % of spanish ( not including catalonia 's ) exports to europe go thru catalonia . 
  if catalonia is not in the eu that might be a problem . 
  if spain vetoes catalonia , catalonia might also choose not to asume any of kingdom of spain 's debt . 
  that would be fun , too . 
   they will need to be recognized as an independent nation do you realize that if we were not recognized we could not be expelled ? 
  i guess they 'd have to amend all the same treaties to change how much new spain needs to pay to the eu , how manyh meps it gets , it 's contribution to the ecb ... and , by the way , according to what spanish foreign affairs said on saturday , if catalonia leaves spain , spain is dissolved , so , it cesses to exist and by the same logic would be too out of the eu ... 
  you do . 
   keep in mind there was a time we shared king and we even fought in aragon 's side in your succession war . 
  yeah , and in the worst moment you betrayed and abandoned us , like the english did ... 
   our own president called catalans against independence `` collonists '' and `` collaborators '' why do you lie ? 
  ask your girlfriend how many tourist were there . 
  what proportion were just looking the show . 
  where i was , i guess none . 
   hundreds of millions ( hundreds of thousands ), 
   hundreds of millions ( hundreds of thousands ), 
  as i guess you understand spanish , this is from the website of the demonstration :  el 11 de septiembre de 2016 marcar\u00e1 el inicio de una nueva etapa . 
  ** https://apunt.assemblea.cat/cast/ for those who dont understand spanish , here 's the translation of bolded ( by me ) text : `` ready to become a new state '' , `` we are sovereign , we are the catalan republic in the last stage of construction '' , `` an ultimate step to reach our country 's independence '' , `` saying again the catalan republic begins '' , `` we want the institutions to be ready to start the construction of a new country '' , `` we are already catalan republic '' . 
  so , if not a rally asking for catalan independence , what the fuck was this ? 
   if you want specifics , i recommend you read 2-3 hours of european news daily for 5 years , then you 'll have a good grasp . 
  this . 
  tsk tsk . 
  they are pumpkin colour . 
  what 's the big difference between coloured and people of colour ? 
  you do n't know the definition of desert , innit ? 
  europe announces ??? 
  well , i 'd say `` europe annouced more than three months ago '' . 
  do n't lie to us . 
  this has to be the us . 
  please , make it be the us !, 
  i know . 
  that 's why i made a reductio ad absurdum when answering [ this nonsense ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4zmju8/a_majority_of_the_french_64_support_the_burkini/d6x9hns ) . 
  the one i was responding stated the burkini was forbidden on beaches because `` it shows your affiliation to a specific religion , which is not compatible with secularism ( in public place ) . '', 
  which is clearly false . 
   because it shows your affiliation to a specific religion , which is not compatible with secularism ( in public place ) . 
  are you telling me it is forbidden in france to wear an islamic veil in public places ? 
  to wear a kippah ? 
  a catholic monk veil ? 
  a sikh turban ? 
  never heard of it . 
  any source ??? 
  yeah , but if they include the gdp produced by the benefit of being the capital ( having the ministries and the thousands of government workers ) , removing the city but having the ministries and those workers in some other place would mantain that part of the gdp . 
  and in some cities , as it is the case of madrid , that proportion of the city 's gdp is really high . 
  have they accounted for what part of the gdp of the capital is there just because that city is the capital ? 
  i mean , a city like madrid has a great gdp , but it 's mostly due to it being the capital . 
  do you know her ? 
  you know she is forced by her husband ( is she married ) to wear that shirt ? 
  is it ok then the police force her not to wear it ? 
  as if , as it 's the law , it 's fair . 
  ** four fully dressed men force a woman to remove her shirt ** would be an alternate header . 
  any ? 
  here on reddit i 've seen many people taking it for granted , but never anyone showing any evidence . 
  just random accusations . 
  that 's all the evidence ? 
    -  gulen makes a coup attempt with those men in power . 
  fails . 
  any evidence ? 
  is this true , or are you just joking ? 
  argh !, 
  irish also use this nonsense month day notation ? 
  hey , in catalonia saint stephen 's day ( sant esteve ) is a public holiday . 
  however it 's on 26 december . 
  that 's what colonization does . 
  if there was a part of algeria still inhabited by french colonizers , similar difference would be . 
  please , show me the decree or law where it is declared so . 
  i 've read it so many times , but non has given any proof . 
  there are n't .
