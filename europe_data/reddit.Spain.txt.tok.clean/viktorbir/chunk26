  just because many us states have a state flower / bird / mammal / whatever they keep creating these lists . 
  then , if she had voted in autonomic elections , i do n't believe at all she was not allowed to voted back then . 
  unless she wanted to vote in the wrong place . 
  also , if she votes on autonomic elections , it means she has spanish nationality . 
  so , she could not be a weird case that the people at the voting place did n't know how to treat . 
  if spain were to block a catalan state into the eu , most of spanish goods ( more than 50 % ) would have to find another way to reach the rest of the eu , as they would be taxed or stopped at the border , for example . 
  also the eu would lose a net contributor ( in fact , right now , the top contributor per population , i think ) . 
  anyway we could just join the efta and schengen and keep using the euro . 
  it 's simply we are more stable than the country we want to leave . 
  so , saying we are not stable is not a reason not to leave . 
  ana pastor got 169 votes . 
  25 blank votes . 
  ( plus one abstention , of course ) 169 votes are the exact addition of pp ( 137 ) + ciudadanos ( 32 ) . 
  155 votes are almost the exact addition of psoe ( 85 ) + up ( including ecp , comprom\u00eds ... ) ( 45 + 12 + 9 + 5 = 71 ) i guess the abstention comes from one of them . 
  25 blank votes are the exact addition of erc ( 9 ) + pdc ( 8 ) + pnv ( 5 ) + bildu ( 2 ) + cc ( 1 ) source for the number of mp : https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/congreso_de_los_diputados source for the votes : http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/congreso/congreso/salaprensa/notpre?_piref73_7706063_73_1337373_1337373.next_page=/wc/detallenotasalaprensa?idnotasalaprensa=19646&amp;mostrarvolver=n so , it seems you were lying , but without knowing it . 
  you should look for better information sources . 
  rewriting history again ? 
   party ruling catalonia votes for pp 's choice to preside congress . 
  you know you are lying , do n't you ? 
  neither erc nor pdc voted for ana pastor . 
  if you ask for a referendum over a dozen times and the answer has always been no , what do you do ? 
  do you keep on asking permission for , what , 1000 times more ? 
  or you keep on , no matter what they say ? 
   to put things in perspective , the catalan government which makes those claims has been unable to approve the 2016 budget , and has planned a motion of confidendence for september . 
  and the provisional spanish governtment which opposes those claims has not been able to conform a new government since last december . 
  so what ? 
   so , new elections in catalonia are n't exactly unthinkable , new elections ? 
  like elections in december and again in june ? 
   i know some people that can barely speak spanish , and when they go out they seem guiris . 
  guiris from the same country !, 
  someone who has spanish as his second language speaks it like people who have it as a second language !!, 
  did she present the papers showing she was currently living here ? 
  because i was a volunteer in that `` participation process '' and everyone who came with legal papers showing they live here were allowed to vote . 
  i 've now read that , since being at war for the last several years , their nutrition has impoverished and the height reduced . 
  dinka people , who live in south sudan , have , since i can remember , been considered the tallest people in the world . 
  more than south sudan people ? 
  really ? 
  and as catalonia comes from catalan , and catalan has been used in english since centuries ago , we should use it . 
  middleman79 talks about maps . 
  mestermagyar mentions philistia , which is the ancient name that appears on maps older than 2000 years ago . 
  i this whole thread you are just answering me ... 
  who said philistines were related with modern palestinians ? 
  the question was about maps with palestine in them . 
  not about the people living in that place . 
  make sense ? 
  well , yeah . 
  the problem is that the country is named after the people . 
  also , as from greenland you have greenlandic and from iceland you have icelandic , people from england would be englandic , according to your logic , innit ? 
  greek origin ? 
  you know this has not been proved at all . 
  and palestine is just the modern rendering of that philistia . 
  palestina is the modern ( well , latin ) rendering of philistia . 
  well , estonian independence was quite unilateral ... 
  the country is catalonia , the adjective catalan . 
  says the estonian one ... 
  you do n't say germanians or spainians , do n't you ? 
  so better say catalans , not catalonians . 
  you know you make no sense , do n't you ? 
  linking a video twice makes it more true ? 
  weird logic . 
  so you mean you do n't want proofs , with you prejudices you have enough . 
  great . 
  so , your proof is that the us lied about proofs . 
  great . 
  you realize those videos do not prove anything , do n't you ? 
  is there any proof that gulen 's organization was behind the coup ? 
  i would call them `` special '' , more than beautiful . 
  hey , last summer i bought a fan !, 
  we were over 35\u00bac , with lots of humidity , for several days in a row . 
  in summer i have them down during the day , to not let the sun in , and up during the night . 
  in winter , the other way round . 
  well , i know nothing of < -5 \u00bac winters ... ( and not much of < 0\u00bac , either ), 
  look up `` decretos de nueva planta '' . 
  just curiosity , why are you posting it now , when it is from october ... 
  ** [ the clarification ] ( https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/news/297647/clarification-30/ ) and [ the original news ] ( https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/politics/1068437/eu-have-to-be-kidding/ ) . 
  i do n't get `` the vatican '' . 
   the protection of minorities is an important part of democracy , exactly . 
  the protection of children , who can not even vote , is very important . 
  the same in catalan ( fills de puta ) . 
  well , psoe are socialdemocrats only nominally . 
  their politics are more center-right wing ones . 
  and , in fact , up , or at least podemos , are hard to describe in european terms . 
  what they really are is socialpopulists , south american style . 
  he is the head of iu , which is a mix of parties that includes communists parties in it , but not only . 
  and this mix gets even more diluted into up . 
  they are socialdemocrats , mostly . 
  is that really ultraleft for you ? 
   you do n't need to learn history , but just open your mind . 
  you can get independence , but that would be splitting up spain , not `` a colony being free 'd from its colonizer '' . 
  period . 
  by the way , i think no spanish polititian shares your view . 
  none says if there 's independence there will be two new countries , but one heir country and a new country . 
  so , spain would still be on the un , the eu , the nato ... but catalonia should ask to join any international organization . 
   in what form or shape does that change what i 've just said ? 
  you can give an id card to saharians and presence on the parliament . 
  they still were colonies . 
  when does a conquered territory stop being a colony ? 
  you know the cadiz constitution speaks about the spaniard of both hemispheres , that saharians had dni , that guinea ecuatorial was a province , with presence on the parliament , and later an autonomous comunity , do n't you ? 
  spain was still spain without portugal . 
  spain was still spain without flanders .
