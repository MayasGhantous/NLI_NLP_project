  spain was still spain without northern catalonia . 
  spain was still spain without gibraltar and minorca . 
  spain was still spain without argentina , mexico ... spain was still spain without cuba and the phillipines . 
  spain was still spain without equatorial guinea . 
  spain was still spain without sahara and r\u00edo de oro . 
  spain will still be spain without catalonia , do n't worry . 
  we could make an exchange and mend that mid xvii century mistake ... 
   and finally romania and portugal not even being white , or at least black ... 
  i mean those countries do n't even have many asian immigrants , so why are they asian ... 
  they are not asian . 
  romanian is a white european and portugal i 'd say is black . 
  many black people in portugal , in fact . 
  do you know `` double entendre '' , in english , as a double sense ? 
  it 's the same `` entendre '' . 
  `` escrites '' is `` writen '' , in femenine plural . 
  if i had written `` comprendre '' instead of `` entendre '' i guess it would have been easier , but it would not sound so normal . 
  in italian and latin it 's `` intendere '' , in portuguese and spanish `` entender '' , and in french , occitan and catalan `` entendre '' . 
  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/intendo#descendants in fact , the word even exist in english , in the expression `` double entendre '' , something that can be understood in two ways . 
  great . 
  i guess that 's because your ear is not used to it . 
  also , i 'm quite sure you 'd find easier to understand someone speaking western catalan ( the one from valencia ) than eastern ( the none from barcelona ) , because in western catalan non stressed vowels are not reduced so much . 
  in eastern catalan unstressed a , \u00e8 , \u00e9 are reduced to schwa , and unstressed \u00f2 , \u00f3 , u to u. i stays the same . 
  in western catalan unstressed a , i , u stay the sam , unstressed \u00e8 , \u00e9 are reduced to \u00e9 and unstressed \u00f2 , \u00f3 are reduced to \u00f3 . 
  ( just in case , \u00e8 , \u00f2 are open e and o ; \u00e9 , \u00f3 are closed e and o ) . 
  and that 's why many linguists say basque is not a single language , but a linguistic family . 
  nothing at all like german . 
  catalan is an example of very few dialectal differences . 
  the occitan i can hear on tv and on the catalan parliament has no french prosody :-), 
  i guess you mean aranese . 
  as andorran would be just plain catalan . 
  nonsensic making a video about languages but then titling the parts on countries ( where more languages can be spoken ) and not languages . 
  i think they got it wrong . 
  ** body integrity is a human right . 
   why would n't they ? 
  that 's what the bible says . 
  so what ? 
  is the bible a science book or a history book ? 
  where in spain ? 
  only 1/4 has ever , in their life , consumed cannabis ? 
  no way . 
   i 'd love to know exactly what 's in my beer . 
  is n't it stated already ? 
  i mean , any botled drink i 've ever seen in europe explains exactly what 's in it . 
  what 's the problem with the army , you had to exclude them ? 
  coloured is an ethnic group in south africa . 
  and yes , it does n't make any sense , out of that group . 
  you know , us people think someone with a black great grandfather is black , someone with an irish great grandmother is irish , so they might as well say they are neanderthals ... 
   they also had identical foxp2 genes to sapiens , meaning they likely had a rudimentary language ( likely rudimentary since their larynxes are n't as sharp as ours ) would n't that mean rudimentary voice , not rudimentary language ? 
  a ) english is something like my fourth language . 
  b ) your link for `` carpet '' is a ** fitted ** carpet . 
  c ) the carpets i 'm talking about are nothing at all like the picture of that rug ( is n't that called a mat ? 
  you have not fucking idea what an ethnic group is , do n't you ? 
  maybe you are talking about tapestry , not carpets . 
   the sad cheap flat became way more livable and full of dust ... :-), 
  in catalan that would be `` el rapte del serrall '' . 
  it 's an opera . 
  if they are tapestries , that 's not what i 'm asking about . 
  so , not a thing in croatia , i guess :-), 
  were they russians ? 
  i 'm just trying to see if this is just a russian thing . 
  no , tapestry and carpets are different things : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tapestry https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carpet if anything , i 'm asking about carpets used as if they were tapestry . 
  is she russian ? 
  take a look : https://www.google.com/search?q=russian+carpet+wall&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiwm7nasvpmahwjdbokhw2wbmqq_auibygb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=678, 
  watch the transnistria video elsewhere in the subreddit and you 'll see carpets on the walls . 
  explanation : last sunday the spanish football cup final was played , by seville fc and fc barcelona . 
  the spanish government forbid pro catalan independence flag inside the stadium . 
  however on friday a judge ruled against it and allowed the flags . 
  many pro indepedence flags were waved during the game and the answer in twitter by spanish nationalist and unionist was big too . 
  this one says `` long live spain !, 
  pro independence catalans motherfuckers ! '', 
  and shows a map with the spaniard flag on top . 
  covering also portugal . 
  for a really weird definition of europe . 
  edit : why the downvotes ? 
  their definition includes nothing to the east of prague , i think . 
  and in fact it was renamed to a greek expression , into the city , or something like this , innit ? 
  the one with the stars instead of the coat of arms ? 
  or the main difference is the shade of the blue ? 
  catalan flag is just this , catalan flag . 
  a flag representing catalonia and the catalans ( also used to mean catalan language and so on ) . 
  the stared flag has a different meaning . 
  it states suport for the independence of catalonia . 
  you do n't want to appropriate the everyone 's flag for a political issue . 
  sevilla and fcb hate each other ? 
  really ? 
  edit : why the downvotes ? 
  is there any history of hate between sevilla fc and fc barcelona supporters that i do n't know of ? 
  i know hate between rcd espanyol and fcb , or real madrid and fcb , or betis and sevilla , but never heard anything about sevilla and fcb . 
  i remember , decades ago , olive used as the skin colour of indians ( hindustan , not america ) . 
  many do . 
  tomorrow there will be elections on the main pro-independence society , the ones who organize the hundreds of thousands people demonstrations . 
  well , the person who everyone thinks will be elected president is liz castro , a us born woman ( she may have lived here for 10-20 years ) with spanish ( andalusian ) great grand parents . 
  also , the second in comand in barcelona 's town council , gerardo pisarello , who is 100 % pro indepencende , is an argentinian with an italian family name who has lived in catalonia for about 10 years . 
  i know many africans who support independence , for example . 
  western europe is not so homogeneous as some people might think . 
  yeah , we have black catalans , brown catalans , and all colours of the rainbow catalans . 
  but yeah , he is not the avearage catalan , but not really that far .
