  very conservative , bordering ( or fully ) sociological francoism . 
  i 've seen them in twitter . 
  in this picture flags are ok , but look at the kids : https://twitter.com/xafemho_tot/status/843460055987052545 here you have flags with the eagle on pictures 1 , 3 and 4 . 
  the guy on picture 2 is josep anglada , a well known fascists , former member of fuerza nueva and frente nacional , and founder of pxc : https://twitter.com/jordisalvia/status/843462383339290624 this is from some fascists groups , pxl , espa\u00f1a 2000 and pxc ( united under the name respeto ) , with a typical fascist lemma , `` locals first '' : http://filesedc.com/uploads/0/img/2016/10/1200/manifestacio-unionista-a-barcelona-16.jpg, 
  quite a few of them . 
  i 've seen many pictures on twitter and as usual : falange , nostalgics of franco , pxc , espa\u00f1a 2000 , red berets ( carlists ) , generaci\u00f3n identitaria , the typical blonde women with that `` just out of the hair dresser '' look , legionarios ... 
  i 've seen a picture with 6 peruvians in traditional dresses and the peruvian flag and , just after them , pxc and espa\u00f1a 2000 with a sign saying `` primer els de casa '' ( locals first ), 
  according to sociological polls : * the more leftist you are , the more pro independence * if your language is catalan , more chance of being pro , if it 's spanish , more chance of being against * if you were born in catalonia , more chance of being pro , if you were born in spain , more chance of being against * the younger you are , the more pro independence * the more educated you are , the more pro independence and , in fact , all these factors are quite linked . 
  if you are born here , it 's much more possible catalan is your language . 
  if you are younger you 'll probably be more leftist and more educated . 
  if you are older , the more chances you are from an immigration wave from spain , with spanish as your language and lower education . 
  and so on . 
  i think you did n't understand the question :  are there a lot of franco `` nostalgia-ists '' ( for lack of a better word ) among catalans who wish to remain a part of spain ? 
  of course among the unionist there are much much more franco nostalgists than in the general population !, 
  i mean , i can not think there is a non unionist franco nostalgist !, 
  yes , there are . 
  and almost everyone who is on the far right is unionist . 
  also they are the most visible and vocal . 
  in all this kind of demonstrations you 'll see lots of flags with the imperial eagle ( the one used during franco 's time ) . 
  because you have seen non censured pictures of the demonstration ? 
  lots of people with francoist flags ... 
  are you really saying that being against that eu constitution is the same as being against the eu ? 
   if spain was leaving the eu , it would probably be supported by catalonia so not really . 
  no , not at all . 
  only a party with under 10 % of votes is against the eu . 
  if you look a close up pictures you 'll see many many flags with the fascist eagle ... 
  where 's that major street you are talking about ? 
  i mean , they were 6500 people , according the police . 
  that 's something like 2000m \u00b2 . 
  10m x 200m is not a major street nowhere in europe , i think . 
  well , in small villages , not in any city . 
  but first talks about total resistance . 
  but in this case it 's not the journalist to blame , but the researcher . 
   `` in order to have total resistance to hiv , you have to carry two doses of the mutated gene -- one from each parent . 
  if you get only one dose , you will not be resistant to infection . 
  however , you may be able to delay the onset of hiv once you become infected . 
  that 's because , in patients with one copy of the mutation , the amount of ` portals ' or ` doorways ' that hiv can use is reduced by about 50 percent . 
  that slows down virus replication , which is the most important factor in aids progression . '', 
  so , 10 % not `` total resistent '' but `` resistent enough to delay the onset of hiv '' . 
  has he converted to wahhabism ? 
  you sure do n't know about subtropical climate : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_locations_with_a_subtropical_climate#/media/file:subtropical.png, 
  they were asking about north-west . 
  your link is about north-east . 
  you are welcome . 
  i think you are talking about [ serrallonga ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1081731/ ) , not really a film but a 2 episode mini-series , about the life of [ joan sala i ferrer ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/joan_sala_i_ferrer ) , aka serrallonga . 
  edit : [ a trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqrpdxh4f-0 ), 
  also , exposure . 
  if you are more exposed to catalan than to portuguese , you 'll understand catalan easier than portuguese . 
  in catalan parliament people speaks catalan , spanish and occitan without no problems . 
  in the spanish congress if you speak catalan they stop you . 
  in the senate , officially the territorial chamber , the same , except one session per year . 
  we have been asking this for ages . 
  spain has always been against . 
  latin is not romance . 
  it 's like saying your grandparents are of the same generation you , your siblings and your cousins are . 
  thanks !, 
   in spanish ( say , in madrid ) , the sound is produced by placing the tongue flatter and closer to the teeth , in standard italian ( say , in milan ) the tongue is more rounded and closer to the soft palate . 
  is there any language that considers them different sounds ? 
  thanks !, 
  thanks !, 
   ( most ) germans can not hear the difference between the spanish ll sound and the italian gl sound , i guess you mean italan gli , innit ? 
  also , what 's the difference ? 
  are n't both / \u028e / ? 
  you forgot at least andorra . 
  also , how do they say catalonia ? 
  that post was comparing two types of ham . 
  you are not comparing two types of wine . 
  you need to add the catalan one . 
  he is learning catalan , hence we 'll speak to him in spanish . 
  i 'm sorry , but ananas is just a ridicule word . 
  * pinya * is much cooler ( and pineapple acceptable ) . 
  today i learnt tarragona is supposed to come from phoenician . 
  on the other hand , pyrenees is not italic / germanic , as eastern pyrenees department is painted , but greek . 
  aslo , alacant comes from arabic , not germanic . 
  why only the decentralised ones ? 
  i mean , why not adding the euratom one , and putting barcelona on the map ? 
   the language of brussels and strasbourg so , dutch and german ? 
  was it under a sofa ? 
  what a pity you live in a place and you do n't even know what is the local language . 
  lots of spaniards were ( are ? ), 
  convinced catalan is a dialect of spanish . 
  / u/ruimtetaart seems to disagree . 
  same as `` sispli '' does n't appear in any dictionary . 
  the process seems to be : `` remove the last vowel and anything that follows , replace with - i and move the stress to the previous vowel '' . 
  this way you get : * merc\u00e8s -  merci * si us plau -  sisplau -  sispli * pilar -  pili * maria -  mari * xavier -  xavi i mean , it can have a french influence or even origin , but it looks like a more general trend . 
  cool . 
  in catalan the `` correct '' word is * merc\u00e8s * but everyone says * merci * , stress in the first syllable . 
  what 's the difference ? 
  at least in french merci and mersi would be pronounced exactly the same . 
  cool , like in catalan :-), 
  hey , then you pronounce it like us catalans . 
  the `` correct '' word is * merc\u00e8s * but everyone , informally , says * merci * , stress on the first syllable .
