  how do you pronounce it ? 
  m\u00e9rci or merc\u00ed ? 
  i mean , strees on the first syllable or on the second ? 
  in catalan we usually say * merci * pronounced m\u00e8rci .

  i 'd say they ** pronounce ** / ` grasis / , but say * gr\u00e0cies * . 
  it would be like saying in barcelona we do n't say * gr\u00e0cies * but * gr\u00e0cias * . 
  also , i 'm not sure merci is a loan from french , or just influenced by it . 
  many silly words change the ending to - i. 
  have you ever heard the spanish `` porfi '' instead of `` por favor '' ? 
  or in catalan `` sispli '' instead of `` si us plau '' . 
  i 'd say it 's the same , from merc\u00e8s -  merci . 
  have you read the text on the image ? 
  also , why are you mentioning the eu ? 
  do you mean that french guyana is in europe , not america , because it 's part of the eu ? 
  what does kastellet mean ? 
  in catalan * castellet * means little castle . 
  miss denmark does n't look like the same person in the two pictures of her . 
  in fact , in the portrait one she could be from this century . 
  most recent data ... from 7 years ago . 
  i 'd say in less than 10h ... 12h making some stops . 
   a little scar which is still not acceptable for a male business executive where in the world do you live ? 
  a field of grain ? 
  really ? 
  the legend has always been about a golden shield . 
  that 's what i mean . 
  somaliland was as colony , so green . 
  ethiopia was invaded for a few years , yellow like afghanistan . 
  somaliland should be green . 
  also , ethiopia should n't be green . 
  at most , yellow like afghanistan . 
  arranged the typos , thanks . 
  i guess most germans feel safe despite car accidents . 
  or despite accidental drownings . 
  or despite many other things . 
  superilles ( superblocks ) will be 2x2 , 2x3 or ( mostly ) 3x3 of the current blocks . 
  it 's been a church for maybe half a century . 
  but just the crypt underground . 
  the main church , as you say , since november 2010 . 
  that 's maybe one or two days per year , at most . 
  i think he is counting people , not km \u00b2 . 
  a country , but not an independent country . 
  do you know what multiculturalism means ? 
  living apart , each culture in a different neighbourhood . 
  i 'm all for interculturalism . 
  mixing , learning from each other . 
  most likely , segregation . 
  if all the immigrants stay together in concrete places , their original culture will be transplanted altogether . 
  : - dddd maybe [ like this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/d3/fd/d4/d3fdd41c692b01f57e422b26db9d6116.jpg ), 
   i was n't commenting on rights at all . 
  i thought we were giving reasons why some people think scotland has the right to a referendum a to independence and catalonia does n't . 
  maybe i 'm on the wrong thread ...  because the most loudly proclaimed arguments from your side have always been `` we have a different language '' and `` we do n't want to pay for spain '' . 
  if your language were not official in the ue because the country you belong to does n't allow it , if attorneys warned you against using your langauge in court , just in case , if 90 % of tv was not in your language , but in the language of the country yours belongs to , if the country you belong to promotes its language internationally , but not yours ... maybe you 'd understand the language part . 
  if before taxes you were ranked in a position , but after taxes ( and getting back as public services ) you were ranked lower ( the others do n't move ) , if even you pay lots of taxes there is no money to improve your near distance trains everybody uses , but it is spent in hight speed trains in wastelands , with stations in under 1000 inhabitants villages , if your money was used to promote the language and culture that tries to susbtitute yours , not yours , if even if you are the one paying more and one of the ones getting less , you 're being called unsolidary , if they tell you the money spent in public workers , museums and whatever in the capital city must count as money paid on your nation , if the central government do n't allow some international flights on your airports , only on the capital ... maybe you would understand the paying part . 
  but , hey , yeah , maybe we should talk about the climate or the clothes ... 
  have you been here or are you taking it out of your ass ? 
  rail ? 
  why do you want rails ? 
  well , in fact in this picture there are lots of rails , just underground . 
  but without the motorbikes the traffic would be madder . 
  imagine everyone now riding a bike on a car . 
  yes . 
  this is l'esquerra de l'eixample . 
  the main ( wider ) street is carrer d'arag\u00f3 . 
  on left it begins bifurcatin into avinguda de roma . 
  the square is the pla\u00e7a letamendi , and the other street cutting the square is carrer d'enric granados . 
  why ? 
  i guess you mean same city . 
  it 's maybe 1 or 2 km away ... 
  oh , look , czech has dialects !, 
  anyway , i like how you implicitely agree that our situation is not good . 
  so , i guess there 's a big movement in czech republic to give away independence , being part , of , let say , germany , having german imposed upon you , having only 10 % of judicial sentences in czech language , having your language not part of the working languages in the ue , getting back only 60 % of the taxes you pay ... yeah , i 'm sure most czechs are for this . 
  how else can one understand that the votes of 49 % are more important than that of 51 % ? 
  ok , so , in the 21st century you must kill and die to get independence . 
  in europe . 
  great . 
  by the way , about not willing to die en masse , well , spanish militars had a saying that for spain to go ok you had to bomb barcelona at least once every 50 years . 
  and the canons on the fortress next to the city were not pointing outside , but to the city ... 
  well , it was situations that might differ ** that might explain why one has the right and the other one does n't !, 
  ** otherwise , why not list climate , language , clothes ... 
  so , czechs have the right to be independent , but we do n't . 
  is that ? 
  and , why ? 
  i do n't know what interest you have , but that 's what you are saying , unionist votes are worth more than the others . 
   tv , the loudest catalans are always insulting the rest of spain can you give a few examples ? 
  on the other side , take a look at these : https://www.pinterest.com/heroisindepes/herois-indepes/ they are not `` the loudest spaniards '' , they are mostly first line politicians of main parties . 
   catalonia has never been a country , while scotland has . 
  read some history book , please . 
  also , according to this logic , most corrent countries should n't be independent ... 
  yeah , i agree . 
  at least 60-65 % has to vote no to remain in spain . 
  do you mean that while catalonia is part of spain it must not act as such ?
