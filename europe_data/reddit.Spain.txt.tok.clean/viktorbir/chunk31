  do you mean we must pay taxes , but can not get them back ? 
  how can a country keep another one with 51 % of the population who actually do n't support the idea ? 
  of course , unionists votes are worth more than pro independence ones !!!, 
  i mean , they are voting the right thing , innit ? 
  hence , there vote is worth more . 
   the whole concept of catalonia being a special state is a joke , they do n't deserve any special rights . 
  what `` special rights '' ? 
  we want just the usual rights other peoples have . 
  do the czechs have any `` special rights '' ??? 
  on polls , the unionists give emotional arguments ( i feel spanish ) as the main ones ; the pro independence do n't . 
  do n't know what kind of people you meet . 
  are you a polandian ? 
  we are catalans :-), 
   but the catalan govnernment will do nothing , despite the `` referendum '' results . 
  do you have the lottery number , too ? 
  by more than 30 you mean almost 100 , innit ? 
  ;-) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_europe just romance languages are more than 25 . 
  go to africa . 
  in many places you 'll find people speaking : 1 ) the language of their nation ( people ) ; 2 ) the main language of the are , that might not be the same ; 3 ) the main language of the country ; 4 ) the colonial language . 
  and , also , maybe some commerce lingua franca of those countries . 
  so , a gonja living in accra might speak 1 ) gonja , 2 ) ga ( local language in accra ) , 3 ) akan ( a.k.a. 
  twi ) , the main language of ghana , 4 ) english , 5 ) jula ( a.k.a. 
  catalan here . 
  i can read most portuguese . 
  when i 've been there , everyone has understood me , i 've understood everyone . 
  i 've never learnt portuguese . 
  ha ha ha !, 
  so , as native americans have the same fenotype , they have one single culture , or course . 
  same culture alaskan skimos as pueblo indians . 
  same with hispanic americans . 
  same culture an argentinian jew as a nahuatl . 
  and , of course , same culture shared by barack obama as a gullah . 
  that a ) diversity has nothing to do with skin colour and b ) the problem is not diversity , but poverty and inequality . 
  oh ! , so now `` white '' means european ? 
  i think there are not many europeans in toronto , for example ... by the way , i 'm european , catalan . 
  a black catalan is more similar to me than a white usa person is . 
  so , all `` white '' are the same ??? 
  great !, 
  have you not read this answer ? 
   400 years of north american history demonstrate that ethnic diversity positively correlates with a broad range of social problems , including crime . 
  a ) 400 years of north american history demonstrate that ** poverty ** and ** inequality ** and ** discrimination ** and ** racism ** positively correlate with a broad range of social problems , including crime . 
  b ) whatever is demonstrated for the usa is not * `` a rule that applies to all societies everywhere '' * , as you said . 
  read again what you have written :  and the reason canada 's statistics tend to be better is because only 2 % of canadians are black , and 1 % are hispanic . 
  in some of our states , 40 % are hispanic . 
  less diversity = less crime is a rule that applies to all societies everywhere . 
  you are talking about blacks and hispanics , not about poverty and inequality . 
  and say literally `` less diversity = less crime '' ... 
  then again , the reason is not diversity , but inequality and racism . 
  the map is not about murder , but homicide . 
  alcoholism ? 
  suicides ? 
  poverty ? 
  aculturation ? 
  just guessing . 
   and the reason canada 's statistics tend to be better is because only 2 % of canadians are black , and 1 % are hispanic . 
  in some of our states , 40 % are hispanic . 
  less diversity = less crime is a rule that applies to all societies everywhere . 
  i guess you mean inequality , not diversity . 
  if you had 20 % of black canadians , living in the same social conditions as the rest of the population , i do n't think crime would raise at all . 
  [ the tuvans or tuvinians ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tuvans ), 
  per day ? 
  per century ? 
  shitty maps with a shitty legend . 
  yes , but a big amount come from spanish speaking places . 
  in catalonia , no foreigners come from catalan speaking places and even the ones coming from spanish speaking ones are a lower percent than those in madrid . 
  here the percents of north africans , black africans , pakistanis , chinese ... are bigger . 
  les garrigues is a county with less than 20.000 inhabitants ... 
  anyway , according to [ idescat ] ( http://www.idescat.cat/poblacioestrangera/?b=8&amp;geo=com:18 ) almost a 12 % of the population is foreign born . 
  and at least in a village , juneda (  3000 inhabitants ) it 's over 20 % . 
  what does the number mean , in the spanish map ? 
  in the european there are percentages , but i do n't get the numbers on the spanish one . 
  well , look at the proportion of newcomers in catalan schools versus castille or navarra 's schools . 
  in this century we have had 1m immigrants , for a total current population of 7,4 m people . 
  these are young people , who have more kids . 
  so , imagine a 15 or 20 % of kids who have not been born here / are the children of just arrived people . 
  also , castille & le\u00f3n have a very low population , very dispersed , with many very small schools , which helps a lot . 
   in 20 years time the progressive nations of western europe will be islamic regimes . 
  do you have the lottery numbers , too ? 
  are you telling me catalan children beat the shit up of angela merkel with sticks , every christmas ? 
  ridiculous ? 
  it 's simply amazing !, 
  we had it shit a gasoline kart for my then 4 year old nephew , many years ago !, 
  of course , he had fed it with lots of tangerines and nuts the previous weeks . 
  the adjective is catalan , not catalonia . 
  you might be austrian , but your neighbours are not germanians ;-), 
  i think in leningrad cowboys go to america ... 
  is she barefoot !? 
  argh !, 
  aside it just being another name for catalan , writing in english it is valencian . 
  no - o. 
  in catatan it is `` valenci\u00e0 '' , no - no . 
  really fucked , if you believe that might be a problem . 
  as a novelty , not a tradition . 
  just curiosity , what 's according to you their traditional name in spanish ? 
  a ) before hitler guns were much restricted in germany b ) hitler in fact relaxed the laws to get guns c ) the concept `` the people in arms '' has been mostly used by the left , specially the far left . 
  i mean , old black panthers were quite left winged , for example . 
  education in catalonia , balearic islands and maybe half valencian schools is done in catalan . 
  spain 1,4 and 1,3 ? 
  either he has misspelt 1,04 as 1,4 or he is including catalan / spanish as foreign . 
  the linked data gives me 99 % study english , 5 % study french .
