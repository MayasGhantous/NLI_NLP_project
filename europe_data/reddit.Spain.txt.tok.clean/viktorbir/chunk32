  that 's 1,04 languages , not 1,4 . 
  of course suomi , finland and however it is called in the different saami languages has the same etymology . 
  same with germany and nemska . 
  or russia and ven\u00e4 . 
  or france and bro-c ` hall ... 
  france etymology is land of the franks . 
  then , you can ask for frank etymology , but that 's another thing . 
  how did they decide what countries to include ? 
  i mean , there 's no andorra , cuba , haiti , antigua & barbuda , gambia ... 
  that 's not how etymology work . 
  so , suomi comes from some latin word that means land of men ? 
  in ** the ** local language , because , as we all know , every country has one only and single language . 
  in the spanish coat of arms the lion represents the ancient kingdom of le\u00f3n , spanish for lion . 
  the name of the kingdom comes from the city of le\u00f3n . 
  but etymologically the name of the city has nothing to do with lions !, 
  its name is a corruption of latin `` legio '' , a legion , as the city was founded as the base place of a roman legion . 
  but number 1 of the whole europe ? 
  really ? 
   `` expats '' ( immigrants :p ) . 
  ** rich ** immigrants . 
  and madrid number 3 !!!, 
  ( and # 1 of european cities ! ), 
  will they make public the list of `` non conventional sex acts '' ? 
  it 's not for me , it 's for a friend who wants to widen his horizons ... 
  the us recycles more than canada ? 
  really ? 
  and `` my taylor is rich . '', 
  are well known here . 
  east and west ? 
  i consider them to be north and south . 
  what is their definition of a `` terrorist attack '' ? 
  i mean , 10 terrorist attacks in spain ? 
  only if you consider a terrorist attack something like breaking an atm . 
  we do n't have braveheart or other hollywood blockbusters ... 
  same as independences of norway , iceland , estonia or slovakia were `` bad to everyone '' ? 
  at least the catalan countries look ok . 
  legitimacy : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legitimacy_ ( political ) legality : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legality, 
  that will be exactly what people will be voting . 
  that 's the idea of adding the `` in the form of a republic '' . 
  so , they have to choose between a spanish monarchy and a catalan republic and decide what do they prefer , spain or a republic . 
  you are confusing legitimate , legal and authorized . 
  80 % of the population wanting a referendum makes it legitimate . 
  so , a country like denmark is too poor and small to say out of the eu ? 
    one of the busiest ports in the mediterranean . 
  two , i 'd say . 
  you can say the referendum would not be authorized ( by spain ) , even illegal . 
  but never illegitimate . 
  where do you get your fantasy numbers ? 
  on last catalan elections , hold as a plebiscit , and with the largest turnout in decades , 48 % voted for yes parties , 39 % for no parties and 11 % for non-positioned parties . 
  most predictions say the result depends much on turnout . 
  so , if only 50 or 55 % vote , it would be about 80 % or more yes . 
  if 80 % would vote the result would be closer to 50 % yes 50 % no . 
  so , the unionists have two choices : a ) boycott it . 
  but it 's a big problem . 
  about 40 % of people is sure to vote for yes . 
  if only 25 % of unionists are democratic enough and vote , there would be a turnout of over 50 % and they 'd loose . 
  b ) participate , and convince everyone undecided to vote no . 
  but if they do n't get a very large turnout , they 'd loose . 
  i guess that 's the reason they do n't want the referendum to be held . 
  not according some constitutionalists , including some of the writers . 
  no , it has n't . 
  1 october is 39 days before 9 november . 
  spain 's debt can be used as a bargaining tool . 
  if they do n't recognize us , they must keep all the debt . 
  which is unsustainable . 
  the eu do n't want spain to default . 
  the question might be translated as : `` do you prefer the monarchy imposed by the fascist dictator franco or a new republic chosen by the people ? '', 
  now , read the whole article , not only the misleading title , which puts quotes to a sentence not on the answers . 
  so , in fact , what he says is that there are other territories juridically in a better position to reivindicate the self determination right ... 
  when did un talk about catalonia ? 
   csqp , will decide its posture on the referendum today through a militant vote . 
  today ? 
  and who are csqp ? 
  and , before the metre , you 'd have similar things with the current units . 
  in barcelona , next to the cathedral , you can still see one with the lenght of a `` cana '' ( cane ) . 
  look for the original meaning of prince , which is the one used here : ruler . 
  excuse me ? 
  not a prince , but a ** co - ** prince . 
  ** co ** - prince . 
  this reminds me of xavier sala-i-mart\u00edn , a catalan economist . 
  he has hundreds of jackets , of different colours of patters , two copies of each ( one in his catalan house , one in his us house ) . 
  so , the borg collective is from malta ? 
  and i think france should be blue , in fact . 
  ai n't martin also a first name ? 
  link to the tweet : https://twitter.com/ppopular/status/869152486489305088, 
  does he live in the vatican ? 
  to me britons sounds like the proper word , the one you expect to find in a ( serious ) newspaper . 
  brit sounds like a nickname , you can use it in reddit , on a tabloid , but that 's all . 
  so , if you worked as much as germans you could increase occupation a 50 % !, 
  a ) yes , el pa\u00eds ca n't be trusted . 
  b ) this is in the extreme case the spanish government , by force , impedes the celebration of a referendum . 
  so , imagine , they sent the guardia civil , the national police and/or the army to close the poll stations . 
  it 's in this case the parliament would declare independence . 
  a mininum tornout , as the venetian convention explains , is a de facto veto for the ones favouring the status quo . 
  imagine a 55 % turnout minimum . 
  so , if 40 % votes yes , 15 % votes no , and 45 % does n't vote is yes . 
  but if 54 % votes yes and 46 % does n't vote is no . 
  is this what you want ? 
  promote the no voters to in fact do n't vote ? 
  excuse me ?
