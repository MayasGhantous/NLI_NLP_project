  what extra rights do we have ? 
  i mean , for example , our representatives can not speak our language in the spanish or the european parliament , for example . 
  this looks as less rights , to me , not more . 
  well , if the spanish gorvernment by force does not allow a referendum ( that 's the case we are discussing ) , only a radical answer is possible . 
  so , if catalonia wants to hold a referendum and spain by force does n't allow it ( that 's what we are discussing ) , the ones going against democracy are the catalan government , not the spanish one ? 
  great !, 
   the region is doing comparatively well , the language is in good shape and spain is a progressive , stable , peaceful democracy . 
  you are great with jokes , sir !, 
  if the uk would use force to impede a referendum , as is the case we are discussing ? 
  catalan here . 
  you shoud get your information from not so biased news sources . 
  a ) the idea is that if , by force , the spanish government would impede a referendum to be held , independence would be declared . 
  on last elections pro independence parties got the absolute majority of the mp and the relative majority of the votes ( just memory , something like 48 % of votes to pro independence parties , 40 % to unionist parties ) . 
  b ) this it not anything new , as has been stated for ages ( well months ) . 
  i do . 
  an invasion , with soldiers , tancs and so on ? 
  in western europe ? 
  yeah , or course !, 
  then i guess spain would asume all its debt and declare bankruptcy . 
  now you need to give us a map with inequality index . 
  i mean , it 's 80 % of the population having about this purchasing power , 10 % more and 10 % less or only 40 % , 10 % much much more , 50 % muche less ? 
  yeah , it makes me think you are a neo-nazi . 
  your link uses the expression `` continously used '' , the one i 'm answering does n't . 
  read this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/senyera you see the dates are older than the ones of the danish flag . 
  the guy i 'm answering said nothing about independent countries , sorry . 
   dannebrog is the worlds oldest flag still in use . 
  i 'm sorry , but ours is older . 
  in case anyone wonders why some have those ribons / shadows / whatever you call them on the cross and others do n't : traditionally ( in european heraldics ) , you can not put in a shield a metal next to a metal or a colour next to an colour . 
  what is a metal ? 
  gold or silver , so yellow or white . 
  what a colour ? 
  any colour that is not yellow or white . 
  traditional ones are red , black , blue and green . 
  not so much used , orange and purple . 
  black , orange and purple are exceptions , as they can be next to both colours and metals . 
  you can see this on many flags combining yellow and red , red and white , having white between two other colours ... is this case , you can not put a red cross on a blue field , so aland islands have the yellow shadow on the cross and iceland a white one . 
  nor blue on a red field , s.so norway has the white shadow and orkney the yellow one . 
  faroe flag i gess is neither ancient nor follows traditional shield rules . 
  you realize he was not italian , do n't you ? 
   and also often associated with gypsies really ? 
  never heard about this . 
  where ? 
   one of the first air raids against civilians in history not really according wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aerial_bombing_of_cities * 1849 venice * 1911 ain zara * 1912 adrianople * 1914 mazatl\u00e1n * 1914 antwerp * 1915 great yarmouth , sheringham , king 's lynn * 1915 london * 1916-1918 england * 1920s iraq * 1920 taleeh * 1929 naco * 1936 harar and jijiga * 1936 madrid * 1937 durango and ja\u00e9n, 
  local elections every year ? 
  how does this work ? 
  also , is london mayor election not part of local elections ? 
  now i want to see this graph including london \u00b9 and england minus london \u00b9 . 
  \u00b9 london metropolitan area, 
  do n't let the title misguide you . 
  he has lost because of the budget cuts , but the total of the pro-independence parties have increased both votes and seats . 
  catalonia is a nation . 
  what it is not is an independent country . 
  a big difference . 
  do n't look then for the belgian one . 
  15:13 , i think !, 
  in fact , the [ catalan flag ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_catalonia ) , same design from 1082 , predates them all . 
  edit : link syntax arranged . 
  of course !, 
  that 's the reason nobody in europe drinks coca-cola , uses google , watches american films or tv series , or buys apple products !, 
  and `` around here '' is ? 
  by the way , then portugal is eastern europe ? 
  slovenia has a gdp per capita higher than greece and portugal . 
  czeck republic 's one is already higher than portugal 's one . 
  so , you question makes no sense . 
  it has already happened . 
  has n't czech republic done it already ? 
  so , i guess you do n't fancy rugby . 
  i mean , the usap won the french league last time in 2009 and has been finalist quite a few times . 
  and everywhere they are , they are lots of catalan flags , and their hymn is in catalan . 
  and their motto , `` fierce d'\u00eatre catalan '' . 
  about the catalan dragons , they are the only non british team in the european league . 
  and really , you have never heard anything from pascal comelade ? 
  he is really a great musician . 
  i guess you do n't like rugby , or you 'd have heard about the usap or the catalans dragons . 
  the usap has won the league at least once in the last decade and the catalans dragons is a grean rugby xiii team , that plays also in the british league . 
  and pascal comelade ? 
  never heard his music ? 
  edit : more about rugby . 
  what about `` le quart d'heure catalan '' ? 
  it would be less than 8 % of our gdp , as it is right now . 
  then , according to you , countries belonging to the european union are not independent , is n't it ? 
  what a ** poorly ** done federal european state might bring . 
  we are paying way more than solidarity might ask for . 
  in fact , if catalonia needs a bailout , it 's because it loses a 10 % of its gdp to spain . 
  imagine : before taxes you earn 110 and your poor neighbour earns 90 . 
  after paying and redistributing taxes you get 99 and your neighbour 101 . 
  why would ever in the world your neighbour want to work harder if this way he already gets more than you ???? 
  and now , on top of this , you get that the central state does not defend your culture . 
  for example , maltese is official in the eu but catalan , spoken by millions more people , is not , because spain does n't want it to be . 
  ** if this is your idea of a federal european state , of course there would be less than stellar results ** it 's too easy to speak without knowing the real facts . 
  by the way , as germans are not `` germanians '' or french are not francians , we are catalans , not `` catalonians '' . 
  and modern age . 
  we shared the king with the spaniards , but nothing more . 
  there 's and 8 % of gdp that goes to central government . 
  it is 16bn $ per year . 
  in europe , the max that goes to central government is about 4 % . 
  many rich european regions would be asking for bailout if they were taken away an 8 % of their gdp . 
  thanks . 
  but the word was alright ? 
  is this not the word ?
