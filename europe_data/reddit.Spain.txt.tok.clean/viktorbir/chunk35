  however , since the first of january , it 's been forbiden in the whole catalonia , so no problem here . 
  anyway , i 'd not go to bullfighting anywhere , not even to have a first hand view of how cruel it is . 
  you 'd be supporting it . 
  if you come to barcelona , do n't sit and drink or eat at any of the terrasses in the rambla . 
  extremly expensive . 
  no idea of the quality , as i know of none who has ever sit there ( only tourists ) . 
  as someone told you , do n't go into bars or restaurants that have only tourists . 
  and check the prices before . 
  they must have them shown on the outside of the restaurant ( not so with bars , sorry ) . 
  i 'd also avoid any restaurant that has a waiter in the street with a menu trying to get people inside . 
  in the original post you did n't specify what kind of fgm you were talking about . 
  of course i know about the others . 
  in fact , i 've participated in campaigns among west african immigrant women in catalonia trying to eradicate fgm . 
  i just wanted to be sure you knew what you were talking about , and that an equivalent mutilation is forbiden if done to a woman , but not to a men . 
   i 'm not sure that given the historical , cultural and social issues surrounding the two sex-specific genital mutilations they could ever be considered `` the same '' just because the anatomy being removed is related . 
  so , what really matters is not the mutilation per se , but the historical , cultural and social issues ? 
  have you hear about female genital mutilation type ia ? 
  it consists in removing the prepuce of the clitoris . 
  it is forbidden almost everywhere . 
  why it is not the same for removing the prepuce of the glans ? 
  have you read the whole article ? 
  the only real example it gives is between second cousins . 
   ruba was 18 when she married her ** second ** cousin . 
  where have you been in barcelona ? 
  only to the tourist places , i guess . 
  check how many languages are spoken in london , berlin or barcelona ... 
  what 's special about this song ? 
  it was quite normal when it was released . 
  a good one , but according to that age 100 % . 
  why are you all talking about georgia when what russia wanted to annexate was abkhasia and southern ossetia , not the whole georgia ? 
  your 's is much much better . 
  at least it is ridiculous on purpose . 
  if you show me the original banners i 'll tell you wether it has the same effect . 
  what 's hilarious about him ? 
  there were the legal entities of castile and of aragon , a confederation . 
  not spain . 
  i was talking about the political entity , not about the geographical one . 
  politically , it can be argued wether spain was born either after the end of the succession war or after the cadis courts , during french napoleonic ocupation . 
  in fact , it was never the possession of the legal entity that is the nation-state of spain . 
  it was part of castile for a couple of centuries . 
  spain existed before gibraltar was turned to the british ??? 
  are you one of those who say seneca was a spaniard ? 
  cheese or cheesy ? 
  :-) a compilation of `` how come this was a hit !? '', 
  `` how come could i like it !? '', 
  and `` how come this great band made a song so bad !? '', 
  `` first family '' ? 
  `` first lady '' ? 
  do these concepts even exist in france ? 
  was this a hit ? 
  in slovenia ? 
  abroad ? 
  is he a famous / respected singer in slovenia ? 
  it 's latin germanus , it means carnal . 
  so , frater germanus , carnal brother . 
  you took the frater , we took the germanus . 
  also , your cousin-germain is our cos\u00ed-germ\u00e0 . 
  :-) we do n't like n 's at the end of our words . 
  no , it 's closer to french : alemany , alemanya , alemanys , alemanyes . 
  otherwise , germ\u00e0nic . 
  and if you know spanish `` hermano '' or portuguese `` irmao '' it 's easier . 
  but yes , context is everything . 
  by the way , there 's no spanish dialect on the map , so it could not be `` another '' spanish dialect :-), 
  i 'm catalan , so written occitan is very very easy . 
  even some occitan songs by massilia sound system or nux vomica are quite easy , just hearing . 
  have you understood anything ? 
  yes . 
  to me that 's modern english , with an ortographical accuracy better than most of what i find in internet forums !, 
  i guess you mean 1492 , not 1942 . 
  that 's when christians conquered granada , and jews were expelled . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_granada http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alhambra_decree later , about 10 years later , muslims were expelled from castille and about 50 years later from aragon . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/morisco_revolt and it was n't until more than one century later that the descendents of muslims who had `` converted '' to christianism were expelled . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/expulsion_of_the_moriscos even then , it 's quite possible arabic speaking people remained . 
  and , in fact , what the map shows is more murcia and valencia than andalusia . 
  they did n't . 
  look for the northern shore of iberia . 
  by the way , i can understand most of the occitan text :-), 
  you know you use no flag , wo we do n't know who is `` we ( together with our allies ) '' . 
  hey , we were also in byzantium , athenes and even in bulgaria but we do n't appear there :-(, 
  what 's the gypsy part of it ? 
  it sounds to me as traditional balkan music mixed with a militar marching band . 
  well , in your case is normal , cornic people are not english , are n't they ? 
  i mean , it 's not as recognized as the welsh , but it 's quite the same , is n't it ? 
  britain ? 
  not england , wales , scotland or ireland ? 
  my passport says i 'm a citizen of spain . 
  i 'm catalan . 
  i do n't feel at all spaniard ; i feel first catalan and then european . 
  and european , first as `` from europe '' , then as `` from the european union '' . 
  as far as i know , portugal produces coffee . 
  you should look for these data . 
  these businesses think otherwise : http://www.hotfrog.es/productos/electricistas/leon/leon http://www.publiboda.com/cm/directorio/empresa/datos/stradivarius__generalisimo_franco_/moda_boutiques/1683116/espana/ http://www.tvtrip.es/leon-hotels/paris_2, 
  again . 
  one thing is translating the names of kings and popes . 
  that , at least in latin languages , is the norm . 
  but that 's all . 
  they write catalan albert as alberto , but german albert ( albert einstein street ) remains albert . 
  also , they translate family names . 
  and even mistranslate them , as in josep pla written as jos\u00e9 placita ( you said you read the link , did n't you ? 
  so you agree with this translation ???? ),
