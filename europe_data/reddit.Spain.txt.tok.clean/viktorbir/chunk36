  you talk about fascist names . 
  josep pla , during fascist times , was known as jos\u00e9 pla , not jos\u00e9 placita . 
  and another example in the link you have read is pla\u00e7a francesc maci\u00e0 . 
  he was the president of the catalan government on republic times . 
  of course he had no street during the dictature . 
  in fact , this square was called plaza de calvo sotelo at that time . 
  i do n't have a tomtom gps , so i can not try it . 
  they have been using tele-atlas for a long time , and the names were the real ones . 
  about the general\u00edsimo street in le\u00f3n , are you sure this does not exist ? 
  there are many spaniard towns with streets dedicated to franco , mola , calvo sotelo , cabanillas , sanjurjo , queipo de llano , primo de rivera ... and take a look to these links , please , neither google nor tele-atlas : * http://www.hotfrog.es/productos/electricistas/leon/leon * http://www.publiboda.com/cm/directorio/empresa/datos/stradivarius__generalisimo_franco_/moda_boutiques/1683116/espana/ * http://www.tvtrip.es/leon-hotels/paris_2 an an electricist , a boutique and a hotel in general\u00edsimo franco street , le\u00f3n . 
  carrer de sostres / calle de techos is not bilingual . 
  bilingual would be `` carrer de sostres / calle de sostres '' . 
  in other cases ( look for calle del generalisimo , els montulls , sant jaume d'enveja '' ) you only have the wrong / invented name . 
  and you really think people 's names can be bilingual ? 
  it 's been this way for a couple of days . 
  instead of restoring a previous good version , they keep saying they are working to fix it . 
  in some places they kept both names . 
  what about `` plaza francisco maci\u00e0 '' ? 
  look for `` avenida general\u00edsimo , els montulls , sant jaume d'enveja '' , and you 'll only see the wrong version . 
  they have even a street called `` calle tarragona monte '' ( does this mean anything ? 
  ) , and if you look at the street sign it is just `` carrer tarragona '' . 
   and i 'm from around here , i know my history , thanks . 
  this is not a private mail , you are not the only one who will read this , and not everyone in the world knows what generalitat or general\u00edsimo mean . 
  read the link , and check now the map . 
  what in barcelona has an irl name of carrer sostres , for example , in gmaps is calle techos . 
  have they also translated people 's names ? 
  have you read the link ? 
  ronda de dalt appears as `` ronda de arriba '' . 
  if you are a foreigner and you are looking for streets signs guiding you to `` ronda de arriba '' you 'll find none , as it does not exist . 
  they have translated people 's names , as `` francisco maci\u00e0 '' instead of `` francesc maci\u00e0 '' , and even invented family names , as `` jos\u00e9 placita '' for `` josep pla '' ( placita means `` little plaza '' , pla is a family name and means plain ) . 
  however , they have respected non catalan names , so carrer albert einstein is not calle alberto einstein , but carrer albert llanas is calle alberto llanas . 
  in berga they have even translated carrer de la generalitat as calle del general\u00edsimo . 
  generalitat is the name of the democratic catalan government . 
  general\u00edsimo was the title of the fascist spanish dictator franco , the one who abolished generalitat in 1939 . 
  can you explain point # 1 ? 
  i do n't get it at all . 
  a smaller and friendlier version of barcelona . 
  i 'm in the same case as _ thelick _ when i was a kid , the us seemed atractive . 
  now , i 'm 40 . 
  the more i know about it , not from `` current pop culture in europe '' , but from us documentaries , us news , us websites , interaction with us people on the internet , the less i 'd want to live there . 
  just in case . 
  do yo know the city you were told in school immanuel kant never left ? 
  it 's the same town . 
  east prussia . 
  and the danzig corridor ? 
  do they know much about stateless nations , as catalonia or scotland ? 
  what 's their opinion ? 
  freshman as in first year students ? 
  wow , i think most of the people i know had no opinion at all about places like georgia , armenia or azerbaijan . 
  is their opinion informed ? 
  everywhere in europe i 've been i 've felt more at home than in any other place in the world . 
  one exception may be england . 
  it 's a little weird place , between europe and the usa . 
  not on bank notes , but probably on coins . 
  center-right ? 
  actual government is center . 
  the winners are right , real right , including some far-right ( if in spain there 's no really far-right party is because far-right is comfortable with ( in ) popular party ) . 
  thanks . 
  did n't remember this change . 
  yes , but it 's quit unreal . 
  see http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/mas8t/some_interesting_map_stats_on_europe/c2zjwkr, 
  no , it 's 13 ( it used to be 12 ) , but if after having sex the one underage ( or their parents ) argue you used your athority / age / knowledge / whatever to get the child to have sex with you without really really really giving an informed consent , you can be charged with sex abuse . 
  did they change the law ? 
  seeing the title , came here to ask what did happen on the 9th of november . 
  on the other hand , the 11th of september is catalonia 's national day . 
  so euros will not be eypos anymore ? 
  it 's cool having two script banknotes . 
  just curiosity . 
  you are talking about their proportion on the total population or on the raper population ? 
  i mean , maybe they are 10 % of the population , but 15 % of rapers , but in fact they are 15 % of male population , so they are not overrepresented . 
  or maybe they are 10 % of the population , but 30 % of rapers , but in fact most rapers are men from 18 to 45 , and in this age range there is a 30 % of immigrants ... 
  they did a real statistic of inmates in catalan prisons , where , if 20 % of general population is inmigran , in prisons it is at least 30 % . 
  however , after adjusting sex , age , social background , etc , immigrants have the same % of immates as locals . 
  because we know the difference between `` then '' and `` than '' ? 
  you mean genetically , i think . 
  it means she did not undergo cirurgy . 
  also , legally , remains male . 
  she remains physically and legally male . 
  fitst in europe , and it happens in poland ? 
  wow !, 
  btw , at least in regional parlaments there have been [ previous trans mp . 
  ] ( http://www.carlaantonelli.com/notis-060542011-entregaran-acta-diputada-primera-mujer-transexual-espana.htm ) and it says she was not the first one in europe . 
  legally , it has the status of a `` protected building '' , so it can not be demolished . 
  at least not compleatly . 
  the other bullring that existed in barcelona , that closed about 35 years ago , is now a mall : * [ before ] ( http://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/pla%c3%a7a_de_toros_de_les_arenes ) * [ now ] ( http://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/les_arenes_%28centre_comercial%29 ) about other bullrings , the one in tarragona is now a [ place for cultural and sportive events ] ( http://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/tarraco_arena_pla%c3%a7a ) , the one in figueres is becoming a sport center , the one in olot a multipurpose cultural centre , and i do n't remember if there are any more . 
  anyway , the only one still active these last years was the one in barcelona . 
  in catalan newspapers the owners said they still have n't decided what would become of it . 
  some sorts of bullfighting were traditional in catalonia , as in most parts of the mediterranian . 
  modern bullfighting was invented maybe 300 years ago and yes , it 's more a spanish tradition than a catalan one . 
  thanks . 
  catalonia, 
  if i go from barcelona to perpiny\u00e0 or to andorra i 'm traveling , but if i go from moskow yo vladivostok or from nyc to la i 'm not travelling , maybe ? 
  i think catalan civil right is almost the same . 
  each part is called `` la leg\u00edtima '' , `` the legitimate '' . 
  and the wife or husband gets the `` us de fruit '' , `` usufructus '' or something similar in latin . 
  also the same in the case of married couples financial system . 
  also , to answer the op , here i think none , but superhealthy people , makes a will . 
  well , the countries `` recognized '' by the fifa part i do n't really see what relation may have with size restrictions ... 
  but well , when more flags are allowed , we can talk again . 
  no , thanks .
