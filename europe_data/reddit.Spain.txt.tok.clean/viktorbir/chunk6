  just a few do the same for catalan , and many times spanish government is against it . 
  in fact , spain does whatever it can to destroy catalan language in valencia and the balearic islands , where they have more power . 
  right now , spanish government is promoting insubmission to catalan schools , offering the parents to pay the schooling in spanish language private schools . 
  afterwards , this money will be retained form catalan government funds , of course . 
  ** history & background ** we were independent ( a confederation , sharing king , but nothing more ) till we lost the succession war in 1714 . 
  this war was in fact a war on government views . 
  the anjou ( bourbons ) wanted a potent monarchy . 
  catalans wanted a parliamentary one , were the parliament can veto the king . 
  bourbons won , ending the oldest parliament in continental europe . 
  on 1914 a semiautonomous catalan government ( the `` mancomunitat '' ) was created . 
  it was finished after a few years by a dictatorship ( primo de rivera ) . 
  on 1932 the republic was proclaimed . 
  the middle age catalan government that lasted til 1714 was reinstated . 
  this lasted 7 years , ending with another dictatorship . 
  catalan president was captured in exile in france by the german gestapo , transfered to spain , and killed by a firing squad . 
  only democratically elected president of a country or region killed during ww2 . 
  by the way , they also killed the president of football club barcelona , and many mayors ( like the one from my town ) . 
  each and every time catalan language was banned from schools and public use . 
  ** economics ** since at least the last 20 years about an 8 % of catalan gdp goes to spain and does n't come back . 
  that 's a 40 % of the taxes payed in catalonia . 
  after redistribution , you have regions that change place in the ranking . 
  this means that for some regions having an increase in gdp would mean having less money . 
  imagine , you earn 1100 $ . 
  you pay 200 $ in taxes and get back 90 $ in services . 
  in total , 990 $ . 
  i earn 900 $ , pay 90 $ in taxes and get 100 $ in services . 
  total , 1000 $ . 
  is there any incentive for me to increase my gdp ? 
  all this in a country that has much more high speed train lines than germany or france , none of which has benefits , all of them to or from madrid !, 
  of course , the asked since always `` mediterranean corridor '' , a merchant train corridor from algeciras ( in andalusia ) to the french border , thru murcia , valencia and catalonia , has not been built . 
  even if the eu has asked for it many many times . 
  barcelona 's harbour is one of the biggest in the western mediterranean , and many chinese boats stop here , instead of going to amsterdamm or roterdamm . 
  harbours belong to central government . 
  very few inversions have been done . 
  huchingson ( or something like this , sorry ) is a chinese company that made a ** big ** inversion on barcelona 's harbour with the spanish government promise they would build a train connexion from the harbour . 
  this was a few years ago . 
  still waiting . 
  and a few days ago spanish government announced 50 % of the benefits of the spanish harbours that have will be used for the ones that do n't have any . 
  when spain has made cuttings , the central government has assumed a small part of them , and transfered the big part to autonomies , which mostly take care of education and health . 
  so , small cuttings on defense , justice , inner affairs , or in the many many redundant public workers in madrid , and big ones on education and health . 
  also , the central government does lend money to the autonomies , with a much bigger interest than the one it have from the european central bank . 
  ** centralist point of view ** even they say spain is almost a federation , it 's the only country in europe , together with romania , where all airports depend from the central government . 
  even in jacobinist france airports are managed locally !, 
  this means most inversions are done in madrid or with the benefit of madrid airport in mind . 
  same with harbours , as i 've already said . 
  there 's also a big difference in economical views . 
  the `` ibex 35 '' , the 35 top companies in the spanish bourse , is almost enterely made of companies from madrid that depend on government contracts ( telecomunications , water , energy ... ) when the economics in catalonia is most industrial and base on exports . 
  ** incomprehension ** on polls , spanish people consider themselves closer to `` other europeans '' than to catalans . 
  on twitter you can see every day insults towards catalans , people complaining for having heard someone speaking catalan , people asking for catalonia to be bombed ... 
  i myself remember once , in a taxi in madrid , the taxi driver , once knew i 'm a catalan , said to me `` you do n't look catalan !, 
  '' , and this was supposed to be a compliment !, 
  imagine someone saying `` you do n't look black '' or `` you do n't look jew '' . 
  if you turn on spanish tv or radion it 's not hard at all to hear insults against us . 
  an example . 
  a few months ago the president of extremadura , the poorest spanish region , said they were paying us catalans . 
  they are the ones that get more money , we the ones who pay it . 
  he was really proud he could cut taxes while we were cutting services !, 
  thanks to our money !, 
  on the other hand , a few weeks ago , after it was suggested chaning the taxing system , the same guy said they should not change anything , because it would be a disaster if we catalans would not give the rest of spain 16 thousand million euros every year ( 8 % gdp ) ---------------- so , i do n't want to belong to a country that takes my money and , in exchange , insults me and acts against my culture , language and interests . 
  some people says we need a ( catalan ) state for us , instead of a ( spanish ) state against us . 
  spain doesn have a `` president '' and a prime minister , but king and a president of the spanish government , usually just called spanish president . 
   catalonia is the most indebted region in spain quite easy , if 2 out of every 5 $ collected in taxes in catalonia never come back ... and if the money the spanish government then lends to the catalan one has such a bith interest . 
  argh !, 
  it hurts my eyes !, 
  we are catalans , not * catalonians . 
  or are you a spainian ninjitsu ? 
  most of us want a more united europe . 
  but we want to be directly united , not thru middlemen who do n't defend our interests . 
  well , in fact , who are ** against ** our interests . 
  support spiked after a sentence of the constitutional tribunal nullifying many parts of catalan statute ( `` constitution '' ? ), 
  that had been voted and aproved by the people . 
  the day after the sentence about 0,5 m people went on the streets to demonstrate against it , most claiming for independence . 
  next year , on catalan national day , 1m people demonstrated , now already under a pro independence slogan . 
  next year , the catalan way , about 1,6 m people holding hands in a 400km human chain . 
  crisis may be a factor , but it 's not the main one . 
  mostly people is disappointed after 35 years of democracy and last 15 years or going back on our rights . 
  also , there 's been some chain reaction . 
  many people who years ago though aobut independence as just a utopia now consider it a possibility . 
  also , many immigrants from spain have realized they emigrated scaping local power elites , and they say those elites keep on influencing event if they are now in catalonia . 
  right now , according to polls , about 80 % of the population want a referendum . 
  according to the same polls , about 45 % would vote for independence , about 25 % against it , about 15 % say they have not decided and rest say they would not vote . 
  `` territorial integrity '' ... that 's why she 's president of the ddr , innit ? 
  or the reason countries like estonia , latvia , lithuania , czech republic , slovakia , slovenia or croatia are not members of the eu . 
  ** maths , spanish government way ** imagine you have 16m $ to fight child poverty . 
  how do you divide this ammount between the different regional governments ? 
  well , normal maths would be : a ) calculate how many kids at risk are at each region b ) divide the total ammount proportionally to the number of kids no !, 
  the spanish way is way better . 
  a ) you get the percent of kids at rist at each region b ) divide the total ammount proportionally to the percents !!!!, 
  yeah , hard to understand , innit ? 
  well , let 's see an example . 
  * ceuta has about 20 000 kids , and 8000 are at risk . 
  * andalusia has about 1 700 000 kids and about 600 000 are at risk . 
  our old fashioned way would give about 75 times more money to andalusia than to ceuta , innit ? 
  the spanish government way says , as 40 % is greater than 35 % , ceuta gets more money than andalusia !, 
  about 1,25 m $ ceuta , 1,1 m $ andalusia . 
  great maths !, 
  numbers on the map are the ammount per kid . 
  so you can see 153 $ per kid in ceuta , 1,9 $ per kid in andalusia . 
  sound , eh ? 
  this plan has been announced today , and will be published tomorrow .
