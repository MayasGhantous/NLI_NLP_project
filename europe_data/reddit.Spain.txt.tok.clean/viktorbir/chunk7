  let 's hope they arrange it . 
  sources , because i know it 's hard to believe : http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2014/07/15/actualidad/1405417752_911009.html http://www.lasexta.com/programas/al-rojo-vivo/noticias/fondo-pobreza-infantil-mato-indigna-autonomias_2014071500156.html http://estaticos.elperiodico.com/resources/pdf/0/6/1405373074060.pdf?_ga=1.152819387.387954786.1389107072 http://www.eldiario.es/andalucia/pobreza-infantil-gobierno-andalucia-ceuta_0_281721913.html\ufeff, 
  any idea if it is the same in other slavic languages ? 
  also , what about 10:45 ? 
  45 of the eleventh ? 
  not really about numbers , but about time . 
  there are two traditional ways to express time , relating to previous hour or to next one . 
  so , for example , hungarian ( i think ) and most german and catalan dialects will not say `` a quarter past seven '' or `` seven and a quarter '' , but `` one quarter of eight '' or `` quarter eight '' . 
  in catalan half hours are `` two quarters '' , so 7.30 is `` two quarters of eight '' . 
  in german , even in dialects where one and three quarters are expressed relating to the previous hour , half hours are always relating to next hour , so `` half eight '' . 
  for the ones who find it nonsensical , consider it is more coherent with the rest of the way we tell time . 
  we dont say we are at 2013 and a half , but on half 2014 . 
  sunday at noon is the middle of sunday , not saturday and a half or half day past saturday . 
  15th of july is half july , not half past june ... ps . 
  in what other languages do you use this other way to express time ? 
  any idea if ancient english used the german way ? 
  in less than 10 years catalonia increased the population a 25 % , from 6m to 7,5 m, 
  arent suicides a subset of homicides ? 
  excuse me , what the fuck has your link have to do with what we were talking about ? 
  you said said most of catalan gdp comes from barcelona . 
  and i 've said it 's plain evident , because most of the population comes also from barcelona . 
  and you are talking about use of catalan language ? 
  what a misleading title . 
  according the very same article : * 47 % would vote yes to an independent sate * 19,3 % would vote no to any change * 8,6 % would vote yes/no , ie , yest to a change ( statehood ) , no to independence . 
  * rest would not vote , have no opinion . 
  so , that 's about 63 % for independence . 
  because in all referendums held till now about independence them ones who do n't vote are not counted on any side ( as it 's evident ! ), 
  you are in a boat ? 
  or you meant barcelona , the city ? 
  about being spanish , well , about half the population is either immigrant from spain or have at least one parent who is , so not strange . 
  how strange , given that barcelona holds most of catalan population !, 
  a lollypop for you !, 
  athens was part of the catalan crown for almost a century . 
  catalan mercenary troops were around greece fighting against turks for a long time . 
  later , there was a traison by the greeks and the catalan revenge was terrible . 
  in some parts of the balkans and greece , up to not long ago , the `` katalani '' was some sort of boogie man . 
  and only since 10 years ago catalans are allowed into some greek monastery ( in that semiindependent religious republic of them ) because of something done 9 centuries ago . 
  now we are allowed because catalan government paid for the restauration of the monastery . 
  so , yes , we 've had a big relation with greece . 
  and yes , catalonia of course existed in times of the eastern roman empire . 
  what were you told on school ??? 
  where do you get this information from ? 
  or you mean once catalonia becomes independent and a full member of the eu ? 
  this has been asked and the answer is that it 's the spain government who has to demand it . 
  and it is not even official in asturies , innit ? 
  i 'm catalan . 
  the only official language in the whole spain is spanish . 
  in catalonia it 's occitan , catalan and spanish . 
  so , somehow , we do n't have an official language of our own , as the only `` really '' official language is spanish . 
  for example , malteses is official in the eu as malta has asked so . 
  catalan is not , as spain does n't want to . 
  and yes , these things piss me ( us ) off . 
  if you are saying that you language is spoken in another country , well , catalan is the only official language in andorra . 
  and of course i fell good about it . 
  why should n't i ? 
  we had one in barcelona during the olympic games . 
  millions of people come to catalonia every year , but very few reach the [ delta de l'ebre , ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ebro_delta ) the delta of the ebre river . 
  great nature and great gastronomy . 
  any context / source for that picture ? 
  have they all moved to europe , already ? 
  yeah , i neither spelt it in proper english nor in uzbek , ozbekiston . 
  thanks . 
  i guess this explains his like of knowing about tatarstan . 
  it existed before , crimean tatars were n't deported there , and they are as related as they are to kazakhs . 
  by the way , what is `` velikobritaniya '' ? 
  not at all . 
  nowadays tatarstan was born as all other soviet republics , in the 20 's . 
  crimean tatars were deported after ww2 ( 1944 , in fact ) , mostly to ozbekistan . 
  also , although they share the tatar name , tatars in tatarstan and crimean tatars are from two different turkic peoples branches . 
  have you seen the ''  '' ??? 
  maybe because i also speak catalan and french , but i could understand people talking to me in portuguese , while i spoke to them in broken portuguese , a mix of catalan - spanish - french in my fake portuguese accent . 
  i have never learnt portuguese , but i did n't have to use english in portugal at all . 
  a mix of catalan - spanish - french with a fake portuguese accent worked perfectly with everyone . 
  no problem at all . 
  not in this case , sorry . 
   25 years of trying , trying , trying , to no avail of course . 
  as everyone knows centuries of discrimination are solved in less than 25 years ... 
  i 'm not really sure about this . 
  my spanish is `` as if native speaker '' , but spanish is definetively not my mother tongue . 
  i guess if one parent speaks one language and the other one speaks the other , you might end up with both languages as your mother tongue . 
  but i do n't think this is the case for `` almost everyone '' under 75 . 
  the kid already speaks spanish . 
  just the environment . 
  and english is not the language of any of them . 
  in fact , the mother agrees somehow with you and complains the father does n't speak gonja to her . 
  that 's the people living on those areas , not the ones speaking it as first language . 
  the ones in arag\u00f3n , are the top , 90 % of the ones living on catalan speaking areas have catalan as their mother tongue . 
  in catalonia , it 's just about 50 % from the total 13.2 m people , i thing about 6m have catalan as mother language . 
  and many more as first or main language . 
  i have many friends whose parents ' tongue is spanish and who have spanish as mother language , but have made catalan their main language , the one they speak usually to other people , including their own kids . 
  for example , a friend whose parents are spanish immigrants , married to a ghanian to which she speaks spanish / english . 
  and both speak to their kid in catalan . 
  catalonia has 7.5 m people . 
  catalan speaking areas about 12-13m . 
  so , no . 
  edit : * valencia has 5.1 m inhabitants , more than 90 % of them on the catalan speaking areas . 
  so , about 4.5 m people . 
  * balearic islands have 1.1 m inhabitants . 
  * and 50 000 people live on the catalan area of arag\u00f3n . 
  so , total , 13.2 m people , of which 7.5 m in catalonia .
