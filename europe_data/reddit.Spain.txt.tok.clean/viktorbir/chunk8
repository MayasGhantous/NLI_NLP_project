  if this was your thought process , i do n't get your reference to french immigrants and comparing them to other groups . 
  what you should compare is `` total people/immigrants whose mother tongue is not english '' vs `` total people/natives who were taught french as second language on school and are suppose to be able to speak it '' . 
  so , yeah , it 's normal french is first second language in the uk . 
  i guess you mean outside catalan speaking areas . 
  in catalan speaking areas there are about 12-13m people , of which about 8m have catalan as mother tongue and the remaining 4-5m have it as a second language . 
  so , a the second language of about 10 % of total spanish population looks enough to make it third most spoden second language . 
  and people like me , my family and most of my friends ... ;-), 
  `` languages people speak who are not their mother tongue '' . 
  are you really saying that everyone living in cyprus has greek as their mother tongue ??? 
  the english on the map is the second language of the people who have any other language as their first , not just irish language . 
  so , a polish living in ireland whose second language is english would be there . 
   but are n't the mother tongue of the country improve your english reading skills !, 
  :-) it does n't say so . 
  it talks about their mother tongue , that of the people living there . 
  french immigrants have mostly english as main second language , and most , if not all , will have french as first language . 
  any idea to explain the difference between lithuania and estonia and latvia ? 
  and the government knows where your permanent address is because you have registered !, 
  if you did n't , i do n't think you 'd be able to vote . 
  so , that 's it . 
  with your registration in the town comes your vote , as many other things . 
  because your parents registered you , or when you changed residence , you registered on the town council . 
  but without this registering , you would not be able to vote , i 'm quite sure . 
  do you have a national id card , maybe ? 
  with your address , or that asked for your address ? 
  you have to register for voting and many other things , all together . 
  but , to vote , you have to be registered . 
  no register , no vote . 
  my point is , how did you get to that list without , according to you , having been registered previously ? 
  i love your wording . 
  no need to ** register , ** but you get the card mailed to your ** registered ** address . 
  well , op and many others answering here do n't seem to think they have ever registered in any way . 
  and you were on that list just by magic , innit ? 
  and if you change your residence , also by magic , you 'll disappear form your old town list and appear on your new town one , of course . 
  so , if you never registered , how come the polling card reaches you ? 
  magic ? 
  and if you go live elsewhere , and register nowhere , do you really think you 'll keep on getting your polling card ? 
  to all the ones saying no registration is needed , how do you know where to go to vote ? 
  can you go to any polling station in the country ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  here you must be registered on the town you live , not just to vote , but to access other benefits . 
  and if you go to live to some other town , unless you register there , you 'll be expected to vote on your old town . 
  excuse me ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  ( in this case , it 's catalonia ) well , lots of reasons . 
  historical , cultural , linguistical , economical , political ... mostly , we think we would be better without spain . 
  we do n't feel well treated ( in any of the previous topics ) . 
  no reason ? 
  not paying taxes to cross catalan borders ? 
  having direct road and rail access to the eu ? 
  not losing the eu a net contributor who might give them money ? 
  if spain does not acknowledge catalan independence , then catalonia would be by definition part of the eu . 
  spain can not veto the admission of something that , according to them , would be still part of spain . 
  argh !, 
  not * catalonian * but ** catalan ** or do they say * englandian , * * francian , * * germanian ... ? 
  well , that ural river is the border between europe and the rest of asia is widely accepted . 
  look on any map . 
  the part west of ural river . 
  in the linked map , you can see it just over the caspian see . 
  it 's the western part of west kazakhstan and atyrau provinces . 
  they forgot to paint the european part of kazakhstan . 
  again , this is a mean . 
  not just strict spain . 
  you live in catalonia , i guess . 
  do you think it is such a catholic place ? 
  it 's on the poll , under spain label . 
  you know this poll does not only include strict spain , do n't you ? 
  neapolitan is indeed a different language than italian , according to linguists . 
  are you sure you are talking about a dialect , or about another language ? 
  well , i think maybe i 've met a couple of people my age ( 40s ) or younger who does n't have at least a non catalan grandparent . 
  and many of the people who have three or four non catalan grandparents are now proindependence . 
  there 's a book called `` the catalan system of reproduction '' or something similar , by a demographer , explaining that for the last centuries almost all population growth has been through assimilated immigration . 
  occitan people on 18th century , spaniards on 20th , south americans and africans on 21st ... just without the immigration from 20th century , it 's calculated we would not be 7,5 m people , but something like just 2,5 m or 3m . 
  well , this indicates problems assimilating people , innit ? 
  no idea about druids in wales or scotland . 
  i 've been to england a few times . 
  but i was talking about the general vision . 
  thanks . 
  as a culture , music , history ... respected . 
  as individuals : pale white skinned people who get extremely red with the first sun rays , drunkers , shouters , annoying and pissing everywhere . 
  if claiming heritage is saying `` i 'm swedish '' , because some of your ancestors was , even if you have never been there , and you do n't speak the language , i feel like they are idiots . 
  if they say `` my granma was swedish '' , that 's ok . 
  no view at all . 
  slavs , that 's all . 
  now , with the recent events , people may have some special simpaty . 
  but . 
  there are ( almost ) no ukrainian immigrants , people know nothing about the country , culture , whatever . 
  edit . 
  after reading the other answers , maybe there 's the idea of beautiful women , but mostly prostitutes ( i think the only ukrainian to appear on a catalan tv series was a prostitute ) . 
  italian , due to the musicality . 
  occitan , because it sounds like some weird ancient catalan . 
  what 's '' / int / '' ? 
  hey , we got into the 0,1 % list !, 
  right now , you are losing lots of discussions on catalan independence :-), 
  so , what 's your suggestion when you want to get independent from another country when this other country does n't want to allow you ? 
  if democracy , a vote , a referendum , is not an option , what 's the idea ? 
  are you suggesting we should start a war ? 
  because borders drawn thru blood seem to be recognised . 
  why should we change the spanish constitution if we do n't want to be spaniards . 
  it 's their constitutions , it 's them who must decide if they want to change it . 
  polls say so , but we want to have a vote , a democratic vote .
