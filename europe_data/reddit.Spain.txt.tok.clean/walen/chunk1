but surely he 's spent plenty of time thinking about how spanish democratic republics and spanish governments * have * worked before . 
  the idea of a spanish politician giving up his/her political beliefs when becoming president is laughable . 
  i 'm a referendum supporter too , but the comment you pointed out is not dumb at all . 
  no idea , but the first thing that came to mind were windmills . 
  windmills are common in netherlands , and seen from afar they could look like a big white x , could that be ? 
  i agree it sounds more professional . 
  however , besides `` lo siento '' being the exact translation of `` i 'm sorry '' ... 
  the way op wrote it , makes me think s/he intends to learn these simple sentences so s/he can * speak * to foreign visitors in their language , and explain to them how and when ( not ) to enter the church . 
  if that 's the case , i mean if i 'm trying to tell some tourists that there 's a mass going on and they ca n't enter the church right now , i 'd rather use `` lo siento '' , as it feels more personal and understanding ( and it 's easier for op to learn ) . 
  enhanced version ( as per fissileport1 comment ) : * para visitar el templo , hay que pasar por el museo . 
  edit - note : nobody said the church is a `` catedral '' . 
  it might as well be a normal church . 
  `` templo '' on the other hand can be used for any religious building . 
   most popular : mahou     almost only in madrid . 
  it would rather be estrella damm in catalonia , and cruzcampo in the south . 
  murcia and its surroundings : estrella levante galicia and its surroundings : estrella galicia catalonia and its surroundings : estrella damm madrid and its surroundings : mahou andalusia : cruzcampo of course , being spain , each region has its own brand of beer and they all think theirs is better than the others ' ... 
  but yeah , besides that , everybody agrees that alhambra is one of the best ( spanish ) beers . 
  kind of what i thought , but not exactly . 
  what i see in this map is : regions with more women = regions where men had to leave because of the lack of job opportunities . 
  maybe not true in the more socially-advanced scandinavian regions , but closer to reality in the more traditional southern regions like spain , italy , greece , etc. 
  ( or so i think ) . 
  note that `` rural region '' does * not * equal `` lack of jobs '' . 
  there may be some rural regions where strong workforce is needed throughout the year , where as another rural regions could be more seasonal and not enough to earn a living . 
  then again , that does n't explain france . 
  i like the color of france . 
  did n't know we had that many * more * cops in 2010 , compared to 2005 . 
  strange if you take into account that the govt . 
  was already making budget cuts . 
  which is still 0.00 % ( after rounding ) of all incarcerated people . 
  something 's wrong with this country . 
   70 % of imprisoned people are there due to drug related crimes . 
  and 0 % are there for being a corrupt politician / banker . 
  yay spain !, 
   less territorial water than it is entitled to . 
  gibraltar is not entitled to any territorial waters at all , that 's the point . 
  as are n't switzerland , paraguay , andorra , luxembourg or austria : they all are sovereign territories surrounded by foreign nations , with no territorial waters , but respect their boundaries and treaties with their neighbors and everything is fine . 
  gibraltar , on the contrary , does n't . 
   expansion through spanish land and waters . 
  [ original treaty ] ( http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/peace_and_friendship_treaty_of_utrecht_between_spain_and_great_britain#article_x ) only included :  * the full and entire propriety of the town and castle of gibraltar , together with the port , fortifications , and forts thereunto belonging . 
  * it did * not * include the surrounding waters ( though spain have always understood as common sense that the harbor waters are indeed included ) , but gibraltar and the uk insist on expanding this limit , now claiming as gibraltar 's territorial waters as much as [ 3 miles into the mediterranean sea ] ( http://imgur.com/tb4le03 ) . 
  and this is what drives spanish authorities nuts and make spanish fishermen rage , every time they enter those waters while doing their jobs and see themselves suddenly surrounded by britsh patrol ships forcing them to leave `` or else '' . 
  this makes spain appear weak , incapable of defending their own borders , which may lead some other countries ( morocco ) to push into spanish overseas territories as well ; and because the uk is a european and nato ally of spain , they should n't be acting like that . 
  not that i care about gibraltar being british , spanish or moroccan ( i find the spanish government 's position about ceuta and melilla a little bit hypocritical too ) , but i think honor plays an important role in international relations , and the uk 's * de facto * policy about gibraltar does not honor the very same agreement they base their sovereignity in . 
  ahem ... 
  i think you 're mistaking `` fish problems '' for `` fish * ing * problems '' . 
  current crisis is not about gibraltar destroying the oceans or anything like that . 
  current crisis is about gibraltar dropping big concrete blocks * in spanish territorial waters * to mess with spanish fishermen 's nets , so that they ca n't fish there anymore . 
  many fishermen in the area ca n't afford fishing in any other place ( old boats , too far ) and by purposely blocking those fishing spots , gibraltar is condemning them and their families , forcing them to live on welfare . 
  and nobody wants that . 
  not a fan of spanish fishermen myself ( i live near [ mar menor ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mar_menor ) , there used to be turtles and tuna in there only 60 years ago , now they 're all gone ) , but it seemed like you got it backwards so i thought i might help . 
  i think you mistyped an 8 in germany 's 81.9 % , 
  spain reaching 90 % :(, 
  192 if you count the 7-month pregnant woman as two people . 
  her son 's name would 've been samuel . 
  sttl . 
  some more : *** guiri *** for any blond , pale-skinned , usually sun-burned tourist ( most of them are english , american , german , swedish or french ) . 
  derives probably from the spanish word * guirigay * which means `` uncomprehensible words or language ; confusion , yelling of several people talking at once without order '' - ironic that * we * of all europeans call you that , is n't it ? 
  sounds like `` gee-ry '' . 
  *** franchute *** for french . 
  yeah , we have a lot of names for french people . 
  it 's just a rude derivation of french , i think . 
  plural sounds more or less like an american would pronounce `` french-oot-ass '' . 
  *** panchito *** for latin american people ( including mexico etc. ) . 
  diminutive of * pancho * ( which is itself a diminutive of the spanish name francisco ) , a very popular name in mexico because of [ pancho villa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pancho_villa ) . 
  sounds like `` punch-it-oh '' . 
  *** payoponi *** - ok , this one is really offensive . 
  used to despectively refer to people from peru , colombia , ecuador and the like because of their short height . 
  comes from * payo * ( romani/gipsy slang for a non-gipsy guy ) and * poni * ( lit . 
  `` pony '' , the small-sized horse ) . 
  sounds like `` pa-yo-pony '' , i guess . 
  *** yanqui *** for americans . 
  it 's the spanish version of `` yankee '' and sounds exactly the same . 
  *** moro *** for moroccans and , by extension , any north african . 
  most people think it 's offensive , although we 've been using it since year 800 a.d. at least ( see [ la reconquista ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reconquista ) ) so ... it 's kind of hard not to use it . 
  sounds like ( actually , it * is * ) the `` moro '' part in morocco . 
  ## spain : 1 . 
  woman + woman * strangers * usually ** two cheek-air kisses ** ( and by `` cheek-air '' i mean there 's cheek contact , so not really `` air kiss '' like some snobs do ) . 
  * not so usually , ** two cheek kisses ** ( you somehow knew this woman beforehand ) . 
  * relatives * elders ( grandma , mom ) , kids , and some close relatives ( cousins , aunt ) may get ** one single , warm , direct cheek kiss ** . 
  * rest of adult relatives will usually get ** two cheek kisses ** . 
  * ** optional hug ** if it 's been a while since you last met . 
  * friends * ** two cheek or cheek-air kisses ** the first time you meet each other ( same day ) * hugs , high fives , hip bumping , whatever . 
  you 're friends . 
  * business partners * in a formal meeting , it depends on the type of relationship and character of the partners : * if the one that has the money ( either she 's your boss or she 's your client ) keeps the distance , then it 's a ** handshake ** . 
  * if she initiates the kissing , then ** two air or cheek-air kisses ** . 
  this is more normal between women . 
  * if you 're equal partners , ** two air or cheek-air kisses ** are ok . * in your daily job , a simple `` good morning '' when you arrive is enough . 
  woman + man * strangers * same rules as woman + woman . 
  * if you * really * are strangers and do n't feel like kissing , a ** handshake ** may be ok . * relatives * same rules as woman + woman , but including male relatives ( grandpa , dad , godfather , uncle ) . 
  * friends * same rules as woman + woman . 
  * business partners * in a formal meeting , the rules are somewhat similar to woman + woman , but if the woman initiates the ** cheek kissing ** , the man will usually follow since refusing could be seen as too rude . 
  anyways , most women will just go for a ** handshake ** as it is more professional . 
  * in your daily job , a simple `` good morning '' when you arrive is enough . 
  man + man * strangers * always ** handshake ** . 
  * relatives * elders ( grandpa , dad , godfather ) and kids may get ** one single , warm , direct cheek kiss ** . 
  on special days ( christmas , etc. ), 
  brothers may get one too . 
  * some very close relatives ( uncle , cousin ) may get ** two cheek kisses ** . 
  * rest of adult relatives will usually get a ** hug ** or a ** handshake ** . 
  * friends * ** handshaking ** the first time you meet each other ( same day ) .
