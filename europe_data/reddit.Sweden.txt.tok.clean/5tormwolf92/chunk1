state controlled religions is always an better alternative . 
  example russias version during the 1800s and turkeys version during the early republican era . 
  very easy america , just turn to a isolated country and there is your world peace . 
  maybe but scotland is welcome to join anytime . 
  you think that 's bad you should have seen the voteman commercials during the european parliament elections .

  alot of turks in sweden got really mad . 
  [ according to the designer of the f16 and a10 the f35 is a turkey ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqb4w8c0rzi ), 
  yeah but he still hasnt been broken a state where he regrets all his actions . 
  why didnt norway just give him a ironic punishment , like sending him to guantanamo or a n.korean labour camp . 
  but they still poked the ottomans . 
   the reality is that for five centuries much of the balkans found itself under the ottoman yoke , under an occupation that the locals resented at all levels , and for good reason . 
  under the millet system , the collective rights of christians as a community were severely constrained compared to their muslim counterparts . 
  in the early days of this occupation , they were subjected to the worst injustices imaginable , including the forced enslavement of their children under the dev\u015firme system . 
  moreover , economically speaking the status of christians came close to what can rightfully be called servitude . 
  christians were subjected to a highly discriminatory tax , they were shut out many professions , and often were in practice precluded from owning any sizeable amount of land . 
  in effect , a large fraction of christians in the ottoman empire were forced to work the land as laborers , while the profit of their work went to landholders who were almost invariably immigrants from other parts of the ottoman empire or local muslim converts . 
  at the same time we had the spansih inquisition where non-christians had to flee al andalus . 
  or are you trying to tell that the ortodox christians wanted to be ruled by the holy-roman/habsburgs dynasty which was backed by the papal state , the same teocratic state who backed the crusade that put the final nail on the byzantian state . 
  wow such lust for revenge !, 
  they saw the russians as a treat . 
  this happens all the time , old allies becomes a enemy all of a sudden . 
  lets think for a moment . 
  we live in a time right now where people regret helping revolts , revolution and proxy wars . 
  the reason why the ottoman empire started to break apart after there golden age is because other countrys started to interven . 
  gb saw the big russian bear as a treat so they tried to help the turks as much as they can . 
  nah it was after 1699 . 
  it was then the ottomans started to lose clay . 
   dae swedistan dude dont mention that god awful subreddit war here . 
  its over . 
   kebab pizza - kebab , and a variety of other toppings , often at least red onions and jalapenos japp thats also the number 1 after hangover food in sweden . 
  was it because of all that bunga bunga shenanigans ? 
  erdogan should have know not to feed the trolls . 
  but this is gold !, 
  welcome to the club !, 
  the reason we see terror attacks since 1980 is because of colonialism and imperialism on the behalf of the western world . 
  what the west should do is ... do n't interfere in other regions politics . 
  let them nationalize oil and natural resources . 
  let them be more independent . 
  let them be superpowers . 
  let them be economic behemoths . 
  first is that turkish airlines is flawless but the only problem is that turkish airlines cant handle snow . 
  sas was great until they lost there monopoly in scandinavia to shitty company 's like ryanair and norweigan who do shady business , majority of there employees are from cheap labor country 's . 
  i work at arlanda airport and i have meet there ceo . 
  the guy is cheap , he complained how expensive everything was and he is rich . 
  the thing is that these cheap airline companys give people who should n't fly the possibility to fly . 
  they dont know how to act in an airport . 
  also i fly standby most of the time . 
  get out of europe australia !, 
  holy shit , this article gave me cancer !, 
  also `` kick turkey out of nato ! '' . 
  for fuck sake how ignorant is the internet !, 
  can confirm that erasmus students drink and party only , actually they all had the same mentality when i was abroad in istanbul 2015 . 
  they where all `` boring '' so i hanged more with american/canadian students . 
  now they know fun !, 
  wait what ? 
  yeah , everything pre-1945 is a big nono in germany . 
  because of the scary thought of nationalism germany cant even celebrate this event but at least this makes r/france salty as f. also [ ** this ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vkgnfwcrcc&amp;list=llsfbmsewmjatr-ii-mr9fdg&amp;index=1 ) warning loud . 
  5 more years and germany should release a euro coin with bismarck on it !, 
  turkey has an agreement with iraq that saddam `` supported '' . 
  he gave turkey the thumbs up and the agreement continued after the second guf war . 
  the reason serbia is like this is because russia inserted nationalism . 
  but this is also from a country who sees the man who started ww1 as a hero . 
  it 's fucked up , that coat of arms is fucked up and that logo is bad taste . 
  this is ok but the washington redskins logo is bad ... . stay classy europe . 
  i dont know , the legalized pot farming got me of guard . 
  there are a shit ton of them in sweden . 
  if i look at my country 's development of its own tank , sweden bought german tanks and just started from there . 
  also the britt 's would n't allow it / s. 
  technology transfers , its a start . 
  just like the v2 helped the americans in the space race . 
  maybe germany wants to buy some . 
  turkey tried to sell to west germany the ww1 dreadnought * yavuz sultan selim * / * sms goeben * . 
  they denied it and the ship was scraped unfortunately . 
  it a shame , these planes would have kickstarted turkey own aviation industry . 
  its all menderes fault . 
  turkey lost all domestic industry 's during his time . 
  locomotive , agriculture , animal farming , aero-planes , machinery . 
  oh its very simple . 
  you just have sex with a rapper . 
  the robbary is fake just like ger ass , nose and fame . 
  get in the fucking robot melih !, 
  screw u duterte . 
  ok its revolutionary but what stops the governments of europe from creating bs tax on electric cars . 
  if the electric car become really popular ( see tesla ) then the environmental taxes become obsolete . 
  the ottoman empire was already on the brink of destruction when ww1 started . 
  even with neutrality it would n't hold up . 
  im complaining about the mindset the west had and still has , the so called white mans burden . 
  destabilize a country for there own gains . 
   at that point we already lost balkans and greece this was the case ever since 1699 to ww1 but in a direct way . 
  and yet to this day the west still does n't understand that they ** should n't ** stick there nose in other nations business kanka . 
  edit : ow people are really salty today . 
  it weird when nationalism that was inserted by a third party destroyed a ** huge ** empire was later saved by the same patriotism . 
  does this also mean course literature ? 
  during the euro cup this year it was delightful to hang with croatian football fans before and after turkey-croatia game so do n't be so sad dude . 
  i hope erdogan finally learned on how important secularism is . 
   http://www.turkishculture.org/lifestyles/turkish-culture-portal/the-women/honor-killings-426.htm?type=1 the site is `` about '' turkishculture but it does n't mention that eastern anatolia is kurdish dominated , its basically farce . 
  now my jimmies are rustled . 
  will this lead to a mankini ban ? 
  well you got ta do what you got ta do .
