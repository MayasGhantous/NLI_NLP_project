  if the same thing happens in germany with people wearing stalhelms and pickelhelms , everyone would lose there minds . 
  hmm looks like i will have to open my welfare wallet now that the deal is off . 
  ok everyone , prepare for the horde . 
  i know what im doing if there is a brexit . 
  go shopping in london , the sterling will loose value # # # # #, 
  no new news here , turkish tv shows have been doing this for years . 
  no free promotion . 
  but people will still immigrate to the west when the oil runs out or becomes irrelevant . 
  who wants to live in a desert and who likes sand ? 
  it 's ruff and it gets everywhere, 
  good job on finding the source . 
  dude just look at the related channels on yt . 
  no but it raises some questions . 
  maybe this is a setup . 
  why would a channel namned after a right-wing pro-sd newspaper interview a moslum girl who only complains about her new home country ? 
  and yes i dislike backwards thinking immigrants who live in sweden . 
  note that the channel is a ultra-rightwing one . 
  the channel also follows other racist channels . 
  austria is welcome to try again next year . 
  staph pls . 
  if you win the cup against france in the final , will you germans celebrate like its 1871 ? 
  party in versailles ? 
  oh the horror . 
  i dont want to hear putin sing and bleed out of my ears . 
  [ mmm ] ( https://youtu.be/ecc0nbg9m-8 ) . 
  or why is the american using a luger or why the turk is using a fez ? 
  first \u0130celand needs to lose some zeros on their crown 's . 
  i see bike rage is also common in the netherlands , just like in uppsala . 
  this fucking sucks . 
  political islam was used to fight of communist ideals in turkey which was a common tactic during the cold war . 
   still though , blindly following ataturk 's ideas is n't right either . 
  his ideas must also be adapted to the modern times . 
  the liberals are regretting they supported religious party 's and organized islam . 
  they did n't understand the kemalist laws backing in 2000 . 
  but the liberals have always been the odd one , many are former communist members who had a cold war ( us/soviet proxy war ) on the streets with the nationalist who favoured the old system . 
  * looks at the british sterling charts * ... what is this sorcery !, 
  looks like germany is safe from the middle income trap . 
  so voteman was finnish . 
  has anyone never heard of other nations supporting uprisings during world wars ? 
  it 's called playing dirty . 
  \u0130t 's all talk before the election just like breaking the refugee deal and closing down \u0130ncirlik base . 
  europe is very naive and clueless when it comes to the terrorist organisation pkk and ermenian movement . 
  europe needs to stop with this `` neo-white man 's burden '' shit in the middle east . 
  no i meant between 1949-60 . 
  the time before 1980 coup was a street war game between the s.u using leftist and the u.s using rightist . 
  what huge slap to the face for erdo\u011fan hahaha . 
  it feels like we are still stuck in the cold war . 
  it takes more effort then just drawing a straight line on a map . 
  i actually meant the first official opposition , the dp that did more harm then good . 
  nato was a excellent idea but the marshall plan ruined all domestic production . 
  after the first coup the cold war game started . 
  https://mobile.nytimes.com/2008/07/31/world/europe/31turkey.html?fta=y.&amp;referer=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/ there was a pressure from the eu . 
  also adolf hitler shit . 
   the mistake , i think , was to not invest enough into education and development in the countryside . 
  democracy ca n't bring about the conditions it requires on its own because without those conditions already met you get a kind of clan-based oligarchy which is n't interested in deepening democracy . 
  an educated populace with sufficiently large middle class would 've been a safeguard , there ... in turkey , that class is mostly limited to the cities . 
  see the us bringing democracy to iraq and afghanistan , they are all halfass attempts . 
  democrasy there did n't bring any stability , there was no goodwill in those chases . 
  yes its true that he fired a lot of teachers connected to gulen which is ok but he also took his chance to fire secular teachers to which i 'm against . 
  but generally there is n't any majority muslim country with a secular constitution and huge resources left , the turkish republic is hanging on a thin line . 
  they where literally adding fuel to the fire . 
  2008 the supreme court was planing to ban the akp and erdogan but because the eu and us was against the decision they left them alone . 
  then we had the bs ergenekon trials , fake pkk peace and g\u00dclen movement infiltrating every institute . 
  through education . 
  when the population is educated they will choose the right party . 
  using religion in politics is a bad idea and menderes did it . 
  now erdo\u011fan started to use ottoman history as a tool to farm votes . 
  a secular majority muslim country with a lot of resources and educated people is dangerous for the west during the cold war and still does . 
  turkey made bad decisions post ww2 , the biggest was the first free elections because the opposition still has n't matured yet . 
  [ `` the spat between turkey and the netherlands is all about winning votes '' ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/worldviews/wp/2017/03/13/the-spat-between-turkey-and-the-netherlands-is-all-about-winning-votes/ ), 
  actually ataturk wanted more partys but every time a party was established the losers of ww1 and religious zealots flooded the new party . 
  there has never been a mature opposition to rival the secular/nationalist party 's . 
  wait did n't the eu and us support erdogan since 2002 ? 
  this happens when you support `` moderate islamist partys '' . 
  you know what !, 
  the west really wants the yes side to win . 
  true but big e will use this as propaganda . 
  austria is literally adding more fuel in to the fire which will destroy turkeys secularism . 
  but does italians miss the lira ? 
  sek is only useful for the big companies and the state while it sucks travelling . 
  because swedish crowns is a good export currency . 
  dew it . 
  im sick and tired of americans who does n't know what scehngen and eu border is . 
  [ does he want the fika to be a eu regulated cinnemonbun and also heresy !, 
  [ we got it covered . 
  i dont know man i heard a story of a good officer who was declared not reliable after his afghanistan service . 
  he committed suicide for not being allowed to work in the army . 
  as a indirect , afraid of conflict , irresponsible svennebanan i surrender but kebabpizza rules . 
  to all who likes pineapple on a pizza : ** get out of europe !, 
  a place where bond villains have their main base . 
  must comit sudoku .

  turkey is by a hair closer to the eu then morocco because more resources and secularism .
