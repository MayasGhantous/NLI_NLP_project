i assume you 're talking about sd now and not swedenyes ? 
  if so i would like to clarify that i do not think that everyone who votes for sd shall be branded a racist . 
  i think the largest cause for sd 's sudden growth is that the other right-wing parties have been veering off to the left and sd appeared to fill that void thus attracting the mainstream audience . 
  i wo n't comment on israel 's situation but building a wall sounds like an awfully hasty move that really would n't solve anything . 
  all it does is , as you say yourself , shove the problem somewhere else . 
  if everyone where to build walls , where would the refugees go ? 
  nowhere , would you prefer that ? 
  also , i find it interesting that you label me a leftist based on one post taking a more nuanced look at a common misconception without arguing for or against either side . 
  the wording of the first paragraph makes it sound like `` do you want rapists to immigrate to your country ? 
  good . '', 
  thus equalizing immigrants and rapists . 
   immigrants/refugees commit crimes disproportionately is what i said , and yes it is an undeniable , empirical fact . 
  i did not dispute that . 
   you are wrong because your original statement was worded as one would word an accusation , do n't you dare try to back away from that . 
  it was a question , a fair one in my eyes . 
  the way you worded your original post it sounded like `` do you want raping immigrants to come to your country ? '', 
  which is a rather aggressive standpoint so i asked you to clarify . 
   indeed . 
  you responded to me with an accusation which i do happen to consider a personal attack , and then get passive aggressive with me and back away acting as if i 'm the one attacking you . 
  cute . 
  again , it was not meant to be an accusation but because of the rather unorthodox statement i asked you to clarify . 
  it was in no way mean as a personal attack . 
  however , due to your followup : `` nice reading comprehension , but i 'm used to the old strawman when dealing with pro-immigration types . 
  i specifically said disproportionately , would you like a dictionary ? '', 
  i did get more defensive since it was nothing but a personal attack that in no way contributed to discussion . 
  also , i feel compelled to point out that you again resort to the very same thing you 're accusing me for , passive agressiveness , personal attacks , whatever you want to call it . 
  though i 'm not denying that i have n't either but i do not consider myself to be the instigator . 
   no , that 's a logical fallacy used to falsely bolster ones argument . 
  i think one who has a sound argument would stand on his argument and his argument alone , not taking the easy road as many do and saying look guys , he posted in european !, 
  do n't listen to anything he says !, 
  yet in the same breath you mention that i 'm the one personally attacking you yet you ... hey , slow it down a bit here . 
  i did not `` dig through '' your post history to find something incriminating , nor am i judging you for posting in european . 
  i do , however , note the general tone of your posts and see how you handle arguments to see if our discussion is the norm or the exception . 
  not to use it against you , but more out of curiousity . 
  i admit that it might not be fair to mention it but i was simply defending myself . 
  also , i think you are mistaken . 
  all i disagree with is the fact that you in your original post worded it in a way as to equalize immigrants with rapists . 
  my question , `` besides , would n't that be a problem with integration , not immigration itself ? '', 
  has been completely ignored and seemingly drowned in personal attacks . 
   i 'm used to the old strawman when dealing with pro-immigration types . 
  you think that 's an empirical fact ? ', 
   everything on the internet is written in plane text , if you have n't noticed . 
  i ca n't read your mind nor you can mine and there are no visual cues for me to know an accusation from a genuine question but such is the way of an internet forum . 
  you can read inbetween the lines on reddit just like in books , so i did . 
  please correct me if i 'm wrong . 
   i 'm also glad you took the effort of digging through my post history hoping , praying , to find something to boost your non-existent points . 
  ironically as you stated about me , this is perfectly in line with a person who does n't seek a real , rational discussion but seeks instead to attack the character of someone who simply disagrees with your position . 
  funny how the real hypocrites speak loudest . 
  ironic indeed , since you were the first one to respond with personal attacks * and * avoiding the question . 
  so much for rational discussion , huh ? 
  checking a person 's post history is a perfectly valid way to find out who you 're dealing with , do n't you think ? 
  english is n't my native language , nice attitude you 've got there . 
  you even top it off with some generalizations , sweet . 
  not to mention that you ignored my question and downvoted . 
  edit : and if you want to start petty arguments : i said `` imply '' , and since you already know everything you should know that implications typically are n't written in plain text . 
  edit # 2 : judging by your post history you do n't seem to be too keen of discussion with people who question your views . 
  that 's surely in line with your behavior here . 
  are you really implying that all immigrants are rapists ? 
  besides , would n't that be a problem with integration , not immigration itself ? 
   the swedish rape stats is nothing more than a red herring that says absolutely nothing regarding the problem . 
  i am not arguing for or against immigration/integration . 
  i was simply using that `` fact '' as an example of how one can twist statistics to fit one 's own view . 
   in fact , the only argument that is made is that not all crimes may be `` real '' rapes . 
  some may be , some may be sexual harassment . 
  here are the arguments from the quoted wiki paragraph alone : * police procedures and legal definitions vary widely across countries , which makes it difficult to compare rape statistics . 
  * the swedish police also record each instance of sexual violence in every case separately . 
  * the swedish police have improved the handling of rape cases , in an effort to increase the number of crimes reported . 
  i 'll say again that i am not arguing for or against immigration or integration , but what you say is not the `` only '' argument at all . 
  i wo n't comment on the ethnicity of the criminals since i was n't , for the third time , arguing for or against immigration/integration . 
  i 'm only discussing how stats can be used to paint different images of reality . 
   so , are swedes reporting real crimes or are they just making stuff as they go along to pin them on innocent immigrants ? 
  again , the ethnicity of criminals are irrelevant when discussing the application of statistics . 
  you 're trying to turn my post about statistics into a post about immigration/integration , that 's not what i came here to discuss . 
   furthermore , you talk about deceiving people with statistics , but here you are trying to pull the wool over everyone 's eyes by distorting a single piece of statistics while trying desperately to ignore all facts and even all crimes being committed by immigrants . 
  how ? 
  by trying to argue that some rapes are n't really rapes , only `` swedish-rapes '' , which are n't really rapes . 
  are you really trying to make this argument ? 
  easy with the accusations here . 
  once again , i used that `` fact '' as an example of how stats can be interpreted in more than one way . 
  i used that particular example because it 's something i 've seen thrown around a lot with no context . 
  as i 've explained many times above already , i did not come here to argue at all . 
  the numbers are right there in the wiki article . 
  check references 6 & 7 , although the numbers are from 2013 . 
  as perseus said , stats can be interpreted in different ways . 
  for example , a common `` fact '' is that `` sweden has many instances of rapes compared to other countries '' which is true in the sense that sweden has more reports of sexual violence per year , although the stats may not be directly comparable to other countries for a number of reasons : there have been several international comparisons made , placing sweden at the top end of the number of reported rapes . 
  however , police procedures and legal definitions vary widely across countries , which makes it difficult to compare rape statistics . 
  [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] for example , sweden reformed its sex crime legislation and made the legal definition of rape much wider in 2005 , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 8 ] [ 12 ] which largely explains a significant increase in the number of reported rapes in the ten-year period of 2004-2013 . 
  [ 13 ] [ 14 ] the swedish police also record each instance of sexual violence in every case separately , leading to an inflated number of cases compared to other countries . 
  [ 8 ] [ 11 ] [ 15 ] additionally , the swedish police have improved the handling of rape cases , in an effort to increase the number of crimes reported . 
  [ 8 ] [ 14 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_in_sweden yes , it 's a wiki article but the sources are top notch , swedish authorities , bbc , etc. 
  edit : removed mobile link . 
  swedenyes and similar subs are * very * different from sd . 
  they 're a whole new level of racist . 
  this map seems to be quite inaccurate . 
  in addition to what others have already mentioned `` c '' in swedish is commonly pronounced like `` s '' , in `` cykel '' and `` cirkel '' for example . 
  i 've never heard an accent that intense before , then again , i 'm not british . 
  is he drunk and/or scottish/irish ?

  i 'm not saying that .
