  the swedes who own a home or an apartment are going to make profit ( on their property ) on mass immigration , whether they know it or admit . 
  whether their personal safety , children , infrastructure , welfare system will benefit is another issue . 
  everyone knows about malm\u00f6 . 
  what surprises me with your comment is that you seem to imply there are people who are not refugees there . 
  same thing goes for humans , etc. 
  this article does n't highlight intelligence and it 's not anti-refugee . 
  it 's about sweden 's infrastructural failures regarding immigration and it 's about how sweden has created parallel societies . 
  regarding intelligence and threats , s\u00c4po have specifically stated that islamic extremists are the greatest security threat to sweden . 
  a few quotations :  the biggest threat to sweden is those returning from syria and iraq . 
  [ article at expressen ] ( http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/sapo-atervandande-is-krigare-storsta-hotet/ )  it is isis that s\u00c4po views to be the greatest threat to sweden . 
  [ article at dn ] ( http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/ewa-stenberg-sakra-liv-ar-inte-alltid-fria-liv/ )  our present evaluation for sweden is that the greatest threat , at the moment , is violent islamists , says anders thornberg . 
  [ article at sveriges radio ] ( https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&amp;artikel=6098603 )  in 2016 the foremost terror threat against sweden comes from violent islamists . 
  [ article at nyheter24 ] ( http://nyheter24.se/nyheter/inrikes/832722-sapo-islamism-storsta-hotet-mot-sverige ) anyhow , i 'm familiar with the problem with russian psyops ( mentioned in articles above ) . 
  something that is not mentioned in that respect is that sweden has been exposed to russian influence and psyops for generations . 
  considering sweden 's conflicting statements on the security threats , anything swedish authorities claim should also be taken with a grain of salt . 
  swedes think they 're the best in the world morally . 
  swedes think they 're the best at infrastructure , openness and equality . 
  the way swedes have handled immigration and treated their immigrants has shown that this self-image has been delusional . 
  public debate about these things has become turbulent . 
  swedes are trying to deal with the reality of how poorly they 've actually handled these issues . 
  sweden is having extreme difficulty coming to terms with this issue , because reality is in direct opposition with swedes ' self-perception of being invincible in socio-economic policy . 
  norwegian paper writes about situation in sweden , auto-translated article : ** police : these segregated suburbs pose an acute terrorist threat ** gothenburg ( aftenposten ) : around 130 foreign fighters in syria have been recruited from six risk areas in gothenburg . 
  segregated suburbs with repatriated foreign fighters pose an acute threat , says migration officer ulf bostr\u00f6m . 
  `` the district hj\u00e4llbo is the swedish answer to molenbeek , brussels , where terrorists from paris hid while they were planning new actions . 
  we must prepare ourselves , '' says the policeman . 
  just three hours drive from oslo are six neighborhoods in gothenburg characterized by parallel society , crime and strong elements of extreme , violent islamists , according to a recent police report . 
  aftenposten stands outside the door to a so-called garage mosque named `` blue door '' district in hj\u00e4llbo , angered , gothenburg . 
  terror scientists from national defence college in stockholm have characterized the place as a meeting place for extreme islamists and were warned by the police about going too close . 
  ** carpeted washroom converted into a mosque ** aftenposten found the blue door that has given the mosque its name . 
  the venue is a disused laundry in an apartment building close to hj\u00e4llbo center . 
  the door is open and we enter . 
  the nearly 20 square meter room is covered with carpeting . 
  on the walls there are a few bulletin boards and posters in arabic . 
  two easy chairs make up the furniture . 
  `` no shoes ! '', 
  a young man with a dark beard reminds us to take off our shoes before entering a mosque . 
  he sits alone on the carpet in a corner and reads a book . 
  he does not want to say his name , but says in english that he is a computer science student and that he does not speak swedish . 
  he cringes away when we retrieve the camera . 
  `` why do you visit exactly this mosque ? '', 
  `` i visit all sorts of mosques , '' he said . 
  he summons an elderly man who presents himself as a palestinian named ahmed abdelrazek , and emerges as a kind of leader on site . 
  when we ask him about the terrorist researchers ' claim that there is recruitment to isis , he shakes his head . 
  he does not like people from here travel to war . 
  `` it 's insane to train people to commit acts of terror , '' says abdelrazek . 
  the young man may not speak swedish , but he understands a certain amount of the swedish language . 
  he enters into the conversation with the elderly man who suddenly did not want to talk more with us . 
  `` they do n't like visits from the media , '' concludes police inspector bostr\u00f6m . 
  ** fosters foreign fighters in isolated pockets ** we meet the policeman at the police station in the district hj\u00e4llbo , where the audience is operated behind bulletproof glass . 
  bostr\u00f6m has worked in the police for 38 years . 
  he takes us to a meeting where he draws and tells on a blackboard on developments taking place in the northeastern parts of gothenburg . 
  `` gothenburg are among those places that are recruited most foreign fighters per capita in western europe , '' says bostr\u00f6m . 
  the terror in paris and brussels have focused on isolated pockets of parallel societies in europe that fosters foreign fighters and terrorists hiding on the run . 
  intelligence information indicates that is has trained 400 people to attack on european soil . 
  sweden is specifically designated as a target . 
  `` the official alert level is currently at level 3 . 
  i would say that it is at 5 , almost on top . 
  when we hear how the mosques here reviewing the terror in the rest of europe , i am not in doubt , '' says bostr\u00f6m , showing that there was a failed suicide attack in stockholm in 2010 . 
  johan walter sitting in the same meeting room . 
  he is employed in migrationsv\u00e4rket but pronounces himself as a private person . 
  he has worked in the vulnerable districts in almost 20 years . 
  `` i am convinced that it is only a matter of time before it slams , '' says walter . 
  ** a segregated society with violent extremism ** a swedish police report that came just before christmas last year , states that 15 residential areas in sweden is characterized by a parallel society with a strong presence of violent religious extremism and criminals . 
  six of the worst areas are located in gothenburg . 
  these are residential areas where much of the population has little confidence in the police and judiciary . 
  they will not testify in court . 
  conflicts are resolved out of the ordinary justice system , sometimes within clans . 
  many people who live here , have over time been living in a sort of state of emergency with serious crime and shooting in broad daylight . 
  threats and violence are perceived as normal by many , and measures that are inserted , have had little effect . 
  the backdrop is record unemployment , drug crimes , ethnic segregation , stigmatization and sometimes extreme overcrowding . 
  there are examples of 20 people sleeping in shifts in a two bedroom apartment . 
  ** young criminals are recruited ** it is the development of clean immigrant ghettos that worries ulf bostr\u00f6m . 
  `` we have even created the segregated city . 
  a third of the population in gothenburg are immigrants . 
  80 percent of those living in neighborhoods in the northeast . 
  these are places authorities are absent . '', 
  bostr\u00f6m points out that eight out of ten drop out of primary school in some of these neighborhoods . 
  figures for crime and unemployment are ominous high . 
  `` it goes without saying that young people in this environment becomes easy prey for people who want to recruit them . 
  we should remember that this is young people who are not even welcome in his own family because they are criminals . 
  they drink . 
  they see no future . 
  they are then invited into the fire . 
  over time , they get to hear about islam , but only those parts of the religion that suits them who enlists them . '', 
  bostr\u00f6m says that these young people who rule without the basic knowledge of islam , even if the parents are devout muslims . 
  `` first generation are the most stable . 
  but what happens when the elderly fall from ? 
  the potential for even more foreign fighters is enormous , '' says bostr\u00f6m . 
  already last autumn warned the swedish security police sapo about terrorist risk in sweden , and the gothenburg pointed out by many foreign fighters . 
  ** lifetime for beheading two swedes ** two men from gothenburg , a 30 year old and a 32 year old , were in a swedish court recently sentenced to life in prison for beheading in aleppo in syria . 
  a few weeks ago , four men with ties to sweden stopped in turkey as they were supposedly on their way to syria to join the is . 
  no youngsters aftenposten meetings hj\u00e4llbo will take foreign fighters in defense . 
  two young boys stirs up sharply , but they want to be anonymous . 
  one of them is a kurd . 
  they say they know many who have traveled , but no one has returned . 
  `` they are jerks traveling . 
  if they survive and come back , i 'll beat them , '' says kurd alex ( 19 ) . 
  buddy arber ( 19 ) are albanian and says : `` foreign warriors pigs to islamic religion . '', 
  ** notified of developments in the suburbs ** bostr\u00f6m claims he has seen the danger signs long . 
  `` we see that gifted fundamentalists gain more and more control in these suburbs .
