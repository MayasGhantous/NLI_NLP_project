  the less we do to support those muslims who want to approach our democracy , the better breeding ground there for parallel society . 
  people in these suburbs live as social hostages , '' says bostr\u00f6m . 
  `` there has been a shift in recent years . 
  niqab was never used before , but it has come after influence of fundamentalists . 
  we see changes in somalis who previously had sufi traditions of dance and music . 
  now they do not dare to perform this public anymore because they can meet reactions , '' says walter . 
  ** major challenge to reverse the trend ** zan jankovski coordinate efforts against communities with violent extremists in gothenburg municipality . 
  he would not comment on the terrorist danger . 
  `` but it is clear that we have too many syria explorers from the city . 
  of 130 who have traveled , is around 25 dead and 25 have returned . 
  we have received information that fewer trips now , '' says jankovski . 
  he points out that they also have foreign fighters to ukraine and greater extreme-right in town . 
  `` it is clear that the challenge with a segregated and polarized city is a major challenge . 
  reversing a trend that has come over time is not easy . 
  we have a long-term cooperation between several agencies where we work at schools and youth groups in these neighborhoods , '' says jankovski . 
  ** build more housing and focuses on children ** kommunalr\u00e5d for social affairs in gothenburg , marina johansson ( social democrats ) , says that they have taught 3,000 people to pick up signs of radicalization among young people . 
  when they see these signs , contact the parents and school . 
  `` but there is much that has gone wrong in these residential areas , '' says johansson . 
  new migrants are now located in other districts , and new housing will alleviate overcrowding . 
  `` moreover , we will initiate long-term measures within the living conditions and health to reduce social inequalities between districts . 
  with a long-term effort can we stop segregation and create good conditions for the children , '' says johansson . 
  ** fears for kids ** district bergsj\u00f6n was planned for industrial workers at volvo and skf . 
  now bergsj\u00f6n marked by drug and gang crime , and two years ago was one of the first foreign fighters from district killed in syria . 
  somali coach jama abdisataar ( 41 ) has lived in bergsj\u00f6n for several years . 
  he has four children , and also has two asylum seekers on 16 and 17 living with them . 
  now he 's upset for the young . 
  `` some people hang around the mosques , and we know that recruitment takes place . 
  it is bad that they leave people who have fled the war into new violence , '' says abdisataar who himself says he hates islamists al shabaab . 
  he likes it in town , but it seems there is little evidence of sweden . 
  `` swedes move . 
  i do not know why , '' he smiles . 
   in 1492 , social democratic monks settled in sweden establishing the country 's first constitution at the imperial city of imgur . 
  -- tacitus , * germania * , book lx, 
  the left in sweden has a long tradition of antisemitism . 
  this is documented in , for instance , sweden 's largest left party , the social democrats . 
  ilmar reepalu and margot wallstr\u00f6m ( mentioned because redditors may remember their names ) have recently been in trouble for their allegedly antisemitic opinions and actions . 
  you can even look back into the roots of the nineteenth century workers movement and racial biology in sweden to see this . 
  outwardly the social democrats and other parliamentary swedish left parties [ will claim ] ( http://www.socialdemokraterna.se/webben-for-alla/arbetarrorelsen/trosolidaritet/agera-/motesmaterial/antisemitism-och-islamofobi/ ) they are against antisemitism , but their politics and opinions indicate a more complicated reality . 
  sweden 's largest evening newspaper ( social democratic leaning ) , * aftonbladet * , regularly publishes antisemitic material supported by chief editorial staff . 
  antisemitism has hardly ever been a key issue in sweden though , due in part to the fact that sweden is a small , peripheral country with very few jews and relatively little ethnic conflict . 
  in that sense , every country looks like a madhouse from the outside . 
  this may be the first intelligent decision coming from the green party in years . 
  reading between the lines of many articles i suspect merkel might be promoting the border closings now , but outwardly she has to uphold appearances and stand for the correct values . 
  i agree with you on the capabilities of the system and its long-term prospects under present conditions . 
  i 'm sorry to hear you have lost friends over this issue . 
  i know this happens frequently in sweden today . 
  i understand that your opinions are not always approved of here , but you seem levelheaded and reasonable . 
  i think it is swedes ' loss that we do n't want to and ca n't associate with people of differing opinions . 
  somehow over the past few years i 've managed to keep all of my friends , regardless of whether they are on the left/right or `` opposition '' on this issue . 
  i do n't know british culture well , but in my work and travel experience , the british educated classes are more well-rounded than swedes . 
  they 're more frequently economically insightful and practical while also having more knowledge of arts and literature . 
  swedes generally only know their field , which in my opinion is dangerous in economics , bureaucracy , public service , law , etc. . 
  this intellectual simplicity has contributed to putting us in the situation where the professionals are mentally impoverished and incapable of seeing anything but what their superiors , the swedish trade union confederation , timbro or the media , etc. , tell them . 
  i know there are many problems in the uk , but i think there 's a bit more doubt and an older intellectual tradition that can act as an immune system towards some of the sheer simplicity of thought and opinion that can overwhelm swedes and keep them under the weather for long periods . 
  i have n't stated that we 're not allowed to have different tastes . 
  in fact , i encourage that . 
  i do not feel strongly about eco as a public figure or intellectual , and i am not defending his memory . 
  i 'm defending literature and respect for academic output . 
  i agree that people are uptight about dead celebrities ( millions of people die every day ) . 
  however , you wrote you had little exposure to his thought , which strongly indicates you have little understanding of his thought . 
  regardless of whether he was a good or bad person , whether he is dead or alive ... eco 's thought and work is complex and ranged over many decades in literary , academic and other fields . 
  this is not something you can dismiss because he seemed like an elitist and narcissist , which he may have been . 
  you ca n't help but think what you have n't put any effort into investigating ? 
  that 's ignorance . 
  to begin with , all ideas do not get the same exposure through social media . 
  social media posts are ranked and at most sites shown based on various blocking and filtering processes . 
  moreover , people who are famous outside of social media ( tv celebrities , famous newspaper journalists , politicians , pop musicians , multinational companies , etc. ), 
  have the most followers and get the most exposure . 
  random citizens get very little exposure or attention . 
  i 'd argue that the eu did n't handle the one it had in 2015 . 
  i 'm confident it can not handle another one in the summer of 2016 . 
  good blog article . 
  it got some recognition , or i should say i came across it in social media some time last year . 
  although the content is interesting and worth being discussed in itself , what 's most interesting to me is how a calm , moderate statement on this issue is acceptable in sweden on the condition that you have english as your native language . 
  if the blog had been written in swedish it would have been considered scandalous . 
  you 'll find this in many other areas of life , from social gatherings to the media swedes consume . 
  that is , if someone says something in english that is not allowed to be said in swedish swedes sigh with relief and enjoy the statement . 
  it 's as if their true opinions can only be expressed in the language swedes think is superior to their own . 
  if enough people like you leave the tax system will collapse ( although we 're headed there now due to immigration and long-term unemployment of immigrants ) . 
  that might be best way of getting the message across to those in power . 
  plus it 's a non-violent method of resistance , which i hope speaks for itself . 
  good point . 
  neither do i think there are any sound values from the latter category . 
  i 'd rather stick with striving towards openness , democracy , objectivity , empiricism , individual freedoms , female equality , freedom of speech , scientific innovation , secularism , rule of law and so on . 
  to me this ties into the larger issue that our leaders are rarely held accountable for their actions . 
  it 's easier not to think logically and to just assume western values are unassailable , eternal and objectively desirable for all who go to the west . 
  in other words , our blindness to what is going on rests on the same old chauvinistic view that the west is the pinnacle of morality and perfection . 
  i guess it 's hard to make new material and then when you do the audiences just want the old stuff . 
  maybe i used the wrong word . 
  by `` show '' i meant his act in general as seen in interviews and on stage . 
  like race ? 
  it 's an immensely important issue . 
  of course , there are other important issues . 
  the sad thing , as i see it , is that despite increased debate about immigration , no viable improvements to infrastructure , morality or open debate are in sight . 
  it 's a spicy subject . 
  does chris rock base his show on current events or the intricacies of ancient thebian social life ? 
  if you check the dumpster out back you 'll find all the hundreds they had to throw out because they were two minutes past the best-before date . 
  ... with some [ br\u00e4nnvin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/br%c3%a4nnvin ) and it goes down nicely . 
  i keep surstr\u00f6mming around the house to induce vomiting in case my children swallow something poisonous . 
  haha , and there you have a post-modern tv commercial for bacon .
