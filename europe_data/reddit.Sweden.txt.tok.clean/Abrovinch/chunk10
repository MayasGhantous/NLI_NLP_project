  the most obvious answer is [ europa park ] ( http://www.europapark.de/en ) on the border between germany and france , near strasbourg . 
  [ phantasialand ] ( http://www.phantasialand.de/en/home/ ) near k\u00f6ln also seems like a very good park ( have n't been myself ) . 
  in spain [ portaventura ] ( https://www.portaventuraworld.com/en ) seems like a really good park , located some 100 km from barcelona . 
  and finally , something from sweden . 
  [ liseberg ] ( http://liseberg.com/en/home/ ) is a very good park with both good rides and a rather unique atmosphere being located in the middle of gothenburg .

  a classic , [ staten & kapitalet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5vvrurbuqq ) by `` ebba gr\u00f6n '' ( actually the ebba gr\u00f6n version is a cover from 1980 , but it 's by far the most known version . 
  the original is from 1972 by the band `` bl\u00e5 t\u00e5get '' ), 
  i do n't remember reading any of the books , i did see the tv-series though . 
  my two favourites ( because i ca n't just pick one ) are [ emil i l\u00f6nneberga ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewsqsvmmkga ) and [ ronja r\u00f6vardotter ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daegqpsggpe ), 
  same here , but i think facebook is becoming less and less popular with young people ( sub 18 ) . 
  is n't that the same guy who had a very popular song around the same time with the chorus : * du \u00e4r s\u00e5 , yeah yeah , wow wow * `` you 're so , yeah yeah , wow wow '' ? 
  no , the blasphemy law was first rewritten in 1949 to include all religions . 
  it was abolished all together in 1970 . 
  is it ? 
  i ca n't find any information that suggest that , except that you need to pass those subjects in order to apply to the programmes in economy , social studies or humanistic studies . 
  for the natural science or technical studies you must instead pass biology , physics and chemistry . 
  well , you do n't really graduate from primary school . 
  but you need those three subjects in order to apply for secondary school . 
  to be able to graduate from secondary school you need at least 2250 out of 2500 credits , meaning you can fail 2-3 courses ( some subjects have multiple courses ) . 
  but you can not graduate if you fail compulsory courses in swedish , english or maths . 
  yes , in order to attend secondary school , `` gymnasiet '' , you must have passed swedish , maths and english in grade 9 of primary school ( for vocational programmes you also must have passed 5 other subjects , and for theoretical programmes you must have passed 9 other subjects ) . 
  in secondary school vocational programmes have one mandatory course in english , and theoretical programmes have two mandatory courses . 
  rather large and expensive cars are the bestsellers , mostly due to the rules regarding company cars ( it 's often a good deal both for the employer and the employee ) . 
  the top 5 so far this year are : 1 .

  ad station wagons rule , big time , so as long as there are n't any big electric station wagons available ... 
  out of 155 000 newly registered cars so far this year only 6370 have been `` supermilj\u00f6bilar '' with co2 emissions below 50g/km . 
  supermilj\u00f6bilar are either plug in electric hybrids or pure electric cars . 
  i would expect the number of plug in hybrids to grow faster than for pure electric cars in sweden . 
  edit : might add that the swedish car market is rather odd compared to most other european countries . 
  we separated state and church in the year 2000 ...

  holocaust denial is legal in sweden , as is ( apparently ) calling `` homosexuality a carcinoma on the society '' . . 
  yes , sweden had plans to liberate both norway and denmark during the late stages of the war . 
  we had also trained `` police troops '' from both denmark and norway to take part in the invasion . 
  the plan to liberate denmark came the closest to realisation . 
  troops were mobilized in the province of scania and a date was set , however the germans capitulated before the attack . 
  hitler invaded partly to save the supply of swedish iron ore which went through norwegian harbours , especially winter time when the swedish harbours were frozen . 
  the allies had plans to disrupt the deliveries , and even demolish the swedish mines . 
  shortly after the invasion of denmark and norway we were given an ultimatum . 
  in order to stay out of the war we were to continue selling iron ore to germany ( not a breach against neutrality i might add ) , our warships were not allowed outside swedish territorial waters and a few other things . 
  it was pretty much a no-brainier to comply . 
  apparently hitler planned to invade sweden later on in the war , but at that time our military was in a better shape , and mor importantly the tide of the war was turning . 
  actually , no . 
  look at the [ forestation ] ( http://www.fefr.org/files/attachments/fefr/efi_forest_map_juliste.jpg ) ( huge pic ) . 
  sm\u00e5land , which is a huge part of the south - south east next to \u00d6land ( the long thin island ) has loads of dense forests and a very low population density compared to the rest of europe . 
  very difficult to answer , there are so many beautiful places in sweden . 
  but since people already have posted places in south and mid-south i might as well post something in the north . 
  [ sarek ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vm9sozb.jpg ) , more precisely * rapadalen * ( rapa valley ) . 
  location in sweden : [ google maps ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/place/rapadalen/@66.912563,17.5869381,7.75z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x45d9ae1ec90878ad:0xec4647e214a8f8c5!8m2!3d67.2833333!4d17.7166667 ), 
  there are so many things wrong with that team . . 
  there is one football team in the highest league that does n't have a generic name - * sirius * , named after the star . 
  they have used the name since 1907 , so maybe not marketing , but still . 
  population has to be part of criteria though . 
  countries like norway or finland does n't have the infrastructure to take in massive amounts . 
  tacky , but i still see myself going there sometime in the future for shits 'n giggles . 
  exactly , it 's not like the refugees started in denmark . 
  at first there were n't any border controls between denmark and sweden and the refugees could simply take the train and end up anywhere they wanted in sweden , some continued towards the finnish boarder . 
  finally the government realised that it 's far from ideal to have thousands of undocumented refugees roaming around in the country so they a ) introduced border controls from denmark and b ) made the asylum laws much tougher . 
  the border controls were n't really there to reduce the number of refugees ( that 's what the laws were for ) . 
  since the controls were in sweden the refugees were given the choice to either leave sweden immediately or apply for asylum . 
  rather quickly we also introduced similar responsibilities for train - and ferry-operators as already in place for airlines . 
  i.e they had to make sure that their passengers were eligible to enter sweden , or they had to facilitate for their return . 
  this control took place in denmark , and i think it 's gone now ? 
  the last time the amount of new asylum applications was as low as they are now ( first five months of this year ) was in 2009 . 
  there are several ways to go from the * gymnasium * to university . 
  the simplest way is to have done the courses required with grades decent enough to be accepted to the university programme ( and university ) you want to attend . 
  what decent grades are is decided by the amount of applications each year . 
  if you have done the required courses , but your grades are n't good enough you can do * h\u00f6gskoleprovet * - `` swedish scholastic aptitude test '' , which is a test with questions from varying subjects . 
  you get graded from 0 up to 2.0 . 
  the test result is valid up to 5 years , and you can do the test how many times you like . 
  when applying to university it works the same as with the normal grades , except you only compete with others that 's done the test , not with those applying with regular grades . 
  the third way is if you have n't done the courses required , let 's say yo did a vocational * gymnasieprogramme * but later decide you want to be an engineer . 
  you can then do the missing courses at something called * kommunal vuxenskola * - `` municipal school for adults '' , in short * komvux * . 
  the courses are the same as in the * gymnasium * and you get graded in the same way . 
  probably so , it all depends on circumstances and if you actually tried to work towards fixing the issue together with the employee and the union . 
  this is an area where sweden and denmark differs greatly , even though we share the nordic model . 
  denmark value a flexible labour market , while sweden value strong job security . 
  both have its pros and cons . 
  mohammed / s honestly , i do n't really know . 
  i quite like anders for a boy and sara for a girl . 
  i really lack fantasy sometimes . . 
  i do n't have any examples , but i can cite the law . 
  there are two ways you can be let go , dismissal or fired . 
  you can get dismissed for personal reasons , such as being away from work repeatedly without being allowed to , being repeatedly late , being drunk on work several times etc. 
  sickness can generally not be used as cause for dismissal . 
  in all cases of dismissal the employee should , if possible , be offered a different position at the same employer , or to improve the working situation for the employee .
