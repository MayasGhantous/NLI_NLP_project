  so if you are on vacation the whole of july , which has 21 working days this year you get 107.5 * 21 = sek 2257.5 extra in july . 
  or about 9 % extra . 
  the vacation pay can be higher through collective agreement , the `` unionen '' union for instance has 0.8 % instead of 0.43 %, 
  very simplified , but in short : diesels are much more harmful in a local environment due to particles and nox , these things will give people cancer and shit . 
  co2 is n't really dangerous , it 's just that excessive co2 will warm up the planet . 
  public broadcaster svt has two news programmes , aktuellt and rapport . 
  aktuellt is broadcast on svt2 at 21:00 and has one or two main stories which they go through in depth , often with analysis from experts and/or debates . 
  the show is one hour and also includes regional news , sports and weather . 
  rapport is broadcast on svt1 at 18:00 and 19:30 . 
  the broadcasts differs a bit as the first one has a culture segment and the second has a sports segment , both have a segment on regional news and a quick weather update . 
  each show is 30 minuets . 
  throughout the day svt also has `` svt nyheter '' on svt2 , with each show lasting 5 minuets and consists of the most important headlines of the day . 
  tv4 ( private broadcaster ) also has a news show that 's on at 19:00 for 30 minuets and at 22:00 for 15 minuets . 
  all in all i 'd say that tv-news are of good quality here and feel serious . 
  sometimes there is a light hearted clip at the end of the show . 
  vacation is regulated by law , the law states the minimums , a collective agreement may include better benefits . 
  minimum vacation is 25 days , weekends are not included nor are other general holidays or midsummer 's eve , christmas eve or new years eve . 
  during your vacation you have the right to vacation pay . 
  the minimum requirement is 0,43 % of your monthly pay extra per day you 're on vacation . 
  any vacation day on top of the first 20 can be saved up to five years , so if you have 25 days you can save 5 . 
  you can not save days if you use days from an earlier year . 
  the time of your vacation is to be decided between the employer and employee , however the general rule is that the employer gets the last say . 
  you are however entitled to at least four continuous weeks during the period june-august . 
  if you get sick during your vacation you call in sick and are now on sick days instead of vacation . 
  i see that the - y names already have been mentioned . 
  i would like to add z-names as well . 
  z-names are most likely found on girls and are when an `` s '' is replaced with a `` z '' , such as `` zara '' or `` liza '' . 
  at least i always come to the conclusion that something is wrong with that person then . . 
  short school holidays ( one week ) are staggered by three weeks . 
  one in the autumn and one in february/march . 
  the easter holiday is also staggered by two weeks ( before and after ) . 
  winter holidays ( 2 1/2 weeks i think ) are n't really staggered , it varies a day here and there i guess . 
  the same is true for summer holiday ( about 10 weeks ) . 
  i think you could translate it with 112 , which even works on several carriers in the us . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_ ( emergency_telephone_number ), 
  hmm , i have some vegan friends , and i think it 's growing in popularity . 
  parliament = / = government, 
  the big graduation is from * gymnasiet * , which is secondary school . 
  on graduation day the students meet early and get a speech from the headmaster ( often light hearted ) and get to take on their student caps . 
  a lighter lunch/meal is then served in school after which they meet in the classroom one last time and get their grades . 
  after that it 's time to run out to meet parents and relatives . 
  and finally it 's time to ride in open lorries , drinking beer and celebrate !, 
  this clip gives a pretty good idea i think : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4llfh8uiq5m of course , the partying continues through the night . 
  football is like a great piece of classical music . 
  if you just glance at it it can look everything from pretty cool to dull as fuck . 
  however , if you start to immerse yourself into it you 'll start to notice how the pace varies , how quickly things can change and the sheer beauty of it . 
  i looked into it a bit more in detail . 
  you can get a prepaid plan without a personnummer , but you must get it over the counter here in sweden . 
  prepaid can easily be bought at 7-11 or [ pressbyr\u00e5n ] ( http://mb.cision.com/public/1358/9343168/887e22d5f4d9c12a_org.jpg ) which you can find everywhere . 
  as for the offer from telenor , as far as i understand it you can only use the 3gb within sweden , and the 100 sek will be be used for all data , calls and text which all will be billed accordingly . 
  personally i feel like it 's a bad deal . 
  for prepaid i 'd say the king ( in sweden ) is comviq . 
  here are their price plans : https://webbutik.comviq.se/kontantkort.html and their add on eu plans from june 15th : https://www.comviq.se/eu/kontantkort the links are only in swedish , but some google translate should work wonders !, 
  with that being said , if you plan on using loads of data in each country it might still be cheaper to get a plan in each country , but that 's quite the hassle as well . 
  luckily there 's still wifi . 
  hope you have a great time in europe !, 
  as far as i can tell ( and someone please correct me if i 'm wrong ) you need a subscription for the new roaming laws to be applicable . 
  prepaid is only valid in the country you bought it , at least that 's what it looks like now . 
  for a swedish subscription you need a swedish * personnummer * , which is impossible to get as a tourist . 
  the disappointment when there 's only hush\u00e5llsost available . . 
  almost as annoying as the [ skidbacke ] ( http://resources.mynewsdesk.com/image/upload/t_open_graph_image/sbm2i5jtobsgboszyol3.jpg ) . 
  seriously , the people that do `` skidbackar '' in the cheese can go and fuck themselves . . 
  fines or prison up to one year . 
  let me enlighten you then : ** deg ** - dough ** flis ** - woodchips ** grus ** - gravel ( for small value coins ) ** lakan ** - sheet ( 1000 kr ) ** lax ** - salmon ( again , 1000 kr ) ** r\u00f6ding ** - a red one ( 500 kr bill , which are red ) ** st\u00e5lar ** - do n't really know how to translate ** kosing ** - same here . . ** kl\u00f6ver ** - clover ** kulor ** - marble ( the ones you play with ) ** riksdaler ** - old currency, 
  the thing about glenn is that it 's not a common name ( currently 3088 persons use it as their first name ) , yet in 1982 four players of [ ifk g\u00f6teborg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ifk_g\u00f6teborg ) were named glenn . 
  hence the `` alla heter glenn i g\u00f6teborg ! '', 
  - `` everyone 's called glenn in gothenburg ! '', 
  chant started by opposing teams , and later embraced by fans of gothenburg as well i think . 
  [ helen sj\u00f6holm - du m\u00e5ste finnas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2idvi73ais ), 
  well , shit . . was on mobile and it did n't add the comment at first , tried to reload the page and still nothing . 
  reddit probably hired postnord . . 
  just to add , the swedish institute ( which is a government agency ) are solely responsible for this . 
  ministries do n't rule directly over agencies , it 's against our constitution . 
  thus the government is hard to blame . 
  of course , it ads to the circle jerking . . 
  business to business still pay vat , however you offset the incoming and outgoing vat . 
  vat on things the company buy are incoming vat , and the things you sell are outgoing vat . 
  if the incoming vat is higher than the outgoing vat you get money from skatteverket , if the outgoing is higher you pay money to skatteverket . 
  far north you might find some road signs in different sami languages . 
  [ example ] ( http://ritvaelg.weebly.com/uploads/2/5/3/1/25318703/4725118.jpg ) . 
  the sign is for the small village of [ arjeplog ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arjeplog ) , and the other language is [ lule sami ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lule_sami_language ), 
  swimming is pretty up there i 'd say, 
  the bonfires are everywhere in sweden i think ( uppsala too ! ) . 
  and getting shitfaced is a tradition on all holidays , is n't it ? 
  crisps and popcorn ? 
  popcorns are mostly bought either to be made in a microwave or in a saucepan , rarely pre-popped . 
  a classic swedish brand is [ olw ] ( http://www.olw.se/produkter ) another ( more `` refined '' ) is [ lantchips ] ( http://lantchips.com/crisps/ ) crackers are also a common thing , usually eaten with various cheeses . 
  here 's the thing , we do n't just `` take in certain people '' , they come to us . 
  anyone who steps foot on swedish soil can apply for asylum , we then try your reasons . 
  about 50 % of the time we find that you have reason to be given asylum in sweden , 50 % of the time you have not and are not allowed to stay . 
  christians will be tried the same way as muslims , their religion may or may not be a deciding factor if they are given asylum ( such as if they may face death due to their beliefs in their home country ) . 
  it 's all very regulated in what is reason and what is not reason for asylum . 
  most applying do not meet the refugee classification , but are given subsidiary protection , this is the case for most fleeing war zones . 
  edit : crap , i missed the `` eastern '' part of the question , but i 'll leave my answer anyway . 
  stockholm , ca n't live with it or without it ... 
  luckily there are still a lot of alternatives with either swedish or at least nordic ownershipl !, 
  they are however still a quarter pound , 113g . 
  i mean , it 's not like he 's any good at trolling either , too obvious 2/10 . 
  [ yep ] ( https://www.mcdonalds.fr/produits/burgers/royal-cheese ) they do . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.mcdonalds.fr/produits/burgers/le-big-hot-dog ) made me lol a bit actually .
