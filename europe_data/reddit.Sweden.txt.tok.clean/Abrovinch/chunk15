  edit : the big advantage with 2 +1 is of course that it 's practically impossible to have a head on accident . 
  just to take two examples , roundabouts and [ 2 +1 roads ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2%2b1_road ) . 
  it 's all part of the [ vision zero ] ( http://www.trafikverket.se/en/startpage/operations/operations-road/vision-zero-academy/ ) , where the basic principle is that people make mistakes and the goal should be to eliminate deaths and serious injury , not accidents . 
  it is legal , unless you do something stupid , in which case it wo n't be in your favour . 
  i 'd say texting etc. 
  are seen as really stupid by the vast majority , talking on the phone is pretty common though . 
  luckily , our roads are designed with the idea that people have short attention span and do stupid things . 
  also , swedes are generally very safety minded people . 
  use a mobile phone ( without handsfree ) while driving . 
  though , they are in the process of , finally , changing that . . 
  it would be a lot easier to answer if you said which country you 're going to . 
  generally speaking i think it 's pretty ok , there are a few areas which should have som looking into though , such as : pensioners should n't pay more income tax than people who work . 
  the marginal tax rate should n't rise above 50 % ( at the moment it 's 55-57 % for those who make really good money ) . 
  some taxes the current government is trying to impose are stupid . 
  our flag carrier ( sas ) is a bit special , in that we share it with denmark and norway . 
  it does have it 's pros and cons . 
   do you enjoy flying with them ? 
  yes , i do . 
  they have a decent frequent flyer program , and many connections and departures to chose from ( i 'm mostly flying domestic ) . 
  prices are ok for the most part . 
   do you think they compare favourably to other airlines , esp . 
  other flag carriers ? 
  yeah , they are ok . 
  compared to some other flag carriers ( such as lufthansa ) they have a bit less onboard service included ( only coffee/tea on short haul ) but on the whole i think they are pretty good , well organised as well . 
  i do n't like flying with low cost carriers , such as ryanair or norwegian . 
   are there any routes you like and are there any you think should be added ? 
  stockholm-lule\u00e5 is my favourite since that 's the one i use most regularly . 
  sas flies that route 10 times/day each way with 737s i also like the fact that they 're adding on more long distance routes from stockholm , most of them still departs from copenhagen though . 
   do they get any special treatment from the government ? 
  no , i 'm not even sure how that would be legal . 
   how is the government involved in their day-to-day operations ( if at all ) ? 
  do you like this arrangement , or would you prefer a different level of involvement ? 
  nothing at all . 
  sas is owned 17.1 % by the swedish government , 14.2 % by the danish government and 11.4 % by the norwegian government . 
  the rest is privately owned . 
  all state owned enterprises are run like any other business . 
  they get no special treatments and are allowed to do things that the government my not be so found of , like when [ vattenfall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vattenfall ) builds new coal powerplants abroad . . a bit off topic , but swedish agencies are also pretty independent , a minister can not interfere with decision making at an agency . 
  what !? 
  denmark for you !, 
  some americans seem to think that fries goes together with meatballs . . 
  might just add that the skid track is n't for learning how to control a drift , but more to get some experience as to what happens when you reach the limit . 
  you will also get a feel for the increased breaking distance on slippery surfaces etc. 
  there is also a theory part on hazards while driving , with lots of material on alcohol and other drugs . 
  you also get to sit in a crash rig going at 7 kph and are turned upside down while wearing a seat belt . 
  seat belts are awesome . . 
  according to wikipedia the saudi government spends 2-3 billion dollars each year on spreading wahhabism ... 
  unfortunately , saudi arabia also have about 25 % of the world 's oil reserves . 
  so most of the western countries sees them as allies , while they at the same time spread the wahhabism that in many ways is the root of extremism within islam . 
  all in all , it 's fucked up . 
  [ rederiet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rederiet ) is probably the most well known drama produced in sweden . 
  [ intro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztfkcrcibyg ) honourable mention to tre kronor : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tre_kronor_ ( tv_series ) , which ended with a bilarge portion of the cast being killed in a suicide bombing carried out by a religious nutter ... 
   certain countries have `` unwritten constitutions , '' a group of separate documents which , taken together , functions as a whole . 
  ours is simply a single document for all fundamental laws . 
  mainly the uk in the first case . 
  i can only do a comparison to the swedish constitution since i 'm fairly familiar to that one . 
  we have four fundamental laws , but the definition of the word `` law '' is a bit different . 
  i get the feeling n the internet a `` law '' is mostly referring to an `` article '' . 
  the most important fundamental law is the instrument of government , and that 's the one i will refer to from this moment on . 
   i do n't know . 
  you said your newest constitution was put in place to avoid amending an older one , and it 's just a comparison . 
  in that case i was n't clear enough . 
  the main reason was that a big part of it had fallen into obsolescence . 
  therefore it was rewritten from the ground up . 
  a big change was the move from a two chamber parliament to a unichamber . 
  it has then been amended many times , latest in 2014 . 
  in order to amend it you need a simple majority , but two times and have a general election in between . 
   in any case , i still do n't see why you think we should write an entirely new constitution . 
  writing a new constitution does n't have to mean that you do away with everything old . 
  sure , you can amend it but there are some pretty troublesome parts in your constitution , such as the electoral college . 
   is that not similar to your country 's highest courts ? 
  actually , no . 
  but i know that we 're the odd ones here . 
  courts ( any court ) can test if the application of a law is in accordance of the fundamental law in each specific case . 
  but they can not dismiss a law as `` unconstitutional '' . 
  before a law comes into effect it passes through the `` council on legislation '' which may point to problems with the laws . 
  the government is being watched by the `` committee on the constitution '' . 
  but as i said , we 're pretty odd in that . 
  the point i was trying to make was that instead of interoperating old laws it might be better to rewrite them so they make sense . 
   i did say that . 
  the bill of rights merely protects these rights , holding them as granted by default . 
  hmm , the only thing which remotely resembles that is [ allemansr\u00e4tten ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_to_roam ) , which is n't defined what it includes or not . 
  but it is granted by the constitution by the 2nd chapter , 15th article , 4th paragraph : `` everyone shall have access to the natural environment in accordance with the right of public access , notwithstanding the above provisions . '', 
  but then again , does n't that make it the other way around ? 
  i should probably go to sleep now . . 
  it is a thing ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_civil_religion, 
   the us constitution sets the basic laws of the country and federal government and this is different from other countries constitutions in what way ? 
   besides that , there have only been 27 ratified amendments in 250 years . 
  not a big number . 
  is that a good thing ? 
   in any case , we could n't really throw it out and start over , especially now since the party in power could n't even `` repeal and replace '' something as simple as a healthcare measure . 
  you could if your politicians were n't so stubborn all the time . 
  the feeling that i get from us politics is that it 's all about making sure that the other side ca n't do a damn thing , instead of actually making progress that is of benefit to the people and country . .  maybe not , but it was vitally important at the time yes , hence it should be obsolescence . 
  i know that there 's a supreme court ruling stating that the 2nd amendment grants citizens the right to keep firearms for protection of their home for example . 
  but the court was far from united , ruling 5-4 . 
  any properly functioning government would make sure that the laws are clear enough to be understood . 
  but instead you are pretty much guessing how to interpret a 250 year old paragraph . 
  it 's just madness to me . 
   it simply says `` we think these rights are important to us and our people , so let 's write them down so nobody forgets . '' that would mean your constitution actually do n't grant you any rights at all . 
  so no freedom of speech , no fair trials etc. 
  so [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjd6ll3rp6s ) is it apparently . . all i have to say it 's that it reminds be an awful lot of a typical [ dressmann ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgbtmi2co1a ) commercial ...
