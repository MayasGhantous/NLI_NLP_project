  the pension system is often visualized as a pyramid with three tiers ( though the bottom tier really is two parts ) . 
  at the bottom you have the general pension which is funded by the government . 
  16 % of all taxable income is paid into this system ( if you work , it 's paid by the payroll tax ) . 
  another 2.5 % is paid into the `` premiepension '' , which consists of investment funds of your choice , if you do n't make an active choice the pension authority will invest it according to set rules . 
  if you have n't really earned a lot of money you are probably eligible for `` warranty pension '' , which is based on how many years you 've lived in sweden . 
  the second tier is paid by your employer according to collective agreements with the unions . 
  the third tier is your personal savings . 
  every year you are given `` the orange envelope '' which contains all details about your general pension . 
  it 's of course hard to predict the future , especially with a population that 's steadily growing older . 
  i feel that personal savings may become more and more important over time . 
   can you be sentenced to become a slave ? 
  i think it 's more along the line of being sentenced to community service . 
  first and foremost , the us constitution is n't a thing we usually talk about , ever . 
  it 's only on reddit really where at leas i come into contact with people who are almost religious about `` the constitution '' . 
  now , i do have a problem with it ( or rather , i would have if i were a us citizen ) , it 's too damn old . 
  the us constitution is the second oldest constitution currently in use , only beaten by san marino !, 
  this is n't necessarily because other countries been through occupations or revolutions . 
  sweden 's current constitution is from 1974 , and was largely rewritten in 2010 ( mostly to make it clearer to understand and some expansions regarding sexuality etc. ) . 
  we did n't change constitution in 1974 due to war or revolution , we changed it because it was found easier to write a new one than to keep amending the one from 1809 . 
  back to the us constitution , i ca n't say which one of the bill of rights is the most unnecessary . 
  they 're all written with good intent i 'm sure , but they should probably be rewritten to better suit today 's society . 
  the 2nd amendment in particular makes little to no sense in a modern western society . 
   the postal service went retarded with the merger , became slower and more unreliable ( atleast in my own experience , and everyone i know have bad stories of package deliveries through postnord now ) we feel exactly the same here in sweden as well , where do we meet , and who brings the pitchforks ? 
   why not divide postnord into postnord dk and postnord sv , and have each national government responsible for their branch ? 
  that would mean splitting the company into two different ones again . 
  of course , at the moment it seem 's like the better deal for sweden , but i 'm sure there was a reason for merging in the first place . . 
  i believe the danish problems roots from increased competition and the fact that the dansih unions have managed to get extremely good agreements for the workers , not very unlike the case in scandinavian airlines . . 
  i guess the money they asked for ( 3 billion sek in total ) is not just for covering last years loss , but also other things . 
  sweden gets to pay more because we are the bigger shareholder . 
  postnord is run like any other enterprise . 
  the danish part of postnord had a loss of 1.9 billion sek ( 200 million euros ) last year , the rest was making a profit though so the total loss was about 1 billion sek . 
  due to this postnord has asked for more money from it 's owners , namely the swedish and danish state , sweden owns 60 % and denmark 40 % . 
  for sweden this means about 1.8 billion sek to cover the danish losses . 
  at the same time postnord have lost a lot of the faith it had before , mostly due to poor handling of packages ( broken , long delivery times etc. ), 
  swedish and danish postal services went together and formed `` postnord '' , we still have different stamps . 
  also , it was a shit deal for sweden it turns out . . 
  not very , but it does get some attention whenever a swede performs well . 
  as for the other comments here , do n't you read the sports paper ? 
  so , like a government funded tinder ? 
  no problems whatsoever . 
  same simple rule apply to all people , no matter their coulour , religion , sex , whatever . 
  do n't be a dick . 
  as with most kids born in the early 90s any old disney intro will be nostalgic . 
  favourites were [ r\u00e4ddningspatrullen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlddwaciiqe ) , [ ankliv ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfgz4qgz0iq ) and of course [ bumbibj\u00f6rnarna ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjglaxmajeq ) of course anything astrid lindgren will make every swede nostalgic ( including me ) : [ pippi l\u00e5ngstrump ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x-butwttcs ) and [ emil i l\u00f6nneberga ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdopreqtbkk ) and finally [ mumin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tio_zmhf4y ) , which is sung in a lovely finnish-swedish dialect . 
  [ bokus ] ( http://www.bokus.com ) delivers in 35 different countries , and they have loads of books in many different languages . 
  do n't know if they 're particularly cheap or what the shipping will cost though . . after you 've chosen subject on the left you can choose what language you want the book to be in . 
  except that they did n't care about the ruling and still are doing it : https://www.telia.se/privat/telefoni/frisurfsocial?intcmp=start_teaser_frisurfsocial, 
  generally speaking , the uk . 
  but some things are probably more familiar to an american in other european countries . 
  or by logging in on skatteverket for a `` personbevis '' , probably . 
  ca n't check myself since i do n't live in an apartment at the moment . . 
  just do a search on hitta.se or any other site and you will se your number . 
  while we 're on it . 
  the 4 digit code is a necessity for the national register of all apartments , formed in 2010 . 
  the register includes such things as how many rooms each apartment has , what type of kitchen it has and its area . 
  it does not include any information on who lives there . 
  the register is organised by * lantm\u00e4teriet * , the swedish national land survey . 
  * skatteverket * , the swedish tax agency , is responsible for civil registration in sweden . 
  from 2011 each citizen is registred on their apartment , instead of on the property as before . 
  those who live in houses are n't affected , as they already were registred on their dwelling in practice . 
  and finally , the main reason for the register . 
  * statistiska centralbyr\u00e5n * , statistics sweden , can use the register to make census reporting much easier , cheaper and quicker . 
  before they had to send out forms that all property owners had to fill out . 
  edit : the decision to make this register was taken by the [ riksdag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/riksdag ) in 1995 . 
  if you are an eu citizen all swedish universities are tuition free . 
  however , all programmes that are available for online/studying from another place are in swedish , and in order to apply for them you need to be proficient in swedish . 
  and i think it 's the same in other countries as well , scotland might be the best bet , but i know absolutely nothing about higher education in scotland . 
  but i must ask , what is your plan afterwards ? 
  how would studying online at a european university solve your problem of being broke ? 
  now we 're really navigating a minefield here . . 
  but i suppose it 's aik from northern stockholm . 
  keep in min that european supporter culture is a complete different animal compared to american supporter culture . 
  [ aik ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxd6fh1slhg ) supporters , so called `` ultras '' . 
  but as i said , this is a very delicate question . . 
  if there is one positive thing about all this it is how quickly everyone has progressed in the other direction . 
  we 're only talking about a few decades , there is hope for the world . . 
  well , you can . 
  but you must follow the law , and since we have freedom of expression you must be prepared to be offended sometimes , for example if someone draw a caricature of muhammed . 
  but this applies to everyone , we joke about jehovah 's witnesses equally . 
  if you do n't accept the society we live in , well that sucks for you , but that 's the way it is . 
  without digging to much into it , christianity has been in vast majority for hundreds of years , especially in western europe . 
  the last consensus in sweden where people had to announce their religious beliefs was in 1930 . 
  the number of muslims then was 15 , not 15 000 , 15 . 
  so it is something relatively new at least for us . 
  at the same time we have moved towards secularism . 
  sweden today is one of the most secular countries , and also one of the most equal . 
  it is only natural for people to react the way they do when they hear about prophets proclaiming that women should n't be able to leave their homes without permission from their husband , and that they need to cover themselves when doing so . 
  this exact statement has caused a lot of debate in sweden the last few days . 
  on one hand we have freedom of religion , and that is a good thing . 
  it is an undisputed freedom , but at the same time we have come a long way on gender equality among other things . 
  it is the same thing with beggars , we have already done away with that thanks to social progression , but now they 're back and it has taken us some time to figure out how to handle it . 
  no one care if you go to a mosque or a church or whatever , but when your religion start to dictate your life in such a way that people see you as someone who strives backwards , you should be prepared for criticism . 
  it 's your right to freely exercise your religion , but anyone else can also question and criticise it . 
  contrary to what some ( americans mostly ) believe , the freedom of expression is very strong . 
  i guess [ lagom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lagom ) could fall into that category ? 
  [ liseberg ] ( http://liseberg.com/en/home/ ) actually had something called [ lillk\u00f6ping ] ( http://www.lisepedia.se/lillk\u00f6ping ) , which was a miniature city inhabited by german dwarfs as an attraction in 1923 ... 
  yes , we had pretty much the same policy regarding forced sterilization as you it seems : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compulsory_sterilisation_in_sweden we also had a state funded institute for `` race biology '' : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statens_institut_f\u00f6r_rasbiologi, 
  any special genre ? 
  `` kent '' , one of the biggest bands in sweden , had their last tour ever last year - [ vi \u00e4r f\u00f6r alltid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jocj9rld88 ) for maximum summer feeling you need some `` gyllene tider '' - [ n\u00e4r vi tv\u00e5 blir en ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixkloibk61w ) you can never go wrong with some `` carola '' - [ f\u00e5ngad av en stormvind ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wns4nu-boc ) ( live version due to epic dance moves by men in suits . . ) `` h\u00e5kan hellstr\u00f6m '' draws some of the biggest crowds in sweden , [ det kommer aldrig va \u00f6ver f\u00f6r mig ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upx_t4yr3x8 ) and finally if you want something powerful , `` helen sj\u00f6holm '' - [ du m\u00e5ste finnas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2idvi73ais ) everything should be available on most streaming services etc. 
  damn , you 're right .
