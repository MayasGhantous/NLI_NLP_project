  completely forgot the word i was looking for . 
  no beer ( at a bar/restaurant ) before 11.00 anywhere in sweden ... 
  there 's no single truth though , as [ this ] ( https://satwcomic.com/language-barrier ) satw-comic will tell you . 
  i 'm in tears over here !, 
  this sound exactly like something that would happen to donald duck . 
  from july this year nordic police officers will be able to patrol and take calls from other nordic countries . 
  this is especially valuable along the land borders between norway - sweden , norway - finland and sweden - finland due to very low population density along long stretches of the borders . 
  they may only use whatever equipment legal in the country their in , so no tasers in sweden for example . 
  of course the laws in the country they operate in apply . 
  without the subtext i would have no idea what he was trying to say . . 
  damn , do n't know if this link also is unavailable https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxcrj6cuiik but anyway , it 's one of the intermediate acts of last years eurovision . 
  [ obligatory ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amgw54hbos0 ) eurovision ( and melodifestivalen earlier during the year ) are huge events in sweden . 
  it 's really just what you can do with compounds . 
  the beauty of it is that you could just `` make up '' a fitting word . 
  a literal translation would be something like : `` north east sea coastal artillery air reconnaissance simulator facility material maintenance monitoring system discussion posts preparatory work . '', 
  technically possible ( and legend has it it 's in guinness book of records for the longest swedish wordas well ) , but pretty useless . 
  you wo n't find it in a dictionary . . 
  pension age has been the same for as long as i can remember . 
  when we now reintroduced conscription it 's gender neutral . 
  the law was actually made gender neutral back in 2010 when we stopped conscription , but it was made so that it easily could be brought back if needed . 
  it 's already legal here . 
  in the current curriculum sex and sexuality is present in most subjects . 
  of course there 's the classical sex education , what happens in your body during puberty , what kind of contraceptives are available , how you use them and what shortcomings they have . 
  i remember my class also visited a youth clinic at some point . 
  sexuality is also included in subjects such as history , society , religion , music , english , swedish etc. 
  condoms are readily available , and often free for younger persons . 
  according to statistics 20 % of all sexual acts in sweden include a condom , this may sound very low but keep in mind that this is all sexual acts , including those in a long standing relationship . 
  36 % of all sexual acts have no contraceptive at all . 
  edit : the figures are pretty much the same for the other nordic countries , finland is a bit higher with 25 % , while norway and denmark are a bit lower with 17 % . 
  agree with you on pistvakt !, 
  it 's available to watch on [ \u00d6ppet arkiv ] ( https://www.oppetarkiv.se/video/1150433/pistvakt-sasong-1-avsnitt-1-av-6?ac=pist ), 
  finland , for obvious reasons . 
  i have a soft spot for grotesco . 
  [ the trial ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyu2p4l5iua ) is a good example , [ tingalin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn9lowzjxdu ) another ( apparently some russians were a bit offended by this one ) and finally , [ runka bulle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uivytlc779q ) . 
  `` runka bulle '' is an urban legend where men are jacking off onto a bun , whoever cums last has to eat the bun . 
  the song is about never `` runka bulle '' with jesus christ , since he never comes last . . 
  just so you know , around 2.1 is replacement rate , i.e no population growth . 
  thing is , we already reached peak child . 
  population growth nowadays is due to people living longer . 
  the name historically comes from the different tax levels , known as * klass i , ii , iib and iii * . 
  klass i is the * l\u00e4tt\u00f6l * , up to 2,25 % abv and can be sold to anyone . 
  klass ii is * folk\u00f6l * `` peoples beer '' between 2,25 % and 3,5 % and can be sold in regular stores . 
  klass iib was called * mellan\u00f6l * `` middle ( strong ) beer '' , and was between 3,5 and 4,5 % and could also be sold in regular stores , albeit not after 20.00 and on sundays . 
  this class was discontinued in 1977 . 
  finally klass iii is everything above 3,5 % ( used to be over 4,5 % ) and must be sold at a systembolag . 
  nowadays the taxation on beer works a bit different . 
  beer over 2,8 % abv is taxed by sek 1,66 per litre and % abv . 
  this means that * folk\u00f6l * with 2,8 % abv is dirt cheap and * folk\u00f6l * with 3,5 % abv is not really worth it . 
  many of the most common international brands are available as 3,5 % abv beers as well , including heiniken , starobpramen , corona , guiness etc. 
  of course domestic brands are the most common ones . 
  well , except our current pm of course . 
  started out as a welder and then worked for a union . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.motorwallin.se/bilder/artiklar/zoom/2711-0907_1.jpg ) you go , a folding 2m ruler . . 
  many public toilets here are now paid for by card only . 
  there 's an admission test that takes about 8 hours . 
  during the test you will meet a psychologist , do an ekg , general medical exam , test of your general intelligence and understanding of words , test your eyesight and hearing as well as a test of your raw strength and endurance . 
  the muscle test is done on an [ isokai ] ( https://commonsoldier.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/isokai_maskin1.jpg ) , while the endurance test is done on a spinning cycle with increasing resistance . 
  you are graded between 1 and 9 on each test ( except maybe hearing and eyesight , which is just pass/not pass if i remember correctly ), 
  yes , but not for denmark in football , norway in skiing or finland in ice hockey . 
  6 june , it celebrate two things . 
  instrument of government from 1809 and when gustav vasa was elected king in 1523 . 
  it was officially dubbed national day in 1983 , before that it was known as * svenska flaggans dag * , `` the flag of sweden 's day '', 
  yes , i 've sailed quite a few times in the stockholm archipelago , and sometimes crossed over to either gotland or \u00c5land . 
  we usually stay out about two-three weeks at a time . 
  i , at least , have n't really heard of any cases where any of this has caused any real problems here , so i guess it works . 
  might just add that the confirmation note also needs to be approved by both the social welfare board and the mother . 
  so no one can just claim fatherhood of fatherless children . 
  more paperwork , but less problems in the long run . 
  if i 've read the ( swedish ) law text correctly a woman claiming someone to be the father is n't sufficient evidence of him being the father . 
  * a father needs to admit being the father by signing a paper , the signing needs to be supervised by two persons . 
  if no one admits to being the father the social welfare board will start an investigation to find the father . 
  if the case is brought to court strong evidence needs to be put forward , such as a genetic exam . 
  * if the man and woman are married , the man is automatically considered to be the father , unless there is reason to believe otherwise . 
  also , support is n't that much money here in sweden , the recommended amount is sek 2-3k / month ( $ 225-340 ) per child , which is shared between both parents . 
  no , we have lay judges ( n\u00e4mndem\u00e4n ) instead . 
  practically any swedish citizen under the age of 70 can apply , however some limitations apply . 
  the lay judge works aprox . 
  15 days per year and get paid along with pensions etc. 
  the lay judges vote carry equal weight to the normal judges . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/osacz4ghqjs?t=280 ), 
  i have some bad news for you , the mosquitoes are already here . . we even have government funded `` air raids '' against mosquitoes in part of the country . 
  france and sweden ( along with a few others ) have already done some co-operation : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dassault_neuron a similar setup could also be feasible for a future fighter , albeit we would probably want the planes for the swedish air force be assembled in sweden . 
  well , sex is a way of showing love , would n't you agree ? 
  hmm , actually i do the same . . must have gotten a sudden rush of shit to the brain . . 
  do n't need a modem , i could just plug my computer directly to the ethernet socket in the wall and be online . 
  i do however have a router for wireless access and to be able to connect more devices . 
  pretty much , the 9.3 $ goes to my isp and the other 20 $ ( that i just pay indirectly through my rent ) goes to the owner of the infrastructure ( the actual fiber and connection to my apartment ) . 
  this gives me many options on which isp i want to use . 
  the same system is also applied for electricity , meaning i have at least 30 different electricity companies to choose from , and i change provider often . 
  edit : ~ ~ might just add that usually ( always ? ), 
  there 's just one bill you pay , even though the money goes to different companies . ~ ~, 
  fiber 100 mbps up and down , no caps . 
  9,3 $ per month that i pay to the service provider . 
  the connection fee of about 20 $ is already included in the rent . 
  city area, 
  the license fee is about 2300 sek/year ( 240 $ ) and funds sr , ur and svt . 
  sr , * sveriges radio * is the national radio broadcaster with six channels , p1 , p2 , p3 , p4 , p5 stockholm and sisuradio . 
  p1 broadcasts news , documentaries , science , culture etc. 
  p2 plays classical music and programs in other languages p3 is more of a youth channel . 
  65 % of what 's broadcast is music ( 1/3 of that swedish ) , unlike the commercial channels they play all sorts of music from all different genres .
