  they also have programs related to youths . 
  also , they like to talk about sex , alot . 
  p4 is actually 25 different regional channels , with local news and other programs , also sport . 
  p5 stockholm is only available in stockholm and is a lot about stockholm and multiculturalism . 
  sisuradio is a channel in finnish . 
  there 's also a digital only ( i think ? ), 
  channel in sami . 
  ur , * utbildningsradion * make both programmes for radio and tv . 
  they do educational programmes , for example on swedish slave trading or about a guy doing hip-hop in sami . 
  svt , * sveriges television * , is the tv-broadcaster . 
  the different channels are : svt1 broadcasts pretty much everything from entertainment , their own shows , movies , news , political debates etc. 
  svt2 broadcasts educational programmes , investigating programmes , news , debates from the parliament , culture etc. 
  svt barnkanalen broadcast children 's programmes , mostly in swedish but are also providing content in the minority languages . 
  and finally , svt play and \u00d6ppet arkiv . 
  they are the online streaming services , svt play has all the current shows broadcast and even som exclusively available on svt play . 
  \u00d6ppet arkiv `` open archive '' has old memorable tv events that svt holds the right to , including old * melodifestivalen * - shows . . also old classical swedish drama series . 
  overall i like all three of them , they are doing a good job making sure that there is something for everyone . 
  in some ways it would be better if it was funded by taxes , but that would mean it would be under direct control of the government , which is less than ideal . 
  the fact that you need a permit to have dancing , in a bar or elsewhere public . 
  the reasoning being so that the police knows where a lot of people will be circulating and problems could arise . 
  about a year ago it was decided to reformulate the law so that you do n't need a permit for dancing any more . 
  the law is still in place though , and probably will be a couple of more months . 
  well , it 's the basis of any free society is n't it ? 
  the ability to make a deal with anyone about ( practically ) everything , and thus the ability to not make a deal . 
  i remember that post . 
  it was a danish guy who wanted to replace his heating unit . 
  by law the heater needed to be installed by a professional . 
  the contractor only wanted to in stall a unit bought from him , probably due to warranty issues , and he can of course chose to whom he will sell . 
  he was never unable to buy the unit from poland , it was just that he could n't have it installed in the correct way since the contractor only wanted to use a unit from himself . 
  the license fee ( funds svt and sr , as well as ur ) is $ 22/month , everyone who owns a tv-reciever has to pay . 
  the channels `` tv4 '' and `` tv6 '' are free airing . 
  other channels come in package deals from the different providers . 
  prices , depending in package , range from $ 11 to $ 55/month . 
  pre-parties are the norm with the younger generation , as well as with students . 
  beer and spirits are expensive in bars and nightclubs , so you `` warm up '' with your buddies before . 
  `` after parties '' are also not unheard of . 
  of course , the main goal with a night out in sweden is to get piss-drunk . . 
  the what ? 
  if i were to vote today i would probably vote for `` liberalerna '' . 
  except denmark of course . . 
  [ relevant satw ] ( https://satwcomic.com/language-barrier ), 
  anything [ dr bombay ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vfebzd-fhq ) really . . 
  of course not , we live in a society !, 
   wo n't be easy . 
  the remaining shipyards are mostly military ones . 
  and mining/milling is n't anymore in western europe . 
  wrong !, 
  there are many big shipyards in europe , most famously in finland , france , germany and italy . 
  i would estimate that 95 % of the worlds cruise ships are built in one of those countries . 
  there are also loads of so called repair yards in europe . 
  mining is a huge industry in northern scandinavia . 
  kiruna mine is the largest underground iron ore mine in the world . 
  the salary is very good as well . 
  yes , they 're especially common in washing rooms in apartment buildings . 
  drying cabinets also exists for clothes that are n't supposed to be dried in a dryer . 
  i fly quite regularly , mostly domestic . 
  i often see people who have `` failed '' with liquids , i have n't seen anyone with a knife but i suspect that you would n't get through with it . 
  sometimes there are random checks on bags and yourself . 
  oh and you can keep your shoes on . . 
  overall i feel that it 's a very efficient process to go through security . 
  normally i 'm airside within 3-5 minuets from stepping into terminal 4 ( domestic ) at stockholm arlanda . 
  and that 's including checking in a bag . 
  old american pickups are not very common , however you could find one in reasonable nick for about $ 5000-6000 i guess . 
  it would probably be a bit smaller model though . 
  if it 's older than 30 years ( and considered a car , which is up to 3.5 t ) there 's no road tax here . 
  you still need to do an annual inspection , mot . 
  based on what can be seen on the internet a lot of the cars running around in the us would not pass a swedish mot ... 
  [ knugen !, 
  ] ( https://gfx.aftonbladet-cdn.se/image/19519181/1000/normal/3b27afd8d44a5/kungen.jpg ) , well actually carl xvi gustaf . 
  we have had loads of kings ( and a few queens ) , [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_swedish_monarchs ) has a nice list . 
  not german , but it 's probably the same as here . 
  we just do n't label people that way . 
  if it 's an immigrant some might wonder from what country , but that 's generally it . 
  only in america ( in the western world at least ) do you speak about `` race '' on a daily basis . 
  here it 's a thing only neo-nazis do . 
  it 's mostly just banter . 
  ^ basically the equivalent of high school . 
  the only insurance you really need is a * hemf\u00f6rs\u00e4kring * , literally `` home insurance '' . 
  it covers your home , and all your stuff you have at home from theft , fires , lightning etc. 
  it also includes legal support , liability if you for instance breaks someone else 's stuff , insurance for your stuff you bring with you when travelling and some stuff ( up to a value ) you store at another place . 
  more comprehensive variants also include extended travel insurance accident insurance , for example if you were to accentually drop your phone into the toilet . 
  other extensions include small boats , golf and forest insurance . 
  if you own a car you need to have at least a liability insurance for it . 
  i 've never actually heard of someone using the liability insurance for such a small thing as spilling wine on someone 's carpet , there are probably easier ways to fix that . 
  i have been in all [ provinces ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/provinces_of_sweden ) , except j\u00e4mtland , sm\u00e5land , blekinge and \u00d6land . 
  overly complicated and silly expensive . 
  the ones farthest down on the social ladder get to suffer even more . 
  keep in mind that each european country has it 's own healthcare system . 
  many countries use a system with insurance companies , yet it 's universal . 
  other ( like sweden ) have a system which is financed ( almost ) solely by taxes , yet you get to chose your provider , public or private at no extra cost . 
  * [ prawn sandwich ] ( https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-69auvbjslam/totzhakv8oi/aaaaaaaaj_0/tumq-xb5lp4/s1600/r\u00e4kmacka.jpg ) it refers to when you get everything in life easy without any effort . 
  89 sek ( 9.3 $ ) / month for 100 mbps , optical . 
  though it should be said that the physical connection is included in the rent , i just pay for the actual service . 
  according to op 's history some would also use `` parasit '' ( parasite ) . . 
  [ snowroller ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8uwndao3o8 ) is a must whenever you 're going on a ski-trip . 
  got ta watch out for the `` liftwaffe '' though . . 
  i think it 's a good decision , if we can not provide the armed forces with personell on a voluntary basis we need some conscription as well . 
  the laws regarding conscription changed in a couple of ways in 2010 . 
  the main change was of course that general conscription was put on hold , but could be brought back with ease if the situation required it ( which is the case now i would say ) . 
  it was also made gender neutral , so this is the first time women will be called to the tests in the same way as men .
