  [ obligatory ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvuc9olw2yk ), 
  you are [ 100 % ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf2wbrwb9xi ) correct on [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12vh55_1ul8 ) ... 
  oh , i almost forgot about g\u00fcnther , still thinks he 's hilarious though !, 
  mostly by income taxes paid paid to the municipalities and counties , you do n't pay income tax to the national government until you hit a higher tax bracket . 
  it 's also not entirely free at the point of use , you still pay a symbolic fee when you visit your doctor , probably to avoid `` overuse '' . 
  since some counties ( it 's the counties that 's responsible for the healthcare ) have a more challenging task of providing good care for all it 's citizens the government also support many counties . 
  most private health care providers are financed the same way , and the fees are the same for the patient , thus giving the patient a choice of provider . 
  yes , however there is some flexibility in the system . 
  such as newbuilt apartments can have higher rents , and when renovating the owner often increase the standard of the apartments as a way of hiking up the price . 
  the rent is decided upon by a form of collective agreement ( much like wages on the swedish labour market , where such a system works very well ) . 
  according to a report from boverket , the national board of housing , building and planning , some 90 % of the problems on the stockholm renting market is due to inefficient use of the available apartments , only 10 % is due to an actual lack of apartments . 
  our rental system ( of flats ) with the finnish system . 
  edit : sweden has a 100 % controlled rental market , causing shortages , long queues and unfairness . 
  yet it still has a lot of support by all parties in the parliament . 
  the idea is to keep the prices down and prevent segregation . 
  however , studies has shown that while it does keep the prices down it actually causes segregation by being an inside/outside system . 
  the queue for getting a rental apartment in the center of stockholm is something like 20 years ( or so i 've heard ) , and the rent for those apartments are kept artificially low compared to apartments in the suburbs . 
  it will turn green automatically . 
  when there 's no traffic the lights will show red for all directions , but when a car approaches it will turn green for just that car . 
  the light will begin to turn right again as soon as the car is in the intersection . 
  i always stop at red . 
  swedish lapland ( same size as bulgaria ) : 0.84 / km ^ 2 varies a lot within sweden too . 
  but yes , europe as a whole is more dense , but scandinavia ( which is a pretty big part of it ) is n't . 
  internet went down last time just over a year ago , due to a massive dns fuck up by my isp , or so i was told at least , changed isp a week after . 
  phone service , no idea . . ( i only use mobile ) . 
   the largest amusement park in the nordic countries is almost visited by only 97 % danes !, 
  the largest amusement park by what measurement ? 
  tivoli in copenhagen has the most visitors of all parks in the nordic countries , while liseberg in gothenburg is the park with the biggest attractions . 
  ulf lundell - [ \u00d6ppna landskap ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuouev9egi8 ) , no question about it . 
  mostly because people are dickheads and fail to keep the main kitchen clean , and sometimes even steal food from fellow students ( there are small fridges in each student room , but all the freezers are shared ) . 
  another thing to factor is that us swedes are very individualistic . 
  short answer : depends . 
  long answer : universities do not own any accommodation facilities themselves ( they 're not allowed to ) . 
  students chose their living situation on their own . 
  generally speaking there are two forms of living , * studentkorridor * or * studentl\u00e4genhet * . 
  * studentkorridor * is the cheapest form of living . 
  you have a room which is about 20-25 sqm , it includes a bathroom with shower , and a kitchenette . 
  you share a full size kitchen with other students ( 8-12 ) . 
  as far as i know no new * studentkorridor * is being built . 
  some people like this form of living , while other try to get away from it asap . 
  * studentl\u00e4genhet * is a real apartment , they vary in size from about 24 all the way up to 60 sqm . 
  they have a kitchen with all facilities . 
  some of the apartments ( especially the smaller ones ) come furnished , while others are unfurnished . 
  what do you mean by `` sometimes '' ? 
  here we go again . . 
  there are some places that 's seen an increase in violent crime . 
  i strongly oppose these areas being called no-go zones , it just is n't a fitting description . 
  the police always enter these areas , always . 
  the problems began way before the migrant crisis , the seeds are at least 20-30 years old . 
  and it 's `` classical '' gang related violence where many of the gang members are of immigrant background . 
  why ? 
  decades of failing immigration policies . 
  getting a foot into the swedish labour market is not easy . 
  especially if your education is lacking . 
  what needs to be done ( according to me ) ? 
  short term we need more police officers and social services must be better at targeting families with problems . 
  we also need stricter laws regarding gun violence . 
  long term we need to make sure that everyone get adequate education , and that it 's of good quality . 
  we need to make sure that everyone can get a job , by lowering the thresholds . 
  etc etc was sweden a paradise 10 years ago ? 
  no , it never was . 
  but it was , and still is a very good country to live in . 
  our economy is strong . 
  we have our fair share of problems to deal with , but so does every country on earth . 
  personally i alternate between * liberalerna * and * moderaterna * , both part of the swedish ( classical ) right , but in the grands scheme of things they are probably pretty centric . 
  is this the nh state run company ? 
   some systembolag have started being open until 20:00 though . 
  the ones at shopping centers outside the city center are generally open till 20:00, 
  it may sound crazy , but it 's not bad at all actually . 
  great costumer service , huge assortment etc. 
  since they 're not allowed to benefit one product over another the mark up is the same on all product ( 6-7 % if i remember correctly ) , the rest is taxes . 
  this means that the good stuff is n't stupid expensive compared to the stuff that 's just fancy piss . 
  how much is a 355 ml ( 12 fl oz . ), 
  of samuel adams over there ? 
  the regular boston lager is $ 2.04 , while the ale is $ 2.37 . 
  i quite like both !, 
  other samuel adams sold at systembolaget are octoberfest , winter lager , cream stout and rebel ipa . 
  a few more . 
  vw : * hitlerpulka * - `` hitler sledge '' saab : * s\u00e4lj aset annars byt * - `` sell the pos , otherwise change it ( for something else ) '' * renault , en sitter i tv\u00e5 skjuter p\u00e5 * - `` renault , one inside two pushing '' volvo : * v\u00e5ffla * - `` waffle '', 
  the only store allowed to sell alcohol above 3.5 % abv in sweden . 
  owned 100 % by the government . 
  if a civil war ever breaks out in sweden , * kex * would be the reason . . 
  that 's kinda gross , * mensen * literally means `` the period '' or `` the menstruation '' . 
  but if that 's your thing , sure . 
  sex is sex , and six ( 6 ) is also sex . 
  i was a few minutes late to systembolaget on friday , so there 's that . . 
  i think it has something to do with [ this ] ( http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/vn17j/in-english-this-happened-in-sweden-friday-night-mr-president ), 
  have n't put any thought into it . 
  apparently she has a dual citizenship , swedish and norwegian . 
  [ ebba busch thor ] ( https://christiancarlsson.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/ebba_busch_thor_2.jpg ) , leader of kristdemokraterna ( christ democrats ) , smallest party in the parliament at 4.57 % of the votes . 
  and sometimes just * staterna *, 
  it 's also not illegal if there 's no crossing available . 
  german bordershops , a lot of swedes go all the way since it 's cheaper . 
  there 's a danish store just after you crossed the \u00d6resund bridge , but it 's not even cheap . 
  only like 8 euros cheaper for 24 cans of beer . 
  yeah , alcohol is a big one . 
  24 cans ( 33 cl ) of carlsberg is 30.60 euros at systembolaget , at bordershop you can get the same amount for only 9.95 euros . . 
  still , could be worse . 
  the price in norway is 81.20 euros . . 
  main difference is that the american variant is fire cured , while snus is pasteurized .
