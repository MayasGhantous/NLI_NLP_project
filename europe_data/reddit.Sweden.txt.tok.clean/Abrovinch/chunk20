  the fire cured variant is far more likely to give you cancer . 
  9 % of the population between 16 and 74 smokes daily , 11 % use snus daily . 
  there is a big argument on how harmful snus is , but it 's generally seen as a better alternative to smoking , even for the user . 
  i do n't use tobacco at all , but i prefer snusers over smokers by far . 
  lastly , snus and snuff is not the same thing . 
  snuff is dry and sniffed , snus is moist and placed under your upper lip . 
  snus is also different from american `` dip '' , even though they look pretty alike . 
  then we 're out . 
  [ percentage of young adults aged 25-34 still living at home ] ( http://brilliantmaps.com/europe-live-parents/ ) scandinavians are probably the most individualistic people in the world . 
   why some weirdos put the mashed potatoes on top the sausage and not beside it like normal , i do not know . 
  it 's a thing in gothenburg , hel or halv special . 
  the one in the picture is a `` halv special '' since it 's only got one sausage in the bun . 
  `` hel special '' is two sausages and mashed potatoes in a bun . 
  i might be misunderstanding your point here . 
  but sweden has only had minority governments since 1971 , except on three occasions . 
  1976-1978 , 1979-1981 and 2006-2010 . 
  the current left-right divide among the parties has stayed pretty much the same as well , except that the center party was supporting the social democrats in the middle of the -90 s. 
  i 've done day trips lule\u00e5-kiruna a few times ( 340 km one way ) , it 's doable but you 'll need to wake up at a criminal hour and you 'll be home very late again . 
  does n't help that the road is shit as well . . 
  yeah , we have a ( big ) part of the country that 's really unpopulated as well , nothing but trees everywhere . 
  in such an environment the car is really the only viable option for medium distances . 
  thankfully air travel to those parts are subsidised by the government . 
  there is a rail road covering this part of sweden , but it 's mostly freight . 
  during the summer they run passenger trains , aimed for tourists though . 
  http://inlandsbanan.se/en/travel anyway , what i wanted to say was that i agree with you . 
  some parts of the world just is n't populated enough for it to be better public transport than maybe a bus time to time . 
  actually , the population density along many corridors is not that bad . 
  the us has a greater population density than sweden as a whole . 
  most people still take the plane the longest distances though . 
  that 's about 320 km , it 's not a short distance , but it 's not stupid far either . 
  it 's completely possible to do a 2000 km ( 1250 miles ) trip without leaving sweden or go in a circle . 
  holy shit , that can fuck right off !, 
  now i 'm pissed ... 
  yeah , systembolaget is a huge company really . 
  436 stores , 5300 employees . 
  and we spent 27.6 billion sek ( 2.92 billion euros ) there in 2015 . . 
   regulations regarding sale of alcohol ( shops , happy hours etc ) up to 3.5 % abv may be sold in grocery stores , anything above that may only be sold at [ systembolaget ] ( https://www.systembolaget.se/english/ ) . 
  bars and restaurants need a license . 
  food must be available for purchase at all time , and non-alcoholic alternatives must be well presented and cheaper than alcohol , just water is n't enough . 
  happy hours are ok , as long as it 's a general promotion , not just on alcohol . 
   alcohol in advertising allowed , but with very strict rules . 
  it 's only allowed in printed text and on the internet . 
  * only the actual product may be presented , and it should be targeted at people over 25 years of age , at least 20 % of the ad must be a warning text . 
  in print the maximum abv is 15 % * since many tv-channels send from abroad they can have alcohol adverts anyway . 
   minimum drinking and purchasing age minimum drinking age at bars and restaurants is 18 . 
  you can buy alcohol up to 3.5 % abv from a grocery store when you 're 18 as well . 
  to buy from systembolaget you must be at least 20 years of age . 
  under supervision and in moderation you may drink alcohol at your home at an age that is seem appropriate . 
  there 's no real limit set . 
   drinking in public generally no , but also yes . 
  and sometimes no , but it 's ok anyway . 
  and sometimes it 's just no . 
  edit : the legal drink-drive limit is 0.2 per mille , so do n't do it . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdr0kbbw6d0 basically , you need to get rid of the stuff that 's not meat and add loads of condiments . 
  it 's a bit complicated , the boats are not operated by [ sl ] ( http://sl.se ) , but by [ waxholmsbolaget ] ( http://www.waxholmsbolaget.se ) . 
  however , they do have co-operation so you can have a second `` reskassa '' och you sl-access card for use on the boats to the archipelago , note that they have a different pricing policy . 
  many parts of the archipelago is also accessible by bus . 
  the stockholm pass seems overpriced to me . 
  a one day pass is 600 sek , 3 days 1000 sek . 
  most museums cost between 100 and 200 sek a visit , and [ 16 museums ] ( http://www.visitstockholm.com/en/see--do/guides/museums-with-free-entry/ ) have free entry . 
  for transportation either get a 7 day sl card for 315 sek , or if you wont use the bus/subway as much get a sl access card and fill it up with whatever amount you want . 
  a single trip when using a sl access card is 30 sek , no matter how far you want to go inside stockholm county . 
  meatballs with fries also , people `` eating '' surstr\u00f6mming the wrong way as a challenge . . 
  do you have access to a microphone stand ? 
  if yes : [ det g\u00f6r ont ] ( https://youtu.be/yh9eqfy8dmu?t=51 ) otherwise anything from [ carola ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wns4nu-boc ) or [ abba ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfrguyw1v8s ) will do the job . 
  do n't walk on manhole covers with the letter a , such as [ this one ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-huw-efhunli/tkgfg5gej3i/aaaaaaaaahi/f4chajuyse4/s1600/001_141677085.jpg ) , as it means bad luck in love . 
  on the other hand , do walk on manhole covers with the letter [ k ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lkjygdl1tmu/ucfbigyrfoi/aaaaaaaaco4/jw5xgcbvogm/s1600/20130612_160244.jpg ) , it means good luck in love . 
  some people tend to believe that a stands for `` avlopp '' , which is ~ ~ suer ~ ~ sewer . 
  but that 's not true , a and k are markings for different manufacturers , a for `` alvetsa '' and k for `` karlstads gjuteri '' . 
  also , do n't put your keys on the table . 
  ah yes , [ \u00f6stg\u00f6tska ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y71ei6wzhfu ) ... 
  same computer is 4995 : - here , about 530 $ . 
  of which 999 : - or 105 $ is vat . 
  was n't that part of a ( failed ) trade deal , where we would get some oil , and you would get part of volvo ? 
  http://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/stockholm/placerade-ut-poliser-da-sjonk-brotten-med-62-procent article in swedish , but the public violence in the stockholm suburb of tensta ( which is a bit of a problematic area ) went down with 62 % last year thanks to more visible police officers and allocating more resources to crack down on drug dealers etc. 
  problem is ( as always ) lack of resources . 
  with only 20 000 police officers in a country of 10 million and large geographical area you can only do so much . 
  at least most politicians are calling for more police officers and higher wages for said officers . 
  it 's the first step that needs to happen right now , then there are other things that needs to be done . 
  immigrants have a hard time getting a job for instance . 
  per capita , i should have said . 
  statistically , you are way more likely to be the victim of a crime in stockholm than in malm\u00f6 . 
  however , malm\u00f6 has recently , once again , had an increase in the more violent crimes . 
  the total amount of crime in sweden is actually decreasing , but people are feeling more unsafe . 
  edit : just to make clear , i 'm not saying all is well , nothing to see here . 
  there are problems , and we need more police officers among other things . 
  it 's just not as bad as some make it seem . 
  uhm , not really . 
  official swedish crime statistic just register crimes , not who committed it . 
  there 's been special reports on who commit 's the crimes , the latest was in 2005 . 
  part of the problem is local alt-right persons , and others using every crime committed by an immigrant as fuel for their agenda . 
  saying things are shittier than they are . 
  no one really denies the fact that immigrants commit more crimes than native born people . 
  some people say they commit more crime because they 're immigrants . 
  while other , more sane , persons realise that the reasons are far more complex than `` they 're brown '' . 
  btw , some of the worst serial rapists were blond blue eyed native swedes . 
  oh dear . . rape statistics is really really difficult to compare , it really only exist so that general trends within a single country can be made visible . 
  studies has shown that in reality the amount of rape in sweden is pretty average for a european country . 
  ( which of course still is way to high ) . 
  the reason to why we seem to be a big outlier in the statistics is because the definition of rape is extremely broad here , broader than in our neighbouring countries .
