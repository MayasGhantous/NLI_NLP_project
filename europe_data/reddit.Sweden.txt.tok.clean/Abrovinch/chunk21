  then there 's the fact that in sweden a lot of effort is made to register all cases that can be suspected to be rape . 
  as this is done at a very early stage of the process , cases are included that later turn out to be some other sex crime , or even no crime at all . 
  in addition to this , all individual acts are registered -- not just the latest occasion or the main crime . 
  in many other countries cases like these are filtered out and do not show up in the statistics . 
  not uniting as one country , but continue our cooperation in the nordic council . 
  https://www.norden.org/en thing we might be able to look forward to is a united electronic id for all the nordic countries . 
  which is what 's needed in sweden as well , some nice nordic co-ordination here !, 
  that 's pretty spot on actually . 
  my debt is around $ 35k , but it 's not that much of a problem . 
  current interest rate is 0.34 % and the payments depend on how much i earn . 
  this debt does n't affect my possibilities to get a loan from a bank for an apartment , to buy a car or get a credit card . 
  we do n't have a system of credit rating here , your ability to pay is determined case by case . 
  i think the system is good as it makes the student independent from their parents . 
  you can still go to university in another city and not be worse off than anyone else , even if your parents are not so well off . 
  it really is part of the [ nordic model ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_model ) , each country has it 's own take on it , but the purpose is the same . 
  it 's probably part of the reason why the nordic countries has some of the highest social mobility in the world . 
  in sweden you are considered proficient enough in swedish to meet the requirement if you have passed either `` dansk a '' in a danish secondary school or `` norsk '' in a norwegian secondary school . 
  is it the same in norway ? 
  the requirements are different for each programme , you 'll find the exact requirement in the description of the programme , found on the website of the university hosting the programme . 
  there 's a general base requirement that consist of : * have successfully completed their upper secondary ( high school ) education ( post-16 ) . 
  * be able to demonstrate proficiency in english . 
  the entry requirement for studies at the bachelor 's level in sweden is the equivalent of the swedish upper secondary course english 6/english b. 
  * the student must have successfully completed courses in mathematics to reach the level of the swedish courses mathematics 1a , 1b or 1c / mathematics a ( approximately 10 years of mathematics studies ) . 
  haha , no . 
  if you find yourself at a scandinavian bus stop [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/g2dqgr5h.jpg ) is what you do . 
  it really depends . 
  we actually do talk a lot , having a meeting and letting everyone have their say in a matter is how swede 's tend to do work together . 
  what we do n't do is talk to strangers we do n't have anything to talk about with . 
  we 're just not good at small talk , we do big talk instead . 
   he should n't , but that can be solved by having a highly decentralised government where the individual states have loads of devolved powers . 
  in which case we might just as well leave it as it is . 
  i guess i just do n't see what the positive sides are . 
  more power in the world ? 
  maybe , but is it necessary to have another `` super power '' fighting to be the one of most importance ? 
  all the nordic countries are are small and pretty insignificant in the grand scheme of things , yet we all have managed to create wealth and welfare . 
  i honestly think that our independence and a sense of pragmatism in politics play a key role in our success , hence you 'll find the most resistance to a federal eu in the nordic countries ( together with the uk ) . 
  sometimes we need to come together as one europe and decide on important questions that affects all of us , that 's when the eu come into play . 
  posted the wrong link , wikipedia page : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_law_ ( legal_system ), 
  you can only be somewhat decent in a language if you practise it continually . 
  i did three years of french in school and it would n't help me even if my life depended on it . 
  since op is moving to sweden , chances are there 's an ikea in the city he 's moving to . . 
  hunting is one thing . 
  every year the swedish epa gives the all clear to shoot a set number of wolves in some areas , the wolf population stays pretty constant over time though . 
  this wolf hunt is to keep farm animals , and even other wild animals healthy , yet the eu usually have stark opinions on the matter . 
  another example was when they were going to ban several tobacco flavours . 
  sweden has an exception from the eu ban on [ snus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snus ) and the flavours they were about to ban are essential to snus . 
  https://studyinsweden.se more specifically https://studyinsweden.se/plan-your-studies/degree-programmes/bachelors-programmes/, 
  not just language , our way of life differs far more between nations than many here seem to realise . 
  how would a federal europe even work ? 
  we have different [ legal systems ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/legal_systems_in_europe.svg/1150px-legal_systems_in_europe.svg.png ) , vastly different views on [ lgbt ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qyytvib.jpg ) , different views on abortion etc. 
  why should someone in the netherlands have a say on hunting in sweden ? 
  our differences are way to great for it to work . 
  the eu is pretty decent , but time to time it tries to regulate things it frankly should stay the fuck out of . 
  we use [ these ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/matm\u00e5tt.jpg ) from left to the right `` spice measurement '' , teaspoon , tablespoon and deciliter . 
  no thanks . 
  the laws are not lax at all ( see rape statistics ) , the sentences for some violations should probably get an overhaul though . 
  there is a political majority for the latter . 
  renting a car in the netherlands and leaving it in sweden cost at least 1600 euros , and that 's for a little piece of shit city car . 
  your tip is only valid for renting and staying within the same country . 
  i do n't know about norway or germany , but for sweden the answer is generally a yes . 
  the important thing is to get a job and be able to support yourself financially . 
  you will be able to find the adequate information from each country 's migration board . 
  [ norway ] ( https://www.udi.no/en/ ) [ germany ] ( http://www.bamf.de/en/startseite/startseite-node.html ) and for good measure , [ sweden ] ( https://www.migrationsverket.se/english/startpage.html ), 
  [ obligatory ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kwujuu-h5a ), 
  in opinion polls those in favour of staying in the eu get about 50-60 % , while those who want to leave get about 20-25 % , the rest is undecided . 
  sony mobile still have a pretty big research office in sweden . 
  sweden has something called * totalf\u00f6rsvarsplikt * , `` total defence duty '' . 
  this duty includes every swedish citizen and non-citizen living in sweden , male or female , and is between the age of 16 and 70 . 
  there are three different duties , armed , civil and general service duty . 
  only swedish citizens between the age of 19 and 47 can do armed duty ( military ) . 
  civil duty includes making sure the power supplies are up and running etc. 
  general service duty is to service the total defence with anything it might need , for instance health care . 
  for armed and civil duties you must first do several tests which you will be called to , if you fail to show up you will be sentenced to fines . 
  if you do n't do your designated duty in the total defence you will be sentenced to prison up to four years . 
  yes , he is the biggest cartoon character of them all . 
  see [ this ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20161227/donald-duck-was-swedens-most-watched-tv-show-of-2016 ) , and [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donald_duck_party ) . 
  swedish state television , svt sends from a service every sunday at 10:00 . 
  the service could be from any christian church anywhere in sweden . 
  the centre party must have some really good municipal politicians in kiruna . 
  kiruna voted 47,38 % social democrats and only 2,95 % centre party in the riksdag election . 
  it should also be noted that the social democrats are huge in almost all of northern sweden . 
  they are allowed in all 900 public sea ways . 
  they may also be allowed at other places , but that 's up to the local county board . 
  they are somewhat popular , at least in the stockholm archipelago , where they usually play around the [ big ferries ] ( http://www.sjofart.ax/sites/www.sjofart.ax/files/styles/article_slider_master/public/images/ships/ms_silja_symphony_stockholms_inlopp_060713.jpg?itok=o2uqmo6e ) ... 
  forget about stockholm , it 's near impossible to get accommodation at the moment . 
  real fake news are not uncommon around christmas , usually involving a removal of donald duck ... 
  otherwise , well it sort of depends really . 
  there are some alt-right news sites that push a very clear agenda , and some would argue that `` main stream media '' push a more leftist agenda . 
  i would argue that the evening tabloids , such as aftonbladet and expressen are shit , but that 's not new , nor are they really fake either . 
  they do n't really threaten us , but they sure do like to be provocative . 
  as in air space violations , sending planes towards gotland and then turn in the last minuet etc. 
  of course they just say `` we do nothing , what are you talking about ? '', 
  in 2016 there were 89 persons killed in a terrorist attack in france , in 2015 it was 149 persons , according to wikipedia . 
  in 2013 there was 3268 traffic related deaths in france . 
   of course not . 
  in a globalized world everyone dresses the same . 
  that 's oversimplifying it though . 
  people usually work because they want to pay for their rent , food etc. 
  with their own means . 
  someone working hard as a nurse saving lives is paying for you .
