  make no mistake , if no one is working their will be no money . 
  i could pay less taxes , or the tax money could be used to improve healthcare , build better roads/railways etc. 
  but no , you want to sit on your ass doing nothing instead . . 
  the swedish constitution consists of 4 fundamental laws . 
  the youngest of these laws is `` yttrandefrihetsf\u00f6rordningen '' , the freedom of expression . 
  it should be noted that this law has very much in common with `` tryckfrihetsf\u00f6rordningen '' ( freedom of the press ) from 1949 , which in turn traces back to 1766 . 
  the oldest fundamental law still in use is the `` act of succession '' , which regulates the line of success to the throne . 
  this law is from 1810 when we elected a new house ( bernadotte ) as king . 
  the law has been rewritten several times since then , most notably in 1980 when it was made so that the first born was made to be first in line , even if it 's a woman . 
  the most important fundamental law is `` regeringsformen '' . 
  it sets out the basic principles for political life in sweden defining rights and freedoms . 
  the current is from 1974 , but the first one is from 1634 . 
  the current regeringsform was rewritten in 2010 . 
  and i do n't think it 's fair that my tax money should go to people that straight up refuse to contribute . 
  sounds pretty much the same as it is here . 
  the most common fraud is to fake a handicap and get disability payments . 
  no , in order to get money you need to prove that you do anything in your power to get a job . 
  this include searching any job that fit your qualification within the area of your commute . 
  if you are n't qualified enough you could be mandated to get more education/training . 
  you must also use any savings etc. 
  before you get financial aid . 
  all in all , i think it 's a fair system . 
  if you get stuck in a sticky situation you get help , but you ca n't just do nothing and expect other to pay for you . 
  i live in uppsala , about 70 km north of stockholm . 
  the weather has been the same for about a week or so . 
  temperature around 0 \u00b0 c and 50 shades of grey . . 
  `` if you are legally resident in an eu country you are entitled to open a `` basic payment account '' . 
  banks can not refuse your application for a basic payment account just because you do n't live in the country where the bank is established . '', 
  [ eu-link ] ( http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/financial-products-and-services/bank-accounts-eu/index_en.htm ) , the link is available in multiple languages . 
   unless you mean to say that the reporters paid the police and the attackers to play a role i do n't know what role political affiliation could play here . 
  we do n't know what happened when the cameras were shut off . 
  yes , there are many criminals in those areas ( mostly drug-related ) , and yes they can probably get a bit jumpy , many citizens do also take great pride in their areas , no matter what . 
  asking the question `` how does it feel to live in little mogadishu ? '', 
  is a bit like asking for trouble . 
   again , it depends on your definition whether it 's a no go zone or not . 
  it definitely does n't make you feel safe or want to go there . 
  honestly , i do n't feel unsafe in those areas ( and yes , i 'm white and a native swede ) . 
  sure i do n't really want to go there , but that 's because those areas are boring as fuck . 
  you are more likely to be the victim of a crime in any city center . 
   it depends on your definition of a no go zone . 
  in this video you can see a car driving over a reporters foot when asked what living in `` little mogadishu '' is like . 
  i knew it was going to be from 60-minuets . 
  it should be noted that 60 minuets co-operated with swedish alt-right media when they did that reportage , they clearly had an agenda and should really not be used in an argument . 
   there was also a svt ( i think ) report a few years back that police and rescue vehicles were being attacked when they entered certain parts of malm\u00f8 this on the other hand is true , and the same has happened in other areas as well . 
  ** but ** , these things comes in waves . 
  i live in uppsala , where one of these 53 zones is situated . 
  lately , absolutely nothing is going on there , no cars are burning , no rocks have been thrown etc. 
  and it ends in ** wedding ** , i wonder if someone saw the last episode of `` the grand tour '' . . 
  i mean , wtf is `` your women '' even supposed to mean ? 
  men and women are equal and have the right to their own body , and thoughts . 
  if that means we are `` pussified '' , then i suppose we are . 
  renting a car is easy , but also expensive . 
  train and bus tickets are easily bought through [ resrobot ] ( https://kopbiljett.resrobot.se/en/#/ ) . 
  train tickets become available 90 days prior departure , and get more expensive the closer to departure you get ( like airline tickets ) . 
  for longer distances flying is a valid option , use either sas or norwegian . 
  the biggest cities are in the south , but the nature is more breathtaking in the north . 
  hostels are safe . 
  to make a toast you say `` sk\u00e5l ! '' . 
  thanks to `` allemansr\u00e4tten '' , the right of public access , you can walk , pick berries and camp pretty much anywhere except on cultivated land and in some ones garden . 
  please read up on it [ here ] ( http://www.swedishepa.se/enjoying-nature/the-right-of-public-access/this-is-allowed/ ) . 
  swedish cuisine is much more than meatballs and fermented herring . 
  you should definitely try out the fresh seafood , reindeer or moose and swedish pancakes . 
  also , do n't forget to have a [ fika ] ( https://sweden.se/culture-traditions/fika/ ) with a classic swedish cinnamon bun . 
  for more info i recommend to look at : https://visitsweden.com, 
   how did you get the idea of him being `` shamed '' into giving it away ? 
  there is actually some truth to that . 
  his brother died before him , but a french paper mistook his death for alfred and published an obituary stating `` le marchand de la mort est mort '' ( `` the merchant of death is dead '' ) . 
  although it should be said that it has n't been proved that this obituary was the reason for the nobel prize . 
  we do n't really have a formal adress . 
  sometimes ( younger ) shopkeepers use `` ni '' when addressing costumers . 
  in the olden days , when titles were very much in use ( doctor `` x '' , engineer `` y '' , shopkeeper `` z '' etc. ), 
  `` ni '' was used on people that did n't have a title , and thus some elderly may actually find `` ni '' a bit offensive . 
  when speaking to a group of people `` ni '' is the correct term though , note that the `` n '' is n't capital when used for a group . 
  otherwise `` du '' is the correct term to use . 
  if it is someone you know the name of , use the first name . 
  only in the military is the last name used . 
  very elaborate joke : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlcbrc2obfe, 
  according to wikipedia abortion was legalized , but still heavily regulated from 1938 . 
  today 's abortion law has been in effect from january 1 1975 and it gives the woman the right to have an abortion for any reason the first 18 weeks . 
  if there are special circumstances this may be lengthened to week 22 , but this is very rare . 
  if there 's a serious risk of death to the mother abortions can still be carried out even after week 22 . 
  from january 1 1998 the woman does n't need to have any relation to sweden in order to get an abortion the first 18 weeks . 
  very few people are against abortion , and it 's not something that 's discussed in politics . 
  there 's currently a legal case where a midwife is suing one of the counties because they fired her over the fact that she did n't want to perform abortions . 
  she has already lost in one court , but is backed up financially by american lobbyists . 
  the general consensus is that she is in the wrong . 
  you really do n't want to crash into a moose while driving , [ result ] ( http://nwt.se/inkommande/6ustjj-\u00c4lgolycka-v869-bj\u00e4lverud-arvika2.jpg/alternates/ogimage_1200/\u00c4lgolycka%20v869%20bj\u00e4lverud,%20arvika2.jpg ) . 
  last year 5874 road accidents involving moose were reported in sweden . 
  volvo has n't been part of ford since 2010 when they were sold to the chinese company geely . 
  under the chinese ownership volvo has actually become way more swedish than under ford . 
  the new cars that are coming out are built on a volvo developed platform and have volvo developed engines ( the old 5 and 6-cylinder engines were all developed and built in sweden as well ) . 
  so far the only volvos built ground up on the new platform without any involvement from ford are the [ 90-series ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rewiddumwy ) , the new 60-series will start rolling out this year followed by the 40-series next year . 
  the new volvos are far above any vw . 
  speaking of irn-bru ( hard to get here unfortunately ) , they 're on point when it comes to [ commercials ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibulgsvcquy ) , [ one more ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5jh89vcbpo ), 
  the philosophy has changed a bit i think . 
  older volvos are about safety , and practicality while still being somewhat nice . 
  the new volvos are about safety and scandinavian luxury , which is about lightness , natural materials and simplicity . 
  i like the new volvos , but there are people who prefers the older style volvos . 
  we tend to love practicality here , wagons are way more popular than sedans . 
  considering that they 're quite expensive i would say volvo cars , almost 20 % of all cars sold in sweden last year were volvos .
