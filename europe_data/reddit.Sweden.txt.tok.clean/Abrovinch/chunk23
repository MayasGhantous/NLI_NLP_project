  sure it 's a domestic brand and all , but still . . 
  true , but studies has shown that the risk of death or serious injury for motor cyclists has gone down dramatically thanks to the barrier roads compared to what it used to be . 
  edit : the risk of death for motor cyclists is expected to have been reduced by 40 to 60 % compared to a road without barriers . 
  it 's mostly used in northern european countries . 
  once had visitors from the uk that did n't know how to use a regular cheese slicer . . 
  any male with a name ending with - y , such as johnny , conny , ronny , roy , kenny etc. 
  are most likely white trash . 
  [ 2 +1 barrier roads ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2%2b1_road ) , although often hated they really are great , allowing for safe overtakes and also reasonable speeds ( 100-110 km/h ) . 
  they are a part of the [ vision zero ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vision_zero ) , a programme focused on minimizing the risk of death or serious wounds from an accident . 
  it builds on the idea that people are idiots and will do stupid things on the road , let 's make sure that the accidents wo n't be serious . 
  indeed it is , but it still happens . 
  in recent years it was the storm * gudrun * , which hit hard on southern and western sweden in 2005 . 
  around 20 people lost their life as a result of the storm . 
  700 000 households lost their electricity , phones also went down . 
  250 million tress were knocked over , leading to [ this ] ( http://hds.imgix.net/_ycwk8atwcy4vkef5aql6smmznc.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2centropy&amp;w=980&amp;h=588&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60 ) huge pile of timber , it took 7 years to get rid of it all . 
  the ( at least recent ) natural disaster that took the life of most swedes was the [ 2004 earthquake in the indian ocean ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/countries_affected_by_the_2004_indian_ocean_earthquake_and_tsunami#countries_that_lost_citizens_while_abroad ) were 543 ( +17 missing ) swedes lost their life . 
  why not ? 
  we have a handful us citizens applying for asylum every year , of course almost none are accepted , but still . 
  +1 for the maritime museum , loads of interesting things to see there !, 
  some of the most liked health centers and hospitals in sweden are private . 
  they are still ( mostly ) financed by the counties though , so you do n't pay any extra fees . 
  i still think that the counties themselves should run major health centers and hospitals though . 
  but the private health centers are important ( about 40 % of all health centers/cliniques are private , most run by just one/two doctors with staff ) . 
   kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 . 
  you are now an honorary swedish citizen . 
  tbh , the referendum on nuclear power did n't have a choice that was pro nuclear . 
  there was only three different ways to abolish it . 
  not really , more scandinavian/nordic . 
  are we ? 
  in order to apply for asylum you need to be inside the country were you want to apply . 
  if you make it pretty much impossible to enter you do n't get any refugees at all . 
  however , everyone that does slip through have the right to apply for asylum and a fair investigation should be made . 
  that 's the theory at least . 
  well : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_relating_to_the_status_of_refugees the things that differs between countries are how well they provide for asylum seekers , and what kinds of residency they give . 
  one of the main reasons sweden was so overwhelmed in 2015 was that the general rule was to give all that were granted for asylum permanent residency and good opportunities for family reunification . 
  this changed very abruptly towards the end of 2015 . 
  last year the number of asylum applications fell by 82 % in sweden . 
  and lastly , we must understand that there 's a difference between applications and granted applications . 
  last year about 60 % of all decisions were positive . 
  ah , yes the `` let me tell you about your country '' mentality . . 
  although it should be said that they are fuelled by certain elements inside sweden as well . . 
  right now : [ creamy taco ] ( http://www.olw.se/produkter/creamy-taco ) one of the most common flavours , [ dill & chives ] ( http://www.olw.se/produkter/dill-graslok-chips ) is apparently pretty uncommon elsewhere . 
  which is a shame really -, 
  basically this , just want to add that the fees may differ between each counties ( not by much ) , the same limit of 120 euros still applies . 
  the medication becomes free at 230 euros ( 2200kr ) . 
  most private health care providers are also covered in the same scheme . 
  about 40 % of all primary health centers ( the first contact with the health care unless an emergency ) are private . 
  they are founded through the counties and you get to chose which wan you want to have as your primary doctor . 
  everyone with at leas 12 months residency and a swedish personal number is covered , so you do n't have to shop around and compare different insurance policies . 
   edit : dental is not covered by this but dental i do n't completely free for any one under 18 . 
  as a young adult some municipal does cover dental beyond that bug not past 25 dental is free to anyone up to 21 years ( new from this year , and will be extended to 22 the next and 23 the year after that ) . 
  you still get a `` dental care allowance '' every year , which amounts to 32 euros , or 16 euros depending on age . 
  you can save it one year so at the maximum is 64/32 euros . 
  dental care is still subsidised . 
  you pay yourself up to 315 euros , all costs between 315 and 1560 euros are subsidized by 50 % , and all costs above 1560 euros are subsidized by 85 % . 
  * real * snow is n't wet . 
  ( until you get indoors ), 
  right now i 'm in uppsala , and it 's not too bad tbh , sunrise today is at 08.20 and sunset at 15.44 . 
  each 24 hour period lengthens the daylight with 5 minuets . 
  for kiruna sunrise today is 09.28 and sunset is at 14.15 , for each 24 hour period the amount of daylight is extended by about 9 minuets . 
  sure , it 's very dark in december and it can be a bit depressing , but you 'll quickly notice the high rate of change . 
  well , the problem i see here is that this hypothetical league seems very north american . 
  do n't know about other european countries but at least here in sweden , most ( if not all ? ), 
  leagues have [ promotion and relegation . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/promotion_and_relegation ) less business , more actual sport . 
  there is actually a pan-european hockey tournament with the best teams from each participating league , [ champions hockey league ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/champions_hockey_league ) this years final will be played on february 7 . 
  link to the tournament : http://www.championshockeyleague.net though i would say that the national hockey leagues are far more popular . 
  nordic countries does n't have a minimum wage , it 's decided upon by collective bargaining between unions and employers association . 
  college/university is free and you also get student allowance from the government . 
  in sweden at least , we have this sort of strange relationship with our flag . 
  we love having it in international sport events , if it 's a national flag day ( like the kings birthday ) we sort of expect it to be flown in official settings and on buses . 
  very few people do fly the flag on their own though , which has made some alt-right groups come to the conclusion that we do n't fly the flag because it 's supposedly racist , it 's not . 
  we just do n't bother , and rather save it for something special . 
  step one is to not have a rubbish car . 
  modern automatics are way quicker than manual cars , and more economical . 
  generally speaking , not a problem . 
  there are of course exceptions , like outside a mcdonald 's at 4 in the morning on a sunday . . or the day after valborg ( april 30 ) in [ uppsala . . ] ( https://cdn1.cdnme.se/cdn/7-2/2392973/images/2012/ekoparken2_142168170_199883991.jpg ), 
  personally i drive a manual , however if i were to change i would n't mind an automatic . 
  2015 was the first year that automatics outsold manual transmission cars in sweden , and i guess that this held true last year as well . 
  we do n't really have the system of majors as you do . 
  you enter a programme which has predetermined courses that you follow from day one . 
  the most popular programmes , by number of applications , are various law programmes ( five years ) , physician programmes are also popular . 
  now , this does n't mean that most people here are becoming lawyers and judges . 
  the programmes with the most number of actual students are probably ( do n't have any statistics ) nurses , bachelors of social service , engineers , teachers etc. 
  as i said , i do n't have any data to back up these claims so any one with actual data , feel free to correct me . 
  but , uhm ... that 's how private schools tend to work here as well ( and private health care , elderly care etc. ), 
  although it 's not a right , you must apply for it and fulfil all laws and regulations . 
  and of course it 's monitored . 
  as to your question , i do n't really know . 
  maybe the fact that the royal family does n't have freedom of religion . 
  the plot thickens . . 
  which lead on to a follow up question . 
  * krona * is obviously the side with a crown , or the [ three crown emblem ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/coat_of_arms_of_the_swedish_parliament.svg/250px-coat_of_arms_of_the_swedish_parliament.svg.png ) if no crown exist . 
  but the new 5-kronor coins has crown on one side and three crowns on the other , which side is * krona * and which is * klave * ? 
  [ the new coins ] ( http://nyasedlar.nu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/m-m.jpg ) , plus the old 10-kronor coin which is kept . 
  i do n't agree with you . 
  sas is not making fun of people trying to learn , it 's making fun of total oblivious people who take pride in ignorance . 
  if you actually want to learn , feel free to ask here ( if it 's about europe ) . 
  and do n't drive into a canal . . 
  driving in europe is fun !,
