  do n't know how familiar you are with european rules and customs when it comes to driving , but two important things to remember are [ priority to the right ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/priority_to_the_right ) and to keep right on motorways . 
  especially on the german autobahn there can be some serious high speed traffic , always keep a lookout in the rear view mirrors and keep distances . 
  hope you have a nice trip !, 
  35 applications from the us were processed last year , 1 was actually accepted . 
  norway is just strange though , since citizens of the nordic countries have the right to live in whichever country they see fit , no applications . 
  well , last year we apparently had 25 asylum seekers from usa , and 5 from norway ... 
  shoes off !, 
  did n't even wear shoes in class until 4th or 7th grade ( memory is a bit off on this one ), 
  we did n't either , it became popular about 10 years ago due to changed taxation . 
  road tax on diesel cars was calculated in a different way compared to petrol cars , but it changed with the introduction of particular filters . 
  i should also note that road tax in general is pretty low in sweden compared to other european countries . 
  four wheel drive is becoming increasingly popular ( still normal cars though ) . 
  regarding winter tires it should be noted that we do n't use the same sort of winter tires as on the continent . 
  we either use nordic friction tires or studded tires . 
  was thinking about new cars , but diesel is on the way down again . 
  petrol has historically been more popular , and is becoming more popular again though . 
  just to add , it 's the total weight ( car + maximum number of people and cargo ) that has to be 3500 kg or less . 
  we 've had them here as well , mostly known as * irl\u00e4ndska asfaltsl\u00e4ggare * , irish asphalt pavers . 
  apparently they have repaved the driveway for many people , without being asked to do so . 
  of course they try to get money for it as well ... 
  we do n't really distinguish between cars and trucks the same way you do . 
  so the suburban is considered a car , albeit a big car . 
  pickup trucks are often called pickups . 
  the average car in sweden is larger than in most other european countries ( we have longer distances to drive i guess ) . 
  another thing that makes us a bit special is the love for station wagons , we like being practical . 
  some typical cars people drive here : [ volvo v90 ] ( http://teknikensvarld.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/volvo-v90-2017-061-700x457.jpg ) [ volvo v60 ] ( http://teknikensvarld.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/10-volvo-s60-v60-polestar-2017.jpg ) [ vw passat variant ] ( https://www.carsbase.com/photo/volkswagen-passat_variant_mp53_pic_124558.jpg ) [ vw golf ] ( http://indianautosblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2015-vw-golf-uk-spec.jpg ) [ kia ce\u00e9d ] ( http://www.kia.com/se/-/media/files-from-kme/pip/carousels/pip/jd5dr/jd_5dr_atm1_stage_1_1920x1080.jpg?w=1024 ) [ bmw 5 series touring ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/77/ad/df/77addf2d48fbfd70f3e1a3317627df81.jpg ) as for engine sizes , normally 2-liter diesels with 150-200 horsepower . 
  however we , unlike some other countries , does n't tax by engine size . 
  indeed , wonder how we would cope with that . . 
  many swede 's already have a hard time getting into their head that some finns have swedish as their mother tongue , and thus their own dialects . 
  as we use to say , it 's way to much * k\u00e4bbel *, 
   st barthelemy this one is interesting . 
  the french gave the island to us in 1784 , in exchange of trading rights in gothenburg . 
  the island was given back to the french in 1878 . 
  there 's still some swedishness to it though , the main `` city '' is called * gustavia * , the airport is called * gustav iii airport * ( gustav iii being a swedish king ) , and there 's a swedish consulate on the island . 
  would be fun to visit , even though it 's really french . 
  our governments usually put a lot blame on the governments before them . . 
  american wages are so strange to me . 
  on one hand there 's people earning so little money they barely make it work , on the other hand many jobs are really well paid . 
  the average swedish teacher makes $ 42,000-43 ,000 per year . 
  not an amazing salary ( the general consensus is that it needs to go up ) , but far from absolute shit as well . 
  edit : when comparing between countries like this we should of course mention the fluctuations in currency . 
  the dollar is very strong compared to the krona right now . 
  two years ago the same average wage would translate into $ 58,000, 
  yeah , the greens had quite a few scandals in 2015 and 2016 . 
  mehmet kaplan , who was the minister of housing and urban development was found to have ties with islamists and turkish ultra-nationalists . 
  he also compared israel with nazi germany . . 
  he was eventually forced to resign . 
  then there 's the case of yasri khan , who was a candidate to be a member of the board of the green party ( he never was in the parliament though ) . 
  during an interview he did n't want to shake hands with the reporter since it was a woman and therefore against his religion . 
  the co-leader of the greens , gustav fridolin , later said in an interview that he was aware of yasri khans religious views but did n't see how it could be disrespectful . 
  ( fuckin really !? ), 
  and as you said mona sahlin ( social democtrats ) is very famous for her many scandals ( did anyone say toblerone ? ), 
  then there 's members of the sweden democrats who do stupid shit all the time . . 
  it really does n't have anything to do with our military capabilities ( although i agree that we need to up our capabilities ) . 
  we are however very sceptical against giving more power to the eu , and in turn lose the ability to decide for ourself . 
  that list is 100 % bullshit . 
  the wealthiest swedish politician , [ per westerberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/per_westerberg ) is n't even on it . 
  do n't know about net worth , but i do n't expect it to be anything special . 
  the prime ministers salary is 164 000 sek/month ( $ 18,300 17 300 $ ) . 
  he pays about 48 % of that in income tax . . ( do n't worry , for lower salaries the taxes are much more humane ) the prime ministers official residence is [ sagerska huset ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sager_house ), 
  totally agree with you . 
  according to eurobarometer the population in 21 of the 28 eu member nations ( including the uk ) was for a joint eu army . 
  the biggest resistance is found here in sweden with 34 % for and 64 % against . 
  the other who are against are uk , ireland , austria , portugal , finland , denmark and cyprus . 
  i vastly prefer `` real '' airlines over the low cost alternatives . 
  sure , they might be a bit more expensive but it does n't have to be a huge difference if you book in good time and can be a bit flexible . 
  i still do fly with norwegian on domestic routes occasionally though , when the price difference simply is to big and i have to go on a specific date . 
  otherwise i mostly use sas which , while we 're on the subject , is a bit `` interesting '' to use sometimes . 
  for those unfamiliar sas is the national carrier of sweden , norway and denmark . 
  it 's main hub is in copenhagen , but both stockholm and oslo are also big hubs . 
  this means that sometimes you get routed through copenhagen , even on intra-europe flights . 
  on long haul copenhagen has historically been the main hub , with oslo only having flights to new york , and stockholm only having flights to new york and chicago . 
  nowadays this has changed a bit since oslo has a flight to miami ( the flight alternates between oslo and copenhagen ) , while stockholm has flights to los angeles and hong kong as well , both are destinations unique to stockholm . 
   you can not have a proper house without a sauna true words . 
   lol , 25mm is close to one inch ( 1 '' ) not 10 :-) lol , you 're right , had a big brainfart and made the calculation from 10 cm instead . 
  edit : from 25 cm of course ... 
  i hate mondays . . 
  interesting , i had an 80s volvo which was all metric . 
  it is entirely possible , since us models have other specialities , that they made some parts that require regular service in imperial . 
  my oil plug was 25 mm , which truth to be told is very close to 10 '' . 
  i quite like * there 's no danger on the roof *, 
  older american/british cars often have measurements in both inches and metric , but an old volvo ( for example ) is just metric . 
  funny thing is rim sizes are in inches , but tires are mostly in metric . . 
  weighted average for girls is 16,1 years and for boys 16,6 years . 
  legal age of consent is 15 years , though the law is n't 100 % absolute . 
  \u00c5sa romson , the greens . 
  first it was discovered that she had painted her boat with illegal and environmentally bad copper based paint , and had filled it with tax exempt diesel ( which is a crime ) . 
  she also at one point called the 9/11 attacks an `` accident '' ( olycka ) , not very popular . . 
  among * sverigedemokraterna * there 's a lot to chose from . 
  [ kent ekroth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kent_ekeroth ) is a good example of one of the big clowns in that party . 
  i see , must be tougher competition here i guess since everyone has 30 days cancelation time and no subscription time . 
   in a world where it takes three months to cancel a phone plan is it still like that in germany ? 
  the chant can easily be lengthened by adding mor rhymes . 
  the oldest written variant of the chant is apparently from 1677 , and the word `` skvallerbytta '' has been in use since the 1500s . 
  i took some basic law courses while at uni . 
  and the law texts are extremely easy to come by . 
  the normal swede will recognize the majority of the law names ( as long as they read the news . . ) . 
  they will also have a basic understanding of what should be right and wrong in many cases , though i think that comes by instinct . 
  for sweden i think trials usually are 6 months , which are automatically transformed into a `` normal '' contract unless the employer has given you a notice . 
  indeed , this is actually a typical left-right divide in swedish politics .
